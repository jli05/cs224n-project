A SENTRY TOWER --\n\n               -- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere.\n\n               Small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower \n               cut through the ground mist. We HEAR all the unidentifiable \n               sounds of night in the woods. We also HEAR, very, very \n               faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. And as this starts, \n               we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER, more becomes visible \n               now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the \n               steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure \n               and leading to the lookout post, and finally... THE LOOKOUT \n               POST, maybe forty feet off the ground.\n\n               Standing the post is the silhouette of A MARINE. He's holding \n               a rifle and staring straight out.\n\n               The drum cadence has been building slightly.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               A WIDER SHOT OF THE FENCELINE. And we see by the moonlight \n               that the tall wire-mesh fence winds its way far, far into \n               the distance.\n\n               SUBTITLE: UNITED STATES NAVAL BASE GUANTANAMO BAY - CUBA.\n\n               The drum cadence continues, and we\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. A MARINE BARRACKS\n\n               We HEAR two pairs of footsteps and then\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE BARRACKS CORRIDOR\n\n               where we see that the footsteps belong to DAWSON and DOWNEY, \n               two young marines who we'll get to know later. They stop \n               when they get to a certain door. The drum cadence is still \n               growing. DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it \n               slowly.  He opens's the door and they walk into\n\n               INT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               WILLY SANTIAGO, a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in \n               his bunk.\n\n               DAWSON kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on SANTIAGO'S \n               shoulder and shakes him gently. SANTIAGO opens his yes, looks \n               at DAWSON, and for a moment there's nothing wrong --\n\n               -- and then SANTIAGO's eyes fill with terror. He lunges out \n               of the bed -- but forget about it. In one flash DAWSON and \n               DOWNEY grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come \n               out, DOWNEY's shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGO's mouth.\n\n               Everything that happens next occurs with speed, precision \n               and professionalism.\n\n               -- A strip of duct tape is pulled, ripped, and slapped onto \n               his mouth and eyes --\n\n               -- A length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet.\n\n                                     DOWNEY\n                              (quietly)\n                         You're lucky it's us, Willy.\n\n               -- An arm grabs him tightly around the neck, not choking \n               him, just holding his head still --\n\n               -- The drum cadence has built to a crescendo.

Incredible precision is the name of the game. \n               Each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were \n               all attached by a rod. Each drumstick raised to the same \n               fraction of a centimeter before striking. A RIFLE DRILL TEAM \n               that can't possibly be human. Flags, banners, the works.\n\n               SUBTITLE: THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD, WASHINGTON, D.C.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               HIGH ANGLE of the entire band an we end credits.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT.

She's bright, attractive, impulsive, and has a tendency \n               to speak quickly. If she had any friends, they'd call her \n               JO. As she walks, she mutters to herself ...\n\n                                     JO\n                         I'm requesting... I'm...

Santiago \n                         died at the base hospital \n                         approximately an hour later. The NIS \n                         agent who took their statements \n                         maintains they were trying to prevent \n                         Santiago from naming them in a \n                         fenceline shooting incident.

The '27 \n               Yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own \n               against a group of, say, Airforce dentists.\n\n               KAFFEE's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law \n               School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous \n               spirit to drive it. He is, at this point in his life, \n               passionate about nothing... except maybe softball.\n\n                                     KAFFEE\n                              (calling out to the \n                              team)\n                         Alright, let's get two!\n\n               He smacks one to the SECOND BASE. The ball bounces right \n               between his legs.\n\n                                     SECOND BASE\n                         Sorry!\n\n                                     KAFFEE\n                         Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby.  \n                         Just look the ball into your glove.\n\n               He smacks one out to the same place. It bounces off the heel \n               of SHERBY's glove and into center field.\n\n                                     SECOND BASE (SHERBY)\n                         Sorry!\n\n                                     KAFFEE\n                         You gotta trust me, Sherby. You keep \n                         your eyes open, your chances of \n                         catching the ball increase by a factor \n                         of ten.\n\n               SPRADLING, a young naval officer, sweaty and out of breath, \n               walks up behind the backstop.\n\n                                     SPRADLING\n                         Kaffee!\n\n                                     KAFFEE\n                         Let's try it again.\n\n                                     SPRADLING\n                         Kaffee!!\n\n                                     KAFFEE\n                              (turning)\n                         Dave.

He had a rough time of it.\n\n               THE SHOTS SHOULD INCLUDE:\n\n               -- SANTIAGO running along at the rear of a group of MARINES.  \n               It's been over seven miles and he's matted with sweat. A \n               SERGEANT runs up along side, grabs his back, and pushes him \n               to keep up with the group. SANTIAGO falls, struggles to get \n               back up and keep running, and\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT.

It's hot as hell and it looks like \n               he's gonna pass out.\n\n               He stumbles, and the SERGEANT picks him up and pushes him \n               down the hill. He rolls about 30 feet before he stops.

My sergeant \n                         grabbed me and pushed me down the \n                         hill.

Yes I suppose \n                         you're right. I suppose that's the \n                         thing to do. Wait. Wait. I've got a \n                         better idea. Let's transfer the whole \n                         squad off the base. Let's -- on second \n                         thought -- Windward. The whole \n                         Windward division, let's transfer \n                         'em off the base. Jon, go on out \n                         there and get those boys down off \n                         the fence, they're packing their \n                         bags.\n                              (calling out)\n                         Tom!\n\n               The ORDERLY cones in from the outer office.\n\n                                     ORDERLY\n                         Sir!\n\n                                     JESSEP\n                         Got me the President on the phone, \n                         we're surrendering our position in \n                         Cuba.\n\n                                     ORDERLY\n                         Yes sir!\n\n                                     JESSEP\n                         Wait a minute, Tom.\n\n               The ORDERLY stops.\n\n                                     JESSEP\n                              (continuing)\n                         Don't call the President just yet. \n                         Maybe we should consider this for a \n                         second. Maybe -- and I'm just spit \n                         balling here -- but maybe we as \n                         officers have a responsibility to \n                         train Santiago. Maybe we as officers \n                         have a responsibility to this country \n                         to see that the men and women charged \n                         with its security are trained \n                         professionals.

Santiago stays \n                         where he is. We're gonna train the \n                         lad. You're in charge, Jon. Santiago \n                         doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness \n                         report, I'm gonna blame you.

Your father's Lionel \n                         Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate \n                         and Attorney General, of the United \n                         States, died 1985. You went to Harvard \n                         Law on a Navy scholarship, probably \n                         because that's what your father wanted \n                         you to do, and now you're just \n                         treading water for the three years \n                         you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, \n                         just kinda layin' low til you can \n                         get out and get a real job.

A few minutes later, \n                         a chemical reaction in Santiago's \n                         body called lactic acidosis caused \n                         his lungs to begin bleeding. He \n                         drowned in his own blood and was \n                         pronounced dead at 32 minutes past \n                         midnight. These are the facts of the \n                         case. And they are undisputed. That's \n                         right.

Furthermore, \n                         the Government will also demonstrate \n                         that the defendants soaked the rag \n                         with poison, and entered Santiago's \n                         room with motive and intent to kill.\n                              (beat)\n                         Now, Lt.

The second call \n                         was to set up a meeting with \n                         Congressman Ramond of the House Armed \n                         Services Committee, and the third \n                         call was to my sister Elizabeth.\n\n                                     KAFFEE\n                         Why did you make that call, sir?\n\n                                     JESSEP\n                         I thought she might like to have \n                         dinner tonight.\n\n                                     ROSS\n                         Judge --\n\n                                     RANDOLPH\n                         I'm gonna put a stop to this now.\n\n               Jo's handed KAFFEE another printout and a stack of letters.\n\n                                     KAFFEE\n                         Your honor, these are the telephone \n                         records from GITMO for August 6th.  \n                         And these are 14 letters that Santiago \n                         wrote in nine months requesting, in \n                         fact begging, for a transfer.\n                              (to JESSEP)\n                         Upon hearing the news that he was \n                         finally getting his transfer, Santiago \n                         was so excited, that do you know how \n                         many people he called? Zero. Nobody. \n                         Not one call to his parents saying \n                         he was coming home. Not one call to \n                         a friend saying can you pick me up \n                         at the airport. He was asleep in his \n                         bed at midnight, and according to \n                         you he was getting on a plane in six \n                         hours, yet everything he owned was \n                         hanging neatly in his closet and \n                         folded neatly in his footlocker.

Santiago was leaving for the \n                         rest of his life, and he hadn't called \n                         a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. \n                         Can you explain that? The fact is \n                         there was no transfer order. Santiago \n                         wasn't going anywhere, isn't that \n                         right, Colonel.\n\n                                     ROSS\n                         Object.

SAM and JO stand as well.\n\n                                     RANDOLPH\n                              (reading)\n                         On the charge of Murder, the Members \n                         find the defendants Not Guilty.\n\n               It's hard to resist the temptation to scream and shout, but \n               they do.\n\n                                     RANDOLPH\n                              (continuing; reading)\n                         On the charge of Conspiracy to Commit \n                         Murder, the Members find the \n                         defendants Not Guilty.\n\n               RANDOLPH looks up.

Santiago compared unfavorably to his fellow Marines, had poor relations with them, and failed to respect the chain of command in attempts at being transferred to another base. An argument evolves between base commander Colonel Nathan Jessup and his officers: while Jessup's executive officer, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson, advocates that Santiago be transferred immediately, Jessup regards this as akin to surrender and orders Santiago's commanding officer, Lieutenant Kendrick, to train Santiago to become a better Marine.\nWhen Dawson and Downey are later arrested for Santiago's murder, naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway suspects they carried out a \"code red\" order, a violent extrajudicial punishment. Galloway asks to defend them, but instead, the case is given to Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee, an inexperienced and unenthusiastic U.S. Navy lawyer. Initially, friction exists between Galloway, who resents Kaffee's tendency to plea bargain, and Kaffee, who resents Galloway's interference. Kaffee and the prosecutor, his friend Captain Jack Ross (USMC), negotiate a bargain, but Dawson and Downey refuse to go along. They insist they were ordered by Lieutenant Kendrick to shave Santiago's head, minutes after Kendrick publicly ordered the platoon not to touch the would-be victim, and did not intend their victim to die. Kaffee is finally won over by Galloway and takes the case to court.\nIn the course of the trial, the defense manages to establish the existence of \"code red\" orders at Guantanamo and that Dawson specifically had learned not to disobey any order, having been denied a promotion after helping out a fellow Marine who was under what could be seen as a \"code red\". However, the defense also suffers setbacks when a cross-examination reveals Private Downey was not actually present when Dawson and he supposedly received the \"code red\" order. Lieutenant Colonel Markinson reveals to Kaffee that Jessup never intended to transfer Santiago off the base, but commits suicide rather than testify in court because he feels that he had failed to do the right thing by protecting a Marine under his command.\nWithout Markinson's testimony, Kaffee believes the case lost and returns home in a drunken stupor, having come to regret he fought the case instead of arranging a plea bargain. Galloway, however, convinces Kaffee to call Colonel Jessup as a witness despite the risk of being court-martialled for smearing a high-ranking officer. Jessup initially outsmarts Kaffee's questioning, but is unnerved when the lawyer points out a contradiction in his testimony: Jessup had stated he wanted to transfer Santiago off the base for his own safety, but if he ordered his men to leave Santiago alone and if Marines always obey orders, Santiago would have been in no danger. Under heavy pressure from Kaffee and unnerved by being caught in one of his own lies, an enraged Jessup extols his and the military's importance to national security, and eventually reveals that he ordered the \"code red\". As he justifies his actions, Jessup is arrested; Kendrick would later be arrested for his perjury.\nSoon afterwards, Dawson and Downey are cleared of the murder charge, but found guilty of \"conduct unbecoming a United States Marine\" and dishonorably discharged. Dawson accepts the verdict, but Downey does not understand what they had done wrong. Dawson explains they had failed to stand up for those too weak to fight for themselves, like Santiago. As the two prepare to leave, Kaffee tells Dawson he does not need a patch on his arm to have honor. Dawson, who had previously shown contempt for Kaffee for not understanding the Marine ethos, recognizes him as an officer and renders a salute."}

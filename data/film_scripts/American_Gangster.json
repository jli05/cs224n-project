BUMPY'S APARTMENT - LATER                                     6\n\n    The report continues on a TV no one's really watching here:\n    a March of Time-like history of Bumpy Johnson, famed Harlem\n    gangster, Robin Hood and killer.\n\n                              REPORTER ON TV\n                 He was a Great Man, according to the\n                 eulogies. A giving man. A man of the\n                 people. No one chose to include in their\n                 remembrances the word most often\n                 associated with Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson:\n                 Gangster.\n\n    Sitting off by himself in Bumpy's elegant garden apartment,\n    heretofore his private sanctuary, Frank surveys the mourners\n    circling the place like vultures:\n\n    Tango Black, a huge brute, scavenging the catered food and\n    tended bar ... Jackie Fox, surrounded by his ever-present\n    coterie of sycophants ... Albert Tosca, an elegant Italian\n    capo, and an underling, Rossi, at the bar.\n\n                              TOSCA\n                 White wine, please.\n\n    A white man who looks like a banker - and is - sits down\n    next to Frank.\n\n                              BANKER\n                 How you doing, Frank?\n\n                              FRANK\n                 All right.\n\n                              BANKER\n                 What a loss.\n                        (Frank nods)\n                 How are you otherwise?

It feels unseemly to him to be talking\n    about money here. He watches Tango carelessly set a watery\n    glass of ice on an antique inlaid chess table.\n\n                              BANKER\n                 Bumpy set something up for you?\n\n    Frank excuses himself without an answer, crosses to where\n    Tango left the glass, and sets it on a coaster.\n\n                              TANGO\n                 Hey, Frank, get me an ashtray while\n                 you're at it.\n\n    Bumpy's German shepherd watches as Frank reaches into his\n    jacket, revealing a gun nestled in its shoulder holster. He\n    takes out a handkerchief, wipes the condensation dry, opens\n    a drawer and removes an ashtray. He holds it out to Tango -\n    who isn't sure it's not a dare and decides to wander off.\n\n                              CHARLIE\n                 I know you're hurting, Frank.    So am I.\n\n    Frank sits back down with Charlie Williams, an older dope\n    man.\n\n                              CHARLIE\n                 You going to be all right?\n\n                             FRANK\n                 Yeah.\n\n                              CHARLIE\n                 I'm sure Bumpy never told you, but he\n                 made me promise, anything ever happened\n                 to him, I'd make sure you didn't go\n                 without.\n\n                              FRANK\n                 I'll be fine, Charlie. Half the people\n                 here owed Bumpy money when he died. A\n                 lot of money. If they think I'm going\n                 to forget to collect, they're wrong.\n\n                              CHARLIE\n                 That's the spirit. Go get them.\n\n    On the TV, over archive film and photographs of crime\n    figures from the 1940's and `50's, the opinion is offered\n    that Bumpy's death \"marks the end of an era ...\"\n\n                                                                     5.\n                              \n\n\n\n\nA7   INT.

In alleyways it's cooked up\n      and sucked into syringes, and in dank, grim, indescribably\n      filthy rooms, plunged into veins -\n\n124   AND THE REVERSE:                                             124\n\n      10 and 20 dollar bills changing hands - decks of cash\n      rubber-banded together - put into envelopes and delivered\n      to the Lucas brothers, to:\n\n125   LESTER at his metal door shop.                               125\n\n126   EUGENE at his dry cleaners.                                  126\n\n127   TURNER at his tire service shop.                             127\n\n128   EARL at his electrical shop.                                 128\n\n                                                                  (CONT)\n\n                                                                      52.\n                                \n123   CONTINUED:                                                      123\n\n\n129   TEDDY at his body shop.                                          129\n\n130   INT.

The brothers rubberband it all\n      in $100,000 decks. Jot down the numbers. Put the money\n      in newly-assembled file boxes. Tape them shut.\n\n131   INT.

It's a\n      kind of office party for Frank's brothers, cousins, wives\n      and girlfriends, distributors like Rossi and other East\n      Harlem guys, Charlie Williams, couple of cops on Frank's\n      payroll, and the Chemical Bank Vice President.\n\n                                BANKER\n                   You got a stockbroker, Frank?\n\n                                FRANK\n                   I deal with enough crooks as it is.\n\n      The banker jots down a name and phone number on the back of\n      one of his business cards.\n\n                                BANKER\n                   This one couldn't be more honest. Ask\n                   around. He's got a lot of clients in the\n                   business. You can't leave all your money\n                   in safety deposit boxes; give him a call.\n\n      The banker hands him the card and moves on. Frank's trying\n      to have a good time, but the level of noise and revelry is\n      beginning to make him uncomfortable.\n\n                                 CHARLIE\n                   Frank.

SPEARMAN'S CAR - MOVING - NEAR GW BRIDGE - DAY 143\n      Spearman watches the pickup truck driven by the mechanic\n      change lanes up ahead - heading for the George Washington\n      Bridge - and glances over concerned to Richie, who is\n      changing the cashmere sweater for an old t-shirt.\n\n                                SPEARMAN\n                   He's going into New York.

EAST HARLEM STREET - DAY                                   144\n\n      The pickup pulls to the curb outside a Pleasant Avenue\n      grocery store. As the guy enters the place, Spearman's car\n      stops long enough for Richie to climb out, and continues on.\n\n      Richie crosses the street, tries to see who the guy is\n      talking to inside, but he's just buying a cup of coffee to\n      go. Spearman's car turns the corner to circle around the\n      block. As soon as it's gone, the man emerges from the\n      restaurant with the coffee and walks straight at Richie who\n      has to double back quickly not to be seen\n\n      Richie sees a delivery truck double-parked, guys unloading\n      crates. Hears a horn and knows it's must be Spearman stuck\n      on the side street. The mechanic starts his truck.\n      Desperate not to lose him (and his money), Richie hurries               \n      over to a taxi stopped at a light, flashes his badge.                   \n\n                               RICHIE\n                   Get out.\n\n                               TAXI DRIVER\n                   What?\n\n                                RICHIE\n                   Get the fuck out of the car!\n\n      The driver realizes the man outside his taxi is crazy and\n      tries to get his window rolled up. Reaching in, Richie gets\n      his arm stuck, pulls at the lock, yanks the door open, drags\n      the driver out, breaking the cabbie's arm, and jumps in.\n\n      He swings the cab into opposing lanes to get around traffic,\n      screeches around the corner, glimpses the truck far up ahead\n      - guns the engine, flies through a red light, glances at his\n      mirror at the cars that just missed him almost colliding -\n\n      The truck turns up ahead, and Richie barrels through another\n      red light, turns the corner and keeps the truck, a couple\n      car-lengths ahead - in sight.\n\n145   EXT. EAST HARLEM - DAY                                          145\n\n      Richie curbs the cab as the guy goes into a dingy pizza\n      parlor. Richie climbs out, crosses the street. Coming past\n      the place, he tries to look inside without breaking stride.\n\n\n\n                                                                     (CONT)\n\n                                                                      59.\n                                \n145   CONTINUED:                                                      145\n\n\n      From around a corner, striding toward him, come four men\n      looking like Gestapo thugs in leather coats, manicured hair -\n      the Princes of the City. Richie detours into an alley as\n      they enter the restaurant.\n\n      Richie peers in at the restaurant kitchen through a grimy\n      basement window. Watches Trupo and his SIU detectives burst\n      in, guns drawn. They rough everybody up, get some down on\n      the floor. One detective gathers the money and stuffs it in\n      a bag. Another gathers the dope. The mechanic tries to\n      protest and Trupo slaps him down with his pistol.\n\n      Richie keeps watching as the NY cops arrest no one - but\n      take the dope and the money (Richie's money) - and stride\n      out as abruptly as they appeared, like bandits. As they\n      come past Richie -\n\n                                RICHIE\n                   That's my money.\n\n                                SIU DET 1\n                   The fuck are you.

The one who doesn't laugh hangs back as the others\n      start off. He examines Richie's New Jersey ID.                           \n\n                                TRUPO\n                   When's the last time I was in Jersey?\n                   Let me think.

Now, that Grand Jury\n                could come in very favorably. Might turn\n                out to be Attempted Manslaughter. Self\n                Defense even. She had a knife. Depends\n                on how I want to deal with you. You see\n                where this is going.\n\n      Jimmy looks around at the basement dungeon with concern.\n\n                             JIMMY\n                The fuck is this place?\n\n                             RICHIE\n                Let's say you beat it somehow.

And then you beat\n                an attempted murder? Is he stupid?\n                He'll assume you talked.\n\n      Jimmy can easily imagine that scenario and it frightens him.\n\n\n                                                                   (CONT)\n\n                                                                      79.\n                                \n205   CONTINUED:                                                      205\n\n\n                                RICHIE\n                   You fucked up, Jimmy.

Or do you\n                   want to walk out of here - no bail, no\n                   trial - just walk out, now.\n\n206   EXT.

He snaps it open revealing stacks of cash, hands\n      it over and walks to a semi-truck, glancing once in Richie's\n      direction. Though he can't see anyone there he gives a wave\n      to them - or is it to the truck driver to pull out -\n\n                                                                   80.\n                             \n\n\n\n\n211    EXT.

When Johnson dies of a heart attack, he take control of the Harlem crime scene.\nAfter handing in almost $1 million that he found in a mobster's car, Newark detective Richie Roberts is eschewed in his precinct. After his exiled and addicted partner overdoses a potent brand of heroin called \"Blue Magic\", Captain Lou Toback puts Roberts in charge of a task force that targets local suppliers. Lucas buys Blue Magic directly from producers in Thailand and smuggles it into the U.S. through returning Vietnam War servicemen. His low overhead allows him to eventually wholesale Blue Magic to most the dealers in the New York area. With this monopoly, Lucas expands his control to nightclubs, casinos, and prostitution. He buys a mansion for his mother and recruits his five brothers, including Huey and Turner, as lieutenants to spread his empire. During his rise to becoming Harlem's crime boss, Lucas falls in love with Eva, a Puerto Rican beauty queen.\nAs Lucas' business prospers, he makes a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting police attention. Also, he stays away from the drugs to avoid making hard decisions under the influence. However, Lucas disregards this habit while attending the Fight of the Century with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes given to him by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas is forced to contend with Lucchese mafia boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroying Lucas' family unless he gets a cut of a deal, and corrupt NYPD detectives such as Nick Trupo, who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure Nicky Barnes, a young gun motivated to take over Harlem who has been diluting Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name. After the Fall of Saigon cuts off Lucas' supply, he is forced to rely on the other crime rings.\nRoberts' detectives witness Frank Lucas' cousin shoot a woman and then use his driver's predicament to get him to wear a wire. This allows Roberts and his task force to identify and search one of the last planes carrying Lucas' stock, discovering Blue Magic in the coffins of dead returning servicemen; this evidence allows them to obtain a warrant to follow drugs into Newark's projects and Lucas' heroin processing facility. This results in a shootout, in which Steve Lucas, Frank Lucas' young nephew who gave up a promising career for the New York Yankees to join Lucas' family, is killed. Meanwhile, Trupo and his men break into Lucas' mansion and kill his dog to steal his emergency cash supply hidden under the doghouse. Earlier, Lucas had Trupo's prized Shelby Mustang destroyed, and although he is now out for Trupo's life, his mother dissuades him from killing a cop, warning him that she and Eva will leave him if he does. Lucas is arrested after Roberts' team conducts a raid on all of his shops run by his brothers.\nIn the police station, Roberts gives Lucas a chance at a shorter jail sentence if he aids his investigation. Lucas initially offered to bribe Roberts, but in the end Lucas provides Roberts with the names of dirty cops in the NYPD, out of respect for Roberts' incorruptibility. In the end, three quarters of the New York DEA are arrested and convicted, and a distraught Trupo commits suicide to avoid arrest. Roberts, having passed the bar exam, prosecutes Lucas, who, once it becomes clear he will be convicted, provides evidence that leads to more than one-hundred further drug-related convictions, while he himself is sentenced to 70 years in prison, of which he serves 15 years and is released in 1991."}

She carefully\r\n    starts helping him put it back together.\r\n\r\n                        RICHIE DIMASO\r\n              Big fucking deal.

What looks to be stolen art sits on the floor all\r\n     around him.\r\n\r\n                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)\r\n               And I did some art dealing on the\r\n               side.

He\r\n              had this air about him. And he had\r\n              this confidence that drew me to\r\n              him. He was who he was and he\r\n              didn't care.\r\n\r\n                        IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)\r\n              Like me, she was a very particular\r\n              person. Like me, she came from a\r\n              place where her options were\r\n              limited -- and she had been someone\r\n              she didn't want to be in her past.\r\n\r\n    CUT TO -- SYDNEY DANCES IN A SMALL TOWN, OLD FASHIONED STRIP\r\n    BAR.\r\n\r\n                        SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)\r\n              It actually can feel kind of sexy\r\n              sometimes. There's a boldness in\r\n              it. But where would that boldness\r\n              take me? I didn't know.

She knew she had\r\n              to reinvent her life and her\r\n              identity. And like me, she\r\n              envisioned a better elegant future\r\n              for herself.

TV -- Irv goes to A CLOSED DOOR\r\n     WITH YANKEE STICKERS on it --\r\n\r\n     Irv OPENS A BEDROOM DOOR TO REVEAL HIS 5 YEAR OLD SON, DANNY.\r\n\r\n                         SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)\r\n               He was married, and he had a son.\r\n\r\n\r\n58   INT. DANNY'S ROOM - NIGHT                                       58\r\n\r\n     DANNY is on the bed, picture books, baseball cards, spread\r\n     all around him. Irv stands holding the picture. Danny looks\r\n     over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n                         SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)\r\n               He had adopted her son.\r\n\r\n                         DANNY\r\n               DADDY!\r\n                                                             24.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SYDNEY PROSSER (V.O.)\r\n               He was a really good dad and I\r\n               respected him for that. It was a\r\n               tough situation for everyone.\r\n\r\n     Irv's face lights up.\r\n\r\n                        IRVING ROSENFELD\r\n               Danny. This is a fantastic\r\n               picture. What did you do today?\r\n\r\n                         DANNY\r\n               That kid Donovan is being mean to\r\n               me.\r\n\r\n                         IRVING ROSENFELD\r\n               The big kid?

[Irv looks at\r\n               him] Mommy got the lamp. She made\r\n               her special drink and the lamp made\r\n               a fire.\r\n\r\n     Irv looks concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n59   INT.

I marry her. I adopt him -\r\n-\r\n\r\n          ROSALYN ROSENFELD\r\nYou fell in love! Don't forget we\r\nfell madly in love!\r\n\r\n          IRVING ROSENFELD\r\nYes, I fell in love. My God, I\r\nfell in love. Yes. But you know\r\nwhat? I thought you were\r\nmysterious like my mother until it\r\nturned out that mysterious just\r\nmeant depressed, hard to reach. I\r\nmean, I'm dying here! And you need\r\nsomebody who's gonna be quiet like\r\nyou. You're young, you're\r\nbeautiful. You gotta find somebody\r\nelse. You gotta go out and get\r\nsome friends all right? Don't sit\r\ninside --\r\n\r\n          ROSALYN ROSENFELD\r\nI don't like going out. You know\r\nthat I get anxiety when I have to\r\nmeet people. You know how hard that\r\nis.\r\n\r\n          IRVING ROSENFELD\r\nYeah but you can't just stay in the\r\nhouse with the fucking sun lamp.\r\nAlright? And I can't-- I mean,\r\nlook, I can't trust you with it\r\nanyway. That fire and everything. I\r\ncan't trust to leave you with\r\nDanny.\r\n\r\n          ROSALYN ROSENFELD\r\nI put the fire out Irving! There is\r\nno fire! Maybe if you were here\r\nmore, then there wouldn't have been\r\na fire in the first place.\r\n\r\n          IRVING ROSENFELD\r\nOh, what, there wouldn't have been\r\na fire if I was here?\r\n                                                          26.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD\r\n          Just stop with the whole fire\r\n          thing. God it was a mistake. I'm\r\n          sure a million people do that all\r\n          the time. Those sun lamps are\r\n          dangerous. Shouldn't even have them\r\n          in the house, really. I bet that\r\n          happens all the time. This was\r\n          nothing.\r\n\r\n                    IRVING ROSENFELD\r\n          We're not happy. Alright?\r\n\r\nRosalyn just stares there for a moment at Irving saying\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n                    ROSALYN ROSENFELD\r\n          You know that I could take Danny.\r\n          You know that most of your work is\r\n          illegal. And you know that if you\r\n          tried to divorce me, you know that--\r\n          I'm not saying that I would, but\r\n          I'm saying that I could. And I'm\r\n          saying that that is why I don't\r\n          like divorce, Irving. Women do that\r\n          in divorces. Women get the\r\n          children, and then the fathers\r\n          never see them. My mother never got\r\n          divorced. My grandmother never got\r\n          divorced. There are NO divorces in\r\n          my family. I am not getting a\r\n          divorce.\r\n\r\n                    IRVING ROSENFELD\r\n          Come on.

Edith looks like she's coming apart -- circles under her\r\n     eyes, a shadow of her confident self -- pale, scared, hair\r\n     flat, stringy, unglamourous, pacing, rocking.\r\n\r\n                         IRVING ROSENFELD (V.O.)\r\n65             She couldn't handle it.                               65\r\n\r\n\r\n66   INT.

Cell\r\n     is unlocked by Richie Dimaso WHO enters with a cup and saucer\r\n     of tea. He stands near her with the tea.\r\n\r\n                         RICHIE DIMASO\r\n                   (to the other side of the\r\n                    two-way mirror)\r\n               Joe, how come the fluorescents are\r\n               on? Can we kill that, please? (to\r\n               Syd) Jesus I put this lamp here for\r\n               you 'cause I thought it'd be better\r\n               for you. There's a wire here.\r\n               They're scared because people hang\r\n               themselves but I know you're too\r\n               smart for that. Where's the table\r\n               and chair? There's no bed here?\r\n               It's like a fucking asylum. Joe, is\r\n               everybody off today? Jesus Christ\r\n               it's scary. Maybe I wanted to scare\r\n               you. I don't know. Maybe it was my\r\n               idea. Maybe i'm a little off the\r\n               beaten path you know? I don't know.\r\n               You look dehydrated. Here, want to\r\n               try some tea? Oh yeah, your lips\r\n               are all chapped. (re: tea) It's\r\n               herbal. My favorite.\r\n\r\n     Richie bends down to Edith who is sitting on the floor in the\r\n     corner and hands her the cup and saucer. She lifts the cup\r\n     but her hand is shaking almost violently as she raises the\r\n     cup to her lips.\r\n\r\n                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)\r\n               I know you think -- look at me.\r\n               Hey.

I\r\n          know you think you know him -- that\r\n          he sees the world as a cold, dark\r\n          place, and he cares about nobody\r\n          but very few people on his short\r\n          list: his son, his father, Rosalyn,\r\n          and you. And you think you're at\r\n          the top of that list. But what if\r\n          you're not. What if you're not even\r\n          on the list at all? He'd be in\r\n          here right now if he took the\r\n          check.\r\n\r\nShe thinks about this. She trembles.\r\n\r\n                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)\r\n          He'd be in here right now if he\r\n          took the check. But no, you did.\r\n          God, it's, it's so clear to me.\r\n          It's so crazy -- it's clear to me,\r\n          but it's not clear to you. He uses\r\n          you, Edith, to protect himself. To\r\n          protect his son and his wife in\r\n          Long Island. No? Yes. He put a\r\n          ring on her finger, he adopted her\r\n          son. They have huge house, they\r\n          have two cars. What does she do all\r\n          day? I'll tell you what she does --\r\n          she plays with her nails, she\r\n          watches T.V., and she spends your\r\n          money, the money that you make.\r\n\r\nEdith stares at Richie, taking this in.\r\n\r\n                    RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)\r\n          I don't like that you're in jail\r\n          while he's going free. I don't\r\n          like any of that. I want to help\r\n          you. All the razzle-dazzle that he\r\n          does, it's not good. It's not real.\r\n          It's fake. It's not real. Who you\r\n          are is who you are, between you and\r\n          God. You and your soul. That's what\r\n          matters. That's what counts.\r\n          That's what I'm about. And that's\r\n          what I see in you. Tell me you\r\n          didn't feel it the first time we\r\n          saw each other. Am I crazy? I don't\r\n          think so. I'm not supposed to be\r\n          talking like this, but I don't\r\n          care, I break the rules.\r\n\r\nEdith looks at Richie in silence as she thinks about what\r\nhe's saying.\r\n                                                             34.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         RICHIE DIMASO (CONT'D)\r\n               Okay, Edith? Edith. I want to help\r\n               you. I like you. (whispers) I like\r\n               you. (dead serious) I like you.\r\n\r\n\r\n67   INT.

I want to go after white\r\n               collar crime. Irving, you're very\r\n               skilled. And I want you to teach me\r\n               and we can do this.

Russell\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb", "summary": "The opening screen says: \"Some of this actually happened.\"\nIn 1978, con artists Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) have started a relationship and are working together. Sydney has improved Rosenfeld's scams, posing as English aristocrat \"Lady Edith Greensly\". Irving loves Sydney, though is hesitant to leave his unstable and histrionic wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), fearing he will lose contact with her son Danny, whom Irving has adopted. Rosalyn has also threatened to report Irving to the police if he leaves her.\nFBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) catches Irving and Sydney in a loan scam, but offers to release them if Irving can line up four additional arrests. Sydney opposes the agreement. Richie believes Sydney is English but has proof that her claim of aristocracy is fraudulent. Sydney tells Irving she will manipulate Richie, distancing herself from Irving.\nIrving has a friend pretending to be a wealthy Arab sheikh looking for potential investments in America. An associate of Irving's suggests the sheikh do business with Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) of Camden, New Jersey, who is campaigning to revitalize gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, but has struggled in fundraising. Carmine seems to have a genuine desire to help the area's economy and his constituents.\nRichie devises a plan to make mayor Polito the target of a sting operation, despite the objections of Irving and of Richie's boss, Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K.). Sydney helps Richie manipulate an FBI secretary into making an unauthorized wire transfer of $2,000,000. When Stoddard's boss, Anthony Amado (Alessandro Nivola), hears of the operation, he praises Richie's initiative, pressuring Stoddard to continue.\nCarmine leaves their meeting when Richie presses him to accept a cash bribe. Irving convinces Carmine the sheikh is legitimate, expressing his dislike of Richie, and the two become friends. Richie arranges for Carmine to meet the sheikh, and without consulting the others, has Mexican-American FBI agent Paco Hernandez (Michael Pe\u00f1a) play the sheikh, which displeases Irving.\nCarmine brings the sheikh to a casino party, explaining mobsters are there and it is a necessary part of doing business. Irving is surprised to hear that Mafia overlord Victor Tellegio (Robert De Niro), right-hand man to Meyer Lansky, is present, and that he wants to meet the sheikh. Mafia man Tellegio explains that the business needs the sheikh to become an American citizen and that Carmine will need to expedite the process. Tellegio also requires a $10,000,000 wire transfer to prove the sheikh's legitimacy. Richie agrees, eager to bring down Tellegio, while Irving realizes the operation is out of control.\nRichie confesses his strong attraction to Sydney but becomes confused and aggressive when she drops her English accent and admits to being American. Irving arrives to protect Sydney and tries to stop their deal with Richie, but Richie says if they back out, Tellegio will learn of the scam and will murder them all, including Rosalyn and Danny.\nRosalyn starts an affair with a mobster, Pete Musane (Jack Huston), whom she met at the party. She mentions her belief that Irving is working with the Internal Revenue Service, causing Pete to threaten Irving, who promises to prove the sheikh's investment is real. Irving later confronts Rosalyn, who admits she told Pete. She agrees to keep quiet but wants a divorce.\nWith Carmine's help, Richie and Irving videotape members of Congress receiving bribes. Richie assaults Stoddard in a fight over the money and later convinces Amado that he needs the $10,000,000 to get Tellegio, but gets only $2,000,000. A meeting is arranged at the offices of Tellegio's lawyer, Alfonse Simone (Paul Herman), but Tellegio does not appear. Richie records Simone's admission of criminal activities.\nIrving visits mayor and friend Carmine and admits to the scam, but says he has a plan to help him. Carmine throws Irving out. Irving and Sydney meet with Amado, Stoddard and Richie. The feds inform Irving that their $2,000,000 is missing, and that they have received an anonymous offer to return the money in exchange for Irving and Sydney's immunity and a reduced sentence for Carmine. Richie accuses Irving of theft. Irving suggests Richie either has the money or is incompetent for losing it. In fact, he reveals, they never met with Tellegio's lawyer. Instead, Irving had a friend, Edward Malone, posing as Simone to con Richie. Amado accepts the deal with Stoddard removing Richie from the case, which effectively ends his career and drops him back into obscurity.\nIrving and Sydney move in together and open a legitimate art gallery, while Rosalyn lives with Pete and shares custody of Danny with Irving."}

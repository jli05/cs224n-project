(A video-cam records his answers.) \n               Two Outpost LAWYERS sit next to him. One of the Agents is \n               reading from a document:\n\n                                     DOJ AGENT\n                         \"Infotek's urgent need to license \n                         Outpost Office is such that we can \n                         use it as a tool in the current \n                         negotiation.\"\n                              (looks up)\n                         When you wrote the word \"tool,\" what'd \n                         you mean by it?\n\n               Gary studies his copy of the E-mail.

Am I supposed to \n                         speculate under oath?\n\n               The Agent shifts in his seat. We get an idea of Gary's \n               negotiating skill (making the other party look unreasonable, \n               while offering nothing).\n\n                                     OTHER AGENT\n                         Since you didn't have an answer to \n                         that question, Mr. Boyd --\n\n                                     GARY\n                              (\"confused\" again)\n                         Didn't I?

As he stares at Gary, we zoom with a \n               reverse dolly so that the background retreats queasily but \n               Gary remains dominant in frame. For Milo, it feels like the \n               very ground is going out from under him.\n\n               Gary continues to explain, pointing at lines of code.

MILO'S CAR/OUTPOST PARKING LOT - DAY\n\n               Pulling out of the lot, Milo seizes the car phone. He hits \n               HOME on the speed-dial. Gets a busy signal. Rings off. He's \n               about to press re-dial when he sees the Outpost logo branded \n               on the receiver.\n\n               He throws it down like it's contaminated.\n\n               EXT.

DAY CARE CENTER - A MOMENT LATER\n\n               At the entrance, Milo applies the swipe-card.\n\n               INT. DAY CARE CENTER - CONTINUOUS\n\n               He steps in on colorful carpeting, amid balls & tricycles. \n               Kid's artwork hangs on the wall. He moves through this room, \n               into the\n\n               COMPUTER ROOM\n\n               20 screens glow. They hang suspended over a wide, ringed \n               table, a chair at each keyboard. Indeed, Gary has spared no \n               expense for the toddlers: they're flat, sleek, digital \n               screens. At the moment, they show colorful, childish contour \n               drawings that say WHERE I WANNA WORK (e.g.: a spaceship). \n               There are a dozen more screens on tables at the perimeter of \n               the room showing screensavers (eg: angelfish swimming).\n\n               Milo moves slowly around the table, studying the screens. \n               Not surprisingly, most of the WHERE I WANNA WORK drawings \n               are of desks or tables with computers.\n\n               Tracking just ahead of Milo, we get to a screen that shows a \n               workstation with a red pennant on the wall, a rubber plant \n               at each end of a desk. Even in contour form it's -- familiar. \n               Milo passes it. And comes back to it.\n\n               Staring at it, he sits. He begins typing. [The drawing still \n               occupies the screen, but in a window he's brought up at the \n               bottom, there is dense, DOS-looking code.] He types furiously -- \n               numbers, symbols, backslashes. Whatever he's trying to do is \n               a challenge even to him. He deletes lines, begins anew, his \n               frustration evident.\n\n               As he works through the layers of code, the pixels on the \n               screen start to fill in. The contour lines slowly dissolve \n               into a live broadcast image of Teddy's workstation in \n               Sunnyvale (eerily empty, now).\n\n               When all the pixels have fallen into place, Milo hears CLICK \n               CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK from every direction, as all the \n               screens in the room fill in with live broadcast images. All \n               of them show variations on a theme:\n\n               A workstation seen by a camera over-the-shoulder of a \n               programmer (if he were present). The stations are of various \n               shapes and sizes, but in each case we have an unobstructed \n               view of screen & keyboard. At this hour, few programmers are \n               present. One guy has fallen asleep, his head on a desk. A \n               Japanese Geek is hard at work: it's day there.\n\n               INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Phil and Randy work at the coffee table.\n\n                                     PHIL\n                         Did you download Corey?

DAY CARE - COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Milo works the keyboard. Again, the code gets dense and \n               obscure as he goes deeper. He succeeds in calling-up a \n               graphical interface. Among the menus he can choose from are: \n               TARGET SCHOOLS, PD UPLOADS, RX UPLOADS.\n\n               He clicks Target Schools, a menu shoots down (Berkeley, Cal \n               Tech, etc.). He clicks Stanford, then Chin, Teddy. Two windows \n               open. In one, there is a video stream of Teddy winning an \n               award in the Gate's Bldg. In the other, uploaded police video \n               stenciled SUNNYVALE PD) of the White Supremacists whose mug-\n               shots we saw in the San Jose Mercury; they're being \n               interrogated.\n\n               In the first window, Teddy's image dissolves into a handheld \n               crime-scene video (marked SV-PD) of a ransacked grocery store. \n               \"DIE GOOK!\" is painted on a wall. Milo looks confused: some \n               \"narrative\" is unfolding, but it remains obscure without \n               audio.\n\n               He types some more.\n\n               In the bottom window, he brings up convoluted text regarding \n               the audio. About the only phrases we can understand are: \n               \"Audio Block ON\" and \"Hardware Requirement: Magnetic Filter \n               Type PBX-R17.\"\n\n               His eyes cast about the room for some suitable hardware \n               substitute. He digs in his shirt pocket. He takes out his \n               swipe card, studies it. He casts about some more, till he \n               sees some kids' safety scissors in a jar.\n\n               INT. BUILDING 20 - SERVICE HALL - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Randy whistles as he heads up the hall. Arriving at the door \n               with the Civil Defense sticker, he swipes his card.\n\n               INT. DAY CARE COMPUTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n               On-screen, long-lens footage shows a low building; the Aryan \n               Nations suspects come out of it. A still photo appears in \n               the 2nd window: a steel hasp.\n\n               Milo's eyes are narrowed: what am I seeing? Meantime, he is \n               reaching under the table where he has removed a plate from \n               the mainframe terminal, exposing hardware within.\n\n               He has trimmed the swipe card to size and is wedging its \n               magnetic strip into a metal slot. He wiggles the card. We \n               hear an eerie fibrillation, which flattens into the voice of \n               a serene, eminently sane female:\n\n                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR\n                         -- run this methamphetamine lab known \n                         to Federal Authorities, per ND 47, \n                         from which we removed the implement, \n                         fingerprints intact.\n\n               Crime-scene video streams in now stenciled FBI by the \n               time/date). A handheld camera pans a blood-spattered wall \n               then shows a mutilated Asian murder victim. (All of this \n               footage is made even eerier by the jerky glitches always \n               present in streaming video, and its sinister graininess.)\n\n                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR\n                         FBI footage, procured by ND 47, shows \n                         the aftermath of an Aryan Nations' \n                         killing in Denver. Note the evidence \n                         of torture, which is typical.\n\n               Milo pales as he realizes he is watching a primer on how \n               racial killings are done.\n\n               He hears a creaking noise behind him, and whirls.\n\n               It's the classroom hamster, on his wheel.\n\n               INT. STAIRWELL/BOMB SHELTER - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Still whistling, Randy descends some metal stairs, enters a \n               vast bomb shelter (canned foods, etc.)\n\n               INT.

Milo's eyes narrow: \n               he sees video of Alice, sitting on a folding chair, speaking \n               to someone. She has a harder look, pulls on a Marlboro.\n\n               What's he seeing? He wiggles the jerry-rigged hardware almost \n               urgently, till the narration crackles back on:\n\n                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR\n                         -- Rebecca P, a Connecticut art stu- \n                         dent facing Federal drug charges, \n                         whose records were supplied to us by \n                         N.D. 47.\n\n               He hears her voice under the Narration, answering an unseen \n               Interrogator (sounds like Phil). It's a job interview. Milo \n               subtly, unconsciously shakes his head, as if to deny what \n               his eyes see. The narration begins to fibrillate, again:\n\n                                     MULTIMEDIA NARRATOR (O.S.)\n                         Armed with his personal files, she \n                         was easily able to ingratiate herself \n                         with the socially maladroit Milo --\n\n               The audio drops out as Milo sees uploaded medical files and \n               ER photos of himself marked STANFORD MEDICAL CENTER: he's \n               waxen, bloated, gasping for breath.

BARTON'S OUTER OFFICE - MORNING\n\n               Milo sits on a wooden bench, foot tapping. Hearing Barton's \n               voice, he comes to his feet.

He takes comfort in their solidity: \n               pictures of Barton's teenage Kids, Barton and Wife at the \n               Grand Canyon. There's a college football photo, a young Barton \n               with his team. Milo studies it, smiles. Move in on the photo, \n               till we see the number on Barton's Notre Dame football jersey: \n               ND 47.\n\n               Milo's smile fades.

[It's not necessary for us to understand what she's \n               saying, just so Milo does.] She holds up an audio copy of \n               Gary's book, The Next Highway.\n\n                                     LISA\n                         Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: \n                         they'll play against any of the images \n                         you described.\n\n                                     MILO\n                         Perfect.\n                              (something preys on \n                              his mind)\n                         How am I gonna get away from the \n                         party long enough to --\n\n                                     LISA\n                         You could always say you have to go \n                         the bathroom.\n\n                                     MILO\n                         That's lame, isn't it?\n\n                                     LISA\n                         You'll come up with something.\n\n               He already looks nervous. We begin to hear live music.\n\n               EXT. GARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The music echoes from inside. Push past a line of cars and \n               limousines in the lit-up drive, Milo's car at the head of \n               it.\n\n               Milo and Alice get out. As they go inside, she pulls a tag \n               from the sleeve of his just-bought dinner jacket.\n\n               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS\n\n               As Milo and Alice enter, he sees a Balthus painting re-\n               digitize to a Mondrian.\n\n                                     ALICE\n                         They called the house to ask who's \n                         your favorite painter.\n\n               Alice smiles, Milo forces a smile: it'll be even harder to \n               sneak away, now.\n\n               They pass a doorway where a Houseman stands, to keep guests \n               from entering residential rooms (the ones Milo must pass \n               through to get to Gary's workroom). A Guy in a pretentiously \n               hip tux tries to peek in.\n\n                                     HOUSEMAN\n                         Sorry, Sir, this part of the residence \n                         is restricted.\n\n               Milo looks a little more tense...\n\n               PARTY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\n\n               The room is full of people. A long windowed wall has been \n               opened onto a lakeside terrace, where more Guests drink and \n               chat, and an orchestra plays.\n\n               A giant Mondrian digitizes on the wall: the world's largest \n               ID card. Milo sinks a little more.\n\n               Across the room, Gary, his Wife (a blandly pretty blond) and \n               two Men are grouped around a Monet set on an antique easel \n               (thus clearly the real thing; Mrs. Boyd has prevailed.) Gary \n               notices the giant digital Mondrian.\n\n               MILO takes two flutes of champagnes off a tray. He hands one \n               to Alice as Gary et. al. approach.\n\n                                     GARY\n                         Alice, I'm Gary.

He moves away \n               from us, enters the\n\n               ENTRANCE HALL\n\n               speaks to the Houseman who guards the residential rooms.\n\n                                     HOUSEMAN\n                         You'll have to use one over there.\n\n               He indicates an area on Milo's side of the door.\n\n                                     MILO\n                         There's like eight women waiting in \n                         line.

As the Houseman \n               watches, Milo goes into the\n\n               BATHROOM\n\n               He stands there a moment, breathes deeply. He cracks open \n               the door. The Houseman is turning away another Guest; Milo \n               makes his move.\n\n               DEN-LIKE ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Looking over his shoulder, Milo hurries to a door at the far \n               end of the room, silently cursing the Mondrian that inevitably \n               appears.\n\n               The Houseman looks over his shoulder, sees the closed bathroom \n               door, assumes Milo's still inside.\n\n               INT. PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Gary chats with his guests. Alice looks up at the digital \n               art, now a Bosch again.\n\n               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Milo walks fast. As he passes from one room to next, he sees \n               a Mondrian: he's been in this room. All the austere, \n               tastefully decorated rooms are blending together.\n\n               He stands in the center of the room making quarter turns. \n               Through each of four (open) doorways he sees a perfectly-\n               appointed \"den,\" the ultimate expression of bland, rich, \n               professionally-decorated taste.\n\n               He's lost.\n\n               He starts into one room -- backs up -- goes into another.\n\n               INT. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS\n\n               The Houseman looks over his shoulder again. He sees the \n               Mondrian and, in the room beyond that, another Mondrian.\n\n               He moves to the bathroom door, knocks on it. Opens it. He \n               pulls a sleek walkie-talkie from his jacket.\n\n               INT. ANOTHER DEN - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Milo, still lost, is getting frantic. He doubles back, cuts \n               toward another wing of the house. Through an open doorway he \n               sees:\n\n               A young, chillingly calm NANNY, watching him. The Baby fusses \n               in her arms. Milo smiles, keeps moving.\n\n               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - A DEN - CONTINUOUS\n\n               A Second Houseman follows the trail of Mondrians. He sees \n               Mondrians in two different directions. He hesitates, picks a \n               direction, keeps moving.\n\n               INT. PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n               The first Houseman moves through the Guests, toward Gary.\n\n               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Milo has finally made it. Sitting at Gary's work station, he \n               slips a CD-ROM into the PC. It floods with text. The music \n               echoes from far off. The entire wall behind him is filled \n               with a Mondrian.\n\n               INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n               As Linder chats, the first Houseman sidles up to Gary, \n               whispers in his ear. We see Gary smile, excuse himself. He \n               and Alice share a look as he moves off.\n\n               We go with Gary. His smiles fades instantly. He pushes through \n               Guests, who thank him for hosting such a brilliant \"do;\" he \n               hardly hears them.\n\n               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Milo writes frantically on his tiny pad, copying from the PC \n               screen:\n\n               LONGITUDE - 77 Degrees 03 Minutes 58 Seconds East\n\n               LATITUDE - 38 Degrees 55 Minutes 14 Seconds South\n\n               ALTITUDE - 426 MILES\n\n               He flips the page, begins entering the fixes for the next \n               satellite. Thinking he's heard something, he looks up.\n\n               Nobody's there.\n\n               INT. ANOTHER DEN - CONTINUOUS\n\n               The Second Houseman turns in several directions, confused by \n               the trail of Mondrians. Passing into the next room, he runs \n               into a Third Houseman, also confused. Each follows a different \n               Mondrian, in a different room.\n\n               INT. GARY'S HOUSE - A DEN - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Unlike the Housemen, Gary doesn't follow the paintings. He \n               moves swiftly, seems to know where Milo is.\n\n               GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Milo still working...\n\n               PARTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Alice looks up at the digital painting: still a Bosch. Her \n               face sets grimly.\n\n               INT. GARY'S WORKROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Milo clicks, closing the window. Concentrating, he doesn't \n               see what we see on the wall behind him: the Mondrian drains \n               away... And the wall fills up with the hellish Bosch triptych.\n\n               After a moment, Milo senses something.\n\n               Gary stands in the doorway. Watching him. Milo doesn't \n               breathe. Gary crosses the room, eyes locked with Milo's.\n\n               Gary comes behind Milo. He reads the screen. It's filled \n               with text, whatever Milo loaded in when he sat down.\n\n                                     GARY\n                              (reading the screen)\n                         \"Dear Lisa.

Accepting Winston's offer, Hoffman and his girlfriend, Alice Poulson, move to NURV headquarters in Portland, Oregon.\nDespite development of the flagship product (Synapse, a worldwide media distribution network) being well on schedule, Hoffman soon becomes suspicious of the excellent source code Winston personally provides to him, seemingly when needed most, while refusing to divulge the code's origin.\nAfter his best friend, Teddy Chin, is murdered, Hoffman discovers that NURV is stealing the code they need from programmers around the world\u2014including Chin\u2014and then killing them to cover their tracks. Hoffman learns that not only does NURV employ an extensive surveillance system to observe and steal code, the company has infiltrated the Justice Department and most of the mainstream media. Even his girlfriend is a plant, an ex-con hired by the company to manipulate him.\nWhile searching through a secret NURV database containing surveillance dossiers on employees, he finds that the company has information of a very personal nature about a friend and co-worker, Lisa Calighan. When he reveals to her that the company has this information, she agrees to help him expose NURV's crimes to the world. Coordinating with Brian Bissel, one of Hoffman's friends from his old startup, they plan to use a local public-access television station to hijack Synapse and broadcast their charges against NURV to the world. However, Calighan turns out to be a double agent, foils Hoffman's plan, and turns him over to Winston.\nHoffman had already confronted Poulson and convinced her to side with him against Winston and NURV. When it became clear that Hoffman had not succeeded, a backup plan is put into motion by Poulson, the fourth member of Skullbocks, and the incorruptible internal security firm hired by NURV. As Winston prepares to kill Hoffman, the second team successfully usurps one of NURV's own work centers\u2014\"Building 21\"\u2014and transmits the incriminating evidence as well as the Synapse code. Calighan, Winston and his entourage are publicly arrested for their crimes. After parting ways with the redeemed Poulson, Hoffman rejoins Skullbocks."}

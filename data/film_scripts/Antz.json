AN ANT MOUND - DAY\n\n     The camera swoops towards the entrance, then dives inside,\n     past a couple of tough-looking soldier ants who stand at the\n     gates of the ant colony like insect bouncers...into an access\n     tunnel that snakes this way and that, past a row of ants\n     plodding along...\n\n     ...and into the MAIN CHAMBER of the colony, a huge, teeming\n     vista that seems to stretch away forever, filled with ants\n     rushing here and there on their business.  We see -- a\n     \"traffic cop\" directing foot traffic, waving his arms like\n     crazy so both sides move at once -- a column of soldier ants\n     marching along in formation -- a chain of ants letting down\n     a matchbox elevator filled with workers.\n\n                         Z (V.O.)\n               ...which is kind of a problem, since\n               I've always felt uncomfortably in\n               crowds.\n\n     INT. MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     We join Z, a worker ant with issues.  He's lying on a couch,\n     recounting his woes.\n\n                         Z\n               I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've\n               got abandonment issues.  My father\n               flew away when I was just a larva.\n               My mother didn't have much time for\n               me...when you have five million\n               siblings, it's difficult to get\n               attention.\n                      (pause)\n               I feel physically inadequate -- I've\n               never been able to lift more than ten\n               times my own weight.  Sometimes I\n               think I'm just not cut out to be a\n               worker.  But I don't have any other\n               options.  I was assigned to trade\n               school when I was just a grub.  The\n               whole system just...makes me\n               feel...insignificant.\n\n                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR\n                      (enthusiastic)\n               Terrific!  You should feel\n               insignificant!\n\n     For the first time, we see the ant MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR.\n     He's a mixture of Tony Robbins and Ron Popiel (the\n     hyperactive late-night TV huckster, and founder of \"Ronco\").\n\n                         Z\n               ...I should?\n\n                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR\n                      (hopping around\n                       enthusiastically)\n               YES!!!  You know, people ask me,\n               \"Doctor, why are you always happy?\"\n               And I tell them it's mind over\n               matter.  I don't mind that I don't\n               matter!  Do you get it?  Do you get\n               it?\n\n     Z gives a fake smile.\n\n                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR\n                      (incredibly \"up\")\n               Z, we're part of the fastest growing\n               species in the whole world!\n\n     The counsellor rolls down a chart from the wall.  An arrow\n     shows ant population going up, up, up.\n\n                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR\n               Ask me why we're so successful.\n\n                         Z\n               Why are we so successful?\n\n                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR\n               I'm glad you asked me that question!\n\n     The motivational counsellor opens some blinds...and we see a\n     vista of the ant-filled chamber below.\n\n                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR\n               What do you see out there?\n\n                         Z\n               ...Ants...\n\n                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR\n               Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures,\n               each with his assigned task, all\n               pulling together!\n\n     Down below, we see a group of ants carrying a boulder up an\n     incline.  One worker ants slips, and the boulder rolls down,\n     crushing his leg.  The other ants rush over -- it looks like\n     they're going to help their fallen comrade, but instead, they\n     climb right over him, and pick up the boulder, continuing\n     with their task.\n\n                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR\n               You see?  Being an ant is being able\n               to say, \"Hey -- I'm meaningless,\n               you're meaningless.\"\n\n                         Z\n               But -- but I've always felt life was\n               about finding meaning...and then\n               sharing it with someone special,\n               someone you love.\n\n     The motivational counsellor puts his arm on Z's shoulder...he\n     seems to understand...\n\n                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR\n               Z...you need help.\n                      (looking at a clock)\n               Whoops!  We're gonna have to stop\n               there.  Your minute is up!\n\n     The counsellor ushers Z out of his seat and towards the door.\n\n                         MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR\n               Now back to work!  We've made real\n               progress!  Remember -- let's be\n               best superorganism we can be!\n\n     INT. EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY\n\n     A gigantic tunnel, with the size and scale of the \"Chunnel\".\n     A banner strung overhead reads: \"The Mega-Tunnel -- Tunneling\n     Our Way to a Bright Future!\"  Along the walls hang 50's work-\n     incentive style posters with messages like, \"You asked for\n     it, you got it -- more work!\" and \"TWO MEALS A WEEK IS\n     ENOUGH!!!\"  Line after line of ants is working on the tunnel,\n     digging, passing clumps of dirt from ant to ant, everyone\n     synchronized.\n\n     CLOSE on a clump of DIRT being passed from hand to hand.\n     PULL OUT TO REVEAL\n\n     AZTECA, a feisty, cynical, female worker ant, who stands\n     there, waiting to pass the dirt on.  Z is daydreaming behind\n     her, with clumps of dirt starting to pile up in front of him.\n\n                         AZTECA\n               Hello?!  Earth to Z!  You better snap\n               out of it, or there's gonna be a lot\n               of pissed off ants!\n\n     Z looks back, and sees the ants behind staring at him angrily.\n\n                         Z\n                      (snapping out of it)\n               Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas!\n               Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!\n                      (looking at the dirt)\n               Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I\n               mean this dirt is very...dirty.\n               Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?\n                      (Z's stomach growls)\n               Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm\n               seeing double.  It looks like there's\n               two million ants in here.  When's\n               lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?\n\n                         AZTECA\n                      (sweetly)\n               Z, old pal...\n                      (shouts)\n               SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's\n               a food shortage without you\n               complaining about it every day.\n\n                         Z\n               The squeaky wheel gets the oil.\n\n                         AZTECA\n               No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets thrown\n               away, alright?  You're a good ant, Z,\n               even though you are a pain in my rear-\n               segment.  I don't wanna see\n               anything happen to you.  So quit\n               mouthing off, before you get in\n               trouble.\n\n     A WHISTLE BLOWS.\n\n                         Z\n               Thank goodness.  Breaktime.\n\n     All the ants put down their tools.  A beat.  Then the WHISTLE\n     BLOWS AGAIN.  All the ants pick up their tools again.\n\n                         AZTECA\n                      (resigned)\n               Break's over.\n\n                         Z\n                      (getting back to work)\n               This colony needs another tunnel like\n               a hole in the ground.  Why are we\n               even digging this thing?\n\n                         AZTECA\n               Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we\n               gotta dig.  We're not the ones in\n               charge.\n\n     INT. TOWN CENTER - DAY\n\n     The huge, spacious main chamber of the colony.  Looming over\n     the scene is the royal palace, which seems to be\n     inaccessible, perched on top of a hill-like pedestal.\n\n     Around the base of the pedestal, a crew of workers loiters,\n     seemingly aimlessly...can these be the only unemployed ants\n     in the place?\n\n                         GENERAL FORMICA\n               STAIRS!\n\n     The workers look up and GROAN.  Then they start forming a\n     stairway with their own bodies, linking arms, stepping on\n     each other's shoulders.  It's extremely unpleasant work.  One\n     ant is a little tardy, and just manages to get in place\n     before...\n\n     GENERAL FORMICA, the Pattonesque military leader of the\n     colony, STEPS ON HIS HEAD, using it as the first step as he\n     ascends to the palace, his aide-de-camp Carpenter in tow.  As\n     Formica mounts the \"stairs\"  we can hear the workers going,\n     \"OUCH!  OOF!  YIKES!\" etc.\n\n                         GENERAL FORMICA\n               Cut the chit-chat down there!\n                      (turning to Carpenter)\n               We've spoiled these workers,\n               Carpenter.  They've never had it so\n               good, and listen to them -- always\n               grumbling and complaining...\n\n     Formica steps on the foot of one of the \"stairway\" ants, who\n     muffles a yelp.\n\n                         CARPENTER\n               ...Yes, sir.\n\n                         GENERAL FORMICA\n               What have they got to complain about?\n               Three square meals a day...\n\n                         CARPENTER\n               Actually, sir, we've cut them down to\n               three roughly rectangular meals a\n               week.\n\n                         FORMICA\n               Don't give me statistics, Carpenter.\n               I know what I'm talking about.  DOORS!\n\n     Formica and Carpenter have reached the top of the staircase.\n     There, the two guard ants on either side of the massive\n     throne room doors pull them open -- and one door hinge\n     SQUEAKS.\n\n                         FORMICA\n                      (to guard ant, while\n                       passing)\n               Oil that, soldier.\n\n     INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY\n\n     The QUEEN is on her throne, her huge abdomen sprawled behind\n     her.\n\n                         QUEEN\n               Ah!  General Formica.\n\n     Formica salutes and marches to her, Carpenter behind him.\n\n     Note:  Throughout this scene, the Queen is giving birth\n     repeatedly.  Each birth is accompanied by a herald playing a\n     short \"Happy Birthday\" fanfare on his trumpet.  Mid-wife ants\n     bring each baby to the Queen for inspection, who COOS a few\n     words.  The midwives put the babies on a moving bassinet-\n     line, powered by ants on a treadmill.\n\n                         QUEEN\n               General, the severe food shortage\n               that faces the colony...pains me.\n               The thought of any of my children\n               going hungry...\n                      (she shudders; then,\n                       to baby)\n               Who's the cutest widdle worker?

BALA'S QUARTERS - DAY\n\n     Bala enters, followed by her handmaidens, who are in a state\n     of giggling infatuation over Formica.

How could anything be wrong?\n               I'm going to marry General Formica\n               and be a queen and have millions of\n               babies, just like my mom.\n                      (concerned)\n               Do I look fat to you?\n\n                         HANDMAIDEN #2\n                      (knowingly, to\n                       Handmaiden #2)\n               Pre-wedding jitters.\n\n                         HANDMAIDEN #1\n               You just need to blow off some steam.\n               Let's go to the bar at the Royal Club!\n\n                         BALA\n               The Club's so stuffy.

Yes!  That's where\n               I want to go!\n\n     The handmaidens look shocked.\n\n                         HANDMAIDEN #1\n               But -- we can't -- there'll be\n               workers there.\n\n     INT. ANT BAR - NIGHT\n\n     A long bar filled with ants.  The bar itself seems to stretch\n     for miles, and there are hundreds of ants trying to get a\n     drink...unfortunately, there's only one bartender.  Z is at\n     the bar with WEAVER, a burly ant soldier.\n\n                         Z\n               We declared war again?\n                      (off Weaver's nod)\n               Are you scared?\n\n                         WEAVER\n                      (shrugs)\n               I'll be back.\n\n     The BARTENDER, a grizzled veteran, slaps down what looks like\n     a couple of large green beer mugs.  Actually, they're aphids,\n     little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs\n     hanging from the ceiling.  The kegs are specialized ants with\n     hugely distended stomachs, which spray liquid into the aphids.\n\n                         APHIDS\n                      (as they're slapped\n                       on bar)\n               Ouch!  Ouch!\n\n                         BARTENDER\n               Two aphid beers.\n\n                         Z\n                      (as Bartender leaves)\n               Did you see that?  How he gave you\n               the beers, not me?  I'm telling you,\n               he's got something against workers.\n\n                         WEAVER\n               I don't know what you're talking\n               about, Z.\n\n                         Z\n               Come on -- everybody dumps on us\n               workers.  You soldiers get all the\n               glory.  Plus you get to go out into\n               the world, meet interesting insects,\n               and kill them.\n\n                         WEAVER\n               Yeah, but you get to spend all day\n               with those fabulous worker babes.\n\n     We can see that Weaver is eyeing a nearby table of \"Worker\n     Babes\", including Z's friend Azteca.\n\n                         Z\n               Weaver, they're career girls.\n               They're obsessed with digging.\n                      (sighs)\n               No, I'll probably never meet the girl\n               for me.\n\n                         WEAVER\n               Who said there was a girl for you?\n               I was talking about a girl for me.\n                      (quaffing his aphid\n                       beer)\n               Don't you want your aphid beer?\n\n                         Z\n               I can't help it.  I have a thing\n               about drinking from the anus of\n               another creature.  Call me crazy.\n\n                         WEAVER\n               Z, we've known each other a long\n               time, right?\n\n                         Z\n               Of course.  You were born two seconds\n               after me.\n\n                         WEAVER\n               And all the time I've known you,\n               you've been grumping and groaning.\n               You should quit making waves.

A grizzled old SCOUT ant\n     has had too much to drink.\n\n                         DRUNK SCOUT\n               Have you been to Insectopia?  Have\n               you?  No, ya goddam larvas!

ANT BAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT\n\n     Princess Bala is peering in at the entrance to the ant bar,\n     accompanied by her worried-looking handmaidens.\n\n                         HANDMAIDEN #2\n               We shouldn't be doing this -- it\n               isn't proper!\n\n                         BALA\n               I'm the Princess, aren't I?\n\n                         HANDMAIDEN #2\n               Of course --\n\n                         BALA\n               And do Princesses do improper things?\n\n                         HANDMAIDEN #2\n               Of course not --\n\n                         BALA\n               Then if I go to the worker bar, it\n               isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry.\n               No one will recognize us in our\n               disguises.\n\n     She adjusts her \"disguise\", a hardhat, tied down Jackie O.-\n     style with an ant's version of a Chanel scarf.\n\n                         BALA\n               I'm just a common worker, cooling off\n               after a rough day!\n\n     Music starts.

Suavely grabs the candle in a\n     glass jar off the bar.  Suavely singes his face.\n\n     He plays it off with a rakish little laugh.  A bit\n     apprehensive, Bala heads onto the floor.  Z follows her.\n\n                         Z\n               So uh -- how come I haven't seen you\n               around here before?\n\n                         BALA\n                      (covering up)\n               I work in the palace, I don't get out\n               much.\n\n                         Z\n               The palace, hunh?

It's the blind\n     leading the blind, as Z tries in vain to follow the barker's\n     rapid instructions.\n\n                         Z\n               Here, I'll lead.\n\n     Z starts doing his own, individual dance.  With a suave\n     expression on his face, he leads Bala in a helter-skelter\n     mixture-of Tango, Charleston, and hand-jive.\n\n                         BALA\n               Are you sure this is a real dance?\n\n                         Z\n               Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of\n               making it up --\n\n                         BALA\n                      (surprised)\n               Really?\n\n                         Z\n               Why should everyone dance the same\n               way?  It's as exciting as watching\n               fungus grow.\n\n                         BALA\n               You're right!\n\n                         Z\n                      (surprised)\n               You -- you think I'm right?\n\n                         BALA\n               Why can't I just do whatever I want\n               to do?  Why can't I just go wild?!\n               Yahoo!\n\n     Bala starts to get into it, making up her own steps in reply\n     to Z's, loosening up, having fun.  For a moment, the two of\n     them are actually sexy together.  Then they get a little too\n     wild -- and the other ants, who are still doing their\n     intricate dance, start to collide with Bala and Z.  Z almost\n     knocks over a big soldier ant.  We can only see the ant's\n     back at the moment.\n\n                         SOLDIER\n               Hey!  Watch your step, worker.\n\n     Z has turned around to see the soldier ant, MAJOR MANDIBLE,\n     glaring at him.  Mandible is about twice Z's size.  He's got\n     one eye missing, and half of his left antenna his been chewed\n     off.\n\n                         BALA\n               You watch yours, soldier, or my\n               worker friend will beat you up!\n\n                         Z\n                      (terrified)\n               Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off\n               this time.\n                      (whispering to Bala)\n               Are you crazy?  This guy's built like\n               a pebble!\n                      (ineptly trying to\n                       placate the soldier)\n               You know they do great prosthetic\n               antennas nowadays --\n\n                         BALA\n               Aren't you gonna stand up for\n               yourself?\n\n     Z's caught between a rock and a hard place.  He doesn't want\n     to get beaten up, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to\n     lose face in front of Bala.  More soldiers have gathered\n     around, looking hostile.\n\n                         SOLDIER\n               How come you don't dance like the\n               rest of us?\n\n     Z glances over at Bala.  Then, shaking with nervousness, he\n     says defiantly...\n\n                         Z\n               Because -- because I'm an individual!\n\n                         SOLDIER #2\n               An individual?  Never heard of it.\n\n                         MANDIBLE\n               You look like a worker to me.\n\n                         WEAVER\n               Hey, lay off my little buddy!\n\n     Z, meanwhile, looks far away, ecstatic, as if he's just\n     realized something very important.  Unfortunately, just at\n     this moment, A soldier pushes Weaver...Weaver pushes him\n     back...somebody makes a dive for Z -- and before you know it,\n     there's a regular bar brawl going on, with Weaver in the\n     middle of it, cracking heads together, punching ants in the\n     face, having a great time.  Just then, the Princess'\n     handmaidens hurries over.\n\n                         HANDMAIDEN #1\n               Princess Bala!  Princess Bala!\n\n     Z, who's scrabbling around on the floor, overhears.\n\n                         Z\n               Princess?  You're a Princess?\n\n                         HANDMAIDEN #2\n               The police are coming!\n\n                         BALA\n               Uh oh.\n                      (to Z)\n               Goodbye!  Gotta run!\n\n                         Z\n               Wait!  When can I see you again?\n\n                         BALA\n               Let me think.  Hmmnn...\n                      (thinks)\n               Never.  Bye!\n\n     Bala rushes off with her handmaiden, just before a squad of\n     whistle-blowing POLICE wade into the crowd.\n\n                         Z\n               Wait!  Princess!  Wait!\n\n     But she's already gone, leaving Z holding her scarf.\n\n                                              CUT TO:\n\n     INT. DORMITORY - THE NEXT DAY\n\n     Z is talking to Weaver, who's getting ready to go off to war.\n     Nearby, columns of ant soldiers march by.\n\n                         WEAVER\n               Get real, Z!  She just dropped the\n               scarf by accident!\n\n                         Z\n               Are you kidding?  There were sparks\n               between us!  This scarf is a sign!\n\n                         WEAVER\n               It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do\n               you know what the penalty for\n               impersonating a soldier is?\n\n                         Z\n               What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your\n               place for the royal inspection.  Bala\n               comes strolling down the line, she\n               sees me -- bingo!  Love is rekindled,\n               and she takes me up to the palace for\n               a little...\n                      (wags his eyebrows\n                       suggestively)\n               tea and crumpets... and you take your\n               place again, and go march around to\n               your heart's content!\n\n     Weaver looks unconvinced.\n\n                         Z\n               You have to help me.

I owe you!\n\n     Z skips off and joins the column, marching in time with the\n     soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little.\n\n     INT. TOWN CENTER - NIGHT\n\n     The ant army has gathered in a huge HALL in front of a\n     reviewing stand.  We can hear the murmuring of thousands of\n     soldiers -- but all we can see is a HUGE POSTER of an ant\n     General pointing right at the camera.  The poster reads,\n     \"GENERAL FORMICA WANTS YOU -- to obey\".\n\n     Z turns to some of the soldiers near him.\n\n                         Z\n               Any of you guys know when the\n               Princess will show up?  She's kind of\n               a personal friend.\n\n     The soldiers look at Z like he's nuts.\n\n                         LOUD VOICE\n               ATTEN-SHUN!\n\n     MARTIAL MUSIC sounds, and we hear thousands of ant feet as\n     they snap to attention.  Z imitates the soldiers awkwardly.\n\n     GENERAL FORMICA struts to the middle 6f the screen, slapping\n     his thigh with a swagger stick (the antenna of some\n     unfortunate insect)\n\n                         FORMICA\n               First of all, let me make one thing\n               clear.  Nobody ever won a battle by\n               thinking for himself.  All this\n               \"thinking\" stuff is a load of crap.\n               If the almighty had wanted you boys\n               to think, he wouldn't have given you\n               huge mandibles and a brain so small\n               you'd misplace it if it wasn't\n               trapped inside your head.\n\n     In the audience, Z starts laughing -- he thinks Formica's\n     just made a joke.\n\n                         Z\n                      (slapping his thigh)\n               \"Trapped inside your head\" -- that's\n               a good one --\n\n     Z notices nobody else is laughing.  He stops.\n\n                         Z\n               Geez -- tough room.\n\n     From the stage, Formica is squinting at the audience, trying\n     to make out who was laughing, but there are just too many\n     ants.  He continues.\n\n                         FORMICA\n                      (striding back and\n                       forth)\n               We ants survive as a species because\n               we do what we're told.  We survive\n               because we work together, as one, we\n               get the job done, we do whatever it\n               takes to persevere!\n                      (dramatic pause)\n               Hell, we're not an army of\n               ants...we're one giant ant, with\n               giant fists, and giant jaws!\n\n     The soldiers CHEER!  Z CHEERS along with the rest of them.\n\n                         Z\n                      (to the soldier ant\n                       next to him)\n               Lays it on a little thick, doesn't\n               he?  If you ask me, he's one giant\n               bore.\n\n                         FORMICA\n               Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt\n               about a food shortage.  Well you boys\n               are gonna be taken care of.  But in\n               the meantime we're gonna eat the\n               enemy for breakfast, we are gonna\n               eat the enemy for lunch, and we are\n               gonna eat the enemy for dinner!\n\n                         Z\n               Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.\n\n                         FORMICA\n                      (reflective moment)\n               Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.\n                      (he looks out at his\n                       army)\n               And I know each and every one of you\n               boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.\n\n     Z applauds and whistles as the other ants look at him in\n     confusion.\n\n                         Z\n                      (clapping)\n               Bravo!  Bring on the Princess!\n\n                         COLONEL\n               Stow the gab there, soldier!  Let's\n               move 'em out!\n\n     The soldiers turn to the right and start to march out past\n     the reviewing stand.\n\n     A COLONEL marches at the head of Z's column as Z looks around\n     for the Princess.\n\n                         COLONEL\n               Eyes...left!\n\n     Finally, as Z's part of the army marches past the end of the\n     reviewing stand, he sees her, looking bored, standing next\n     to the Queen, who is giving the royal wave.\n\n                         Z\n                      (waving)\n               Princess!  Princess Bala!  Hey!  It's\n               me!  Z!  I've got your scarf!\n\n     ON THE REVIEWING STAND, Bala sees Z -- that is to say, she\n     sees one of the thousands upon thousands of ants marching\n     by...\n\n                         BALA\n                      (peering out)\n               Who is that idiot?\n\n                         QUEEN\n               Darling, you must encourage the\n               troops -- wave!\n\n     Bala waves unenthusiastically, little more than flopping her\n     hand back and forth on her wrist.\n\n     Down below, Z takes this as a sign that Bala has seen him.\n\n                         Z\n                      (excited)\n               Excuse me, guys -- That's my date.\n               Well, it's been fun.  Have a great\n               war!\n\n     Z tries to squeeze his way back towards the royals, but he's\n     surrounded by a solid wall of soldiers -- and they're\n     carrying him along with them.\n\n                         Z\n               Hey!  Wait!\n\n     Z loses sight of the Princess as he's carried away.\n     BARBATUS, a hard-as-nails \"grunt\" soldier ant, taps Z on the\n     shoulder.\n\n                         BARBATUS\n               You new, kid?\n\n                         Z\n               I just joined up.  But I'm quitting!\n               I got a trial membership!\n\n                         BARBATUS\n               Trial membership?  Kid, when you join\n               this ant's army, you're in for the\n               full hitch.\n\n     At that moment, Z is swept out of the cramped corridor\n     they've been marching along, as the army emerges into the\n     OPEN AIR outside of the colony.\n\n     EXT. ANT MOUND - NIGHT\n\n     It's a starry, moonlit night.  The shadows crowd around the\n     panicked Z, who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the\n     march...\n\n                         Z\n               Wait a minute, there's been a\n               mistake!  I've got to get back to the\n               colony!\n\n     Z starts to fall out of line, but Barbatus, looking\n     concerned, stops him.\n\n                         BARBATUS\n               Are you crazy, kid?

TERRAIN NEAR TERMITE STUMP - NIGHT\n\n     Z looks up to see...looming high above them...the TERMITE\n     CITY, which is built in the stump of a dead tree.  From here\n     it looks like a demonic Mount Fuji.  The COLONEL ANT shouts\n     an order.\n\n                         COLONEL\n               ATTAAAAAAAAACK!!!\n\n     The front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite\n     colony...Z is swept along...\n\n                         BARBATUS\n               Over the TOOOOOOOOOOOOO-OP!!!\n\n     Z is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of\n     ants invade the colony through every possible entrance.\n     Up...over the lip of the stump...and down inside, to the very\n     middle of the termite colony...\n\n     Into a disquietingly peaceful scene.   They're in the middle\n     of the hollowed-out trunk, and ants keep pouring in -- but\n     there's not a termite to be seen.  Barbatus looks around\n     suspiciously.\n\n                         BARBATUS\n               It's too damn quiet.\n\n     Then we hear a strange tapping noise.  Barbatus looks over,\n     and sees that Z's teeth are chattering with fear.\n\n                         BARBATUS\n               Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's\n               got yer back.\n\n                         Z\n                      (petrified)\n               Maybe they went out for the evening.\n               Let's leave them a message and head\n               home.\n\n                         COLONEL\n                      (ignoring him)\n               Light it up!\n\n     A nearby soldier ant take a firefly out of his knapsack and\n     pinches him.  The firefly, yelling \"Yipe!  Yipe!  Yipe!\",\n     shoots into the air like a flare, lighting up the interior of\n     the stump with eery, shifting luminescence.\n\n     Then we notice, hollowed into the inside of the stump like\n     innumerable pockmarks, termite holes staring out upon the\n     stump...and, with an unearthly ROAR, we see the first of\n     hundreds of termites emerging to pour into the center of the\n     tree, right onto the ant army.\n\n                         COLONEL\n               They're here!!!\n\n                         BARBATUS\n                      (to Z)\n               Keep your head down!\n\n     Within moments, Z finds himself in the middle of a\n     BLOODBATH.  The ants have broken into the colony, but are\n     taking heavy losses from the gigantic, blind, acid-spewing\n     termites.  The battle scene is as sprawling and chaotic as\n     something out of Braveheart. In a few QUICK SHOTS from Z's\n     perspective, we see:\n\n     -- A squad of ants rushes towards a termite soldier, but are\n     literally melted into smoking heaps of flesh by a jet of acid\n     from its forehead...\n\n     -- A termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants and is\n     pulled to pieces with hideous ripping sounds...\n\n     -- Another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on one\n     and slowly crushes his head in his huge jaws...\n\n                         Z\n                      (looking around)\n               Guys!  Guys!  It isn't too late for\n               all of us to just talk this over!\n\n     Just then, a termite burst up from the ground and turns to\n     face Z.  Z is dwarfed by this hulking, roaring, drooling\n     monstrosity.\n\n                         Z\n               Wait!  Please!  Acid makes me come\n               out in spots!  -- Could I just say I\n               have always had the greatest respect\n               for your species?

Z, terrified, dives into the hole\n     that the huge termite made...\n\n     INT. TERMITE TUNNEL - NIGHT\n\n     ...and tumbles headlong into a corridor of the termite mound.\n     The corridors here are primitive, caveman-like, pocked with\n     jagged access holes.\n\n     No sooner has Z landed in the tunnel than a termite comes\n     burrowing out from one of the side walls, snapping at Z's\n     head.  Z just avoids getting decapitated, and digs straight\n     through the wall in order to escape...\n\n     INT. TERMITE QUEEN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT\n\n     ...straight into the hub of the entire termite complex -- the\n     Queen's chamber.  This is nothing like the civilized court of\n     the ant colony -- it's a huge, stinking, fetid dungeon whose\n     walls are held up by one massive (to Z) column of piled\n     stones.\n\n     The termite queen, a repulsive, slimy, squirming, foot-long\n     monster, is attended by a crew of diminutive, blind termite\n     nurses.  The queen turns to look Z right in the eye.\n\n                         Z\n               Excuse me.  I seem to be lost, and I\n               was wondering if you could give me --\n\n     Before Z can say, \"directions\", the queen gives out a\n     piercing, blood-curdling shriek.  The nurses start shrieking\n     too.\n\n                         Z\n                      (backing away)\n               I'll let myself out.\n\n     But the queen's shriek has summoned a soldier termite -- the\n     biggest one we've seen yet -- who is charging headlong at Z,\n     jaws snapping open and shut like huge scissors.\n\n                         Z\n                      (backing away)\n               Shoo! -- Torro!  Torro!\n\n     At the last moment, Z jumps out of the way -- and the termite\n     runs headfirst into the supporting column of the chamber.  As\n     if on a spring release, the termite's jaws clamp shut -- and\n     shatter the base of the column.  The walls of the room begin\n     to rumble...\n\n     The termite turns to eat Z...but is crushed by a stone\n     falling from the ceiling, which gives a final shudder and\n     collapses, raining earth and stones down on the queen.\n\n     As the walls of the chamber crumble, melees of ants and\n     termites pour into the room from the corridors around and\n     above...they keep struggling until...\n\n                         ANT OFFICER\n                      (points at Z)\n               He's killed their Queen!\n\n                         Z\n               Hey, I'm sorry, it was a mistake --\n\n                         ANT OFFICER\n               VICTORY!!!\n\n     We can see that the termite warriors, deprived of their\n     leader, are suddenly confused and directionless, easy prey\n     for the ants.\n\n                         Z\n                      (facetious)\n               This is terrific!

The ten or so ants standing directly below are\n     smashed by the tongue, which squirts out a spray of saliva\n     around the crater.  As quick as it appeared, the tongue\n     retracts, with a hideous SLUUURPING sound.  We can now see\n     the end of the snout of an ant-eater poking through a hole in\n     the ceiling high above...\n\n                         ANT OFFICER\n               INCOMING!\n\n     The tongue comes down again, smashing some more ants, whose\n     bodies are slurped up by the tongue...the ants scatter, but\n     to no avail, as the tongue comes smashing down again and\n     again...\n\n     Z heads into a side corridor as the tongue smashes down\n     again, barely missing him!\n\n     Z retreats along the corridor as the tongue searches for him,\n     across the tunnel from intersecting access-tunnels, getting\n     closer and closer to Z, dragging more and more screaming ants\n     and struggling termites...\n\n     ....Then the tongue disappears.  Silence.  Z wipes his brow...\n\n     And we hear a thunderous SNIFFING noise as the anteater\n     searches for more prey... and the tongue starts rumbling down\n     the corridor right towards Z, the tip squirming as it\n     ricochets along the walls!\n\n     Z gets up and runs, the tongue lapping towards him,\n     reminiscent of the stone sphere that nearly crushed Indiana\n     Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark!  The walls disintegrate\n     under the pressure of the tongue, which gets closer to\n     Z...closer...\n\n     ...and just misses him as Z tumbles out of the stump and down\n     to the ground...Z sits there, dazed, as we see the huge form\n     of the anteater withdraw its tongue and, with a final\n     contented burp, shuffle off into the distance.\n\n     EXT.

Z is nowhere to be seen.\n     Because she's on top of him.\n\n                         PRINCESS\n               This is thoroughly unacceptable!\n\n                         Z\n               You're telling me...\n\n     She gets up and runs back towards the colony entrance, where\n     soldiers are already issuing to get her...\n\n                         BALA\n               I'm coming!  I'm coming!\n\n     But...just as Bala'a about to be rescued...what looks like a\n     gigantic LASER BEAM sweeps along the rim of the colony,\n     sizzling the ground as it moves along...and IGNITES the lead\n     soldier into FLAMES!  Bala looks stunned.\n\n     Z watches in horror as another soldier ant is FRIED, and we\n     look up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNIFYING GLASS casting the\n     beam...we can just about make out the huge, grotesque figure\n     (a seven year old kid) holding it.\n\n     Bala, who has no idea what's really going on, turns from the\n     colony and runs the other way.\n\n                         BALA\n               I'm going!  I'm going'\n\n     ...unfortunately, this draws the fire of the laser, which\n     follows after her in what looks like a strafing run, SIZZLING\n     in her footsteps.\n\n     Z, who's running towards the princess, suddenly realizes that\n     he's running towards certain doom...and joins Bala in legging\n     it away from the colony; under a brown leaf, which bursts\n     into flames...between the redwood-like stalks of some\n     flowers...and finally into the relative safety of some\n     grass...where they throw themselves on the ground, exhausted.\n\n                                              CUT TO:\n\n     EXT. WEED CLUMP - DAY\n\n     Z and Bala dust themselves off.\n\n                         BALA\n               What was that thing?\n\n                         Z\n               How should I know?\n\n                         BALA\n               I order you to find out where we are!\n\n                         Z\n               Alright, alright, I'll try to get\n               directions from one of the locals.\n\n     Z tries to flag down some passing bees.\n\n                         Z\n               Excuse me, I --\n                      (it passes him by;\n                       he tries the next)\n               Pardon me --\n                      (same response)\n               And they call them social insects.\n\n                         BALA\n               Climb up that tree and get a better\n               view!\n\n     Bala points to a thin blade of grass.  Gingerly, Z tests the\n     grass and starts climbing up it...but his weight bends it, so\n     that he's lowered back to the ground, face to upside-down\n     face with Bala.\n\n                         BALA\n               I've been kidnapped by the village\n               idiot.\n\n                         Z\n               Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot\n               who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who\n               lets herself get kidnapped by the\n               idiot?\n\n                         BALA\n               How dare you speak to me like that?\n               I'm the Princess!\n\n     Z squares up with her.\n\n                         Z\n               Theoretically, yes.  But is the\n               monarchical hierarchy applicable\n               without the underlying social\n               structure to support it?\n\n                         BALA\n               Of course!  It defines society!  To\n               deny the precept is to say that order\n               is an arbitrary distinction applied\n               by the society itself!\n\n                         Z\n               But can there be a society composed\n               of just two ants?\n\n                         BALA\n               No!  There's no such thing as \"just\n               two ants.\"  You never see just two\n               ants -- you see a million ants!\n\n                         Z\n               Look around, sweetheart.\n\n     She looks around.  She doesn't like what she sees.  She\n     glowers at Z.\n\n                         BALA\n               I -- hate -- you.\n\n                         Z\n               Well I guess that makes us even.\n\n                         BALA\n               Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're\n               crazy about me!  That's why you lied\n               and cheated to get near me!\n\n                         Z\n               Oh come on, you're the one who came\n               after me -- the swarthy, earthy,\n               sensual worker!\n\n                         BALA\n                      (repulsed)\n               I was slumming it!  I danced with you\n               because you were the most pathetic\n               specimen in the place!\n\n                         Z\n               Is that the same standard you used to\n               choose General Formica?\n\n                         BALA\n               I didn't choose him.  What kind  of\n               idiot would...\n                      (unconvincingly)\n               ...choose who she wanted to marry?\n\n     She shakes herself out of it.\n\n                         BALA\n               Now, worker, you shall take me back\n               to the colony, and have your head cut\n               off and stuck on a sharp pole!\n\n                         Z\n               Well, that's an appealing offer,\n               but...considering the options...\n                      (he decides)\n               You go back.

You stupid worker,\n               that's just a fairy tale!\n\n                         Z\n               Yeah, well I have it on a reliable\n               source...\n                      (he knows that was\n                       maybe stretching it)\n               that it exists.

That's just a\n               letter!\n\n     Z, meanwhile, hits the road.  Bala has no idea of where to\n     go.  Just then, the scariness of the outside world comes\n     through to her.\n\n     We start hearing NOISES -- the equivalent of scary jungle\n     sounds in a Tarzan movie -- the HISSING, CROAKING,\n     CHIRRUPING... Bala sees eyes looking out at her from all\n     directions...and spots a colossal monster (a sparrow) fixing\n     her with his beady gaze.\n\n                         BALA\n                      (clears her throat)\n               Worker?\n                      (no response...louder\n                       now)\n               Oh WORKER?  Where are you?\n                      (getting desperate)\n               Z?  Z?  Wait for me!!!\n\n     Bala heads off after Z.\n\n     INT. MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY\n\n     The mass of worker ants are swinging pick-axes in the tunnel.\n     The foreman moves up the line, BERATING the workers, yelling\n     at them to dig faster.\n\n                         AZTECA\n               I tell ya, I'm gettin' sick of bein'\n               yelled at.\n\n                         WORKER #1\n               What do you want, we're just workers.\n\n                         WEAVER\n               You know, you're not just workers --\n               you can be whatever you want to be!\n               Look at Z!  He started as a worker --\n               then he became a soldier!\n\n                         AZTECA\n               That's right!  He slaughtered\n               hundreds of termites single-handedly!\n\n                         WORKER #2\n               I heard about this guy.\n                      (turning to the other\n                       workers)\n               He crashed a party at the palace.\n               Then he took a hike with one of the\n               royal babes!  And when they tried to\n               stop him, he just looked at a\n               couple'a guards, and they burst into\n               flames!\n\n                         WORKER ANT #1\n               You're nuts, how could a worker do\n               all that?\n\n                         WEAVER\n               Well, because he's more than a\n               worker...he's a...what did he call\n               it, Azteca...\n\n                         AZTECA\n               Invisible!\n\n                         WEAVER\n               No -- an individual!\n\n                         WORKER #2\n               What's that?\n\n                         WEAVER\n               Well, it's...someone with his own\n               point of view...someone who does what\n               he wants, not whatever he's told to\n               do!\n\n                         AZTECA\n                      (eyes lit up,\n                       watching Weaver)\n               Someone who follows his heart!\n\n                         WEAVER\n                      (taking Azteca's hand)\n               Right...because every ant's important!\n\n                         WORKER #2\n                      (scoffs)\n               But that would mean I'm important.\n\n                         WORKER #1\n               I'm outta here, this sounds like\n               trouble to me.\n\n     But more ants are gathering 'round.\n\n                         WEAVER\n               We can all be individuals!  Just like\n               Z!\n\n     Weaver and Azteca hold hands.  More ants are gathering\n     around, dropping their tools...\n\n     EXT. BIKE PATH - DAY\n\n     LONG SHOT.  A glimmering desert landscape (think of \"The\n     Sun's Anvil\" in Lawrence of Arabia).  Two small figures can\n     be seen, tiny dots moving across the arid whiteness.\n\n     They're Bala and Z, who are crossing a concrete path in the\n     park, which they perceive to be a \"desert\".\n\n                         BALA\n               Water...water...\n\n                         Z\n               Water...water -- oh, you already said\n               that.\n\n                         BALA\n                      (walking along)\n               My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is\n               cracking...I wish I'd never met you,\n               you ruined my life.\n\n                         Z\n               I ruined your life?  Look, I was\n               perfectly happy until I met you --\n               alright, I was miserable, but I was\n               happily miserable.\n\n     Over Z's line, we can see a GIGANTIC WHEEL, getting larger\n     and larger and heading right towards them, a GIGANTIC WHEEL\n     (the front wheel of a bicycle which is heading right towards\n     them).\n\n                         BALA\n               Look out!\n\n     Bala pushes Z out of the way just as the wheel rolls past\n     with a cacophonous CRUNCHING, GRINDING noise -- like a\n     gigantic millwheel.\n\n                         BALA\n               We're going to die!\n\n                         Z\n               Come on -- it's gone!  What are the\n               chances of that happening again?\n\n     No sooner has he said it than the rear wheel of the bike\n     thunders past.\n\n                         Z\n               Well I'll be.\n\n     Bala notices that they're clutching one another in fear; she\n     pushes him away.\n\n                         BALA\n               Why didn't I listen to my mother\n               ...why'd I have to go looking for\n               trouble? Any ant would have given\n               their left legs to be in my\n               position...what's wrong with me?\n\n                         Z\n               Want a list?\n\n                         BALA\n                      (urgent)\n               Wait, I hear something!\n\n     We can, in fact, hear a low, musical PLUNK.. there's a pause\n     and then we can hear it again...\n\n     Z and Bala walk over a rocky \"dune\" (the soft shoulder of the\n     path).  Beyond, the grass starts up again.  They have come to\n     the end of the \"desert\" (i.e. the other side of the path)\n     Through the blades of grass, we can see...\n\n                         Z\n               It's...it's...\n\n\n                         BALA\n               WATER!!!\n\n     EXT. LAKE - DAY\n\n     A LAKE (a puddle) stretches before them.  It is, in fact, the\n     overflow of a drinking-fountain whose drain is jammed...as Z\n     and Bala run to the lake, water dribbles from the fountain\n     and into one edge of the pool (to the ants, it's a waterfall).\n\n     Bala and Z run to the edge of the water and start slurping.\n     They smile at each other, until they remember that they don't\n     like each other.\n\n                         Z\n               This lake is huge!  And so close to\n               the colony!  Think of the vacation\n               potential!\n\n                         BALA\n               Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take\n               a nap.\n\n                         Z\n               Listen, \"Princess\", you can't order\n               me around.  Out here, you're not the\n               boss anymore -- out here, you're\n               just --\n\n     -- But before he can finish, a water droplet from the\n     fountain falls on him.  It may not sound like much, but to Z\n     it's as though a ten-foot diameter sphere of jello had\n     engulfed him.\n\n     Z's stuck inside because of the surface tension of the\n     droplet, which doesn't burst, just quivers up and down.\n     Inside, Z is slowly, frantically drowning and screaming for\n     help.  But his screams are muffled in the water.\n\n                         BALA\n                      (annoyed)\n               Out here I'm just what?\n\n                         Z\n                      (through the water)\n               Hlllllllp!\n\n                         BALA\n                      (hands on hips)\n               Stop fooling around in there.\n\n     By now the droplet has started rolling, and Z is being turned\n     upside-down.  He manages to get one foreleg out of the\n     droplet, and, in a frantic attempt to pull himself out, pulls\n     Bala in by the leg.\n\n                         BALA\n               Let me go!!!\n\n     But it's too late -- they're now both stuck in the droplet,\n     and, as Z continues to drown, he also has to deal with Bala\n     yelling at him -- though we can't hear exactly what it. is\n     she's yelling through the water.\n\n     Then, having run out of air, she too starts thrashing,\n     alternately trying to swim and trying to slap him as Z tries\n     to defend himself.

She's\n     emerging from a tied off garbage bag -- the yellow ties loop\n     away gracefully.  Bala and Z have been tossed into a garbage\n     area.  And above them and below them, peering from garbage\n     cans, recycling containers, bags, etc., a multi-cultural\n     assortment of insects are regarding them.\n\n     A laid-back FLY voices their thoughts.\n\n                         FLY\n               What's with the bummer attitude?\n\n     A nearby BUTTERFLY joins in.\n\n                         BUTTERFLY\n               Yeah -- nobody stresses out in\n               Insectopia!\n\n                         BALA\n               Did you say...\n\n                         Z\n                      (joining Bala)\n               ...Insectopia?\n\n     Z and Bala look around.

Instead, we're looking at it through\n     ant eyes -- and, reimagined this way, it's Paradise.  Not the\n     ordered, sterile, paradise of the picnic, but an earthly land\n     of plenty.\n\n     The sides of the plastic garbage bags are sheer, reflective\n     walls of smoothest obsidian...the garbage cans are gigantic,\n     thick metal columns put there by the gods (think the\n     pyramids); a coke bottle, refracting the sunlight into a\n     gorgeous rainbow, trickles a fountain of sweet nectar into\n     the pink, bittersweet flesh of a grapefruit half, which\n     appears as a multi-chambered concave dome.  Everywhere,\n     insects are disporting themselves -- a multi- species love-in\n     that's like an insect version of Woodstock.\n\n     Bala and Z are awe-struck.

Some workers surround the Queen\n     to protect her.  All seems lost, when THE FLY from Insectopia\n     alights on the rim of the horizon.\n\n                         FLY\n               Hey, guys!\n\n     THE WASP appears on the other side of the horizon.\n\n                         WASP\n               It's them!\n\n     Suddenly, on all sides, A MASSIVE INSECT ARMY appears on the\n     ridge, looking not unlike ambushing Indians in a John Ford\n     film.  Formica's soldiers stop in their tracks, awed by the\n     unfolding spectacle.  It looks like all of Insectopia has\n     turned out: spiders, caterpillars, rhinoceros beetles, all\n     manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up, and\n     now surround the army, dwarfing them.\n\n                         WASP\n               Are these hooligans giving you\n               trouble, Z?\n\n                         FLY\n               Say the word, Z, and we kick their\n               butts.\n\n     The ant army remains frozen, unsure of what to do next.\n     Formica is furious.  If ants had veins, Formica's would be\n     bulging out of his face.\n\n                         FORMICA\n               What are you doing?!

With\n     his chin raised pridefully, Formica steps forward, and\n     CHARGES Z!\n\n                         FORMICA\n               AHHHHHHH!!\n\n     Formica runs so quickly and with such force that his helmet\n     blows off his head.  Z's eyes get big, he stumbles backwards,\n     slipping, and Formica goes flying over him, toward the\n     whirlpool behind.  He scrabbles at the edge of the water, and\n     then tumbles over.\n\n     For a moment, it looks as if he's gone.\n\n                         FORMICA (O.S.)\n               Help...help me...\n\n     Z goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over.  Formica\n     is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created,\n     which are roiling not far below.  He looks up into Z's eyes,\n     a new expression crossing his features: fear.\n\n                         FORMICA\n               Please...I...I can't swim...Help me...\n\n     Formica goes under for a bit, then his head comes up again --\n     but he's not going to be able to stay afloat for long...\n\n     Suddenly he sees a line dropped down.  Above, Z looks down on\n     him.\n\n                         Z\n               I thought you said that the life of\n               one ant doesn't matter.\n\n     Formica looks at the line...and in that moment seems to\n     realize his error...\n\n                         FORMICA\n               I guess it does...to the ant.\n\n     Formica reaches up and takes the line, and is pulled up by Z\n     and a bunch of other ants (the line, we see, extends from a\n     nearby spider, one of the cavalry from Insectopia).\n\n     Formica is left, broken and alone, by the precipice, while\n     HORDES OF ANTS surround Z to congratulate him.  Bala fights\n     her way to his side and the two of them embrace.  Then the\n     ants pick up Z and Bala, and, CHEERING, bear them away.\n\n     Only Carpenter stays behind.  He walks up to Formica,\n     carrying his dented and dusty helmet.  He cleans it the best\n     he can with his jacket sleeve and hands it to his fallen\n     general.\n\n                         CARPENTER\n               Sir, if it's any consolation, I still\n               think you're completely worthless as\n               an individual.\n\n                                              FADE TO:\n\n     CLOSE UP OF Z\n\n     As he addresses the audience, stand-up style.\n\n                         Z\n               So, uh, that's pretty much it.

I'm\n               more the specific type.\"  So they\n               gave the job to Weaver instead.\n\n                                              CUT TO:\n\n     WEAVER, in Formica's old office, in a general's uniform, his\n     feet up on Formica's desk, smoking a cigar.  Carpenter is on\n     his hands and knees scrubbing the floor.\n\n                         Z (V.O.)\n               Weaver cut the defense budget in\n               half.  Now we only have an army of\n               five million.\n\n     cut back to\n\n     Z, ADDRESSING THE AUDIENCE.\n\n                         Z\n               And me, I guess you could say that I\n               lived happily ever after.\n\n     Bala enters the frame, embraces and kisses him.\n\n                         Z\n               I mean, I've got the whole package,\n               right?  A great life, a beautiful\n               wife, and a few kids.\n\n                         BALA\n               A few?\n\n     WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\n     INT. Z'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Z and Bala stand in the midst of their living room, up to\n     their knees in THOUSANDS OF CHILD ANTS.  The children cover\n     every horizontal surface.  They run around, cry, laugh, and\n     tease each other.  Z looks around the room, looks back at us,\n     and shrugs.\n\n                         Z\n               Well, so nothing's perfect.  But you\n               know?  I wouldn't change a thing.\n\n     The camera pulls up...and away from the ground...to reveal\n     that this whole story has been taking place in a small area\n     of CENTRAL PARK.  We pull back and back, and see all the\n     familiar landmarks from the story: the bike path, the\n     drinking fountain, etc.  We tilt up into the NEW YORK\n     SKYLINE.  BIG MUSICAL FLOURISH.\n\n     FADE OUT.\n\n     THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntz\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Todd Alcott\u00a0\u00a0Chris Weitz\u00a0\u00a0Paul Weitz\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Animation\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb", "summary": "The setting for the story is an ant colony in Central Park in New York City. The protagonist is Z-4195 (Woody Allen), or \"Z\" for short, a neurotic and pessimistic worker ant living in a wholly totalitarian society who longs for the opportunity to truly express himself. His friends include fellow worker Azteca (Jennifer Lopez) and a soldier ant, Weaver (Sylvester Stallone). Z meets Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) at a bar where she goes to escape from her suffocating royal life and falls in love with her.\nTo see Bala again, Z exchanges places with Weaver and joins the army. He marches with the ranks, befriending a staff sergeant named Barbatus (Danny Glover) in the process. He is unaware that the army's leader and Bala's fianc\u00e9, General Mandible (Gene Hackman), is secretly sending all the soldiers loyal to the Queen to die so he can begin to build a colony filled with powerful ants. At the base of a tree near nightfall, Z realizes he is actually marching into battle, and all of the soldiers except for Z are killed by acid-shooting termites. Following the battle, all Z can find of Barbatus is his head. Before he dies, Barbatus tells Z to think for himself rather than follow orders all his life, leaving Z saddened and depressed. Z returns home and is hailed as a war hero, even though he did not do anything and was traumatized by the fighting. He is also congratulated by the secretly irate General Mandible, and is brought before the Queen. There he meets Bala, who eventually recognizes him as a worker. When Z finds that he has been cornered, he panics and pretends to take Bala \"hostage\" to trick the queen's guards into letting him leave rather than imprison him. They escape the colony and hide, and Z begins searching for Insectopia, a legendary paradise a drunken bar patron (John Mahoney) told him about.\nWord of the incident immediately spreads through the colony, and Z's act of individuality sparks a revolution in the workers and a few soldier ants as well, grinding productivity to a halt. Seeing an opportunity to gain control, General Mandible publicly portrays Z as a war criminal who only cares about himself. Mandible then promotes the glory of conformity and promises them a better life, which he claims to be the reward of completing a \"Mega Tunnel\" planned by himself. Mandible learns Z is looking for Insectopia after interrogating Weaver. Knowing of the place's existence, Mandible sends his second-in-command, Colonel Cutter (Christopher Walken), to retrieve the Princess and possibly kill Z. Cutter, however, slowly begins to have second thoughts about Mandible's plans and develops sympathy for the worker ants.\nZ and Bala, after some misdirection, a brief separation and a perilous run-in with a picnicking human child, finally find Insectopia, which consists of a human waste-bin overfilled with decaying food. Bala begins to reciprocate Z's feelings. However, Cutter arrives and flies Bala back to the colony against her will. Z finds them gone and makes his way to rescue Bala, aided by a wasp named Chip (Dan Aykroyd), whom he met earlier and who has made himself drunk grieving over the loss of his swatted wife, Muffy (Jane Curtin). Z arrives at the colony, where he finds that Bala is being held captive in General Mandible's office. After rescuing her, he learns that General Mandible's \"Mega Tunnel\" leads straight to a body of water (the puddle next to Insectopia), which Mandible will use to drown the queen and the workers who have gathered at the opening ceremony. Bala goes to warn the workers and her mother at the ceremony, while Z goes to the tunnel exit to prevent the workers from digging any further. He fails, however, and the water leaks in. Z and Bala unify the workers into a single working unit and build a towering ladder of ants towards the surface as the water continues to rise.\nMeanwhile, General Mandible and his soldiers are gathered at the surface, where he explains to them his vision of a new colony with none of the \"weak elements of the colony\". He is interrupted, however, when the workers successfully claw their way to the surface and break through. Mandible angrily tries to kill Z but is stopped by Cutter, who finally rebels against Mandible and instead tries to help Z and the worker ants out of the hole \"for the good of the colony.\" The enraged Mandible charges toward Cutter, but Z pushes Cutter out of the way at the last minute and is tackled into the flooded colony with Mandible. Mandible is killed when he lands upon a root while Z falls into the water. Cutter, taking charge, orders the other soldier ants to help the workers and the queen onto the surface while he himself rescues Z. Although it seems that Z is dead, Bala successfully resuscitates him. Z is lauded for his heroism and marries Bala. Together they rebuild the colony, transforming the colony from a conformist military state into a community that values each and every one of its members."}

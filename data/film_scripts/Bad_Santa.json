It is early evening -- \n               happy hour -- and the clientele is well-heeled and sociable.\n\n               A customer says something interrogative to the bartender, \n               who looks down the bar and shrugs.\n\n               REVERSE - CAMERA CONTINUES MOVEMENT (Notes the combination \n               of the HIGH ANGLE and the tilt of Santa's head keep his face \n               from being clearly revealed in this scene).\n\n               Sitting alone at the far end of the bar, given a wide berth \n               by the other customers, a man (WILLIE) stares morosely into \n               his drink. The drink is clearly not his first.\n\n               He wears a red velvet suit and red velvet hat with a white \n               pom-pom. He has shiny black boots with red velvet trim. His \n               long white beard is not real and is in fact pulled down below \n               his chin to facilitate drinking.

MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT\n\n               Marcus reaches into jewelry cases and removes a few particular \n               items. He drops them into a stock cart then checks a typed \n               list before moving on.\n\n               Marcus pushes the cart through the store, gathering an odd \n               array of items that range from furs to gowns to shoes to \n               makeup.\n\n               INT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - BACK OFFICES - NIGHT\n\n               Marcus arrives outside a doorway and looks in to see Willie \n               manning a large water drill and putting it to work on the \n               store's vault.\n\n                                     MARCUS\n                         How's it goin'?\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         I'm finished when I'm finished.\n\n                                     MARCUS\n                         I'm goin' downstairs...\n                              (referring to list)\n                         I need a melon-bailer and a loofah.\n\n               The drill suddenly revs higher, getting Willie's attention.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Got it.\n\n               Marcus moves closer as Willie pulls back the drill on the \n               track. He places a screwdriver into the exposed lock assembly \n               and hits it with a sledgehammer.\n\n               Suddenly, the door swings open and bundled cash spills to \n               the floor. Both men are impressed.\n\n                                     MARCUS\n                         Fuck the loofah, let's go.\n\n               EXT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - SHIPPING DOCK - NIGHT \n\n               Marcus and Willie wheel out two carts and roll them through \n               the open doors of a waiting van. As they slam the doors --\n\n               INT. VAN - NIGHT\n\n               Willie settles on the rear bench as Marcus gets into the \n               passenger seat next to his Pillipina Mail-order wife of \n               several years, LOIS, who is dressed in expensively ugly \n               clothes, and whose mouth is ever down-turned in pruney \n               distaste.\n\n                                     LOIS\n                         Marcus, did you get the loofah?\n\n                                     MARCUS\n                         Drive.\n\n               EXT.

RATBAG APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               Willie, in bed, blearily wakes to the insistent alarm. He \n               tries to turn it off, but his fingers are still clotted with \n               sleep.\n\n               In a series of frustrated grunts and groans he becomes more \n               and more aggravated until, finally --\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!\n\n               He bolts out of bed and throws the clock into the wall.\n\n               He stoops for some beer bottle empties and hurls them at the \n               clock debris.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!\n\n               One final scream and it's out of his system. He finds one \n               last bottle in his hand, half-full with a cigarette butt \n               floating in it.\n\n               He downs the beer and steps into the adjoining bathroom to \n               brush his teeth.\n\n               EXT. KEY BISCAYNE STREET - DAY\n\n               Willie, sipping a cup of coffee, meanders down the street \n               scratching his ass.\n\n               EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY\n\n               Willie's walk brings him to a fancy eatery at lunchtime. As \n               he passes, he casually snatches a handful of car keys from \n               the parking valet key-box and moves on.\n\n               As he rounds the corner into the lot he pushes on the various \n               key fobs, identifying various cars when their alarms chirp.\n\n               He seems dissatisfied until a brand new Cadillac chirps.\n\n               Willie gets in and drives off.\n\n               INT. CADILLAC - MOVING - DAY\n\n               Willie drives. He reaches over into the glove compartment \n               and pulls out the registration. He focuses on the car owner's \n               address.\n\n               INT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - HALLWAY - DAY\n\n               Willie, eating a corn dog, saunters down an opulent hallway, \n               a beer swinging in one hand.\n\n               INT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - BATHROOM - DAY \n\n               In long shot, through the open door of an extravagant marble \n               bathroom, we see Willie sitting on the toilet, leafing through \n               a magazine, beer bottle on the counter next to him. Pants \n               around his ankles.\n\n               INT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER \n\n               Willie, standing by the toilet, finishes buckling his belt \n               and flips the flush lever.\n\n               Nothing happens; no whoosh of rushing water.\n\n               Willie, looking down into the toilet, gives the lever a couple \n               more clanking tries, and then grabs his beer and ambles off.\n\n               INT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - STUDY - DAY\n\n               Sucking on his beer, Willie paces the periphery of the room, \n               methodically knocking painting after painting off the walls.\n\n               INT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY\n\n               Willie arrives in the bedroom still knocking down paintings \n               until, finally, he exposes a wall safe.\n\n               A smile, and he pulls out a stethoscope.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               The safe door swings open to reveal stacks of cash.\n\n               INT.

He's now wearing a Rolex \n               and some gaudy ring.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Goddamn it!\n\n               He reaches for another one and we see that on the bartop in \n               front of him are neat stacks of lottery tickets as yet \n               unscratched, and an untidy jumble of scratched ones.\n\n               On the other side of the bar a MIDDLE-AGED STRIPPER vies for \n               his attention. Willie's ticket hits for $5.00.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Yeah baby!\n\n               He tucks it into the Stripper's G-string, swigs a drink, and \n               resumes scratching.\n\n               INT. RATBAG APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               Willie and the Stripper stagger into his apartment, drunk.\n\n               As he passes his blinking answering machine:\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         I got messages.

Willie polishes \n               off a pint of Smirnoff's and flips it towards a nearby trash \n               can.

Rudolfo the Red Nosed Burro \n               is tended by several Santa's elf mannequins. One in cowboy \n               wear and another in a poncho and sombrero.\n\n               Again there is a line of waiting children. Marcus makes his \n               way through the line as kids gasp and cheer.

The doors swing open to reveal a \n               pathetic EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KID, overweight, snot-nosed, badly \n               dressed and probably smelling of pee.\n\n               As the kid nears the mall entrance he passes a group of older \n               children doing skateboard stunts.

The \n               boy eats a chocolate ice cream cone which is smeared all \n               over his mouth and T-shirt.

QUIET ROAD - NIGHT\n\n               Marcus stands by the side of his van. It's parked on the \n               shoulder with the hood up, jumper cables attached and hanging. \n               Lois is in the driver's seat.\n\n               Gin's Ford 4 X 4 speeds around the corner and Marcus flags \n               him down.\n\n               SCREEEEECH! Gin slams on the brakes, then backs up and pulls \n               over. He emerges from the 4 X 4 with road rage on full brew, \n               and strides over to the van.\n\n                                     GIN\n                         Jesus, Mother Mary and Joseph!

Grumbling, he goes back to \n               the 4 X 4 and drives it into position. He gets out and raises \n               the hood.\n\n               The two vehicles face each other nose-to-nose, several feet \n               apart as Gin opens the hood.\n\n                                     GIN\n                              (motions to his battery)\n                         Help yourself, small fry.\n\n               Marcus seems to have a little difficulty reaching the battery \n               terminals.\n\n                                     MARCUS\n                         It's hard for me to reach...\n\n               Gin grabs the cables from him. Marcus takes a few steps back.\n\n                                     GIN\n                         Jesus Christ, give me those!\n\n                                     MARCUS\n                         Thanks.\n\n               Gin attaches the cables.\n\n                                     GIN\n                              (then, to Lois)\n                         Alright, TRY IT!\n\n               Lois turns the key and the van starts right up. Gin takes \n               the cables off the van and closes the hood. He lights up a \n               Pall Mall.\n\n               Marcus signals to Lois. She puts the car into gear and stomps \n               her foot on the accelerator, squashing Gin between the two \n               vehicles.\n\n               ANGLE PROM INSIDE VAN (SLOW MOTION):\n\n               Gin's face as it's squooshed up against the van's windshield.\n\n               A cloud of cigarette smoke escapes his lips.\n\n               Lois continues to step on the gas, trying to crush him.\n\n               ANGLE ON: the tires spinning in the gravel.\n\n               Finally, she takes her foot off the gas. The van eases back.\n\n               Gin falls to the ground with a groan. Marcus steps up and \n               leans over him.\n\n                                     MARCUS\n                         Oh my, what a terrible accident!\n\n                                     LOIS\n                         Is he dead?\n\n                                     MARCUS\n                         No, but it looks like you broke most \n                         of his ribs.\n\n               Then, leaning down to Gin.\n\n                                     MARCUS\n                              (for Gin's benefit)\n                         I'd say maybe... fifty percent of \n                         them?

A small jolt and a \n               spark or two.

Gin tries to crawl out of the way.\n\n               ANGLE ON: Gin's feet slipping on the gravel.\n\n                                     MARCUS\n                         Put it in reverse.\n\n               ANGLE ON: shift level moving into REVERSE.\n\n               ANGLE ON: Lois' foot stepping on the gas pedal.\n\n               WIDER: Lois drives backwards.

CHAMBERLAIN'S - MONTAGE - NIGHT\n\n               Willie stares at the safe while rubbing sandpaper to his \n               fingertips.\n\n               Meanwhile, Marcus emerges from a stockroom with a cart to \n               begin his shopping spree.\n\n               Willie applies a stethoscope to the safe, tapping with one \n               hand and listening intently.\n\n               Marcus starts in Ladies' Accessories, finding the cashmere \n               scarf.\n\n               Willie applies the drill to the safe.\n\n               Marcus makes his way through Lingerie.\n\n               Willie pulls back the drill. The bit is trashed, the safe is \n               completely unscathed.\n\n               Marcus is in Shoes picking out pumps for Lois.\n\n               Willie is in Home Improvement, flipping tools off the shelves \n               into a cart of his own.\n\n               Marcus is in Evening Wear, jumping to try to pull a stole \n               off a mannequin.\n\n               Willie batters a chisel into the seam of the safe door.\n\n               Marcus continues to leap at the mannequin.\n\n               Willie is atop the safe, swinging a sledgehammer at the lock.\n\n               Marcus swings at the mannequin's knees with a golf club.\n\n               Willie uses a plasma welder on the safe.\n\n               Marcus, having chopped down the mannequin, drags off its \n               stole.\n\n               Willie is back over the safe, battering it with the \n               sledgehammer, roaring with each swing.\n\n               Marcus is in Housewares pilfering crock pots.\n\n               Willie, sweating, drops the sledgehammer clanking to the \n               floor. Wiping his forehead, he circles the safe. When he \n               gets to the back of the safe he stops, thinks.\n\n               Marcus is in Home Entertainment grabbing a stereo.\n\n               Willie is hunched at the back of the safe, stethoscope to \n               its surface, giving exploratory taps with two knuckles.\n\n               Sound perspective through the stethoscope: hollow THUNKS \n               followed by an unnaturally loud and present CREEEEEEEEAK.\n\n               Willie reacts quizzically. After a considering moment he \n               rises. we can see, on the far side of the safe, its door as \n               it finishes creaking open.\n\n               Marcus enters the room. Willie looks at him.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Piece of cake.\n\n               Marcus starts removing stacks of cash and loading them into \n               the Santa sack. Willie wipes sweat off his forehead.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         ...I'll be right back.

CHAMBERLAN'S - TOY DEPT. - NIGHT\n\n               We are looking at a big, fuzzy, smiling, pink stuffed \n               elephant.\n\n               Willie's hand hesitates between this elephant and the one \n               behind, which is purple. We hear him muttering:\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         Shit... which did he say?\n\n               The hand finally leaves with the purple elephant.\n\n               We hold for a long beat.\n\n               The hand reenters to put back the purple and take the pink.\n\n               Willie turns around holding the stuffed elephant.\n\n               Marcus and Lois are standing there presenting a grotesque \n               picture: Lois has a shopping cart filled with shoes, scarves, \n               jewels, a salad spinner, purses, a block of Ginsu knives, an \n               abdomen exerciser.

THE KID'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n               After a long beat, Willie's voice:\n\n                                     WILLIE (V.O.)\n                         Dear kid. I hope that you got my \n                         present and that there wasn't too \n                         much blood on it, although there was \n                         blood on the present you gave me \n                         which didn't keep me from enjoying \n                         it, so maybe the blood doesn't matter \n                         so much I guess.\n\n               We are FADING IN on a shelf in the Kid's bedroom where the \n               stuffed elephant sits, in a place of honor, its fur indeed \n               stiff and stained with dried blood. The Kid's bedroom is no \n               longer in disarray, things are neat and comfy. We PAN OFF of \n               it to find this letter, crudely handwritten, tacked up on a \n               little bulletin board.\n\n                                     WILLIE (V.O.)\n                         ...Anyway, just in case they took it \n                         as evidence I am also sending you a \n                         T-shirt. I hope it's the right size. \n                         I am healing up good and they tell \n                         me that I will soon be one hundred \n                         percent even with eight bullets dug \n                         out of me because they didn't hit \n                         any vital organs, just my liver which \n                         is fucked anyway, ha-ha-ha. Anyways...\n\n               Our CONTINUING PAN brings us to the open door of the bedroom \n               and we hear the sound of the TV in the living room. We TRACK \n               toward it.\n\n                                     WILLIE (V.O.)\n                         ...Thank you for giving that letter \n                         to the cops. I forgot I asked you to \n                         do it but it's a good thing you did \n                         or Santa's little helper would've \n                         plugged his ass. And now the cops \n                         know I wrote it, which is gonna keep \n                         my ass out of jail. That, plus \n                         everyone agreeing that the Phoenix \n                         police department shooting an unarmed \n                         Santa was even more fucked-up than \n                         Rodney King. The cops are treating \n                         me like fucking royalty now which is \n                         new in my experience. They are gonna \n                         make me a sensitivity counselor so \n                         that tragedies like this will never \n                         again embarrass the whole fucking \n                         department. Whatever.\n\n               Grandma is in the living room watching TV. We TRACK past her \n               towards the Jacuzzi area.\n\n                                     WILLIE\n                         ...As for my little helper, I am \n                         sorry to have to tell you that him \n                         and his prune-faced mail-order-wife \n                         are gonna be exploring mountains \n                         with your dad.

Stokes (Billy Bob Thornton) and his dwarfed assistant Marcus (Tony Cox) are professional thieves. Every year, Willie disguises himself as a department store Santa Claus and Marcus disguises himself as an elf in order for both of them to rob shopping malls blind at night. Willie is an alcoholic, a sex addict, and is gradually unable to perform his Santa duties appropriately with children, much to Marcus' dismay. When they are hired at the fictional Saguaro Square Mall in Phoenix, the vulgar remarks made by Willie shock the prudish mall manager Bob Chipeska (John Ritter), who brings it to the attention of security chief Gin Slagel (Bernie Mac).\nAt the mall, Willie is visited by Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly), a friendly but exceedingly naive and gullible, overweight boy who thinks Willie is really Santa. The boy is a target of taunt and torment from a skateboarding gang. At a bar, Willie meets Sue (Lauren Graham), a woman with a Santa Claus fetish, and they begin a sexual relationship. Willie is harassed by a man in the bar, but Thurman intervenes. Willie gives Thurman a ride home, then enters the boy's house where he lives with his senile grandmother (Cloris Leachman). Thurman reveals that his mother died, and his father, Roger, is away \"exploring mountains\" (meaning he is actually in jail for embezzlement) until next year. Willie tricks Thurman into letting him steal from the house safe and steals a BMW owned by Thurman's father.\nBob informs Gin that he overheard Willie having sex with a woman in a mall dressing room; Gin starts to investigate. Willie goes to his motel room and sees it being raided, causing him to take advantage of Thurman's naivete and live in his house. The next day, Marcus gets angry at Willie for taking advantage of Thurman, stating his disapproval of Willie's sex addiction.\nGin's investigation of Willie includes visiting Thurman's imprisoned father, who reveals that Willie is staying with Thurman illegally. He confronts Willie at the mall, and takes him and Marcus to a bar. There, he reveals that he has figured out their plan, blackmailing them for half of the cut to keep silent.\nWillie attempts to commit suicide by inhaling vehicle exhaust fumes. He gives Thurman a letter to give to the police, confessing all his misdeeds. Willie notices Thurman's black eye, which persuades him to make an example of the skateboarding bully. A renewed sense of purpose for Willie has him attempt to train Thurman in boxing.\nEnraged at Gin for blackmailing him, Marcus and his wife Lois (Lauren Tom) set up a trap for Gin, feigning needing a jump start for their vehicle from Gin's. Lois hits Gin with the car, then Marcus kills him.\nOn Christmas Eve, when the heist is almost complete, Willie goes to get Thurman a pink stuffed elephant that he had wanted for Christmas. Just as he gets the elephant, Marcus reveals to Willie that he intends to kill him, fed up with his increasing carelessness. Lois tells him to hurry up and kill Willie so they can get away with the money and merchandise. But just as Marcus is about to shoot Willie, the police swarm the trio, tipped off by the letter Willie gave to Thurman. When Marcus opens fire, the police shoot at him and Willie flees. Determined to give Thurman his present, he leads the police on a chase to Thurman's house, ignoring orders to freeze. He is repeatedly shot on Thurman's porch, but survives.\nThe epilogue is told through a letter from Willie, who is in a hospital recovering. He expresses his gratitude for Thurman in giving the letter to the police and his name was cleared of unarmed robbery. Shooting an unarmed Santa embarrassed the police, and Sue is granted guardianship over Thurman and his house until Thurman's father, Roger, is released. Willie also explains that Marcus (identified as Santa's Little Helper) and Lois are serving time behind bars for their actions, while expressing hope Roger is wise to avoid the two. The movie ends with Thurman finally standing up to his bully by kicking him in the crotch causing him to fall to the ground. Thurman is seen riding his bike away flipping off the bully."}

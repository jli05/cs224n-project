One of those \"his\n          Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull\n          Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was\n          gonna take away his scatter gun\" .\n          He idolized West.\nMuller, grinning, as West kicks his ass to pick up the pace.\nNext to him is NUNEZ, a strapping hulk of a manchild.\n                      DUNBAR (V.O.)\n          And Nunez idolized Mueller. Big\n          fella from New Mexico. After he got\n          Sectioned he just followed Mueller\n          around like a lap dog. He wasn't\n          mean like Mueller, though, didn't\n          have it in him.\nNext to Nunez is CHILDS, small and weasely with feral eyes.\n                      DUNBAR (V.O.)\n          But Childs did. Didn't talk to\n          anyone, but you got this feeling\n          something was wrong with him, like\n          real wrong. Type of guy you felt\n          uncomfortable going to sleep near.\nBehind Childs runs Pike.\n                      DUNBAR (V.O.)\n          Pike I told you about. He took the\n          brunt of it from Mueller and West.\n          Once they found it out he was a\n          convict they were merciless.\n                      (MORE)\n\n                                                           22.\n                      DUNBAR (V.O.)

He made the wrong choice.\nNext to Pike, Dunbar and KENDALL run side by side.   Kendall\nis short like Childs, but also weak. Wheezing.\n                      DUNBAR\n          Finally Kendall and me. Kendall was\n          a smart guy, we got along okay.\n          Pike and I tried to help him, but...\nKendall falters and Pike stops to try and help him up. West\nsmacks the him away, practically kicking Kendall to his feet.\n                      DUNBAR (V.O.)\n          He was sickly. Had that shaking\n          thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?\n                       OSBORNE (V.O.)\n          Epilepsy.\n                      DUNBAR (V.O.)\n          Yeah. Spent half his time in the\n          infirmary. Only reason he enlisted\n          was his father. West didn't section\n          him till last week.\nINT.

Punching,\nkicking, biting, anything to stop the other man.\n\n                                                                 92.\nNunez, CHOKING Mueller as he strains to reach his gun...\n                          MUELLER\n            Roberto...\nWith a HEAVE, Nunez SNAPS HIS NECK.        Mueller lies still.\n                        DUNBAR (V.O.)\n            He took his gun. Used it on Childs.\nNunez spins, seeing CHILDS BEHIND HIM. He DIVES as Childs\nfires! Hits the ground in a roll, comes up with Mueller's\nrifle, and SHOOTS - BLOWING CHILDS BACK against the wet rocks.\n                        DUNBAR (V.O.)\n            I can't imagine what it was like.\n            Having your friends try to kill you...\nNunez slumps against the gully's wall, breathing hard.          In\nagony over what he's just had to do.\n                        DUNBAR (V.O.)\n            But you do what you have to survive.\nClosing his eyes, Nunez steels himself. Wipes the blood\nfrom his hands and climbs out of the gully.\nELSEWHERE\nPIKE, creeping through the foliage. Trying to listen for\nsounds of movement through the storm. His eyes narrow as he\nhears a HIGH PITCHED WHINE...\nThe bullet hits his forehead dead center.        He crumples.\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL - Nunez in a tree, thirty meters away.\nLowering his rifle.      He climbs down.\n                        DUNBAR (V.O.)\n            Kendall and I found Dunbar a couple\n            minutes later.\nTIME CUT TO:\nDunbar and Kendall come upon Pike's fallen form. They gaze\ndown at the uniform emblazoned with the name \"DUNBAR\".\n                        DUNBAR (V.O.)\n            It came to me in a split second.\n            Change clothes, change identities.\n            If James Pike gets discharged he\n            goes right back to jail. But if I\n            was Dunbar, I could walk away from\n            all this with a new life. But then...\nAs he reaches down for the uniform, a SHOT RINGS OUT.\n\n                                                           93.\nKENDALL FALLS, wounded in the arm. Dunbar raises his rifle\nto find Nunez, standing ten yards away, gun trained on him.\nYELLING OVER THE HURRICANE:\n                          NUNEZ\n           Put it down!\nA Mexican stand-off.   The rain continues to fall.\n                       DUNBAR\n           I just want to go!\nNunez shakes his head.\n                       NUNEZ\n           You were gonna kill me, Pike!    Thought\n           you were my friend!\nDunbar, torn. He can't bring himself to shoot, but he can't\nsurrender either.\n                       DUNBAR\n           I have to get Kendall to a hospital!\n                       NUNEZ\n           He was gonna kill me too!\nSilence.   The two men still facing each other.\n                       NUNEZ {CONT'D)\n           I snapped Mueller's neck! He was my\n           best friend and I had to snap his\n           neck because he was gonna shoot me\n           for drugs! For West!\n                       DUNBAR\n           We don't have to do this! You go\n           that way, I'll go this way!\nNunez laughs.\n                       NUNEZ\n           You'll shoot me in the back!\n                       DUNBAR\n           You killed three people!    Isn't that\n           enough for one night?\nMore silence.   Neither moves.    The sky above, a maelstrom.\n                       DUNBAR\n           I don't want to die out here, Roberto!\n           Do you?\nNunez, staring at him.     Deciding.\n\n                                                              94.\n                      NUNEZ\n          If you even twitch...\nDunbar nods.\nNunez begins backing away, rifle still trained on him.\nAnd then Dunbar spies something behind and to the left of\nNunez...\nWest.\nStaring down at him from behind some brush.       Watching.\nNunez, slowly backing away. He pauses as his foot catches\non a fallen branch. Looks away from Dunbar for a split second\nto step over it...\nWest nods to Dunbar as if to say \"Go on. . . \"\n                      DUNBAR\n          Forgive me. ..\nAnd Dunbar FIRES.\nNunez, caught by the burst, GOES DOWN. The echo of the\ngunshots, swallowed by the storm. Dunbar lowers his head in\nagony. West walks down.\n                      WEST\n          Congratulations, Cadet Pike.      You\n          get the gold star.\nDunbar stares at his Sergeant through the rain.\n                        DUN BAR\n          Fuck you.\nWest smiles.   Tilts his head to Kendall.\n                      WEST\n          You'd best get him out of here.\n          Don't worry about the bodies, they'll\n          be taken care of.\nDunbar doesn't move.\n                      WEST\n          This is where we part ways, Cadet.\n          You tell them I died out here, or\n          I'll come back for you. Tell them\n          one of the others did me. Mueller,\n          Childs, I don't care who. You and\n          Kendall, you tell them a story.\n              (smiling)\n          You can tell a story, can't you?\nDunbar doesn't reply.   West laughs and flips him a salute.\n\n                                                         95.\n                       WEST\n          Dismissed.\n\nAnd West turns and walks away, stepping over Nunez.   Giving\nDunbar a clear shot at his back.\n\nDunbar raises his rifle, wanting, needing, dying to shoot\nthe old man...\n\nBut he can't.   West disappears into the bayou.\n\nA GROAN from the ground. Kendall. Dunbar's reverie broken,\nhe leans down, beginning to unbutton the Dunbar Uniform...\n\nINT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING\n\nDunbar stubs out a cigarette, finished. Hardy, Osborne,\nStyles, and the JAG Lawyer gaping at what he has just said.\n\n                      DUNBAR\n          I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all.\n          He came after us with a vengeance.\n              (to Styles)\n          You know the rest.\n\n                      HARDY\n          And the bodies?\n\n                      DUNBAR\n          You won't find them. Won't find\n          West, either. He's too good.\n\n                      OSBORNE\n          No bodies, no West...\n\n                      HARDY\n          No death certificates.    No crime.\n\n                      DUNBAR\n          Just four people MIA.    Silence.\n\nThe JAG Lawyer steps forward.\n\n                      JAG LAWYER\n          You'll testify to this, the\n          corruption, the drug scam?\n\nDunbar says nothing.\n\n                      JAG LAWYER\n          We can cut a deal for you on the\n          Nunez killing.\n\n                      DUNBAR\n          I don't want any deals.\n\n                                                            96.\n                       JAG LAWYER\n           If you're telling the truth, the PX\n           requisition records will prove it-\n                       DUNBAR\n           All the proof you need will be when\n           West comes back and puts a bullet in\n           my brain. But I'll do it. I'm a\n           dead man, anyway. Like Kendall.\n               (looking at Hardy)\n           We both should have died out there\n           with our brothers. I know that now.\nSilence.   The JAG Lawyer looks to Hardy, all anger gone.\n                       JAG LAWYER\n           I'll take him now if you don't mind.\nHardy nods. Dunbar rises and slowly walks to the door.\nTurning back to Hardy.\n                       DUNBAR\n           Tell me, detective.   Did you get\n           what you wanted?\nHardy shakes his head, sadly.\n                       HARDY\n           Not even close.\nThey leave.   Styles walks over to Hardy.\n                       STYLES\n           Tom-\nHardy holds up a hand, cutting him off. Styles nods,\nunderstanding, and leaves, closing the door behind him.\nHardy and Osborne stand there.   Not speaking.    It's done.\nINT. FORT MCKINLEY -- OFFICER'S CLUB -- NIGHT\nSeveral hours and bourbons later, Hardy sits at the bar,\ndrunk and alone. Out of place, the only one not in uniform.\nOsborne walks in, locates Hardy, and strides over to the\nbar, a sheaf of papers under her arm. Her face, stoic.\n                       OSBORNE\n           We need to talk-\n                       HARDY\n           Seven.\nHe takes a slug of his drink.\n                       OSBORNE\n           What?\n\n                                                       97.\n                      HARDY\n          Seven guys. What was it you said?\n          You were \"just starting to believe I\n          wasn't the guy people said\".\nHe chuckles.\n                     HARDY {CONT'D)\n          Seven. That's the answer to Kendall's\n          question. How many? Seven.\nOsborne looks at him.    Realizing what he's saying.\n                      OSBORNE\n          This isn't the time-\n                      HARDY\n          This is the perfect time. You know\n          what makes a good detective? The\n          number of confessions they get.\n          You're a good detective, Osborne.\n          So now you get mine.\n                      OSBORNE\n          What if I don't want it?\n                         HARDY\n          Tough.\nHe pours himself another drink.\n                         HARDY\n          Thing about    taking money is, you\n          don't have    to do anything.  You just\n          sit there.     Maybe you don't return a\n          phone call.     Maybe you don't follow\n          up a lead.     But that's it.  Keep the\n          money, your    work's done.\nOsborne stares at him.\n                      HARDY\n          Seven unsolved murders. And you\n          know what? It didn't weigh on my\n          conscience. Not one goddamn bit.\nHe takes a slug from his glass and grimaces.\n                      OSBORNE\n          That's not true.\n                      HARDY\n          There are degrees of truth, officer.\n          Always degrees.\n\n                                                          98.\n                      OSBORNE\n          You're a good man, Hardy.\n                        HARDY\n          Really.\n                      OSBORNE\n          Far as I'm concerned, whatever you\n          did in the past can stay in the past.\nHardy stares at her.\n                      HARDY\n          I may not be growing on you, but\n          you're sure as hell growing on me.\nHe motions to the bartender for another glass, but Osborne\ntakes his hand, stopping him.\n                      OSBORNE\n          And because you're a good man, I\n          know you'll do the right thing.\nHardy looks at her, questioning.   Osborne takes a deep breath.\n                      OSBORNE\n          Pike never made it to D.C.. Somebody\n          took him off the plane before it\n          left. My guess is he's already dead.\nHardy stares at her.\n                        HARDY\n          West?\n                        OSBORNE\n          Nobody saw.    But I don't think so.\nShe puts the papers on the bar.\n                      OSBORNE\n          These are the requisitions from the\n          PX, the ones used to release the\n          drugs to Mueller. West signed half\n          of them - Pike was telling the truth.\n          Look who signed the other half.\nShe taps the bottom of the paper. Hardy, not wanting to\nbelieve it. He looks up at her, pained.\n                      HARDY\n          Do I have a choice in this?\n                      OSBORNE\n          Yeah. I can wait till you're off\n          the base and do it myself.\n\n                                                       99.\nHardy stares at his glass.   Deciding.\n                       HARDY\n          Fuck it.   Let's go finish this.\nINT. STYLES' OFFICE -- NIGHT\nStyles, finishing his paperwork. He rises and turns off his\ndesk light, bathing the office in DARKNESS. He's about to\nleave when he notices a SILHOUETTE in the doorway.\n                      HARDY\n          \"You have to get out of the way of\n          the bigger dogs\". That was good.\nStyles squints at the figure.\n                      STYLES\n          Tom, is that you?\nHardy steps forward, into the office.\n                      HARDY\n          It was so good, I actually forgot\n          you're one of the bigger dogs now.\n          The Base Commander. The one in\n          control.\nYou couldn't let him testify, could you?\n                      STYLES\n          What are you talking about?\n                      HARDY\n          If you let him testify then it would\n          have all come out. West was supposed\n          to take care of it out there, shut\n          Nunez up and then disappear. But it\n          got messy and people got killed. So\n          you called your old pal Tom Hardy,\n          figuring if worse came to worse,\n          he'd cover for you.\n                      STYLES\n          You're drunk-\n                      HARDY\n          I'm not going to cover for you, Bill.\n          Not for this.\nStyles, realizing what Hardy's talking about.\n                       STYLES\n          Look-\nHe begins to move from behind his desk.\n\n                                                   100.\n                      HARDY\n          Stay where you are.\n\n                       STYLES\n          Or what?   You've gone round the bend-\n\n                      HARDY\n          West had a partner. Someone who\n          knew how to get things done.\n\nHardy throws the papers onto Styles' desk.\n\n                      HARDY\n          What I can't understand is why you\n          signed these. If you'd just let\n          West take care of the paperwork, no\n          one would have known, but you got\n          careless. So when Pike finally told\n          the truth you had to get rid of him,\n          too.\n\n                      STYLES\n          That's preposterous-\n\n                      HARDY\n          Toxicology report came back.\n          Kendall's attack was caused by a\n          drug known as anephadrine, maybe\n          you've heard of it. It's for\n          asthmatics. If an epileptic takes\n          enough, it kills them.

You heard\n          our interrogation, you knew he was\n          ready to crack, so you killed him,\n          just like Pike.\n\n                      STYLES\n          I'm not even going to dignify that-\n\n                      HARDY\n          No!  You will stand there and you\n          will listen! What happened to you,\n          Bill?  You were the one who joined\n          up to do good in the world.

Jackson), engage in a training exercise: navigate the jungle in hurricane conditions using live fire to hit targets before rendezvousing at a bunker.\nLater, a rescue chopper sees Sergeant Ray Dunbar emerge from the jungle, carrying wounded Second Lieutenant Levi Kendall. The two men are pursued by a third soldier, Sergeant Mueller, who is shooting at them. Dunbar kills Mueller in self-defense. Although no other bodies are found, the rest of West's team are presumed dead.\nDunbar refuses to talk to Captain Julia Osborne (Connie Nielsen). Instead he insists on speaking to a fellow Ranger from outside the base and draws an \"8\" inside a circle on a piece of paper. Spooked on seeing the \"8\", base commander Colonel Bill Styles (Timothy Daly), calls in an experienced interrogator and friend, DEA agent Tom Hardy (John Travolta) who is also an ex-Ranger. Even though he is now under investigation for suspicion of bribery, Styles assigns him to Osborne. The pair have only 6 hours before the CID transport from Washington arrives to take Dunbar and Kendall away.\n\nHardy begins by revealing to Dunbar during the initial interrogation that he served under West as a Ranger. He also mentions that he knows West is infamous for being a ruthless, tough-as-nails sergeant.\nDunbar relates that another trainee who went on the Panama training mission with Dunbar, Kendall, Mueller and two others, Nu\u00f1ez and Castro, was named Pike. Pike had earned West's wrath, because West thought he was not following orders. Hardy and Osborne suggest that with plenty of reason to hate West, Pike had motive to murder him. Dunbar refuses to say more. Before Hardy and Osborne leave, Hardy asks for cigarettes because he had \"forgotten\" them in his car.\n\nHardy and Osborne then go to see Kendall, son of a Joint Chiefs of Staff general, recovering from gunshot wounds. At the hospital, Hardy runs into Dr. Peter Vilmer (Harry Connick Jr.), an old friend and Osborne's former love interest.\nKendall, after recognizing Hardy as \"the DEA agent with friends in low places\", reveals he is a homosexual and claims West hated him because of it, and that West silently threatened his life shortly before the mission began, partnering him with Castro for the mission, and feared West may have ordered Castro to give him a \"training accident\".\nKendall claims West died when hit in the back with a white phosphorus grenade and that Pike confessed to the crime, thinking his comrades would be \"on board\" with him in support. However, the team decided to turn Pike in. In the night, Pike tried to gain Kendall's sympathies, playing on their mutual hatred of West. Pike proposed killing Mueller and Nunez and convincing Dunbar and Castro to back them up. Kendall dismissed Pike's suggestion, but later spots Pike whispering to Dunbar. Kendall says Dunbar went back to his bag, extracted his pistol and aimed it at the sleeping Mueller. A firefight ensued, and Mueller shot Castro, who fired and hit Nunez, Kendall and Pike. Nunez and Pike die and Kendall is wounded. Dunbar then carried Kendall, exchanging fire with Mueller to the pickup point, as seen at the start of the film. Asked why Dunbar would rescue him, Kendall suggests maybe Dunbar expected him to cover for him in gratitude.\n\nDunbar, now accused of murder, says Kendall is lying and claims he didn't shoot West. Hardy notes Kendall claimed West died from a grenade, not shooting.\nDunbar claims Mueller and Castro were selling prescription drug kits called \"combat cocktails\" to help dull physical pain and sharpen the mind; that Mueller shot West, who became aware of their drug dealing, and claims Mueller then used Pike's grenade, stolen from his pack earlier. At the bunker, Mueller tried to pin the blame on Pike, but Pike pointed out evidence throwing suspicion on Mueller. A fierce argument ensued and Mueller executed Pike. A firefight broke out and Castro and Nunez die. Dunbar rescued Kendall and during the pursuit killed Mueller before the helicopter pickup.\nDunbar provides proof of the drug-dealing operation, and states Vilmer supplied the drugs to Mueller and Kendall.\n\nOsborne and Hardy return to the hospital and speak with Dr. Vilmer, who admits that he distributed drugs to Mueller and Kendall and that he falsified drug tests so the soldiers would come up clean. Vilmer is placed under arrest. After his case discussion with them, Styles orders Osborne and Hardy to not talk to Kendall again.\nBut Hardy and Osborne confront Kendall, who is acting very strangely and refuses to give them any useful information, such as why he pinned the three murders on Dunbar. However, Kendall, still claiming that Dunbar was the guilty party, forces them to ask Dunbar about \"all the murders he's covered up for his drug dealer\". They soon discovered that they planned the murder on West, and after a brief chat between Hardy and Osborne, with Kendall still making fun of the two, they are threatening to charge him with the crime as an accessory, which he does not want any part of it, and Kendall continues to laugh at them, thinking that they got nothing on him. Suddenly, while Osborne tells Kendall that they find one of the dead bodies, Hardy noticed him beginning to bleed out of his ears, and calls for a nurse. While Osborne is trying to hold Kendall, he suddenly starts vomiting blood, and abruptly dies. Before he dies, he uses his blood soaked finger to draw on Osborne's palm what she thinks is the sign of infinity. Shortly after, she realizes it is an 8. She shows this to Hardy, who indicates ignorance of its significance. She suspects he knows. After a brief physical fight, he takes her aside and explains the conversation he had earlier with Styles. There is rumored to be a group of ex-Rangers in Panama, trained under West, who turned rogue and became drug-dealers. They call themselves Section 8.\nStyles is furious that Osborne and Hardy talked to Kendall a second time after he explicitly ordered them not to. He relieves Osborne of duty and asks Hardy to leave. He informs them that Dunbar and Vilmer will be taken away shortly on the transport plane that has arrived from the U.S. and he considers the investigation closed.\nAt the stockade, Vilmer casually observes to Hardy and Osborne that he will be on the same plane with Pike. Hardy corrects him, saying that he'll be on the same plane as Dunbar, but Vilmer says that's not right. He reveals that Ray Dunbar is black. The white \"Dunbar\" Hardy and Osborne have been questioning is in fact Pike, the man whom West antagonized during training (according to his own story). Pike had switched his tags with Dunbar's, in order to throw off the local authorities and disappear, after being transported for trial. Hardy and Osborne rush back to the base just as Pike is being taken onto a transport plane. Hardy grabs Pike, but not before he grabs a gun from one of the guards, and holds his face dangerously close to the plane's whirling propeller. The two engage in a brief screaming match, although what they say is inaudible. Pike then drops to his knees, out of breath. Afterward, Hardy and Osborne lead Pike away to interrogate him again now that they know the truth.\n\nIn Pike's new story, West was not shot, and he claims West knew about the main operation going on at the base: cocaine smuggling. He claims West confronted the Rangers in the bunker and told them that he would turn them in to authorities in the morning and tell Styles everything. A brief Mexican standoff ensued and West escaped the bunker. Nu\u00f1ez chased after him and was shot by West. Shortly after, Castro and Mueller went looking for West, Pike found Dunbar dead, West shot Kendall, wounding him, and tried to convince Pike to give himself up. Pike says Mueller managed to kill West, that he then shot at Mueller, and knowing that he would be blamed if West died, took Dunbar's dog tags. It is still established that he managed to escape, carried Kendall through the jungle, killed Mueller and was picked up by the helicopter.\nAs proof, he gives Hardy, Osborne and Styles the number of a crate where Vilmer had stowed cocaine, and they open it.\nHardy then talks to Styles alone. He asks why West wouldn't tell Styles about the drugs as soon as he suspected something. He then accuses Styles of lying, and believes West did in fact go to him, but that Styles was behind the drug dealing operation the whole time; that rather than side with West, Styles ordered Mueller and Kendall to kill him in the jungle and then poisoned Kendall afterward to keep him quiet. Osborne, meanwhile, approaching the office, overhears, and secretly listens. Styles laughs off the accusations, but as Hardy starts to leave by turning him to the authorities, Styles offers him a percentage of the operation, once he's back in business, in order to keep his mouth shut. Hardy, realizing that Styles has been involved in this whole operation all along, says he'll have to think about it and turns to leave. Styles draws his weapon to force Hardy to accept his offer, but is killed by Osborne.\n\nAfter the Military Police wrap up the investigation into Styles' shooting, Osborne is about to leave the base for the night and Hardy tells her that everything's fine and all they have to do, concerning the shooting, is \"Tell the story right.\" Osborne recalls hearing that phrase during both Kendall and Pike's stories, describing how members of the conspiracy planned to cover up West's death.\nOsborne suspects Hardy may be involved, especially since he hated West and because Section 8 contains West's former trainees. She tails him out of the base, and sees Pike run out from some roadside bushes and get into Hardy's jeep. She follows them by car, and then by foot through the streets of Panama City crowded with costumed revelers and watches as the two of them enter a doorway with a big eight ball hanging above it, revealing it as their headquarters. Osborne sneaks through a long hallway, down a flight of stairs, and up behind Hardy and Pike, with her weapon drawn, believing that they are behind both Section 8 and West's murder. Then West, very much alive, walks up behind her. Castro, Dunbar and Nu\u00f1ez are also there, fixing breakfast. Hardy reveals them as his colleagues.\nThey reveal to Osborne that Section 8 is actually a black-ops anti-drug unit led by Tom Hardy (who is addressed as \"Colonel\"). The \"Section-8\" insane-mercenary story is a cover to spook the cartels. \"Dunbar\", \"Castro\", \"Nu\u00f1ez\" and \"Pike\" (not their names) infiltrated the base to investigate the cocaine trafficking that was going on, and discovered Mueller, Kendall and Vilmer were responsible. West, not realizing Styles was also involved, informed him of the findings. Styles responded by ordering Mueller and Kendall to kill West. The training mission ordered by West was in fact a covert Section-8 set-up to get rid of Mueller and Kendall, faking West's death (in order to transfer him to Section 8) and Hardy had been called to the base by the coded message from \"Dunbar\" to confirm Styles' and Vilmer's involvement. West and Hardy then offer Osborne a job."}

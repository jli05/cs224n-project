A BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n          It is dark; we don't see clearly.  a man and woman make love \n          on a brass bed.  There are mirrors on the walls and ceiling.  \n          On a side table, atop a small mirror, lines of cocaine.  A \n          tape deck PLAYS the Stones \"Sympathy for the Devil.\"\n\n          Atop him... she straddles his chest... her breasts in his face.  \n          He cups her breasts.  She leans down, kisses him...\n\n          JOHNNY BOZ is in his late 40's, slim, good-looking.  We don't \n          see the woman's face.  She has long blonde hair.  The CAMERA \n          STAYS BEHIND and to the side of them.\n\n          She leans close over his face, her tongue in his mouth...  she \n          kisses him... she moves her hands up, holds both of his arms \n          above his head.\n\n          She moves higher atop him... she reaches to the side of the \n          bed... a white silk scarf is in her hand... her hips above his \n          face now, moving... slightly, oh-so slightly... his face strains \n          towards her.\n\n          The scarf in her hand... she ties his hands with it...  \n          gently... to the brass bed... his eyes are closed...  tighter... \n          lowering hips into his face... lower... over his chest... his \n          navel.  The SONG plays.\n\n          He is inside her... his head arches back... his throat white.\n\n          She arches her back... her hips grind... her breasts are high...\n\n          Her back arches back... back... her head tilts back... she \n          extends her arms... the right arm comes down suddenly...  the \n          steel flashes... his throat is white...\n\n          He bucks, writhes, bucks, convulses...\n\n          It flashes up... it flashes down... and up... and down...  and \n          up... and...\n\n          EXT.

HIS POLICE CAR\n\n          He stays behind her at a safe distance on the winding panoramic \n          highway -- a two-lane mountain road which leads from Stinson \n          Beach into Marin County.\n\n          She suddenly starts speeding up on this dangerous road, cutting \n          in and out, passing cars very fast.\n\n          He has to start cutting around cars to keep up.  This woman \n          really drives.\n\n          He cuts out and can barely pass a car without hitting a Grey \n          Lines Tour Bus head-on.  Close call: sheer drops on either \n          side.\n\n          He looks frazzled.\n\n          INT. HIS POLICE CAR\n\n          He is behind her at a distance on a hilly Mill Valley road -- \n          little streets, terraced hillsides, sharp turns.\n\n          He goes slowly, looks around, thinks he's lost her.  And then \n          he sees the black Ferrari parked in front of a house obscured \n          by hedges.\n\n          He parks the car a distance behind the Ferrari, sits there a \n          long beat.  He gets out, goes carefully up to the hedges, looks.  \n          A small, nondescript house.  He watches.  He can't see anything \n          inside the house.\n\n          A beat, he reaches over to the mailbox and opens it.  He takes \n          an envelope out, looks at the name Hazel Dobkins.\n\n          INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT\n\n          He watches as she comes out of the house.  A frail old woman \n          in her 70's is with her.  She hugs the old woman, gets into \n          the Ferrari, STARTS it up.\n\n          He waits a beat and then STARTS after her.  He stays behind \n          her at a distance -- she is going slowly.  And then she suddenly \n          GUNS it, cuts her lights -- her wheels SCREECH.\n\n          He GUNS his car after her.  He makes a turn.  She is gone.\n\n          There is a fork in the road.  He turns one way, goes a few \n          hundred feet.\n\n          Nothing.  Blackness.  He stops.\n\n                                    NICK\n                               (quietly)\n                        Shit.\n\n          INT. HIS POLICE CAR - NIGHT\n\n          He pulls his car up to her house at Stinson Beach.  The black \n          Ferrari is in the driveway.\n\n          A light goes on in an upstairs bedroom.  The curtain is drawn.  \n          He sees the outline of her body now.\n\n          She starts to take her clothes off -- there in the window, \n          behind the curtain.  He watches her body as she does an almost \n          languorous strip.  His eyes are intense... ravishing.\n\n          INT. THE DETECTIVE BUREAU - NIGHT\n\n          He is alone, nobody else in the big room.\n\n          He sits in front of a computer.  We see the screen.  He has \n          punched in\n\n          HAZEL DOBKINS, WF, 145 ALBION RD., MILL VALLEY.\n\n          He is waiting for a response.  We see it come on screen\n\n          NOTHING CURRENT.\n\n          A long beat, as he stares at the screen, and then we see these \n          words\n\n          RELEASED, SAN QUENTIN, JULY 7, 1965.\n\n          We see him type in the words\n\n          PRIOR ARREST RECORD.\n\n          A long beat, and then it comes up\n\n          HOMICIDE, JANUARY 10, 1956 - SAN FRANCISCO\n\n          He stares at the screen a long beat.\n\n                                    GUS\n                               (behind him)\n                        Ain't you go nothin' better to do \n                        than to come in here and jack off \n                        the damn machine?\n\n                                    NICK\n                               (after a beat; lost \n                               in his thoughts)\n                        What are you doing here, Pop?\n\n                                    GUS\n                               (grins)\n                        I came in here to jack off the \n                        damn machine.\n                               (a beat)\n                        One dead psychology professor.\n                        Noah Goldstein.

He was her \n                        counselor.\n\n          Nick looks at him a beat.\n\n                                    NICK\n                        Was she ever suspect?\n\n                                    GUS\n                        No, sir.  They never even got a \n                        statement from her.\n\n          Nick sits back a long beat, his eyes off somewhere.\n\n                                    NICK\n                               (slowly)\n                        Do you remember a case -- 1956 --\n                        Hazel Dobkins?\n\n                                    GUS\n                               (grins)\n                        Hell yes!

He got for a wedding present.  \n                        Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as \n                        honey.  Said she didn't know why \n                        she done it.\n\n          Nick just stares at him.\n\n          EXT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE - NEXT DAY\n\n          He pulls up to the house, gets out of his unmarked police car.  \n          He stands there a beat, thinking.  He walks down to the beach \n          entrance of the house.  He hears a Rolling Stones SONG playing \n          inside.  He stands there.  The door suddenly opens.  Catherine \n          stands there, smiles.  She wears very tight-fitting spandex \n          leotards.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        Hi.\n\n          He looks at her a beat, then --\n\n                                    NICK\n                        Am I... disturbing you?\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        No.  Come in.\n\n          They have their eyes on each other.  A beat, and she turns to \n          go in.\n\n          INT. THE STINSON BEACH HOUSE\n\n          She goes in ahead of him -- he follows her inside.  He watches \n          her body.  His movements are tentative, off-balance.  She turns \n          the Stones DOWN.\n\n          On a table by the window, he sees a word processor.  Spread \n          around it are newspaper clippings.  They are all about him.\n\n          We see the headline on one KILLER COP TO FACE POLICE REVIEW.  \n          She sees him glancing at the clips.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        I'm using you for my detective.  \n                        In my book.  You don't mind, do \n                        you?\n\n          She smiles.  He looks at her, expressionless.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        Would you like a drink?  I was \n                        just going to have one.\n\n                                    NICK\n                        No, thanks.\n\n          She goes to the bar.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                               (smiles)\n                        That's right.  You're off the Jack \n                        Daniels too, aren't you?\n\n          She is making herself a drink.  She takes the ice out and then \n          opens a drawer and gets an icepick.  It has a fat wooden end.  \n          She uses the icepick on the ice, her back to him.  He watches \n          her.\n\n                                    NICK\n                        I'd like to ask you a few more \n                        questions.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        I'd like to ask you some, too.\n\n          She turns to him, icepick in hand, smiles.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        For my book.\n\n          She turns back to the ice, works on it with the pick.  She \n          raises her arm, plunges it.  Raises it, plunges it.  He watches \n          her.\n\n                                    NICK\n                               (wary)\n                        What kind of questions?\n\n          She puts the icepick down, pours herself a drink, turns to \n          him.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        How does it feel to kill someone?\n\n          He looks at her a long beat.\n\n                                    NICK\n                               (finally)\n                        You tell me.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        I don't know.

Nicky \n                        liked it.\n\n          He twists her arm back behind her -- their bodies are pressed \n          against each other -- their eyes digging into each other.\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                               (in a whisper)\n                        That's why she killed herself?\n\n          He is twisting her arm, staring at her, pulling her against \n          him.  We hear the DOOR behind them.  A beat, and he lets her \n          go, turns away from her.\n\n          Roxy stands there, staring at them.  Her hair is up.

She is dancing with another \n          woman.  He watches her.  She is wearing pants and a jacket, \n          her hair off to the side.  She looks very masculine tonight.\n\n          Roxy laughs at the other woman, leaves her on the floor, starts \n          moving through the sea of dancers.  He follows her through the \n          press of bodies.  She goes towards the men's room.  She walks \n          in.\n\n          INT. THE MEN'S ROOM\n\n          It is large, dark, shadowy It was once the sacristy.\n\n          A crowd scene men and women. Roxy presses through them.\n\n          A haze of crack smoke; we see people doing poppers.\n\n          She opens the door to a toilet stall, walks in.  Nick is behind \n          her.  As the door opens, he sees Catherine.\n\n          She wears a black motorcycle jacket, a very short skirt, \n          stiletto heels.  Her hair is up.  He make-up is severe,  In \n          the darkness, in the shadows she looks about 19.  A hot 19.\n\n          A hot flash-trash 19.\n\n          She is in there with two men -- one of them is a big, body-\n          built black guy.  She has a vial of something near her face.\n\n          She sees Nick watching her.  She whispers something to the \n          tall black guy.  He looks at Nick, smiles a condescending smile.  \n          The door to the stall closes\n\n          INT. THE CLUB\n\n          He is walking along the side, watching the floor, a drink in \n          his hand.  The song ends and it seques right into the Stones's \n          \"Miss You.\"\n\n          He sees her.  Her black leather jacket is off.\n\n          She wears a very tight, flimsy top, the short skirt, the heels.  \n          She is dancing with Roxy and the black guy.  He watches her \n          move... watches her body.\n\n          She turns, sees him, dances, watches him... gets between Roxy \n          and the black guy... they sandwich her with their bodies... \n          keeps moving, turning... eyes on him... playing to him with \n          her body.  He watches.\n\n          A long beat, and he goes up to them.  His movements are\n\n          almost trance-like.  They look at each other.  A long beat.\n\n          Catherine stops dancing.  he reaches for her.  She moves away.  \n          A beat their eyes are on each other.  She moves a step towards \n          her.  A beat, as they look at each other...  and they start to \n          move together.\n\n          Their eyes are on each other as they move, the eyes burning... \n          the movements tighter, hotter... and he suddenly grabs her and \n          kisses her... as they keep moving... the song seques into the \n          Stones's \"Gimme Shelter.\"\n\n          She is melting into him now, kissing him... Tex watches, \n          expressionless... the black guy is gone... he holds her by the \n          back of the neck, kissing her... their bodies pressed into \n          each other... his hands are on her butt now, pulling her into \n          him now, almost holding her up now... and then under her skirt, \n          under her panties... as he kisses her neck.\n\n          People around them stare... he moves his hands under her top \n          as she keeps moving with the song, her head back, her back \n          almost arching... cups her breasts now... she keeps moving...  \n          the song sweeping them into its rhythm \"it's just a shot away, \n          it's just a kiss away, a kiss away...\"\n\n          They devour each other.  Right there on the floor.  Barely \n          able to hold it back.  As Tex watches expressionless.  As people \n          stop dancing and stare.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n          INT. HER BEDROOM\n\n          It is dark.

HIS PORSCHE\n\n          He GUNS it down the alley, makes a wild turn in the direction \n          the Ferrari turned.\n\n          EXT. THE STREET\n\n          The Porsche dodges around cars very fast, almost side-swiping \n          them, looking almost out of control, its MOTOR screaming.\n\n          INT. THE PORSCHE\n\n          He sees the Ferrari turn ahead.  When he gets to where it \n          turned, he turns wildly.\n\n          EXT. THE STREET\n\n          The Ferrari is making fast, wild turns into little streets in \n          North Beach, its MOTOR screaming -- the Porsche is gaining \n          ground behind it, making turns.\n\n          INT. THE PORSCHE\n\n          The Ferrari is up ahead and makes a wild right turn onto a \n          road going up a hillside.  He yanks the wheel hard.\n\n          EXT. THE STEPS\n\n          The Porsche rockets up the steps -- bouncing high into the \n          air, almost out of control.                                                                     \n\n          INT.

THE STREET\n\n          But it lands on more steps -- heading downward -- bucking, \n          almost spinning, it bounces onto the next street.\n\n          INT. THE PORSCHE\n\n          Another set of steps leading up he GUNS it, it rockets up, \n          ROARS, bucking --\n\n          EXT. THE STREET\n\n          And lands on the next street.  Nick makes a wild right turn \n          onto the street.  And the black Ferrari appears from around a \n          curve to the right, heading right for him.\n\n          INT. THE PORSCHE\n\n          Nick steps on the GAS and heads head-on for the Ferrari.\n\n          The Ferrari SCREAMS head-on for him.\n\n          EXT. THE STREET\n\n          And at the last moment, in the game of chicken, the Ferrari \n          tries to swerve around him on this narrow road, goes out of \n          control and over the side, turning over and over as it rolls \n          down the hillside.\n\n          EXT. THE HILLSIDE\n\n          The Ferrari has landed right-side up.\n\n          He runs down the hillside and gets to it.

A long beat, then --\n\n                                    CATHERINE\n                        What do we do now, Nick?\n\n                                    NICK\n                               (after a long beat)\n                        We fuck like minks.

Her right arm dangles over the right side \n          of the bed.  Her right hand is clenched.  Is she holding \n          something in it against her arm?\n\n          We see them from an ANGLE to the left side of the bed now: He \n          turns his body away from her to put out his cigarette.\n\n          We see her behind him slowly turning towards him and the CAMERA.  \n          A beat, and he turns towards her.\n\n          They look at each other.  A long beat as the SONG gets louder.  \n          We see them in CLOSEUP.

The CAMERA BACKS AWAY from them \n          slowly to the right side of the bedroom as they kiss, and we --\n\n                                                              FADE TO BLACK\n\n          ...

And then the \n          CAMERA LOWERS SLOWLY as they kiss with more and more passion.\n\n          It keeps going LOWER.\n\n          There is something under the bed.  The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER \n          towards it as \"SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL\" plays louder.  We see \n          it now in CLOSEUP as the bed rustles above...\n\n          It is a thin, steel-handled icepick.\n\n          The SONG plays LOUDER and LOUDER, and we --\n\n                                                                   FADE OUT\n\n                                     THE END\n\n\n\n\nBasic Instinct\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Joe Eszterhas\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb", "summary": "A retired rock star, Johnny Boz, is stabbed to death with an ice pick during sex by a mysterious blonde woman at his apartment. Homicide detective Nick Curran investigates, and the only suspect is Catherine Tramell, Boz's bisexual girlfriend and a crime novelist who has written a novel that mirrors the crime. It is concluded that Catherine herself did it or someone who is trying to frame her out of spite. Tramell is uncooperative and taunting in the investigation, smoking in the interrogation room and exposing her bare genitalia in front of the officers. She presents alibis and passes a lie detector test. Nick discovers that Catherine has a habit of befriending murderers, including her girlfriend Roxy, who is later shown to have murdered several young boys on impulse, and Hazel Dobkins, who murdered her family.\nNick, who accidentally shot two tourists while high on cocaine, attends counseling sessions with police psychologist Dr. Beth Garner, with whom he has had an affair. Nick discovers that Catherine plans on using him as a fictional detective in her latest book, wherein his character is murdered after falling for the wrong woman. Catherine becomes aware of Nick's past after paying Lt. Nielsen to look into Nick's psychiatric file; Beth gives it to him after Nielsen recommends Nick's unemployment. Nick publicly assaults Nielsen in his office and later becomes a prime suspect after Nielsen is killed. Nick suspects Catherine, and when he joins in her behavior in front of his co-workers, he is put on leave.\nA torrid affair between Nick and Catherine begins with the air of a cat-and-mouse game. They dance and make out at a club and later have sex in bed. Roxy, who disapproves of Nick's interference, attempts to run him over with Catherine's car but dies in a crash. Catherine seems saddened by Roxy's death and reveals to Nick that a previous lesbian encounter at college went awry when the girl, Lisa Hoberman, became obsessed with her, causing him to believe that she may not have killed Boz. Nick identifies the girl as Beth Garner, who acknowledges the encounter but claims Catherine became obsessed.\nNick discovers the final pages of Catherine's new book in which the fictional detective finds his partner lying dead with his legs protruding from the doors of an elevator. Catherine breaks off their affair; Nick becomes upset and suspicious. Nick later meets his partner Gus, who has arranged to meet with Catherine's college roommate at a hotel to find out what really went on between Catherine and Beth. As Nick waits in the car, Gus is murdered with an ice pick. Nick runs into the building but is too late; he finds Gus' legs protruding from the doors of the elevator. Beth, standing in the hallway, explains she received a message to meet Gus. Nick suspects she murdered Gus and, when he suspects she is reaching for a gun, he shoots her. Nick finds keys in her pocket.\nA search of the scene and Beth's apartment turns up the evidence needed to brand her as the killer. Despite knowing Catherine's foreknowledge of Gus' death, that she must actually have been the killer, and that she must have set Beth up, Nick tells no one. He returns to his apartment where Catherine meets him. She explains her reluctance to commit to him, but the two have sex. As they discuss their future, an ice pick is revealed to be under the bed."}

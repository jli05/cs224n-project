DARK STAGE - NIGHT 1\r\n                         \r\n                          OPENING CREDITS:\r\n                         \r\n           A SPOTLIGHT slices black space.\r\n                         \r\n           In its beam, a DANCER materializes. She is fair-skinned.\r\n           Beautiful and pure.\r\n                         \r\n           The maiden twirls on pointe, a smile on her face, light as\r\n           air and carefree.\r\n                         \r\n           She pauses, her face grows worried. Sensing someone watching.\r\n                         \r\n           Scared, she peers into the darkness.\r\n                         \r\n           She moves now, looking, growing more frantic.\r\n                         \r\n           Then, a SINISTER MAN emerges out of the darkness behind her.\r\n           She stumbles backwards, frightened.\r\n                         \r\n           She tries to escape, twirling away, but he pursues. His true\r\n           form is revealed, the demon ROTHBART.\r\n                         \r\n           He flings his open hand towards her, casting the spell.\r\n                         \r\n           She wants to scream, but nothing comes out. She looks at her\r\n           body, sensing something happening to her. Something\r\n           terrifying.\r\n                         \r\n           She spins, panicking, but it's too late. She disappears\r\n           beneath the beast's cape.\r\n                         \r\n           She emerges as the WHITE SWAN, the iconic protagonist of SWAN\r\n           LAKE.\r\n                         \r\n           CUT TO BLACK.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          2 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 2\r\n                         \r\n           In the darkness, a pair of EYES. They belong to NINA, the\r\n           same dancer. She lies awake in bed, thinking about her dream.\r\n                         \r\n           The room looks like it hasn't been redecorated since she was\r\n           a teenager. Stuffed animals. Dolls. Pink and frilly.\r\n                         \r\n           The door opens, throwing LIGHT on her face. Nina looks\r\n           towards the door and smiles softly at whoever opened it.\r\n                         \r\n           Nina sits up and hangs her BARE FEET off the side of the bed.\r\n           Like all ballerinas, she's beautiful and her feet are\r\n           atrocious. Covered in corns, broken blisters and bunions. She\r\n           arches them, doing her first extensions of the day.\r\n           2.\r\n                         \r\n          3 INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING 3\r\n                         \r\n           The room is empty of furniture to leave space for dancing. A\r\n           large mirror covers the opposite wall entirely.\r\n                         \r\n           Nina rubs her knees to get them warm, and then begins her\r\n           morning exercises, extending and contracting her feet and\r\n           legs in precise and rhythmic motions.\r\n                         \r\n           The skin on her chest stretches tautly over her sternum.\r\n           Defined vertebrae run up her back, sinewy muscles contract as\r\n           she moves. Her slender neck leads into her hair, contained\r\n           in a ballerina's bun.\r\n                         \r\n           Nina looks serene as she moves, completely in her element.\r\n                         \r\n           She hears someone fussing about in the kitchen.\r\n                         \r\n                          NINA\r\n                          (WHILE STRETCHING)\r\n           I had the most amazing dream last\r\n           night.

It was the prologue,\r\n           when Rothbart casts his spell.\r\n                         \r\n           Still no answer.\r\n                         \r\n           Nina continues to stretch.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          4 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 4\r\n                         \r\n           Nina sits at the table. An older woman, ERICA, places a\r\n           POACHED EGG and a QUARTER-GRAPEFRUIT in front of her.\r\n                         \r\n                          ERICA\r\n           You're in a good mood.\r\n                         \r\n                          NINA\r\n           I'm just excited to get back.\r\n                         \r\n                          ERICA\r\n           Off-season always makes you grumpy.\r\n                         \r\n                          NINA\r\n                          (RE: GRAPEFRUIT)\r\n           Look how pink.

SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY 5\r\n                         \r\n           Nina rides inside a crowded subway, staring absentmindedly at\r\n           her faint reflection in the train's window.\r\n                         \r\n           Suddenly, another train roars by on the opposite track,\r\n           snapping her awake.\r\n                         \r\n           In the next train car, she sees the back of a BALLERINA\r\n           standing in the midst of the crowd. Her head bops to music\r\n           playing through iPod earphones.\r\n                         \r\n           Nina moves a strand of hair out of her eyes, and at that\r\n           exact moment, the girl in the next car moves in the same way.\r\n           Mirroring her.\r\n                         \r\n           Unnerved, Nina slowly lowers her arm. So does the other girl.\r\n           Although Nina can't quite see her face, the girl seems\r\n           IDENTICAL from Nina's vantage point.\r\n           4.\r\n                         \r\n           The train jerks to a stop as it arrives at a station. Nina\r\n           sees the girl head to the exit. She cranes to see her face,\r\n           but her view's obscured.\r\n                         \r\n           The doors slide shut and the train pulls out. Nina watches\r\n           the platform whisk by, keeping her eyes peeled, but she\r\n           doesn't see the girl.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         6 OMITTED 6\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          7 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER - DAY 7\r\n                         \r\n           Nina emerges from the subway station onto a city street.\r\n                         \r\n           She arrives at the MAJESTIC-LOOKING THEATER, where a few\r\n           other BALLERINAS likewise trickle towards the entrance. They\r\n           all look strangely similar: slender, carrying shoulder bags,\r\n           wearing leggings and loose sweatshirts.\r\n                         \r\n           She passes a ROW OF POSTERS featuring the company's prima\r\n           ballerina, BETH MACINTYRE.\r\n                         \r\n           Nina looks at them, a little envious, before continuing on to\r\n           the STAGE DOOR.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          8 INT. SOLOIST DRESSING ROOM - DAY 8\r\n                         \r\n           Crammed into a single dressing room, Nina and the company's 5\r\n           SOLOISTS get ready for rehearsal. Chatting, sewing ribbon\r\n           onto shoes, applying makeup, putting band-aids on blisters.\r\n                         \r\n           Nina removes a new pair of BALLET SHOES, admires them for a\r\n           moment, before cutting off the satin toe with scissors.\r\n                         \r\n           In the background, catty VERONICA and Russian GALINA gossip.\r\n                         \r\n                          VERONICA\r\n           Can't believe she's back.\r\n                         \r\n                          GALINA\r\n           Of course she is.\r\n                         \r\n                          VERONICA\r\n           She can't take a hint?

Magnetic and intense.\r\n                         \r\n           The ballerinas remove their warm-up gear to show off their\r\n           bodies.\r\n                         \r\n           Leroy walks around the room, judging his flock.

Preparing for the\r\n           audition.\r\n                         \r\n           A loud CRASHING sound snaps her out of it.\r\n                         \r\n           She goes out into the hallway to investigate.\r\n                         \r\n           The door to a PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM is halfway open.

A TOY\r\n          BALLERINA spins to TINNY MUSIC.\r\n                         \r\n          Nina gets under the covers.

The jerky motion of the train makes it\r\n           difficult, but she manages.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          22 INT.

As a reward, he is made Governor of Jamaica, with a mandate to rid the Caribbean of his former comrades, by persuasion or force if necessary. He replaces the former governor, Lord Denby (George Zucco), but is not trusted by either the lawful residents or the pirates.\nCaptain Jamie Waring (Tyrone Power) and his lieutenant, Tom Blue (Thomas Mitchell), reluctantly give up their \"trade\" out of friendship for Morgan, but others of the Pirate Brotherhood, such as Captain Billy Leech (George Sanders) and Wogan (Anthony Quinn), refuse to change. Meanwhile, Waring takes a liking to Denby's daughter, Lady Margaret (Maureen O'Hara), who happens to be inconveniently engaged to an English gentleman, Roger Ingram (Edward Ashley). As it turns out, her fianc\u00e9 is secretly providing information about ship sailings to the unrepentant pirates.\nWhen Morgan is unable to stop the depredations of his old shipmates, he is suspected of still being allied with them. It is up to Waring to set sail to get to the bottom of things (kidnapping Lady Margaret in the process so she won't be able to marry Ingram)."}

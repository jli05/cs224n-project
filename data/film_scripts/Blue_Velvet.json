If that\n\t\t\tgoes well, we'll see about the rest.

He flies inside it and is swinging the door shut as the front \ndoor opens.\n\nJust as suddenly, the toilet tank gets full and the water shuts off - \nSILENCE, except for Dorothy Vallens at the front door.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY (V.O.)\n\t\t\t\t(we're watching Jeffrey trying to \n  \t\t\t\t control frightened breathing in\n\t\t\t  the dark closet)\n\t\t\tThanks Jimmy, see you tomorrow. You want a\n\t\t\tdrink, or something?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJIMMY (V.O.)\n\t\t\tI better get back. thanks anyway.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tGoodnight.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJIMMY\n\t\t\tGoodnight now.\n\nThe front door shuts and the living room lights go on.  Jeffrey can see \nDorothy come toward him.  She walks RIGHT UP, almost to his face, when \nthe phone RINGS.\n\nShe turns immediately and goes to answer it.  Jeffrey almost passes out. \nHe thought he'd had it.  He overhears.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t    (on the phone)\n\t\t\tHello. yes. yes sir, Frank. Let me\n\t\t\ttalk to him. Please Frank, sir. I like\n\t\t\tto sing Blue Velvet. Don? It's okay.\n\t\t\tDon't worry. Don??. can you hear me?\n\t\t\tIs little Donny OK? Is he there? Don? You\n\t\t\tmean Meadow Lane? Frank?! What's the\n\t\t\tmatter with him? I know. When? Okay. In\n\t\t\tan hour. I'll be sweet. Momma loves you.\n\t\t\tOkay Frank, sir.\n\nShe hangs up the phone hard and puts her head in her hands.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t    (to herself)\n\t\t\tFrank, you son of a bitch!\n\nShe goes and sits down and starts chewing a fingernail.  She nervously \ngets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides \nthe photograph under a pillow on the couch.  She puts on a record, \"FOR \nYOUR PRECIOUS LOVE.\"  She sits back down and chews her nail again, \nlistening to the MUSIC; she starts to cry.  She stops herself and takes \nthe record off.  She starts taking off her stocking.  She then takes off \nher dress.\n\nUnderneath, she has on a bra and panties.  She crosses the living room, \ngoes down the hallway into the bathroom.\n\nJeffrey can't see her too well now.  She takes off her panties in the \nbathroom.  She is now naked.  She looks at herself in the mirror.  We see \nJeffrey's face as he watches her.  She disappears from view completely and \nwe HEAR her start a SHOWER.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\n91. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nJeffrey's face.  He sees Dorothy - in a towel - come toward him again.  \nHe quickly moves back into the closet as far as he can.\n\nShe opens the door, reaches in and gets a blue velvet robe.  She doesn't \nsee Jeffrey even though he isn't well hidden.  She closes the door.  It \nCLICKS shut.\n\nJeffrey is in almost total darkness.  He listens.  He can HEAR WALKING \naround, then silence.  He hears the kitchen sink WATER RUNNING.\n\nHe HEARS her WALKING AGAIN.  Now he can see her.  She sits down on her \nbed.  She looks up.  Just as Jeffrey shifts his weight.  She looks at the\ncloset strangely, but then calmly picks up a book and thumbs through it.  \nShe slowly gets up.\n\nJeffrey doesn't know what is up.  He looks but she walks out of view.\n\nSUDDENLY, he hears a DRAWER OPEN, and just as suddenly, the CLOSET DOOR \nFLIES OPEN, and there she is with a pistol pointed right at him.  When \nshe realizes that SOMEONE IS REALLY THERE, she SCREAMS ONCE, very loud.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t (crazy scream, then)\n\t\t\tGET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your\n\t\t\thands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down\n\t\t\ton your knees - DO IT!! What are you \n\t\t\tdoing? Who are you?

Jeffrey what?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tJeffrey nothing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tYou tell me!! Let me see that wallet.\n\t\t\t\t (reads his license)\n\t\t\tJeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in\n\t\t\tmy apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tI wanted to see you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tWhat? Are you kidding me? Who sent you \n\t\t\there?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tNobody.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tShit. You better tell me something.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tI was. an experiment. Just to see if\n\t\t\tI could do it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tAn experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tI sprayed your apartment. I took your key.\n\t\t\tI really didn't mean to do anything but \n\t\t\tsee you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tTell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\t\t (scared, nervous)\n\t\t\t. I saw you come in, talk on the phone.\n\t\t\tget undressed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t   (interrupting)\n\t\t\tThe phone. What did you hear on the phone\n\t\t\t. Tell me. Word for word.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\t\t (trying to remember)\n\t\t\tYou said hello. to Frank. You wanted to \n\t\t\ttalk to someone?. Don?. and little Donny.\n\t\t\tYou said something about Momma loves you.\n\t\t\tand something about a Meadow Lane.\n\t\t\tsomething in an hour. I don't remember\n\t\t\tany more.\n\nDorothy stares at Jeffrey studying him for some time thinking.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tThat's right. That's what I said. You\n\t\t\thave a good memory. Then what?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tWell.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tTHEN WHAT?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tThen you got undressed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tHow many times have you sneaked into girls'\n\t\t\tapartments and watched them undress?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\t    (quietly; feeling guilty)\n\t\t\tNever before this.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tHow'd you like it if someone sneaked into\n\t\t\tyour house and watched you.\n\t\t\t\t   (gets an idea)\n\t\t\tGet undressed. I want to see you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tNo. Come on.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tNO, you come on. Take off your pants. I\n\t\t\twant to see you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tLook. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tNo way.\n\nDorothy moves to the kitchen counter and gets a knife.  She goes to \nJeffrey.  Now she has a knife and a gun.  He's scared.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tGet undressed. I want to see you.\n\nJeffrey begins to undress. First he takes off his shoes and socks, \nThen his shirt.  He undoes his belt and unzips his pants and takes them \noff.  Now he is only in his underwear.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tSTAND UP.\n\nHe does.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t    (continuing)\n\t\t\tCome closer.\n\nDorothy has a strange look on her face.  She reaches out and pulls \nJeffrey's underpants down to his knees.  She looks at him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t    (whispering)\n\t\t\tWhat do you want from me?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\t   (quietly, getting very hot)\n\t\t\tI . I don't know.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t    (whispering)\n\t\t\tWhat do you want?\n\nDorothy is getting very DREAMY and begins to talk in a childlike voice.  \nShe opens her robe and pulls Jeffrey to her breasts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tDon't move. don't look at me.\n\nJeffrey's eyes close with nervous ecstasy as Dorothy begins touching him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tDo you like that?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tYes.\n\nHe tries to touch her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tDon't move or I'll kill you.\n\nShe looks at him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t   (continuing)\n\t\t\tDo you like talk like that?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tLie down on the bed.\n\nHe lies down.  He looks frightened.\n\nThere's a KNOCK, KNOCK on the door.  Dorothy looks VERY frightened.  She \nquickly moves a finger to her lips in a \"quiet\" sign and whispers to \nJeffrey.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t (whispers, frantic)\n\t\t\tShut up. Hurry! Go in the closet. Don't\n\t\t\tsay anything or you'll get killed. I mean\n\t\t\tit.\n\nKNOCKING is heard louder at the door.  Jeffrey picks up all his clothes \nand gets in the closet.  He's naked and hiding in the closet.  Dorothy \ncloses her robe and glides to the front door.\n\nJeffrey sees FRANK come in.\n\nFrank is medium height and stocky with a burr hair cut.  He is wearing a \ntight blue t-shirt and an old black sports jacket.  He's got on a pair of \nblue jeans and boots.  He has a raw, mean sexuality - a \"bomb about to go \noff\" - presence. \n\nHe comes into the room slowly, always looking at Dorothy.  He sits on the \ncouch.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tHello, baby.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n                      (annoyed, condescending)\n\t\t\tShut up. It's daddy. shithead.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tHello, daddy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t  (can't-you-remember-\n\t\t\t   anything-attitude)\n\t\t\t. my bourbon.\n\nDorothy goes into the kitchen to get Frank his drink.  As she passes the \ncloset, Jeffrey can see the fear in her face.\n\nShe returns with a small glass of bourbon and hands it to Frank.  Frank \nsips on it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t. sit down. get your chair.\n\nDorothy brings a small chair over from the wall and sits down.  She \nadjusts her robe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t\t (studying her)\n\t\t\t. spread your legs.\n\nDorothy slowly spreads her legs.  She can see Jeffrey staring out of the \ndarkness of the closet at her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\twider.\n\nShe opens her legs wider.  Frank looks at her crotch and drinks his \nbourbon.  He stares at the floor for a moment, then slowly looks back at \nDorothy, her body - her crotch.\n\nDorothy looks up at the ceiling, waiting.  Frank suddenly reaches to his \nbelt, where he has a small canister and a mask.  He opens a valve on the \ncanister and places the mask over his nose and mouth.  The canister is \nfilled with helium, which makes Frank's voice very high and strange \nsounding.  The result is frightening.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t\t   (high voice)\n\t\t\t. mommy.\n\nDorothy jumps.  She keeps looking at the ceiling.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t   (continuing, with high voice)\n\t\t\t. MOMMY!.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t    (frightened)\n\t\t\t. mommy's here.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t\t  (high voice)\n\t\t\tBaby wants to fuck.\n\nThen, Frank's voice goes to normal.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(normal voice, but loud - like\n    \t\t\t an army order to himself)\n\t\t\tGET READY TO FUCK!\n\nFrank goes to Dorothy and kneels down in front of her.  He takes one more \ngasp of helium.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t\t   (high voice)\n\t\t\tBaby wants blue velvet.\n\nDorothy opens her robe and gives a part of the robe to Frank.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t   (whispering)\n\t\t\tOkay.\n\nFrank slowly moves\n\nFrank slowly moves his mouth to the robe and runs his lips along the \ntexture of the velvet.  His hands rub the velvet and feel Dorothy's body \nunderneath.  His hands start feeling her breasts as he sucks and bites the \nvelvet robe.\n\nDorothy is very frightened but she is getting hot in spite of her fear.  \nThen Frank, in a sort of sickening way, pulls Dorothy down to rug.  He \nwarns her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\tDon't look at me!\n\nHe begins stuffing part of the robe into her mouth.  Then, he pushes her \narms back and she keeps them back, letting Frank have his way.  Frank \nsucks and bites the velvet coming out of her mouth, while he pinches and \nfeels her breasts in a strange, compulsive, timidly sickening way.  \nDorothy is moaning.  Frank is breathing very heavily. He feels her crotch.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\tDon't look at me!!!\n\t\t\t     (heavy breathing)\n\t\t\tDaddy's home.\n\nHe starts stuffing the robe in his mouth now and he gets on top of Dorothy.\nHe starts humping her and pulling her nude body up and down him.  Faster \nand faster, then he has a climax in his pants.  Dorothy's head is falling \nback.  She can see Jeffrey blurred in the distance - in the closet.  \nCautiously, she looks sideways at Frank.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t\t    (screaming)\n\t\t\tDon't look at me!!!\n\nHe slugs her in the face.  His nose is running and he's stifling sobs from \ndeep within him.  On his hands and knees, he moves away.  The robe pulls \nout of his mouth.  His breathing is even heavier now.  He stands and \nbegins to move around the apartment.  He goes to a wall, turns off the \nlights, then turns and walks into the bathroom, all the while breathing \nbig, heavy breaths, trying to stop the crying.  Dorothy moans softly.\n\nIt gets very quiet and still for a moment.  Then, Jeffrey hears Frank \nwith his high helium voice talking to himself in the bathroom.  The high, \nstrange sound reverberates in the distance.  Jeffrey can't make it out - \nsoon, he hears Frank's high laughing.  Frank comes back into the living \nroom.  The mask is around his face.  All his breathing - every sound is \nhigh . He laughs a little and crosses the darkened room to the door.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\tStay alive baby. See you next Christmas!\n\nFrank leaves and shuts the door.  The apartment is silent except for \nDorothy's moans.  \n\nJeffrey is stunned.  He doesn't move.  He watches Dorothy in the \nhalf-light.  She rolls over and starts crying.  The crying is deep and \ngenuine.\n\nSlowly, Jeffrey emerges from the closet and goes to her.  He bends down \nand touches her.  She flinches and turns to see him.  She turns back \nsobbing.  He tries to get her up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tWhy don't you come lie down. Come on, I'll\n\t\t\thelp you.\n\nShe struggles up with Jeffrey's help and he takes her over to the bed.  \nShe falls down on her side, turned toward the wall.  He covers her with \nthe sheet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tDon't.\n\t\t\t    (referring to the sheet)\n\t\t\tI don't like that. What do you want?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tNothing. Are you alright?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tSure I'm alright.\n\t\t\t   (she starts crying again)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tI'll go then.\n\nHe starts to put on his underwear.  They're inside out.  He tries to turn \nthem around.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tDon?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tDon. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me.\n\t\t\tPlease.\n\nJeffrey turns to her.  He studies her.  He reaches out and takes her \nshoulders.  He moves down and holds her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t    (whispering)\n\t\t\tThank you. honey.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\t\t    (whispering)\n\t\t\tIt's okay. It's okay.\n\nThey lie together for a long silent moment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tDo you like the way I feel?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\t\t    (hesitates)\n\t\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tSee my breasts?  . See?\n\nJeffrey looks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tSee my nipples?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t    (whispering)\n\t\t\tYou can kiss them if you want. Fell them\n\t\t\t. They're getting hard.\n\nJeffrey starts to move closer.  Dorothy closes her eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t    (continuing)\n\t\t\tGo ahead. I don't mind.\n\nJeffrey can't help himself.  He licks and sucks her nipples and feels her \nbreasts.  They both are getting very hot.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tFeel me.\n\nJeffrey is all over her now.  Dorothy suddenly seems to recognize him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tYou can hit me, if you want to.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tNo. please. I won't.\n\nDorothy arches back and whining she throws her head back hard against the \nwall.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tStop it!\n\nShe moves and won't let him feel her anymore.  She holds his hands away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t    (whispering)\n\t\t\tDo you like me?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\t\t    (whispering)\n\t\t\tYes, I like you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t    (whispering)\n\t\t\tYou can be my special friend and come and\n\t\t\tput that in me.\n\nThey start making love.  Suddenly, Dorothy starts crying.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tWhat's the matter?\n\nSuddenly Dorothy slaps Jeffrey in the face. very hard.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tGet off me.\n\nJeffrey gets off her, pressing his hand to his face.  Dorothy goes into \nthe bathroom crying all the way.  Jeffrey sits, confused.\n\nSuddenly Jeffrey hears a horrible scream from Dorothy.  A true scream of \nhorror.  He rushes into the bathroom to see what is wrong.\n\n92. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nShe is just flushing something down the toilet.  The water SOUND rushes.  \nHe turns to her.  She is trembling and in a state of shock.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tI made it go down the toilet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tWhat?\n\nHe looks in the swirling water. It looks like an ear revolving around and \naround then whatever it is disappears.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tI made it go down the toilet.\n\nJeffrey looks up. he sees written with a bar of soap the words \"look down\" \non the mirror.\n\nHe looks down into the sink.  At the bottom he sees a small clot of blood \nand a smear of fresher blood.\n\nJeffrey suddenly remembers mentally Frank's high helium voice reverberating\nin the bathroom.\n\n93. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nFLASHBACK\n\nFrank in bathroom.\n\n94. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nFLASHBACK\n\nFrank at door saying \"see you next Christmas.\"\n\n95. INT.

He takes \nanother look at the beautiful dark troubled eyes of Dorothy Vallens, and \nturns, goes through the hall to the living room.  He crosses slowly to the \ndoor, suddenly he turns back and enters the hallway going down to the \nbathroom.  He stops and looks at Dorothy who is turned away from him.  \nShe stares into the sink.  Jeffrey notices that a square of fabric has \nbeen cut from the bottom of her blue velvet robe\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tI'm leaving now.\n\nShe is whispering something to herself.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t (very faint whisper)\n\t\t\tHelp me. help me. please help me.\n\nJeffrey doesn't know what he can do.\n\n96. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nJeffrey turns back, goes through the living room.  He looks around and \nsees the empty bourbon glass of Frank's.  Suddenly he remembers the \nphotograph that Dorothy hid.  He picks up the pillow and sees a picture \nof a smiling man and a small boy standing next to him wearing a pointed \nhat with a propeller. He turns the photo over and finds an old marriage \nlicense.  It reads: Dorothy Vallens to Don.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY (V.O.)\n\t\t\tDon. Oh my God.\n\nHe hides the photo again.  He sees Dorothy's telephone.  He memorizes the \nnumber - moving his lips with each digit.  He goes to the front door and \nopens it quietly.\n\n97. EXT.

LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT\n\n. and comes out, crosses a lawn and goes out onto the sidewalk.\n\nHe walks along taking in deep cleansing breaths.  He looks at his watch.  \n2:30.

He shakes his head.\n\n101. INT. BEAUMONTS' HARDWARE STORE - DAY\n\nJeffrey's drinking a cup of coffee behind the counter in the store.  \nHe thinks.  He takes another drink of coffee and sets the cup down.  \nHe clasps his hands behind his back and begins pacing up and down.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\t\t(to himself, out loud)\n\t\t\tHow can I help her? I can't tell her to go\n\t\t\tto Detective Williams. She'll think I'm a\n\t\t\tpoliceman. She has my address. She can go\t\n\t\t\tthere. if she has to.

GYNDE\n\t\t\tYes.\n\nThe BLOOD is seen in CLOSEUP. Cells are moving.\n\nThe Doctor makes a change in magnification.  The cells are huge - then, \neven bigger.  They are so big we can hear them moving.\n\n103. EXT. \"SLOW CLUB\" - NIGHT\n\nThe parking lot is half-full.  A strong wind is blowing trash around.  \nJeffrey parks his car.\n\n104.

It is very dark and \nsmoky inside.  He has trouble seeing, but suddenly he spots Frank sitting \nwith some other GUYS watching Dorothy sing.  They are sitting two tables \naway.\n\nFrank is totally captivated by Dorothy's singing and is very serious-\nlooking.  He looks right up to her eyes.  In his hand he works a small \npiece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers.  Again her first number, \n\"BLUE MOON,\" segues into \"BLUE VELVET.\"  This song she sings mainly to \nFrank.  When it is over Frank continues watching Dorothy and everyone else \napplauds loudly.\n\nJeffrey drinks up his Heineken and goes back outside.\n\nEXT. \"SLOW CLUB\" - NIGHT\n\nHe looks around at all the cars but none stand out as Frank's.

EXT. \"SLOW CLUB\" - NIGHT\n\nTraffic roars past Jeffrey and in the distance several people exit the \nSLOW CLUB.  Among them are Frank and his friends.

He has to gun the car \nup to sixty-five to catch up with them.\n\n107. EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT\n\nThe mysterious MUSIC plays.\n\nHe follows them to an intersection where they turn off to the right.  \nHe waits at a light right behind them.

He follows them up a narrow \nstreet through dark factories.\n\n108. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT\n\nDark, low MUSIC now.\n\nUp ahead, Frank parks his car.  Jeffrey quickly pulls over and kills his \nlights and engine.  He watches Frank and his friends enter an old apartment\nbuilding next to a bookbinding factory.  They disappear within.  The \nelectric lines above buzz loudly.\n\nJeffrey gets out of his car and walks up the deserted street.  He reaches \nFrank's car which is making popping and clicking NOISES as it cools down.  \nHe looks at the license plates - walks a few paces ahead and then writes it\ndown in his notebook.  He continues on to the apartment building.\n\n109. \tINT. LOBBY - FRANK'S BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nInside he looks at the names on the mailboxes.  He sees a name - Frank \nBooth.  The name gives him the chills.  The apartment number is 26.\n\nIn the distance, he hears footsteps.  He quickly leaves.\n\n110. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT\n\n. and crosses the street down to his car.  He gets in and waits.

There is a roar of thunder as Frank slams his car \ndoor as he gets in.  His mouth twists into a smile as he guns the engine \nand leaves.  Jeffrey waits till Frank is safely gone.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\t       (thinking out loud)\n\t\t\tI shouldn't go in. I shouldn't. but I'm\n\t\t\ttoo curious. and I have to try to help her.\n\nHe then gets out of his car as the wind is building.\n\n115. EXT.

Dorothy goes to the door and opens it.\nIt's the Man with the Yellow Sports Coat - tonight he's wearing a purple \nsports coat and light blue double knit pants.  His eyes are glazed and his \nface is broken out in a sweat.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYELLOW MAN\n\t\t\tFrank gone?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\tYeah. but get outta here.

ROOFTOP - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nThe storm is closer and the dark clouds move violently in front of a full \nmoon.  The wind continues to moan.  They move to the roof top and Dorothy \nleads Jeffrey through the chimneys to the edge of the building.  A very \nsad forlorn version of \"Somewhere over the Rainbow\" - creeps through the \nwind.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t\t (as she stares down)\n\t\t\tLook.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\t\t(turning to her quickly)\n\t\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t\t(continuing to look down, her\n    \t\t\t eyes widening - she whispers)\nFalling.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tNo. Please, Dorothy.

Don!!!\n\t\t\t\t(as she slams her head \n        \t\t\t again and again)\n\nShe reaches up and clutches Jeffrey then pulls him down with a feverish \nkiss.  Lightening cracks above them and the wind howls.\n\nFADE TO WHITE:\n\nFADE DOWN TO:\n\n121. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT\n\nJeffrey leaves the pool of light from a street light and walks into \ndarkness.  He continues down the sidewalk.

Very close.\nThere is a slow low reverberating chirping sound.\n\n121C.\n\nNow Dorothy's apartment building at night.  A very low angle looking up \nto the roof.  Suddenly a pinpoint of red appears coming toward us from \nthe roof.  It flies toward us very fast growing larger until we see it is \na red high-heeled shoe.  As it fills the screen it becomes red lips of \nDorothy's which open into a scream.\n\n121D.\n\nJeffrey wakes in his room - terrified.\n\n122. INT.

She reaches down.\n\nIn EXTREME CLOSEUP we see a termite walking by her shoe on the thick \ncarpet.  Then in EXTREME CLOSEUP we see Aunt Barbara's fingers pinch the \ntermite and bring it up in front of her thick glasses for a look.  She \nlooks at the termite, then looks back at the walls.\n\nWe GLIDE ALONG the dark walls of the house.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n123. INT.

He looks back once and \nsees the well-dressed man hurrying up the stairs.\n\nCLOSEUP on well-dressed man's face. It is Frank, underneath a very good \ndisguise.\n\nJeffrey has trouble getting the key out of his pocket.  He fumbles with it\nand it drops to the floor.\n\nFrank climbs the stairs.\n\nFinally the key goes in and Jeffrey frantically opens the door.  He rushes\ninto the room.\n\n220. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe horror and strangeness of the scene within strikes him again.  He \nrushes to the Yellow Man and takes the police radio out of his pocket.  \nHe runs into the back of the apartment - to the back bedroom where he \ncrouches down behind a double bed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\t\t  (into the radio)\n\t\t\tDetective Williams!! Detective Williams!!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE WILLIAMS\n\t\t\t\t         (over radio)\n\t\t\tDetective Williams here. Is that you,\n\t\t\tJeffrey?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tYes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up \n\t\t\tto Dorothy's apartment.\n\t\t\t     (thinks; hits himself in the\n                              forehead; inner voice)\n                        Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing\n                        everything we say!!\n\t\t\t      (thinks some more - fast)\n\t\t\tDetective Williams. hurry. I'm in the \n\t\t\tapartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back\n\t\t\tbedroom.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE WILLIAMS\n\t\t\tWe're ten minutes away and moving as fast\n\t\t\tas we can.\n\n221. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT\n\nSandy runs frantically down a dark street.  We see a street sign which \nsays \"Lincoln.\"\n\n222. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nJeffrey drops the radio under the bed and runs back to the living room.  \nHe leaps safely into the closet just as Frank opens the apartment door and\nenters.  Jeffrey freezes with fear in the darkness of the closet.  Frank \nis smiling.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t (calling pleasantly in the direction \n  of the back bedroom)\n\t\t\tHey neighbor. shit for brains. You forgot\n\t\t\tI have a police radio. I know where your\n\t\t\tcute little butt is hiding. Here I come!\n\t\t\tReady or not!\n\nHe starts down the hall to the back bedroom.  The police radio which \nJeffrey planted under the bed and Frank's radio both start broadcasting. \nFrank turns his radio off - now only the one under the bed plays.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\tHey fuck. I can hear you radio! .Hey\n\t\t\tyou stupid fuck. you got about a \n\t\t\tsecond to live.\n\nJeffrey watches Frank reach inside his coat for his gun.  He watches Frank\nsneak to the back bedroom area.  Jeffrey turns and looks at the Yellow \nMan.  He gets an idea. He quickly rushes out of the closet - feels inside \nthe Yellow Man's coat for his police gun.  It's there.  He gets it but it \ncauses the Yellow Man to moan and leap some in another almost death-spasm.  Jeffrey takes the bloody pistol and races back inside the closet frantically catching his breath.  Just then he hears Frank in the back room.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK (V.O.)\n\t\t\t           (helium voice)\n\t\t\tHey pretty pretty.\n\nJeffrey then hears three or four shots - deadly sounding coming from a \npistol with a silencer attached.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFRANK (V.O.)\n\t\t\tHey fuck, where are you?\n\nJeffrey sees a furious Frank come storming out of the back room and come \nslowly up the hall - directly toward him.\n\nJeffrey raises his pistol - very slowly.  Frank enters the living room.  \nHe looks around.  The Yellow Man moans.  Frank makes a face and blasts the \nremainder of the Yellow Man's head away and this time the Yellow Man falls\ndead to the floor.  Jeffrey tenses in the silence which hangs in the air.  Frank looks to the kitchen. all around the living room.  He looks at the closet.  He smiles - he slowly goes right toward Jeffrey - smiling.  Jeffrey points the pistol.  His finger moves to the trigger.  He squints his eyes.  He doesn't want to kill a man. any man.  Frank comes right to the closet door and throws it open, when Jeffrey hears Sandy scream.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANDY (V.O.)\n\t\t\tJeffrey!!\n\nFrank and Jeffrey lock eyes as Jeffrey pulls the trigger.  He yells Sandy's\nname and Frank's head is blown off.\n\nWe see Sandy's frightened face.  We see policemen racing up the stairs in \nDorothy's apartment.\n\n223. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nWe see cop cars with lights revolving, radios blaring.\n\n224. INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT\n\nThe large room is crowded with policemen and members of the F.B.I.  \nEveryone is talking excitedly.  Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting by Detective\nWilliams in wooden chairs near the center of the room.  We hear bits of \nconversation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE WILLIAMS\n\t\t\t\t         (to Jeffrey)\n\t\t\tBecause of your information I alerted\n\t\t\tinternal affairs to check out Detective\n\t\t\tGordon.  I had to keep on with him as \n\t\t\tif nothing was different.  He slipped \n\t\t\toff on his own when he found out we were\n\t\t\tgoing to raid Frank's place.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t JEFFREY\n\t\t\tDoes Dorothy know her husband is dead?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDETECTIVE WILLIAMS\n\t\t\tNot yet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tOh my God. Is her son OK?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tF.B.I. MAN\n\t\t\tWe're looking for him. In your opinion,\n\t\t\twhy did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and\n\t\t\thusband?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tHe became obsessed with her. She hated\n\t\t\thim. He had to have her. He kidnapped\n\t\t\tthem to control her. to make her do \n\t\t\tthings. Then she wanted to commit \n\t\t\tsuicide so he started cutting off ears\n\t\t\tas a warning to her to stay alive. I'm\n\t\t\tnot kidding. Frank loved blue. blue\n\t\t\tvelvet. He had to have Dorothy cause\n\t\t\ther whole life was blue.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tF.B.I. MAN\n\t\t\tYou seemed to see some very interesting\n\t\t\tthings on your little escapade with \n\t\t\tDorothy Vallens.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tYeah. I guess I did.\n\t\t\t\t (He turns to Sandy\n  with a worried look)\n\t\t\tWhat's going to happen to me?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tF.B.I. MAN\n\t\t\tWe're going to leave that up to Detective\n\t\t\tWilliams. I'll tell you though. you're \n\t\t\tokay. you shot a real son of a bitch.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tYeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how\n\t\t\tmany more are out there?\n\nFADE TO BLACK - DARKNESS\n\n225. EXT. BEAUMONTS' BACK YARD - DAY\n\nA huge low roaring sound comes in.\n\nSLOWLY WE COME UP OUT OF A HUGE DARK HOLE. We see we are rising out of an \near but still among the crevices.  They look enormous.  We move up and \nfloat above the ear and traverse across a cheek to an eye.  Jeffrey's eye. \nHis face is bathed in light.\n\nAll sorts of springtime-in-the-garden sounds are heard.\n\nWe suddenly see that Jeffrey is sleeping in his back yard. Detective \nWilliams is with Mr. Beaumont working in the garden in the distance.  \nThe sprinkler is turning.  Sandy comes out on the back porch and calls.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANDY\n\t\t\tJeffrey. Lunch is ready.\n\nJeffrey opens his eyes.  He looks around confused for a moment.  He sees \nSandy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tOkay. I'll be right in.\n\nSandy goes back inside.  Suddenly, a big red ROBIN chirps loudly above.  \nJeffrey looks up at it sitting in the cherry tree.  The Robin and Jeffrey \nseems to exchange a special look.\n\nJeffrey smiles up at the fat bird.\n\nHe gets off the lawn chair and walks away from us toward the back door of \nthe house.  As he passes his father and Detective Williams:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tHow ya doin' Dad?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMR. BEAUMONT\n\t\t\t\t     (distant voice)\n\t\t\tHey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\tGood deal Dad.\n\nHe and Detective Williams share a smile.\n\n226. INT. BEAUMONTS' KITCHEN - DAY\n\nJeffrey enters the kitchen and sees Sandy standing with Aunt Barbara by the\nkitchen window.  Beyond, in the living room Mrs. Williams and Jeffrey's \nmother turn toward the kitchen when they hear the screen door slam.\n\nA large Red Robin has just flown down to the window still carrying a big \nbug in its mouth.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSANDY\n\t\t\t    (Referring to the bird)\n\t\t\tLook Jeffrey.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY\n\t\t\t  (As he joins Aunt Barbara and\n\t\t\t   Sandy to look at the robin)\n\t\t\tYeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe\n\t\t\tthe robins are here.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAUNT BARBARA\n\t\t\tI don't see how they do it. I could\n\t\t\tnever eat a bug.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJEFFREY AND SANDY\n\t\t\t\t          (smiling)\n\t\t\tIt's a strange world, isn't it?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n227. \tEXT.

EXT. TREE - DAY\n\nA songbird SINGS in a tree.\n\nWe are in a beautiful park.  Slowly we move down and a little hat with a \npropeller comes into view.  The hat is on the head of a small child who is\ndancing slowly toward Dorothy.  She is laughing.  When the boy gets within\narms reach they embrace.  We move close to Dorothy's smiling face.  Tears\nof happiness come into her eyes, but there is still a distant look as we \nhear Bobby Vinton sing the last lines of his song.\n\n\"and I still can see Blue Velvet through\n my tears.\"\n\nBlue Velvet dissolves in and takes over the image.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Velvet\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0David Lynch\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb", "summary": "Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) returns to his logging home town of Lumberton, North Carolina from Oak Lake College after his father suffers a near-fatal stroke. While walking home from the hospital, he cuts through a vacant lot and discovers a severed ear. Jeffrey takes the ear to police detective John Williams (George Dickerson), through whom he reacquaints with the detective's daughter, Sandy (Laura Dern). She tells him details about the ear case and a suspicious woman, Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), who may be connected to the case. Increasingly curious, Jeffrey enters Dorothy's apartment by posing as an exterminator, and while Dorothy is distracted by a man dressed in a yellow suit at her door (whom Jeffrey later refers to as the Yellow Man), Jeffrey steals her spare key.\nJeffrey and Sandy attend Dorothy's nightclub act, in which she sings \"Blue Velvet\", and leave early so Jeffrey can sneak into her apartment to snoop. He hurriedly hides in a closet when she returns home. However, Dorothy, wielding a knife, discovers him and threatens to kill him. Believing his curiosity is merely sexual and aroused by his voyeurism, Dorothy makes Jeffrey undress at knifepoint and begins to fellate him before their encounter is interrupted by a knock at the door. Dorothy hides Jeffrey in the closet. From there he witnesses the visitor, Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), inflict his bizarre sexual proclivities\u2014which include inhaling an unidentified gas (possibly nitrous oxide), dry humping, and sadomasochism\u2014upon Dorothy. Frank is an extremely foul-mouthed, violent sociopath whose orgasmic climax is a fit of both pleasure and rage. He continually refers to her as \"Mommy\" and to himself as both the \"Daddy\" and the \"Baby\", who \"want to fuck.\" Frank has kidnapped Dorothy's husband and son to force her to perform sexual favors; to \"Do it for van Gogh.\" When Frank leaves, a sad and desperate Dorothy tries to seduce Jeffrey again and demands that he hit her, but when he refuses, she tells him to leave. When Jeffrey moves to leave, she asks him to stay, though he leaves anyway.\nJeffrey relays his experience to Sandy, asking her why there are people like Frank. Sandy in turn tells him of a wonderful dream she had about robins that she interprets as a sign of hope for humanity. Jeffrey and Sandy are attracted to each other, though Sandy has a boyfriend.\nJeffrey again visits Dorothy's apartment and she tells him that although she knows nothing about him, she has been yearning for him. Jeffrey attends another of Dorothy's performances at the club, where she sings the same song. At the club, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of blue velvet fabric he cut from Dorothy's robe. Jeffrey follows Frank and spends the next few days spying on him. Shortly afterwards, two men that Jeffrey calls the Well-Dressed Man and the Yellow Man exit an industrial building that Frank frequently visits. Jeffrey concludes the men are criminal associates of Frank, and tells his new findings to Sandy. The two briefly kiss, though she feels uncomfortable about going any further. Jeffrey immediately visits Dorothy again, and the two have sex. However, when he refuses to hit her, she pressures him, becoming more emotional. In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy derives pleasure from it.\nAfterwards, Frank catches Dorothy and Jeffrey together and forces them both to accompany him to the apartment of Ben (Dean Stockwell), his suave, effeminate partner in crime who is holding Dorothy's son. Ben lip-syncs a performance of Roy Orbison's \"In Dreams\", sending Frank into maudlin sadness, then rage. Frank takes Jeffrey to a lumber yard and when he molests Dorothy, Jeffrey stands up to Frank by punching him. Frank's cronies drag Jeffrey out of the car and Frank kisses Jeffrey's face, intimidates him, and then savagely beats him to the overture of \"In Dreams\". Jeffrey wakes the next day at the same place and walks home, overcome with guilt and despair. He goes to the police station, where he notices that Sandy's father's partner is the Yellow Man\u2014an officer named Lieutenant Detective Tom Gordon (Fred Pickler). Later, at Sandy's home, her father is amazed by Jeffrey's story, but warns Jeffrey to stop his amateur sleuthing lest he endanger himself and the investigation. Jeffrey and Sandy go to a dance together and profess their love, only to be confronted by Sandy's boyfriend. A confrontation is averted when the group finds Dorothy\u2014naked, battered, and distressed\u2014on Jeffrey's front lawn. Barely conscious, Dorothy reveals her intimacy with Jeffrey, causing Sandy to become upset and to slap Jeffrey, although she later forgives him.\nJeffrey insists on returning to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to immediately send the police there, including her father. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband (Don Green), who is dead from a gunshot to the head and identifiable by his missing ear, as well as the Yellow Man, who bears a gruesome head wound and appears to have suffered a crude lobotomy. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming up the stairs and recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, killing the Yellow Man, and when he opens the closet door, Jeffrey fatally shoots him through the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of robins in their town. A montage sequence ends the film, which shows Dorothy and her son reunited."}

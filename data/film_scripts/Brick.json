Brendan\n          didn't approve, so he partnered up with Jerr then ratted him out to Trueman.

STOCKTON COVE GATE - NIGHT\n          \n              An imposing private community gate. Brendan coasts up on his\n              bike and ditches it in the bushes.

STOCKTON COVE STREET - NIGHT\n          \n              Shiny cars line the curb. Party noises come from an upscale\n              two story house.

Fifteen or twenty clean people, some\n              in costumes, mill about in cliques. Brendan comes in as if\n              he doesn't mind who sees him coming in. He gets a couple odd\n              stares, but no one stops him.\n          \n              With non obtrusive confidence he cuts through the crowd to\n              the beer keg in back and draws half a cup.\n          \n              INT.

Laura Dannon leans against it. She wears a red\n              kimono, and is striking against the velvet black piano.\n              Laura's kid sister, 11 years old with glasses, sits at the\n              piano playing \"All I do is Dream of You\".\n          \n              Laura sings, lovely and soft but with strength.1\n          \n              Brendan watches from the back, his face obscured in shadow,\n              but his eyes gleam. Through the darkened window behind him\n              a match flares up, and someone standing outside lights a\n              cigarette.\n          \n              Laura finishes the song. The room applauds, and she ruffles\n              her kid sister's hair.\n          \n              Brendan ducks out, and into\n          \n          1\n           By the time we got around to production this had changed to \"Someone to Watch Over\n          Me,\" but the publishing rights proved too expensive (i.e. not free.)

LIVING ROOM - SAME\n          \n          Brad Bramish, the jock who was kissing Laura in the parking\n          lot, sits slouched on the couch in a dense crowd. He holds a\n          cup and speaks much too loudly to a guy named Biff at his\n          elbow.\n          \n                              BRAD\n                    If the coach wants to play me I'll play,\n                    but I can't put my best game in if I've\n                    got to worry about whether I'm going to\n                    be in there. Halftime last game, coach\n                    is pissed I ran it on a pass play, out\n                    on the field he says to me 'you gotta\n                    think about the team and you gotta' you\n                    know and 'if you run that ball again\n                    you're out', and I said to him you gotta\n                    let me play! I'm out there, let me play,\n                    and he's saying 'no you're out' and I\n                    kept saying 'Let me play!

Let me play!'\n          \n          Brad hunches forward, his face swollen purple, yelling that\n          over and over. Tom steps in front of Brendan, blocking his\n          line of sight.\n          \n          Brendan scans the rest of the room. His eyes catch on Laura,\n          leaning against a divan. Her bright, sharp eyes cut through\n          the room, straight into Brendan.\n          He wags his eyebrows at her.\n          \n          She looks away quickly. Brendan turns back to Brad, still\n          shouting 'let me play'. Tom stands between them.\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    Tom!\n          \n          Brad falls silent. Most of the room follows suit.

I'm\n                    trying to follow Brad's story, and it's\n                    difficult when I can't see his face.\n          \n                                                                         14\n          \n          \n          The room watches Brendan. Tom mumbles something and steps\n          aside. Brad stares at Brendan stupidly. Brendan flashes a\n          dopey grin and tips his glass.\n          \n                              BRAD\n                        (stumbles)\n                    He doesn't give me a play to make, what\n                    can I do, you know?\n          \n          He falls into awkward silence. Biff starts babbling.\n          \n          Brendan looks at Brad, who is staring back at him.\n          \n          Brendan then slowly drags his gaze over to Laura, staring at\n          him too, her eyes slightly amused. Brendan cocks an eyebrow.\n          The slightest hint of a smile takes the corner of her mouth,\n          and she wags her eyebrows once at him.\n          \n          Brendan glances back at Brad, looking at Laura now, not\n          amused at all.\n          \n          Brendan stands to go. Biff chatters on. Brad cuts him off.\n          \n                              BRAD (cont'd)\n                    Hey. Hey!

Laura studies Brendan's face, then seems to\n          come to a decision.\n          \n                              LAURA\n                    Coffee and pie.\n          \n          The words hang in the air a moment.

A voice calls from the glass door.\n          Another girl. Laura flashes Brendan a look and goes to her.\n          They have quick, quiet words and the girl leaves. Laura\n          turns back to Brendan.\n          \n                              LAURA (CONT'D) (cont'd)\n                    Will you wait here for me?\n          \n                               BRENDAN\n                    Sure.\n          \n                              LAURA\n                    You'll stay right here and wait -- I'll\n                    be five minutes.\n          \n                               BRENDAN\n                    Yes.\n          \n          The moment she leaves Brendan runs across the lawn and hops\n          the fence, into the neighbor's yard.\n          \n          EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE\n          \n          Brendan runs to the edge of the neighboring house and peeks\n          around.

Brendan\n          \n                                                                         18\n          \n          \n          begins to follow, but a noise from behind the fence stops\n          him - a match being struck.\n          \n          Brendan creeps towards the fence and peers through a\n          splintered hole.\n          \n          BRENDAN'S POV - THROUGH THE FENCE\n          \n          A brightly lit window in the side of Brad's house, and\n          through the window the party.\n          \n          A dark figure wearing a long coat and broad rimmed hat, all\n          inky black. The figure smokes a cigarette and watches the\n          party, absently stroking his cheek.\n          \n          Brendan steps back - SNAP!   A twig.\n          \n          The figure freezes. Then, making no noise at all, it spins\n          to face Brendan, a towering black form against the window.\n          \n          The glowing cigarette falls to the grass.\n          A metallic glint, and a clicking sound not unlike a gun.\n          \n          Brendan throws himself backwards onto the grass. A beat.\n          \n          Through the hole the black of the figure's cloak whips away.\n          \n          Brendan hesitates, then hops the fence.\n          \n          EXT. SIDE OF BRAD'S HOUSE - SAME\n          \n          Brendan lands on his feet. No black figure to be found.\n          \n          The cigarette still smolders on the ground. Hand rolled,\n          plain paper.\n          \n          Brendan gazes through the window, catching his breath. Then\n          he breaks the trance and creeps towards the street.\n          \n          EXT. FRONT LAWN - NIGHT\n          \n          Peeking around the house, Brendan sees Laura cut across the\n          lawn and trot into the street. Using parked cars as cover,\n          Brendan follows.\n          \n          EXT. STREET\n          \n          Between cars, Brendan sees a lanky kid in baggy jeans and\n          engineer boots with a clean shaven head leaning against a\n          black Mustang. Laura goes to him and speaks quickly.\n          \n                                                                         19\n          \n          \n          The dark figure in the hat emerges from the shadows. Laura\n          says something to him.

Her wrist is\n          adorned with the same cheap plastic bracelets as the dead\n          girl's arm. Dode speaks quickly to her, she nods and speaks\n          back. He hands her a slip of paper, which she tucks into a\n          brightly colored address book and slips in her jacket\n          pocket.

SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Emily and Brendan sit in silence. She is very pretty, but\n          she looks bad. Too much makeup, not enough sleep.

As the last strands slide off his\n          face he wakes up with a start.\n          \n          The clock says 3:46. Brendan drips with sweat, breathing\n          raggedly.

An\n          inky black figure steps from the shadows and kicks him in\n          the stomach.

Emily wrenches her arm away and\n               stumbles backwards onto the pavement.\n          \n               Brendan grabs her sleeve. She twists away. He grabs her\n               shoulder, grabs her waist, she resists, and suddenly they\n               are struggling with violent pent up intensity until with a\n               shout she breaks away and falls to the ground.\n          \n               A beat.

BACKSTAGE OF THEATER - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          He spins to see Kara's face just before the door closes.\n          She's worried.\n          \n          EXT. CROWDED SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY\n          \n          The Brain walks out of a classroom and Brendan swings behind\n          him.\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                        (fast and low)\n                    Tail Kara through lunch. She's got\n                    rehearsal but she'll blow early. She\n                    goes home, drop her, else wait for my\n                    call.\n          \n          The Brain turns and Brendan's gone.\n          \n          EXT. PARKING LOT - LUNCH\n          Brendan wanders through the thick lunchtime crowd towards a\n          cluster of 3 or 4 flashy luxury cars set aside at the far\n          end of the lot.\n          \n          Brad Bramish sits slouched in the front seat of his\n          convertible, front door open. A small crowd hangs about\n          Brad, his crony Biff at his elbow.\n          \n                              BRAD\n                    That's all I'm saying, is put me in the\n                    game and I'll do what needs to be done,\n                    but they don't put me in, what needs\n                    doing don't get done and don't come\n                    crying to me, man. Get off my grill man,\n                    you didn't put me in, don't come to me\n                    if you didn't let me play.\n          \n                              BIFF\n                    They didn't!\n          \n          Brendan scans the rest of the cars. His eyes catch on Laura\n          Dannon sitting in another convertible, off to the side. Her\n          bright eyes cut through the crowd, straight into Brendan.\n          \n          He wags his eyebrows at her. She looks away. Brendan walks\n          into Brad's direct line of view and obviously leans against\n          one of the cars.\n          \n                              BRAD\n                    Hey! What are you doing here?\n          \n                                                                    39\n          \n          \n                                 BRENDAN\n                    Listening.\n          \n                                 BRAD\n                    Uh huh.\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    Alright, you got me. I'm a scout for the\n                    Gophers.\n          \n                              BRAD\n                        (not amused)\n                    Oh yeah?\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    Of all things, yeah. Been watching your\n                    game for a month, but that story just\n                    now clenched it. You've got heart, kid.\n                    How soon can you move to Minneapolis?\n          \n          A few snickers around the crowd, but nowhere near Brad.\n          \n                              BRAD\n                        (flat with anger)\n                    Yeah?\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    Cold winters, but they've got a great\n                    public transit system.\n          \n                                 BRAD\n                    Yeah?\n          \n                                 BRENDAN\n                    Yeah.\n          \n                                 BRAD\n                    Oh yeah?\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    There's a thesaurus in the library.\n                    'Yeah's under 'Y'. Go ahead, I'll wait.\n          \n                              BRAD\n                    Who invited you?\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    To the parking lot? Well gee I kind of\n                    invited myself.\n          \n                              BRAD\n                    I think you'd better leave then.\n          \n                                                                         40\n          \n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    No, I'm having too good a time.\n          \n                              BRAD\n                    Just the same.\n          \n          Brendan smiles slightly, and very deliberately crosses his\n          legs. Brad's face tenses.\n          \n                              BRAD (cont'd)\n                    Maybe you want to go someplace more\n                    private.\n          \n                                BRENDAN\n                    With you?\n          \n          Brad says 'who else?' by lifting his arms.\n          \n                               BRENDAN (cont'd)\n                        (as if he's been asked to the\n                          movies)\n                    Sure.\n          \n          Brendan stands and walks off. Brad follows and the rest of\n          the crowd trails after him.\n          \n          He leads them behind a parked VW van and turns to face Brad.\n          People gather around in a wide circle.\n          \n          Brendan pulls his jacket off as Brad hangs back, mumbling.\n          \n                              BRAD\n                    You know what's good for you you'll just\n                    beat it. Beating a small frye won't win\n                    me anything and it's not going to do you\n                    any good-\n          \n          Laura pulls up in her convertible, behind Brad, watching.\n          \n          In the next moment Brendan cuts Brad off by putting his fist\n          in his face.\n          \n          Brad grunts but doesn't lose ground. Brendan throws his\n          short stocky frame into Brad's larger one and tenderizes his\n          midsection with jabs.\n          \n          Brad tags Brendan in the ribs, then smacks the palm of his\n          hand into Brendan's face, shoving him back onto the\n          pavement.\n          \n          He comes at Brendan with his big fists clenched.\n          \n          Brendan kicks Brad full force in the shins.\n          \n                                                                         41\n          \n          \n          Brad tumbles, and Brendan comes up fast, connecting hard\n          with the point of Brad's chin. Brad gets his balance fast,\n          and before Brendan can throw another he throws one himself,\n          then another, both into Brendan's stomach. Brendan pulls\n          back and kicks Brad's shin where he had kicked it before.\n          Brad roars and hits Brendan very hard in the face.\n          \n          Brendan bounces back like a rubber ball and throws his\n          weight into a square punch right into Brad's nose.\n          \n          The sound of eggs breaking, and Brad falls backwards like a\n          board.\n          \n          He stays down, holding his face.\n          \n          Brendan staggers back, breathing hard, and looks up at the\n          small crowd. Some stare at Brendan, some at Brad, but nobody\n          seems about to do anything. Brendan runs his sleeve over his\n          face and walks unsteadily off, pushing past the last few\n          people rushing over.\n          \n                              STRAGGLER\n                    Hey, is there a fight?\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    Yeah.\n          \n          He throws a last look at Laura, who meets his gaze and\n          drives off.\n          \n          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Brendan walks away from the lot, towards the school. Laura\n          pulls up beside him in her car.\n          \n                              LAURA\n                    Hey.\n          \n          Brendan ignores her and b-lines for the school. Laura brakes\n          hard, parking by the curb.\n          EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Brendan limps down the hallway.    Laura appears behind him,\n          trotting to catch up.\n          \n                              LAURA\n                    You're quite a pill.\n                              BRENDAN\n                    Uh huh.\n          \n                                                                   42\n          \n          \n                              LAURA\n                    Where are you going?\n          \n                               BRENDAN\n                    Home.\n          \n                              LAURA\n                    Why did you take a powder the other\n                    night?\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    Same reason I'm taking one now.\n          \n                              LAURA\n                    Hold it.\n                        (he keeps walking)\n                    I don't get you.

Can't say I didn't enjoy it, but\n                    why'd she come to me?\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    She's tapping Kara, and Kara knows you\n                    know me.\n          \n                              THE BRAIN\n                    Yeah, well. She's some piece of work. If\n                    I had known where you were I might have\n                    told her.\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    That's the spirit. Ask around for Dode,\n                    tail Kara again at lunch. I got knives\n                    in my eyes, I'm going home sick. I'll\n                    call you tonight.\n          \n          EXT. SIDEWALK - LATE AFTERNOON\n          \n          Bordering a supermarket. Brendan trudges along. Suddenly he\n          stops. Parked in the supermarket parking lot is a black\n          mustang.\n          \n          EXT. PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON\n          \n          The sun hangs low. Brendan approaches the car and walks\n          around it slowly. He peers inside. A tuft of paper pokes out\n          from under the seat. He pulls the door handle, locked.\n          \n                                                                         49\n          \n          \n          Brendan picks up a broken chunk of concrete from the ground,\n          waddles over to the car and holds the chunk above his head,\n          ready to drop it through the window.\n          \n          He stops. His eyes catch something in the distance.\n          \n          The lanky shaved-head kid, whose name is Tugger.   Coming\n          towards him fast.\n          \n          Brendan stands there for a moment, then lets the chunk fall\n          to the ground. He casually leans against the car, removes\n          his glasses, puts them in a hard case and puts the hard case\n          in his pocket.\n          \n          Tugger hits him like a train and throws him across the\n          pavement. Tug turns back to the car and takes out his keys.\n          \n          Brendan gets up and comes towards Tug, his face stiff. Tug\n          turns and pops him once squarely in the mouth. Brendan falls\n          to his knees.\n          \n          While Tug unlocks the door Brendan stands up woozily.\n          Grunting, Tug spins and grabs Brendan's jacket, pushing him\n          back while he slaps him hard in the face, back and forth,\n          three times. When Tug lets go Brendan drops like a stone,\n          catching himself on his hands and knees. The car door slams.\n          \n          The mustang drives about a hundred yards out into the\n          parking lot, spins around and stops, facing Brendan. Its\n          motor purrs deeply. Brendan begins to limp towards it\n          doggedly, head up, eyes fixed.\n          \n          A crackling roar and short squeal of tires spit the mustang\n          forward. It comes straight at Brendan, rumbling like a tank.\n          \n          Brendan stops walking and stands very still, eyes steady.\n          The gap between him and the car closes in no time at all.\n          \n          It speeds past him not six inches to his left, brushing the\n          edge of his jacket. Brakes squeal behind him. Brendan turns\n          and lopes towards the mustang, idling about fifty feet away.\n          \n          He stops at the window.   Tugger eyes him curiously, with\n          some respect.\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    I want to see the Pin.\n          \n                              TUGGER\n                        (nods slightly)\n                    Yeah, I guess you do.\n          \n                                                                                                      50\n          \n          \n                EXT. STREETS\n          \n                Twisty and narrow. The black mustang flies through them at\n                impossible speeds, roaring past like a bullet.\n          \n                DARKNESS\n          \n                Loud engine noise, jostling, grunting. Then a metallic\n                jangle, some scraping, and a CLINK!\n          \n                EXT. REAR OF FAST MOVING MUSTANG - LATE AFTERNOON\n          \n                The trunk pops open, revealing Brendan holding a jack rod.\n          \n                INT. MOVING MUSTANG - CONTINUOUS\n          \n                Tug is putting a tape in the deck, eyes down. Behind him\n                the trunk pops open, then pulls down out of sight just as he\n                looks back up.\n          \n                INT. TRUNK OF MOVING MUSTANG\n                Brendan holds the trunk about three inches open, just enough\n                to see which street signs pass by. Loud music plays from the\n                car -- \"Sweet Baby James\" by James Taylor.1\n          \n                The car zooms on.\n          \n                BRENDAN'S POV\n          \n                Through the ajar trunk. The mustang slides to a stop beside\n                an elaborate wooden mailbox carved as an eagle's head.\n                Brendan closes the trunk.\n          \n                EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON\n          \n                A small one story house, slightly run down. Tugger opens the\n                trunk and drags Brendan out, covering his eyes with a palm,\n                slams the trunk and goes inside.\n          \n                When they are gone the broken trunk drifts open.\n          \n                INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY\n          \n                A very dim narrow hall with a steep stairway at one end,\n                dark doors down the length of it and a lit door at the other\n                end. Tugger drags Brendan down the stairway, drops him and\n                goes into the lit room.\n          \n          \n          \n          \n          1\n              Unfortunately Mr. Taylor flatly refused, which, given the context, was probably wise.\n          \n                                                                        51\n          \n          \n          Brendan lifts his head painfully. Surrounding him in the\n          darkened doorways are dozens of boys, some dressed like\n          Tugger, others dressed in black.\n          \n          Tug pokes his head out.\n          \n                               TUGGER\n                    Alright.\n          \n          Arms pop out of the darkness and drag Brendan towards the\n          lit room.\n          \n          INT. KINGPIN'S DEN\n          \n          A small room, amazingly messy. Clothes strewn about, groves\n          of empty bottles, precarious piles of books. The overall\n          impression though is not of jumbled chaos, but of a nest,\n          comfortably woven and very worn in.\n          \n          A slim figure with wispy hair sits facing the wall at a\n          small desk, writing under a green bookkeeper's lamp.\n          \n          Brendan is shoved into the center of the room. Tug and his\n          clones slump against the surrounding walls. Brendan watches\n          the thin figure's back. For a beat the only noise is the\n          scratching of the thin man's pencil. Then he sighs and\n          swivels around.\n          \n          Mid to late twenties. Sallow features, tired eyes. His\n          clothes are so richly black it is difficult to make out\n          specific items -- he is just one inky black mass from the\n          neck down and eyebrows up.\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    You the Pin?\n          \n                              PIN\n                    Yeah.\n                        (beat of silence)\n                    So now I'm very very curious what you're\n                    going to say next.\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    Maybe I'll just sit and bleed at you.\n          \n          The Pin shifts in his seat, bored.\n          \n                              PIN\n                    Helled if you're gonna go breaking my\n                    best clients' noses and expect me to\n                    play sandbag. Anyway you've been\n                    sniffing me out before then, sniffing\n                    for me like a vampire bat for a horse\n          \n                                                                        52\n          \n          \n                    with a nick on its ear he can suck on.\n                    They do that.\n                        (Brendan blinks)\n                    So now you got Tugger to bring you here,\n                    which he never does, and you got me\n                    listening, so I'm curious what you've\n                    got to say that better be really, really\n                    good.\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    Call Ms. Dannon in from the hall first;\n                    she oughta hear this.\n          \n                              PIN\n                        (amused)\n                    No dice, soldier.

Then I\n                    was going to go to the vice principal\n                    and spill him the street address of the\n                    biggest dope port in the burgh.\n          \n          The Pin's eyes shoot to Tugger, who doesn't flinch.\n          \n                              TUGGER\n                    He knows zippo.\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    1250 Vista Blanca, the ink blotter at\n                    the desk in the den in the basement of\n                    the house with the tacky mailbox.\n          \n          The world turns on its side as Tugger pushes Brendan's head\n          down into the carpet.\n          \n                              TUGGER\n                    You gonna do what now?!\n          \n          The Pin walks towards them. One of his shoes is twice the\n          size of the other.\n          \n                              PIN\n                    No good, soldier.\n          \n          The cronies around the room begin cackling. Tug's face is a\n          mask of rage. Brendan can't breath. His face swells.\n          \n                                                                         53\n          \n          \n                              PIN (cont'd)\n                    Alright, let up.\n          \n          But Tug doesn't let up. Brendan's world grows hazy, the\n          cackling laughter reverberates, then a clean voice pierces\n          the din.\n          \n                                 LAURA\n                        (OS)\n                    Tug, stop.\n          \n          Tug's face breaks for a moment, and he lets go. Brendan's\n          head lolls to the side. Laura stands in the dark doorway.\n          \n          Brendan sees Tug's knuckles and a flash of white for a split\n          moment as Tug hits him in the face. The Pin's black body\n          spills out across the frame, leaving us in black.\n          \n          FADE UP\n          \n          SMALL DARK ROOM\n          \n          Brendan wakes up curled on a mattress on the floor. A bare\n          light bulb hangs from the ceiling. Tugger sits five feet\n          away, watching him like a hungry dog. Brendan stares back at\n          him through thick, glazed eyes.\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    Where are my glasses?\n                        (Tugger grins)\n                    Hell with ya then. Which wall's the door\n                    in?\n          \n          Tug points, amused. Brendan heaves himself up, and Tug\n          shoves him back down.\n          \n          Brendan winks at him, stands and lurches towards the door\n          again.\n          \n          Tugger grabs his shirt and slams him into the wall, but\n          freezes when he hears a door latch click. Sneering, he drops\n          Brendan back onto the mattress and sits against the opposite\n          wall.\n          \n          Sounds of a door opening and closing come from the darkness.\n          Light footsteps clack on the cement floor. Suddenly Tug\n          vanishes -- the room's darkness just seems to swallow him.\n          \n          The thin whispery voice of the Pin speaks softly.\n          \n                              PIN\n                    Sorry about this kid, but what the hell\n                    with what you said before.\n          \n                                                                         54\n          \n          \n          His disembodied face appears a few feet about where Tug had\n          sat.\n          \n                              PIN (cont'd)\n                    Where you were at, with all of us and\n                    the Tug a fist away, you've got to use\n                    your nut. Allay the situation, So yeah,\n                    you're not scared of me, I got it, but\n                    I'm also thinking you're a little nuts\n                    now, so you've got that trade off with\n                    your standing. But nuts isn't all bad,\n                    so maybe it was a good play. I don't\n                    know.\n          \n          He is standing in front of Tug. His black clothes and broad\n          rimmed black hat blend perfectly with the dark room, such\n          that his face seems to bob about in space. Brendan stifles a\n          cough.\n          \n                              PIN (cont'd)\n                    So, Laura talked me down. Let's get you\n                    upstairs, back with the living.\n          \n          INT. KITCHEN - DAY\n          \n          Brendan sits at a breakfast table eating cornflakes.

LOCKER CAGE - MORNING\n          \n          The class bell rings, and the cage quickly empties. Brendan\n          limps in, opens his locker. A note falls to his feet. It is\n          folded into a star. He pulls it open. \"TWELVE THIRTY PICO &\n          ALEXANDER\".\n          He fishes the old note out and compares them - different\n          handwriting.\n          \n                                                                         62\n          \n          \n          The locker cage is now empty and silent, except for the\n          steady sound of heavy footfalls. Brendan looks up from the\n          notes.\n          \n          A lug with a lumpish face is coming towards him. He wears a\n          black trenchcoat over bulbous shoulders, and his black hair\n          comes down over his eyes like a sheepdog's.\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    You the Pin's?\n          \n          No answer.

Brendan tightens his hand into a fist.\n          Then CLICK! and a long slender switchblade gleams in the\n          lug's right paw.\n          \n          Brendan jumps back as the lug swipes the blade at his torso.\n          Before the lug winds up for another slash Brendan is\n          running.\n          \n          EXT. CAMPUS SQUARE - DAY\n          \n          Brendan runs through the empty campus square, the lug\n          follows.\n          \n          EXT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY\n          \n          Wind rushing, sweating, the lug very close. Their footsteps\n          clatter on the cement. Brendan swings around a corner,\n          doubles back and stops with his back to a wall - he's lost\n          sight of him.\n          \n          Brendan sweats, listening. The lug's footsteps echo through\n          the hallways, coming from all directions at once. Then it\n          seems clear - he's down the hall on Brendan's right.\n          Brendan dashes left. Wrong. The lug looms over him, his\n          knife hand flashing. Brendan's jacket shoulder tears open,\n          and the white filling inside turns red. He stumbles back\n          blindly, gets his footing and scrambles out of reach.\n          \n          Brendan sprints away, down the hall, gaining about thirty\n          feet on the lug before turning the corner.\n          \n          Brendan drops to a sitting position.\n          \n          THE LUG AROUND THE CORNER\n          \n          Running fast.\n          \n                                                                         63\n          \n          \n          BRENDAN\n          \n          Kicks his shoes off and clambers to his feet.

The lug pitches forward with frightening\n          momentum. He hits the hall's metal handrail with his arms\n          and head. A hollow gong reverberates through the hallway,\n          and the lug falls like a puppet with his strings cut.\n          A wallet with a couple of twenties and a student ID (CHUCK\n          BURNS), three hash pipes, fifteen joints, a baggie of weed\n          and a large brownie in another baggie.\n          \n          Brendan leaves it all on him and staggers off.\n          \n          EXT.

He presses lightly on the screen\n          door, and it gives.\n          \n          INT. KITCHEN - SAME\n          \n          Empty. Brendan crosses the warped linoleum and gently opens\n          the narrow basement door. He descends into inky gloom.\n          \n          INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME\n          Deathly still and silent. Barely breathing, Brendan goes to\n          the lit doorway at the end of the hall.\n          \n          INT. PIN'S DEN - SAME\n          \n          Empty. Brendan floats through the room like a ghost, to the\n          Pin's desk.\n          \n          Slowly, then with greater confidence he rifles through it -\n          papers and trinkets, meaningless.\n          \n          He reaches beneath the desk, knocking it gently with his\n          knuckles. Quickly he removes the top drawer and reaches down\n          into the desk frame.\n          \n          Brendan draws out a stack of hundred dollar bills two inches\n          thick. He pulls out another. Another. Another. Thumbing the\n          stacks -- pure hundreds.\n          \n          Something creaks in the hallway.\n          \n          Brendan freezes. Silently he replaces the money and drawer,\n          his eyes on the doorway. He creeps towards the door on the\n          balls of his feet.\n          \n          INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME\n          \n          Still empty. Brendan creeps towards the stairs, passing\n          other doorways, all open but for one. He stops for a moment,\n          listening - silence.\n          \n                                                                         73\n          \n          \n          INT. STORAGE ROOM - SAME\n          \n          Brendan enters the room - pitch black but for a small high\n          window. Brendan pulls the curtains aside. A beam of sunlight\n          spills just enough light to reveal a figure in the dark.\n          Brendan jumps back, and his reflection in the large mirror\n          jumps as well.\n          \n          A white bird nesting in the window flutters into the dark\n          room.\n          \n          Brendan walks the large mirror into the beam of light,\n          reflecting it around the room like a flashlight. More junk,\n          a mattress, then a strangely bare corner with a single white\n          lump in it. The white bird stands behind the lump, its dark\n          eyes caught in the bare light.\n          \n          The bird flies out the window.\n          \n          Brendan goes to the white lump, a small brick of white\n          powder. White chalky residue patterns the floor -- there\n          were other bricks there before.\n          \n          Behind Brendan, in the mirror, something moves. Someone\n          else, in the room.\n          \n          Tugger. He throws Brendan across the room, then heaves him\n          into a wall.\n          \n                              TUGGER\n                    What with the poking, genius?!

She goes on the backburner.\n                    Meanwhile maybe you're getting bored,\n                    maybe just greedy, so when the Pin\n                    scores big with the bricks you take your\n                    shot. You hook one, take half, and cut\n                    it back to size, but you cut it bad.\n                    Maybe accidentally, maybe to down the\n                    Pin's operation, doesn't matter. You put\n                    it back, but poor Frisco doses off it\n                    and lands in a coma.\n                        (voice strengthening)\n                    So now the Pin's fuming, maybe he's\n                    jealous of Brad, so he comes to Brad's\n                    crowd looking for blood, or at least a\n                    scape. You know trouble. There's going\n                    to be a war over this. And there's\n                    Emily. She trusts you.

She saw you\n                    and ran like she saw some devil.\n          \n          Laura's face is very still, quivering.\n          \n                                                                        107\n          \n          \n                              LAURA\n                    Brendan, why are you-\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    And she took the hit. Dode hid her away,\n                    but the Pin was on to her, tracked her\n                    down, told her to meet him, that they\n                    would make good. Gave her a time, and a\n                    place. And sent Tug. Just to get the\n                    straight. But maybe you had talked Tug\n                    up, or maybe he just blew a fuse, but Em\n                    sprung it on him that she had her kid,\n                    and he did what anyone could count on\n                    Tug doing - he hit her. She took the hit\n                    for you. You let her take it.\n          \n                                LAURA\n                    Stop it!\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    That's the tale.\n          \n                                LAURA\n                    Stop it!\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    You're going to tell me it's not?\n          \n          \n          \n                                LAURA\n                    It's not!\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    Look at me.\n          \n          She crumples against him, looking him straight in the eye.\n          \n                              LAURA\n                    You know me.

Brendan holds her\n          stare, but his eyes are distant.\n          \n                              BRENDAN\n                    I hope it isn't.

I think that was your\n                    final play. But I hope I'm wrong. I hope\n                    everything I wrote in the note I dropped\n                    at Gary Trueman's office this morning is\n                    wrong. About your and Brad's involvement\n                    in the Pin's runnings. I hope you didn't\n                    steal the brick last night.

And when Trueman\n                    reads the note, takes my cue and\n                    searches your locker, he won't find a\n                    damn thing.\n          \n          Something changes in Laura's eyes.\n          \n          EXT.

He doesn't look at her.

She\n                    said she wished she could keep it, but\n                    she didn't love the father. I was going\n                    to drive her down the next day, we'd\n                    found a doctor. Most wouldn't. She was\n                    starting to show. 3 months.

Her figure takes back\n          some dignity. She steps towards him deliberately. Closer.\n          Right up against him.\n          \n          She brings her head to his, puts her lips to his ear,\n          breathes warm breath, and says two words.

Brendan turns to see the Brain hopping a\n          chain link fence.

Brendan discovers a note leading him to a pay phone, where he receives a phone call from a terrified Emily begging him for help. She mentions a \"brick\", \"poor Frisco\", \"Tug\", and the \"Pin\", before abruptly hanging up. Her fear appears to have been caused by a passing black Ford Mustang, from which a distinctive-looking cigarette was thrown. Upon asking for information from his acquaintance named Brain, Brendan's search for Emily leads him to Kara, another ex-girlfriend - which further leads him to a Halloween party attended by a flirtatious Laura and her boyfriend, Brad Bramish.\nLaura points Brendan in the direction of a local diner, where he arranges a meeting through Dode, leader of a stoner clique that Emily belongs to. Upon meeting, Emily recants what she had said on the phone and tells Brendan to let her go. Brendan steals her notepad during the encounter and finds a note that leads him directly to her dead body. Emotionally distraught by her death, Brendan takes it upon himself to solve her murder, enlisting the aid of Brain. Brendan hides the body to avoid police intrusion. Brendan discovers that \"The Pin\" is a local drug baron. After finding out that Brad is a regular customer of Pin's, Brendan sets about getting his attention by beating up Brad Bramish. Afterwards, Brendan is beaten up by an unknown young man while speaking on the phone with Brain.\nBrendan visits Vice Principal Trueman, asking him to allow Brendan to investigate the events, without mentioning Emily's death, as a favour for turning in Jerr. While Trueman allows Brendan to continue his investigation, he warns that if Brendan gets caught, Trueman will \"throw him under the bus\". Brendan visits Kara, to request more information about the Pin, although she fobs him off. Later while walking, Brendan sees the same black Ford Mustang in a parking lot. Before attempting to break into the car, he is noticed and beaten up by the car's owner, who is the man who beat him previously. Brendan asks the man several times to meet The Pin. Reluctant at first, going so far as to drive away and then come back again, the young man takes Brendan to The Pin.\nBrendan meets with The Pin and persuades him to consider Brendan for a spot in his operation. It is also revealed that the unknown man is Tug, The Pin's main grunt and muscle. The Pin tells Brendan he will either hire him or rub him out by the next day. On the walk back home Laura tells Brendan that The Pin had previously rejected Emily's attempt to join, so she stole The Pin's brick. Laura then offers to help Brendan, but he distrusts her. While Brendan awaits a response from The Pin, he is attacked by a knife wielding man while at school, but Brendan fights him off. Brendan begins to cough. The Pin accepts Brendan. Brendan gets a call from Dode, who says he saw Brendan hide Emily's body and, believing Brendan is the murderer, vows to ruin him. Brendan meets with The Pin, who suspects an uprising from Tug.\nBrain reports that \"poor Frisco\" is Frisco Farr, a student who fell into a coma after injecting poorly-cut heroin. At The Pin's house, Tug tells Brendan that The Pin received a shipment of ten bricks and sold eight; one was stolen and replaced with another that had been doctored with detergent, causing Frisco's coma, and the 10th brick remains to be sold. The Pin arrives and tells Tug about hearing from someone who knows what happened to Emily. Brendan, weakened from several recent fistfights, intercepts Dode before the meeting and discovers Emily was pregnant when she died. Dode hints to Tug and The Pin that he has information about who killed Emily, saying it is someone very close, but Tug goes berserk and beats Dode before shooting him in the head. Tug then threatens The Pin, who walks away as Brendan faints from a coughing fit. Brendan awakens in Tug's bedroom, where Tug says he's at war with The Pin.\nBrendan confronts Kara, accusing her of manipulating Dode by telling him Emily was carrying his baby and pushing him to sell his information to The Pin. Brendan arranges a meeting between Tug and The Pin, and waits in Tug's bed; Laura enters to comfort him as he sobs over Emily, and they couple. Brendan recognizes her post-sex cigarette as the same distinctive brand that was dropped from Tug's black Mustang after Emily was frightened during the first phone call. At the meeting, chaos erupts when it is discovered that the tenth brick is now missing. Tug beats The Pin to death while Brendan flees, escaping just as police arrive. As he goes he passes the trunk of Tug's car, where he has hidden Emily's body to ensure that police pin her murder on Tug.\nThe next day, Brendan meets with Laura in the school's football field. Brendan explains to Laura that he knows she set Emily up to take the fall for Laura's theft of the ninth brick. She further manipulated Emily into meeting Tug who ultimately killed her, after letting him believe he was responsible for Emily's pregnancy. It is revealed that Laura later stole the tenth brick as well. Brendan tells Laura he has put this truth in a note to Vice Principal Trueman of the school, who will find the brick in Laura's locker if, in fact, what he says is true. Laura vindictively tells Brendan that Emily expressed regret that she couldn't keep her pregnancy because she did not love the prospective father, and that Emily was three months pregnant when she died, implying that the baby was his. Brendan watches Laura walk away."}

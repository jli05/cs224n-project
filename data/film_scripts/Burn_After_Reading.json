The eastern seaboard stretches away, flecked with\n    clouds.\n\n    As we dissolve in closer the picture bleaches of color.   We\n    are looking down at the city of Washington, D.C.\n\n    Dissolve closer still: a black-and-white aerial photograph of\n    a neighborhood in suburban D.C. dominated by a sprawling\n    building.

A nameplate on the desk identifies him as Palmer\n    DeBakey Smith.\n\n                          PALMER\n              Ozzie.

Olson, by\n              reputation.

Fuck you guys! Whose ass\n             didn't I kiss?

This is a crucifixion! This is\n               political! Don't tell me it's not!\n\n    He storms out the door.\n\n                         OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n               ... I have a drinking problem!\n\n    The door slams.   Palmer Smith looks at Olson.     Olson arches\n    an eyebrow.\n\n\n4   INT.

Katie, an\n    attractive middle-aged woman, enters, taking her key out of\n    the door, but stops, surprised to see Osbourne.\n\n                         KATIE\n               You're home.\n\n    Osbourne continues making himself a drink.\n\n                         OSBOURNE\n               Hang on to your hat, honey.

She would give you.   The\n              message.\n\n                        OSBOURNE\n              Well she, I don't know, I guess we had\n              bigger news today.

You tried? And then----\n               what, the aphasia kicked in?\n\n                         OSBOURNE\n               Our guests came. We----\n\n                                         10.\n\n\n            KATIE\nWhy?!    For fuck's sake, Ozzie!\n\n            OSBOURNE\nI'm just----I don't know.    I got so\ntired.\n\n          KATIE\nYou're tired.\n\n          OSBOURNE\nTired of swimming against the current.\n\n               KATIE\nUh-huh.\n\n          OSBOURNE\nIndependent thought is not only not\nvalued there, they resist it, they\nfight it, the bureaucracy is\npositively----\n\n          KATIE\nDid you get a pension, or severance or\nsomething, or----\n\n          OSBOURNE\nI didn't retire you know, I, I quit.\nI don't want their benefits.\n\n          KATIE\nBut I suppose my benefits are all\nright, I suppose you can live with\nthose, is that the idea?\n\n          OSBOURNE\nIt's not like that's the only way to\nmake money.\n\n               KATIE\nYes?    Yes?     What're you gonna do?\n\n          OSBOURNE\nI'll do some consulting.\n\n          KATIE\nConsulting.\n\n          OSBOURNE\nYes, to help while I----I've always\nwanted to write.\n\n            KATIE\nWrite.

A book,\n                 a sort of, sort of memoir.\n\n    Katie stares at him in the mirror.\n\n    A beat.\n\n    She bursts into laughter.\n\n\n9   EXT. YACHT/AT SEA - DAY                                        9\n\n    THE BRIDGE\n\n    A small yacht. Osbourne stands at the wheel, a light wind in\n    his face, as the boat sails under motor power.\n\n    After a beat he moves to the front of the boat.\n\n    An old man sits on a bench on the prow facing out into the\n    wind. He has snowy hair and a stern Yankee face. He wears a\n    tweed cap. He doesn't much react to Osbourne's approach.\n\n                           OSBOURNE\n                 You okay there, Dad?\n\n    The old man remains silent, staring. Osbourne sits next to\n    him and idly tucks in the plaid blanket resting over the\n    man's knees.\n\n                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n                 ... Dad, I left my job at the\n                 Agency...\n\n    The old man stares out into the wind.\n\n                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n                 ... I, uh... I'm sorry. Dad,\n                 government service is not what it was\n                 when you were in State. Things are\n                 different now. I don't know, maybe\n                 it's... it's... the Cold War ending;\n                 now it seems like it's all bureaucracy\n                 and no mission...\n\n    The old man stares out into the wind.\n\n                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n                 ... I'm writing a memoir. I think\n                 it's going to be pretty explosive.\n                 But I don't think you'll disapprove.\n                 I don't think you'll disapprove.\n                 Katie has had trouble accepting it.\n                           (MORE)\n\n                                                             12.\n\n                          OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n               But... sometimes there's a higher\n               patriotism, Dad. So we'll... Yes,\n               change is hard. It's hard on Katie.\n               But we'll be okay. We'll be okay.\n               Life is change. This is good. We\n               were all blocked up, Katie and me.\n               This is, this is a blessing in\n               disguise. I'll go into training, you\n               know. Lay off the sauce. Like you\n               did. You managed to do it. Finally.\n               And then I can concentrate on, you\n               know. New beginning. And this'll all\n               have been for the best. Don't you\n               think Dad?\n\n     The old man stares out into the wind.\n\n     Osbourne sniffles.\n\n                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n               ... Cold.\n\n     He taps the old man on the knee and rises.\n\n                         OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n               ... I guess we should head back.\n\n\n10   EXT. PIER - DAY                                                10\n\n     LONG SHOT THRU THE WINDSHIELD OF A CAR\n\n     The sailboat docked at the end of a marina. Osbourne is\n     pushing the old man in a wheel chair down the pier away from\n     the boat.\n\n                         A MAN'S VOICE\n               We've seen this...\n\n\n11   INT. LAW FIRM - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                          11\n\n     THE MAN\n\n     White hair, bushy eyebrows, a florid face. He is in a law-\n     book lined conference room. He wears an expensive suit,\n     suspenders, a white shirt with blue collar and cuffs. He is\n     Bogus Terikhian.\n\n                          TERIKHIAN\n               ... I know this kind of man.    We've\n               seen this.\n\n                                                        13.\n\n\nWider on the conference room shows that Katie Cox sits at the\ntable, along with Terikhian, another lawyer, and an\nassistant.\n\n                       TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)\n             ... Mrs. Cox, you can't let this man\n             take advantage of you. And he will.\n             He will.\n\n                         KATIE\n             Yes. This is my fear. He's trying----\n             he says----he's trying to pull himself\n             together, but...\n\n                       TERIKHIAN\n             Look, sure, I----I'm obliged to tell you\n             you should try to salvage things. And\n             you should. People turn themselves\n             around. Not unheard-of. But. You----\n             you haven't broached the possibility\n             of divorce yet?\n\n                         KATIE\n             No.\n\n                       TERIKHIAN\n             Well that's good.   Because first you\n             should get all his financials. Before\n             he's forewarned. Because here's a\n             man, here's a man, practiced in\n             deceit, this is almost, you could say\n             it's his job, practiced at hiding\n             things, and there is no reason, it is\n             not improper, there is no reason for\n             you not to get a picture of the\n             household finances. Paper files,\n             computer files, whatever----this is your\n             prerogative. You can be a spy too,\n             madam. Do this before you put him on\n             alert. Before the turtle can draw in\n             his head and his, uh...\n\nHe waggles his hands, groping for the word.\n\n                         TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)\n             ... Feet.\n\nHe shrugs.\n\n                       TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)\n             ... And hopefully everything will work\n             out. He will reform. But! If not:\n             forewarned is forearmed.\n\n                                                              14.\n\n\n12   INT. COX HOUSE - DAY                                            12\n\n     Osbourne is splayed on an easy chair, wearing a bathrobe over\n     pyjamas. He stares at the ceiling, motionless, arms out-\n     flung, like Marat in his bathtub.\n\n     A long still beat.   A clock ticks.\n\n     Abruptly Osbourne raises one hand to speak into a\n     microcassette recorder.\n\n                         OSBOURNE\n               We were young and committed and there\n               was nothing we couldn't do. We\n               thought of the Agency less as... less\n               as...\n\n     The thought, such as it was, peters out.   Osbourne rises and\n     wanders around the room, glassy-eyed.\n\n     He suddenly raises the microcassette again.\n\n                         OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n               ... The principles of George Kennan----a\n               personal hero of mine----were what\n               animated us. In fact they were what\n               had originally inspired me to enter\n               government service. Like the State\n               Department's China Hands of yore, or,\n               in a different forum, in a different\n               venue, in a different medium, in,\n               um... \"Murrow's Boys,\" the fabled----in\n               a different----\n\n     He suddenly stops, head cocked, listening.\n\n     Faintly, a ringing phone.\n\n\n13   INT. COX BASEMENT STAIRWAY - DAY                                13\n\n     At the cut Osbourne is thundering down a steep carpeted\n     stairway. He inclines his head to clear the ceiling that\n     juts over the bottom half of the stairwell.\n\n     The phone is louder here.\n\n\n14   INT. COX BASEMENT - DAY                                         14\n\n     A semi-finished basement with cheap paneling and a low\n     dropped ceiling of water-stained Johnson-Armstrong tile. The\n     ringing phone is on a cheap government-surplus desk. The\n     answering machine, with Osbourne's voice, picks up:\n\n                                                                 15.\n\n\n                          MACHINE\n                You have reached The Cox Group...\n\n     Osbourne, robe flapping, shuffles hurriedly in his slippered\n     feet toward the phone.\n\n                          MACHINE (CONT'D)\n                ...

A\n     listening beat.\n\n                          OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n                ... Yes?... Oh, no... No, call her\n                number...

Mild chuckle from\n     Osbourne in the foreground.\n\n\n16   INT LIVING ROOM - DAY - STILL LATER                                16\n\n     Ticking clock. Osbourne paces with the microcassette\n     recorder. He raises it with a thought, draws a breath, and\n     then stops, and looks off.\n\n     The ticking grandfather clock: ornate hands on an ornate\n     clock face Two or three minutes to five.\n\n     Osbourne stares for a long beat.\n\n\n17   INT.

The amber liquid tops the hatch mark.    He\n     conscientiously pours the overage back, murmuring:\n\n                            OSBOURNE\n               Single...\n\n     He dumps the shot into the Coke.\n\n\n18   EXT.

As water laps against pilings and the\n     boat gently bobs and creaks, we hear, muffled, the sounds of\n     a couple having sex. When it builds to climax we cut:\n\n\n19   INT.

Brow furrows.   He spins, jogs backwards,\n     looking.\n\n     His point-of-view: nothing unusual; traffic on the bridge, no\n     pedestrians particularly close.\n\n     Harry, mildly puzzled, slows and stops.

She cracks open a CD case and loads the CD into\n     Osbourne's computer. A suspense drone builds as we track in.\n\n     Katie starts typing, then suddenly stops. She holds still,\n     listening for noises in the house. Nothing. She resumes\n     typing.\n\n     We hear male voices beginning to swell in song.

Subterfuge. You\n               go, I'm not that person. The choices\n               you made, you can't, just through\n               inertia----\n\n                         KATIE\n               I'm thinking of divorcing Ozzie.\n\n     Harry doesn't react----a careful, studied non-reaction.

Yes, I should settle things.\n               With Sandy. Because of you and me.\n               It just takes, courage, you know. To\n               inflict that pain.

On its forward arc a dildo\n     emerges from the center of the seat's pipe-track, angled\n     toward the seat-bottom which is cleft to accommodate its\n     entrance.\n\n     A long beat as the seat squeaks back and forth, the dildo\n     rhythmically bobbing up and down.\n\n     At length:\n\n                              LINDA\n                  Omygod!\n\n     Another couple of cycles.\n\n                            LINDA (CONT'D)\n                  ...

Rain.\n\n     The car corners into a driveway and its headlights rake the\n     front of the Cox townhouse, which is dark.

Katie Cox emerges from\n     the driver's side.\n\n     Reverse shows Chad, in his suit, watching from a parked car\n     across the street.\n\n     Now Harry Pfarrer emerges from the passenger side wearing a\n     brown pin-striped suit. Encumbered by something bulky he\n     follows Katie up the walk.\n\n     It seems to be some kind of pillow or cushion under his arm,\n     but very large, and wedge-shaped. Katie is letting herself\n     in; Harry gives a furtive glance around----as Chad sinks back\n     in his car seat----before entering with the wedge-cushion.\n\n     The door closes.\n\n     Chad relaxes, straightens up.   A beat.   He looks idly around.\n     He notices:\n\n     Another car, parked on the same side of the street, further\n     up. Someone is just straightening from a slouch to become\n     visible over the driver's headrest.\n\n     Chad looks, puzzled.\n\n\n94   INT. CAR/EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY - LATER                         94\n\n     Chad is sucking the dregs of his Jamba Juice up a straw when\n     a noise brings his look around:\n\n                                                               74.\n\n\n     The door to the townhouse is opening. Katie emerges, in a\n     change of clothes. Harry follows in sweats.\n\n     They get into her car.   It pulls out.\n\n     Chad watches it go up the street.    He is about to open his\n     door but pauses, seeing:\n\n     The parked car up the street. Katie's car having passed, it\n     now pulls out and follows at a discreet distance. Both cars\n     disappear.\n\n     Chad opens his door and gets out. He is crossing to the\n     townhouse when he notices another car parked on the other\n     side of the street. A man sits in the driver's seat,\n     smoking.\n\n     Chad proceeds on to the house. There is a barred garden-\n     level door tucked under the stoop. Chad checks out the\n     caging on the door. He looks up the fa\u00e7ade of the house.\n\n\n95   INT. KATIE'S CAR/EXT.

Chad checks out the\n      windows in back, then goes to the door. It is locked. It\n      has a large window.\n\n\n98    INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BACK WINDOW - DAY                           98\n\n      We can see Chad's form outside the door.   Its pane is tapped\n      once... twice... it breaks.\n\n\n99    EXT.

COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                         104\n\n      Chad is emerging from the basement. He is looking idly\n      around, heading toward the front door when a shape\n      materializes in its frosted glass sidelight.\n\n      Chad freezes.\n\n      There is scraping at the lock.\n\n      Chad quickly mounts the stairs.\n\n\n105   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY                          105\n\n      Chad freezes, listening.\n\n      The downstairs door swings open, shut.\n\n      Footsteps.\n\n      A tread on the stairs: Chad scurries into the first open\n      door.\n\n\n106   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                               106\n\n      Chad hotfoots into a closet and eases its door most of the\n      way shut. The footsteps mount the stairs. Chad peeks out.\n\n      His POV: The bed, bedclothes rumpled.    In the middle of the\n      bed, a wedge-cushion.\n\n                                                           77.\n\n\nBeyond, the open bedroom door shows a slice of hallway and\nstairs. Harry arrives at the top of the stairs. He nudges\nback a drape on the window at the top of the steps. He looks\ndown one way, then the other. He lets the drape fall back\nand seems to relax.\n\nHarry enters the bedroom. He strips off his shirt and steps\nout of his pants on his way into the bathroom off the master\nbedroom. He leaves the door open.\n\nChad reaches gingerly for the closet door to close it but\nstops abruptly as we hear the shower turned off and the\ncurtain whipped back. Harry emerges from the shower. He\nrinses off, humming \"Born Free,\" and walks into the\nforeground pulling on shorts and shirt and a pair of dress\npants that was draped across a bureau.\n\nChad shrinks back into the closet as Harry approaches.     Harry\nstops, just outside the cracked door.\n\nThrough the crack we see only the white of his shirt.\nAbruptly Harry turns his back to us and recedes into the room\nand bends to pick something off the floor.\n\nChad leans in ever so slightly to see, but draws back again\nas Harry approaches.\n\nChad looks over to his right: on a hanger, the brown\npinstripe coat that matches Harry's pants.\n\nThe closet door is thrown open.\n\n                     CHAD\n          Nuhhh!\n\n                    HARRY\n          AHHHHHHHHHH!\n\nHarry jerks up the gun which he's pulled from the shoulder\nholster in his other hand and----BAM----shoots Chad in the face.\n\nThe gun bucks. Unused to the recoil and still screaming,\nHarry staggers back and trips over the edge of the bed and\ndrops the weapon.\n\nHe crabs briefly backward and then flips over and scrambles\noff on all fours. In the hallway he rises and tramples down\nthe stairs.\n\n                                                                78.\n\n\n107   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BOTTOM OF STAIRS - DAY                     107\n\n      He stops at the bottom of the steps, panting. He looks back\n      up the steps, trying to control his heavy breathing so that\n      he can listen.\n\n      A long silence.\n\n                                HARRY\n                   ...

COX TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY                                109\n\n      Harry enters from the kitchen and starts slowly mounting the\n      stairs, a chopping knife in one hand.\n\n                                HARRY\n                   ... Hello?\n\n\n110   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY                         110\n\n      Harry tops the stairs.       He pauses, looking at:\n\n      The bedroom door, ajar.\n\n      Inside, his gun lies on the floor.\n\n      Harry takes cautious steps toward the door.\n\n      He pauses at the cracked door.      Suddenly:\n\n                                HARRY\n                   Hungh!\n\n      He plunges through the door and runs for the gun and scoops\n      it, dropping the knife.\n\n      He stands and spins, panting.\n\n      His point-of-view: the closet. Its door ajar. Legs protrude\n      into the room as if Chad, hidden within, is sitting with his\n      back against the closet wall contemplating his next move.\n\n                                                             79.\n\n\nHarry walks cautiously over. With a bare foot he\nexperimentally waggles one of Chad's feet. Limp.\n\nHarry nudges the door.\n\n                       HARRY (CONT'D)\n          ... Hello?\n\nIt creaks fully open.\n\n                    HARRY (CONT'D)\n          ... Omygod. Omygod.\n\nChad's face is a powder-burned, chewed-up mess.\n\n                    HARRY (CONT'D)\n          ... Omygod who are you. You fucker.\n          Omygod.\n\nHe gingerly crouches down.\n\n                    HARRY (CONT'D)\n          ... You fucker...\n\nHe tries to avert his eyes as he feels in Chad's suit\npockets.\n\n                    HARRY (CONT'D)\n          ... Omygod, my god...

What the fuck...\n\nHe leans back in, trying not to look, but for some reason\nfeeling obliged to return the wallet.\n\nAs he opens the suit coat to slip it back in the inside\npocket he notices:\n\nThe suit label has been cut away.       He fingers the raveled\nfringe.\n\n                    HARRY (CONT'D)\n          ... Oh my fuck...\n\nHe straightens up again.\n\n                                                              80.\n\n\n                          HARRY (CONT'D)\n                ...

CIA HEADQUARTERS - DOOR/PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY              112\n\n      We are low, outside an office door. The shoes enter frame\n      and the door is swung inward, away from us, to show Palmer\n      DeBakey Smith seated behind his desk.\n\n      He looks up.\n\n                            PALMER\n                Olson.

CIA HEADQUARTERS - ANOTHER DOOR/CHUBB'S OFFICE - DAY       115\n\n      Palmer Smith's back enters and he swings the door open. A\n      silver-haired man looks up from his desk where he is leaned\n      back, eating orange sections off a paper towel on the\n      desktop.\n\n                            MAN\n                Palmer.

A desktop nameplate\nidentifies his superior as Gardner McC. Chubb.\n\nPalmer hands a folder across, grimacing.\n\n                    PALMER (CONT'D)\n          ...

The people you use.\n\n      A long beat.\n\n                                                                 96.\n\n\n                          SANDY\n                You've written a children's book?\n\n                            OSBOURNE\n                No! No no, a, a kind of a memoir, but\n                ----doesn't your company have an adult\n                arm? Or isn't it, uh, the children's\n                arm?

His drink is in his\n      other hand. Ice cubes clink as he moves.\n\n      The living room is empty.\n\n      Osbourne advances cautiously.     A quick sidelong look at the\n      kitchen.\n\n      Empty.\n\n      He proceeds to the basement door.\n\n\n146   INT. LINDA'S CAR/EXT.

She rolls down her window, sticks her head\n      out, looks up.\n\n      A black helicopter hovers overhead, rotors thudding. A black-\n      clad body leans partway out. The person seems to be looking\n      down.\n\n      Linda draws her head back in.\n\n                           LINDA\n                 Oh for Pete's sake.\n\n\n147   INT.

CIA HEADQUARTERS - AERIAL - DAY                        150\n\n      We pull up, back through the clouds, away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurn After Reading\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Joel Coen\u00a0\u00a0Ethan Coen\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Crime\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb", "summary": "Faced with a demotion at work due to a drinking problem, angry Osbourne Cox quits his job as a CIA analyst and resolves to write a memoir about his life and career. When his pediatrician wife Katie finds out, she sees it as a justifiable opportunity to file for divorce and continue her adulterous affair unimpeded. Taking her lawyer's advice, she copies financial records and several other files from her husband's computer onto a CD. These files contain a rambling, meaningless diatribe by Cox on purported CIA activities.\nWhen the CD gets left on the locker room floor of Hardbodies, a local gym, by a careless law firm employee, it falls into the hands of dim-witted personal trainer Chad Feldheimer and his co-worker Linda Litzke, who mistakenly believe the numerical data in the Cox's bank records, and especially, Cox' diatribes, to be highly sensitive government information. After getting the data traced back to Osbourne, who thinks his memoirs have been stolen, Chad and Linda plan to give the disc back to him for a reward, with Linda planning to use the money to pay for plastic surgery. When a phone call and subsequent meeting with Osbourne provoke a furious reaction and go horribly wrong, Chad and Linda turn over the disc to the Russian embassy, offering more information in return for monetary compensation. With no other data to give them, Linda persuades Chad to sneak into the Cox's home to get more files from their computer.\nMeanwhile, Osbourne's increasingly erratic behavior, aggravated in part by his encounters with Chad and Linda, prompt Katie to move ahead with the divorce proceedings. She changes the locks on their house, forcing Osbourne to move onto the sailboat they have docked on the Chesapeake Bay. With her husband out of the picture, Katie invites her lover, Harry Pfarrer, to move in. A womanizing, multi-adulterous deputy U.S. Marshal, Harry is coincidentally also secretly seeing Linda. Harry finds Chad, whom Linda sent to find more files on Osbourne, hiding in a wardrobe in the Cox's home, panics, and fatally shoots Chad.\nTwo days later at the CIA headquarters, Palmer Smith, Osbourne's former superior, and his director learn that information from Osbourne has been given to the Russian Embassy. The two men are perplexed, given Osbourne's low-level security clearance, the material delivered to the Russians being of no importance to anyone, and the apparent motive of all involved parties remaining unknown. Smith is told to maintain observation until the situation \"makes sense\". Harry, burdened by keeping the day prior's events secret, gets into an argument with Katie and decides to leave the house. On his way out, he spots a man who has been trailing him for the past several days. After tackling him to the ground, Harry finds out that the man is a private detective hired by his wife Sandra \"Sandy\" to gather evidence for impending divorce proceedings. Sandy is shown to be having an extramarital liaison of her own. Harry is devastated and goes to see an agitated Linda, who confides in Harry that Chad is missing. Harry agrees to help find Chad.\nThe next morning, Harry and Linda meet in a park, and Linda provides him with more information about Chad's disappearance. When Linda mentions the name \"Osbourne Cox\", Harry figures out that Chad is the man he shot. He panics, realizes that there are strange men in the park (most likely the CIA people trailing Linda) and flees, assuming Linda is a spy. Linda then turns to Ted Treffon, the kindhearted manager of Hardbodies, who has unrequited feelings for her and has been critical of Linda and Chad's scheming thus far. Believing the Russians have kidnapped Chad, he agrees to go to the Cox's home to search Osbourne's computer. Unemployed and having spent the past several days living on a small boat, Osbourne becomes unhinged when he finds out that Katie has emptied his bank accounts and, no longer having keys, decides to break into the house to get some of his personal belongings. Finding Ted in the basement, Osbourne initially takes him to be Katie's lover. He soon realizes Ted's affiliation with Linda and what he refers to as the \"league of morons\" he feels that he has been struggling against his whole life and kills Ted.\nAt CIA headquarters a few days later, Palmer and his director try to understand what exactly happened. It is revealed that while trying to board a flight to Venezuela, Harry was detained because his name was on a hot list and that the CIA are holding Linda, who is promising to \"play ball\" and \"sit on it\" if they will pay for her plastic surgery. A CIA agent shot Osbourne during his assault on Ted and the bullet has put Osbourne in a coma. The director instructs Palmer to let Harry fly to Venezuela (as that country has no extradition treaty with the US and therefore will not send him back) and pay for Linda's surgery. The director and Palmer conclude that despite their oversight and the unusual events that have unfolded, there appears to be no lesson for the agency to have learned, be it moral, espionage, or otherwise. \"I guess we learned not to do it again,\" the director concludes (despite not knowing exactly what they did), and closes his file.\nMeanwhile, staff at the Russian embassy have dismissed the contents of Cox' ramblings in the files from his computer - arguably the one factor that started off the entire chain of events - as \"drivel\"."}

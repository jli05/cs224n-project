FARMHOUSE - MORNING\n\n               The CAMERA follows a SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, long hair, pretty \n               Sunday church dress, walking toward a peaceful farmhouse. At \n               the door she lifts the knocker. The door opens slightly.

Our lead story:\n\n               Slowly, the sounds of a CROWD emerge in the background.\n\n               FADE UP ON: HIGH SCHOOL kids sitting on the hood and front \n               seat of a CHEW parked at the edge of a CROWD of 200 people. \n               Truman watches. It is COLD. A fat, shivering CO-ED reads the \n               headline in the Kansas City Star: \"Police Fear Lynch Mob.\" \n               The CAR RADIO is on.\n\n                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\n                         ...newsmen from six states have joined \n                         scores of Kansans as they await the \n                         arrival of confessed killers Perry \n                         Smith and Richard Hickock.

Old ladies; \n               ranchers; local businessmen; moms with kids; journalists \n               INTERVIEWING citizens; photographers lined up at the bottom \n               of the COURTHOUSE STEPS. We hear snippets of conversation as \n               we pass. A CITIZEN is being interviewed by a JOURNALIST; a \n               MOM WITH BABY standing with a FRIEND; a MIDDLE-AGED man in \n               an overcoat CRYING silently.\n\n               Truman approaches Nelle and Marie Dewey, standing together \n               at the curb in front of the courthouse, near the \n               photographers. They are talking quietly, turn to Truman --\n\n                                     NELLE\n                         Hey.\n\n               We hear LOUD CROWD NOISE at the south end of the square. A \n               CONVOY of FOUR CARS enters the square. It pulls around to \n               the front of the courthouse. STATE TROOPERS spill out of the \n               lead and rear CARS. Nye gets out of the second car. He opens \n               the back door. The crowd falls SILENT. Two state troopers \n               get DICK HICKOCK -- handcuffed, pale -- out of the car and \n               lead him up the steps. FLASH. FLASH.\n\n               Dewey and Church open the third car's back door. Silence. \n               They retrieve PERRY SMITH. Perry is extremely SHORT, STRONG, \n               ODDLY BEAUTIFUL, with the dark skin and hair of his American \n               Indian mother, and the pug features of his Irish father. As \n               he stands, he has trouble straightening his stubby LEGS, as \n               if they are arthritic. Truman stares.\n\n                                     MARIE\n                              (whispers to Truman)\n                         Motorcycle accident.

Perry seems terrified of \n               the crowd, all the faces, like a child. Perry scans the crowd. \n               His eyes fall on Truman. FLASH. FLASH. Truman and Perry look \n               at each other as Perry is led slowly past. At the top of the \n               steps the COURTHOUSE DOORS slam shut.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               EXT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE (4TH FLOOR OF COURTHOUSE ) - \n               MORNING\n\n               FADE IN: Truman knocks on the door, a NEWSPAPER, a BOOK, and \n               a PAPER BAG in his hand. On the door it says \"SHERIFF'S \n               RESIDENCE - PRIVATE\".

SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, FOYER - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Truman walks into the residence. To the left is the kitchen; \n               to the right is the living room. Truman looks back at Dorothy -- \n               she's still on the phone. He heads for the kitchen.\n\n               INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Truman walks slowly through the doorway of the large kitchen. \n               On the far side of the kitchen is a JAIL CELL. Inside the \n               cell is PERRY SMITH. (Now we know why Truman came here.)\n\n               Truman STARES. Perry doesn't see him -- he's resting his \n               head on a small table, the tip of his THUMB in his mouth. \n               The chair seems too tall for Perry. He looks like a lonely \n               kindergartner, told to take his afternoon nap. After several \n               moments, Dorothy enters, flustered:\n\n                                     DOROTHY\n                         Oh. Truman.

COURTROOM - DAY\n\n               Judge ROLAND TATE, white-haired, imperious, bangs his gavel. \n               The packed crowd quiets down. Perry and Dick sit at the \n               defense table chewing JUICY FRUIT GUM. Next to them: their \n               aged court-appointed lawyer, Franklin Weeks (70).\n\n               Dick wears a SHIRT AND TIE. Perry wears jeans rolled up at \n               the cuff, his SHIRT OPEN at the collar. He draws on a piece \n               of paper with a STUBBY PENCIL -- a rather good picture of a \n               LARGE PARROT. Truman sits with Nelle, watching Perry --\n\n                                     TRUMAN\n                              (murmurs)\n                         His feet don't touch the floor.\n\n                                     JUDGE TATE\n                         In the matter of the State of Kansas \n                         v.

They are led away in handcuffs. \n               Franklin Weeks stands slowly, then begins gathering his things -- \n               he's old and it takes him ages to collect his papers.

An UNEATEN LUNCH TRAY lies on the \n               floor -- a cockroach runs over it. Truman watches, disturbed.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT\n\n               Camera follows Truman as he walks down an aisle with a small \n               WICKER BASKET. He stops, looks at a shelf.\n\n               INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT\n\n               Truman waits in the check-out line behind a MOM paying for \n               her groceries. Her SON (3) stands next to her legs, wearing \n               a little cowboy hat and cradling a TOY GUN to his chest. He \n               sucks his thumb. Truman and the boy look at each other.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY\n\n               Truman sits on the chair, his WICKER BASKET on the table. He \n               has spread out a cloth napkin. A GUARD watches from outside \n               the cell. Perry lies completely still on the cot. Truman \n               takes out jars of BONNET BABY FOOD, inspects the labels.\n\n                                     TRUMAN\n                              (to Perry)\n                         I don't care what your plans are for \n                         yourself...\n\n               He decides on the CUSTARD jar. He opens it, takes a plastic \n               BABY SPOON from the basket.\n\n                                     TRUMAN\n                         But you're gonna wake up enough to \n                         tell me what you did with my tie.\n\n               He spoons a bit into Perry's mouth. The GUARD walks away. \n               Truman leans close to Perry, whispers:\n\n                                     TRUMAN\n                         It's okay. It's Truman.

Truman stands against the wall watching him. \n               He has cleaned up the basket of food. He walks over to Perry's \n               desk, sees two handwritten notebooks on it: THE PRIVATE DIARY \n               OF PERRY EDWARD SMITH and PERSONAL DICTIONARY. Next to them, \n               he sees a pencil SELF-PORTRAIT Perry drew. It's very good. \n               Truman touches it.\n\n               INT. KSP DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (EVENING)\n\n               Perry sleeps. Truman sits on the chair watching, waiting. \n               Perry opens his eyes, looks at Truman.\n\n               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (NIGHT)\n\n               Perry is sitting up a bit, Truman helps him sip a cup of \n               water. Perry lies back down. He's looking at Truman.\n\n                                     TRUMAN\n                         How'd you learn to draw like that?\n\n               Perry closes his eyes.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - EVENING\n\n               Perry sits on the bed, cleaned up, wet hair neatly combed, \n               looking at a few OLD SNAPSHOTS he has saved in a handkerchief. \n               Truman sits in the chair across from him. Perry hands him a \n               photo of his mother. Perry speaks quietly.\n\n                                     PERRY\n                         Before she had us.

I was abandoned repeatedly as \n                         a child. My mama'd drag me along to \n                         some new town so she could take up \n                         with another man she'd met. Night \n                         after night she'd lock me in the \n                         hotel room -- Mama'd turn the latch \n                         and tell the staff not to let me out \n                         no matter what.

Truman opens it.\n\n               He takes out PERRY'S NOTEBOOKS -- the DIARY and PERSONAL \n               DICTIONARY. He opens the Diary. Toward the end, he finds \n               Perry's final entry. He READS silently.

While reading The New York Times, Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is riveted by the story and calls The New Yorker magazine editor William Shawn (Bob Balaban) to tell him that he plans to document the tragedy.\nCapote travels to Kansas, inviting childhood friend Nelle Harper Lee (Catherine Keener) to come along. He intends to interview those involved with the Clutter family, with Lee as his go-between and facilitator. Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper), the Kansas Bureau of Investigation's lead detective on the case, brushes him off, but Dewey's wife Marie (Amy Ryan) is a fan of Capote's writing and persuades her husband to invite Capote and Lee to their house for dinner.\nCapote's stories of movie sets and film stars captivate Marie. Over time, her husband warms up to Capote and allows him to view the photographs of the victims. The Deweys, Lee, and Capote are having dinner when the murder suspects, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard \"Dick\" Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), are caught. Flattery, bribery, and a keen insight into the human condition facilitate Capote's visits to the prison where the accused are held.\nCapote begins to form an attachment to Smith. He informs Shawn of his intent to expand the story into a full-length book. Following the trial and conviction, Capote gains continued access to the murderers by bribing Warden Marshall Krutch (Marshall Bell).\nCapote spends the following years regularly visiting Smith and learning about his life, excepting a year-long stint when he goes to Morocco and Spain to write the \"first three parts\" of the book, accompanied by his romantic partner Jack Dunphy (Bruce Greenwood).\nThe story of Smith's life, his remorseful manner, and his emotional sincerity impress Capote, who becomes emotionally attached to him despite the gruesome murders. Capote aids Smith and Hickock by obtaining expert legal counsel for them and initiating an appeal. Still he is frustrated, as Smith declines to relate exactly what happened on the night of the murders.\nThough initially an effort to provide proper representation and extend Capote's opportunity to speak with the killers, the appeals process drags on for several years. Without the court case being resolved, Capote feels he is stuck with a story without an ending, and he is unable to complete his book. Eventually he gets Smith to describe the killings and his thoughts at the time in great detail. He has what he was after from Smith, but in the process he sees a callousness and selfishness in his own actions.\nNow with everything in hand, Capote still must wait for the appeals process to conclude before he feels he can publish his work. In the course of time, Lee's best-selling novel To Kill a Mockingbird is turned into a movie, but Capote is unable to share in the joy of his friend's success, too caught up in drinking through his own misery.\nWith the last appeal rejected, Smith pleads for Capote to return before he is executed, but Capote cannot bring himself to do so. A telegram from Smith to Harper Lee ultimately compels Capote to return to Kansas. There he is an eyewitness as Smith and Hickock are executed.\nCapote talks to Lee about the horrifying experience and laments that he could not do anything to stop it. She replies, \"Maybe not. The fact is you didn't want to.\" The final scenes show Capote looking through photos from the case and at the writings and drawings given to him by Smith. An epilogue points out that In Cold Blood turned Capote into the most famous writer in America, also noting that he never finished another book."}

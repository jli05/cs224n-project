The faint click of\r\n          the latch.

The girl from the opening scene. LUCY\r\n          SHERIDAN. Darla stands over her with obvious concern.

Emily\r\n          trying to locate a single case amid the stacks and clutter on\r\n          her desk. An angry mother SCREAMING at her on the phone:\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           No one is trying to steal your child,\r\n           they found bruises and cigarette burns --\r\n           Mrs Lynch, I read the medical report --\r\n           well, if you feel you need legal\r\n           representation that's perfectly within\r\n           your rights...\r\n                         \r\n          A flurry of obscenities followed by a dial tone.

Emily shoves the new file onto the shelf above\r\n          her desk. Looks at it guiltily. Takes it down again.\r\n          Handwritten on the front: SHERIDAN, LUCY.\r\n                         \r\n          She opens it. A school portrait of ten-year-old Lucy clipped\r\n          to the preliminary report. The sad face draws Emily in.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Long\r\n          day. Drops the files in a chair. Sprinkles some food in a\r\n          fish tank.

World news. Violence. People suffering.\r\n          Turns it off. Puts on some quiet music. Hits play on her\r\n          answering machine as she flops down barefoot on the sofa with\r\n          a magazine, peeling an orange, decompressing.\r\n                         \r\n           YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE\r\n           Hey, it's Suze, missed you at yoga the\r\n           other day, give me a call.\r\n                         \r\n          BEEP.\r\n                         \r\n           YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE #2\r\n           Hi, Em, Jackie, just checking in, hope\r\n           you're good.\r\n                         \r\n          BEEP.

Well-dressed. Career-\r\n          oriented.

Checks that she has the right\r\n          address. Halfway up the walk something stops her dead in her\r\n                         TRACKS -\r\n                         \r\n          A WOMAN'S FACE\r\n                         \r\n          staring at her through one of the lacy white curtains\r\n          upstairs. Ghostly pale. Gone as soon as she sees it. Emily\r\n          stands frozen for a moment. Walks on.\r\n                         \r\n          She reaches to knock on the door and it opens abruptly, the\r\n          security chain snapping taut. A woman's voice growls at her\r\n          from the darkness inside:\r\n                         \r\n                          WOMAN'S VOICE\r\n           What?\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Emily Jennings.

Then we\r\n          hear the chain unlock. It opens again.\r\n           8.\r\n                         \r\n          And we get our first good look at Lucy's mother. Gaunt.\r\n          Pale. Dark rings under her eyes. She steps aside, not\r\n          welcoming Emily in, merely allowing her to enter.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. SHERIDAN HOUSE - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          It's dark, the curtains drawn. Margaret twitches one open in\r\n          begrudging courtesy. The house is tidy but sad, steeped in a\r\n          kind of puritanical gloom. Lucy peers down through the\r\n          upstairs banister, anxious, unsure what's going on. Emily\r\n          sees her, smiles.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Come down, I'd like to meet you.\r\n                         \r\n          Lucy hesitates, sensing her mother's disapproval. Comes\r\n          slowly down the stairs. Emily shakes her hand.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           My name's Emily.

We hear her open a door and holler into\r\n          the basement over the noise of the power tool.\r\n                         \r\n           MARGARET (O.S.)\r\n           Edward!

FOOTSTEPS pounding\r\n          up the cellar stairs. Emily's and Lucy's faces reflect the\r\n          same simple fear. Their eyes meet.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           It'll be okay.\r\n                         \r\n          Lucy not so sure. The FOOTSTEPS are upon them. EDWARD\r\n          SHERIDAN makes his entrance. A menacing man with a gaunt\r\n          face and dark deep-set eyes. Emily holds out her hand.\r\n           10.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Hi, I'm Emily --\r\n                         \r\n          Edward forgoes the handshake, his contempt obvious. Sits\r\n          beside Lucy on the sofa. Margaret sits on the other side.\r\n          Lucy tenses, trapped between them. Emily speaks with\r\n          kindness and composure. Hostile encounters part of the job.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           I'm here today because Lucy's school is\r\n           concerned about changes they're seeing in\r\n           her academic performance. The kinds of\r\n           changes they're seeing are often\r\n           associated with family problems.\r\n                         \r\n          Edward leans over and whispers something caustic in\r\n          Margaret's ear.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARGARET\r\n           Eddie says we don't have family problems.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           That's just it, many times a family won't\r\n           even know they're having problems until\r\n           it's too late. That's where we come in.\r\n           We help families communicate and learn\r\n           healthier ways of resolving conflict.\r\n                         \r\n          Edward whispers again in Margaret's ear.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARGARET\r\n           Eddie says we don't need your help.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Mr Sheridan, is there some reason you\r\n           won't speak to me directly?\r\n                         \r\n          Edward just stares at her.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n                          (TO MARGARET)\r\n           Is there some reason why your husband\r\n           won't speak to me directly?\r\n                         \r\n          Margaret nods, gives Edward a look as though for permission.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARGARET\r\n           Eddie doesn't like speakin' out of anger.\r\n                         \r\n          Emily does well to hide her fear. Refusing to be\r\n          intimidated, she engages Edward's stare. A battle of wills.\r\n          But his gaze has a murderous intensity she can't match. She\r\n          looks down, shuffling papers. Battle lost.\r\n           11.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

She picks it up\r\n          and it GOES OFF in her hand. Gives her a scare. She puts it\r\n          down. Sees something out the bedroom window. Steps closer.\r\n          Parts the curtains.\r\n                         \r\n          In the backyard, by the garden shed, a long rectangular hole\r\n          has been dug. A SHALLOW GRAVE filling with leaves. Edward's\r\n          handiwork. Emily's seen enough, heads for the door.\r\n                         \r\n          But slows, noticing something odd as she comes back around\r\n          the bed -\r\n                         \r\n          A LONG DEEP SCRATCH\r\n                         \r\n          in the wooden floor, hidden under a long runner rug.

Something - the\r\n          old oak bureau perhaps? - has been dragged repeatedly across\r\n          the room.\r\n                         \r\n          Emily comes over and looks behind the door and sees, on the\r\n          back of it, something even more bizarre -\r\n                         \r\n          TWO MASSIVE DEADBOLTS\r\n           31.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          screwed hastily, crookedly, into the wood.

Looks again at the bureau. Slides it in front of\r\n          the door, a wheelless caster bracket leaving another long\r\n          scratch in the hardwood. And it's clear at this point what\r\n          the deadbolts and bureau add up to -\r\n                         \r\n                         A BARRICADE\r\n                         \r\n          Emily stares at it. Looks over at Edward and Margaret's bed,\r\n          imagining them here behind this door. Slides the bureau\r\n          aside. Opens the deadbolts. And as the door swings open she\r\n          is looking straight down the hall at\r\n                         \r\n                         LUCY'S BEDROOM\r\n                         \r\n          Emily stares, bewildered.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Maybe you got\r\n           curious and went through some, dialed a\r\n           number?\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCY\r\n           It wasn't me, I swear.\r\n                         \r\n          Complete innocence. Emily nods okay, wanting to believe, but\r\n          remembering the stolen photograph.\r\n                         \r\n                          BARRON\r\n           The call was at 2 am, are you ever up\r\n           that late?\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCY\r\n           I didn't call him.\r\n                         \r\n                          BARRON\r\n           Are you ever up that late?\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Mike, she said no.

Emily closes the door. Turns\r\n          around and there's Lucy. Uncomfortably close.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCY\r\n           Do you believe me?\r\n           42.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           I believe you.\r\n                         \r\n          Lucy hugs her and Emily hugs her back, but she's still\r\n          thinking about what Barron said.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

He's sweating,\r\n          shaken by the encounter.\r\n                         \r\n                          DOUG\r\n           Talked to a lot of ten-year-olds, I don't\r\n           think I've ever felt like that before...\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Like what?\r\n                         \r\n                          DOUG\r\n           Threatened.\r\n                          (THEN; BAFFLED)\r\n           I know a specialist, I'll call him in the\r\n           morning.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           What do I do with her in the meantime?\r\n                         \r\n          Doug pauses, no idea, smiles an eerie smile.\r\n                         \r\n                          DOUG\r\n           Don't let her get in your head.\r\n                         \r\n          Exits. His paranoia feeding Emily's. In the hush she hears\r\n          that faint CYCLICAL SQUEAKING. Looks across the darkened\r\n          office to her cubicle where Lucy is turning circles in her\r\n          chair again.\r\n                         \r\n          That face. That face.

Lucy, absently,\r\n          but with an almost surgical precision, is CUTTING PEAS IN\r\n          HALF ON HER PLATE AND EATING THEM ONE BY ONE OFF THE TIP OF\r\n          THE KNIFE. Weird. She stops, self-conscious, looks at Emily\r\n          across the table.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCY\r\n           Are you mad at me?\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           No. Just tired.\r\n           51.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          LUCY\r\n           Want me to brush your hair?\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           That's okay.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCY\r\n           Are you sure?\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Some other time.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCY\r\n                          (STANDS UP)\r\n           It will make you feel better.

DOUG'S CONDO - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Football highlights on a liquid plasma tv. Doug flipping\r\n          through a DSM IV diagnostic manual. The phone RINGS.

Finds the chapter he's looking for. ANTI-\r\n          SOCIAL PERSONALITY TYPE. But he hears it again now -\r\n                         \r\n          BZZZZZZZZT BZZZZZZZZZT - louder, deeper - and realizes, in\r\n          quiet terror, that it's coming from INSIDE HIS EAR.\r\n           53.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. DOUG'S BATHROOM - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Doug opens the medicine cabinet and grabs a Q-tip. Wiggles\r\n          it around in his ear and when he takes it out there's a\r\n                         \r\n                         HORNET\r\n                         \r\n          sitting on the cottony tip, scissoring its wings.\r\n                         \r\n          Doug stares in disbelief. Mouth gaping.\r\n                         \r\n          He throws the Q-tip in the toilet. Hits the flush lever.\r\n          Watches the hornet spiral away. Gone.\r\n                         \r\n          Stares at the empty bowl. Did I just imagine that?\r\n                         \r\n          Shaken, he turns to the sink. Wedges his head under the tap\r\n          and runs water into his ear.\r\n                         \r\n          Straightens and looks at himself in the mirror, toweling his\r\n          face, trying to impose rational thought on the situation.\r\n          But as the water spills from his ear, down his neck, onto his\r\n          shirt, it brings with it -\r\n                         \r\n          TWO MORE LIVE HORNETS, half drowned.\r\n                         \r\n          With a yelp Doug swipes them from his shirt. Crushes them\r\n          underfoot. Terrified, but clinging to rational thought a\r\n          moment longer, he turns his head sideways to the mirror,\r\n          parts his hair, and sees -\r\n                         \r\n          ANOTHER HORNET crawl from the ear canal, followed by SIX OR\r\n          SEVEN MORE!\r\n                         \r\n                          DOUG\r\n           FUCK!\r\n                         \r\n          Rationality goes out the window. He flails at them with the\r\n          towel. Swats them dead. Picks them up and drops them in the\r\n          toilet. Studies the last one for a moment. Its little legs\r\n          twitching. Drops it in. Flushes.\r\n                         \r\n          A false respite. And a brief one. Because as the FLUSHING\r\n          NOISE FADES he can hear an ominous DEEP BUZZING SOUND RISING.\r\n                         \r\n          It's coming from behind him. He turns to have a look.\r\n          Nothing there. Bare wall.\r\n                         \r\n          But it's strange: the BUZZING IS STILL BEHIND HIM.\r\n                         \r\n          With dawning horror Doug turns and checks his back in the\r\n          mirror, sees\r\n           54.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          HIS ENTIRE SHIRT BACK IS CRAWLING WITH HORNETS!\r\n                         \r\n          Whimpering like a child, he undoes the buttons of his shirt,\r\n          taking it off as delicately as possible. Slipping his arms\r\n          gently from the sleeves.\r\n                         \r\n          Holding it by the collar, he takes two quick steps and tosses\r\n          it in the shower. Slams the glass door, seals the crack with\r\n          towels. And watches the hornets fly around in the glass\r\n          enclosure, BUZZING FURIOUSLY, bouncing off the glass.\r\n                         \r\n          But as he backpedals he realizes the FURIOUS BUZZING is too\r\n          close, too loud and too deep, to be coming from the shower\r\n          over there. A sharp pain in his head confirms it. He GROANS\r\n          and brings a hand to his ear as something awful happens\r\n          inside.\r\n                         \r\n          The BUZZING in his right ear spreads to his left - LOUDER,\r\n          ANGRIER, its sources multiplying. Disoriented, he stumbles\r\n          backwards with an AGONIZING SCREAM. Catches sight of himself\r\n          in the mirror, the terror of the moment on his face. This\r\n          can't be happening.\r\n                         \r\n          And now the nightmare takes a devilish turn. Looking at\r\n          himself in the mirror, he sees -\r\n                         \r\n          HORNETS START CRAWLING FROM HIS NOSE. FROM BETWEEN HIS LIPS.\r\n          FROM UNDER HIS EYELIDS. THE BUZZING NOW UNBEARABLY LOUD. AN\r\n          ENTIRE SWARM RAGING INSIDE HIS SKULL, FIGHTING ITS WAY OUT!\r\n                         \r\n          Doug grabs his head in both hands and starts shaking it,\r\n          trying to shake away the madness inside. But the hornets\r\n          keep coming, COUGHED UP IN CLUMPS as he gasps for air.\r\n          They're all over him, stinging his tongue, his eyes.\r\n                         \r\n          He goes berserk and starts SMASHING HIS HEAD against the\r\n          wall, the door, the edge of the sink, anything he can find,\r\n          opening a deep gash in his forehead, smashing it harder and\r\n          harder because the BUZZING WON'T STOP, cracking his skull,\r\n          SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY, pitching his head violently forwards\r\n          and backwards like some demon-possessed heavy metal fanatic.\r\n                         \r\n          It's a grotesque display that ends on a sickening note when,\r\n          with one particularly violent head jerk, he snaps his own\r\n          neck - CRACK!!! He sinks to the floor, head askew,\r\n          astonished look on his face.\r\n                         \r\n          And there he sits, paralyzed, eyes locked on the tv in the\r\n          living room where football highlights play in silence. Fully\r\n          conscious as the hornets fight their way back into his ears,\r\n          nose, and mouth - a pilgrimage back to the mind that bore\r\n          them.\r\n           55.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Some\r\n          secrets perhaps best left untold.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARGARET\r\n           She can make you see things.

It's a side of her we've never seen. Human.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARGARET\r\n           ...and I mean they was healthy boys,\r\n           healthy as can be.

Embarrassed.\r\n          Unaccustomed to crying in front of strangers.\r\n                         \r\n                          INTERVIEWER\r\n           Why do you imagine you were spared?\r\n                         \r\n                          MARGARET\r\n           I guess she couldn't get rid of us till\r\n           she found somebody else. Now that she\r\n           has, I don't imagine we're long for this\r\n           world.\r\n                         \r\n          CLOSE UP ON MARGARET - face streaked with tears, her pain\r\n          deep and undeniable.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          VIDEO OF EDWARD SHERIDAN in a violent rage. Pushing his\r\n          chair back from the interview table, he stands, screaming\r\n          through clenched teeth, his broken jaw wired shut:\r\n                         \r\n                          EDWARD\r\n           THE HELL DID I JUST SAY?!\r\n                         \r\n                          INTERVIEWER\r\n           Edward, please calm --\r\n                         \r\n                          EDWARD\r\n           YOU AND YOUR GODDAMN QUESTIONS! YOU\r\n           DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!\r\n                         \r\n          A pair of orderlies rush in to restrain him. The CAMERA gets\r\n          knocked ajar in the struggle. The tape ends as they take\r\n          Edward screaming to the floor.\r\n                         \r\n                          EDWARD\r\n           IT'S NOT CHILD KILLING IF SHE'S NOT A\r\n           CHILD!\r\n           63.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          And that's the interview. Emily stares at the BLANK BLUE\r\n          SCREEN, transfixed, lowers her gaze to the table.\r\n                         \r\n          There's a PHOTO tucked inside the psychiatric file. Edward\r\n          and Margaret in happier times - YOUNG BIBLE CAMP COUNSELORS\r\n          in T-shirts and hiking boots on a path through sunlit forest.\r\n          Sweet. Innocent. Emily's age. The year they met perhaps.\r\n                         \r\n          She holds it up to the newspaper mugshots for a before-and-\r\n          after comparison. The transformation of their faces is\r\n          shocking. Emily sits frozen by the realization: Edward and\r\n          Margaret Sheridan. Not criminals. Victims.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          An old brick orphanage turned psychiatric hospital. Emily's\r\n          Volvo goes up the winding tree-lined drive.\r\n                         \r\n           CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST (V.O.)\r\n           Unfortunately Mrs Sheridan suffered a\r\n           rather severe psychotic episode last\r\n           night...\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

She wasn't,\r\n           of course, they managed to sedate her.\r\n           But it's curious, she displays all the\r\n           symptoms of a burn patient. Except the\r\n           burns themselves...\r\n                         \r\n          Margaret's door. Emily peers through a little square of\r\n          reinforced glass. A padded cell. Margaret strapped to a\r\n          bed. Writhing in pain. Laboring to breathe. Eyes swimming.\r\n                         \r\n                          CHIEF PSYCHIATRIST\r\n           In no condition for visitors as you can\r\n           see.

VISITATION ROOM, PSYCH HOSPITAL - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Restrained in a straitjacket, Edward is brought in by two\r\n          orderlies who seat him at a table opposite Emily and then\r\n          exit. Jaw wired, everything he says is spoken through\r\n          clenched teeth.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           I know I'm probably the last person you\r\n           want to see right now, but you're...\r\n                         \r\n          His stare unnerves her.

Sat there in our living room\r\n           tellin' us about our problems, how to be\r\n           better parents - certain of everything\r\n           and dead wrong about all of it.\r\n                          (THEN)\r\n           Ask what you came to ask.\r\n                         \r\n          After a moment:\r\n           65.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           What is she?\r\n                         \r\n          It's a question Edward has asked himself once or twice. He\r\n          leans back in his chair and folds his arms with an almost\r\n          casual air.\r\n                         \r\n                          EDWARD\r\n           Can tell you what she's not. She not a\r\n           daughter of mine. She's not a ten-year-\r\n           old having trouble in school. She's not\r\n           some innocent victim whose door you\r\n           busted down and life you saved. And\r\n           she's not going no place, lady, till\r\n           she's good and done with you.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Done with me how?\r\n                         \r\n                          EDWARD\r\n           However she wants. You think it's an\r\n           accident her ending up with you? She saw\r\n           you coming a mile away.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Why me? I don't have anything.\r\n                         \r\n                          EDWARD\r\n           You have that you're good. Kindness.\r\n           Decency. That's what she feeds on.\r\n           Bleeds ya dry, moves onto the next. We\r\n           were a big family, she went through us\r\n           like a wrecking ball. And you know,\r\n           every time something happened, every\r\n           time, we had an excuse for why it wasn't\r\n           her fault. Cuz it's easier to lie to\r\n           yourself than think bad things about your\r\n           baby girl. But finally we got to a point\r\n           where me and Maggy looked at each other -\r\n           (remembers so clearly)\r\n           - where we looked at each other and we\r\n           was out of lies, both of us.

Dropping them in banker's boxes.\r\n          Stops on Diego's. Eyes his photo. Drops it in.

Sensing\r\n          Emily's stare, she stops and meets it. Waves, testing the\r\n          waters. Emily waves back but it's a hollow gesture. Lucy's\r\n          smile fades, knowing this as she continues toward the house.\r\n           69.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          In a sudden panic Emily goes into the kitchen, grabs one of\r\n          the knives. Eyes the blade, forced to contemplate the\r\n          unthinkable - its use as a weapon, self-defense.\r\n                         \r\n          She comes into the living room, holding it. Catches sight of\r\n          herself in the mirror. A jarring image:\r\n                         \r\n          Sweet Emily Jennings with a butcher's knife in her hand.\r\n                         \r\n          The sound of LUCY'S FOOTSTEPS on the front steps breaks the\r\n          spell.\r\n                         \r\n          Emily hides the knife behind the fish tank.

It's in her hand as the door CLICKS\r\n          open, until the last second when she tosses it under a sofa\r\n          pillow.\r\n                         \r\n          Lucy enters. Shy. Innocent.

The point of the knife is almost\r\n          touching her leg. If she moves at all, it will cut the skin.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCY\r\n           Doesn't matter anyway, the bus stops\r\n           right at the end of the street.

Tormenting Emily. Until she can't take it\r\n          anymore.

Gives it a tug.

Emily puts her head in her\r\n          hands, pressing down at her temples. Wayne steps into his\r\n          office in the b.g. and grabs something then they exit.\r\n                         \r\n          And the office is quiet again. Emily closes her eyes. Just\r\n          then, she hears -\r\n                         \r\n          A faint CYCLICAL SQUEAKING NOISE in the cubicle right next to\r\n          hers. Goes rigid. Recognizes the sound. Calls over the\r\n          partition without moving.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Wayne...?\r\n                         \r\n          No reply, but the SQUEAKING CONTINUES. Rising slowly from\r\n          her seat, scared as hell, she leans over her desk and peers\r\n          over the partition into the adjacent cubicle.\r\n                         \r\n          It's empty. But the OFFICE CHAIR IS TURNING as if someone\r\n          were just playing there.\r\n                         \r\n          Emily steps slowly back. And now hears the same CYCLICAL\r\n          SQUEAKING behind her. The opposite row. She spins.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. CHILD SERVICES DEPARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Walks slowly from her cubicle. Comes along the row of\r\n          darkened cubicles, following the sound to its source. This\r\n          is the one. She looks in.\r\n           84.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Empty cubicle. TURNING CHAIR.\r\n                         \r\n          Emily backs away. Terrified. The chair winding slowly to a\r\n          stop.\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly, behind her, at the far end of the office, a\r\n          different NOISE splits the silence. Emily turns and stares\r\n          toward the sound. The XEROX MACHINE. Someone is using it.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Hello...?\r\n                         \r\n          No answer.\r\n                         \r\n          Emily comes slowly down the aisle to the partitioned\r\n          workstation. A torturous walk set to the RHYTHMIC CADENCE of\r\n          the photocopier, the HARSH GREEN LIGHT SWEEPING ACROSS THE\r\n          CEILING ABOVE IT, again and again and again...\r\n                         \r\n          And then it stops, ejecting one final page as Emily enters\r\n          the workstation. And sees there's no one there.\r\n                         \r\n          She stares at the idle machine for a moment, then at the\r\n          STACK OF COPIES lying upsidedown in the tray. She comes\r\n          over, picks them up. Turns them over.\r\n                         \r\n          The first page is a photocopy of a PAIR OF HANDS PRESSED FLAT\r\n          AGAINST THE COPYING GLASS.\r\n                         \r\n          Emily stares, haunted. Tense breath. Continues through the\r\n          stack.\r\n                         \r\n          Successive pages show the same two hands, but leaning forward\r\n          into the inky blackness between them is a FACE, its features\r\n          resolving into murky focus as it approaches the glass. The\r\n          last page is a horrific image. A man screaming in such\r\n          terror that his face appears almost deformed.\r\n                         \r\n          It's DOUG. The night of his death. Like a snapshot from his\r\n          bathroom mirror.\r\n                         \r\n          Emily shudders, the stack of pages tumbling to the floor.\r\n          Runs out. And we see the photocopies, lying on the floor,\r\n          are totally BLANK...\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

But they weren't really secrets\r\n           I guess...\r\n           (looks at Emily)\r\n           ...because I always knew what they were\r\n           thinking.\r\n                         \r\n          She holds Emily's gaze then looks back at the tv. Margaret's\r\n          image reflected in the pupils of her eerie unblinking eyes.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. MARGARET'S PADDED ROOM, PSYCH HOSPITAL - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Margaret, straps unbuckled, sits on the bed beside a YOUNG\r\n          NURSE who checks her temperature. Done, the Nurse heads out.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARGARET\r\n           Don't leave me.\r\n                         \r\n          Terror in Margaret's voice.\r\n                         \r\n                          YOUNG NURSE\r\n           It's okay, Maggie.

The sound of doom to Margaret.\r\n                         \r\n          She stands up, looking around, trembling at what's to come.\r\n          Her footsteps sound oddly HOLLOW, METALLIC on the floor.\r\n           89.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          MARGARET'S POV - surveying the room, we see what Margaret's\r\n          hell looks like. It's not a room she's living in...\r\n                         \r\n          AN OLD OVEN\r\n                         \r\n          With dark scorched metal walls. A bolted-down bed to one\r\n          side, perfectly white, like a practical joke.\r\n                         \r\n          We can hear the low HISS of it filling with gas. The faint\r\n          POOF as it ignites beneath her. The first SHIMMERING WAVES\r\n          OF HEAT rising up, singeing her hair.\r\n                         \r\n          Margaret runs screaming to the door, claws at the pane of\r\n          glass like a madwoman. But there is no escape from the hell\r\n          of her own mind. The YOUNG NURSE'S FACE APPEARS there in the\r\n          window, shocked by Margaret's insane rantings.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Takes another mouthful of food and suddenly stops\r\n          chewing, noticing something very strange:\r\n                         \r\n          A BALD, MORBIDLY OBESE INMATE SITTING DIRECTLY ACROSS THE\r\n          TABLE IS CUTTING PEAS IN HALF ON HIS PLATE, ABSENTLY, BUT\r\n          WITH AN ALMOST SURGICAL PRECISON, EATING THEM ONE BY ONE OFF\r\n          THE TIP OF HIS KNIFE!!\r\n                         \r\n          He lifts his gaze to Edward. Smiles a knowing, taunting\r\n          smile. Then his WIDE WET MOUTH speaks in a little girl's\r\n                         VOICE:\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCY'S VOICE\r\n           I'm happy you're getting the help you\r\n           need, daddy.\r\n                         \r\n          Edward goes berserk. Launches himself across the table at\r\n          the guy, stabbing him in the neck with his fork. Vicious\r\n          attack. Unprovoked as far as anyone else is concerned. A\r\n          guard rushes over. Edward turns on him, maniacal.\r\n                         \r\n          THE GUARD SHOOTS HIM DEAD.\r\n                         \r\n          As blood pools around Edward's body, some LUNATIC who\r\n          witnessed the event starts to applaud. Others join in. It's\r\n          the most excitement they've seen all year. And as the\r\n          applause spreads through the entire cafeteria...\r\n           90.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Comes back and\r\n          picks it up.\r\n                         \r\n          A SMALL PHOTO OF EDWARD ON THE FRONT PAGE WITH A HEADLINE:\r\n          HOSPITAL PROBES DEATH.\r\n                         \r\n          At the bus stop at the end of the street, Lucy mingles\r\n          happily with other CHILDREN. She meets Emily's gaze down the\r\n          length of the sidewalk. Smiles and waves goodbye as she gets\r\n          on the school bus.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. BARRON'S OFFICE, POLICE STATION - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Emily drops the newspaper on Barron's desk.

Gone is the\r\n          quiet assurance. Whatever happened rocked him to the core.\r\n          He closes the door for privacy.\r\n                         \r\n                          BARRON\r\n           There's something I want you to hear.\r\n           Came in at two o'clock last night. You\r\n           might wanna sit.\r\n                         \r\n          Emily sits. Barron cues a voicemail message on his phone,\r\n          plays it over the speaker. After a BEEP we hear it.

Emily digs through her bag. Reaches the bottom.\r\n          No cell phone. Staring into the bag, voice wavering with\r\n                         EMOTION:\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           She's taking me apart, Mike.\r\n                         \r\n          She loses it for a second.

He\r\n          turns and scans the garage behind him. It's quiet, eerily\r\n          still.\r\n                         \r\n          He continues onward, but hears the faint JANGLING SOUND again\r\n          a moment later. Spins, trying to place it. There it is\r\n          again. Closer this time. Something moving, hiding, behind\r\n          the rows of cars over there.\r\n           93.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          He bends, trying to get a look under the cars. Can't see\r\n          anything. Unnerved, he moves on, clicks the button on his\r\n          keychain remote. The lights flash on his car fifty yards\r\n          away.\r\n                         \r\n          But as he continues toward it they reveal themselves,\r\n          trodding into view from between the cars, CHOKE-CHAIN COLLARS\r\n          JANGLING around their necks...\r\n                         \r\n          THREE PIT BULLS\r\n                         \r\n          Battle-scarred. Vicious. The dogs from Diego's house. They\r\n          sit down right in front of Barron's car. It's a surreal\r\n          moment, a trio of attack dogs sitting at quiet attention,\r\n          square-jawwed, black-eyed, the kinetic calm before a predator\r\n          strikes.\r\n                         \r\n          Barron draws his gun. Fires a warning shot over their heads.\r\n                         \r\n          BANG!\r\n                         \r\n          Deafeningly loud, it echoes through the garage like a\r\n          thunderclap. But the dogs don't move, just sit there\r\n          staring.\r\n                         \r\n          Barron lowers his gun. It's time to get the hell out of\r\n          here. He backpedals, making no sudden movements, gun still\r\n          trained on the dogs.\r\n                         \r\n          They watch him, eyes livening with excitement, one of their\r\n          back legs twitching in anticipation.\r\n                         \r\n          Barron quickens his step and that's their cue.\r\n                         \r\n          ALL AT ONCE, WITH EXPLOSIVE SPEED, THE DOGS SPRING INTO\r\n          MOTION, VICIOUS AND MUSCLED AND SMELLING BLOOD.\r\n                         \r\n          Barron fires an errant shot and takes off running. But he\r\n          can't match their pace, the deadly trio race along the row of\r\n          police cruisers, closing the gap with ease.\r\n                         \r\n          At the last second Barron jumps the partition. The pit bulls\r\n          crash skull-first into the concrete, but continue their\r\n          pursuit unfazed as Barron takes off up the adjoining ramp.\r\n                         \r\n          He jumps up onto the row of cars and runs across the hoods,\r\n          denting the metal. The dogs jump up behind him, relentless\r\n          in their pursuit.\r\n                         \r\n          Jaws snapping at his heels, Barron takes to the car roofs,\r\n          the pitbulls leaping from car to car behind him.\r\n           94.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          He looks back just in time to see the dogs launch themselves.\r\n          They hit him at chest height, sinking teeth in his flesh.\r\n                         \r\n          Stumbling forward, struggling to keep their jaws from his\r\n          throat, Barron doesn't see what's coming. The last car. The\r\n          edge of the parking garage.\r\n                         \r\n          He's over the edge before he even understands, flailing his\r\n          arms for a handhold that doesn't exist. The ground, far\r\n          below, flies up at him in a rush of acceleration.\r\n                         \r\n          We hear a sickening THUD and find Barron lying face down on\r\n          the pavement below, blood pooling around him. Clinging to\r\n          life, he opens his eyes and sees the TRIO OF PIT BULLS\r\n          SITTING OBEDIENTLY BESIDE HIM, unharmed, watching.\r\n                         \r\n          But from a distance we see there is only Barron. Dying alone\r\n          between the parked cars. No dogs anywhere in sight.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Emily opens the front door, peers in, trying not to make a\r\n          sound.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Lucy...?\r\n                         \r\n          No reply. She enters. Sees -\r\n                         \r\n          THE CLOSET DOOR IS OPEN.\r\n                         \r\n          She comes closer.\r\n                         \r\n          EMPTY BANKER BOXES strewn in the hall. SCATTERED PAGES.\r\n                         \r\n          At the far end, the light is on in Lucy's bedroom. The door\r\n          open a crack. A shaft of light spilling out into the\r\n          darkened hallway.\r\n                         \r\n          Emily comes down the hallway past SCATTERED FILE PAGES.\r\n          Preliminary reports. Medical records. Personality\r\n          profiles...\r\n                         \r\n          She opens the door to Lucy's room.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Freezes in the doorway, shocked by what lies before her.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Oh my God...\r\n           95.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Black eyes. Bloody noses. Bruises. Cuts. Burns. PHOTOS\r\n          OF ABUSED CHILDREN COVER THE ENTIRE FLOOR. A collage of\r\n          misery.\r\n                         \r\n          Lucy is nowhere to be seen. Emily comes in and starts\r\n          quickly picking them up.\r\n                         \r\n          Tucked between the file cabinet and the wall is a CORKBOARD.\r\n          Emily pulls it out. It's covered with PHOTOS FROM WORK.\r\n          COWORKERS. HER KIDS. Two of the photos are turned around.\r\n          She flips them over in rapid succession. Diego. Doug.\r\n                         \r\n          She rips all the photos from the board.\r\n                         \r\n          Photos bunched in her hands, she heads for the door, but\r\n          hears something that stops her in her tracks -\r\n                         \r\n          A strange INTERMITTENT BUZZING NOISE\r\n                         \r\n          It lasts two seconds and stops. She turns around, scans the\r\n          room. Puts down the stack of photos. There it is again:\r\n                         \r\n          BZZZZZZZZZZZT. BZZZZZZZZZZZZT.\r\n                         \r\n          Sounds like a housefly trapped against a window, but it's\r\n          bigger, angrier, and appears to be coming from the\r\n                         \r\n                         KNOTTED RUG\r\n                         \r\n          at the foot of Lucy's bed. Emily crosses to it. The BUZZING\r\n          STOPS. She bends. Takes hold of a corner. Peels it slowly\r\n          back to reveal\r\n                         \r\n                         BARE FLOOR\r\n                         \r\n          Weird. Nothing there.\r\n                         \r\n          BZZZZZZZZZZZZZT! BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZT!\r\n                         \r\n          Emily straightens, turns. It's coming from the\r\n                         \r\n                         BED\r\n                         \r\n          As she approaches it the BUZZING INTENSIFIES, louder, more\r\n          agitated.\r\n                         \r\n          Pauses as she gets there, terrified of what she might find,\r\n          the bed BUZZING FURIOUSLY FROM WITHIN. Something is trapped\r\n          under those blankets, waiting for release.\r\n                         \r\n          Emily extends a trembling hand, takes hold of the blankets\r\n          and, slowly, rigid with fear, peels them back to reveal\r\n           96.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                         BARE MATTRESS\r\n                         \r\n          Impossible, because the BUZZING IS LOUDER THAN EVER.\r\n                         \r\n          With a tense swallow Emily realizes it's coming from lower,\r\n          deeper within the bed, between the mattress and the box\r\n          spring.\r\n                         \r\n          She slips her fingers into the crack.\r\n                         \r\n          And slowly lifts the mattress, the BUZZING GROWING\r\n          FRIGHTENINGLY LOUD as its source is exposed, something\r\n          hellish waiting for her as she cranes her neck and look to\r\n          see what lies below -\r\n                         \r\n          HER CELL PHONE\r\n                         \r\n          Vibrating. BZZZZZZZZZT. BZZZZZZZZZZT. On the viewscreen:\r\n          \"INCOMING CALL...\"\r\n                         \r\n          She picks it up. Stares at it vibrating in her hand.\r\n          Presses the TALK button. Brings it to her ear.\r\n                         \r\n          The LOW STATIC of an open line. Then, a RASPY MALE VOICE:\r\n                         \r\n           MALE VOICE ON PHONE\r\n           Emily...\r\n                         \r\n          Emily flinches.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Who is this...?\r\n                         \r\n           MALE VOICE ON PHONE\r\n           It's Wayne, Emily, I just got a call,\r\n           Mike's dead...\r\n                         \r\n          Emily, stunned, barely able to speak.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           No... he's...\r\n                         \r\n           WAYNE (V.O.)\r\n           They don't know if he fell or what\r\n           happened...\r\n                         \r\n          Emily's phone hand drops to her side in shock. From down\r\n          there, we hear Wayne's voice:\r\n                         \r\n           WAYNE (V.O.)\r\n           Emily? Emily, are you okay...?\r\n                         \r\n          After a moment, she lifts it.\r\n           97.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           I have to go.\r\n                         \r\n          Hangs up. On the brink of emotional collapse. Her only\r\n          confidante dead.\r\n                         \r\n          Just then she hears BREATHING from behind the open door.\r\n          Someone or something hiding in that dark corner over there.\r\n          She crosses to it. Pulls back the door and there sits\r\n                         \r\n                         LUCY\r\n                         \r\n          quiet, innocent, chin on her knees.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           What did you do to him?\r\n                         \r\n          Lucy says nothing. Emily grabs her by the arm. Yanks her to\r\n          her feet.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?!\r\n                         \r\n          After a moment:\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCY\r\n           He did it to himself.\r\n                         \r\n          WHACK! Emily slaps her. Hard across the face. Knocks her\r\n          to the floor. Lucy sits up, lip split. Tastes the blood\r\n          with her tongue. Hint of a smile. The taste of victory.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCY\r\n           Europa. Ganymede. Io. Callisto. The\r\n           moons of Jupiter. We got back our\r\n           astronomy tests today.\r\n                         \r\n          It's there on the floor. A++ Well done, Lucy!\r\n                         \r\n          There's a LOUD BEEP in the other room. Lucy gets up and\r\n          walks out. Emily watches as Lucy goes into the kitchen.\r\n          Takes a bag of popcorn from the microwave. Empties it into a\r\n          bowl. Sits down on the living room sofa and clicks on the tv\r\n          remote, watching it like nothing ever happened. Emily walks\r\n          over and pitches the tv onto the floor. The SCREEN SHATTERS.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Get out of my house.\r\n                         \r\n          Lucy, unimpressed, expressionless, takes another handful of\r\n          popcorn. Chews it. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. CRUNCH. Emily swats\r\n          the bowl from her hands.\r\n           98.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           GET OUT!\r\n                         \r\n          Flicking bits of popcorn off herself, Lucy stands up from the\r\n          sofa. Her face catches the light from the hallway. Emily\r\n          shudders at the sight.\r\n                         \r\n          Lucy's features look altered somehow, sharpened. It's\r\n          subtle, but the overall effect is chilling. THE FACE OF A\r\n          LITTLE GIRL LAID OVER THE MUSCULATURE OF SOMETHING MORE\r\n          DEVIOUS AND WICKED.\r\n                         \r\n                          LUCY\r\n           Don't yell at me. My mom and dad used to\r\n           yell at me.\r\n                         \r\n          Emily backs away, mortified, takes off down the hall.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. EMILY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Rushes in. Slams the door. Bolts the deadbolts. CLUNK.\r\n          CLUNK. CLUNK. Moment of panic. Will they hold?\r\n                         \r\n          Slides her bureau in front of the door. Shoves her bed in\r\n          front of the bureau just to be sure.\r\n                         \r\n          In the silence we hear LUCY'S FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall\r\n          toward the door.\r\n                         \r\n          Closer, closer...\r\n                         \r\n          There's nothing else to block the door with. Emily backs\r\n          away, trembling as\r\n                         \r\n          LUCY'S FOOTSTEPS arrive at the door. A tense silence. Then:\r\n                         \r\n           LUCY (O.S.)\r\n           Emily... I'm sorry... I didn't mean to...\r\n                         \r\n          Emily grabs the screwdriver, clutches it in both hands.\r\n                         \r\n           LUCY (O.S.)\r\n           Can I come in so we can talk and work it\r\n           out?\r\n                         \r\n          There's a GENTLE KNOCK on the door. Emily flinches,\r\n          remembering last time.\r\n                         \r\n           LUCY (O.S.)\r\n           Emily...?\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           Stay away from me!\r\n           99.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           LUCY (O.S.)\r\n           Don't be mad. I said I was sorry. I'll\r\n           brush your hair for you.\r\n                         \r\n                          EMILY\r\n           STAY AWAY FROM ME!!\r\n                         \r\n          Silence.\r\n                         \r\n                         THEN:\r\n                         \r\n          WHAM! The door shudders from a MAMMOTH IMPACT. Last time,\r\n          it shook the door, this time it shakes the entire wall.\r\n          Emily recoils, dropping the screwdriver.\r\n                         \r\n          WHAM! CRACKS APPEAR in the door as it bows from the\r\n          tremendous force.\r\n                         \r\n          WHAM!! CRACKS FAN OUT into the plaster around the doorframe.\r\n                         \r\n          WHAM!! Half the SCREWS HOLDING THE HINGES fly from the wall.\r\n                         \r\n          WHAM!! The DEADBOLTS BENDING from the ungodly pummeling.\r\n                         \r\n          WHAM!! The DEADBOLT SCREWS getting yanked from the wood.\r\n                         \r\n          Emily frozen in terror, watching. Whatever's out there is\r\n          coming in.\r\n                         \r\n          WHAM!! One of the DOOR HINGES rips clean from the wall.\r\n                         \r\n          WHAM!! The FIRST DEADBOLT comes flying off.\r\n                         \r\n          WHAM!! The SECOND DOOR HINGE gone.\r\n                         \r\n          WHAM!! ANOTHER DEADBOLT flies off.\r\n                         \r\n          WHAM!! The DOOR SPLITS down the center.\r\n                         \r\n          WHAM!! The THIRD DEADBOLT lands on the floor at Emily's feet\r\n          with a METAL THUD.\r\n                         \r\n          A breathless silence.\r\n                         \r\n          Then the DOOR RATTLES and drops loose from the frame with a\r\n          DEAD WOODEN CLUNK.\r\n                         \r\n          Nothing holding it in place now except the bureau and the\r\n          bed. And now they both start to SLIDE BACKWARDS as whatever\r\n          is on the other side starts pushing its way in.\r\n           100.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Emily topples a high bookcase against the door and pushes\r\n          back with every ounce of strength she can muster, but it's no\r\n          use. The bureau overturns, CRASHES to the floor. Emily's\r\n          bare feet slide backwards along with the bed.\r\n                         \r\n          And then they stop. The barricade sufficiently breached.\r\n                         \r\n          Emily, in her panic, makes a hasty decision. She hides under\r\n          the bed.\r\n                         \r\n          We HOLD LOW on the open door as LUCY'S FEET step into the\r\n          room, the feet of a child, but the BREATHING we hear sounds\r\n          emphysemic and the VOICE is unquestionably male - harsh,\r\n          guttural, taunting Emily as it comes for her:\r\n                         \r\n           SINISTER MALE VOICE\r\n           Emily...\r\n                         \r\n          Wide-eyed with terror under the bed, she watches those feet\r\n          pick their way over the shattered remnants of the barricade.\r\n                         \r\n           SINISTER MALE VOICE\r\n           Emily...

Dumps SIX\r\n          SLEEPING PILLS from the prescription bottle. Crushes them\r\n          with the blunt edge of a knife.

Emily suspects that the parents have been mistreating Lillith. Emily's fears are confirmed when Lillith's parents try to kill her by gassing her in the oven at home. Emily saves Lillith with the help of Detective Mike Barron (Ian McShane). Lillith is originally sent to a children's home, but she begs Emily to look after her instead. With the agreement of the board, Emily is assigned to take care of Lillith until a suitable foster family comes along. In the meantime, Lillith's parents, Edward and Margaret (Callum Keith Rennie and Kerry O'Malley) are placed in a mental institution.\nNot too long after Lillith moves in, strange things begin to happen around Emily. Two weeks later, another of Emily's cases, a boy named Diego (Alexander Conti), suddenly murders his parents, and Barron informs Emily that somebody phoned Diego from her house the night before the crime. As she is suspected of involvement in the incident, Lillith undergoes a psychiatric evaluation by Emily's best friend, Douglas J. Ames (Bradley Cooper). During the session, however, Lillith turns the evaluation around, asking Douglas what his fears are and subtly threatening him. That night after receiving a strange phone call, Douglas is panicked by a mass of hornets coming out of his body in hysteria and kills himself in his bathroom.\nEmily gradually becomes fearful of Lillith, so she heads to the mental asylum for answers from Lillith's parents. They tell her that, far from being truly human, Lillith is actually a demon (like Lilith the Succubus) who feeds on emotion, and that they had tried to kill her in an attempt to save themselves. Lillith's father tells Emily that the only way to kill Lillith is to get her to sleep. Shortly after Emily leaves the asylum, Lillith's mother hallucinates being on fire, and her father is stabbed in the eye after attacking a fellow inmate through whom the voice of Lillith spoke. Barron initially thinks Emily should seek psychiatric help, but is later convinced when he receives a strange phone call in his home from Lillith. He arms himself to help Emily. However, he inadvertently shoots himself in the head with a shotgun, killing himself as a result, when Lilith makes him imagine he is being attacked by dogs.\nAfter realizing that her closest colleagues have been eliminated, and that the rest of her cases will be next, Emily serves Lillith tea spiked with sedative. While Lillith is asleep, Emily sets fire to her house, hoping to get rid of her. However, the girl apparently escapes unharmed (from this point on, the audience may wonder whether Lilith is really present or Emily is hallucinating her presence). A police officer escorts Emily and Lillith to a temporary place to sleep. As Emily is following the police cars, she suddenly takes a different route and drives her car at a high speed, hoping to bring fear to Lillith. Instead, Lillith forces Emily to relive her childhood memory of her mother driving fast in a rainstorm. Emily fights through the memory, telling herself that it is not real. The image fades, and Lillith appears scared by the fact that Emily was able to fight through her illusion.\nEmily drives the car off a pier. As the car sinks, Emily struggles to lock Lillith (now in her demonic true form) in the trunk. Emily then attempts to swim to the surface. However, the demon grabs Emily's foot to stop her swim away. Emily struggles and eventually breaks free as a trapped Lillith sinks to the bottom. Emily climbs atop the pier and tries to recover from the ordeal."}

Anywhere else in \n          the country, I was a bookie, a \n          gambler, always lookin' over my \n          shoulder, hassled by cops, day and \n          night. But here, I'm 'Mr Sam \n          Rothstein'. I'm not only legitimate, \n          but running a casino. And that's \n          like selling dreams for cash.\n\nINT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT\n\nWe see ACE enter alone. He is greeted by BILLY SHERBERT. \nThey are joined by top executives RICHIE and RONNIE in suits \nand ties. They walk through the casino, past crowded and \nnoisy craps tables, spinning roulette wheels, blackjack \ntables, poker-faced players at poker tables, and elegant, \ncordoned-off, black-tie, baccarat tables.\n\n                      ACE (V.O.)\n          I hired an old casino pal, Billy \n          Sherbert, as my manager and I went \n          to work.\n\n                      SHERBERT\n               (Introducing the EXECS \n               to ACE)\n          ...And this is Ronnie, who takes \n          care of the card room...\n\n                      ACE (V.O.)\n          For guys like me, Las Vegas washes \n          away your sins.

TANGIERS/HARD COUNT ROOM - NIGHT\n\nDolly back from a wall of money. An employee pours a bucket \nfull of coins into a trough. Camera follows progress as \nnumerous coins move on a conveyor system, through a sorting \nmachine. Camera reveals several rolls of coins on a lower \nconveyor as they move up a ladder towards an employee's hands, \nwho then places the rolls on a rack.\n\n                      ACE (V.O.)\n          ...comes cash. Tons of it. I mean, \n          what do you think we're doing out \n          here in the middle of the desert?  \n          It's all this money. This is the end \n          result of all the bright lights and \n          the comped trips, of all the champagne \n          and free hotel suites, and all the \n          broads and all the booze.

TANGIERS/FLOOR/SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY\n\nCamera follows JOHN NANCE carrying a small suitcase and \nwalking through the casino to a door leading to the cashier's \ncage. The sign on the door reads 'Authorized Personnel Only'. \nHe walks through the cage, to another door: 'Notice - Keep \nOut'.\n\n                      ACE (V.O.)\n          We're the only winners. The players \n          don't stand a chance. And their cash \n          flows from the tables to our boxes \n          ...through the cage and into the \n          most sacred room in the casino ...the \n          place where they add up all the money \n          ...the holy of holies ...the count \n          room.\n\nHe opens the door. We see inside the count room from NANCE'S \npoint of view.\n\nIt looks like the area behind a teller's cage in a bank. A \nlarge room, windowless, decor-free. One side is a mesh cage, \nopened to reveal stacks of cash boxes. Several COUNTERS in \nwhite shirts are gathered around a glass table counting and \nsorting paper money.)\n\n                      ACE (V.O.)\n          Now this place was off limits.\n\n                      COUNTER #1\n          Verify two thousand.\n\n                      ACE (V.O.)\n          Even I couldn't get inside, but it \n          was my job to keep it filled with \n          cash. That's for sure.\n\n                      NICKY (V.O.)\n          They had so much fuckin' money in \n          there, you could build a house out \n          of stacks of $100 bills. And the \n          best part was that upstairs, the \n          board of directors didn't know what \n          the fuck was going on.\n\nAt one end of the room the clerks empty the metal boxes and \nrapidly count the cash at a counting table. The camera follows \na cash 'drop box' being lifted from the stack by a clerk. He \npours the cash on to the table and shows the empty box to a \nvideo camera. COUNTER #2 rapidly counts the cash and \nannounces:\n\n                      COUNTER #2\n          Five thousand.\n\n                      NICKY (V.O.)\n          I mean, to them everything looked on \n          the up and up. Right? Wrong.\n\nThe first counter recounts the cash.\n\n                      COUNTER #1\n          Verify five thousand.\n\n                      NICKY (V.O.)\n          The guys inside the counting room...\n\nStacks of bills lie nearby. The camera pans across the room \nto another table manned by a COUNT ROOM EXECUTIVE who repeats \nthe figure and writes it down on a master list.\n\n                      COUNT ROOM EXEC\n          Five thousand.\n\nWe move back to NANCE opening a cabinet full of stacks of \n$100 bills. He opens his suitcase and begins to fill it with \ncash. As he does this, the workers studiously look in other \ndirections.\n\n                      NICKY (V.O.)\n          ...were all slipped in there to skim \n          the joint dry.  They'd do short \n          counts, they'd lose fill slips. They'd \n          even take cash right out of the drop \n          boxes. And it was up to this guy \n          right here [NANCE], standin' in front \n          of about two million dollars, to \n          skim the cash off the top without \n          anybody gettin' wise ...the IRS or \n          anybody.\n\n                      COUNTER #1\n          Verify two hundred.\n\nNANCE closes the case and walks out. One of the counters \ndumps another container of money on the table.\n\n                      NICKY (V.O.)\n          Now, notice how in the count room \n          nobody ever seems to see anything. \n          Somehow, somebody's always lookin' \n          the other way. Now, look at these \n          guys [COUNTERS]. They look busy, \n          right?  They're countin' money. Who \n          wants to bother them? I mean, God \n          forbid they should make a mistake \n          and forget to steal. Meanwhile, you're \n          in and you're out.\n\nNANCE exits the count room and proceeds through the lobby of \nthe casino, passing ACE and SHERBERT, to a side exit door.\n\n                      NICKY\n          Past the jag-off guard who gets an \n          extra c-note a week just to watch \n          the door.  I mean, it's routine. \n          Business as usual: in, out, hello, \n          goodbye. And that's all there is to \n          it. Just another fat fuck walkin' \n          out of the casino with a suitcase. \n          Now, that suitcase was goin' straight \n          to one place: right to Kansas City \n          ...which was as close to Las Vegas \n          as the Midwest bosses could go without \n          gettin' themselves arrested.\n\nNANCE leaves the casino and gets into a cab parked at the \ncurb.\n\nEXT.

Bond is about to attain double-0 status for tracking Dryden. Dryden knows Bond must kill him to confirm this status, and is curious. Bond recounts his first kill \u2013 Dryden's accomplice \u2013 shown in flashbacks. Before Dryden can finish assuring Bond that killing gets easier, Bond shoots him and dryly agrees. The prologue concludes in a flashback to Bond drawing his gun and firing it at Dryden's accomplice.\n\nIn Uganda, Mr. White, a British national with a mysterious affiliation, introduces a Ugandan \"freedom fighter\" to French financier of terrorism Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen). The warlord entrusts Le Chiffre with cash for illegal investment. Following the meeting, Le Chiffre uses the money to short sell stock in Skyfleet, a promising aerospace company, thus betting the warlord's money on the company's failure.\nIn Madagascar, Bond pursues professional bomb maker Mollaka. Mollaka incites an elaborate parkour chase concluding at an African embassy. In the compound, Bond kills an unarmed Mollaka before escaping amidst large explosions. Bond's reckless assassination of Mollaka is broadcast by a French Internet news site, catching the attention of Le Chiffre. In London, MI6 chief M (Judi Dench) admonishes Bond for his brazen lack of forethought, subtlety, or refinement. Though supportive, M questions Bond's promotion and sternly advises him to rethink his future as an agent.\nClues from Mollaka point to corrupt Greek official Alex Dimitrios. Bond finds Dimitrios in the Bahamas and pursues him to Miami. Bond kills Dimitrios and follows his henchman to the airport. Bond foils Le Chiffre's scheme by thwarting the destruction of Skyfleet's airliner. To recoup his client's lost money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes Texas hold 'em tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to aid the British government in exchange for protection from his criminal creditors. On the train to Montenegro, Bond meets Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), a British Treasury agent there to protect the government's $10 million buy-in.\nOnce in Montenegro, Bond and Vesper meet their MI6 contact, Ren\u00e9 Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini). Mathis entertains and proves useful, eliminating and publicly humiliating Le Chiffre's support in Montenegro. That night, the tournament commences. An increasingly nervous Le Chiffre eyes Bond suspiciously, aware that someone is on to him. Bond further antagonises and alienates Le Chiffre, quipping arrogantly and charming the other players. Vesper agrees to help by dressing seductively, making a distracting entrance, and lavishing copious affection on Bond during the game.\nAt the tournament's break, Bond is confident, believing he's deduced Le Chiffre's \"tells\". In Le Chiffre's suite, the Ugandan warlord ambushes him, furious over the loss of his money. Bond overhears, and in an ensuing struggle, Bond kills the Ugandan with his bare hands. Vesper is traumatised, and Bond comforts her. When the tournament resumes, an overconfident Bond loses his initial stake. Vesper refuses to fund further playing. Frustrated, Bond attempts to assassinate Le Chiffre when he runs into Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright), a fellow player and CIA agent. Leiter stakes Bond in exchange for custody of Le Chiffre.\nBack in the game, Bond rapidly rebuilds his position. Le Chiffre poisons Bond's martini. Bond escapes to his car and uses its defibrillator to combat the poison with Vesper's help. The tournament culminates in a $115-million hand. Le Chiffre trumps the other players, but Bond's hand is even better and he wins the game. He claims the winnings for a Swiss bank account prepared by MI6, entrusting the money to Vesper.\nLe Chiffre's henchmen capture Vesper and Bond. Le Chiffre tortures Bond for the account password, but is interrupted and killed by Mr. White. Bond awakens in a hospital on Lake Como, tells Vesper he is in love with her, and posts his resignation to M.\nBond and Vesper travel to Venice, where Bond learns that Vesper has stolen the winnings. He pursues her and the men to whom she gives the money into a building under renovation. In the ensuing struggle, the building is damaged and begins sinking in the Grand Canal. Bond kills the men and tries to rescue Vesper, but she intentionally drowns as the building sinks. Mr. White, watching from nearby, walks away with the money. Bond agonises over Vesper's corpse.\nLater, Bond phones M and rejoins MI6. M debriefs Bond as he stoically peruses for clues. She informs him Vesper was being blackmailed by Quantum, the organisation behind Le Chiffre. Vesper had a deal to spare Bond's life in exchange for her own, plus the winnings. M commends Bond on his growth as an agent, and offers condolences. She laments that Vesper's death left no leads and the true villain(s) remain unknown. After the phone call with M, Bond discovers a text message left for him by Vesper: Mr. White's name and phone number.\nMr. White arrives alone at an isolated estate on Lake Como, and his phone rings. When he inquires who is calling, he is crippled by gunshot. White crawls in agony toward the house, where Bond casually strolls into his path. Bond stands over the cowering Mr. White and informs him, \"The name's Bond... James Bond\"."}

TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT\n\nSTART ON THE FACE of A GOLDEN CAT STATUE. This is the cat-\ngod BAST, lithe, noble, beautiful. CAMERA MOVES to reveal\nthe statue is 50 feet tall, dominating this space. Other\nimages of CATS -- hieroglyphics, ceramics -- abound, as do --\nREAL CATS, hundreds of them, slinking in the shadows on ramps\ncut into the sandstone walls of this Egyptian temple.\nAt Bast's feet, EIGHT ACOLYTES in GOWNS kneel in a semi-\ncircle around a flaming BRAZIER. Some of the women WEEP,\nothers PRAY or stare stoically ahead. From outside, we now\nhear DISTANT SCREAMS, the sounds of MARAUDERS. There's a\nRHYTHMIC BANGING at the massive BRONZE TEMPLE DOORS.\n\n\n\n\nEXT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT\n\nTHE TEMPLE is an impressive place of worship -- tapered\ncolumns and an ornate Egyptian facade -- at the apex of a\nhilltop VILLAGE, in FLAMES, under ATTACK by a PERSIAN ARMY.\n\nSUPERIMPOSE:   \"496 B.C.\"\n\nWHAM! THE STEEL PRONG of a mounted BATTERING RAM swings into\nthe ornate DOORS of the temple. PERSIAN SOLDIERS operate the\nbrutal siege engine, SLAM the doors again and again.\n\n\n\n\nINT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT\n\nThe HIGH PRIESTESS wears a special HOODED WHITE GOWN that\nmostly conceals her face. She moves from one ACOLYTE to the\nnext, pours a DARK LIQUID from a bejeweled decanter into\ngolden goblets, then pours one for herself. She raises her\ngoblet toward BAST, as do the others -- they drink in unison.\n\n\n\nHIGH ANGLE as the GOBLETS CLATTER to the floor and the WOMEN\nSLUMP to the ground... dead. PULL BACK -- we're watching\nthis from the PERSPECTIVE of an EGYPTIAN MAU CAT -- slim,\nelegant, dark-spotted gray and black fur, a SCARAB MARK on\nits head.\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nTHE MAU lets out a CRY... which prompts an eerie, growing\nCHORUS of MEOWS and HOWLS from the other CATS.\nTHE CATS emerge from the hiding places en masse, leaping from\nniches, converging on the bodies. The MAU leads the way,\nmoves to the high priestess and puts its mouth to hers...\nON THE TEMPLE DOORS - at last they BUCKLE and swing open.\nTHE SOLDIERS, bearing TORCHES and SWORDS, storm inside. They\ngrab anything of value, SMASH and DEFACE everything else.\nAt the foot of BAST lie nine ROBES... but there's no sign of\nthe women who wore them. SOLDIERS slash the robes with their\nswords anyway, then snatch up the goblets for booty.\nAn unearthly CRY -- half-human, half-feline -- from somewhere\nhigh above the rampaging soldiers. They freeze, looking\naround frantically. More EERIE CRIES echo off the walls,\nfrom all directions. The SOLDIERS raise their weapons,\nclustering defensively. From out of the shadows above them,\nDARK HUMAN FORMS suddenly leap down with impossible agility.\nSTAY ON THE FACE OF BAST, peering down impassively. The\ntorch-cast SHADOWS of the violence below play upon the\nstatue's golden surface... FLAILING SWORDS, the swift\nSILHOUETTES of NAKED WOMEN. We hear the GUTTURAL CRIES of\nthe soldiers, clearly outmatched in this mortal combat.\nMOVE TO THE CATS, perched above the fray, looking downward as\nthey pace the temple's ledges and ramps excitedly. THE MAU\ntakes a final look at its handiwork, then leaps up, slinks\nthrough a crevice at the roof, and emerges on --\n\n                                                           CUT TO:\n\n\n\n\n\nA ROOFTOP\n\n\n\n\nWe hear the modern SOUNDS of passing AUTO TRAFFIC.    CAMERA\nROTATES to reveal --\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXT. EDNA'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY\n\nTHE MAU settles by a SATELLITE DISH, looking down on a\npresent-day suburban street, a busy main drag. MARSHLAND and\nWATER are visible not far away, light RAIN FALLS.\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                       3.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\nSUPERIMPOSE:        \"2500 YEARS LATER.\"\n\nThe MAU watches as, ACROSS THE STREET, a BUS pulls away from\nthe curb to reveal a WOMAN in a HOODED WHITE PONCHO\n-- the outfit recalls the high priestess of Bast.\nThe HOOD is thrown back, revealing PATIENCE PRICE, 25-35,\nattractive but inclined to conceal her looks -- hair over her\nface, baggy clothes under her poncho. She's cautious, eager\nto please, to do what's expected of her\n-- a bit of a doormat.\nPatience looks up from an address scribbled on a scrap of\npaper, and straight toward the cat on the roof -- almost as\nif she'd sensed its presence. She smiles.\nTHE MAU holds her gaze for a beat, then slinks out of sight.\n\n\n\n\nEXT. EDNA'S HOME - DAY\n\nAn eccentric, ramshackle home amongst neat, well-kept houses.\nPATIENCE moves to the front door, RINGS. As she waits, she\nnotes the lawn GRASS grown high, CLIMBING CAT SCULPTURES on\nthe shingles. A SIGN by the door: \"FELINE RESCUE SOCIETY.\"\nEDNA POWERS opens the door on a chain. She's 50-70, a former\nacademic, intelligent, charming, but quite intimidating.\n\n                              EDNA\n\n             Yes?\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             Hi, Edna Powers?\n                     (off her nod)\n             I'm Patience Price, I called about adopting a cat?\n             I saw your flyer at my vet's office --\n\n\n\n\n                           EDNA\n\n             Oh yes, do come inside.\nEDNA undoes the chain, opens the door for her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINT. EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\nPATIENCE, out of her poncho, fills out a questionnaire on a\nclipboard. Numerous CATS roam the premises. Feline artwork\nand curios, scratching posts, furry toys... cat paradise.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                        4.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             ... Ma'am?\nEDNA is putting out DRY CAT FOOD in numerous BOWLS.\n\n                           EDNA\n\n             You may call me Edna.\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             Edna. Some of these questions are... kind of\n             personal. Do you really need to know how many, um,\n             partners I've had in the past year?\n\n                           EDNA\n\n             I'm not interested in your love life. But I do\n             want to know what sort of home environment you're\n             offering, your degree of commitment...\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             Guess I wouldn't need the cat if...\nPatience forces a laugh, fills in a ZERO and passes the\nclipboard to EDNA. The woman puts down the cat food, slips\non the reading glasses she wears on a chain around her neck.\n\n                           EDNA\n\n             The application is mostly a formality.   I have a\n             sense about people.\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             Well, I've always liked animals.\n                     (not enough)\n             Cats specifically. I mean, I love them... worship\n             them, even.\nEDNA seems satisfied, returns to reading Patience's answers.\nTHE MAU, meanwhile, comes around a corner into the room,\npeering curiously at Patience -- who dangles her hand\ninvitingly. He rubs his face against her hand.\nPATIENCE smiles, coos at the cat -- which grabs her hand hard\nin his CLAWS. PATIENCE stifles a yelp, yanks her hand back.\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                         5.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n\n                             PATIENCE\n\n             Son of a --\n\n                             EDNA\n\n             Excuse me?\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             Nothing... handsome cat.   I've never seen one like\n             him.\nTHE MAU jumps into Patience's lap, settling in.      Edna,\nsurprised and almost suspicious, eyes the cat.\n\n                           EDNA\n\n             Her. That's Midnight, an Egyptian Mau.     Normally\n             she doesn't trust people --\nEDNA reaches a hand toward MIDNIGHT -- the cat's fur stands\nup, she HISSES and SWIPES at Edna.\n\n                             EDNA\n\n             See?    Even I can't get near her... Very strange.\n                       (glancing at the\n                        application)\n             So.    You left out your parents' address.\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             Well... they're both dead.\n\n                           EDNA\n\n             No hereditary illnesses, I hope.\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             Private plane crash. I was eleven. Actually, the\n             last thing they gave me was a kitten... Fatso.\nEDNA sucks her breath in at this insulting name.\n\n\n\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             He was very round -- not from overfeeding or\n             anything, just -- really, he didn't mind. Anyway,\n             he was with me a long time, till early this year.\n             He didn't come at the sound of the can-opener,\n             which kind of freaked me out... I found him just,\n             curled up there in his little bed...\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                         6.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nPATIENCE is getting a bit emotional. EDNA reaches across and\nsqueezes her hand, with genuine sympathy. MIDNIGHT snuggles\ninto Patience's lap, PURRING as she strokes the cat.\n\n                           EDNA\n\n             It's very hard, dear, I know... you must be in so\n             much pain.\nMidnight digs her long NAILS into Patience's thigh, kneading.\nPATIENCE winces, tries to dislodge cat's claws from her leg\n-- Midnight \"playfully\" attacks her hand. Stifling a gasp:\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             Mm-hmm.\n\n                           EDNA\n\n             Funny how cats get under our skin. They do exactly\n             as they please, they don't care what anyone thinks\n             about them... they're the ultimate predators. So\n             self-contained, so independent, so wild...\n             sometimes I wonder, why do they even put up with\n             us?\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             The free food?\n\n                           EDNA\n\n                     (putting the papers\n                      aside)\n             Well, congratulations. It seems you've been\n             chosen.\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             So you think you might have a kitten for me...?\n\n                           EDNA\n\n             Kitten? No, that wouldn't be appropriate.\n             Midnight has chosen you.\n\n\n\nPATIENCE looks a little unnerved at this. MIDNIGHT, rolling\non her back, seems to be baring her fangs at Patience.\n\n                           EDNA\n\n             It's a great honor. Maus are a very rare breed,\n             descended from the sacred cats of ancient Egypt.\n             They were believed to have magical gifts.\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                        7.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nMIDNIGHT has wrapped herself around Patience's arm, kicking\nand biting \"playfully.\"\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             I'm not sure she likes me --\n\n                           EDNA\n\n             Nonsense, she perceives something very special in\n             you.\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             There's nothing special about me.\n\n                           EDNA\n\n             Cats see things we don't.   Our secret selves -- our\n             souls.\n\n                            PATIENCE\n\n             Mm.   Do you have any Band-Aids?\n\n                                                             CUT TO:\n\n\n\n\n\nINT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\nCAMERA MOVES THROUGH this modest, neat studio apartment, PAST\na BULLETIN BOARD with numerous PHOTOS. One or two show a\nYOUNG PATIENCE, there's a picture of a LITTLE GIRL between\nTWO SMILING PARENTS on a ROLLER COASTER. Mostly, though,\nthey're snapshots of a chubby TABBY CAT, from kitten hood to\nold age. Suddenly, MIDNIGHT LUNGES INTO FRAME, attacking a\npicture of FATSO, ripping it from the bulletin board.\nKEEP MOVING PAST WINDOWS facing on the street and an adjacent\nBUILDING across an alley -- it's a corner apartment on the\nsecond floor. CAMERA HOLDS ON A TV, where a classic OLD\nMOVIE like Now, Voyager plays. At a key, romantic moment,\n\nCUT TO COMMERCIAL --\n\n\n\n\nLAUREL AVENAL strides TOWARD CAMERA -- statuesque, perfect, a\nsupermodel. We hear the VOICE of GEORGES AVENAL:\n\n                           GEORGES (V.O.)\n\n             You know who you are.

She\nmoves past the male model to --\n-- GEORGES AVENAL. He's Laurel's husband and the company\nC.E.O., handsome and charismatic. LAUREL falls into his\narms. He caresses her, deeply in love. Georges WINKS.\n\n                           GEORGES\n\n             ... almost.\nCUT TO a PRODUCT SHOT of a JAR OF CREAM, the name \"BEAUNIQUE\"\nand the AVENAL LOGO.\n\n                           GEORGES (V.O.)\n\n             Beaunique by Avenal. You know you want it.\nCLOSE ON LAUREL as she tosses her hair back, Gilda-style,\nwith a seductive pout. She purses her lips in a kiss.\nREVERSE ANGLE -- PATIENCE watches with a curled lip, on the\ncouch in a T-shirt and shorts, EATING CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM\ndirectly from a pint carton, a dark smear around her mouth.\nSuddenly, MIDNIGHT POUNCES at the SPOON OF ICE CREAM.\nPatience jerks back, startled, raises the spoon out of reach.\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             No -- this is mine!\nMIDNIGHT doesn't back off, jumping repeatedly at the spoon,\nclimbing over Patience, getting a rear PAW in the open pint.\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             Oh, gross, you -- just take it.\nPatience offers the cat the half-empty pint. As MIDNIGHT\ndigs in happily, burying his head in the container --\n\n\n\nLIGHTS COME ON in the apartment across the way.\nPATIENCE hesitates only an instant, sticks the spoon in her\nmouth, CLICKS OFF the TV and flips off a LAMP by the sofa.\nTHROUGH THE WINDOW, A HANDSOME MAN -- his name is TOM LONE --\ncrosses past.\nPATIENCE sighs in the dark, moving for a better view.      This\nvoyeurism is a guilty habit.\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                       9.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nLONE checks his mail, loosens his tie, unbuttons his shirt.\n\n                           PATIENCE\n\n             Welcome home, sweetie.

SUBURBAN STREETS - NIGHT\n\nEDNA'S CATS scramble through alleyways, joined by STRAYS\nconverging from all directions, picking up the CHORUS. It's\nlike a flowing RIVER OF CATS.\n\n\n\n\nEXT. MARSHLAND - NIGHT\n\nON MURKY MOONLIT WATER -- CAMERA MOVES past floating TRASH, a\nCAR TIRE, BOTTLES and CANS. We hear the CRIES of the CATS\nfrom nearby, approaching. LIGHTS of the CITY further away,\nthe BRIDGE visible.\nCAMERA FINDS a nylon-encased FOOT... PAN OVER a woman's\nCORPSE, her clothes TORN, SOAKED and MUDDY, strewn with RIVER\nWEEDS. The body bobs amidst REEDS by this soggy shoreline.\nWe reach the woman's FACE -- unnaturally pale, eyes fixed...\nit's PATIENCE PRICE. Dead.\nTHE HOWLING is CLOSE now... THE CATS have gathered here,\nparting for MIDNIGHT, a feline VIP. The Mau steps\ntentatively out onto Patience's corpse, careful not to get\ntoo wet. She crouches on her chest, and --\nCLOSE, BREATHES audibly into her parted lips. A brief,\nbarely visible GLOW flickers at Patience's mouth.\nTHE CAT shudders, then moves aside, BLINKS as if drugged.\nANOTHER CAT climbs out onto Patience to take Midnight's place\nand perform the same ritual.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                      29.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTINUED:\n\nHIGH ANGLE.

MARSHLAND - NIGHT (PRESENT)\n\n-- PATIENCE sits up INTO FRAME with a SCREAM.\nShe thrashes in the shallows of the marsh, gasping for air,\ndisoriented... reborn. There's no sign of the cats.\nPATIENCE crawls onto shore amidst the reeds, slightly clumsy\nat first, almost like a newborn kitten. Her ragged, wet\nclothes cling to her body.\nTIGHT on her terrified expression. She has no idea what\nshe's doing here -- or who, or what she is. She opens her\nmouth to speak -- all that comes out is a strangled CAT CRY.\nShe works her jaw, but can't produce human speech. She darts\nher head, seems disoriented and overwhelmed.\nHER POV -- SOUNDS AMPLIFIED, IMAGE perhaps SOLARIZED, the\ndarkness BRIGHTENED, objects of interest HIGHLIGHTED as she\ntakes in the marshland. The EYES of any creature in sight\nGLOW.

THE OWL swoops\nwith   a SCREECH, nailing the MOUSE, we hear its SQUEAL.\nPATIENCE, frightened at first, becomes increasingly delighted\nby her heightened senses. She spots --\nMIDNIGHT in the tall grass. The cat turns, looks over her\nshoulder once -- her EYES catch moonlight and GLOW. Patience\nis clearly meant to follow.\nPATIENCE follows MIDNIGHT on all fours, tenuously at first.\nBut as she proceeds, her shoulders and hips roll in\ndistinctly feline fashion. Her body seems slimmer, more\nmuscular. She rises on two legs, moving in a slinky crouch.\nMIDNIGHT pauses to sharpen her claws on the bark of a gnarled\nold TREE. PATIENCE follows Midnight's lead, leans forward\nagainst the trunk, arms straight out, head arched back. She\nstretches her neck, her back -- her every movement is\ngraceful, sensual, the awkwardness gone.\nShe tries to pull her hands from the tree -- but can't for a\nmoment, finding her FINGER-NAILS stuck into the bark (like a\ncat at a scratching post).\nA DOG BARKS -- without thinking about it, PATIENCE scrambles\nup the side of the tree like a streak.\nHER POV FROM TREE -- A LARGE DOG tugs on its OWNER'S leash,\nsome distance away. The dog walker yanks the dog onward.\nPATIENCE takes this in, hears a MEOW --\nMIDNIGHT is perched above her, very Cheshire Cat-like.\nPATIENCE looks around, self-conscious for a moment -- what is\nshe doing up a tree? Bad idea to think. She loses her\nbalance, clutching at branches, tumbles out of the tree --\nIN MIDAIR for an instant, she flails spastically, letting out\na SHRIEK -- then her body instinctively TWISTS and --\nPATIENCE LANDS on all fours, one leg kicked out, haunches\nlow. MIDNIGHT lands beside her, nods approvingly at her\nlanding. Then the cat darts away again, Patience pursues.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    31.\n\n\n\n\n\nEXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT\n\nMIDNIGHT leaps to the top of a FENCE, staring down at\nPatience -- \"come on.\" Patience hesitates, then crouches and\nSPRINGS UP (with more than human ability), lands triumphantly\non the fence -- then teeters and TUMBLES to the other side.\nMIDNIGHT looks disappointed. Patience jumps up again\nquickly, as if pretending this never happened, this time\nmanaging to hold her balance.\nMIDNIGHT gives her a look and leads onward. At first she's\nlike a tightrope walker, careful of falling, but her steps\nbecome more confident. Soon she's moving as quickly and\nsmoothly as the cat.\nMIDNIGHT leaps off the fence and darts across a road,\nPATIENCE follows.\n\n\n\n\nEXT. PUBLIC GARDEN/ZOO - NIGHT\n\nA tall wrought-iron FENCE surrounds greenery and distant\ncages in an urban area. A SIGN: \"ARBORETUM - ZOO.\"\nMIDNIGHT squeezes through a gap between the uprights.\nPATIENCE hesitates -- this is too narrow for a normal human.\nMIDNIGHT waits impatiently on the other side, tail twitching.\nPATIENCE makes a dubious SOUND, but manages to slip a foot --\nthen a leg -- into the opening, twisting and contorting.\nAmazingly, she's succeeding, her torso ripples and contracts\nas she insinuates herself between the bars. Finally only her\nhead is on the wrong side. With a final TUG, she's through.\nMIDNIGHT crouches low, stalking. PATIENCE copies the\nbehavior. MIDNIGHT slowly approaches --\nA MOTH, fluttering near a FLOWER in this botanical garden.\nMIDNIGHT sneaks up close, then POUNCES, but the MOTH flies\nout of the cat's grasp.\n\n\n\nPATIENCE GIGGLES, MIDNIGHT turns on her and HISSES. The\nwoman and the cat roll together in this neat BOTANICAL\nGARDEN, playing and batting at each other. CAMERA MOVES TO a\nsmall sign nearby, which labels this planting as \"CATNIP.\"\nMIDNIGHT HURTLES a CONCRETE MOAT, PATIENCE follows, still\nhigh, giggly. She suddenly finds herself face to face with:\nA BENGAL TIGER.

EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\nPATIENCE is wrapped in a BLANKET, sitting on the couch,\nMIDNIGHT nuzzling her, as EDNA brings her a cup of TEA.

She works for a cosmetics company called Hedare Beauty, which is ready to ship a new skin cream called Beau-Line, that is able to reverse the effects of aging. However, as Patience visits the factory where it is being manufactured, she overhears a discussion between the scientist, Dr. Ivan Slavicky (Peter Wingfield), and Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone), the wife of company owner George Hedare (Lambert Wilson); speaking about the dangerous side effects from continued use of the product. Laurel's guards discover Patience and are ordered to dispose of her. Patience tries to escape using a conduit pipe, but the minions have it sealed and flush her out of it, drowning her. Lying washed up on the shore and lifeless, Patience is mysteriously brought back to life by an Egyptian Mau cat, who appeared at her apartment earlier, and from that moment on develops cat-like abilities.\nWith the help of the Mau's owner, eccentric researcher Ophelia Powers (Frances Conroy), who tells her that Egyptian Mau cats serve as messengers of the goddess Bast, Patience understands that she is becoming a \"catwoman\" reborn with abilities that are both a blessing and a curse. Wearing a mask to disguise her identity, Patience stalks the night as Catwoman seeking the answers to who killed her and why. Eventually, her search (which involves finding Slavicky murdered and being accused of it) leads her to Laurel. She asks Laurel to keep an eye on her husband, to which Laurel agrees. However, when Patience confronts George (who is at an opera with another woman), he reveals he knows nothing about the side effects. The police arrive and Catwoman escapes. Later on, Laurel murders her husband for his infidelity, and admits to killing Dr. Slavicky as well for his attempts to take the product back to formula. She contacts Catwoman and frames her for the murder and is taken into custody by the police, but not before Laurel reveals the side-effect of the cosmetic product: discontinuing using it would make the skin disintegrate while continued use would make the skin as hard as marble. She also plans to release the Beau-line in the market the following day.\nPatience slips out of confinement and confronts Laurel in her office, revealing that Laurel is the one responsible for her death. During the fight, she scratches Laurel's face, and Laurel nearly plummets to her death when she falls out of a window, grabbing onto a pipe for her life. Laurel sees her face in a reflection and is horrified by her skin's rapid disintegration, fails to grab hold of Patience's outstretched arm and falls to her death. Though Patience is cleared of any charges made against her regarding the deaths of Dr. Slavicky and the Hedares, she chooses to continue living outside the law enjoying her new-found freedom as the mysterious Catwoman."}

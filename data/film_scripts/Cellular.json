In the\ndistance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the\nDowntown Los Angeles skyline.\nIn ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal\nthe vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood.\nHOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a\ngleaming mountain bike... It's early in the morning, and the\nlandscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet.\nCONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face    the resplendent\nMartin residence. We STEADICAM down the fr    ont walk, able to\nadmire the manicured hedges and the black E   scalade in the\ndriveway, to the front door decorated with    a whimsical\nplacard that reads, \"The Martins\" -- and we    pass THROUGH THE\nKEYHOLE into the foyer.\n\nINT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - MORNING\nWe TRACK through the living room, passing framed photos of an\nathletic eleven year old boy, and we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE as\nshe comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her\nside.\n\n                     WOMAN\n               (into phone)\n          Yes Donna, I'm out the door.\nWe TRACK over the Woman's shoulder and follow her into the\nkitchen, unable to see her face.\n\n                     WOMAN (CONT'D)\n          Just inform Kayleigh that\n          anesthesia is on the way to prep\n          the epidural and I'll be there as\n          soon as I can.\nStill looking over her shoulder, we watch her absently\nstraighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she\ntalks.\n\n                    WOMAN (CONT'D)\n          And promise her she's about to have\n          a woooonnderful labor.\nAs the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee, her\nHOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket.\nThey give each other a silent wave.\n\n                    WOMAN (CONT'D)\n          Right, I'll see you in twenty.\nShe hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME\nAROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN; slightly weary, but\nready for the day ahead.\n\n                     JESSICA\n          Buenas dias, Rosario.\n\n\n\n                      ROSARIO\n           Good morning Miss Jessica.\nJessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits PLAY.\nIn the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads\nfor the back door carrying the basket of laundry.\n\n                 MALE VOICE\n           (on machine)\n           Honey?

KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAY\nThe BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us.\nWe quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through:\nAn IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property. They\nbounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees--\nANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its\ndestination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is\ndead. The trees are dead. It's the kind of place you could\nscream for a week and no one would hear a thing.\nAs the van stops--\n\n                                     WE PUSH INTO ITS DOORS:\n\nINT. DARKENED ATTIC - KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE\nA door CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing\nthe dusty, skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the\nroom and falls to the floor. With bound hands, she\nfrantically pulls her blindfold off to see--\n\nTHE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPER\nStanding in front of her.    Sturdier than the rest.   Solid.\nImposing.\n\n                     JESSICA\n          Wh... what do you want?\nUnsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her.\nJessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze...\nThen suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room.\nJessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her\nthroat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT.\nGrim as death, he stalks toward her --\n\n                       JESSICA (CONT'D)\n          No, wait..\nAnd reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS --\n\n                     JESSICA (CONT'D)\n\n          NO!   PLEASE--//\nSMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above\nJessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that\nhung there.\nAs phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns\nand stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking\nJessica in the darkness.\nOnly now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to\nshow through. Trembling, tears running down her face,\nJessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic--\n\n\n\n                       JESSICA (CONT'D)\n            Wha... what the hell is happening?!\nThe attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets.\n\n                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\nTHE OCEAN\nSkimming along the water.\nAnd we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern\nCalifornia, and at the center of it all, the SANTA MONICA\n\nPIER.\n\nEXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - MORNING - ESTABLISHING\nIt would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are\npreparing for a \"HEAL THE BAY\" rally at the end of the pier.\nVENDORS set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead.\nBIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE\nMOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design.\nHOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand.\nFISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite.\n\nINT. SANTA MONICA PIER - ARCADE - MORNING\n\nANGLE ON - ARCADE GAME SCREEN.\nThe screen displays a car-race arcade game. A computer\ngenerated hot-rod passes other racers at breakneck speed.\nPlaying the sit-down game, DAYTONA USA, is:\nRYAN ACKERMAN, early twenties, looks like he grew up on the\nbeach without so much as a pot to piss in. His lethal\nreflexes and bold recklessness, however, have made him a Jedi\nMaster of the game.\nRyan's score approaches the HIGH SCORE at the top of the\nscreen.\n\n                       RYAN\n            You recording this?\n\n                       CHAD (OS)\n            Yeah, sure...\nCHAD, his best bud, aims a BLUE TOOTH VIDEOSTREAMING\nCELLPHONE at some CUTE GIRLS instead.

Figure\n            by the tenth time I'll have to go\n            somewhere else.\nRyan's car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames.       Game Over.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nTHE OCEAN\nAs seen looking over the rail of the pier.      The tide is in,\nbut it's still a forty foot drop.\n\n\nRYAN stares over the railing like a death row inmate\ncontemplating his last meal.\n\n                      CHAD\n           Go already. No one's looking.\nHis left hand holds his WALLET.\n\n                 CHAD (CONT'D)\n           (re: wallet)\n           Need me to hold that?\nRyan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts -- he zips\na zipper, tucks a Velcro flap. Pats his pocket proudly.\n\n                     RYAN\n          Waterproof.\nBut as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL, his left\nleg starts trembling like crazy.\n\n                     RYAN (CONT'D)\n          This is stupid. I could get\n          killed. Pick another dare.\nChad lowers the phone, irritated.\n\n                     CHAD\n          My ass.

After she returns home, assailants enter her home through the back door, kill her housemaid, kidnap her, and confine her in the attic of their safe house. Ethan Greer (Jason Statham), the gang leader, smashes the attic's telephone to prevent her from contacting anyone. She has no idea who the kidnappers are or what they want. She pieces together the wires of the broken phone and randomly makes a connection. She reaches the cell phone of Ryan (Chris Evans), who has just been dumped by his girlfriend, Chloe (Jessica Biel), for being irresponsible. He believes the call is a joke, but Jessica persuades him to go to the police. At the police station, Desk Sergeant Mooney (William H. Macy) tells him to go to the detectives on the fourth floor. He begins to lose the signal in the stairwell, so he turns back to avoid losing the connection. Meanwhile, Ethan returns to the safe house and asks Jessica about something she doesn't know. When Jessica tells him that she doesn't know, he tells her that he is going to get her son.\nOverhearing them, Ryan realizes how serious the situation is. After Ethan leaves, she tells Ryan to reach her son's school before they do. He is too late and her son is kidnapped. Ryan hijacks a security officer's car and gives chase. Because his cell phone battery is dying, he drives to a shop for a charger. After being repeatedly redirected from counter to counter, he uses a gun from the security vehicle to hold up the store and get the charger. Sergeant Mooney, meanwhile, decides to check on the kidnapping claim. He uses the Department of Motor Vehicles records to find Jessica's address, but when he comes to her house, a woman meets him, telling him that she is Jessica and everything is fine. Believing it to be a false alarm, he leaves. It is revealed that the woman is Dana Bayback (Valerie Cruz), an accomplice of the kidnappers. Ethan returns to the safe house and asks Jessica for the location of a place called \"The Left Field\", where her husband, Craig, was. He reveals that he has Ricky and threatens to kill him if Jessica does not tell him what \"The Left Field\" means. She tells him that \"The Left Field\" is a bar at the Los Angeles International Airport.\nAs Ethan leaves, she tells Ryan that they have gone to get her husband. A cross-connection between phone lines causes Ryan to grab a nearby lawyer's (Rick Hoffman) cell phone as well as his car after his own is destroyed. Jessica urges him to find her husband, and at the airport, he tries to stop the kidnappers by planting the gun under one of their jackets. The gun trips the alarm and security intervenes, but the kidnappers flash police badges and apprehend Craig. Ryan and Jessica realize that Ethan and his gang are police officers. After viewing a news report, Mooney identifies Ryan and calls Jessica's home. When he hears the voicemail greeting, he notices that Jessica's voice on the answering machine is different from that of the woman he met. Craig is brought into the attic and is forced to reveal the location of a videotape. He tells them that it is in a bank safe deposit box. Ethan and his friends, Dimitri (Eric Etebari) and Deason (Matt McColm), go with Craig while another kidnapper stands guard. Ryan also reaches the bank, and when the kidnappers retrieve the video camera, he grabs it and flees to the roof.\nHowever, he accidentally drops the cell phone off the roof, smashing it to pieces. He manages to escape in a taxi, and while watching the videotape learns that Craig accidentally shot footage of LAPD Detective Ethan, Mad Dog (Brendan Kelly), Dimitri, Bayback, Deason, and Jack Tanner (Noah Emmerich), a friend of Mooney, robbing and murdering drug dealers. Ryan steals the lawyer's car again from the impound lot and manages to retrieve his own cell phone. Mooney returns to the Martin residence, where Bayback shoots at him, injuring him. He retaliates and kills her but learns, to his dismay, that she was a cop. Back at the safe house, Mad Dog notices a light on one of the buttons on the phone, picks up the receiver and learns that Jessica has been trying to contact help. Angered, he heads upstairs and attacks her, but Jessica kills him by cutting his brachial artery, causing him to bleed to death in seconds. She attempts to escape with her son, but Ethan returns with Craig hostage and stops her. Before Ethan can do anything, Ryan uses his cell phone's memory to contact Ethan and makes a deal directly over the phone: the videotape in exchange for the Martin family.\nUpon learning of the meeting, Tanner convinces Mooney to go so that he can identify Ryan. The deal goes down at the Santa Monica Pier. Ryan tries to handle it his way in disguise, but his ex-girlfriend accidentally exposes him, after which Mooney is able to identify him as the young man who met him at the station earlier. While Tanner sends Dimitri to help Mooney get needed medical attention, he takes Ryan to Ethan. Ethan destroys the video recording and Tanner radios the order to kill the Martins, although Deason in the van suggests they wait until they get to the safe house. However, Mooney overhears the radio transmission. Ryan escapes, following a distraction by his friend Chad (Eric Christian Olsen); Mooney overpowers Dimitri and handcuffs him on the stairs. Tanner and Ethan confront Ryan in a boathouse, where Ryan knocks out Tanner, but Ethan beats him up until Mooney intervenes. After a brief chase, Ryan notices that Ethan has circled behind Mooney, and helps Mooney by calling Ethan's cell phone. The ring of the cell betrays Ethan's position, and Mooney promptly shoots him to death. As Ethan falls, he looks dumbfoundedly at Ryan, and then at Ryan's cell phone, the \"weapon\" that killed him.\nMeanwhile, Jessica manages to strangle Deason with her handcuff chain from the rear of their van, then frees her husband and son. But Deason was merely stunned, and aims his gun at them. Ryan intervenes and smashes him with the van doors until he is unconscious. While Ryan and Mooney are being treated by medics, Tanner is also exposed, because Ryan had copied the video recording onto his cell phone, and the Martin family is set free. Jessica finally gets to meet the man who has risked his life saving her and her family. Ryan jokingly requests that she never call him again."}

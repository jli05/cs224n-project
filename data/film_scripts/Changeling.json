COLLINS HOME - PRE-DAWN\n          \n          A small, pleasant house on a tree-lined street in Los Angeles\n          circa 1928. 210 North Avenue 23. Not far from Dodger Stadium.\n          \n          SUPERIMPOSE: LOS ANGELES, MARCH 9, 1928.\n          \n          INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN\n          \n          A Bakelite alarm clock hits 6:30 A.M. and RINGS. CHRISTINE\n          COLLINS, thirties, attractive, rumpled, reaches INTO FRAME to\n          shut it off. She sits up, rubs tiredly at her face, and moves\n          OS, switching on a radio as she goes. Music fills the air.\n          \n          INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          She throws water on her face as the music continues. She\n          looks at herself in the mirror as the light flickers overhead.\n          She hits the wall offhandedly, something she does every day.\n          The flickering stops. With a last look at the mirror, she\n          smoothes back her hair and exits, switching off the light.\n          \n          INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - LATER\n          Dressed now, she flicks on the overhead light. WALTER COLLINS\n          is nine years old, with light brown hair, though we don't see\n          much of it or him, he's entangled in the sheets. It's\n          important that we don't see him too clearly in most of the\n          following scenes, but without drawing attention to that aspect.\n          \n                                CHRISTINE\n                      Walter...time for school, honey.\n          \n          She sits on the edge of the bed, runs a hand through his hair.\n          \n                                WALTER\n                      Just ten more minutes --\n          \n                                CHRISTINE\n                      Sorry, champ.\n                                (more)\n          \n          CHANGELING A True Story                                       2.\n          \n          \n                               CHRISTINE (Cont'd)\n                     You can sleep in all you want\n                     tomorrow, that's what Saturdays are\n                     for.

He sits\n          on the edge of the bed, wavers, then falls back into bed again.\n          \n          EXT. PASADENA AVENUE - MORNING\n          \n          A street-car (known then as the Big Red) rumbles down the\n          street in the gray light of morning, passing Ford Model A's\n          and Hudsons and Nash four-door sedans.\n          \n          INT. STREET-CAR - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Christine sits on one of the benches, Walter's face buried in\n          her lap, still half-asleep. She nudges him as they come to\n          an intersection by a grade school. It's early enough that\n          only a few other kids have arrived.\n          \n                               CHRISTINE\n                     We're here, sweetie.   Come on.\n          \n          She hands him a sack lunch and follows as he slouches toward\n          the door. She watches from the curb as he heads toward the\n          school. Some of the teachers lounging outside nod to her as\n          Walter approaches, so she knows they're aware that he's there.\n          \n          She waves, then hurriedly gets back on the street-car as it\n          rumbles away.\n\n          \n          INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY\n          Located on Grand Avenue downtown, the huge switchboard room\n          is a maze of switching stations, tangles of wires and heavy\n          wooden headsets...a roar of buzzers, bells, circuits opening\n          and closing, and a hundred female operators speaking at once.\n          \n          Supervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes created\n          by the banks of switching stations, going from one operator\n          to another as needed. Christine is one of them. She turns\n          at the SOUND of a bell struck twice, then rolls down the lane\n          toward an OPERATOR frantically waving a pink sheet of paper.\n          \n                               CHRISTINE\n                     Okay Sandy, what's the prob--\n          \n          The mortified operator hands her the headset and stalks off.\n          \n          CHANGELING A True Story                                       3.\n          \n          \n                               OPERATOR\n                     You deal with this one, I'm not\n                     going near it.\n          \n          Christine struggles on the headset.\n          \n                                CHRISTINE\n                     Hello?

No, I...I've never heard of\n                     anything like that before either.\n                     Guess there's a first time for\n                     everything, right? No, I'm afraid\n                     there's nothing we can do about\n                     people abusing the equipment or...\n                     themselves. I'm sorry. I --\n          \n          She reacts to the phone being hung up hard at the other end\n          as the floor manager, BEN HARRIS, 30s, approaches.\n          \n                               MR.

PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - LUNCH AREA - DAY\n          \n          Christine sits alone, eating a bag lunch and reading a thick\n          telephone company manual. Working hard to advance herself.\n          \n          Then a bell rings: time to return to work. Other employees\n          gather up their belongings and start inside. As Christine\n          closes the book, her bookmark falls out. As she picks it up,\n          we see that it's a child's drawing: her and Walter (with arrows\n          indicating who is who) on a green hill, under an orange sun.\n          \n          She touches the drawing and smiles as the bell rings again.\n          She grabs her belongs and heads back inside.\n          \n          EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON\n          \n          Christine waits outside the school as another bell rings,\n          announcing the end of classes. Kids run outside, Walter among\n          them. He folds in alongside as they start down the sidewalk.\n          \n                               CHRISTINE\n                     Hey, sport.\n          \n                                  WALTER\n                     Hey, mom.\n          \n                               CHRISTINE\n                     So how was school?\n          \n                                WALTER\n                     Okay.

We've known for some time\n                     that trauma can affect the growth\n                     of children. Given the stress of\n                     the last four months his spine may\n                     have actually shrunk.

TARR\n                     Very likely his abductor thought it\n                     appropriate. After all, circumcision\n                     is hygienically sound. Must have\n                     been quite traumatic at the time.\n                     No wonder he's submerged the memory.\n          \n                               CHRISTINE\n                     Look, doctor --\n          \n                               DR.

But it's good for you to\n                     raise these questions.

So which of you can\n                     identify Walter for me, for his\n                     mother, and for the police?

It's clear they don't recognize\n          the boy, but they're intimidated by the presence of Tarr and\n          the police officer.

My name is Christine\n                     Collins. On March 10th, my nine\n                     year old son, Walter Collins,\n                     disappeared. A four month\n                     investigation resulted in a boy\n                     being brought to Los Angeles from\n                     De Kalb, Illinois. They told me,\n                     and all of you, that this boy was\n                     my son. They were wrong.\n                         (beat)\n                     The Los Angeles Police Department\n                     made a mistake...a terrible mistake.\n                     The boy they found is not my son.\n                     That is the reason for the supposed\n                     \"transformation.\" I have letters\n                     from his dentist, his teachers and\n                     others confirming that this boy is\n                     not my son. The letters are being\n                     reprinted now, and I should have\n                     them for you tomorrow.\n          \n          Flashbulbs pop, dazzling her.    She composes herself.\n          \n                                CHRISTINE\n                     I have given the police department\n                     every opportunity to admit their\n                     mistake and renew the search for my\n                     son. Since they have refused to do\n                     so, I have no choice but to present\n                     my case before the public. I hope\n                     this will persuade the police to\n                     finish the job they started, and\n                     bring my son home to me.\n                         (beat)\n                     Thank you.\n          \n          CHANGELING A True Story                                    47.\n          \n          \n          As the reporters start to shout out questions, we PAN ACROSS\n          to a BEAT COP who has been watching. He goes quickly to a\n          police call-box, unlocks it and picks up the telephone.\n          \n          INT. LINCOLN HEIGHTS STATION - DAY\n          \n          The glass door to Captain Jones' office is closed, but we can\n          SEE him on the phone. Finally, he hangs up and comes out of\n          the office. His tone is cold but neutral...we think this\n          could go either way. He stops an officer.\n          \n                               JONES\n                     Morelli, I want you to find the\n                     Collins woman and get her here.\n                     Bring her in the back way, and have\n                     a couple of matrons standing by.\n          \n                                 1ST COP\n                     Yes, sir.\n          \n          He heads off as Jones goes into his office, closing the door.\n          \n          EXT. LINCOLN HEIGHT STATION - REAR ENTRANCE - DAY (RAIN)\n          \n          A police car pulls up to the curb, and Christine and \"Walter\"\n          emerge from the back seat.

JONES' OFFICE\n          \n          He leaves the door open and indicates for Christine to sit.\n          She does.

This\n                     situation has become an embarrassment\n                     for the entire department.\n          \n                               CHRISTINE\n                     It wasn't my intention to embarrass\n                     anyone.\n                               JONES\n                     No, of course not. You just told\n                     the papers we can't tell one boy\n                     from another as a compliment for\n                     the months we spent working on your\n                     case. Are you trying to make fools\n                     out of us? Is that it?

She becomes aware that the\n          door is open, and he's doing this for the benefit of anyone\n          who might be listening in.\n          \n          CHANGELING A True Story                            49.\n          \n          \n                               JONES\n                     You know what your problem is? You\n                     want to shirk your responsibilities\n                     as a mother. You enjoyed being a\n                     free woman, didn't you? Enjoyed\n                     not having to worry about a young\n                     son. You could do what you wanted,\n                     go where you wanted, see anyone you\n                     wanted. But then we found your\n                     son. Brought him back. And now\n                     he's an inconvenience. That's why\n                     you cooked up this whole scheme, to\n                     try and throw him to the state, let\n                     the state raise him for you.\n          \n                               CHRISTINE\n                     That's not true!\n          \n                               JONES\n                     No?

He slams into Ybarra, knocking\n          him down.

He looks behind him to see the other two\n          Mounties running rooftop to rooftop, coming fast.\n          \n          Gordon runs faster, going at angles to put more distance\n          between himself and the police on the ground...and making\n          increasingly more difficult and dangerous leaps from rooftop\n          to rooftop.\n          \n          He leaps across one chasm, barely makes it, keeps running.\n          The rooftop Mounties follow.

The Mountie jumps...but he's short.\n          He grabs onto a rain gutter. Gordon sees his situation, runs\n          back, and STOMPS on the Mountie's hands, trying to get him to\n          shake loose. The gutter starts to tear free --\n          \n          -- when a Mountie down below FIRES at Gordon, making him back\n          off. The Mountie clinging to the gutter starts to fall, then\n          grabs a nearby pipe and crawls up to the roof. Keeps coming.\n          \n          Gordon keeps running...but comes to a chasm too wide to be\n          jumped. He hesitates, starts to cut back in another direction --\n          \n          -- when the Mountie TACKLES him hard.

As one of the men puts his\n          coat behind the sofa, we see that it contains a sawed-off\n          shotgun. Briegleb looks out the window, to where a police\n          car sits, watching the house.\n          \n                                                    DISSOLVE TO:\n          \n          INT. CHRISTINE'S HOUSE - MORNING\n          \n          She's dressed in her best dress, putting on a hat and a pair\n          of gloves. Her hands are shaking. She squeezes them together,\n          closes her eyes. Focuses. With one final, deep breath, she\n          heads out.\n          \n          EXT. COLLINS HOME - MORNING\n          \n          The same police car is there as Christine gets into a car\n          with Briegleb and the two drive off. The other three men get\n          into another car and follow. The police car in turn pulls\n          away from the curb, following both cars.\n          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - BRIEGLEB'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER\n          \n          He's aware that they're being followed, glancing in the rear\n          view mirror to keep an eye on things. Looks over to Christine,\n          smiles encouragingly. Looks ahead.\n          \n                                BRIEGLEB\n                     Traffic's getting heavy.   We'll go\n                     up Spring.\n          \n          He turns. The other cars do the same. But the traffic here\n          is even worse. Just then, Briegleb looks back in his rear\n          view mirror to see --\n          \n          -- another police car pulling out of a driveway and cutting\n          off the car with Christine's bodyguards.\n          \n          CHANGELING A True Story                                  106.\n          \n          \n          Briegleb turns quickly, trying to get ahead, but the street's\n          too busy. He looks in the mirror to see that another police\n          car glide into position two cars behind them.\n          \n          Traffic stops. Jammed. Briegleb is nervous, sensing the\n          very real possibility of a hit being set up. The traffic is\n          lined right up against parked cars on either side. Then\n          there's a momentary break in traffic.\n          \n                                BRIEGLEB\n                     Hold on.\n          \n          He turns hard into the driveway of a closed shop and shuts\n          off the engine. Jumps out and opens the door for Christine,\n          who gets out.\n          \n                               BRIEGLEB\n                     Start walking. Quickly.\n          \n          They do. He glances back at the police car. The two inside\n          start to open the doors, but they can't get them open, being\n          right up against parked cars on one side and traffic on the\n          other. They run the siren to clear traffic, but it's too\n          late as --\n          \n          -- Christine and Briegleb hurry down the street on foot,\n          Briegleb glancing behind them. The foot- and car-traffic is\n          very heavy...we HEAR horns honking and, in the distance,\n          something that could be the sound of lots of people.\n          \n                               REV.

The police car has popped its doors,\n          and two trench-coated officers are getting out. Christine\n          stops a man passing in the opposite direction.\n          \n                               CHRISTINE\n                     Excuse me, can you tell me what the\n                     problem is up ahead?\n          \n                               MAN\n                     Didn't you hear?

Briegleb and Collins slowly exchange a look\n          somewhere between disbelief and \"oh shit.\"\n          \n                               CHRISTINE\n                     He didn't mean...he couldn't mean --\n          \n                               REV.

Thousands of people crowd into the street, overwhelming\n          the police presence...not rioting, but making their voices\n          heard.\n          \n          The Salvation Army, the Women's Temperance Society, the Society\n          for Justice, Catholic groups, Union groups and ordinary\n          citizens carrying placards and signs that read WE SUPPORT\n          CHRISTINE COLLINS and JUSTICE FOR MRS. COLLINS and THE LAPD:\n          A CITY'S SHAME...it just goes on and on and on. Christine\n          looks out to see her boss from the telephone company, Mr.\n          Harris, marching arm in arm with the rest. He sees her,\n          smiles, tips his hat and continues marching.\n          \n          Christine is stunned...Briegleb even moreso.\n          \n                               CHRISTINE\n                     Oh...my....\n          \n                               REV.

COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          Dead silence, in marked contrast to the city council room.\n          As she enters, she sees people sitting silently in the\n          gallery...row after row of couples, mothers and fathers, some\n          weeping softly. Some of them notice Christine's entrance and\n          nod to her with sadness and a strange sense of common\n          bond...they are all carrying the same grief.\n          \n          One of the couples, MR. AND MRS. CLAY, see Christine and go\n          to her, speaking softly. They should be distinct enough in\n          appearance that we will recognize them instantly when we see\n          them again later.\n          \n                                MRS.

They take their seats as a judge and two attorneys\n          take their places, preceded by a bailiff.\n          \n                                 BAILIFF\n                     All rise.\n          \n          They do. The judge takes his seat. The rest of the room\n          also sits. He nods to the bailiff, who in turn opens another\n          door, leading to the holding area.\n          \n          As Christine looks on, Gordon Stewart Northcott is ushered\n          into the courtroom for his initial plea. Some women break\n          into tears at the sight of him. He first seems startled by\n          the presence of so many, then he smiles. An audience.\n          \n          As he takes his place beside his attorney, he looks down the\n          room and meets the gaze of Christine Collins. Her face pales,\n          as though slapped...but she doesn't look away.\n          \n                               GORDON\n                     Hey...I saw you in the papers.

Bailiff....\n          \n          The bailiff removes Gordon, who shares one last look with his\n          audience, and Christine in particular. He winks at her. She\n          doesn't give him a flicker of satisfaction with a reaction.\n          But once he's gone, she sits heavily and covers her eyes,\n          fighting tears. Hahn puts a hand on her shoulder, but says\n          nothing.

Throughout this period,\n                     she acted strangely.

It\n                     was because of her disturbing\n                     behavior that I submitted her for\n                     observation to the psychopathic\n                     ward of Los Angeles County General\n                     Hospital.\n          \n                               HAHN\n                     Just like that.

Northcott\n          nods to Christine, then glances to the guard, who looks to\n          Christine.\n          \n                               PRISON GUARD\n                     I can stay in the room if you want,\n                     ma'am.\n          \n                               CHRISTINE\n                     No, I'm...sure I'll be fine.\n          \n                               PRISON GUARD\n                     All right...I'll be right outside\n                     the door if you need anything.\n                         (to northcott)\n                     Twenty minutes.\n          \n          The guard exits, leaving the two alone.\n          \n                               GORDON\n                     Don't suppose you've got a cigarette?\n          \n                               CHRISTINE\n                     No, I don't smoke.\n          \n          He nods, walks to the window to a nearby structure.\n          \n                               GORDON\n                     That's where they do it, you know.\n                     That building right over there.\n          \n          CHANGELING A True Story                                  125.\n          \n          \n                               CHRISTINE\n                     That's where they do what?\n          \n                               GORDON\n                     The hangings. Ten o'clock tonight,\n                     I get to see what's inside. I hear\n                     there's thirteen steps going up to\n                     the gallows...'cause thirteen is\n                     unlucky.

Got a steak\n                     coming, with spinach, mashed potatoes\n                     and green beans. I always wondered\n                     why they did that whole last meal\n                     thing. One of the other guys on\n                     Death Row said when you take the\n                     drop, you foul yourself, and\n                     everything you ate...comes out the\n                     other end. So maybe that's why\n                     they make sure you got something in\n                     you when it happens. They like\n                     knowing you fouled yourself on the\n                     way to --\n          \n          He stops himself.

He nods absently for a moment.\n                               GORDON\n                     The warden, Clinton Duffy, he's a\n                     good guy. He's writing a book about\n                     all the death sentences he's carried\n                     out in this place.

Christine is among the\n          parents. The Clays see her, and put a hand on her arm for\n          strength.

So I kept off the main roads\n                     until I saw a train stopped at a\n                     crossing, and I jumped in.\n          \n          CHANGELING A True Story                                  137.\n          \n          \n                               YBARRA\n                     Why didn't you tell anyone what had\n                     happened?\n          \n                                 DAVID\n                     I was afraid!

I was on my\n                     own until I got a free meal from\n                     this lady, Mrs. Lansing.

Upon being released in 1934, he returned\n          home to Canada, and was never heard from again.\n          \n          Upon returning to duty after his suspension, Captain J. J.\n          Jones was demoted to Lieutenant and subsequently sued by\n          Christine Collins in civil court. He was found guilty and\n          fined $10,800 (equal to $125,000 in 2006 dollars). He never\n          paid.\n          \n          One year after the City Council recommended the removal of\n          the Los Angeles Chief of Police, James E Davis resigned from\n          office and was replaced by Roy E.

Strict medical\n          procedures were set in place to prevent future abuse.\n          \n          In November 1929, Los Angeles Mayor George E.

Reverend Gustav Briegleb (Malkovich) publicizes Christine's plight and rails against the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) for its incompetence, corruption and the extrajudicial punishment meted out by its \"Gun Squad\" led by Chief James E. Davis (Feore). Several months after Walter's disappearance, the LAPD tells Christine that he has been found alive. Believing the positive publicity will negate recent criticism of the department, the LAPD organizes a public reunion. Although \"Walter\" (Devon Conti) claims he is Christine's son, she says he is not. Captain J. J. Jones (Donovan), the head of the LAPD's Juvenile Division, insists the boy is Walter and pressures Christine into taking him home \"on a trial basis\".\nAfter Christine confronts Jones with physical discrepancies between \"Walter\" and her son, Jones arranges for a medical doctor to visit her. He tells Christine that \"Walter\" is three inches shorter than before his disappearance because trauma has shrunk his spine, and that the man who took Walter had him circumcised. A newspaper prints a story that implies Christine is an unfit mother; Briegleb tells Christine it was planted by police to discredit her. Walter's teacher and dentist give Christine signed letters confirming \"Walter\" is an impostor. Christine tells her story to the press; as a result, Jones sends her to Los Angeles County Hospital's \"psychopathic ward\". She befriends inmate Carol Dexter (Ryan), who tells Christine she is one of several women who were sent there for challenging police authority. Dr. Steele (O'Hare) deems Christine delusional and forces her to take mood-regulating pills. Steele says he will release Christine if she admits she was mistaken about \"Walter\"; she refuses.\nDetective Ybarra (Kelly) travels to a ranch in Wineville, Riverside County, to arrange the deportation of 15-year-old Sanford Clark (Eddie Alderson) to Canada. The boy's uncle, Gordon Northcott (Harner), has fled after a chance encounter with Ybarra, who mentions his business there being a juvenile matter. Clark tells Ybarra that Northcott forced him to help kidnap and murder around twenty children, and identifies Walter as one of them. Jones tells Briegleb that Christine is in protective custody following a mental breakdown. Jones orders Clark's deportation, but Ybarra makes Clark reveal the murder site. Briegleb secures Christine's release by showing Steele a newspaper story about the Wineville killings that names Walter as a possible victim. Under interrogation by Ybarra, Walter's impostor reveals his motive was to secure transport to Los Angeles to see his favorite actor, Tom Mix, and says the police told him to lie about being Christine's son. The police capture Northcott in Vancouver, Canada. Christine's attorney (Pierson) secures a court order for the release of the other unjustly imprisoned women.\nOn the day of the city council's hearing into the case, Christine and Briegleb arrive at Los Angeles City Hall, where they encounter thousands of protesters who are demanding answers from the city. The hearing is intercut with scenes from Northcott's trial. The council concludes that Jones and Davis should be removed from duty, and that extrajudicial internments by police must be reviewed. Northcott's jury finds him guilty of murder and the judge sentences him to death by hanging.\nTwo years later, Christine has not given up her search for Walter. Northcott sends her a message saying he is willing to admit to killing Walter on condition that Christine meets him before his execution. She visits Northcott, but he refuses to tell her if he killed her son. Northcott is executed the next day.\nIn 1935, David Clay\u2014one of the boys assumed to have been killed\u2014is found alive in Hesperia, California. He reveals that one of the boys with whom he was imprisoned was Walter. David, Walter, and another boy escaped, but were separated. David does not know whether Walter was recaptured, giving Christine hope he is alive.\nIn the epilogue, it states that after the hearing, Captain Jones was suspended, Chief Davis was demoted, and Los Angeles Mayor George Cryer chose not to run for reelection. Rev. Briegleb continued to use his radio show to expose police misconduct and political corruption. Wineville changed its name to Mira Loma. Christine Collins never stopped searching for her son."}

FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE -- DUSK\n\n               Silence -- complete silence for the urbanite, though the \n               oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country -- \n               a few birds, a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy \n               clouds on the horizon, a dog's barking.\n\n               CAMERA PANS the green, squared-off flatland, lit only by a \n               fine sunset in its final throes. Then, gradually, starting \n               from nothing, a rumble is heard, quickly growing louder and \n               louder until the sound of a train can be recognized.\n\n               CAMERA PANS quickly, discovering the railroad line atop a \n               man-made rise of land, and the speeding passenger train is \n               upon us, flashing by with a roar.\n\n               Then, as if from nowhere, the figure of a man hits the \n               embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the \n               thick underbrush alongside the tracks.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- BODY\n\n               It lies in the bushes, still, unmoving -- dead. CAMERA PANS \n               AWAY to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the \n               train fades off until there is silence once more.\n\n               TITLE MUSIC begins with a crash.\n\n                                      (MAIN TITLES)\n\n               DELETED\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               EXT. MEGEVE -- DAY\n\n               A handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain-side \n               overlooking the French resort town. A large, open sun deck -- \n               tables, gaily colored parasols, sun bathers.\n\n               One of the latter is REGINA LAMPERT, a lovely young girl.\n\n               She is, besides taking in the sun, involved in her favorite \n               activity -- eating.\n\n               Then -- a dark, ominous shape intrudes in the f.g. FOCUS \n               CHANGES to bring into sharp relief a revolver -- shining, \n               black and ugly in the sunlight.\n\n               REGGIE, unaware of her danger, continues to eat.\n\n               The finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun \n               shoots -- a stream of water arcs, with unerring aim, straight \n               into REGGIE's face.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               Including JEAN-LOUIS, a French boy of six or so.

SYLVIE notices REGGIE's lunch which consists of \n               cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine and coffee.\n\n                                     SYLVIE\n                         When you start to eat like this \n                         something is the matter.\n\n               No answer from REGGIE. SYLVIE begins reading a magazine as \n               REGGIE continues eating.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.\n\n                                     SYLVIE\n                         \u00c7a alors!

I \n                         tried to make it work, I really have -- \n                         but --\n\n                                     SYLVIE\n                         But what?\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         I don't know how to explain it. I'm \n                         just too miserable.\n\n               REGGIE picks up a chicken leg and starts off. SYLVIE regards \n               the devastated table before following.\n\n                                     SYLVIE\n                         It is infuriating that your \n                         unhappiness does not turn to fat!\n\n               INT. SWIMMING POOL -- DAY\n\n               A magnificent indoor, glass-enclosed pool, the vista of snow-\n               covered mountains seen through the ceiling-high windows \n               beyond. REGGIE and SYLVIE are passing through, their \n               conversation continuing.\n\n                                     SYLVIE\n                         But why do you want a divorce?\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         Because I don't love him.\n\n                                     SYLVIE\n                         But that is no reason to get a \n                         divorce!\n\n               EXT. HOTEL TERRACE -- DAY\n\n               An open balcony running around two sides of the pool, sun-\n               worshippers lying in deck-chairs. REGGIE and SYLVIE appear, \n               their conversation continuing.\n\n                                     SYLVIE\n                         With a rich husband and this year's \n                         clothes you will not find it difficult \n                         to make some new friends.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                              (sitting)\n                         I admit I moved to Paris because I \n                         was tired of American Provincial,\n\n                                      \n                         but that doesn't mean I'm ready for \n                         French Traditional. I loathe the \n                         idea of divorce, Sylvie, but -- if \n                         only Charles had been honest with me -- \n                         that's all I ask of anybody -- the \n                         simple truth. But with him, everything \n                         is secrecy and lies. He's hiding \n                         something -- something frightening -- \n                         something terrible -- and evil.\n\n               She stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over \n               her. She wheels, terrified.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- PERUVIAN SNOW-MASK\n\n               A strange, grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the \n               face except for eyes, nose and mouth. The eyes inside this \n               particular mask stare down at REGGIE.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Does this belong to you?\n\n               CAMERA PANS down to include JEAN-LOUIS, his hand held firmly \n               by the man in the mask.\n\n               WIDER ANGLE\n\n               Including REGGIE, MAN, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS. REGGIE is too \n               terrified to answer. Realizing this, the man, PETER JOSHUA, \n               takes off the snow-mask to reveal a handsome, tanned face.\n\n                                     PETER\n                         Oh, forgive me.\n                              (indicating JEAN-LOUIS)\n                         Is this yours?\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                              (indicating SYLVIE)\n                         It's hers. Where'd you find him, \n                         robbing a bank?\n\n                                     PETER\n                         He was throwing snowballs at Baron \n                         Rothschild.\n                              (a pause)\n                         We don't know each other, do we?\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         Why, do you think we're going to?\n\n                                     PETER\n                         I don't know -- how would I know?\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         I'm afraid I already know a great \n                         many people. Until one of them dies \n                         I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.\n\n                                     PETER\n                              (smiling)\n                         Yes, of course. But you will let me \n                         know if anyone goes on the critical \n                         list\n                              (he starts off)\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         Quitter.\n\n                                     PETER\n                              (turning)\n                         How's that?\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         You give up awfully easy, don't you?\n\n               Eyeing one, then the other, SYLVIE sizes up the situation \n               and rises.\n\n                                     SYLVIE\n                         Viens, Jean-Louis, let us take a \n                         walk. I have never seen a Rothschild \n                         before.\n\n               SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS start off, but not before the boy \n               squirts PETER with his pistol.\n\n                                     PETER\n                              (drying)\n                         Clever fellow -- almost missed me.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         I'm afraid you're blocking my view.\n\n                                     PETER\n                              (moving)\n                         Sorry.

He removes a cigar from his desk and inserts it \n               into his mouth.\n\n                                     GRANDPIERRE\n                         Is it all right?\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         I wish you wouldn't.\n\n               He rips the cigar out of his mouth and slams it back into \n               the drawer, closing it fiercely. A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN sticks \n               his head in the door.\n\n                                     GRANDPIERRE\n                         Les effets de Lampert.\n\n               The POLICEMAN leaves and closes the door.\n\n                                     GRANDPIERRE\n                         On Wednesday last your husband sold \n                         the entire contents of the apartment \n                         at public auction.

He puts it back in \n               the drawer again. The door opens and the POLICEMAN enters \n               again, this time carrying a wicker basket which he deposits \n               on GRANDPIERRE's desk, and leaves.

There \n                         was no other baggage. Your husband \n                         must have been in a great hurry.\n\n               He begins to take them out, placing them on the desk, \n               identifying each item as he does.\n\n                                     GRANDPIERRE\n                         One wallet containing four thousand \n                         francs -- one agenda --\n                              (pausing, he opens \n                              the notebook)\n                         -- his last notation was made \n                         yesterday -- Thursday --\n                              (reading)\n                         \"Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs-\n                         Elys\u00e9es\"\n                              (looking up)\n                         Why there?\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         I don't know.

FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of the coffin. It rests on a low platform, with a \n               bouquet or two of flowers near the head, the lid open.\n\n               Inside, the face made up to look lifelike (but failing), lie \n               the remnants of Charles Lampert.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE\n\n               The INSPECTOR sits quietly, eyes downcast, staring at his \n               hands in a prayer-like attitude. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing \n               row after row of empty wooden bench-like seats in the large, \n               dimly-lit, high-ceilinged room. Finally, in the first row, \n               REGGIE and SYLVIE are discovered. Besides GRANDPIERRE, they \n               are the only ones present. REGGIE turns around to look at \n               the empty room. They speak in whispers.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         It's not exactly what I'd call a \n                         large turn-out.\n\n                                     SYLVIE\n                         Didn't Charles have any friends?\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.\n                              (indicating GRANDPIERRE)\n                         If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't \n                         even have him.\n\n                                     SYLVIE\n                         At least he knows how to behave at \n                         funerals.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE\n\n               His eyes still lowered. CAMERA PANS DOWN to feature his hands -- \n               he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper.\n\n               TWO SHOT -- SYLVIE AND REGGIE\n\n                                     SYLVIE\n                         Have you no idea who could have done \n                         it?\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         Until two days ago all I really knew \n                         about Charles was his name -- now it \n                         turns out I didn't even know that.\n\n               The front DOOR of the Chapel is heard opening and a shaft of \n               daylight streams in. The WOMEN turn.\n\n               MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR\n\n               The short, heavy-set figure of a MAN is outlined against the \n               bright outdoor light. He stands for a moment, then closes \n               the door after him. LEOPOLD GIDEON, short-sighted, bald, in \n               his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard \n               bird. Then he walks down one of the side aisles of the Chapel.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE\n\n               As he watches GIDEON.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE\n\n               As she watches him.\n\n               MED. SHOT -- THE BIER\n\n               GIDEON arrives at the coffin. He stops, looks down at \n               LAMPERT's body for a moment. Then, suddenly, in rapid \n               succession, he sneezes six times. He takes a small bottle \n               from his pocket, shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry.\n\n               He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to \n               sit. He comes face to face with GRANDPIERRE, stops, turns to \n               sit somewhere else.\n\n               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND SYLVIE\n\n                                     SYLVIE\n                         Do you know him?\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         I've never seen him before.\n\n                                     SYLVIE\n                         He must have known Charles pretty \n                         well.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         How can you tell?\n\n                                     SYLVIE\n                         He's allergic to him.\n\n               SYLVIE turns and glances at GIDEON. Again, the sound of the \n               DOOR opening interrupts them. They turn to look.\n\n               MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR\n\n               Again the figure of a MAN is outlined in silhouette against \n               the outside brightness. When he closes the door we can see \n               \"TEX\" PENTHOLLOW, a slim, rangy man with sandy-colored hair, \n               a weatherbeaten face, washed-out blue-eyes -- also in his \n               forties. He wears a velvet-corduroy suit, string tie and a \n               bright yellow flower in his lapel. A bulldurham tag hangs \n               from his outside breast pocket, dangling from its string.\n\n               He starts down the aisle toward the bier, CAMERA LEADING \n               him, and we notice his unsteady gait. He turns to look at \n               the others present.\n\n               TRAVELING SHOT -- TEX'S P.O.V.\n\n               MOVING down the aisle. GRANDPIERRE's face, then GIDEON's, \n               then REGGIE's and SYLVIE's -- all staring at CAMERA.\n\n               MED. SHOT -- THE BIER\n\n               As TEX arrives. He stands staring at LAMPERT's body, swaying \n               on his feet until he reaches out and grabs the side of the \n               coffin to steady himself. Then he takes the flower from his \n               lapel and throws it into the open box.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- TEX\n\n                                     TEX\n                              (heavy Texas accent)\n                         Ariva durchy, Charlie.\n\n               WIDER ANGLE\n\n               As TEX turns away from the coffin and approaches REGGIE and \n               SYLVIE, addressing the latter -- after having first reached \n               for his hat which he discovers he isn't wearing.\n\n                                     TEX\n                         Miz Lampert, ma'am...\n\n               SYLVIE points to REGGIE. Unruffled, TEX starts over. \n               addressing REGGIE this time.\n\n                                     TEX\n                         Miz Lampert, ma'am...\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         Yes?\n\n                                     TEX\n                         Charlie had no call to handling it \n                         this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         I don't understa--\n\n               But TEX has nodded his head and moved off to find a seat.\n\n               When he spots GIDEON, the two men stare at each other.\n\n               Finally, TEX chooses a seat away from him and sits.\n\n               MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR\n\n               It flies open, this time with a bang, and the large MAN who \n               appears almost fills the frame.\n\n               CLOSER SHOT -- TEX\n\n               As the loud noise awakens him with a snort, mid-snore.\n\n               MED. SHOT -- THE DOOR\n\n               Closing the door, we see HERMAN SCOBIE, a heavy-weight -- \n               tall and wide, but not fat -- with black hair combed straight \n               back and heavy bushy eyebrows of a matching color, which \n               meet over his nose and join up. About the same age as the \n               first two men, SCOBIE is dressed in a battered raincoat, his \n               hands thrust deep in the pockets. He marches down the aisle. \n               Looking straight ahead, CAMERA PANNING with him. He stops \n               before the coffin and stares into it.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE\n\n               As he stares down into the coffin, his tongue trying to \n               dislodge a bit of food caught in his teeth. He stares hard \n               at the body, squinting his eyes. Then he removes one hand \n               from his pocket, removes a pin from the inside of his lapel, \n               picks his teeth with it, then slowly lets the hand down, \n               into the coffin.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND\n\n               The pin held between thumb and forefinger, he jabs it slowly \n               but positively deep into the back of one of the dead man's \n               hands. There is no reaction.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE\n\n               He watches the dead man carefully, still squinting. Then \n               finally satisfied, he returns the pin to his lapel and walks \n               back up the aisle and out of the door, slamming it after \n               him.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE\n\n               Having watched SCOBIE exit. Suddenly a hand falls on her \n               shoulder. She jumps in alarm and utters a little cry of \n               fright.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               Featuring a funeral ATTENDANT, a cadaverous type (aren't \n               they all) with a black cut-away coat and an over-solicitous, \n               unctuous manner. He is eternally bent at the waist, in a \n               sort of half bow. He offers REGGIE a letter which she takes.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         Merci, Monsieur.\n\n                                     ATTENDANT\n                         Pas du tout, madame, pardon -- pardon -- \n                         pardon.\n\n               He backs off and is gone. REGGIE looks at the letter, back \n               and front, then starts to open it.\n\n                                     SYLVIE\n                         Who is it from?\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         The American Embassy.\n\n               She pulls out the letter and starts to read it.\n\n               INSERT -- THE LETTER\n\n               It bears the Great Seal as a letterhead and the typed message \n               reads:\n\n               \"Dear Mrs. Lampert: Please drop by my office tomorrow at \n               noon-thirty.

Come on -- avanti, \n                         avanti!\n\n               She rises and pulls him along.\n\n               WIDE ANGLE\n\n               Including the dance floor as most of the patrons go to it, \n               laughing self-consciously and looking around.\n\n                                     EMCEE\n                         \u00c9coutez bien -- les r\u00e8gles sont tres \n                         simples -- the rules are very easy -- \n                         deux \u00e9quipes -- two teams -- each \n                         with one orange -- une orange -- \n                         eine apfelsine -- un' arrancia -- \n                         held under the chin, like so --\n                              (does it)\n                         comme \u00e7a -- and passed to the player \n                         behind you -- sans vous servir de \n                         vos mains -- using nothing but the \n                         chin -- no hands -- and keeping the \n                         orange at all costs from touching \n                         the floor. Commencez, Mesdames et \n                         Messieurs -- begin, ladies and \n                         gentlemen -- signore e signori, \n                         comminciate!\n\n               The EMCEE now circulates, forming teams, telling the patrons \n               to line up, making sure there is a woman next to every man. \n               REGGIE and PETER are the second couple in their line.\n\n               Then the EMCEE picks up a basket of oranges and places one \n               under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each man \n               at the head of the line. Blowing a whistle, a signal for the \n               game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the women \n               behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under \n               their chins to under the chins of the women -- without using \n               their hands.\n\n               (This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one's \n               partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against \n               the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly \n               enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next \n               in line, where the process begins anew. However, the slightest \n               miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number of \n               human frailties -- haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of co-\n               ordination -- will surely result in losing control of the \n               orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can \n               only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide \n               from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on \n               the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrieve \n               it -- again, with the chin only. This latter is an activity \n               which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or even \n               new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only be \n               a torment for total strangers and/or the English).\n\n               VARIOUS SHOTS -- ORANGE GAME\n\n               Some of the couples in various states of confusion, \n               entanglement and intimacy -- all of them, naturally, \n               hilarious.\n\n               TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL\n\n               It is his turn to take the orange from a very short, but \n               quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress (held up by an \n               abundance of cantilever). PETER 'takes' when he sees the \n               twin obstacles which might -- and probably will -- encumber \n               the game but increase his worldly experience.\n\n               The contest begins: because of her stature he is forced to \n               move in low, making the ordinary embrace needed for success \n               difficult, if not impossible. Then, inexorably, the orange \n               starts to slip down the GIRL's front. Manfully he goes after \n               it.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE\n\n               She is enjoying it thoroughly.\n\n               TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL\n\n               Bending over backwards, in a sort of frontal half-nelson, \n               PETER makes a last valiant effort and voil\u00e0, grips the orange \n               under his chin -- amid much cheering and congratulations \n               from members of his TEAM.\n\n               Now he turns to REGGIE and they face one another for a moment.\n\n                                     PETER\n                         En garde.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         Lay on, MacDuff.\n\n               They go at it, working their bodies together to make it all \n               possible. Then, for a moment, the game and the onlookers \n               seem less important than their proximity. But, alas, they \n               are too good despite themselves and the transfer is \n               accomplished -- again with appreciative cheers from the TEAM.\n\n               REGGIE, with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin, \n               turns to the next team-member in line and is locked in an \n               embrace before she realizes her partner is LEOPOLD GIDEON, \n               the short, fat, balding man seen at the funeral and later in \n               BARTHOLOMEW's photo.\n\n               REGGIE starts to draw back but GIDEON holds her tightly.\n\n               Putting his chin around the orange he is able to speak quietly \n               in REGGIE's ear.\n\n               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND GIDEON\n\n               Her eyes show her fright as he whispers:\n\n                                     GIDEON\n                         Mrs. Lampert --\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         What do you want?\n\n                                     GIDEON\n                         Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         Tell me what?\n\n                                     GIDEON\n                         It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- \n                         you do know that, don't you?\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         I don't know anything.\n\n                                     GIDEON\n                         Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you \n                         could wake up dead.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         Leave me alone -- !\n\n                                     GIDEON\n                         Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's \n                         news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --\n\n                                     REGGIE (SHOUTING)\n                         Stop it!\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE'S AND GIDEON'S FEET\n\n               As REGGIE hauls off and kicks GIDEON full in the shin.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON\n\n               He stiffens as the pain registers. Instead of shouting he \n               merely closes his eyes.\n\n               WIDER ANGLE\n\n               Including REGGIE and GIDEON and PETER standing by, as well \n               as some spectators. PETER comes quickly forward.\n\n                                     PETER\n                         Reggie -- what's the trouble?\n\n               REGGIE realizes that GIDEON no longer offers any resistance.\n\n               She steps back, leaving GIDEON holding the orange, foolishly, \n               under his chin, his eyes still closed. REGGIE stares at him \n               for a moment.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         He -- he was stepping on my foot.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON\n\n               Slowly, his eyes open and tears stream from them, rolling \n               down his cheeks. He speaks while holding the orange.\n\n                                     GIDEON\n                         Forgive me -- it was quite \n                         unintentional, I'm sure.\n\n               WIDER ANGLE\n\n               GIDEON turns to the woman behind him and the game resumes.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                              (starting off)\n                         Wait for me -- I won't be long.\n\n               She goes off toward the rear of the club and starts down a \n               flight of stairs.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- PETER\n\n               Watching her go, a concerned look on his face.\n\n               INT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT\n\n               A small, dimly lit area with a door to the combination men's-\n               women's room and a 'phone cabin with a solid door.\n\n               The music and shouting from upstairs float down. REGGIE comes \n               down the stairs and goes to the 'phone, flicking on the light \n               and closing the door after her.\n\n               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT\n\n               REGGIE takes a jeton ('phone token) from her bag and drops \n               it in the slot. Then she takes out a slip of paper (the one \n               given her by BARTHOLOMEW) and dials the number written on \n               it. She listens to it ring, then evidently he answers.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                              (into 'phone)\n                         Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, Reggie \n                         Lampert -- listen Mr. Bartholomew: \n                         I've seen one of the\n                              (she stops)\n                         Mr. Bartholomew?

HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT\n\n               As REGGIE leaves the elevator, followed by PETER. They walk \n               to her door. There is a moment of silence as she looks at \n               him.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                              (imitating PETER)\n                         Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a \n                         nightcap, Reggie?'

REGGIE enters, then stops abruptly, the \n               doorknob still in her hand.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               The room has been torn apart. And standing in the center is \n               HERMAN SCOBIE, the large man in the battered raincoat.\n\n               He starts slowly advancing toward REGGIE.\n\n                                     SCOBIE\n                         Where is it, lady -- where've you \n                         got it?\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                              (terrified)\n                         I don't know -- I don't know! I don't --\n\n               She stops as she sees something.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND\n\n               Instead of a human hand there is a twin-pronged metal one.\n\n               WIDER ANGLE\n\n               SCOBIE sees where REGGIE is staring; looks down at it himself, \n               then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike.\n\n                                     SCOBIE\n                         I want it -- give it to me -- it's \n                         mine!\n\n               The hand is starting to come down. REGGIE, moving quickly, \n               turns and flies out.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                              (screaming)\n                         Peter -- ! Peter -- !\n\n               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT\n\n               As REGGIE runs out, slamming the door after her, the metal \n               hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and \n               splinters through it, visible on this side now. Petrified \n               with fear, REGGIE can only stare dumbly at the protruding \n               claw.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               As PETER comes running up to her. He sees the metal hand.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         A man -- he tried to kill me!\n\n               Pulling her aside, PETER takes hold of the key (still in the \n               outside lock) and turns it slowly and quietly. Then, using \n               all his weight, he slams the door open as far as it will go, \n               making sure to hold it that way as he steps in.\n\n               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n               Inside, PETER pulls back the door and slugs the startled \n               SCOBIE full on the jaw. His head bangs against the wall but \n               he manages to raise a foot and push PETER violently away, \n               sending him sprawling back, toppling across the bed and over, \n               head first, onto the floor on the other side, where he \n               disappears. Hurrying, SCOBIE puts his foot against the door \n               and pushes it away, ripping his metal hand free.\n\n               He then rushes to the open window and climbs out.\n\n               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT\n\n               REGGIE waits anxiously. When she hears nothing, she gingerly \n               looks into the room.\n\n               INT.

Where are you?\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               Showing the disarranged room, empty of people. Then, slowly \n               PETER's hand appears from behind the bed, shaking groggily.\n\n               REGGIE rushes to him and helps him sit on the bed.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         Peter -- are you all right?\n\n                                     PETER\n                         I think I sprained my pride.\n                              (He looks around)\n                         Where'd he go?\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't \n                         see him.\n\n               PETER goes, unsteady on his feet, to the window and looks \n               out. He then turns back.\n\n                                     PETER\n                         Lock the door and the window -- and \n                         don't let anyone in except me.

HOTEL WINDOW THIRD FLOOR -- NIGHT\n\n               Outside the window to REGGIE's room is a small, false balcony, \n               consisting mostly of railing, with barely enough room between \n               it and the building's facade for a man to stand. PETER appears \n               and looks down over the railing.\n\n               EXT. HOTEL SIDEWALK (FROM ABOVE) -- NIGHT\n\n               SHOOTING STRAIGHT DOWN; there is no one on the street and it \n               is too far to jump.\n\n               MED. SHOT -- PETER -- BALCONY\n\n               He now looks around. REGGIE's is the last such balcony on \n               one side, but there are two or three on the other.\n\n               PETER climbs over the railing and, holding on to it with one \n               hand, reaches for the railing on the next balcony.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- PETER'S HAND\n\n               As it stretches for the railing; it is several inches short \n               of touching it.\n\n               MED. SHOT -- PETER\n\n               As he straightens up and prepares to jump.\n\n               EXT. HOTEL FACADE -- NIGHT\n\n               From the GROUND.

HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT\n\n               As PETER (now called DYLE) leaves REGGIE's room and closes \n               the door. He pauses for a moment, listening, hears nothing, \n               then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one \n               of his socks. As usual, the thread unravels -- and unravels -- \n               and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock \n               has come unknit. Now, taking the long thread, he bends down \n               near the door and, taking his tie-pin, attaches one end of \n               the thread to the bottom of REGGIE's door. He then runs the \n               thread along the floor to his door (next door) and works it \n               underneath.\n\n               INT.

She stops as she \n               notices the connecting door leading to the room next door, \n               DYLE's room.

Looking once more over her shoulder \n               she takes a bill out of her pocket, opens the cab door, slams \n               it loudly without getting in and hands the bill to the driver.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         N'importe o\u00f9 -- vite!

At the same time DYLE runs out of the hotel.  \n               Another TAXI is coming down the street.

HOTEL (PLACE ST. ANDR\u00c9 DES ARTS) -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               DYLE leaves the hotel and turns into the Place. A moment \n               later, REGGIE comes cautiously from the hotel. As she watches \n               DYLE, a SANDWICH-MAN advertising a driving school passes the \n               hotel. REGGIE falls in behind him, his tall placard hiding \n               her from view.\n\n               EXT. PLACE ST. ANDR\u00c9 DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               First comes DYLE, passing a sidewalk cafe on the corner, \n               then the SANDWICH-MAN and REGGIE. The SANDWICH-MAN turns \n               off, leaving REGGIE out in the open. A moment later, DYLE \n               passes a GIRL painting a canvas, her easel set up in the \n               middle of the sidewalk. He stops when he has passed her and \n               turns to look at her work. REGGIE, not knowing what to do, \n               and afraid she will be seen by DYLE, who is now looking her \n               way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, \n               her back to DYLE. It is already occupied by a middle-aged \n               TOURIST.\n\n               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST\n\n               The TOURIST, complete with camera, beret and guide book, \n               looks up from his coffee, surprised. He stares at REGGIE and \n               she stares back. Finally, not knowing what else to do, she \n               smiles, then takes a portion of his brioche and eats it.\n\n               He smiles back emptily, not knowing what to make of her.\n\n               REGGIE turns to look at DYLE.\n\n               MED. SHOT -- DYLE\n\n               He has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on.\n\n               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST\n\n               The TOURIST has finally found the courage to speak. As he \n               opens his mouth to make a sound, REGGIE, her eyes on DYLE, \n               rises quickly from the table and goes, leaving a very confused \n               TOURIST with his mouth open. He blinks, then leaves some \n               money on the table and starts after her.\n\n               EXT. PLACE ST. ANDR\u00c9 DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               REGGIE following DYLE. As she passes the GIRL painting, she \n               cannot resist turning to see the work.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- PAINTING\n\n               An abstract jumble, nothing recognizable.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE\n\n               As she looks from the painting to reality.\n\n               EXT. PLACE ST. ANDR\u00c9 DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               As the scene really looks.\n\n               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE\n\n               She shrugs, continues after DYLE. Now we see that the TOURIST, \n               in turn, is following her.\n\n                                     TOURIST\n                              (calling)\n                         Fraulein --\n\n               REGGIE doesn't stop.\n\n                                     TOURIST\n                         Fraulein --\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                              (turning but continuing)\n                         What are you doing, following me? \n                         Stop it -- we're going to look like \n                         a parade.\n\n               She continues after DYLE. The TOURIST hesitates, then \n               continues after her.\n\n               MED. SHOT -- DYLE\n\n               He goes to the curb and starts to step off, attempting to \n               cross the Rue Danton, but finds the light against him. He \n               turns back in REGGIE's direction.\n\n               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE\n\n               Realizing she has to do something before DYLE spots her, she \n               turns and takes the TOURIST's arm and starts walking with \n               him back toward the cafe.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                              (smiling and rattling \n                              on)\n                         How are you? When did you arrive in \n                         town? Are you enjoying Paris? It's \n                         lovely, isn't it? So many wonderful \n                         things to see and do, it makes one's \n                         head spin to think of it.\n\n               She looks back over her shoulder and sees that DYLE is now \n               crossing the Rue Danton, heading for the platform of a bus \n               now stopped at the curb.\n\n                                     TOURIST\n                              (smiling)\n                         Fraulein --\n\n               REGGIE pulls away from him.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         If you don't stop following me I'll \n                         call the police.\n\n               She leaves him standing there, more confused than ever, as \n               she starts after DYLE again.\n\n               DYLE has hopped on the back of the bus as it pulls away.\n\n               REGGIE hurries across the street, hailing a taxi.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         Taxi -- !\n\n               INT.

AMERICAN EXPRESS -- DAY\n\n               DYLE and SCOBIE stand together, waiting for the elevator, \n               SCOBIE clearly holding a gun in the pocket of his raincoat.\n\n                                     SCOBIE\n                              (quietly)\n                         If you do anything funny, or try to \n                         talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- \n                         here and now.

A young GIRL starts in \n               after them.\n\n                                     SCOBIE\n                         Next car, please.\n\n               He reaches out and presses the top button with his metal \n               hand.

SCOBIE looks \n               around -- there is an open door at the end of a short hall. \n               He and DYLE go to it, CAMERA FOLLOWING. Through the door, \n               which SCOBIE closes behind them, is a flight of stairs, \n               leading up to a second floor.\n\n                                     SCOBIE\n                         Okay -- turn around.\n\n               DYLE turns to find SCOBIE's gun out of the pocket and pointing \n               at him. SCOBIE now transfers it to his metal hand and goes \n               to DYLE, where he proceeds to frisk him.\n\n               Finding the gun DYLE carries in his inside coat pocket, SCOBIE \n               removes it. During the following conversation he will shake \n               open the revolving magazine and let the bullets fall out \n               onto the floor before handing back the emptied gun to DYLE.  \n               Then he will transfer his own gun back to his good hand.\n\n                                     SCOBIE\n                         Sit down.\n\n               Shrugging, DYLE sits on the third step.\n\n                                     DYLE\n                         What now?\n\n                                     SCOBIE\n                         We wait -- with our mouths shut.\n\n               INT.

AMERICAN EXPRESS -- ROOFTOP -- NIGHT\n\n               A spectacular view of the Paris rooftops and the city lights \n               beyond. DYLE and SCOBIE come out onto a level portion of \n               roof. On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into \n               a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely \n               separated oval-shaped dormer windows.\n\n               Below these is a rain gutter, then nothing -- for seven \n               stories.\n\n                                     DYLE\n                         Very pretty.

Where's \n                         the money?\n\n                                     DYLE\n                         Is that why you dragged me all the \n                         way up here -- to ask me that?

Working his arms between their two bodies, DYLE \n               suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold \n               is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his \n               back as SCOBIE's metal claw rips through both, a wound \n               extending from the center of DYLE's back to his shoulder.\n\n               Both men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously and \n               leap for it, both landing short of the mark. Now they grapple \n               with one another, each trying to break free and reach for \n               the gun.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- THEIR HANDS\n\n               Two hands, one real, one metal, inch toward the gun.\n\n               MED. SHOT -- DYLE AND SCOBIE\n\n               The battle is going to SCOBIE whose weight and strength are \n               beginning to tire DYLE, who is now on his back, trying to \n               stop SCOBIE from crawling over him. He has the large man by \n               both lapels of the raincoat in a last-ditch effort to hold \n               him. But SCOBIE, his face horribly distorted from the strain, \n               continues to inch forward toward the gun.\n\n               Suddenly, DYLE releases his hold. With nothing restraining \n               him, SCOBIE lurches forward, tumbling past the gun, his \n               momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof, \n               where he begins sliding down. SCOBIE beats wildly at the the \n               slate with his claw, trying to gouge a grip.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S CLAW\n\n               As it slides across the slate, making a hideous scratching \n               sound and causing sparks to fly.\n\n               MED. SHOT -- SCOBIE\n\n               As he slides over the edge and disappears.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- DYLE\n\n               As he watches, hypnotized.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- ROOF EDGE\n\n               There appears to be no sign of SCOBIE. Then CAMERA ZOOMS IN \n               FOR A TIGHT CLOSE SHOT OF SCOBIE'S metal hand, gripping the \n               rain gutter at the very edge.\n\n               MED. SHOT -- DYLE\n\n               Having seen the claw, he rises and walks to the very edge of \n               the level part of the roof.\n\n                                     DYLE\n                         Herman?\n\n               MED. SHOT -- SCOBIE\n\n               As he hangs, seven stories over the street, by his metal \n               hand.\n\n                                     SCOBIE\n                         Yeah?\n\n               MED.

DYLE leaves the elevator and goes to his own \n               door. The MANAGER eyes him coldly. DYLE \"takes\" the look.\n\n                                     DYLE\n                         I didn't do it.\n\n                                     MANAGER\n                         The next time madame forgets her \n                         key, there is another one at the \n                         desk.\n\n               DYLE smiles, then enters his room.\n\n               INT.

He opens the door and enters.\n\n               INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT\n\n               GIDEON closes the sliding grill and presses a button. The \n               cage starts down. GIDEON begins sneezing. Suddenly the \n               elevator stops between floors and the lights go out.\n\n                                     GIDEON\n                         Hey!

GIDEON shakes his head and leans back, \n               whistling again. The cage comes to his floor and starts past \n               it. Seeing this, GIDEON looks confused.\n\n               INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT\n\n               The NIGHT PORTER is asleep behind the desk. The elevator, \n               GIDEON inside, keeps coming down. It passes the lobby level \n               and keeps right on going, toward the basement.\n\n                                     GIDEON\n                         Hey! How do you stop this thing?\n\n               The elevator passes out of sight, still going down. There is \n               a silence as the motor stops, and then a series of sneezes \n               that ends with a terrifying shriek. The NIGHT PORTER, rudely \n               awakened, runs to the elevator shaft, his shoes squeaking \n               horribly. He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down. He \n               presses the call button and the motor starts.\n\n               An instant later the cage appears and stops. The NIGHT PORTER \n               opens the gate, pulls back the grill and the CAMERA RUSHES \n               PAST him to pick up GIDEON. His body is sitting on the floor \n               of the cage, its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a \n               puppet's with its strings cut. Except that GIDEON has no \n               strings to cut -- only a throat. From ear to ear.\n\n               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT\n\n               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE.

She stops, sees the M\u00e9tro \n               station (\"St. Michel\") and rushes to it, scampering down the \n               stairs. ADAM is behind her.\n\n               INT. ST. MICHEL M\u00c9TRO STATION -- NIGHT\n\n               REGGIE comes flying down the stairs and runs past the ticket \n               booth, fishing in her bag for her carnet (booklet of tickets), \n               casting a quick look behind her.

Barely \n               stopping, she holds out her ticket to the GUARD to be punched, \n               then heads down the platform, still running. ADAM gets to \n               the gate but the GUARD stops him as he tries to pass through.\n\n                                     GUARD\n                         Billet, Monsieur.\n\n                                     ADAM\n                              (breathless)\n                         I don't want to go anywhere -- I'm \n                         only trying --\n\n                                     GUARD\n                              (pointing off)\n                         Billet, Monsieur.\n\n               ADAM tries to look past him, to see REGGIE, but gives it up \n               and goes back toward the ticket booth, on the run.\n\n               INT. M\u00c9TRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT\n\n               CAMERA LEADING REGGIE as she runs -- the passageway is nearly \n               empty.

M\u00c9TRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT\n\n               REGGIE starts down the platform, looking behind her every \n               few steps.  Suddenly she looks up in surprise -- there, across \n               the tracks on the opposite platform is ADAM.  He has evidently \n               made the wrong turn back in the passageway.\n\n               They stare at each other for a moment.  Then the bell rings, \n               announcing the arrival of a train. ADAM turns, running back \n               through the exit behind him. Not knowing what to do, REGGIE \n               looks into the darkness of the tunnel. The approaching train \n               can be heard.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                              (to herself)\n                         Come on -- please --\n\n               She turns to look at the gate -- slowly, the pneumatic door \n               starts to close. As it does, the train roars into the station.\n\n               INT. M\u00c9TRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT\n\n               The gate can be seen slowly closing. ADAM runs to it, tries \n               to force it back but cannot. Finally, he jumps up and, \n               commando style, vaults over it.\n\n               INT. M\u00c9TRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT\n\n               REGGIE is just entering the red center car (the two on either \n               side are dark green). ADAM runs for the red car and just \n               manages to make it as the doors shut in unison, the latches \n               falling with a concerted click and the little whistle blowing \n               to inform the motor-man to depart. The train starts to move.\n\n               INT.

ADAM turns to see a TRAIN GUARD.\n\n                                     TRAIN GUARD\n                         Billet, Monsieur.\n\n               ADAM shows him his yellow ticket and starts past him, but \n               again the TRAIN GUARD stops him.\n\n                                     TRAIN GUARD\n                         Vous \u00eates dans le premier classe, \n                         Monsieur.\n\n                                     ADAM\n                         What?\n\n                                     TRAIN GUARD\n                              (heavy accent)\n                         This car is for first class only -- \n                         you have a second-class ticket.\n\n                                     ADAM\n                         But that's what they gave me.\n\n               He tries to pull away from the TRAIN GUARD and finds himself \n               staring into the serious face of a GENDARME.\n\n                                     GENDARME\n                         Monsieur -- ?\n\n               ADAM looks at the GENDARME, then at REGGIE.\n\n               INT. \"PALAIS-ROYAL\" M\u00c9TRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT\n\n               As the TRAIN pulls in and comes to a stop.\n\n               INT.

But as she \n               reaches the stairway leading up to the street level, she is \n               confronted with an iron grill barring her way. She tries to \n               open it, but it is firmly padlocked. A sign hung on it reads \n               \"FERM\u00c9 LES WEEKENDS.\" She turns, desperately looking for \n               some way out.\n\n               INT. M\u00c9TRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT\n\n               ADAM is off the train. He stands on the platform as the train \n               doors slam shut, the latches click, the whistle blows and \n               the train pulls out. He looks around in all directions, \n               looking for some sign of REGGIE. He spots the exit marked \n               \"SORTIE\" (the same one used by REGGIE) and starts toward it.\n\n               INT.

He \n               manages to grab her foot as he falls forward, but all he \n               winds up with is a shoe which has come loose in his hand.\n\n               REGGIE shrieks, then regaining her balance, continues running, \n               limping in her one shoe.

ADAM is gaining on her \n               again.\n\n               EXT.

The only person in sight is the man \n               we have known as BARTHOLOMEW, waiting at the far end of the \n               columns, looking at his watch impatiently.\n\n               Then, from the Rue de Valois side of the Palais, REGGIE runs \n               into the court. She spots \"BARTHOLOMEW\" and fishes in her \n               bag for the stamps as she runs, taking them out and waving \n               them.\n\n                                     REGGIE\n                         Mr. Bartholomew -- he's chasing me!\n\n               ADAM has run into the court and now skids to a stop at the \n               near end of the colonnade as he spots \"BARTHOLOMEW.\" REGGIE, \n               still running, is halfway between the two men. \"BARTHOLOMEW\" \n               draws his gun but can't get a shot at ADAM, who has ducked \n               in among the columns.\n\n                                     ADAM\n                         Reggie -- stop!

Terminate\n               us instantly.

Unfair to me.\n\nHe begins to overpower her. This is quickly turning into date rape. SHE \nSTARTS TO FIGHT BACK BUT HE DOESN'T STOP. FINALLY, SHE SCRATCHES him \nsavagely across the face. This catches his attention. He jumps back, cut \nslightly, surprised.\n\nShe opens the car door and quickly escapes.\n\nEXT.  ROAD\n\nShe runs away from the car, down the road, very upset.\n\nINT.

CAR\n\nRod, frustrated, hits the steering wheel and floors it.\n\nEXT.  ROAD\n\nAs Rod's car tears off, down the road, the other car that was parked at \nlover's lane drives up and pulls over, lights still off.\n\nEXT. WOODS\n\nStacy heads deeper into the woods. When she finally stops to catch her \nbreath and wipe away her tears, she hears someone approaching her. \nSuddenly, the footsteps stop. Stacy senses that someone is watching her.\n\n                  STACY\n                Rod?\n\nNo answer.\n\n                 STACY\n               Is that you Rod?\n\nStill no answer. A little frightened, she starts to walk again.  Again she \nhears the footsteps following her. She stops again. Whoever is out there \nstops too. She looks around in every direction.\n\n                 STACY\n               Come out Rod.\n               This SCREAM bull shit ain't\n               gonna work with me!\n\nNo answer.

I lose.\n              Come out and we'll fuck.\n\nShe hears the footsteps behind her and quickly turns around. She sees the \nsilhouette of someone standing a few feet away.\n\nThe wind picks up. Stacy realizes it isn't Rod. All she can see is that \nwhoever is there is carrying a small sledge hammer in one hand and a very \nlong, jagged, steel nail in the other.\n\n                  STACY\n               (in full panic)\n              NO!\n\nStacy starts to run.

Stacy falls to the ground, dazed.\n\nINT.  CAR\n\nRod sits up in his seat, thinking he's heard something\n\nEXT.  WOODS\n\nStacy, half conscious, bleeding from the head, is dragged back deeper into \nthe woods.\n\nEXT.  STACY'S\n\nRod gets out of the car and cautiously moves to the edge of the dark \nwoods.\n\nEXT.  WOODS\n\nRod's POV - The woods are pitch black.\n\n                   ROD\n              Stacy?\n\n                  STACY(O.C.)\n            (struggling, in the distance)\n            ROD!\n\nEXT.  WOODS\n\nThe killer kicks Stacy in the side, instantly shutting her up. He gags her \nand ties her to a tree trunk. She struggles, but she's no match for the \nkiller.\n\nINT.  CAR\n\nRod grabs his flashlight from the glove compartment.\n\nEXT.  WOODS\n\nRod's flashlight beam frantically cuts through the woods.\n\nRod charges through the woods, desperately looking for any sign of Stacy.\n\nEXT.

WOODS\n\nThe hammer descends on the nail.\n\nStacy screams out in pain, even through the gag, as he hand is nailed to \nthe tree.\n\nEXT.  WOODS\n\nRod hears her muffled cry and runs toward the sound.\n\nStacy's left hand is now placed up against a different tree.\n\nAnother nail is readied.\n\nStacy tries to free her nailed hand but it's useless. She goes into shock.\n\nRod's flashlight continues to cut through the night. His feet trample \nfallen branches. Suddenly, he stops. He's found her.\n\nStacy is stretched out between two trees, gagged, one hand nailed to each \ntree. She almost looks crucified.\n\nRod, starts toward her, not sure what to do. He looks into Stacy's \nterrified eyes. She's looking behind him.\n\nRod quickly turns around but he's too late.\n\nA knife comes plunging down toward Rod's chest.\n\nStacy frantically tries to free herself but she only succeeds in ripping \nher palms on the nails.\n\nRod falls to his knees, blood streaming from his chest and mouth.\n\nStacy can't even react anymore, she's so horrified.\n\nThe killer's hand rips open Stacy's shirt and feels her soft ripe stomach.\n\nStacy looks down, terrified of what the killer has planned.\n\nA small but extremely sharp razor attached to the end of a pencil is \nplaced up against Stacy's bare stomach. The killer's hand grips it like \nit's an ordinary pencil.\n\nStacy's eyes grow abnormally wide as the carving starts. She's never \nexperienced such pain.\n\nBlood drips to the ground.\n\nDissolve to:\n\nEXT.  NIGHT SKY\n\nThe full moon looks down on the town.\n\nEXT.  CUL DE SAC\n\nAnother romantic turn off.

Kenny is also sixteen. He's thin and a bit shaggy, but very cute \nnonetheless. His hair is shoulder length, his stare intense. He takes \nhimself seriously, all rebel.\n\n                  JODY\n              Cut it out.\n\n                  KENNY\n              Why?\n\n                  JODY\n              I was supposed to be home\n              fifteen minutes ago.\n\n                  KENNY\n              So? You're already late.\n              A few more minutes won't\n              matter.\n\nHe slides a second finger into her pants.

He stares at her for a second, \ncompletely exasperated. He sits up and starts the car.\n\nEXT.   CUL DE SAC\n\nThe car squeals away.\n\nINT.   CAR\n\nJody and Kenny drive home, not talking.\n\nHe pulls up in front of her house.\n\n                  KENNY          \n            You know, maybe we ought to\n            start seeing other people.\n\n                  JODY\n            What?\n\n                  KENNY\n            Jody, we've been going out\n            for over a year. I love you\n            but I'm all out of patience.\n\nJody doesn't know what to say. She didn't expect this.\n\nEXT.  MARKEN HOUSE\n\nJody gets out of the car, very upset. Kenny takes off, not even waiting to \nsee if she gets inside safely, leaving her all alone on the dark street. A \ncar backfires in the distance. A nearby noise  startles her. Something's \nbehind the garbage cans. She heads quickly up the driveway, disappearing \nbehind the house.\n\nINT.  MARKEN'S HOUSE - BACK FOYER\n\nAll is quiet in the house. The back door opens. Jody tiptoes up back \nstaircase.\n\nINT.  MARKEN'S HOUSE\n\nJody appears on the second floor. It's a family house, politely decorated \nand immaculately clean.

JODY'S BEDROOM \n\nJody creeps into her bedroom and quietly shuts the door. She's made it. \nShe sits on the bed to catch her breath.\n\nSomething moves in the corner of her room.

Jody is furious. She lies down on the bed to stew. She might at \nwell have stayed out. The phone in the hallway rings. She leaps up.\n\nINT.  HALLWAY\n\nJody runs up to the phone but waits for it to ring a second time before \npicking it up. She crosses her fingers, praying it's Kenny.\n\n                 JODY\n            Hello.

Marge is a couple of years older than Brent.

Police cameras flash. Stacy is still nailed to the tree. \nRod is dead on the ground below her in a puddle of his own blood.\n\nBrent walks up, immediately repulsed by the gruesome sight.

Brent pulls out his \nflashlight to better survey the carnage.\n\nHe starts on Rod, throat slit, chest gutted. He then moves to Stacy, \nlooking at one nailed hand, then the other.\n\n                  BRENT\n           What kind of a person wakes\n           up in the morning and says\n           to themselves, 'Think I'll nail\n           a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?\n\n                  DEPUTY\n           The same type that decides to carve into\n           her stomach.\n\nBrent finally shines the flashlight beam on Stacy's stomach. Carved into \nher flesh is the word 'VIRGIN'.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nMONTAGE\n\nHigh school kids are getting ready for school.\n\nBody parts are being covered.

Then he must be a virgin.\n\nJody nudges Sandy under the table, trying to prompt her to say something. \nSandy can only stare at Mark as he eats.\n\n                   CINDY(O.C.)\n              If I'm so all-used-up Ben,\n              why do you try to hook me\n              up non-stop?\n\n                  BEN(O.C.)\n              As fucking if.\n\nAcross the cafeteria, a sophomore ANNETTE storms in very upset.

She screams and \nkicks with all her might, freeing herself, her momentum sending her \nrolling down the roof. She rolls off the roof, barely grabbing hold of the \ngutter, hanging from it.\n\nThe gutter starts to break.\n\nAbove her she can hear the killer coming out onto the roof.\n\nThe killer's silhouette hovers above, ready to grab her.\n\nJody knows she has no choice.\n\nJody lets go of the gutter.\n\nEXT.

There's a sexual electricity \neverywhere mixed in with a lot of fear.\n\nThe normal tribes are disbanding. What are forming in their place are \nsexual tribes.

HIGH SCHOOL\n\nAs Jody approaches the high school, she's still on the edge, given the \nattack of the night before as well as he dad's reaction to the picture. \nShe hears a moan coming from behind some bushes. She stops and notices a \nGirl's shoe sticking out from under the bush. Worried it might be someone \nbadly hurt, she cautiously starts toward it. Suddenly a couple of more \nfeet pop out. Jody jumps back, frightened, but then realizes that it's \njust a  couple of her classmates having sex in the bushes.\n\nJody heads toward the main school entrance.

Everyone's excited.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. STREET\n\nJody rides down the street, just pedaling fast, as fast as she can.\nShe's in her own world, very upset.\n\nA car comes toward the intersection on the other street but doesn't slow \ndown, knowing the light is about to change.\n\nA boy in a passing car whistles at Jody, waking her out of her stupor.  \nJody looks up just as the light turns red. She hits her brakes and skids \ninto the tail of the oncoming car. She glances off it and goes sliding off \nthe road, into a few garbage cans.\n\nThe car nicks another car and pulls over.\n\nAcross the street, we see that the Killer's IMPERIAL is stopped at the red \nlight.\n\nJody gets up, shaken. He knees and elbows are badly scratched.\n\nThe OWNER of the car comes running over to Jody.\n\n                 OWNER\n            Are you O.K.?\n\n                  JODY\n            I'm ok.\n\n                 CAR OWNER\n            Are you sure?\n\n                   JODY\n            Yes.\n\n                  LEONARD(O.C.)\n           You don't look OK.\n\nJody turns around.

For your own\n            safety.\n\nJody doesn't know what to make of this. It's not what she expected to hear \nfrom her teacher.\n\nLeonard goes into the kitchen. Jody sits on the couch and looks around. \nShe's immediately sensing that something is off about the place. It's \ncertainly not the way she imagined a teacher's house to look. It has all \nsorts of city plans, maps, and drawings on the walls. Years of Cherry \nFalls yearbooks and newspapers are stacked in piles.\n\nHe reappears with two beers and a pot filled with soapy water. He hands \nher a beer.\n\n                  JODY\n            I just feel so manipulated.\n            By everyone. My dad, my boyfriend,\n            and now some psychopath I don't\n            even know.\n\nSHE TAKES THE BEER, surprised he's giving her alcohol. He kneels down in \nfront of her and begins to clean the wound on her leg.\n\n                  LEONARD\n            We're all manipulated. From the moment\n            we're born.

We have no real freedom.\n            You of all people should understand\n            that. This may sting.\n\nJody is beginning to feel strange.

Why me?\n\n                  LEONARD\n             Because of your father.\n            The way what his sins shaped you.\n\nHe starts putting a disinfectant on her wound.\n\n                  JODY\n            What do you know about my father?\n\n                  LEONARD\n            He's a rapist.

I've planned this since I was\n           a very little boy. You have no real freedom\n           either. Your father has cast a shadow that\n           you've never eluded.\n\nJody gets up and starts backing away from him but he gets up quickly. He's \nnot letting her get away.\n\nJody bolts for the door but she doesn't have time to open it.\n\nLeonard grabs her and throws her across the room.\n\nJody smashes into a  table. He bends down to pick her up, but she pulls a \nbook case over on him, narrowly escaping.\n\nShe runs for the back door.\n\nINT.  BACK DOOR\n\nJody opens the back door and gets halfway out when Leonard runs up to her, \npulls her away from the door, and slugs her in the face, sending her \nsprawling to the ground. He picks her up and punches her a second time, \nbreaking her nose, knocking her half out. He picks her up by the waist and \ncarries her to the basement stairs.\n\nINT.

She tumbles down the \nstairs, hitting her head on the cold stone floor.\n\nHe comes charging down after her, closing the door behind them.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT.  PARTY HOUSE\n\nThe CD is now skipping.

He \nthrows it down the stairs and turns the lights on.\n\nThe basement is almost an exact replication of the basement in his \nmother's house. A cot in the same spot. The dresser as well. The Lisa \nSherman costume is neatly hung from big metal hooks.\n\nLeonard sits Jody back up.\n\nA little blood drips from Jody's closed hands. She has the shard.\n\nLeonard ties the other body to a chair facing Jody.

Did people really call her a slut\n           and tell her 'you can't shit here'? She used to\n           snarl that at me. That's all she really did, at least\n           in my direction, was snarl. When she looked at me, \n           she saw only you.\n\nJody gags in pain. Brent looks away.\n\n                   LEONARD\n            Open your eyes Brent. Watch. Or\n            will I cause her much more pain.\n\nBrent opens his eyes. More blood drips. Jody starts to lose consciousness, \nbarely able to stand it \nanymore. The doorbell rings.

Couples are everywhere. \nThere's no room\nto even walk.\n\nThe party has reached it's 'climax'.\n\nWe see the faces of teenage boys and girls as they lose their virginity. \nThey run the gamut of emotions.

He \nputs Jody down and starts unbuttoning her shirt.\n\n                      JODY\n                    (whispering)\n                 What are you doing?\n\n                      KENNY\n                 Pretend we're just another couple.\n\nHe pulls her under the sheet.\n\nINT.

Meanwhile, in town, teenager Jody Marken (Brittany Murphy), the daughter of the local sheriff, is with her boyfriend, Kenny (Gabriel Mann), who thinks it is time to go \"see other people.\" Jody goes back home to find her father, Brent (Michael Biehn), upset that she is out past her curfew. Brent and his deputies begin to investigate the murders the next day. They see that the killer carved the word \"virgin\" into both victims. At school, Brent sees English teacher Mr. Marliston (Jay Mohr), who urges him to divulge more details of the murder to students and the town so as to eliminate the possibility of secrets.\nAnnette Duwald, also a virgin, is killed in the same fashion of the last night's events. Concerned for the town's safety, Brent holds a meeting at the high school to tell parents the nature of the crimes. No students are invited, but Jody and her friend Timmy, who stayed after school, witness the meeting. Timmy asks to borrow Jody's cell phone, and goes into the stairwell to make a call. Jody goes downstairs to find him, and discovers his dead body in a locker room. She is confronted by the killer who attacks her, but she manages to escape. At the police station, Jody describes the killer to an officer, who draws a composite. Brent confides with an old friend, Tom Sisler, (the current high school principal) that the suspect looks like \"Lora Lee Sherman.\" The two are both visibly nervous, and Jody listens in on their conversation.\nLater at school, Jody and Kenny reconcile, and later Jody learns from her mother about the tale of Lora Lee. Twenty-five years ago, Lora Lee was a high school loner. She claimed that four popular boys at school, including Brent and the high school principal, raped her one night. Her cries fell on deaf ears and she left the city for the rural outskirts, where she was rarely seen or heard from again. After Jody discovers the truth, disappointed with the hypocrisy of her parents, she visits Kenny at his house. They talk, and Jody being upset with her parents, tries to pressure sex on Kenny. He refuses, pushing her away.\nAfter catching new of the killer's targeting of virgins, the high school students in town congregate at an abandoned hunting lodge to indulge in a mass orgy. Brent goes to the school to meet Sisler only to find the principal dead in his office with the words \"virgin not\" carved into his forehead. Before Brent can react he is knocked out by the killer. Jody, who has refused to attend the orgy with Kenny, is out riding her bike when she cycles by Mr. Marliston's house and witnesses him dragging a heavy trunk inside. Suspicious, Jody sneaks into the house and opens the trunk. She recoils as she finds the beaten and bloody body of her unconscious father inside, before she too is knocked unconscious. At the orgy, Kenny is about to have sex with a girl when he has second thoughts and leaves to find Jody. He drives around trying to find her but is puzzled to see her bicycle outside of Marliston's house.\nDownstairs in his house, Marliston puts on a wig and makeup to \"become\" Lora Lee Sherman. Marliston reveals that he is Lora Lee Sherman's illegitimate son, and asks Brent to retell the story of what happened that night 25 years ago. Brent reveals that the four boys, including himself, did indeed rape Lora Lee. Marliston says his mother became an abusive \"psycho\" after the rape and that one of the rapists is his father; there is an implication that Brent is in fact Marliston's biological father. By frightening virgins, Marliston anticipated a large high school orgy, which would thereby rob all the wealthy parents of their precious children's virginity.\nKenny enters the house and frees Jody as Brent fights with Marliston, who manages to brutally kill him. Jody and Kenny flee to the orgy with Marliston in furious pursuit, killing a deputy en route. He bursts inside wielding an axe and mass panic erupts. After wildly stabbing panicking students and then trying to escape, Marliston fights both Jody and Kenny, with Kenny being severely wounded during the melee. Eventually, Marliston is pushed off a balcony by Jody and impaled on fence posts. At first he seems to be dead, before reviving briefly only to be promptly shot dead by Deputy Mina, who unloads two pistols into him. The next day, Jody and her mother head away from the police station. As they leave, Jody sees someone resembling Lora Lee Sherman disappear behind a moving bus. The film ends with a shot of the waterfalls outside town turning red."}

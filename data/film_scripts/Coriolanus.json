Checks she is not being followed.\r\n          She is TAMORA, an extreme figure on the political landscape.\r\n          To the Roman elite she is a dangerous anarchist -- to her\r\n          supporters she is an ardent patriot and democrat.\r\n          As she moves, we take in Rome.\r\n          It might be Mexico City. Or Chechnia. Or El Salvador. Or\r\n          Detroit. Or Baghdad. Or London.\r\n          This Rome is a modern place. It is our world right now:\r\n          immediately recognizable to us. Elements of classical\r\n          architecture loom over decay. Monolithic modernism and brave\r\n          public monuments are lost in a sea of brazen advertising\r\n          billboards, neon shopping plazas and drab super-highways.\r\n          Splendor and squalor sit side-by-side.\r\n          It is a volatile, dangerous world.\r\n          William Shakespeare's Rome.\r\n          She comes to a graffiti-covered apartment building.

Men and women\r\n          gathered, hushed and urgent tones. A cell meeting of the\r\n          political opposition, the resistance.\r\n          A TV shows the food marches elsewhere in the city.

(Soon to be given the honorary title\r\n          Coriolanus.) He is intense and patrician. Uncompromising. A\r\n          man of steel. A soldier.

Some in the crowd film with cell phone cameras.\r\n          Streaming video. We intercut some of these perspectives.\r\n\r\n                         MARTIUS\r\n          What would you have, you curs?\r\n          He that trusts to you,\r\n          Where he should find you lions, finds you\r\n\r\n                         HARES;\r\n          Where foxes, geese.\r\n          He walks along the front of the crowd. Some are frightened by\r\n          the great Martius. Some are even awed. Others glare at him\r\n          with loathing.\r\n\r\n                         MARTIUS\r\n          Who deserves greatness\r\n          Deserves your hate...\r\n          Hang ye!

Stares down at them.\r\n\r\n                         AN ULTIMATUM:\r\n\r\n                         MARTIUS\r\n          Go GET YOU HOME, YOU FRAGMENTS!\r\n          A tense beat.\r\n          The riot police shift nervously.\r\n          The crowd is unsure.\r\n          The TV news crew films everything.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          8.\r\n          Cassius looks around.

He doesn't\r\n          want this to explode.\r\n          He exchanges a few whispers works with Tamora. Word is passed\r\n          and the crowd begins to disperse. Some run off in a panic.\r\n          Others walk away.\r\n          The danger has passed.\r\n          Senator Menenius, who has been watching from nearby, gestures\r\n          for Martius to join him.

Catching the light perfectly, almost\r\n          iridescent.\r\n          It floats before a palatial mansion in the suburbs of the\r\n          great city. Manicured lawns. Formal gardens. Classical\r\n          architectural lines.\r\n          This fine home of aristocratic privilege seems a world away\r\n          from the urban blight of Rome.\r\n          In the immaculate front gardens YOUNG MARTIUS, Martius' son,\r\n          is playing. The boy is about ten. There is something grim and\r\n          lonely about him, without charm.\r\n          Young Martius chases after the butterfly, trying to catch it.\r\n          He fails. The butterfly flits away. Young Martius leaps after\r\n          it. Again he misses.\r\n          Finally the frustrated boy manages to catch the butterfly.

Young Martius is unmoved. He glances up.\r\n          Locks eyes with his mother.\r\n          She turns away.\r\n          Virgilia was well-chosen for her role as wife to one of\r\n          Rome's most aristocratic men. She is beautiful and graceful\r\n          but -- like Diana thrown into lion's den of the Windsor\r\n          family -- woefully out of her depth. We feel an inner\r\n          fragility to her.\r\n          The room is spacious and elegantly appointed. A lovely Roman\r\n          statue in one corner.

She watches\r\n          the TV news footage of the war, upset by the images.\r\n          A frozen silence.\r\n\r\n                         THEN:\r\n\r\n                         VOLUMNIA\r\n          I pray you, daughter, sing, or express\r\n          yourself in a more comfortable sort.

She moves,\r\n          always, with stately grace.\r\n          She walks past a series of photographs. They tell the story\r\n          of Martius' life: the happy baby; the stern dead father; the\r\n          rigid young military cadet; the formal wedding; the\r\n          restrained and unsmiling adult.\r\n          In the photos we sense a transformation: innocent boy to\r\n          experienced, severe looking soldier.

CORIOLES - DAY\r\n\r\n          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! A series of explosions jolt us.\r\n          Corioles is a small urban center. Smoke billows up from areas\r\n          of the city. The steady crack and rattle of gunfire. The\r\n          occasional thud of explosions.\r\n          We see urban street-to-street fighting. The images are\r\n          startling in their familiarity: this could be Basra or\r\n          Belfast.\r\n          The battle is photographed in a gritty exposure. Color is\r\n          drained out -- blood is a darker red like oil. Soldiers are\r\n          dark forms moving through shadows and smoke.\r\n          Martius and Titus, leading a platoon of around twenty Roman\r\n          SOLDIERS, run into view and take cover. Bullets zip and snap\r\n          around them.\r\n          The Roman soldiers wear modern battle fatigues and body\r\n          armor, tricked out with all the latest tech gear. The\r\n          Volscians, being a poor guerilla force, wear thrown together\r\n          uniforms that look almost tribal.\r\n          Martius calls over the incessant din of battle to Titus and\r\n\r\n                         THE SOLDIERS:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          17.\r\n\r\n                         MARTIUS\r\n          They fear us not, but issue forth their\r\n          city.\r\n          Sniper bullets slam into a wall near him. He coughs away the\r\n          smoke and debris. This only makes him more angry:\r\n\r\n                         MARTIUS\r\n          They do disdain us much beyond our\r\n          thoughts,\r\n          Which makes me sweat with wrath!\r\n          He that retires, I'll take him for a\r\n          Volsce,\r\n          And he shall feel mine edge!\r\n          Martius leaps up and races on. The others follow in military\r\n          order.\r\n          The Roman soldiers move along the street -- it is chaotic --\r\n          explosions, smoke and sniper fire -- they duck into doorways\r\n          and behind abandoned cars -- returning fire as best they can--\r\n          Martius leads -- firing stead bursts from his machine gun--\r\n          It is slow and bloody going--\r\n          Finally the Romans turn a corner and are stopped by a\r\n          roadblock: a burning bus that fills the entire street--\r\n          The Volsces use this roadblock to ambush the Roman soldiers--\r\n          We see glimpses of Volscian soldiers darting for position --\r\n          firing from rooftops and from inside shops--\r\n\r\n                         BLISTERING CROSSFIRE--\r\n\r\n          INT.

He doesn't even realize he\r\n          is alone. He has become a sort of killing machine. A shark\r\n          moving through the ocean. Ruthless and efficient.\r\n          We become the warrior.\r\n          From Martius' POV:\r\n          We move through disorienting curtains of smoke...\r\n          Continue down the street...\r\n          Firing a heavy machine gun...\r\n          Volscian soldiers contort and die, torn to pieces by the\r\n          bullets...\r\n          The heavy machine gun is empty, we drop it and use a sidearm,\r\n          firing strategic shots...\r\n          Volscian soldiers dart up -- fire -- and die...\r\n          We keep moving steadily forward...\r\n          Shadowy shapes moving nearby, we fire.

Most of the windows shattered.\r\n          This is the Volscian stronghold. The last stand.

Exhausted after the long and failed battle.\r\n          Fires burn from blasted shops and homes. The Romans have\r\n          clearly laid waste to this part of the city.\r\n          There is a minivan stopped ahead of them. Bullets holes\r\n          everywhere. Bodies inside.\r\n          They walk to it. Aufidius looks in. A dead family. Father,\r\n          mother, kids in the back. Bloody toys on the floor of the\r\n          minivan.\r\n          Roman atrocities.\r\n          Aufidius gazes at the bodies.

POLITICO BAR - DAY\r\n\r\n          Back in Rome, we are at a comfortable restaurant/bar near the\r\n          Senate where politicians gather to eat, drink, gossip and\r\n          conspire. The business of state is conducted over steak and\r\n          martinis.\r\n          Comfortable red leather booths. Wooden panelling.\r\n          Two Tribunes -- Senators chosen to speak for the people --\r\n          are having lunch.\r\n          BRUTUS is a large man in a rumpled grey suit; a sweating bear\r\n          with a taste for bare-knuckle politics. SICINIUS is smaller\r\n          and vulpine; crafty and cold.\r\n          Both are ambitious politicos used to manipulating the people\r\n          and the press for their personal ends. With them sits\r\n          Cassius, the political agitator we met before.\r\n          The TV over the bar shows images of Martius' victory:\r\n          parading Roman troops; Volscian prisoners; flags; adoring\r\n          crowds; triumphant slogans; \"Mission Accomplished.\"\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          28.\r\n\r\n                         SICINIUS\r\n          Was ever man so proud as is this Martius?\r\n\r\n                         CASSIUS\r\n          He has no equal.\r\n\r\n                         SICINIUS\r\n          When we were chosen Tribunes for the\r\n\r\n                         PEOPLE-\r\n\r\n                         BRUTUS\r\n          Marked you his lip and eyes?\r\n\r\n                         SICINIUS\r\n          Nay, but his taunts.\r\n          They see Senator Menenius approaching. Sicinius nods to\r\n          Cassius, who quickly goes.\r\n          Menenius stops by on his way out. He is jolly, knowing the\r\n          victory will assure his protege's political future:\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          The augurer tells me we shall have news\r\n          tonight.\r\n\r\n                         BRUTUS\r\n          Good or bad?\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          Not according to the prayer of the\r\n          people, for they love not Martius.\r\n\r\n                         SICINIUS\r\n          Nature teaches beasts to know their\r\n          friends.\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          You blame Martius for being proud?\r\n\r\n                         BRUTUS\r\n          We do it not alone, sir.\r\n          Subtly, the polite chit-chat is turning more serious and\r\n          pointed; Menenius growing sharper. The gloves are coming off.\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          I know you can do very little alone\r\n          You talk of pride: 0 that you could turn\r\n           your eyes toward the napes of your necks,\r\n           and make but an interior survey of your\r\n          good selves! 0 that you could!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          29.\r\n\r\n                         BRUTUS\r\n          What then, sir?\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          Why, then you should discover a brace of\r\n          unmeriting, proud, violent, testy\r\n          magistrates, alias fools, as any in Rome.\r\n          The saturnine Sicinius' response seems almost a threat:\r\n\r\n                         SICINIUS\r\n          Menenius, you are known well enough too.\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          I am known to be a humorous patrician,\r\n          and one that loves a cup of hot wine with\r\n          not a drop of allaying water in it; one\r\n          that converses more with the buttock of\r\n          the night than with the forehead of the\r\n          morning.

More of your\r\n          conversation would infect my brain, being\r\n          the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians\r\n          I will be bold to take my leave of you.\r\n          He goes.

SENATE - DAY\r\n\r\n          The Roman Senate is constructed with classical symmetry and\r\n          clean, square lines. Probably the most striking and beautiful\r\n          building in Rome.\r\n\r\n          INT. SENATE-CORRIDOR - DAY\r\n\r\n          Volumnia, Virgilia and Menenius are hurrying down a corridor,\r\n          excited.

Where is he\r\n          wounded?\r\n          Volumnia and Menenius now gleefully add up her son's wounds\r\n          like accountants -- or campaign managers.\r\n\r\n                         VOLUMNIA\r\n          In the shoulder and in the left arm.\r\n          There will be large scars to show the\r\n          people, when he shall stand for his place\r\n          He received in the repulse of Tarquin\r\n          seven hurts in the body.\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          One in the neck, and two in the thigh -\r\n          there's nine that I know.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         31\r\n\r\n                         VOLUMNIA\r\n          He had, before this last expedition,\r\n          twenty-five wounds upon him.\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          Now it's twenty-seven. Every gash was an\r\n          enemy's grave.\r\n          We focus on Volumnia's face as she thinks about her son.\r\n\r\n                         VOLUMNIA\r\n\r\n                         BEFORE HIM\r\n          He carries noise, and behind him he\r\n          leaves tears.\r\n          Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm\r\n\r\n                         DOTH LIE;\r\n          Which, being advanced, declines, and then\r\n          men die.\r\n          They hurry to the stop of a grand staircase, where there are\r\n          people waiting...\r\n\r\n          INT. SENATE-STAIRS - DAY\r\n\r\n          They join Cominius and other dignitaries at the top of a\r\n          majestic stairway.\r\n          An honor guard of Roman soldiers in dress uniforms are\r\n          waiting. Roman flags flutter. All very ceremonial.\r\n          Martius enters below. The honor guard snaps to attention.\r\n          Martius -- hereafter called Coriolanus -- slowly begins to\r\n          cross to the steps. We see that walking is very difficult\r\n          for him. His wounds are severe and every movement is agony.\r\n          He has paid a steep price for his victory.\r\n          Photographers flash photos and a TV crew film the ceremony.\r\n          Coriolanus finally reaches the steps leading up. He takes a\r\n          breath and slowly begins to climb the stairs, each step a\r\n          challenge.\r\n          Volumnia looks down on him. Unmoved by his pain.\r\n          Virgilia is distraught.\r\n          As Coriolanus slowly hauls himself up the last few steps,\r\n          General Cominius speaks into a cluster of microphones and\r\n          addresses the press:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          32.\r\n\r\n                         COMINIUS\r\n          Be it known,\r\n          As to us, to all the world, that Caius\r\n\r\n                         MARTIUS\r\n          Wears this war's garland And from\r\n          this time,\r\n          For what he did before Corioles, call\r\n          him,\r\n          With all the applause and clamor of the\r\n          host,\r\n          \"Caius Martius Coriolanus!\"\r\n\r\n                         (TO MARTIUS)\r\n          Bear the addition nobly ever!\r\n          The soldiers salute in a grim sort of chant:\r\n\r\n                         SOLDIERS\r\n          Caius Martius Coriolanus!\r\n          Coriolanus has reached the podium. An awkward beat. Cominius\r\n          gestures for him to speak into the microphones.\r\n          He tersely does so:\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          No more of this; it does offend my heart.\r\n          Pray now, no more.\r\n          An awkward silence. Cominius elegantly tries to covers the\r\n\r\n                         MOMENT:\r\n\r\n                         COMINIUS\r\n          Look, sir, your mother.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n\r\n          0,\r\n          You have, I know, petitioned all the gods\r\n          For my prosperity.\r\n          He kneels to her -- slowly, with great difficulty -- she lets\r\n          him.\r\n\r\n                         VOLUMNIA\r\n          Nay, my good soldier, up.\r\n          (he slowly rises)\r\n          My gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and\r\n          By deed-achieving honor newly named -\r\n          What is it? - Coriolanus must I call\r\n          thee?\r\n          She laughs coquettishly, thoroughly upstaging her son.\r\n          Then, almost an afterthought:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          33.\r\n\r\n                         VOLUMNIA\r\n          But, 0, thy wife...\r\n          Coriolanus greets Virgilia with the clumsy and stiff\r\n          formality that marks their marriage.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          My gracious silence, hail.\r\n          An awkwardly tender kiss.

VILLA-BATHROOM - EVENING\r\n\r\n          And then the hard reality.\r\n          Coriolanus' body is a battleground of scars. Some are livid\r\n          and red, fresh and still oozing blood. Others are pale and\r\n          blue, discolored and dead.\r\n          His body is something monstrous. Stitched up. Patched\r\n          together. Slashed around.

His muscular if\r\n          shattered body exposed.\r\n          Volumnia sits and dresses her son's wounds. As she always has\r\n          done. As she always will.\r\n          It is a disturbing, intimate image.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          The good Senators must be visited;\r\n          From whom I have received not only\r\n          greetings,\r\n          But with them change of honors.\r\n          He shifts painfully as she continues to treat one of his\r\n          wounds.\r\n\r\n                         VOLUMNIA\r\n          I have lived\r\n          To see inherited my very wishes\r\n          And the buildings of my fancy.

It is embarrassing for her, as if\r\n          she has interrupted two lovers. A long moment.\r\n          She looks to her husband.\r\n          To Volumnia.\r\n          They stare back.\r\n          There is no way she can compete with their intimacy.\r\n          Surrendering, she silently goes.\r\n\r\n          INT.

The military toys. The little\r\n          cadet uniform carefully hung. The polished boots waiting.\r\n          All stern and joyless. Not like a child's room at all.\r\n          Virgilia closes the door and continues down the long hallway,\r\n          disappearing into darkness.\r\n\r\n          INT.

SENATE CHAMBER - DAY\r\n\r\n          Brutus and Sicinius make their way to their seats as we hear:\r\n\r\n          MENENIUS (V.0.)\r\n          It remains,\r\n          As the main point of this our after-\r\n          meeting,\r\n          To gratify his noble service that\r\n          Hath thus stood for his country...\r\n          The interior of the grand Senate is an airy, sweeping chamber\r\n          that suggests the Israeli Knesset or U.N. General Assembly.\r\n          Again, classical symmetry is the rule with tiers of seats\r\n          facing a central dais. An imposing piece of outdated modern\r\n          art suggesting the might of Rome looms over the chamber like\r\n          a bird of prey.\r\n          Network TV cameras purr quietly from a corner.\r\n          Menenius, Cominius, Coriolanus and several other politicos\r\n          are seating at a central table on the dais, facing the rows\r\n          of SENATORS.\r\n          Menenius is standing at a podium, speaking into a microphone:\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          Therefore, please you,\r\n          Most reverend and grave elders, to desire\r\n          The present Consul, and last general\r\n          In our well-found successes, to report\r\n          A little of that worthy work performed\r\n          By Caius Martius Coriolanus.\r\n\r\n                         SENATOR\r\n          Speak, good Cominius.\r\n          General Cominius rises and moves to the podium.\r\n          But then Coriolanus abruptly stands--\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          Nay, keep your place.\r\n\r\n                         SENATOR\r\n          Sit, Coriolanus. Never shame to hear\r\n          What you have nobly done.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          37.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          Your honors' pardon.\r\n          I had rather have my wounds to heal again\r\n          Than hear say how I got them.\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          Pray now, sit down.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          I had rather have one scratch my head in\r\n\r\n                         THE SUN\r\n          When the alarum were struck than idly sit\r\n          To hear my nothings monstered.\r\n          Coriolanus moves across the dais and exits into a hallway.\r\n          The door shuts after him.\r\n          Menenius sighs. Nods to Cominius.\r\n          Cominius moves to the podium and begins to read his speech\r\n          from a Teleprompter. This all has the rehearsed quality of a\r\n          campaign nomination speech.\r\n\r\n                         COMINIUS\r\n          The deeds of Coriolanus\r\n          Should not be uttered feebly. It is held\r\n          That valor is the chiefest virtue, and\r\n          Most dignifies the haver. Alone he\r\n\r\n                         ENTERED\r\n          The mortal gate of the city,\r\n          And struck Corioles like a planet,\r\n          From face to foot\r\n          He was a thing of blood...\r\n          Brutus and Sicinius exchange a glance, bored by the political\r\n          boilerplate.\r\n\r\n          INT. SENATE-SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY\r\n\r\n          Meanwhile, Coriolanus stands in the service corridor beyond\r\n          the chamber. Green industrial walls. Ugly fluorescent lights\r\n          above.\r\n          He leans against a wall, alone with his thoughts.\r\n          Cominius' voice can be heard droning inside.\r\n          Then Coriolanus glances up. A CUSTODIAN is pushing a garbage\r\n          can down the long corridor. He stops when he sees Coriolanus.\r\n          Coriolanus' cool, uncompromising stare makes the Custodian\r\n          uneasy. He turns around and goes back.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          38.\r\n          Coriolanus waits. His face strangely vacant.\r\n          He flexes his wounded arm. It hurts.\r\n          He hears Cominius finish. A good round of applause. He hears\r\n          his name being cheered: \"Coriolanus!\"\r\n          Coriolanus closes his eyes, steels himself, and then re-\r\n          enters the chamber...\r\n\r\n          INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY\r\n\r\n          Menenius greets him and escorts him to the podium for his\r\n          \"acceptance speech.\"\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased\r\n          To make thee Consul!\r\n          Menenius steps back.\r\n          A beat.\r\n          Coriolanus stares at the Senators. At the TV cameras.\r\n          He leans awkwardly into the podium microphone:\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          I do owe them still\r\n          My life and services.\r\n          A beat.\r\n          For an acceptance speech, rather terse. Menenius jumps in to\r\n          salvage the moment:\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          It then remains\r\n          That you do speak to the people.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          I do beseech you,\r\n          Let me overleap that custom, for I cannot\r\n\r\n                         ENTREAT THEM\r\n          For my wounds' sake to give their\r\n          suffrage.\r\n          Please you that I may pass this doing.\r\n          From the Senate floor, Sicinius jumps on this:\r\n\r\n                         SICINIUS\r\n          Sir, the people\r\n          Must have their voices!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          39.\r\n          The Senators, led by Brutus, clamor their agreement.\r\n          Tradition must be obeyed.\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          (calming, to Coriolanus)\r\n          Pray you, go fit you to the custom.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          It is a part\r\n          That I shall blush in acting, and might\r\n\r\n                         WELL\r\n          Be taken from the people.\r\n          Menenius quickly turns off Coriolanus' microphone.\r\n\r\n                         BRUTUS\r\n\r\n                         (TO SICINIUS)\r\n          Mark you that?\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          To brag unto them \"Thus I did, and thus!\"\r\n          Show them the unaching scars which I\r\n          should hide,\r\n          As if I had received them for the hire\r\n          Of their breath only!\r\n          Menenius sees Coriolanus is getting angry, this could be\r\n          disastrous.\r\n          He elegantly gestures for Cominius to escort Coriolanus out\r\n          immediately -- as he addresses the Senators and TV cameras:\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          To our noble Consul\r\n          Wish we all joy and honor!\r\n          He applauds. The applause is taken up by the Senators. Some\r\n          cheering as well for the hero of Rome The two Tribunes,\r\n          however, are already whispering maliciously to other\r\n          Senators.\r\n          Menenius seems pleased with the general response. So far, so\r\n          good.\r\n\r\n          INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Volumnia is pleased as well.\r\n          She sits, watching the events unfold on TV.\r\n          The sound of the cheering fades as we go to...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          40.\r\n\r\n          INT. MENENIUS' LIMO - DAY\r\n\r\n          The limousine winds through the pedestrian traffic toward the\r\n          Roman marketplace.\r\n          Coriolanus sits with Menenius. Coriolanus is both angry and\r\n          embarrassed. He is wearing a sharp business suit.\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          Have you not known\r\n          The worthiest men have done it?\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n\r\n                         (AGREES)\r\n          Custom calls me to it.\r\n          What custom wills, in all things should\r\n          we do...\r\n          What must I say?\r\n          \"Look, sir, my wounds.\r\n          I got them in my country's service.\"\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          O me, the gods!\r\n          You must not speak like that. You must\r\n\r\n                         DESIRE THEM\r\n          To think upon you--\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          \"Think upon me\"?

The moment has\r\n          come.\r\n          Menenius takes a breath. Urges calm:\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          Pray you, speak to them, I pray you,\r\n          In wholesome manner.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n\r\n                         (SOURLY)\r\n          Bid them wash their faces\r\n          And keep their teeth clean.\r\n          He leaves the car.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          41.\r\n\r\n          EXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY\r\n\r\n          The commercial heart of Rome. A large town square, since\r\n          antiquity used as a marketplace.\r\n          But now it is filled with tatty stalls selling cheap purses\r\n          and knock-off watches. Paltry fruit stands alongside shabby\r\n          souvenir stalls.\r\n          Advertising billboards surround and pollute the square --\r\n          SONY. COKE. NIKE. MCDONALDS -- obscuring any classical\r\n          architecture that might have survived.\r\n          Tamora and Cassius, the political activists, are in the\r\n          crowd. They watch closely.\r\n          Coriolanus slowly walks to the center of the marketplace. He\r\n          stands, feeling ridiculous and not at all humble.\r\n          He looks around.\r\n          Waiting for something to happen.\r\n          The CUSTOMERS and SHOPKEEPERS just look back at him. Some are\r\n          curious. Some are amused. Some hostile and most indifferent.\r\n          But no one approaches.\r\n          Then Coriolanus understands. He must g to them: beg for\r\n          votes.\r\n          He prepares himself and then slowly moves through the various\r\n          stalls, weaving in and out. Trying to maintain his dignity.\r\n          He sees the Citizens from before and goes to them. We glimpse\r\n          Brutus and Sicinius amongst the crowd.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n\r\n                         (TO CASSIUS)\r\n          You know the cause, sir, of my standing\r\n          here.\r\n\r\n                         CASSIUS\r\n          We do, sir.

I\r\n          have wounds to show you, which shall be\r\n          yours in private Your good voice,\r\n          sir. What say you?\r\n\r\n                         WAR VET\r\n\r\n                         (IMPRESSED)\r\n          You shall have it, worthy sir.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          A match, sir. There's in all two worthy\r\n          voices begged. I have your alms.

He is solitary\r\n          and without comfort: vulnerable to the elements and also to\r\n          the demons of his own psyche.\r\n          We see him as...\r\n          He walks along the barren highway. Trash piled along the\r\n          road. A car zooms past. Whoosh. He is lost in dust...\r\n          Blazing heat, like a furnace, as he trudges over desert\r\n          terrain. Burning oil wells blacken the sky in the distance...\r\n          Isolated, within himself, as he walks past the detritus of\r\n          war a burned out tank a mountain of rusted artillery\r\n          shells skeletons bleached in the sun...\r\n          His clothes are dusty and dirty now. A sandstorm. He wraps a\r\n          scarf around his head, like a burnoose. Only his eyes visible\r\n          now...\r\n          A gypsy boy in tattered clothing riding a white horse passes\r\n          him. The boy looks at him intently as he passes...\r\n          We get a sense of him moving into different terrain, up into\r\n          a mountain range, climbing...\r\n          Then descending. Pouring rain. Lightning sparking. He is\r\n          almost a Romantic figure now. Byronic. Wrapped in a cloak\r\n          against the wildness of nature; the chiaroscuro flashes of\r\n          light illuminating his haunted eyes...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          71.\r\n          We end at...\r\n\r\n          EXT. OUTSIDE ANTIUM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Coriolanus stands. Like a statue. All his life in his blazing\r\n          eyes. He is staring at a small town in the distance.\r\n          We see a sign: ANTIUM.\r\n          His destination since he began. The home of his nemesis, the\r\n          hated Aufidius.\r\n          He begins to walk to the town.\r\n\r\n          INT. POLITICO BAR - DAY\r\n\r\n          Meanwhile, back in Rome, Brutus and Sicinius are having lunch\r\n          at their usual hangout.\r\n          They see Volumnia entering the restaurant, pulling Virgilia\r\n          after her. An ambush. She heads toward the Tribunes.\r\n          Volumnia's eyes have the grim intensity of a predator. She\r\n          looks strangely wild.\r\n\r\n                         BRUTUS\r\n          Here comes his mother.\r\n\r\n                         SICINIUS\r\n          (prepares to go)\r\n          Let's not meet her.

Saddened.\r\n          Once proud Volumnia, reduced to this.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ANTIUM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Antium is an old Volscian city gone to seed. It is Latin in\r\n          flavor, something like Havana.\r\n          There is life to the place, a certain humid vitality. Someone\r\n          is singing in a bar. Old men are playing dominos on a patio.\r\n          Flickering TV and radio babel from terraced apartment\r\n          buildings.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          74.\r\n          Coriolanus, his face still shrouded in the burnoose, like a\r\n          Hamas soldier, moves through the streets.\r\n          He takes in the life of the town as he walks. Studying the\r\n          faces of the Volscians around him.\r\n          Coriolanus sees a heavily-guarded apartment building at the\r\n          end of the street. Jeeps and SOLDIERS.\r\n          Coriolanus approaches with stealth, moving in and out of\r\n          shadows along the street, ducking into doorways and alleys,\r\n          taking advantage of the darkness.\r\n          He stops. Steps into the shadows. For he sees...\r\n          Aufidius.\r\n          Walking with a few of his officers.\r\n          Aufidius is beloved in Antium. He has an easy manner with the\r\n          people. He stops and chats. Laughs with them. He dances for a\r\n          moment with a little girl.\r\n          Coriolanus watches from the shadows, his expression complex.\r\n          There is real envy . Aufidius has such a comfortable way\r\n          with the common people, he's natural, unaffected.\r\n          Aufidius jokes with the little girl's parents for a moment\r\n          and then moves on.\r\n          Coriolanus watches Aufidius and his men go into an apartment\r\n          building.\r\n          He scans the building with the eye of a Special Forces\r\n          soldier. He sees that the soldiers guarding the building are\r\n          bored, it is perfunctory work.\r\n          Two YOUNG WOMEN, perhaps hookers, move past the front of the\r\n          building, flirting with the soldiers. The soldiers call and\r\n          whistle to them, delighted.\r\n          Coriolanus uses this distraction to slip into the shadows\r\n          behind the soldiers and sneak into the building...\r\n\r\n          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING-CORRIDOR - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Coriolanus moves again with stealth, heading toward what is\r\n          clearly the center of the action: a noisy room on the second\r\n          floor.\r\n          The doorway is guarded by two serious GUARDS. These are not\r\n          the bored soldiers out front, these are grim and intense\r\n          warriors.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          75.\r\n          Coriolanus considers his course.\r\n          Decides. Takes a breath. Focuses.\r\n          He is like ice now.\r\n\r\n                         HE MOVES--\r\n          A steady stride--\r\n          He walks right up to the Guards--\r\n          Before they can even respond--\r\n          He punches one HARD in the throat -- the Guard recoils,\r\n          gasping for air--\r\n          Simultaneously, Coriolanus SLAMS his other hand violently\r\n          over the entire face of the second Guard -- grabbing his face\r\n          firmly and SHOVING him back into the door--\r\n          So hard that the door slams aside--\r\n          And Coriolanus shoves the Guard into--\r\n\r\n          INT. AUFIDIUS' CHAMBER - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Aufidius is having dinner with some of his men, their wives\r\n          and some children--\r\n           The soldiers bolt up, upsetting the table, smashing dishes --\r\n          pulling guns -- alarmed--\r\n          As Coriolanus powers in, still holding the second Guard by\r\n\r\n                         THE FACE--\r\n          He flings the Guard aside--\r\n          Aufidius and his men, all pointing weapons at Coriolanus, are\r\n          stunned.\r\n          A long beat.\r\n          Coriolanus' face is still masked by the burnoose. Only his\r\n          cold eyes are visible.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          Whence comes thou? What wouldst thou? Thy\r\n          name?\r\n          Coriolanus does not respond.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          76.\r\n          Aufidius is growing uneasy. His men are tense, ready to open\r\n          fire at any second.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          Speak, man! What's thy name?\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,\r\n          And harsh in sound to thine.\r\n          The other Guard from outside, and several other soldiers,\r\n          rush in. Weapons drawn, surrounding Coriolanus.\r\n          He doesn't move a muscle.\r\n          Aufidius, intrigued by the stranger's courage, waves his men\r\n          off.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          Say, what's thy name?\r\n          Thou has a grim appearance .What's thy\r\n          name?\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          Know'st thou me yet?\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          I know thee not Thy name?\r\n          Finally, Coriolanus removes his burnoose. His face is\r\n          exposed. The Volscians are stunned.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          My name is Caius Martius, who hath done\r\n          To thee particularly and to all the\r\n\r\n                         VOLSCES\r\n          Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness\r\n\r\n                         MAY\r\n          My surname Coriolanus.\r\n          The Volscians look to Aufidius, very nervous, unsure how to\r\n          proceed. Aufidius just stares back at Coriolanus, staggered.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          Only that name remains.\r\n          Aufidius doesn't understand. Coriolanus explains:\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          The cruelty and envy of the people,\r\n          Who have all forsook me, hath devoured\r\n          the rest,\r\n          And suffered me by the voice of slaves to\r\n\r\n                         BE\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          77.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS (CANT'D)\r\n          Whooped out of Rome.

Guns are raised, fingers tight on\r\n          triggers, an instant from opening fire--\r\n          Coriolanus carefully holds out his arms. He's unarmed.\r\n          Aufidius nods to his men. They hold their fire.\r\n          Coriolanus slowly crosses the room toward Aufidius. Step by\r\n          step. Their eyes are locked. Nothing else in the world\r\n          exists.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          I will fight\r\n          Against my cankered country with the\r\n\r\n                         SPLEEN\r\n          Of all the under fiends. But if thou\r\n          Dares not this, then I present\r\n          My throat to thee and to thy ancient\r\n          malice...\r\n          Coriolanus stops right in front of Aufidius and slowly,\r\n          carefully, undoes his collar. Exposing his naked throat.\r\n          Bending back his head.\r\n          Ready for execution.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          Which not to cut would show thee but\r\n          a fool,\r\n          Since I have ever followed thee with\r\n          hate,\r\n          And cannot live but to thy shame unless\r\n          It be to do thee service.\r\n          A long beat.\r\n          Aufidius stares at Coriolanus.\r\n          The Volscians watch, eyes wide, too tense to do anything now.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          78.\r\n          Aufidius just continues to stare at Coriolanus.\r\n          Eyes locked.\r\n          Coriolanus blinks some sweat from his eyes. This tiny, human\r\n          response sparks something in Aufidius.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          O Martius Martius\r\n          Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded\r\n          from my heart\r\n          A root of ancient envy.\r\n          He offers his hand.\r\n          Coriolanus takes it. Aufidius continues to hold him by the\r\n          hand, rather intensely, speaking low:\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          Let me twine\r\n          Mine arms about that body.\r\n          He embraces Coriolanus.\r\n          Aufidius' men finally relax. Weapons are lowered. Relieved\r\n          glances exchanged.\r\n          Some of the Volscians, though, are clearly suspicious of\r\n          Coriolanus. They watch Aufidius and Coriolanus, concerned.\r\n          Aufidius still can't quite believe his ancient enemy is now\r\n          his newest ally.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n\r\n                         KNOW THOU\r\n          I loved the maid I married; never man\r\n          Sighed truer breath. But that I see thee\r\n          here,\r\n          Thou noble thing, more dances my rapt\r\n\r\n                         HEART\r\n          Than when I first my wedded mistress saw\r\n          Bestride my threshold.\r\n          Coriolanus glances to him, perhaps a little disturbed or\r\n          embarrassed by the intensity of Aufidius' words.\r\n          Aufidius steps away from him, gestures for Coriolanus to sit.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          Why, thou Mars, I tell thee,\r\n          We have a power on foot, and I had\r\n\r\n                         PURPOSE\r\n          Once more to hew thy target from thy\r\n          brawn,\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          79.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS (CONT'D)\r\n          Or lose mine arm for it. Thou hast beat\r\n\r\n                         ME OUT\r\n          Twelve several times, and I have nightly\r\n\r\n                         SINCE\r\n          Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and\r\n          me.\r\n          Aufidius continues quietly, almost whispering:\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          Worthy Martius,\r\n          Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that\r\n          Thou art thence banished, we would muster\r\n\r\n                         ALL\r\n          From twelve to seventy, and, pouring war\r\n          Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,\r\n          Like a bold flood, overbear it.\r\n\r\n          INT. SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Coriolanus sits, naked. He has finally washed off the layers\r\n          of dirt from his journey.\r\n          An old woman is using an electric razor to shave his head.\r\n          Aufidius is standing in the doorway to the room. Watching.\r\n          His eyes move over Coriolanus' body, adding up the scars and\r\n          wounds.\r\n          A pause.\r\n          Then Aufidius goes to the old woman. Takes the razor from\r\n          her. She goes.\r\n          Aufidius continues to shave Coriolanus' head himself.\r\n          It is a deeply personal act, even intimate Yet Aufidius\r\n          employs the same methodical rhythms as when he was sharpening\r\n          his knife at the opening of the story.\r\n\r\n          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING-WAR ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The Volscian military command center. Maps, recon photos and\r\n          radio equipment. Stacks of grenade launchers and arms.\r\n          Aufidius' CAPTAINS and AIDES wait alongside some bedraggled\r\n          Volsce POLITICIANS in ill-fitting suits.\r\n          Aufidius ushers Coriolanus in:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          80.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          0, come, go in,\r\n          And take our friendly senators by the\r\n          hands.\r\n          Coriolanus shakes hands with the politicians:\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          You bless me, gods.\r\n          Then Aufidius takes him to a huge military map laid out on a\r\n          pool table. Rome and her territories. Strategic markers\r\n          denote Roman forces and Volscian forces.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou\r\n\r\n                         WILT HAVE\r\n          The leading of thine own revenges, take\r\n          The one half of my commission.\r\n          The Volscian soldiers and politicos are shocked. Aufidius is\r\n          giving Coriolanus command of half his forces!\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          And set down---\r\n          As best thou art experienced, since thou\r\n\r\n                         KNOWS\r\n          Thy country's strength and weakness---\r\n          thine own ways,\r\n          Whether to knock against the gates of\r\n          Rome,\r\n          Or rudely visit them in parts remote,\r\n          To fright them ere destroy.\r\n          Aufidius looks at Coriolanus hard. There it is. The gauntlet\r\n          is thrown down. Coriolanus will have to completely betray\r\n          Rome: expose her military weaknesses, tell her secrets.\r\n          For all his neurotic intensity, Aufidius is a shrewd man.\r\n          Coriolanus nods and turns to the battle map, moving various\r\n          markers around to show Rome's defensive positions.\r\n          Aufidius watches him with Machiavellian calm.\r\n\r\n          INT. POLITICO BAR - DAY\r\n\r\n          Several weeks later, back in Rome, politics go on as usual.\r\n          Menenius is passing the Tribunes' table. They josh with him:\r\n\r\n                         BRUTUS\r\n          Is this Menenius?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         81\r\n\r\n                         SICINIUS\r\n          'Tis he,'tis he! 0, he is grown most kind\r\n          of late.

His mother and his\r\n\r\n                         WIFE\r\n          Hear nothing from him.\r\n\r\n                         BRUTUS\r\n          Caius Martius was\r\n          A worthy officer in the war, but\r\n          insolent,\r\n          Overcome with pride, ambitious past all\r\n          thinking,\r\n\r\n                         SELF-LOVING--\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          I think not so.\r\n\r\n                         SICINIUS\r\n          And Rome sits safe and still without him.\r\n          They are distracted when people begin talking loudly,\r\n          alarmed, at the bar. They hush each other and watch the TV\r\n          over the bar. Something has happened.\r\n          On the TV: a SPECIAL REPORT. Breaking News.

They have altered their uniforms into something\r\n          pagan and primitive. All have shaved heads. Many have face\r\n          tattoos or wear striking war paint.\r\n          It is like something from LORD OF THE FLIES.\r\n          They set the barber chair down outside an abandoned factory.\r\n          This shattered and abandoned factory is Coriolanus' domain.\r\n          It is decorated with human skulls.\r\n          The CAMP BARBER, a fat man in a greasy butcher's apron,\r\n          begins to strop his razor.\r\n          Hard core young soldiers line up to have their heads shaved.\r\n          They are Coriolanus' ACOLYTES.\r\n          There is no sign of Coriolanus himself.\r\n          Aufidius and his LIEUTENANT stand on the fringes, disturbed\r\n          by the strange cult of personality that has grown up around\r\n          Coriolanus.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          Do they still fly to Coriolanus?\r\n\r\n                         LIEUTENANT\r\n          I do not know what witchcraft's in him,\r\n\r\n                         BUT\r\n          Your soldiers use him as the grace before\r\n          meat,\r\n          Their talk at table, and their thanks at\r\n          end.\r\n          And you are darkened in this action, sir.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          He bears himself more proud,\r\n          Even to my person, than I thought he\r\n\r\n                         WOULD\r\n          When first I did embrace him.\r\n          They turn and walk to the building where Aufidius is\r\n\r\n                         QUARTERED:\r\n\r\n                         LIEUTENANT\r\n          Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry\r\n          Rome?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          85.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n\r\n                         (GRIM)\r\n          I think he'll be to Rome\r\n          As is the osprey to the fish, who takes\r\n\r\n                         IT\r\n          By sovereignty of nature.\r\n          Aufidius nods to the guards outside his quarters and enters\r\n          with his Lieutenant...\r\n\r\n          INT.

Aufidius' gear.\r\n          Aufidius sits on his cot, deep in thought.\r\n          He pulls a folded bit of paper from his pocket. Carefully and\r\n          lovingly unfolds it. He has been carrying this paper for\r\n          months.\r\n          We realize it is the glossy magazine cover with the picture\r\n          of Coriolanus that Aufidius tore out earlier.\r\n          He gazes at the picture, his fingers smoothing the paper,\r\n          tracing the contours of Coriolanus' face...\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          Whether t'was pride,\r\n          Whether defect of judgement,\r\n          Or whether nature,\r\n          Not to be other than one thing,\r\n          Made him feared,\r\n          So hated, and so banished.\r\n          A beat as he studies the picture.\r\n          His lieutenant watches him closely, disturbed by Aufidius'\r\n          obsession with Coriolanus.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          So our virtues\r\n          Lie in the interpretation of the time.\r\n          He brings the picture closer, whispering now:\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          One fire drives out one fire; one nail,\r\n\r\n                         ONE NAIL;\r\n          Rights by rights founder, strengths by\r\n          strengths do fail\r\n          And when, Caius, Rome is thine,\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          86.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS (CONT'D)\r\n          Thou art poorest of all -- then shortly\r\n          art thou mine.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Menenius is out of place\r\n          in his trim business suit: a politician among soldiers.\r\n          Menenius steels himself then passes through the Roman\r\n          checkpoint.\r\n          He walks down the highway toward the distant Volscian troops.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Transformed.\r\n          And terrifying.\r\n          He is no longer Roman. He is not Volscian. He is, as Titus\r\n          said, \"a kind of nothing.\"\r\n          He sits in the barber chair. His head is completely shaved.\r\n          His face is marked with martial face painting. These striking\r\n          totemic markings also cover his scarred body.\r\n          He is primitive. Inhuman. Like a dragon.\r\n          The Angel of Death.\r\n          His young warrior Acolytes -- similarly shaved and painted --\r\n          are gathered around him; his personal bodyguard and cult.\r\n          A long beat as Menenius stares at his friend, stunned at the\r\n          pagan metamorphosis.\r\n          Coriolanus just gazes back at him.\r\n          Menenius finally pulls himself together and approaches, with\r\n\r\n                         FULSOME BRAVADO:\r\n\r\n                         MENENIUS\r\n          The glorious gods sit in hourly synod\r\n          about thy particular prosperity, and love\r\n          thee no worse than thy old friend\r\n          Menenius does! 0 Martius, Martius!\r\n          He steps forward to hug Coriolanus. Two of the Acolytes stop\r\n          him. He can approach no further.\r\n          Menenius accepts this. No matter. He is completely confident\r\n          he will be able to manipulate his protege.

Also he is\r\n          plagued by guilt. He helped create this monster. He pushed\r\n          Coriolanus into politics. And now Coriolanus has lost his\r\n          soul, even his humanity, and Rome is to be put to the sword.\r\n          All his fault.\r\n          This preys on him.\r\n\r\n          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DAY\r\n\r\n          Menenius' limousine pulls over by an isolated set of railroad\r\n          tracks. Weeds springing up. Battered advertising posters. An\r\n          old chain link fence.\r\n          Menenius climbs out of the car and walks along the tracks.\r\n          Thinking.\r\n          He stops.\r\n          He sits on the railroad tracks.\r\n          Pulls out a little pocket knife and, in the Roman fashion,\r\n          efficiently slits his wrists.\r\n          He stares out over the hideous landscape.\r\n          Blood begins to pool around his stylish shoes.\r\n          From afar we see him, sitting on the railroad tracks, alone\r\n          and forlorn in this surreal urban wasteland, like a Samuel\r\n          Beckett character.\r\n          He slumps over.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          92.\r\n          Menenius is dead.\r\n\r\n          INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - SUNSET\r\n\r\n          The red glow of dusk is shining through the cracked and dusty\r\n          windows.\r\n          Coriolanus, still in the barber chair, broods silently.\r\n          Aufidius sits nearby, watching him.\r\n          The visit from Menenius is troubling Coriolanus.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          My partner in this action,\r\n          You must report to the Volscian lords how\r\n\r\n                         PLAINLY\r\n          I have borne this business.\r\n          Aufidius is curiously formal in his response, the\r\n          estrangement he feels toward Coriolanus growing:\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          Only their ends\r\n          You have respected; stopped your ears\r\n\r\n                         AGAINST\r\n          The general suit of Rome; never admitted\r\n          A private whisper, no, not with such\r\n\r\n                         FRIENDS\r\n          That thought them sure of you.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          This last old man,\r\n          Whom with a cracked heart I have sent to\r\n          Rome,\r\n          Loved me above the measure of a father.\r\n          Shouts and whistles from outside the factory draw their\r\n          attention.\r\n\r\n          EXT. VOLSCIAN CAMP - SUNSET\r\n\r\n          Volumnia, Virgilia and Young Martius stride past the soldiers\r\n          and mountains of military hardware. Volumnia leads, pulling\r\n          the others by the hand.\r\n          Some of the soldiers whistle. Some spit. Others laugh and\r\n          make lascivious noises. Many just watch with grim dislike.\r\n          Volumnia appears to be completely impervious to the whistles\r\n          and cruel taunts. Her head is high, back straight, eagle eye\r\n          forward. She was never more a Roman patrician.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          93.\r\n          She is magnificent.\r\n\r\n          INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - SUNSET\r\n\r\n          Coriolanus stands as Volumnia, Virgilia and Young Martius are\r\n          led into the factory.\r\n          He tries to register nothing, assuming a sort of glacial\r\n          calm.\r\n          Volumnia and the others stop -- taking in Coriolanus' savage\r\n          new demeanor and appearance -- taking in the Acolytes and\r\n          pagan totems.\r\n          Volumnia just stands, peering sternly at her son. As if\r\n          daring him not to crumble before her. He doesn't.\r\n          Aufidius watches everything closely.\r\n          It is Virgilia, finally, who bravely approaches:\r\n\r\n                         VIRGILIA\r\n          My lord and husband--\r\n          He stop her, almost a warning, with:\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          These eyes are not the same I wore in\r\n          Rome.\r\n\r\n                         VIRGILIA\r\n          The sorrow that delivers us thus changed\r\n          Makes you think so.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          Best of my flesh,\r\n          Forgive my tyranny, but do not say\r\n          For that \"Forgive our Romans.\"\r\n          She shows great courage. Stepping forward and kissing him\r\n          deeply. A long kiss.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          0, a kiss Long as my exile, sweet as\r\n          my revenge.\r\n          It is a perverse response. In his monomaniacal imagination,\r\n          his wife's kiss is obsessively equated with his revenge on\r\n          Rome.\r\n          He finally moves to Volumnia, simply can't resist her orbital\r\n          pull.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          94.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          You gods I prate,\r\n           And the most noble mother of the world\r\n           Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, in the\r\n          earth.\r\n           He kneels before her. It is done with a sense of duty and\r\n          protocol, not affection.\r\n\r\n                         VOLUMNIA\r\n          0, stand up blest.\r\n          He rises.\r\n\r\n                         VOLUMNIA\r\n          Then with no softer cushion than the\r\n\r\n                         FLINT\r\n          I kneel before thee.\r\n           She quickly and dramatically kneels before him.

A pitiable sight. But he\r\n          has no pity.\r\n          He turns, sits in the barber chair.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          I beseech you, peace!\r\n          Or, if you'd ask, remember this:\r\n          Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or\r\n\r\n                         CAPITULATE\r\n          Again with Rome's mechanics.

Yet he is\r\n          listening intensely and Volumnia's words are affecting.\r\n          She fights back emotion.

Or\r\n          seeming so.\r\n          She stares at Coriolanus as she rips off the Roman Eagle\r\n          medal she wears and flings it to the ground.\r\n          The blood red sky of sunset behind her reflects her passion\r\n          as she summons up all her strength for a lacerating and icy\r\n\r\n                         FAREWELL:\r\n\r\n                         VOLUMNIA\r\n          This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;\r\n          His wife is in Corioles and his child\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          99.\r\n\r\n                         VOLUMNIA (CONT'D)\r\n          Like him by chance Yet give us our\r\n          dispatch.\r\n          I am hushed until our city be afire,\r\n          And then I'll speak a little.\r\n          She turns and begins to go.\r\n          But...\r\n          We see finally Coriolanus crack.\r\n          Like a great building crumbling.\r\n          Like fissures cutting across marble.\r\n          Emotion floods into him.\r\n          He lunges forward and grabs her hand. Volumnia stops.\r\n          Time stands still.\r\n          He doesn't speak.\r\n\r\n                         THEN:\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          O mother mother...\r\n          What have you done?\r\n          He falls to his knees, clutching her hand.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          Behold, the heavens do ope,\r\n          The gods look down -- and this unnatural\r\n\r\n                         SCENE\r\n          They laugh at.\r\n          He buries his head in her, like a lost child:\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n           O my mother, mother! 0!\r\n           You have won a happy victory for Rome;\r\n           But for your son - believe it, 0 believe\r\n          it! -\r\n          Most dangerously you have with him\r\n\r\n                         PREVAILED\r\n          (he looks up at her\r\n\r\n                         DEEPLY)\r\n          If not most mortal to him.\r\n          She looks down at him. His meaning, his foreshadowing, is\r\n          clear: she has saved Rome, but he knows he is doomed. Rome\r\n          will live. He will die.

He slowly walks to\r\n          Aufidius.\r\n          He leans close, speaking intimately:\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,\r\n          I'll frame convenient peace.

But, good\r\n          sir,\r\n          What peace you'll make, advise me.\r\n          We study Aufidius' face. He gives away nothing.\r\n          Coriolanus turns back to Volumnia. Looks at her.\r\n          She is victorious.\r\n          The crimson sky looms over her ominously.\r\n          And we go to...\r\n\r\n          INT. FORMAL MINISTRY HALL - DAY\r\n\r\n          A solemn peace treaty signing ceremony.\r\n          Coriolanus represents the Volscians. Cominius represents the\r\n          Romans. They sit side-by-side at desks signing the treaty.\r\n          Volumnia and Virgilia, gorgeously dressed, are present. So\r\n          too Brutus and Sicinius.

TRUCK STOP - DAY\r\n\r\n           A rundown Truck Stop in an industrial wasteland.\r\n          Garish, buzzing neon. Filthy 18-wheelers refueling. Music\r\n          droning from a radio.\r\n          Aufidius, his Lieutenant and seven of his men are waiting\r\n          outside the dusty diner.\r\n          The men with Aufidius are thugs and killers, the most brutal\r\n          Volsces he could find. We note a couple of Coriolanus'\r\n          Acolytes among them. They have turned with great venom on\r\n          their hero.\r\n          They are like a mafia hit squad, waiting for Coriolanus to\r\n          return with the peace treaty.\r\n          Aufidius is deep in thought.\r\n          His Lieutenant breaks the silence:\r\n\r\n                         LIEUTENANT\r\n          How is it with our general?\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          As with a man by his own charity slain.\r\n\r\n                         LIEUTENANT\r\n          Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst\r\n          'Twixt you there's difference; but the\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          102.\r\n\r\n                         LIEUTENANT (CANT'D)\r\n          fall of either\r\n          Makes the survivor heir of all.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          I know it,\r\n          And my pretext to strike at him admits\r\n          A good construction.\r\n          A beat.

Clouds of dust billow up.\r\n          They exchange a look. This is what they have been waiting\r\n          for. They stand, stretch and prepare.\r\n          The truck stops across the highway from them and Coriolanus\r\n          gets out. He holds a copy of the peace treaty in a leather\r\n          portfolio. He is unarmed.\r\n          He stops.\r\n          He sees Aufidius and the thugs. Waiting for him. Like a death\r\n          squad.\r\n          Coriolanus looks at them.\r\n          He knows exactly what's going to happen.\r\n          He is ready.\r\n          He nods and the truck drives off.\r\n          Coriolanus slowly crosses the highway to the truck stop, like\r\n          a gunslinger walking down Main Street.\r\n          There is something new to Coriolanus here. A sort of\r\n          acceptance. He knows his time is past.\r\n          Aufidius and the thugs go to meet him. The thugs spread out a\r\n          bit, strategically, getting ready to strike. Coriolanus'\r\n          experienced eyes miss none of this.\r\n          They meet in the parking lot.\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n\r\n                         (TO AUFIDIUS)\r\n          I am returned your soldier,\r\n          No more infected with my country's love\r\n          Than when I parted hence, but still\r\n\r\n                         SUBSISTING\r\n          Under your great command.\r\n          He hands the treaty portfolio to Aufidius:\r\n\r\n                         CORIOLANUS\r\n          We have made peace\r\n          With no less honor to the Volscians\r\n          Than shame to the Romans.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          104.\r\n\r\n                         AUFIDIUS\r\n          (handing the treaty to\r\n\r\n                         LIEUTENANT)\r\n          Read it not,\r\n          But tell the traitor, in the highest\r\n\r\n                         DEGREE\r\n          He hath abused your powers.\r\n          Coriolanus is ready for Aufidius' ploy.

The rioters are particularly angry at Caius Martius (Ralph Fiennes), a brilliant Roman general whom they blame for the city's problems. During a march, the rioters encounter Martius, who is openly contemptuous and does not hide his low opinion of the regular citizens. The commander of the Volscian army, Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler), who has fought Martius on several occasions and considers him a mortal enemy, swears that the next time they meet in battle will be the last. Martius leads a raid against the Volscian city of Corioles and during the siege, with much of Martius's unit being killed, Martius gathers reinforcements and the Romans take the city. After the battle, Martius and Aufidius meet in single combat, which results in both men being wounded but ends when Aufidius' soldiers drag him away from the fight.\nMartius returns to Rome victorious and in recognition of his great courage, General Cominius (John Kani) gives him the agnomen of \"Coriolanus\". Coriolanus's mother Volumnia (Vanessa Redgrave) encourages her son to run for consul within the Roman Senate. Coriolanus is reluctant but he eventually agrees to his mother's wishes. He easily wins the Roman Senate and seems at first to have won over the commoners as well due to his military victories. Two tribunes, Brutus (Paul Jesson) and Sicinius (James Nesbitt), are critical of his entrance into politics, fearing that his popularity would lead to Coriolanus taking power away from the Senate for himself. They scheme to undo Coriolanus and so stir up another riot in opposition to him becoming consul. When they call Coriolanus a traitor, Coriolanus bursts into rage and openly attacks the concept of popular rule as well as the citizens of Rome, demonstrating that he still holds the plebeians in contempt. He compares allowing citizens to have power over the senators as to allowing \"crows to peck the eagles\". The tribunes term Coriolanus a traitor for his words and order him banished. Coriolanus retorts that it is he who will banish Rome from his presence: \"There is a world elsewhere\".\nAfter being exiled from Rome, Coriolanus seeks out Aufidius in the Volscian capital of Antium and offers to let Aufidius kill him, to spite the country that banished him. Moved by his plight and honoured to fight alongside the great general, Aufidius and his superiors embrace Coriolanus and allow him to lead a new assault on the city, so that he can claim vengeance on the city which he feels betrayed him. Coriolanus and Aufidius lead a Voscilian attack on Rome. Panicked, Rome sends General Titus to persuade Coriolanus to halt his crusade for vengeance; when Titus reports his failure, Senator Menenius (Brian Cox) follows but is also shunned. In response, Menenius, who has seemingly lost all hope in Coriolanus and Rome, commits suicide by a river bank. Finally, Volumnia is sent to meet with her son, along with Coriolanus' wife Virgilia (Jessica Chastain) and his son. Volumnia succeeds in dissuading her son from destroying Rome and Coriolanus makes peace between the Volscians and the Romans alongside General Cominius. When Coriolanus returns to the Volscian border, he is confronted by Aufidius and his men, who now also brand him as a traitor. They call him Martius and refuse to call him by his \"stolen name\" of Coriolanus. Aufidius explains to Coriolanus how he put aside his hatred so that they could conquer Rome but now that Coriolanus has prevented this, he has betrayed the promise between them. For this betrayal, Aufidius and his men attack and kill Coriolanus."}

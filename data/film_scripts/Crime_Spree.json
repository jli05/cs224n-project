DARK ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Pitch dark. We hear two men speaking FRENCH in hushed voices.\n               NOTE: All dialogue is in French until otherwise noted.\n\n                                       DANIEL\n                               (whispering)\n                          Turn on the flashlight.\n\n                                         JULIEN\n                          I'm trying.

You just bought it this\n                          afternoon.\n\n               A beat.\n\n                                       JULIEN\n                          Do they come with batteries?\n\n                                       DANIEL\n                          You didn't buy batteries?\n\n                                       JULIEN\n                          I thought they came with batteries.\n\n                                       DANIEL\n                          I can't believe you didn't check.\n\n                                       JULIEN\n                          I bought everything you put on the list.\n                          Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight.\n                          Batteries were not on the list.\n\n                                       DANIEL\n                          Why should I have to put it on the list?\n                          It's like saying to buy a car with tires.\n\n               \n\n               EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\n               A wealthy neighborhood of Paris off the Champs Elysees. Large\n               homes line the secluded street. We see the silhouette of a man in\n               a Peugeot. We MOVE IN closer to see RAYMOND GAYET, 30's, waits\n               nervously.\n\n               \n\n               INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n               Dark. DANIEL FORAY lights his Zippo lighter. He is late 30's,\n               tall, handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the\n               flame. Beside him is JULIEN LABESSE, 30's, hyper. Daniel places\n               the LIGHTER on a small table and moves over to a PAINTING on the\n               wall. Daniel stops at one, removes a pen knife and starts to cut\n               the canvas from the frame.\n               Daniel rolls up the canvas.\n\n               \n\n                                                                          2.\n\n               \n\n                                          DANIEL\n                          Let's go.\n\n               Julien starts to pick up the ZIPPO.\n\n                                       DANIEL\n                          Be careful it's...\n\n               Too Late! Julien has already picked it up. It burns his hand ans\n               he flicks it away. It flies through the air and lands in the corner\n               of the room. The CURTAINS catch on fire.\n\n                                          DANIEL\n                          ... hot!\n\n               Julien panics! He grabs the canvas out of Daniel's hand and begins\n               beating the flames with it. Daniel looks at him with disbelief.\n               Julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames. He\n               turns to Daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the\n               fire, but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire. A beat.\n               Julien sees the flames and puts them out. Daniel just stares at\n               him. He opens the canvas. The painting is ruined.\n\n               \n\n               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT\n\n               A Mercedes parks in front of the Peugeot, boxing it in between it\n               and a car behind it. The DRIVER gets out and walks away.\n\n               \n\n               INT. HOUSE FOYER -- NIGHT\n\n               Daniel and Julien move through the darkness.\n\n                                       DANIEL\n                          Light your lighter. I can't see\n                          anything... and try not to burn down\n                          the house!\n\n               Julien remove a lighter and presses it. The entire room fills\n               with light. Julien stares at the flame amazed.\n\n                                          OLD MAN'S VOICE\n                          Don't move!\n\n               They turn to see an old man standing at the top of the stairs in\n               his bathrobe. He is frail, his face pasty white. He is holding a\n               very long, double-barrel shotgun.\n               Julien looks to Daniel with a 'what now' expression. The old man\n               slowly moves down the stairs. He loses his balance and falls down\n               the stairs, tumbling head over heals until he reaches the bottom.\n               Daniel and Julien stare at the old man who is sprawled out on the\n               floor, motionless.\n\n                                          JULIEN\n                          Is he dead?\n\n                                          DANIEL\n                          I don't know.     He looks dead.\n\n               \n\n                                                                            3.\n\n               \n\n                                       JULIEN\n                          He looked dead before he fell.\n\n               The old man groans, then opens his eyes.    He grabs his shotgun.\n               Daniel and Julien run to the door.\n\n               \n\n               EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\n               Daniel and Julien run towards the street.\n\n                                       DANIEL\n                          Start the car! Start the car!\n\n               Raymond starts the engine.   Daniel and Julien rush across the street\n               and get in the back seat.\n               Raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between\n               the Mercedes in front and the car behind. Like a pinball stuck\n               between two bumpers the Peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth.\n\n               \n\n               INT. PEUGEOT -- CONTINUOUS\n\n               Daniel and Julien stare angrily ar Raymond.\n\n                                       JULIEN\n                          You didn't think to move the car before\n                          we came out!\n\n               Daniel looks out his window and sees...\n               DANIEL'S POV -- the old man runs out of his house with his shotgun\n               and heads towards the car.\n               Raymond is desperately trying to get the car free. They all slide\n               down as the old man fires. The windows on the left side of the\n               car shatter.\n\n                                       DANIEL\n                          Raymond, get us out of here!\n\n               Raymond pops up and returns to getting the car out as the old man\n               opens the breach of the shotgun to reload..\n               Raymond floors the Peugeot keeping his foot on the brake. The\n               engine revs. He turns the wheel to the left and releases the brake.\n               The Peugeot juts forward smashing into the rear of the Mercedes\n               and pushing in out into the street. Before the old man can take\n               aim the Peugeot is speeding down the street.\n\n               \n\n               INT. PEUGEOT -- MOVING -- NIGHT\n\n               Raymond bites his lip nervously as he drives.    Julien finds the\n               whole thing amusing. Daniel leans forward.\n\n                                       DANIEL\n                               (to Raymond)\n                          You know what makes a good get away\n                          driver?\n                                       (More)\n\n               \n\n                                                                          4.\n\n               \n                                       DANIEL (Cont'd)\n                               (controlled anger)\n                          Being able to get away!\n\n                                       RAYMOND\n                          You're always pointing out my negative\n                          qualities. My analyst says positive\n                          reinforcement is a much more productive\n                          way of relating with people.\n\n                                       JULIEN\n                          Fine. Raymond, we'd like to commend you\n                          on how well you fucked up tonight.\n\n               \n\n               EXT. STREET, PARIS -- DAY\n\n               A narrow street. Daniel carries the cardboard tube as he walks\n               with Julien and Raymond. They enter a WAREHOUSE.\n\n               \n\n               INT. BASTALDI'S OFFICE -- DAY\n\n               Two large desks are lined up face to face. One is empty. The\n               other is occupied by LAURANT BASTALDI, 40's, all business. Off to\n               the side is MARCEL BUROT, 40's. Daniel, Julien and Raymond enter.\n               As they approach the desk Daniel glances at Marcel who is staring\n               at him.\n\n                                        MARCEL\n                               (amused)\n                          I heard you almost got your ass blown\n                          off last night. Some thief. A regular\n                          black panther.\n\n               Marcel glances at Bastaldi to see if he appreciates his comments.\n\n                                        RAYMOND\n                          A Black Panther was a member of an African\n                          American militant group in the sixties,\n                          Marcel. I think you're referring to The\n                          Pink Panther.\n\n                                       MARCEL\n                          Pink panther, black panther. Who gives\n                          a shit? And I don't remember asking you\n                          a God Damn thing, you little turd.\n\n                                       RAYMOND\n                          There's no reason to be abusive. You're\n                          projecting your anger on me as a defense\n                          mechanism.\n\n                                       MARCEL\n                          What the hell is he talking about?\n\n                                       RAYMOND\n                          I'm talking about human beings\n                          communicating openly and honestly.\n\n               \n\n                                                                             5.\n\n               \n\n                                       MARCEL\n                          How about getting on your knees and\n                          communicating with my dick?\n\n                                       BASTALDI\n                          Shut up! Both of you!    You're giving me\n                          a fuckin' headache.\n\n               A beat. Raymond and Marcel stare at one another.     We HEAR a muffled\n               GROANING SOUND in the b.g.\n\n                                       DANIEL\n                          Where's your brother?\n\n                                       BASTALDI\n                          Vincent's in the States on business.\n                               (a beat; referring to\n                                the painting)\n                          That it?\n\n               Daniel lays the cardboard tube containing the painting on the desk.\n               Bastaldi removes the painting. To him it is not a work of art,\n               just a commodity to be sold. He opens his desk drawer, removes\n               several large stacks of money and hands them to Daniel.\n\n                                        BASTALDI\n                          Okay.   Now I've got something I want to --\n\n               We HEAR the groaning sound again. Bastaldi looks irritated. He\n               gets up and walks over to a closet. He opens to the doors to reveal\n               a man in his underwear, his wrists tied behind his back, his mouth\n               taped shut. A wire noose is around his neck forcing him to stand\n               on his tip toes to avoid hanging himself.\n\n                                       BASTALDI\n                          Do you mind? I'm trying to do some\n                          business here.\n\n               The man looks at Bastaldi through pleading eyes and mumbles\n               something.\n\n                                       BASTALDI\n                          One more sound out of you and I'm going\n                          to cut your fuckin' tongue out.\n\n               Bastaldi closes the door.   Daniel looks at him inquisitively.\n\n                                       BASTALDI\n                          You take someone in.

NOTRE DAME -- DAY\n\n               The plaza is filled with tourists. Moving through the crowd is\n               SAMI ZERHOUNI, Algerian, late 20's, a small time street hustler,\n               dressed in jeans and a \"I Love Paris\" tee-shirt. He passes a\n               MAN who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet.\n               Sami moves on. He sees two overweight women standing at a\n               vendor's cart, holding a large wad of MONEY. The woman puts the\n               cash back in her purse, but does not zip it up.\n               Sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse. She\n               zips the bag closed. Sami's face fills with pain as the zipper\n               catches the hair of his arm. The women walk towards the\n               cathedral. Sami has no choice but follow after them. He tries\n               to match their pace so he doesn't alert them of his presence.\n               The woman looks back and sees Sami's hand. She pulls her bag\n               away, ripping a section of hair off his arm, then swings the\n               bag, putting all of her weight behind it. It hits Sami squarely\n               in the face. He lands on his back with a thud. WALLETS and\n               BILLFOLDS fly out from every one of his pockets.\n               He staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when\n               he sees...\n\n               HIS POV -- ACROSS THE PLAZA:    of two police officers moving\n               towards him .\n               He knows he has no more time.    He takes off running, disappearing\n               into the crowd.\n\n               \n\n                                                                           8.\n\n               \n\n               INT. CAFE -- LATIN QUARTER -- DAY\n\n               Sami is at the bar. He sees Marcel enter and runs towards the\n               back. Standing in his way is one of Marcel's MEN. Sami turns\n               around as Marcel approaches and forces a smile.\n               NOTE:   All dialogue is now in English unless otherwise noted.\n\n                                        MARCEL\n                           Going somewhere?\n\n                                       SAMI\n                           Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody\n                           else. If I knew it was you I would have\n                           never run.\n\n               A long, awkward beat as Marcel just glares at him.\n\n                                        SAMI\n                           You're probably here for the money I owe\n                           you.\n                                (off Marcel's nod)\n                           I don't have it.\n               Marcel opens the door to the bathroom and pushes Sami inside.\n\n               \n\n               INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY\n\n               Marcel closes the door.   He is face to face with Sami.\n\n                                        SAMI\n                           You know this is how rumors get started.\n\n               Marcel punches Sami in the stomach. He drops to his knees. A\n               beat. The door to the bathroom opens and the LARGE MAN peers\n               inside. He stares awkwardly at what he perceives as the beginning\n               of a sexual act.\n\n                                         SAMI\n                           Told you.\n\n               Marcel slams the door then grabs Sami by the ear and yanks him to\n               his feet.\n\n                                        MARCEL\n                           Today's your lucky day, Sami.\n\n                                        SAMI\n                                (breathlessly)\n                           Yeah, I can see that.\n\n                                        MARCEL\n                           Normally I'd be breaking your fingers\n                           right now, but I'm going to give you a\n                           chance to make enough to pay me back and\n                           have some extra for yourself.

ZERO enters. No one knows his last name. He is\n               40's, blonde hair, leather jacket, black pants. Looks more like a\n               rock-star than a criminal. His eyes are flat and there is an\n               intensity about him that is unnerving. Zero casually nods to\n               Daniel. Zero stares at Sami as Daniel leads him over.\n\n                                        DANIEL\n                               (to Sami)\n                          This is Zero.\n\n                                       SAMI\n                          Hi.

One look in\n               Zero's eyes tells Sami what everyone else already knows: This is\n               not someone to fuck with.

He pushes the button returning to the Renaud\n               song and stares at Marcel. Marcel, not to be outdone returns the\n               Hallyday song. Like two children they click the buttons of the\n               radio, switching back and forth between Renaud and Hallyday.\n               Bastaldi has had enough.\n\n                                        BASTALDI\n                          Stop it!   Both of you!\n\n               He turns off the radio. A long beat. Marcel, like a child who\n               has to have the last word starts singing to himself quietly, but\n               loud enough for Zero to hear.\n\n                                       MARCEL\n                               (singing)\n                          ... que je t'aime... que je...\n               Marcel sees Bastaldi glaring at him and stops.\n\n               \n\n               EXT.

STREET -- MORNING\n\n               An industrial section of the city. Empty streets. Run down\n               buildings. Graffiti filled walls and burnt out hulls of abandoned\n               cars line the street. The taxi driver leans out his window.\n\n                                       TAXI DRIVER\n                          Are you sure you guys have the right\n                          address?

Suddenly, from out of nowhere three BLACK TOUGHS\n               appear and walk over. Daniel looks behind him and sees another\n               two approaching from the rear. Zero calmly sits down on one of\n               the suitcases.\n\n                                       SAMI\n                          Let me handle this.\n\n               LAMAR, 30's, the leader of the group steps forward.\n\n                                          SAMI\n                          Hey, brother.

It is opened by a\n               very large man... a biker type, leather jacket, full beard, several\n               long earrings hanging from his ear.

He walks over to a chair and sits down, his\n               head hung down, embarrassed. Marcel is angered by this. He glances\n               over to Daniel who subtly nods to him. Marcel leaves the room.\n\n               \n\n               EXT. SIDE OF WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON\n\n               Marcel walks purposefully along the side of the building. He\n               reaches into his jacket pocket and removes two black leather gloves.\n               He slips them on as he approaches the door, then knocks. A beat.\n               The Biker opens the door.\n\n                                       BIKER\n                          Listen asshole, I told you --\n\n               Marcel head butts him, slamming his forehead into the bridge of\n               his nose. The Biker clasps his hands over his bleeding nose.\n               Marcel grabs him by the hair and rapidly punches him in face several\n               times -- each punch backing the Biker into the room.\n\n               \n\n               INT.

Marcel bends his head down, so that his attackers\n               fists slams into the hard crown of his skull.\n\n               BIKER #2 painfully grabs his broken knuckles. Marcel knees him\n               hard in the groin. BIKER #2 turns to his side and doubles over.\n               Marcel kicks the man into the back of his knee spinning him around\n               and down on his knees.\n\n               \n\n                                                                          22.\n\n               \n               In a fluid movement he elbows the man in the back of head . BIKER\n               #2 falls face forwards and is out cold.\n               Marcel turns to the third BIKER who is standing by the stereo. He\n               is smaller than the others and has seen enough. He quickly turns\n               off the power. DEAD QUIET.\n\n               \n\n               INT.

Over the flame is a tire wrench,\n               the metal tip glowing red hot. Sami opens the bag and removes\n               some white bread.\n\n                                       SAMI\n                          Anybody hungry?\n\n                                       DANIEL\n                          What'd you get?\n\n                                       SAMI\n                          Some bread and...\n\n               \n\n                                                                         89.\n\n               \n               He removes a can of cheese whiz and sprays the cheese onto the\n               bread.\n\n                                        SAMI\n                          Cheese.\n\n               All the French guys look at him as though he is from another planet.\n\n                                        DANIEL\n                          Cheese?

Sami and Raymond grimace as they think about what's about\n               to happen.\n\n                                       DANIEL\n                               (to Zero)\n                          Ready?\n\n               Zero nods. Daniel takes the bottle of Vodka and pours some over\n               the wound. Zero flinches. Daniel looks at Marcel, then releases\n               the belt. Blood flows from the wound. Marcel presses the hot\n               poker against the wound. Zero grunts, but does not scream. His\n               face contorts violently from the pain.\n\n               \n\n               INT.

The black canvas bag containing\n               the tapes is on the table. Sami removes the identical canvas bag\n               he bought at the store from under the bed and places it on the\n               table. He takes the original and leaves.\n\n               \n\n               EXT.

COTTAGE -- MORNING\n\n               Daniel enters to find Zero and Raymond still sleeping. He looks\n               at the black canvas bag on the table.

You must think I'm a\n                          real moron.\n\n               Hadley removes a small cassette player from his jacket.    He picks\n               a tape and inserts it into the player.\n\n                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE\n                          I just came by to tell that \"piece of\n                          work\" you asked for on Johnny Wicks --\n                          It's done.\n\n                                        BONANNO'S VOICE\n                          Good.

He inserts another one.\n\n                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE\n                          Angelo, we can't lean too hard on this\n                          guy.

We\n                          pay him each month to look after our\n                          interests.\n\n               Hadley grins.   This is great stuff.   He looks up at Sami.\n\n                                       AGENT HADLEY\n                          Here you go, sport.\n\n               Sami grabs the box and leaves. Hadley starts whistling a tune and\n               walks off the other way. As he reaches the tree line Lamar pops\n               out with two of his friends. All of them have guns.\n\n                                       LAMAR\n                          I'll take the bag.\n\n                                       AGENT HADLEY\n                          You don't think I see through this?     You\n                          tell Sami he's dead.\n\n               One of Lamar's guys searches through Hadley's pockets, finds his\n               gun, then takes his wallet.\n\n                                       AGENT HADLEY\n                          You're making a big mistake.    I'm an FBI\n                          agent.\n\n               Hadley stares at Lamar defiantly. Lamar cocks the hammer back on\n               his gun and presses the barrel to Hadley's forehead. Hadley drops\n               the canvas bag.\n\n               Lamar picks up the canvas bag and runs away. Hadley stands there\n               fuming. Lamar runs towards the statue and disappears behind it.\n\n               ANGLE -- BEHIND THE STATUE\n\n               \n\n                                                                           96.\n\n               \n               Daniel is waiting, holding the other black canvas bag.   As Lamar\n               passes they quickly exchange bags.\n\n               From Hadley's point of view Lamar has merely run behind the statue\n               as he heads for the street. Lamar runs a few more steps, then\n               stumbles and falls... several cassette tapes spill out of it.\n               Lamar's buddies are already at the street.\n\n                                        LAMAR'S BUDDIES\n                          C'mon, man!   Let's get out of here.\n\n               Lamar gets up, looks at the bag, pretends to be panicked.   He runs\n               off leaving the bag laying on the grass.\n\n               ON HADLEY: He can't believe his luck. He runs over, picks up the\n               loose cassettes and puts them back in the bag, then leaves.\n\n               ON DANIEL: he peers out from behind the fountain, watching as\n               Hadley walks off in the other direction.\n\n               \n\n               EXT.

HADLEY'S OFFICE -- DAY\n\n               Hadley opens the package and finds a video cassette. Hadley pops\n               the cassette into the VCR. On the screen we see Sami speaking\n               into a video camera.\n\n                                       SAMI\n                          Since we're such good pals I thought I'd\n                          sneak you an advanced copy of my latest\n                          work.

You're\n                          going to sell them.\n\n                                       AGENT HADLEY\n                          I'm going to retire with a shit-load of\n                          money. Find me a small country that\n                          doesn't have an extradition treaty with\n                          the States and live the good life.\n\n                                       SAMI\n                          You didn't have to kill Sophie.\n\n                                         AGENT HADLEY\n                          Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.\n\n               The color drains from Hadley's face.   Sami reappears, talking into\n               the camera again.\n\n                                       SAMI\n                          It's a little arty I know, but it has\n                          great content, don't you think? You\n                          were so busy looking for a wire you\n                          probably didn't even think about a video\n                          camera. It was on the statue. Anyway,\n                          I've sent a copy of the whole tape to\n                          the Chicago P.D. and the FBI. They'll\n                          get it tomorrow. If I were you I'd take\n                          the day off.\n\n               The tape turns to static. Hadley tries to think. He takes the\n               VHS tape from the machine, then picks up his phone and starts to\n               dial a number. A beat. He thinks better of it, hangs up and uses\n               his cell phone.\n\n               \n\n               INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- DAY\n\n               Eddie is on the phone.

The noise\n               is enough to push things over the edge.\n\n                                       JERRY VALE'S VOICE\n                          My love, forgive me...\n\n               Raphael goes for his gun.   All hell breaks loose! People dive for\n               cover as shots rings out.   In the close quarters it's like shooting\n               fish in a barrel.\n\n                                       JERRY VALE'S VOICE\n                          I didn't mean to have it end like this...\n\n               Eddie lifts a shotgun from behind the bar and blows away a gang\n               member. Another gang member kills him.\n               It's a massacre! Bodies drop like flies. The room is so thick\n               with smoke you can't see two feet in front of you. Finally it is\n               quiet.\n\n                                       JERRY VALE'S VOICE\n                          I didn't mean to have you fall in love,\n                          in love with me...\n\n               We move through the room, past the carnage. Smoke swirls, blood\n               covers the floor. Raphael is dead. Along with Joey \"Two Tons\"\n               and Nicky \"The Rake\" On the floor, Zammito is against the bar.\n               He sits up, amazed that he is untouched.

Through\n               the windshield he can see the smiling face of Half Tooth Tony.\n               The front of the car slams into Zammito, lifting him into the air.\n               He flips head over heals then smashes into the windshield and over\n               the car. He lays in the middle of the street, dead.\n               The Lincoln speeds off down the street.\n\n                                       JERRY VALE'S VOICE\n                          Arrivederci amore kiss me...\n\n               \n\n               INT.

He takes a few\n               steps, then stops.\n\n               BASTALDI POV -- across the street, standing side by side are Daniel,\n               Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero. They look like a ragged bunch,\n               tired, dirty. We PAN across the faces of each one of them as they\n               stare at Bastaldi.\n\n               A BUS goes by blocking Bastaldi's view of the boys.   When it passes\n               the crew it gone!\n\n               Bastaldi bites his lip nervously.    Bastaldi looks around, but there\n               is no sign of them.\n\n               \n\n               A DIFFERENT ANGLE\n               We can see the five of them crouched behind a parked car. Marcel\n               peers through the window at Bastaldi who is still trying to figure\n               out where they went. They are all amused with Bastaldi's\n               bewilderment.\n\n                                       RAYMOND\n                          What's he doing?\n\n               \n\n                                                                        105.\n\n               \n\n                                       MARCEL\n                          He's looking around for us.\n\n                                       ZERO\n                          Zero can't stay like this much longer.\n                          His leg is hurting.\n\n               Finally, Bastaldi turns around and goes back into his apartment.\n\n               \n\n               INT.

He notices something is attached to the bottom of\n               the cardboard box. It's a long thin wire that has pulled the pin\n               on an electronic device.\n\n               \n\n               EXT.

I suppose\n                          that none of you have ever made a mistake\n                          before?\n\n               No one answers him. Sami reaches inside the black canvas bag and\n               removes the autographed baseball Marcel took from Zammito.\n\n                                       SAMI\n                          This is great. After everything we've\n                          been through we've got eight hundred\n                          euros and an autographed baseball.\n\n                                       MARCEL\n                          The baseball is mine.\n\n                                       SAMI\n                          No! You can't have the baseball! You're\n                          not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!\n\n               Sami throws the baseball back in the canvas bag.\n\n                                       MARCEL\n                          I'm the one who took it.   It's my\n                          baseball!\n\n                                       ZERO\n                          If you say baseball one more time Zero\n                          will shoot you.\n\n                                       MARCEL\n                          Raymond, don't you think they're over\n                          reacting a little?\n\n                                       RAYMOND\n                          No. I think they have a right to express\n                          their anger with you in light of the\n                          fact that you're...\n                               (something in him\n                                snaps)\n\n                          A FUCKIN' MORON! HOW COULD YOU NOT CHECK\n\n                          THE MONEY, YOU GOD DAMN STUPID SHIT-HEAD!\n\n               Raymond's anger takes everyone by surprise.     Even Raymond is\n               surprised by his outburst.\n\n                                       MARCEL\n                          Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be\n                          angry... but I'm the one who took the\n                          ball and that makes it mine.\n\n                                          SAMI\n                          No.\n\n               \n\n                                                                          109.\n\n               \n\n                                       MARCEL\n                          Give it to me, Sami.\n\n                                        SAMI\n                          No!\n\n               Marcel tries to take the ball out of the bag. Sami pulls it away.\n               Marcel grabs the bag. Both of them tug on it. Marcel pulls hard\n               and the bag rips down the seam. The baseball falls out and rolls\n               off the bridge into the river.\n\n                                        SAMI\n                          Perfect.\n\n               Marcel stands there holding the inside liner of the bag.\n               Sami throws the canvas bag to the ground in frustration.\n               Something catches Daniel's attention.\n\n               DANIEL'S POV -- of the black canvas. The lining has been ripped\n               away. A light breeze blows lifting the underside of the black\n               canvas. There is a flash of color. Another gust of wind turns\n               the black canvas over. On the other side is Van Gogh's \"Vase with\n               twelve sunflowers\".\n\n               Daniel's jaw drops.   The others notice his stunned expression and\n               follow his stare.\n\n               THEIR POV -- of the priceless painting.\n               They stand there, too shocked to move at first, then rush forward.\n               They have almost reached the painting when a truck passes them.\n               The wind kicks up the painting, blowing it over the railing. They\n               reach out to grab it, but it is too far away. They stand there,\n               watching as it slowly floats down to the river below.\n\n               \n\n               EXT. BRIDGE -- WIDE SHOT -- AFTERNOON\n\n               They look at one an other, then without speaking a word they all\n               jump off the bridge.

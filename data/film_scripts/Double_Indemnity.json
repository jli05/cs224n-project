Approaching it at about thirty \n               miles per hour is a Dodge 1938 coupe. It is driven erratically \n               and weaving a little, but not out of control.\n\n               When the car is about forty feet away, the signal changes to \n               STOP. Car makes no attempt to stop but comes on through.\n\n               A-2 A LIGHT NEWSPAPER TRUCK\n\n               is crossing the intersection at right angles. It swerves and \n               skids to avoid the Dodge, which goes on as though nothing \n               had happened. The truck stops with a panicky screech of tires. \n               There is a large sign on the truck: \"READ THE LOS ANGELES \n               TIMES\". The truck driver's infuriated face stares after the \n               coupe.\n\n               A-3 THE COUPE\n\n               continues along the street, still weaving, then slows down \n               and pulls over towards the curb in front of a tall office \n               building.\n\n               A-4 THE COUPE\n\n               stops. The headlights are turned off. For a second nothing \n               happens, then the car door opens slowly. A man eases himself \n               out onto the sidewalk and stands a moment leaning on the \n               open door to support himself. He's a tall man, about thirty-\n               five years old. From the way he moves there seems to be \n               something wrong with his left shoulder.\n\n               He straightens up and painfully lowers his left hand into \n               his jacket pocket. He leans into the car. He brings out a \n               light-weight overcoat and drapes it across his shoulders. He \n               shuts the car door and walks toward the building.\n\n               A-5 ENTRANCE OF THE BUILDING\n\n               Above the closed, double-plate glass doors is lettered: \n               \"PACIFIC BUILDING\". To the left of entrance there is a \n               drugstore, closed, dark except for a faint light in the back. \n               The man comes stiffly up to the doors. (CAMERA HAS MOVED UP \n               WITH HIM). He tries the doors. They are locked. He knocks on \n               the glass. Inside, over his shoulder, the lobby of the \n               building is visible: a side entrance to the drugstore on the \n               left, in the rear a barber shop and cigar and magazine stand \n               closed up for the night, and to the right two elevators. One \n               elevator is open and its dome light falls across the dark \n               lobby.\n\n               The man knocks again. The night watchman sticks his head out \n               of the elevator and looks toward entrance. He comes out with \n               a newspaper in one hand and a half-eaten sandwich in the \n               other. He finishes the sandwich on the way to the doors, \n               looks out and recognizes the man outside, unlocks the door \n               and pulls it open.\n\n                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN\n                         Hello there, Mr. Neff.\n\n               Neff walks in past him without answering.\n\n               A-6 INT. LOBBY\n\n               Neff is walking towards elevator. Night watchman looks after \n               him, relocks door, follows to elevator. Neff enters elevator.\n\n               A-7 ELEVATOR\n\n               Neff stands leaning against wall. He is pale and haggard \n               with pain, but deadpans as night watchman joins him.\n\n                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN\n                         Working pretty late aren't you, Mr. \n                         Neff?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                              (Tight-lipped)\n                         Late enough.\n\n                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN\n                         You look kind of all in at that.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         I'm fine. Let's ride.\n\n               Night watchman pulls lever, doors close and elevator rises.\n\n                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN\n                         How's the insurance business, Mr. \n                         Neff?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Okay.\n\n                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN\n                         They wouldn't ever sell me any. They \n                         say I've got something loose in my \n                         heart. I say it's rheumatism.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                              (Scarcely listening)\n                         Uh-huh.\n\n               Night watchman looks around at him, turns away again and the \n               elevator stops.\n\n                                     NIGHT WATCHMAN\n                              (Surly)\n                         Twelve.\n\n               The door opens. Across a small dark reception room a pair of \n               frosted glass doors are lettered: PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE \n               COMPANY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE. There is a little light \n               beyond the glass doors.\n\n               Neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator, \n               across reception room to doors. He pushes them open. The \n               night watchman stares after him morosely, works lever, \n               elevator doors start to close.\n\n               A-8 TWELFTH FLOOR INSURANCE OFFICE\n\n               (Note for set-designer: Our Insurance Company occupies the \n               entire eleventh and twelfth floors of the building. On the \n               twelfth floor are the executive offices and claims and sales \n               departments. These all open off a balcony which runs all the \n               way around. From the balcony you see the eleventh floor below: \n               one enormous room filled with desks, typewriters, filing \n               cabinets, business machines, etc.)\n\n               Neff comes through the double entrance doors from the \n               reception room. The twelfth floor is dark. Some light shines \n               up from the eleventh floor. Neff takes a few steps then holds \n               on to the balcony railing and looks down.\n\n               A-9 THE ELEVENTH FLOOR FROM ABOVE - NEFF'S POINT OF VIEW\n\n               Two colored women are cleaning the offices. One is dry-mopping \n               the floor, the other is moving chairs back into position, \n               etc. A colored man is emptying waste baskets into a big square \n               box. He shuffles a little dance step as he moves, and hums a \n               little tune.\n\n               A-10 NEFF\n\n               Moves away from the railing with a faint smile on his face, \n               and walks past two or three offices (CAMERA WITH HIM) towards \n               a glass door with number twenty-seven on it and three names: \n               HENRY B. ANDERSON, WALTER NEFF, LOUIS L. SCHWARTZ. Neff opens \n               the door.\n\n               A-11 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - DARK\n\n               Three desks, filing cabinets, one typewriter on stand, one \n               dictaphone on fixed stand against wall with rack of records \n               underneath, telephones on all three desks. Water cooler with \n               inverted bottle and paper cup holder beside it. Two windows \n               facing toward front of building. Venetian blinds. No curtains. \n               Waste basket full, ash trays not emptied. The office has not \n               been cleaned.\n\n               Neff enters, switches on desk lamp. He looks across at dicta \n               phone, goes heavily to it and lifts off the fabric cover. He \n               leans down hard on the dictaphone stand as if feeling faint. \n               He turns away from dictaphone, takes a few uncertain steps \n               and falls heavily into a swivel chair. His head goes far \n               back, his eyes close, cold sweat shows on his face. For a \n               moment he stays like this, exhausted, then his eyes open \n               slowly and look down at his left shoulder. His good hand \n               flips the overcoat back, he unbuttons his jacket, loosens \n               his tie and shirt. This was quite an effort. He rests for a \n               second, breathing hard. With the help of his good hand he \n               edges his left elbow up on the arm-rest of the chair, supports \n               it there and then pulls his jacket wide. A heavy patch of \n               dark blood shows on his shirt. He pushes his chair along the \n               floor towards the water cooler, using his feet and his right \n               hand against the desk, takes out a handkerchief, presses \n               with his hand against the spring faucet of the cooler, soaks \n               the handkerchief in water and tucks it, dripping wet, against \n               the wound inside his shirt. Next, he gets a handful of water \n               and splashes it on his face. The water runs down his chin \n               and drips. He breathes heavily, with closed eyes. He fingers \n               a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket, pulls it out, looks \n               at it. There is blood on it. He wheels himself back to the \n               desk and dumps the loose cigarettes out of the packet. Some \n               are blood-stained, a few are clean. He takes one, puts it \n               between his lips, gropes around for a match, lights cigarette. \n               He takes a deep drag and lets smoke out through his nose.\n\n               He pulls himself toward dictaphone again, still in the swivel \n               chair, reaches it, lifts the horn off the bracket and the \n               dictaphone makes a low buzzing sound. He presses the button \n               switch on the horn. The sound stops, the record revolves on \n               the cylinder. He begins to speak:\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Office memorandum, Walter Neff to \n                         Barton Keyes, Claims Manager. Los \n                         Angeles, July 16th, 1938. Dear Keyes: \n                         I suppose you'll call this a \n                         confession when you hear it. I don't \n                         like the word confession. I just \n                         want to set you right about one thing \n                         you couldn't see, because it was \n                         smack up against your nose. You think \n                         you're such a hot potato as a claims \n                         manager, such a wolf on a phoney \n                         claim. Well, maybe you are, Keyes, \n                         but let's take a look at this \n                         Dietrichson claim, Accident and Double \n                         Indemnity. You were pretty good in \n                         there for a while, all right. You \n                         said it wasn't an accident. Check. \n                         You said it wasn't suicide. Check. \n                         You said it was murder. Check and \n                         double check. You thought you had it \n                         cold, all wrapped up in tissue paper, \n                         with pink ribbons around it. It was \n                         perfect, except that it wasn't, \n                         because you made a mistake, just one \n                         tiny little mistake. When it came to \n                         picking the killer, you picked the \n                         wrong guy, if you know what I mean. \n                         Want to know who killed Dietrichson? \n                         Hold tight to that cheap cigar of \n                         yours, Keyes. I killed Dietrichson. \n                         Me, Walter Neff, insurance agent, 35 \n                         years old, unmarried, no visible \n                         scars --\n                              (He glances down at \n                              his wounded shoulder)\n                         Until a little while ago, that is. \n                         Yes, I killed him. I killed him for \n                         money -- and a woman -- and I didn't \n                         get the money and I didn't get the \n                         woman. Pretty, isn't it?\n\n               He interrupts the dictation, lays down the horn on the desk. \n               He takes his lighted cigarette from the ash tray, puffs it \n               two or three times, and kills it. He picks up the horn again.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                              (His voice is now \n                              quiet and contained)\n                          It began last May. About the end of \n                         May, it was. I had to run out to \n                         Glendale to deliver a policy on some \n                         dairy trucks. On the way back I \n                         remembered this auto renewal on Los \n                         Feliz. So I decided to run over there. \n                         It was one of those Calif. Spanish \n                         houses everyone was nuts about 10 or \n                         15 years ago. This one must have \n                         cost somebody about 30,000 bucks -- \n                         that is, if he ever finished paying \n                         for it.\n\n               As he goes on speaking, SLOW DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               A-12 DIETRICHSON HOME - LOS FELIZ DISTRICT\n\n               Palm trees line the street, middle-class houses, mostly in \n               Spanish style. Some kids throwing a baseball back and forth \n               across a couple of front lawns. An ice cream wagon dawdles \n               along the block. Neff's coupe meets and passes the ice cream \n               wagon and stops before one of the Spanish houses. Neff gets \n               out. He carries a briefcase, his hat is a little on the back \n               of his head. His movements are easy and full of ginger. He \n               inspects the house, checks the number, goes up on the front \n               porch and rings the bell.\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         It was mid-afternoon, and it's funny, \n                         I can still remember the smell of \n                         honeysuckle all along that block. I \n                         felt like a million.

A maid, \n               about forty-five, rather slatternly, opens the door.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Mr. Dietrichson in?\n\n                                     MAID\n                         Who wants to see him?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         The name is Neff.

A \n               wrought-iron staircase curves down from the second floor. A \n               fringed Mexican shawl hangs down over the landing. A large \n               tapestry hangs on the wall. Downstairs, the dining room to \n               one side, living room on the other side visible through a \n               wide archway. All of this, architecture, furniture, \n               decorations, etc., is genuine early Leo Carrillo period. \n               Neff has edged his way in past maid who still holds the door \n               open.\n\n                                     MAID\n                         Listen, Mr. Dietrichson's not in.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         How soon do you expect him?\n\n                                     MAID\n                         He'll be home when he gets here, if \n                         that's any help to you.\n\n               At this point a voice comes from the top of the stairs.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         What is it, Nettie?

She is in her early \n               thirties. She holds a large bath-towel around her very \n               appetizing torso, down to about two inches above her knees. \n               She wears no stockings, no nothing. On her feet a pair of \n               high-heeled bedroom slippers with pom-poms.

He speaks to the maid \n               while still looking up.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Where would the living room be?\n\n                                     MAID\n                         In there, but they keep the liquor \n                         locked up.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         That's okay.

Maid goes off the other way.\n\n               A-25 LIVING ROOM\n\n               Neff comes into the room and throws his briefcase on the \n               plush davenport and tosses his hat on top of it. He looks \n               around the room, then moves over to a baby grand piano with \n               a sleazy Spanish shawl dangling down one side and two cabinet \n               photographs standing in a staggered position on top. Neff \n               glances them over: Mr. Dietrichson, age about fifty-one, a \n               big, blocky man with glasses and a Rotarian look about him; \n               Lola Dietrichson, age nineteen, wearing a filmy party dress \n               and a yearning look in her pretty eyes. Neff walks away from \n               the piano and takes a few steps back and forth across the \n               rug. His eyes fall on a wrinkled corner. He carefully \n               straightens it out with his foot. His back is to the archway \n               as he hears high heels clicking on the staircase. He turns \n               and looks through the arch.\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         The living room was still stuffy \n                         from last night's cigars. The windows \n                         were closed and the sunshine coming \n                         in through the Venetian blinds showed \n                         up the dust in the air. The furniture \n                         was kind of corny and old-fashioned, \n                         but it had a comfortable look, as if \n                         people really sat in it. On the piano, \n                         in couple of fancy frames, were Mr. \n                         Dietrichson and Lola, his daughter \n                         by his first wife They had a bowl of \n                         those little red goldfish on the \n                         table behind the davenport, but, to \n                         tell you the truth, Keyes, I wasn't \n                         a whole lot interested in goldfish \n                         right then, nor in auto renewals, \n                         nor in Mr. Dietrichson and his \n                         daughter Lola. I was thinking about \n                         that dame upstairs, and the way she \n                         had looked at me, and I wanted to \n                         see her again, close, without that \n                         silly staircase between us.\n\n               A-26 STAIRCASE (FROM NEFF'S POINT OF VIEW)\n\n               Phyllis Dietrichson is coming downstairs. First we see her \n               feet, with pom-pom slippers and the gold anklet on her left \n               ankle. CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY as she descends, until we \n               see all of her. She is wearing a pale blue summer dress.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS' VOICE\n                         I wasn't long, was I?\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.\n\n               CAMERA PULLS BACK WITH HER INTO THE LIVING ROOM.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         I hope I've got my face on straight.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         It's perfect for my money.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                              (Crossing to the mirror \n                              over the fireplace)\n                         Won't you sit down, Mr. -- Neff is \n                         the name, isn't it?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         With two f's, like in Philadelphia. \n                         If you know the story.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         What story?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         The Philadelphia story.

He turns away impatiently, paces \n               up and down past a caddy bag with golf clubs in it, pulls \n               one out at random, makes a couple of short swings, throws \n               the club on the couch, paces again.\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                              (Continuing)\n                         It had begun to rain outside and I \n                         watched it get dark and didn't even \n                         turn on the light.

A low glass-and-\n               china cabinet is built between the dinette and kitchen, \n               leaving a space like a doorway. The kitchen is the usual \n               apartment house kitchen, with stove, ice-box, sink, etc. It \n               is quite small.\n\n               Neff goes to the ice-box and Phyllis drifts in after him.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Soda?\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Plain water, please.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Get a couple of glasses, will you.\n\n               He points at the china closet. He has taken a tray of ice \n               cubes from the refrigerator and is holding it under the hot-\n               water faucet.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         You know, about six months ago a guy \n                         slipped on the soap in his bathtub \n                         and knocked himself cold and drowned. \n                         Only he had accident insurance. So \n                         they had an autopsy and she didn't \n                         get away with it.\n\n               Phyllis has the glasses now. She hands them to him. He dumps \n               some ice cubes into the glasses.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Who didn't?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         His wife.\n\n               He reaches for the whiskey bottle on top of the china closet.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         And there was another case where a \n                         guy was found shot and his wife said \n                         he was cleaning a gun and his stomach \n                         got in the way. All she collected \n                         was a three-to-ten stretch in \n                         Tehachapi.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Perhaps it was worth it to her.\n\n               Neff hands her a glass.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         See if you can carry this as far as \n                         the living room.\n\n               They move back toward the living room.\n\n               A-46 LIVING ROOM\n\n               Phyllis and Neff go toward the davenport. She is sipping her \n               drink and looking around.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         It's nice here, Walter.

The rest I get at the \n                         corner drugstore.\n\n               They sit on the davenport, fairly close together.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         It sounds wonderful.

When she \n                         died, he was all broken up.

He keeps \n                         me shut up. He's always been mean to \n                         me. Even his life insurance all goes \n                         to that daughter of his.

I \n                         never did. Not even when he gets \n                         drunk and slaps my face.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Only sometimes you wish he was dead.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Perhaps I do.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         And you wish it was an accident, and \n                         you had that policy. For fifty \n                         thousand dollars.

He was drunk again. When we \n                         got into the garage he just sat there \n                         with his head on the steering wheel \n                         and the motor still running. And I \n                         thought what it would be like if I \n                         didn't switch it off, just closed \n                         the garage door and left him there.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         I'll tell you what it would be like, \n                         if you had that accident policy, and \n                         tried to pull a monoxide job. We \n                         have a guy in our office named Keyes. \n                         For him a set-up like that would be \n                         just like a slice of rare roast beef. \n                         In three minutes he'd know it wasn't \n                         an accident. In ten minutes you'd be \n                         sitting under the hot lights. In \n                         half an hour you'd be signing your \n                         name to a confession.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         But Walter, I didn't do it. I'm not \n                         going to do it.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Not if there's an insurance company \n                         in the picture, baby. So long as \n                         you're honest they'll pay you with a \n                         smile, but you just try to pull \n                         something like that and you'll find \n                         out. They know more tricks than a \n                         carload of monkeys. And if there's a \n                         death mixed up in it, you haven't \n                         got a prayer. They'll hang you as \n                         sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar, \n                         baby.\n\n               She begins to cry.

Their heads touch, side by side, THE \n               CAMERA SLOWLY STARTS TO RECEDE as we\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               A-47 INT.

As he talks, a little cough shakes him now and \n               then.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         So we just sat there, and she kept \n                         on crying softly, like the rain on \n                         the window, and we didn't say \n                         anything. Maybe she had stopped \n                         thinking about it, but I hadn't. I \n                         couldn't. Because it all tied up \n                         with something I had been thinking \n                         about for years, since long before I \n                         ever ran into Phyllis Dietrichson. \n                         Because, in this business you can't \n                         sleep for trying to figure out the \n                         tricks they could pull on you. You're \n                         like the guy behind the roulette \n                         wheel, watching the customers to \n                         make sure they don't crook the house. \n                         And then one night, you get to \n                         thinking how you could crook the \n                         house yourself. And do it smart. \n                         Because you've got that wheel right \n                         under your hands. And you know every \n                         notch in it by heart. And you figure \n                         all you need is a plant out in front, \n                         a shill to put down the bet. And \n                         suddenly the doorbell rings and the \n                         whole set-up is right there in the \n                         room with you... Look, Keyes, I'm \n                         not trying to whitewash myself. I \n                         fought it, only maybe I didn't fight \n                         it hard enough. The stakes were fifty \n                         thousand dollars, but they were the \n                         life of a man, too, a man who'd never \n                         done me any dirt. Except he was \n                         married to a woman he didn't care \n                         anything about, and I did...\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               A-48 INT. NEFF'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM\n\n               CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY towards the davenport again. Neff sits \n               in one corner with his feet on the low table. He is smoking \n               his cigarette and staring at the ceiling. Phyllis has been \n               sitting fairly close to him.

He watches her down the corridor. Slowly \n               he closes the door and goes back into the room. He moves \n               across the window and opens it wide. He stands there, looking \n               down into the dark street. From below comes the sound of a \n               car starting and driving off. The rain drifts in against his \n               face. He just stands there motionless. His mind is going a \n               hundred miles a minute.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n                                   END OF SEQUENCE \"A\"\n\n                                       SEQUENCE \"B\"\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               B-1 INT. NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT)\n\n               Neff sits slumped in his chair before the dictaphone. On the \n               desk next to him stands a used record. The cylinder on the \n               dictaphone is not turning. He is smoking a cigarette. He \n               kills it then lifts the needle and slides off the record \n               which is on the machine and stands it on end on the desk \n               beside the other used record. He reaches down painfully to \n               take another record from the rack beneath the dictaphone, \n               looks at it against the light to make sure it has not been \n               used, then slides it into place on the machine and resets \n               the needle. He lifts the horn and resumes his dictation.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         The first thing we had to do was fix \n                         him up with that accident policy. I \n                         knew he wouldn't buy, but all I wanted \n                         was his signature on an application. \n                         So I had to make him sign without \n                         his knowing what he was signing. And \n                         I wanted a witness other than Phyllis \n                         to hear me give him a sales talk. I \n                         was trying to think with your brains, \n                         Keyes. I wanted all the answers ready \n                         for all the questions you were going \n                         to spring as soon as Dietrichson was \n                         dead.\n\n               Neff takes a last drag on his cigarette and kills it by \n               running it under the ledge of the dictaphone stand. He drops \n               the stub on the floor and resumes.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         A couple of nights later I went to \n                         the house. Everything looked fine, \n                         except I didn't like the witness \n                         Phyllis had brought in. It was \n                         Dietrichson's daughter Lola, and it \n                         made me feel a little queer in the \n                         belly to have her right there in the \n                         room, playing Chinese checkers, as \n                         if nothing was going to happen.\n\n                                                                  DISSOLVE:\n\n               B-2 A BOARD OF CHINESE CHECKERS CAMERA WITHDRAWS AND \n               GRADUALLY REVEALS THE DIETRICHSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               The checker-board is on the davenport between Phyllis and \n               Lola. Mr. Dietrichson sits in a big easy chair. His coat and \n               tie are over the back of the chair, and the evening paper is \n               lying tumbled on the floor beside him. He is smoking a cigar \n               with the band on it. He has a drink in front of him and \n               several more inside him. In another chair sits Neff, his \n               briefcase on the floor, leaning against his chair. He holds \n               his rate book partly open, with a finger in it for a marker. \n               He is going full swing.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         I suppose you realize, Mr. \n                         Dietrichson, that, not being an \n                         employee, you are not covered by the \n                         State Compensation Insurance Act. \n                         The only way you can protect yourself \n                         is by having a personal policy of \n                         your own.\n\n                                     DIETRICHSON\n                         I know all about that.

Slowly he puts the car in gear and \n               drives on. His face is tight. Behind his head, light catches \n               the metal of the zipper on the briefcase. Over the shot comes \n               the COMMENTARY:\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         She was a nice kid and maybe he was \n                         a little better than he sounded. I \n                         kind of hoped so for her sake, but \n                         right then it gave me a nasty feeling \n                         to be thinking about them at all, \n                         with that briefcase right behind my \n                         head and her father's application in \n                         it.

SUPER MARKET - (DAY)\n\n               There is a fair amount of activity but the place is not \n               crowded. Neff comes along the sidewalk into the shot. He \n               passes in front of the fruit and vegetable display and goes \n               between the stalls into the market.\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                              (Continued)\n                         ...but we couldn't be seen together \n                         any more and I had told her never to \n                         call me from her house and never to \n                         call me at my office. So we had picked \n                         out a big market on Los Feliz. She \n                         was to be there buying stuff every \n                         day about eleven o'clock, and I could \n                         run into her there. Kind of \n                         accidentally on purpose.\n\n               B-12 INT. MARKET\n\n               Neff stops by the cashier's desk and buys a pack of \n               cigarettes. As he is opening the pack he looks back casually \n               beyond the turnstile into the rear part of the market.\n\n               B-13 ROWS OF HIGH SHELVES IN MARKET\n\n               The shelves are loaded with canned goods and other \n               merchandise. Customers move around selecting articles and \n               putting them in their baskets. Phyllis is seen among them, \n               standing by the soap section. Her basket is partly filled. \n               She wears a simple house dress, no hat, and has a large \n               envelope pocketbook under her arm.\n\n               B-14 INT.

A customer \n               passes and goes on out of scene. Phyllis and Neff are now \n               very close. During the ensuing low-spoken dialogue, they \n               continue to face the shelves, not looking at each other\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Walter.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Not so loud.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         I wanted to talk to you, Walter. \n                         Ever since yesterday.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Let me talk first.

I saw him down in the oil fields. \n                         He thought he was paying for the \n                         auto insurance. The check's just \n                         made out to the company. It could be \n                         for anything.

Just a hard chair to park \n                         your pants on from nine to five. \n                         Just a pile of papers to shuffle \n                         around, and five sharp pencils and a \n                         scratch pad to make figures on, with \n                         maybe a little doodling on the side. \n                         That's not the way I see it, Walter. \n                         To me a claims man is a surgeon, and \n                         that desk is an operating table, and \n                         those pencils are scalpels and bone \n                         chisels. And those papers are not \n                         just forms and statistics and claims \n                         for compensation. They're alive, \n                         they're packed with drama, with \n                         twisted hopes and crooked dreams. A \n                         claims man, Walter, is a doctor and \n                         a blood-hound and a cop and a judge \n                         and a jury and a father confessor, \n                         all in one.\n\n               The telephone rings on Neff's desk.

Just get this: I picked \n                         you for the job, not because I think \n                         you're so darn smart, but because I \n                         thought maybe you were a shade less \n                         dumb than the rest of the outfit. I \n                         guess I was all wet. You're not \n                         smarter, Walter. You're just a little \n                         taller.\n\n               He goes out. Neff is alone. He watches the door close, then \n               turns and goes slowly to the water cooler. He fills a paper \n               cup and stands holding it. His thoughts are somewhere else. \n               After a moment he absently throws the cupful of water into \n               the receptacle under the cooler. He goes back to the desk. \n\n               He takes his rate book out of his brief case and puts it on \n               the desk. He buttons the top button of his shirt, and pulls \n               his tie right. He leaves the office, with his briefcase under \n               his arm.\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         That was it, Keyes, and there was no \n                         use kidding myself any more. Those \n                         fates I was talking about had only \n                         been stalling me off. Now they had \n                         thrown the switch. The gears had \n                         meshed. The machinery had started to \n                         move and nothing could stop it. The \n                         time for thinking had all run out. \n                         From here on it was a question of \n                         following the time table, move by \n                         move, just as we had it rehearsed. I \n                         wanted my time all accounted for for \n                         the rest of the afternoon and up to \n                         the last possible moment in the \n                         evening. So I arranged to call on a \n                         prospect in Pasadena about a public \n                         liability bond. When I left the office \n                         I put my rate book on the desk as if \n                         I had forgotten it.

I \n                         told him I had forgotten my rate \n                         book and needed some dope on the \n                         public liability bond I was figuring. \n                         I asked him to call me back.

He makes \n               notes on a pad.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         I changed into a navy blue suit like \n                         Dietrichson was going to wear. Lou \n                         Schwartz called me back and gave me \n                         a lot of figures...\n\n               B-33 NEFF\n\n               He is folding a hand towel and stuffing it into his jacket \n               pocket. He then takes a large roll of adhesive tape and puts \n               that into his pants pocket.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                              (Cont'd)\n                         I stuffed a hand towel and a big \n                         roll of adhesive tape into my pockets, \n                         so I could fake something that looked \n                         like a cast on a broken leg... Next \n                         I fixed the telephone and the \n                         doorbell, so that the cards would \n                         fall down if the bells rang. That \n                         way I would know there had been a \n                         phone call or visitor while I was \n                         away. I left the apartment house by \n                         the fire stairs and side door. Nobody \n                         saw me. It was already getting dark. \n                         I took the Vermont Avenue bus to Los \n                         Feliz and walked from there up to \n                         the Dietrichson house. There was \n                         that smell of honeysuckle again, \n                         only stronger, now that it was \n                         evening.\n\n               B-34 & B-35 INSERTS OF OPEN TELEPHONE BELL BOX (ON BASEBOARD) \n               & DOORBELL (ABOVE ENTRANCE DOOR)\n\n               Neff's hand places a small card against the bell clapper in \n               each of these.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               B-36 FIRE STAIRS, APT. HOUSE (NIGHT)\n\n               CAMERA PANS with Neff going down the stairs in his blue suit, \n               with a hat pulled down over his eyes.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               B-37 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (NIGHT) - LONG SHOT - NO \n               TRAFFIC\n\n               Some windows are lit. Neff comes into the shot and approaches \n               cautiously. He looks around and then slides open the garage \n               door.\n\n               B-38 INT. GARAGE\n\n               Neff closes the garage door. Very faint light comes in at a \n               side window. He opens the rear door of the sedan, gets in \n               and closes the door after him. The dark interior of the car \n               has swallowed him up.\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         Then I was in the garage. His car \n                         was backed in, just the way I told \n                         Phyllis to have it. It was so still \n                         I could hear the ticking of the clock \n                         on the dashboard. I kept thinking of \n                         the place we had picked out to do \n                         it, that dark street on the way to \n                         the station, and the three honks on \n                         the horn that were to be the signal... \n                         About ten minutes later they came \n                         down.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               B-39 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOUSE\n\n               The front door has opened and Dietrichson is half-way down \n               the steps. He is walking with crutches, wearing the dark \n               blue suit and a hat. The cast is on his left leg. There is \n               no shoe on his left foot. Only the white plaster shows. \n               Phyllis comes after him, carrying his suitcase and his \n               overcoat. She wears a camel's-hair coat and no hat. She \n               catches up with him.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         You all right, honey? I'll have the \n                         car out in a second.\n\n               Dietrichson just grunts. She passes him to the garage, CAMERA \n               WITH HER, and slides the door open.\n\n               B-40 INT. GARAGE\n\n               THE CAMERA IS VERY LOW INSIDE THE SEDAN, shooting slightly \n               upwards from Neff's hiding place. The garage door has just \n               been opened. Phyllis comes to the car, opens the rear door. \n               She looks down, almost INTO THE CAMERA. A tight, cool smile \n               flashes across her face. Then, very calmly, she puts the \n               suitcase and overcoat in back on the seat (out of shot). She \n               closes the door again.\n\n               B-41 EXT. GARAGE\n\n               Dietrichson stands watching Phyllis as she gets into the car \n               and drives out to pick him up. She stops beside him and opens \n               the right-hand door. Dietrichson climbs in with difficulty. \n               She helps him, watching him closely.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Take it easy, honey. We've got lots \n                         of time.\n\n                                     DIETRICHSON\n                         Just let me do it my own way. Grab \n                         that crutch.\n\n               She takes one of the crutches from him.\n\n                                     DIETRICHSON\n                         They ought to make these things so \n                         they fold up.\n\n               For a moment, as he leans his hand on the back of the seat, \n               there is danger that he may see Neff. He doesn't. He slides \n               awkwardly into the seat and pulls the second crutch in after \n               him. He closes the door. The car moves off.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               B-42 INT. CAR\n\n               Phyllis driving and Dietrichson beside her, face TOWARDS THE \n               CAMERA. Dietrichson has a partly smoked cigar between his \n               teeth. They are in the middle of a conversation.\n\n                                     DIETRICHSON\n                         Aw, stop squawkin' can't you, Phyllis? \n                         No man takes his wife along to a \n                         class reunion.

She \n                         sat in the hotel lobby for four days \n                         straight. Never even saw the guy \n                         until we poured him back on the train.\n\n               B-43 CLOSEUP ON NEFF'S FACE LOW DOWN IN THE CORNER BEHIND \n               DIETRICHSON\n\n               His face is partly covered by the edge of a traveling rug \n               which he has pulled up over him. He looks up at Dietrichson \n               and Phyllis in the front seat.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS' VOICE\n                         All right, honey.

She glances around \n               quickly. The car has reached the dark street Neff and she \n               picked out.\n\n                                     DIETRICHSON'S VOICE\n                         And I don't want to eat at their \n                         house either.

She doesn't even breathe. Her hand \n               goes down on the horn button. She honks three times.\n\n                                     DIETRICHSON'S VOICE\n                         What are you doing that for? What \n                         the --\n\n               This is as far as his voice will ever get. It breaks off and \n               dies down in a muffled groan. There are struggling noises \n               and a dull sound of something breaking. Phyllis drives on \n               and never turns her head. She stares straight in front of \n               her. Her teeth are clenched.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               B-47 PARKING SPACE ADJOINING GLENDALE STATION - NIGHT\n\n               The station is visible about sixty yards away. There is no \n               parking attendant. Ten or twelve cars are parked diagonally, \n               not crowded. The train is not in yet, but there is activity \n               around the station. Passengers and their friends, redcaps \n               and baggage men, news vendors, etc.\n\n               The Dietrichson sedan drives into the shot past CAMERA and \n               parks in the foreground at the outer end of the line, several \n               spaces from the next car, facing away from the CAMERA. Both \n               front doors are open. Phyllis gets out and from the other \n               side crutches emerge, and a man (seen entirely from behind, \n               and apparently Dietrichson) climbs out awkwardly. While he \n               is steadying himself on the ground with the crutches, Phyllis \n               has taken out Dietrichson's suitcase and overcoat. She walks \n               around the car and rolls up the right front window. She closes \n               and locks the car door. She tries the right rear door and \n               takes a last look into the dim interior of the car. Then she \n               and the man walk slowly away from the car to the end of the \n               station platform and along it toward the station building, \n               Phyllis walks several steps ahead of the man.\n\n               B-48 PHYLLIS & THE MAN - WALKING\n\n               CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM, a little to one side, so that Phyllis \n               is clearly seen but the man's face is not.\n\n                                     MAN\n                              (In a subdued voice)\n                         You handle the redcap and the \n                         conductor.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Don't worry.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Keep them away from me as much as \n                         you can.

I'm going to be \n                         back on the observation platform. \n                         I'll drop off as close to the spot \n                         as I can. Wait for the train to pass, \n                         then blink your lights twice.\n\n               Phyllis nods. They go on. Over them is heard the noise of \n               the train coming into the station and its lights are seen.\n\n               B-50 GLENDALE STATION PLATFORM\n\n               The train is just coming to a stop. The passengers move \n               forward to the tracks. Phyllis, carrying the suitcase and \n               overcoat, and Neff, still a little behind her, come TOWARDS \n               THE CAMERA. A redcap sees them and runs up. He takes the \n               suitcase out of Phyllis' hand.\n\n                                     REDCAP\n                         San Francisco train, lady?\n\n               Phyllis takes an envelope containing Dietrichson's ticket \n               from the pocket of the overcoat. She reads from the envelope.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Car nine, section eleven.

Yessum, \n                         this way please.\n\n               Phyllis hands the overcoat to the redcap, who leads her and \n               Neff towards car number nine. Neff still hangs back and keeps \n               his head down, the way a man using crutches might naturally \n               do.\n\n               B-51 EXT. CAR #9: B-52: B-53\n\n               The pullman conductor and porter stand at the steps. The \n               conductor is checking the tickets of passengers getting on. \n               The redcap leads Phyllis and Neff into the SHOT. The conductor \n               and porter see Neff on his crutches and move to help him.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         It's all right, thanks. My husband \n                         doesn't like to be helped.\n\n               The redcap goes up the steps into the car. Neff laboriously \n               swings himself up onto the box and from there up on the steps, \n               keeping his head down. Meantime, Phyllis is holding the \n               attention of the conductor and porter by showing them the \n               ticket.\n\n                                     CONDUCTOR\n                         Car nine, section eleven. The \n                         gentleman only. Thank you.\n\n               Phyllis nods and takes the ticket back. Neff has reached the \n               top of the steps. She goes up after him and gives him the \n               ticket. They are now close together.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Goodbye, honey.

There are shouts of \"ALL ABOARD\". The redcap \n               comes from inside the car.\n\n                                     REDCAP\n                         Section eleven, suh.\n\n               Phyllis takes a quarter from her bag and gives it to the \n               redcap.\n\n                                     PORTER\n                              (Shouting)\n                         All aboard!\n\n               Redcap descends.

He and \n               the conductor get on board the train. Phyllis stands there \n               waving goodbye as the train starts moving, and the porter \n               begins to close the car door. Phyllis turns and walks out of \n               the shot in the direction of the parked car.\n\n               B-54 INT.

PARLOR CAR - MOVING TRAIN\n\n               Four or five passengers are reading or writing. As Neff comes \n               through on his crutches they pull in their feet to make room \n               for him. One old lady, seeing that he is headed for the \n               observation platform, opens the door for him. He thanks her \n               with a nod and hobbles through.\n\n               B-58 OBSERVATION PLATFORM\n\n               Dark except for a little light coming from inside the parlor \n               car. The train is going at about fifteen miles an hour between \n               Glendale and Burbank. Neff has come out and hobbled to the \n               railing. He stands looking back along the rails. SUDDENLY A \n               MAN'S VOICE speaks from behind him.\n\n                                     MAN'S VOICE\n                         Can I pull a chair out for you?\n\n               Neff looks around. He sees a man sitting in the corner smoking \n               a hand-rolled cigarette. He is about fifty-five years old, \n               with white hair, and a broad-brimmed Stetson hat. He looks \n               like a small town lawyer or maybe a mining man. Neff does \n               not like the man's presence there very much. He turns to him \n               just enough to answer.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         No thanks, I'd rather stand.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         You going far?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Palo Alto.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         My name's Jackson.

I thought I'd go \n                         crazy with mine.\n\n               Neff stands silent. His mind is feverishly thinking of how \n               to get rid of Jackson.\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                         Palo Alto's a nice little town.

A pleasure.\n\n               He rises and exits into the parlor car. Neff turns slowly \n               and watches Jackson go back through the car. Then he moves \n               to one side of the platform and looks ahead along the track \n               to orientate himself. He gives one last glance back into the \n               parlor car to make sure no one is watching him. He slips the \n               crutches from under his arms and stands on both feet. He \n               drops the crutches off the train onto the tracks, then quickly \n               swings his body over the rail.\n\n               B-59 EXT. MOVING OBSERVATION CAR - CAMERA FOLLOWING\n\n               Neff is hanging onto the railing. He looks down, then lets \n               go and drops to the right-of-way. THE CAMERA STOPS. The train \n               recedes slowly into the night. Neff has fallen on the tracks. \n               He picks himself up, rubs one knee and looks back along the \n               line of the tracks and off to one side.\n\n               B-60 DARK LANDSCAPE - RAILROAD TRACKS\n\n               Close beyond the edge of the right-of-way, the silhouette of \n               a dump shows up. Beside it looms the dark bulk of the \n               Dietrichson sedan. The headlights blink twice and go out.\n\n               B-61 NEFF\n\n               He starts running towards the car. He runs a little awkwardly \n               because of the improvised cast on his left foot.\n\n               B-62 CAR IN THE DARK\n\n               The front door opens and Phyllis steps out. She closes the \n               door and looks in the direction of the tracks. The uneven \n               steps of Neff running towards her are heard. She opens the \n               back door of the car and leans in. She pulls the rug off the \n               corpse (which is not visible) and stands looking into the \n               car, unable to take her eyes off what she sees, while at the \n               same time her hands mechanically begin to fold the rug. The \n               running steps grow louder and Neff comes into the SHOT \n               breathing hard. He reaches her.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Okay. This has to go fast. Take his \n                         hat and pick up the crutches.\n\n               Neff points back towards the tracks. He reaches into the car \n               and begins to drag out the body by the armpits. Phyllis coolly \n               reaches past him and takes the hat off the dead man's head. \n               She turns to go.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Hang on to that rug. I'll need it.\n\n               Phyllis moves out of the shot carrying the hat and rug.\n\n               B-63 NEFF\n\n               He gets a stronger hold on the dead Dietrichson and drags \n               him free of the car and towards the tracks. The corpse is \n               not seen.\n\n               B-64 PHYLLIS\n\n               She has reached the point where one of the crutches lies. \n               She picks it up and goes for the other crutch a short distance \n               away. She carries both crutches, the hat and the rug towards \n               Neff.\n\n               B-65 NEFF\n\n               He has reached the railroad tracks. The corpse is lying beside \n               the tracks, face down. Phyllis comes up to Neff. He takes \n               the crutches and the hat from her. He throws the crutches \n               beside the corpse. He takes the hat from Phyllis and tosses \n               it carelessly along the track.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Let's go. Stay behind me.\n\n               He takes the rug from her and they move back towards the \n               car, Phyllis first, then Neff walking almost backwards, \n               sweeping the ground over which the body was dragged with the \n               rug as they go.\n\n               B-66 THE CAR\n\n               They reach it together.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Get in. You drive.\n\n               She gets in. Neff sweeps the ground after him as he goes \n               around the car to get in beside her. He throws the rug into \n               the back of the car.\n\n               B-67 INT. CAR\n\n               Phyllis is behind the wheel. Neff beside her is just closing \n               the door. He props his wrapped foot against the dashboard \n               and begins to tear off the adhesive tape while at the same \n               time Phyllis presses the starter button. The starter grinds, \n               but the motor doesn't catch. She tries again. It still doesn't \n               catch. Neff looks at her. She tries a third time. The starter \n               barely turns over. The battery is very low.\n\n               Phyllis leans back. They stare at each other desperately. \n               After a moment Neff bends forward slowly and turns the \n               ignition key to the OFF position. He holds his left thumb \n               poised over the starter button. There is a breathless moment. \n               Then he presses the starter button with swift decision. The \n               starter grinds with nerve-wracking sluggishness. Neff twists \n               the ignition key to ON and instantly pulls the hand-throttle \n               wide open. With a last feeble kick of the starter, the motor \n               catches and races. He eases the throttle down and slides \n               back into his place. They look at each other again. The \n               tenseness of the moment still shows in their faces.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Let's go, baby.\n\n               Phyllis releases the hand brake and puts the car in reverse. \n               Neff is again busy unwrapping the tape from his leg.

SEDAN - DRIVING ALONG HIGHWAY IN TRAFFIC\n\n               Phyllis and Neff facing towards CAMERA. Neff is bent over, \n               peeling the towel and plaster off his foot, which is out of \n               shot. Phyllis is calm, almost relaxed. Neff straightens up. \n               They are talking to each other. Their lips are seen moving \n               but what they say is not heard. They stop talking. Phyllis \n               stares straight ahead. Neff is pulling adhesive tape off the \n               wrapped towel that was on his foot. He folds the adhesive \n               into a tight ball, rolls the towel up, puts both into his \n               pockets.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         On the way back we went over once \n                         more what she was to do at the \n                         inquest, if they had one, and about \n                         the insurance, when that came up.

NIGHT - ELECTRIC LIGHTS ON\n\n               Neff comes from the bedroom, wearing the light grey suit he \n               wore before the murder, only with out a tie. He buttons his \n               jacket, looks around the room, and opens the corridor door.\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         I changed the blue suit. There was \n                         one last thing to do.

Charlie, the attendant \n               has washed Neff's car and is now polishing the glass and \n               metal work. Neff comes from the elevator. Charlie sees him. \n               He straightens up.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         You going to need it after all, Mr. \n                         Neff?

Just walking \n                         down to the drug store for something \n                         to eat. Been working upstairs all \n                         evening. My stomach's getting sore \n                         at me.\n\n               He walks up the ramp towards the garage entrance.\n\n               B-76 STREET OUTSIDE APT. HOUSE - (NIGHT) - SHOOTING TOWARDS \n               GARAGE ENTRANCE\n\n               Neff comes out at the top of the ramp and starts to walk \n               down the street, not too fast. CAMERA PRECEDES HIM. He walks \n               about ten or fifteen yards. At first his steps sound hard \n               and distinct on the sidewalk and echo in the deserted street. \n               But slowly, as he goes on, they fade into utter silence. He \n               walks a few feet without sound, then becomes aware of the \n               silence. He stops rigidly and looks back. CAMERA STOPS WITH \n               HIM. He stands like that for a moment, then turns toward the \n               CAMERA again. There is a look of horror on his face now. He \n               walks on, CAMERA AHEAD OF HIM again. Still his steps make no \n               sound.\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         That was all there was to it. Nothing \n                         had slipped, nothing had been \n                         overlooked, there was nothing to \n                         give us away. And yet, Keyes, as I \n                         was walking down the street to the \n                         drug store, suddenly it came over me \n                         that everything would go wrong. It \n                         sounds crazy, Keyes, but it's true, \n                         so help me: I couldn't hear my own \n                         footsteps. It was the walk of a dead \n                         man.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n                                   END OF SEQUENCE \"B\"\n\n                                       SEQUENCE \"C\"\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               C-1 NEFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n               Neff sits before the dictaphone. There are four cylinders on \n               end on the desk next to him. He gets up from the swivel chair \n               with great effort and stands a moment unsteadily. The wound \n               in his shoulder is paining him. He is very weak as he slowly \n               crosses to the water cooler. He takes the blood stained \n               handkerchief from inside his shirt and soaks it with fresh \n               water.\n\n               The office door opens behind him. He turns, hiding the \n               handkerchief behind his back. In the doorway stands the \n               colored man who has been cleaning up downstairs. He is \n               carrying his big trash box by a rope handle.\n\n                                     COLORED MAN\n                         Didn't know anybody was here, Mr. \n                         Neff.

Neff puts the soaked handkerchief back on his \n               wounded shoulder, then walks heavily over to his swivel chair \n               and lowers himself into it. He takes the dictaphone horn and \n               speaks into it again.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         That was the longest night I ever \n                         lived through, Keyes, and the next \n                         day was worse, when the story broke \n                         in the papers, and they were talking \n                         about it at the office, and the day \n                         after that when you started digging \n                         into it. I kept my hands in my pockets \n                         because I thought they were shaking, \n                         and I put on dark glasses so people \n                         couldn't see my eyes, and then I \n                         took them off again so people wouldn't \n                         get to wondering why I wore them. I \n                         was trying to hold myself together, \n                         but I could feel my nerves pulling \n                         me to pieces....\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               C-2 INSURANCE OFFICE - TWELFTH FLOOR - DAY\n\n               Neff comes through the reception room doors with his hat on \n               and his briefcase under his arm. He walks towards his office, \n               but half way there he runs into Keyes. Keyes is wearing his \n               vest and hat, no coat. He is carrying a file of papers and \n               smoking a cigar.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         Come on, Walter.

Let us examine this so-\n                         called accident. First, your husband \n                         takes out this policy in absolute \n                         secrecy. Why?

Next, he goes on \n                         this trip entirely alone. He has to \n                         be alone. He hobbles all the way out \n                         to the observation platform, very \n                         unlikely with his leg in a cast, \n                         unless he has a very strong reason. \n                         Once there, he finds he is not alone. \n                         There is a man there. What was his \n                         name, Keyes?\n\n               Norton flips his fingers impatiently at Keyes who doesn't \n               even bother to look up.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         His name was Jackson.

And then he is alone. \n                         And then he does it. He jumps. \n                         Suicide. In which case the company \n                         is not liable.\n                              (Pause)\n                         You know that, of course.

I said we \n                         could go to court. I didn't say we \n                         want to. Not only is it against our \n                         practice, but it would involve a \n                         great deal of expense, a lot of \n                         lawyers, a lot of time, perhaps years.\n\n               Phyllis rises coldly.\n\n                                     NORTON\n                         So what I want to suggest is a \n                         compromise on both sides.

Now you \n                         tell me you want to pay me a part of \n                         it, whatever it is. You want to \n                         bargain with me, at a time like this. \n                         I don't like your insinuations about \n                         my husband, Mr. Norton, and I don't \n                         like your methods. In fact I don't \n                         like you, Mr. Norton. Goodbye, \n                         gentlemen.\n\n               She turns and walks out. The door closes after her.

You \n                         ought to take a look at the statistics \n                         on suicide sometime.

In the front office. Come on, \n                         you never read an actuarial table in \n                         your life. I've got ten volumes on \n                         suicide alone. Suicide by race, by \n                         color, by occupation, by sex, by \n                         seasons of the year, by time of day. \n                         Suicide, how committed: by poisons, \n                         by fire-arms, by drowning, by leaps. \n                         Suicide by poison, subdivided by \n                         types of poison, such as corrosive, \n                         irritant, systemic, gaseous, narcotic, \n                         alkaloid, protein, and so forth. \n                         Suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps \n                         from high places, under wheels of \n                         trains, under wheels of trucks, under \n                         the feet of horses, from steamboats. \n                         But Mr. Norton, of all the cases on \n                         record there's not one single case \n                         of suicide by leap from the rear end \n                         of a moving train. And do you know \n                         how fast that train was going at the \n                         point where the body was found? \n                         Fifteen miles an hour. Now how could \n                         anybody jump off a slow moving train \n                         like that with any kind of expectation \n                         that he would kill himself? No soap, \n                         Mr. Norton. We're sunk, and we're \n                         going to pay through the nose, and \n                         you know it. May I have this?\n\n               Keyes' throat is dry after the long speech. He grabs the \n               glass of water out of Norton's hand and drains it in one big \n               gulp.\n\n               Norton is watching him almost stupefied. Neff stands with \n               the shadow of a smile on his face. Keyes puts the glass down \n               noisily on Norton's desk.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         Come on, Walter.\n\n               Norton doesn't move or speak. Keyes puts his hat on and \n               crosses towards the door, Neff after him. With the doorknob \n               in his hand Keyes turns back to Norton with a glance down at \n               his own shirt sleeves.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.\n\n               They go out.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               C-5 NEFF - AT DICTAPHONE - (NIGHT)\n\n               There is a tired grin on his face as he talks into the horn.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         I could have hugged you right then \n                         and there, Keyes, you and your \n                         statistics.

Neff enters with \n               his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. He switches the \n               lights on, closes the door, puts the lights on, closes the \n               door, puts the key in his pocket. At this moment the telephone \n               rings. He picks up the phone.\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         That evening when I got home my nerves \n                         had eased off.

He looks around the room and crosses to \n               lower the venetian blinds and draw the curtains. He gathers \n               up the morning paper which is lying untidily on the floor \n               and puts it in the waste-paper basket.\n\n               The door bell rings.\n\n               Neff stops in sudden alarm.

His hands are clasped \n               behind his back. There is a strange, absent-minded look in \n               his eyes.

NEFF'S APARTMENT\n\n               Phyllis has come a few steps into the room.

That \n                         was six years ago. We had a cabin \n                         there. It was winter and very cold \n                         and my mother was very sick with \n                         pneumonia. She had a nurse with her. \n                         There were just the three of us in \n                         the cabin. One night I got up and \n                         went into my mother's room. She was \n                         delirious with fever. All the bed \n                         covers were on the floor and the \n                         windows were wide open. The nurse \n                         wasn't in the room. I ran and covered \n                         my mother up as quickly as I could. \n                         Just then I heard a door open behind \n                         me. The nurse stood there. She didn't \n                         say a word, but there was a look in \n                         her eyes I'll never forget. Two days \n                         later my mother was dead.\n                              (Pause)\n                         Do you know who that nurse was?\n\n               Neff stares at her tensely.

Six months \n                         later she married him and I kind of \n                         talked myself out of the idea that \n                         she could have done anything like \n                         that.

As he comes up close to the door, he stops \n               with a startled expression on his face. On a chair beside \n               the door sits a familiar figure. He is Jackson, the man from \n               the observation platform of the train. He is wearing his \n               Stetson hat and smoking a cigar. He is studying something in \n               the file folder. Neff recognizes him immediately but Jackson \n               does not look up.

Smart and \n                         tricky and almost perfect, but --\n\n               Keyes bounces off the couch like a rubber ball.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         but, I think Papa has it all figured \n                         out, figured out and wrapped up in \n                         tissue paper with pink ribbons on \n                         it.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         I'm listening.\n\n               Keyes levels a finger at him.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         You know what? That guy Dietrichson \n                         was never on the train.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         He wasn't?\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         No, he wasn't, Walter. Look, you \n                         can't be sure of killing a man by \n                         throwing him off a train that's going \n                         fifteen miles an hour. The only way \n                         you can be sure is to kill him first \n                         and then throw his body on the tracks. \n                         That would mean either killing him \n                         on the train, or -- and this is where \n                         it really gets fancy -- you kill him \n                         somewhere else and put him on the \n                         tracks. Two possibilities, and I \n                         personally buy the second.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         You're way ahead of me, Keyes.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         Look, it was like this. They killed \n                         the guy -- the wife and somebody \n                         else -- and then the somebody else \n                         took the crutches and went on the \n                         train as Dietrichson, and then the \n                         somebody else jumped off, and then \n                         they put the body on the tracks where \n                         the train had passed. An \n                         impersonation, see. And a cinch to \n                         work. Because it was night, very few \n                         people were about, they had the \n                         crutches to stare at, and they never \n                         really looked at the man at all.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         It's fancy all right, Keyes. Maybe \n                         it's a little too fancy.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         Is it? I tell you it fits together \n                         like a watch. And now let's see what \n                         we have in the way of proof. The \n                         only guy that really got a good look \n                         at this supposed Dietrichson is \n                         sitting right outside my office. I \n                         took the trouble to bring him down \n                         here from Oregon. Let's see what he \n                         has to say.\n\n               Keyes goes to the door and opens it.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         Come in, Mr. Jackson.\n\n               Jackson enters with the file folder.\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                         Yes sir, Mr. Keyes.

Did \n                         you study those photographs? What do \n                         you say?\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                         Yes, indeed, I studied them \n                         thoroughly.

Tomorrow morning would suit \n                         me better. There's a very good \n                         osteopath down here I want to see \n                         before I leave.\n\n               Keyes has opened the door for Jackson.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         Okay, Mr. Jackson. Just don't put \n                         her on the expense account.\n\n               Jackson doesn't get it.\n\n                                     JACKSON\n                         Goodbye, gentlemen. A pleasure.\n\n               He goes out.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         There it is, Walter. It's beginning \n                         to come apart at the seams already. \n                         A murder's never perfect. It always \n                         comes apart sooner or later. And \n                         when two people are involved it's \n                         usually sooner. We know the \n                         Dietrichson dame is in it, and \n                         somebody else. Pretty soon we're \n                         going to know who that somebody else \n                         is. He'll show. He's got to show. \n                         Sometime, somewhere, they've got to \n                         meet. Their emotions are all kicked \n                         up. Whether it's love or hate doesn't \n                         matter. They can't keep away from \n                         each other. They think it's twice as \n                         safe because there are two of them. \n                         But it's not twice as safe. It's ten \n                         times twice as dangerous. They've \n                         committed a murder and that's not \n                         like taking a trolley ride together \n                         where each one can get off at a \n                         different stop. They're stuck with \n                         each other. They've got to ride all \n                         the way to the end of the line. And \n                         it's a one-way trip, and the last \n                         stop is the cemetery.\n\n               He puts a cigar in his mouth and starts tapping his pockets \n               for matches.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                              (Continued)\n                         She put in her claim and I'm going \n                         to throw it right back at her.\n                              (Pats his pockets \n                              again)\n                         Have you got one of those?\n\n               Neff strikes a match for him.

We \n                         just have to hold on now and not go \n                         soft inside, and stick together, \n                         close, the way we started out.\n\n               Phyllis takes his arm, forgetting where she is.

Someone's coming.\n\n               One of the market help, pushing a small hand-truck loaded \n               with packaged goods, comes along the aisle. He stops and \n               begins to restock a shelf very close to Neff and Phyllis. \n               They go off slowly in opposite directions. CAMERA PANS with \n               Neff as he walks toward another shelf, one that stands away \n               from the wall. Phyllis appears on the opposite side of the \n               shelf and stops, facing toward him. They now continue their \n               low-voiced dialogue through the piled-up merchandise.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         I loved you, Walter.

Is that what \n                         you're telling me?\n\n               Phyllis takes off her dark glasses for the first time and \n               looks at him with cold, hard eyes.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Yes. And nobody's pulling out. We \n                         went into it together, and we're \n                         coming out at the end together.

And I got to \n                         thinking what cemeteries are for. \n                         They're to put dead people in, I \n                         guess that was the first time I ever \n                         thought about Phyllis that way. Dead, \n                         I mean, and how things would be if \n                         she was dead. Because the way it was \n                         now she had me by the throat. She \n                         could hang me higher than a kite any \n                         day she felt like it. And there was \n                         nothing I could do, except hold my \n                         breath and watch that day come closer \n                         and closer, and maybe pray a little, \n                         if I still knew how to pray... I saw \n                         Lola three or four times that week. \n                         I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes, after \n                         what I had done, but it was only \n                         with her that I could relax and let \n                         go a little.

A stream of office \n               employees is coming out of an elevator; a second elevator \n               reaches the lobby and some more office employees come out, \n               among them Neff, wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase.\n\n               CAMERA PRECEDES HIM as he walks toward the entrance doors. \n               He is stopped by Keyes' voice, off to one side.\n\n                                     KEYES' VOICE\n                         Oh, Walter, just a minute.\n\n               Neff stops and looks towards the cigar counter, as he moves \n               towards him. Keyes is standing there buying cigars.

He starts tapping his pockets for a match, as \n               usual. Neff strikes a match for him.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         They give you matches when they sell \n                         you cigars, Keyes.

Neff moves \n               back into the lobby, CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. As he reaches the \n               elevator, he looks back over his shoulder, to make sure Keyes \n               is gone, then steps into the empty elevator.\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         You sure had me worried, Keyes.

The receptionist is just \n               tidying up her desk. She has her hat on and is preparing to \n               leave. Neff passes on through the swinging doors to the \n               twelfth floor balcony.\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         Upstairs, the last of the people \n                         were just leaving.\n\n               D-15 12TH FLOOR BALCONY\n\n               Neff enters from the reception room. A couple of belated \n               employees are leaving for the day. Neff goes toward Keyes' \n               office, looks around to make sure he is unobserved, enters.\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         I made sure nobody saw me go into \n                         your office.\n\n               D-16 KEYES' OFFICE (DAY)\n\n               Neff has just come in. He goes over to Keyes' desk and \n               searches the papers on it. He tries the desk drawers and \n               finds them locked. His eye falls on the dictaphone on the \n               stand beside the desk. A record is on it, the needle is about \n               two-thirds of the way towards the end. He lifts the needle \n               and sets it back to the beginning of the record, sets the \n               switch to playback position. He lifts the arm off the bracket \n               and starts the machine. Keyes' voice is heard coming from \n               the horn:\n\n                                     KEYES' VOICE\n                              (From Dictaphone)\n                         Memo to Mr. Norton.

With regard to \n                         your proposal to put Walter Neff \n                         under surveillance, I disagree \n                         absolutely. I have investigated his \n                         movements on the night of the crime, \n                         and he is definitely placed in his \n                         apartment from 7:15 P.M. on. In \n                         addition to this, I have known Neff \n                         intimately for eleven years, and I \n                         personally vouch for him, without \n                         reservation...\n\n               Neff stops the machine. He sits down slowly, still holding \n               the horn. He is deeply moved. After a moment, he presses the \n               switch again.\n\n                                     KEYES' VOICE\n                              (From Dictaphone)\n                         ...Furthermore, no connection \n                         whatsoever has been established \n                         between Walter Neff and Mrs. Phyllis \n                         Dietrichson, whereas I am now able \n                         to report that such a connection has \n                         been established between her and \n                         another man. This man has been \n                         observed to visit the Dietrichson \n                         home on the night of July 9th, 10th, \n                         11th, 12th and 13th. We have succeeded \n                         in identifying him as one Nino \n                         Zachetti, former medical student, \n                         aged twenty-eight, residing at Lilac \n                         Court Apartments 1228\u00bd N. La Brea \n                         Avenue. We have checked Zachetti's \n                         movements on the night of the crime \n                         and have found that they cannot be \n                         accounted for. I am preparing a more \n                         detailed report for your consideration \n                         and it is my belief that we already \n                         have sufficient evidence against \n                         Zachetti and Mrs. Dietrichson to \n                         justify police action. I strongly \n                         urge that this whole matter be turned \n                         over to the office of the District \n                         Attorney. Respectfully, Barton Keyes.\n\n               Neff sits, staring blankly at the wall. The cylinder goes on \n               revolving, but no more voice comes -- only the whir of the \n               needle on the empty record. At last he remembers to replace \n               the horn. He hangs it back on its hook. The machine stops. \n               Neff gets up from the chair, walks slowly to the door and \n               goes out.\n\n               D-17 12TH FLOOR, BALCONY\n\n               Neff has just come out of Keyes' office. He walks slowly \n               back towards the reception room entrance, then stands there \n               looking out through the glass doors. All the employees have \n               now left. Neff is entirely alone. He moves as if to go out, \n               then stops rigidly as his face lights up with excitement of \n               a sudden idea. He turns quickly and walks on to his own office \n               and enters.\n\n               D-18 NEFF'S OFFICE (DAY)\n\n               Neff walks across to his desk, lifts the telephone and dials \n               a number. (During the ensuing telephone conversation, only \n               what he says is heard. The pauses indicate speeches at the \n               other end of the line).\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Phyllis? Walter.

He's \n                         satisfied... Leave the door on the \n                         latch and put the lights out. No, \n                         nobody's watching the house... I \n                         told you Keyes is satisfied. It's \n                         just for the neighbors... That's \n                         what I said. Yeah. Eleven o'clock. \n                         Goodbye, baby.\n\n               Neff hangs up and stands beside the desk with a grim \n               expression on his face, takes a handkerchief out and wipes \n               perspiration from his forehead and the palms of his hands. \n               The gesture has a symbolic quality, as if he were trying to \n               wipe away the murder. Over his face comes the commentary.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         I guess I don't have to tell you \n                         what I was going to do at eleven \n                         o'clock, Keyes. For the first time I \n                         saw a way to get clear of the whole \n                         mess I was in, and of Phyllis, too, \n                         all at the same time. Yeah, that's \n                         what I thought. But what I didn't \n                         know was that she was all set for \n                         me. That she had outsmarted me again, \n                         just like she always had...\n\n               D-19 HALL STAIRWAY OF DIETRICHSON HOME (NIGHT)\n\n               The lights are turned on. Phyllis is coming down the stairs. \n               She wears white lounging pajamas, and she is carrying \n               something small and heavy concealed in a scarf in her right \n               hand. She reaches the front door, opens it slightly, fixes \n               the catch so that the door can be opened from outside. She \n               switches off the porch light and the hall light. She moves \n               towards the living room, where there is still light on.\n\n                                     NEFF'S VOICE\n                         She was all set and waiting for me. \n                         It could have been something in my \n                         voice when I called her up that tipped \n                         her off. And it could have been that \n                         she had the idea already. And an \n                         idea wasn't the only thing she had \n                         waiting for me.\n\n               D-20 LIVING ROOM\n\n               On the long table behind the davenport, one of the lamps is \n               lit. The only other light in the room is a standing lamp \n               beside the desk. A window toward the back is open, and through \n               it comes the SOUNDS OF MUSIC, probably a neighboring radio.\n\n               Phyllis enters and crosses to the table. She puts out the \n               lamp, then moves over to the desk and puts out the lamp there. \n               The room is filled with bright moonlight coming in at the \n               windows.\n\n               Phyllis crosses to the chair by the fireplace (the one she \n               sat in the first time Neff came to the house). She lifts the \n               loose cushion and puts what was in the scarf behind it. As \n               she withdraws the scarf, there is a brief glint of something \n               metallic before she covers the hidden object with the cushion \n               again.\n\n               She turns to the low table in front of the davenport and \n               takes a cigarette from the box. She takes a match and is \n               about to strike it when, just then, she hears a car coming \n               up the hill. She listens, motionless. The car stops. A car \n               door is slammed.\n\n               Calmly, Phyllis strikes the match and lights her cigarette. \n               She drops the match casually into a tray, goes back to the \n               chair, sits down and waits, quietly smoking. There are \n               footsteps outside the house.\n\n               Over the chair in which Phyllis is sitting, the hallway is \n               visible through the arch. The front door opens. Neff comes \n               in, he is silhouetted against the moonlight as he stands \n               there. He closes the door again.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                              (In foreground)\n                         In here, Walter.\n\n               Neff comes through the arch and walks slowly towards her.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Hello, baby. Anybody else in the \n                         house?\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Nobody. Why?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         What's that music?\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         A radio up the street.\n\n               Neff sits down on the arm of the davenport, close to her.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Just like the first time I was here. \n                         We were talking about automobile \n                         insurance. Only you were thinking \n                         about murder. And I was thinking \n                         about that anklet.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         And what are you thinking about now?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         I'm all through thinking. This is \n                         goodbye.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Goodbye? Where are you going?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         It's you that's going, baby. Not me. \n                         I'm getting off the trolley car right \n                         at this corner.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Suppose you stop being fancy. Let's \n                         have it, whatever it is.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         I have a friend who's got a funny \n                         theory. He says when two people commit \n                         a murder they're kind of on a trolley \n                         car, and one can't get off without \n                         the other. They're stuck with each \n                         other. They have to go on riding \n                         clear to the end of the line. And \n                         the last stop is the cemetery.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Maybe he's got something there.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         You bet he has, Two people are going \n                         to ride to the end of the line, all \n                         right. Only I'm not going to be one \n                         of them. I've got another guy to \n                         finish my ride for me.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         So you've got it all arranged, Walter.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         You arranged it for me. I didn't \n                         have to do a thing.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Just who are you talking about?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         An acquaintance of yours. A Mr. \n                         Zachetti. Come on, baby, I just got \n                         into this because I knew a little \n                         something about insurance, didn't I? \n                         I was just a sucker. I'd have been \n                         brushed-off as soon as you got your \n                         hands on the money.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         What are you talking about?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Save it. I'm telling this. It's been \n                         you and that Zachetti guy all along, \n                         hasn't it?\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         That's not true.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         It doesn't make any difference whether \n                         it's true or not. The point is Keyes \n                         believes Zachetti is the guy he's \n                         been looking for. He'll have him in \n                         that gas chamber before he knows \n                         what happened to him.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         And what's happening to me all this \n                         time?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Don't be silly. What do you expect \n                         to happen to you? You helped him do \n                         the murder, didn't you? That's what \n                         Keyes thinks. And what's good enough \n                         for Keyes is good enough for me.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Maybe it's not good enough for me. \n                         Walter. Maybe I don't go for the \n                         idea. Maybe I'd rather talk.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Sometimes people are where they can't \n                         talk. Under six feet of dirt, for \n                         instance. And if it was you, they'd \n                         just charge it up to Zachetti, \n                         wouldn't they. One more item on his \n                         account. Sure they would. That's \n                         just what they're going to do. \n                         Especially since he's coming here, \n                         tonight... Oh, in about fifteen \n                         minutes from now, baby. With the \n                         cops right behind him. It's all taken \n                         care of.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         And that'd make everything lovely \n                         for you, wouldn't it?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Right. And it's got to be done before \n                         that suit of yours comes to trial, \n                         and Lola gets a chance to sound off, \n                         and they trip you up on the stand, \n                         and you start to fold up and drag me \n                         down with you.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Listen, Walter. Maybe I had Zachetti \n                         here so they won't get a chance to \n                         trip me up. So we can get that money \n                         and be together.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         That's cute. Say it again.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         He came here the first time just to \n                         ask where Lola was. I made him come \n                         back. I was working on him. He's \n                         crazy sort of guy, quick-tempered. I \n                         kept hammering into him that she was \n                         with another man, so he'd get into \n                         one of his jealous rages, and then \n                         I'd tell him where she was. And you \n                         know what he'd have done to her, \n                         don't you, Walter.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Yeah, and for once I believe you. \n                         Because it's just rotten enough.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         We're both rotten, Walter.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Only you're just a little more rotten. \n                         You're rotten clear through. You got \n                         me to take care of your husband, and \n                         then you got Zachetti to take care \n                         of Lola, and maybe take care of me \n                         too, and then somebody else would \n                         have come along to take care of \n                         Zachetti for you. That's the way you \n                         operate isn't it, baby.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         Suppose it is, Walter. Is what you've \n                         cooked up for tonight any better?\n\n               Neff gets up from the davenport. He listens to the music for \n               a moment.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         I don't like this music anymore. \n                         It's too close. Do you mind if I \n                         shut the window?\n\n               Phyllis just stares at him. He goes quietly over to the window \n               and shuts it and draws the curtain. Phyllis speaks to his \n               back:\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                              (Her voice low and \n                              urgent)\n                         Walter!\n\n               Neff turns, something changes in his face. There is the report \n               of a gun. He stands motionless for a moment, then very slowly \n               starts towards her. CAMERA IS SHOOTING OVER HIS SHOULDER at \n               Phyllis as she stands with the gun in her hand. Neff stops \n               after he has taken a few steps.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         What's the matter? Why don't you \n                         shoot again? Maybe if I came a little \n                         closer?\n\n               Neff takes a few more steps towards her and stops again.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         How's that. Do you think you can do \n                         it now?\n\n               Phyllis is silent. She doesn't shoot. Her expression is \n               tortured. Neff goes on until he is close to her. Quietly he \n               takes the gun out of her unresisting hand.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Why didn't you shoot, baby?\n\n               Phyllis puts her arms around him in complete surrender.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Don't tell me it's because you've \n                         been in love with me all this time.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         No. I never loved you, Walter. Not \n                         you, or anybody else. I'm rotten to \n                         the heart. I used you, just as you \n                         said. That's all you ever meant to \n                         me -- until a minute ago. I didn't \n                         think anything like that could ever \n                         happen to me.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         I'm sorry, baby. I'm not buying.\n\n                                     PHYLLIS\n                         I'm not asking you to buy. Just hold \n                         me close.\n\n               Neff draws her close to him. She reaches up to his face and \n               kisses him on the lips. As she comes out of the kiss there \n               is realization in her eyes that this is the final moment.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Goodbye, baby.\n\n               Out of the shot the gun explodes once, twice. Phyllis quivers \n               in his arms. Her eyes fill with tears. Her head falls limp \n               against his shoulder. Slowly he lifts her and carries her to \n               the davenport. He lays her down on it carefully, almost \n               tenderly. The moonlight coming in at the French doors shines \n               on the anklet. He looks at it for the last time and slowly \n               turns away. As he does so, he puts his hand inside his coat \n               and it comes out with blood on it. Only then is it apparent \n               that Phyllis' shot actually did hit him. He looks at the \n               blood on his fingers with a dazed expression and quickly \n               goes out of the room, the way he came.\n\n               D-21 EXT. DIETRICHSON HOME - (NIGHT)\n\n               Neff comes out of the house. He closes the front door with \n               his right hand. His left arm hangs limp. He takes a few steps \n               down the walk, then suddenly hears somebody approaching. He \n               moves behind the palm tree near the walk.\n\n               A man comes up the steps towards the front door -- Zachetti. \n               Just as he reaches the door, Neff calls to him.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Hey you. Come here a minute. I said \n                         come here, Zachetti.\n\n               Zachetti turns and approaches him slowly.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         The name is Neff.\n\n                                     ZACHETTI\n                         Yeah? And I still don't like it. \n                         What do you want?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Look, kid, I want to give you a \n                         present.\n\n               He takes some loose change out of his pocket and holds out a \n               coin.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Here's a nice new nickel.\n\n                                     ZACHETTI\n                         What's the gag?\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Suppose you go back down the hill to \n                         a drug store and make a phone call.\n\n               Neff starts to drop the nickel into Zachetti's handkerchief \n               pocket. Zachetti knocks his hand away.\n\n                                     ZACHETTI\n                         Keep your nickel and buy yourself an \n                         ice cream cone.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         The number is Granite 0386. Ask for \n                         Miss Dietrichson. The first name is \n                         Lola.\n\n                                     ZACHETTI\n                         Lola? She isn't worth a nickel. And \n                         if I ever talk to her, it's not going \n                         to be over any telephone.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Tough, aren't you? Take the nickel. \n                         Take it and call her. She wants you \n                         to.\n\n                                     ZACHETTI\n                         Yeah? She doesn't want any part of \n                         me.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         I know who told you that, and it's \n                         not true. She's in love with you. \n                         Always has been. Don't ask me why. I \n                         couldn't even guess.\n\n               Zachetti just stares at him. Neff moves again to put the \n               nickel into Zachetti's pocket. This time Zachetti allows him \n               to do it.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Now beat it. Granite 0386, I told \n                         you.\n\n               He motions toward the street below.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         That way.\n\n               Zachetti goes slowly past him. Neff grabs him and pushes him \n               almost violently down the walk. Zachetti goes out of shot. \n               The sound of his steps dies away as Neff looks after him. \n               Then, far off in the distance, the SIREN OF A POLICE CAR is \n               heard.\n\n               Neff moves off through the shrubbery toward the side of the \n               house where he parked his car.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               D-22 NEFF'S OFFICE - (NIGHT)\n\n               The desk lamp is still lighted. Outside the windows, the \n               dawn is slowly breaking.\n\n               Neff is still clutching the horn of the dictaphone. There \n               are eight or nine used cylinders on the desk beside him. A \n               widening stain of blood shows on the left shoulder of his \n               gray jacket. He is very weak by now, and his voice holds a \n               note of utter exhaustion.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         It's almost four-thirty now, Keyes. \n                         It's cold. I wonder if she's still \n                         lying there alone in that house, or \n                         whether they've found her by now. I \n                         wonder a lot of things, but they \n                         don't matter any more, except I want \n                         to ask you to do me a favor. I want \n                         you to be the one to tell Lola, kind \n                         of gently, before it breaks wide \n                         open... Yes, and I'd like you to \n                         look after her and that guy Zachetti, \n                         so he doesn't get pushed around too \n                         much. Because...\n\n               Suddenly he stops his dictation with an instinctive feeling \n               that he is not alone in the room.\n\n               As he turns in his chair the CAMERA PULLS BACK slowly. The \n               office door is wide open. Keyes is standing a few steps inside \n               it. Behind him, on the balcony outside, stands the night \n               watchman and the colored janitor, peering curiously into the \n               room over Keyes' shoulder.\n\n               Slowly, and without taking his eyes off Neff's face, Keyes \n               reaches back and pushes the door shut.\n\n               Neff hangs up the dictaphone horn. He looks at Keyes with a \n               faint, tired grin and speaks very slowly.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Hello, Keyes.\n\n               Keyes moves towards him a few steps and stands without \n               answering.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Up pretty early, aren't you? I always \n                         wondered what time you got down to \n                         work.\n\n               Keyes, staring at him, still does not answer.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         Or did your little man pull you out \n                         of bed?\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         The janitor did.

You can't, can you? \n                         And now I suppose I get the big \n                         speech, the one with all the two-\n                         dollar words in it.

That was short anyway.\n\n               They stare at each other for a long moment, then, with intense \n               effort Neff gets up on his feet and stands there swaying a \n               little. His face is covered with sweat. His shoulder is \n               bleeding. He is on the verge of collapse.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         Walter, I'm going to call a doctor.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                              (Bitterly)\n                         What for?

So I can walk under \n                         my own power into that gas chamber \n                         up in San Quentin?

From then on you can play it \n                         any way you like. Would you do that \n                         much for me, Keyes?\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         Give me one good reason.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         I need four hours to get where I'm \n                         going.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         You're not going anywhere, Walter.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         You bet I am.

Watch me.\n\n               Neff starts to move towards the door, staggering a little, \n               holding himself upright with great effort.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                              (In a voice of stony \n                              calm)\n                         You'll never even make the elevator.\n\n               Neff has reached the door. He twists the knob and drags the \n               door open. He turns in it to look back at Keyes' implacable \n               face.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         So long, Keyes.\n\n               Neff goes out, leaving the door wide open. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS \n               his staggering walk along the BALCONY TOWARDS THE ELEVATOR \n               LOBBY. The sound of his breathing is so harsh and loud that \n               for a moment it dominates the scene. Finally he reaches the \n               swing doors leading into the lobby and starts to push them \n               open. At this moment he collapses. He clutches the edge of \n               the door and as it swings around with him he falls to the \n               floor. He tries to struggle up but cannot rise.\n\n               In background comes the sound of a telephone being dialed.\n\n                                     KEYES' VOICE\n                         Hello...

It's a police job.\n\n               There is the sound of the phone being replaced in its cradle. \n               Then there are footsteps growing louder along the balcony \n               and Keyes walks slowly into the shot. He kneels down beside \n               Neff.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         How you doing, Walter?\n\n               Neff manages a faint smile.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         I'm fine.

The handkerchief \n               drops from his hand. He gets a loose cigarette out of his \n               pocket and puts it between his lips. Then with great \n               difficulty he gets out a match, tries to strike it, but is \n               too weak. Keyes takes the match out of his hand, strikes it \n               for him and lights his cigarette.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n                                         THE END\n\n                \n\n               The following pages are for an alternate ending that director \n               Billy Wilder actually shot but later decided against.\n\n                                     KEYES\n                         They're on the way.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                              (Slowly and with great \n                              difficulty)\n                         You know why you didn't figure this \n                         one, Keyes?

Then, clutching the \n               handkerchief against his shoulder, he speaks to Keyes for \n               the last time.\n\n                                     NEFF\n                         At the end of that... trolley line... \n                         just as I get off... you be there... \n                         to say goodbye... will you, Keyes?\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n                                   END OF SEQUENCE \"D\"\n\n                                       SEQUENCE \"E\"\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               E-1 WITNESS ROOM IN DEATH CHAMBER - SAN QUENTIN (DAY)\n\n               Showing the witness room and approximately one-half of the \n               gas chamber. BOOM SHOT towards guard standing BACK TO CAMERA \n               at entrance door. Except for this guard the room is empty.\n\n               Guard opens the door. Two other guards enter, followed by a \n               group of witnesses and newspaper men, each of whom removes \n               his hat as he enters the room. They form a group around the \n               outside of the gas chamber, some looking in through the glass \n               windows, some standing in the background on low platforms \n               against the wall.\n\n               THE CAMERA SLOWLY BEGINS TO MOVE IN AND DOWN, AND CENTERS ON \n               Keyes, as he enters the room and stands behind the door. His \n               face is seen through the bars of the door, which is then \n               closed, and CAMERA MOVES TO A CLOSEUP. His eyes follow the \n               action of the closing door, then slowly look towards the gas \n               chamber.\n\n               E-2 THE GAS CHAMBER, EMPTY\n\n               On its windows show reflections of the spectators, including \n               the face of Keyes.\n\n               The door to the gas chamber opens in the background, and \n               beyond that another door opens. Neff comes in between two \n               guards. He is wearing a white open-necked shirt, blue denim \n               pants, and walks barefooted on a cocoanut matting. He moves \n               into the gas chamber, looks through the windows in the \n               direction of Keyes and nods quickly, recognizing him. The \n               guards turn him around and seat him in one of the two metal \n               chairs, with his back to the witnesses. They strap his arms, \n               legs and body to the chair. The guards go out.\n\n               E-3 THE DOOR TO THE GAS CHAMBER\n\n               It is open. The three guards come out of the gas chamber \n               into the ante-chamber, where stand the warden, executioner, \n               two doctors, the minister and the acid man, and possibly \n               several guards.\n\n               The executioner and one guard close the door. The guard spins \n               the big wheel which tightens it. The wheel at first turns \n               very quickly, then, as it tightens, the guard uses \n               considerable force to seal the chamber tight. The guard steps \n               out of the shot. The gas chamber is now sealed.\n\n               E-4 THE WITNESSES AND KEYES\n\n               They are intently watching Neff in the gas chamber.\n\n               E-5 THE ANTE-CHAMBER\n\n               The warden looks slowly around the room, sees that everyone \n               is in his proper place and that the stethoscope, which one \n               doctor holds, is connected with the outlet in the wall of \n               the gas chamber. Also that the man in charge of the acid is \n               ready. The warden makes a motion to the acid man. The acid \n               man releases the mixed acid into a pipe connecting with a \n               countersunk receptacle under Neff's chair. (This action is \n               only suggested). The warden looks at the clock, then turns \n               to the executioner and nods.\n\n               E-6 THE EXECUTIONER - MED. SHOT - CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN FROM \n               HIGH ANGLE TOWARDS EXECUTIONER\n\n               He pushes a metal lever. (This immerses the pellets of cyanide \n               in the acid under the chair.)\n\n               E-7 INT. GAS CHAMBER - MED. SHOT\n\n               CAMERA IS SHOOTING ABOVE Neff's head (just out of shot), \n               towards spectators standing outside the gas chamber, Keyes \n               in the center. Gas floats up into scene between CAMERA and \n               spectators. Keyes, unable to watch, looks away.\n\n               E-8 THE FIRST DOCTOR - CLOSE SHOT\n\n               as he listens on stethoscope connected with the gas chamber. \n               He glances at the clock above his head.\n\n               E-9 THE SECOND DOCTOR - CLOSE SHOT\n\n               He stands to right of the gas chamber door, taking notes on \n               a pad. He glances towards First Doctor (out of scene) and \n               looks through venetian blinds into the gas chamber. The acid \n               man stands near him.\n\n               E-10 THE FIRST DOCTOR\n\n               CAMERA SHOOTING FROM HIGH ANGLE TOWARDS HIM as he listens on \n               stethoscope. The doctor glances at the clock again. He takes \n               his stethoscope from his ears. He nods to the warden, This \n               indicates that the man is dead. CAMERA PANS with warden as \n               he turns to open the door connecting the ante-chamber with \n               the witness room.\n\n               E-11 THE WITNESS ROOM - LONG SHOT FROM HIGH ON BOOM DOWN ON \n               WITNESSES GROUPED AROUND GAS CHAMBER\n\n               The door connecting with the ante-chamber opens. A guard \n               comes through.\n\n                                     GUARD\n                         That's all, gentlemen, Vacate the \n                         chamber, please.\n\n               The guard withdraws and closes the door by which he entered. \n               The witnesses slowly start to file out. A guard has opened \n               the outer door. The witnesses put their hats on as they pass \n               through. A few go close to the windows of the gas chamber to \n               look in at the dead man before they leave.\n\n               All the witnesses have now left, except Keyes, who stands, \n               shocked and tragic, beyond the door. The guard goes to him \n               and touches his arm, indicating to him that he must leave. \n               Keyes glances for the last time towards the gas chamber and \n               slowly moves to go out.\n\n               E-12 CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE DEATH CHAMBER\n\n               CAMERA SHOOTING IN THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR AT KEYES, who is \n               just turning to leave. Keyes comes slowly out into the dark, \n               narrow corridor. His hat is on his head now, his overcoat is \n               pulled around him loosely. He walks like an old man. He takes \n               eight or ten steps, then mechanically reaches a cigar out of \n               his vest pocket and puts it in his mouth. His hands, in the \n               now familiar gesture, begin to pat his pockets for matches.\n\n               Suddenly he stops, with a look of horror on his face. He \n               stands rigid, pressing a hand against his heart. He takes \n               the cigar out of his mouth and goes slowly on towards the \n               door, CAMERA PANNING with him. When he has almost reached \n               the door, the guard stationed there throws it wide, and a \n               blaze of sunlight comes in from the prison yard outside.\n\n               Keyes slowly walks out into the sunshine. stiffly, his head \n               bent, a forlorn and lonely man.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\nDouble Indemnity\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0James M.

Visibly in pain, he begins dictating a confession into a Dictaphone for his friend and colleague, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), a brilliant claims adjuster. The story, told primarily in flashback, ensues.\nNeff first meets the alluring Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) during a routine house call to remind her husband (Tom Powers) that his automobile insurance policy is up for renewal. They flirt, until Phyllis asks how she could take out an accident policy on her husband's life without his knowledge. Neff deduces she is contemplating murder, and makes it clear he wants no part of it.\nHowever, he cannot get her out of his mind, and when Phyllis shows up at his own home, he cannot resist her any longer. Neff knows all the tricks of his trade and devises a plan to make the murder of her husband appear to be an accidental fall from a train that will trigger the \"double indemnity\" clause and pay out twice the policy's face value.\nAfter Dietrichson breaks his leg, Phyllis drives him to the train station for his trip to Palo Alto for a college reunion. Neff is hiding in the backseat and kills Dietrichson when Phyllis turns onto a deserted side street. Then, Neff boards the train posing as Dietrichson and using his crutches. He makes his way to the last car, the observation car, and steps outside to the open platform to supposedly smoke a cigarette. A complication ensues when he meets a passenger named Jackson (Porter Hall) there, but he manages to get the man to leave. Neff then throws the crutches on the railway tracks, then jumps off at a prearranged meeting spot with Phyllis, and drags with her Dietrichson's body on the tracks by his crutches.\nMr. Norton, the company's chief, believes the death was suicide, but Keyes scoffs at the idea, quoting statistics indicating the improbability of suicide by jumping off a slow-moving train, to Neff's hidden delight. Keyes does not suspect foul play at first, but his instincts, to which he refers as the \"little man\", pointing to his stomach, starts nagging. He wonders why Dietrichson did not file a claim for his broken leg, and deduces he did not know about the policy. He eventually concludes that Phyllis and some unknown accomplice murdered him.\nKeyes, however, is not Neff's only worry. The victim's daughter, Lola (Jean Heather), comes to him, convinced that stepmother Phyllis is behind her father's death. Lola's mother also died under suspicious circumstances, when Phyllis was her nurse. Neff begins seeing Lola, at first to keep her from going to the police with her suspicions and then because he is plagued by guilt and a sense of responsibility for her.\nKeyes brings Jackson to Los Angeles. After examining photographs of Dietrichson, Jackson is sure the man he met was not that old, but at least 15 years younger. Keyes is eager to reject the claim and force Phyllis to sue. Neff warns Phyllis not to go to court and admits he has been talking to Lola about her past. Lola eventually tells him she has discovered her boyfriend, the hotheaded Nino Zachetti (Byron Barr), has been seeing Phyllis behind her (and Neff's) back.\nWhen Keyes informs Neff that he suspects Nino of being Phyllis's accomplice (Nino has been spotted repeatedly visiting Phyllis at night), Neff sees a way out of his predicament. He arranges to meet Phyllis at her house. He informs her that he knows about her involvement with Nino, and guesses that she is planning to have the other man kill him. He tells her that he intends to kill her and put the blame on Nino. She is prepared, however, and shoots him in the shoulder. Wounded but still standing, he slowly comes closer and dares her to shoot again. She does not, and he takes the gun from her. She says she never loved him \"until a minute ago, when I couldn't fire that second shot.\" She hugs him tightly, but then pulls away when she feels the gun pressed against her. Neff says, \"Goodbye, baby,\" and shoots twice, killing her.\nOutside, Neff waits for Nino to arrive (something Neff had orchestrated). Neff advises him not to enter the house and instead go to \"the woman who truly loves you\": Lola. Nino is reluctantly convinced and leaves as told. Neff drives to his office and starts speaking into his Dictaphone, as seen at the film's opening. Keyes arrives unnoticed and hears enough to know the truth. Keyes sadly tells him, \"Walter, you're all washed up.\" Neff tells Keyes he is going to Mexico rather than face the gas chamber, but sags to the floor from his injury before he can reach the elevator. Keyes lights him a cigarette as they await the police and an ambulance."}

LAUGHTER, COLORADO - DAY\r\n\r\n          Half a dozen abandoned shacks and a boarded up gas station\r\n          make up the central hub of Laughter, Colorado. She'd be a\r\n          ghost town \u00e2\u0080\u0098cept the ghosts considered her a shithole ages\r\n          ago and baled. The buck ten for leaded sign gives us an idea\r\n          how long ago this place went dry.\r\n          Suddenly an old Chevy RIPS around the corner, wheels sending\r\n          PLUMES of dust skyward.\r\n\r\n          INT.

LAUGHTER - MAIN STREET - DAY\r\n\r\n          They race through the dusty derelict little town, peeling for\r\n          the main road in the distance when they round a corner --\r\n          --to face a \u00e2\u0080\u009870 PLYMOUTH ROADRUNNER, beat to shit, engine\r\n          screaming.

Hard.\r\n          Milton stoops, removes Passenger's wallet, digs the cash out.\r\n\r\n          OVER MILTON'S SHOULDER\r\n          Fucking Driver scrambles from behind the wheel, springs to\r\n          his feet and runs.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3.\r\n          Milton spins, BLOWS his knee apart from 20 paces.

He\r\n          got the worst of it. Looks like his face went through the\r\n          windshield. He looks up --\r\n          -- into the barrel of Milton's shotgun. A beat.\r\n\r\n                         FUCKING MIDDLE\r\n          I'll never tell you where they've\r\n          taken her...NEVER.\r\n\r\n                         MILTON\r\n          I know.\r\n          The EXPLOSION vaporizes what's left of his face.\r\n\r\n          ON FUCKING DRIVER\r\n          As he tries to stand but his lower leg dangles from a piece\r\n          of cartilage. He falls, WRITHES on the ground. He looks up\r\n          at Milton standing over him.\r\n\r\n                         FUCKING DRIVER\r\n          You...you took my leg you fuck!\r\n          Milton presses the shotgun barrel into the man's good knee.\r\n\r\n                         FUCKING DRIVER\r\n          Wait. Wait!\r\n\r\n                         MILTON\r\n          Where is she?\r\n\r\n                         FUCKING DRIVER\r\n          I...I don't...\r\n          Suddenly Fucking Passenger, flattened by the tire iron, sits\r\n          up, dazed. Sees Milton. Spots the iron. Goes for it.\r\n          Milton spins and KAFOOM!\r\n          Blows Fucking Passenger to hell.\r\n\r\n                         FUCKING DRIVER\r\n          Stillwater!

You gotta\r\n          know that. Next full moon she's\r\n          dead. Nothing you can do. She's\r\n          dead and hell will walk the earth--\r\n\r\n          WHAM!\r\n          Milton shoves the barrel of his shotgun into the man's mouth,\r\n          breaking a couple teeth in the process.\r\n          Milton hisses, his throat dry, like a man who hasn't quenched\r\n          his thirst in a decade.\r\n\r\n                         MILTON\r\n          You tell him I'm coming. You got\r\n          that? I'm coming to get her back.\r\n          You tell him. Tell him I'm gonna\r\n          kill every last one of you fuckers.\r\n          Milton turns on his heels. Walks into the dust and doesn't\r\n          look back.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY\r\n\r\n          Black smoke billows from the BBQ of this shithole diner.\r\n          It's the only building as far as the eye can see. The lot\r\n          dotted with vehicles past their prime. A muscle bound \u00e2\u0080\u009867\r\n          GTO stands out.\r\n\r\n          INT. FAT LOU'S ROADSIDE DINER - DAY\r\n\r\n          Covered in a thick layer of cooking grease, this is one of\r\n          those diners where white trash goes to die. Half a dozen\r\n          PATRONS sit at bar and booth as a young American Indian\r\n          couple, MARY and DALE, enter with their children 2, 4 and 7.\r\n          Two waitresses, PIPER (25) and NORMAJEAN (57) stand at the\r\n          kitchen pick-up window. Through which we can see the\r\n          joint's owner, FAT LOU, dripping sweat into a pile of\r\n          scrambled eggs. Fat Lou is fat. Holy fuck fat.\r\n\r\n                         PIPER\r\n          So I tell him, I says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrank,\r\n          that's it. No more free milk. You\r\n          gonna have to buy the cow you son\r\n          of a bitch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          5.\r\n\r\n                         NORMAJEAN\r\n          But you're not fat, Piper\r\n\r\n                         PIPER\r\n          Wha? No, NormaJean, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbuy the cow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Marry me? He's got to marry me.\r\n          I'm sayin I cut him off.\r\n\r\n                         NORMAJEAN\r\n          You cut him off?\r\n\r\n                         PIPER\r\n          Not just yes but hell yes! No\r\n          tits, no ass. And I told him if I\r\n          see that big ol' dick of his\r\n          anywhere near my face I'm gonna\r\n          bite it in half.\r\n          Normajean giggles with embarrassment.\r\n\r\n                         NORMAJEAN\r\n          You said that? How long's it been?\r\n          Piper frowns.\r\n\r\n                         PIPER\r\n          Well, it's only been two days but\r\n          that's like a decade in horny\r\n          fucker years.\r\n\r\n                         NORMAJEAN\r\n          So he bought you a diamond?\r\n\r\n                         PIPER\r\n          A diamond? God no. If Frank had\r\n          money for a diamond I would have\r\n          jacked his sorry ass ages ago and\r\n          put this shithole life in the rear\r\n          view. But he did get down on his\r\n          knees and ask me to be his bride.\r\n\r\n                         NORMAJEAN\r\n          No way.\r\n\r\n                         PIPER\r\n          Yes way!\r\n          NormaJean grabs Piper in a great big hug.\r\n\r\n                         NORMAJEAN\r\n          Oh! Piper!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          6.\r\n\r\n                         PIPER\r\n\r\n          I KNOW!\r\n\r\n          FF-FF-FFUMP!\r\n          Something yellow peppers them both. The girls look up as --\r\n          Fat Lou SLAMS two plates of food into the window.\r\n\r\n                         PIPER\r\n          Did...did you just throw scrambled\r\n          eggs at us?\r\n\r\n                         FAT LOU\r\n          I don't pay you bitches to stand\r\n          around. Now get the fuck back to work!\r\n          Piper snatches one of the plates.\r\n          She delivers it to a Patron sitting at the bar, then turns\r\n          toward the newly arrived customers.\r\n          The American Indian couple scans a menu...\r\n          ...and Milton (the old guy from our opening) scans her...he\r\n          quickly looks down at an unfolded map of Colorado as --\r\n          NormaJean steps up to Milton.\r\n\r\n                         NORMAJEAN\r\n          Hello beautiful, coffee?\r\n\r\n                         MILTON\r\n          That'd be great. Tell me,\r\n          Stillwater Marsh around here?\r\n\r\n                         NORMAJEAN\r\n          (shrugs) Stillwater...doesn't ring\r\n          a bell. I'll get that coffee.\r\n          But Milton makes eye contact with Mary, the Indian mother.\r\n          She quickly looks away. She knows something...\r\n          Milton opens his mouth to speak as--\r\n          --Piper approaches the American Indian couple.\r\n\r\n                         PIPER\r\n          Hi guys, I'm Piper. Can I bring\r\n          you something to drink?\r\n\r\n                         MOTHER MARY\r\n          We'll take this.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          7.\r\n          Mary points to the menu, Piper leans in, reads.\r\n\r\n                         PIPER\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe's a Brickhouse\u00e2\u0080\u009d breakfast.\r\n          Ten monster flapjacks for 4.99.\r\n\r\n                         MOTHER MARY\r\n          And five waters.\r\n\r\n                         PIPER\r\n          Five waters. And what can I get for...\r\n          Father averts his eyes. He's embarrassed.\r\n\r\n                         MOTHER MARY\r\n          That's it. Just the pancakes. If\r\n          that's okay?\r\n          Piper stares at them as if for the first time. Shit...\r\n          they're hungry. And broke.\r\n\r\n                         PIPER\r\n          Oh. Of course. Coming right up.\r\n          Piper shoots Milton a look as she crosses to the kitchen.\r\n          Milton rises slightly. He's clearly trying to get Mary's\r\n          attention. She's ignoring him.\r\n          Piper calls through the window to Fat Lou.\r\n\r\n                         PIPER\r\n          One brickhouse.\r\n          She turns and stops suddenly. Stares at a pile of muffins\r\n          kept fresh within a glass cake stand.\r\n\r\n                         ANOTHER ANGLE\r\n          Mary can no longer avoid Milton's stare.\r\n\r\n                         MILTON\r\n          Stillwater Marsh?

JONAH KING steps into the light. Ruggedly good\r\n          looking. He wears a necklace with something bulky hidden\r\n          beneath his shirt. There's an old scar under his left eye\r\n          but a scar on this guy simply adds to his fuckabilty factor.\r\n          He glances at Milton then --\r\n\r\n                         JONAH KING\r\n          It's Roy isn't it?\r\n          Roy spins from the bar, smiles a friendly smile.\r\n\r\n                         ROY\r\n          Sure is.

He flies. Lifted off the\r\n          ground his toes drag the floor, Frank SLAMS into the opposite\r\n          wall and bounces into the dresser.\r\n\r\n                         FRANK\r\n          You son of a --\r\n          Frank staggers to his feet.

SPARKS & GLASS fly.\r\n          The Accountant STOMPS on the bat, SNAPS it in two.\r\n          SLOMO: The short end rips from Frank's hands, knocks him\r\n          backwards. The piece spins in the air - for a second, hangs\r\n          there until...\r\n          The Accountant snatches it, letting his follow-through gather\r\n          momentum.\r\n          Frank can only watch as the Accountant -\r\n\r\n          HURLS THE JAGGED TIP OF THE BAT RIGHT AT HIM --\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          29.\r\n          The tip STRIKES Frank in the shoulder with such force, it\r\n          impales him up to the knob. Drives him backwards where it\r\n          embeds into the wall!\r\n          The Accountant grabs the broken barrel end of the bat, tosses\r\n          it from hand to hand with a loud SLAP of flesh on wood.\r\n\r\n                         ACCOUNTANT\r\n          What kind of car?\r\n\r\n                         FRANK\r\n          (dazed) I...what?\r\n\r\n                         ACCOUNTANT\r\n          Your car. What kind is it?\r\n          Frank stares down at the bat protruding from his shoulder.\r\n\r\n                         FRANK\r\n          Wha...what did you do?\r\n          The Accountant reaches out and twists the bat. Frank SCREAMS\r\n          out in pain.\r\n\r\n                         ACCOUNTANT\r\n          Answer the question.\r\n\r\n                         FRANK\r\n          A \u00e2\u0080\u009867 GTO! Arrgg!\r\n          The Accountant turns and walks toward the door. Stops to eye\r\n          a framed photo of Piper and Frank on the dresser.\r\n\r\n                         FRANK\r\n          Hey! Just hold on!\r\n          The Accountant pivots and flings the barrel of the bat.\r\n\r\n          FRANK'S POV\r\n          It's coming right at his face. Frank tries to dodge...twists\r\n          his head...no good.\r\n          The other end of the broken bat RAMS through his face, PINS\r\n          his head to the wall. The words Louisville Slugger just\r\n          visible where Frank's face should be.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Only the Nova and the moving sun\r\n          remain...until the sun dips into the Western horizon and\r\n          vanishes...replaced by one hell of a bright full moon.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

And LAUGHTER.\r\n          Piper rises and gazes at him over the roof. She's scared.\r\n          Milton shoves the 357 into his back waistband, slides the\r\n          ancient revolver into a leather hip-holster then he leans in\r\n          and grabs his shotgun.\r\n\r\n                         MILTON\r\n          Stay here.\r\n          Piper nods.\r\n          Milton moves toward the jagged rocks in the distance but soon\r\n          we can make out the flicking light of fire ahead as Milton\r\n          moves toward a cliff's edge.\r\n\r\n          EXT. STILWATER MARSH - CLIFF'S EDGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Milton lowers to the ground and crawls to the edge.\r\n\r\n                         MILTON'S POV\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          88.\r\n          A twenty foot drop off to the ravine floor below. The ravine\r\n          is filled with giant oil derricks, like metallic T-Rex's,\r\n          rising and falling to the SHRIEK of oiled metal.\r\n          And in the center of this Jurassic gathering, a CROWD of\r\n          people dance and sway around a giant bonfire. It is\r\n          celebration, ritual and orgy rolled into one.\r\n          Brawny cultists erect a makeshift stone altar. On the\r\n          opposite side of the Oil-Rig ravine - the battered RV sits\r\n          like a mobile command post.\r\n\r\n          CLOSE ON MILTON'S FACE\r\n          He was expecting less than twenty followers.

How does one man and a kid take on forty?\r\n          Suddenly a look of alarm crosses his face!\r\n          He jerks the ancient revolver and aims it ahead.\r\n\r\n                         HIS POV\r\n          Piper sits on the hood of the Nova next to the Accountant.\r\n\r\n                         MILTON\r\n          Get away from her.\r\n\r\n                         ACCOUNTANT\r\n          I think not.\r\n\r\n                         MILTON\r\n          I shoot you with this, you know\r\n          what it means.

Milton, you wouldn't be\r\n          here without me, you ungrateful\r\n          shit. That roadblock back there,\r\n          that would have stopped you. So I\r\n          want you to drop that iron God-\r\n          Killer and say thank you.\r\n          Milton stares.\r\n          The Accountant, moves. Quickly. With a crisp flick,\r\n          suddenly there's a blade at Piper's throat. She GASPS.\r\n\r\n                         ACCOUNTANT\r\n          I said, drop it and thank you.\r\n          Milton puts up his hand, flings the revolver into the\r\n          darkness behind him.\r\n\r\n                         MILTON\r\n          Don't hurt her.

Somehow they know how to\r\n          summon a piece of hell to earth.\r\n          The Accountant laughs.\r\n\r\n                         ACCOUNTANT\r\n          That's cute.

The Dark Lord?\r\n          Satan? Beelzebub? Lucifer? Simply\r\n          the warden of a very large prison.\r\n          Quiet man, actually. Thoughtful.\r\n          Well read. I happen to know the\r\n          idea of sacrificing children in his\r\n          honor annoys him greatly.\r\n\r\n                         MILTON\r\n          Then why? Why help me?\r\n\r\n                         ACCOUNTANT\r\n          Simple. Like the warden, we all\r\n          have jobs to do. Getting you here\r\n          makes my job easier.

OIL RIG RAVINE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The RV door flings open revealing Jonah King. He walks with\r\n          arrogance through the orgy around him, his followers turn to\r\n          him with reverence. His name is WHISPERED like a secret.\r\n          He approaches the make-shift stone altar where Skanky Gal\r\n          holds the baby within a bundle of blankets.\r\n          HIGH ABOVE: the moon is full and ripe.\r\n\r\n                         JONAH KING\r\n          It's almost time.\r\n          Skanky Gal nods. But there is hesitation in her eyes.

We who\r\n          have survived the slings. The\r\n          arrows. The revulsion of those too\r\n          weak to believe. We have been cast\r\n          out. And hunted. But no more.\r\n          Followers gather, move in unison, dance, writhe, fuck.\r\n          Tattoo approaches with an old rusty knife. It was probably\r\n          elegant once.

For now we...\r\n          A HOWLING noise.\r\n          No. An engine. Distant but thunderous.\r\n          Heads turn.

BOOM! KUHFWOOM!\r\n          He's shooting Cultists in a barrel.\r\n          But the Nova is the better weapon.

He also stole Satan's personal gun, labeled The Godkiller.\nAfter interrogating and murdering some of King's followers, Milton discovers that the ritual will take place in Stillwater, an abandoned prison in Louisiana. He heads there, but stops by a diner, where he meets Piper (Amber Heard), a waitress. Milton's car is damaged in the pursuit, so he sabotages Piper's car, a 1969 blue Dodge Charger R/T 440 and follows her to fix it in exchange for a ride on the way to Stillwater to find King.\nEntering her room, Piper walks in on her boyfriend, Frank (Todd Farmer), having sex with another woman. Piper beats up the woman and assaults Frank, getting knocked to the ground. Milton, in a phone booth nearby, hears the commotion and comes to Piper's aid, kicking Frank in the face as he is about to continue assaulting Piper, and punching Frank repeatedly. Milton steals his car, taking Piper along with him driving to Stillwater. Meanwhile, a supernatural operative of Satan, The Accountant (William Fichtner), arrives on Earth with the mission to bring Milton back to Hell and take the rifle back. After interrogating Frank, he discovers that Milton and Piper are heading to Louisiana. After murdering Frank with a bat, he tricks a pair of state troopers into helping him by impersonating an FBI agent.\nAt a shady hotel, Milton is attacked by King and his men, who heard about his return, but he kills most of them. The Accountant appears with the police and chases after Milton and Piper, who are chasing after King's van. Milton uses The Godkiller to shoot the Accountant out of the road. They then follow King to a church, only to find it filled with King's followers. They are ambushed and captured. Piper is kidnapped and Milton is shot in the eye and left for dead, but he awakens and kills King's men before pursuing the RV once again. Inside, Piper breaks free and fights King before jumping out of the RV and onto Milton's car. King then disables the car by repeatedly shooting its engine.\nMilton and Piper then meet Milton's friend Webster (David Morse), who provides them a new car, a 1971 red Chevrolet Chevelle SS. Piper discovers that Milton is literally undead and had to abandon his daughter to protect her from his former companions and that's why she was so easily manipulated by King. Webster reveals that he died 10 years prior in a shootout, and that Webster personally carried his coffin. She also discovers that the Godkiller was stolen by Milton from Satan himself and has the power to completely destroy one's soul, preventing it from going to either Heaven or Hell.\nAfter arming himself, Milton tells Piper that he can not guarantee her safety and that she should leave, but she assures him that she has never had a worthy cause to fight for until now, and that she is with him regardless of the consequences. Milton tells Webster to stay behind, not wishing him to die. With the help of the Accountant, they evade the troops of Sheriff Cap (Tom Atkins) and finally arrive at Stillwater. The Accountant captures Piper and forces Milton to give up the Godkiller before he can engage King, but he allows Milton to go into battle against King and his followers to save his granddaughter, noting that Satan is more of a well-educated, calm warden of a very large prison, rather as a face of evil, and that he actually despises the sacrifices of innocent lives in his name.\nWhile Milton slaughters King's men before they can sacrifice the child, Piper escapes The Accountant's clutches with the Godkiller. King eventually gets the upper hand on Milton and savagely beats him. Piper fires the Godkiller at King, but misses and hits one of his few surviving men instead. She is knocked out by the gun's recoil. King orders one of his female servants to murder the child. However, the woman, who had been caring for the baby ever since King stole her, finds herself unable to carry out the deed, making King angry. The Accountant attracts King's attention, allowing Milton to grab the Godkiller and shoot King, destroying his soul. The Accountant retrieves the baby. He allows Milton to say goodbye to her and Milton gives her to Piper, who promises to care for and protect her. Webster arrives and looks on as Milton \"dies.\"\nAfter both Piper and Webster have left, Milton is revealed to be still \"alive\" and with the Accountant. Following this, Milton makes good on his earlier promise to Webster, and nonchalantly drinks a beer out of what is left of King's skull. He agrees to go back to Hell, but warns that if he is punished too severely for his actions, he will escape again. The Accountant claims that he looks forward to it, insinuating that chasing Milton is the most fun he has ever had. The Accountant then wiggles his keys and manifests a black 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air before throwing the keys to Milton. They then drive off into the gates of Hell."}

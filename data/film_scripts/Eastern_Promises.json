A STREET NEAR BRICK LANE - EVENING                       1\r\n\r\n    It's 5.30pm in late December and rain is pouring. The\r\n    scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain.\r\n    A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish\r\n    newspaper held over his head. He ducks into a traditional\r\n    barber's shop called Ozim's.\r\n\r\n2   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - EVENING                             2\r\n\r\n    The shutters are drawn. OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk)\r\n    is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA).\r\n    Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit\r\n    beneath the barber's gown.\r\n\r\n    During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and\r\n    star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands.\r\n\r\n    Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters.   Soyka speaks\r\n    with a Russian accent.\r\n\r\n                           OZIM\r\n              Guvenilmez... daginik... bloody\r\n              kids, you know... he says - `but\r\n              Amca it's Christmas?...

So I said to him...\r\n              alisverise cimac. The kid's\r\n              sixteen...\r\n\r\n    Ozim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and\r\n    Ozim finally acknowledges Ekrem, who is shivering and wet\r\n    near to the door. Ekrem turns the `Open' sign to `Closed'.\r\n\r\n                          OZIM (CONT'D)\r\n              They don't want to work do they.\r\n              Shicma....\r\n\r\n                          EKREM\r\n                  (hesitantly\r\n                   interrupting)\r\n              Uncle Ozim.......\r\n\r\n    We see for the first time that Ekrem is shaking with fear\r\n    as well as cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              (CONTINUED)\r\n    WHITE Revision    -   9/12/06                               2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2   CONTINUED:                                                         2\r\n\r\n                                OZIM\r\n                 This is him.     The kid I'm talking\r\n                 about.\r\n\r\n    Ekrem approaches, stiffened by terror.       Soyka nods at Ekrem\r\n    in the mirror.\r\n\r\n                             SOYKA\r\n                 He looks OK to me... how you doin'\r\n                 Ekrem?\r\n\r\n    Soyka offers Ekrem a hand to shake and Ekrem stares at it\r\n    as if it were enchanted...\r\n\r\n                             OZIM\r\n                 He looks OK, yeah, but he won't do\r\n                 one lousy thing for me. Here,\r\n                 look... Ekrem, take this...\r\n\r\n    Ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair-tonic\r\n    bottles and hands it to Ekrem, who now looks mortally\r\n    terrified.\r\n\r\n                             EKREM\r\n                 Ozim... memnum etmek.\r\n\r\n                             OZIM\r\n                 We had a deal now he's backing\r\n                 out.\r\n\r\n                             SOYKA\r\n                     (laughing)\r\n                 Hey Ozim, leave the kid alone.\r\n                 It's obviously a psychological\r\n                 thing...\r\n\r\n                             OZIM\r\n                 Take it Ekrem.\r\n\r\n                             SOYKA\r\n                 Ozim, it's OK. I don't want a shave.\r\n\r\n                             OZIM\r\n                 This is the kid who walks around\r\n                 like Al Capone. Take the fucking\r\n                 ustura and finish this Rushca.\r\n\r\n                             SOYKA\r\n                     (startled)\r\n                 What?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\r\n    BLUE Revision    -   11/4/06                              3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 2\r\n\r\n    Soyka rises up from the seat, casting off his barber's\r\n    gown. Ozim yells `kabuka! And Ekrem snarls, flicks open\r\n    the razor and drags it across Soyka's throat. Soyka's scream\r\n    bubbles in the blood.\r\n\r\n3   EXT. KILBURN HIGH ROAD - NIGHT                                 3\r\n\r\n    We dissolve to a Christmas decoration flashing on and off\r\n    in the rain, high on a lamp post in Kilburn High Road. We\r\n    pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are\r\n    hurrying through the rain. We see a young girl (TATIANA)\r\n    hurrying across the street, wrapped in a dressing gown\r\n    with a man's overcoat thrown over the top of it. Her hair\r\n    is soaked as she approaches an all night chemist's shop.\r\n    She is barefoot.\r\n\r\n4   INT. CHEMIST'S SHOP - NIGHT                                    4\r\n\r\n    The CHEMIST is delivering advice in Gujurati to a CUSTOMER.\r\n    Tatiana wipes rain from her face and the Chemist and the\r\n    customer react to her ragged appearance.\r\n\r\n                          TATIANA\r\n                  (Russian accent)\r\n              Please...

We see\r\n    blood trickling down her legs. Tatiana looks down, then\r\n    faints onto the floor.\r\n\r\n5   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING WARD - NIGHT                5\r\n\r\n    We see Tatiana unconscious on a wheeled trolley bursting\r\n    through double doors into the operating ward of Trafalgar\r\n    hospital. The trolley is accompanied by TWO NURSES, a\r\n    JUNIOR DOCTOR and a midwife, (ANNA KHITROVA). The two\r\n    PARAMEDICS who brought her are following behind the trolley.\r\n\r\n                          ANNA\r\n              Did you get a name?\r\n\r\n                             PARAMEDIC\r\n              No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            (CONTINUED)\r\n    BLUE Revision    -   11/4/06                                 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5   CONTINUED:                                                        5\r\n\r\n                                                            CUT TO\r\n\r\n6   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. OPERATING THEATER - NIGHT                6\r\n\r\n    A tiny brown handbag is being shaken empty by a nurse.\r\n    Tatiana is being prepared for an emergency Caesarean. The\r\n    theater is full of people in scrubs, including an\r\n    anesthetist. Monitors and drips are being attached at double\r\n    speed.\r\n\r\n    We notice that her arms are already dotted with festering\r\n    needle marks.\r\n\r\n    A nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and\r\n    we can hear frantic activity from the operating table....\r\n\r\n                             NURSE 1\r\n                 Her stats are very poor, very poor.\r\n                 Baby's very distressed.\r\n\r\n    Anna approaches the nurse, who is rummaging through the\r\n    contents of the bag. We see a business card from a\r\n    restaurant called `The Trans-Siberian', a St. Christopher\r\n    necklace and a tiny battered diary. Anna grabs the diary.\r\n\r\n                             JUNIOR DOCTOR\r\n                 Shoulder distocia, I think.   Stuck\r\n                 on the pubic bone.\r\n\r\n    Cut to Anna at Tatiana's head.    Anna strokes her face and\r\n    speaks softly.\r\n\r\n                             ANNA\r\n                 Darling... darling, can you hear\r\n                 me?\r\n\r\n                             NURSE\r\n                 Baby's heart beat sixty... fifty-\r\n                 eight, fifty-eight... fifty-seven...\r\n\r\n                             JUNIOR DOCTOR\r\n                 Anna, I'm trying to rotate the\r\n                 shoulder medially... shit...\r\n\r\n    THE JUNIOR DOCTOR is breathing hard with a look of utter\r\n    panic as he attempts to free the baby.\r\n\r\n    The doors burst open and a more senior doctor in his mid\r\n    thirties (DOCTOR AZIZ) enters at a gallop. As he enters...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\r\n    WHITE Revision    -   9/12/06                            5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6   CONTINUED:                                                    6\r\n\r\n                             NURSE 1\r\n                 Baby stats sixty-eight and in free\r\n                 fall.\r\n\r\n                             NURSE 2\r\n                 I'm not getting a pulse.\r\n\r\n    Heartbeats.

As the Caesarean process begins at\r\n    frantic speed, we slowly zoom in on Tatiana's unconscious\r\n    face and hear her voice in V.O... a young girl's voice\r\n    speaking with an Russian accent. The crosstalk between\r\n    nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic.\r\n\r\n                             TATIANA (V.O.)\r\n                 My name is Tatiana. My father\r\n                 died in the mines in my village,\r\n                 so he was already buried when he\r\n                 died. We were all buried there.\r\n                 Buried under the soil of Russia.\r\n                 That is why I left to find a better\r\n                 life.\r\n\r\n    We hear... a baby cry. Anna's face appears in our framed\r\n    shot of Tatiana's face. She gently kisses Tatiana's cheek.\r\n\r\n                             ANNA\r\n                     (whispers)\r\n                 You had a girl.\r\n\r\n    A sheet is pulled over Tatiana's face. A nurse weighs the\r\n    screaming baby. Anna wipes her brow with the back of her\r\n    bloody wrist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               (CONTINUED)\r\n    BLUE Revision     -   11/4/06                           6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6   CONTINUED: (2)                                                6\r\n\r\n                             AZIZ\r\n                Ok.

TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. LABOR WARD - MORNING                 7\r\n\r\n    Anna leaves the labor ward, putting on her crash helmet.\r\n    She emerges out into the crisp, sunny morning. Aziz hurries\r\n    to catch her up and hands her a wrapped gift.\r\n\r\n                            AZIZ\r\n                Merry Christmas, Anna.\r\n\r\n                            ANNA\r\n                Oh, don't be ridiculous.\r\n\r\n    He grins.\r\n\r\n                            AZIZ\r\n                And you have to open it in front\r\n                of me.\r\n\r\n    Aziz smiles as Anna unwraps a pair of leather motorcycling\r\n    gloves.

SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY               13\r\n\r\n     The side door opens to reveal a hard-looking, handsome\r\n     Russian man (NIKOLAI), who stops to groom his hair back\r\n     from his face and put on a pair of sunglasses as he emerges\r\n     into daylight. He steps into a small courtyard, where a\r\n     fierce Doberman dog is barking and snarling on the end of\r\n     a chain.\r\n\r\n     Nikolai is followed by KIRILL, who is a little younger,\r\n     slim and pretty but hard-looking too. Kirill is dressed in\r\n     a crumpled T-shirt and jeans and looks like he had a heavy\r\n     night. Nikolai ignores the dog as he walks by but Kirill\r\n     yells at it and teases it with a whoop and few Russian\r\n     curses. Nikolai unbolts the gate to the street.\r\n\r\n                              KIRILL\r\n                  So you pick up Ozim and his bitch\r\n                  of a wife and you bring them back\r\n                  here.\r\n\r\n     He glances back at the restaurant and speaks softly.\r\n\r\n                              KIRILL (CONT'D)\r\n                  Then I'll think of an excuse and\r\n                  we can get away.\r\n\r\n                              NIKOLAI\r\n                  I'll think of an excuse.

Go...\r\n\r\n     Kirill grabs Nikolai's face to distract him, gives him a\r\n     playful slap, but there is somehow more to it than\r\n     playfulness. Nikolai gets into his car.\r\n\r\n     Kirill glares at Anna as she approaches the front of the\r\n     restaurant.\r\n\r\n14   EXT.

KITCHEN - DAY                   16\r\n\r\n     Inside the kitchen there is an inferno of activity, steam,\r\n     smoke. Family members, some dressed in their party outfits,\r\n     others in chefs' uniforms, are standing over steaming pots,\r\n     laughing, arguing. Children play and yell. You can almost\r\n     smell Christmas. Anna enters, dazzled by it all,\r\n     overwhelmed by the contrast to her own lifeless Christmas\r\n     kitchen. Semyon calls out to everyone.\r\n\r\n                           SEMYON\r\n               Come, come, hurry, hurry.

Semyon\r\n     angles his head to look as he stirs.\r\n\r\n                           SEMYON (CONT'D)\r\n               It is the old card. From before\r\n               the renovations.

The rear\r\n     windows are sun shaded so we only see Nikolai in the\r\n     driver's seat.   He gets out of the car and opens the rear\r\n     door of the car for an elegantly dressed Turkish lady in\r\n     her fifties. Nikolai goes to the other rear door. The\r\n     portly figure of Ozim the barber emerges. As Ozim gets out\r\n     he gives Nikolai a fifty-pound note.\r\n\r\n18   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - DAY                   18\r\n\r\n     Two of the little girl violinists are fighting, pulling\r\n     each other's hair. The third is sobbing, sitting on the\r\n     floor. A young woman in a party dress is carrying a huge\r\n     silver bowl of sauce across the kitchen.\r\n\r\n     Anna looks delighted at the noise and energy of the place.\r\n     Finally Semyon emerges from a cloud of steam with a scrap\r\n     of paper.\r\n\r\n                              SEMYON\r\n                  This is an agency that hires casual\r\n                  kitchen staff.

Ozim's wife is\r\n     at a table alone, well out of their earshot, smoking a\r\n     cigarette and peeling glazed figs. As Anna walks by, Ozim\r\n     and Kirill stop talking. The scene has a much darker mood\r\n     to the bustling scene in the kitchen, but for now Anna\r\n     feels no unease. As she passes, Kirill surveys her with a\r\n     deadly smile and a professional eye.\r\n\r\n                              KIRILL\r\n               Hey, you OK?

As she does she sees that\r\n     four expensive-looking cars have already parked and various\r\n     ostentatiously dressed Russian and Turkish couples with\r\n     their children are emerging from their cars. The women are\r\n     all wearing furs, even the little girls. The men wear\r\n     leather or dark suits. They greet each other exuberantly\r\n     as they emerge from their cars. Anna suddenly feels\r\n     slightly uneasy. As she approaches her motorbike she sees\r\n     Nikolai leaning against the bonnet of his car, smoking,\r\n     still wearing shades.

TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -22A\r\n      NIGHT\r\n\r\n      In a private room in the Special Care Baby Unit, Anna\r\n      approaches Tatiana's baby's plastic crib. The baby is\r\n      tightly bundled up, sound asleep. Through the windows of\r\n      the room, we see the darkened, quiet ward outside - another\r\n      world.\r\n\r\n      Anna stands over the baby, her face full of emotion. There\r\n      we see pain, loss, shame, emptiness, isolation. Tears begin\r\n      to roll from her eyes, and then she is sobbing soundlessly.\r\n\r\n23    INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                        23\r\n\r\n      The Trans-Siberian restaurant is smoky with cigarettes and\r\n      cigars. The party is in full swing with two dozen guests\r\n      and family. One of the golden-haired children is playing\r\n      violin badly. The language is Russian, English and Turkish\r\n      mixed. Kirill is bringing a huge baked carp to the table.\r\n      His mobile phone rings and he wipes his hands on a towel\r\n      to answer it.\r\n\r\n      When he hears the voice, Kirill glances at his father and\r\n      moves quickly out of earshot. Semyon notices but hides\r\n      his concern. As Kirill walks, a child tugs his leg and\r\n      holds up a soft toy, asking a question in Russian.\r\n\r\n                            KIRILL\r\n                    (to child)\r\n                He's called Goofy...

Ozim leads Nikolai and Kirill through the\r\n     debris of the night before. As they walk through, Ekrem\r\n     suddenly leaps out of the darkness with a yell. Kirill\r\n     and Nikolai both react with instinctive aggression.\r\n\r\n                           OZIM\r\n               Hey, hey, hey Ekrem, sakim, durgun,\r\n               durgun.\r\n\r\n                           EKREM\r\n               I got tickets, Ozim.

Kirill nods to Nikolai who grabs the package and\r\n     hauls it out onto the kitchen floor.

We pull wide to reveal the full,\r\n     gruesome scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                (CONTINUED)\r\n     WHITE Revision    -   9/12/06                            26.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30   CONTINUED:                                                     30\r\n\r\n     Nikolai has the body of Soyka laid out on a surface, his\r\n     head still bound up in a bin bag, his lower portions bound\r\n     up similarly. Nikolai is de-frosting Soyka's left hand\r\n     with the hair dryer, concentrating on his ring finger which\r\n     has a gold ring on it. The parts of Soyka's shirt and\r\n     jacket which are visible are crusted with frozen blood.\r\n     Nikolai is wearing rubber gloves.\r\n\r\n     As he dries, Nikolai takes a sip of coffee. Ozim is\r\n     watching this scene with horror. Kirill has his arms\r\n     folded, mightily impressed.\r\n\r\n     Finally the hand is thawed enough for Nikolai to remove\r\n     the gold ring. He studies an inscription and then offers\r\n     it to Ozim. Ozim shakes his head as if the thing were a\r\n     contagion. Nikolai shrugs and pockets it. He then turns\r\n     the hair dryer back on and blows some hot air onto the\r\n     crisply bloody chest of Soyka. He tugs at the frozen lapel\r\n     of the jacket and blows air into the inside pocket. Within\r\n     a few moments he is able to remove Soyka's glistening,\r\n     thawing wallet which is caked in frozen blood. He opens\r\n     it (we glimpse a photo of a wife and children) and blows\r\n     hot air onto the money inside.\r\n\r\n     He tugs a wad of frozen bank notes from the wallet, all\r\n     stuck together by drops of frozen blood. He offers this\r\n     money to Ozim as well but Ozim shakes his head vigorously.\r\n     Kirill hoots with laughter. Ozim is now staring at Nikolai\r\n     as if he were a devil from hell.\r\n\r\n     Nikolai grabs a plastic bag and puts the money inside it,\r\n     then pockets the frozen wad. He tosses the rest of the\r\n     frozen wallet to Ozim, who instinctively catches it.\r\n\r\n                              NIKOLAI\r\n                  You'd better burn that.\r\n\r\n     Ozim, reacting to the cold of the wallet and to the horror\r\n     of it, drops the thing on the floor. Nikolai looks at\r\n     Ozim as if he were a complete amateur.\r\n\r\n                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)\r\n                  Did you finish cutting his hair?\r\n\r\n     Ozim can't answer.\r\n\r\n                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)\r\n                  I just thought you might want six-\r\n                  fifty out of his pockets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                (CONTINUED)\r\n     BLUE Revision    -   11/4/06                               27.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n30   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   30\r\n\r\n     Kirill laughs.    Nikolai takes a deep breath to prepare\r\n     himself.\r\n\r\n                           NIKOLAI (CONT'D)\r\n               OK, now I'm going to do his teeth\r\n               and cut off his fingers.\r\n                   (to Ozim)\r\n               You might want to leave the room.\r\n\r\n     Ozim thinks, decides, leaves fast.

Nikolai is left alone. His hand shakes a\r\n     little as he picks up his cup of coffee.\r\n\r\n31   EXT. NINE ELMS. ABANDONED DOCK - MORNING                         31\r\n\r\n     Nikolai pulls up beside a rusting crane on the abandoned\r\n     dock in a dry-cleaner's van. Kirill watches as Nikolai\r\n     grabs the semi-thawed body, now bagged and tied, lifts it\r\n     onto his shoulder, and smartly approaches the dockside.\r\n\r\n                           KIRILL\r\n               Aren't you going to weight him\r\n               down or something?\r\n\r\n     Nikolai drops the body into the water with a splash.\r\n\r\n                            NIKOLAI\r\n               If you want to dump a body, this\r\n               is the place. The currents keep\r\n               it under the surface until past\r\n               the barrier.\r\n\r\n     Nikolai and Kirill watch as the body is swallowed by a\r\n     fast ocean-bound current.\r\n\r\n32   EXT.

Outside it's\r\n     dark and raining. He is reading a Russian crime novel. A\r\n     half-empty bottle of vodka sits on the table.\r\n\r\n     Tatiana's voice-over continues as we cut inside the\r\n     restaurant.\r\n\r\n                              TATIANA (V.O.)\r\n                  My friend says his uncle owns the\r\n                  restaurant where you can sing.

She has photocopied the pages of the diary and\r\n     they are laid out in segments on each page.\r\n\r\n                              ANNA\r\n                  I copied the whole thing.\r\n\r\n     Semyon takes the pages and looks troubled.\r\n\r\n                              SEMYON\r\n                  Where is the original?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                (CONTINUED)\r\n     WHITE Revision    -     9/12/06                            29.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n35   CONTINUED:                                                       35\r\n\r\n                              ANNA\r\n                  I'm going to keep it.

As they\r\n     head towards the restaurant, Anna emerges. Nikolai looks\r\n     up, curious, as Semyon kisses her on both cheeks in the\r\n     doorway. As she turns Kirill stumbles forwards and collapses\r\n     in front of her. Nikolai looks up at Anna, his face\r\n     splashed with rain.\r\n\r\n                             NIKOLAI (CONT'D)\r\n                  What?

As Semyon looks at the card in the\r\n     candle light, he also sees the TATTOO OF AN EAGLE on\r\n     Nikolai's hand.\r\n\r\n     It is obvious that the tattoo means more than the card to\r\n     Semyon, and he reacts.\r\n\r\n                              NIKOLAI (CONT'D)\r\n                  I run a mini-cab business.\r\n                              (MORE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\r\n     PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                             33.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n37   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  37\r\n\r\n                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)\r\n                Albanians, Chechens, Russians.\r\n                They deliver packages.

Semyon looks at Nikolai with utter contempt.\r\n\r\n                            SEMYON\r\n                I have no idea what business you're\r\n                talking about. Now get out.\r\n\r\n     Nikolai smiles and then leaves. Semyon watches him go\r\n     then peers at his drunken, sleeping son with something\r\n     approaching compassion.\r\n\r\n38   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                          38\r\n\r\n     Nikolai hurries   out to his car in the rain. He hears an\r\n     engine splutter   and spots Anna still trying to kick-start\r\n     her motorbike.    He approaches. She's already soaked.\r\n     Nikolai watches   her try to start the bike and fail.\r\n\r\n                            NIKOLAI\r\n                You've got water in it.\r\n\r\n     Deadpan, Anna looks up and holds out her hand into pouring\r\n     rain.\r\n\r\n                              ANNA\r\n                Water?

Nikolai gently takes her shoulders and after a brief\r\n     resistance Anna climbs off the bike. Nikolai sits astride\r\n     it. He kicks it. It fails to start. Anna folds her arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                (CONTINUED)\r\n     PINK Revision   -   11/12/06                              33A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n38   CONTINUED:                                                       38\r\n\r\n     He tries again.

Nikolai isn't sure what to\r\n     make of her. She begins to chain the bike's rear wheel.\r\n\r\n                            NIKOLAI (CONT'D)\r\n                You got far to go?\r\n\r\n     Anna tucks her crash helmet under her arm and prepares to\r\n     set off walking.\r\n\r\n                            ANNA\r\n                Just across the park.\r\n\r\n                            NIKOLAI\r\n                I'm a driver.

As Nikolai\r\n     holds the steering wheel, Anna sees the intricate detail\r\n     of the eagle tattoo on the back of his right hand.\r\n\r\n                            NIKOLAI\r\n                So you're a midwife.

She is on\r\n     all fours, registering no emotion.\r\n\r\n     Kirill is leaning against the wall, drinking wine from the\r\n     bottle, watching Nikolai with burning eyes, his lust and\r\n     drunken jealousy mixing together. Nikolai grits his teeth\r\n     and comes inside the girl. Kirill whoops and whistles and\r\n     begins to applaud.\r\n\r\n     The girl is still silent, expressionless.\r\n\r\n                              KIRILL\r\n               You did OK!

Finally alone, Nikolai gently helps the girl to\r\n     lie down. She is numb. He covers her up with a blanket\r\n     then begins to pull on his clothes. The girl is staring up\r\n     at the ceiling.\r\n\r\n     After a few moments she begins to sing a Russian folk song\r\n     softly under her breath.

There are Arsenal and Chelsea supporters on\r\n     opposite sides of the street and there is some mildly\r\n     vicious yelling between the two groups. Police are visibly\r\n     keeping order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                (CONTINUED)\r\n     PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                             66.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n54   CONTINUED:                                                      54\r\n\r\n     Among the crowd we see Ekrem. He seems slightly drunk on\r\n     top of his normal craziness. He has an Arsenal scarf around\r\n     his neck and is looking for trouble, jeering at the Chelsea\r\n     supporters across the street.\r\n\r\n                             EKREM\r\n                  Hey!

As he gets to his feet we notice TWO\r\n     CHECHEN MEN who are trailing Ekrem, ducking their heads\r\n     away from the line of policemen.\r\n\r\n55   EXT.

He is chanting `Arsenal, Arsenal' to himself as\r\n     he walks. He stops to take a piss on someone's grave.\r\n\r\n     In the background the two Chechens are coming closer. As\r\n     Ekrem zips his flies, the Chechens are upon him. One of\r\n     them grabs his Arsenal scarf and begins to strangle him.\r\n\r\n     Ekrem chokes for a while and the Chechen loosens the knot.\r\n     The second Chechen pulls out an open razor.

A swell of laughter from the\r\n     restaurant. Anna is about to continue but Nikolai steps\r\n     forward and places two fingers on Anna's lips to stop her\r\n     from saying anymore. Anna tears his hands from her mouth.\r\n\r\n     At the same time Kirill yells in Russian.\r\n\r\n                              KIRILL\r\n                      (in Russian)\r\n                  What did she say?!\r\n\r\n     Anna is terrified but angry too.

A Daimler and a Bentley are already parked. A large\r\n     SUV pulls up and a hard-looking Russian man in his sixties\r\n     (VALERY) is ushered from the car by bodyguards in suits\r\n     and shades.\r\n\r\n     He is greeted by a darker-looking man in his fifties (THE\r\n     GYPSY) who has a fur coat around his shoulders.

He\r\n     then takes off his shirt, to reveal that his upper body is\r\n     decorated with elaborate tattoos (details to follow).\r\n\r\n     He carefully places his shirt over the chair then sits\r\n     down. The panel of the vory study his body, the Gypsy\r\n     pushing a candle across the table to better illuminate the\r\n     detail of the tattoos. Only after the men have studied\r\n     the tattoos does the interview begin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              (CONTINUED)\r\n     WHITE Revision       -   9/12/06                                78.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n67   CONTINUED:                                                            67\r\n\r\n     The following dialogue should not be translated, and can\r\n     be cut around to suggest a long and grueling interview.\r\n\r\n                              VALERY\r\n                  We can see that you were in prison\r\n                  in Siberia.

They swagger up to Ozim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               (CONTINUED)\r\n     PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                      83-83A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n75   CONTINUED:                                                   75\r\n\r\n     He gulps down his fear.\r\n\r\n                              OZIM\r\n                  Kirill is in there.\r\n\r\n     Ozim slaps his chest to denote the place where they will\r\n     see the vor tattoo. They head towards the steam room as\r\n     Ozim grabs his shoes and hurries towards the exit.\r\n\r\n76   INT. TURKISH BATHS. STEAM ROOM - DAY                         76\r\n\r\n     Nikolai is sweating hard, staring at the ceiling. The\r\n     steam room door opens but the steam is now so thick he\r\n     can't see who has entered.\r\n\r\n                              NIKOLAI\r\n                  Ozim?\r\n\r\n     He sees a shape... a clothed body. He realizes immediately.\r\n     Suddenly one of the brothers is upon him and has him in a\r\n     head lock. He strokes the tattoo on Nikolai's chest as if\r\n     this were confirmation of who this is. He grunts an\r\n     instruction and his brother emerges through the steam with\r\n     an open razor.\r\n\r\n     Nikolai is naked, alone.\r\n\r\n     Suddenly he kicks the razor guy in the balls and uses a\r\n     martial arts chop to free himself from the other brother.\r\n     In the steam there are boots and bare feet and knees and\r\n     fingers flying. Nikolai manages to gouge the eye of one\r\n     brother and throw another against the wall. He obviously\r\n     has serious combat training but the brothers are strong\r\n     and angry.\r\n\r\n     Suddenly Nikolai is slashed across the arm by the razor\r\n     and blood oozes into the steam and hot water. All the men\r\n     are slipping and falling on the blood and hot water.\r\n     Another slash of the razor cuts his thigh open. All the\r\n     men are now covered in blood and Nikolai, with a final\r\n     surge of strength, manages to cripple one brother with a\r\n     blow to the throat, and the other with an elbow to the\r\n     temple.\r\n\r\n     As the Chechens slump to the floor, Nikolai fumbles in the\r\n     bloody water for the razor, finds it, kneels, and slashes\r\n     their throats. He lurches to his feet, drops the razor,\r\n     and staggers out of the steam room.\r\n\r\n77   OMITTED                                                      77\r\n     GOLDENROD Revision     -   11/27/06                       84.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n78   INT.

He is covered with a surgical gown\r\n     which is covered in blood. His arm flops out from under\r\n     the covers as the paramedics rush him into the hospital.\r\n\r\n     Anna is walking in the opposite direction. Then, as\r\n     Nikolai's trolley passes, Anna sees Nikolai's arm, flopping\r\n     from under the covers. She sees the eagle tattoo on the\r\n     back of his hand. Anna freezes.\r\n\r\n80   INT.

ABANDONED DOCK - NIGHT                        102\r\n\r\n       On the edge of the dockside, Kirill is kneeling with the\r\n       zip-up bag before him. Suddenly fireworks begin to burst\r\n       over the Thames. It is the stroke of midnight.\r\n\r\n       Kirill unzips the bag. When he looks inside Christine\r\n       stops crying. He peers at her, wiping away tears.\r\n\r\n                             KIRILL\r\n                 She's a little girl, Papa, a little\r\n                 sweet fucking girl...\r\n\r\n       Kirill sobs then Christine cries...\r\n\r\n                             KIRILL (CONT'D)\r\n                 Shush, shush...\r\n\r\n       Kirill lifts her out of the bag and holds her close to\r\n       him, fireworks still illuminating the London skyline. He\r\n       looks down at the freezing cold water, utterly confused.\r\n       He whispers...\r\n\r\n                             KIRILL (CONT'D)\r\n                     (in Russian)\r\n                 I'm sorry, my little sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                (CONTINUED)\r\n      BLUE Revision   -   11/4/06                           103A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n102   CONTINUED:                                                    102\r\n\r\n      For a moment we believe he is going to throw her into the\r\n      water. Instead he begins to sing a lullaby to her and her\r\n      crying stops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              (CONTINUED)\r\n      PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                            104.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n102   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  102\r\n\r\n      Then we see a single light behind him. In a firework flash\r\n      we see Nikolai and Anna climbing off the bike. They\r\n      approach cautiously. Kirill stares at the man he loves.\r\n      A pause. Christine begins to cry.\r\n\r\n                             ANNA\r\n                 Kirill, let me take the baby.\r\n\r\n                             KIRILL\r\n                 You stay where you are.\r\n\r\n                             ANNA\r\n                 She's cold, Kirill.\r\n\r\n      Kirill suddenly screams as another barrage of fireworks\r\n      explodes. Nikolai doesn't move. Kirill is dangerously\r\n      close to the edge of the dock. Maybe he'll throw himself\r\n      in too.\r\n\r\n                             NIKOLAI\r\n                 Kirill, a vor doesn't kill little\r\n                 babies.\r\n\r\n      Kirill is motionless.\r\n\r\n                             NIKOLAI (CONT'D)\r\n                 Something like this would be bad\r\n                 for all of us.

As he gets closer Kirill\r\n      hugs the baby.\r\n\r\n      Finally Nikolai reaches Kirill and hugs him. As he does\r\n      he edges him away from the dockside. The three of them are\r\n      locked in a long embrace.\r\n\r\n      Nikolai emerges from the embrace with Christine in his\r\n      arms. He quickly hands her to Anna who hugs her close.\r\n      Kirill turns to Nikolai.\r\n\r\n                             KIRILL\r\n                 I swear I didn't know my dad was\r\n                 setting you up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\r\n      YELLOW Revision    -   11/21/06                           105.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n102   CONTINUED: (3)                                                   102\r\n\r\n                               NIKOLAI\r\n                   He's going away.

He laughs.\r\n\r\n      Anna studies him, unsure. More New Year fireworks explode\r\n      over the river.

The conversation\r\n      is jovial as Anna and Helen bring dishes of food to the\r\n      table.\r\n\r\n      Then we hear a baby crying. Anna goes to a small crib and\r\n      lifts a six-month-old Christine out. She hands her to\r\n      Helen who hugs her. Over this happy scene we hear Tatiana\r\n      in V.O., a repeat of the first words we heard her say.\r\n\r\n                            TATIANA (V.O.)\r\n                My name is Tatiana.

She also finds a card for the Trans-Siberian Restaurant, which is owned by Semyon, an old vor in the Russian Mafia. Anna thus sets out to track down the girl's family so that she can find a home for the baby girl, having meetings with Semyon, whom she initially regards as friendly. Anna's mother Helen does not discourage her, but Anna's Ukrainian uncle and self-described former KGB officer, Stepan, whom Anna asks for help with the translation of the diary, urges caution. Through translation of the diary, Anna comes to learn that Semyon and his ignorant therefore unstable son Kirill had abused the girl, addicted her to heroin, forced her into prostitution, and raped her. Ultimately, Anna realizes that the baby was fathered by Semyon (in several scenes it is made clear that Kirill is impotent and never had sex with Tatiana).\nSemyon's driver is Nikolai Luzhin, who also serves as the family cleaner, dumping murdered bodies in the River Thames. Through Nikolai, Semyon, fearing prosecution, promises to give the location of the girl's family to Anna if she hands back the diary. Nikolai takes the diary but does not give a location, instead urging Anna to keep the baby in London. Semyon distrusts Anna's uncle Stepan and orders Nikolai to kill him. Nikolai accepts and soon Stepan goes missing. As Nikolai's star rises within the vory, an impressed Semyon sponsors him as a full member, due in part to Nikolai's protection of Semyon's incompetent son, who authorized a hit on a rival Chechen vory leader with the help of a Kurdish associate, Azim. The hit was ill-advised and not approved by Semyon. Two Chechen hitmen soon arrive in London seeking vengeance and kill Azim's nephew who also took part in the hit. Semyon hatches a plan to trick Nikolai into temporarily taking Kirill's place during a meeting at the baths with Azim. The Chechens attack, thinking Nikolai is Kirill, but Nikolai kills them both, ending up in the hospital with severe wounds.\nIt is revealed that Nikolai is actually an FSB agent who has infiltrated the gang, working under license by the British Government and a senior police officer. As part of his undercover duties, Nikolai was able to read Tatiana's diary before Semyon destroyed it and hatched a plan to have Semyon arrested for statutory rape, with a paternity test of Tatiana's baby as evidence. Stepan is also safe, hiding in a 5-star hotel in Edinburgh for protection. Semyon orders Kirill to kidnap the baby girl and kill her. But as Kirill sits by the Thames working up the courage to throw the child in, Nikolai and Anna find him and persuade him to give the baby back. Nikolai and Kirill embrace as Nikolai tells him that his father is finished and they are now the bosses. Nikolai and Anna kiss and part for the last time. Nikolai succeeds Semyon as boss of the organization and Anna gains custody of Tatiana's baby, whom she names Christine."}

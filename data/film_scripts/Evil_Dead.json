Rising from a swampy bog, the mud slides from view\n     allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the\n     forest. Creeping silently past trees, gliding over small\n     shrubs, it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth\n     oak rests directly in its path. The tree is uprooted by\n     this unseen force, and falls with a deafening crash.\n\n\n\n2    ED - CAR\n\n\n     Near by, a stretch of highway curves along the base of\n     a mountain. The road winds off into oblivion beyond other\n     peaks. From behind view, the rumble of an engine can be\n     heard. It is a large logging truck headed south. Moving\n     away, the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap-\n     pears in the distance. From where the truck emerged, a\n     dilapidated gold 1973 Oldsmobile comes into view.\n\n\n\n3    ID - CAR\n\n\n     Inside, five people can be seen. They are couples ASHLY\n     and LINDA, SCOTT and SHELLY, and CHERYL, ASHLY's sister.\n     Both SCOTT and SHELLY wear \"Michigan State\" T-shirts,\n     and are students along with the others at that univer-\n     sity. SCOTT is driving and SHELLY sits next to him up\n     front. ASHLY, LINDA and CHERYL are in back. They listen\n     to an old \"Baby Moses And The Thrillers\" song on the\n     radio, and SHELLY is slapping the dash board as if it\n     were a drum.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               (Singing with the music)...

ASHLY pours LINDA a drink in the\n     bottle cap and keeps the bottle. They raise their drinks.\n\n\n                         ASHLY and LINDA\n\n               ...With good friends.\n\n\n     They toast, drink and react to the strong liquor. ASHLY\n     tries to hide his reaction to the Scotch in front of\n     LINDA, since SHELLY had reacted so calmly. ASHLY passes\n     the bottle to CHERYL who stops him with a polite \"No,\n     thank you,\" then back up front to SCOTT.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Hey Scotty, what's this place like\n               anyway?\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Well, the guy that's renting it says\n               it's an old place, little run down,\n               but it's right up in the mountains-\n               totally secluded.

Carefully, the vehicle crosses.\n\n\n\n20   ED - CAB\n\n\n     It is late afternoon when they eventually arrive at their\n     destination. The small wooden cabin is surrounded by\n     thick dark woods. SCOTT shuts off the car but it contin-\n     ues to sputter and backfire.\n\n\n\n21   ID - CAR\n\n\n     ASHLY reacts to his car.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               I...I sent 'em a check for the tune-up.\n               but I'm just not paying for it.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               This place is perfect.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               The woods come awfully close to the\n               house don't they?\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               So what's wrong with the woods, they\n               can't bite ya.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               It's just a little claustrophobic\n               that's all.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Well, I think it's beautiful.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               Me too, it's gonna be a bomb week-\n               end.\n\n\n\n22   ED - CAB\n\n\n     SCOTT moves to the front door of the cabin where he finds\n     a small ring of keys concealed on the shelf above the\n     door. ASHLY unloads the car to the others.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               It's supposed to be one of these on\n               here.\n\n\n     After trying several keys, he is able to unlock the door.\n\n\n\n23   ID - M.R.\n\n\n     The interior of the cabin is completely dark. SCOTT\n     opens the door and stands silhouetted in the doorway\n     for a moment, then enters to find the light switch.\n     The illumination reveals floors, walls, and ceilings\n     made of cedar. There are two small bedrooms, a kitchen,\n     and the main room which contains a stone fireplace set\n     into the wall. An old grandfather clock stands silently\n     in one corner, partially hidden in the shadows. A door\n     in the rear of the cabin leads to a small work shed\n     containing a work bench and an assortment of tools upon\n     the wall. Located centrally in the main room is a trap\n     door leading to the cellar. This catches SCOTT's eye.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Hey, this place has a dungeon.\n\n\n     CHERYL puts down a case of art supplies, and moves over\n     to SCOTT by the trap door. He unlocks a chain securing\n     the trap door with one of his keys and hands the ring\n     to SHELLY.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Put these back will you?\n\n\n     SHELLY leaves with the keys, and SCOTT tries to open the\n     hatch but cannot.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               They nailed it shut.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               Good, I don't like cellars. Probably\n               just some garbage down there anyways.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Cheryl, they don't nail garbage in\n               cellars.

She repositions a balance weight, and it\n     begins to tick.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Ta daaaaaa!\n\n\n     The others applaud and whistle. LINDA smiles.\n\n\n\n24   ET - CAB\n\n\n     The cabin is seen from the outside. Twilight has come.\n\n\n\n25   IT - M.R.\n\n\n     CHERYL sits alone in the living room near the window. She\n     is drawing sketches of the old clock. As she works, the\n     ticking stops unexpectedly. CHERYL puts down her pencil\n     and looks up to the clock. It stands silently in the cor-\n     ner with its hands frozen in position. There is a rust-\n     ling from the woods. CHERYL looks out the window but can\n     see only the trees. Something is moving outside, yet re-\n     mains hidden within the forest. A gust of wind fills the\n     room. CHERYL glances down at her hand. It turns a pale\n     white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably.\n     She stares on incredulously as her hand, guided by some\n     unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch\n     a figure upon her pad. The wind gales through the open\n     window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the\n     drawing. Whatever was at the edge of the woods has now\n     retreated further into them. Her hand loses the pale\n     cast and is now under control once more. CHERYL picks\n     up her pad of paper. The likeness of a book with some\n     form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched.\n     She looks to the woods which are now silent. A snapping\n     of wood is heard from the cellar. CHERYL quickly turns\n     to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor. Pos-\n     sibly just a mouse, but she fixes her gaze upon it.\n     Another sound, almost like faint breathing comes from\n     the cellar.\n\n\n\n26   IT - K/M.R.\n\n\n     ASHLY and LINDA enter from the kitchen. ASHLY is drink-\n     ing a beer and moves over to CHERYL. He stands between\n     her and the trap door.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               What're you drawing Cheryl?\n\n\n     He picks up the piece of paper. LINDA looks over his\n     shoulder to glance at it.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               I...I don't know.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Is it a bible?\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               No, no it's no bible. (She glances\n               again at the cellar, knowing some-\n               thing is down there) I don't know\n               what it is.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Well, this one of the clock's not\n               bad.\n\n\n     LINDA picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock\n     with it a few steps away. She stands comparing it to\n     the real thing with her back to CHERYL and ASHLY. She\n     is only a few inches from the trap door, and CHERYL\n     wants to call out in warning when ASHLY kneels in front\n     of her to speak secretly.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               (In a whisper) I got it right here.\n\n\n     He taps something in his shirt pocket. CHERYL is looking\n     past him paying no attention. She watches only LINDA's\n     feet, waiting for whatever is in the cellar to grab them.\n     LINDA looks at the drawing in comparison.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Cheryl, this is really good. I like\n               how you did the numbers in that wood-\n               ish style.\n\n\n     ASHLY produces a small box from his shirt and opens it\n     quickly to show CHERYL. It contains a gold pendant on\n     a necklace. LINDA takes a step closer to the clock. She\n     is now standing almost upon the trap door. Although\n     nailed shut, it opens slightly, pulling the nails with\n     it. CHERYL gasps. ASHLY is pleased with her response.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               (Still in a whisper) I knew you'd\n               like it.\n\n\n     Quickly, he places it back in his shirt and touches his\n     lips with a finger to indicate the secrecy of his sup-\n     rise. LINDA returns with the sketch and places it back\n     on CHERYL's small drawing table.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               It's really good Cheryl. Very close\n               to the origional.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               (In a relieved whisper) Yes, very\n               close.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               I'm gonna check dinner.\n\n\n     LINDA returns to the kitchen and ASHLY turns to CHERYL.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               You better get washed up. I'll see\n               ya in there.\n\n\n     He winks, then follows LINDA into the kitchen. CHERYL\n     again looks at the cellar. Slowly, from her point of\n     view, the camera moves in toward the trap door, wait-\n     ing...waiting.\n\n\n\n27   IT - K\n\n\n     A blender screams as it mixes up a drink in the kitchen.\n     SHELLY shuts it off and carries it to the dining room.\n\n\n\n28   IT - D.R.\n\n\n     She joins the others who are now seated at the dinner\n     table and serves the mixture. SCOTT sits between LINDA\n     and CHERYL. He leans over to CHERYL.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               (In a whisper) Dead bodies in the\n               cellar, dead bodies in the cellar...\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               Will you stop it?\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Scott, leave her alone will ya?\n\n\n     SCOTT turns toward LINDA.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Will you relax, I'm just kidding\n               around. She can take a joke-\n\n\n     He stops talking as he hears the trickling of water. He\n     turns to see CHERYL finish pouring a glass of water in\n     his lap. The others laugh. SCOTT is silent for a moment,\n     then begins chuckling to himself. He turns to CHERYL.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               (Jokingly) I'll get ya.\n\n\n     With a napkin, he blots the water from his pants.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               I'll get ya for this Cheryl.\n\n\n     ASHLY stands with his drink and raises the glass.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               I'd like to make a toast for all\n               here this evening.

CHERYL is slighly more nervous\n     than the others. ASHLY is the first to speak.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               (Slowly) What is this?\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Whatever it is, it's still down there.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               I don't like cellars, let's close it\n               up. (She does not want to deal with\n               it) It's probably just some animal.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               An animal?! An an...ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-\n               that's the stupidest thing I ever\n               heard in my life. Jesus Christ.\n\n\n     SCOTT locates a flashlight and peers into the hole. He\n     traces the old wooden steps into darkness with his light.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Maybe it is just some animal.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Yeah, probably right. It's probably\n               just some animal. Uh...Cheryl, why\n               don't you make sure.\n\n\n     He hands the flashlight to CHERYL who quickly gives it\n     back.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               Scotty, I'm not going down there!\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Okay, okay you cowards, I'll go.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Scotty don't. You're crazy if you\n               go down there. Why don't you wait\n               until morning.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Look, I'll be all right.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               What melodrama! What courage! A kiss\n               my brave hero.\n\n\n     SCOTT kisses SHELLY and with flashlight in hand, he descends\n     the narrow steps into the cellars blackness.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               I, your virgin queen eagerly await\n               the precious moment when you will\n               ascend.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Virgin queen?! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-\n\n\n     He disappears below the floor. SHELLY, CHERYL, LINDA and\n     ASHLY wait above.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               (Calling down) Hey Scott, see any-\n               thing?\n\n\n     There is no answer.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Hey Scott!...Scott!\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               He's just kidding around.\n\n\n     There is silence.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               Isn't he?\n\n\n     No sounds come from the cellar.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Linda, get me a flashlight.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n               That's the only one we brought up.\n\n\n     ASHLY spots a lantern on the fireplace mantle.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Then get that lantern.\n\n\n     LINDA brings it over. ASHLY opens the kerosene valve,\n     lights the wick, and descends into the basement.\n\n\n\n30   IN - C\n\n\n     Down below, ASHLY moves quietly past the old stone walls\n     and wooden beams which support the main floor above. In\n     front of him stands an old door which leads to another\n     section of the cellar. Cautiously, he moves toward it.\n     Before he can touch it, the door swings open slowly with\n     a moan. ASHLY moves through the doorway and deeper into\n     the cellar. Condensation from water pipes above turn the\n     cellar into an echo chamber as drips fall into shallow\n     pools on the dirt floor below. As ASHLY scans with his\n     light, he spots a shadow move out the corner of his eye.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Scott?\n\n\n     ASHLY breaks into a cold sweat as he moves away from\n     the area where the shadow passed. He backs sqarely into\n     a pair of arms which grab him.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Ahhhhhhh!\n\n\n     It is only SCOTT behind him.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               What the hell are you doing down\n               here, jerkin' off? How come you\n               didn't answer me?\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               When?\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Just now, I mean upstairs.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               I didn't hear you.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Oh well, did you find anything?\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Uh-uh.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               What's this?\n\n\n     SCOTT sweeps his light to another corner and reveals\n     several items atop a small table. Beneath a dusty cloth,\n     he finds a book which appears to be covered in some sort\n     of animal hide, with an ancient form of writing on the\n     cover. Along with this book, SCOTT and ASHLY uncover\n     a reel to reel tape recorder, an ancient dagger, and\n     other parapanalia including a box of rifle shells.\n\n\n\n31   EN - CAB\n\n\n     It is evening as darkness surrounds the small cabin.\n\n\n\n32   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     The group sits huddled around the fireplace talking\n     quietly about school. The same bottle of Scotch is passed\n     around. ASHLY is rewinding the tape recorder, and once\n     this is done, he turns it on. The voice of an old man\n     is heard. ASHLY turns to the others who are talking.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Shhh, listen to this.\n\n\n                             VOICE\n\n               My name is Julian Knowby.

(He sits) All these crazy\n               things going on.

Lemme check on Cheryl. I'll be\n               right back.\n\n\n     From across the room, she is seen opening CHERYL's door\n     a crack. LINDA asks if she is all right, and gets a\n     muffled reply. In the foreground, ASHLY removes the\n     small box he showed to CHERYL earlier and places it in\n     his hand. He glances behind to LINDA. She closes CHERYL's\n     door and walks back to find ASHLY sound asleep with the\n     box in his hand. She reaches for the box and ASHLY opens\n     his eyes to watch. LINDA looks at him, but his eyes are\n     closed again in time to still appear fast asleep. LINDA\n     turns her attention back to the box. ASHLY watches again\n     wide-eyed as she removes it from his hand. Quickly,\n     LINDA turns to him but as expected, ASHLY is sleeping\n     like a baby. She begins to turn back toward the box\n     and ASHLY opens his eyes, but LINDA turns back again\n     in time to catch him with his eyes wide open.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Ah ha!\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               (Laughing) Stealing from the blind\n               eh? It's for you.\n\n\n     LINDA begins to open the box.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               It better be good.\n\n\n     The gold necklace is revealed inside.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Oh Ash, it's beautiful.\n\n\n     LINDA kisses ASHLY. He removes the necklace from the box\n     and holds it around her neck.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               (Fastening it around her neck) I was\n               going to give it to you before we\n               left, but things got so hectic, this\n               is the first chance I've had. Do you\n               like it?\n\n\n     LINDA moves to a mirror.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               It's beautiful.

Through the outside window, ASHLY and\n     LINDA can be seen embracing. This force watching them\n     moves around the house to another window. The silhouette\n     of SCOTT and SHELLY undressing can be seen. The force\n     continues around and arrives at CHERYL's window. Inside,\n     she brushes her hair in front of the mirror for a\n     moment, then sets down her brush and moves to the window.\n     She stops to uncrumple the sketch drawn earlier, looks\n     at it, then out to the dark woods.\n\n\n\n44   IN - C.B.\n\n\n     CHERYL can faintly hear some kind of sound. It is the\n     same sound she had heard earlier from the cellar. A\n     noise almost like that of something breathing.\n\n\n\n45   EN - CAB\n\n\n     The evil entity rounds the corner of the cabin as CHERYL\n     walks through the rooms to the front door. She can be\n     seen stepping out the door. It closes behind her. Wind\n     shaking the tree branches sends dead leaves fluttering\n     about.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               (Calling to the woods) Is anybody\n               out there?\n\n\n     There is no answer. CHERYL steps away from the cottage\n     toward the woods.\n\n\n\n46   EN - W\n\n\n     The breeze animates her nightgown and it too seems alive.\n     CHERYL stops.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               I know someone's out there...I\n               heard you...I heard you in the cellar.\n\n\n     Suddenly, CHERYL becomes chilled. She folds her arms\n     around herself and stands at the woods edge, listening.\n     There is only darkness and sounds of the evening wind\n     blowing through the trees. CHERYL steps into the forest\n     a few feet then stops. A cry deep within the woods can\n     be heard. She freezes. Whispering in the distance grows\n     somewhat louder and a soft wail is heard- like that of\n     something long since dead, dredged up to roam the earth\n     again. CHERYL is about to turn back toward the cabin\n     when a rustling comes from a group of trees about twenty\n     yards behind her. She stops. No sound. Nothing moves.\n     Several yards to her left a twig snaps suddenly. She\n     turns but there is silence again. The winds die down,\n     leaving a deathly stillness throughout the woods. Then,\n     all at once, the entire forest becomes alive in a flurry\n     of chaotic noises and movement. Snake-like vines wrap\n     around her ankles and slither up her legs. Tree branches\n     near by begin to claw and rake at her. The force is now\n     moving through the woods toward her. CHERYL is able to\n     break the vines and run toward the cabin. She emerges\n     from the woods and into the clearing. The force is\n     still following.\n\n\n\n47   EN - CAB\n\n\n     CHERYL reaches the cabin door but it is locked. She\n     begins pounding upon the door.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               Help, help, let me in. Open the door!\n\n\n     The evil entity now emerges from the woods.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               Ashly! Linda! Open up!\n\n\n     CHERYL spots the small key ring above the door where\n     SHELLY had returned them earlier. One by one, she fran-\n     tically jams one key after another into the lock, but\n     still cannot find the right one. The force comes closer\n     with each key.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               Please, someone please! Help me, help\n               meeeee!\n\n\n     The evil entity is almost upon her, but her actions are\n     so frantic that the ring falls to the ground. She bends\n     down to pick them up, but a hand grabs her arm. It is\n     SCOTT who has opened the door from the inside. She\n     pushes him in the door and slams it tightly.\n\n\n\n48   IN - M.R.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               What the hell happ-\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               (In hysterics) It...it tried to kill\n               me.

SHELLY, still engaged in cards with LINDA, holds\n     up one in particular.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               Okay, guess this card.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               How am I going to know what card\n               that is?\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               Guess, I'm going to see if you're\n               psychic.\n\n\n     The card is a two of clubs.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Okaaaay...is it a queen?\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               Right!\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Really?\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               Yeah.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Hey Ash, I guessed the card right.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               (indifferently) Truly amazing Linda.\n\n\n     He is listening intently to the log as it continues.\n\n\n                             VOICE\n\n               Three days have passed since that\n               thing has been down there. I was hop-\n               ing to weaken it without food or\n               water. Nothing worked. Finally, in\n               desperation I dragged her out to the\n               shed and dismembered her so that what-\n               ever it was could not get up again.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               Cheryl, did you see that?\n\n\n     CHERYL remains with her back to them staring out the\n     window.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               Try this one.\n\n\n     She removes a nine of clubs from the deck and holds it up.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Okay, lemme think, uh...\n\n\n     She puts her hands to her head in a curved funnel form-\n     ation as if to direct her thoughts to the card.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               ...Um, it's a seven.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               Oh my God, what suit?\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Diamonds, no wait!

I should\n               have never tampered with the \"Book\n               Of The Dead.\" I now know that what-\n               ever it is I have resurrected through\n               this book, is coming for me.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               You know, I always thought I had\n               some sort of extra sense.

SHELLY bites her lip in\n     fear and reaches for another card. ASHLY and LINDA listen\n     in silence.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               Eight of spades.\n\n\n     SHELLY picks up the card. CHERYL is correct again.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               Two of spades- jack of diamonds-\n               jack of clubs-\n\n\n     Faster and faster she calls them off. Even before SHELLY\n     can flip them to keep up. Suddenly, CHERYL turns toward\n     the group. Her eyes are bone white. SHELLY's deck of\n     cards slip from her hand and scatter across the floor.\n     CHERYL's body is hoisted up to its feet and jerked about\n     like a white-eyed marionette. She speaks in a voice un-\n     like her own.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               Why have you disturbed our sleep,\n               awakened us from our ancient slum-\n               ber? You will die. Like the others\n               before you. We will take you one by\n               one. All of you ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-\n\n\n     She screams in a low gruff voice and collapses to the\n     floor.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Oh my God, Shelly, get Scott in here!\n\n\n     SHELLY does not respond.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Hurry!\n\n\n     She exits through the front door. LINDA moves to CHERYL\n     and lifts her head gently. CHERYL appears unconcious but\n     behind her, she reaches for a pen.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Did you see her eyes? I'm scared.\n               What's wrong with her?\n\n\n     ASHLY begins to speak when SCOTT and SHELLY enter.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               What happened to her?\n\n\n     CHERYL's hand clutches the pen tightly.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Look at her eyes.\n\n\n     SCOTT's hand reaches for CHERYL's eyes to inspect them,\n     but they blink open. The pen in her hand races upward,\n     then slashes down, ripping into LINDA's achilles tendon.\n     LINDA screams fiercely and with a blur, the bloodied\n     pen is raised again. ASHLY grabs CHERYL's arm stopping\n     her, but with a powerful swipe, she swings her remaining\n     arm at LINDA who is sent sprawling across the cabin\n     floor. CHERYL then clutches ASHLY and, almost lifting\n     him, sends his body reeling across the room into a book-\n     case which topples over, trapping him beneath its weight.\n     SHELLY stands screaming as CHERYL now advances toward\n     ASHLY's face with the bloody pen. He struggles to pull\n     himself out but cannot. CHERYL is almost upon him when\n     SCOTT grabs her from behind. Effortlessly, she tosses\n     him off and moves toward ASHLY again. SCOTT climbs to\n     his feet and grabs the axe. CHERYL raises the pen above\n     ASHLY's face, and SCOTT gives her a sharp jab in the\n     jaw with the wooden handle. CHERYL stumbles past LINDA\n     and falls backwards, head first into the cellar. She\n     begins to climb out but SCOTT slams the trap door shut\n     upon her hand. It won't close. CHERYL starts to push\n     the trap door open from below. SCOTT climbs on top\n     and is almost thrown off until he viciuosly rams the\n     butt of his axe down upon her protruding hand. Demented\n     screams and moans are heard from below as CHERYL's hand\n     is finally pulled back and SCOTT manages to secure the\n     chain across the hatch.\n\n\n\n57   IN - LB\n\n\n     Later that evening, LINDA is seen in her bed, sleeping.\n     ASHLY covers her with a blanket, kisses her, and walks\n     to the door, closing it quietly behind him.\n\n\n\n58   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     ASHLY joins SCOTT and SHELLY who sit near the fire in\n     the main room. From the cellar, strange moans, sobs and\n     laughter emerge, then horrible rasping sounds from CHERYL's\n     breathing. Through the next sequence of dialogue, her\n     breathing becomes louder then somewhat quiet.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               She'll be okay Ash, she just took a\n               bad bump.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               (Quietly) Yeah.\n\n\n     SCOTT and SHELLY listen to the strange noises from below\n     as ASHLY looks out the window to the woods beyond.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               We've still got a few hours before\n               morning.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               I don't know if I can wait that\n               long.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               You have to. We all have to. Then,\n               once it's light out, we'll try to\n               find a way to get around that chasm.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               (Covering her ears) Why does she keep\n               making those horrible noises?\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               I don't know.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               And what about her eyes?\n\n\n     ASHLY and SCOTT are quiet.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               What about her eyes? (Desperately)\n               For God's sake what happened to\n               her eyes?!\n\n\n     CHERYL patiently sits in the cellars darkness with a\n     streak of light across her eyes from the crack in the\n     trap door. Her head is slightly tilted as she watches\n     and listens to what is said above. From her point of\n     view we hear SCOTT speak to SHELLY.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Everything's gonna be all right.\n\n\n     CHERYL's lips part slightly and a thick blackish yellow\n     liquid drools out between her teeth. She grins.\n\n\n\n59   EN - CAB\n\n\n     Outside, the forest is very dark. The unseen force moves\n     from the wooded area, pushing over small trees and shrubs\n     as it advances. The cottage comes into view and the evil\n     entity glides up to it. The figure of a girl in the cabin\n     window can be seen looking out. The force stops and moves\n     behind a bush.\n\n\n\n60   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     Inside, SHELLY is studying the woods.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               Scotty, I...I think there's some-\n               thing out there.\n\n\n     SCOTT joins her at the window and looks out.\n\n\n\n61   EN - CAB\n\n\n     From within the woods, this force watches SCOTT peer out,\n     but he can see nothing. Through the window he says some-\n     thing to reassure SHELLY and moves away.\n\n\n\n62   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     Inside, SCOTT can be heard in mid sentence.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               ...Is to get some rest. Ash and I\n               can stay up with Cheryl.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               Okay.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Everything's gonna be okay. Come\n               morning- you'll see.\n\n\n     SHELLY heads to her bedroom. SCOTT walks back to the\n     fireplace and sits. He slices twigs from a branch with\n     the Sumarian dagger and tosses them into the fire. ASHLY\n     glances at the Book Of The Dead, then to the old clock.\n     It stands silent.\n\n\n\n63   EN - CAB\n\n\n     Again, the evil entity watches from outside. It sees\n     SHELLY leave one room and turn the lights on in another.\n     She begins to undress near the window. The force now\n     moves from behind its cover and rushes at tremendous\n     speed to SHELLY who is looking out her bedroom window.\n     She sees it and sheer terror covers her face as a scream\n     stifles itself in her throat, but it is too late.\n\n\n\n64   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     A noise is heard from SHELLY's bedroom. SCOTT drops the\n     small stick he was whittling and looks up. He places\n     the dagger on the floor and walks toward SHELLY's room.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Shelly, are you okay?\n\n\n     She does not answer. SCOTT approaches her door and turns\n     to ASHLY.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Keep an eye on Cheryl for a minute.\n\n\n\n65   IN - S.B.\n\n\n     SCOTT enters the darkness of her room and sees nothing\n     amidst the shadows.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Shelly?\n\n\n     He looks over to her window. It is open, and wind blows\n     upon the curtains.\n\n\n\n66   IN - S. BATH\n\n\n     SCOTT steps into SHELLY's bathroom and sees that the\n     shower curtain is drawn. Cautiously, he moves up to it.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Shelly?\n\n\n     He pulls the curtain back to reveal an empty tub. SCOTT\n     turns back to the bedroom when SHELLY steps into the\n     doorway, posessed. With a scream, she latches upon SCOTT.\n     Her eyes have gone bone white and she claws at SCOTT's\n     face and clothes with her nails.\n\n\n\n67   IN - S.B.\n\n\n     Screaming, SCOTT stumbles through her bedroom with SHELLY\n     still upon him biting at his throat.\n\n\n\n68   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     They stagger into the main room where SCOTT manages to\n     knock SHELLY off himself and into the fireplace. She\n     remains motionless as her head smolders upon the hot\n     coals. SCOTT rushes to her, grabs an arm and pulls her\n     out. SHELLY's face and hair on one side of her head are\n     seared and blackened. She blinks her eyes open, turns\n     her charred head to SCOTT, and speaks in a rasp.\n\n\n                             SHELLY\n\n               Thank you. I don't know what I would\n               have done if I had remained on the hot\n               coals burning my pretty flesh. You\n               have pretty skin- give it to us!\n\n\n     Cackling, SHELLY clutches SCOTT's neck and begins throttl-\n     ing the life out of him with a vice-like grip. He tries\n     to break the hold but cannot. ASHLY also tries but with\n     a backhand blow, SHELLY knocks him into a cabinet, smash-\n     ing it to bits. A garbled cry for help escapes from\n     SCOTT's frothing mouth. SHELLY reaches down, picks up\n     the Sumarian dagger, and holding SCOTT by his throat\n     with one hand, she raises the dagger with the other.\n     ASHLY, slightly injured, crawls to his feet. SCOTT\n     grabs her raised arm and although choking, swings\n     his camping knife from its side sheath and slices\n     deep into SHELLY's raised wrist, almost severing it.\n     A murky black ooze pumps from the wound. She emits\n     an ear splitting- howl and tightens her grip on SCOTT's\n     throat. He drops the hunting knife. ASHLY watches\n     terrified, unable to move as SHELLY raises her dangling\n     hand (Still clutching the dagger) to her mouth and\n     bites it off. The useless part falls to the floor\n     with the dagger still firmly in its fist. SCOTT, now\n     almost dead, grabs her severed hand clutching the\n     dagger and in a last attempt, swings it around ramming\n     the blade into her spine.\n\n     SHELLY screetches along with CHERYL in the cellar, the\n     old grandfather clock gongs and lightning strikes all\n     at the same instant. SHELLY reaches around with her\n     remaining arm to clutch at the severed hand and knife\n     protruding from her own back. A thick black ooze pours\n     from the wound as she bends backward screaming. ASHLY\n     stands in horror, clutching the axe, unable to move.\n     Black ooze runs from SHELLY's mouth as her body writhes\n     about spasmatically upon the floor. Gradually, the move-\n     ments cease and she is dead. As SCOTT slowly stands to\n     his feet, SHELLY's arm grabs his leg.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Ahhhhhhh!\n\n\n     Some force reanimates her, even though the body is\n     dead.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               No...no...no...\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Hit her!\n\n\n     SHELLY's body is hoisted up, jerking about to its feet,\n     and laughing madly.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Hit it!\n\n\n     SCOTT screams this as he backs toward ASHLY who stands\n     with the axe, paralyzed. Gurgling black ooze, SHELLY\n     advances toward them with one remaining arm. SCOTT\n     grabs the axe from ASHLY, pushes him away and slams\n     it into her. Lightning flashes, thunder booms, and\n     CHERYL screams from the cellar. SCOTT brings his axe\n     down again and again in a frenzy. Then, after the\n     final chop, there is silence.\n\n     SHELLY's body remains on the floor for quite some time-\n     until ASHLY can cope with the fact that she is dead and\n     something must be done.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Uh...Scott.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Yeah.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               What is uh...what are we gonna do?\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Bury her.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               You...can't bury Shelly.

Harsh floodlights from the house make the\n     task look very stark and barren.\n\n\n\n70   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     SCOTT and ASHLY return inside. ASHLY heads to LINDA's\n     room to check in on her.\n\n\n\n71   IN - L.B.\n\n\n     He peers in to see LINDA sleeping peacefully.\n\n\n\n72   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     ASHLY quietly returns to the main room.

The shadow of his axe rising then striking is\n     seen over her white eyes.\n\n\n\n79   EN - CAB\n\n\n     Exhausted, ASHLY puts down the axe. He looks off into\n     the woods but there is no sign of SCOTT. He returns to\n     the cabin.\n\n\n\n80   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     CHERYL begins her taunting again.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               Soon all of you will be like me and\n               then who will lock you in the cellar?\n               Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-\n\n\n     CHERYL begins to violently ram her fists against the trap\n     door. ASHLY walks by her to LINDA's room.\n\n\n\n81   IN - L.B.\n\n\n     She is still asleep. Quietly, so as not to wake her, ASHLY\n     pulls back her blanket exposing the bandaged leg. He re-\n     moves the wrappings and looks at the wound. As he does\n     this, it infects with a blackened coloration at an in-\n     credible speed. ASHLY looks up to see if LINDA is still\n     sleeping and sees that she has been watching him with\n     white eyes and an evil grimace upon her face. She lets\n     out a low growl.\n\n\n\n82   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     ASHLY jolts backwards out of her room to escape through\n     the front door. He steps outside and stops to look back\n     in. He can see the main room, but finds it difficult to\n     see in LINDA's room, being lost in the shadows. Something\n     ragged and bloody grabs him. It is SCOTT's mutilated\n     body ripped and torn to shreds. He is still alive. ASHLY\n     looks behind him through the door to LINDA's room. He\n     can barely make out LINDA who sits on the bed watching\n     him with glaring white eyes. ASHLY helps SCOTT to the\n     couch so he can sit. SCOTT is in agony and can barely\n     speak.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               Ash, I think I'm dying. Jesus, I\n               can't feel my legs.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Uh...uh Scotty you're gonna be okay.\n               You're gonna be just fine- you'll see.\n\n\n     He throws another log on the fire.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               You'll see.\n\n\n     He looks off into LINDA's bedroom again, but she is gone.\n     She is now sitting in the corner of the main room where\n     ASHLY is, watching him. SCOTT begins to cough with hor-\n     rible rasping sounds.\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               It's, it's not gonna let us leave...\n               Cheryl...Cheryl was right...we're\n               all gonna die here...\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               We're not gonna die!\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               ...All gonna die.

They're ali-ahhhhhhh!\n\n\n     His sentence is cut short as he cries out in sharp pain.\n     Blood dribbles from his nostrils and he doubles over\n     grabbing his stomach. LINDA begins to laugh. ASHLY looks\n     to her, or rather what posesses her with hatred.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Shut up!\n\n\n     She continues to laugh. CHERYL in the cellar joins in\n     the laughter. ASHLY walks to LINDA and slaps her but\n     she continues. He grabs a hunting rifle from a rack on\n     the wall, loads it with shells, flips off the safety\n     and places the barrels against LINDA's head.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               God forgive me Linda.\n\n\n     The laughter stops and her eyes return to normal. It\n     is LINDA again. ASHLY puts down the rifle.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Ash, oh Ash, help Me! Please.\n\n\n     She hugs him tightly.\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               Don't let them take me away again,\n               please, please, please.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               (Crying and holding her tightly) I\n               won't, I won't- I promise.\n\n\n     CHERYL's voice is heard from the blackness of the cellar.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               Ashly? Ashly, help me. Let me out\n               of here.

ASHLY looks through\n     the crack but sees only darkness. He reaches for the\n     chain and begins to unlock it, but sensing something\n     wrong, he stops.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Cheryl?\n\n\n     He puts his ear to the floor listening for the slight-\n     est sound. CHERYL's arms rip through the floor boards\n     and grab ASHLY's head. He breaks away and her hand\n     reaches for the chain but cannot quite grasp it. Slowly\n     it withdraws beneath the floor.\n\n\n                             CHERYL\n\n               (A little too sweet) Ash, what are you\n               doing? This is your sister Cheryl.

Why are you doing this?\n               Why?\n\n\n     There is silence for a moment. Laughter from behind him\n     begins again. It is LINDA. Her eyes are white once more,\n     and she laughs at ASHLY.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Oh...Linda.\n\n\n     With newly found courage, ASHLY angrily grabs LINDA by\n     the legs and drags her outside.\n\n\n\n83   EN - CAB\n\n\n                             LINDA\n\n               It's useless, useless, useless.

ASHLY moves\n     to the window and pulls back the curtain. LINDA is no\n     longer in the woods but sitting at the edge of the clear-\n     ing, watching ASHLY with her glowing white eyes.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Yeah, tomorrow, soon, you'll be\n               better and we'll both get out of\n               here tomorrow.\n\n\n                             SCOTT\n\n               There is no tomorrow!

You'd like that I'd\n               bet, wouldn't ya?\n\n\n     There is no answer from SCOTT. The water runs out of\n     his mouth.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               ...Scott.\n\n\n     SCOTT is dead. LINDA's laughter is heard again. ASHLY\n     walks to the window and pulls back the curtain. There\n     is nothing there. He turns and she is there! With the\n     Sumarian dagger, LINDA rips into ASHLY's shirt, cutting\n     his arm. He screams and watches in horror as she runs\n     her tongue over the dagger, licking the blood from it.\n     She turns her attention toward ASHLY again but he grabs\n     her and they struggle. LINDA backs ASHLY up against\n     SCOTT, knocking his body to the floor. CHERYL's gnarled\n     arm reaches up through the broken floor boards and\n     grabs at ASHLY's foot. He manages to turn LINDA's arm\n     so the knife is behind her back. Forcefully, ASHLY\n     pushes her over the body of SCOTT and she falls back-\n     ward upon the dagger, impaling herself upon it. The\n     blade tears into her back and rips through her stomach.\n     Lightning flashes, thunder roars, and LINDA screams in\n     a deep growl once, then all is quiet.\n\n     ASHLY drags LINDA's corpse past the crumpled body of\n     SCOTT, past CHERYL, who watches all of this from below,\n     through the back door and out to the work shed.\n\n\n\n85   IN - W.S.\n\n\n     He lifts her up onto the work bench and secures her body\n     to it with a number of chains which hang from nails\n     along the wall. He rips down a tarp hanging on the\n     wall to reveal a chain saw. He starts it up and moves\n     toward her. Buzzing madly, the saw is lowered to a\n     position several inches above LINDA's neck. ASHLY looks\n     into LINDA's face. Her eyes have gone back to blue. He\n     turns off the saw.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               (In a whisper) Linda...\n\n\n     He drops the saw and breaks down crying over LINDA's\n     body.\n\n\n\n86   EN - CAB\n\n\n     An evening mist drifts out of the woods and cloaks the\n     shed as ASHLY carries LINDA's body outside for burial.\n     He lays the body upon the ground and picks up a shovel.\n     Harsh floodlights from the corners of the cabin create\n     strange shadows on the ground as ASHLY digs LINDA's\n     grave. She lies on her back during the digging. One of\n     her eyes opens. It is white. ASHLY drops the shovel\n     and looks at her. She appears to be dead.\n\n\n\n87   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     Inside the cabin, CHERYL begins slamming her fists\n     against the trap door in the cellar again. She wants\n     out. The screws holding the hatch in place begin to\n     loosen.\n\n\n\n88   EN - CAB\n\n\n     ASHLY places LINDA's corpse in the grave, oblivious to\n     CHERYL's pounding. He begins to cover her with dirt.\n\n\n\n89   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     CHERYL has ripped out all but one screw which holds the\n     trap door in tact.\n\n\n\n90   EN - CAB\n\n\n     ASHLY glances to the grave and sees LINDA's necklace on\n     top of the dirt mound. He reaches down to pick it up\n     when LINDA's hand shoots up from beneath the grave and\n     grabs him! She pulls herself up out of the grave scream-\n     ing and clutches ASHLY's leg with a black and bloodied\n     hand. He twists around, trying to free himself, but she\n     will not let go. By now, LINDA is almost completely out\n     of the grave. With her fingernails, she rips into ASHLY's\n     leg, tearing his skin. Screaming, he picks up a large\n     log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again\n     and again, breaking the wood into smaller bits. She grabs\n     the log with him clinging to the other end, lifts him\n     up and throws ASHLY log and all, away from her. ASHLY\n     hits the ground with considerable force and for the\n     first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing\n     he is dealing with. Thick black ooze pours from LINDA's\n     nose and mouth as she turns toward ASHLY sprawled on\n     the ground.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Stay back.\n\n\n     His hand gropes for the handle of the spade. LINDA\n     advances toward him, laughing.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Linda please, if you can still hear\n               me. Keep away.\n\n\n     His fingers tighten on the wooden handle. With a scream,\n     she lunges toward him. From the ground, ASHLY swings the\n     spade upward, lopping off her head. The head falls into\n     the mud, but the body falls upon him, grabbing and jerk-\n     ing about spasmatically. Thick black ooze pumps from\n     her neck and ASHLY manages to pull himself out from\n     underneath the body. He backs away in disgust and falls.\n     He picks himself up again and sees LINDA's necklace\n     upon the ground. ASHLY stashes it in his pocket and\n     staggers back to the cabin.\n\n\n\n91   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     Inside, he looks to the main room beyond SCOTT's body.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               Oh.....\n\n\n     It is a moan from deep inside him. The trap door is open\n     and CHERYL is gone. ASHLY walks over and kicks it shut.\n     A slight breeze sweeps through the front door causing\n     SHELLY's bedroom door to creak open. ASHLY picks up the\n     rifle again and cautiously moves to the door.\n\n\n\n92   IN - S.B.\n\n\n     He enters. The room is dark and the closet door bangs\n     back and forth because of the breeze. ASHLY moves toward\n     it, grabs the handle and slowly opens the door. Only\n     clothes are inside. He turns toward the other end of\n     the room and CHERYL pops up in the window right by him.\n     He swings and fires, shattering the window. CHERYL\n     backs away and spots the open front door.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               The door...\n\n\n     He makes a mad dash through SHELLY's room.\n\n\n\n93   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     In the main room, ASHLY races for the door.\n\n\n\n94   EN - CAB\n\n\n     Outside, CHERYL is almost upon the door.\n\n\n\n95   IN - MR\n\n\n     ASHLY arrives in time, but CHERYL has already started\n     reaching in. He slams the door on her fingers and rams\n     his gun butt down upon them. Horrible screams are heard\n     as CHERYL withdraws her hand. ASHLY is able to slam\n     the door and bolt it. He runs to the back entrance lead-\n     ing to the shed and locks it also. On his way back to\n     the main room, he pumps his rifle in preparation. It is\n     his last shell.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               (To himself) More shells. Where did\n               I see that box of shells?\n\n\n\n96   IN - C\n\n\n     From the basement, the trap door lifts open and ASHLY\n     decends. The bottom step, now rotten, breaks under his\n     weight, and ASHLY sprawls to the floor. Slowly, he picks\n     himself up and walks through the dividing stone doorway\n     beneath the water pipes to a small table. On it, he finds\n     the box of shells and quickly loads them into the gun.\n     He ascends the steps and enters the main room once more.\n\n\n\n97   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     The sound of ticking catches ASHLY's attention. He looks\n     up to see the old grandfather clock slowly winding back-\n     wards. He watches and waits tensely. Turning carefully,\n     ASHLY tries to monitor all the windows. The ticking grows\n     louder. A shadow passes in the window before him and he\n     fires, shattering the glass into a million pieces. Wind\n     whips through the cabin swirling glass and leaves to the\n     floor. ASHLY waits, leaning against the front door for\n     something to happen. He is tense and more determined\n     than ever to survive. He whispers to himself.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               C'mon, c'mon, get it over with, why\n               are you torturing me like this?\n\n     Placing his hand to his side, ASHLY discovers something\n     in his pocket. He lifts it to his eyes. It is LINDA's\n     necklace.\n\n\n                             ASHLY\n\n               ...Linda. (He whispers)\n\n\n     The ticking stops. He tilts his head for the slightest\n     sound. All is silent. From behind, two arms rip through\n     the door and grab him. ASHLY tears away and falls to\n     the floor. The necklace is tossed away in the confusion.\n     CHERYL's hands pull away and she looks through a hole\n     in the door. From the floor, ASHLY raises his rifle and\n     fires at her head.\n\n\n\n98   EN - CAB\n\n\n     Clutching at her face and screaming horribly, CHERYL\n     is jolted from the door.\n\n\n\n99   IN - M.R.\n\n\n     ASHLY places a dresser and chair against the holes in\n     the door. Behind ASHLY, SCOTT's corpse sits up and opens\n     its white eyes. It stands and moves toward ASHLY. He\n     turns with the gun, but SCOTT knocks it out of his hands.\n     Desperately, ASHLY grabs a table lamp and shatters it\n     across SCOTT's head, then jams the exposed socket into\n     his face, shocking him. SCOTT staggers back several\n     steps, then continues after ASHLY.\n\n\n\n100  EN - CAB\n\n\n     Outside, Cheryl is now pounding against the front door.\n\n\n\n101  IN - M.R.\n\n\n     ASHLY picks up a small table upon which are the Book Of\n     The Dead, and the professors journal. He throws it at\n     SCOTT. This does not affect him, and he advances closer.\n     The Book Of The Dead lands near the fireplace and edges\n     of the paper darken from the heat. SCOTT picks up ASHLY\n     and begins to throttle him as if he were a rag doll. The\n     front door begins to give under CHERYL's pounding. ASHLY\n     brings his hands to SCOTT's eyes. With a crash, CHERYL\n     breaks through the front door and begins to push the\n     dresser away. Pages from the Book Of The Dead are smolder-\n     ing now. ASHLY jams his fingers into SCOTT's eyes and\n     slips from the grip. SCOTT clutches his eye sockets and\n     his back begins to smolder. ASHLY now sees the book. Its\n     pages burn at the edge. CHERYL topples the dresser and\n     enters the room. Her face is partially torn away from\n     the shot gun blast. ASHLY rushes to throw the book onto\n     the burning logs, but CHERYL, smoldering also, gives\n     him a backhand blow across the head, and he is sent\n     sprawling to the floor. She grabs a fireplace poker with\n     her crushed fingers and turns back to ASHLY who is crawl-\n     ing toward the fireplace. When almost in reach of the\n     book, SCOTT grabs his leg and begins to pull ASHLY back-\n     ward. CHERYL approaches with smoke pouring from her\n     clothes and slams ASHLY across the back with her poker.\n     ASHLY screams. A glitter catches his eye. It is LINDA's\n     necklace. Grabbing it, he tosses the end with a clasp\n     toward the book. It slides off the cover. SCOTT pulls\n     him back once more as ASHLY swings the necklace in a\n     last desperate attempt. CHERYL raises the poker for the\n     final blow. The necklace drapes over the book and as\n     ASHLY is dragged, the clasp hooks the cover and pulls\n     the book with him. With a yank, he seizes the book and\n     tosses it upon the blaze.\n\n     CHERYL and SCOTT freeze. The Book Of The Dead burns in\n     a bluish green flame. Smoke pours from SCOTT and CHERYL\n     as distant demonical screams are heard from the woods.\n     The fireplace poker slips from CHERYL's hand and sticks\n     into the wood scarcely an inch from ASHLY's head. The\n     bodies of SCOTT and CHERYL then begin to cave inward\n     upon themselves, collapsing to the floor in smoldering\n     heaps. Finally, nothing is left but the burnt clothing\n     and a blackish grey ooze on the floor where their bodies\n     once were.\n\n     The old clock begins to tick again, normally. ASHLY slowly\n     climbs to his feet to stand above the fuming debris. Open-\n     ing his hand, he looks down at LINDA's necklace. The force\n     retreats from him, out the door, slowly returning to the\n     darkness from which it emerged. Gradually, the natural\n     sounds of the forest swell and trees lose their gloom as\n     Autumn colors return. The first rays of sunlight gleam\n     over the woods beyond the cabin. Daybreak has finally\n     come.\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvil Dead\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Sam Raimi\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb", "summary": "An injured, terrorized girl is being chased down in the woods. The men who capture her take her to some cabin's basement. They believe she is possessed by an evil entity so they have her tied to a column. Her own father is among them, and as she tries to convince him that there's nothing wrong with her, she slowly loses control and eventually it becomes clear that she is in fact possessed. In response to this her father pours flammable liquid on her, sets her on fire, then shoots her in the head.\nSome time later, David (Shiloh Fernandez) and his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) meet up at a cabin in the woods with his sister Mia (Jane Levy), and their friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Olivia (Jessica Lucas). The goal is to help Mia overcome her heroin addiction. David and Mia's dog Grandpa is there too. David had moved to another city years before, leaving a younger Mia alone to attend to their late, mentally ill mother. Eric looks at some old photos of himself, David, Mia, and Olivia together, lamenting how David has not been there for them for quite a while, and their own faded friendship. Olivia says it does not matter since he has decided to be there for Mia and them now.\nThe cabin that is owned by David and Mia's family is apparently broken into. Mia keeps complaining of a terrible smell and Olivia, a registered nurse, gives her some medicine to help her through the recovery. Grandpa, the dog starts smelling a carpet and pushing it. David goes over to it at moves it. The group discovers blood on the floor leading to the basement. A smell coming from under the floor leads David and Eric to a hidden room where they discover rotting animal corpses, a shotgun, and a book entitled Naturom Demonto. Recognizing witchcraft practices, Eric starts studying the book out of curiosity. He utters a few phrases aloud, cuts himself on the page of the books and awakening the demons to take hold. Mia is walking in the rain in circles, she senses the awakening and vomits. She sees someone in the woods and asks the group to leave. They refuse, believing that she is just suffering from withdrawal and will do anything to get out. Furious that they don't believe her, she steals keys and jumps out her window. She leaves alone in the car, but on the way out a mysterious, raggedy girl appears in the middle of the road, causing her to crash the car into a pond. She emerges from the wreck and walks out of the pond. Trying to return to the cabin on foot, she hears someone call her name and looks around. The ghoul appears out of the lake behind her. She runs into the woods to escape and is entangled by the deformed branches of a possessed tree. The girl appears in front of her and appears to be a demonic form of Mia. Black tar-like vines emerge from the girl's mouth and penetrate Mia, slithering into her, beginning her possession.\nDavid and Olivia are looking for and find Mia in shock, and take her back to the cabin. Mia tells David that whatever attacked her in the woods is now in the cabin with them, but he doesn't believe her, still convinced that she is hallucinating due to drug withdrawal. After finding Grandpa beaten to death just under the shed, David goes and confronts Mia and finds her scalding herself in the shower. Eric recognizes the same scene depicted in the witchcraft book. David tries to drive her to a hospital, but flood waters have blocked the way. Possessed Mia, smiles evilly.\nAfter returning to the cabin, Olivia attempts to treat Mia as much as her training will allow and gives her a sedative. The now fully possessed Mia shoots David in the shoulder with the shotgun and speaking in an altered voice tells the group, \"You are all going to die tonight.\" Mia falls to the floor appearing unconscious. When Olivia tries to retrieve the gun, Mia reawakens, overpowers Olivia, and vomits blood on her face. She throws Mia int the cellar to contain her, locking it. Olivia retreats to the bathroom to clean herself, and retrieves a second sedative as Eric tries to explain the possession. She sees herself possessed in the mirror. The book opens to a page depicting a woman holding a knife in one hand and her face in the other. Olivia attempts to leave the room and is stopped by an unseen entity, she pees herself. Eric does not hear Olivia and goes to check on her. Eric happens upon Olivia cutting into her cheek with broken glass, which Eric also recognizes as a scene depicted in the book. Eric begins to back away and slips on Olivia's skin of her cheek. Olivia then attacks Eric stabbing him in the chest with the mirror shard and repeatedly attacking him with the needle that is in the other hand. He throws her off, breaking a part of the toilet off and she falls smashing her head on the shower edge. The possessed Olivia, starts crawling towards Eric again with another mirror shard and he grabs the broken piece of toilet and bludgeons her to death.\nWhile David tends to Eric's wounds with duct tape in the cabin's shed, he sends Natalie into the cabin to get water and sugar. A crying Mia lures Natalie into the suddenly opened cellar. Natalie descends into the basement where Mia has her back turned to Natalie. Mia turns and Natalie attempt to retreat upstairs. The stair breaks and Natalie tries to crawl out without falling. Just as she manages to crawl out she is pulled back and knocked unconscious. She awakens to Mia trying to violate her. Natalie grabs a box cutter and tries to defend herself. Mia grabs it and cuts her own tongue in half while licking the blade. She bites Natalie's hand, and shoves her split tongue into Natalie's mouth.\nEric explains to David that according to the book, the demon called the Taker of Souls must consume five souls in order to unleash a being called the Abomination. Hearing Natalie's screams, David returns to the cabin to rescue her, and closes the cellar on Mia once again, chaining it closed.\nNatalie attempts to clean the wound and as the 'infection' starts to crawl up her arm, she falls to the floor. It stops for a second and Natalie looks at the arm and grabs a meat saw, and then tries to avoid possession from the bite wound by severing her arm, and it apparently works. Mia berates Natalie from the trap door, warning her not to cut her arm off. As David tends to Natalie's wounds using duck tape, Eric explains that they need to leave and they discuss their next move. Eric explains that Mia must be \"purified\" either by live burial, dismemberment, or burning; this will end her possession and the demon's assault. As they debate, it is revealed that severing Natalie's arm only delayed the inevitable and a now possessed Natalie attacks the two men with a nail gun, which she has also used on herself. She repeatedly shoots Eric and David tackles Natalie causing her to drop the nail gun. He pulls the nails from his leg and looks up, but Natalie is gone. Eric says, \"Get the gun before she does.\" David sees her reflection in the T.V. as he is crawling towards the shotgun. She hits him repeatedly with a metal bar until Eric shoots her with the nail gun. She turns back to Eric and beats him, splitting one of his hands in half. David shoots Natalie's other arm off with the shotgun, causing the demon to leave her body before she bleeds to death, confused, in David's arms.\nDavid takes the injured Eric outside, planning to burn Mia with the whole cabin, but when she starts to sing their mother's lullaby, he can't bring himself to do it. He decides to bury her alive instead. He digs a grave outside, then descends into the basement to capture Mia, but is caught by surprise: Mia comes out of corner and pushes David into the corner well to drown him. In the ensuing struggle, David is saved when Eric knocks Mia out, but not before she manages to stab him with the box cutter she split her tongue on. As Eric dies from his overwhelming wounds, he forgives David for the past several years. David sedates Mia, putting her in a clean dress and placing a bag over her head, and puts her in a freshly dug grave. Mia awakens half buried; she is still possessed and tries to convince David to unbury her. He sees through her facade and buries her. After she dies, he digs her up and uses an improvised defibrillator to attempt to revive her, as the demon has been exorcised and she is human again. However, the makeshift battery runs out of power and the revival seems to fail. However, as David is returning to the cabin to retrieve the keys to his Jeep, she calls to him. She is saved. She puts on her boots and David returns inside, to retrieve the keys. Having forgotten about the possibility of Eric being possessed after his death, David is mortally wounded by a stab wound in the neck with pliers by a now-possessed Eric. David grabs Mia who has rushed in and returns her to the door. He locks Mia out of the cabin, engaging Eric by himself. Eric says in an altered voice, \"He's coming.\" David then uses the shotgun to ignite a nearby gasoline can, engulfing the cabin in flames, killing both Eric and himself.\nWith their deaths, blood rains from the sky as the Abomination, who looks similar to Mia in her possessed demonic state, rises from the ground and starts chasing her. Mia attempts to hide and flee but the abomination always manages to find her. She crawls through the hole into the shed and retrieves the chainsaw. However she has to fill the chainsaw with fuel to make it run. The Abomination in the shed repeatedly thrusts a machete through the thin walls and strikes Mia. Mia manages to crawl out and under the Jeep and then severs one of the Abomination's legs when it comes after her again. It continues its pursuit, crawling now, eventually overturning David's Jeep onto Mia's arm, breaking her wrist. As the Abomination crawls around the jeep and closes in on Mia, Mia tries to reach for the chainsaw. The Abomination says, \"I will devour your soul you junkie, bitch.\" Mia pulls herself free from the Jeep, completely severing her hand in the process. She then grabs the chainsaw nearby, and stands up. The abomination again says, \"I will eat your soul!\" Using the chainsaw, Mia then says, \"Eat this\" shoving the saw into its mouth, down its spine and up through its head, cutting it in half. The remainders of the Abomination sink into the ground and the blood rain stops. Sunlight begins to shine through the forest trees as Mia walks away into the forest. The Naturom Demonto lies on the ground nearby and slams shut on its own.\n\nThe credits slip to a cutaway scene, which was deleted from the final cut of the original theatrical version, showing Mia walking along a deserted road after leaving the cabin, before collapsing. A driver stops and picks her up. In the car, Mia wakes up with her eyes wide open but is not visibly possessed. The credits continue, during which audio is heard of Professor Raymond Knowby recalling his past discovery of the Naturom Demonto. In a brief post-credits scene, an older Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) appears in dim light, and says, \"Groovy\" before turning to the screen."}

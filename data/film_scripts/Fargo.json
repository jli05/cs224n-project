The events depicted in this film took place\n\tin Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names\n\thave been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been\n\ttold exactly as it occured.\n\n\tFLARE TO WHITE\n\n\tFADE IN FROM WHITE\n\n\tSlowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image:  white\n\tparticles wave over a white background.  A snowfall.\n\n\tA car bursts through the curtain of snow.\n\n\tThe car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car,\n\ta brand-new light brown Cutlass Ciera with the pink sales\n\tsticker showing in its rear window.\n\n\tAs the car roars past, leaving snow swirling in their dirft,\n\tthe title of the film fades in.\n\n\t\t\t\tFARGO\n\n\tGreen highway signs point the way to MOOREHEAD,\n\tMINNESOTA/FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA.  The roads for the two cities\n\tdiverge.  A sign says WELCOME TO NORTH DAKOTA and another\n\tjust after says NOW ENTERING FARGO, ND, POP. 44,412.\n\n\tThe car pulls into a Rodeway Inn.\n\n\tHOTEL LOBBY\n\n\tA man in his early forties, balding and starting to paunch,\n\tgoes to the reception desk.  The clerk is an older woman.\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\tAnd how are you today, sir?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tReal good now.  I'm checking in\n\t\t- Mr. Anderson.\n\n\tThe man prints \"Jerry Lundega\" onto a registration card,\n\tthen hastily crosses out the last name and starts to print\n\t\"Anderson.\"\n\n\tAs she types into a computer:\n\n\t\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\tOkay, Mr. Anderson, and you're\n\t\tstill planning on staying with\n\t\tus just the night, then?\n\n\t\t\t\tANDERSON\n\t\tYou bet.\n\n\tHOTEL ROOM\n\n\tThe man turns on the TV, which shows the local evening news.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEWS ANCHOR\n\t\t- whether they will go to summer\n\t\tcamp at all.  Katie Jensen has\n\t\tmore.\n\n\t\t\t\tKATIE\n\t\tIt was supposed to be a project\n\t\tfunded by the city council;  it\n\t\twas supposed to benefit those\n\t\tFargo-Moorehead children who\n\t\twould otherwise not be able to\n\t\tafford to attend a lakeshore\n\t\tsummer camp.  But nobody consulted\n\t\tcity controller Stu Jacobson...\n\n\tCHAIN RESTAURANT\n\n\tAnderson sits alone at a table finishing dinner.  Muzak\n\tplays.  A middle-aged waitress approaches holding a pot of\n\tregular coffee in one hand and decaf in the other.\n\n\t\t\t\tWAITRESS\n\t\tCan I warm that up for ya there?\n\n\t\t\t\tANDERSON\n\t\tYou bet.\n\n\tThe man looks at his watch.\n\n\tTHROUGH A WINDSHIELD\n\n\tWe are pulling into the snowswept parking lot of a one-story\n\tbrick building.  Broken neon at the top of the building\n\tidentifies it as the Jolly Troll Tavern.  A troll, also in\n\tneon, holds a champagne glass aloft.\n\n\tINSIDE\n\n\tThe bar is downscale even for this town.  Country music\n\tplays on the jukebox.\n\n\tTwo men are seated in a booth at the back.  One is short,\n\tslight, youngish.  The other man is somewhat older, and\n\tdour.  The table in front of them is littered with empty\n\tlong-neck beer bottles.  The ashtray is full.\n\n\tAnderson approaches.\n\n\t\t\t\tANDERSON\n\t\tI'm, uh, Jerry Lundegaard -\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNGER MAN\n\t\tYou're Jerry Lundegaard?\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tYah, Shep Proudfoot said -\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNGER MAN\n\t\tShep said you'd be here at 7:30.\n\t\tWhat gives, man?\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tShep said 8:30.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNGER MAN\n\t\tWe been sitting here an hour.\n\t\tI've peed three times already.\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tI'm sure sorry.

She hears something else - a faint scraping sound\n\t- and looks up.\n\n\t\t\t\tHOST\n\t\tOkay, here goes nothing.\n\n\tThe scraping sound persists.  Jean sets down her coffee cup\n\tand rises.\n\n\tFrom the studio audience:\n\n\t\t\t\tAUDIENCE\n\t\tAwoooo!\n\n\tKITCHEN\n\n\tWe track toward the back door.  A curtain is stretched tight\n\tacross its window.\n\n\tJean pulls the curtain back.  Bright sunlight amplified by\n\tsnow floods in.\n\n\tA man in an orange ski mask looks up from the lock.\n\n\tJean gasps, drops the curtain, rutns and runs into -\n\n\t- a taller man, also in a ski mask, already in the house.\n\n\tWe hear the crack of the back-door window being smashed.\n\n\tThe tall man - Gaear Grimsrud - grabs Jean's wrist.\n\n\tShe screams, staring at her own imprisoned wrist, then wraps\n\ther gaping mouth around Grimsrud's gloved thumb and bites\n\tdown hard.\n\n\tHe drops her wrist.  As Carl enters, she races up the\n\tstairs.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRIMSRUD\n\t\tUnguent.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\tHuh?\n\n\tGrimsurd looks at his thumb.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRIMSRUD\n\t\tI need ... unguent.\n\n\tUPSTAIRS BEDROOM\n\n\tAs the two men enter, a door at the far side is slamming\n\tshut.  A cord snakes in under the door.\n\n\tMASTER BATHROOM\n\n\tJean, sobbing, frantically pushes at buttons on the princess\n\tphone.\n\n\tThe phone pops out of her hands, jangles across the tile\n\tfloor, smashes against the door and then bounces away, its\n\tcord ripped free.\n\n\tWith a groaning sound, the door shifts in its frame.\n\n\tBEDROOM\n\n\tGrimsrud has a crowbar jammed in between the bathroom door\n\tand frame, and is working it.\n\n\tBATHROOM\n\n\tJean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it\n\topen.  Snow that had drifted against the window sifts\n\tlightly in.  Jean steps up onto the toilet.\n\n\tThe door creaks, moving as one piece in its frame.\n\n\tJean glances back as she steps up from the toilet seat to\n\tthe tank.\n\n\tThe groaning of the door ends with the wood around its knob\n\tsplintering and the knob itself falling out onto the floor.\n\n\tThe door swings open.\n\n\tGrimsrud and Carl enter.\n\n\tTHEIR POV\n\n\tRoom empty, window open.\n\n\tCarl strides to the window and hoists himself out.\n\n\tGrimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps\n\taside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent.\n\n\tHe finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing\n\tsomething in the mirror.\n\n\tThe shower curtain is drawn around the tub.\n\n\tHe steps toward it.\n\n\tAs he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated\n\tby thrashing limbs.\n\n\tJean, screaming, tangled in the curtain, rips it off its\n\trings and stumbles out into the bedroom.  Grimsrud follows.\n\n\tBEDROOM\n\n\tJean rushes toward the door, cloaked by the shower curtain\n\tbut awkwardly trying to push it off.\n\n\tUPSTAIRS LANDING\n\n\tStill thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing,\n\ttrips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the\n\tstairs.\n\n\tGrimsrud trots down after her.\n\n\tA PLAQUE:  WADE GUSTAFSON INCORPORTATED\n\n\tINT.

Geez, what the\n\t\theck're you?...  Well, look, I\n\t\tdon't want to cut you out of the\n\t\tloop, but his here's a good deal.\n\t\tI assume, if you're not innarested,\n\t\tyou won't mind if we move on it\n\t\tindependently.\n\n\tPARKING LOT\n\n\tWe are high and wide on the office building's parking lot.\n\tJerry emerges wrapped in a parka, his arms sticking stiffly\n\tout at his sides, his breath vaporizing.  He goes to his\n\tcar, opens its front door, pulls out a red plastic scraper\n\tand starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice\n\tthat has developed on his windshield.\n\n\tThe scrape-scrape-scrape sound carries in the frigid air.\n\n\tJerry goes into a frenzy, banging the scraper against the\n\twindshield and the hood of his car.\n\n\tThe tantrum passes.  Jerry stands pantin, staring at nothing\n\tin particular.\n\n\tScrape-scrape-scrape - he goes back to work on the\n\twindshield.\n\n\tFRONT DOOR\n\n\tA beat, silent but for a key scraping at the lock.\n\n\tThe door swings open and Jerry edges in, looking about,\n\tholding a sack of groceries.\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tHon?\n\n\tHe shuts the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\t...  Got the growshries...\n\n\tHe has already seen the shower curtain on the floor.  He\n\tfrowns, pokes at it with his foot.\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\t...  Hon?\n\n\tUPSTAIRS BATHROOM\n\n\tJerry walks in.  He sets the groceries down on the toilet\n\ttank.\n\n\tHe looks at the open window, through which snow still sifts\n\tin.  He shuts it.\n\n\tHe picks up the small tube of uguent that sits on the sink,\n\tfrowns at it, puts it back in the medicine chest.\n\n\tHe looks at the shower curtain rod holding empty rings.\n\n\tFOYER\n\n\tOnce again we are looking at the rumpled shower curtain.\n\n\tFrom another room:\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tYah, Wade, I - it's Jerry, I.\n\n\tThen, slightly more agitated.\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\t...

Yah, Wade Gustafson, please.\n\n\tBLACK\n\n\tHold in black.\n\n\tA slow tilt down from night sky brings the head of a large\n\tpaper-mache figure into frame.  It is a flannel-shirt\n\twoodsman carrying a double-edged ax over one shoulder.  As\n\twe hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing\n\ttilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a\n\tpedestal.\n\n\tA sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal:\n\tWELCOME TO BRAINDERD - HOME OF PAUL BUNYAN.\n\n\tThe headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the\n\tbackground.  The two-lane highway is otherwise empty.\n\n\tINT. CAR\n\n\tCarl drives.  Grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window.\n\tFrom the back seat we hear whimpering.\n\n\tGrimsrud turns to look.\n\n\tJean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a\n\ttarpaulin.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRIMSRUD\n\t\tShut the fuck up or I'll throw\n\t\tyou back in the trunk, you know.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\tGeez.  That's more'n I've heard\n\t\tyou say all week.\n\n\tGrimsrud stares at him, then turns back to the window.\n\n\tAt a loud WHOOP Carl starts and looks back out the rear\n\twindow.  Fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on\n\this gumballs.\n\n\tCarl eases the car onto the shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\tAh, shit, the tags...\n\n\tGrimsrud looks at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\t...  It's just the tags.  I never\n\t\tput my tags on the car.  Don't\n\t\tworry, I'll take care of this.\n\n\tHe looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on\n\tthe gravel shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\t...  Let's keep still back there,\n\t\tlady, or we're gonna have to, ya\n\t\tknow, to shoot ya.\n\n\tGrimsrud stares at Carl.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\t...  Hey!  I'll take care of this!\n\n\tBoth cars have stopped.  Carl looks up at the rear-view\n\tmirror.\n\n\tThe trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them,\n\twriting in his citation book.\n\n\tCarl watches.\n\n\tWe hear the trooper's door open.\n\n\tThe trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly\n\ton top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night\n\tair.\n\n\tCarl opens his window as the trooper draws up.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\tHow can I help you, officer?\n\n\tThe trooper scans the inside of the car, taking his time.\n\n\tGrimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window.\n\n\tFinally:\n\n\t\t\t\tTROOPER\n\t\tThis is a new car, then, sir?\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\tIt certainly is, officer.

I was gonna tape up the\n\t\ttemporary tag, ya know, to be\n\t\tin full compliance, but it, uh,\n\t\tit, uh ... must a slipped my\n\t\tmind...\n\n\tHe extends his wallet toward the trooper, a folded fifty-\n\tdollar bill protruding from it.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\t...  So maybe the best thing\n\t\twould be to take care of that,\n\t\tright here in Brainerd.\n\n\t\t\t\tTROOPER\n\t\tWhat's this, sir?\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\tThat's my license and regis-\n\t\ttration.

In\n\t\tBrainerd.\n\n\tThe policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the billfold\n\tand hands the billfold back into the car.\n\n\t\t\t\tTROOPER\n\t\tPut that back in your pocket,\n\t\tplease.\n\n\tCarl's nervous smile fades.\n\n\t\t\t\tTROOPER\n\t\t...  And step out of the car,\n\t\tplease, sir.\n\n\tGrimsrud, smiling thinly, shakes his head.\n\n\tThere is a whimpering sound.\n\n\tThe policeman hesitates.\n\n\tAnother sound.\n\n\tThe policeman leans forward into the car, listening.\n\n\tGrimsrud reaches across Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair\n\tand slams his head down onto the car door.\n\n\tThe policeman grunts, digs awkwardly for footing outside and\n\tthrows an arm for balance against the outside of the car.\n\n\tWith his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment.  He\n\tbrings a gun out and reaches across Carl and shoots - BANG -\n\tinto the back of the trooper's head.\n\n\tJean screams.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRIMSRUD\n\t\tShut up.\n\n\tHe releases the policeman.\n\n\tThe policeman's head slides out the window and his body\n\tflops back onto the street.\n\n\tCarl looks out at the cop in the road.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\t\t(softly)\n\t\tWhoa...  Whoa, Daddy.\n\n\tGrimsrud takes the trooper's hat off of Carl's lap and sails\n\tit out the open window.\n\n\t\t\t\tGRIMSRUD\n\t\tYou'll take care of it.  Boy, you\n\t\tare smooth smooth, you know.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\tWhoa, Daddy.\n\n\tJean, for some reason, screams again.

ROAD\n\n\tThe car approaches, slowing.\n\n\tCarl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen\n\tin the headlights.\n\n\tThe car accelerates and roars past and away.  We just make\n\tout the silhouettes of two occupants in front.\n\n\tINT. CIERA\n\n\tGrimsrud slides into the driver's seat.  He squeals into a U-\n\tturn, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin.\n\n\tSmall red tail lights fishtail up ahead.

He is staring down at something in the\n\tfront seat next to him.\n\n\tHis other hand holds open the briefcase.  It has money\n\tinside - a lot of money.\n\n\tCarl unfreezes, takes out one of the bank-wrapped wads and\n\tlooks at it.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\t...  Mmmnphh.\n\n\tHe paws through the money in the briefcase to get a feeling\n\tfor the amount.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\t...  Jeshush Shrist...  Jeshush\n\t\tfuchem Shrist!\n\n\tExcited, he counts out a bundle of bills and tosses it onto\n\tthe back seat.\n\n\tHe starts to take the rag away from his chin but the layer\n\tpressed against his face sticks, its loose weave bound to\n\this skin by clotted blood.\n\n\tHe pulls very gently and winces as blood starts to flow\n\tagain.\n\n\tHe carefully tears the rag in half so that only a bit of it\n\tremains adhering to his jaw.\n\n\tEXT. CAR\n\n\tIt is pulled over to the side of an untraveled road.  THe\n\tdoor opens and Carl emerges with the briefcase.\n\n\tHe slogs through the snow, down a gulley and up the\n\tembankment to a barbed-wire fence.  He kneels at one of the\n\tfence posts and frantically digs into the snow with his bare\n\thands, throws in the briefcase and covers it back up.\n\n\tHe stands and tries to beat the circulation back into his\n\tred, frozen hands.\n\n\tHe looks to the right.\n\n\tA regular line of identical fence posts stretches away\n\tagainst unblemished white.\n\n\tHe looks to the left.\n\n\tA regular line of identical fence posts stretches away\n\tagainst unblemished white.\n\n\tHe looks at the fence post in front of him.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARL\n\t\tMmmphh...\n\n\tHe looks about the snowy vastness for a marker.  Finding\n\tnone, he kicks the fence post a couple of times, failing to\n\tscar or tilt it, then hurriedly plants a couple of sicks up\n\tagainst the post.\n\n\tHe bends down, scoops up a handful of snow, presses it\n\tagainst his wounded jaw, and lopes back to the idling car.\n\n\tHOTEL ROOM\n\n\tMarge has a packed overnight back sitting on the unmade bed.\n\tShe is ready to leave, already wearing her parka, but is on\n\tthe phone.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\tNo, I'm leavin' this mornin', back\n\t\tup to Brainerd.\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\tWell, I'm sorry I won't see ya.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\tMm.

Beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper\n\tand beneath that another form copy, which Jerry periodically\n\tchecks.  The carbon-copy form shows thick smudgy, illegible\n\tentries.\n\n\tJerry hums nervously.\n\n\tGlass rattles as someone taps at his door.\n\n\tJerry looks up and freezes, mouth hanging open, brow knit\n\twith worry.\n\n\tMarge sticks her head in the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\tMr. Lundegaard?

Because, see,\n\t\tthe crime I'm investigating, the\n\t\tperpetrators were driving a car\n\t\twith dealer plates.  And they\n\t\tcalled someone who works here, so\n\t\tit'd be quite a coincidence if\n\t\tthey weren't, ya know, connected.\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tYah, I see.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\tSo how do you - have you done any\n\t\tkind of inventory recently?\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tThe car's not from our lot, ma'am.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\tbut do you know that for sure\n\t\twithout -\n\n\t\t\t\tJERRY\n\t\tWell, I would know.

She glances idly\n\taround the office.\n\n\tThere is a framed picture facing away from her on the\n\tdesktop.  She turns it to face her.  It is Scotty, holding\n\tan accordion.  There is another picture of Jean.\n\n\tMarge looks at it, looks around, for some reason, at the\n\tceiling.\n\n\tShe looks at a trophy shelf on the wall behind her.\n\n\tShe fiddles idly with a pencil.  She pulls a clipboard\n\ttoward her.  It holds a form from the General Motors Finance\n\tCorporation.\n\n\tShe looks idly around.  Her look abruptly locks.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...  Oh, for Pete's sake.\n\n\tJerry is easing his car around the near corner of the\n\tbuilding.\n\n\tMarge's voice is flat with dismay:\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...

Detective Sibert, please...\n\n\tPOLICE OFFICER\n\n\tWe are looking across a steam table at a man in blue.  He\n\tmoves slowly to the right, pushing his tray along a\n\tcafeteria line.  Behind him, in the depth of the room, is an\n\teating area of long Formica tables at which sit a mix of\n\tuniformed and civilian-clothed police and staff.\n\n\tWe are listening to an offscreen woman's voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tWell, so far we're just saying he's\n\t\twanted for questioning in connection\n\t\twith a triple homicide.

She squints\n\tdown toward the cabin's back lot.\n\n\tA tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted\n\tjacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a\n\tlarge power tool which his body blocks from view.\n\n\tMarge advances.\n\n\tThe man is forcing downward something which engages the\n\troaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises.\n\n\tThe man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the\n\tcold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears.  His breath steams\n\tas he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down a\n\tshod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn.\n\n\tThe roar is very loud.\n\n\tMarge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking.\n\n\tGrimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine, which we\n\tcan now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom.\n\n\tMarge's eyes shift.\n\n\tA large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud.\n\n\tGrimsrud works on, eyes watering.  With a grunt he bends\n\tdown out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log.\n\tHe uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine.\n\n\tMarge is advancing.  She holds a gun extended toward\n\tGrimsrud, who is still turned away.\n\n\tGrimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand.\n\n\tMarge closes in, grimacing.\n\n\tGrimsrud's back strains as he puts his weight into the log\n\tthat pushes down into the machine.\n\n\tThe dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of\n\tCarl Showalter's body.\n\n\tMarge has drawn to within twenty yards.  When she bellows it\n\tsounds hollow and distant, her voice all but eaten up by the\n\troar of the power tool.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\tStop!  Police!  Turn around and\n\t\thands up!\n\n\tStartled, Grimsrud scowls.  He turns to face her.\n\n\tHe stares.\n\n\tMarge bellows again:\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...  Hands up!\n\n\tConscious of the noise, she shows with a twist of her\n\tshoulder the armpatch insignia.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...  Police!\n\n\tGrimsrud stares.\n\n\tWith a quick twist, he reaches back for the log, hurls it at\n\tMarge and then starts running away.\n\n\tMarge twists her body sideways, shielding herself.\n\n\tNo need - the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands\n\tin the snow several feet short of her.\n\n\tGrimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep\n\tsnow.\n\n\tBehind him:\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...  Halt!\n\n\tShe fires in the air.\n\n\tShe lowers the gun and carefully sighs.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...  Halt!\n\n\tShe fires.\n\n\tGrimsrud still slogs up the hill - a miss.\n\n\tMarge sights again.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...  Halt!\n\n\tShe fires again.\n\n\tGrimsrud pitches forward.  He mutters in Swedish as he\n\treaches down to clutch at his wounded leg.\n\n\tMarge walks toward him, gun trained on him as her other hand\n\treaches under her parka and gropes around her waist.\n\n\tIt comes out with a pair of handcuffs, which she opens with\n\ta snap of the wrist.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...  All right, buddy.  On your\n\t\tbelly and your hands clasped\n\t\tbehind you.\n\n\tTHE CRUISER\n\n\tMarge drives.  Grimsrud sits in the back seat, hands cuffed\n\tbehind him.\n\n\tFor a long moment there, he is quiet - only engine hum and\n\tthe periodic clomp of wheels on pavement seams - as Marge\n\tgrimly shakes her head.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...  So that was Mrs. Lundegaard\n\t\tin there?\n\n\tShe glances up in the rear-view mirror.\n\n\tGrimsrud, cheeks sunk, eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the\n\troad.\n\n\tMarge shakes her head.\n\n\tAt length:\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...  I guess that was your\n\t\taccomplice in the wood chipper.\n\n\tGrimsrud's head bobs with bumps on the road; otherwise he is\n\tmotionless, reactionless, scowling and gazing out.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...  And those three people in\n\t\tBrainerd.\n\n\tNo response.\n\n\tMarge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...  And for what?  For a little\n\t\tbit of money.\n\n\tWe hear distant sirens.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...  There's more to life than money,\n\t\tyou know.\n\n\tShe glances up in the rear-view mirror.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...  Don't you know that?...  And\n\t\there ya are, and it's a beautiful\n\t\tday...\n\n\tGrimsrud's hollow eyes stare out.\n\n\tThe sirens are getting louder.  Marge pulls over.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...  Well...\n\n\tShe leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling\n\tWHOOPS on her siren.\n\n\tShe turns on her flashers.\n\n\tShe leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities.\n\n\tShe stares forward, shakes her head.  We hear the dull click\n\tof her flashers.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...  I just don't unnerstand it.\n\n\tOutside it is snowing.  The sky, the earth, the road - all\n\twhite.\n\n\tA squad car, gumballs spinning, punches through the white.\n\tIt approaches in slow motion.\n\n\tAn ambulance punches through after it.\n\n\tAnother squad car.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t FADE OUT:\n\n\n\tFADE IN:\n\n\tHIGH AND WIDE ON A SHABBY MOTEL\n\n\tIt stands next to a highway on a snowy, windslept plain.\n\tOne or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling\n\tpolice cruiser.\n\n\tMOTEL ROOM DOORWAY\n\n\tWe are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen\n\twho stand on either side of the door, their hands resting\n\tlightly on their holstered sidearms.  One of them raps at\n\tthe door.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOP ONE\n\t\tMr. Anderson...\n\n\tA title fades in:  OUTSIDE OF BISMARK, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n\tAfter a pause, muffled through the door:\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t...  Who?...\n\n\t\t\t\tCOP ONE\n\t\tMr. Anderson, is this your burgundy\n\t\t88 out here?\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t...

Just a sec...\n\n\tOne of the policemen unholsters his gun and nods to someone\n\twhose back enters - a superintendent holding a ring of keys.\n\tThis man turns a key in the door and then stands away.\n\n\tThe two policemen, guns at the ready, bang into the motel\n\troom.\n\n\tThe rough hand-held camera rushes in behind them as the two\n\tmen give the room a two-handed sweep with their guns.\n\n\tThe room is empty.\n\n\tCop one indicates the open bathroom door.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOP ONE\n\t\tDale!\n\n\tThe two men charge the bathroom, belts jingling, guns at the\n\tready, jittery camera behind them rushing to keep pace.\n\n\tA man in boxer shorts is halfway out the bathroom window.\n\n\tThe policemen holster their guns and charge the window, and\n\tdrag Jerry Lundegaard back into the room.\n\n\tHis flesh quivers as he thrashes and keens in short,\n\tpiercing screams.\n\n\tThe cops wrestle him to the floor but his palsied thrashing\n\tcontinues.  The policemen struggle to restrain him.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOP ONE\n\t\tCall an ambulance!\n\n\t\t\t\tCOP TWO\n\t\tYou got him okay?\n\n\tCop One pinions Jerry's arms to the floor and Jerry bursts\n\tinto uncontrolled sobbing.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOP ONE\n\t\tYah, yah, call an ambulance.\n\n\tJerry sobs and screams.\n\n\tA BEDROOM\n\n\tWe are square on Norm, who sits in bed watching television.\n\n\tAfter a long beat, Marge enters frame in a nightie and\n\tclimbs into bed, with some effort.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\tOooph!\n\n\tNorm reaches for her hand as both watch the television.\n\n\tAt length Norm speaks, but keeps his eyes on the TV.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORM\n\t\tThey announced it.\n\n\tMarge looks at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\tThey announced it?\n\n\t\t\t\tNORM\n\t\tYah.\n\n\tMarge looks at him, waiting for more, but Norm's eyes stay\n\tfixed on the television.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARGE\n\t\t...

Shep Proudfoot, an ex-convict, gives him a name; he travels to Fargo, North Dakota, where he hires Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud to kidnap his wife, Jean, and ransom her for $80,000, knowing his wealthy father-in-law and boss, Wade Gustafson will pay. In return, Lundegaard will give Showalter and Grimsrud a new 1987 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera, and half of the ransom money.\nLundegaard gets phone calls from GMAC about an unpaid loan for sold vehicles from the dealership. These are non-existent, as he is scamming GMAC. He also tries to convince Gustafson to lend him $750,000 for a real estate deal. When Gustafson shows interest, Lundegaard tries to cancel the kidnapping, but too late: Showalter and Grimsrud are driving to Minneapolis. Lundegaard then discovers Gustafson will only give him a small finder's fee.\nShowalter and Grimsrud arrive in Minneapolis and kidnap Lundegaard's wife. However, on the way to their cabin hideout, they are stopped by a state trooper outside Brainerd, Minnesota. Grimsrud shoots and kills the trooper, and then shoots and kills a couple who saw the incident. The next morning, local police chief, Marge Gunderson, who is seven months pregnant, investigates the homicides. After being informed that the criminals telephoned Proudfoot from the truck stop, she drives to Minneapolis. While visiting Minneapolis, Marge reconnects with an old classmate, Mike Yanagita, who unsuccessfully tries to seduce her during dinner.\nLundegaard contacts Gustafson and his accountant Stan Grossman, who at first let only Lundegaard speak to the \"kidnappers\". Later Gustafson decides to deal with them himself. Showalter then tells Lundegaard he must give the criminals the entire $80,000 ransom.\nShowalter phones Lundegaard, demanding he make the drop that night at a parking garage. However, Gustafson drives off with the ransom in his briefcase. At the drop, he refuses to hand it over until his daughter is returned. Showalter kills Gustafson, but not before being shot in the face. Lundegaard arrives at the shooting scene and puts the body in his trunk. The next day, Showalter discovers that the briefcase contains a million dollars (the amount that Lundegaard had told Gustafson was demanded). Showalter removes $80,000 to split with Grimsrud, and buries the rest in the snow alongside the highway. On returning to the hideout, Showalter discovers that Grimsrud has killed Lundegaard's wife. The two criminals argue over the car, and Grimsrud kills Showalter.\nMarge Gunderson questions Lundegaard again, and asks to speak to Gustafson. Lundegaard flees the dealership, and Marge contacts the state police. Following up on a tip, Marge drives to Moose Lake and spots the stolen car. She finds Grimsrud feeding the last of Showalter's body into a wood chipper. He tries to escape, but Marge shoots him in the leg and arrests him. Driving back, a saddened Marge asks Grimsrud why he committed the crimes, telling him there is more to life than money. Later, Lundegaard's location is traced to a motel outside Bismarck, North Dakota, where he is subdued and arrested while attempting to escape through a bathroom window.\nThat night, Marge Gunderson and her husband, Norm, sit in bed together discussing Norm's mallard painting, which has been selected as the design for a US postage stamp. Norm is disappointed that it will appear only on the 3\u00a2 stamp, but Marge is very proud of his achievement. The two hold each other close, and mention that their child will be born in two months' time."}

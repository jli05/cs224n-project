So it reads the PR IC motel. \n               ROOMS TO RENT BY DAY, WEEK, MONTH. KITCHENETTES. The Prince \n               Motel has passed its prime. A few beat up cars are parked \n               outside rooms. We CRANE DOWN to ROOM SEVEN. Curtains closed, \n               but someone is holding it open a crack, looking out. We PUSH \n               in CLOSE TO THE WINDOW and the EYE looking over the parking \n               lot. Then the curtain closes.\n\n               INT. ROOM SEVEN - PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT\n\n               Peeling flowered wallpaper, ultra-cheap furniture. The man \n               moving away from the window is RODRIGUEZ. He is slender, \n               sports a thin mustache, hair slicked straight back. He's in \n               his late thirties. Slightly nervous.\n\n               Another man sits on the couch, looking at a magazine. He is \n               forty, solidly built. His name is FRANK DIVINCI.\n\n                                     DIVINCI\n                         Says here they got slips in Honolulu. \n                         325 a month. Utilities included. \n                         That's not bad.\n\n               Rodriguez sits down.\n\n                                     DIVINCI\n                         But I gotta get at least a forty \n                         footer.

I can't be in Hawaii, \n                         therefore I think about it so as to \n                         not get depressed about being here.\n\n                                     RODRIGUEZ\n                         But I'm here, I know I'm here, I \n                         don't like being here, but I can't \n                         be anyplace else because I look around \n                         and I see all this shit. How do you \n                         get around that?! That's what I'm \n                         asking.\n\n                                     DIVINCI\n                         Focus.\n\n                                     RODRIGUEZ\n                         Focus.\n\n               Divinci nods.

DARK STREET - NIGHT\n\n               Poor side of town. A few old cars parked on the street. Some \n               buildings vacant. A LATE MODEL WHITE CADILLAC cruises past. \n               We HEAR LOUD RAP MUSIC.\n\n               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT\n\n               LIONEL HUDD drives. Hudd is thirty. African American. The \n               MUSIC is loud. His clothes lean to African roots. A WOMAN \n               sits next to the passenger window. Her name is CYNTHIA WEBB. \n               Cynthia is thirty-five, dressed in short provocative skirt, \n               tight top. A little too much make-up. She's lead a hard life.\n\n               She glances at Hudd. Hudd glances at her, looks down at her \n               skirt hiked up on her leg.\n\n                                     CYNTHIA\n                         Left at the corner.\n\n               Hudd's eyes linger on her thighs for a moment, then he turns \n               his attention back to driving, tapping along with the heavy \n               bass.\n\n               EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT\n\n               The Cadillac pulls into the parking lot. Parks in front of \n               room SEVEN. Hudd gets out, looks around. Cynthia gets out, \n               leads him to SEVEN. Knocks.\n\n               The curtains pull back. Divinci looks at Hudd and Cynthia. \n               She nods to him. The door unlocks and opens.\n\n               Cynthia enters. Hudd looks around again. Then follows.\n\n               INT. MOTEL ROOM SEVEN - NIGHT\n\n               Divinci waits at the door. He and Hudd eye each other as \n               Hudd enters the room. Divinci looks out, making sure no one \n               has followed, then shuts the door.\n\n                                     DIVINCI\n                         Hope you don't mind me checkin' you \n                         for weapons.\n\n                                     HUDD\n                         Hell yes I mind.\n\n               Divinci hesitates. This could break the deal.\n\n                                     HUDD\n                         I just don't want no man handlin' \n                         me.\n\n               Hudd looks at Cynthia. The suggestion is taken.\n\n                                     DIVINCI\n                         Okay. Check him.\n\n               Hudd spreads his legs, lifts his arms. Cynthia would rather \n               not have the job, but there's no choice.\n\n                                     HUDD\n                         Lotta good hidin' places on this \n                         body. Check good.\n\n               Cynthia runs her hands over Hudd, checking pockets, pants, \n               sleeves. Finally coming to his crotch. Hudd smiles.\n\n                                     HUDD\n                         Careful. It's loaded.\n\n               Cynthia has heard it all before. She's not squeamish in the \n               least and she gives him a good going over.\n\n                                     CYNTHIA\n                         He's got nothin'.\n\n               She smiles back at Hudd. Then moves away, sits on the couch \n               and seductively crosses her legs.\n\n               Divinci, satisfied, pulls a PLASTIC BAG packed tight with \n               COCAINE out of his pocket, tosses it to Hudd.\n\n               Hudd sits on the couch, opens the bag, sticks his finger in \n               and tastes the contents. But never takes his eyes off Divinci.\n\n                                     HUDD\n                         Not bad, not bad. Any more where \n                         this came from?\n\n                                     DIVINCI\n                         Maybe.\n\n                                     HUDD\n                         Then maybe we talk again.\n\n                                     DIVINCI\n                         Maybe.\n\n               Hudd stands, unzips his pants. Reaches in to grab his cock, \n               but instead, pulls out a stack of MONEY. Inch thick.\n\n                                     HUDD\n                         Told you there was a lotta good hidin' \n                         places on this body.\n\n               Hudd hands the money to Divinci and pockets the plastic bag. \n               Then crosses to the door. Glances back at Cynthia.\n\n                                     HUDD\n                         Bet you gotta lotta nice hidin' \n                         places, too.\n\n               Then Hudd smiles and exits.\n\n               EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT\n\n               Hudd gets into his Cadillac, pulls out of the motel parking \n               lot.\n\n               EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\n               Deserted. No one on the street this late. Several of the \n               buildings are boarded up.\n\n               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT\n\n               Hudd drives. No music this time. His attitude has changed. \n               More serious. LIGHTS in the REAR VIEW MIRROR. Coming up fast. \n               Hudd watches as the car pulls around to pass.\n\n               He glances at the CAR as it pulls past him, but all we SEE \n               is the FLASH OF A BLAST FROM A GUN. Front WINDOW EXPLODING.\n\n               THE CADILLAC\n\n               swerves into a parked car. The OTHER CAR -- a BUICK REGAL -- \n               screeches to a stop next to it. ONE MAN gets out. Moving \n               quickly to the Cadillac. It's dark, difficult to see. He \n               carries a SMITH AND WESSON .44. Opens the door. He's wearing \n               PLASTIC GLOVES.\n\n               Hudd is dead, slumped against the passenger door. The man \n               reaches in, turns off the engine, grabs the plastic bag of \n               cocaine. And now we see it's Divinci.\n\n               INT. BUICK REGAL - NIGHT\n\n               Rodriguez is the driver. Anxious. Engine running.\n\n                                     RODRIGUEZ\n                         Come on! Hurry up!\n\n               Divinci dashes back to the Buick, hops in. Rodriguez floors \n               it.\n\n               THE BUICK\n\n               tears off down the dark street.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n               Not a great part of the city. Apartment buildings line both \n               sides of the street. An alley runs between two of the \n               buildings. A TAXI pulls up in front. HEADLIGHTS SHINING on a \n               MAN passed out in the street.\n\n               Cynthia exits the taxi. The taxi pulls away. She glances at \n               the man passed out in the street.\n\n               His clothes are ragged. He's filthy. His face covered in \n               beard and greasy dirty hair. Hard to tell how old he is. \n               Maybe forty. Maybe eighty. Who knows? His hand clutches a \n               bottle in a bag.\n\n                                     CYNTHIA\n                         Hey, Joe, wake up. Get outa the street \n                         before you get run over. Joe, wake \n                         up!\n\n               She nudges him with her foot. The man groans, rolls back. \n               Dead drunk.\n\n                                     CYNTHIA\n                         You're in the street, Joe. Get outa \n                         the street.\n\n               The man, JOE, is silent for a moment, then he starts to crawl -- \n               toward the middle of the street.\n\n                                     CYNTHIA\n                         Other way, Joe.\n\n               Joe turns his crawl toward the curb. Cynthia watches him for \n               a moment. He is truly pathetic.\n\n                                     CYNTHIA\n                         Forget it, Joe. Maybe you're better \n                         off right there.

He's smiling, \n               holding up FIVE ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.\n\n                                     CYNTHIA\n                         I already worked for that.\n\n               Divinci unzips his pants.\n\n                                     DIVINCI\n                         This is a bonus.\n\n                                     CYNTHIA\n                         For who?\n\n               Divinci smiles.

Rodriguez enters his one bedroom \n               apartment. Starts to shut the door when TWO MEN appear from \n               the shadows. The first is short, well dressed. His name is \n               VIC. The second is large, heavy-set, shaved head. His name \n               is CUTLESS SUPREME. Cutless Supreme is not a man to be messed \n               with.\n\n                                     VIC\n                         Keepin' some late hours.\n\n               Rodriguez looks at Cutless Supreme.\n\n                                     RODRIGUEZ\n                         What the hell you doin'?

But you must understand \n                         that, unlike a bank, I cannot rely \n                         on a late fee as sufficient \n                         encouragement to repay one's debts. \n                         I am forced to employ the likes of \n                         Mr. Cutless Supreme, whom I might \n                         add, contributes significantly to my \n                         overhead. I am the real loser here. \n                         And I am concerned about your \n                         sincerity in repaying the twenty-\n                         seven thousand, nine hundred forty-\n                         two dollar gambling debt that is one \n                         week past due.

Do I have a wife and \n                         three kids? Do I have a good job at \n                         IBM? Am I a handsome guy? No, no and \n                         no. I loan money at excessively high \n                         interest rates to pricks like you \n                         who can't control their urges to \n                         lose big money playing cards and \n                         then I am forced to stay up all night \n                         trying to convince them that I have \n                         needs, too. The point of which is, I \n                         already have a fuckin' miserable \n                         life. So don't threaten me you lousy \n                         bag of cat shit.\n\n               Rodriguez steps toward Vic, but Cutless Supreme slides in \n               between them. Rodriguez isn't going to win this one.\n\n                                     VIC\n                         All I'm askin' is that you be \n                         responsible. Is that unreasonable?\n\n               Rodriguez backs off, hesitates as he runs over his options. \n               There aren't any. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out some \n               of his night's earnings.\n\n                                     RODRIGUEZ\n                         Four thousand is all I got.\n\n                                     VIC\n                         I am proportionally reassured. You \n                         purchased yourself an extension.\n\n               Vic takes the money, heads for the street. Rodriguez watches \n               Vic walk away. Cutless Supreme watches Rodriguez.\n\n                                     RODRIGUEZ\n                         Cutless Supreme, what kind of fuckin' \n                         idiot name is that?\n\n                                     CUTLESS SUPREME\n                         It was the car my daddy stole to \n                         take my momma to the hospital, but \n                         the cops stopped him and shot him \n                         dead in an alley before he could \n                         explain. I was born in the back seat.\n\n               Rodriguez glares at Cutless Supreme, then he shuts the door.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               CREDIT SEQUENCE - BLACK AND WHITE MONTAGE\n\n               CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS -- Dead drug dealers lying where \n               they were shot.

But this is not a high traffic area.\n\n               ANOTHER CAR pulls up. Unmarked. Two men get out.

Special \n                         Agent Lionel Hudd was not just a \n                         good man, he was an extraordinary \n                         man.

It's your \n                         territory. I guess you know it better \n                         than anybody. And that can be worth \n                         a lot.

Hudd was afraid \n                         backup would blow his cover. He was \n                         supposed to check in ten minutes \n                         after the deal went down.

You can talk about \n                         love all you want, but without respect \n                         it's empty. I mean the first thing \n                         that goes in a marriage is respect. \n                         And once it's gone, forget the love. \n                         So I am telling you, I am loyal to \n                         you.

CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               Divinci exits the building. Starts to cross the street to \n               his car parked on the opposite side when he HEARS SOMETHING \n               BEHIND him. He turns, instantly reaching for his pistol.\n\n               A drunk staggers out of the alley -- looks like he has a gun \n               in his hand.\n\n               Divinci instinctively raises his gun to shoot when --\n\n               THE LIGHT -- catches the object in the drunk's hand -- a \n               BROWN BOTTLE, the neck sticking ahead like the barrel of a \n               gun.\n\n                                     DIVINCI\n                              (lowers gun)\n                         You fuckin' idiot.\n\n               The drunk stops when he hears the voice. Looks through his \n               matted greasy hair that cascades in front of his eyes. Now \n               we recognize Joe.\n\n               Divinci turns away, disgusted. Opens his car door, then stops. \n               Caught in a thought. He turns back and looks at Joe again.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT\n\n               Joe stumbles back into the DARKNESS OF THE ALLEY. Lies down \n               next to a trash bin. LIGHTS suddenly illuminate Joe. Joe \n               squints as a CAR moves right up to him. Joe shields the light \n               with an arm.\n\n               We HEAR the DOOR OPEN and CLOSE, then Divinci bends down \n               into the LIGHT. He is wearing a BASEBALL CAP backwards on \n               his head. And GLOVES on his hands. He reaches inside Joe's \n               JACKET POCKET.\n\n                                     DIVINCI\n                         What've we got here?\n\n               He pulls out the Smith and Wesson .44.

Joe is lying in \n               the back seat of a car, passed out, with Divinci holding the \n               .44 in his hand. The back door is open.

Old metropolitan courthouse. The \n               PROSECUTOR and his TEAM are at one table. The DEFENSE ATTORNEY \n               and his CLIENT are at the other.\n\n               The Prosecutor is a woman. Her name is HELEN EDEN. She is \n               thirty-nine. She wears a business suit. RICHARD STEIN is her \n               second in command. Richard is thirty-three.\n\n               The DEFENSE ATTORNEY is fifty and a little on the portly \n               side. His name is JOHN OBLINGER.\n\n               But it's the DEFENDANT that really attracts our attention. \n               His name is CLYDE D. DUNNER. He's done his best to look like \n               a law abiding citizen, but no matter what kind of clothes he \n               wears or how he slicks down his long hair or trims his \n               mustache, this sonuvabitch looks like he'd kill for a nickel. \n               He's on trial for murder. In the first. What a surprise.\n\n               We are in the midst of opening statements. And Helen is \n               keeping the JURY riveted. The presiding Judge is a WOMAN, \n               JUDGE WEINBERG.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         -- when the defendant, Clyde Dunner, \n                         entered the house of George and Carol \n                         Beaman on Friday night, a .44 caliber \n                         pistol in his hand. He entered the \n                         house with one thing in mind. To \n                         kill George and Carol, the people he \n                         blamed for the break up of his \n                         marriage to Carol's sister, Paula.\n\n               The defendant is hardly listening. His attention is on TWO \n               MEN SITTING BEHIND the prosecution table. And he turns to \n               glare at them. The two men are DETECTIVES RODRIGUEZ and \n               DIVINCI.\n\n               Clyde glares at them as if he'd like to get up right now, \n               walk over to them and cut off their heads. Actually, that's \n               what he's thinking. He mouths \"You die.\"\n\n               Divinci mouths back. \"Fuck you, prick, asshole, dickhead.\" \n               Then he smiles. Clyde boils.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         George and Carol were watching a \n                         movie when he entered the living \n                         room and opened fire. George was \n                         killed instantly, hit in the face. \n                         Carol died later of three bullet \n                         wounds to her chest.\n\n               John Oblinger, his attorney, catches Clyde's murderous look \n               and instructs him, with a point of his hand, to pay attention \n               to Helen. Clyde reluctantly turns his gaze from Divinci.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Then the defendant, in his effort to \n                         cover up the crime, doused them with \n                         lighter fluid and set the house on \n                         fire... Carol was still alive.\n\n               A YOUNG MAN, looking very upset, enters the courtroom, shows \n               i.d. to a GUARD, then makes his way down the aisle. He tries \n               his best to be quiet, not to interrupt Helen's statement.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         Ladies and gentlemen of the jury we \n                         will prove to you, beyond any \n                         reasonable doubt, that the defendant, \n                         Clyde David Dunner, is guilty of two \n                         counts of murder in the first degree.\n\n               Helen looks at the jury for a beat, then returns to her table.\n\n                                     JUDGE WEINBERG\n                         The defense may now proceed.\n\n               John Oblinger stands to present his side of the case. But \n               our attention stays with Helen as she approaches the table \n               to find her team in an upset. Their conversation is a tense \n               whisper.\n\n                                     RICHARD STEIN\n                         -- Jesus Christ!\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         -- I don't know where?\n\n                                     RICHARD STEIN\n                         Are you sure?\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         They looked all over --\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         What's wrong?\n\n                                     RICHARD STEIN\n                         They can't find the murder weapon.\n\n                                     HELEN\n                         What're you talking about?\n\n                                     RICHARD STEIN\n                         Dunner's .44.

ANOTHER JUDGE, JUDGE HAROLD PINE, is behind the \n               bench. No jury. This is a preliminary hearing to determine \n               if there's enough evidence for Joe to stand trail. Elliot is \n               shuffling papers in preparation for his opening.\n\n               And at the prosecution table is a very tired Helen. She looks \n               completely pissed off and worn out.

Followed by a CAR CRASH. She turns toward the sound. \n               And we HEAR RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. Then we see a man running.

He grabs \n               his shirt and rips it open REVEALING the TAPE RECORDER \n               strapped to his body, recording their every word.\n\n                                     DIVINCI\n                         YOU FUCKIN' RAT!\n\n               Divinci puts his revolver to Rodriguez' head. Rodriguez, \n               bleeding from the mouth and nose, looks at Frank.\n\n                                     RODRIGUEZ\n                         Yeah... yeah...

Simms knows everything.\n\n               Divinci pulls back the hammer, ready to blow Rodriguez' head \n               off.\n\n                                     RODRIGUEZ\n                         Just fuckin' shoot me, get it the \n                         fuck over with!

Rodriguez closes \n               his eyes, waiting for the end. A tense moment, then --\n\n                                     DIVINCI\n                         ...Get out.\n\n               Rodriguez opens his eyes, looking at Divinci, who is still \n               holding the gun to his head. Another moment, then --\n\n                                     RODRIGUEZ\n                         Frank --\n\n                                     DIVINCI\n                              (calm)\n                         Get outa the car NOW!\n\n               A beat, then Rodriguez gets out. Divinci looks up at his \n               partner.\n\n                                     DIVINCI\n                         This is why you can never -- ever -- \n                         lose your sense of fuckin' humor.\n\n               EXT.

Stands alone in the room for a moment, then \n               suddenly erupts in rage. Ripping off his coat, ripping off \n               his shirt, ripping off the tape recorder taped to his chest.\n\n               He throws the recorder on the ground. Stomps on it until \n               it's shattered into pieces. He stares at the broken recorder.\n\n                                     MAN'S VOICE (VIC)\n                         I guess we caught you at a bad time.\n\n               Rodriguez spins around. Vic steps into the moonlight streaming \n               in through the window. Behind him is Cutless Supreme.\n\n                                     VIC\n                         But we all have problems.\n\n               Rodriguez suddenly YELLS and CHARGES THEM. He tackles Vic. \n               But in the darkness we can't see anything. Until the explosion \n               of a GUN and the FLASH of flames lights up the room. A moment \n               of silence then --\n\n                                     VIC\n                         Oh shit.

Followed by Cutless \n               Supreme.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               CRIME SCENE TAPE - INT.

We PAN SLOWLY around the office until we \n               find Manny in his chair, sprawled back. Continuing to PAN \n               until we see Cynthia sprawled on the couch. But no signs of \n               blood. Just the bodies. The door opens. TWO MEN enters. All \n               we SEE are GUNS in hands.\n\n               Cynthia and Manny wake up with a start.

When Divinci and Rodriguez find out Hudd was actually a \"deep cover\" DEA agent\u2014because Hudd's partner, Richard Simms (Gary Cole) drops by their precinct for help sniffing out the killers\u2014they try to frame anyone else with the murder. It does not help that Rodriguez has outstanding gambling debts, and that a huge man known only as \"Mr. Cutlass Supreme\" (Tiny Lister) is on his case for it. After arresting numerous felons without success (because they cannot possibly link Hudd's murder to any of them), Divinci and Rodriguez arrest a homeless drunk by the name of Joe Doe (Dennis Quaid). While Joe is still intoxicated, the detectives convince him that he shot Hudd. They even make him sign a confession. Divinci and Rodriguez convince local stripper Cynthia Webb (Lela Rochon), also Divinci's mistress, who was the \"bait\" in their trap for Hudd, to \"identify\" Joe in a police line-up.\nAt his first legal hearing, Joe is declared mentally unfit to stand trial (he can not even remember his own last name). The trial is postponed accordingly. Really believing that he killed Hudd, Joe informs his attorney that he deserves to be in jail and is willing to accept a plea bargain. Meanwhile, it turns out that the Magnum that Rodruiguez stole from the police-evidence room to kill Hudd is that of Clyde David Dunner, a murderer and arsonist arrested by Divinci and Rodruiguez and whose case is currently being tried. To fill the void, Divinci gets another gun to replace the other, but during trial Dunner recognizes that this one is not his gun and the case is dropped for lack of evidence.\nAt Joe's second hearing, high-profile lawyer Arthur Baylor (James Earl Jones) attends the proceedings. Baylor reveals that his client's name is actually William Dane McCall, and that he is actually the missing-and-presumed-dead co-heir to the financial empire of a high-status family, as well as a surgeon who used to attend and help the poor. Baylor asks the court to grant a one-week continuance so he can prepare his defense properly. The court agrees. Afterwards, Cynthia is summoned to testify in court. Nervous and afraid, she disappears. Divinci, fearing that she may betray him, hires a bail agent named Manny (Terrence C. Carson) to locate her; when Manny's efforts fail, he is roughed up by Divinci and Rodriguez. Cynthia is finally discovered and brought in for The People vs. William Dane McCall. She gives her rehearsed testimony against \"Joe\", at which time William informs Baylor that he lived in an alley next to Cynthia's apartment. Baylor questions Cynthia and points to the contradictions in her testimony until she finally confesses to knowing \"Joe\". The fact that she knows the defendant as \"Joe\" and not as \"William Dane McCall\" shows that she had previous knowledge of the defendant, thus proving her testimony for \"Joe\" being Hudd's killer to be false. She is arrested for perjury while the verdict of William's case remains pending. Divinci hires Manny to get Cynthia out of jail. He plans to kill her before she can testify.\nOn their way to \"silence\" her, Rodriguez tells Divinci how he feels regarding the numerous murders they have committed. Divinci suddenly suspects his partner of taping their conversation; such indeed turns out to be the case, after Divinci forcibly searches Rodriguez. Rodriguez informs Divinci that he has already confessed to the DEA regarding what they have done. Unwilling to kill Rodriguez here and now, Divinci renounces their friendship and drives off into the night. Rodriguez returns home to find his bookie and Mr. Cutlass Supreme waiting for him. Enraged about the preceding events, he attacks them only to be shot dead. Cynthia is brought to court by Baylor, who strikes a deal with her to testify against Divinci and thus get her perjury case dropped.\nFour months later, Frank has become a fugitive. Knowing that Cynthia blew the whistle on him, he breaks into her home. He takes her money, then shoots and mortally wounds her. Cynthia is rushed to an emergency room at the local hospital, where Doctor William Dane McCall prepares to salvage her organs for needy recipients...despite Frank's previous statement that \"they'll never use your best parts\".\nDivinci forces Manny to help smuggle him out of the country. Manny hires a luxurious car and a driver for Frank. Unfortunately for Divinci, said driver turns out to be Clyde David Dunner...who produces the same revolver used to kill Hudd. He shoots Frank in the head, then abandons the car and body in a deserted alley."}

The sky above\n          is a cloudless blue.\n\n          WOMAN (V.O.)\n          My Father used to say that the only way\n          Evil came into your life was if you\n          invited it. I'm not sure about that, at\n          least not anymore. What I cLQ know is\n          this: we are born alone, and we die\n          alone, and what happens in between is all\n          that matters. The choices we make, the\n          people whose paths we cross -- these are\n          the things that determine our fate.\n          The coyote ducks through a hole in a chain-link fence, weaves\n          through the rusted ruins of a --\n\n          DERELICT AMUSEMENT PARK\n          Broken-down rides, weed-clogged machinery, sideshow trailers\n          bleached bone-white.\n\n          WOMAN (V.0.)

All I know is that\n          he'd been running his entire life.\n          Running for so long that he no longer\n          knew whether he was running away from\n\n                         SOMETHING --\n          The coyote reaches a steep ridge, looks out over a patchy\n          Southwestern town.\n\n          WOMAN (V.0.)

JOHN BLAZE (30s, ruggedly\n          handsome) is running late. He sprints across the workshop\n          floor, shedding his welder's kit as he heads for the time clock.\n          CLUNK! He punches out -- but LITTLE MIKE (50s, trailer trash\n          fast) has caught him in the act.\n\n                         LITTLE MIKE\n          where do you chink you're going, Blaze?\n\n                         (CONTINUED)\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          2.\n\n                         CONTINUED:\n\n                         BLAZE\n          Sick, cutting out early.\n\n                         LITTLE MIKE\n          The hell you are!\n          Blaze jumps on his bike - a muscular, battered BSA.\n\n          LITTLE MIKE (CONT'D)\n          Get back to work or your ass is fired!\n\n                         BLAZE\n          Aaa n?

Screams out the\n          shop leaving Little Mike holding his ears. The other workers\n          WHOOP and HOLLER, especially when Blaze snags a pair of BOLT-\n          CUTTERS from a passing tool rack on the fly.\n\n          EXT. BAD IRON SHOP YARD/DIRT ROAD - DAY\n\n          Blaze skids out of the yard, matching speed with a pickup\n          which is just passing by. COOP is driving. JED and MURPHY\n          are LAUGHING in back. Clearly, they're friends with Blaze.\n\n                         JED\n\n                         (SHOUTING)\n          Skin of your teeth, man!\n\n                         MURPHY\n          (tapping his watch)\n          Yeah, we're on a tight schedule!\n\n                         BLAZE\n          So what are you waiting for?\n          Blaze burns away, leaving the pickup for dust.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          3.\n\n          EXT. HIGH PLAINS - DAY\n\n          A FREIGHT TRAIN thunders across the landscape. To the East\n          Blaze and the pickup are coming on an intercept course.\n          Blaze reaches the train first, climbs the gravel incline to\n          the tracks. Matches its speed, pulls up alongside a bolted\n          container car. He reaches back, pulls the cutters from his\n          saddles bags --\n          -- and skillfully chops the lock with one hand. The heavy\n          iron door slides open, pulled back by it's own inertia.\n          Blaze throws the cutters inside, peels away --\n          -- and comes back with a vengeance, throttled to the max. He\n          jams the front brake on at the last possible moment --\n           The bike cartwheels. Tail over head. Pulls a complete three-\n          sixty up into the car --\n\n          INSIDE THE CAR\n          -- and lands perfectly, screeching to a halt. Blaze WHOOPS\n          his exhilaration. And if you don't believe this, watch\n          extreme motocross as we CUT TO:\n\n          THE OPPOSITE DOOR\n          being wrenched aside, revealing Coop's pickup holding steady\n          alongside the train. Jed and Murphy ride the cargo bed like\n          surfers.\n           Blaze starts tossing boxes out of the car and into the truck.\n          Jed and Murphy stack `em and rack `em. We get glimpses of\n           the loot: CD Players, VCRs, personal packages, luggage --\n\n                         JED\n          Christ, Mickey was right on the money!\n\n                         BLAZE\n          Car twenty-two!\n\n                         MURPHY\n\n                         (LAUGHING)\n          Candy from a baby!\n          The boxes keep coming, like baggage at the airport. Some\n          boxes miss the mark, fall short, get mangled. A box bursts\n          against Murphy's chest, engulfs him in an explosion of paper\n          and polystyrene beads.

Coop waves. Jed and Murphy\n          salute. The pickup peels away. Blaze retrieves his bike.\n          Stands it back up, kicks it alive, guns the throttle and --\n          -- cold jumps straight out of the car. Seconds later he's\n          powering away, ripping up a storm, chasing the pickup towards\n          the horizon.\n           Far, far behind, the police are still coming.\n\n                          CUT TO:\n\n          INT. SIMPSON HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n          CHUCK AND RITA SIMPSON (50s) are eating Chinese food with\n          their daughter, ROXANNE (20s) and Blaze. Roxanne is\n          beautiful, easygoing. She's also seven months pregnant.\n          The Simpsons are simple, working-class folk.

The SHRIEKS\n          persist, and those burning leaves are everywhere. Then --\n          --- movement in the living room! Rodenburg draws a bead\n          but it's Weingrod, pushing through the plastic sheeting,\n          fearful, eyes darting.

Like an explosion in reverse, 4,11\n          fire is sucked violently back into his hellish being.\n          A frozen moment. All terrified eyes on the Ghost Rider\n          Then he lets rip. Hurls the energy back out as a torus of\n          white hot fire that expands across the yard, BLASTS\n          Rodenburg's shirt from his back, SMASHES Pennebaker against\n          his vehicle --\n          The vehicles EXPLODE, gas tanks rupturing. Pennebaker is\n          blown to pieces. Rodenburg SCREAMS, shields his face. Fire\n          and debris rain down in every direction. The Ghost Rider\n          looms over him.

But the pickup is already maxed out.\n          The Ghost Rider easily gains on the truck, leaving a wake of\n          burning asphalt. He lashes out with his chains, snags the\n          back bumper. The chain-links slice deep into the steel\n          bodywork. The Ghost Rider hauls up onto his back wheel --\n          Nomi slams on the brakes. The truck fishtails. The Ghost\n          Rider rear-ends the pickup. Bike and demon cartwheel crazily\n          into the cargo bed, SLAMMING explosively against the back\n          window of the cab.

He releases Nomi, collapses\n          backwards. His fire extinguishes, his skull-face fades --\n          -- and Blaze lies in the pickup bed, shaking. Nomi glances\n          back through the shattered cab window, her face a mask of\n          fear and sympathy. Blaze looks to Gunt's bike, which has\n          also reverted to its original state, then SEES --\n\n                         BLAZE'S POV:\n          The bad guys coming on battered bikes -- Arlo, Chester, plus\n          FOUR OTHER GARGOYLES.

He hefts a 66mm LAWs\n          rocket on his shoulder, LAUNCHES it --\n          Near miss. But the impact lifts the pickup's rear axle into\n          the air. Nomi SCREAMS.

Seeing that the contract would give Mephistopheles the power to bring Hell on Earth, the Rider refuses to give him the contract.\nIn 1986, Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) reaches out to 17-year-old stunt motorcycle rider Johnny Blaze, offering to cure his father's cancer in exchange for Blaze's soul to which he hastily accepts. The next morning, Blaze awakes to discover that his father's cancer is cured, but his father (Brett Cullen) is killed that same day in a motorcycle stunt in which he falls into the ring of fire he is jumping through. Blaze accuses Mephistopheles of causing his father's death, but Mephistopheles considers their contract to be fulfilled.\nIn 2007, Blaze (Nicolas Cage) has become a famous stunt rider. Blaze meets his former childhood sweetheart Roxanne Simpson, now a news reporter, whom he abandoned after his father's death. He convinces her he wishes to make amends and she agrees to a dinner date. Meanwhile, Blackheart, the demonic son of Mephistopheles, comes to Earth, along with three fallen angels. They are tasked to find the lost contract of San Venganza. In response, Mephistopheles makes Blaze the new Ghost Rider and offers him his soul back in return for defeating Blackheart. Blaze is driven straight to the station on his \"first ride\", where he transforms into the Ghost Rider and a battle with the fallen angels ensues. The next day, he meets a man called the Caretaker, who seems to know all about the history of the Ghost Rider. He tells him everything that happened wasn't a dream and that it will happen again, especially when he is near an evil presence.\nWhen he arrives home, Blaze finds Simpson and reveals himself as the Devil's bounty hunter. Unconvinced, she walks away in disbelief. After a brief imprisonment for the murders Blackheart committed, Blaze goes to the Caretaker for advice. The Caretaker tells him of his predecessor, Carter Slade, a Texas Ranger who hid the contract of San Venganza. Blaze returns home to find that Blackheart has killed his friend Mack and already has taken Roxanne captive, threatening to kill her if Blaze does not deliver the contract to him.\nBlaze returns to the Caretaker and obtains the contract. The Caretaker reveals that he is Carter Slade. Slade tells Blaze that he is more powerful than his predecessors since he sold his soul for love as opposed to greed. The two leave for San Venganza. Slade gives Blaze a lever action shotgun before fading away.\nAfter killing one of the fallen angels, Blaze gives the contract to Blackheart. He quickly transforms into Ghost Rider in an effort to subdue Blackheart, but dawn arrives and he is rendered powerless. Blackheart uses the contract to absorb the thousand souls into his body. He attempts to kill Blaze, but is distracted when Simpson uses Blaze's discarded shotgun to separate them. After Blaze tries to kill Blackheart with the shotgun, he moves in and uses his Penance Stare to render him catatonic, burning all the corrupt souls within Blackheart.\nMephistopheles appears and returns Blaze his soul, offering to take back the curse of the Ghost Rider. Determined not to make another deal; Blaze declines, saying that he will use his power against him, and against all harm that comes to the innocent. Infuriated of being robbed of the power, Mephistopheles vows to make Blaze pay, but Blaze tells Mephistopheles that he is not afraid. Mephistopheles then disappears, taking Blackheart's body with him. Later, Simpson tells Blaze that he got his second chance before sharing a final kiss with him. Blaze then rides away on his motorcycle, turning into the Ghost Rider."}

An American businessman.1-He\n          wears a tas eful g3,y suit. He's thin, with distinguished\n          good looks and thin brown hair. He's 56 years old.\n          Rand looks around; fascinated by the vast array of people\n          and merchandise. He stops at a booth. A tiny ORIENTAL,\n          WOMAN stands behind the counter. Rand gives her a polite\n          smile.\n\n          RAND\n          Hi.

Long white\n          hair. Ragged clothes. A rotted smile.

Startled, he turns.\n          The Oriental man stands before him. He stares into Rand's\n          eyes.\n\n          ORIENTAL MAN\n          I can help you.\n          He leads Rand away from the booth.\n\n          ORIENTAL MAN\n          I offer something very different.\n          Very unusual.\n          Rand is puzzled.

No windows. No furniture. Filled with cardboard\n          boxes and wooden crates.\n          Rand crinkles his nose. It su,Qlls bad in here.\n          The Oriental flips on a dim light bulb. He leads the\n          nervous, apprehensive Rand to a dark corner of the room.\n          The Oriental picks up a small, metal box. A HIGH PITCHED\n          GIGGLE echoes from inside the box.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          3.\n          Rand is very puzzled.\n          The Oriental rests the box on a stack of crates. He opens\n          the box.\n          A TINY CREATURE is inside'.\n          The animal is eleven inches tall and stands; upright on\n          two legs. It has two arms, with small; four-fingered\n          hands. Its body is covered with fluffy brown fur. The\n          piercing eyes are big, sad. Its ears are long and pointed.\n          A tiny black nose sits above a wide mouth, with small,\n          square teeth.\n          The creature is smiling. It lets out a giggle.\n          Rand is delighted and surprised. He's never seen anything\n          like this. The animal is more charming than a Disney\n          character.\n          The Oriental claps his hands.\n          The creature leaps from the box, onto Rand's shoulder.\n          The animal licks Rand's cheek.' He laughs, amused by the\n          creature.\n          The Oriental claps his hands again.\n          The creature hops back into the box.

Amazed by the animal.\n          he Oriental takes a bit from the raw fish. Juice runs\n          own his chin. He smiles at Rand.\n\n          ORIENTAL MAN\n          And if you are ever in need of\n          a song...\n          He claps his hands to the creature.\n\n          ORIENTAL MAN.\n          (Chinese; English\n\n          SUBTITLES)\n          Music.\n          Mogwai begins to hum, in an unearthly falsetto. It's\n          beautiful.\n          Rand watches with wide eyes. He feels like a child again.\n\n          RAND -\n          How much?\n\n          ORIENTAL MAN\n          One hundred American Dollars.\n          Cash.\n          Rand removes five twenties from his wallet. He gives\n          them to the man.\n          The Oriental smiles and claps his hands. Mogwai jumps\n          onto Rand's shoulders. Rand pets it. Mogwai emits a cute\n          giggle.\n\n          ORIENTAL MAN\n          It never sleeps. It will eat any-\n          thing... but prefers raw meat.\n\n          (PAUSE)\n          It must always be kept indoors during\n          the day. It lives in shadow. It\n          hates bright light. Direct sunlight\n          will kill it.\n          Rand nods. He takes Mogwai from his shoulder and puts it\n          into the box. Rand puts the box under his arm. The\n          Oriental smiles\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          ORIENTAL MAN\n          Your son will enjoy his new friend.\n          Rand smiles and exits.

In the store, Randall encounters a small, furry creature called a Mogwai. The owner Mr. Wing refuses to sell the creature to Rand, so his grandson secretly sells the Mogwai to Rand but tells him to remember three important rules that must never be broken \u2013 do not expose the Mogwai to bright lights or sunlight which will kill it, do not let it get wet, and never feed it after midnight.\nRand returns home to Kingston Falls where he gives the Mogwai to Billy as a pet. Billy works in the local bank, and fears his dog Barney will be put down by the town\u2019s resident gold digger Mrs. Deagle. Rand names the Mogwai \u201cGizmo\u201d and Billy makes sure to treat him well. But when Billy\u2019s friend Pete spills a glass of water over Gizmo, five more Mogwai spawn from his back, led by the aggressive Stripe. Billy shows Gizmo to his former science teacher Mr. Hanson, spawning another Mogwai, who Hanson experiments on. Stripe\u2019s gang trick Billy into feeding them after midnight and transform into cocoons, as does Hanson\u2019s Mogwai. Shortly after, their cocoons hatch and they emerge as mischievous, reptilian Gremlins that torture Gizmo and try to murder Billy\u2019s mother, while Hanson is killed by his Gremlin.\nAll of the Gremlins are killed except Stripe, who escapes to a local YMCA and jumps into a swimming pool, spawning an army of Gremlins who wreak massive chaos around Kingston Falls. Billy tries to warn the police but they don\u2019t believe him. Many people are injured or outright killed by the Gremlins\u2019 rampage, including Mrs. Deagle, who is launched out of her house on a malfunctioning stair lift. In the local bar, the Gremlins have fun until the barmaid Kate Beringer, Billy\u2019s girlfriend, flashes them with a camera and escapes into the bank with Billy and Gizmo. While hiding, she reveals her father died in a chimney while dressed as Santa Claus. Billy and Kate discover the town has fallen silent and the Gremlins are watching Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in a cinema (and enjoying it). They set off an explosion, killing all the Gremlins, except for Stripe.\nBilly chases Stripe into a Montgomery Ward store, where Stripe climbs into a water fountain and tries to spawn more Gremlins. Gizmo arrives in a toy car and opens a skylight, exposing Stripe to extreme sunlight and melting him. In the aftermath of the Gremlins\u2019 rampage, Mr. Wing appears to collect Gizmo, scolding the Peltzers for their carelessness, thinking the Western world is not ready but comments that Billy might some day be ready to care for Gizmo properly. Gizmo likewise believes so, having become attached to Billy. Mr. Wing departs with Gizmo in tow, while Rand narrates to the audience to check their house if things go wrong, because \"there just might be a Gremlin in your house\"."}

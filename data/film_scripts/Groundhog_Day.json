A FOREST CLEARING - EARLY MORNING\n\n          The crust of an old snowfall still covers the frozen ground,\n          and the bare, icy branches of the trees glisten dully in the\n          early morning light.\n\n           CUT TO:\n\n          \n\n          INT.

PHIL CONNORS' OFFICE - MORNING\n\n          We don't see anyone at first but the office itself speaks\n          volumes about it's inhabitant-- team pictures of the Steelers\n          from the Franco Harris-Terry Bradshaw glory years, a framed\n          memorial portrait of Roberto Clemente, a local Emmy award\n          statue, an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk\n          on the desk, ^windowsill, and every other available surface.\n          As the CREDITS END, we notice a sleeping figure on the small\n          sofa, buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline\n          blanket.\n          GIL HAWLEY, Executive Producer of the Action News, sticks his\n          head in the door.\n\n           HAWLEY\n           Christ, what a pit. Phil\"\n          The sleeping figure rouses himself and looks out at Hawley.\n          It's Phil, the .Channel 9 Action News weatherman.\n\n           PHIL\n\n           (SLEEPY)\n           What?\n\n           HAWLEY\n           It's February first, Phil. You\n           know what tomorrow is?\n          Phil sits up and.thinks hard. He's in his mid-thirties, smart,\n          rugged-looking, perhaps a little too full of himself, but\n          clearly a guy with a lot of personality.\n\n           PHIL\n           (catching on)\n           Oh, no! Not again.\n          He jumps up and exits the office with Hawley right behind him.\n\n           PHIL\n           Forget it! I'm not going.\n\n          \n\n          INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Hawley pursues Phil through the office suite of the Channel 9\n          Action News, from the look of it a typical, big city, local\n          news operation. A logo on the wall identifies the station as\n          WPGH - Pittsburgh.\n          Phil ducks into the studio.\n\n          \n\n           -3-\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Hawley follows him in and catches up with him at the weather\n          corner of the Action News set. Phil starts putting weather\n          stats up on a chart.\n\n           PHIL\n           Get away from me. I'm working.\n\n           HAWLEY\n           So what's the outlook? We gonna\n           get that blizzard?\n          Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed\n          \"Phil's Phorecast\" with a cute caricature of himself drawn next\n          to the title.\n\n           PHIL\n           No way. All that moisture coming\n           up from the Gulf is going to miss\n           us completely and take a dump on\n           Harrisburg.\n\n           HAWLEY\n           (with authority)\n           Good, 'cause you're going up to\n           Punxsutawney to cover the\n           groundhog story tomorrow morning\n           and I want you back here in time\n           to do the five.\n\n           PHIL\n           Jesus, Gil, give me a break, will\n           you! I covered the goddamn\n           groundhog last year and the year\n           before that.\n\n           HAWLEY\n           And you'll do it :next year and\n           the year after, too. When I\n           worked in San Diego, I covered\n           the swallows coming back to\n           Capistrano for ten years in a\n           row.\n\n           PHIL\n           You should've killed the guy who\n           made you do that.\n\n           HAWLEY\n           I wanted to do it.\n\n           PHIL\n           Then you should've killed\n           yourself. I don't want to get\n           stuck with the groundhog for the\n           rest of my life.\n\n          \n\n           -4-\n\n          \n\n           HAWLEY\n           It's a cute story. He comes out,\n           he looks around, he wrinkles up\n           his little nose, he sniffs around\n           a little, he sees his shadow, he\n           d oesn't see his shadow-- it's\n           nice. People like it.\n\n           PHIL\n           Many people are morons.\n\n           HAWLEY\n           Just do it.\n\n           PHIL\n           What'11 you give me?\n          Hawley looks across the studio and sees RITA HANSON enter, a\n          very attractive segment producer in her late twenties.\n\n           HAWLEY\n           (to Phil)\n           I'll give you Rita.\n           (calls her over)\n           Rita, could you come here for a\n           second? I got a little job for\n           you.\n          Rita is relatively new to the station, but very competent,\n          personable, humorous, self-assured and very pretty-- in short,\n          a genuine princess, though Phil is too self-absorbed at this\n          point to realize it.\n\n           PHIL\n\n           (TEASING)\n           You can't send Rita out on a\n           story like this. She's just a\n           cub, a pup, still wet behind the\n           ears. Look at her. Her ears are\n           sopping wet. This needs a\n           Woodward or a Bernstein. It's a\n           big story. People need to know.\n\n           RITA\n\n           (INTRIGUED)\n           What's the story?\n\n           HAWLEY\n           The Punxsutawney Groundhog\n           Festival.\n\n           RITA\n           Gil, if it's all right with you\n           I ' d rather follow-up on the\n           nurses' strike.\n\n          \n\n           -5-\n\n          \n\n           HAWLEY\n           You can do the nurses when you\n           get back. Just take the squeaky\n           wheel here up to Punxsutawney and\n           get him back in one piece. Okay?\n\n           RITA\n           Yeah, okay.\n          Hawley exits leaving Phil and Rita alone in the studio. She\n          knows Phil mainly by his reputation and it isn't good. Still,\n          she finds him appealing in an odd way.\n\n           PHIL\n\n           (PLEASANTLY)\n           You know, this could be extremely\n           interesting.\n\n           RITA\n           I've never done a weather story\n           before. What's Punxsutawney\n           like?\n\n           PHIL\n           Oh, it's an enchanted place. A\n           magical world. It's the\n           Constantinople of the whole\n           Western Appalachian-Susquehanna\n           Drainage system.\n\n           RITA\n           Do you always joke?\n\n           PHIL\n           About 70 to 80% of the time.\n           Inside I'm actually a very shy\n           and sensitive person.\n\n           RITA\n           A lot of people around here think\n           you're not very sincere.\n\n           PHIL\n           Tell me the names of these\n           people.\n\n           RITA\n           I'll line up a crew and\n           transportation. If you don't\n           feel like driving, we can all go\n           up in the van together.\n\n           PHIL\n           I think I'll take my own car.\n           I ' m not that fond of my fellow\n           man.\n\n          \n\n           -6-\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           RITA\n\n           (EXITING)\n           Nice attitude.\n\n           PHIL\n           Nice face.\n           (calls after her)\n           Why don't you ride up with me?\n\n           RITA\n           No, thanks.\n          STEPHANIE DECASTRO , an attractive, dark-eyed, dark-haired\n          correspondent, glares at Phil from across the studio.\n\n          \n\n          INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - LATER\n\n          Phil is in his cluttered cubicle talking on a headset phone\n          while he reviews cassettes of his groundhog spots from the past\n          two years on a small monitor. As he talks, he stuffs a number\n          of personal items in an overnight bag, all the time watching\n          himself on the TV monitor.\n\n           PHIL\n           (on the phone)\n           They don't really think of me as\n           a weatherman around here. More\n           of a \"personality,\" but with the\n           credibility of a first-class\n           broadcast journalist. Once you\n           look at my tape I think you'll\n           see what they mean.\n          Stephanie enters and stands in the doorway looking at Phil for\n          a long moment. There is something vaguely off-center about\n          this woman, not quite FATAL ATTRACTION but still a little\n          scary.\n\n           STEPHANIE\n\n           (BITTERLY)\n           I just want to know one thing:\n           did I do something wrong or are\n           you just tired of me or what? I\n           have to know.\n          Phil sighs.\n\n           PHIL\n           (on the phone)\n           Dan, can I call you back? I've\n           just been handed something and I\n           better get on it...\n           (he picks up some\n           papers and rustles\n           them for effect)\n           ...Okay, thanks.\n\n          \n\n           -7-\n\n          \n          He takes off the headset, gets up and closes the door for\n          privacy.\n\n           PHIL\n\n           (KINDLY)\n           You didn't do anything wrong,\n           Stephanie, and I ' m not tired of\n           you. It's just that I don't have\n           time for a real relationship\n           right now. I told you that the\n           first time we went out.\n\n           STEPHANIE\n           (getting close)\n           Everybody says that at the\n           beginning of a relationship.\n\n           PHIL\n           (gently pushing her\n\n           AWAY)\n           I'm different. I really meant\n           it! Things are really starting\n           to move for me now. I ' m not\n           going to be doing the weather for\n           the rest of my life. I was just\n           talking to the CBS guy about a\n           network job. I want that. This\n           is just the beginning for me. I\n           can't waste any more time.\n\n           STEPHANIE\n           Are you saying our relationship\n           was a waste of time?\n\n           PHIL\n           Our relationship? We went out a\n           total of four times! And only\n           twice did anything happen. It\n           was fun but I don't see that as\n           a big commitment.\n\n           STEPHANIE\n           (closing in again)\n           I had our charts done. My\n           astrologer says we're extremely\n           compatible. There may even be\n           some past lives involvement here.\n\n           PHIL\n           See? So we've already done this.\n           Let's move on. Next case.\n\n           STEPHANIE\n           You know what's wrong with you,\n           Phil? You're selfish. You don't\n           have time for anyone but\n           yourself.\n\n          \n\n           -8-\n\n          \n\n           PHIL\n           That's what I ' m trying to tell\n           you. You don't want to be with\n           me. You can do better. Look,\n           Stephanie, if I ever said or did\n           anything to mislead you I'm sorry\n           for that, but right now I have to\n           do this groundhog thing and I\n           don't have a handle on it yet.\n          He throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and\n          puts on his jacket.\n\n           PHIL (CONT.)\n           I'll tell you what. I ' m going to\n           do some serious thinking while\n           I ' m in Punxsutawney, okay?\n          He pats her on the shoulder and brushes past her, leaving her\n          standing there with a malevolent look on her face.\n\n           CUT TO:\n\n          \n\n          EXT. A HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON\n\n          A VAN marked \".Channel 9 Action News\" speeds along a two-lane\n          highway through the winter landscape of West Central\n          Pennsylvania. Mounted atop the van is a microwave transmitter.\n          Rita is riding up front with LARRY, the union cameraman and\n          techie.

As he stands there, his body\n          casts a long shadow. The groundhog looks right into the\n          camera, lets out a squeak, and runs back into the hole.\n          Rita and Larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the\n          brief appearance of the groundhog.

He starts breathing\n          heavier, as if gathering courage, then, just when we think he's\n          going to cut off his ear or something, he raises an electric\n          barber clipper and shaves a bald stripe up the middle of his\n          head. He studies his new look for a moment then smashes the\n          mirror with his sledgehammer.\n          Then he opens the cans of paint, dips the two big brushes into\n          the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls,\n          madly, feverishly, splashing himself and everything else in the\n          room with it.\n          As a final touch he grabs the bed pillows and rips them open,\n          then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of\n          feathers.\n          Finally, Phil falls exhausted on the bed.

It's so beautiful, Rita is almost in tears.\n          Then, after a pause to let the serious notes sink in, Phil\n          transforms the piece into a fast, lively, upbeat jazz romp.\n          Everyone is delighted, and as the rest of the band kicks in,\n          everyone grabs a partner and begins to dance.\n          An old coot, UNCLE LEO, grabs Rita and the two of them dance up\n          a storm.\n\n           LEO\n           That's a great guy you've got\n           there.

Wide-eyed\n          now, he looks over and sees Rita waking up, snuggling deep\n          under the covers.\n\n           PHIL\n\n           (DISBELIEVING)\n           It's not true. It's not.

I would find myself no\n           longer able to affect the chain\n           of events in this town, but I did\n           learn something about time. You\n           can waste time, you can kill\n           time, you can do time, but if you\n           use it wisely, there's never\n           enough of it. So you'd better\n           make the most of the time you've\n           got.\n          A car skids on the ice and smashes into a tree.

The following morning, Phil, who does not like the assignment or Punxsutawney, grudgingly gives his report on the festivities. He then gets his team on the road back to Pittsburgh, but a blizzard shuts down all travel. The team is forced to return to Punxsutawney and stay another night.\nPhil wakes up to find that he is reliving February 2. The day plays out exactly as it did before, with no one but Phil aware of the time loop. At first he is confused, but, when the phenomenon continues on subsequent days, he decides to take advantage of the situation with no fear of long-term consequences: he learns secrets from the town's residents, seduces women, steals money, gets drunk, drives recklessly, and gets thrown in jail. However, his attempts to get closer to Rita, to whom he has become attracted, repeatedly fail.\nEventually, Phil becomes depressed and tries more and more drastically to end the time loop; he gives ridiculous and offensive reports on the festival and eventually kidnaps Punxsutawney Phil and, after a police chase, drives off a high overlook into a quarry, killing both himself and the groundhog. However, Phil wakes up and finds that nothing has changed; further attempts at suicide also fail to break the time loop, as he continues to find himself waking at six o'clock on the morning of February 2 with the clock radio on his nightstand playing \"I Got You Babe\" by Sonny & Cher.\nWhen Phil explains the situation to Rita, she spends the day with him and into the early morning hours, but they fall asleep together and he awakens again, alone, still in the time loop. Eventually, Phil endeavors to improve himself. He begins to use his by-now vast knowledge of the day's events to help as many people around town as possible, and uses the time to learn, among other things, how to play the piano, to sculpt ice, and speak French.\nEventually, Phil is able to befriend almost everyone he meets during the day, using his experiences to save lives, to help townspeople, and ultimately to impress Rita, without having to resort to manipulation as on previous days. He crafts a report on the Groundhog Day celebration so eloquent that all the other stations turn their microphones to him. After the town's evening dance, Rita \"buys\" Phil at the event's bachelor auction. Phil makes a snow sculpture of Rita's face and they kiss, then retire to his room. He wakes the next morning and finds the time loop is broken; it is now February 3 and Rita is still with him. They walk outside and Phil proposes that they move to Punxsutawney together."}

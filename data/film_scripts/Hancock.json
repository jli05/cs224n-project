Except for the,\n          paleness, it looked healthy, well-fed.\n          The end came abruptly you could tell\n          'cause the mouth froze in mid-sentence.\n          \"Shh.  ,\" the curled lips attempted.

They endure\n          in you forever because the senses have a\n          brain all their own and they recall long\n          after you've succumbed to the la-la of\n          forgetfulness.\n          (a pregnant beat)\n          Sometimes when it's dark out,-so dark\n          it's black, I'll see HIM.\n\n          (BEAT)\n          And it starts all over again.\n          From this blackness, a streak of LIGHTNING splits the night sky.\n\n          EXT. SKY - NIGHT\n\n           We are in the eye of a STORM, an angry mass of clo uds raging\n          o f a howling WIND. across the black sky..It brings RAIN and THUNDER an d the swirl\n          An ENTITY emerges from this moist darkness.\n          weather and advances into our scope of visibilityies through the\n          A FLASH, of lightning erupts and it illuminates the sky. We SEE\n          the approaching entity as it hovers before us.\n          It's a man.\n          It's a man, plus.\n          It's a SUPERHERO,\n          garbed in an elastic dark-grey outfit - a faded RED CAPE extends b\n          ehind him, thrashing against the wind and rain.\n          This Superhero (30). Unshaven.\n          Disheveled. Worn. A face\n          chiselled with mileage.\n          \n\n          \n\n          2.\n          In the eyes, we can see his soul. Intense. Fierce. An exposed\n          nerve, snagged in a fish hook.\n          He hangs in the air, tired, rain-soaked, pissed-off.\n          He stares down at the earth below and he beholds the saturated\n          visage of SHEEPSHEAD BAY, a seaside Brooklyn neighborhood.\n          And from the bowels of his very soul, this Superhero belches a\n          thunderous ROAR. He pivots in the air and dives toward land.\n          He slices through the downpour, arms extended, body erect,\n          engulfed in the dimensions of his cape.\n          The ground approaches, fast. He accelerates as if to embrace it.\n          Velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is IMPACT.\n          An EXPLOSION as he rips through the street surface, penetrating\n          the asphalt - head first. Debris and concrete spew from the\n          ruptured orifice as he disappears inside.\n          There is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it launches\n          nearby manhole LIDS from their spots - they bounce and CLANG\n          down the street like loose change.\n          The rain continues its onslaught.\n\n          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n          Rain sloshes against a kitchen window. Where the sink is. Not\n          far from the kitchen table. Where the LONGFELLOW Family sits,\n          dinner before them.\n          HORUS (35) leans over his plate, eating his meal. Here idles a\n          man of diminutive frame, bespectacled, placid - as harmless as\n          low fat milk.\n          He sits opposite MARY (30), frenetically appropriating food. A\n          gentle beauty. entwined in maternal angst she is estrogen with an\n          attitude.\n          A meek little AARON (8), slouches between the folks - a BLACK\n          EYE tattoos the left of his face. Aaron stares at the damn\n          plate, finding no humor in eggplant.\n\n          MARY\n          The principal did'nothing. Like\n          schoolyard terrorism is no worse than\n          being tardy. What's the matter with\n          education? Back when, you could go to\n          school and learn about Betsy Ross and...\n          mollusks and... not get stabbed on the\n          way home.\n          \n\n          4.\n\n          INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT\n\n          A subway TRAM idles by a passenger ramp. STEAM hisses from its\n          side and plumes into a wall of white mist.\n          And from this cloud of angry vapors, a figure appears. He\n          surfaces from the dark subway tunnel, a cool nonchalance in his\n          gait.\n          It is the Superhero, his identity safely concealed under the\n          collar of a tattered TRENCHCOAT. He traverses the loading deck,\n          PASSENGERS boarding and disembarking around him.\n          He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway. He\n          strolls over to a CIGARETTE MACHINE, up against the grafetti-\n          raped subway wall.\n          On the wall, a line of profanity declares that...\n\n          \"YOUR MOTHER TAKES IT UP THE ASS.\"\n          He surveys the machine. His right arm appears from the coat\n          pocket. Fingers merge into a tight fist. And casually, he rips\n          into the metal vendor like it was Jello.\n          His fist withdraws a handful of bills, coins. He pockets the\n          loot. He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of LUCKY STRIKE.\n          Deposits it under his coat.\n          And with that, he heads for the stairs - to the flooded streets\n          above.\n          At the ramp, and on cue, the subway tram closes its doors.\n          Trembles. Moves. Steams into the deep dark tunnel. White SMOKE\n          mushrooms from its tail. It lingers in the air as we...\n\n          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n          see STEAM, rising from a faucet of running HOT water.\n          It rises from a sink of soiled dishes - where Mary deposits\n          another set of pots. She's clearing the table.\n          Down a dark hallway, a streak of light escapes from an open\n          door. Inside and on the bed, the frail posture of Horus changes\n          out of his clothes.\n\n          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n          Horus disrobes down to his t-shirt and briefs. He stands before\n          the closet mirror, scrutinizing the emaciated, sand-kicked-in-\n          the-face body.\n\n\n          5.\n           Horns strikes\n           a He-man pose, his\n           biceps in the\n           wind.\n\n           He removes the Police apparel,\n           plastic. Proceeds to put it on.\n\n   \n          INT.

Grabs a random KEY from a nail.\n\n          FISH\n          Top floor, 7F. Fifteen a pop, up front.\n          (re: the check-in sheet)\n          And your John Hancock makes it sweet.\n          The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN sheet. Scribbles\n\n          HANCOCK\n          on the dotted line.\n          Fish hands over the key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock's\n          grab.\n\n          FISH (CONT'D)\n          I don't take messages, I don't do favors,\n          and I don't know you from Jack. You want\n          sheets, they're extra. Towel's extra.\n          Plunger's extra.\n\n          HANCOCK\n          I need quiet. Is it quiet?\n\n          FISH\n          Quiet? Hey pal, we look like a public\n          library to you? The girls work. Some of\n          them scream, some of them moan...\n\n          (SMILES)\n          and some of them just kinda lay there\n          cold. You want quiet, I got cotton balls\n          you can stick in your ear. They're extra.\n\n          Hancock eyes Fish, mentally dissecting the vermin with his bare\n          hands. He withdraws from his coat the WAD of loot. Pushes it\n          under the window.\n\n          And while Fish collects, he leans into the window and emits a\n          deep GROWL. Fish recoils. The bills fly.\n\n          Hancock takes the key. Exchanges it with a metal ORB - the\n          strangulated remains of the bell. It rolls out of his palm and\n          CLINKS off the counter.\n          Hancock sidles off. Fish - the cat's got his tongue.\n\n          INT.

And we\n          SEE it to be a FLASHLIGHT.\n          A shoulder patch reads...\n\n          U-RENT SECURITY CO.\n          Their motto: \"TO OBSERVE AND RECORD\"\n          Horus tucks a hat under his arms, ready to move.\n\n          INT. AARON'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n          A jar of MARBLES rests upon a window ledge. Outside, the story\n          is rain.\n          On a bed, sprawled on his back, Aaron gazes up at the empty\n          ceiling - the black eye squats prominently on his face.\n          Aaron brings his hand before his eyes. Looks at it. Studies it.\n          Slowly, his fingers converge into a tight FIST - a boy's\n          interpretation of a man's weapon.\n          A gentle KNOCK disperses the knuckles. Horus peers in.\n\n          HORUS\n          How's the eye?\n\n          AARON\n          Black.\n          Horus enters.\n          Stands awkwardly before his son.\n\n          HORUS\n          It'll be gone in a week.

And I don't want any girly\n          make-up on my face.\n          Horus deposits himself on the bed.

I love you.\n          I ask you to do that for me... your old\n          man.\n          And while he utters these words, Mary watches from the dark\n          hallway - moved b y his affection.\n          She oversees a father-son embrace.\n\n          HORUS (CONT'D)\n          I'm late for work.

Moves her lips to his ear, enraptured\n\n          BY\n          the moment.\n          And out of nowhere...\n\n          HORUS (CONT'D)\n\n          (AWKWARD)\n          I'm late.\n          Mary snaps from her trance.

Though he uses his powers to stop criminals in his current residence of Los Angeles, his activity inadvertently causes millions of dollars in property damage due to his constant intoxication. As a result, he is routinely jeered at the crime scenes. Hancock also ignores court subpoenas from the city of Los Angeles to address the property damage he has caused.\nWhen public relations spokesperson Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) departs from an unsuccessful meeting pitching his All-Heart logo for corporations who are extraordinarily charitable, he becomes trapped on railroad tracks with an incoming freight train. Hancock saves Ray's life, but he causes the train to derail and nearly injures another driver. Hancock is jeered by other drivers for causing more damage, but Ray steps in and thanks Hancock for saving his life. Ray offers to improve Hancock's public image, and Hancock grudgingly accepts. The spokesperson convinces the alcoholic superhero to permit himself to be jailed for outstanding subpoenas so they can show Los Angeles how much the city really needs Hancock. When the crime rate rises after Hancock's incarceration, the superhero is contacted by the Chief of Police. With a new costume from Ray, Hancock intervenes with a bank robbery, rescuing a cop and stopping the leader of the robbers, Red Parker (Eddie Marsan).\nAfter the rescue, Hancock is applauded for handling the bank robbery. The superhero becomes popular once more, as Ray had predicted. He goes out to dinner with Ray and his wife Mary (Charlize Theron), with whom he reveals his apparent immortality and his amnesia from 80 years ago. After Hancock tucks a drunken Ray in bed, he discovers that Mary also has superhero powers. He threatens to expose her until she explains their origins, and she tells him that they have lived for 3,000 years with their powers, having been called gods and angels in their time. She explains that they are the last of their kind and that their kind are paired. Mary does not tell Hancock the entire truth, and Hancock departs to tell Ray about the conversation. The exchange results in a battle between Hancock and Mary that takes them to downtown Los Angeles, causing significant damage to the area. Ray, downtown in a business meeting, sees and recognizes Mary using superhero powers like Hancock.\nHancock is later shot twice in the chest and wounded when he stops a liquor store robbery. After being hospitalized, Mary enters and explains that as the pair of immortals gets close, they begin to lose their powers. She also explains that Hancock was attacked in an alley 80 years prior, where he obtained amnesia. Mary deserted him then in order for him to recover from his injuries. When he is hospitalized, the hospital is raided by Red Parker, the bank robber, and two men that Hancock had humiliated during his incarceration. Mary, visiting Hancock, is shot in the process. Hancock is able to stop two men but is further wounded by them. When Red attempts to finish Hancock off, Ray comes to the rescue and kills the bank robber with a fire axe. With Mary nearly dying, Hancock flees from the hospital so their parting would allow her to heal with her powers. He later winds up in New York City, working as a superhero. Ray is seen walking with Mary discussing historical events such as the reign of Attila the Hun in a jovial manner. As gratitude to Ray, Hancock paints Ray's All-Heart logo on the moon and calls the spokesperson to look up to the worldwide advertisement.\nIn a mid-credits scene, Hancock, now living in New York City, confronts a fleeing criminal with the police. Cornered, the man takes a hostage and jeeringly demands Hancock escort him to safety. Hancock turns back and smiles as the credits resume."}

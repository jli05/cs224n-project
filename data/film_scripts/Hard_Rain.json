HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM\n\n               Tom wades through the classroom, pushing floating desks aside. \n               Flashlight beams stab into the room. Tom hurries to the hall.\n\n               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL\n\n               Jim turns to his men.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         Let's get him out.

The water is swirling quietly, still a good three \n               feet below the top of the wall.\n\n               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - WELCOME SIGN\n\n               Close on the lighted \"Welcome to Huntingburg\" sign. There's \n               a rushing sound and a two-foot-high wall of water hits the \n               sign. The lights explode in geysers of sparks and the water \n               rushes on.\n\n               EXT. PARK AREA\n\n               The Sheriff and Wayne are racing through a grove of half-\n               submerged trees. There's a rushing sound above the sound of \n               the engines. WHAM! and they're hit by the wall of water. \n               Wayne falls out of his boat and is lost in the swirling water.\n\n               EXT. ALLEYWAY\n\n               Jim and his men are motoring down an alleyway when...\n\n               THE WALL OF WATER\n\n               Rushes down the alley.\n\n               RAY\n\n               The water hits him hard, knocking him off the jet-ski. He's \n               swept away by the water.\n\n               CLOSE ON A FENCE LACED WITH CONCERTINA WIRE\n\n               The surge water shoots through it. And suddenly there's...\n\n               RAY\n\n               Slammed up against the fence, pinned to it, water rushing \n               over and around and by him. He yells as the wire cuts into \n               him.\n\n               EXT. CHURCH\n\n               Karen is pouring gasoline into the pumps.\n\n               She hears the rushing and looks up as the surge hits. Water \n               shoots over the top.\n\n               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION\n\n               Tom hears the sound and opens his eyes -- what the hell is \n               that?\n\n               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION\n\n               The wall of water slams in hard, cascading over the sandbag \n               wall.\n\n               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION\n\n               TOM SITS UP, SWINGING HIS LEGS OVER THE SIDE OF THE COT. HE \n               REACTS, LOOKS DOWN. HIS POV\n\n               There's two feet of water in the station.\n\n               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION\n\n               The building is like a rock in a stream, with the water \n               rushing up high against one wall, roiling and swirling around \n               the sides.\n\n               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION\n\n               Tom looks over, stunned, to see... THE DOOR\n\n               As a fine stream spits in through the keyhole.\n\n               THE WINDOWS\n\n               Are heaving as the water rises up against them.\n\n               TOM\n\n               Gets to his feet, woozy and goes to get out of the cell. He \n               remembers -- uh-oh: the cell door is locked.\n\n               EXT. ALLEYWAY\n\n               Jim pulls Ray, coughing, choking, bleeding, into the ski-\n               boat.\n\n               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION\n\n               The water level inside is rising fast. It hits the wall \n               sockets and there's a spit of sparks, then all the desk lamps \n               go dark. Light still comes from overhead fluorescent panels. \n               Tom sees...\n\n               TWO KEYS ON A KEY RING\n\n               Laying on the Sheriff's wooden desk. They're four feet away -- \n               too far to reach.\n\n               EXT. CHURCH\n\n               Karen suddenly has a horrible thought and stops. She shakes \n               it off -- doesn't want to think about it -- and mutters to \n               herself.\n\n                                     KAREN\n                         They'll get him out.\n\n               EXT. MAIN STREET\n\n               Phil is clinging to the statue as the water surges by below \n               him.\n\n               EXT. PARK AREA\n\n               Wayne gets back into his boat. The Sheriff realizes something.\n\n                                     SHERIFF\n                         Wayne... You locked him in.\n\n               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION\n\n               Tom looks through the cell bars at wooden chairs bobbing in \n               the water. The Sheriff's desk lifts up, starts floating. Tom \n               gets an idea. He takes his belt off.\n\n               EXT. NEAR SHERIFF'S STATION\n\n               A telephone pole is half-submerged, being pulled along fast \n               by the current.\n\n               INT. SHERIFF'S STATION\n\n               Tom holds one end of the belt and tosses the rest of it at...\n\n               THE DESK\n\n               Bobbing in the rising water. He misses the keys.\n\n               TOM AND THE DESK\n\n               Tom tries again. The belt lands on the desk top.\n\n               Tom very gently starts pulling. Too hard; the belt starts \n               slipping off the desk. He gets it just right and the desk \n               starts moving toward Tom. He reaches out with his hand, \n               stretching.\n\n               HIS FINGERS\n\n               Touch the top of the desk, start pulling it toward him, and \n               he just gets a firm grip on the desk when...\n\n               THE TELEPHONE POLE\n\n               Smashes into a window, bending in the bars on the window, \n               shattering the glass, letting a torrent of water into the \n               room.\n\n               THE DESK\n\n               Is moved by the rush of water, but not before Tom grabs...\n\n               THE KEYS\n\n               And grips them tight.\n\n               TOM\n\n               Tries the keys in the lock. They don't fit. He looks at them.\n\n               CU KEYS\n\n               The tag is emblazoned with the Ford logo.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         Great! I can drive out of here!\n\n               Tom tosses the keys into the water and looks around at...\n\n               THE WATER LEVEL\n\n               Rising very fast. A foot in ten seconds.\n\n               TOM\n\n               Climbs up the cell bars, the water rising with him. He's \n               running out of room between himself and the ceiling. Three \n               feet. Two feet. He's being pushed up by the water toward...\n\n               FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE\n\n               On the ceiling, caged in a wire cover.\n\n               TOM\n\n               Is terrified, about to die. The water rises up past his face.\n\n               TOM'S HANDS\n\n               Pull his Maglite flashlight from his belt. He takes off the \n               lens and the battery cap, then shakes the batteries out.\n\n               TOM\n\n               Sticks the flashlight tube up through the wire grate over \n               the light fixture.\n\n               He blows out the water -- like clearing a snorkel -- then \n               breathes. Reprieve for a few moments and then...\n\n               THE WATER\n\n               Reaches the top of the flashlight tube and starts to trickle \n               in when...\n\n               THE FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE\n\n               Goes dark. In the darkness, there's the sound of tubes \n               breaking and metal being wrenched.\n\n               TOM\n\n               Looks up, astonished, to see...\n\n               THE FLUORESCENT FIXTURE\n\n               Being lifted up and away from above. Streetlight comes in, \n               silhouetting...\n\n               A FIGURE\n\n               Standing on the roof. The figure leans down and starts tugging \n               at the wire cage over the inside of the fixture. In the light, \n               Tom sees that it's...\n\n               KAREN\n\n               And she's pulling as hard as she can, but the wire cage isn't \n               budging. She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, unfolds a small \n               knife and starts taking out the screws holding the cage in \n               place. She gets two screws out.\n\n               TOM\n\n               Pulls on the cage and it swings down. He climbs up it.\n\n               EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION ROOF\n\n               Tom surfaces in a hole in the roof. There's a vent duct laying \n               on the roof -- Karen must've kicked that over to get to the \n               light fixture. Karen helps Tom up. She sits and he lays down \n               on the roof, catching his breath.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         Thank you.\n\n                                     KAREN\n                         I owed you -- for hitting you and \n                         all. But we're even now, okay?\n\n                                     TOM\n                         Even.\n                              (beat, looks around)\n                         What happened?\n\n                                     KAREN\n                         I don't know.\n\n               They get up.\n\n                                     KAREN\n                         Maybe another levee broke upriver. \n                         They've been --\n\n               Just then...\n\n               A PROPANE TANK\n\n               Explodes. The fireball rips across the dark sky, illuminating \n               everything, showing...\n\n               JIM AND HIS MEN\n\n               Fifty feet away -- Jim, Mr. Mehlor and Ray in the ski-boat \n               and Kenny on the jet-ski -- guns aimed at Tom and Karen.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         Oh, God.\n\n               DARKNESS\n\n               As the lightning passes, and in the darkness, the thunder \n               rolls.\n\n               JIM AND HIS MEN\n\n               Switch on their lights and move forward. They pass...\n\n               CARS\n\n               Floating down the street with other debris. The cars have \n               been damaged by the flood -- one is missing a door.\n\n               JIM AND HIS MEN\n\n               When they get closer to the Sheriff's station, what they see -- \n               or don't see -- makes them stop.\n\n               THEIR POV\n\n               Tom and Karen have disappeared. Karen's boat is still moored \n               to the Sheriff's station roof, empty.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         They're in the water! Kenny, cut \n                         your engine!\n\n               Kenny shuts off the engine of the one remaining jet-ski. Jim \n               shuts down the boat engine. They float in silence, scanning \n               the water with their flashlights. There's no sign of Tom and \n               Karen.\n\n               UNDERWATER\n\n               Tom motions Karen to follow him. She's freaked and hesitates. \n               Tom grabs her hand and pulls her.\n\n               THEIR POV\n\n               The ski-boat and jet-ski are right above them, flashlights \n               playing over the water.\n\n               JIM AND HIS MEN\n\n               Reach the roof of the Sheriff's station. Jim looks around.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         Kenny, go that way. We'll go down \n                         here.\n\n               LONG SHOT POV THROUGH CAR WINDSHIELD\n\n               Of Kenny and Jim heading off in different directions.\n\n               TOM AND KAREN\n\n               Rise into view in a car. They gasp for air and keep low.\n\n                                     KAREN\n                         Tell them where the money is.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         I can't.\n\n                                     KAREN\n                         Well, I can.\n\n               She's about to call out. Tom grabs her hard.\n\n                                     TOM\n                         If they know where the money is, \n                         they will kill us.\n\n               Before Karen can say anything, a flashlight beam comes \n               swinging toward them and they have to duck underwater.\n\n               JIM\n\n               Watches as his flashlight beam washes over the car. Nothing \n               there. He guns his engine and heads off down the street.\n\n               THE CAR\n\n               Floats off around a corner.\n\n               IN THE CAR\n\n               Tom and Karen surface, catch their breath. Quiet for a few \n               moments as they both look around to see that Jim and his men \n               are gone.\n\n                                     KAREN\n                         So what do we do?\n\n                                     TOM\n                         I guess just drive around until we \n                         run out of gas.\n\n                                     KAREN\n                              (pissed)\n                         Look, I've spent the last eight months \n                         of my life restoring that church, \n                         and I just left it to come save your \n                         ass, so spare me, okay?\n\n                                     TOM\n                              (beat)\n                         When we get down here a little further \n                         we'll find a place for you to hide.\n                              (off her look)\n                         I'm gonna get back to the truck and \n                         wait for the National Guard.\n                              (checks watch)\n                         They should be there pretty soon.\n\n               Karen nods.

The heater just kicked \n                         in.\n\n               Tom looks at her, gives a little grin.

HENRY AND DOREEN'S ATTIC\n\n               Henry and Doreen have brought everything into their attic -- \n               a TV, some silver and china, bowling trophies. A Coleman \n               lantern lights the room.\n\n                                     DOREEN\n                              (sarcastic)\n                         Well, isn't that just wonderful!

HENRY'S HOUSE\n\n               Henry stands on the roof of the back porch, steadying a small \n               rowboat as Tom gets in.

Tom rows off.\n\n               LONG SHOT OF TOM\n\n               We see him in silhouette, crossing the gap between two houses.\n\n               JIM AND HIS MEN\n\n               Are watching, from the shadows on the dark side of the street.\n\n                                     RAY\n                         Why don't we just get him?\n\n                                     JIM\n                         If our resourceful young friend hears \n                         us coming, he'll electrocute us or \n                         sink us or one of you'll shoot him. \n                         Besides...\n                              (glances at watch)\n                         ...I know where he's going. What I'd \n                         like to know is where he came from.\n\n               EXT. CHURCH\n\n               The Sheriff sits in his boat, moored to the wall of sandbags \n               around the church. Wayne's boat is tied up next to it. The \n               floodwater is trickling over the top of the wall. The gas-\n               powered pumps inside the wall are keeping the waters at bay.\n\n               WAYNE AND PHIL\n\n               Come out of the front doors of the church.\n\n                                     WAYNE\n                         They're not here.\n\n               EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - WELCOME SIGN\n\n               Tom rows up to the truck and \"Welcome\" sign. His flashlight \n               shows just the top of the truck and sign. Tom looks at his \n               watch, ties the rowboat to the sign, jumps into the water.\n\n               A few moments pass, then Tom surfaces, holding a shotgun. \n               Then he senses something behind him and turns to see...\n\n               A COW\n\n               Floating in the water, tongue out, eyes glassy.\n\n               TOM\n\n               Kicks away, horrified. And then he hears an engine. He looks.\n\n               TOM'S POV\n\n               Jim's ski-boat is coming over the water. The engine cuts out \n               and the ski-boat drifts, a hundred feet from Tom.\n\n                                     JIM\n                              (yelling)\n                         Son, before you go underwater and do \n                         something tricky, there's something \n                         I'd like you to see!\n\n               A flashlight comes on, the beam swivels, illuminating...\n\n               HENRY AND DOREEN\n\n               Standing in the ski-boat, blinking in the light.\n\n               TOM\n\n               Slumps.\n\n                                     JIM\n                         Now, I know it's your job to protect \n                         that money, and maybe you'd even be \n                         foolish enough to give your life for \n                         it.

Then he \n               pushes his pants down to his ankles. His shirttail is long \n               enough so that we don't have to see his wretched little \n               pecker. He climbs on top of Karen in the water, brings his \n               face close to hers.\n\n                                     WAYNE\n                         It was cold and rainy that birthday \n                         night, and all I wanted was to get \n                         someplace warm and dry. As it turned \n                         out, what I really wanted was \n                         something warm and wet. Wayne grins \n                         and closes for a kiss and...\n\n               KAREN'S HAND\n\n               Moves fast with the knife and...\n\n               WAYNE'S EYES\n\n               Pop open wide.\n\n               WAYNE\n\n               His head jerks back. He tries to shout, but all that comes \n               out is an awful gurgle. He tries to push off Karen, but...\n\n               KAREN\n\n               Wraps her legs around him, holds him close, pinning him.\n\n               WAYNE\n\n               Finally breaks free. He tries to stop the bleeding with a \n               hand, but the blood spurts through his fingers. He reaches \n               for his gun in his holster on the banister, but just as he \n               grabs it...\n\n               KAREN\n\n               Lashes out of the water with her legs, kicking Wayne in the \n               groin, pushing him back.\n\n               WAYNE\n\n               Tries to get his balance, but his feet can't move -- his \n               pants are around his ankles. He falls back into the water, \n               firing his pistol.\n\n               BULLETS\n\n               Blow chunks out of the wall next to Karen, hit the ceiling \n               and...\n\n               WAYNE\n\n               Is floating on his back, trying to lift the pistol, but his \n               strength is fading fast. He gets off one last shot and...\n\n               THE CANDLE\n\n               Nearest Karen is blown to pieces.\n\n               WAYNE\n\n               The gun drops into the water. No more shots. No more life. \n               He floats, pants around his ankles, covered in blood, dead.\n\n                                     KAREN\n                         Happy Birthday, Wayne.\n\n               EXT.

She reaches out with one foot \n               and hooks Wayne's holster off the banister. She flips it \n               through the air and catches it with her hands. She opens \n               little leather pockets -- mace, more bullets. No keys. Karen \n               starts to panic.\n\n                                     KAREN\n                         There have to be keys.

She can't reach.\n\n               WAYNE\n\n               Is slowly drifting out the open door. Beyond the door, in \n               the light of the streetlamp, the water is riffling, moving, \n               and Wayne is heading toward it.\n\n               KAREN\n\n               Slides down further on the stairs, into the water, then stops.\n\n               CLOSE ON HANDCUFFS AND RAILING\n\n               There are metal supports going from the railing to the wall, \n               every three feet. Karen is prevented from going any further \n               down the stairs by one of these supports.\n\n               KAREN\n\n               Reaches out with a foot, straining, stretching her body, \n               almost dislocating her shoulder and...\n\n               HER FOOT\n\n               Just barely touches one of Wayne's feet, but then Wayne's \n               foot slips away and...\n\n               KAREN\n\n               Can only watch as...\n\n               WAYNE\n\n               Drifts out the door and is pulled away by the current.\n\n               EXT.

He runs for the stairs.\n\n               BLAZING TIMBERS\n\n               Start to fall from the burning roof frame, hitting the water \n               with loud sizzling hisses.\n\n               THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK\n\n               Turn to shoot at tom through the dropping flaming debris.\n\n               TOM\n\n               Disappears up the stairs, the bullets just missing him.\n\n               UNDERWATER\n\n               Jim runs out of bullets. He's long since run out of air. He \n               drops his guns and swims under the pews.\n\n               HANK\n\n               Looks up, realizing that Tom will be able to shoot down on \n               him. He reverses his boat fast under the balcony as...\n\n               TOM\n\n               Shoots down from the balcony, blowing a chunk out of the \n               prow of Hank's boat.\n\n               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE\n\n               The water is up to Karen's chin.

She's on the last one. \n               The blade slips, misses, gets a quarter turn, another quarter \n               turn...\n\n               KAREN\n\n               Spits out the water that spills into her mouth.\n\n               UNDERWATER\n\n               Another quarter-turn and the screw is loose enough to turn \n               by hand.\n\n               KAREN\n\n               Holds her breath with the water touching her nose. She gets \n               the screw loose, pulls up on the railing and pulls the \n               handcuff through the gap between the support and the railing.\n\n               INT.

It doesn't \n               budge. She starts chipping at the plaster with the knife.\n\n                                     KAREN\n                         God, I am really beginning to hate \n                         fine craftsmanship.\n\n               THE WATER\n\n               It's up to her chest.\n\n               INT.

KAREN'S HOUSE\n\n               Tom swims down into the living room. His light shows a couch, \n               chairs, TV set.

THE CHURCH\n\n               The damaged ski-boat that Jim and Tom took to the church has \n               slipped off the sandbag wall and is drifting. A peaceful \n               scene. But then, from the distance, comes a rushing roar.\n\n               INT. CHURCH\n\n               Phil hears the roar. He looks around, lost.\n\n               EXT.

Phil sees something in \n               the water and reaches for it, frantically. He gets it. It's...\n\n               A BIBLE\n\n               And he clutches it to his chest as...\n\n               THE FLOOD\n\n               Hits the church.\n\n               INT.

He opens it.\n\n               INSIDE THE CUPBOARD\n\n               Hanging on a hook on the back wall is a saw. Tom grabs it.\n\n               EXT. MAIN STREET\n\n               Hank unwraps himself from around the lamp post. He looks \n               back.\n\n               HIS POV\n\n               Streetlights in the distance, winking out one by one, marking \n               the advance of the wall of water.\n\n                                     HANK\n                         Oh my God.\n\n               Hank looks around for safety.

THE ADVANCING FLOOD\n\n               Roars through the town, pushing a rolling wave of debris, \n               obliterating anything in its path.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY\n\n               Hank swims into the alley. Hank looks for something to climb \n               up on, to hold onto. There's...\n\n               FIRE ESCAPE LADDER\n\n               At the end of the alley.\n\n               HANK\n\n               Swims for it. He hears the rushing roar of the advancing \n               flood. He expects the flood to blow by the end of the alley. \n               Wrong.\n\n               WALL OF WATER\n\n               Comes into the alley, banking high on the far wall before \n               coming down and barreling toward Hank. And what makes it \n               worse for Hank is that there's...\n\n               A CAR\n\n               At the front of the wave, being pushed by the water.\n\n               HANK\n\n               Dives clear just as...\n\n               THE CAR\n\n               Smashes into the wall, right where Hank had just been.\n\n               HANK\n\n               Relief in his eyes. He gets to the fire escape and is climbing \n               to safety when...\n\n               PROPANE TANK\n\n               Comes into the alley, rolling in the flood, spraying propane \n               from a torn hose. It explodes.\n\n               HANK\n\n               Barely has time to scream.\n\n               INT. KAREN'S KITCHEN - BREAK OF DAWN\n\n               Tom is threading his belt through the handle of the saw to \n               secure it.

KAREN'S HOUSE\n\n               The house has been hit by the flood. It's being pulled by \n               the massive current, stretching overhead phone and power \n               lines.\n\n               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE\n\n               Karen hears the groaning, ripping as the house tears free \n               from water and sewer lines. She's looking down for Tom when \n               there's a snap and the light above her goes out.\n\n               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE\n\n               The house is carried on the current, turning in the water.\n\n               IN THE KITCHEN\n\n               Tom watches, astounded, as the room starts to turn around \n               him.

He swims over to another window and slides it up.\n\n               KAREN\n\n               Keeps looking down for Tom.\n\n               EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE\n\n               The house is impaled on a tree, the current sluicing around \n               it.\n\n               TOM\n\n               Surfaces near the side of the house, gasping. The current \n               starts ripping him past the house. He swims as hard as he \n               can back to the house, reaches out and grabs onto a gutter.\n\n               INT. KAREN'S HOUSE\n\n               Karen doesn't have much time left. The water is washing over \n               her mouth and nose. And just as she's about to go under...\n\n               TOM\n\n               Swims in with the saw. He starts sawing on the handrail. \n               Everything's going fine. And then...\n\n               THE SAWBLADE\n\n               Snaps.\n\n               TOM AND KAREN\n\n               Look at each other. Oh no. Karen's going under.\n\n               TOM\n\n               Sees something. He dives into the water.\n\n               KAREN\n\n               Can only watch and wait. What's he doing? Oh, Jesus. And \n               then...\n\n               TOM\n\n               Surfaces, holding Wayne's pistol. He puts the mouth of the \n               barrel to the handcuff chain, shields Karen's face, looks \n               away and pulls the trigger.\n\n               EXT. A TREE IN WATER\n\n               The water swirls through the branches of a half-submerged \n               tree.\n\n               HENRY AND DOREEN\n\n               Are in the tree. Henry is either unconscious or dead. Doreen \n               cradles him.\n\n                                     DOREEN\n                         Come on, Henry.

KAREN'S HOUSE\n\n               Tom and Karen swim out of a second floor window, grab the \n               rain gutter. Tom pulls himself onto the roof then grabs Karen \n               and helps her up. They crawl until they're clear of the edge. \n               Only the sloped roof of the house is visible in the swirling \n               water. They are just catching their breath when they are hit \n               by...\n\n               BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT\n\n               And they look to see...\n\n               THE SHERIFF\n\n               In his boat, shining a searchlight on them with one hand, a \n               gun in the other. He starts shooting.\n\n               TOM AND KAREN\n\n               Tom pushes Karen toward the peak of the roof as the bullets \n               plug in around them. Tom pushes Karen over the top then turns \n               and dives off the roof and into the water.\n\n               KAREN\n\n               Hears an engine behind her and turns.\n\n               A BOAT\n\n               Racing toward the house.

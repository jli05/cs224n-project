NICK'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 1\r\n                         \r\n           Looking incredibly weary, NICK WATERS, 30's, enters his\r\n           apartment in his business suit. He stumbles into --\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          2 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 2\r\n                         \r\n           He drops his briefcase, strips off his jacket, loosens\r\n           his tie and collapses onto the bed like a dead man. PAN\r\n           OVER TO the alarm clock which reads \"1:23 AM.\"\r\n                         \r\n           MATCH CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          3 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 3\r\n                         \r\n           The alarm clock now reads \"4:59 AM.\" It switches to\r\n           \"5:00\" and a BLARING BUZZER goes off. Nick sits up in\r\n           bed, shuts off the buzzer and painfully forces himself\r\n           out of bed. He hurries out of the bedroom, passing the\r\n           saddest, deadest houseplant in history.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          4 INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 4\r\n                         \r\n           Nick opens his fridge to reveal a wasteland of moldy\r\n           leftover containers and crusty condiments. The orange\r\n           juice container he grabs is empty.\r\n                         \r\n                          NICK\r\n           Damn.\r\n                         \r\n           He opens the freezer. It contains nothing but multiple\r\n           boxes of \"Jimmy Dean's Breakfast Bowl -- with Bacon!\" He\r\n           pops one in the microwave, then glances over at a framed\r\n           photo of a slightly younger Nick kissing a smiling OLD\r\n           WOMAN on the cheek. The frame reads: \"I Y Grandma!\"\r\n           Nick sighs sadly.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          5 INT. NICK'S BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER 5\r\n                         \r\n           Nick sits on the toilet eating his breakfast bowl with a\r\n           fork. He takes some toilet paper from the roll and wipes\r\n           his mouth with it.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          6 INT.

NICK'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 7\r\n                         \r\n           Nick hastily grabs work clothes from his messy drawers\r\n           and closet. Clearly, no laundry has been done in a\r\n           while.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          8 INT.

NICK'S CAR - SHORT TIME LATER 9\r\n                         \r\n           As he drives to work, he dials a number and transfers it\r\n           to speakerphone.\r\n                         \r\n           JENNA (V.O.)\r\n                          (GROGGY)\r\n           Hello?\r\n                         \r\n                          NICK\r\n                          (CHEERY)\r\n           Hey, Jenna, it's Nick.\r\n                         \r\n           JENNA (V.O.)\r\n           It's five-thirty in the morning,\r\n           Nick.\r\n                         \r\n                          NICK\r\n           Yeah, sorry.

And even if I weren't,\r\n           the last thing I need is some\r\n           career-obsessed guy complaining\r\n           about work all the time. See you\r\n           around, Nick.\r\n                         \r\n           She hangs up.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          10 EXT.

It\r\n           reads \"6:02.\" He looks up at a security camera with a\r\n           flashing red light, indicating he is on tape.\r\n                         \r\n                          NICK\r\n           Fuck!\r\n                         \r\n                          DISSOLVE TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          12 INT. NICK'S CUBICLE - LATER 12\r\n                         \r\n           Nick sits at his desk inputting information from a large\r\n           PILE of documents into a spreadsheet on his computer.\r\n           The clock on his computer turns to \"8:00 AM.\"\r\n                         \r\n           HARKEN (O.S.)\r\n           Nick.\r\n                         \r\n           Nick jumps, startled. He turns to see his boss, DAVE\r\n           HARKEN, 40's, standing behind him.\r\n                         \r\n                          NICK\r\n           Yes?\r\n                         \r\n                          HARKEN\r\n           See you in my office?\r\n           4.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          13 INT.

Nick stands\r\n           across from him.\r\n                         \r\n                          HARKEN\r\n           Here's my concern, Nick. You're a\r\n           punctual guy. You understand the\r\n           importance of getting to work on\r\n           time. So that leaves me to wonder\r\n           if there isn't something wrong\r\n           with the internal clock in our\r\n           security system. What do you\r\n           think?\r\n                         \r\n                          NICK\r\n           I don't know, Mr. Harken.

So\r\n           either you're a liar -- which I\r\n           know you're not -- or our system\r\n           is off by a full minute. And if\r\n           that's the case, I have no choice\r\n           but to dismiss Thomas, our\r\n           longtime security coordinator.\r\n                         \r\n                          NICK\r\n           Okay, I might have been two\r\n           minutes late.\r\n                         \r\n           There's an uncomfortable beat.

Nick works at a financial firm for the sadistic David Harken (Spacey), who implies the possibility of a promotion for Nick for months, only to award it to himself. Dale is a dental assistant being sexually harassed by his boss, Dr. Julia Harris (Aniston); she threatens to tell his fiancee Stacy (Lindsay Sloane) that he had sex with her unless he actually has sex with her. Nick and Dale's accountant friend Kurt Buckman (Sudeikis) enjoys working for Jack Pellitt (Donald Sutherland) at a chemical company, but after Jack unexpectedly dies of a heart attack, the company is taken over by Jack's cocaine-addicted son Bobby (Farrell), whose apathy and incompetence threaten the future of the company.\nAt night, over drinks, Kurt jokingly suggests that their lives would be happier if their bosses were no longer around. Initially hesitant, they eventually agree to kill their employers. In search of a hitman, the trio meet Dean \"Motherfucker\" Jones (Foxx), an ex-con who agrees to be their \"murder consultant\". Jones suggests that Dale, Kurt and Nick kill each other's bosses to hide their motive while making the deaths look like accidents.\nThe three reconnoiter Bobby's house, and Kurt steals Bobby's phone. They next go to Harken's house, where Kurt and Nick go inside while Dale waits in the car. Harken returns home and confronts Dale for littering, but then has an allergy attack from the peanut butter on the litter. Dale saves Harken by stabbing him with an EpiPen. Nick and Kurt think Dale is stabbing Harken to death and flee, with Kurt accidentally dropping Bobby's phone in Harken's bedroom. The next night, Kurt watches Julia's home, but she seduces and has sex with him. Nick and Dale reluctantly wait outside Bobby's and Harken's houses, respectively, to commit the murders, despite neither of them wanting to. Harken discovers Bobby's cellphone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, suspecting his wife Rhonda (Julie Bowen) is having an affair. He drives over and kills Bobby, with Nick as a secret witness.\nNick flees at high speed, setting off a traffic camera. The trio meet to discuss their reservations about continuing with their plan. They are arrested by the police, who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby's murder. Lacking evidence, the police are forced to let the trio go free. The trio consult with Jones again, but learn that he never actually killed anyone, having been imprisoned for bootlegging the film Snow Falling on Cedars. Jones suggests that they get Harken to confess and secretly tape it. The three accidentally crash Harken's surprise birthday party, where Nick and Dale get Harken to confess to the murder before realizing that Kurt, who has the audio recorder, is elsewhere having sex with Rhonda. Harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him. They flee by car, but Harken gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle. Believing they have committed a crime, the car's navigation-system operator remotely disables Kurt's car, allowing Harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint. Harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to frame them for murdering Bobby and attempting to kill him to get rid of the witness.\nThe police arrest Nick, Dale and Kurt, but the navigation-system operator reveals that the entire conversation was recorded.

He told me there\n                      is a signal. It is \"Cut the tall trees.\"                       \n                      When they hear the signal, the militia                         \n                      are to go to war.\n          \n                                  FEDENS\n                      Please, let us take Tatiana with us.

Barely a car on the road.\n          Shadows dart past faint house lights. The windscreen clouds. Paul\n          switches on his wipers. A Toyota truck, loaded with Militia, appears\n          from the mist, speeds past. Paul switches the preset buttons on the\n          radio as he drives. He can only find fevered drum-based MUSIC.\n          \n          \n          \n                                                                             31.\n          \n          \n          EXT. PAUL'S STREET. NIGHT\n          \n          Paul turns onto his street. The houses are dark: windows shuttered;\n          gates closed; not a soul about. Paul stops before his gate. HONKS\n          twice. The gate doesn't open. He hops out and opens it with a key.\n          Gives it a push and pauses as he heads back to the car. He hears the\n          far off sound of gunfire. Distant explosions light the night sky.\n          \n          \n          EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT\n          \n          Paul drives in. His compound is curiously dark.     His headlights sweep\n          across his pitch-black house.\n          \n                                                                         UT TO:\n          \n          The gates swing shut. We PULL BACK as Paul turns and faces his house.\n          Paul whistles for the dog, nothing. He goes back to the car, gets a\n          flashlight, heads for the front door.\n          \n          \n          INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT\n          \n          The door slowly opens. Paul steps in quietly, tries the light switch,\n          nothing. He listens. The only sounds are distant explosions and\n          gunfire. The beam of his flashlight cuts the blackness, illuminating:\n          magazines arranged on a coffee table; an empty chair; children's toys\n          in a basket.\n          \n          \n          INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT\n          \n          Paul continues his search. Scans the counter. There's food on the\n          stove. The table is set. He hears a GROWL, quickly cut short, from one\n          of the bedrooms.\n          \n          \n          INT. PAUL'S HALL. NIGHT\n          \n          Paul shines the light into a room. Looks for a second, then closes the\n          door, and walks to the next. He stops and listens with his ear to the\n          door. Nothing. He pushes it in.\n          \n          \n          INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT\n          \n          Paul's light sweeps across the room and illuminates:\n          \n          Eyes - terrified eyes, a room full of faces, staring back.\n          \n          THEIR POV: A dark figure behind a blinding light.\n          \n          The dog breaks free, runs to Paul.\n          \n          \n          \n          \n                                                                           32.\n          \n                                  PAUL\n                      Pealiss!\n          \n          From among the faces, Tatiana's voice heavy with relief.\n          \n                                  TATIANA\n                      Paul!\n          \n          Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded\n          into this small room.

Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle), the manager of the Sabena owned H\u00f4tel des Mille Collines, is Hutu, but his wife Tatiana (Okonedo), is Tutsi. His marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, most prominently Georges Rutaganda (Kae-Kazim), a friendly goods supplier to the hotel who is also the local leader of Interahamwe, a brutal Hutu militia.\nAs the political situation in the country worsens following the assassination of the president, Paul and his family observe neighbors being killed in ethnic violence, initiating the early stages of a genocide. Paul curries favor with people of influence, bribing them with money and alcohol, seeking to maintain sufficient influence to keep his family safe. When civil war erupts and a Rwandan Army officer threatens Paul and his neighbors, Paul barely negotiates their safety, and brings them to the hotel. More evacuees arrive at the hotel from the overburdened UN refugee camp, the Red Cross, and various orphanages. Paul must divert the Hutu soldiers, care for the refugees, be a source of strength to his family, and maintain the appearance of a functioning hotel as the situation becomes more violent.\nThe UN Peacekeeping forces, led by Canadian Colonel Oliver (Nolte), are unable to take assertive action against the Interahamwe since they are forbidden to intervene in the genocide. The foreign nationals are evacuated, but the Rwandans are left behind. When the UN forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including Paul's family, they are ambushed and must turn back. In a last-ditch effort to save the refugees, Paul pleads with the Rwandan Army General, Augustin Bizimungu (Mokoena) for assistance. However, when Paul's bribes no longer work, he blackmails the General with threats of being tried as a war criminal. Soon after, the family and the hotel refugees are finally able to leave the besieged hotel in a UN convoy. They travel through retreating masses of refugees and militia to reach safety behind Tutsi rebel lines.\nThe film's epilogue displays a series of graphics stating that Rusesabagina saved 1,268 Rwandan refugees at the H\u00f4tel des Mille Collines, and now lives in Belgium with his family. It notes that Rutaganda and General Bizimungu were tried and convicted by the UN for war crimes in 2002, while also conveying that the genocide ended in July 1994 leaving almost a million people dead."}

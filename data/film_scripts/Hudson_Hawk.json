THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR\n     THIS SOFT COPY.\n\n\n\n\n     FADE IN:\n\n     EXT. VINCI COUNTRYSIDE - RENAISSANCE - DAY\n\n     Beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small\n     Renaissance Fair with florid awnings, demented ACROBATS\n     and roaring puppets is unfolding.\n\n     RUSTIC FARMERS and their families rumble with enjoyment\n     at the Sabbath afternoon entertainment.\n\n     Encircled by children, A JUGGLER WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY\n     ETCHED FACE elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch\n     on his mule.  As he begins to juggle, a LOUD EXPLOSION\n     is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls\n     and collapse in a heap.\n\n     Everyone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up.\n\n                             UNFORGETTABLE JUGGLER\n               Leonardo, che pazzo.\n\n     The juggler shakes his fist up to a swish pan that swings\n     up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle...\n\n     INT. ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE\n\n     where the charismatic LEONARDO DA VINCI laughs down at\n     him.  Da Vinci wears a pair of very early, very cool sun-\n     glasses with his trademark beard.\n\n     He turns and loses his smile, something extraordinary\n     reflecting off his glasses.  Removing his shades, Da\n     Vinci moves to the Something, a gloriously incredible\n     machine.  The opening CREDITS REVEAL its dazzling idio-\n     syncrasies.\n\n     TWO COUGHING APPRENTICES haplessly try to disperse smoke\n     from the still billowing, mysteriously spectacular\n     Machine.  Mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams\n     of light which cut through the smoke like a Renaissance\n     laser show.\n\n                             DA VINCI\n                       (silencing authority)\n               Basta vapore.\n\n     The apprentice throws a lever.  A shunt near the furnace\n     turns.  Steam escapes upwards.  The machine immediately\n     slows down.  Da Vinci oh-so-gently coughs and moves for-\n     ward with tongs.\n\n     A LITTLE TROUGH - IN THE MACHINE'S INNARDS\n\n     comes to a trembling, mystical halt.  Right behind this\n     trough is a CONPLEX POLYHEDRON CRYSTAL as intricately\n     modulated as any Rubik stocking stuffer, but much more\n     dazzling in beauty.  It gleams like a jewel in the yellow\n     glow which pours from a PLEASANTLY GRINNING DEMONHEAD into\n     a trough--a glow of heat--and something more than heat.\n\n     The tongs enter the frame.\n\n     Da Vinci brings the object closer to his face.  A murmur\n     goes up from the awestruck apprentices as the Master\n     peers at the smoking yellow bar.\n\n                             APPRENTICE TWO\n               Maestro, che meraviglia!\n\n                             APPRENTICE THREE\n               Lei e' proprio fantastico!\n\n     Da Vinci's pride goes dead as the implications hit.\n\n                             DA VINCI\n               Lasciatemi, solo.  Solo!\n\n     The apprentices scurry out.  Mind reeling, Da Vinci turns\n     his back to the viewer, before a wall of frescoes.\n\n                             DA VINCI\n               L'ho fatto.\n\n     Spinning back around, using the edge of his cloak, Da\n     Vinci pulls out the large gleaming crystal with a pop.\n\n     INT. DA VINCI'S WORKSHOP\n\n     With an accompanying blast of smoke, Da Vinci bursts\n     through some double doors into his workshop, sadly\n     reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged\n     bar in the other.\n\n     His workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of\n     laboratory and studio; On a table in the foreground is\n     a fresh clay equestrian statue; a large VOLUME of\n     sketches, the inkwell nearby; a MODEL of what looks like\n     a HELICOPTER; Da Vinci flings the tonged bar on the table\n     among these goodies.\n\n     Pocketing the crystal, Da Vinci meanders through his work-\n     shop casually tinkering with various experiments.  He\n     snaps his fingers at a BATHING SUITED APPRENTICE, wearing\n     a diving helmet prototype.  The Apprentice jumps into a\n     pool of water.\n\n     Leonardo next stops at an easel displaying a finished-\n     except-for-the-mouth portrait of Mona Lisa, who happens\n     to be seated in a stool before the easel.  She broadly\n     smiles, revealing the worst dental work of her epoch.\n     Da Vinci shakes his head and moves out onto a\n\n     EXT. CASTLE TERRACE\n\n     A FLYING APPRENTICE sails past Leonardo in a bat winged\n     glider, enthusiastically shouting.  Da Vinci grins back\n     until he touches his pocket.  He pulls out the crystal\n     and, after a beat, angrily twists it apart into two\n     separate, geometric pieces revealing a small intricate\n     mirror.  He quickly folds the surprisingly shapable\n     geometric pieces.\n\n     Calming down, Da Vinci looks from the three components of\n     the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the\n     table in his workshop.  He ponders then looks back out to\n     the Vinci vista.\n\n     The bat winged glider DISSOLVES into:\n\n     A HAWK\n\n     who is revealed to be flying over Sing Sing prison.\n\n     INT. A SING SING PRISON CELL\n\n     The shadow of the hawk passes through a cell window, over\n     the face of EDDIE HUDSON HAWKINS causing him to break out\n     of an eye-closed trance.\n\n     Before the viewer can get a good look at him, Hudson\n     Hawk turns to an oddball version of the \"Mona Lisa\" that\n     has his face and tears it off the cell back-wall.\n\n     INT. PRISON BLOCK WALKWAY\n\n     TWO PRISON GUARDS, One WISE and BLACK, the other YOUNG\n     and GREEN march down a cell block.  The Former is smoking\n     a pipe which the Young Guard lights with a lighter.\n\n                             WISE GUARD\n               We're losing our biggest celebrity\n               today.\n\n                             YOUNG GUARD\n               You're kidding, Petey the Paint\n               Thinner Killer is getting paroled?\n\n                             WISE GUARD\n               Not that slime, you Fizzhead.\n               Hudson Hawk.  The last of the\n               great cat burglars.\n\n     INT. PRISON CELL WALL\n\n     A hand tears down a picture of a happy Hudson Hawk and\n     a LITTLE MONKEY, identically dressed in black cat\n     burglar gear.\n\n     THE BLOCK\n\n     The Wise Guard and the Young Guard rumble forward.\n\n                             WISE GUARD\n               As a thief, Hawk was a poem.\n               Iambic fucking pentameter.  You\n               know, Crime used to have a little\n               class.  A hundred reporters were\n               here when he came in, now they're\n               probably out covering some tired\n               crack gang war...\n\n     The Guards approach Hawk's cell.  Hawk, with his back\n     turned, hefts on a nifty blazer.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Remind me to fire my publicist.\n\n     The Wise Guard chuckles as the Young Guard fumbles with\n     his key-ring.\n\n                             YOUNG GUARD\n               Darn, these are for L-block...\n\n     Hawk's hand reaches through the bars and grabs a pipe\n     cleaner from the Wise Guard's pocket.  Then the lighter\n     from the Young Guard's pocket--BURNS OFF the fabric fuzz\n     with the lighter beside it--bends the now blackened\n     wire--and with a quick turn of the wrist uses it to\n     UNLOCK the door.\n\n                             YOUNG GUARD\n               - go back down to security and-\n\n     He stops, dumbfounded, as the door clunks open.  The\n     Guards double-take as Hawk, finally in full view, struts\n     past them, down the hall.  The Guards hustle to catch\n     up.  The wise guard puts his finger in the air and\n     sarcastically pretends to be stung by the heat emanating\n     from Hawk.\n\n                             WISE GUARD\n               Guess this means, Hawk, you'll\n               be able to let yourself back in...\n\n                             HAWK\n               Never happen.  Bet.  Ten bucks.\n\n     Hawk and the Wise Guard hit fists, half-smiling.  Hawk\n     unfolds the painting.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Oh, give this back to Petey in A\n               block.  Tell him it was a sweet\n               gift, but I think he got some\n               wrong ideas about our friendship.\n\n                             YOUNG GUARD\n               The Paint Thinner Killer did\n               this?  I think you picked a good\n               day to get out...\n\n     The trio comes to the final checkpoint.  Hawk takes a\n     deep breath.\n\n                             WISE GUARD\n               Hope I lose the bet.  Have that\n               cappuccino on me.\n\n                             HAWK\n                       (flipping him the\n                        pipe cleaner)\n               You got it.  A double.\n\n     EXT. OUTSIDE THE PRISON--DAY\n\n     Hawk strides to the Massive Sliding Concrete Door/Wall\n     between him and freedom.  As music crescendos and\n     Hawk glows his first smile, the door opens to reveal two\n     Mafioso brothers, CESAR and ANTONY MARIO, the latter\n     sitting upon the hood of a tinted window Lincoln\n     Continental.  Cesar is of cool, hair-slicked-back\n     attitude, his scumbag brother is not.\n\n                             ANTONY\n               Welcome back, buddy ol' pal.\n               We've got a proposition...\n\n                              HAWK\n               Answer's no, not even if you\n               bathe.  Cesar Mario, Antony Mario,\n               how's the \"Family?\"  Kill any\n               monkeys lately?\n\n                              CESAR\n               How many times do I have to say\n               it?  I didn't put the hit on\n               Little Eddie... Never had anything\n               against that kooky chimp.  I\n               actually found him, \"endearing.\"\n\n                             HAWK\n               Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing\n               shots to the back of the head.\n               That's your mark, man.  What did\n               Little Eddie ever do to...\n\n     Smouldering, Hawk struts off.  Cesar takes a black\n     canvas bag from a SCARFACED DRIVER and hustles up to\n     Hawk.  The Lincoln rumbles behind them, Antony riding\n     on the hood.\n\n                             CESAR\n               You're hitting Rutherford's\n               Auction House.  Easy as my\n               brother's wife.  Directions are\n               in the bag.  Just open the seventh\n               floor safe and take out the\n               thingie...\n\n                             HAWK\n               Or you cut off my thingie.\n               Directions even your brother\n               would understand.\n         \n                             ANTONY\n                       (defensively)\n               Yeah, directions even I could\n               understand.\n\n     The car squeals to a stop.  Antony bounds off.  Cesar\n     shove-throws the canvas bag into Hawk's unwilling\n     hands.\n\n                             CESAR\n               Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got\n               set up, did some time, nothing to\n               be ashamed of.  Don't give me a\n               sonata about you always just\n               really wanted to settle down,\n               open a hardware Store and sell\n               spatulas...\n\n                             HAWK\n               If the Mario brothers weren't\n               Jersey's third largest family,\n               I'd say kiss my ass.  But\n               considering your status, I'll\n               say slurp my butt.\n\n     Hawk fiercely push-shoves the canvas bag back into\n     Cesar's hands.\n\n                             CESAR\n               What's your favorite sport, Hawk?\n\n                             HAWK\n               Baseball, why?\n\n     Antony opens the back door of the Lincoln and says\n     \"Baseball.\"  He is handed a baseball bat.  Hawk backs\n     up as Antony moves threateningly toward him.\n\n                             HAWK\n               I meant, ping pong.  Listen, I'd\n               rather go back in than whore for\n               you...\n                       (stopping)\n               Oh, I need to borrow ten dollars.\n\n     A PRISON GUARD from above turns as not to be a witness.\n     Hawk feebly calls up to him.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Help?  Police?\n\n     Antony swings at Hawk, who pretends not to notice until\n     the last second.  Hawk ducks and slam-kicks his calf.\n     Antony crumples, using the bat as a crutch.  Hawk boots\n     up the bat for a two-handed catch then savagely pivots\n     it across Antony's face, knocking him into the backseat\n     of the car.\n\n                             CESAR\n                       (unfazed)\n               You need some time to think.\n               That's cool, but next time, I'm\n               not going to say \"Please.\"\n\n     Cesar floats into the backseat.  The Lincoln takes off.\n     Hawk seethes...\n\n                             HAWK\n               I don't believe this.  I've been\n               out forty seconds...\n\n     A BACKFIRE rings out.  Hawk hits the ground, thinking\n     it is a gunshot.\n\n     HAWK'S ON THE GROUND P.O.V.\n\n     A gasping 1960 Caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too-\n     fancy-to-be-tasteful shoes comes out.  Hawk looks up to\n     see ALEX MESSINA, his older, maybe-maybe-not-wiser best\n     friend.\n\n                             ALEX\n               That's the first thing I did.\n               Smooch the ground and taste the\n               freedom.  Sorry I was late.  Miss\n               anything?\n\n                             HAWK\n                       (getting up)\n               Your timing, and your shoes, are\n               impeccable...  Good to see you,\n               Alex, been having a lousy day.\n\n                             ALEX\n               Lousy day?  The man's getting out\n               of prison and he's having a\n               lousy day.  What, you missing out\n               on the Cell Block Water Ballet\n               pageant?  Believe me, it's\n               overrated.\n\n     Hawk pauses to say something, then just hugs Alex.\n\n                             ALEX\n               Where's the kiss?  No tongue this\n               time, I promise.\n\n     A laughing Hawk gives Alex's stomach a slap before\n     getting in the car....\n\n                             HAWK\n               Looks like you've been expanding\n               your...\n\n                             ALEX\n               Don't say it, Hawkins.

Mario Brothers want\n               me to do a job.\n\n     Alex brakes and cappuccino flies.  Hawk half-heartedly\n     tries to lick up with his fingers.\n\n                             ALEX\n               Those dago-guinea-I can say\n               this shit I'm Italian-wop\n               motherfu--\n\n                             HAWK\n               Ah, had the perfect amount of\n               foam.  Just get me to the bar...\n               It's the one good thing in my\n               life that'll never change....\n\n     EXT. OUTSIDE ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT\n\n     The Guys move through the personably Jersey face of the\n     bar.  The Empire State Building beams in the background.\n     Sinatra cuts off.\n\n     INT. ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT\n\n     It's changed.  Hawk and Alex enter into what has become\n     the ultimate pseudo-art deco-fern littered-nightmare,\n     packed with noisy, INSUFFERABLY SELF-ABSORBED YUPS.\n     A violently erotic and pretentious video plays upon\n     elevated T.V. sets set up all around the place.\n\n     Hawk's mouth gapes as he drifts by a sickening COUPLE\n     toasting wine coolers, and two very YOUNG BROKERS high-\n     fiving each other after missing a dartboard.\n\n                             ALEX\n               I didn't know how to tell you.  A\n               couple brokers stopped in for\n               Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next\n               thing I know Fast Track Digest\n               votes us \"Watering Hole of the\n               Month.\"  Now, I'm shopping for\n               Aqua Salmon wallpaper.\n\n                             HAWK\n               I read about these people in\n               Newsweek.  Where's all the\n               regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the\n               Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's\n               Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain\n               Bob's steering wheel?\n\n                             ALEX\n               Hey, get this irritable guy a\n               cappuccino.  I gotta go be a boss.\n\n     Alex lifts a piece of the bar and moves behind it.\n     Snatching up a menu, Hawk calls out...\n\n                             HAWK\n               This is Pizza?  Reindeer Goat\n               cheese?  I admit, I've been known\n               to go wild and order a Canadian\n               Bacon in my time, but..\n\n     Hawk lights up a cigarette.  A TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER\n     immediately turns to him wearing a \"Yes, I mind if you\n     smoke\" button.\n\n                             TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER\n               Can you read.... smoker?\n\n                             HAWK\n               Can you take a sunrise and\n               sprinkle it with dew?\n\n                              TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER\n                       (Huh?)\n               No.\n\n                              HAWK\n               The Candy Man can, Felix.  You\n               know, I thought this was a country\n               where you could do any stupid\n               thing you wanted; drive to work\n               naked, make love to a V.C.R.\n               Guess I'm wrong.  Maybe that's\n               why I became a serial arsonist.\n\n                             TORTOISE SHELL NON-SMOKER\n               Hey, it's okay, big guy.  Smoke\n               all you want.  Have mine....\n\n     The Non-smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes and\n     flees.  A cappuccino in cup and saucer slides down the\n     bar saloon-style.  A smiling Hawk picks it up, turns away\n     from the bar and closes his eyes, bringing the cup to his\n     lips until a POLICE BADGE swirls into frame and splashes\n     into the cup, splattering coffee over Hawk's blazer.\n\n                             GATES (O.S.)\n               You're under arrest...\n\n     Hawk makes eye contact up to a crude, coarse, and\n     cackling island of a man, OFFICER GATES, amid the sea\n     of oblivious and self-obsessed yuppitude, standing by\n     a table.\n\n                             GATES\n               Have a seat.

Hawk tosses the badge onto the\n     food.  Gates eats around it.\n\n                             GATES\n               Why do you show your parole\n               officer such disrespect?\n               Especially after I got you such\n               a nice job.\n\n                             HAWK\n               What job?\n\n     Gates pulls up the black canvas bag and puts it on the\n     table.\n\n                             GATES\n               The auction house, asshole.  One\n               night's work and you're free like\n               no ex-con's ever been.  No\n               checking in with a shrink, no\n               community service teaching\n               retards how to play air hockey.\n               It's a great deal, I can't lie.\n\n                             HAWK\n               The only thing you can't do is\n               get sex for free.  I know I was\n               in prison for like basically the\n               80's, but, call me daffy, aren't\n               you supposed to stop me from\n               committing crimes.  You know,\n               Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup,\n               Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.\n\n     Gates thunders out of his chair and moves around to sneer\n     down at Hawk.  Behind Gates, on the T.V. screens, are\n     analogous images of DISGUSTING ANIMALS AND MONSTERS.\n\n                             GATES\n               You wouldn't be out if it wasn't\n               for me!  I did dog and pony for\n               you!  You think they would have\n               let you out after what you did,\n               you told the board members they\n               looked like the Three Stooges...\n\n                             HAWK\n               How was I supposed to know they\n               were women?  Besides one of them\n               was bald and kept saying\n               \"Soitinly.\"\n\n     Gates simmers into his seat with a self-control smile.\n\n                             GATES\n               Remember that guy in the cell\n               next to you who hung himself?\n\n                             HAWK\n               Yes.\n\n                             GATES\n               Remember that shoe you lost...\n\n                             HAWK\n               Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.\n\n     Gates pulls up a shoe and puts it on the table.\n\n                             GATES\n               One phone call and your shoe\n               will become a piece of evidence\n               and that suicide'll become a\n               murder.\n\n     Hawk bobs under the table and up.\n\n                             HAWK\n               What else do you got under there\n               ... I don't want to be rude, but\n               this is all pretty lame.\n\n                             GATES\n               That's the beauty.  It's bullshit,\n               but I can make it stick because\n               I'm a good guy parole officer and\n               you re a bad guy who's about to\n               find out that there's a thin line\n               between ex-con and escape con.\n\n     Alex suddenly approaches the table.\n\n                             ALEX\n               How is everything tonight, sir?\n\n                             GATES\n               Beat it, Alex.  You're a dinosaur.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Alex, did you know this ape was\n               going to be here...\n\n                             ALEX\n               Sure.  That's why his meatballs\n               are made out of marinated Chuck\n               Wagon.\n\n                             GATES\n                       (mouthful)\n               You're full of shit.\n\n     As Alex speaks, an eating dog is on the screens.\n\n                             ALEX\n               No, man, actually you are.  Just\n               add water and it makes its own\n               gravy.  Keeps your teeth healthy\n               and your coat shiny.\n\n     Gates grabs the shoes and races off, gagging.  Hawk gets\n     up to laugh next to Alex.  Their laughter dies as they\n     turn to look at the black canvas bag left on the table\n     between them.\n\n     INT. BACK ROOM--DAWN\n\n     Hawk stares mournfully at a black and white photo of a\n     monkey-sized chalk-outline on a city street.  Behind him,\n     Alex pulls out blueprints from the black bag.  Sinatra's\n     \"Witchcraft\" blares on the radio....\n\n                             ALEX\n               Hmmmm.....\n\n                             HAWK\n               Yo Pandora, quit hummm-ing... look\n               at this.\n\n     Hawk is rummaging through stockpiled remnants of an old,\n     \"true\" bar.  Round lamps, tacky mirrors, pictures of Hawk\n     and the Regs at the bar.  Managing a weary smile, Hawk\n     lifts a ship steering wheel, while Alex puts on a pair of\n     granny classes and pulls out blueprints.\n\n                             HAWK\n               It's Captain Bob's steering wheel!\n               Remember when the Captain.....\n\n                             ALEX\n               Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.\n\n     Hawk nervously picks up a Rubik's Cube and holds it\n     behind his back.  He brings it back around, completed.\n     Sighing, Hawk drops the cube and rubs his scalp.  Alex\n     starts rubbing his stomach.  They pace in pre-job\n     syncopation and speak rapid-fire.\n\n                             HAWK\n               The safe's a Simpson 71.  Last\n               time I played the game, Simpson\n               only had a 40.\n\n                             ALEX\n               Just means it'll take you an extra\n               31 seconds to seduce.

I'm putting\n               out a fire with kerosene.\n\n     Alex gives Hawk a consoling two-hand-shake then jumps\n     back to reveal he has put Hawk into thumbcuffs.\n\n                             HAWK\n               This isn't funny.

A DOORMAN shoos them away...\n\n     A NEWSPAPER TRUCK pulls up in front of the Auction House.\n     The Driver pops out with a bundle of papers and moves to\n     a Dispenser on the corner.  The Bums wheel around the\n     truck.  The Driver loads the papers and bounds back.\n\n     The Truck pulls away from the corner.  The shopping cart\n     rolls off--the bums nowhere to be seen.\n\n     The Truck turns the corner, revealing the derelicts\n     climbing up the back of it, with Glad bags around their\n     necks.  The Truck moves toward an enclosed Walkway Bridge\n     that connects the Auction House with another Building.\n\n     Launching low-tech grapples, the Vagrants latch them-\n     selves onto the Walkway window as the Truck passes\n     beneath.\n\n     AT THE WINDOW\n\n     The viewer's viewpoint moves into a tighter view of the\n     dangling derelicts, revealing them to, of course, be Hawk\n     and Alex.  Getting a footing, on the small window ledge,\n     each man cuts a hole in the window while holding onto a\n     plunger.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole\n               than that.\n\n                             ALEX\n               Hey, you promised......Don't worry,\n               I'm wearing my girdle.\n\n     INT.

SEVENTH FLOOR AUCTION AUDITORIUM--NIGHT\n\n     Moving beneath a video camera and a dazzling Set of\n     Hanging Horse Mobiles, a Heavyset guard, BIG STAN, moseys\n     through the dimly lit main auction house auditorium.  The\n     auditorium chairs are strewn out in the middle beside a\n     turbo Floor Washer.\n\n     Next to a painting of Happy Children Riding Horses at the\n     back of the auditorium stage, Big Stan hefts himself upon\n     a comparatively TINY BLUE CHAIR and begins to tip back\n     and snooze.\n\n     INT.

He scans Anna coming\n     off the stage, gliding toward the phone table.

He sees the Mayflowers make a smooth exit.\n     He starts to give chase until he sees a battered Anna\n     rising from the ground.\n\n     A hanging white Tri-Star Pegasus, cracks from the\n     damaged ceiling and swooshes down towards Anna.\n\n     Hawk bolts upon some auction chairs and makes a flying\n     leap.  He slams Anna out of the Pegasus's pulverizing\n     Path.  They weary up off the ground and move down the\n     aisle, calm in a storm of packed art patrons.\n\n                             ANNA\n               My God, that was bold of you,\n               you didn't have to do that...\n\n                             HAWK\n               Forget about it--it was nothing--\n               anybody would have done the same\n               thing--It's an impulse...\n\n                             ANNA\n               No, I meant you didn't have to\n               tackle me and rip my dress.

Hawk and the\n     still-wildly whooshing gurney cut it off.\n\n     FRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE\n\n     Cesar pops his head through the partition.\n\n                             CESAR\n               Make him into Roadkill!\n\n     Antony, seemingly oblivious to the syringes porcupined in\n     his skull, pokes his head next to Cesar's.\n\n                             ANTONY\n               Yeah, run him down!\n\n     Cesar and the Bodyguard/Driver turn to Antony and scream,\n     then all three look out the windshield and scream.\n\n     THE AMBULANCE\n\n     jackknifes over a stopped car and somersaults into a\n     fiery ball.\n\n     In the foreground, Hawk's gurney coasts down\n\n     A PEACEFUL OFF-ROAD\n\n     Hawk, with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle\n     fear, comes to a tranquil gurney-wheels-gently-squeaking\n     stop.\n\n     Lit by the flames of the ambulance crash, a sneering\n     young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness,\n     carrying a steel suitcase.  He kneels before Hawk and\n     opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara-\n     tus.  He begins mumbling into a cellular phone.\n\n     A malevolent, SILENT DEADPAN WRAITH passes him and\n     approaches Hawk.  Both men are dressed in outfits that\n     seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute\n     couture.\n\n     On the fingers of one Wraith hand is carved the word\n     HATE.  On the other hand is the word FROG.  The Frog Hand\n     hands a befuddled Hawk a card.  It reads: MY NAME IS KIT\n     KAT AND THIS IS NOT A DREAM.\n\n     Hawk looks up with a \"huh\" expression as Kit Kat chops\n     his neck, knocking him off the gurney.\n\n     The sneering computer guy hangs up his phone and pulls\n     forward a small cattle prod from his apparatus.\n\n                             HAWK\n               This is the worst night...\n\n                             SNICKERS\n               When it rains, it pours.  Name's\n               Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.\n\n     Snickers zaps Hawk in the leg with his device.  Hawk a-\n     a-ghs into a kneeling position.  Snickers returns to his\n     suitcase and is passed by a PLEASANT YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in\n     the \"outfit.\"\n\n                             ALMOND JOY\n               Almond Joy.  I know, pretty silly.\n               But it's better than when we first\n               started out, our code names were\n               Diseases.  You don't know what\n               it's like being called Clymidia\n               for a year.\n                       (walking off)\n               Whoops, forgot....\n\n     She deftly kicks Hawk across the face.  Hawk angrily\n     bounds back up until he sees the BIGGEST MEMBER OF THE\n     GROUP Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum his way toward them.  Suddenly, the\n     Giant clumsily trips over Snickers' suitcase apparatus\n     and ram-collapses into Hawk and the gurney.  Laying atop\n     Hawk, Butterfinger goofily speaks...\n\n                             BUTTERFINGER\n               My name's Butterfinger.\n\n                             HAWK\n               No shit.\n\n     The mysterious group parts to reveal a much more mature\n     and cynically subdued man dressed in big lapels and a hat\n     that screams Old Time CIA.

At\n               the time, I was bald with a beard,\n               no moustache, and I had a different\n               nose, so if you don't recognize me,\n               I won't be offended.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Bastard, you're going to need\n               another nose!\n\n     Hawk explodes upward.

Deep down, I guess I\n               was just jealous.

Guess not.\n\n     Kaplan savagely point-blank punches Hawk in the face,\n     knocking him out cold and into the mammoth suitcase.\n     Snickers slams it shut revealing a KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL\n     sticker.\n\n     INT. MYSTERIOUS BARE ROOM--DAY\n\n     Hawk slowly awakens on an exotic couch.  He has been put\n     in an aggressively fashionable Italian outfit.  He eyes\n     and touches his new duds with complete bafflement.  He\n     then stumbles into a standing position to, mouth gaping,\n     take in a wondrous 360 degree view of Rome, Italy as \"O\n     Solo Mio\" blares on the soundtrack.\n\n                             HAWK\n               No.  Way.\n\n     Hawk's spinning view and the music on the soundtrack slam\n     to a halt as he zeroes in on the sight of Scary Butler\n     Alfred elegantly reaching the top of the staircase.\n\n                             ALFRED\n               Welcome to Rome, sir.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Yes way.\n\n     EXT. OUTSIDE INTERESTING BUILDING--DAY\n\n     Alfred opens the back door of an omnipotent, Mayflower-\n     logoed LIMOUSINE.  The car moves off as Hawk slides in...\n\n     INT. THE BACK SEAT OF THE MAX-TECH LIMOUSINE\n\n     facing Darwin Mayflower who is blustering into the\n     cellular.\n\n     While he talks, Darwin shakes Hawk's bewildered hand,\n     then holding up one finger in a \"be with you in a sec\"\n     facial move.\n\n                             DARWIN\n               For those kind of wages, I could\n               have built the factory in America!\n               They're Vietnamese, can't we just\n               give them more Bart Simpson shirts?\n               I hear depressing news like this\n               and I want to commit genocide!\n                       (slamming phone)\n               Alfred, hold my calls.

Initially it was a\n               priority to keep a lot of buffers\n               between you and me, but since most\n               of them are dead now, I thought\n               what the heck.  Hawk, you come\n               highly recommended.  I would have\n               done some things differently at\n               the auction house, but hey, I want\n               to be in business with you.\n\n     Darwin scans the Fax message with annoyance, and then\n     shoves it into a violent paper shredder.\n\n     OUTSIDE THE LIMO SHREDDER\n\n     Shredded paper litters out of a vent on the outside door.\n\n     INSIDE THE LIMOUSINE\n\n     A simmering Hawk tries to explode but the phone rings.\n\n                             HAWK\n               My life is not some deal.

Well, listen\n               close, babe.\n\n     Darwin holds the phone over a 50 cent piece-size siren in\n     his armrest.

MASSIVE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY\n\n     A mind-blowingly pretentious painting of Darwin, Minerva,\n     and Bunny hangs above a mammoth M-shaped conference table.\n\n     Lying atop the table in heels, shades, and a heart-\n     stopping dark outfit is Minerva.  NASTY Metal riffs semi-\n     audibly spew from a headset she wears.\n\n     Surrounding the table is a VARIED GROUP OF OLD MONEY AND\n     NEW MONEY BOARD MEMBERS ranging from a nine year old\n     INDIAN PRINCE to a SWEET ELDERLY AMERICAN WOMAN.  They\n     converse to the person at their side in businesslike\n     tones, oblivious to Minerva.\n\n                             DARWIN\n               Ladies and gentlemen of the board...\n\n     The board members go into tableau silence.

Bunny, the annoying dog,\n     scurries beside Hawk to catch it.\n\n     Moving down toward the other end of the table, Hawk takes\n     in the surreal surroundings with battle fatigue.  He sees\n     ONE BOARD MEMBER take a luxurious sip of cappuccino.\n     Minerva paces up upon the table.\n\n                             DARWIN\n               Hawkmeister, we got you clothes,\n               great hotel, and a 250,000 lira\n               per diem.\n\n                             MINERVA\n               That's two hundred dollars a day?\n               So he can get a hooker and some\n               tequila.

Alfred pulls Hawk's\n     hands around his back and cuffs him.  Bunny intensely\n     sniffs his crotch.\n\n                             MINERVA\n               We want Da Vinci's sketchbook,\n               what do they call it, the Codex.\n\n                             DARWIN\n               Listen Hawk, this might be hard to\n               believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I\n               just want to be happy and happiness\n               comes from the achieving of goals.\n               It's just when you make your first\n               billion by the age of 19, it's\n               hard to keep coming up with new\n               ones.

A MASSIVE WIDE SHOT OF ST. PETER'S--DAY\n\n     The Vatican stands in its glory, mobbed by HUNDREDS OF\n     LOCALS AND SIGHTSEERS.  The viewer's viewpoint zeroes in\n     on the Mayflower limousine circling around it.\n\n     INT. THE LIMOUSINE\n\n     Hawk looks out from the back seat of the limousine\n     in stylish Italian sunglasses.\n\n                             HAWK\n               I'm robbing the Vatican.  The nuns\n               at St. Agnes predicted that I'd end\n               up doing this...\n\n     Two identical Twin Flunkies sit across from him, grinning\n     stupidly.  Hawk pushes up his sunglasses with his middle\n     finger.\n\n     INT. VATICANESQUE MAP ROOM\n\n     Mentally casing the joint, Hawk gets some distance\n     between him and the flunkies as he enters into a room\n     that has a glorious, ancient Map of the World Mural.\n\n     INT. ANOTHER VATICAN ROOM\n\n     Hawk makes a scribble in a notepad before coming to a\n     Vatican guard, standing before a painting of a Pope\n     performing a Coronation.\n\n                             HAWK\n                       (half-hearted)\n               Excuse me, I'm being blackmailed\n               into robbing the Vatican by a\n               psychotic American corporation\n               along with a CIA...\n\n                             VATICAN GUARD\n               \"You're being\".....uh, I don't,\n               uh...\n\n     A jaded Hawk laughs and pats the cop on the back.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Forget it, man.  Go tackle a\n               jaywalker.\n\n     INT./EXT. CIRCULAR OPEN AIR HALLWAY\n\n     Hawk comes out onto a circular open-air hallway.  He\n     scans up to some rooftops and makes a note...until he\n     sees a line of International Phone Boothettes.  Checking\n     for Flunkies, he rips one up.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Operator, I want to make a collect\n               call to Alex Messina, New York....\n\n     The Flunkies drift into view.  Hawk hangs up and seethes\n     off.\n\n     INT. HALLWAY LEADING TO CODEX ROOM\n\n     Hawk saunters down a long resplendent hallway toward a\n     room at the end bustling with excitement.  Coming to the\n     mouth of the room, he looks to two gold framed mirrors on\n     either side of the opening, rubs his head, and scribbles.\n\n     INSIDE THE CODEX ROOM\n\n     Hawk takes in the majestic beauty, and practical details,\n     of the room--windows, statues, a Massive Ornate Lighting\n     Fixture--as he moves down one of the twin winding stair-\n     cases leading to a path of people behind velvet ropes and\n     the object of their gaze...\n\n     THE DA VINCI CODEX\n\n     --an old book enclosed in a glass case, propped open to\n     the familiar BEAUTIFUL DRAWING of a MAN inside a CIRCLE.\n\n     The case is located between two informational tablets\n     enclosed in glass columns.  Enter Holy Da Vinci theme.\n\n                             ANNA (V.O.)\n               But it is his gift as an inventor\n               who drew together science and art\n               that is most incredible.\n\n     Hawk brightens to the return of Anna, carrying a portfolio\n     bag, striding down the stairs with a group of INVESTORS\n     AND FAMILIES.  She brightens back, giving him a quick\n     verbal breath and a hand squeeze.\n\n                             ANNA\n               Tough guy.

Hawk eyes the elephant strangely.\n\n                             ANNA\n               These more dangerous designs\n               inspired him to develop a secret\n               code that ....\n\n     The stuffed elephant suddenly goes flying over Anna's\n     head.\n\n     The ALARM goes off.  The Massive Ornate Lighting Fixture\n     swoops down from the ceiling, inverting in air, and slams\n     down over the Codex, transformed into a makeshift cage.\n\n     Strange green gas comes billowing out of the vents.\n     Needless to say, everyone goes crazy.\n\n     Coughing gas, Hawk peeks to see that a line of light\n     sensor alarms imbedded in the tablets are what set the\n     alarm off.\n\n     Two GAS MASKS drop airlinesquely from the mouth of the\n     entranceway and TWO RACING-IN GUARDS wrangle them on.\n\n     The Little Brat sees that Pokey the stuffed elephant has\n     been beheaded by the cage/lamp.  She is pulled away and\n     spanked.\n\n                             LITTLE BRAT\n               Pokey, come back!\n\n     Anna yanks a notetaking Hawk away as the gas blusters in\n     around him.

The wall closes as the Flunkies come\n     flying out, baffled.\n\n     INT.

Did it for fun.\n               Ciao.\n\n     Kaplan and the crew quickly disperse in different\n     directions as Hawk howls in frustration.  Kit Kat moves\n     behind Hawk and perfectly mimics him.\n\n                             HAWK\n               What did you have against Little\n               Eddie, motherfucker?  He was just\n               a monkey who liked to laugh.\n               Come back without your yuppie\n               army.  I'll triscuit you, you\n               space shuttle eating...Shit.!\n\n     Without looking, Hawk elbows the mimic Kit Kat in the\n     face.  Kit Kat gives Hawk a strange smile and hands him\n     a card that reads:  BEWARE THE ODD STEPS.\n\n     Hawk looks up from the card.  Kit Kat is gone, but\n     Butterfinger scampers in his place.\n\n                             BUTTERFINGER\n               Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got those 72\n               stamps!\n\n     Sighing, Hawk takes the huge sheath of stamps.\n\n     EXT. INDOOR TRAIN TRACK\n\n     One of the small Vatican mail trains bullets across an\n     indoor track.  The viewer's viewpoint whooshes to catch\n     up, focusing on a very large package, addressed to the\n     Pope, that has Hawk's sheath of stamps slapped onto it.\n     The train zips into a tunnel.\n\n     INT. THE VATICAN UNDERGROUND SUBWAY\n\n     The train rumbles into the Vatican mini-station.  TWO\n     HARRIED WORKERS heave up the strange cargo onto a sorting\n     table.\n\n     A bell rings as a clock hits 10.  The workers do a sigh\n     of relief.  Shucking off their uniforms, they head out.\n\n     A hand rips out of the huge package.\n\n     INT. OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM--NIGHT\n\n     Hawk pops out of the secret passageway door and moves to\n     the mouth of the doorless Codex room.  He pauses to\n     hand-comb his hair in the two large, framed mirrors at\n     the sides.\n\n     THE CODEX ROOM\n\n     Carrying the now frameless mirrors in each hand, Hawk\n     hustles to the top of the steps and suddenly stops.\n\n                             HAWK\n               \"Beware the Odd Steps.\"\n\n     Hawk crouches down and notices the step below him has a\n     clear magnetic tape running across it to a dime sized\n     alarm button.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Why Kit Kat, aren't you a\n               gentleman...\n\n     Hawk bounds down every other one of the steps down to\n     where the Codex is bathed in a holy light.\n\n     He hefts up the two now frameless mirrors and puts them\n     each in a groove of a collapsible yardstick running\n     across the top.  The parallel mirrors now face out from\n     each other.  Hawk sprays a blast of Clairol to reveal the\n     light sensor beams, and then with a deep breath, he\n     thrusts the mirrors into the beams.\n\n     The light bounces harmlessly off the mirrors and Hawk\n     exhales.  He balances the connected mirrors then crawls\n     through his tent-like passageway.\n\n     Hawk squirts acid from a biker's bottle on the cracks of\n     the rectangular glass case that holds the Codex.  The\n     acid sizzles.\n\n     INT. VATICAN LIBRARY HALLWAY--NIGHT\n\n     A BURLY GUARD thoughtfully stares at a painting, fingers\n     propping his chin like an critic then continues ambling\n     on.\n\n     THE CODEX ROOM\n\n     Rubbing his head, Hawk gives an excited smile as the glass\n     cracks of the rectangular case loosen.  Hawk pulls out a\n     pocket fisherman....\n\n     The viewer's viewpoint moves upward to reveal, through\n     the mouth of the room, the Burly Guard is coming down\n     the hall.\n\n     OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM\n\n     Burly Guard approaches the outskirts of the Codex room.\n     He combs his hair into the piece of wall in the now\n     empty mirror-frame then REALIZES.\n\n     Muttering Italian into his walkie-talkie, Burly Guard\n     rushes into the room and looks down to the sensor\n     deflecting mirrors.\n\n     He passes a statue, behind which, Hawk is revealed to\n     be standing.\n\n     Burly Guard approaches the Codex and sees the dripping\n     acid.  He also notices a fishing hook attached to the\n     binding of the Codex.  The fishing wire leads out of\n     the glass case.  The Guard reaches to touch it when\n     suddenly the wire is pulled tightly upward by a\n     moving-out-from-behind-the-statue Hawk.\n\n     The Codex FLIES off its perch, setting off the ALARM and\n     sending the bizarre cage/lamp CRASHING DOWN and AROUND\n     the hapless Burly Guard.  The green gas commences its\n     noxious billowing as the Codex swooshes into Hawk's\n     hands.  He then hurls a softball, smashing a window\n     on the other side of the room.\n\n     The familiar Vatican Guard and a Guard Three barrel\n     down into the mouth of the codex room.  Only one\n     Gas Mask drops from the doorway.  The Vatican Guard\n     pulls it on and gives a \"That's Life\" shrug of\n     shoulders to the fainting Guard three.\n\n     Hawk puts on the missing gas mask and launches a grapple\n     around the ceiling cord of the dropped Ornate Lighting\n     Fixture.  Hawk then Tarzans from one staircase to\n     another.  He then ungrapples and heads toward the\n     shattered window.\n\n     The Vatican Guard waits a stunned moment before giving\n     chase.\n\n     EXT. THE ROOF\n\n     Hawk flings off his gas mask and begins a classical\n     skipping-across-the-rooftop jaunt.  Suddenly a brick\n     on the slightly slanted roof gives way and Hawk FALLS.\n     His canvas bag goes skipping down across the roof,\n     landing against the antennae.\n\n     INT. THE POPE'S BEDROOM\n\n     A T.V. showing Mr. Ed. speaking to Wilbur in Italian\n     goes fuzzy.  THE POPE, wearing his famous hat and a Notre\n     Dame bathrobe angrily bangs on it.\n\n     EXT. THE ROOF\n\n     Hawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof\n     and slides down toward the dangling-off-the-antennae bag.\n\n     The Vatican Guard pops out of the window and fires a\n     warning shot.\n\n     Hawk stretches to the bag.  His fingers touch as the\n     Guard continues to bound forward.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Please God, Please God.......let\n               the guard shoot me.\n\n     Hawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see Vatican\n     Guard hovering over him on the roof.\n\n                             VATICAN GUARD\n               The worm's on the other foot,\n               yankee noodle candy.\n\n     Hawk sees the Vatican Guard's foot move toward the\n     grapple.  Hawk ferociously tugs, ripping the Guard\n     off-balance and knocking down a side of the roof.\n\n     EXT. TOP OF A NEARBY WALL\n\n     Hawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple\n     across a road around a tree branch.  Hawk ties the end of\n     grapple line, tosses on a friction belt, takes a breath\n     and JUMPS OFF THE WALL.  The viewer follows him on his\n     breathtaking ride.\n\n     The brused Vatican Guard flops back atop the roof.  He\n     gets off a wild shot before crumpling back down.\n\n     HAWK\n\n     is alnost to the other side when the Guard's bullet hits\n     the friction belt.  Hawk drops with a wild scream...\n     and lands with a painful straddle atop a street lamppost.\n     His eyes bug out with the thought of a life without\n     children.  He slowly spins off the lamppost and sails\n     down upon...\n\n     EXT. A BUS\n\n     and the comfortable luggage housed on top of it.  Hawk\n     tries to maintain his balance upon the wobbling\n     baggage, but the bus makes a quick turn and Hawk goes\n     flying off...\n\n     EXT. RIGHT INTO A CAFE CHAIR--NIGHT\n\n     Panting and discombobulated, Hawk looks across the table\n     to the female hands holding open a menu.  The menu comes\n     down.  It is Anna.  Hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas\n     bag.\n\n                             ANNA\n               Oh Hudson, I was worried you\n               weren't going to drop by....\n\n                             HAWK\n               I never break a date.  Scout's\n               honor.\n\n     Hawk does the honor sign with his black gloved hand\n     then quickly rips it off as a WAITER comes to the\n     table.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Fettucini con Funghi Porcini.\n\n                             WAITER\n               Bellissimo, signor.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Oh, and could I have some ketchup\n               with that.\n\n     Anna hits her forehead with the palm of her hand while\n     the waiter's entire body sinks in disappointment.  Other\n     TABLE OCCUPANTS sadly shake their heads.\n\n     EXT. ANOTHER TABLE--NIGHT\n\n     At a comfortable distance curled behind a heat lamp,\n     Snickers is being an Uglier American to an UNCOMPREHENDING\n     WAITER, while Almond Joy chuckles and Butterfinger spreads\n     butter over an entire baguette.\n\n                             SNICKERS\n               Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger,\n               Fren-n-ch Fries.

Butterfinger devours his bread.\n\n                             SNICKERS\n               Italy, France, Moscow.  They all\n               just wanna be Nebraska.  Old Man\n               Kaplan thinks since Communism is\n               dead, we got nothing to do.  Man,\n               Democracy isn't free elections.\n               We gotta teach the world that\n               Democracy is Big Tits, College\n               Football on Saturdays, Eddie\n               Murphy saying the word \"Fuck\"\n               and Kids putting their hands down\n               garbage disposals on \"America's\n               Funniest Home Videos.\"\n\n                             ALMOND JOY\n               Damn baby, when's the last time\n               you had a vacation...Jesus, I\n               gotta get out of this job.

Hawk nabs it.\n\n                             HAWK\n               This is bueno.  They had the worst\n               ketchup in prison.....uh...\n\n                             ANNA\n               Prison?\n\n                             HAWK\n               I was the Warden?\n\n                             ANNA\n               How long were you in?\n\n                             HAWK\n               Let's just say, I never saw E.T.\n\n                             ANNA\n               Wow, you were \"in the joint.\"\n               \"Doing hard time.\"  It's funny,\n               but that excites me.

ANNA'S HOUSE--NIGHT\n\n       The viewer's viewpoint pulls back, past the black canvas\n       bag on a table, to reveal a barefoot Anna is straddling\n       a bare-backed Hawk, demurely and tentatively studying his\n       bruises.\n\n                             ANNA\n               What have you been doing?\n\n                             HAWK\n               Uh....old badminton injury.\n\n     Anna giggles and bends to kiss a bruise.  She stops\n     herself and opts for tickling.\n\n                             HAWK\n               tickles, ticKleS, TICKLES.\n\n                             ANNA\n                       (not stopping)\n               Oh, I'm so sorry...\n\n     Roaring with laughter, they capsize onto the floor.\n     Hawk slithers around to devour her toes.  Anna closes\n     her eyes and arches her back.....\n\n     She opens her eyes and sees a large crucifix staring\n     right at her.  With a gasp, she rolls away from Hawk\n     and stands up, trying to brush off her sins.\n\n                             ANNA\n               I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....\n\n                             HAWK\n                       (softly approaching)\n               Hey now, outside of a very\n               friendly dog this morning, it's\n               been a slow decade.  I don't make\n               love every ten years, I get a\n               little cranky.\n\n                             ANNA\n               It's also been a long time for\n               me.  I--\n\n     Their heads fuse for a semi-classic screen kiss until\n     THE CRUCIFIX LIGHTS UP AND BEGINS SHOUTING IN ITALIAN.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Catholic girls are scary...\n\n                            ANNA\n               Somebody robbed the Vatican.\n\n                            HAWK\n               Oh.  No.\n\n     Anna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat.\n     She bumps into the canvas bag.  The Codex slides out.\n     They both catch it in mid-air.  Anna's eyes pop.  She\n     wrenches the Codex away and kicks.  Hawk pulls her into\n     a compassionate back-against-his-stomach hug.

OUTSIDE THE CASTLE--NIGHT\n\n     Moving into the chopper, Anna glimpses, Bunny, the\n     obnoxious dog, in a Mayflower logo dog tag, taking a leak\n     on some bushes.  She fakes a yawn to the like dressed Kit\n     Kat who fakes one back.\n\n     INT. THE G.

In the place of where one\n     remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets, beneath\n     which are unassembled parts of the machine.\n\n     Inside, a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball\n     machine.  In tennis gear and goggles, Darwin Mayflower\n     thwacks it against the wall of (now faded) frescos.\n\n     Also in tennis threads, Minerva is laying on a chaise\n     lounge holding a gadget in her hand.\n\n                             DARWIN\n               Seven!\n\n     Minerva turns the gadget up to SEVEN and presses a\n     button.  Another tennis ball shoots out, a little faster.\n     Darwin batters it.  The ball ricochets into the forehead\n     of an \"amused\" Alfred who is retrieving balls in sweat\n     pants.\n\n                             ALFRED\n               Jolly.  Good.  Shot.

Kaplan pulls it over to\n     Darwin, who pulls up his goggles and fondles the ancient\n     binding.  Taking a knife from Kaplan, he begins to slit\n     it open.\n\n                             MINERVA\n                       (bouncing up)\n               No, let me!\n\n                             DARWIN\n                       (pout)\n               I don't care.\n\n     Hawk looks away to the billowing sheets and the strange\n     machine parts behind them.\n\n     Minerva slits the bindings and tugs out another geometri-\n     cally perverted crystal.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Another piece of the puzzle for\n               the Da Vinci Alchemy project.\n\n     Kaplan, Darwin, and Minerva look up to Hawk, then to each\n     other, all start to speak, then all stop.\n\n     This quandary is deferred by the entrance of the twin\n     Flunkies.\n\n                             DARWIN\n               Oh, you.  There's nothing more I\n               hate than failure.  All you had to\n               do was follow the Hawk, it's not\n               like I said \"Teach our nation's\n               children how to read.\"\n\n     Hawk uses the distraction to amble toward the sheets.\n\n                             DARWIN\n               I guess we're just going to have\n               to kill 'em...\n\n     Shockingly swift, Minerva pulls a small gun from beneath\n     her tennis dress and blasts a burning hole between each\n     set of Flunky eyes, splattering them to the ground.\n\n                             DARWIN\n               God Minerva, I was kidding.\n\n     A SHOCKED HAWK\n\n     quickly turns from the blithe carnage and pulls up a\n     sheet.  He reveals the familiar Gold Machine Demonhead.\n\n     THE MAYFLOWERS\n\n     reverberate off each other with laughter.  Bloodstained,\n     Kaplan and Almond Joy exchange an eye bulge.  Minerva's\n     smile disappears as she sees Hawk by the sheets.\n\n                             MINERVA\n               Get away from there, convict!\n\n                             HAWK\n               Just browsing.

ROME CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY\n\n     Beneath the wacky portrait, Darwin circles the board-\n     member filled conference table as Minerva smooches Bunny.\n     Everyone watches Alfred place a bar of Gold and of Lead\n     in the hands of a blindfolded Hawk at the middle of the M.\n\n                             DARWIN\n               So, Captain Hawk, in one of your\n               paws you got a gold bar worth\n               about 8 thou.

The wigging out passers-\n     by give them space.\n\n                             HAWK\n               You bastard!

He shakily\n     raises his gun.\n\n                             ALEX\n               Hawk... I'm so sorry...\n\n     Hawk roars forward like a bull and helmets Alex.  They\n     roll together down the massive staircase past Darwin,\n     Minerva, and the CIA who react with \"This can't be\n     happening\" catatonia.\n\n     Two SHOTS go off as Hawk and Alex crash to the bottom of\n     the staircase.  Hawk rises up in a daze to see Alex on the\n     ground with two bloody bullet holes.\n\n                             HAWK\n               No.....Alex!  Wake up, you can't\n               go out like this.\n\n     Hawk falls to his knees as Snickers hustles toward him.\n     Suddenly, sirens are heard as a police van pulls up.\n     Snickers stops.\n\n     Four policemen blast from the back of the van.  One holds\n     back the crowd.  One strenuously pulls Hawk into the van.\n     The other two drag in Alex.\n\n     The villains look to each other for non-existent guidance\n     as the van pulls away.\n\n                             MINERVA\n               Plan B, anyone...\n\n     Using initiative, Snickers hops on a Vespa and roars off\n     after them.  The van can be seen swerving off.....\n\n     AROUND A CORNER\n\n     where it bolts up into a much larger truck marked VATICAN\n     SOUVENIRS.  TWO SEEMINGLY-INNOCENT-BYSTANDER PRIESTS break\n     demeanor to flop up the wheel ramps, slam close the back\n     of the truck, lock it shut, and continue on their solemn\n     way.\n\n     The TRUCK BELLOWS off as the Vespa spins around the corner.\n     Snickers brakes and looks around for the police van.  He\n     hits his handle with frustration.\n\n     EXT. BEAUTIFUL ROME OVERVIEW\n\n     Out of her habit but still in her incredible sunglasses,\n     Anna looks out to a lovely view of Italy.  The Vatican Truck\n     pulls up behind her.  A giddy, blood-stained Alex and a not-\n     so-giddy Hawk bound out of the back.  Alex excitedly gives\n     himself an insulin shot.\n\n                             ANNA\n               Oh thank God, you're dead...\n\n                             ALEX\n               It was so beautiful!

If I was\n               sane, I'd be on that plane to Rio.\n               But being beaten and abused to\n               fulfill some corporation's\n               perverted vision does something to\n               your mental health.

THE KREMLIN GROUNDS\n\n     Dressed in cat burglar black and all chewing gum, Hawk,\n     Alex, and Anna crawl across the Kremlin grounds.

He looks in the distance to the motivating CIA\n     team.  Suddenly a card floats down into his hand.\n\n     It reads:   WILLIAM TELL.  ADAM'S APPLE.  GET IT?\n\n     The not-getting-it Guard looks up from the card as a\n     grinning Kit Kat parachutes behind him.

GRUNGY WHITE FOYER\n\n     open and sets off an annoying hammer-against-bell alarm.\n     Alex all-fours beneath the alarm.  Hawk does a Michael\n     Jordan vault off Alex's back and slam dunks A MASSIVE\n     BALL OF USED-GUM, pulled from his bag, between the\n     hammer and the bell, cutting off the sound.  They rush\n     ahead.\n\n     EXT. THE KREMLIN ROOF\n\n     The agents are trotting across the roof when a phone on\n     Snickers' apparatus rings.

A GRAND BALLROOM\n\n     The good guys scurry upon the second level of an epic\n     and gorgeous ballroom.  Two lush staircases lead up from\n     the floor.  From behind a pillar, the gang checks out\n     the activity below.\n\n     A tablecloth is being wrangled over a large table at\n     the opposite end of the ballroom by SERVANTS.

He holds up an \"About Time\" card.  The agents laugh\n     and greet them.\n\n     INT. A VERY LONG, ENIGMATIC HALLWAY\n\n     Hawk, Alex, and Anna pass through a set of windowed\n     double doors into a very long hallway that leads into a\n     pitch darkness.  A MURAL OF A HAPPY, ARM-STRETCHED LENIN\n     looms above the doors.  They give it a a quick glance\n     before pulling out screwdrivers and wire hangers.\n\n                             ALEX\n               Eighth room down, babe...\n\n                             ANNA\n               Guards come exactly every three\n               minutes....\n\n                             HAWK\n               Three.

A solid\n     gold hammer and sickle hang on one wall...\n\n                             HAWK AND ALEX\n               \"Just traveling along, singing a\n               song.

Hawk reaches\n     for the curtain.  Alex puts his arm around him and speaks,\n     not sings.\n\n                             ALEX\n               Side by side, man...\n\n     Suddenly, the roof above them explodes.

Alex\n     crumples backward, moaning.  Butterfinger, casually, but\n     with incredible strength, holds Hawk's arms behind his\n     back.\n\n                             HAWK\n               No....\n\n                             ALMOND JOY\n               That was pretty uncool, George...\n\n                             KAPLAN\n               Sorry, you know he kind of reminds\n               me of Little Eddie.

She dives behind the\n     railing.\n\n     THE ART TREASURES ROOM\n\n     Kaplan lowers his gun.\n\n                             KAPLAN\n               I can't believe this.

The Gold Hammer\n     next trembles off the wall and crushes Butterfinger's\n     skull.\n\n                             HAWK\n               You want immature, how 'bout an\n               egg fight...\n\n     Hawk flings a Faberge egg, smashing the gun out of Kaplan's\n     hand.  Hawk pelts a batch more at him.  Kaplan sloppily\n     whips some eggs back.  Hawk finally smashes one in half\n     and beans the jagged piece into Kaplan's eye.  He squeals\n     to the ground, geysering blood.\n\n     Hawk swoops down to a wheezing, breath controlling Alex.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Alex, are you....\n\n                             ALEX\n               I can't believe you didn't notice.\n               My weight.

Hang in there...\n\n     THE BALLROOM\n\n     Bullets stop splintering around Anna at the railing as\n     the soldiers fling out their empty cartridges to reload.\n\n     Snickers, Almond Joy, and Kit Kat race out of the hall-\n     way area into the ballroom area.  They stop at the sight\n     of Anna....\n\n                             ALMOND JOY\n               Anna-bannana-fo-fanna, I guess I\n               have to cut out your heart for\n               real now.  It's not personal.\n\n     Anna feebly raises her gun.  Almond Joy laughs and\n     pulls out a knife.\n\n                             ALMOND JOY\n               You won't shoot.  I read your\n               dossier... Sister.\n\n     The Soviet Soldiers snap in new cartridges as Almond Joy\n     moves out from behind the pillar towards Anna.  The\n     Soldiers blast away at this newly appearing figure.\n\n     Almond Joy ruptures and vibrates in a Sonny Corleone\n     ballet.\n\n                             ALMOND JOY\n               I gotta get a new job...\n\n     Snickers and Kit Kat militarily roll on either side of\n     Anna as their partner wilts to the ground.  The men,\n     Snickers with his mini-Uzi, Kit Kat with his cross-\n     bow rifle, briefly leap up to fire down at the soldiers\n     with some graphic success.\n\n     Anna watches Darwin and Minerva head up the stairs to\n     her level.  She bolts off....\n\n     BALLROOM FLOOR\n\n     The last of the Soviet VIPS flee as the Soldiers tip\n     over the M shaped table on its side, using it for\n     cover, firing upward.\n\n     KIT KAT\n\n     breaks off and scurries around the second level to get\n     a position behind the M.\n\n     He fires down an arrow for a successful kill.  Another\n     guard tries to fire up, but Kit Kat impales him to the\n     back of the table with a quality shot.\n\n     Kit Kat grins and reloads as Alfred, the butler, regally\n     creeps behind him.\n\n     HAWK\n\n     comes out of the long hallway double doors up to where\n     Anna is bustling.  They hug...\n\n                             ANNA\n               The Mayflowers got...\n\n     Hawk and Anna turn to see the Mayflowers hastening in\n     their direction.  Noticing them back, the model-toting\n     Mayflowers halt.\n\n     KIT KAT\n\n     turns to Alfred and fires his crossbow.  Alfred effort-\n     lessly cuts it in half with his blade and continues\n     to move forward.  Still smiling, Kit Kat tries to reload.\n\n     MINERVA\n\n     breaks the standstill.\n\n                             DARWIN\n               What a pleasant surprise.  You're\n               probably wondering...\n\n                             HAWK\n               But you're going to tell us\n               anyway...\n\n                             MINERVA\n               I hate a man with a sense of\n               humor.

Hawk blocks it then whomps\n     him in the chest.\n\n     As they battle, Darwin grabs Anna's hair, slams her\n     into a pillar, and watches her crumple.\n\n     KIT KAT\n\n     gets in an arrow but it's too late.  Alfred stabs\n     him deep, deep, deeply, and lifts him from the ground.\n\n     A shower of cards reading \"OUCH\" \"PAIN\" and \"THIS REALLY\n     HURTS\" rain from out of Kit Kat's coat.\n\n     Alfred discards him over the edge.\n\n     Kit Kat sails down upon the M.\n\n     The lone card of \"FUCK\" plops from his open eyed corpse.\n\n     HAWK\n\n     and Snickers trades fierce blows, stumbling down a\n     staircase.\n\n     DARWIN\n\n     and Minerva watch the fight with amusement.  Alfred\n     approaches.\n\n                             DARWIN\n               Alfred, the getaway car...\n\n     SNICKERS\n\n     slashes Hawk in the arm with a small but sinister blade.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Damnit, I hate this!

They\n     start to trot off...\n\n                             MINERVA\n               I knew it!

Snickers somersaults\n     up and frantically tries to pull off the bomb.\n\n     Snickers wails to the soldiers, who have lowered their\n     guns and are poking their heads out of the M to watch.\n\n                             SNICKERS\n               Help me you Democratic Reform\n               lovers!

Minerva emerges from behind the pillar and\n     moves forward.\n\n     THE LONG ENIGMATIC HALLWAY\n\n     Hawk chugs beneath the Lenin mural and down the hall-\n     way.  He sees Darwin breezing in front of him.  Darwin\n     looks back to Hawk then runs forward into the darkness.\n\n     THE BALLROOM\n\n     Minera sits down next to the pained Alex.\n\n                             MINERVA\n               Alex.  How's it going?\n\n                             ALEX\n               Go, go to Hell, to Hell.\n\n     Minerva pulls out a candy bar and rips it open.\n\n                             MINERVA\n               Where's your insulin....No?  Well,\n               Bon Appetite.\n\n     Minerva savagely slams Alex's head down and shoves the\n     candy bar in his mouth.\n\n     THE HALLWAY\n\n     Hawk moves closer and closer to the darkness of the\n     hallway when a one-eyed and bleeding George Kaplan dives\n     out of the Art Treasures room and tackles him.  Hawk\n     kicks him off...\n\n                             HAWK\n               Oh, come on....\n\n     THE BALLROOM\n\n     Alex gulps down the last of the candy bar, shivering.\n\n                             MINERVA\n               Very good, Alex, but you re\n               still alive....\n\n     She pulls out another candy bar.  Alex, with a last\n     burst of strength, punches her across the face.\n\n                             MINERVA\n               That's fair.\n\n     THE LONG HALLWAY\n\n     Hawk and Kaplan lock onto each other's throats.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Why does this have to be so hard...\n\n                             KAPLAN\n               Tell me about it...\n\n     Suddenly, of all things, a car is heard rumbling in the\n     darkness.\n\n     Hawk and Kaplan stop fighting and turn to see THE MAY-\n     FLOWER LIMOUSINE screeching out of the darkness with\n     Darwin standing out of the sunroof firing a gun.\n\n     Bullets fly around them.  From his back pocket, Hawk\n     slaps the nice picture of him and Little Eddie into\n     Kaplan's hands.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Take this to Hell with you...\n\n     Hawk jumps up and grabs a hanging lamp.\n\n     Deranged with confusion, Kaplan turns from the picture\n     to the charging limousine.\n\n                             KAPLAN\n               My pension.....\n\n     The driving Alfred smiles through the windshield.\n\n     Kaplan's body slams into a vivid somersaulting crash\n     into the windshield.\n\n     Hawk's hands burn and sizzle on the hanging lamp.\n\n     Passing beneath, Darwin raises up his gun.\n\n     Hawk lets go of the lamp and drops down on Darwin,\n     locking his legs around his neck and crushing him\n     down into....\n\n     THE BACKSEAT OF THE LIMOUSINE\n\n     Hawk and Darwin grapple on the floor of the limo.  The\n     Da Vinci helicopter model bobs on the backseat.  Darwin's\n     gun goes off..\n\n     right through Alfred's throat.  He slumps over, pressing\n     down on the accelerator.\n\n     THE LIMOUSINE\n\n     blasts down the hallway, sparking off the wall, and\n     bashing off paintings and mirrors.\n\n     THE BACKSEAT\n\n     Darwin flicks on his paper shredder and shoves the side\n     of Hawk's hand into its teeth.\n\n     OUTSIDE THE LIMOUSINE\n\n     A mist of blood coughs out of the shredder vent and makes\n     a weird bloody line across the wall.\n\n     INT. BACKSEAT\n\n     Hawk yanks his hand from the shredder and grabs the meg-\n     lomaniac by the hair and shoves his head down on the\n     arm rest.  Hawk turns on the piercing siren and Darwin's\n     eyes try to escape his head with a high pitched scream.\n     Darwin's entire body bucks wildly.\n\n     Darwin back-elbows Hawk and moves down for his gun.\n     Hawk pulls him back by his hair, grabs him by the balls,\n     and pushes him upward through the sunroof.\n\n                             DARWIN\n               God-damnit, I only wanted to\n               destroy the world in my own image.\n               I'm a regular Joe...\n\n     Darwin pounds his fists on Hawk's head as Hawk hits the\n     sunroof switch sliding it shut on Darwin, pinning\n     his arms below the roof, but leaving his torso twisting\n     in the wind.\n\n     The mural of a happy Lenin with his arms outstretched\n     looms ahead waiting to greet Darwin.\n\n     Putting two and two together, Darwin loses it....\n\n                             DARWIN\n               Not Lenin, anybody but Lenin.  God,\n               let's talk abut this.\n\n     The limousine charges through the double doors and Darwin's\n     body connects with the mural.\n\n     INSIDE THE LIMO\n\n     Hearing the crunch, Hawk flips into the front seat and\n     brakes the vehicle.  Alfred's head bounces against the\n     steering wheel.  Hawk reaches over with a grin and picks\n     up the Da Vinci model.  He looks to Alfred, Kaplan\n     crunched in the windshield, and Darwin's dangling legs.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Wow, this is really gonna hurt the\n               resale value...\n\n     THE BALLROOM\n\n     Hawk runs up to a woozy Anna and helps her up.  She has\n     a cross-shaped blood stain on her forehead.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Oh, honey....\n\n     Hawk looks to Alex, sitting on the stairs, the same way\n     he left him.  Hawk rushes to him.\n\n                             HAWK\n               We did it man, we...\n\n     Hawk grabs Alex's shoulder.  Alex falls back.  Written\n     over his face in red lipstick is REALLY DEAD.\n\n     Engaging a slow motion sequence, Minerva saunters behind\n     Anna, putting on red lipstick.  Minerva slams her back\n     to the ground.\n\n     Hawk howls then turns to see stiff-upper-lip Alfred,\n     bleeding from the neck.  Hawk tries to throw a punch,\n     but Alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face.\n\n     The Da Vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs\n     in slow motion and cracks open, revealing the intricate\n     mirror of the opening scene.\n\n     INT. DARK ROOM ATOP MAYFLOWER MUSEUM--DAY\n\n     A damaged Hawk awakens in a dungeonish room and stumbles\n     to some shutters.  \"O Solo Mio\" returns on the sound-\n     track as the shutters open to a postcard view of Vinci.\n\n     Hawk closes the shutters and cuts off the music.  A\n     slightly more composed Anna touches his shoulder causing\n     him to jump slightly.  They melt into a kiss.\n\n                             ANNA\n               Oh Hudson...\n\n                             HAWK\n               I told you not to call me Hudson.\n               The only people who called me that\n               were the nuns at...\n\n                             ANNA\n               Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the\n               Catholic church as well as an\n               agent.\n\n                             HAWK\n                       (cut-off laugh)\n               This is too bad to be false.\n\n     Alfred enters the room in his favorite outfit with a\n     bandage around his neck.  His voice is strange, but still\n     polite.\n\n                             ALFRED\n               Welcome back to Vinci.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Last rites, sister?\n\n                             ANNA\n               Please, no nun jokes...They're a\n               bad habit to get into....get it?\n\n     Hawk and Anna unconvincingly laugh then sadly pause.\n\n                              HAWK\n               She killed Alex.\n\n     Alfred gives them a push.\n\n     INT. THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP\n\n     Alfred leads them through the Da Vinci workshop past the\n     bat winged glider and incongruously crammed-in tennis ball\n     machine.\n\n     INT. THE ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE--DAY\n\n     Alfred grandly opens double-doors to reveal that Da\n     Vinci's gold machine has been majestically re-created\n     piece by piece.  In the periphery, the 90's rears its\n     head in the form of THREE TECHNICIANS wearing headsets\n     and gun holsters who consult computer terminals.\n\n                              MINERVA (O.S.)\n               GOLD-FI-ING-ER!\n\n     Hawk and Anna turn to see Minerva splashily enter in\n     sexy funeral-wear.\n\n                              MINERVA\n               Sorry, I couldn't resist.  You're\n               probably wondering why you're\n               still alive.  Anna.....\n\n     As Minerva speaks, TECHNICIAN ONE forcibly escorts Anna\n     toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly\n     handcuffs her to it.\n\n                              MINERVA\n               I want you to monitor the Da\n               Vinci's directions from the\n               apprentice diary.  And Hawk, I\n               didn't want you to go to hell\n               without knowing that Darwin and\n               I's dream came true.\n                       (suddenly sheepish)\n               Beside that, none of us can seem\n               to put that damn crystal together.\n               Alfie and I were up all night with\n               the thing.\n\n     TECHNICIAN TWO commences a forcible escort of Hawk to the\n     gold machine.  Hawk cold-cocks him to the ground.\n\n                              HAWK\n               You killed a friend.  Why should I\n               help you go for the gold?\n\n                              MINERVA\n               It'll take a couple of years of\n               steady production, but I'll flood\n               the market with so much gold that\n               gold itself, the foundation of all\n               finance, will lose its meaning.\n               Brokers, economists, and fellow\n               entrepreneurs will drown in the\n               saliva of their own nervous\n               breakdowns.  Markets will crash-\n               crash.  Financial Empires will\n               crumble-crumble.\n\n                              HAWK\n               Except yours-yours.  The goal of\n               world domination.  Well, if you\n               put it that way, Minnie.  How can\n               I resist?\n\n                              MINERVA\n               You can't, convict!  You're just\n               a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the\n               fantasy the planet revolves around\n               them.  It rains, car crash stops\n               traffic, you say \"How could this\n               happen to me?\"  It's a natural\n               inclination.  But for I, this\n               isn't a fantasy, it is reality!\n               You are on my planet!  You walk\n               around the corner for coffee, out\n               of my sight, you do not fucking\n               exist!  The lives of shmoes like\n               you have meaning only in relation\n               to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!\n\n     Anna looks at the oil cloth diary before her.  She pulls\n     a compact from her pocket and holds the compact mirror\n     over the scribblings.  Reading off the reflection, her\n     eyes widen.\n\n                              ANNA\n               Do it.  There's no reason to fight\n               anymore.  She's a force of nature.\n\n     Trying to get a grip on Anna's words, Hawk lets himself\n     be escorted to another stand before the gold machine that\n     has the two complex crystal parts and the weird mirror.\n\n                              MINERVA\n               If you pull this off, I can't\n               promise I won't kill you.  I mean,\n               who we trying to kid?  But I will\n               spare the Flying Nun here....\n\n                              HAWK\n               And to think I thought you were\n               Evil Incarnate in pumps.\n\n                              MINERVA\n               I killed some lovable working\n               class Italian-diabetic, but you\n               killed the most significant male\n               figure of the decade and a kind,\n               gentle lover.  So don't play with\n               me.\n\n     Minerva flicks a switch on the stand Anna's handcuffed\n     to.  Anna vibrates, being electrocuted.\n\n                              HAWK\n               Okay, fine!\n\n     Minerva switches it off.  Giving himself a head rub, Hawk\n     bears down on the three oddly malleable objects.  He\n     TANGLES and BENDS and with a loud SNAP, puts them\n     together, forming the Crystal from the opening scene.\n     Minerva snatches it from him and puts on a head-set.\n\n                              MINERVA\n               Oh Hawk, don't ever change.  Go,\n               team, go!\n\n     Minerva giddily sets the crystal in the same place as Da\n     Vinci had it in his machine.\n\n     Using a long steel pole, Technician One adjusts a myriad\n     of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with a series\n     of lenses culminating on the top of the machine.\n\n     Technicians Two (black-eyed) and Three pour various\n     chemical powders and liquids into corresponding compart-\n     ments on the machine, beautifully decorated by the\n     chemical's zodiac sign.\n\n     Alfred places a lead bar in its proper place.\n\n     Hawk glides to Anna and undoes her handcuff.\n\n                              HAWK\n               I hope you know what....\n\n                              ANNA\n               Trust Leonardo....\n\n                              HAWK\n               Wha.....\n\n     Anna puts her fingers on his lips.\n\n     Minerva throws a lever.  Steam begins to percolate from\n     the furnace towards the machine.\n\n                              MINERVA\n                       (into the headset)\n               We're for real.\n\n     THE MACHINE\n\n     begins to rotate, at first clunkily, then faster.\n     The Crystal rotates comfortably in its compartment.\n\n     The machine throws out its folding arms, each with an\n     element.  The arms click higher.\n\n     The goggled technicians stand before a time-coded video\n     monitor, taking notes.\n\n     The chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to\n     spill and drop through brass tubes.\n\n     ANNA\n\n     murmurs to Hawk.\n\n                              ANNA\n               Da Vinci made the real directions\n               in a secret script that I decoded.\n               The way the machine is running\n               now, the gold will produce too\n               quickly, clog, and the machine\n               will shut itself down.  Isn't it\n               wonderful?\n\n                              HAWK\n               Yeah, but what would happen if that\n               little mirror came out of the\n               crystal.\n\n                              ANNA\n               Wha -- you don't want to know...\n\n     Hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket.\n\n                              HAWK\n               I wanna know...\n\n                              ANNA\n               Holy sh-h--things are going to\n               get very interesting, very fast.\n               Da Vinci would be proud of you.\n\n     IN THE MACHINE\n\n     The chemicals snake down their individual paths to the\n     Lead Bar spinning its trough.  There's a FLASH and a\n     controlled but jarring explosion.\n\n     EVERYONE\n\n     doubletakes.  Hawk reaches down to the six foot steel\n     pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three\n     deep in concentration Technicians to the ground.\n\n     Oblivious to the violence behind her, Minerva, pulling\n     on goggles over her head-set, moves closer with a\n     religious purr.\n\n     THE MACHINE\n\n     triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around\n     the mirrors faster and faster, circling the room.\n\n     OUTSIDE THE MACHINE\n\n     Hawk and Anna squint, blinded.  Flinging off her goggles,\n     A literally beaming Minerva giggles forward.\n\n     THE MACHINE\n\n     Beams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into\n     the innards of the machine with a mighty roar!\n\n     MINERVA\n\n     sees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and\n     molten.  She moves closer, shouting into her head-set.\n\n                              MINERVA\n               Eureka, motherfuckers!\n\n     The machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive\n     pace.\n\n     Hawk's voice suddenly comes on Minerva's head-set.\n\n                              HAWK'S VOICE (head-set)\n               Minnie, hate to interrupt your\n               orgasm, but....\n\n     HAWK AND ANNA\n\n     stand above the unconscious Technicians.  Hawk is on\n     head-set.\n\n                              HAWK\n               Me, Anna, and Leonardo just wanna\n               say you got the Midas touch, baby...\n\n     MACHINE\n\n     Minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion.\n\n     The center of the machine blows.  The pool of molten gold\n     rockets at the viewer.\n\n     Mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls.\n\n     Minerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to\n     say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her\n     face.  It bubbles and cascades, turning her into a\n     bizarrely beautiful echo of Nefertiti.\n\n     HAWK AND ANNA\n\n     turn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the\n     open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing Indian war\n     paint on his face and the words RULE BRITANNIA painted\n     on his chest, ALFRED!\n\n                              ALFRED\n               How.\n\n                              HAWK\n               You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss\n               is dead.  Her plan is over.\n\n                              ALFRED\n                       (strange voiced)\n               My plan is just beginning.  I'll\n               forgive you for denying me the\n               pleasure of slaughtering my\n               boorish employers, but I'm afraid\n               the birth of the new British\n               Empire can have no witnesses!\n\n                              HAWK\n               Ooh-kay...\n\n     Alfred rushes forward with a howl.  Hawk meets him\n     halfway.  They trade savage punches and then lock onto\n     each other's throats.\n\n     Anna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays\n     for forgiveness.  She aims steadily, and fires...\n\n     right into Hawk's arm.  This allows Alfred to knock him\n     back with a strong punch.\n\n                              ANNA\n               Sorry!\n\n     She fires again.  The bullet pings off Hawk's belt buckle.\n\n                              HAWK\n               Stop helping me!  Thou shalt not\n               kill!\n\n     Hawk's turning to chastize Anna, allows Alfred to kick\n     Hawk back against a wall.  Alfred lunges out with his\n     blade, hitting the wall off-angle.  Hawk yanks the shaft.\n     Alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on Hawk's\n     throat.\n\n     Gasping, Hawk looks to a rip in Alfred's shirt and sees\n     a hinge and lever on the shaft.  With an all or nothing\n     jerk, Hawk flicks the lever.  The shaft clicks on the\n     hinge.\n\n     Alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold\n     away from Hawk and suddenly it is Alfred's throat which\n     is caught in the V-shaped trap!  The momentum of the\n     sudden change makes Alfred stumble towards the wall until\n     the point of the \"V\" hits it--\n\n                              HAWK\n               Don't lose your head over this.\n\n     Hawk takes the six foot steel pole and gives a Babe Ruth\n     swing right onto the V.  The blades slam together and\n     POP ALFRED'S HEAD OFF, SENDING IT SCREAMING DISEMBODIED,\n     HIGH IN THE AIR.\n\n     ALFRED'S SCREAMING HEAD P.O.V.\n\n     Hawk and Anna are seen waving up to the viewer (Alfie's\n     head).\n\n                              HAWK\n               Excuse my crass American humor.\n\n     The machine thunders with another explosion.\n\n     THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP\n\n     Hawk and Anna rush into the Da Vinci workshop.  She\n     guiltily touches the surface wound on his arm.  He\n     delicately takes the gun from her and laughs until he\n     sees...\n\n     BUNNY THE DOG!! standing in the open mouth of the\n     workshop.  Anna turns to Hawk...\n\n                              ANNA\n               Allow me.\n\n     Anna confidently moves toward the dog until Bunny leaps\n     up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending\n     her crashing to the ground.\n\n     Hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun.\n\n     Bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing\n     Anna, blood gently starts to emerge.\n\n     Hawk can't get off a shot.  He throws down the gun in\n     exasperation.  It lands next to The Gadget that is\n     connected to the Tennis Ball Machine.  Hawk rushes\n     forward, picks up the gadget, turns the dial to Ten, and\n     then smiles sweetly toward the dog.\n\n                              HAWK\n               Oh Bunny, Ball-Ball.\n\n     Bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up\n     blood droplets drizzling from his mouth.\n\n     Hawk slams down on the gadget.\n\n     A tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine.\n\n     Bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force\n     of it sends him FLYING AND CRASHING out a window.\n\n     Hawk pulls up Anna as the machine completely EXPLODES.\n\n     A huge chunk of the roof THUDS before the workshop door.\n\n     Hawk suddenly looks off-camera and smiles.  Anna shakes\n     her head vigorously.  He pulls her out of the frame.\n\n     EXT. A VINCI COUNTRYSIDE TREE\n\n     A man awakens from a nap and pulls up his hat.  It is THE\n     TRAVELING JUGGLER WITH THE UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE.\n\n     He pulls his three red balls from a pouch on his mule.\n     He begins a stoic juggle when another loud BOOM sends him\n     to the ground.\n\n     EXT. OUTSIDE THE GRAND CASTLE--DAY\n\n     An explosion of steam and gas blows out the windows!\n     Debris frisbees toward the camera along with....\n\n     Anna, hanging on Hawk's waist, and Hawk, hanging from\n     the bar on DA VINCI'S BAT WINGED GLIDER.\n\n     The glider gracefully swooshes down through the castle -\n     through the glorious vista.\n\n     EXT. THE ROAD TO THE CASTLE\n\n     The glider floats to a perfect landing before the\n     Unforgettable Juggler.\n\n                             JUGGLER\n                         Che pazzo....\n\n     Hawk and Anna collect themselves and look up to the smoke\n     billowing castle.  They smile and gush in relief.  They\n     wrap arms around the confused but warming up Juggler and\n     laugh again.\n\n     A SMALL PIAZZA\n\n     The mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush\n     of dawn.  Hawk, Anna, and the unforgettable Juggler ride\n     atop it.\n\n     A WOMAN WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE moves to a cafe\n     table with a luminous smile.  She unfolds a table cloth\n     atop it and then mystically sets down two cappuccinos.\n\n     Hawk and Anna dismount, thank the Juggler, then cozy into\n     the table.\n\n                             HAWK\n               Have I ever told you the world is\n               beautiful...\n                       (semi-seductively)\n               I'd really like to play\n               Nintendo with you, or something...\n\n                             ANNA\n               Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking\n               with God.\n                       (smiling)\n               But you're a close second, tough\n               guy.  What is that smile?\n\n                             HAWK\n                       (broadly grinning)\n               I got my planet back.\n\n     Hawk puts on a pair of sunglasses that look exactly like\n     the ones Da Vinci wore in the opening and raises his cup.\n\n                             HAWK\n               The first one's for Alex.  Cheers.\n\n     The viewer's viewpoint moves into Hawk's lips having a\n     sip of that damn unmasculine European coffee.\n\n                                                FADE OUT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              THE END\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n         \n\n\n\n\nHudson Hawk\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Steven E. De Souza\u00a0\u00a0Daniel Waters\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Crime\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb", "summary": "Eddie \"Hudson Hawk\" Hawkins (Bruce Willis)\u2014\"Hudson Hawk\" is a nickname for the bracing winds off the Hudson River\u2014is a master burglar and safe-cracker, attempting to celebrate his first day of parole from prison with a cappuccino. Before he can get it, he is blackmailed by various entities, including his own parole officer, a minor Mafia family headed by the Mario Brothers, and the CIA into doing several dangerous art heists with his singing partner in crime, Tommy \"Five-Tone\" Messina (Danny Aiello).\nThe holders of the puppet strings turn out to be a \"psychotic American corporation\", Mayflower Industries, run by husband and wife Darwin (Richard E. Grant) and Minerva Mayflower (Sandra Bernhard) and their blade-slinging butler, Alfred (Donald Burton). The company, headquartered in the Esposizione Universale Roma, seeks to take over the world by reconstructing La Macchina dell'Oro, a machine purportedly invented by Leonardo da Vinci (Stefano Molinari) that converts lead into gold. A special assembly of crystals needed for the machine to function are hidden in a variety of Leonardo's artworks: the maquette of the Sforza, the Da Vinci Codex, and a scale model of DaVinci's helicopter design. Sister Anna Baragli (Andie MacDowell) is an operative for a secretive Vatican counter-espionage agency, which has arranged with the CIA to assist in the Roman portion of Hawk's mission, though apparently intending all along to foil the robbery at St. Peter's Basilica.\nThroughout the adventure, Hudson is foiled in attempts to drink a cappuccino. After blowing up an auctioneer to cover up the theft of the Sforza, the Mario Bros. take Hawk away in an ambulance. Hawk sticks syringes into Antony Mario's face and falls out of the ambulance on a gurney, and the Marios try to run him down with the ambulance as his gurney speeds along the highway. The brothers are killed when their driver, startled by the array of syringes in Antony's face, crashes the ambulance. Immediately afterwards, Hawk meets CIA head George Kaplan (James Coburn) and his CIA agents\u2013Snickers (Don Harvey), Kit Kat (David Caruso), Almond Joy (Lorraine Toussaint), and Butterfinger (Andrew Bryniarski)\u2013who take him to Darwin and Minerva Mayflower. Hawk successfully steals the Da Vinci Codex from another museum, but later refuses to steal the helicopter design. Tommy Five-Tone fakes his death so they can escape. They are discovered and attacked by the CIA Agents, and Kaplan reveals that he and his agents stole the piece, and unlike Tommy and Hudson, had no problem killing the guards. Hawk and Tommy cause Snickers and Almond Joy to be killed by their own explosive device, and they escape. Kit Kat and Butterfinger take Anna to the castle where the Macchina dell'Oro is being reconstructed.\nA showdown takes place at the castle between the remaining CIA agents, the Mayflowers, and the team of Hudson, Five-Tone, and Baragli. Kit Kat and Butterfinger are betrayed and killed by Minerva. Tommy fights Darwin and Alfred inside Darwin's speeding limo, and Hudson fights George Kaplan on the roof of the castle. Kaplan topples from the castle and lands of the roof of the limo. Alfred plants a bomb in the limo and escapes with Darwin; Tommy is trapped inside and Kaplan is hanging onto the hood. The bomb detonates as the limo speeds over a cliff. Darwin and Minerva force Hawk to put together the crystal powering the machine, but Hawk intentionally leaves out one small piece. When the Mayflowers activate the machine, it malfunctions and explodes, killing Minerva and Darwin. Hawk battles Alfred, using Alfred's own blades to decapitate him. Hawk and Baragli escape the castle and discover Tommy waiting for them at a cafe, having miraculously escaped death. Hawk finally gets to enjoy a cappuccino."}

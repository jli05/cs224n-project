CRASHING SURF.\r\n\r\n  The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand. He lies there.\r\n\r\n  A CHILD'S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE\r\n  BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat\r\n  a SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The Bearded\r\n  Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. He\r\n  COLLAPSES.\r\n\r\n  The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A\r\n  JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the\r\n  beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a\r\n  cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE.\r\n\r\n  INT. ELEGANT DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - LATER\r\n\r\n  The Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY\r\n  JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us.\r\n\r\n                     ATTENDANT\r\n               (in Japanese)\r\n           He was delirious.

SAME ELEGANT DINING ROOM - NIGHT (YEARS EARLIER)\r\n\r\nThe speaker, COBB, is 35, handsome, tailored. A young\r\nJapanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens.\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          A bacteria? A virus?\r\n\r\nCobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass-\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          An intestinal worm?\r\n\r\nSaito's fork pauses, mid-air. Cobb GRINS. A third man is at\r\nthe table- ARTHUR. He jumps in to save the pitch-\r\n\r\n                    ARTHUR\r\n          What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-\r\n\r\n                     COBB\r\n          An idea.\r\n\r\nSaito looks at Cobb, curious.\r\n                                                3.\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          Resilient, highly contagious. Once\r\n          an idea's taken hold in the brain\r\n          it's almost impossible to\r\n          eradicate. A person can cover it\r\n          up, ignore it- but it stays there.\r\n\r\n                    SAITO\r\n          But surely-to forget...?\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          Information, yes. But an idea?\r\n          Fully formed, understood? That\r\n          sticks...\r\n              (taps forehead)\r\n          In there, somewhere.\r\n\r\n                    SAITO\r\n          For someone like you to steal?\r\n\r\n                    ARTHUR\r\n          Yes. In the dream state, conscious\r\n          defenses are lowered and your\r\n          thoughts become vulnerable to\r\n          theft. It's called extraction.\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          But, Mr. Saito, we can train your\r\n          subconscious to defend itself from\r\n          even the most skilled extractor.\r\n\r\n                    SAITO\r\n          How can you do that?\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          Because I am the most skilled\r\n          extractor. I know how to search\r\n          your mind and find your secrets. I\r\n          know the tricks, and I can teach\r\n          them to your subconscious so that\r\n          even when you're asleep, your guard\r\n          is never down.\r\n\r\nCobb leans forwards. Holding Saito's gaze.\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          But if I'm going to help you, you\r\n          have to be completely open to me.\r\n          I'll need to know my way around\r\n          your thoughts better than your\r\n          wife, your analyst, anyone.\r\n              (gestures around)\r\n          If this is a dream and you've got a\r\n          safe full of secrets, I need to\r\n          know what's in that safe. For this\r\n          to work, you have to let me in.\r\n                                                            4.\r\n\r\nSaito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BODYGUARD\r\nopens double doors which give onto a LAVISH PARTY.\r\n\r\n                    SAITO\r\n          Gentlemen. Enjoy your evening as I\r\n          consider your proposal.\r\n\r\nThey watch Saito leave. Arthur turns to Cobb, worried-\r\n\r\n                      ARTHUR\r\n          He knows.\r\n\r\nCobb motions silence. A TREMOR starts, they steady their\r\nglasses, Cobb glances at his watch- THE SECOND HAND IS\r\nFROZEN.\r\n\r\n                    ARTHUR\r\n          What's going on up there?\r\n\r\nAnd we-\r\n\r\n                                                    CUT TO:\r\n\r\nFILTHY BATHROOM - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)\r\n\r\nCobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A STEAMING\r\nBATH. The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs\r\nlevel with the rim of the tub.\r\n\r\nA sweating man (40's) watches over Cobb. This is NASH. A\r\ndistant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room. Nash moves to the\r\nwindow, parts the curtains. Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVELOPING-WORLD\r\nCITY- the street filled with RIOTERS- SMASHING, BURNING.\r\n\r\nNash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tape holds\r\nTWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb's watch-\r\nTHE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY.\r\n\r\nNash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur's\r\nfeet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connect the\r\nbriefcase to Arthur's wrist.\r\n\r\nNash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where\r\nthey pass under the door to the bedroom. Through the crack of\r\nthe door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running to\r\nhis wrist. BOOM- a closer EXPLOSION, and we-\r\n\r\n                                                    CUT TO:\r\n\r\nINT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)\r\n\r\nNash, ASLEEP. Head ROCKING AGAINST THE WINDOW as the train\r\nBUMPS OVER A ROUGH PIECE OF TRACK.\r\n                                                           5.\r\n\r\nA Japanese Man, TODASHI (18) watches Nash nervously. He\r\nchecks Nash's wrist: TWO YELLOW TUBES CONNECT NASH WITH THREE\r\nOTHER SLEEPING MEN IN THE COMPARTMENT: COBB, ARTHUR, SAITO.\r\n\r\nTodashi checks his watch: THE SECOND HAND TICKS IN REAL TIME.\r\nAnother TRAIN PASSES in the opposite direction with a MIGHTY\r\nWHUMP- Todashi's eyes FLY to Nash's sleeping face-\r\n\r\nNASH JERKS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRAIN, and we-\r\n\r\n                                                     CUT TO:\r\n\r\nINT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nAnother EXPLOSION- Nash CHECKS the sleeping Cobb and we-\r\n\r\n                                                     CUT TO:\r\n\r\nEXT. ROOFTOP TERRACES, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT\r\n\r\nA LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE. Cobb and Arthur\r\nsteady themselves against the wooden rail. Several TILES and\r\npieces of MASONRY fall. Below them a BLACK SEA churns. Other\r\nGUESTS wander the massive terraces.\r\n\r\n                    ARTHUR\r\n          Saito knows. He's playing with us.\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          I can get it here. The\r\n          information's in the safe- he\r\n          looked right at it when I mentioned\r\n          secrets.\r\n\r\nArthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder.\r\n\r\n                    ARTHUR\r\n          What's she doing here, Cobb?\r\n\r\nCobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed,\r\nstaring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches her.\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          You just get to your room. I'll\r\n          take care of the rest.\r\n\r\n                    ARTHUR\r\n          See that you do. We're here to\r\n          work.\r\n\r\nArthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She nears Cobb.\r\nLooks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIR-\r\n\r\n                    MAL\r\n          If I jumped, would I survive?\r\n                                                           6.\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal,\r\n          why are you here?\r\n\r\nShe turns to look at him. Amused.\r\n\r\n                    MAL\r\n          I thought you might be missing\r\n          me...\r\n\r\nShe smiles. He leans in, mesmerized.\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          I am. But I can't trust you\r\n          anymore.\r\n\r\nShe stares up at him, inviting.\r\n\r\n                       MAL\r\n          So what?\r\n\r\nINT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\nMal sips champagne as she studies a painting by Francis\r\nBacon.\r\n\r\n                    MAL\r\n          Looks like Arthur's taste.\r\n\r\nCobb is looking down through the window at the GUARDS\r\npatrolling the castle at ground level.\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          Actually, Mr. Saito is partial to\r\n          postwar British painters.\r\n\r\nHe turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves.\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          Would you sit down?\r\n\r\nMal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingback chair.\r\nCobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneels\r\nat Mal's feet. She looks down at him.\r\n\r\n                       MAL\r\n          Tell me...\r\n\r\nCobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS.\r\n\r\n                    MAL\r\n          Do the children miss me?\r\n\r\nCobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal's\r\nankle. He looks up at her.\r\n                                                            7.\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          You can't imagine.\r\n\r\nMal looks away, uncomfortable. Cobb gets to his feet, letting\r\nout the rope as he moves back to the window.\r\n\r\n                    MAL\r\n          What're you doing?\r\n\r\nCobb tosses the rope out-\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          Getting some air.\r\n\r\nHe tugs on the rope, testing. The weight of the chair, with\r\nMal on it, holds.\r\n\r\n                    COBB\r\n          Stay seated. Please.\r\n\r\nAnd with that, he JUMPS. Mal considers the open window.\r\n\r\nEXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nCobb RAPPELS down the wall, darting past windows. He stops at\r\na particular one. Gets out a glass cutter-\r\n\r\nSuddenly he starts DROPPING-\r\n\r\nINT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nThe EMPTY CHAIR SLIDES across the floor- WEDGES under the\r\nwindow-\r\n\r\nEXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nCobb JOLTS to a stop 15 ft. lower. He looks up at the bedroom\r\nwindow. Shakes his head. Starts climbing back.\r\n\r\nINT. KITCHEN, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\nCobb drops silently from the window into the darkened\r\nkitchen. He pulls a PISTOL from his belt, screwing a SILENCER\r\nonto the barrel as he GLIDES across the room.\r\n\r\nINT. HALL, JAPANESE CASTLE-CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nCobb SLIPS through the shadows towards a GUARD stationed at\r\nthe head of a GRAND STAIRCASE...\r\n\r\nThe Guard HEARS something- TURNS- PEERS into the shadows...\r\n\r\nCobb FLASHES out of the shadows, silenced pistol up, AIMING-\r\n                                                          8.\r\n\r\nPHHT- head shot- the Guard starts to drop... but Cobb is\r\nalready there to CATCH him, sliding on his knees and lowering\r\nthe Guard SILENTLY to the floor.\r\n\r\nINT. DINING ROOM, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nCobb moves to a PAINTING. With practiced hands he removes it\r\nfrom the wall, revealing a SAFE. Cobb spins the dial, pulls\r\nit OPEN, GRABS an envelope from within, stuffs it into his\r\nwaistband, where there is already an IDENTICAL ENVELOPE.\r\n\r\nLIGHTS COME ON. Cobb freezes.\r\n\r\n                    SAITO (O.S.)\r\n          Turn around.\r\n\r\nCobb turns. At the far end of the room: Saito. Next to him is\r\nMal, gun in hand. She smiles at Cobb.\r\n\r\n                    MAL\r\n          The gun, Dom.\r\n\r\nCobb doesn't move. Mal motions outside- two GUARDS drag\r\nArthur into the room. Mal puts the gun to his head.\r\n\r\n                    MAL\r\n          Please.\r\n\r\nCobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table, then\r\nSLIDES it along the polished ebony. It comes to rest HALFWAY\r\ndown the length or the table.\r\n\r\n                    SAITO\r\n          Now the envelope, Mr. Cobb.\r\n\r\nCobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the\r\nenvelopes, SLIDES it along the table.

Their latest target is Japanese businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe). The extraction from Saito fails because of the memory of Cobb's wife Mal (Marion Cotillard). Saito reveals that he was actually auditioning the team to perform the difficult act of \"inception\": planting an idea in a person's subconscious.\nTo break up the energy conglomerate of ailing competitor Maurice Fischer (Pete Postlethwaite), Saito wants Cobb to cause Fischer's son and heir, Robert (Cillian Murphy) to dissolve his father's company. In return, Saito promises to use his influence to clear Cobb's murder charge, allowing Cobb to return home to his children. Cobb accepts the offer and sets about assembling his team: Eames (Tom Hardy), a conman and identity forger; Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a chemist who concocts a powerful sedative for a stable \"dream within a dream\" strategy; Ariadne (Ellen Page), an architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes, recruited with the help of Cobb's father-in-law, Professor Stephen Miles (Michael Caine). Saito accompanies the team to verify their success. When Ariadne shares a dream with Cobb, she learns that his subconscious recreates Mal, and she appears frequently in his dreams as a hostile force.\nWhen the elder Fischer dies in Sydney, Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a flight back to Los Angeles, which the team uses as an opportunity to approach him. Cobb sedates and brings Fischer into a shared dream with the extractors. At each level in the layered dreaming, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a \"kick\" that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members who have entered another dream layer deeper. The plan is for Yusuf to drive off a bridge in the first dream layer, Arthur to use the elevator in the second layer, and someone to create an explosion in the third layer simultaneously. While death in a dream would normally cause the dreamer to wake up, the sedatives used to stabilize the dreams would not allow that. Thus, death during the mission will result in entering \"Limbo\", an expanse of infinite raw subconscious from which it is very difficult to escape.\nIn the first dream layer, the team enter Yusuf's dream of a rainy Los Angeles. The team abducts Fischer, but he subconsciously creates a team of bodyguards who wound Saito. Eames impersonates Fischer's godfather, Peter Browning (Tom Berenger), to suggest Fischer reconsider his father's will. Yusuf drives the van, pursued by the bodyguards, as the rest (including Fischer) are sedated into the second level.\nIn the second layer, a hotel dreamed by Arthur, Cobb convinces Fischer that he is kidnapped by Browning and that Cobb is his subconscious protectors. Cob persuade him to go down another level to explore Browning's subconscious (whereas it is actually a ruse to enter Fischer's).\nThe third layer is a snowy mountain fortress dreamed by Eames. The team has to infiltrate it and hold off the guards as Cobb takes Fischer into the equivalent of his subconscious.\nYusuf, under pursuit in the first layer, accidentally drives off a bridge and initiates his kick too soon. This removes the gravity of Arthur's dream world and causes an avalanche in Eames' dream. Arthur is forced to improvise a new kick that synchronize with the van hitting the water. Cobb's projection of Mal kills Fischer, and Saito succumbs to his wounds; both fall into Limbo. While Eames sets up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives, Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to find Fischer and Saito.\nCobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to Limbo while experimenting with the dream-sharing technology. There, they spent fifty years constructing a world from their shared memories. When Mal refused to leave Limbo, Cobb implanted in her mind the idea that the world wasn't real, using a rudimentary form of Inception. As she woke up from the dream, Mal was still convinced that it wasn't the real world. In an attempt to \"wake up\" for real, Mal committed suicide, and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children in the care of Professor Miles.\nThrough his confession, Cobb attains catharsis, makes peace with his subconscious's creation of Mal and remains in Limbo to search for Saito. Ariadne finds Fischer and wakes him up with a kick. Fischer is revived at the mountain fortress, where he enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: a vision of his father telling him to be his own man. All team members other than Cobb and Saito ride the synchronized kicks back to reality: Ariadne jumps off a balcony in Limbo, Eames detonates the explosives in the fortress, Arthur blasts an elevator containing the team's sleeping bodies up an elevator shaft, and the van in Yusuf's dream hits the water. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo, reminding him of the agreement. The two wake up on the airplane, where the entire team and Robert Fischer have awakened.\nUpon arrival at Los Angeles Airport, Cobb passes the U.S. immigration checkpoint and his waiting father-in-law accompanies him to his children. Cobb spins his small top, a totem for verifying one's dream state, but leaves it spinning on the table to join his family in the garden."}

Seitz\n\n\n\n                                                            5.2.00\n\n\n\n\n             FADE IN:\n\n             On credit sequence...\n\n             AN ARM\n\n             stretched out.  Long, alabaster white.  Beautiful.  A WASH\n             CLOTH enters frame.  Starts washing the arm with long, tender\n             strokes. \n\n             A TUMBLE OF HAIR\n \n             thick and auburn.  Being gently washed.  \n\n             FINGERNAILS\n\n             being clipped with a shiny nail clipper.  Short.  Uniform.\n             Tidy.\n\n             EYEBROWS\n\n             brown with a touch of gold.  A BRUSH comes into view.\n             Brushes against the eyebrow hair, then back again.  Against.\n             Then back again.\n\n             PANTY-HOSE\n\n             pulled gingerly off a long leg.  Folded neatly.  The wash\n             cloth begins between the toes.  Warm, soapy water.\n\n             HAIR\n\n             now dry.  The HAND appears with a comb.  Pulls down through\n             the thick tresses.\n\n             It is only now that we see the hand is wearing a SURGICAL\n             GLOVE.\n\n             The gloved hand holds up the comb and pulls stray hairs from\n             it.  Places them in a big, clear, plastic bag.  In the bag we\n             see the panty-hose, a folded flower dress, the nail\n             clippings.\n\n             Goes back to combing.  Comes across a knot and yanks the comb\n             through.  The HEAD rolls over to us.  Her face is bruised,\n             her eyes blank.  She is lying on the floor.\n\n             Dead.\n\n             End of credit sequence.\n\n             INT. BUSH PLANE - THE KILBUCK MOUNTAINS, ALASKA - DAY\n\n             The loud THRUM of a bush plane.  We CLOSE ON a small, cloudy\n             window.  Through it we see an endless expanse of pine trees.\n\n                                 HAP (O.S.)\n                       Jesus.  Just look at all that.\n\n             PULL BACK to reveal HAP ECKHART and WILL DORMER sitting side\n             by side.  Hap's at the window.  Greying moustache, a little\n             pudgy, wearing a brown suit.  Holding a folded over Seattle\n             Times.\n\n                                 HAP (cont'd)\n                       I thought we had a population problem.\n                       Everyone should just move up here.\n                           (taps window)\n                       Just look at it, Will.\n\n             Will's eyes remain on the file on his lap.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       I don't need to look at it.\n\n             Will Dormer.  Tall, handsome, expensively tailored suit.\n             Snakeskin cowboy boots.  There's both a magnetism and a\n             distance to him.  An intense mixture.  Hap glances at him.\n     \n                                 HAP\n                       Nothing wrong with smelling the roses.\n\n             Will looks up.  We see the trace of a thick, ropy SCAR by his\n             Adam's apple.  There's tension between him and Hap, just\n             below the surface.  He taps the file.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       Tell that to her, partner.\n\n             ANGLE ON THE FILE\n\n             a stack of 8x10 PHOTOGRAPHS.  Of the dead girl.  Her eyes\n             puffed up from bruises.  The whites bloody.  Contusions along\n             her breasts and shoulders.\n\n                                 PILOT (O.S.)\n                       Detective?\n\n             The PILOT's looking back at Will.  Wearing a leather red\n             baron hat.\n\n                                 PILOT (cont'd)\n                       Better check your belts.  We'll be\n                       landing in about fifteen minutes.\n\n             Will nods.  The plane lurches.  The file falls to the floor\n             and the photographs scatter.  The pilot catches a glimpse of\n             them.  Looks at Will.\n\n             EXT. BUSH PLANE - CONTINUOUS\n\n             The small yellow plane veers left.  Clears a mountain top and\n             gives view to the spectacular Alaskan coastline.  The green\n             of the Bering sea, the blanket of pine trees, the jagged rock\n             of the beaches.  Enormous.\n\n\n             EXT. LANDING STRIP - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY\n\n             A SIGN swinging in the wind: Nightmute, Alaska.  Halibut\n             Fishing Capital of the World!\n\n             PULL BACK to reveal it hanging from the eave of a small,\n             corrugated building.  The \"airport.\"  Nothing else for miles\n             around.\n\n             A mud-splattered Jeep Cherokee pulls up next to it.  Brakes\n             SCREECHING.  A YOUNG WOMAN hops out.  About 23.  Petite with\n             short, brown hair.\n\n             Peers up at the sky.  Brightens at the sight of the BUSH\n             PLANE coming in for landing.  Smooths down her down vest.\n             Making sure the GOLD SHIELD on her belt's visible.  Nervous.\n             Excited.\n\n                                 OLD MAN (O.S.)\n                       Eleanor?\n\n             ELLIE BURR turns.  Shields her eyes from the sun.  An OLD MAN\n             hosing down the side of the building.\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       Hey, Mr. Angstrom!\n\n                                 MR. ANGSTROM\n                       What're you doing here?\n\n             Ellie puffs up.\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       Police business.\n\n                                 MR. ANGSTROM\n                       Police business?\n\n             The old man screws up his face, confused.  \n\n                                 MR. ANGSTROM (cont'd)\n                       Didn't you used to baby-sit for us? \n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       I don't babysit any more, Mr. Angstrom.\n                       Just made detective three weeks ago.\n\n             A CAT jumps down off the roof.  Angstrom sprays it.\n\n                                 MR. ANGSTROM\n                       Boy, Charlie must be short-handed down at\n                       the station.\n\n             Ellie, used to not being taken seriously.  Turns back to THE\n             ROAR of the bush plane as it taxis down the strip.  Coming to\n             a stop.  She hurries over as the door swings open and...\n\n             WILL DORMER steps down.  Slipping on his sunglasses.\n             Scanning the nothingness around him.  Spots the swinging\n             sign.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       \"Halibut fishing capital of the world.\"\n\n             Hap, right behind him.  Rubs his neck.\n\n                                 HAP\n                       This ought to be interesting.\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                           (over the engine)\n                       Detective Dormer!\n\n             They look down.  Ellie reaches up and takes Will's bag.  Then\n             his hand.  Shakes it vigorously.\n\n                                 ELLIE (cont'd)\n                       It's a huge honor to meet you!  Ellie\n                       Burr.  I'm here to take you to the\n                       station!\n\n             Will motions to Hap.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       My partner...\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       Detective Eckhart!  I know!  Welcome to\n                       Nightmute!\n\n             She leads them away from the plane.  Takes Will's briefcase.\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       I just want to say how incredible it is \n                       to have you working with us, Detective\n                       Dormer.  I've followed all your cases.\n                       Theodore Dineli, Frank and Casey\n                       Prud'homme, the Port Angeles shootings...\n\n             Opens the back of the Jeep.  Puts the bags inside.\n\n                                 ELLIE (cont'd)\n                       ...And especially the Leland Street\n                       Murders.  That was my case study at the\n                       Academy.\n\n             The Pilot walks by.  Taps her on the shoulder.\n\n                                 PILOT\n                       Tell your dad the game's gonna start late\n                       this week, Ellie.\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       Sure thing, Spence.\n\n             She looks back at Will.  Can't help but focus in on his scar.\n             Touches her own smooth neck.  In awe.\n\n                                 ELLIE (cont'd)\n                       That's where Ronald Langley cut you in\n                       the basement of his father's house on 325\n                       Leland, isn't it?\n\n             Will smiles, taken aback by this girl's exuberance.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       You did your homework, Officer.\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       Actually...\n\n             She throws a quick glance at Angstrom.  Out of ear-shot.\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       I just made detective three weeks ago.\n\n             EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY\n\n             The Cherokee parked next to a police car outside a plain, one-\n             storey building.  The Nightmute Police Department.  A totem\n             pole stands out front.\n\n                                 CHIEF NYBACK (O.S.)\n                       Will Dormer!\n\n             INT.

Not\n                       that I was ever a great detective.  But\n                       up here there's no Bureaucracy.  No\n                       Public Relations.

Especially on the Dobbs case...\n\n             Will flares up.  Struck a nerve.

We are\n                       nothing like Mike Flynn.  We did what we\n                       needed to do to make sure that son-of-\n                       bitch Dobbs paid for what he did.  And\n                       every bastard like him.  We say one word\n                       about it and every case we ever brought\n                       in is going to blow wide open and they'll\n                       all walk.  Every last one.

You grab on to\n                       something and you don't let it go.\n\n             He takes out a handkerchief.  Wipes his brow.\n\n                                 HAP\n                       I don't know if it's because you think\n                       it's the right thing to do or because\n                       your pride won't let you do anything\n                       else.  I can't tell any more.\n                           (steps back)\n                       But I can tell you one thing.  I'm\n                       getting too old for this cowboy cop\n                       stuff.  Breaking the rules.  Cleaning up\n                       messes.  We're a dying breed, Will.\n                       You're a dying breed.  I.A., the D.A.,\n                       all those reporters - they don't care\n                       what you did at Leland Street seven years\n                       ago.

It's\n             dark in his room, quiet.  Suddenly the shade on his window\n             quivers and SNAPS up, flooding the room with light.\n\n             Will's eyes pop open.  He rolls over to look at the clock:\n             3:15.  Squinting, he gets up and walks over to the window.\n             We can see the rest of his scar.  Runs down deep across his\n             sternum.\n\n             He yanks the shade back down.  It bucks, then settles.\n             Satisfied, Will returns to bed.  Plumps the pillow, pulls the\n             blanket up around him.  Closes his eyes.\n\n             The shade lurches halfway.  Then SNAPS back up.  Light pours\n             in.  Will's eyes open.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       You got to be kidding me.\n\n             EXT. STREET - NIGHTMUTE - DAY\n\n             Will jogs along in a Sonics sweatshirt, a ring of sweat\n             around his collar.  He looks out over the harbor.  Fishing\n             boats coming in with their early morning haul.  More halibut.\n             He checks his watch.  Slows to a walk.  Looks up and sees...\n\n             Ellie Burr standing on the front steps of the Pioneer Lodge.\n             Smiles.  Holds up some car keys.\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       Fred wants us to meet him at the\n                       Connell's.\n\n             INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY\n\n             Ellie driving.  A hula-girl, swinging from the rear-view\n             mirror.  Will in the passenger seat.

Looks out the window.\n             Nightmute's main street.  A line of shops.  Undistinguished\n             Town Hall.  Elementary school up on a hill.  Sign out front:\n             Sign-ups for Midnight Little League!\n\n                                 WILL (cont'd)\n                       What kind of calls you get around here?\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       Oh.  You know.  Small-time stuff.\n                       Nothing like what you must get.  Mostly\n                       drinking-related problems.  Domestic\n                       abuse.  Barroom fights.  Stuff like that.\n\n             She shifts down.  Takes a steep turn.\n\n                                 ELLIE (cont'd)\n                       In the summer months it's pretty quiet.\n                       That's when there's work out on the\n                       boats.  The rest of the year, though...\n\n             They pass a MAN walking along the road.  Gnarled walking\n             stick.  Ellie calls out the window.\n\n                                 ELLIE (cont'd)\n                       Hey, there, Joe!\n\n             JOE waves.

Small oversights.\n                       People give themselves away in a traffic\n                       violation just as much as they do in a\n                       murder case.

Presses it to the gaping wound...\n             trying to stop the bleeding...warm blood, pumping into the\n             water...\n\n             Ellie watches.  Horrified.  Fred races over to the body.\n             Feels for Hap's pulse.\n\n                                 FRED\n                       Dormer...\n\n             Will, shaking Hap again.  Jaw set.  Eyes intense.  Veins\n             popping up along his temples.  Fred catches his shoulder.\n\n                                 FRED (cont'd)\n                       Dormer!  He's gone.\n\n             Will looks up at Fred.  His face contorts.\n\n             Suddenly leaps to his feet.  Grabs a rock and hurls it\n             savagely into the thick fog.\n\n             INT. CHIEF CHARLES NYBACK'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n             Chief Nyback sits in his chair.  Fingers interlaced.  A \n             somber expression on his face.\n\n                                 CHIEF NYBACK\n                       And then you lost him.\n\n             Will sits opposite him.  Wet, dishevelled, dirty.  Hap's\n             blood smeared all over his shirt.  Staring off into space.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       And then I lost him.  In the fog.\n\n                                 CHIEF NYBACK\n                       About how long 'til you heard the\n                       suspect's second shot?\n\n             Will, hesitates.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       Twenty, thirty seconds.  I followed the\n                       sound down to the water.  That's where...\n\n             He blinks.  Looks down.  Swallows.\n\n                                 WILL (cont'd)\n                       That's where I found Hap.\n\n             Nyback sighs, shakes his head.  Reaches down to his bottom\n             drawer and pulls out a bottle of bourbon and a glass.\n\n                                 CHIEF NYBACK\n                       I think you need a glass of this.\n\n             He goes to unscrew the bottle, but Will shakes his head.\n             Stands.  Paces.  Rakes his hand through his hair.\n\n             Turns suddenly and swipes his arm across Nyback's desk.\n             Everything CRASHES to the floor.\n\n                                 WILL\n                           (yells)\n                       Why didn't I know about that goddamn\n                       tunnel, Charlie?\n\n             Nyback looks up at him.  Calm.\n\n                                 CHIEF NYBACK\n                       There's a bunch of those tunnels out\n                       there, Will.  From bunkers over sixty\n                       years old.  I don't even know half of\n                       them myself, and I grew up here.\n\n             Will clenches his fists.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       I had him, Charlie.  Right in front of\n                       me.  Not two feet.  I could smell the son-\n                       of-a-bitch.  Playing with me.  And I\n                       missed the shot.  He was right there and\n                       I missed the shot!  Then my goddamned gun\n                       jammed...\n\n             Nyback gets up.  Limps over to his old friend.\n\n                                 CHIEF NYBACK\n                       Will, you can't blame yourself.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       I had him!\n\n                                 CHIEF NYBACK\n                       It's only gonna make you crazy.\n\n             Just then there's a soft KNOCK on the door.  The men look\n             over.  Ellie sticks her head in.  Speaks in a tone that\n             belies that a man has recently died.\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       You wanted to see me?\n\n             Will turns his back to her.  Nyback heads over.\n\n                                 CHIEF NYBACK\n                       Right, Ellie.\n\n             Ellie flicks a look at the pile on the floor.  At Will's\n             back.\n\n                                 CHIEF NYBACK (cont'd)\n                       I want you to take care of the\n                       investigation into Detective Eckhart's\n                       shooting.\n\n             Ellie looks at him.  Confused.  Lowers her voice.\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       But what about the Connell case?  I'm on\n                       the Connell case.\n\n             Nyback puts a hand on her shoulder.\n\n                                 CHIEF NYBACK\n                       We need paperwork, Ellie.  You know that.\n                       Just write up a quick report.\n\n             Ellie's shoulders droop.  Thought she was playing with the\n             big boys.  Just then Will turns abruptly and grabs his coat.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       I'm going to check on the roadblocks...\n\n             Nyback catches his arm.\n\n                                 CHIEF NYBACK\n                       You're no good right now, Will.  Go back\n                       to the Lodge.  Try to get some rest.\n\n             Will looks at him.  Know's he's right.\n\n             EXT. ROAD - NIGHTMUTE - DAY\n\n             CLOSE ON a SQUEALING tire, ripping around a curve...\n\n             INT./EXT. SILVER JEEP CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS\n\n             Will driving.  Speeding.  Scenery whipping past the window.\n             His hands, tight around the steering wheel.  The hula-girl,\n             dancing beneath the rear view mirror, a smile plastered to\n             her face.\n\n             He grows suddenly pale.  Pulls the Cherokee off to the side.\n\n             EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS\n\n             Will jumps out of the Cherokee, leaving the door open.  Runs\n             down an ALLEY behind a row of shops.\n\n             INT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS\n\n             A couple industrial trash bins.  Will leans his hand against\n             the wall and vomits.  Hovers for a moment, saliva dripping\n             from his mouth.  Braces himself.  Heaves again.  Hears a \n             BUZZING behind him.  Turns.\n\n             A DEAD DOG lying next to a dumpster.  FLIES buzzing around\n             its head.  Teeth bared.  Eyes wide open.\n\n             Like it's watching him.\n\n             INT. PIONEER LODGE - LATER\n\n             Will walks up to reception.  No one there.  Just wants his\n             key.  Rings the bell.  In the back room, he hears a RADIO.\n\n                                 RADIO\n                       ...earlier this evening after an aborted\n                       attempt to apprehend a suspect.  He was\n                       forty-five...\n\n             It clicks off abruptly.  Rachel appears in the doorway.\n             Takes in the blood on Will's shirt.\n\n                                 RACHEL\n                       I'm sorry about your partner.\n\n             Will looks at her.  She walks over to the desk.\n\n                                 RACHEL (cont'd)\n                       It's been on the radio for the last two\n                       hours.  Nothing but that.  Like when they\n                       found Kay Connell's body.\n                           (sympathetic smile)\n                       We're not used to this sort of thing up\n                       here.\n\n             She reaches for his key.\n\n                                 RACHEL (cont'd)\n                       He was standing right there just a couple\n                       of days ago.

He liked you.\n\n             He smiles faintly, turns to go.  Just then the phone RINGS.\n\n                                 RACHEL\n                           (answering)\n                       Pioneer Lodge?...\n                           (listens)\n                       Hold on a second.  He's right here.\n\n             Will stops.  Turns.  Rachel holds up the phone.  Covering the\n             mouthpiece.\n\n                                 RACHEL (cont'd)\n                       John Warfield.  He's called a couple of\n                       times.\n\n             Will's stomach drops.  That's the last phone call in the \n             world he wants to take.  Rachel reads his face.\n\n                                 RACHEL (cont'd)\n                       Want me to lie?\n\n             Will shakes his head.  Steps back and takes the phone.\n             Clears his throat.\n\n                                 WILL\n                           (into phone)\n                       Dormer.\n\n             PAUSE.

Not giving this asshole an inch.  Rachel, trying not\n             to listen.\n\n                                 WILL\n                           (into phone)\n                       That's not exactly how I'd put it.\n\n                                 WARFIELD'S VOICE (cont'd)\n                       No, no.  I suppose not.  But I look\n                       forward to reading the report.  Very\n                       sad.  Very sad.

Just that I felt Detective\n                       Eckhart and I, Hap and I, were starting\n                       to make a real connection before you\n                       left.  I sensed that he was ready to get\n                       some things off his chest.  Did you\n                       sense anything like that, Detective?  I\n                       mean, as his partner?...\n\n             Will, squeezing the phone cord with his bloody fist.\n\n                                 WARFIELD'S VOICE (cont'd)\n                       ...You were his partner for, what, about\n                       ten years?...\n\n             Will turns from Rachel.

An animal tracking its prey...\n\n             SUDDENLY a DARK FIGURE\n\n             flashes past.  Just inches away.  Playing with us.  Taunting\n             us.

The sound that woke him: the window\n             shade FLAPPING open.  LIGHT floods the room.\n\n             Will gets up.  Goes over to the shade and pulls it down.  It\n             lurches up halfway.  He tugs it down again.  It slaps all the\n             way open.  Will yanks it down so hard it rips off the window.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       Goddammit!\n\n             He gets tangled in it.\n\n                                 WILL (cont'd)\n                       Goddamned...thing!\n\n             Pulls it off and flings it in the corner.\n\n             INT.

Keeps\n             stepping on a SQUEAKY floorboard.\n\n             Slows near the ADJOINING DOOR that leads into Hap's room.\n             Hovers.  Lightly pushes the door open.  Sees...\n\n             THE PICTURES on the bedside table.  A WOMAN and three teenage\n             GIRLS.  Hap's family.\n\n             INT.

Starts to stretch the blanket across\n             the window.  Hesitates.  Looks outside.  To the left.  To the\n             right.  To see if anybody's out there.  If anybody's\n             watching.  Sees instead...\n\n             A LONE TUGBOAT chugging across the harbor.  Pulling a huge\n             freighter.  Will squeezes his eyes shut.

Bloody instruments on a stainless steel tray.\n             Walks towards the clipboard, eyes flicking over to the shape\n             under the sheet when...\n\n             SUDDENLY Hap's HAND drops down.

I don't have time for\n                       this shit.  Five feet, seven feet, twenty\n                       feet.  Put down whatever you want in your\n                       report, alright?\n\n             He turns the ignition.  Pulls out with a SQUEAL.  Ellie\n             steps back, watching him drive away.  More curious than\n             stung.\n\n             EXT. OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY\n\n             The Cherokee.  Parked off-road.  A remote spot by the water.\n             The driver's side door, left open.  The PING-PING-PING of the\n             interior BELL.\n\n             EXT. BREAKFRONT - DAY\n\n             Will Dormer, walking along a breakfront.  Aimless.  One foot\n             in front of the other.  Staring out at nothing.  The endless\n             sea.  Waves CRASHING.  Wind HOWLING.  Seagulls SCREECHING.\n\n             Everything.  Closing in on him...\n\n             He stumbles over a rock.  Grabs his head in his hands.\n\n             Stunned.  Guilty.  Ashamed.  Fucked.\n\n             He saw it.  He saw it!\n\n             A WAVE, explodes nearby.  Drenching him in sea spray.\n\n             Will turns, raking his hand across his face.  Blinking.  Eyes\n             stinging.  Trying to focus.  Trying to think this through...\n\n             Hears a dog BARKING in the distance.\n\n             Shakes his head.  Looks at his watch.\n\n             Got to deal with the problem at hand.\n\n             INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - DAY\n\n             Will, bursts into his room at the Lodge.

Crosses to the area of\n             the floor where Kay Connell's files are still spread out.\n\n             Starts pressing the floorboards with the toe of his boot.\n             Testing.  Testing.  Until...he finds the one that SQUEAKS.\n\n             Gets down on his knees.  Hesitates.  Then jams his fingers in\n             around the loose board.  Starts pulling it up.  Face\n             reddening.  Knuckles whitening.  Slips his hand into the gap.\n\n             Pulls out a muddy 357 RUGER.\n\n             The killer's gun.\n\n             Will, stares down at it.\n\n             INT. ALLEY - DAY\n\n             Will, standing at the mouth of the ALLEY.  Just like the\n             night before.  Steps inside.  Cautious.  Eyes darting.\n             Peering into the shadows for the HOMELESS MAN...\n\n             Not there.  Coast's clear.  Heads for the dumpster at the end \n             of the alley.  Shoves it aside.  Looks down at...\n\n             The DEAD DOG.  Rancid.  Rotting.  Will gags.  Holds a\n             handkerchief to his face.  Waving away the flies.\n\n             Then.  Pulls the 357 Ruger from his pocket.  Shrugs his coat\n             off and wraps it around his hand and the gun.  Looks away.\n             Fires a muffled SHOT into the dog's side.  The body kicks.\n\n             Crouches down.  Feels along the dog's ribs for the bullet's\n             point of entry.  Finds it.  Pulls out a PENKNIFE and extends\n             one of the blades.  Cuts into the gash, fingers probing deep\n             for the lodged bullet.  He finds it.  Pulls it out.\n\n             Looks back at the dog.  Takes a deep breath.  Wipes his brow.\n             A little smear of the dog's blood left on his forehead.\n             Turns and pulls a bottle of RUBBING ALCOHOL from his pocket. \n             Douses the bullet.  Cleaning it.  Glancing at his watch.\n             Running out of time...\n\n             EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY\n\n             The rear of the Nightmute PD building.

Glancing briefly\n             at the PICTURES hanging on the wall.  Of old time POLICE\n             OFFICERS.  Striking brave poses...\n\n             INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY\n\n             The storage room.  Hot.  Stifling.  The moose antlers LOOMING\n             over his shoulder.  Will pulls the evidence locker key from \n             his pocket.  Unlocks the padlock.  Swings the door open.\n\n             Pulls the Hap Eckhart envelope out.  Throwing a look over his\n             shoulder.  Opens it.  Shakes out the bullet that was lodged\n             in Hap's spine.  Then fishes a plastic bag from his pocket.\n             The bullet he shot into the dead dog.  Drops that into the\n             envelope and reseals it.  Hands shaking.\n\n             Something.  Catches the corner of his eye.  He turns.\n\n             HIS REFLECTION in the locker mirror.  The blood smear still\n             on his forehead.\n\n                                 FRED (O.S.)\n                       Dormer...\n\n             Will jumps.  Quickly wipes the smear off and turns.  Fred \n             Duggar standing behind him.  RICH by his side.  Will clears\n             his throat, shoves Hap's envelope into Fred's hand.  Then\n             Farrell's.  Angry.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       These should have gone out two hours ago.\n\n             SLAMS the locker door and brushes past him.

Tears\n             streaking her face.  Throws the carnation to the ground.\n\n                                 TANYA (cont'd)\n                       You happy now, you fucking bastard?\n\n             INT.

Not finding what he wants.  Then,\n             something catches his eye:  A BARGAIN BIN at the end of the \n             aisle.  Will limps down to it.  Avoides eye-contact with a\n             YOUNG WOMAN shelving \"New Arrivals!\"\n\n             Reaches into the bin.  Rummages through some paperbacks.\n             Then he finds it:  Otherwise Engaged by Walter Byrd.\n             Underneath the title, he finds what he's looking for:\n             Another J. Brody Mystery.  Flips to the inside of the cover.\n\n             A BLURRY PICTURE of Walter Byrd.  Head turned to the side.\n             Walter Byrd was born in Watson Lake, Canada.  He graduated...\n\n             Will's eyes skip down to the bottom:\n\n             Mr. Byrd currently lives in Umkumiut, Alaska, with his two\n             labrador retrievers, Lucy and Desi.\n\n             Will looks up.  Slaps the book closed.\n\n             INT./EXT. CHEROKEE - ROAD - DAY\n\n             Will drives, sipping take-out coffee.  Trying to fight the \n             stinging in his eyes.

DIAMOND TOOTH ROAD - UMKUMIUT - DAY\n\n             Sky's become overcast.  Will stands across the street from a\n             pale blue building.  On the ground floor, a tackle store.\n             Above, looks like several apartment units.\n\n             He starts across.\n\n             INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENTS - DAY\n\n             Will heads down a narrow hallway.  Tiled floor.  Passes door\n             \"A.\"  Stops at the next one, \"B.\"  Knocks.  Hears nothing but\n             the muted tv from apartment \"A.\"  Pulls out his gloves.\n\n             INT. WALTER BYRD'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n             With a CLICK the door swings open.  Will, gloves on, pockets\n             his credit card.  Hears the CHING CHING of dog collars as\n \n             TWO LABRADOR RETRIEVERS stand at attention, GROWLING.  Will's\n             prepared.  Takes a bag of treats from his pocket.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       Lucy.  Desi.\n\n             The dogs break.  Trot over to him.  Wolf down the treats.\n             Will scans the place.  Small, cheap.  Matching sofa and easy\n             chair, corduroy upholstery.  The walls, lined with old 1950s\n             movie posters.  All second-rate detective movies:  \"Another\n             Shot in the Dark,\" \"Lady Luck,\" \"He wore a Black Hat.\"\n\n             Will walks across the room.  Repulsed.  The pathetic hovel of \n             a killer.  Looks into the\n   \n             BEDROOM\n\n             Single bed.  Books and magazines.  A half-eaten tuna sandwich\n             on the bedside table.  \"NYPD BLUE\" calendar on the wall.\n\n             It's quiet.  He walks over to a large DESK by the window.\n             Scattered papers.  Computer.  Mini cassette recorder.\n     \n             On the wall, hundreds of newspaper articles.  Some yellowing,\n             some fresh.  All about cops: \"Officer Louis Saved My Life!\"\n             \"Shoot-out in Soho,\" \"South Street Cop Takes Down Drug\n             Ring,\" \"Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect...\"\n\n             Will curls his lip.  Starts looking through the papers on the\n             desk.  Underneath a stack, he finds an 8x10 PHOTOGRAPH.  It's\n             of Byrd, standing in front of a big, lakeside HOUSE.  A RADIO\n             TOWER in the background.  Walter Byrd's face is blurred,\n             turned to the side.  The photo from the book bio.\n\n             Will takes it.  Starts roughly opening drawers.  A box of\n             animal crackers, a rubber band ball.  Then, shoved in the\n             back of the top drawer, an APPOINTMENT BOOK.  Will flips\n             through to today's date.  Blank.  Shoves the book into his\n             pocket.  Slams the door closed.\n  \n             Then reaches back for his Smith 39/13.  Checks the magazine.\n             Slaps it back in place.  He's ready.\n\n             SUDDENLY the phone RINGS.  A beige rotary on the desk.\n             Plugged into an ancient answering machine.  It RINGS again.\n             The answering machine WHIRS.  Then BEEPS.\n\n                                 WALTER'S VOICE\n                       Now you're mad at me.\n\n             Will freezes.\n\n                                 WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd)\n                       ...I spotted your car around the corner.\n                       You must have been in a hurry.

HALLWAY - APARTMENTS - DAY\n\n             Will exits the apartment.  Cradling his hand.  Looks down at\n             the tile floor.  Scanning it for a broken tile.  Finds one.\n             Bends down and plucks out a broken corner.\n\n             Places it carefully where the bottom of the door meets the\n             door jamb.  Just then.

Ellie's\n             staring right at him - that isn't like him.\n\n             He turns back to Fred.  Beat.\n\n                                 WILL (cont'd)\n                       Well.  If he's local.  Give him a call.\n\n             The CLACKING resumes.\n\n             INT. STAIRWAY - DIAMOND TOOTH ROAD - UMKUMIUT - LATE NIGHT\n\n             A dark stairway.  Late at night.  Will, bathed in shadows.\n             Climbs to the top.  Quietly, carefully.  He heads down a\n             hallway.  We recognise it.  Back where Walter Byrd lives.\n \n             Will approaches apartment \"B.\"  Slowly pulls out his weapon.\n             Cocks it.  Waits a beat then swings out in front of the door.\n             Ready to fight.  Ready to confront.  Looks down...\n\n             Tile corner's still there.\n\n             INT./EXT. CHEROKEE - UMKUMIUT - NEXT DAY\n\n             CLOSE ON Walter Byrd's APPOINTMENT BOOK laying open.\n             Scrawled in pencil:  8:30.  Dr. Agee.\n\n             PULL BACK to reveal Will sitting in the parked Cherokee.  The\n             appointment book on the passenger seat.  Been there all night.\n\n             Insomnia.  Taking its toll.  His hair, no longer neatly\n             combed.  His face, pale and unshaven.  His eyes, dragged open\n             from fatigue.  Looks like the whole world's pulling him down.\n             Staring down the street at a\n   \n             BRICK BUILDING on the corner.  A placard by the front door:\n             Dr. Florence Agee, D.D.S.\n\n             Will checks his watch.  Rubs his eyes with the heels of his\n             hands.  Suddenly.  Something tells him to look up.\n\n             A MAN\n\n             in the distance, walking along the road.  Towards Dr. Agee's.\n             He's in his forties.  Short, shoulders sloped.  Wears a \n             beige, zip-up windbreaker, khakis, brown desert boots.\n\n             WALTER BYRD\n\n             has a bulky hearing aid in one ear.  Is looking down at the\n             road.  Glances up.\n\n             LOCKS EYES WITH WILL\n\n             Byrd, slows his pace.\n\n             Will, reaches for the door handle.\n\n             SUDDENLY\n\n             Byrd turns in the other direction, starts walking fast.\n\n             Will leaps out of the Cherokee and heads after him.\n\n             WALTER BYRD\n\n             his short legs pumping, spots a TOUR BUS across the road.\n             Veers over to it.\n\n             WILL\n\n             a runner's stride.  Weaves through PEOPLE.  Closing in on\n             Byrd.  Sees his plan.  Cuts across the road just as...\n\n             A PICK-UP\n\n             rounds the corner.  THUMP!  Broadsides him.  Will's pitched\n             up and over the hood.  Falls hard on the tarmac.  Dazed for a\n             second.  Blood, gushing from his forehead.  Hears the PICK-UP\n             DOOR open...FEET running over to him.\n\n                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                       Are you alright?  You popped out from\n                       nowhere!\n\n             More FEET running over.\n\n                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                       He okay?\n\n             Will opens his eyes.  Trying to focus.  Looks up and sees, in\n             the distance...WALTER BYRD getting on the tour bus.\n\n             Will struggles to his feet.  The OLD LADY who hit him,\n             wearing overalls.  Reaches out.\n\n                                 OLD LADY\n                       I don't think you should move.\n\n             Will stands, wavering.  Flashes her his badge.\n\n             INT./EXT. PICK-UP\n\n             The old lady rips along in the truck.  Will sits in the\n             passenger seat, a handkerchief to his forehead.  It's soaked\n             with blood.  The lady looks over.\n\n                                 OLD LADY\n                       You sure you're okay?\n\n                                 WILL\n                       I'm fine.\n\n                                 OLD LADY\n                       Careful not to bleed on my interior.\n\n             Will looks over at her.  Shifts in his seat.  Ouch.  Feels\n             like a couple cracked ribs.  Peers out the windshield at the\n             TOUR BUS a few cars ahead of them.\n\n             EXT. WINDY ROAD - CONTINUOUS\n\n             AERIAL VIEW of the pick-up tailing the tour bus.  A windy\n             coastal road.  Beyond it, a blanket of endless evergreens.\n\n             EXT. FERRY STATION - OUTSIDE UMKUMIUT - DAY\n\n             A FERRY at the end of the pier.  A small wooden booth for\n             selling tickets.  Beautiful, sweeping snow-capped mountains\n             on the other side of the bay.  Nothing else for miles around.\n\n             The pick-up pulls up next to the bus and a couple other cars.\n             Will jumps out.  Scans the area for Byrd.  Nothing.  Then,\n             sees the last few PEOPLE boarding the ferry.\n\n             INT. FERRY - MINUTES LATER\n\n             Ferry's getting pitched around in the roiling water.  Most\n             everyone is inside.  TOURISTS with throw-away cameras,\n             backpacks, anoraks, CHILDREN.  Some looking sea-sick in the\n             corner.\n\n             Will weaves through the crowd.  Eyes darting, searching.  The\n             ferry lurches to one side, the crowd sways, Will spots\n\n             WALTER BYRD standing by a window.\n\n             INT. WINDOW - FERRY\n\n             Walter holds on to the railing.  Looking at the view, the sea\n             spray.  Will comes up.  Stands next to him.  Cognizant of the\n             people around them.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       Walter Byrd.\n\n             Walter continues looking out the window.  That same stuffed-\n             nose voice.\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       When I was seven my mother and\n                       grandmother took me to Vancouver.  We\n                       were walking along the street one day\n                       when these two men ran past and snatched\n                       my grandmother's purse right from under\n                       her arm.  Right from under her arm.  That\n                       night a police officer came to our hotel \n                       room to ask us questions.  Stood the\n                       whole time.\n\n             The ferry pitches again.  Will grabs on to the railing.\n             Looking down at this little man.  Hate in his eyes.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       His uniform looked brand new.  His shoes\n                       and badge were polished, his billy club,\n                       his belt buckle.  All perfect.  He was\n                       like a soldier, but better.\n\n             Walter reaches up to blow his nose.  Will's eyes look on in\n             disgust - his knuckles are still red and swollen.  From\n             beating Kay Connell to death.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd) \n                       Made a huge impression on me.  His\n                       goodness.  Gave me an instant respect for\n                       the police.  I tried to become a cop when\n                       I left high school, but...\n\n             He points to his hearing-aid.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       Congenital problem.\n\n             The ferry's engine HUMS to a stop.  Walter smiles.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       Oh.  We're here.\n\n             EXT. GENDREAU GLACIER - DAY\n\n             Gendreau Glacier.  Spilling down between two huge mountains.\n             Enormous in its whiteness, its coldness, its silent power.\n\n             Will and Walter walk up its face, away from the other\n             tourists.  Walter leads the way.  Hands in his pockets.\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       You know this glacier moves a quarter of\n                       an inch every day?\n\n             He points off to the horizon.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       And on a clear day you can see all the\n                       way over to Newtok.  There's a beautiful\n                       aviary over there.  We can go sometime.\n\n             Will's lip curls.  Watching him.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       It's actually cool for this time of year.\n                       Normally the temperature runs about...\n\n             SUDDENLY Will lunges at him.  Walter's eyes widen in surprise\n             as he grabs him up by the collar.  Nose to nose.  Will barely\n             keeping control.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       You think this is a nice meeting we're \n                       having here?  Friendly?  Two people\n                       getting acquainted?\n                           (jerks him harder)\n                       You sick, coward, fuck.  I get up every\n                       morning of my life just to bring someone\n                       like you down.  Beating a seventeen year-\n                       old girl to death.  Washing her\n                       afterwards, cleaning her.  Make you feel\n                       like a real man?\n                           (tightens his grip)\n                       Huh?\n\n             Walter flounders.\n\n                                 WILL (cont'd)\n                       I outta end this right now.  Take a rock\n                       and smash your fucking skull in...\n\n             His jaws tense, nostrils flare.  Walter, red-faced,\n             sputtering...\n\n                                 WALTER \n                       I stood right behind you...I saw you look\n                       right into his eyes and shoot him...\n\n             Will clenches his teeth.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       ...Seattle's great hero.

I\n                       didn't know it was him!\n                           (shakes him hard)\n                       I didn't know it was him!\n\n             Just then a SHRIEK.  Will looks over\n\n             A COUPLE KIDS.  Further down the glacier.  Having a snowball\n             fight.\n\n             Will looks back at Walter.  Has to take it easy.  Shoves him\n             away in disgust.  Walter falls down onto the snow.  Dislodges  \n             his hearing aid.\n\n             Watches Will pace.  Head throbbing.  Ribs, screaming in pain.\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       Then why lie about it?\n\n             Walter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid.  Puts\n             it back around his ear.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       I mean, I'm all for bending the truth.\n                       That's what I do in my novels.  It's my \n                       trade you might say.  But why cover it\n                       up?\n\n             Gets up.  Brushes the snow from his butt.  Checks something\n             in his pocket.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       You don't have to tell me if you don't\n                       want to.  I'm sure you have some reason.\n                       Something noble.  I have faith in that.\n \n             Looks down at the kids.  Shakes his head.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       They should be bundled up better.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       What's your game, Byrd?\n\n             Walter turns back to him.\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       No game.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       The phone call.  The knapsack.\n\n             Walter shrugs.\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       I figured we're partners on this one.  I\n                       mean, after what I saw...\n\n             Will stops short.  Eyes burning.  It's all he can do not to\n             throttle this weed.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       Let's get one thing straight, Byrd.  We are\n                       partners on nothing.\n\n             Walter looks at him.  Scratches his head.\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       I research my novels.  I know the \n                       procedures.  You'd have cuffed me back at\n                       the ferry.  You'd have called for back-\n                       up, read me my rights, and gotten a\n                       search warrant for my apartment.  You're\n                       a well-respected detective.  There's\n                       no reason for you to be talking to me\n                       right now...\n\n             He takes out a handkerchief.  Blows his nose.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       ...except that we could help each other.\n\n             Will stares at him.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       So.  We're at an impasse.\n\n             Will runs his hands through his hair.  Half-crazed.  Heart\n             pounding.  Turns to watch...\n\n             THE KIDS down the glacier.  Making angels in the snow.  Their\n             GIGGLES carried along by the wind.\n\n             Will, squeezes his eyes shut.  Trapped.  About to defy every\n             instinct in his body.\n\n                                 WILL\n                           (sotto)\n                       You're going to get a phone call.\n\n             Walter steps up, tapping his hearing aid.\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       I'm sorry?\n\n                                 WILL\n                       I said you're going to get a phone call.\n\n                                 WALTER \n                           (perks up)\n                       Oh?\n\n                                 WILL\n                       Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of\n                       your books.\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       Thought you might find that.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       You're going to be brought in for\n                       questioning.\n\n             Walter smiles.

Thinking.\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       Okay.  Okay.  Brought in for questioning.\n                       Good.  I can write this.\n\n             JUST THEN the ferry blows its HORN.  Low and loud.  Walter\n             looks down at it.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       Ferry's leaving.\n\n             He starts down.  Will watches him pass, has no choice but to\n             follow.  Walter, going over the details in his head.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       Something to divert...\n\n             Snaps his fingers.

Will stops, grabbing his\n             side.  A PANG through his ribs.  Excruciating.  Calls out to\n             Walter.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       What do you mean \"wild card?\"\n\n             Walter looks back.

Walks back\n             to the stern.  Looks out at Will.  The HORN sounds again.\n\n             Walter, at the rail.  Smiles.  The ferry's engine, churning\n             up water.  Starting forward just as...\n\n             Walter takes a MINI CASSETTE RECORDER from his pocket.  Holds\n             it up for Will to see.\n\n             Will, on shore, sees it.  A cold flash ripping through his \n             body.  That motherfucker.  Bolts through some tourists\n             towards the ramp but...\n\n             A couple of GUYS are just pulling it in.  The Ticket Taker,\n             grabs his arm.\n\n                                 TICKET TAKER\n                           (to Will)\n                       Full up.\n\n             Will, jerks his arm away.  Stares off at the ferry.  Walter\n             Byrd and his tape recorder.  Receding into the distance.\n\n             INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY\n\n             CLOSE ON a counter top.  Stuff thrown down.  Aspirin.  Band-\n             aids.  Gauze.  Medical tape.  First aid cream.

CONVENIENCE STORE - MINUTES LATER\n\n             Will exits the store.  A bag under his arm.  We Miss You, Kay\n             looming over his shoulder.  Steps out onto the sidewalk and\n             sees...\n\n             ELLIE leaning against her truck.  Waiting for him.  Smiles.\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       Which way are you walking?\n\n             A tingle, all across Will's body.  Christ.  This girl's\n             everywhere!  He hunches into his coat.  Flicks up his collar.\n             Doesn't want her to see him fully.  Nods down the road.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       Back to the Lodge.\n\n             Ellie grabs her bag.  Joins him.

The death of his\n             partner.  Neatly typed.  Neatly stapled.  Pulls out a pen.\n\n                                 ELLIE (cont'd)\n                       Aren't you going to read it?\n\n                                 WILL\n                       I trust you.\n\n             He signs.

Said he was more than\n                       happy to cooperate.\n\n             Ellie looks over at Will as they cross the street.  Studying\n             his face.  His gait.  Noticing the slight limp in his right\n             leg.  The cut on his forehead.\n\n                                 ELLIE (cont'd)\n                       You haven't been sleeping much, have you,\n                       Detective Dormer?\n\n             They arrive at the stone steps of the Pioneer Lodge.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       Not really.\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       Isn't that the difference between a good\n                       cop and a bad cop?

Heads back into...\n\n             INT. WILL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n             ...his room.  Rachel follows.  Looks around at the mess.\n\n                                 RACHEL\n                       Are you alright?\n\n             Will grabs up a sweater.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       I'm fine.\n\n             He heads back over to the window.  Rachel now notices all the\n             stuff piled up.  Softens her voice.\n\n                                 RACHEL\n                       Did something happen?\n\n             Will.  Cramming the sweater into a crack.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       No.\n\n             Rachel walks up behind him.

Pathetic. \n             Pitiful.  Slowly turns to face Rachel.\n\n             Her eyes, looking up at him.  His shoulders droop.\n             Exhausted.  Rachel reaches up.  Catches him in her arms.\n             Strong arms.  Caring.  Will buries his face in her neck.\n             Wants to be swallowed up.\n\n             Rachel holds him.  Arms encircling.  Will breathes her in.\n             Sweet, soft, safe.\n\n             Looks up.  His mouth suddenly finding hers.  A kiss, hungry,\n             urgent.  His arms move to surround her.\n\n             INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATER\n\n             Will and Rachel in bed.  Spooning.  Rachel behind will, her\n             finger tracing his scar.  Rain DRUMS against the window.\n\n             Will.  Watching the raindrops streaming down the glass.\n             Casting strange shadows against the wall.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       There was this guy named Weston Dobbs.\n                       Twenty-four.  Worked as a part-time stock\n                       boy in a copy store.  Every morning he'd\n                       sit at the only window in his apartment\n                       and watch an eight year-old boy get\n                       picked up by his carpool across the\n                       street.  And every afternoon he'd watch\n                       the boy get dropped off again.  He did\n                       this for about six months.  Until one day\n                       he got up the nerve to cross the street\n                       and grab the boy before his carpool came.\n                       Kept him in his apartment for three days.\n                       Tortured him.  Raped him.  Made him do\n                       things...\n\n             Will tenses his jaw.  Rachel, listens in horror.\n\n                                 WILL (cont'd)\n                       When he was done, he got a rope and a\n                       kitchen stool and hanged the boy in the\n                       basement of the apartment building.  But\n                       he didn't do a good enough job.  The\n                       little boy's neck didn't break and he\n                       died from shock.  The landlord found him\n                       five days later.\n\n             Rachel reaches for Will's hand.  Squeezes it.\n\n                                 RACHEL\n                       One of your cases?\n\n                                 WILL\n                       Me and Hap.  A year and a half ago.  I\n                       knew the second I met Dobbs that he was\n                       guilty.  Smug, cold.  Dead eyes.  We had\n                       circumstantial evidence, but nothing to\n                       tie him to it.  Nothing concrete.  Went\n                       over every inch of that apartment.\n\n             He pauses.\n\n                                 RACHEL\n                       What happened?\n\n             Will turns slowly over to face her.  Her hair, splayed out on\n             the pillow.  Her cheeks, flushed.  Her eyes, listening.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       We took some blood samples from the boy's\n                       body and planted them in his apartment.\n                           (beat)\n                       Arrested him the next day.\n\n             Rachel looks at him.  Goose pimples on her arms.  Realising\n             the weight of the confession.\n\n                                 RACHEL\n                       Will.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       There've been other cases.  Where we've\n                       changed results.  Pushed witnesses.\n                       Manipulated evidence.\n                           (rubs his face)\n                       But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than\n                       anything.\n\n             He sits up.  Abrupt.  Wincing from the pain in his ribs.\n             Rests his arms on his knees.\n\n                                 RACHEL\n                       What if someone finds out?\n\n                                 WILL\n                       We're under investigation now.

Thought he could work out some\n                       kind of deal.\n\n             Rachel rubs his shoulder.\n\n                                 RACHEL\n                       Well, that's not going to happen now.\n\n             Will closes his eyes.  The rain, PATTERING.  Rhythmic.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       Do you think it was wrong?  What we did?\n\n             There's a PAUSE.

WILL'S ROOM - MORNING\n\n             The clock reads 6:00.  Will pulls on his trousers.  Goes to\n             strap on his Smith 39/13 holster.  Grimaces with pain.  Looks\n             at his back in the full-length mirror.  BLACK BRUISES seeping\n             out from under his bandage.\n\n             Puts the 39/13 and holster in the top drawer of the bureau.\n             Turns and looks down at Rachel.

Randy.\n\n             Fred, sits up.\n\n                                 FRED\n                       Randy Stetz?\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       That's right.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       What about him?\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       He.  Well, he...\n\n             Walter hesitates.  Takes a sip of coffee.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       I don't want to talk out of school.  Kay\n                       told me things in the strictest of\n                       confidence.  As a friend.\n\n                                 FRED\n                       Mr. Byrd.  Anything you can tell us could\n                       help out with this case.\n\n             Walter furrows his brow.  Taps his hearing aid.\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       Well.  He hit her.\n\n             Ellie's eyes widen.  Fred glances at Will.  But Will's too\n             busy watching this little man weave his web.\n\n                                 FRED\n                       Are you sure about that?\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       She'd come to me, sometimes in the middle\n                       of the night.  Bruises all over her back,\n                       her upper arms.  I pled with her to let\n                       me call the police, but she wouldn't hear\n                       it.  Wanted to keep it a secret.\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       Randy Stetz beat Kay Connell?\n\n                                 FRED\n                           (angry)\n                       Ellie.\n\n             Walter looks right at her.\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       He has a terrible rage.  Kay even said he\n                       carried a handgun around with him.\n\n             Fred stands.  This is big.  Calls out the door.\n\n                                 FRED\n                       Margaret!  Get Judge Biggs on the phone!\n                           (to Will)\n                       I'll get another warrant for Stetz's\n                       place.\n\n             Walter takes a sip of his coffee.  Cup's empty.  Holds it out\n             to Ellie.  Smiles.\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       Could I have some more coffee, Detective\n                       Burr?\n\n             Ellie nods, takes the cup.  Heads over to the coffee machine.\n             Fred turns back to the door...\n\n             AND AT THAT MOMENT Walter levels a look right at Will.\n\n             Mouths the words Wild Card.\n\n             A shiver down Will's spine.  Wild card.  The gun.  Randy.\n\n             ELLIE\n\n             over at the coffee machine.  Pouring coffee.  Glances up at\n             the window.  Catches the reflection of the two men.\n\n             An intense look between them.\n\n             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY\n\n             CLOSE ON a BOOT.  Jumping down onto a black rock.\n\n             PULL BACK to reveal Ellie walking out on the beach.  Heading\n             down towards the water.  Thinking.\n\n             INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - NIGHTMUTE - DAY\n\n             A dark, narrow boarding room.  A HAND reaches through an open\n             window.  Feels for the lock on the door.  CLICK.\n\n             Will enters Randy Stetz's place.  Cigarette butts, electric\n             guitar, Hustler centerfolds tacked on the walls.\n\n             He looks around.  Every inch of him revolting against what\n             he's about to do.\n\n             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - CONTINUOUS\n\n             The sound of waves.  A slight breeze.  Ellie walking along\n             the water.\n\n             Looking down.  Brow furrowed.  Stops and puts her hands on\n             her hips.\n\n             INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n             Will heads over to a hanging sheet on the other side of the\n             room.  Pulls it aside.  A MOTORBIKE being repaired.  Parts\n             and tools all over the place.\n\n             Pulls the 357 Ruger from his pocket with a handkerchief.\n             Spots a COFFEE CAN on a shelf.  Filled with thick oil.\n\n             EXT. ROCKY BEACH - CONTINUOUS\n\n             Something catches Ellie's eye.  GLINTING from between the\n             rocks.  She bends down.  Pulls a pencil from her backpack.\n             Spears something and holds it up.\n\n             A SHELL CASING.\n\n             INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n \n             Will, drops the 357 into the oil.  Turns and heads back\n             across the room.  Hesitates.  At the door.  Turns back.\n             Looking at the oil can.  Takes a step back towards it when he\n             hears...\n\n             The sound of a SQUAD CAR.  Pulling up outside.\n\n             Too late.\n\n             EXT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - LATER\n\n             Will stands just outside the doorway into Randy's room.\n             UNIFORMED OFFICERS inside searching the place.  Tearing down\n             pictures.  Turning out doors.  Ripping up carpet.  Randy's\n             voice.  In protest.\n\n                                 RANDY (O.S.)\n                       You can't fucking do this!\n\n             Will hears some SCUFFLING.  The sheet being pulled down.  The\n             CLATTER of tools.\n\n                                 RANDY (O.S.)\n                       Hey!  I'm working on that!\n\n             Parts pulled off the shelves.  The bike, shoved to the side.\n             Then.  A SILENCE.  Followed by...\n\n                                 OFFICER (O.S.)\n                       Found something.\n\n             Will shuts his eyes.  Heavy FOOTSTEPS head over to the bike.\n             Someone's pulled the gun from the can.\n\n                                 RANDY (O.S.)\n                       What the fuck is that!\n\n             Fred's voice, calm.\n\n                                 FRED (O.S.)\n                       That's it.  Let's bag it.\n\n             More FOOTSTEPS.  Randy, desperate.\n\n                                 RANDY (O.S.)\n                       That's not mine, man!  That's not mine!\n\n             Will opens his eyes.  Fred's voice.  Almost sympathetic.\n\n                                 FRED (O.S.)\n                       Randy...\n\n                                 RANDY (O.S.)\n                       No way, man!\n\n             More SCUFFLING.  A chair knocked over.  Something SMASHES.\n             Will looks down at the floor as\n\n             FRED AND A UNIFORMED COP struggle to drag Randy through the\n             doorway.  Randy writhes, kicks, tugs.  Screams.\n\n                                 RANDY (cont'd)\n                       That ain't mine!\n\n             Fred grabs Randy's shoulder.\n\n                                 FRED\n                       C'mon, Randy.\n\n             Randy squirms.  Turns.  Looks right into Will's eyes.  Gone\n             is the bluster.  Gone is the attitude.  Randy Stetz, lost\n             kid.  Tears streaming down his face.\n\n                                 RANDY\n                       I swear to God.  I didn't kill her.  I \n                       swear to God...\n\n             EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT - DAY\n\n             Will stands outside the garage apartment.  Wind whipping his\n             coat.  Watches as a Nightmute PD SQUAD CAR pulls off with\n             Randy Stetz in the back.\n\n             Fred sees him, heads over.\n\n                                 FRED\n                       You look like shit, cowboy.\n\n             Will shifts his eyes to him.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       That's an understatement.\n\n             Fred half-smiles.  Watches the receding squad car.\n\n                                 FRED\n                       Looks like we can wrap this one up.\n\n             Will barely nods.  Fred pulls his baseball cap on.\n\n                                 FRED (cont'd)\n                       We're getting together for a couple of\n                       beers later on.  Might not be the Seattle\n                       thing to do.  But you're welcome to come.\n\n             Fred puts out his hand to shake.  Truce.  Will looks at him.\n             Takes it.\n\n             INT. SHANTY BAR - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT\n\n             CLOSE ON a tray of dark beer.  Five glasses, foam sloshing.\n\n                                 FARRELL (O.S.)\n                       I can't believe it.  Randy Stetz.\n\n             PULL BACK to reveal Farrell, Rich, Francis, and Will sitting\n             at a small, round table.  Fred's passing out the beers.  Dive\n             bar.  MUSIC blaring.  3 a.m. Happy Hour! banner on the wall.\n             Place packed with rough-looking FISHERMEN.\n\n             Rich takes a glass from Fred.\n\n                                 RICH\n                       What do you mean, you can't believe it?\n\n                                 FRANCIS\n                       He was an asshole.\n\n                                 FARRELL\n                       That doesn't mean anything.\n\n             Fred sits.  Takes a sip of his beer.  To Farrell.\n\n                                 FRED\n                       Didn't you grow up with him?\n\n             Farrell shifts in his seat.\n\n                                 FARRELL\n                       Our dads were on the same boat.\n                           (to Will)\n                       We used to wait for them together.\n\n             Will nods.

Holds her gaze.  Then turns away.  Grabs the\n             side of the table.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       The case is closed, Ellie.\n                           (gets up)\n                       I got the next round.\n\n             The guys don't protest.  Will starts heading for the bar.\n             Weaving through broad shoulders, massive backs.  Smoke.\n             MUSIC.  Laughter.  Arguing.  A mass of bodies and sound.\n             Like being swallowed up in a black hole...\n\n             Looks back at the table.\n \n             Ellie, watching him.\n\n             EXT. ELLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n             Ellie's truck pulls up in front of a small house.  She jumps\n             out.  \n\n             INT. FRONT HALLWAY - HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n             SLAM!

An older MAN, Ellie's\n             father, appears in the doorway.  Thick glasses, grey stubble,\n             big paunch.  Wearing a flannel robe.\n\n                                 ELLIE'S DAD\n                       Ellie?

BASEMENT\n\n             Pitch black, then, CLICK! as a bare lightbulb's switched on.\n             Ellie stands beneath it.  Piles of crap everywhere.\n\n             She steps through the quagmire of old bikes, fans, auto\n             parts.  Over to a stack of cardboard BOXES in the corner.\n\n             She nudges through them, reading the writing on the tops.  In\n             thick black pen.  Shoves a couple aside.\n\n             Then.  Finds what she's looking for.  Pulls down a box\n             marked:  Ellie Acad.  Tears it open.\n\n             INSIDE - piles of papers, polaroids of her and her FRIENDS,\n             schedules, syllabi, handbooks.  Stuff from her Academy year.\n             At the bottom, a report.  The title:  \"Securing the Crime\n             Scene,\" the Leland Street Murders.  By Eleanor P. Burr.\n\n             Ellie pulls it out.  Sits down on an old stool.  Opens to the\n             middle of the report.  Her finger, tracing down the \n             typewritten page.  Flips to the next page.  Then the next.\n             The next.  Then.  She spots it.\n\n             THREE-QUARTERS DOWN THE PAGE, her finger finds the\n             sentence:...Detective Dormer's unregistered Smith and Wesson\n             model 39/13 9mm, to immobilize Langley...\n\n             Ellie looks up.  Chews her bottom lip.\n\n             EXT.

A stone\n             cupola with a bronze statue underneath.  The sky, black with\n             clouds.\n\n             INT. MARINER'S MEMORIAL - CONTINUOUS\n\n             Walter Byrd waits under the Mariner's Memorial.  Wind\n             whipping his jacket, the green sea churning behind him.  Next\n             to a fifteen-foot statue of a SEAMAN, tall, rugged, tough.\n             Holding on to a thick coil of rope.\n\n             Hunches against the wind.  Watches as...\n \n             WILL approaches the monument.  Sonics sweatshirt, wrinkled\n             coat.  Face drawn and haggard.

Rushes Walter.  Slams him against one of the\n             concrete pilasters.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       We do nothing well together.\n                           (SLAMS him again)\n                       Nothing!  You understand me?\n\n             Another wave CRASHES.  Sprays them.

That's okay.  I do that too.\n\n             He holds up the tape.  Will grabs it, shoves Walter to the\n             side.  Yanks the tape out of the cassette.  Steps back and\n             HURLS it into the sea.  Waves engulf it hungrily.\n\n             Walter watches him.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       You're not sleeping, are you?\n\n                                 WILL\n                       What the hell do you know?\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       Kay told me.

I told her to meet me at\n                       our special place.  The cabin at the\n                       beach...\n\n             A couple RAVENS alight nearby.  Flapping their wings.\n             SCREECHING into the wind.\n\n                                 WALTER (cont'd)\n                       ...When she came she was barefoot.

To touch her.\n                       She could have at least let me do that.\n                       Her skin...it was like everything I'd\n                       ever written about.\n\n             A dark shadow crosses his face.  Holds on to the coiled rope\n             of the statue.  Will hisses.\n\n                                 WILL\n                       Couldn't get it up, Walter?\n\n                                 WALTER\n                       It was when I went to kiss her.  She\n                       started laughing.  I got angry.  After\n                       all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with\n                       her.  I just wanted to make her stop.\n                       That's all.\n\n             Walter.

Gun cocked.  Eyes scanning.\n             Wind, bending the weeds, the trees.\n\n             BAM! a shot.  Out of nowhere.  Rips into his thigh.  Will\n             CRIES out.  BAM! a second shot.

Flesh wound.\n\n                                 ELLIE\n                       Shit!\n\n             Pulls herself over to a SIDEBOARD for cover.  Shrinks behind\n             it.  Notices\n\n             A PLASTIC BAG sticking out from one of the drawers.  Nudges\n             it open.

Old, rotted wood.  Crumbling beams.\n\n             Walter stands at a window.  Re-loading his shotgun.  He\n             fumbles, drops a shell.

Cautiously looks in...\n\n             WALTER at the far window.\n\n             Will jerks back.  Steps on the dock.  A plank CREAKS.

LAPD detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are sent to assist the local police with their investigation, at the request of police chief Nyback (Paul Dooley), an old colleague of Will's. Also, an intense Internal Affairs investigation in Los Angeles is about to put Dormer under the microscope. Eckhart reveals that Internal Affairs has offered him an immunity deal in exchange for his testimony regarding one of Dormer's past cases. Eckhart says that he has no choice but to accept the deal, to Dormer's frustration.\nDormer comes up with a plan to lure the murderer back to the scene of the crime. The attempt fails, however, and the suspect flees into the fog. The police chase, and the suspect shoots one through the leg. Dormer soon fires at a figure in the fog. On his way to the fallen figure, he picks up a .38 pistol the suspect has dropped. He then discovers that he has shot Eckhart. As he dies, Eckhart accuses Dormer of murdering him. Because of Eckhart's pending testimony against Dormer; Dormer knows that Internal Affairs will never believe the shooting was an accident. He tells his colleagues Eckhart was shot by the suspect. He doesn't mention he has the .38. Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), a young police officer, is put in charge of the investigation of Eckhart's shooting. Police find the bullet that sliced the first officer's leg, a .38 caliber. That night, Dormer walks to an alley and fires the .38 pistol into an animal carcass. He retrieves the bullet and cleans it, then visits the morgue. The staffer hands him the bagged bullet retrieved from Eckhart's body. She is unfamiliar with its type. He leaves and switches the bullet with one from the .38.\nOver the next few days, Dormer is plagued by insomnia, brought on by his guilt over killing Eckhart and further exacerbated by the perpetual daylight. He then starts receiving anonymous phone calls from the suspect, who claims to have witnessed Dormer kill his partner. The police are aware that Kay was a fan of a local crime writer named Walter Finch (Robin Williams) after looking through her belongings. Dormer looks up his address and breaks into his apartment. Finch soon comes home, realizes the police have arrived, and evades Dormer after a chase.\nDormer returns to Finch's apartment. While there, he plants the .38 to frame Finch. Finch later contacts him and arranges a meeting on a ferry. Finch wants help in shifting suspicion to Kay's abusive boyfriend Randy Stetz (Jonathan Jackson) and will stay silent about Dormer's role in the Eckhart shooting in return. Dormer gives advice on handling police questioning. After Finch leaves Dormer on the ferry, he shows the detective a tape recorder he used to record the conversation.\nFinch calls Dormer and tells him that Kay's death was \"an accident\"\u2014he beat her to death in a fit of rage after she rejected his advances. The next day, Finch, under Dormer's instruction, gives false testimony at the station. Yet he surprises the detective when he says Randy had a gun. Dormer realizes Finch discovered his plant and has hidden it at Randy's home. He races to Randy's house to find the gun before other officers, but is unsuccessful; Randy is arrested. Finch offers to give Burr letters indicating that Randy abused Kay, and asks her to come and collect evidence from his summer home the next day.\nBurr finds a 9mm shell casing at the scene, which conflicts with the bullet type found in Eckhart's body. She reads old case files from investigations Dormer was involved in and learns he has carried a 9mm, suspecting he has been lying about who shot Eckhart. Dormer confides in the hotel owner, Rachel Clement (Maura Tierney) about the Internal Affairs investigation: He fabricated evidence to help convict a pedophile he was certain was guilty of murdering a child, and who would have been set free if Eckhart had testified.\nDormer searches Finch\u2019s apartment for an address for his lake house, and realizes Finch intends to kill her after finding Kay's letters in the apartment. As Burr and Finch move through his house, Finch knocks Burr unconscious. Dormer reaches the cabin, but is too disoriented to fight off Finch from lack of sleep. Burr saves Dormer, while Finch escapes. Burr reveals she knows Dormer shot Eckhart. He admits it but says he is no longer certain if it was an accident. From his shed, Finch shoots at them, and Burr returns fire, allowing Dormer to sneak around to Finch's location. Finch and Dormer shoot each other, killing Finch and fatally wounding Dormer. Burr rushes to Dormer's aid and comforts him by affirming that Eckhart's shooting was accidental, then moves to throw away the shell casing evidence to preserve Dormer's secret. He stops Burr, telling her not to lose her way, before he dies."}

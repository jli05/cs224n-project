While some humans manage to survive in the wasteland, the majority of humanity resides in huge Mega-Cities with populations of tens of millions, where the traditional justice system has been replaced by a corps of Judges whose role combines those of police officer, judge, jury, and executioner. The most dedicated \"Street Judge\" in Mega-City One is Joseph Dredd (Sylvester Stallone), who assists rookie Judge Hershey (Diane Lane) in ending a block war. Herman \"Fergee\" Ferguson (Rob Schneider), a hacker recently released from prison, is caught in the firefight and hides inside a food dispensing robot, only to be arrested by Dredd and again sentenced to five years' imprisonment.\nRico (Armand Assante), a former Judge, escapes from prison with help of Judge Griffin (J\u00fcrgen Prochnow), and reclaims his Judge's uniform and \"Lawgiver\" gun as well as a decommissioned combat robot. A news reporter (Mitch Ryan) critical of Dredd is soon murdered, and Dredd is the chief suspect. Hershey acts as Dredd's defense lawyer in a trial before a tribunal of Council Judges including Dredd's mentor Chief Justice Fargo (Max von Sydow) and Griffon. Dredd is found guilty based on DNA evidence that matches the bullets used to kill the reporter to the unique identifiers of Dredd's Lawgiver.\nShocked by the possibility of Dredd being a murderer, Fargo steps down as Chief Justice, asking as his last request that the Council spare Dredd's life. Dredd is sentenced to life imprisonment while Fargo embarks on his \"long walk\", in which a retiring Judge ventures into the \"Cursed Earth\" (wasteland) \"to bring law to the lawless\". Griffin, who freed Rico to frame Dredd for the murder, becomes Chief Justice and instructs Rico to sow chaos throughout the city.\nDredd, along with Herman and other prisoners, are taken to the Aspen penal colony via airship. While passing over the Cursed Earth. the ship is shot down by the Angel Gang, a family of cannibalistic scavengers who capture Dredd and Herman. A squad of Judges track Dredd to the Angels' camp and a battle ensues. Fargo arrives just in time to save Dredd's life, but is mortally wounded by Mean Machine Angel (Chris Adamson). While dying, Fargo reveals that Dredd and Rico are the result of the Janus project, an experiment in genetic engineering intended to create the perfect Judge using DNA from Council Judges; Dredd deduces Rico framed him for the reporter's murder due to the similarity of their DNA. Fargo concludes that Griffin is trying to reactivate the Janus project, and begs Dredd to stop him before dying.\nIn Mega-City One, Rico creates panic by assassinating 108 Judges in two days. Griffin uses this to convince the Council Judges to unlock the Janus files, hoping to create an army of perfect Judges from his DNA to take control of Mega City-One. The other Judges agree, but soon change their minds when they realize what Janus could be used for. Before they can relock the files, Griffon has Rico kill the remaining Council Judges. Dredd and Herman sneak back into Mega-City and meet with Hershey, who had also discovered the Janus project through further investigation, and leads them to the Statue of Liberty where the Janus laboratories are, finding them protected by Rico's sentry robot. Rico betrays Griffin and replaces the DNA for the Janus clones with his own. Herman uses his hacking skills to save Dredd and Hershey from the robot. Rico orders his clones activated prematurely, but they fail to stop Dredd. Dredd pursues Rico to the top of the statue, and a final struggle sends Rico falling to his death. Central, the city's controlling supercomputer, has recorded the entire event and broadcasts the information, clearing Dredd's name. The remaining Judges ask him to become the new Chief Justice, but Dredd refuses and prefers to remain a street judge."}

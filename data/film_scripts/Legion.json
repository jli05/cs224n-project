Barren.   No signs of life.\n          A BLOOD RED SUN is sinking behind the distant mountains.    The\n          unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold.\n          A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE.    Solemn.   Weary.   Determined.\n\n                                WOMAN'S VOICE\n                      When I was a little girl, my mother\n                      would remind me each night before\n                      bed to be sure to open my heart to\n                      God, for he was kind, merciful and\n                      just. Things changed after my\n                      father left a few years later,\n                      leaving her to raise me and my\n                      brothers alone in a little place\n                      out on the edge of the Mojave\n                      Desert. She never talked about a\n                      kind and merciful God again.\n                      Instead she spoke of a prophecy.\n                      Of a time when all the world would\n                      be covered in darkness and the fate\n                      of Mankind would be decided. One\n                      night I finally got up the courage\n                      to ask my mother why God had\n                      changed, why was he mad at his\n                      children. \"I don't know,\" she\n                      said, tucking the covers around me,\n                      \"I guess he just got tired of all\n                      the bullshit.\"\n          And with these words the last trace of sunlight is SNUFFED\n          OUT, leaving us in:\n\n          DARKNESS...\n          A darkness filled with the sounds of SIRENS, GLASS\n          SHATTERING, SPORADIC GUNFIRE...a CITY FALLING INTO CHAOS.\n          TITLE:   \"Los Angeles, December 23rd - 1:02 a.m.\"\n\n          \n\n          A BLOOD RED MOON\n          reflected in a greasy puddle of water. Might just be the\n          smog that's making it that ominous color. Then we notice\n          something moving in the reflection. A dark shape, growing,\n          coming down at us fast. Beat...then WHAM!\n\n          TWO BLACK BOOTS\n          land hard in the water...and we're in:\n\n          \n\n                                                                      2.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - LATE NIGHT\n\n          A DARK FIGURE in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the\n          pavement, hands out to slow the impact. A beat then slowly\n          he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have\n          been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, shaved head,\n          deep-set eyes. Looks like he's been through one hell of a\n          fight.\n          His name, we will come to know, is MICHAEL.\n          He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick\n          walls above him. Where'd this guy jump from?\n          A RUMBLE of thunder...then RAIN starts to hammer down.   Seems\n          to motivate him.\n          Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes\n          toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the STREET just in\n          time to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS tearing around the corner,\n          SIRENS WAILING, heading this way.\n          He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash\n          dumpster, as the BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of the POLICE CARS whip\n          past.\n          Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a\n          MASSIVE ORNATE KNIFE from his jacket. Considers it grimly.\n          Runs his finger along its edge. Blood beads up. Razor\n          sharp.\n          Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare\n          chest underneath...and skin literally covered with DARK\n          TATOOS. Hard to see what they are in this light.\n          As his coat falls to the ground, we DRIFT over to the BRICK\n          WALL behind him where we see MICHAEL'S SHADOW crouch over,\n          and then...\n\n          ...TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK, STRETCHING UP INTO\n\n          WHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLY...THE SHADOW OF WINGS.\n          The RAIN POUNDS harder, as if punishment from the heavens.\n          The glint of the KNIFE coming down fast.\n\n          A HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE...\n\n          ...THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT...\n\n          ...FOLLOWED BY MICHAEL'S UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE\n          ALLEY WAY. And then SILENCE...\n\n          CLOSE ON THE GUTTER, AS BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW FREELY, MIXING,\n\n          SWIRLING WITH THE RAIN...\n\n          \n\n                                                                     3.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          EXT. CITY STREET - A SHORT WHILE LATER\n\n          Michael, face tight with pain, trench coat back on, steps out\n          of the alley, stares with determination at a dark storefront\n          across the street.\n\n          \"GUN & SPORT WORLD\"\n\n          \n\n          INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - A SHORT WHILE LATER\n\n          Cavernous. A Costco for survivalists.    Quiet except for the\n          sound of RAIN, then...\n          SMASH! Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a\n          shower of glass.\n\n          \n\n          INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\n          Michael bursts in. Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink.\n          His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the\n          fluorescent light, we get a better look at him.\n          His thin but stunningly well muscled body is TATTOOED\n          shoulder to ankle with INTRICATE WRITING. The man's flesh is\n          a living book. But the writing is in no language we\n          recognize.\n          He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two HORRIFICALLY\n          OPEN WOUNDS running down between both shoulder blades.\n\n          FRESH. BLOODY.\n          He threads a needle not with thread, but with FISHING WIRE,\n          and begins to STITCH the wounds closed. BLOOD POOLS on the\n          cement floor around his feet.\n\n          \n\n          INT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - MOMENTS LATER\n\n          Trench coat and a shirt back on, Michael races along the\n          ENDLESS RACKS OF GUNS, searching for just the right weapons,\n          his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life\n          for this.\n          Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags.\n          Whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big.\n          Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit.   Stops cold.\n          The place is locked up tight.   Metal gate over the front\n          doors, bars over the windows.   How the hell's he going to get\n          out of here?\n\n          \n\n                                                                         4.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          INT. LAPD SQUAD CAR - DRIVING - SAME\n\n          Two COPS, world weary, cruise through downtown. That's\n          BURTON behind the wheel, ESTEVEZ riding shotgun.\n          The POLICE RADIO is ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY.      Busy night.\n          Burton stares out at the city's rain soaked denizens with a\n          deep hatred, the shadows looming in doorways, the\n          streetwalkers.\n\n                              BURTON\n                    Goddamn' animals. Nights like this\n                    I wish I could take a match to this\n                    city just so I could watch all\n                    these motherfuckers burn.\n\n                              ESTEVEZ\n\n                        (LAUGHS)\n                    A good ol' boy barbecue, huh?\n          Burton doesn't even smile.       He's dead fucking serious.\n\n                              BURTON\n                    A fresh start. That's what this\n                    place needs.\n          He holds his finger up like a pistol. Aims it at the people\n          they pass, picking them off one by one.\n\n                                  BURTON\n                    Pow!   Pow!

Through the WINDSHIELD, we see a storefront EXPLODE\n          just ahead, raining fiery debris onto the squad car.\n          Burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time\n          to see...\n\n          \n\n          EXT.

Hands on your head!\n          In the distance, the POP-POP of GUNFIRE. The POLICE RADIO\n          CRACKLES with URGENT CHATTER. MANY VOICES TALKING AT ONCE.\n          \"Shots fired...Code Three...Officer down!\"\n          The cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused.\n\n                              MICHAEL\n                        (sensing their unease:)\n                    It's starting. There isn't much\n                    time.\n          The cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other -- \"what\n          the hell?\" -- then they turn back to Michael.\n\n                              BURTON\n                    Shut the fuck up and drop the bags\n                    now!\n          Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground.\n\n                              ESTEVEZ\n                    Hands on your head!

Turn the fuck around!\n          Michael slowly turns around.    Calm.\n          Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist,\n          FINGERS TIGHTENING. Michael closes his eyes, a terrible\n          decision made.\n          And that's when he moves, a fucking blur!\n          In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him\n          helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. Now it's\n          Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off\n          with Burton.\n          Burton struggles to find a shot, can't.\n\n                              BURTON\n                    Let `em go!\n\n          \n\n                                                                     6.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n                              ESTEVEZ\n                    Take the shot, Burton!\n\n                              BURTON\n                    I said let `em fuckin' g-g-g-g--\n          Suddenly Burton starts to SHAKE, the words stuck in his\n          throat like a skipping record.\n\n                               ESTEVEZ\n                    Burton!?\n          THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE, adding to the\n          confusion.\n          Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY\n          QUAKING, heels CLICKING the pavement, as if some massive\n          pressure were building inside him.\n          And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH\n\n          BEGINS TO TWIST INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY WIDE SMILE LIKE A BIZARRE\n\n          CLOWN!\n          His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force inside him now fully\n          in control.\n          Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice\n          GUTTURAL..INHUMAN.

Burton shoots his partner in the head. Estevez drops,\n          leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael's\n          faster, already FIRING back.\n          Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH!

Not much larger than the bed itself. He's got\n          shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight.\n\n          \n\n          EXT. DESERT - PRE-DAWN\n\n          A couple of ancient SILVERSTREAM TRAILERS are bathed in the\n          eerie blue light of night's final moments. It looks like the\n          trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in\n          decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the\n          trailers roof lines, marking the season.\n          One of the trailer doors CREAKS open and Jeep steps wearily\n          out into the cool western morning. Home.\n          Nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a\n          two lane HIGHWAY and a weather beaten TRUCK STOP DINER that\n          Jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours.\n          Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign\n          glows like a beacon in the darkness:\n\n          \"PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB\"\n          A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign.\n\n                              CHARLIE (O.S.)\n                    You okay, Jeep?\n          Jeep turns to see CHARLIE, a very pregnant girl of about\n          twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep\n          from her eyes.

PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAY\n\n          BOB HANSEN (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine\n          roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in\n          the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it.\n          The restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm\n          you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963. An old\n          plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and\n          tinsel occupies a lonely corner. Next to that, a faded\n          diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE. The kind you might order off\n          the Shopping Network.\n          Bob considers the TV with a frown. He deftly rolls an\n          ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine\n          stained fingers of his right hand. Must be a nervous habit.\n          You can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer\n          drinker.\n          Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is\n          cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed\n          dexterity. You do get pretty good at this sort of thing when\n          your other hand has long been replaced by a METAL HOOK.   The\n          dog tags around his neck tell the story. His white cook's\n          hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat.\n\n                              PERCY\n                    Lord as my witness, Bob, one of\n                    these days that thing's gonna hit\n                    you back.\n\n          WHACK!\n\n                              BOB\n                    Whaddya talkin' about, Percy? We\n                    got a special relationship here.\n\n          WHACK!\n\n                              PERCY\n                    Yeah, they got names for that kind\n                    a relationship.\n          The JUKEBOX on the other side of the diner starts up with the\n          MERLE HAGGARD tune \"I'M A LONESOME FUGITIVE\".\n          A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black hair\n          and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the\n          jukebox, swaying gently to the music. The headband doubling\n          as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that\n          really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. She's a\n          billboard of rebellion.\n\n                              SANDRA (O.S.)\n                    It's disgusting.\n\n          \n\n                                                                  11.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n                              HOWARD (O.S.)\n                    You're right. It is disgusting.\n          Watching the scintillating action from a booth across the\n          diner is a conservatively dressed SUBURBAN COUPLE. SANDRA\n          and HOWARD ANDERSON. Fish out of water.\n\n                              SANDRA\n                    Really, how can she go out in\n                    public wearing that?\n\n                              HOWARD\n                    I don't know.

Percy watches\n          the exchange discreetly from behind the counter. Loving it.\n          Howard turns back to his wife.   Rigid smile.\n\n                              HOWARD\n                    I feel satisfied with that answer.\n                    I really do.\n          Sandra buries her face in her hands.\n\n                              SANDRA\n                    I'm being punished for something, I\n                    know it.\n\n          \n\n                                                                    12.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Across the diner, Audrey goes back to swaying dreamily to the\n          music, which is suddenly overtaken by BASS BUMPIN' HIP-HOP.\n\n                                                              CUT TO:\n\n          \n\n          DRIFTING OVER A VAST EXPANSE OF WESTERN DESERT\n          The noontime sun bakes the strip of highway slicing through\n          this barren country.\n          A BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE blazes a path.   HEAVY BEATS thunder\n          from within.\n\n          \n\n          INT. ESCALADE - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS\n\n          The stereo in this rig could shake mountains. KYLE WILLIAMS\n          (late 20's) handsome as hell, thug style. A straight up bad\n          boy.\n          He passes a weathered road sign:\n\n          \"ENTERING PARADISE FALLS, NEXT SERVICES 50 MILES\"\n          Kyle's expression says this is not good news.\n          He grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat.   No signal.\n\n                              KYLE\n                    Shit...\n          He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead...\n\n          \n\n          EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS\n\n          The Escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the\n          lonely row of old gas pumps.\n          Kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. Now in\n          the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot.\n          Attached to the diner is a MECHANIC'S BAY. Grease stains and\n          rusty car parts litter the ground. Behind the place is the\n          SILVERSTREAM TRAILER we saw Jeep step out of earlier.\n          The only thing here that looks fairly new is the UHAUL TRUCK\n          parked in front of the garage with its hood up.\n          Kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and\n          flattens it out on the roof of the car. He spins it around.\n          Which way is north?\n\n          \n\n                                                                   13.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n                               KYLE\n                    Darren, your fuckin' directions\n                    suck, man.\n          He checks his cell phone again. No chance of a signal way\n          out here. So he shuffles around to the side of the diner in\n          search of a pay phone.\n          The good news is that he finds one.   The bad news is that\n          it's been broken for ten years.\n          Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing\n          a shabby, faded WAITRESS uniform stretched tight around her\n          very pregnant belly. Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look\n          is that cigarette dangling from her lips. The plastic name\n          tag pinned to her chest says \"CHARLIE\".\n\n                              KYLE\n                    Hey...\n          She eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag.\n\n                              KYLE\n                    You know that shit right there\n                    ain't good for the baby.\n          She lets out a long slow exhale.\n\n                              CHARLIE\n                    Guess I should think `bout quittin'\n                    then.\n\n                              KYLE\n                    Now hold on, girl, let me bum one\n                    before you do.\n\n                              CHARLIE\n                    You can buy a whole pack inside.\n\n                              KYLE\n                    Tell ya what.

It crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the\n          least.\n          Howard and Sandra exchange looks.    Creepy.\n          The door JINGLES and Jeep walks in. He heads straight for a\n          quiet huddle with Bob. All the while though, he keeps one\n          eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the\n          Andersons. Something about her...\n\n                              JEEP\n                    The carburetor's shot.    Don't know\n                    why.

More\n          FLIES begin to land on her body. On her food.\n          Charlie is still trying to wave them away.\n\n                              GLADYS\n                    That's too bad.\n\n                              CHARLIE\n                    No, I prefer it that way.

The Andersons turn to look as well.   Kyle\n          glances over from the counter.\n\n                              CHARLIE\n                    What did you just say?\n\n          \n\n                                                                    28.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n                              GLADYS\n                        (all smiles)\n                    I said your fucking baby's gonna\n                    burn.\n          Charlie shakes her head at the woman, not giving in.\n\n                              CHARLIE\n                    Go to hell, lady.\n          She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward\n          the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob.\n\n                              BOB\n                    What happened?\n\n                              CHARLIE\n                    Total fucking Jesus freak.\n          Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour\n          her meat. Red juice drips down her chin. The flies are\n          swarming now. How did so many get in here?\n          Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of\n          events.\n\n                              GLADYS\n                    All those babies.

Everybody in the diner is\n          now focused on the old lady.\n          Howard gets up from the booth.\n\n                              SANDRA\n                    Howard, it's okay!

From behind the counter, he\n          whips a heavy metal frying pan at Gladys that knocks her head\n          sideways. THWACK!\n          BONES BREAK AND BURST FROM HER NECK.   Impossibly, Gladys is\n          still standing.\n          She lets out an INHUMAN SCREAM and SCRAMBLES ACROSS THE\n          DINER, knocking tables and chairs over in her wake.\n          Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter.\n\n                              BOB\n                    Don't move!\n          But Gladys not only moves, SHE SCURRIES RIGHT UP THE FUCKING\n\n          WALL LIKE SOME KIND OF BIZARRE CRAB!\n          Bob can't believe his eyes. But he gets over it real fast,\n          as the crab lady rushes toward him -- ACROSS THE CEILING --\n\n          UPSIDE DOWN!\n          BOB PUMPS THE SHOTGUN, trying to take her down, but he can't\n          track her fast enough.

He's followed by Sandra\n          and Audrey.\n          Michael sees them, but offers no indication that he cares.\n\n          \n\n                                                                   40.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n                               PERCY\n                    Now, son, I'm sure you don't wanna\n                    go spillin' blood for no good\n                    reason in front of all these decent\n                    people, do ya?

He doesn't have\n                    a choice.\n          Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself. GLOCK 9s are tucked\n          everywhere they can go. Michael tosses clip belts to the\n          men. Boxes of shotgun shells. The works.\n\n                              MICHAEL\n                    If you want to live, you'll do\n                    exactly as I say.\n          He slams the trunk closed and approaches Charlie.

Trusting him\n          but not sure why.\n          Michael marches into the diner. Kyle glances quickly at the\n          others, then he bolts after Michael.\n          Percy follows.   Then Charlie.\n          Now it's only Jeep and his father left.\n\n                              BOB\n                    C'mon, Jeep.

A MAN WITH WINGS.\n          Jeep's eyes grow wide as the FIERCE ANGEL steps into the\n          diner. But this looks like no angel we've seen before.\n          This is a creature built for war. Rough hewn, battle\n          scarred. His body armor making him appear disturbingly\n          insect like. His wings are not feathery or gentle. Rather\n          they are hard, mechanical, an organic machine.\n          The angel's wings retract with clockwork-like precision.\n          And now that we see the his face clearly, we notice his\n          striking resemblance to Michael.

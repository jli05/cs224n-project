Everybody in the world \n\t\tis going to see!\n\n\t\t\t\tENRIQUE\n\t\tDonde vamos? [Where are we going?]\n\n\t\t\t\tMERCEDES\n\t\tA casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to \n\t\tbe a doctor on the other side.  \n\t\tGunshot wounds, fixing babies--if \n\t\tyou can pay he can handle it.\n\n\t\t\t\tENRIQUE\n\t\tSenora, anything it costs, I can \n\t\twork--\n\n\t\t\t\tMERCEDES\n\t\tDon't worry about it. He owes me \n\t\tsome favors.\n\n\tEnrique turns to ANSELMA still frightened in the rear of the\t\n\tstation wagon--\n\n\t\t\t\tENRIQUE\n\t\tSeas tranquila, mija.\n\t\t\t(Nods to Mercedes)\n\t\tEstamos en las manos de Senora Cruz. \n\t\t[Just relax, honey. We're in the \n\t\thands of Senora Cruz.]\n\n\tMercedes starts the car--\n\n\t\t\t\tMERCEDES\n\t\tIn English, Enrique. In English--\n\n\tINT. DEL'S HOUSE -- DINING  ROOM\n\n\tDel steps in. Chet sits at the table, drawing a cartoon in \n\tpanels. Del looks over his shoulder for a moment--\n\n\tCARTOON\n\n\tA tank rolling over barbed wire, cannon and machine gun \n\tblasting away--\n\n\t\t\t\tDEL (O.S.)\n\t\tHomework?\n\n\tDEL AND CHET\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\tI finished that. I'm just messing \n\t\taround.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEL\n\t\tTanks, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\tYou got to be in the Army, you might \n\t\tas well have something slick to drive.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEL\n\t\tSo you're going into the Army?\n\n\tChet looks at him, not in a good mood, then goes back to his\t\n\tdrawing--\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\tThat's the general plan, isn't it?\n\n\tDel watches for a long moment, thinking--\n\n\t\t\t\tDEL\n\t\t\t(Softly)\n\t\tThat's up to you.\n\n\tChet looks at his father again. All this is news to him--\n\n\t\t\t\tDEL\n\t\tThe Army isn't for everybody.\n\n\tChet can't quite believe he is hearing this. Del crosses to \n\tthe refrigerator--\n\n\t\t\t\tDEL\n\t\tNot that I don't think you'd be good \n\t\tat it, but--you know--I wouldn't be \n\t\tdisappointed if you decided to do \n\t\tsomething else with your life.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\tYou wouldn't?\n\n\t\t\t\tDEL\n\t\tNo.\n\n\tChet nods, begins to play again, considering the \n\tpossibilities. Del is making an effort and he doesn't have \n\tmuch practice--\n\n\t\t\t\tDEL\n\t\tHow's your room shaping up?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\tFine. I'm pretty much moved in.\n\n\t\t\t\tDEL\n\t\tGood.\n\n\tAn awkward silence--\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\t\t(Tentative)\n\t\tAre we going to ever see your father?\n\n\t\t\t\tDEL\n\t\tMy father.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\tYeah. He lives here, right?\n\n\t\t\t\tDEL\n\t\tHe does.\n\n\tDel pulls some food out, watching Chet as he draws--\n\n\t\t\t\tDEL\n\t\tMaybe we'll clean that thing out \n\t\tback up, have a barbecue next weekend. \n\t\tWe could invite him and his wife \n\t\tover.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\tCool.\n\n\tChet flips the page of his sketchbook--\n\n\t\t\t\tCHET\n\t\tHe makes his own sauce.\n\n\tEXT. PARKING LOT, BIG O'S -- NIGHT\n\n\tThe neon's off, but there are a couple cars in the lot and a \n\tlight within. Sam pulls into the lot, steps out, approaches \n\tthe door--\n\n\tINT. CLUB\n\n\tThe door opens. The place is empty now except for Otis, \n\tstanding behind the bar, deep in conversation with Hollis, \n\tsitting on a stool. Both swivel to look around guiltily as \n\tthey hear Sam step in--\n\n\tREVERSE\n\n\tSam walks in slowly, crossing the floor to bring us back to \n\tthe two men--\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tFellas.\n\n\t\t\t\tHOLLIS\n\t\tHey, Sam.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tOpen late.\n\n\t\t\t\tOTIS\n\t\tI'm not open. We were just talking.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tHollis probably told you we found \n\t\tCharley Wade.\n\n\t\t\t\tOTIS\n\t\tYeah. How about that? People start \n\t\tdigging holes in this county, there's \n\t\tno telling what'll come up.\n\n\tHe sits a few stools away from Hollis--\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tYou two saw it, didn't you? You two \n\t\tsaw it when Buddy killed him.\n\n\tHollis and 0tis look at each other--\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tImonna find out one way or the other.\n\n\t\t\t\tHOLLIS\n\t\tYour father had the finest sense of \n\t\tjustice of any man I ever met--\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tYeah, and my mother was a saint. For \n\t\tfifteen years the whole damn town \n\t\tknew he had another woman on the \n\t\tside. Stole ten thousand dollars to \n\t\tset her up in business. But hell, \n\t\twhat's that? You got a problem?  \n\t\tBuddy'll fix it. Facing some time in \n\t\tjail? Buddy'll knock half of it off--\n\t\tif you do what he says, when he says. \n\t\tYou got some business that's not \n\t\texactly legal? Talk to Buddy--\n\n\t\t\t\tHOLLIS\n\t\tBuddy Deeds--\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tBuddy Deeds was a murderer.\n\n\tHe looks at the two older men for a long moment--\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tThat night in the cafe--he didn't \n\t\tstay long after you left, did he, \n\t\tHollis? Maybe he decided he'd gone \n\t\ttoo far with Wade, maybe he figured \n\t\the better not wait for the Sheriff \n\t\tto get behind him. So he stepped out \n\t\tto see if he could catch up--and you \n\t\twere here at the club that night, \n\t\tweren't you, O?\n\n\tOtis sighs, begins to speak softly--\n\n\t\t\t\tOTIS\n\t\tI was here.\n\n\tCU OTIS\n\n\tHe turns to look toward the door as he reminisces, and we \n\tPAN away with his gaze--\n\n\t\t\t\tOTIS (O.S.)\n\t\tI'd been running a game on the side \n\t\tafter hours craps, draw poker on the \n\t\tweekends. Roderick didn't know about \n\t\tit. More important, Charley Wade \n\t\tdidn't know about it, 'cause I didn't \n\t\twant to cut him in. I suppose I'd \n\t\tbeen drinking some, and I was pretty \n\t\tfull of myself in those days--but \n\t\thell, I just didn't expect the man \n\t\tso early--\n\n\tSheriff Wade and Young Hollis step in the door and we are \n\tback in 1957. BLUES HARMONICA FADES UP, wailing from the \n\tjukebox. They stop and look at the place--\n\n\tTHEIR POV -- CLUB\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. The club is empty, dark. A LIGHT shines \n\tfrom the back room.\n\n\tINT. BACK ROOM\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Smoke fills the air and Young Otis sits \n\tback laughing, a large pile of money on the table in front \n\tof him. The other four BLACK MEN at the table aren't doing \n\tso well. One by one they all look up past the camera to the \n\tdoor--\n\n\tCU OTIS\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis doesn't see at first, engaged in \n\tdealing the cards. Finally, he senses the presence, looks up--\n\n\tWADE AND HOLLIS -- YOUNG O'S POV\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Wade stands over the table in the f.g., \n\tYoung Hollis hanging back in the doorway. Wade is smiling \n\this cold smile, cursing--\n\n\tCU YOUNG OTIS\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Trying to look unimpressed--\n\n\tEXTREME CU WADE'S EYES\n\n\tCold and unblinking. MUSIC CONTINUES--\n\n\tEXTREME CU WADE'S MOUTH\n\n\tTwisted in a snarl as he curses. MUSIC CONTINUES--\n\n\tMEN, TABLE\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. We shoot past Wade's body as the other men \n\tstep away from the table, grab their hats, and hurry out the \n\tside door. Young Otis is left sitting at the table. Wade \n\tstarts walking toward him--\n\n\tCU YOUNG OTIS\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. His eyes following as Wade comes to stand \n\tover him--\n\n\tWADE, YOUNG OTIS\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Wade grabs the table and violently jerks it \n\tover onto Young Otis, cards and money flying--\n\n\tYOUNG HOLLIS\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Watching squeamishly as Wade goes to work \n\ton young Otis, the overhead light swinging wildly--\n\n\tINT. BARROOM\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis is hurled out of the back room, \n\tface bruised and bleeding. Wade follows, then Young Hollis--\n\n\tCLOSER\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES.\n\n\tCLOSER\n\n\tWade puts his gun next to Young Otis's ear, cursing at him. \n\tYoung Otis gets to his feet, goes behind the bar--\n\n\tBAR COUNTER\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis slaps an envelope full of cash \n\tonto the counter--\n\n\tWADE\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. He waves his pistol, indicating something \n\tbehind Otis--\n\n\tINT. BAR\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. We shoot past Wade at the counter as Otis \n\tturns and reaches for a cigar box on the shelf behind--\n\n\tCIGAR BOX\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Lying open, an old pistol inside of it. \n\tYoung Otis reaches--\n\n\tCU YOUNG HOLLIS\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Frowning as he senses something wrong--\n\n\tWADE\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Wade levels his gun at Young Otis's back, \n\tthen turns to wink at Hollis like he did before he shot Eladio--\n\n\tWADE'S HAND\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Finger closing around the trigger of the \n\t.45--\n\n\tHOLLIS\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Mouth open in horror--\n\n\tWADE\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Eyes burning as he aims--\n\n\tBUDDY\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Stepping in the door, seeing, CALLS OUT--\n\n\tYOUNG OTIS\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Turning to see Buddy--\n\n\tWADE\n\n\tBLAM! THWAP! A bullet plows through his neck, knocking him \n\tback against the bar.\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. His gun falls from his hand--\n\n\tYOUNG OTIS\n\n\tHorrified, splattered with the Sheriff's blood. MUSIC \n\tCONTINUES--\n\n\tBAR COUNTER\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES. Twenty-dollar bills have spilled out of the \n\tenvelope and are soaking up blood--\n\n\tCU BUDDY\n\n\tCalm and hard-eyed. MUSIC CONTINUES. As he steps forward, we \n\tsee his pistol is still in its holster. He reaches out and \n\ttakes the .45 from Young Hollis's shaking hand, looks him in \n\tthe eye till Hollis looks back, then looks toward Young Otis--\n\n\tWe PAN with his gaze to a CLOSE-UP of Otis, back in the \n\tPRESENT. The MUSIC FADES--\n\n\t\t\t\tOTIS\n\t\tSheriff Charley had some real big \n\t\tfriends in politics then, and if the \n\t\ttruth come out it wasn't going to go \n\t\teasy on Hollis.\n\t\t\t(He shrugs)\n\t\tI don't know why I trusted Buddy \n\t\twith it--don't know why he trusted \n\t\tme. The first time I ever talked \n\t\twith him was right there, and then \n\t\twith a dead white man leakin' blood \n\t\ton the floor between us. He could \n\t\tcharm the scales off a rattler, Buddy \n\t\tDeeds.\n\n\tWIDER\n\n\tThis isn't what Sam was expecting. Hollis watches his face--\n\n\t\t\t\tHOLLIS\n\t\tThe three of us cleaned up and took \n\t\thim to the post and put him under. \n\t\tCan't say I was much help.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tAnd the ten thousand?\n\n\t\t\t\tHOLLIS\n\t\tWidow's benefits. He figured it would \n\t\tmake the disappearance look better, \n\t\tand that Mexican gal was just scrapin' \n\t\tby after Charley killed her man. \n\t\tThey didn't get hooked up till late--\n\n\t\t\t\tOTIS\n\t\tTime went on, people liked the story \n\t\tthat we told better than anything \n\t\tthe truth might have been.\n\n\tSam swivels around on his seat to took at the spot where \n\tCharley fell. He has a lot of information to deal with--\n\n\t\t\t\tHOLLIS\n\t\tWhat's the call, Sam?\n\n\tSam rolls it over in his mind before answering--\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tDon't think the Rangers are likely \n\t\tto find out any more than they  \n\t\talready have.\n\n\t\t\t\tHOLLIS\n\t\tWord gets out who that body was, \n\t\tpeople are gonna think Buddy done \n\t\tit.\n\n\tSam gets up--\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tBuddy's a goddamn legend. He can \n\t\thandle it.\n\n\tHe heads for the door--\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t'Night, fellas.\n\n\tHollis and Otis watch him go--\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t FADE OUT:\n\n\tEXT. DRIVE-IN, WIDE SHOT -- MORNING\n\n\tWe see Sam sitting on the hood of his car parked in the \n\tdeserted drive-in lot, staring up at the ruined screen. \n\tPilar's car rolls in, parks beside him--\n\n\tCLOSER\n\n\tPilar gets out, kisses Sam, sits by him on the hood--\n\n\t\t\t\tPILAR\n\t\tWhen's the picture start?\n\n\tSam looks at her for a moment--\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tYou gonna tell your mother we been \n\t\tseeing each other?\n\n\t\t\t\tPILAR\n\t\tShe'll figure it out sooner or later. \n\t\tI don't have to ask permission \n\t\tanymore, if that's what you mean.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tYou have any idea when your father \n\t\tdied?

It isn't \n\t\tfair--I don't believe this--\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tHe paid the hospital bill when you \n\t\twere born.

Martha Ronda, who loves Craden and runs the Austin newspaper, does not know Dev is anti-annexation when she and Craden host a number of senators at their home for dinner.

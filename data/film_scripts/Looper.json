EDGE OF CORN FIELDS - DAY\r\n\r\n          A pocket watch. Open. Ticking. Swinging from a chain.\r\n          Held by a young man named JOE in a clearing beside a Kansas\r\n          corn field. Sky pregnant with rain.\r\n          Waiting. He checks the watch, removes his earbud headphones,\r\n          stands.\r\n          Without much ceremony a BLOODIED MAN in a suit appears from\r\n          thin air, kneeling before the young man. Hands and feet\r\n          tied. Burlap sack over his head. Muffled screams, gagged.\r\n          With no hesitation Joe raises a squat gun and blows the man\r\n          apart with a single cough of a shot.\r\n\r\n                         LATER\r\n          Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck.\r\n          Cuts open the back of the body's jacket, revealing FOUR bars\r\n          of gold taped to the dead man's back. Joe takes them.\r\n\r\n          EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY\r\n\r\n          Massive, in the middle of nowhere. Black smoke.\r\n\r\n          JOE (V.O.)\r\n          Time travel has not yet been\r\n          invented. But twenty five years\r\n          from now it will be. Once the\r\n          technology exists, it will be\r\n          relatively cheap and available to\r\n          the public at large. And so. It\r\n          will be instantly outlawed, used\r\n          only in secret by the largest\r\n          criminal organizations. And then\r\n          only for a very specific purpose.\r\n          Joe drives up and parks his truck, removes the wrapped corpse\r\n          from the flatbed.\r\n\r\n          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          It's nearly impossible to dispose\r\n          of a body in the future. I'm told.\r\n          Tagging techniques, whatnot. So\r\n          when these future criminal\r\n          organizations in the future need\r\n          someone gone, they use specialized\r\n          assassins in our present, called\r\n          loopers.\r\n\r\n          INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY\r\n\r\n          Cavernous and empty. Joe carries the body to an iron hatch,\r\n          opens it, and dumps him in.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          2.\r\n\r\n          JOE (V.O.)\r\n          And so. Thirty years from now. My\r\n          employers in the future nab the\r\n          target, they zap him back to me,\r\n          their looper. And I do the\r\n          necessaries. So the target has\r\n          vanished from the future, and I've\r\n          just disposed of a body that\r\n          technically does not exist. Clean.\r\n          The body slides down a long chute. Vanishes in a little\r\n          flare of angry red fire.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DINER - DAY\r\n\r\n          A sidecar roadside diner in the middle of nowhere. Joe's\r\n          truck in front.\r\n\r\n          INT. DINER\r\n\r\n          Nearly empty, Joe at a booth listening to headphones. A\r\n          waitress sets down coffee.\r\n          Her bright red name tag: BEATRIX.\r\n\r\n                         BEATRIX\r\n          Bon jour, Joe.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Bon jour, Beatrix.\r\n\r\n                         BEATRIX\r\n          How's the French?\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Slow. How's the coffee?\r\n\r\n                         BEATRIX\r\n          Burnt.\r\n          Cream in the coffee. White clouds boil deep down.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY\r\n\r\n          Joe's truck zooms from the flat fields towards a mid sized\r\n          city on the horizon.\r\n\r\n          INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY\r\n\r\n          Grungy, heavily fortified. Joe enters and puts his gun in a\r\n          basket labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009cLOOPERS - BLUNDERBUSSES\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Slips down a narrow passage, which ends at a steel wall with\r\n          a protruding duct taped camera and microphone.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Two, Jedd.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3.\r\n          Joe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket.\r\n          A small narrow slot slides open in the wall, and gnarled old\r\n          hands take the gold bars. It slides shut again.\r\n          In the background the front door to the pawn shop dings open.\r\n          The slot slides open and Jedd's hands push a wad of cash.\r\n          Joe pockets it, and backs around Dale, another Looper.\r\n\r\n                         DALE\r\n          Hey Joe. Be at the Belle tonight?\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Yup.\r\n          Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves\r\n          his gun and exits.\r\n\r\n                         DALE\r\n          Four, Jedd.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          High ceilings, big clean windows overlooking a sooty city.\r\n          Joe finishes smoothing out an oriental rug and scoots a\r\n          coffee table in place over it.\r\n          Puts a bebop LP on a turntable.\r\n\r\n                         LATER\r\n          On the bed, shooting at the ceiling with his fingers.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Bon jour, mademoiselle. Bang!\r\n\r\n          INT. CAR GARAGE - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Suit-and-tie Joe pulls a tarp off a cherried-out 1992 Mazda\r\n          Miata. Lingers over it. His baby.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CITY STREETS - EARLY EVENING\r\n\r\n          Joe drives through the sooty city streets. A muted beep, and\r\n          he fishes a matchbook sized screen from his pocket.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Yeah Seth? Yeah. Ok.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          4.\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREET CORNER - EARLY EVENING\r\n\r\n          A young looper named SETH on the side of the road, kneeling\r\n          beside a motorcycle without wheels called a SLAT BIKE. He\r\n          kicks it in frustration.\r\n          A VAGRANT approaches and SETH pulls a gun, identical to\r\n          Joe's.\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          Walk around! Around, I'm not\r\n          kidding. Wide around, ya shit.\r\n          The vagrant crosses the street. Joe pulls up.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Seth.\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          Hi Joe.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          That's new.\r\n          Seth kicks the bike.\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          Thanks. Goddamn thing. You going\r\n          to the Belle?\r\n\r\n          EXT. DRIVING THROUGH THE CITY STREETS\r\n\r\n          Seth and Joe.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Slat Bikes are all junk. Stick\r\n          with rubber on the road.\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          Yeah but Gat Men pull up in them,\r\n          they get respect.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          They get respect cause they run the\r\n          town. How much did that thing set\r\n          you back? How much?\r\n          Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm.\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          I was gonna pull up in it.\r\n          Tonight. Heads or tails, call it\r\n          in the air.\r\n          The coin lifts, floats several inches in the air, quivering.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          5.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Congratulations. You're pulling up\r\n          with me instead.\r\n          Joe notices the floating quarter.\r\n\r\n                         JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          And don't, if we're going in, don't\r\n          do that.\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          Chicks dig TKs.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          It's tacky, don't do it.\r\n          Seth catches the quarter, sullen.\r\n\r\n          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          When the TK mutation started\r\n          appearing in the general populace\r\n          it was on every magazine - \u00e2\u0080\u009cNext\r\n          Step in Evolution, what's next.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Everyone got tested. But turns out\r\n          this was it, and now it's just a\r\n          bunch of assholes thinking they're\r\n          blowing your mind by floating\r\n          quarters.\r\n\r\n          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A shitty but bright nightclub in the heart of the city.\r\n          Flashy people shiver behind a velvet rope, huge black cars,\r\n          big rollers in odd suits swept in by the bouncers.\r\n          All trying very hard to be big time.\r\n\r\n          JOE (V.O.)\r\n          Big heads. Small potatoes.\r\n          Drives past, revving the engine.\r\n\r\n          EXT. PARKING LOT\r\n\r\n          Down the street. Joe tosses the keys to an attendant.\r\n\r\n          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE\r\n\r\n          A dingy stage door in back of the building. Joe and Seth\r\n          ring a buzzer, smile for a camera, and the door opens.\r\n\r\n          INT. COAT CHECK\r\n\r\n          A long dark hallway leads to a tiny antechamber with a coat\r\n          check room used for guns. BIG CRAIG leans out of it, and\r\n          stops the two.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          6.\r\n\r\n                         BIG CRAIG\r\n          No loopers in the club on\r\n          Wednesdays, Joe. Gat men only.\r\n          Seth backs towards the door, Joe stops him.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          We'll stick backstage, just meeting\r\n          up. In and out.\r\n\r\n                         BIG CRAIG\r\n          Packing your blunderbusses?\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Hardly. Right Seth?\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          Hardly. I'm with Joe.\r\n          Big Craig pats them down, waves them in.\r\n\r\n          INT. BACKSTAGE\r\n\r\n          A claustrophobic maze of twisty halls and passages.\r\n          DANGEROUS MEN and half naked SHOW GIRLS weave through.\r\n          Joe expertly navigates the turns, going someplace. Seth\r\n          struggles to keep up.\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          So are we - hey -\r\n          Joe has vanished. Seth stops meekly, butted by passing men.\r\n\r\n          INT. BORDELLO ENTRANCE\r\n\r\n          An ornate parlor, LACY WOMEN entertaining men. A velvet\r\n          curtained doorway leads to back rooms.\r\n          Joe lingers by the entrance, watching one girl in particular,\r\n          SUZIE. Bold dark eye makeup. A BIG MAN leads her off\r\n          through the curtains. Joe's eyes drop. Pained.\r\n          A fat MADAME doesn't look up from her ledger.\r\n\r\n                         MADAME\r\n          No loopers on Wednesday, Joe. Gat\r\n          Men only.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          So I've read.\r\n          He ducks out.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          7.\r\n\r\n          INT. BACKSTAGE\r\n\r\n          Joe plods. Dale, the Looper from the pawn shop, passes fast.\r\n          Curious, Joe follows. They pass Seth, who tails after them.\r\n\r\n                         SETH\r\n          Hey, Joe. We leaving? Cuz, what-\r\n          Joe?\r\n          And Seth loses them again, butted back by passing men.\r\n\r\n          INT. STEEP STAIRS\r\n\r\n          A starkly lit steep stairwell leads down. Five or six young\r\n          loopers gather at the top. Joe and Dale join them.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         DALE\r\n          Zach. In there right now, with\r\n          Abe.\r\n          Dale makes a quarter float above his palm. Joe rolls his\r\n          eyes.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          For what?\r\n\r\n                         DALE\r\n          He closed his loop.\r\n          This lands heavily on Joe.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          No shit?\r\n          The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and ZACH, another\r\n          looper, steps out. An OLDER MAN'S HAND pats his shoulder\r\n          then retracts into the door.\r\n          The loopers watch him in awe.\r\n\r\n          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          There's a reason we're called\r\n          loopers.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ABANDONED LOT - DAY (FLASHBACK)\r\n\r\n          Zach stands waiting, checking his wristwatch, gun in hand.\r\n          Obviously performing a similar ritual to Joe's.\r\n\r\n          JOE (V.O.)\r\n          Time travel in the future is so\r\n          illegal, that when we sign up for\r\n          this job we agree to a very\r\n          specific proviso.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          8.\r\n          Zach raises his gun.\r\n\r\n          JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)\r\n          If our employers in the future get\r\n          busted up by the law, their first\r\n          priority is going to be erasing any\r\n          trace of their relationship with us\r\n          ever existing.\r\n          A flash of light, and a HOG TIED MAN with a sack over his\r\n          head kneels in front of Zach.\r\n          Zach fires, and the man's chest explodes.\r\n\r\n          JOE (V.O.)

He enters a code, opens it.\r\n          Wide and deeper than you'd expect, lined with gold bars. Big\r\n          enough for a man.

Cuz it's\r\n          impossible to hit anything farther\r\n          than 15 feet, and impossible to\r\n          miss anything closer. A gun for\r\n          fuck up turkeys. Not like a gat.\r\n          A gat has range. Accuracy.\r\n          His gun spinning gets fancier. His gun meaner looking than\r\n          Joe's blunderbuss, long and slim and chrome.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Alright, cut it out Kid. You're\r\n          gonna blow your foot off again.\r\n          The Kid almost snaps back, but then grins.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          You're right, it'd be real easy for\r\n          it to accidentally go off.\r\n          He clicks the safety off.

Joe falls back. The Kid raises his gun at Joe.\r\n          Frozen in that tableau a moment, the Kid savors his victory.\r\n          Lowers his gun.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          18.\r\n\r\n          ABE (O.S.)\r\n          What the hell is going on out there-\r\n          The high door swings open fast, SMACKING Kid Blue hard on the\r\n          side of the head.

She smiles\r\n          briefly, tired, then takes her hand away and puts drops in\r\n          his eyes.\r\n\r\n                         JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          Do you want to go overseas?\r\n\r\n                         SUZIE\r\n          Do I want to go overseas? With\r\n          you? Now?\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Soon, maybe.\r\n\r\n                         SUZIE\r\n          Baby that's sweet. You're a sweet\r\n          boy. You gotta be careful, it's\r\n          easy to think you know someone once\r\n          you been like this. What's in here\r\n          is services rendered.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Is that how it aughta be?\r\n\r\n                         SUZIE\r\n          What, in nature?\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          You know I get this a lot.\r\n          Especially young guys. I must have\r\n          wife eyes or something.\r\n          His face clouds.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          23.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Joe gets home. Empty, quiet. Everything in place. He goes\r\n          to the rug, pulls it aside. Opens the safe.\r\n          All the gold, and nothing else. One bar juts from the side,\r\n          knocked out of place.\r\n          He pushes it back, and when he lifts his fingers they have a\r\n          bright smear of fresh red blood.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A hunched figure sprints through an abandoned lot towards a\r\n          train yard.\r\n          It is a 55 YEAR OLD SETH. He limps up to a razor-wire fence\r\n          bordering the train yard.\r\n          Surveys the sharp wire, rips the lining from his jacket and\r\n          wraps first his left hand then his right.\r\n          But stops.\r\n          On the palm of his right hand, a WEATHERED SCAR. Clearly\r\n          carved in the shape of an arrow, pointing down to his wrist.\r\n          Old Seth squints at it, confused. He pulls back his sleeve,\r\n          revealing his clean bare forearm.\r\n          Then his face changes.\r\n          Because his arm is no longer bare. Suddenly, out of nowhere,\r\n          more intricate scarring has appeared down its length.\r\n          The scars spell out clearly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBE AT 75 WIRE STREET IN 15\r\n\r\n                         MINUTES\u00c2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Old Seth's breath returns, jagged. He pulls his sleeve up\r\n          and hoists himself up the fence, climbing fast.\r\n          He reaches the top, gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist\r\n          himself over... and stops again.\r\n          His right hand is missing a finger. The ring finger is just\r\n          gone, its stump worn with age.\r\n          Old Seth stares. And now his middle finger is gone as well.\r\n          A freight train whistle moans. The cars, open and inviting,\r\n          leading out of town. Behind him, the city.\r\n          Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it\r\n          takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing\r\n          has changed to a ragged whistle.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          24.\r\n          He lifts his hand, now with just two fingers, to his face...\r\n          and the smooth scarred hole where his nose used to be.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CITY STREETS\r\n\r\n          The train yard far in the distance. Old Seth RUNNING back\r\n          into town.\r\n          He looks down at his right hand, fingerless now but for his\r\n          thumb.\r\n          He speeds up, desperate. Cuts through an alley. And has no\r\n          right hand, just a stump.\r\n\r\n                         OLD SETH\r\n          No no no no no!\r\n          A bell-like DING. Old Seth spins, sees a WEDDING BAND lying\r\n          on the sidewalk.\r\n          He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left\r\n          hand, stuffs it in his pocket, sobbing.\r\n          Bursts out of the alleyway, limping now, straight into the\r\n          street and into the headlights of an oncoming car.\r\n          The car screeches to a halt, and its harsh white light shows\r\n          Old Seth's missing right ear, and deep scars down his face.\r\n\r\n          IN THE CAR\r\n          Old Seth throws open the drivers side door and throws out the\r\n          DRIVER. Jams on the gas.\r\n          Speeding through the streets, hands slipping on the wheel.\r\n          His pant leg crumples. Empty boot tangling with the pedals.\r\n\r\n          EXT. WIRE STREET\r\n\r\n          The car hits a pole.\r\n          Out climbs what's left of Old Seth, his face mangled, missing\r\n          a foot, one arm gone to the elbow.\r\n          Street sign - WIRE STREET. The numbers, 45.\r\n          He runs. Howling, missing his tongue. Arm totally gone.\r\n          Then falls as his leg goes to the knees. And he's crawling,\r\n          an animal form, bellowing wordlessly.\r\n          Makes it to an iron street-side door. 75. And with his one\r\n          arm, slams it.\r\n          Slumps against it, heaving. After a long moment it swings\r\n          open.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          25.\r\n          With no hesitation, a BLAST from the darkened doorway, and\r\n          Old Seth's head mists open. He slumps to the pavement.\r\n          Kid Blue steps from the doorway, drags the body inside.\r\n          Deep in the dark doorway we glimpse a DOCTOR in a surgical\r\n          frock smeared with bright red blood. The door SLAMS.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Joe wakes with a start.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD\r\n\r\n          Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away. He takes his\r\n          stance. Earbud headphones, the drone of French lessons.\r\n          A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears kneeling\r\n          before Joe. Joe raises his gun without hesitation and shoots\r\n          the man in the chest.\r\n          Walks to the body, flips it. The man's hands, tied and\r\n          purplish. Joe hesitates. Puts his hand next to them.\r\n          Similar.\r\n          He flips the man onto his back, stares long and hard at the\r\n          shape of the man's face under the cloth sack.\r\n          Tears it off. An older Asian man's face, frozen in terror.\r\n          Joe smirks, the spell broken. His face hardens.\r\n\r\n          INT. PLANT - DAY\r\n\r\n          Joe watches the Asian man's body slide down the hatch and\r\n          vanish in a puff of distant fire.\r\n\r\n                         BEGIN MONTAGE:\r\n          1. Joe in the club, drinking, watching more loopers\r\n          celebrate.\r\n          2. Joe in the field, he shoots a hog-tied man.\r\n          3. Joe in his floor safe, setting more gold bars.\r\n          4. Joe in the field, BANG.\r\n          5. Joe in the club, watching Suzie with her red hair.\r\n          6. Joe in the field, BANG.\r\n          7. In the plant, a body sliding into the fire.\r\n          8. Joe in the field, BANG. BANG. BANG. His face more\r\n          determined with each shot.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          26.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY\r\n\r\n          Our montage comes to an end suddenly and all is silent.\r\n          Joe in the corn field, in his stance, ready to draw.\r\n          But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks his watch,\r\n          confused.\r\n          2:30 and change. Waits. Watching the blank space where the\r\n          man is supposed to appear.\r\n          Hand on his gun. Breathing shallow. Something is wrong.\r\n          2:32. An eternity. Then, there he is.\r\n          But different. Not kneeling. On his side, so he flops over\r\n          and has to straighten himself. The man's hands are UNTIED.\r\n          Holy shit.\r\n          Joe raises his gun, scared. Time slows. Finger tightens on\r\n          the trigger.\r\n          Then he sees: the man has NO SACK ON HIS HEAD. And the face\r\n          that stares back at Joe is his own.\r\n          57 YEAR OLD JOE. His eyes fixed on Joe.\r\n          And for just one split second, Joe's face slackens, and his\r\n          finger eases on the trigger.\r\n          It's all the hesitation Old Joe needs. He throws his body\r\n          into a spin.\r\n          Joe snaps out of it, and PULLS THE TRIGGER.\r\n          The shot catches Old Joe square in the back, and the impact\r\n          blows him forward. But instead of blood beneath his torn\r\n          jacket's back, we see the layered gold bars spill out. They\r\n          caught the blast.\r\n          In what seems like one fluid motion Old Joe's fingers grab\r\n          one of the bars, he spins again, throwing handfuls of dirt\r\n          and the bar back towards Joe.\r\n          Joe flinches, again just for a moment, and when his eyes\r\n          focus again and his arm steadies the gun it's too late.\r\n          Old Joe is on top of him, with a heavy blow knocking the gun\r\n          aside, and with an even heavier one swinging down on Joe's\r\n          head, a fist and then\r\n\r\n          THE CORN FIELD, HOURS LATER\r\n          Joe wakes. Blood caked on his face. Headphones beside him,\r\n          still squawking French lessons. Sits up.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          27.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Oh god.\r\n          Gold bars scattered in the dirt. But no Old Joe. And no\r\n          truck. Joe staggers to his feet, shaky. Head thick. But\r\n          realizing.\r\n\r\n                         JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          Late to my own funeral.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          Joe runs, shaky, towards town. Fishes his phone-device from\r\n          his pocket, chucks it.\r\n\r\n          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Across the street, Joe huddles behind a car, breathing hard.\r\n          Looks up at his lit window. Debating.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY\r\n\r\n          Joe walks silently towards his apartment door.\r\n          It is ajar. He hesitates. Knows he shouldn't.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT\r\n\r\n          Holding his breath, Joe edges in. It's ravaged, torn to\r\n          pieces. The floor safe is open, about half the gold bars\r\n          missing. But the apartment seems empty.\r\n          Exhaling, Joe works quickly. Knocks a tile aside, pulls a\r\n          wad of cash from the wall. A heavy jacket from the closet.\r\n          Eyes dart around the room - what else? But too late --\r\n          footsteps in the hallway. Joe ducks into the bathroom just\r\n          as Kid Blue and a TALL GAT MAN enter the apartment.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOE'S BATHROOM\r\n\r\n          Joe crouches. Outside, Kid Blue piles the man's arms full of\r\n          gold bars.\r\n\r\n          KID BLUE (O.S.)\r\n          That's twenty four there. I'm\r\n          keeping count.\r\n\r\n          TALL GAT MAN (O.S.)\r\n          Uh huh.\r\n\r\n          KID BLUE (O.S.)\r\n          Two more trips should do it.\r\n          Joe gently lifts himself off his haunches.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          28.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT\r\n\r\n          The Tall Gat Man exits, Kid Blue stays crouched over the\r\n          floor safe hefting out bars, his back to the bathroom. In\r\n          the distance, a GUNSHOT. Kid Blue's head perks up.\r\n          CREAK! From the bathroom. Quick as lightning, the Kid draws\r\n          his gat and spins - but Joe is already upon him, full sprint.\r\n          SLAM! Joe tackles the Kid backwards. But while Joe uses his\r\n          momentum to leap over the OPEN FLOOR SAFE, the Kid tumbles\r\n          back into it, vanishing inside with a painful thud.\r\n          Joe scrambles to a stop, lifts the heavy safe trap door and\r\n          SLAMS it down - just as the Kid's hand grasps the open edge.\r\n          With a sickening CRACK, the trap door closes on the Kid's\r\n          fingers.\r\n          A bellowing howl, his fingers withdraw, and the safe door\r\n          clicks shut. The ELECTRIC BOX rigged to the code pad to\r\n          crack it clatters off, and whirrrr, CLICK. Locked. Joe,\r\n          panting, goes on hands and knees to the safe door and shouts\r\n          clear and earnest:\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Kid listen Kid. I'm sorry. Tell\r\n          Abe I'm going to fix this. Tell\r\n          him keep my bars safe cause I swear\r\n          to god I'm going to fix this, I'm\r\n          going to find my loop and I'm gonna\r\n          kill him. Tell Abe-\r\n          CRACK CRACK! The wood paneled floor above the safe door\r\n          splinters upwards with gunshots, and a chunk of Joe's right\r\n          ear explodes.\r\n          More blood than you'd think spills down his neck, Joe falls\r\n          back. Three more shots - CRACK CRACK CRACK! And now\r\n          footsteps running down the hall.\r\n          Joe on his feet, slipping in his own blood, sprints across\r\n          the apartment. The TALL GAT MAN appears in the doorway,\r\n          shooting blindly at Joe, chunks of wall and plaster exploding\r\n          as Joe doesn't stop but JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW.\r\n\r\n          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT WINDOW - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          5 floors up, Joe leaps out, hits the fire escape, bullets\r\n          shattering the window. Blind with blood, ears ringing, Joe\r\n          barrels down the fire escape. A confused blur of iron steps,\r\n          slipping and scrambling down, but now the tall gat man is out\r\n          the window and shooting down at him.\r\n          Somehow Joe slips and rolls, grabs at thin air, falling -\r\n          three stories at least, falling.\r\n          When he hits the ground the world goes away.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          29.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY\r\n\r\n          We abruptly CUT ON to a very familiar scene.\r\n          Young Joe stands alone in the corn field, in his stance,\r\n          ready to draw. But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks\r\n          his watch, confused. 2:30 and change.\r\n          This is exactly the scene where Old Joe appears, being\r\n          replayed before our eyes. But when Old Joe does APPEAR, it's\r\n          different: his hands are tied, his head covered with a sack.\r\n          And something very different happens:\r\n          Joe raises his gun and without hesitation PULLS THE TRIGGER.\r\n          Old Joe's chest explodes. He falls dead.\r\n          Joe approaches the body, and slows. Sensing something. He\r\n          pulls off the sack. The face of his older self. Old Joe.\r\n          He flips him over. Gold bars CLINK beneath a bloody jacket.\r\n          Joe has closed his loop.\r\n\r\n          INT. LA BELLE AURORE CLUB - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The other LOOPERS buy Joe drinks and cheer him, celebrating.\r\n\r\n          INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING\r\n\r\n          His belongings in boxes.

One holds a gun in the\r\n          owner's face.\r\n          Joe ignores them, walks out.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          30.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Distant thumping bass indicates it's\r\n          maybe behind a club.\r\n          The hall is lined with French Gangster, all similarly\r\n          dressed. Reminiscent of the Gat Men. It takes us a moment\r\n          to recognize Joe among them.\r\n          In his EARLY 40s now. His face a hard weathered mask. A\r\n          soldier.

Long red hair (reminiscent of but NOT Suzie.) In\r\n          a green dress. She flees the fighting, towards the exit.\r\n\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u009cSORTIE.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Transfixed and high, Old Joe follows her.

FRENCH BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          The car screeches to a halt on a beach side road. Old Joe\r\n          gets out, runs across the beach to the water, pulling his gun\r\n          out of its holster. He fires it out to sea till its empty,\r\n          then throws the gun into the ocean.\r\n          He runs back to his Wife, standing on the beach. They kiss.\r\n          They fall to the sand, and kiss.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          32.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Hands lazily entwined. A good life.\r\n\r\n          INT. FRENCH COTTAGE KITCHEN - MORNING - A WEEK LATER\r\n\r\n          The Wife cuts vegetables. Headlines (in French) scroll\r\n          across a small floating screen, against images of\r\n          destruction. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGangland Terror Spreads, Who is The Rainmaker\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          She turns it off.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Draws it away, fingers sliding off\r\n          gently. And is gone.\r\n          We stay with Old Joe. His deep breath. The sun warming the\r\n          sheets. Running water from the kitchen.\r\n          His eyes focus on his hand. Written in faded ink on the palm\r\n          is a number we do not recognize: 07153902935.\r\n          A long moment.\r\n          With all the violence in the world, the cottage's green front\r\n          door is KICKED OPEN.\r\n          Joe runs out of the bedroom half dressed, and GANGSTERS grab\r\n          him, taking him down with a rifle butt to the head.\r\n          His Wife is dragged from the kitchen screaming.\r\n\r\n          EXT. COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Dark cars parked out front. We watch the quiet facade for a\r\n          moment too long, violence that we don't want to think about\r\n          happening inside.\r\n          Then the door BURSTS open and Gangsters drag Joe out, sobbing\r\n          thrashing and bleeding from his head.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          33.\r\n\r\n          INT. BASEMENT - DAY\r\n\r\n          Concrete, nondescript. The Gangsters carry Joe in, now hog\r\n          tied. Put a sack over his head.\r\n          Lead him towards a machine, an iron monstrosity with a hatch.\r\n          One of the men taps his watch - hurry. Another man pulls a\r\n          large lever, and the machine hums, warming up.\r\n          Joe's face, covered with the sack. Breathing. Remembering:\r\n          flashes of his WIFE, screaming.\r\n          Then Joe LUNGES and somehow his hands are loose, he PUNCHES\r\n          one man, tears off the sack, PUNCHES another man, a flurry\r\n          and then it's over. He stands among a pile of broken men.\r\n          Slowly takes stock. Looks at the exit. Looks at the faded\r\n          number on his blood-smeared hand.\r\n          A million things in his mind. But just one choice. The\r\n          machine hums angrily. Ready.\r\n\r\n          INT. TIME MACHINE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Like an iron coffin. Old Joe climbs inside. Braces himself.\r\n          Closes the hatch behind him.\r\n          Flash and crack and he is sent.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY\r\n\r\n          And appears in front of his younger self.\r\n          The scene now plays out as it did the first time. Joe\r\n          hesitates, Old Joe gets the upper hand, knocks him out.\r\n          Old Joe looks around, gets his bearings. Stares at his\r\n          younger self a moment. Then goes to the truck.\r\n\r\n          EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Old Joe drives the truck into the city.\r\n\r\n          INT. BODEGA - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Cramped. Old Joe walks in quickly, gets aspirin, wrapped\r\n          sandwiches, bandages, big bottles of water. Removes his torn\r\n          jacket, dumps it.\r\n          At the register, the CLERK bags everything up. Old Joe pulls\r\n          the blunderbuss on the clerk.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          And your jacket.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          34.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          On the street outside the building. Old Joe approaches,\r\n          watching the window high above. Weighing his options.\r\n          He scans the street. Spots an ARMORED VAN in the alleyway.\r\n          Movement from behind it - Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man\r\n          loading their bars in the back.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Shit.\r\n          Old Joe turns to go, but STOPS when his eye catches movement\r\n          between parked cars.\r\n          It's Joe. Young Joe, hid between the cars, looking up at the\r\n          apartment building weighing his options.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (SOTTO)\r\n          Don't do it. Idiot. Don't do it.\r\n          After a moment Joe dashes across the street and into the\r\n          building. Old Joe stays still a moment, watching him go.\r\n          Ducks into shadows as Kid Blue and the Tall Gat Man step from\r\n          the alleyway, wiping their hands.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          Two more trips.\r\n          They enter the building.\r\n          Old Joe takes a breath, then casually walks down the\r\n          sidewalk, past the alleyway, scoping the Armored Van. A GAT\r\n          MAN DRIVER in the driver's seat.\r\n\r\n          INT. ARMORED VAN\r\n\r\n          The Gat Man Driver watches Old Joe disappear from view.\r\n          Suspicious, he uncovers a GAT on the seat beside him.\r\n          When he looks back up Old Joe stands in his headlights,\r\n          blunderbuss raised. BANG! The windshield shatters, the Gat\r\n          Man Driver is torn apart.\r\n          Old Joe runs up, flings open the door, digs through the\r\n          bloody mess frantically, finding the GAT.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          35.\r\n\r\n          EXT. JOE'S APARTMENT\r\n\r\n          Old Joe dashes out onto the street as gunfire cracks from the\r\n          high apartment window. Sharp eyes will notice that Old Joe's\r\n          right ear is now clipped off, an old wound.\r\n          He dashes towards the apartment door, gun in hand, but stops\r\n          when the window five stories above shatters with gunfire.\r\n          Old Joe backs up, and sees Joe scrambling down the fire\r\n          escape as the TALL GAT MAN fires down at him.\r\n          Old Joe takes expert aim with the gat, and fires three shots\r\n          upwards. The Tall Gat Man's gunfire stops.\r\n          Joe slips on the fire escape, falls two stories and lands on\r\n          the hood of a parked car.\r\n          Old Joe goes to him, checks his pulse.\r\n          Behind them the TALL GAT MAN hits the sidewalk with a SPLAT.\r\n          Old Joe goes to the tall gat man's remains, picks another gat\r\n          out of them, and goes back to Joe's inert body on the car\r\n          hood.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Stupid little shit.\r\n          He lifts him in his arms.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

A tight\r\n          bandage on his ear.\r\n          A mournful train whistle, and he turns. Through a chain link\r\n          fence, the train yard. He was put here for a reason.\r\n          A man and a young boy in rags hop onto an empty cargo car,\r\n          heading out of town. Joe watches the boy, his eyes angry.\r\n          Stands shakily. And walks away from the train yard.\r\n          Something like a HELICOPTER sweeps overhead, a spotlight\r\n          zigzagging the area.

Weaves his way past the reading tables,\r\n          finds what he's looking for at a desk.\r\n          A suspended sheet of thin plastic turns out to be a computer.\r\n          Checking his hand, he inputs the number. Navigates menus and\r\n          windows, information flashing, searching.\r\n\r\n          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Gat Men in cars and helicopters patrol the streets.\r\n          Kid Blue sits on the curb, smoking a cigarette. Seething at\r\n          his bandaged hand. Deep in thought. His eyes lift. An\r\n          idea.\r\n\r\n          EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The familiar red garage. And three stories up, Seth's lit\r\n          window.\r\n          Kid Blue pulls a small caliber gun from a holster concealed\r\n          on his boot, enters the building.\r\n\r\n          INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Old Joe finishes printing several large documents that look\r\n          like maps. He folds them up, pockets them.\r\n          Dashes to the window, starts to heft himself up - And stops.\r\n          On his hand, a smooth aged scar. Of an arrow. Pointing to\r\n          his wrist.\r\n          Old Joe's breath catches. He pulls down his sleeve,\r\n          revealing \u00e2\u0080\u009cB\u00e2\u0080\u009d then \u00e2\u0080\u009cE\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Then \u00e2\u0080\u009cA then \u00e2\u0080\u009cT\u00e2\u0080\u009d... He bares his arm, reading the entire\r\n          message.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          38.\r\n\r\n          INT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The peephole screen on the inside of Seth's apartment door.\r\n          Kid Blue manipulating a device, a shower of sparks blows the\r\n          screen out momentarily, and the door swings open.\r\n          Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the\r\n          apartment with over-eager purpose.\r\n          Empty. He deflates. Thinks.\r\n          Goes to the peephole screen, touches it and a menu comes up.\r\n          A little manipulating, and the image is rewinding.\r\n          An empty hall, scanning back half an hour. Then: young Joe.\r\n          Kid Blue stops scanning, hits \u00e2\u0080\u0098PLAY'. Joe feels around the\r\n          door jam, retrieves a key, and enters the apartment.\r\n          Kid Blue exhales. Well Joe was here.\r\n          Taps the screen again, it goes back to a live feed, and he's\r\n          about to step away when his eye catches something.\r\n          He pushes a square on the screen, and the view changes. To a\r\n          live feed from a camera in the ceiling of the apartment.\r\n          Excited, Kid rewinds this half an hour.\r\n          On the screen: Joe enters the apartment. Rifles around a\r\n          little, then sits at the table. Head in his hands. Staring\r\n          into space.\r\n          Then goes to a kitchen drawer, opens it, gets something.\r\n          Goes to the front door, takes something off the wall, briskly\r\n          exits.\r\n          Kid Blue stops the screen.\r\n          He goes and sits where Joe sat. Stares where Joe stared.\r\n          The kitchen counter. A blender, sink. Can labeled \u00e2\u0080\u009cCOFFEE.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Kid goes to the kitchen drawer Joe opened, pulls it open.\r\n          It's full of knives.\r\n          Kid goes finally to the door, looks at the wall. A small\r\n          rack for keys, several hanging and one empty hook.\r\n          Kid Blue stares into space, trying to put these pieces\r\n          together. Lights a cigarette.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD - DAWN - ESTABLISHING\r\n\r\n          The sun rises over a flat endless field of corn stalks.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          39.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD\r\n\r\n          We push forward through the green stalks at a brisk pace.\r\n          They part before us, endless, hypnotic.\r\n\r\n          INT. BEDROOM - MORNING - FLASHBACK\r\n\r\n          The same from the previous flashback.\r\n          Old Joe in bed, half asleep. A woman's arm under his neck.\r\n          It slips away, and he kisses its wrist. Comfort, warmth.\r\n          The woman, leaving. Her hand touches and slides off his\r\n          foot, moving away.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DINER - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          Old Joe emerges from the corn fields bordering the sidecar\r\n          roadside diner. Fumbles in his jacket, dry-swallows four\r\n          aspirin. Regains his footing. Walks around the diner\r\n          cautiously.\r\n          Parked in back behind a dumpster, SETH'S SLAT BIKE.\r\n\r\n          INT. DINER\r\n\r\n          Joe sits at a booth. Old Joe enters, steps up slowly, sits.\r\n          A moment of silence.\r\n          Along with his ear, Joe's hand and arm are now wrapped in\r\n          bloodied bandages. Joe's eyes go to Old Joe's arm. Old Joe\r\n          pulls his sleeve back and shows him the scar spelling\r\n\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u009cBEATRIX.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Beatrix the waitress steps up breezily.\r\n\r\n                         BEATRIX\r\n          Coffee?\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Please.

Listen. alive\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          You know what the voice of god\r\n          sounds like? See now good you're\r\n          confused now but you're listening.\r\n          I hope the voice of god sounds like\r\n          an old man speaking French. Old\r\n          men speaking French sound like\r\n          primeval trees in a strong wind,\r\n          just irrefutable. Wise, strong,\r\n          gentle, all these things in\r\n          harmony, complimentary. At once.\r\n          Old men speaking French. Young men\r\n          speaking French sound, without\r\n          exception, like weenies. Fact.\r\n          You ever hear a Frenchman under 40\r\n          try to sound threatening? It's\r\n          hilarious. English is a tight t-\r\n          shirt, flatters the young. Rat a\r\n          tat tat. French is a double\r\n          breasted suit. Young man can put\r\n          it on, but it always feels like\r\n          he's putting something on. Some\r\n          things, you just need the years.\r\n          It's my favorite language.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          I've got a life ahead of me that's\r\n          mine and I'm not giving it up for\r\n          you or anybody\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          42.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Well you know what you have to do\r\n          then why don't you take your little\r\n          gun out from between your knees and\r\n          do it.

Takes a breath.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          I know why you couldn't pull that\r\n          trigger.

Or you gotta\r\n          cut yourself off, go numb. But\r\n          that'll kill you, down the line.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          It's hard to make eye contact with\r\n          you.

It's like a fog.\r\n          Because my memories aren't really\r\n          memories, they're one possible\r\n          eventuality now, and they grow\r\n          clearer or cloudier as they become\r\n          more or less likely. But then they\r\n          get to the present moment\r\n          (the left straw)\r\n          And they're instantly clear again.\r\n          Like a wall of fog moving forward\r\n          with the present moment. I can\r\n          remember what you do after you do\r\n          it.\r\n          He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right, and it\r\n          pushes the pepper with it.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          So you can\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          And it hurts.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          So when we're apart you can\r\n          remember what I do. After I do it.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Uh huh. But\r\n          Beatrix brings their food, two identical plates. Old Joe\r\n          awkwardly clears away the pepper and straws.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          This is a precise description of a\r\n          fuzzy mechanism. Time travel fucks\r\n          everything, my brain and body try\r\n          to catch up. It's messy. That's\r\n          why it's dangerous. And it hurts.\r\n          All I know I know two things for\r\n          sure. I know what's happening in my\r\n          head. And I know that you're still\r\n          going to meet her.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Who?\r\n          Old Joe takes a worn double of Joe's POCKET WATCH from his\r\n          pocket, clicks it open. We don't see inside it, but he\r\n          stares at it intently.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          45.\r\n\r\n          JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          This is a woman, what? I'm going to\r\n          fall in love with?\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          She's gonna save your life.\r\n          Old Joe makes eye contact with Joe, for maybe the first time,\r\n          and holds it. Unexpectedly naked on his face is the deepest\r\n          sort of grief. Deep and unrelenting. Joe can't look at it,\r\n          he breaks off his gaze.\r\n          The grief is too much for Old Joe to swallow back down, so he\r\n          turns it into anger.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          For a long time at the beginning\r\n          she thought we'd have a baby. She\r\n          would have been a good mother. She\r\n          wanted that so much. And now I'm\r\n          saying sorry to a picture.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          She's. How is she, you said save\r\n          my life.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Your life. Let's look. At your\r\n          life. You're a killer and a\r\n          junkie.

The question is why.\r\n          Why would someone waste themselves\r\n          on you, give up the good life they\r\n          had, sacrifice a good life to love\r\n          you.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          My life is my own, I don't need it\r\n\r\n                         SAVED\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Shut your fucking child mouth.\r\n          She's going to clean you up and\r\n          you're going to take her love like\r\n          a sponge and you're both going to\r\n          pretend that she's saved you,\r\n          you're so self absorbed and stupid.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Yesterday.

FRENCH COTTAGE - MORNING (FLASHBACK)\r\n\r\n          His Wife spins, as Gangsters burst into the entryway.\r\n          Old Joe in bed. It plays out again. He leaps to his feet,\r\n          is tackled by the Gangsters. They drag Old Joe from the\r\n          bedroom. Though the hall, Joe sees the woman struggling\r\n          against two Gangsters, her dress torn and bloody. One\r\n          approaches her with the knife.\r\n          Old Joe screams, struggles, but cannot stop them from doing\r\n          what they do to her.\r\n\r\n          INT. DINER\r\n\r\n          Joe is not sure where to put his eyes.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Have you heard of the Rainmaker?\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Seth said, that night. A new boss\r\n          in the future, he said.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          The Rainmaker came out of nowhere\r\n          and in the span of six months took\r\n          total control of the five major\r\n          syndicates.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          That would take an army.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          But he didn't have an army. Legend\r\n          is he did it alone. Alone alone.\r\n          Don't know I believe the legend but\r\n          he didn't have an army.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          How did he do it?\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          That's the question. And no one\r\n          knows. Not only that, there's no\r\n          pictures of him. It's insane.\r\n          There's stories he has a synthetic\r\n          jaw. Things like that. But word\r\n          spread quick about him through the\r\n          ex-looper grapevine, even before\r\n          his mass executions and vagrant\r\n          purges and reign of terror, because\r\n          the first thing he did was start\r\n          closing loops.

This\r\n          number. This number.\r\n          On the back of his papers he scrawls the number: 07153902935.\r\n          As he writes it, a phone starts ringing, bringing us into:\r\n\r\n          INT. OFFICE - DAY - FLASHBACK\r\n\r\n          An 8th story office, under siege. Gangsters down in the\r\n          street fire up at the windows with guns. Helicopters pass\r\n          by. The office door is blocked shut with a filing cabinet.\r\n          On the phone - the looper DALE, but in his mid 50s. Battered\r\n          and terrified. Holding a piece of paper, reading off it, on\r\n          the phone with Old Joe.\r\n          The wall with the door in it EXPLODES inward.\r\n\r\n          INT. FRENCH LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - FLASHBACK\r\n\r\n          The line goes dead. Old Joe hangs up. Looks at his hand,\r\n          with the number. Standing in his cottage, before he was sent\r\n          back. Through the window, his wife working in the garden.\r\n          Old Joe closes his hand.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (V.O.)\r\n          This is a piece of identifying\r\n          information on the Rainmaker.

And then we can\r\n          all do what we have to do.\r\n          A beat. Old Joe holding the pocket watch, gazing at it.\r\n          Then he snaps it closed in his fist, drawing it back.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          No you don't understand. We don't\r\n          have to give her up. I'm going to\r\n          tell you why I'm here now.\r\n          He puts his hand on the folded papers.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm gonna save her.\r\n          A quick beat. Joe goes for his gun. But Old Joe is fast, he\r\n          jams his foot into Joe's crotch, crushing the hidden gun into\r\n          him. Joe cries out, Old Joe grabs his hair and plants his\r\n          face into the table.\r\n          When Joe's hands go to his face Old Joe grabs them and pulls.\r\n          Foot in his crotch, pulling his arms tight over the table.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          The Rainmaker is alive right now.\r\n          Living here, somewhere in this\r\n          county. And I can find him with\r\n          this. I need you to lay low, stay\r\n          out of my way and not get caught.\r\n          I know how to fix this, I won't\r\n          stop till I finish it. I'm going\r\n          to find him and kill him.\r\n          Joe's face loosens, his eyes on their coffee cups.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          It's been awhile since we've gotten\r\n          a warm-up.\r\n          Old Joe realizes, looks around. The diner is eerily quiet.\r\n          Beatrix and the staff have all quietly left. Fled.\r\n          Old Joe swings out of the booth, still holding Joe by the\r\n          hair, dragging him like a doll. Joe's blunderbuss clatters\r\n          to the ground. Old Joe drags him to the window. They look\r\n          out. Nothing in the parking lot. Too quiet.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          49.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          It's been thirty years for me, so\r\n          it's hard to remember.

Old Joe draws his gat.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          Make it to the field, you can lose\r\n          them in the field. Go east and hop\r\n\r\n                         A TRAIN\r\n          Joe punches Old Joe square in the jaw, and he goes down. His\r\n          papers and gun fall. The diner door EXPLODES.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          I've got him! He's here!\r\n          A GAT MAN barrels in, his gat blazing. Joe scrambles but Old\r\n          Joe gets the gat.\r\n          With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down, but there\r\n          are two more behind him. Pinned behind a booth, Old Joe\r\n          returns fire, glass breaking and chaos.\r\n          Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks.\r\n          Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet.\r\n          Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the\r\n          booths, back to their table, as the Gat Men and Old Joe have\r\n          their fire fight. Joe's blunderbuss on the ground beneath\r\n          the table. He scoops it up. Turns, and fires at Old Joe.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Shit.\r\n          Joe's blunderbuss hacks another shot, and the window behind\r\n          Old Joe explodes. Old Joe makes his break, sprints for the\r\n          broken window, jumps...\r\n\r\n          EXT. BACK OF DINER - MORNING\r\n\r\n          ...and hits the dusty parking lot running. Towards the corn.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FRONT OF DINER\r\n\r\n          Kid Blue squats on his haunches with four more Gat Men, their\r\n          guns trained on the diner door. Three Gat Men burst out,\r\n          followed by Joe.\r\n\r\n          DINER GAT MAN\r\n          The back, he's running!\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          Around back!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          50.\r\n          They all run around back, where Old Joe is halfway to the\r\n          corn but not there yet.\r\n          The seven Gat Men and Kid Blue and Joe fire their guns after\r\n          him while running but they're too far away (and they're\r\n          running) so nothing hits. Joe blasts at the old man blindly,\r\n          sprinting with all his might, eyes streaming tears in the\r\n          dust.\r\n          When Old Joe hits the wall of corn he seems to vanish. Four\r\n          of the Gat Men follow him in, while the remaining pursuers\r\n          slow to a stop, doubled over, panting. Defeated.\r\n          It takes a few seconds for Kid Blue to realize that Joe is\r\n          there with them. It takes another second for Joe to realize\r\n          that the dynamic has changed. He turns and runs back towards\r\n          the diner, Kid Blue and the Gat men in pursuit. One of the\r\n          Gat Men fires.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          Alive!

The Kid and the Gats closing in, and just the\r\n          moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike\r\n          the engine turns over with a ROAR.\r\n          The back of the bike kicks up, heat and air blasts from the\r\n          open slats beneath, blowing Kid Blue back on his ass. The\r\n          bike HOVERS a few feet off the ground.\r\n          Joe roars off into the corn. The Kid is on his feet running\r\n          back to the Gat Men.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          The tracker! Get the tracker!\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD\r\n\r\n          Joe riding at full speed through the thick corn stalks. He\r\n          BAILS, snapping through corn stalks and rolling to a painful\r\n          stop. The bike ZOOMS onward through the stalks, quickly out\r\n          of sight.\r\n          Pained, Joe lies still, breathing hard. Pulls Old Joe's torn\r\n          paper from his pocket. On one side, the number Old Joe\r\n          scribbled: 1027363259 He flips it over. It's a map.\r\n          Mostly of empty farm land, bisected by a bold highway and\r\n          scattered farm houses.\r\n          One of them is CIRCLED IN BLACK.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          51.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FIELD - DAWN\r\n\r\n          A bare field of churned chocolatey earth. Near its edge juts\r\n          the dead stump of an old tree.\r\n          A YOUNG WOMAN in work clothes named SARA chops away at the\r\n          trunk with a large axe. Over and over, splintering it apart.\r\n          Endless plains of corn surround the field. In the near\r\n          distance, a two story farm house with an adjacent barn.\r\n          Sara focused on her work as the sun rises.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          Sara fiddles with a garbage can sized DEVICE, and with a\r\n          crackle of mechanic thrusters it floats up and over the corn\r\n          fields, spraying something chemical.\r\n\r\n          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          Sara makes coffee.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARM HOUSE PORCH - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          She sits on a rocking chair, and mimes smoking an invisible\r\n          cigarette.\r\n          Our first good look at her face. Clear and beautiful, but it\r\n          has been here for awhile.\r\n          The morning light changes from steel blue to pale white.\r\n          Rocking gently, fake smoking and drinking coffee. Not going\r\n          anywhere.\r\n\r\n          INT. FARM HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Blinds drawn, dark. A FIGURE lies in bed. Sara steps in,\r\n          puts her hand on the sleeping figure's foot.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          C'mon baby. Time to get up.\r\n\r\n          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Cooking eggs. The front door bangs. She looks up.\r\n\r\n          INT. FARM HOUSE FOYER\r\n\r\n          The screen door bangs in the wind. Sara inspects it. The\r\n          latch is broken. She sighs.\r\n          Then freezes.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          52.\r\n          Through the screen door, some fifty yards across the front\r\n          lawn, the dark figure of a MAN stands at the edge of the corn\r\n          fields. Watching her.\r\n          She watches right back for a long moment.\r\n          Then grabs a shotgun mounted above the door and with no\r\n          hesitation at all plows outside.\r\n          The dark figure vanishes into the corn fields.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN\r\n\r\n          Sara storms down the porch and stalks across the lawn,\r\n          shotgun extended. Not fucking around.\r\n          Does not slow her pace until she is ten yards from the corn\r\n          fields, where she plants herself and shouts:\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Listen up fucker. I have shot and\r\n          buried three vagrants in the past\r\n          year. If you want to know the\r\n          Christ's honest truth I'm starting\r\n          to get a taste for it. So I don't\r\n          care what hobo sob story you've\r\n          got, I get a dozen a week and it\r\n          cuts no cash with me. It's me and\r\n          my husband here, we're broke and\r\n          angry at our lot in this world and\r\n          heavily armed. So take some corn\r\n          and move on, but if you show your\r\n          face again I will cut you the fuck\r\n          in half.\r\n          Silence. Just the wind in the corn. A long beat. Then Sara\r\n          turns, walks briskly back.\r\n          Moments later Joe's face pokes through the corn stalks. He\r\n          takes in the farm. The barn behind it. The fallow field.\r\n\r\n                         LATER\r\n          Joe sits in the same spot, a few feet in the corn but with a\r\n          clear sight line at the house.\r\n          His gun on his knee.\r\n          JOE'S FACE - Pale, sweating. Something's wrong. He winces.\r\n          Pinches his eyes. Headache.\r\n          The sun pounds down. He looks at the piece of map.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          C'mon. C'mere. C'mon. C'mon.\r\n          C'mon.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          53.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CITY - ESTABLISHING - DAY\r\n\r\n          Helicopters sweep by.\r\n\r\n          INT. ABE'S OFFICE\r\n\r\n          Abe stands fuming, flanked by two Gat Men. Kid Blue sits\r\n          like a kid in detention.\r\n\r\n                         ABE\r\n          Well. You found him. And you\r\n          russeled up a posse and went to git\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u0098em. Like a good little cowboy\r\n          from one of your movie movies.\r\n          Without telling me.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          I can do it again.\r\n\r\n                         ABE\r\n          You can fuck up again? Really.\r\n          You know what happens to me if I\r\n          don't get that old bastard? I got\r\n          too much riding, Kid, I can't\r\n          afford a fuck-up playing cowboy.\r\n          Put your gat on the table.\r\n          Fighting tears now, Kid puts his gun on the desk. But he\r\n          doesn't take his hand off it.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          I wanted you to say I did good,\r\n          that's all I wanted. This is all I\r\n          have.\r\n          Abe puts his hand on the gat. Kids' finger still on the\r\n          trigger. A tense moment. Abe pulls the gun away, across the\r\n          table.\r\n\r\n          KID BLUE (CONT'D)\r\n          Please just give me one more\r\n          chance, I'll bring him here alive\r\n          and hold him and you can put a\r\n          bullet in his brain yourself-\r\n          Abe grabs the hammer. SLAMS it on Kid's bad hand, crushing\r\n          it. Kid howls, the Gat Men grab him.\r\n\r\n          INT. STEEP STAIRS\r\n\r\n          Kid is literally dragged up the stairs by a Gat Man.\r\n\r\n          INT. BACKSTAGE\r\n\r\n          The Gat Man shoves Kid Blue through the twisty maze of\r\n          backstage, past girls and Loopers and men.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          54.\r\n          The Kid blubbers and bleeds. Humiliated. But he pulls\r\n          himself halfway together. Make a show:\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          I'm gonna make this good again. I\r\n          will. I'm gonna be back.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY\r\n\r\n          Raining. The Gat Man pushes the Kid out the back entrance\r\n          door, into the alley. The Kid instinctively turns towards\r\n          the street.\r\n          But the Gat Man steers him back, deeper into the alley. The\r\n          Kid realizes what this means. Everything changes.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          Oh no. Oh no no no no\r\n          He fights in vain to break from the Gat Man's grip. Weeps,\r\n          begs, clasps at whatever he can grab.\r\n          The Gat Man turns a corner -- towards the alley's dead end.\r\n\r\n          KID BLUE (CONT'D)\r\n          No! No! No no no no!\r\n          Shrieking. Annoyed, the Gat Man throws the Kid hard to the\r\n          concrete. The Gat Man pulls his gun, raises it without\r\n          ceremony.\r\n          BANG. The Gat Man's face explodes. Staggers, his gun FIRES\r\n          into the wall. He drops like a doll.\r\n          Kid Blue lies in the rain, hyperventilating. His pant leg\r\n          hiked up, showing his boot with its holster.\r\n          In his mangled left hand, the small caliber PISTOL he keeps\r\n          stashed. His pinkie on the trigger.\r\n\r\n          KID BLUE (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh.\r\n          Cradling his crushed hand, dazed, he scampers off like a\r\n          soaked rat.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Silent and still. Sara comes out onto the front porch. She\r\n          gathers up a few things, turns out the porch light.\r\n          Notices a floodlight still lit on the BARN across the yard.\r\n          She turns the porch light back on.\r\n          The dark corn fields, silent and vaguely threatening. She\r\n          steps back in the house, emerging again with the shotgun.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          55.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FRONT LAWN - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara stalks towards the barn, shotgun in hand. Shadows loom\r\n          across the yard. All is silent.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          She reaches the barn. A hard pool of light from a mounted\r\n          floodlight falls off to inky darkness.\r\n          Hits a metal switch near the barn door and the light snaps\r\n          off. In its absence the darkness swarms.\r\n          She briskly walks back towards the house, but slows. Stops.\r\n          Turns. In the darkness by the barn, crunch crunch. Crunch.\r\n          And maybe a shape. Deep in the swarming dark.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Hey. Who's there.\r\n          Sara levels the shotgun at the darkness, and steps back.\r\n          Quiet but definite - crunch crunch. And now, definitely a\r\n          shape. A man. coming towards her.\r\n\r\n                         SARA (CONT'D)\r\n          Stop right there. Stop!\r\n\r\n          EXT. CORN FIELD - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Joe slumped over unconscious where we left him, in the corn.\r\n          Sara's shout wakes him with a start. Sweating, pasty.\r\n          Disoriented. Something is wrong with him.\r\n          In a flash of panic he parts the corn stalks, sees Sarah\r\n          backing away from the barn. The dark hulking figure of a man\r\n          pursues her slowly but steadily.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n\r\n                         SHIT\r\n          His hand goes to his holster but his gun has fallen out, he\r\n          scrambles in the dirt for it.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FRONT LAWN\r\n\r\n          Sara backing up still, shotgun leveled. The man, still in\r\n          darkness, comes towards her.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          You stop right there, you stop!\r\n          She fires her gun in the air. The man pauses, but then\r\n          continues towards her. She trips on a root, FALLS.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          56.\r\n\r\n          INT. 2ND STORY BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          From a CHILD'S POV - We run across a darkened bedroom to the\r\n          WINDOW.

In trouble. The DARK\r\n          MAN, advancing towards her menacingly.\r\n          At the last moment, from the corn fields, JOE runs into the\r\n          light and steps directly between them, shouts, his gun raised\r\n          at the Dark Man.\r\n          And the Dark Man STOPS.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

But the porch light on the\r\n          man's face: it is not Old Joe.\r\n          It is a man in his 30s, filthy, with down's syndrome. A\r\n          greasy sign around his neck: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPLEASE HELP MUWTE FOOD $ GOD\r\n\r\n                         BLESS YOU\u00c2\u0080\u009d\r\n          Joe lowers his gun, face melting.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Jee sus.\r\n          (to the MUTE VAGRANT)\r\n          Hey, hey.

Then he\r\n          kneels, his small hands feeling Joe's sweaty face. Pushes a\r\n          straw to Joe's lips. Joe's hands clasp around a plastic cup\r\n          with a cartoon tiger, and he drinks.\r\n\r\n          SARA (O.S.)\r\n\r\n                         (SHARP)\r\n          Cid.

He violently washes his hands in\r\n          a trench of water.\r\n          Slumps back, eyes blood red. Streaks of tears down his face.\r\n          Reddish light fading to blue through the grating high above.\r\n          Runs fingers across his forehead, spreading cooling water.\r\n          His eyes close. His breathing shallows.\r\n          In one hand he holds his pocket watch. He places the other\r\n          on the gat. The map beneath it.\r\n          Daniel's map location CROSSED OUT. Two others remaining.\r\n          And the missing corner, edge torn.\r\n          CLOSE ON Old Joe's face. Slipping to sleep.\r\n          Then from nowhere a CHILD'S HAND enters frame and rests on\r\n          his forehead. Old Joe's eyes gasp open with terror\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Laid out on it:\r\n          an arrangement of toys.\r\n          With the deliberateness of a man at work Cid clicks on a\r\n          flashlight and sets it on the table.\r\n          Works on several toys, cracking open cases, pulling out\r\n          wires. Hands moving fast. Joe sits, watching Cid.\r\n\r\n                         CID\r\n          Hand me that Phillips.\r\n          Joe hands him the screwdriver.

Gat Men in cars pass occasionally\r\n          with spotlights and radios, but the activity has calmed.\r\n          Old Joe slips around a corner. Staying hid. Checks the\r\n          address on the map. 12 Talbott Dr, #205.\r\n          Makes a break for stairs leading to the 2nd level. But just\r\n          at that moment a car pulls into the building's lot.\r\n          Old Joe ducks under the stairs. Holding his breath.\r\n          The car parks. Door slams. Footsteps. A WOMAN. Slumping\r\n          exhausted, up the stairs.\r\n          And through the slatted steps Old Joe sees her face flash by.\r\n          It is Suzie, the girl from Abe's brothel. Old Joe's face,\r\n          pure disbelief. He recognizes her instantly. It can't be.\r\n          He gingerly steps half a foot out. Looking up he can see the\r\n          apartment doors above. Suzie walks down the landing.\r\n          Towards apartment 205.\r\n          Jesus it can't be.\r\n          Then she passes it. Keeps walking. Old Joe's eyes,\r\n          relieved.\r\n          She stops at the next door over, knocks. It opens, vaguely\r\n          indistinct conversation between her and the girl that\r\n          answers.\r\n\r\n                         SUZIE\r\n          Sorry, I know I promised five, you\r\n          know how it gets.\r\n\r\n                         GIRL NEIGHBOR\r\n          Don't worry sugar. She was no\r\n          problem. Gat men searched through\r\n          here, lookin for god knows...\r\n          Suzie disappears into the apartment. Re-emerges, holding a\r\n          sleeping 6 year old girl. She whispers goodbye to the\r\n          neighbor and walks back to APARTMENT 205. She enters.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          78.\r\n          Old Joe, frozen.

To 205.\r\n          Breath held, back against the wall. Peeks in the window.\r\n          On the couch, Suzie holding her daughter. Head in her lap.\r\n          Stroking her hair. Suzie's back is to us, and with her long\r\n          red hair down, she is eerily reminiscent of Old Joe's wife.\r\n          Old Joe watches them for a long time.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT PORCH - DAY\r\n\r\n          Joe sits, watching the corn. It rustles in the wind. Hand\r\n          on his blunderbuss.

In the distance, Joe\r\n          paces the yard.\r\n          Relieved, Sara returns to Cid. He sets the tile, petulant.\r\n\r\n                         SARA (CONT'D)\r\n          No. Eight times three is what?\r\n\r\n                         CID\r\n          Thirty two.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Eight times three is what?\r\n\r\n                         CID\r\n          Thirty two.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          I want you to count three eights.\r\n\r\n                         CID\r\n          Eight.

Why don't you put that where\r\n          it belongs?\r\n          Deliberately, Cid lifts the tile and sets it straight back\r\n          down on the same spot.\r\n\r\n                         SARA (CONT'D)\r\n          Alone time.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          80.\r\n          Then like a knife in a fist fight:\r\n\r\n                         CID\r\n          He's protecting us cause you can't\r\n          do it.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Ok.

You're a liar\r\n          and you're gonna get killed and you\r\n          won't stop lying!\r\n          Cid lunges at her, Sara slaps him back.\r\n          Not hard, but Cid scoots back, eyes furious.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n\r\n                         CID BABY\r\n\r\n                         CID\r\n          You're a liar!

Sara pushes\r\n          back away from him.\r\n          Maybe a cloud passed over the sun. The room darkens.\r\n          And we see it now, in her eyes: Sara is afraid. She bolts\r\n          out of the room.\r\n\r\n          EXT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY\r\n\r\n          Sara walks fast down the hall\r\n\r\n          INT. SARA'S BEDROOM\r\n\r\n          Not slowing, through her bedroom\r\n\r\n          INT. SARA'S CLOSET\r\n\r\n          Into her walk-in closet, to a huge steel safe tucked in back.\r\n          She opens the safe with trembling hands. And climbs inside.\r\n\r\n          INT. SAFE\r\n\r\n          Closes the heavy door. Turns on a small LED light.\r\n          And waits. Cid's screams distant but not lessening.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Cid's screams from the house, clear as day.\r\n          Joe paces in front of the barn. Turns his head back towards\r\n          the house, not sure what to think.\r\n          The screams stop. Joe turns uneasily back to the swaying\r\n          corn.\r\n\r\n          INT. CID'S BEDROOM\r\n\r\n          The math game scattered, numbered tiles everywhere. Cid lies\r\n          face down on the bed, cried out.\r\n          Sara enters quietly. Sits on the bed beside him. Strokes\r\n          his hair. He folds into her, and they're holding each other\r\n          tight.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY\r\n\r\n          A Gat Man named CANADY strolls out of a donut shop, coffee in\r\n          hand, and gets in his car.\r\n\r\n          INT. CANADY'S CAR\r\n\r\n          Canady starts the car up, starts driving.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          82.\r\n          Somehow not seeing Kid Blue crouched clear as day in the\r\n          passenger side foot-well.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          Hey Can.

Holds it on him. A tense moment.\r\n\r\n                         CANADY (CONT'D)\r\n          Course I'd never turn a friend for\r\n\r\n                         A PRICE\r\n\r\n          EXT. ALLEYWAY\r\n\r\n          BANG and the drivers side window explodes outward bloody.\r\n          A moment, then Kid Blue stumbles out, holding his ears in\r\n          pain. Off down the alley and out of sight.\r\n\r\n          INT. CID'S BEDROOM\r\n\r\n          Sara lies with Cid, both asleep.\r\n          Distant but sharp, a bell ringing. It's unmistakable this\r\n          time. The DINNER BELL. Sara's eyelids flutter. She hears.\r\n          Stiffens.\r\n          The bell stops suddenly. She stands, careful not to wake\r\n          Cid.\r\n\r\n          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Sara rushes quietly down the stairs.\r\n          Through a doorway, she sees the Frog Buzzer sitting on the\r\n          living room coffee table. Lit up and buzzing.\r\n          She goes to the front door, throws it open. And is face to\r\n          face with a tall Gat Man named JESSE. She freezes.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE\r\n          Evenin ma'am.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Evenin.

FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Joe slips in through the screen door, gun in hand. Freezes\r\n          in the kitchen, listening.\r\n\r\n          JESSE (O.S.)\r\n          I'm a deputized police officer,\r\n          we're looking for an escaped\r\n          criminal, just doing a sweep. Seen\r\n          anyone through here the past two\r\n          days, vagrants?\r\n\r\n          SARA (O.S.)\r\n          No, vagrants are always passing but\r\n          nobody near the house.\r\n          Footsteps, as they walk deeper in the house. Joe can't tell\r\n          if they're coming through the living room or hall. He\r\n          hesitates.\r\n\r\n          JESSE (O.S.)\r\n          This man, here.\r\n\r\n          SARA (O.S.)\r\n          He's young. No.\r\n          Then at the last moment Joe slips out the hallway door, as\r\n          they enter from the living room.\r\n          Sara leads Jesse in, holding a photograph of Joe. She pours\r\n          him some water. Jesse hands her a second photograph.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE\r\n          We're looking for his father too,\r\n          similar look and build but late\r\n          50s. May or may not be travelling\r\n          together.\r\n          This one is a print-out from a security camera in the Bodega,\r\n          of Old Joe holding a gun on the checkout clerk.\r\n          Sara's eyes linger on Old Joe's photo, side by side with\r\n          Joe's.

FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM\r\n\r\n          He sits on a couch, taps on a small folding phone. Sara\r\n          follows him.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE\r\n          Eight, you said? Boy?

No.\r\n          Sweet kid. But he's wanted. My\r\n          boss has half the city's looking\r\n          for him. Half the city and me.\r\n          So. And if you find him, there's a\r\n          helluva price. Think on that if he\r\n          comes by, acting sweet.\r\n          Behind the couch, Joe crouches unseen. He looks up and sees\r\n          Cid in the foyer, standing halfway down the stairs.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          87.\r\n          If Jesse turned his head he would see Cid clear as day.\r\n          Joe motions for Cid to get out. Cid points to Jesse, makes a\r\n          GUN with his hand. Asking Joe.\r\n          Joe shakes his head, sharply motions: get out! Cid silently\r\n          creeps down the stairs.\r\n          He is in full sight of the living room, but Jesse doesn't\r\n          look up from his phone.\r\n          Cid vanishes down the hall. Jesse looks up, stands.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE (CONT'D)\r\n          Alright, show me upstairs.\r\n          The screen door in the kitchen creaks and bangs. Jesse looks\r\n          sharply at Sara.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Drafts, in the house.\r\n          Jesse is already moving fast to the kitchen. The instant\r\n          Jesse exits, Cid appears again in the hallway.\r\n          Opens a small door under the stairway and beckons Joe.\r\n\r\n          JESSE (O.S.)\r\n          This door doesn't latch?\r\n\r\n          SARA (O.S.)\r\n          It used to, it's busted.\r\n          Joe hesitates, then silently dashes over and in.\r\n\r\n          INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER\r\n\r\n          Cid follows him in, down steep concrete stairs. Pulls the\r\n          door closed behind them. It CREAKS. Jesse steps out into\r\n          the hallway, gun drawn. Sara behind him.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE\r\n          Drafty house.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Farm house.\r\n          Jesse walks to the thin wooden door. Opens it. Closes it.\r\n          CREAK. He looks at Sara.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE\r\n          What's down there?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Laundry room.

First, I have a family\r\n          of my own back in the city, and I\r\n          want to see them again. Second if\r\n          anything happens to me, and I don't\r\n          report back to my boss people in\r\n          fifteen minutes, they're gonna know\r\n          I disappeared searching this house,\r\n          and inside of another fifteen\r\n          you'll have an army of more me's\r\n          kicking down your door. Ok?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          It's a laundry room.\r\n          Jesse motions - her first.\r\n\r\n          INT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM\r\n\r\n          Bare concrete basement, starkly lit by a hanging bulb. The\r\n          only things in the basement are a small washer and dryer, and\r\n          a large canvas hamper the size of a fridge.\r\n          No windows. Nowhere else to go. Jesse levels his gun at the\r\n          hamper.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE\r\n          You want to call out whoever's\r\n          hiding in that hamper?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          If someone was hiding in the house,\r\n          that's what I'd do. But nobody is\r\n          in the house. Open it up.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE\r\n          No I think I'm gonna put a shot\r\n          through it just to be safe.\r\n          He raises his gat. Sara stiffens slightly.\r\n\r\n                         JESSE (CONT'D)\r\n          You wanna call him out?\r\n          Sara stays silent. A long beat.\r\n          Then Sara strides over, pulls the hamper open. Empty.\r\n          She throws open the washer and dryer. She takes the bucket\r\n          and shakes it upsidown, dumping out the water, shows him it's\r\n          empty.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          89.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Now if you promise not to wag your\r\n          gun at my shoe rack I'll show you\r\n          upstairs then show you the fuck\r\n          out.\r\n          She storms up the stairs. A little cowed, Jesse holsters his\r\n          gun and follows her.\r\n          The water from the bucket flows in a small stream across the\r\n          room, and into a drain hole under the hamper.\r\n\r\n          INT. TUNNEL\r\n\r\n          Dark and earthy. Cid leads Joe with his flashlight.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BARN - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          Just outside the barn, a trap door covered with earth opens\r\n          two inches. Joe and Cid prop it open, and peer out at the\r\n          house.\r\n\r\n          INT. CRAWL SPACE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          A deep large hole capped with a wooden trap door.

His name's Jesse. I like\r\n          him. He'll go away when he doesn't\r\n          find me, he won't hurt her.\r\n          They watch in silence for awhile. In the distance, Jesse\r\n          leaves the house alone and scopes the grounds before walking\r\n          back towards the highway.\r\n\r\n                         JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          My mom gave me up. I was younger\r\n          than you. We were vagrants, and\r\n          she was alone, for a long time I\r\n          thought she was stupid for getting\r\n          on the drug she was on, it was bad\r\n          stuff, it probably ended up killing\r\n          her.\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          90.\r\n\r\n                         JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          But now I see, she was so alone.\r\n          And it was what she had. She sold\r\n          me. To a panhandle gang.\r\n          QUICKLY, SILENTLY WE SEE - FOUR YEAR OLD JOE dragged into\r\n          darkness by rough men, screaming. Then we're back to the\r\n          scene.\r\n\r\n                         JOE (CONT'D)\r\n          But I got away. And I ran and I\r\n          ended on a train, sitting in the\r\n          dark in an empty freight, going to\r\n          the city, and I saw myself over and\r\n          over killing those men who bought\r\n          me and who got my mom on what she\r\n          was on. Finding them and tearing\r\n          them apart. Saving my mom.\r\n\r\n                         CID\r\n          But you didn't.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          A man in the city found me, put a\r\n          gun in my hand, and gave me some\r\n          things. I didn't have my mom\r\n          anymore. I had my work, my money.\r\n          My plans. For my life. That's\r\n          what I'd kill for. Not something I\r\n          don't have, and can't ever get\r\n          back.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          There's just men figuring out what\r\n          they'd do to keep what's theirs,\r\n          what they got.

Wants to put his hand on his shoulder but\r\n          doesn't.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          I think we're clear.\r\n          He opens the trap door, climbs out.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BARN\r\n\r\n          Joe reaches down to help Cid out. Looking down at Cid in a\r\n          hole with a trap door. Like Seth.\r\n          He grabs Cid's hand and lifts him out.\r\n          Sara comes out, sees Cid and her face breaks with relief.\r\n          Cid runs to her, and in the distance they embrace.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          91.\r\n          Sara and Joe share a look.

Kid Blue watches a screen, his\r\n          hand on a toggle wheel. A security cam view of Suzie's\r\n          apartment building upper landing. Playback of last night.\r\n          It scans quickly forward.\r\n          The APARTMENT SUPER leans against the wall behind him,\r\n          counting money.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          All working girls, yeah?\r\n\r\n                         SUPER\r\n          Uh huh.

Picks up her daughter from\r\n          next door. Goes into 205. Kid Blue keeps scanning. And an\r\n          instant later, Old Joe climbs the stairs. Kid Blue slows the\r\n          playback.\r\n\r\n          KID BLUE (CONT'D)\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lo Joe.\r\n          Old Joe goes up to the window, his back to the wall. Watches\r\n          Suzie through the window for a long while. Kid watches him\r\n          intently.\r\n          Then very suddenly, without going inside, Old Joe leaves.\r\n          Down the stairs, shoving his gun in his jacket.\r\n\r\n                         SUPER\r\n          I'm an arranger, stranger. Huhuha.\r\n          But you don't see what you wanna\r\n          see, no refunds.\r\n          Old Joe vanishes down the street in a swarm of pixels.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Kid Blue emerges from a passage, into the parking lot. Looks\r\n          up at Suzie's apartment door. Then down the street. A few\r\n          drops of rain fall.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FRENCH CAR - DAY (FLASHBACK)\r\n\r\n          Driving on a highway along the beach. A few drops of rain on\r\n          the windshield. Old Joe (late 40s) and his Wife in intense\r\n          conversation, her hand on his.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          92.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)\r\n          But I will.\r\n\r\n          WIFE (IN FRENCH)\r\n          You want to, I know that.

You'd kill for me, you'd\r\n          take life for me. But I don't want\r\n          that. You kill for what you love,\r\n          but someone loves the person you\r\n          kill, and it starts again. I don't\r\n          want that. I can't love a killer.\r\n          What would you give up for me?\r\n          That's yours?\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE (IN FRENCH)\r\n          Anything.\r\n          She smiles but does not believe him. Old Joe sees this. A\r\n          moment, in thought.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          The car screeches to a stop, and Old Joe runs to the sea.\r\n          THROWS his gun in the ocean. Above the waters, the sun\r\n          breaks the clouds. Rain falls.\r\n          He runs back to her. Falls on her. Kissing her. He holds\r\n          her face like the most precious thing in the world.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Anything.\r\n\r\n          INT. CHURCH - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Rain beats against stained glass. Old Joe kneeling in a pew.\r\n          Fists clenched as if in prayer. He stands, stumbles out.\r\n\r\n          EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Oddly quiet. Old Joe walks down the sidewalk towards the\r\n          side entrance to the theater. Face uncovered.

Deep in the fog are other\r\n          backgrounds - a street, a house - and unfamiliar faces.\r\n          Other eventualities, clouding this one as it becomes less\r\n          likely Old Joe will meet his wife and have this memory.\r\n          Erasing it.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE'S EYES.\r\n\r\n          INT.

But where his Wife was in the previous memory,\r\n          now there is the FOG.\r\n          A wall of it, massive, reaching to the sky. Old Joe dwarfed\r\n          against it. Caught between the roiling waves and this wall of\r\n          nothingness falling towards him.\r\n\r\n          OLD JOE'S EYES.\r\n          The gun on his fingertips. About to fall.

Her hand moves over her bare leg. Slides across the\r\n          sheets. Finds the Frog Buzzer lying next to her.\r\n          A moment of hesitation. Then she pushes it.\r\n          Silence. Her eyes go to the window. A long beat. Then\r\n          sound: a door opening in the house below.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          94.\r\n          Quick footsteps approaching.

Joe still stunned.\r\n          Sara smokes a real cigarette, taking a deep joyful drag. She\r\n          sets the lighter on her palm.

I drove up\r\n          crying and I had been at a party in\r\n          the city when I got the call, I was\r\n          wearing this ridiculous party\r\n          dress. All my ridiculous shit. I\r\n          don't know if he remembered me, but\r\n          he looked at me. I abandoned him.\r\n          I abandoned my baby.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Maybe I can't be a mother to him,\r\n          is that something I can't get back.\r\n          When he looked at me then, on the\r\n          porch, he was mine again, he was my\r\n          son. I seen so many men in the\r\n          city, who I look in their eyes and\r\n          they're lost. Whether he loves me\r\n          back or not I'm gonna love my son I\r\n          said.

He looks at\r\n          Joe. Terrified. Half covered in blood. Hair matted over\r\n          one eye.\r\n          Joe looks back at him. Approaches him, gun not raised, but\r\n          in hand. Cid, like a frightened animal. A long moment.\r\n          And just like that, Joe puts his hand on Cid's head. Cid\r\n          leans against his legs, crying.\r\n          Sara bursts into the clearing, sees this. Runs to Cid and\r\n          embraces him, wiping the blood from his face.

Kid pushes Old Joe through the long\r\n          entrance hallway, past a dozen Gat Men, who watch him with\r\n          shocked amazement.\r\n          Old Joe's hands bound back. Kid Blue glows. He comes to the\r\n          tiny coat check room, and Big Craig stops him, then sees Old\r\n          Joe.\r\n\r\n                         BIG CRAIG\r\n          Hoh.

That's why\r\n          all the Gats are here, the whole\r\n          crew's arming up to make a sweep.\r\n\r\n                         KID BLUE\r\n          Joe fuck Joe, save your bullets I\r\n          got the Looper. Not such a fuck up\r\n          huh? I'm taking him up to\r\n          This happens very fast:\r\n          Old Joe uses his legs to kick himself off the wall and back\r\n          into Kid Blue, SLAMMING him against the opposite wall.\r\n          Old Joe grabs (behind his back) Kid Blue's gun, and blasts\r\n          one shot through the chains binding his wrists and into the\r\n          Kid's midsection.\r\n          He whips the gun from behind his back and shoots Big Craig in\r\n          the face. Then blasts the Gat Men in the entrance hallway\r\n          while he reaches into the coat check and pulls an automatic\r\n          rifle.\r\n          He blasts like hell into the hallway. A few shots return but\r\n          mostly the men are trapped. Then it's over. All is smoky\r\n          still for a moment.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          104.\r\n          Old Joe stares at the exit door ajar, down the long hallway\r\n          jammed with bodies. Then at the passage that leads deeper\r\n          into the club.\r\n          A Gat Man runs in, and Old Joe shoots him down.\r\n          He steps into the coat check and loads his pockets with guns\r\n          and grenades. Then launches himself into passageway towards\r\n          the club.\r\n\r\n          INT. BACKSTAGE\r\n\r\n          Old Joe weaves his way through the backstage area, chucking\r\n          grenades in front of him, then unloading his automatic rifle\r\n          into the smoky aftermath.\r\n          And with a mixture of dumb luck and skill from years of being\r\n          gangland muscle takes out Gat Man after Gat Man.\r\n          The corridors are tight, twisty. Old Joe uses that.\r\n          Throwing grenades. Blasting away. Purging. Killing\r\n          everyone he lays eyes on. Wiping them out. All the bad guys.\r\n          It's horrible. Men maimed, bleeding and crying, dying the way\r\n          people actually die from gunshots. Old Joe forges on, deeper.\r\n\r\n          INT. ABE'S OFFICE\r\n\r\n          Empty. Old Joe kicks the door open. Takes it in, the\r\n          office. Hammer on the desk. He reloads a gun. Eyes find\r\n          the door to Abe's inner den.\r\n\r\n          INT. ABE'S DEN\r\n\r\n          Abe and two Gat Men, guns out, crouched behind the table.\r\n          Watching the door. A display screen shows Old Joe on the\r\n          other side.\r\n          Abe, eyes dull. Shouts at the door\r\n\r\n                         ABE\r\n          Joe. Guess I put the gun in that\r\n          kid's hand, huh Joe. Guess\r\n          everything comes back around. Like\r\n          your goddamn ties.\r\n\r\n          INT. ABE'S OFFICE\r\n\r\n          Old Joe. Breathing hard. Reloaded. Closes the gun.\r\n\r\n          EXT. HIGHWAY\r\n\r\n          Joe breaks out of the corn, panting. He steps out into the\r\n          middle of the highway.\r\n          Storm clouds on the horizon. He cleans and readies his\r\n          Blunderbuss.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          105.\r\n\r\n          INT. COAT CHECK - LATER\r\n\r\n          Kid Blue's eyes flutter open. He lifts himself painfully.\r\n          Checks his chest. Most of the shot caught his shoulder, his\r\n          chest is grazed.\r\n          The Gat Men in the hall. Big Craig. All dead.\r\n\r\n          INT. BACKSTAGE\r\n\r\n          Kid Blue wanders the smoky halls. Dead and dying men.\r\n\r\n          INT. ABE'S DEN\r\n\r\n          Abe, shot once in the head, twice in the chest. Kid Blue\r\n          stands over them. Stunned. Tears well in his eyes.\r\n          Then on the wall, he sees the map. The farm circled in red.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Clothes and boxes piled in the back of Jesse's truck. Sara\r\n          loads one last bundle.

Then, a CLOUD OF DUST on the distant highway. He\r\n          tenses. The cloud gets closer. It is a truck. An armored\r\n          truck.\r\n          Joe squints. It's the ARMORED TRUCK that Kid Blue loaded his\r\n          gold bricks into. The front windshield blown in.\r\n          The truck stops fifty feet away, and Old Joe steps out. He\r\n          throws a gold bar, which lands in the dusty highway between\r\n          them.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Bon jour. You take this truck, you\r\n          take your money, and you go live\r\n          your life. No one's coming after\r\n          you. I fixed it.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          And you go kill the boy. That's\r\n          how you fix it.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          That's how. You got your life\r\n          back, you better think right now\r\n          about what that's worth to you.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          My life? Your life.

Too far away, the shot\r\n          scatters. The old man flinches, backs away.\r\n          Joe walks forward towards Old Joe, stepping over the gold.\r\n\r\n                         OLD JOE\r\n          Stupid little shit! You let him\r\n          live, he's gonna take away\r\n          everything that's yours, everything\r\n          that's mine! You seen what the\r\n          boy's gonna become.\r\n\r\n                         JOE\r\n          I haven't seen that yet.\r\n          Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's\r\n          chest and knock him back.\r\n          Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has\r\n          until now blocked our line of sight down the highway.\r\n          Kid Blue.\r\n          The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to\r\n          the dusty pavement.\r\n          The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its\r\n          wake. It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a\r\n          stop and spin it around.\r\n          Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss.\r\n          Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand. Levels it, steady as\r\n          a rock.\r\n          Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires\r\n          scattershot.\r\n          Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe.\r\n          Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round\r\n          after fiery round.\r\n          Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud.\r\n          KID BLUE'S POV - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud\r\n          of dust and smoke.

Managed by a man sent from the future named Abe, loopers kill and dispose of victims sent back in time whose faces are hidden by a bag. They are paid with bars of silver strapped to the target. To prevent connections to the use of illegal time travel, when a looper is retired, his future self is sent back to 2044 as a target for his younger self, but with gold bars as a payment. This event is referred to as \"closing the loop\" and signals the end of a looper's contract. Failing to close the loop is punishable by execution.\nJoe's best friend Seth, part of a minority that has manifested low-level telekinetic abilities, confides that he failed to close his own loop, and that his future self warned him of a mysterious lawless person called the Rainmaker who, in the future, will overthrow the five major crime bosses and end all the loopers' contracts. Joe reluctantly hides Seth in his apartment's secret floor safe, but the place is searched and Joe is taken to Abe by Kid Blue, one of Abe's elite gangsters known as \"Gat Men.\" Given the choice of revealing Seth's hiding place or forfeiting half of the silver he has hoarded, Joe betrays Seth. Abe's men cut an address into Seth's arm, then begin severing parts of his body, causing his older self's body parts to disappear one by one and compelling him to go to the address, where he is then killed. Feeling guilty, Joe offers Suzie, a sex worker with whom he is friendly, half of his silver.\nWhen Joe's next target arrives, it is his own older self, with his face uncovered. Before Joe can close his loop, Old Joe shields himself with the gold bars, knocks younger Joe unconscious and escapes. Returning to his apartment, Young Joe fights with Kid Blue, only to fall off a fire escape and black out.\nIn another timeline, Young Joe kills his older self as he arrives with a bag on his head. He moves to Shanghai, where his drug addiction and partying persist. After running low on money, he becomes a hitman. Many years later he meets a woman during a bar fight; the two fall in love and marry. Thirty years after he killed his older self, Joe is taken to close the loop, but his wife is killed in the process. Overpowering his captors, Joe sends himself back to 2044 unbound and unmasked, and escapes from his younger self, thus creating the alternative timeline. When Old Joe sees Young Joe fall from the fire escape, he drags him to a safe location.\nMemories of both timelines seem to coexist in Old Joe's mind, becoming either clear or dim as their probabilities change. Old Joe meets with Young Joe at a diner (where the latter has typically frequented) and explains that he is going to kill the Rainmaker as a child to change the future and save his wife. Kid Blue and several other Gat Men arrive at the diner, and a gunfight ensues. Young Joe ends up with a corner of Old Joe's map containing one of three locations circled on the map and a number. Old Joe escapes, and Young Joe runs off into the fields to escape would-be punishment from the Gat Men.\nYoung Joe heads to the marked place, a farm where Sara and her son Cid live. Sara recognizes the number on the map as Cid's birthday along with the code of the hospital where he was born. Young Joe guesses that Old Joe is going to kill all three boys born that day, not knowing which one will become the Rainmaker. Joe waits at the farm for his older self.\nJesse, another Gat Man, comes looking for both Joes. Cid successfully hides himself and Young Joe from Jesse; later that night Sara and Young Joe have sex. In the morning, Young Joe awakes to find that Jesse has returned and has Sara at gunpoint in the living room. Hearing the arguing, Cid comes down the stairs. Being frightened by Jesse, Cid falls down the stairs and becomes upset, triggering an enormous telekinetic blast that kills Jesse, revealing that Cid is a powerful telekinetic and the future Rainmaker. Young Joe realizes that Old Joe now knows Cid's abilities as well.\nKid Blue captures Old Joe and takes him to Abe. Old Joe breaks free and kills Abe and many of his men. Old Joe then travels to Sara's farm. While Young Joe kills Kid Blue, Old Joe pursues Sara and Cid, eventually shooting at Cid, with the bullet grazing his cheek. Cid creates another telekinetic blast, but is calmed by Sara before he can kill her and Old Joe. Telling Cid to run into the cane field, Sara stands in Old Joe's line of sight to shield her son. Young Joe, seeing Old Joe about to shoot Sara, realizes the event will turn Cid into the Rainmaker. Too far away to prevent it, he kills himself, erasing Old Joe, saving Sara and potentially preventing Cid from becoming the Rainmaker."}

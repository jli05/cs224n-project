As we\ndescend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets:\nthe sounds of a Mass being sung.\n\nA CATHOLIC CHURCH\n\nThe big wooden doors open to release the parishioners\ninside. Feature a tall, lanky 18-YEAR-OLD. Holding his\nGIRLFRIEND'S hand, anxious for Sunday to really begin.\nThey don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a\nfaucet's been cranked down. They move toward a Mercedes\n500. As a CHAUFFEUR holds the back door open for them...\n\nA GRAND MARQUIS\n\nSqueals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside\nthe Mercedes. FOUR MEN get out flashing  badges. In a\nmoment they're hustling Eighteen toward the car, stiff-\narming the chauffeur. As the girlfriend  cries and the\ngossip among the parishioners begins...\n\nThe Grand Marquis pulls away.\n\nINT.   GRAND MARQUIS - DAY\n\nThey shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat.\nThese guys are not the police.\n\nA switchblade is flicked open. Practiced hands slit the\nboy's Sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels.\nEighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf.\n\nDuct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head.\n\nEXT.   WOODED AREA - DAY\n\nThe Marquis is parked across from another CAR. FOUR NEW\nGUYS wait as Eighteen is hauled out of the Marquis. His\nclothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin. He\nstands naked, bound and blind. Eighteen is handed over\nfrom one group to the other.\n\nINT. TELEPHONE - UPSCALE HOME - MEXICO CITY - DAY\n\nThe phone rings. A bomb going off.

Facing   it, Eighteen\nstands naked blindfolded and shivering. The   back of his\nleg still bleeds. He shifts nervously as a   little JACK\nRUSSELL TERRIER eagerly licks the blood off  his calf.\n\nA MAN ('The Dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates\nby cell phone. Voice calm. As he runs numbers, he slaps\nhis thigh. Jack Russell trots over, gets an ear\nscratched.\n\nAt a motion from the man, Eighteen is taken down to the\nground. Straddled by two men, his head is mummified in\ntape leaving one ear exposed.\n\nCUT TO T.V. - Rosanna Garcia Guerrero, editor of REFORMA\nnewspaper, being interviewed, \"...organized crime\nsyndicates...growth of kidnapping in Mexico over the last\ntwo years.\"\n\nEXT.   UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY\n\nAs a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox. A\nglimpse of something we don't want to see. An ear\npartially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear.\n\nEXT.   CITY SQUARE - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT\n\nA MERCEDES driving around the square, Eighteen's father\nwaving a white shirt out the window like a surrender\nflag.\n\nEXT.   BRIDGE - NIGHT (3 AM)\n\nFootbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway.\nEmpty train blazes through. Dangerous, deserted downtown\nneighborhood. Looks more like \"war torn Beirut\", burnt\nout cars and trash. The 18 year old's father, naked to\nthe waist, walks from the family Mercedes over the\nfootbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi-\nderelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of\nfabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open.

Samuel, at 40,\nalready has the patrician look that has served the male\nmembers of his family for generations.

SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT\n\nSamuel sits at his baby    grand piano playing a gentle\nrendering of 'Delibes'.     His American wife LISA stands\naway from him. Just the     sight of her back reveals a\npitch perfect petulance.    She tells him:\n\nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                       4.\n\n\n                          LISA\n             A man's worth can be judged by what he\n             has or what he owes.

A bodyguard's presence in the\n             car or outside the school was at least\n             some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I\n             feel totally exposed.\n\nShe just stares at him.    He melts.\n\n                                                  RETURN TO:\n\nINT.

Beheading two\ncigars, he passes one to Samuel.\n\nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                5.\n\n\n                         JORDAN\n            All my clients have kidnap and ransom\n            insurance.\n\n                         SAMUEL\n            I have a policy, AIG.

But\n            you will get what you pay for.

Hire someone cheap.\n            You have to have a bodyguard to keep the\n            insurance. Then fire him for\n            incompetence. The important thing is\n            Lisa's daughter will return to school.\n\nSamuel finally follows the logic.\n\n                         SAMUEL\n            And Lisa will be able to save face.    We\n            won't be the only family without a\n            bodyguard.\n\n                         JORDAN\n            Her beauty fucks with your mind.\n\n                         SAMUEL\n            For an American she understands this\n            country very well.\n\nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                   6.\n\n\n                           JORDAN\n              She understands men.\n\nAs Samuel puffs his cigar in satisfaction...\n\nEXT.

Gone.\n\nMAN TWO, who has abandoned chasing Pinta, fires again.\n\nCreasy drops the 9mm as he is hit in the stomach.      He\nfalls to his knees.\n\nThe dandelion starts to come apart.

Even great marriages cannot\nsurvive the trauma of kidnapping and subsequent death.\n\nThe door opens and they expect to see Maria with the\ndeserts. Creasy enters and sits at the table like a\ndinner guest.\n\n                          CREASY\n                    (to Samuel)\n             I'm going to talk to your wife.

He turns\nto Lisa.\n\n                          CREASY\n             I'm going to tell you a story. Your\n             lawyer is dead. Someone didn't want him\n             talking. Last week he wired $2.5 million\n             into his U.S. bank account. Colonel\n             Ernesto Tazinari is also dead. He\n             hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5\n             million. If my arithmetic is correct it\n             means $5 million remains.\n\nCreasy looks to Samuel.\n\n                          CREASY\n             Your husband magically had five million\n             deposited in a U.S. bank account last\n             Friday.\n\nLisa's eyes never leave Creasy's...trying to discern\nwhether this is true or not.\n\n                          CREASY\n             They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.\n\n                             LISA\n             Planned what?\n\nWork in Progress 2/10/03                                     109.\n\n\n                         CREASY\n            An autosequestra.

It\n            didn't work out that way. Everything got\n            fucked up when I killed the cops and\n            Tazinari saw an opportunity.\n\nLisa screams.   Creasy gestures with a finger to his lips.\n\n                         CREASY\n            On the surface it was low risk and high\n            return.

My pain\n            and weakness only fueled your anger and\n            determination.

The misfire.     He\nempties the other cartridges from his gun.\n\nLisa suddenly attacks Samuel in a violent, emotional\noutburst of tears, screaming, and rage. Drawing blood\nfrom his nose and upper lip. Samuel smothers Lisa's arms\nbeneath his. He appears strong and decisive for the\nfirst time.\n\nCreasy very carefully takes the bullet, puts it into the\nmagazine and chambers the round. He looks into Samuel's\neyes.\n\n                         CREASY\n            A bullet does not lie. A bullet tells\n            the truth.

Because of the extremely high rate of kidnappings in Mexico City for ransom money, businessman Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) hires Creasy through Rayburn to guard his nine-year-old daughter \"Pita\" (Dakota Fanning), intending to keep him on for only a short period in order to renew his kidnap and ransom insurance on Pita. Creasy suffers from alcoholism, depression and severe guilt as a result of his past work as a counterinsurgency fighter and assassin, and so works for Samuel at a rate far below what his experience would command. At first Creasy distances himself socially from Pita, but the two soon develop a friendship, which allows Creasy to overcome his demons and to act as a mentor and surrogate father-figure to the girl.\nAfter a piano lesson, Pita is abducted in public. Creasy kills four of the kidnappers including two corrupt policemen, but he is shot multiple times and collapses. Creasy is hospitalized but is moved to a veterinarian hospital by Miguel Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini), an agent of the Agencia Federal de Investigaci\u00f3n (AFI), who suspects Creasy is an assassination target by rogue police. Meanwhile, the Ramoses agree to deliver a dead drop ransom of US$10 million per the instructions of \"La Voz\" (\"The Voice\") (Roberto Sosa), the mastermind behind the kidnapping ring. Samuel's attorney, Jordan Kalfus (Mickey Rourke), arranges for the ransom money to be collected from Samuel's kidnapping insurance policy, then arranges for it to be delivered to the kidnappers. The drop, however, is ambushed by members of \"La Hermandad\", a Mexican crime syndicate composed of corrupt police officers, leading to several of the ring members killed and the money being stolen. The Voice notifies the Ramos' that Pita will be killed in retribution.\nCreasy leaves the hospital before fully recovering from his wounds and vows to Pita's mother Lisa (Radha Mitchell) that he will kill everyone involved in Pita's abduction. Rayburn supplies Creasy with firearms and explosives, while Mariana Guerrero (Rachel Ticotin), a journalist investigating the kidnappings, and Manzano, offer their support. Creasy tortures and murders several targets by cutting off their fingers and stopping the bleeding with a car cigarette lighter for their information and eventually learns from the \"La Hermandad\" general that the bags they stole at the ransom drop contained only $2.5 million actual currency while the rest was blank paper.\nInvestigating further, Creasy finds Kalfus dead and evidence of Samuel's desperate financial situation. He confronts Samuel and Lisa for the truth behind the kidnapping. Samuel confesses to Creasy and Lisa that he agreed to Kalfus' plan to stage Pita's kidnapping, so he could pay off business debts by fraudulently collecting the insurance money. He planned to keep $5 million for himself and split the rest between Kalfus and the kidnappers. He also confesses to killing Kalfus who lied that Pita would be safely returned after the ransom was paid.

HUDSON RIVER - DAWN\n          \n          A blizzard, at the peak of its power. Visibility zero, New\n          York reduced to the hulking shapes of buildings on the banks.\n          MAX PAYNE thrashes in the water, a long way from shore.\n          \n          \n                                MAX'S VOICE\n                      There's an army of bodies under this\n                      river. Criminals, people who ran out of\n                      time, out of friends.\n          \n          \n          Chunks of ice float in the dirty water around him.

Just a flash\n          of golden light filling the hall, warm as the river was cold.\n          Around a closed door, sunlight streams through the gaps...\n          \n          BEDROOM\n          \n          A WOMAN sleeps on the bed, curled up around a bundled BABY.\n          Is this the final, peaceful memory of a drowning man?\n          \n          Something's wrong, then: the woman's body in an unnatural\n          position, more thrown than laid across the bed. The crib\n          tipped over, blankets scattered. Her eyes frozen open.\n          \n          Something BLACK flutters against the window pane, CRACKING\n          into the glass. The sound of the BLIZZARD creeps in...\n          \n          RESUME - HUDSON RIVER\n          \n          Wind POUNDS the river where Max had once been, but there's no\n          more thrashing in the water. Mixed in behind the falling\n          snowflakes, BLACK SHAPES swirl and dive closer to the water.\n          \n                              MAX'S VOICE\n                    I could feel the dead down there, just\n                    below my feet. Reaching up to welcome me\n                    as one of their own.\n          \n          Max breaks the surface - GASPING, STRUGGLING against the\n          undertow.

STREET (NYC) - NIGHT\n          \n          Abruptly, the snow is gone. Just a bitter wind left in its\n          place, whipping through desolate streets long after midnight.\n          Shuffling up the littered sidewalk, three rough-looking MEN\n          duck out of the wind by descending down to the subway...\n          \n          On the dark side of the street, a pair of BOOTS follows them.\n          \n          TITLE CARD:      ONE WEEK EARLIER\n          \n          INT. ROSCOE ST. STATION - DAY\n          \n          A filthy platform, empty except for the three Men huddled on\n          a bench. A squeaking TURNSTILE catches their ear...\n          \n          The same boots grind towards the Men. We don't see the\n          walker's face, distracted by something else: a gleaming gold\n          wristwatch. As if to make certain the Men notice, he pulls\n          back his sleeve to check the time. Quarter past three...\n          \n          The watch glints as it passes into a dark doorway marked\n          `MEN'S.' The Men follow, exchanging wicked grins. Too easy.\n          \n          SUBWAY BATHROOM\n          \n          The Men slink into the bathroom, smirking at their oblivious\n          prey at the sink. Steam rising, he sets the watch on the\n          edge of the sink before washing his hands...\n          \n                                 MAN #1\n                       Hey, that's a really nice watch.\n          \n          No answer. One of the Men LOCKS the door.       At the sound of\n          the lock SNAPPING, he raises his head...\n          \n          Max Payne, but not yet the man struggling for life in the\n          river: clean-shaven, skin like bleached bone. Haunted eyes.\n          In the murky mirror, Max sees the Men circling closer...\n          \n                                 MAN #1\n                           (drooling over the watch)\n                       Kinda reminds me of one I lost--\n          \n                                 MAX\n                       You didn't lose it.

He was there with you.\n          \n          Doug frowns, deeply confused about being called by his name.\n          \n                                 DOUG\n                       You've been following us all night?\n          \n                                 MAX\n                       No.\n                            (pointing)\n                       I'm only following you.\n          \n          While Doug digests that, PAWNSHOP pulls a pistol and trains\n          it on Max's forehead. The third man - not much more than a\n          KID, visibly frightened - backs towards the door.\n          \n                                                      \n          \n                                                                     4.\n                     \n          \n          \n                                 PAWNSHOP\n                       You a cop, or something?\n          \n                                 MAX\n                       Not tonight.\n          \n                                 PAWNSHOP\n                       Too bad.\n                           (to Doug)\n                       Go get my watch.\n          \n          Distractedly eyeballing Max, Doug brushes the watch off of\n          the sink. It hits the dirty tile, delicate crystal CRACKING.\n          \n          In a sudden blur of movement, Max has one hand on the pistol,\n          the other one SMASHING into Pawnshop's windpipe...\n          \n          Doug steps forward to help... BOOM! The pistol goes off as\n          Max pries it free. Max looks up at Doug. Nowhere to run, he\n          races into the farthest stall and SLAMS the door.\n          \n          In the same instant, the Kid bolts for the door. Max has to\n          pick: follow or stay with the man he's tracking...\n          \n          In the stall, Doug crawls on his stomach across the sticky\n          floor, trying to squeeze under the divider. Max raises the\n          pistol and BLASTS a hole through the door of the next stall.\n          \n                                 DOUG\n                         (craving, eyes closed)\n                       Watch over me, watch over me...\n          \n          The newly-perforated door flies open. Handcuffs SNAP,\n          restraining a WHIMPERING Doug to the toilet pipe.\n          \n                                 MAX\n                       Open your eyes, now.\n          \n          Doug finds himself staring at the pistol's front sight. Max\n          reaches into his pocket and produces a tattered photograph...\n          It's the woman from Max's golden vision in the river.\n          \n                                 MAX\n                       Have you ever seen her before?\n          \n          Doug shakes his head violently, confusion and terror rising.\n          \n                                 MAX\n                       You got busted robbing a house in New\n                       Jersey with William Preston three--\n          \n                               DOUG\n                     Bill's dead.\n          \n                               MAX\n                     That's why I'm talking to you.\n                         (moving the photo closer)\n                     Did he ever say anything about this\n                     woman?

Max steps in, reaching up to touch Mona's shoulder...\n          I\n           t happens in a flash: Mona spins and takes hold of Max's\n          arm. Incredibly, he's just as fast, slipping free of the\n          grip that would surely have snapped his wrist...\n          \n          For a moment, Max and Mona stare each other down. Surprised,\n          reevaluating each other. Natasha continues to TALK, her\n          Russian anxious as Mona's bodyguards push through the crowd.\n          \n          Mona's eyes drop to Max's chest, where the tussle pulled his\n          coat open to reveal a low-pro holster and tarnished badge.\n          \n          With the flick of her wrist, Mona stops her guards' advance.\n          \n          The crowd begins to notice the altercation.

Silly grin, frozen eyes shining.\n          \n          Hands trembling, Max pushes the toy aside. Deeper in the\n          box, he finds a framed picture and pulls it into the light...\n          \n          The photograph is of Max - younger, cleaner, genuinely\n          smiling.

Max\n          chokes back tears, occasionally glancing at the baby box.\n          \n           he beam hits on a document box in the back row.   `OFFICE.'\n          \n          Max rushes over, nearly tipping the other boxes in his hurry\n          to throw the lid off the document box.

Stone-faced.\n          \n          Thundering BOOTS echo out from the belly of the building.\n          Doors fly open - Guards racing out from the kitchen on the\n          first floor, two more from the office CRASHING out upstairs.\n          \n           ax OPENS UP, flames of automatic fire lighting his way.\n          \n          BACK ROOM\n          \n          Lupino and the Guards listen to the SHOOTING grow closer.\n          Suddenly, the metal door flies open, BANGING at the stop.\n          With lightning reflexes, THE GUARDS BLAST down the hallway.\n          \n           upino slowly stands, eyes glowing in the guard's muzzle\n          flash.

Before he sees\n          it coming, Lupino drives a hard punch into Max's skull.\n          \n          Max stumbles forward, ears ringing from the blow.

Teeth gnashing like an animal, Lupino reaches out\n          and tries to pull the machine gun out of Max's hands.\n          \n           upino buries the knife into Max's shoulder.

Arm numb from the\n          stab wound, Max's grip on the gun is slowly overpowered.\n          Helplessly watching it slip away, Max SCREAMS with rage...\n          E\n           XT.

Smokeless. Just a hall. Blood streaks the\n          walls, flows between the crumpled carcasses of more dead\n          GUARDS. At the far end of the hall, something moves:\n          \n          \n          \n          Max.

No\n          chance to respond, bodies torn open with a merciless BLAST of\n          machine gun fire.

He is consumed with investigating and finding the murderer of his wife Michelle and their infant child Rose. Max's snitch, Trevor, supplies information that leads Max to three drug addicts in an empty train station. They attempt to rob Max in a bathroom; instead, Max interrogates one of them about his family\u2019s murder, with no results. While one of the drug addicts runs away he is attacked by shadowy, winged man-creatures and is hit by a train. At Trevor's apartment, Max meets Natasha Sax (Olga Kurylenko), who gets into an argument with her sister, Mona (Mila Kunis). When Natasha storms off, Max searches for her in the back where partiers are using the drug \"Valkyr\". Max is silently confronted by Jack Lupino (Amaury Nolasco), but Natasha takes Max back to the party. Max notices Natasha\u2019s tattoos and wants information about them, so he invites her back to his apartment. However, when Natasha tries to seduce Max, she makes insensitive comments about his wife, and Max kicks her out. Natasha leaves through an alley, and is attacked by the winged shadow creatures.\nThe next morning Natasha is found dead, and Max's wallet is discovered at the crime scene. Max becomes the prime suspect in the case, with his old partner, Alex Balder (Donal Logue), taking part in the investigation. Alex notices the tattoo on Natasha's arm is similar to one found in the case file of Max's wife. Alex tries to contact Max, but getting no response, he quickly leaves for Max's apartment. When Max arrives home, he finds the door ajar and his place a mess. Alex lies dead inside, and as Max investigates, he is knocked unconscious from behind.\nMax wakes up in a hospital with his trusted friend BB Hensley (Beau Bridges), his father's former partner in the NYPD, at his bedside. Hensley is now head of security of the pharmaceutical company Aesir Corporation. Max leaves the hospital early to pay his respects to Alex, but is kicked out by Alex's upset wife Christa (Nelly Furtado). While being questioned by Lieutenant Jim Bravura (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) of Internal Affairs, Max storms out and searches Alex's desk, finding Owen Green's name in Natasha's case file. Later, Max is confronted by Mona, who assumes Max killed her sister, but Max persuades her to help him find the actual killer. Max and Mona find Green (Joel Gordon) but cannot save him, as Owen was hallucinating and as a result falls out of a building to his death.\nMax and Mona visit Natasha's tattoo parlor. The tattoo artist tells them Natasha's tattoo represents the wings of a Valkyrie, which, in Norse mythology, are creatures that decide the fate of warriors in battle. Max then goes to take some of Michelle's belongings out of storage and ends up discovering that documents from when she worked at the Aesir Corporation have gone missing. Max meets BB at a diner and demands the name of Michelle's old supervisor.\nMax interrogates the supervisor, Jason Colvin (Chris O'Donnell), in his office at Aesir and learns that Michelle was associated with a military contract to create super-soldiers using the highly addictive drug Valkyr. Only a few subjects showed positive results; the rest saw hallucinations and eventually went insane, so the project was terminated. Jason agrees to testify, as long as Max protects him. When a skeptical Max asks Jason who he is supposed to be protecting him from, Jason answers: \"The man that killed your wife!\" Max agrees, and starts to escort Jason out of his office, but as they leave, armed Aesir security forces appear and kill Jason.\nMax escapes with the evidence and shows the video to Mona. It explains the Valkyr project; Lupino is a former Marine and his testimony explains that, while taking the drug, Lupino feels invincible, with no side effects (unlike most other test subjects). Max goes to Lupino's hideout, Ragna Rok. While fighting Lupino, Max's defeat appears to be certain until BB arrives and kills Lupino. Max gets knocked unconscious after the brawl as he is leaving the hideout.\nBB explains that he is selling Valkyr and admits to killing Michelle because she inadvertently came across incriminating documents. BB plans to drown Max in the river, with a weight secured to his ankle and Valkyr in his pocket, hoping to make it look like a drug-induced suicide. But before he can be tied to the weight, Max escapes by jumping into the icy river. He swims to shore and, to prevent hypothermia, consumes both vials of Valkyr, transforming himself into a super-soldier with visions of Valkyries. Max follows BB back to the Aesir building. Assisted by Mona, he kills many Aesir security employees. Max eventually confronts BB on the building's helipad and kills him. His vengeance complete, he falls to his knees, ready to die. He sees a vision of his daughter and wife, who tells him \"Not yet, Max.\" He comes to, as the sun cuts through the clouds and a SWAT team surrounds him.\nIn a post-credits scene, Max meets with Mona at a bar, where she shows him a newspaper article about Aesir's soaring stock price, with a picture of CEO Nicole Horne, presumably their next target."}

ERIE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY\n\nCAMERA MOVES THROUGH a tangled jungle of razor wire, finally COMING \nINTO VIEW of a foreboding, fortress-like old institution, surrounded by \ntowers and gun turrets.  Screaming and horrible laughter is heard from \nwithin...\n\nCLOSE ON a sign that reads \"Erie Hospital for the Criminally Insane\" \n... This is where the worst killers and psychos go.\n\nINT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nTHE CAMERA PANS THE EXPRESSIONLESS FACES of the REVIEW BOARD as \nCASANOVA FRANKENSTEIN sits across from them.  Dressed in an \nimmaculately tailored prison smock (with \"Casanova\" exquisitely \nembroidered above the pocket), he sits contritely as DOCTOR EMMET \nBIERCE, the hospital's fatherly Chief of Psychiatry, presents his case.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIERCE\n\t\tNo one can deny the horrendous nature of Mr. \n\t\tFrankenstein's crimes, but in the twenty years \n\t\the has been with us, I have never seen a \n\t\tpatient turn his energies to more productive \n\t\tuse.\n\nCASANOVA, the picture of remorse and repentance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIERCE\n\t\tJust look at his accomplishments... three \n\t\tvolumes of poetry, two rock operas, a sculpture \n\t\tgarden, four romance novels... and who can \n\t\tforget his touching portrayal of Billy Bigelow \n\t\tin our all-psychotic production of \n\t\t\"Carousel\"...\n\nON SEVERAL OF THE BOARD getting misty eyed at the memory of that \nbrilliant performance...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIERCE\n\t\tDirected by our own Doctor Anabel Leek.\n\nON DOCTOR ANABEL LEEK, the hospital's icily beautiful, ultra cool, top \nshrink.\n\nA moment later Casanova addresses them... His manner is charming, \nsincere, his voice soft, filled with emotion.  He is a master of \nseduction.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCASANOVA\n\t\tTwenty years ago I was a lost soul.  \n\t\tLoveless...\n\t\t(with a son-like glance at Doctor Bierce)\n\t\tFatherless...\n\t\t(chokes on the word)\n\t\tA... psycho!\n\t\t(breaks down sobbing)\n\t\tOh!  How could I have done it? The murder... \n\t\tthe mayhem... all of those lovely young girls!\n\t\t(weeping, a brilliant performance)\n\t\tI'm sorry!  I'm SO SO SORRY!\n\nDoctor Bierce wipes the tears from his eyes.  Reactions from the board, \nmoved, as Casanova weeps convulsively.  Doctor Leek shows no reaction.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCASANOVA\n\t\t\t\t(pulls himself together)\n\t\tBut my deeds have been done, and my youth is \n\t\tgone, and we can only go forward in this cruel \n\t\tworld... and if I have learned anything from my \n\t\twretched life it is that... When you walk \n\t\tthrough a storm, keep your head held high...\n\t\t\t\t\t(singing)\n\t\tAnd don't be afraid of the dark...\n\nTears plop dawn the cheeks of the review board as the FULLY \nORCHESTRATED STRAINS OF \"WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH A STORM\" SWELL...\n\nSERIES OF SHOTS - AS THE MUSIC CONTINUES\n\nA hand stamps Casanova's file \"CURED\"... Casanova shakes hands and \nembraces the tearful members of the review board, finishing with a \npaternal hug from Doctor Bierce.\n\nIn his cell a guard delivers Casanova his favorite old disco suit \n(that's been waiting far him for twenty years).\n\nCasanova, dressed in the suit, walks down the central aisle of the \nlock-up... A moment later he steps out of the massive gates of the \nhospital, and takes his first deep breath of freedom... while in an \noffice window high above Bierce and the members of the review board \nstand watching, very proud...\n\nBut suddenly THE MUSIC CHANGES TO SEVENTIES DISCO as a black Ferrari \ndrives up, and Doctor Leek, now dressed very sexily, gets out... As the \nreview board watches in stunned silence, Casanova and Anabel perform a \nnifty little disco twirl, finishing with a very lewd kiss...\n\nBierce, watching, realizes he's been duped... as Casanova, grinning up \nat him, puts a long gold chain (his favorite weapon) around his neck... \nBierce, horrified, picks up the telephone... as Casanova and Anabel get \nin the car.\n\nINT.   THE CAR - A MOMENT LATER\n\nCasanova and Anabel drive off.  The massive old hospital is seen \nthrough the rear window behind them, as Casanova calmly looks at his \nwatch...\n\nCLOSE ON HIS WATCH -\n\nas the second hand just swings toward the twelve.  It is exactly twelve \nnoon...\n\nBACK ON CASANOVA -\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCASANOVA\n\t\t\t\t(almost wistfully)\n\t\tBoom.\n\nAnd the hospital EXPLODES in a HUGE FIREBALL that completely consumes \nit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCASANOVA\n\t\tThose gas leaks can be murder.\n\nEXT.  THE ROAD - DAY\n\nThe Ferrari drives past and the CAMERA HOLDS ON a sign that reads \n\"We1come to Champion City, home of Captain Amazing\". The city itself, a \ncrumbling rust belt metropolis (ala Detroit) can be seen stretched out \nalong the shore of Lake Champion off in the distance...\n\nINSIDE THE CAR - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCASANOVA\n\t\tI'm home.\n\nBACK ON THE ROAD  - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe Ferrari drives under a much larger billboard that looms over the \nroad, showing a picture of Captain Amazing himself, a square jawed \nclassic superhero, staring fiercely into the camera.  The caption reads \n\"Crime.  Don't even think about it.\"\n\nEXT.  TRAIN YARDS OF CHAMPION CITY - NIGHT\n\nLetters read \"Six months later\"...\n\nas the CAMERA EXPLORES the desolate muddy terrain of the train yards, \nCRUISING past piles of tires and abandoned train cars...\n\nCAMERA PICKS UP a battered van as it drives through the yard, then \npulls up beside an old boxcar.  The back of the van is thrown open, a \nramp is thrown down, and THE RED EYES, a gang of vicious small time \nthieves (all of whom wear sunglasses with red lenses) start unloading \ntheir night's haul... RED EYE 1 drives a golf cart, with clubs, down \nthe ramp.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED EYE 1\n\t\tGolf anyone?\n\nSeveral more Red Eyes emerge carrying a sawn off bike rack with bikes \nstill attached, a barber pole, a Virgin Mary lawn statue, and a top of \nthe line baby stroller... while their leader, BIG RED, stands in the \ndoor to the boxcar, watching approvingly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED EYE 2\n\t\tNot a bad night's work.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIG RED\n\t\tWho said crime don't pay?\n\nThe Red Eyes laugh... as Red Eye 3 takes the cover off the baby \nstroller and sees... that there's a BABY still in it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED EYE 3\n\t\tHey, Boss, we got a stowaway.\n\nThe crooks gather around the baby, a jolly little kid who just laughs \nat them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED EYE 4\n\t\t\t\t(about to slug him)\n\t\tWho you laughin' at, punk?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED EYE 2\n\t\tHe's just a tyke.  Lighten up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED EYE 5\n\t\tHe's kinda cute.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED EYE 3\n\t\tIf you like drool.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED EYE 2\n\t\tHey, why don't we sell him back to his parents?  \n\t\tFor a million bucks!\n\nThe others think that's a great idea, but Big Red doesn't.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIG RED\n\t\tAnd what if he rats on us?\n\nThe others hadn't thought of that.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED EYE 3\n\t\tSo what should we do with him?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIG RED\n\t\tStick a brick in his Pampers and dump him in \n\t\tthe lake.\n\nThe others think that's a good idea and look around for a brick.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED EYE 3\n\t\tCome on, kid, you're goin' for a swim.\n\nBut suddenly there is another presence... A man in a blue turban and \ncape with the initials \"BR\" on his chest has appeared... He is THE BLUE \nRAJA.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tNot so fast, gentlemen--and I use the term \n\t\tloosely... Unhand that youngster...\n\nAnother man steps into the light.  He wears a construction helmet and \nmask.  There is an \"S\" on his chest, and he carries an old shovel.  He \nis THE SHOVELER.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSHOVELER\n\t\tOr you're mulch.\n\nHe brandishes his shovel for effect.  The Red Eyes look at these two, \nhighly amused.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIG RED\n\t\tWhat are you guys supposed to be... \n\t\tsuperheroes?\n\nA third man steps out.  His costume is less dramatic than the others.  \nHe wears only an old leather jacket and a faded, torn shirt with flames \non it, but the fierce look on his face and the atrociousness of his \nhaircut make it very clear that he is the craziest and most dangerous \nof the three.  He is MISTER FURIOUS.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tWe ARE superheroes!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIG RED\n\t\tReally?  Did you mother make those costumes?\n\nThe crooks howl with laughter.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIG RED\n\t\tThis is our territory.  Beat it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tOver YOUR dead body.\n\nBig Red turns to the others and shakes with pretended fear.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIG RED\n\t\t0ooooo, he's scary.\n\nThe Red Eyes laugh, but suddenly, a small silver projectile whizzes \nthrough the air and implants itself in Big Red's backside.  He howls \nwith pain, pulls it out and examines it... It's a silver dessert fork.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIG RED\n\t\tA fork!\n\nThe Raja holds up his hands, each of which hold a spread of silver \nforks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tAnd there's plenty more where that came from.\n\nBig Red gives a shrill whistle, and a dozen more Red Eyes step out of \nan old caboose... including MIKEY, a four hundred pound behemoth.  He \nis eating a container of Ben and Jerry's like it was an ice cream cone, \ntaking huge bites out of it, container and all.\n\nRAJA AND SHOVELER, reacting... Gulp.  This was more than they'd \nbargained for.  But Furious just growls; he's game.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBIG RED\n\t\tGET 'EM!\n\nThe Red Eyes attack... Mister Furious goes into a furious face; his \nhair stands out straight and he rushes right into the oncoming \ncrooks...\n\nA Red Eye takes a swing at the Shoveler--but he simply puts up his \nshovel and lets the crook slug the shovel's pan.  The crook yelps with \npain and shakes his battered hand... as the Raja fends off crooks, \npoking them with salad forks... and the baby sits in his stroller, \nwatching and laughing, really enjoying the show.  (There's no real \nmartial artistry or teamwork here; this is a classic back alley \nbrouhaha.)\n\nBut there's too many of then... The Raja goes down under swinging \nfists... and so does the Shoveler...\n\nFurious holds his own, taking out crooks with powerful lefts and \nrights--until Mikey runs him down like a truck, falling right on top of \nhim and crushing him under his massive weight.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED EYES\n\t\tCrush him, Mikey!... Mash him!... Mush him!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\t\t(barely audible under all that meat)\n\t\tIs that all you got?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED EYES\n\t\tHe wants more!... Squish him!... Finish him \n\t\toff!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\t\t\t\t(faintly)\n\t\tYour mother!\n\nMikey, sweating, bears down... but suddenly, a calm, very authoritative \nvoice is heard.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tVOICE (0.S.)\n\t\tIs there a problem?\n\nEverything suddenly stops, as the Red Eyes look up and see... CAPTAIN \nAMAZING standing on tap of the boxcar, hands on hips, framed in the \nlight at the moon, his biceps bulging, his state of the art physique \nsculpted body armor gleaming in the moonlight, his cape wafting \nheroically in the wind.  He is superhero perfection incarnate.\n\nON THE RED EYES as their viciousness turns instantly to panic...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED EYES\n\t\tIT'S CAPTAIN AMAZING!\n\nBig Red and a couple others try to run for it, but Amazing leaps ca-\nlike off the boxcar and is on them in a flash.  As the baby claps his \nhands in delight, and our three heroes watch in beat-up awe, Amazing \ndeftly takes out the crooks with expert punches and effortlessly \ndelivered elbows and kicks. He is the consumate superhero, and he \ndoesn't even break a sweat.\n\nThe remaining Red Eyes drop to their knees and throw up their hands in \nsurrender.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED EYES\n\t\tWe give!... We're sorry!... We had terrible \n\t\tchildhoods!  (Etc.)\n\nPolice cars and a TV truck come screeching into the train yard... and \nthe scene is suddenly flooded vith light and swarming with cops and \nreporters...\n\nOur three heroes try to approach Captain Amazing (who still looks fresh \nas a daisy).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tNice work, Captain.\n\nBut Amazing just walks past them, ignoring them completely, as if they \ndidn't even exist.  He goes to greet DAWN WONG (Champion City's answer \nto Connie Chung).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAMAZING\n\t\t\t(turning on the old superhero charm)\n\t\tHi. Dawn.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDAWN\n\t\t\t(putty in his hands, pudding in his bowl)\n\t\tLooks like you've done it again, Captain.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAMAZING\n\t\tIt's what I do.\n\nOur heroes just watch, feeling ignored, humiliated.  Furious growls.  \nSuddenly, TWO COPS are accosting them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOP 1\n\t\tOkay, show's over. Move it. On your way.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tWait a minute, Officers. You don't understand--\n\t\twe're superheroes, and we just busted up this \n\t\tgang.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOP 1\n\t\tReally?  Let me guess-you're Towel Head and \n\t\the's...\n\t\t\t\t(meaning the Shoveler)\n\t\tCaptain Pooper Scooper!\n\nThe cops crack up.  Furious growls at them.  The cops yank out their \nnightsticks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOP 1\n\t\tHey!  Move it!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOP 2\n\t\tGet a life!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOP 1\n\t\tAnd leave crime fighting to the real thing!\n\nShoveler and Raja pull Furious away before he gets into real trouble... \nThe cops watch as our three heroes disappear into the night.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOP 1\n\t\tWannabes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOP 2\n\t\tPathetic.\n\nEXT.  THE LAKESIDE DINER - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING\n\nAn inner city greasy spoon.\n\nINT.  THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN\n\non which Captain Amazing, the laughing baby in his arms, is being \ninterviewed by Dawn Wong.  He's playing the cutsy photo op for all its \nworth, gootchy-gooing the kid, etc.  Dawn is creaming.\n\nOur three heroes sit at a booth in the back of the diner, watching the \ntube...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\t\t\t(nursing a sore jaw)\n\t\tHe doesn't miss a trick, does he?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tWhat a jerk--and like nobody knows who he really is!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSHOVELER\n\t\tOh don't start that again--\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tLOOK!\n\nFurious picks up the newspaper on which there is a photo of a good \nlooking guy in a tux at a benefit... The headline reads \"Lance Hunt \nHosts Benefit.\"  He holds the picture up next to the television, so the \nfaces of Lance Hunt and Captain Amazing are side by side.  It is \nobviously the same guy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tHe's Lance Hunt!  Just take off the glasses--\n\t\tand it's him!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tThere's a vague similarity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tA vague similarity?

Weren't you guys ever a kid? \n\t\tDidn't you ever need someone to just give you a \n\t\tchance?\n\nON OUR HEROES, looking around the room... and softening up.\n\nINT.  THE DINER - NIGHT\n\nOur heroes sit at their usual table along with Invisible Boy and a \nweird looking guy in a greasy, stained yellow superhero outfit.  Across \nhis chest in falling off stick on letters it reads \"THE SPLEEN\", and \nthat's exactly who he is.  Furious, the Raja, and Shoveler sit as far \naway from him as possible. He is a totally noxious, hyperactive \nperson... and he is thrilled to be there.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSPLEEN\n\t\tBoy I can't tell you how thrilled I was when \n\t\tyou guys called--You gonna eat that pickle?\n\t\t\t\t   (sucks it in)\n\t\tI've always dreamed of being a member of the a \n\t\treal superhero team--and to have friends--real \n\t\tfriends--I mean guys I could live with--sleep \n\t\twith--die with--eat with...\n\nHe puts the mustard dispenser to his lips and squeezes it straight into \nhis mouth.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSPLEEN\n\t\tI love mustard.\n\nFurious, Raja, and the Shoveler react; they can't believe they've \nactually invited this guy to join their group.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tINVISIBLE BOY\n\t\tSo what exactly is your superpower?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSPLEEN\n\t\tWell, when I was a kid I grew up on Love Canal-\n\t\t-remember that?--and my brothers and I used to \n\t\tgo swimming in it--make Kool-Aid out of it--\n\t\tstuff like that.  Anyway my brothers all died, \n\t\tbut I lived, and I grew all these like weird \n\t\torgans that have never been seen in humans \n\t\tbefore.  So now I can do things like this!\n\nHe leans over the table and lets just a little tiny drop of spittle \ndribble onto the table...\n\nCLOSE ON THE TABLE -\n\nas the spittle burns a hole in the Formica.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSPLEEN\n\t\tCool, huh?\n\nThe Spleen inadvertently gives the tiniest little burp, and our three \nheroes duck out of the way or under the table.\n\n\t\t\t\tFURIOUS, RAJA, & SHOVELER\n\t\tWatch it!... Look out!... Whoa!\n\nThe people in the next booth give a cry of revulsion, put their hands \nto their mouths, and immediately leave.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSPLEEN\n\t\tSorry, sorry.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSHOVELER\n\t\tHey, why don't you just put a cork in it?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSPLEEN\n\t\tI tried that once.  The cork melted.\n\nTHE SAME - AFTER DINNER\n\nOur heroes mull their situation over coffee.  Monica freshens their \ncups.  The Spleen squirts mustard in his coffee.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSHOVELER\n\t\tThere's just not enough of us.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tBut we know they're out there. Hundreds--maybe \n\t\tthousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who \n\t\tdesperately need a cause...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tAnd a social life.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSHOVELER\n\t\tYeah, but how do we get to them?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSPLEEN\n\t\tObscene phone calls?\n\nThey ignore that suggestion.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONICA\n\t\tWhy don't you throw a barbecue?\n\t\t\t(moves off to another table)\n\nON OUR HEROES, realizing that's it.\n\nINT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - NIGHT - WITH MUSIC\n\nInvisible Boy sits at the desk in his room, writing immaculate little \nnotes on small file cards.  (He's made a whole pile of them.)\n\nCLOSE ON THE NOTE -\n\nwhich reads \"Got superpowers?  Want to fight evil?  Then JOIN US and \nlet's PARTY HEARTY!  Beer!  Burgers!  Babes!\"\n\nSERIES OF SHOTS - MUSIC CONTINUES\n\nas our heroes post these notes all over the city, in places where \nlonely superheroes night find them...\n\nThe Raja posts a note on the door of a comic book store...\n\nThe Shoveler posts a note on the bulletin board at a bowling alley...\n\nMr. Furious tapes the note to the cracked glass of a vandalized phone \nbooth...\n\nAt an abandoned drive-in movie theater... Invisible Boy walks through \nthe empty lot, taping a note to each of the old speaker posts...\n\nA White Castle hamburger joint... Inside the pay toilet Spleen is \nscratching something on the wall with a nail. He stops and admires his \nhandiwork, and we see that he has engraved the entire message on the \nwall...\n\nEND MUSIC.\n\nEXT.  SHOVELER'S BACKYARD - DAY\n\nA small, typical working class backyard.  A round, aluminum above \nground pool.  A Weber grill with burgers on it. Unopened packages of \nhamburger rolls.  An old Vic Damon record plays on a boom box.  The \nSpleen floats around on a rubber raft in the pool.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSPLEEN\n\t\tCome on in!  The water's great!\n\nIn fact, the water is turning a yellowish green... The rest of our \nheroes sit around on cheap folding chairs.  No superheroes have shown \nup.  The Shoveler, at the grill, serves burgers to his kids, who stand \nin line waiting for them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBUTCH\n\t\t\t\t(heavy on the sarcasm)\n\t\tGreat picnic, Dad.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEDDIE JR.\n\t\tBig turnout.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tROLAND\n\t\tAre these guys real superheroes?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLENORE\n\t\tThey think so.\n\nThe kids scoff...  A moment later they head back to the house with \ntheir burgers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tROLAND\n\t\tBut where's Captain Amazing?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEDDIE JR.\n\t\tHe wouldn't be caught dead here.\n\nThey go into the house.  No one says anything.  The Shoveler just \nstares at the burgers on the grill.  Vic Damon sings. Furious chugs his \nbeer; he's working himself into a really morose mood.\n\nON THE SPLEEN, munching on a chlorine tablet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSPLEEN\n\t\tHey, these pool mints are delicious!\n\nRaja looks at his watch.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tMaybe there was traffic.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tWho are we kidding?  No one's gonna show.  \n\t\tWe're living in a fantasy!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tINVISIBLE BOY\n\t\tCome on, guys--we're fighting against evil.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tGood or evil, what's the difference?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSHOVELER\n\t\tThere's a big difference.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tI used to believe that.  Now I'm not so sure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tRoy, remember, it is all within your power.  \n\t\tThe only thing that's in your way... is you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tOh shut up.\n\nSuddenly, there is a knock at the gate.  Everyone immediately perks up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tINVISIBLE BOY\n\t\tThey're here!\n\nA moment later they open the gate and see... HALF A DOZEN BURLY GUYS \nwearing various superhero outfits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTHEIR LEADER\n\t\tHey, man, is this the superhero wingding?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tThis is it.  Come on in!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSUPERHEROES\n\t\tAll right!  Party!  (Etc.)\n\nAt first glance these guys seem promising... but their outfits are \ndecidedly improvised: weird goggles and sunglasses, shower curtain \ncapes, baseball caps with beer cans on them.  Their leader holds a \nsqueegee with a long handle... Furious is suspicious.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tI am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTHEIR LEADER\n\t\tI am Squeegee Man, and these are my compadres, \n\t\tthe Invincible Dudes!\n\nThe Invincible Dudes spot the keg.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tINVINCIBLE DUDES\n\t\tWhoa!  Brews!  Party!  (Etc.)\n\nThey go immediately to the keg and start filling beer cups and guzzling \nthem down.  The Raja tries to hand out some forms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tWould you mind filling out these forms; names, \n\t\taddresses, description of superpowers, that \n\t\tsort of thing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tINVINCIBLE DUDES\n\t\tSure, dude.  No problem.  (Etc.)\n\t\t\t(but they just toss the forms away)\n\nON FURIOUS, watching, starting to get pissed off.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tINVINCIBLE DUDE 1\n\t\tHey, man, like where are the babes?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tINVINCIBLE DUDE 2\n\t\tIt said on the card there'd be babes!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tActually we lied about the babes, but there's \n\t\tplenty of burgers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tINVINCIBLE DUDES\n\t\tThat's false advertising!... We came all the \n\t\tway from South Champion, man!  We coulda gone \n\t\tplinking!... We coulda gone bunqee jumping!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSQUEEGEE MAN\n\t\tNo babes.  No peace.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tINVISIBLE DUDES (chanting)\n\t\tNo babes--no peace!  No babes--no peace!  No \n\t\tbabes--no peace!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSQUEEGEE MAN\n\t\tLet's trash the place!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tINVINCIBLE DUDES\n\t\tYeah!\n\nFurious, fed up, confronts Squeegee Man.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tIf you're a superhero, what's your power?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSQUEEGEE MAN\n\t\tI am Squeegee Man.\n\t\t\t(holding it out threateningly)\n\t\tTouch my squeegee... and you die.\n\nThe Invincible Dudes are cracking up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tCan you fly?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSQUEEGEE MAN\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tWanna bet?\n\nEXT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE YARD - CONTINUOUS\n\nas Squeegee Man comes flying--and screaming--over the fence, landing \nnone too gracefully in the front yard.\n\nA beat and his squeegee come flying out after him.  Another beat and \nthe Invincible Dudes come running out the gate in a panic.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tINVINCIBLE DUDES\n\t\tLet's get out of here!... That dude's crazy!\n\nThey take off down the street, running right past a woman, carrying a \nbowling ball bag and dressed in a faded, threadbare old rayon superhero \ncostume with a decidedly fifties flavor. She is THE BOWLER.\n\nEXT.  SHOVELER'S BACKYARD - A MOMENT LATER\n\nOur heroes sit around the patio, dejected, miserable.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOWLER (O.S.)\n\t\tWho died?\n\nThey look up, see her standing there, and aren't quite sure what to \nmake of her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tWho are you?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOWLER\n\t\tI'm the Bowler.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSHOVELER\n\t\tThe Bowler?  I remember him from when I was a\n\t\tkid.  He was killed years ago.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOWLER\n\t\tI'm his daughter.\n\nOur heroes share a look.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSHOVELER\n\t\tLook, honey, being a superhero... it's a\n\t\tguy thing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOWLER\n\t\tReally?\n\nShe takes her bowling ball and spins it on the tip of her finger (like \na Harlem Globetrotter).  For a long moment she just looks at them, \nsmiling.\n\nON THE OTHERS watching, almost mesmerized by the spinning ball...\n\nSuddenly, she gives an ear splitting battle cry and starts swinging the \nball around her in wide ferocious arcs, like a cannibal with a war \nclub--or a twirler on meth, going so fast she almost becomes a blur...\n\nThen, just as suddenly, she stops, aims and rolls her ball... It shoots \nstraight through Invisible Boy's legs...\n\nON A NEATLY PLACED COLLECTION OF PLASTER LAWN DWARVES -\n\nas the ball smashes into then, pulverizing them... It goes into a \nreverse spin, passes through Invisible Boy's legs again, and returns to \nthe Bowler who is holding its bag open for it... The ball rolls in.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOWLER\n\t\tGood ball.\n\nON OUR HEROES, left absolutely speechless.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOWLER\n\t\tIf it could zip up its own bag, then you'd be \n\t\timpressed, right?\n\nShe turns and walks out.  Our heroes share an amazed look, then run \nafter her...\n\nJUST OUTSIDE THE GATE - ON THE BOWLER\n\nwalking away... as Furious catches up with her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tHey... Can I buy you a beer?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOWLER\n\t\tI thought you'd never ask.\n\nShe takes his arm and they all start to walk back into the Shoveler's \nbackyard... but the CAMERA PANS ACROSS THE STREET to the dark place \nbetween two houses, where a MAN WEARING A STRANGE STEEL MASK with a \nfrightening, impassively powerful expression stands in the deep \nshadows, watching them in motionless, predatory silence.  We do not \nknow who he is, and we cannot tell if he is good or evil.\n\nBACK AT THE BARBECUE - A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON\n\nA FADED OLD SNAPSHOT of the original \"The Bowler\" holding a little girl \nin his arms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOWLER (O.S.)\n\t\tHe was more than just a superhero...  He was my \n\t\tfather...\n\nThe others, touched by this, have gathered around the Bowler, who is \nholding the old snapshot in her hand.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOWLER\n\t\tAnd then one day, he didn't come home.  The \n\t\tpolice said it was an accident.  But cargo \n\t\tcontainers don't just fall on people.  He was \n\t\tmurdered... After that I fell apart.  I dropped \n\t\tout of school, became a mud wrestler, married \n\t\tand divorced a jerk.  When my mother died I hit \n\t\tbottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her \n\t\tattic, I found my father's old bowling bag and \n\t\tcostume, almost like he'd left them there for \n\t\tme... and I knew what I had to do.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSHOVELER\n\t\tSo who killed him?\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBOWLER\n\t\tThe Disco Boys.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tYou know something? Those guys are really \n\t\tstarting TO PISS ME OFF!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSHOVELER\n\t\tBut there's still only six of us.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tSO WHAT?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOWLER\n\t\tThat's two more than the Fantastic Four.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tHalf a Dirty Dozen!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSPLEEN\n\t\tTwice the Three Stooges!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tINVISIBLE BOY\n\t\tAnd only one short of the Magnificent Seven.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tAnd you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOWLER\n\t\tHe was cute though.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tBut they all had one thing we haven't got.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSPLEEN\n\t\tGirlfriends?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tA name.  All the great superhero teams have got \n\t\ta fabulous name.\n\nThey all think about it for a moment.  You can almost smell their \nbrains overheating.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOWLER\n\t\tHow about... the Savage Six?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tThe Inscrutable Six?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSPLEEN\n\t\tThe Six Pistols?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSHOVELER\n\t\tThe Exterminators!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tINVISIBLE BOY\n\t\tThe Obliterators!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAJA\n\t\tThe Eradicators!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOWLER\n\t\tThe Emasculators!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSPLEEN\n\t\tWait--I got it!... The Spleen Team.\n\nHe gets beaned by a couple of empty soda cans.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFURIOUS\n\t\tTo hell with a name.  Let's get to work.\n\nMUSIC UP as Furious stands and starts out.  The others stand and follow \nhim... as our heroes form up for their first HEROIC GROUP SHOT.\n\nEXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT\n\nMUSIC CONTINUES as A LITTLE OLD LADY crosses the street, when suddenly \nshe looks up and sees a pair of headlights coming on fast.  An \nimmaculately maintained seventies limo is heading straight for her.\n\nINSIDE THE LIMO - CONTINUOUS\n\nDisco Boys sit in the front.  Casanova, Anabel, and Tony P sit in the \nback, dressed for a night on the town...\n\nThere is a thud as the limo hits the old lady, and everyone in the car \nexplodes into laughter.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTONY P\n\t\tLittle old lady.

When you want something, you \n\t\tjust take it, and if somebody gets in your way, \n\t\tyou kill them... You seem like a very \n\t\tfrustrated guy, Roy.  Unhappy. Unfulfilled.  \n\t\tWhat is it that you've always wanted, always \n\t\tdesired?  Because whatever it is, I can give it \n\t\tto you... Fame?\n\t\t\t\t(snaps his fingers)\n\t\tEasy.  Fortune?

THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe convoy drives up the hill toward an ominous looking structure (that \nwe recognize from the model on the TV interview with Casanova earlier.)  \nA high central tower rises up out of the half completed bulwarks of \nfeatureless concrete. It looks both totally modern and completely \nancient, but a profound sense of evil connects both themes beautifully.\n\nANGLE ON a plaque that reads...  \"Frankenstein Center for the \nPerforming and Non-performing Arts\".\n\nThe gates of the center open, and the convoy passes through.\n\nINSIDE THE TRUCK - A NONENT LATER\n\nInvisible Boy and the Spleen stand listening, waiting, as they feel the \ntruck pull to a stop...\n\nA moment later the gate is pulled opened...

Macy), and The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) attempt to make a name for themselves, but their suspect skills make them ineffective, and they find themselves upstaged by the city's most successful superhero, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear). However, Amazing is finding that his effectiveness at fighting crime has practically made his job obsolete, and without any worthy adversaries remaining (some of them are either dead, in exile, or still in jail), his corporate sponsors are beginning to pull their funding. To create a need for himself, Amazing uses his alter ego, billionaire lawyer Lance Hunt, to argue for the release of insane supervillain Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush). The plan backfires; once reunited with Tony P (Eddie Izzard) and his Disco Boys, Casanova Frankenstein blows up the insane asylum, captures Amazing, and prepares to unleash a doomsday device: the \"Psycho-frakulator\", which lethally bends reality. Mr. Furious, while spying on Casanova Frankenstein's mansion, discovers Amazing's capture and informs the others.\nAfter an unsuccessful rescue attempt, the three realize they need more allies, and through word-of-mouth and try-outs, they recruit Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), The Spleen (Paul Reubens), and The Bowler (Janeane Garofalo). The newly formed team \"assaults\" Casanova, which only succeeds in annoying him and damaging his car. While drunk from celebrating their victory, the team is nearly killed in retaliation by Tony P and the Disco Boys, but they are saved at the last minute by The Sphinx (Wes Studi). The Sphinx trains them, but his methods annoy Mr. Furious \u2013 he has them complete rote team-building exercises and speaks exclusively in platitudes. They also seek out mad scientist Doc Heller (Tom Waits), who specializes in non-lethal weaponry, to equip them for their battle.\nThe group breaks into Casanova's mansion during a gathering of several of the city's gangs; but, while attempting to free Captain Amazing, they inadvertently set off the Psycho-frakulator, killing him instead. Without Amazing, the team despairs of saving the city, but The Shoveler delivers a pep-talk that succeeds in uniting and inspiring them.\nWith new-found purpose, they assault the mansion and, by making effective use of their negligible superpowers and Heller's weapons, manage to subdue most of Casanova Frankenstein's henchmen. Unfortunately, as the heroes approach Casanova Frankenstein, he reveals that he is holding Mr. Furious' girlfriend Monica (Claire Forlani) hostage, and proceeds to activate the Psycho-frakulator, which begins to wreak havoc upon the city. While the team tries to stop the device, Mr. Furious takes on Casanova Frankenstein. After initially taking a beating, Mr. Furious unleashes his inner rage and manages to fight effectively for the first time. He defeats Casanova Frankenstein, who is thrown into the core of the Psycho-frakulator and killed by its reality-bending powers. The rest of the team helps The Bowler use her bowling ball to destroy the device and escape the mansion as it implodes, killing several villains still inside.\nThe team is interviewed by reporters, begging to know their team name. As they argue among themselves, one reporter states \"Well, whatever you may call them, Champion City will forever owe a debt of gratitude to these 'Mystery Men',\" but the others are too busy arguing to hear it."}

FARMLAND - DAWN\n          \n          IN BLACK AND WHITE, A black 1930s Cadillac speeds down       \n          the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland.\n          The road curves sharply ahead - the car accelerates.\n          Ignoring the turn, the Caddy drives directly off the road\n          and through a massive field of emptiness.\n          \n          The car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field.\n          GENERAL BRAT (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and\n          AGENT BLACK SUIT (an agent in a black suit) step out of\n          the car.\n          \n          Although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the\n          General scans his surroundings with concern.\n          \n          TITLE CARD UP: THE PAST                                      \n          \n          Agent Black Suit crouches down and pulls open a METAL\n          HATCH in the ground.

The hallway spills into a\n          hauntingly huge metal room with a lone SCIENTIST standing\n          in the middle. The Scientist immediately begins leading\n          them across the room.\n          \n                                 GENERAL BRAT\n                    When did it start?\n          \n                                 SCIENTIST\n                    At 05:00.

OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS\n          \n          The three men enter a large room divided by a one-way\n          mirror.\n          \n          On their side, numerous SCIENTISTS, utilizing several\n          archaic devices, are busy at work monitoring the subject\n          on the other side of the mirror.\n          \n          The subject: PRIVATE MILLER (22, naive and dutiful) sits\n          at a small table with a microphone on it. Miller raises\n          his hand, REVEALING a smoldering JOINT.\n          \n                                                                    2\n          \n          \n          He takes a long and awkward hit from the joint and bursts\n          into a coughing fit.\n          \n          The scientists begin to scribble profusely as their\n          devices blink manically. General Brat and Agent Black\n          Suit exchange a concerned look. The General lights a\n          cigarette as the Scientist steps up to a small microphone\n          in the corner.\n          \n                                 SCIENTIST\n                           (into microphone)\n                    Private Miller, we are now going to ask\n                    you several questions. How do you feel?\n          \n          His voice booms through large speakers on Miller's side\n          of the room.

Now answer the\n                    question.\n          \n          A door opens beside Private Miller and an AGENT steps out\n          wearing an intricate uniform that resembles an old\n          fashioned diving suit, an air hose leading out the door\n          that he came from. He slowly walks toward the Private,\n          who looks at him in shock.\n          \n                                 SCIENTIST (CONT'D) (O.S)\n                           (through speakers)\n                    Private Miller?

Does that make me their\n                    `inferior'?

Staring at Miller, General Brat grabs a RED\n          PHONE and dials.

He makes a visit to the home of his drug dealer, Saul Silver (James Franco), to buy weed. Saul tells him that he may already know the identity of Dale's next service, Ted Jones (Gary Cole). Dale drives to Ted's house and witnesses Ted and a cop, Officer Carol Brazier (Rosie Perez), shoot a man to death. Dale panics and flees the area, but leaves his roach at the scene which contains a rare strain of marijuana called Pineapple Express. Ted is able to identify the strain and sends his two henchmen, Budlofsky and Matheson (Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson) to dealer Red (Danny McBride), who tells them that he has only sold the pot to Saul.\nDale flees to Saul's apartment and learns that Ted is a dangerous drug lord and could trace the roach back to Saul. Dale and Saul flee into the nearby woods while Ted's henchmen persuade Red to arrange a meeting with Saul. They accidentally fall asleep in Dale's car and wake up to find that they missed their meeting with Red. They leave the woods and arrive at Red's house, hoping to determine whether Ted has linked them with him. Red says Ted isn't after them but Dale realizes that he's lying, and starts a fight that results in Red getting knocked out. They wake Red and question him until he reveals that Ted has discovered who they are and is going to kill them. Dale and Saul decide that they must leave the city.\nIn order to leave town, Dale and Saul sell some Pineapple Express to raise bus fare. However, a police officer named Barber (Cleo King) witnesses Dale and arrests him for selling marijuana. In the back of the cruiser, Dale tries to convince Barber that Carol is corrupt and he had witnessed her with Ted murdering a man. Barber recognizes Brazier and promises him that they will investigate her soon. However, Saul leaps out in front of the police car and hijacks it thinking that Brazier is the one driving. Carol hears a police radio call of Dale's arrest and pursues Dale and Saul in a high-speed chase but they manage to evade her. After an argument with each other about the situation they are in, Dale and Saul go their separate ways. Saul visits his grandmother in an assisted living home but is kidnapped and held hostage in Ted's lair beneath a barn. Dale enlists Red to help him rescue Saul but Red unexpectedly backs out at the last minute and Dale is captured. While Dale and Saul are held hostage, they reconcile with each other and make plans to escape.\nSuddenly, a rival Asian drug gang attacks the barn to avenge a member's death at the hands of Ted and Officer Brazier, the same murder that Dale witnessed. Dale and Saul finally free themselves but are caught by Matheson. Matheson grazes Dale's ear with a gunshot but is disarmed and shot by Saul. Dale and Saul join the fight and a brawl ensues between Dale and Ted. One of the Asians activates a bomb, resulting in Ted's death, and setting fire to the barn. When Budlowski refuses to kill Saul, Matheson emerges from the lair and shoots him in the chest, killing him. He turns around to kill Saul but Red drives through the barn and saves Saul by hitting Matheson with his car. Red is then seemingly shot to death by Carol. When Red's car explodes, it flips over and lands on Carol, killing her. The explosion incapacitates Saul but Dale finds him and carries him out of the burning barn. Red, wounded but still alive, also escapes and reconciles with them. Afterwards they eat breakfast at a diner and talk about their adventure before Saul's grandmother picks them up and takes them to the hospital."}

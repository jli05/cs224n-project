COFFEE SHOP \u0096 MORNING\n\n               A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. \n               It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, \n               there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching \n               on bacon and eating eggs.\n\n               Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The \n               Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, \n               like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're \n               going out of style.\n\n               It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or \n               how old she is; everything she does contradicts something \n               she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is \n               to be said in a rapid pace \"HIS GIRL FRIDAY\" fashion.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm \n                         through doin' that shit.\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         You always say that, the same thing \n                         every time: never again, I'm through, \n                         too dangerous.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         I know that's what I always say. I'm \n                         always right too, but \u0096\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         \u0096 but you forget about it in a day \n                         or two -\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         \u0096 yeah, well, the days of me \n                         forgittin' are over, and the days of \n                         me rememberin' have just begun.\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         When you go on like this, you know \n                         what you sound like?\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         I sound like a sensible fucking man, \n                         is what I sound like.\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         You sound like a duck.\n                              (imitates a duck)\n                         Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, \n                         quack, quack...\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         Well take heart, 'cause you're never \n                         gonna hafta hear it again. Because \n                         since I'm never gonna do it again, \n                         you're never gonna hafta hear me \n                         quack about how I'm never gonna do \n                         it again.\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         After tonight.\n\n               The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in \n               there, back and forth.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                              (with a smile)\n                         Correct. I got all tonight to quack.\n\n               A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.\n\n                                     WAITRESS\n                         Can I get anybody anymore coffee?\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         Oh yes, thank you.\n\n               The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man \n               lights up another cigarette.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         I'm doin' fine.\n\n               The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his \n               smoke.\n\n               The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her \n               coffee.\n\n               The Young Man goes right back into it.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         I mean the way it is now, you're \n                         takin' the same fuckin' risk as when \n                         you rob a bank. You take more of a \n                         risk. Banks are easier!  Federal \n                         banks aren't supposed to stop you \n                         anyway, during a robbery. They're \n                         insured, why should they care? You \n                         don't even need a gun in a federal \n                         bank. I heard about this guy, walked \n                         into a federal bank with a portable \n                         phone, handed the phone to the teller, \n                         the guy on the other end of the phone \n                         said: \"We got this guy's little girl, \n                         and if you don't give him all your \n                         money, we're gonna kill 'er.\"\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         Did it work?\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm \n                         talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in \n                         a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, \n                         not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, \n                         cleans the place out, and they don't \n                         lift a fuckin' finger.\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         Did they hurt the little girl?\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         I don't know. There probably never \n                         was a little girl \u0096 the point of the \n                         story isn't the little girl. The \n                         point of the story is they robbed \n                         the bank with a telephone.\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         You wanna rob banks?\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, \n                         I'm just illustrating that if we \n                         did, it would be easier than what we \n                         been doin'.\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         So you don't want to be a bank robber?\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         Naw, all those guys are goin' down \n                         the same road, either dead or servin' \n                         twenty.\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         And no more liquor stores?\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         What have we been talking about? \n                         Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, \n                         it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too \n                         many foreigners own liquor stores. \n                         Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't \n                         fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: \n                         \"Empty out the register,\" and they \n                         don't know what it fuckin' means. \n                         They make it too personal. We keep \n                         on, one of those gook motherfuckers' \n                         gonna make us kill 'em.\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         I'm not gonna kill anybody.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         I don't wanna kill anybody either. \n                         But they'll probably put us in a \n                         situation where it's us of them. And \n                         if it's not the gooks, it these old \n                         Jews who've owned the store for \n                         fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got \n                         Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the \n                         counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try \n                         walkin' into one of those stores \n                         with nothin' but a telephone, see \n                         how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget \n                         it, we're out of it.\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         Well, what else is there, day jobs?\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                              (laughing)\n                         Not this life.\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                         Well what then?\n\n               He calls to the Waitress.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         Garcon!

It's a coffee shop.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         What's wrong with that? People never \n                         rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor \n                         stores, gas stations, you get your \n                         head blown off stickin' up one of \n                         them. Restaurants, on the other hand, \n                         you catch with their pants down. \n                         They're not expecting to get robbed, \n                         or not as expecting.\n\n                                     YOUNG WOMAN\n                              (taking to idea)\n                         I bet in places like this you could \n                         cut down on the hero factor.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         Correct. Just like banks, these places \n                         are insured. The managers don't give \n                         a fuck, they're just tryin' to get \n                         ya out the door before you start \n                         pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget \n                         it, they ain't takin' a bullet for \n                         the register. Busboys, some wetback \n                         gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour \n                         gonna really give a fuck you're \n                         stealin' from the owner.

She also sports rings in \n               her lips, eyebrows and nose.\n\n                                     JODY\n                         ...I'll lend it to you. It's a great \n                         book on body piercing.\n\n               Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen \n               table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is \n               at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.\n\n                                     TRUDI\n                         You know how they use that gun when \n                         they pierce your ears? They don't \n                         use that when they pierce your \n                         nipples, do they?\n\n                                     JODY\n                         Forget that gun. That gun goes against \n                         the entire idea behind piercing. All \n                         of my piercing, sixteen places on my \n                         body, every one of 'em done with a \n                         needle. Five in each ear. One through \n                         the nipple on my left breast. One \n                         through my right nostril.  One through \n                         my left eyebrow. One through my lip. \n                         One in my clit. And I wear a stud in \n                         my tongue.\n\n               Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear \n               and out the other, until that last remark.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                              (interrupting)\n                         Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm \n                         curious, why would you get a stud in \n                         your tongue?\n\n               Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious \n               thing in the world.\n\n                                     JODY\n                         It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.\n\n               That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it \n               makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent \n               to ponder the truth of her statement.\n\n                                     LANCE (O.S.)\n                         Vince, you can come in now!\n\n               INT.

JACKRABBIT SLIM'S \u0096 NIGHT\n\n               In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over \n               L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're \n               all basically the same. Decor out of an \"Archie\" comic book, \n               Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, \n               saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the \n               Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and \n               over prices that pay for all this bullshit.\n\n               But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's \n               diners.\n\n               Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of \n               view.\n\n               Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with \n               a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a \n               red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath \n               the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that \n               is the slogan: \"Next best thing to a time machine.\"\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         What the fuck is this place?\n\n                                     MIA\n                         This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis \n                         man should love it.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.\n\n                                     MIA\n                         You can get a steak here, daddy-o. \n                         Don't be a...\n\n               Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on \n               the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         After you, kitty-cat.\n\n               INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S \u0096 NIGHT\n\n               Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint \n               English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over \n               the wall\n\n               (\"ROCK ALL NIGHT,\" \"HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL,\" \"ATTACK OF \n               THE CRAB MONSTER,\" and \"MACHINE GUN KELLY\"). The booths that \n               the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s \n               cars.\n\n               In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign \n               on the wall states, \"No shoes allowed.\" Some wannabe beboppers \n               (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or \n               barefeet.\n\n               The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, \n               B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The \n               WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons: \n               MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and \n               LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing \n               appropriate costumes.\n\n               Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red \n               '59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting \n               a big button on his chest that says: \"Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing \n               you please me.\"\n\n                                     BUDDY\n                         Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.\n\n                                     BUDDY\n                         How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp, \n                         or bloody as hell?\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         Bloody as hell. And to drink, a \n                         vanilla coke.\n\n                                     BUDDY\n                         How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?\n\n                                     MIA\n                         I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger \u0096 \n                         bloody \u0096 and a five-dollar shake.\n\n                                     BUDDY\n                         How d'ya want that shake, Martin and \n                         Lewis, or Amos and Andy?\n\n                                     MIA\n                         Martin and Lewis.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         Did you just order a five-dollar \n                         shake?\n\n                                     MIA\n                         Sure did.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         A shake? Milk and ice cream?\n\n                                     MIA\n                         Uh-huh.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         It costs five dollars?\n\n                                     BUDDY\n                         Yep.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         You don't put bourbon in it or \n                         anything?\n\n                                     BUDDY\n                         Nope.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         Just checking.\n\n               Buddy exits.\n\n               Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are \n               dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, \n               and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, \n               The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her \n               customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a \n               fool.\n\n                                     MIA\n                         Whaddya think?\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         It's like a wax museum with a pulse \n                         rate.\n\n               Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling \n               himself a smoke.\n\n               After a second of watching him \u0096\n\n                                     MIA\n                         What are you doing?\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         Rollin' a smoke.\n\n                                     MIA\n                         Here?\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         It's just tobacco.\n\n                                     MIA\n                         Oh. Well in that case, will you roll \n                         me one, cowboy?\n\n               As he finishes licking it \u0096\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         You can have this one, cowgirl.\n\n               He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to \n               her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's \n               hand. He lights it.\n\n                                     MIA\n                         Thanks.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         Think nothing of it.\n\n               He begins rolling one for himself.\n\n               As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, \n               making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a \n               square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS \n               the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out \n               a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.\n\n               Back to Mia and Vincent.\n\n                                     MIA\n                         Marsellus said you just got back \n                         from Amsterdam.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         Sure did.

There \n                         was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal \n                         from that show \"Baton Rouge,\" she \n                         was the leader.

But \n                         because she grew up in a circus, she \n                         was also something of an acrobat. \n                         She could do illusions, she was a \n                         trapeze artist \u0096 when you're keeping \n                         the world safe from evil, you never \n                         know when being a trapeze artist's \n                         gonna come in handy.

MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME \u0096 NIGHT\n\n               The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-\n               style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the \n               previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.\n\n               Then...\n\n               The two just stand face to face looking at each other.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         Was than an uncomfortable silence?\n\n                                     MIA\n                         I don't know what that was.\n                              (pause)\n                         Music and drinks!\n\n               Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his \n               overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         I'm gonna take a piss.\n\n                                     MIA\n                         That was a little bit more information \n                         than I needed to know, but go right \n                         ahead.\n\n               Vincent shuffles off to the john.\n\n               Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs \n               and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high \n               energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She \n               dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's \n               overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It \n               feels good.\n\n               Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. \n               Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco \n               on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks \n               the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a \n               little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so \n               anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out \n               his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, \n               trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you \n               know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly \n               brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, \n               then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.\n\n               The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she \n               takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in \n               the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something \n               else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder \n               inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. \n               Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her \n               face.\n\n                                     MIA\n                              (like you would say \n                              Bingo!)\n                         Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, \n                         you've been holding out on me.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) \u0096 NIGHT\n\n               Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to \n               himself in the mirror.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         One drink and leave. Don't be rude, \n                         but drink your drink quickly, say \n                         goodbye, walk out the door, get in \n                         your car, and go down the road.\n\n               LIVING ROOM\n\n               Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines \n               on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred \n               dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the \n               fat line.\n\n               CLOSEUP \u0096 MIA\n\n               Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels \n               like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. \n               Then... the rush hits...\n\n               BATHROOM\n\n               Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his \n               dialogue with the mirror.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         ...It's a moral test of yourself, \n                         whether or not you can maintain \n                         loyalty. Because when people are \n                         loyal to each other, that's very \n                         meaningful.\n\n               LIVING ROOM\n\n               Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but \n               it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from \n               her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her \n               stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.\n\n               BATHROOM\n\n               Vince continues.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         So you're gonna go out there, drink \n                         your drink, say \"Goodnight, I've had \n                         a very lovely evening,\" go home, and \n                         jack off.  And that's all you're \n                         gonna do.\n\n               Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's \n               ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of \n               that door. So he goes through it.\n\n               LIVING ROOM\n\n               We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to \n               the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like \n               a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are \n               down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the \n               tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her \n               face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. \n               Slack-jawed.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         Jesus Christ!\n\n               Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body. \n               Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck \n               to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.\n\n               Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                              (sounding weird)\n                         Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?\n\n               But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, \n               but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.\n\n               Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                              (to himself)\n                         I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.\n                              (to Mia)\n                         Mia!

He SLAPS her face hard.\n\n               Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the \n               rack.\n\n               He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent \n               makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                              (yelling to Mia)\n                         Okay honey, we're getting you on \n                         your feet.\n\n               He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.\n\n                                     VINCENT\n                         We're on our feet now, and now we're \n                         gonna talk out to the car. Here we \n                         go, watch us walk.\n\n               We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-\n               unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.\n\n               EXT.

Now do you \n                         remember when I told you your daddy \n                         dies in a P.O.W. camp?\n\n                                     BUTCH (O.S.)\n                         Uh-huh.\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         Well this here is Capt. Koons. He \n                         was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.\n\n               CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and \n               bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's \n               eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas \n               accent.\n\n                                     CAPT. KOONS\n                         Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard \n                         a bunch about you. See, I was a good \n                         friend of your Daddy's. We were in \n                         that Hanoi pit of hell over five \n                         years together.  Hopefully, you'll \n                         never have to experience this \n                         yourself, but when two men are in a \n                         situation like me and your Daddy \n                         were, for as long as we were, you \n                         take on certain responsibilities of \n                         the other. If it had been me who had \n                         not made it, Major Coolidge would be \n                         talkin' right now to my son Jim. But \n                         the way it worked out is I'm talkin' \n                         to you, Butch. I got somethin' for \n                         ya.\n\n               The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.\n\n                                     CAPT. KOONS\n                         This watch I got here was first \n                         purchased by your great-granddaddy. \n                         It was bought during the First World \n                         War in a little general store in \n                         Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought \n                         by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge \n                         the day he set sail for Paris. It \n                         was your great-granddaddy's war watch, \n                         made by the first company to ever \n                         make wrist watches. You see, up until \n                         then, people just carried pocket \n                         watches. Your great-granddaddy wore \n                         that watch every day he was in the \n                         war. Then when he had done his duty, \n                         he went home to your great-\n                         grandmother, took the watch off his \n                         wrist and put it in an ol' coffee \n                         can. And in that can it stayed 'til \n                         your grandfather Dane Coolidge was \n                         called upon by his country to go \n                         overseas and fight the Germans once \n                         again. This time they called it World \n                         War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave \n                         it to your granddad for good luck.  \n                         Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as \n                         good as his old man's. Your granddad \n                         was a Marine and he was killed with \n                         all the other Marines at the battle \n                         of Wake Island. Your granddad was \n                         facing death and he knew it. None of \n                         those boys had any illusions about \n                         ever leavin' that island alive. So \n                         three days before the Japanese took \n                         the island, your 22-year old \n                         grandfather asked a gunner on an Air \n                         Force transport named Winocki, a man \n                         he had never met before in his life, \n                         to deliver to his infant son, who he \n                         had never seen in the flesh, his \n                         gold watch. Three days later, your \n                         grandfather was dead. But Winocki \n                         kept his word. After the war was \n                         over, he paid a visit to your \n                         grandmother, delivering to your infant \n                         father, his Dad's gold watch. This \n                         watch. This watch was on your Daddy's \n                         wrist when he was shot down over \n                         Hanoi. He was captured and put in a \n                         Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew \n                         if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd \n                         be confiscated. The way your Daddy \n                         looked at it, that watch was your \n                         birthright. And he'd be damned if \n                         and slopeheads were gonna put their \n                         greasy yella hands on his boy's \n                         birthright. So he hid it in the one \n                         place he knew he could hide somethin'. \n                         His ass. Five long years, he wore \n                         this watch up his ass. Then when he \n                         died of dysentery, he gave me the \n                         watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk \n                         of metal up my ass for two years. \n                         Then, after seven years, I was sent \n                         home to my family. And now, little \n                         man, I give the watch to you.\n\n               Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes \n               into FRAME to accept it.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. LOCKER ROOM \u0096 NIGHT\n\n               The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: \n               trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few \n               zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to \n               him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory, \n               he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.\n\n               His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a \n               little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to \n               be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.\n\n                                     KLONDIKE\n                         It's time, Butch.\n\n                                     BUTCH\n                         I'm ready.\n\n               Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB \n               outside.\n\n               He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch \n               hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him \n               on with the robe, which says on the back: \"BATTLING BUTCH \n               COOLIDGE\".\n\n               The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for \n               Butch.\n\n               As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit. \n               Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, \n               empty locker room.\n\n                                                              FADE TO BLACK\n\n               TITLE CARD:\n\n                                     \"THE GOLD WATCH\"\n\n               We hear over the black and white title:\n\n                                     SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)\n                         \u0096 Well Dan, that had to be the \n                         bloodiest and, hands-down, the most \n                         brutal fight this city has ever seen.\n\n               The SOUND of chaos in the b.g.\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               EXT.

But on a \n                         woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The \n                         rest of you is normal.

It's unfortunate what we \n                         find pleasing to the touch and \n                         pleasing to the eye is seldom the \n                         same.\n\n                                     BUTCH\n                         If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in \n                         it.\n\n                                     FABIENNE\n                         You'd punch me in my belly?\n\n                                     BUTCH\n                         Right in the belly.\n\n                                     FABIENNE\n                         I'd smother you.

Obviously, no one is there.\n\n               Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the \n               refrigerator.\n\n               He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.\n\n               With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment.

He \n               opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting \n               down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and \n               puts them in the toaster.\n\n               Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.\n\n               What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun \n               with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.\n\n                                     BUTCH\n                              (softly)\n                         Holy shit.\n\n               He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines \n               it.\n\n               Then... a toilet FLUSHES.\n\n               Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to \n               the kitchen. There is someone behind it.\n\n               Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not \n               knowing what to do.\n\n               The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the \n               bathroom, tightening his belt.

His look \n               goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once \n               Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.\n\n               With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 \n               back on the kitchen counter.\n\n               Then he exits the apartment, quickly.\n\n               EXT.

In their mouths are \n               two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and \n               a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are \n               unconscious.\n\n               Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both \n               guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters.

The basement of \n               the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking \n               in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, \n               all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both \n               share at what they've gotten themselves into.\n\n               Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even \n               more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. \n               The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is \n               a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and \n               stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a \n               long time, then says:\n\n                                     ZED\n                              (to Maynard)\n                         You said you waited for me?\n\n                                     MAYNARD\n                         I did.\n\n                                     ZED\n                         Then how come they're all beat up?\n\n                                     MAYNARD\n                         They did that to each other.

There are zippers, buckles and studs \n               here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather \n               mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. \n               They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large \n               dog.\n\n               Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, \n               then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, \n               then backs away.\n\n                                     MAYNARD\n                              (to The Gimp)\n                         Down!\n\n               The Gimp gets on its knees.\n\n               Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.\n\n                                     MAYNARD\n                         Who's first?\n\n                                     ZED\n                         I ain't fer sure yet.\n\n               Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent \"Eenie, meany, \n               miney, moe... \" just his mouth mouthing the words and his \n               finger going back and forth between the two.\n\n               Butch are Marsellus are terrified.\n\n               Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.\n\n               The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.\n\n               Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving \n               left to right, then it stops.\n\n               TWO SHOT \u0096 BUTCH AND MARSELLUS\n\n               After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on \n               Marsellus.\n\n               Zed stands up.\n\n                                     ZED\n                         Wanna do it here?\n\n                                     MAYNARD\n                         Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old \n                         room.\n\n               Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old \n               room.\n\n               Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the \n               misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. \n               Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and \n               Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the \n               back room, is empty.\n\n               As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before \n               he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.\n\n                                     MAYNARD\n                              (to The Gimp)\n                         Up!\n\n               The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on \n               the ceiling.\n\n                                     MAYNARD\n                         Keep an eye on this one.\n\n               The Gimp bows its head: \"yes.\" Maynard disappears into \n               Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because \n               suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.\n\n               Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath \n               the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history \n               of comedy.\n\n               From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:\n\n                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)\n                         Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight \n                         in 'em!\n\n               We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.\n\n                                     ZED (O.S.)\n                         You wanna fight? You wanna fight? \n                         Good, I like to fight!\n\n               Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, \n               hurriedly struggles to get free.\n\n               The Gimp is laughing wildly.\n\n               The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.\n\n               The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:\n\n                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)\n                         That's it... that's it boy, you're \n                         goin' fine.

Then, quite \n               easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it \n               were never connected by a bolt.\n\n               The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.\n\n                                     THE GIMP\n                         Huhng?\n\n               The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. \n               He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles \n               and grunts.\n\n               Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S \n               PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making \n               him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash \n               attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then \n               silently makes his way through the red curtains.\n\n               INT. PAWNSHOP \u0096 DAY\n\n               Butch sneaks to the door.\n\n               On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected \n               to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he \n               stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their \n               way with Marsellus.\n\n               Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in \n               a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the \n               pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in \n               with.\n\n               He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards \n               it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks \n               about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large \n               Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots \n               what he's been looking for:\n\n               A Samurai sword.\n\n               It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the \n               wall, next to a neon \"DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER\" sign. \n               Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its \n               sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten \n               in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his \n               thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not \n               on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems \n               made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the \n               sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears \n               through the red curtains to take care of business.\n\n               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM \u0096 DAY\n\n               Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.\n\n               Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind \n               the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.\n\n               INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM \u0096 DAY\n\n               Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It \n               swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched \n               positions.\n\n               Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden \n               horse.\n\n               Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.\n\n               Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up \n               behind him with the sword.\n\n               Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, \n               red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see \n               Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.\n\n                                     BUTCH\n                         Hey hillbilly.\n\n               Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.\n\n               Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across \n               the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on \n               Zed.\n\n               Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.\n\n               Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword \n               behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing \n               the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.\n\n               Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go \n               from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, \n               which lies within reach.\n\n               Butch's eyes follow Zed's.\n\n                                     BUTCH\n                         You want that gun, Zed?

Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.\n\n               Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the \n               used shotgun shell.\n\n               Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:\n\n                                     BUTCH\n                         You okay?\n\n                                     MARSELLUS\n                         Naw man.

He climbs aboard, takes out the keys \n               with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog.

That would lead \n                         me to believe that in the garage or \n                         under the sink, you got a bunch of \n                         cleansers and cleaners and shit like \n                         that, am I correct?\n\n                                     JIMMIE\n                         Yeah.

What I need you two fellas to \n                         do is take those cleaning products \n                         and clean the inside of the car. And \n                         I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You \n                         need to go in the backseat, scoop up \n                         all those little pieces of brain and \n                         skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe \n                         down the upholstery \u0096 now when it \n                         comes to upholstery, it don't need \n                         to be spic and span, you don't need \n                         to eat off it. Give it a good once \n                         over. What you need to take care of \n                         are the really messy parts. The pools \n                         of blood that have collected, you \n                         gotta soak that shit up.  But the \n                         windows are a different story.  Them \n                         you really clean. Get the Windex, do \n                         a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to \n                         raid your linen closet. I need \n                         blankets, I need comforters, I need \n                         quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker \n                         the better, the darker the better. \n                         No whites, can't use 'em. We need to \n                         camouflage the interior of the car. \n                         We're gonna line the front seat and \n                         the backseat and the floor boards \n                         with quilts and blankets. If a cop \n                         stops us and starts stickin' his big \n                         snout in the car, the subterfuge \n                         won't last. But at a glance, the car \n                         will appear to be normal.

Blessed is \n                         he who, in the name of charity and \n                         good will, shepherds the weak through \n                         the valley of the darkness.

Vincent says Marsellus has asked him to escort his wife while Marsellus is out of town. They arrive at Brett's place, where they confront him and two of his associates over the briefcase. Vincent finds the briefcase and Jules shoots one of Brett's associates, then delivers a passage from Bible before executing Brett with Vincent.\n\n\nAging champion boxer Butch Coolidge accepts a large sum of money from Marsellus after agreeing to take a dive in his upcoming match.

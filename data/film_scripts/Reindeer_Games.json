One of the \n               body's red-sleeved arms is twisted at a sickening angle. The \n               white snow beneath the figure is spreading with red.\n\n               REVEAL EXT. SNOWY ROAD - NIGHT\n\n               The figure in the suit lies motionless. Snowflakes drift.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               Dark, rustic wood, an office with broken windows and whistling \n               winter beyond. A second BODY in a Santa Claus suit lies dead \n               in the doorway.\n\n               It's a man with a large build. The suit is riddled with holes. \n               His face is missing.\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n               More snow falling. A handful of cars in the lot. A third \n               BODY in the same red-and-white outfit lies atop the hood of \n               an old Pontiac. His head is not visible, having smashed \n               through the windshield. His suit is charred and blackened.\n\n               A halo of broken glass outlines him. His black boots hang \n               off the front bumper. The parking lot is silent.\n\n               INT. ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               A floor scattered with shiny silver quarters. Reflections of \n               neon. There's a fourth SANTA here, face-down in a red pool. \n               The suit is far too big for him. Not that it matters now.\n\n               EXT. SNOW-FILLED RAVINE - NIGHT\n\n               where the fifth and final Santa lies at the edge of a ravine, \n               which plummets a hundred feet down. The man rests precariously \n               atop the slope, upside-down, eyes closed.\n\n               His burned suit is smoldering. He has a sly but tired face, \n               late-20's, sandy hair, cold and scarred. This is RUDY DUNCAN.\n\n               He opens his eyes.\n\n                                     RUDY (V.O.)\n                         I never was much for the holidays.\n\n                                                              CUT TO BLACK:\n\n               THE SOUND OF A WINTER WIND\n\n               rises, as a TITLE appears: \"SEVEN DAYS BEFORE...\"\n\n               And then, to complete the sentence: \"...XMAS.\"\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN STATE PRISON - DAY\n\n               Snow drifts down onto the stone walls and wire fences of the \n               Iron Mountain, Michigan S.I.C. Winter's been here awhile.\n\n               INT. PRISON CELL - DAY\n\n               Rudy Duncan lies in his top bunk, staring at his ceiling -- \n               where a handful of paper-cut snowflakes have been pasted.\n\n               The sounds of YELLING INMATES and GATES slamming shut echo \n               through the fortress. Rudy watches a spider scurry across \n               the paper snow. It's his excitement for the day.\n\n               He turns to the wall, where there's a photo of his teenage \n               self with some co-workers at an auto body shop. And a family \n               photo, cheery Midwesterners, with Rudy a scowling Artful \n               Dodger.\n\n               A WALL CALENDAR\n\n               Shows the dates have been crossed off up to December 18th.\n\n               December 22nd is circled again and again.\n\n               Rudy muses at the calendar, then hops out of his bunk. Drops \n               to the floor, crosses to a desk, finds a chewed-on pen. \n               Turning back to the beds we reveal --\n\n               THE LOWER BUNK\n\n               where Rudy's cellmate, NICK MASON (32), rugged, mustached \n               and well-built, sleeps soundly. In contrast, his bed-wall is \n               a COLLAGE OF PHOTOGRAPHS, twenty, maybe thirty of them. Almost \n               a mural.\n\n               All of them photos of A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL, mid-twenties, \n               smiling out from beaches, parties and snowy scenes. Gorgeous \n               brown hair, heartbreaking smile. Effortlessly sexy.\n\n               RUDY\n\n               stares at the pictures for a moment, wistful. Nick snores, \n               turns over. Rudy climbs atop his bunk again, with the pen \n               this time. And crosses December 18th off the calendar.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY\n\n               The two of them, Nick and Rudy, shivering by the fence. Nick \n               absently whistles some \"Silver Bells,\" then digs for a smoke.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         What's the first thing, man?

Fuckin, \n                         Christmas on the outs.\n\n               Dozens of uniformed INMATES wander the yard, stamping feet, \n               hands tucked away, breath frosting. Nick tries to light his \n               cig, but the wind plays havoc. Nick curses, tosses it.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Hot chocolate.\n\n                                     NICK\n                         What?\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Get a hot mug of chocolate.\n                              (nods)\n                         First thing I'm gonna do.\n\n                                     NICK\n                              (smiles)\n                         And a slice of pecan pie, right?\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         And some pecan pie.\n\n               Nick laughs, stares through the fence at the gates of the \n               prison's entrance road.

His eyes go vacant.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         NO!!!\n\n                                     NICK\n                         ...for Christmas...\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         NICK!!!\n\n               And Rudy's suddenly hauled backwards. A trio of GUARDS \n               descend, grabbing Nick's body as his life fades away. Dragging \n               his figure out of the melee. WHISTLES are blowing.\n\n                                     GUARDS\n                         GET HIM OUT OF HERE! LOCK DOWN!\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         NICK!!!\n\n               Rudy struggles, enraged, and gets blackjacked across the \n               skull for his trouble. He hits the jello-covered floor.\n\n               And the world goes dark.\n\n               INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT\n\n               Darkness and shadows. Rudy sits in a corner, holding his \n               head. The cell block silent for the first time.\n\n               Bootsteps from down the row. A SHADOW falls across Rudy's \n               somber figure. It's the Mean Guard. He stares at Rudy with \n               distinct pleasure.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         The man had two days...\n\n                                     MEAN GUARD\n                         Well. Least he won't be coming back.\n\n               The guard grins a gold tooth. Rudy looks at him --\n\n               -- and then springs to his feet, charges the room, grabbing \n               through the bars. The guard takes a calm step back. Keeps \n               the cruel smile.\n\n                                     MEAN GUARD\n                         You need company tonight, Rudy... \n                         you just give a holler.\n\n               He puckers a kiss and walks on. Starts whistling \"Are You \n               Lonesome Tonight?\" Several shadowed VOICES request that he \n               shut the fuck up. The bootsteps and melody drift down the \n               row.\n\n               RUDY\n\n               turns back, starts toward his bunk. And stops. His eyes on \n               Nick's empty bed. And the wall behind.\n\n               THE PICTURES OF ASHLEY\n\n               Smiling, laughing, playing kissy-face. Hearts drawn on the \n               photos. All colors of stationery taped to the wall.\n\n               RUDY\n\n               takes a seat on Nick's bed. There's a shoebox at the foot of \n               it.\n\n               Rudy opens it. It's filled with Ashley's letters.\n\n               He trails a finger along them, must be over a hundred pages. \n               He selects the one nearest the front. Surveys it.\n\n                                     NICK (V.O.)\n                         Rudy, man, here we go, here, what \n                         she wrote here: \"The car's waiting. \n                         The motel's waiting. And I'm waiting.  \n                         I've waited for so long. I'm burning \n                         for you, Nick. My whole body. My \n                         whole heart. I'm burning for you...\"\n\n               Rudy turns to the wall. To the lakeside picture of Ashley, a \n               swimsuit siren. Rudy stares sadly.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         He was burning for you too...\n\n               And puts the letter away.\n\n               CLOSE ON RUDY'S CALENDAR - NIGHT\n\n               As his hand slashes through December 21st. Prison's over.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN PRISON - DAY\n\n               Snow swirls. Near blizzard conditions. A heavy steel door \n               BANGS open, held by an EXIT GUARD. And FIFTEEN CONVICTS, \n               make that EX-CONVICTS, trudge onto a fenced drive, covered \n               in snow.\n\n                                     EXIT GUARD\n                         Your world and welcome to it, \n                         dumbfucks! Don't be a stranger now! \n                         We'll keep the lights on for ya!\n\n               Rudy stumbles out with the group, shivering in a Goodwill \n               hand-me-down coat. Thin canvas, wouldn't keep him warm in \n               summer.\n\n               Secondhand shoes. No possessions.\n\n               He clutches his sides with his hands, hunched over. All \n               fifteen huddle and herd toward the gate at the end of the \n               fenceway.\n\n               BEYOND THE GATE\n\n               There are a dozen FRIENDS and RELATIVES waiting. A few MEN, \n               several WOMEN, a couple KIDS. Bundled in winter coats, hats \n               and hoods. A prison shuttle bus is parked behind them.\n\n               The released cons reach the gate, where a GATE GUARD unlocks \n               the fence to the outside world. Fifteen men are free.\n\n               The ex-cons and relatives scan each other's faces. Wives \n               rush over to embrace their men. Pals nod to ex-cons and trade \n               slaps on backs. Reunion time.\n\n               The snow batters them, wind whipping. Rudy keeps his head \n               down, leaning forward, keeps walking. Toward the bus. But he \n               can't help himself -- he glances up --\n\n               TO SEE A YOUNG WOMAN\n\n               bundled in a silver ski jacket, pink wool hat with a poofball \n               on top, scarf and mittens. Scanning the released prisoners.\n\n               RUDY\n\n               drops his head, looks away. Climbs onto the shuttle bus.\n\n               INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Rudy shakes his arms, basking in the vehicle's warmth. Takes \n               a seat at the back. A couple other lone ex-cons climb aboard. \n               Then the cons with relatives start to pile in.\n\n               Rudy's window is steamed against the cold. He stares into \n               his lap, then reaches for his coat pocket. Takes out the \n               picture of Ashley, in her bikini by the lake. Stares at it.\n\n               He rubs his window with his sleeve.\n\n               Outside, the woman in the silver coat turns this way and \n               that, troubled. She's watching the other ex-cons climbing \n               onto the bus with their loved ones.\n\n               The woman looks back to the prison. The guard closing the \n               gate. The steel door has been shut. No one else is coming.\n\n               Rudy watches her sadly.\n\n               Aboard the bus, the seats fill up. Ex-cons are feeling up \n               their wives, kids are climbing on their absent daddies, \n               buddies are jawing loudly 'bout how the neighborhood's \n               changed.\n\n               The woman outside is now alone. Silver coat, pink poofball.\n\n               Rudy looks at the bikini picture again.\n\n               Then at the shivering bundle.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Don't do it, Rudy...\n\n               The bus ENGINE starts up. In the seat beside Rudy, an EX-CON \n               makes out with his WIFE while his bratty KID punches his \n               leg.\n\n               Out the window, the young woman is scanning the bus windows. \n               Then the prison again. She turns in a worried circle. Rudy \n               looks swiftly away. Closes his eyes.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Don't do it ...\n\n               The bus door closes. It REVS and starts forward. Rudy sighs \n               with relief. The photo of Ashley falls to the floor.\n\n               EXT. PRISON RELEASE GATE - CONTINUOUS\n\n               The young woman watches the bus pull away, down the snowy \n               road. But it doesn't get fifty feet before it suddenly stops.\n\n               The door opens. And Rudy steps out.\n\n               The bus REVS up again and GROANS OFF into the winter.\n\n               The young woman pushes her poofball hat out of her eyes. We \n               get a look at her face for the first time. Skin pale, lips \n               turning blue, but it's the girl from the pictures. It's \n               Ashley.\n\n               She watches Rudy's figure trudge back toward her. Snow \n               obscuring him until he's right in front of her. Both of them \n               shivering. Both of them standing there.\n\n               And finally:\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         You Ashley?\n\n               Ashley nods. And Rudy sadly smiles.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         I'm Nick.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\n               Rudy and Ashley sit at a coffee shop booth. Coats still on. \n               Big rigs bluster by on the highway outside.\n\n               Two untouched cups of coffee sit before them.\n\n               She's watching him in silence.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         I like your coat.\n\n               Ashley says nothing. Rudy looks at his own:\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         This -- this is just something they \n                         gave me at the door. Wasn't snowing \n                         when we signed up, y'know?\n\n               Ashley nods.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         How's your coffee?\n\n               Ashley looks at it, like she's just realizing it's there. \n               She lifts the cup, takes a sip. Puts it down.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         Good.\n\n               Rudy nods. Silence again.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Gotta be ten degrees out there.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         Radio said negative five.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Negative five?\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         I don't think it's negative five.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         Radio said.\n\n               Beat.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Wind chill. That's probably what \n                         they meant.\n\n               Ashley nods. Rudy bites his lip.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         I was scared.

Instead of \n                         going back to Detroit, maybe we could \n                         go gambling. Y'know?

MOTEL - NIGHT\n\n               Ashley's Chevy Nova pulls back into the lot of the roadside \n               joint. There's an artificial (silver) Christmas tree tied to \n               the roof.\n\n               She and Rudy climb out; she heads for the office:\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to \n                         disturb us for the rest of the year. \n                         I get back in that room, you better \n                         be wearing nothing but a candy cane.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         I'll see what I can do.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         No, lover. I'll see what you can do.\n\n               She smiles, sashays sexily away. Rudy watches her go, admiring \n               his good fortune. Then pops the trunk, collects some of their \n               shopping score. Gifts and goodies.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                              (sings, sotto)\n                         I have no gifts to bring, parum-pum-\n                         pum-pum. No treasures for the king, \n                         pa-rum-pum-pum-pum...\n\n               Loaded down, he struggles to the motel room, balances bags \n               on his knee, gets the key in the door, and heads inside.\n\n               INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Pitch dark. Rudy fumbles his way in:\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         ...but I got a girl to be with, rum-\n                         pum-pum-pum...\n\n                                     MERLIN (O.S.)\n                         Hi, Nick.\n\n               Rudy drops the shopping bags, whirls around, as a stocky \n               black shadow, MERLIN, all 280 pounds of him, KICKS the door \n               shut --\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         What the fuck --\n\n               -- and SWINGS a baseball bat toward Rudy's chest. Rudy gets \n               an arm down to deflect the blow, but it still stings like a \n               mother. Rudy HOWLS. Merlin comes at him again --\n\n               -- and this time Rudy slips by. Merlin's bat SHATTERS a \n               dresser.\n\n               Rudy grabs him by the neck, kicks out his knees and wrests \n               him to the ground. Grabs the bat --\n\n               -- and gets DECKED from behind by another shadow, PUG, a \n               little white guy with a snarl. They go CRASHING onto the \n               bed, grappling for leverage, and then to the floor --\n\n               -- where Rudy grabs a champagne bottle from the groceries \n               and BASHES it backwards, shattering it over Pug's head!\n\n               Pug lets go, as Rudy scrambles up, and Merlin's got him again \n               in a bear hug. Rudy's struggling, whirling with him, crashing \n               into one wall, then another, YELLING for help --\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         HEYYY!!! IN HERE!!! HEYYY!!!\n\n               -- until he hears the PUMP-LOAD SNAP of a shotgun.\n\n               Rudy stops still. A lamp clicks on.\n\n               Standing in silhouette, a figure in a leather duster holds a \n               sawed-off on him.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Welcome home, Nick.\n\n               Another lamp comes on. Rudy, still in Merlin's choke-hold, \n               gets a look at the gunman, GABRIEL. Weathered face, stringy \n               hair, early 30's. Handsome in a scuzzy way. He's seen a lot \n               of road.\n\n               Rudy stares, totally thrown. Pug, the little guy, bad teeth, \n               bad hair, bad skin, gets up spitting blood and champagne.\n\n                                     PUG\n                         I owe ya a drink, ya fuck --\n\n               -- and slugs Rudy in the gut. Merlin yanks him back up. \n               Merlin's a black widebody, wears a goatee and brass knuckles. \n               Behind Merlin stands a fourth intruder, a stone-faced Indian \n               in a Grateful Dead longsleeve. JUMPY. Guarding the door.\n\n               Gabriel's studying Rudy, up and down. Nods. Merlin relaxes \n               his choke-hold so Rudy can breathe.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         You... you don't know me --\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you \n                         real well.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         No, you can't --\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         The hell I can't.\n\n               As the room's door gets kicked open --\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         Watch out, baby! I'm bringing in the \n                         fucking tree!\n\n               and the silver fake evergreen fills the doorway, getting \n               forced through with Ashley's grunts and groans --\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         ASHLEY!\n\n               Merlin traps his jaw shut. The tree comes squeezing through, \n               followed by Ashley, face in branches --\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         I'm telling you, we got the best one \n                         in the store... I don't know why \n                         people want their houses smelling \n                         like the stupid woods...\n\n               She's GRABBED from behind by Jumpy. Ashley screams, but he \n               slams her against the wall. The tree hits the ground.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         NO!\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         NICK!\n\n               Rudy fights to help her, but Merlin's got him. Pug locks \n               Ashley's arms. She fights, muffled cries, but Jumpy and Pug \n               have her held firmly. Her face to the wall --\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                              (re: the silver tree)\n                         Hope her taste in men's better than \n                         her taste in Christmas.\n\n               Ashley's turned to face him. Her eyes widen. Gabriel nods.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Hey, sis. Happy holidays.\n\n               Rudy's jaw drops. He looks to Ashley. Then to Gabriel.\n\n               Ashley YELLS, enraged, kicking and clawing. Jumpy slams her \n               back against the wall for her trouble --\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Jumpy, don't hurt her, now.\n\n               Gabriel steps to Rudy.

Rudy flinches, \n               but Merlin's got him.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         GABRIEL!!!\n\n               Gabriel fixes her with a stare.

There's some packing mats, \n               rope, two tall storage lockers, and Ashley's Chevy Nova.\n\n               Rudy's head is in her lap. He struggles to sit up, finds his \n               wrists tied with cord. He looks at Ashley, follows her gaze.\n\n               In a corner, Pug sits guard in a beanbag chair. He's dipping \n               chewing tobacco, reading Road & Track, headphones on.

Half the year's business, in \n                         one month's time. It seems to me an \n                         intelligent society would legislate \n                         a second such gift-giving holiday, \n                         create, say, a Christmas Two -- late \n                         May, early June -- to further \n                         stimulate growth and prosperity.

Ashley reaches for \n               his hand; he pulls it away.

The sounds of JINGLING and JANGLING return.\n\n               ON FULL SCENE\n\n               An office overlooking the casino floor through smoked glass. \n               JACK BANGS, late 50's, silver-hair, capped teeth, shark suit \n               and high blood pressure, paces his office. He's got the air \n               of a washed-up gameshow host, Wink Martindale, Peter \n               Tommarkin, one of those hacks. Right now he's all caffeine.\n\n                                     JACK BANGS\n                         There's an S-word I'd really like to \n                         throw in the discussion here, guys, \n                         cause it's a big part of what's going \n                         on.

TOMAHAWK - DAY\n\n               Rudy and Ashley move away from a change booth, with a bucket \n               of quarters. Rudy messes with his cowboy getup, noting two \n               SECURITY GUARDS punch a code in a private door, step inside:\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         So does it look a lot different?\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Here and there.

Another SECURITY GUARD walks \n               past them. Rudy turns his back.

That's Mike.\n\n               At the door, Merlin and Jumpy enter, wandering through the \n               slots.\n\n               Rudy sees them.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         You start spending your brother's \n                         money.

In reality, he's surveying the GAMBLERS.\n\n               Passing the cage, he walks right by Jack Bangs and the Indian \n               governors. Jack Bangs is all smiles, while the governors \n               turn their backs an him and storm out.\n\n               ARRIVING AT THE BAR\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Couple rum and Cokes, please.\n\n                                     INDIAN BARTENDER\n                         You want that rum and Coke or rum \n                         and Pepsi?\n\n               Rudy gives him a strange look. The bartender shrugs. Rudy \n               still scans the tables, settling on --\n\n               A BLACKJACK TABLE\n\n               where a trio of COLLEGE KIDS are forking over chips.

A HOLE blasts a shaft of light into the gray-\n               blue. Rudy FIRES again. Another HOLE caves in. Ashley reaches \n               for a sheath of ice, splashing --\n\n               TO THE SURFACE\n\n               -- clutching frozen ground, treading water. Rudy surfaces \n               beside her, the both of them gasping, facing the bridge.\n\n               Instinctively, they spin around --\n\n               TO FIND GABRIEL, MERLIN, JUMPY AND PUG\n\n               -- standing right behind them.

He collapses at Gabriel's \n               feet, unable to stand. Still trembling.\n\n               A couple KIDS scamper into the doorway --\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Game room's closed.\n\n               -- and Merlin slams the door in their face.

Rudy's \n               fingers are half-frozen, they don't bend. Gabriel has to \n               wedge it in.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         May the best sportsman win.\n\n               Gabriel turns to the board, ten feet away, and tosses his \n               dart. It thunks in the \"13\" wedge of the outermost ring.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Damn.\n\n               He steps aside for Rudy. Rudy struggles to raise his hand, \n               trembling badly. He focuses on the board, teeth chattering, \n               tries to reposition his fingers, rears back and throws --\n\n               -- except the dart remains in his frozen grip. He brings his \n               icy hand back, tries to move his fingers. And the dart finally \n               tumbles out and hits the floor at his feet.\n\n               Gabriel smiles, steps close.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Got something to say to me, Nick?\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         ...ttt..tt... two out of three?\n\n               Gabriel grabs his jacket and hurls him backward.

He whistles a dart at Rudy's head. it SMACKS the \n               wall beside his ear.\n\n               He whistles another. It TRUNKS right above his head. A third \n               HITS the wall by his chin.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         He thought I was some gambler... he \n                         didn't know me... he didn't recognize \n                         me!\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         I been driving rigs a long time, \n                         Nick.

But smiles. \n               Rudy smiles back, nods toward the door. Ashley slips out.\n\n               When she's gone, Rudy stands and turns to the window. Outside, \n               the Blazer with the \"Ice Fishermen Do It All Year Long\" bumper \n               sticker still sits parked.\n\n               Rudy reaches for his jeans pocket, and pulls out-one of the \n               game room darts, flecked with blood.\n\n               HE GIVES IT A SOLEMN STARE\n\n               INT. RUDYS ROOM - MOMENTS L&TER - NIGHT\n\n               Rudy lies on his back, under the bed frame, dart in hand. He \n               tears off the plastic feathering, to get at the cross-shaped \n               end, furthest-from the tip. Four protruding metal edges.\n\n               He finds the Phillips screws on the bedframe, and tries to \n               work the dart-end into the grooves. It scrapes and jags, but \n               with pressure he's able to do a quarter-turn at a time.\n\n               The screw starts spiraling out.\n\n               ANGLE ON BEDFRAME\n\n               As two metal pieces split apart, and Rudy wriggles his ankle \n               handcuff off the frame.\n\n               ANGLE ON CLOSET\n\n               As Rudy's hand grabs a paper-covered wire hanger and rips \n               the paper off, untwisting the wire.\n\n               ANGLE ON ROOM'S WINDOW\n\n               As Rudy slides it open, and climbs outside.\n\n               EXT. KNIGHTS INN PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n               Light snow falling. Rudy drops from the second floor window \n               into some snowy shrubs and an empty parking space. He \n               stealthily darts ahead to the ice fishermen's Blazer.\n\n               AT THE FISHERMEN'S BLAZER\n\n               Rudy peers in the windows, spotting fishing rods, tackle and \n               gear boxes in the back seat.\n\n               He takes his wire coat hanger, now stretched straight, and \n               slips it between the driver's window and moulding, jamming \n               it around until it trips the door lock.\n\n               The lock pops up; Rudy pops in --\n\n               INT. BLAZER\n\n               -- and raids the gear box. Bait, reels, fishing wire. Boning \n               knives. A compass. A first aid kit. A switchblade.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Gun, gun, c'mon, boys like you gotta \n                         be keeping a gun...\n\n               He rustles around in the backseat. Ice cooler, open bag of \n               pork rinds, another gear box. Nothing.\n\n               Some HEADLIGHTS sweep past the Blazer. Rudy ducks down, \n               pockets the switchblade. Munches some pork rinds.\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT\n\n               Rudy scrambles out, heads to try another car, a pickup truck. \n               And then suddenly drops to the ground, seeing\n\n               MERLIN AND JUMPY\n\n               stride outside, talking casually, kicking snow on their way \n               toward the Nova. Voices too low to hear.\n\n               ON SCENE\n\n               Rudy crouches behind the pickup, slips around the other side.  \n               Merlin and Jumpy walk right by him.\n\n               Rudy criss-crosses through the parking lot, hidden by cars, \n               heading away from his room's window. His window. Rudy glances \n               back to see if the truckers notice that, but they don't seem \n               to. They stand at the Nova, talking.\n\n               Rudy shivers, waiting. They're not leaving. When their backs \n               turn, Rudy dashes twenty feet to the cover of the building. \n               He slips around the corner, out of sight.\n\n               AROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOTEL\n\n               Rudy hops through snowdrifts, pressed to the wall, moving \n               toward a side entry --\n\n               -- when he stops, hearing a woman's LAUGHTER.\n\n               Above his head are a row of windows. Reflections of rippling \n               water on the ceiling inside. It's the hotel pool behind this \n               wall.\n\n               Sounds of SPLASHES. Murmured VOICES.\n\n               Rudy stands absolutely still. His breaths stop frosting. \n               Because his breathing has stopped.\n\n               INT. HALLLWAY TO INDOOR POOL - NIGHT\n\n               Rudy creeps down the darkened hall, past a sign that reads \n               \"Pool CLOSED. Open 9 am to 9 pm, No Lifeguard on Duty.\"\n\n               Rudy steps closer, back to a wall, standing in shadow. The \n               small pool becomes visible, flickering blue water. From an \n               unseen end, a figure splashes backwards into view --\n\n               It's Ashley. Hair wet, naked beneath the surface. Smiling \n               and splashing someone offscreen --\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         ...and he's saying \"We're not gonna \n                         help him just to walk away.

FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               Rudy strides a corridor, eyes dead ahead, passing a stairwell \n               on his way toward the \"Exit\" sign posted above a door. He's \n               almost there, marching fast --\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Here's my present to you, truck \n                         drivers --\n\n               AS THE EXIT DOOR OPENS\n\n                                     MERLIN (O.S.)\n                         Where the hell's Gabriel?\n\n               -- and Rudy dives to the stairwell, out of sight just as \n               Merlin and Jumpy stride back inside.\n\n                                     JUMPY\n                         With his girlfriend.

STAIRWELL\n\n               Merlin trudges upward, while Rudy steps from hiding one flight \n               down.\n\n               Checks the hall for Jumpy, then races out --\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n               Rudy slams out the side door, scrambling straight for the \n               same Blazer. He jimmies the lock again, leaps in, tears free \n               the engine panel and searches for ignition wires like a pro.  \n               Stripping the plastic, trying to spark contact --\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Catch, dammit, catch! Like riding a \n                         bike, it's like riding a bike!\n\n               But there's nothing. The engine won't start.\n\n               INT. STAIRWELL\n\n               Merlin reaches the second floor, steps into the hall.\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT\n\n               Rudy jumps from the Blazer, looks at the lot, the highway, \n               the woods. His own footprints in the dusting snow.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         How far you gonna get, Rudy...\n\n               Realizing the answer, Rudy looks to his room's window. Forced \n               to race back. He tries clambering the wall, standing an \n               shrubbery, but he can't reach. He whirls, desperate.\n\n               And his eyes find the Blazer.\n\n               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL\n\n               Merlin ambles the corridor. Approaching Rudy's room.\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT\n\n               Rudy flings open the Blazer door, slams the emergency brake \n               down. Forces the gearshift into \"Reverse.\"\n\n               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL\n\n               Merlin reaches Rudy's door. Searches his pockets for the \n               key.\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT\n\n               Rudy darts to the front of the Blazer, slipping and sliding \n               on asphalt ice. He drops to his knees, pushing on the front \n               bumper.\n\n               The wheels start to move.\n\n               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL\n\n               Merlin finds a room key. Puts it in the lock. Turns the handle \n               but the door won't open. Merlin checks the key.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         My room.\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT\n\n               The Blazer starts to roll backwards, toward the snowy shrubs \n               ringing the building. Headed for the empty parking space \n               below Rudy's window. Rudy keeps pushing. The Blazer picks up \n               speed, rolling on its own.\n\n               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL\n\n               Merlin searches his pockets again, finds the right key.\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT\n\n               The Blazer rolls toward the building. Rudy scrambles to his \n               feet, runs after it, leaps his left foot onto the bumper, \n               the right foot onto the hood, then onto the roof --\n\n               -- getting two roof-steps worth of running start --\n\n               -- as the Blazer slows to a rest against the snowy shrubs --\n\n               -- and Rudy dives into the air, torpedoing himself right \n               through the window to his room --\n\n               INT. RUDY'S ROOM\n\n               -- where he crashes headlong to the floor, turning a \n               somersault and landing sprawled across the carpet.\n\n               INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL\n\n               The key in the lock, Merlin hears the crash --\n\n               INT. RUDY'S ROOM\n\n               -- and as Merlin opens the door, he finds Rudy sitting calmly \n               on the floor, ankle-cuff locked once again to the bedframe. \n               Spreading a deck of cards out before him.\n\n               Starting a game of solitaire. He looks up.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Hey.\n\n               Merlin frowns, takes a suspicious look around the room. The \n               window's open. Rudy continues his card game.\n\n               Merlin watches him for a long time. Then pulls the door shut.\n\n               Once he's gone, Rudy collapses to the floor. Breathing hard, \n               heart pounding. The cards go flying.\n\n               INT. RUDY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\n               The LIGHTS go out. Rudy creeps back to the window, checks \n               outside... and stops still. In parking lot...\n\n               ...a cigarette glow burns inside the Nova. From the driver's \n               seat. It's Merlin. Now watching.\n\n               Rudy steps back into the shadows. Closing window and watches \n               the falling snow. Caged again, after all.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. RUDY'S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER\n\n               Pitch dark. Rudy asleep on the floor, as Ashley creeps back \n               in.\n\n               Seeing he's asleep, she lies beside him, pulls a blanket \n               over them both, nestles into his body and kisses him.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         Merry Christmas-Eve, my love.

Turning to look at her \n               smiling, sleeping face... with a convict's vengeful stare...\n\n               INT.

In the b.g., the Ice Fishermen are by their \n               car, wondering how the hell it switched parking spaces \n               overnight.\n\n               Gabriel marches straight to Rudy and SLUGS him in the gut. \n               Rudy hits the snow --\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         Gabriel!\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         That's for the hundred bucks worth \n                         of pay-per-view.\n                              (then KICKS him)\n                         And that's for the two hundred you \n                         took outta your minibar.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                              (chokes, pained)\n                         You guys were paying for the room, I \n                         just figured --\n\n               Gabriel KICKS him again, then pulls a handgun, points it at \n               Rudy's head. Ashley screams, rushes him --\n\n               -- as Gabriel's gun SHOOTS a thin stream of water into Rudy's \n               face.\n\n               It's a forty-five caliber squirt gun.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                              (cruel smile)\n                         You wanted a weapon, convict? You \n                         got one.\n\n               Gabriel tosses the water pistol onto Rudy's chest. Jumpy and \n               Pug haul him up. With venom:\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Merry Christmas-Eve.\n\n               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY\n\n               The Motor City Monster cruises the snowy landscape, with \n               Lake Superior beyond. Pug drives the Nova in convoy.\n\n               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG\n\n               Gabriel hands copies of Rudy's sketched map to Merlin and \n               Jumpy.\n\n               Rudy and Ashley are in the sleeper.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Commit this thing to memory. Every \n                         guard, every exit... don't tape it \n                         to your fuckin, wrist: remember it. \n                         That's the Gospel right there. The \n                         Gospel. Matthew, Mark, Luke and \n                         John...\n\n               Rudy watches them studying his made-up map. Ashley strokes \n               his arm, gives a loving smile. Rudy stares at her.\n\n               He smiles right back.\n\n               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY\n\n               The rig and the Nova blow by a roadsign: \"Now Entering \n               Powahachee Indian Reservation Lands.\"\n\n               INT./EXT. TRAILER DAY - PREPARATION MONTAGE\n\n               The storage locker with the Santa suits SLAMS open.\n\n               Merlin's hands PULL automatics and shotguns from the weapons \n               chest. Pug's hands UNLOAD ammo.\n\n               A red-and-white Santa coat gets PULLED ON and BUTTONED UP.\n\n               Jumpy's hands apportion GUNS and AMMO on a picnic table.\n\n               Black Santa boots STAMP TIGHT in the snow.\n\n               A shoulder-strap ASSAULT RIFLE gets hidden under a Santa \n               coat.\n\n               AMMO CLIPS are taped inside a fat black buckle-belt.\n\n               A HANDGUN gets tucked under a Santa hat.\n\n               And the rig's trailer doors come CRASHING SHUT.\n\n               EXT. LAKESIDE REST AREA - DUSK\n\n               Lake Superior shimmers in the dying light. The rig's in the \n               empty rest area lot. On a nearby bank, four men in Santa \n               Claus suits and one woman without sit scattered at picnic \n               tables, guns at their sides. Staring out at the lake.\n\n               RUDY AND ASHLEY\n\n               sit apart from the rest. Rudy in a red suit, black boots, \n               cap in hand. Ashley's head is in his lap, watching the sky.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         Where should we go, Nick? When we're \n                         gone from here... where should we \n                         go...\n\n               The Nova drives into the lot. Pug gets out, carrying several \n               fast-food bags. Hurrying to stay warm:\n\n                                     PUG (O.S.)\n                         Okay, who had the cheeseburger with \n                         bacon; what about a roast beef, I've \n                         got two roast beefs here --\n\n                                     JUMPY (O.S.)\n                         Cheeseburger 'n bacon's mine --\n\n                                     MERLIN (O.S.)\n                         I got a bacon too; there another \n                         bacon in there?\n\n                                     PUG (O.S.)\n                         I got a bacon for him and a bacon \n                         for me; there's four cheeseburgers \n                         and two roast beefs --\n\n                                     MERLIN (O.S.)\n                         Somebody better give me something \n                         with some goddamn bacon --\n\n               As they continue chow dispersal, Rudy stares over the lake.\n\n               Distant. Not even aware Ashley's there.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         This time right now... Dad's stacking \n                         wood out back, getting ready for \n                         tomorrow. Little blaze in the \n                         fireplace. Mom's setting out the \n                         good silver, hanging her cinammon \n                         sticks, up in the doorways. Getting \n                         out her scratchy old records... \n                         singing along...\n\n               Rudy smiles to himself. He's got a faraway look.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         I don't know where you're going.  \n                         But I'm going home.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         We go together, Nick. Wherever... we \n                         go together. Remember?\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Well. I'm going home.\n\n               GABRIEL\n\n               sits by the water, staring over the lake too. With a white \n               cotton Santa beard resting on his chin. He unwraps his roast \n               beef sandwich, pulls his beard down to his neck, and takes a \n               savage bite.\n\n               Munches away, stares to Rudy and Ashley. She meets his eyes.  \n               Gabriel smiles. And looks again to the water.\n\n               ON FULL SCENE\n\n               The snowy rest stop, the glistening lake. And the six figures \n               scattered, watching day turn to night...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. TOMAHAWK CASINO - NIGHT\n\n               The neon axe lit up in full regalia, with Christmas lights \n               now strung along the building's roof. There are fewer than a \n               dozen cars in the parking lot.\n\n               INT. TOMAHAWK - NIGHT\n\n               Filled with the JINGLING, JANGLING slots, but there's only \n               two FAT WOMEN sitting at them. Three INDIANS at a poker table. \n               An OLD TIMER in his 90's playing blackjack.\n\n               INT. SECURITY LEVEL\n\n               A ragged headquarters, looking down to the casino level \n               through smoked glass. Desks, file cabinets, pin-up \n               centerfolds. A room with video monitors to one side. Stairs \n               to a camera catwalk that rings the casino.\n\n               Jack Bangs is at a table of wassail and cookies. He opens a \n               battle of brandy, pours a bit into the punch, and takes the \n               bottle for himself. Walks over to his HEAD OF SECURITY, \n               watching the lack of activity below:\n\n                                     JACK BANGS\n                         And all through the house... not a \n                         creature was stirring...\n                              (sighs)\n                         Why don't you go ahead and send most \n                         of your guys home, Ed.\n\n                                     SECURITY BOSS\n                         Thanks, Jack. Merry X-mas.\n\n               The boss smiles, heads off. Jack Bangs swigs his brandy, \n               eyes his high-tech security gear glumly:\n\n                                     JACK BANGS\n                         Hell. Nobody even comes here to \n                         cheat...\n\n               EXT. TOMAHAWK - NIGHT\n\n               The Nova pulls into the lot and parks. Merlin, Pug and Ashley \n               inside. On the road, the Motor City Monster slows to an idling \n               stop. In the cab, Gabriel turns to Rudy and Jumpy:\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Go.\n\n               Rudy gives Gabriel a withering look. He and Jumpy climb out.\n\n               Gabriel's rig rumbles up the road.\n\n               [NOTE: All five men, save Ashley, from now till story's end, \n               are in their Santa Claus suits.]\n\n               RUDY AND JUMPY\n\n               make their way across the lot, heading for the entrance.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Hey Jumpy, I want to ask you \n                         something. You have any problem with \n                         the fact that we're on our way to \n                         take millions of dollars from an \n                         Indian casino?\n\n               The Native American considers. As they walk:\n\n                                     JUMPY\n                         Nick. It's true that Indian gaming's \n                         gone a long way toward restoring \n                         wealth and pride to communities who've \n                         been economically isolated and \n                         enslaved for centuries. Stronger \n                         infrastructure, better schools, higher \n                         employment... they're all the results \n                         of reservation casino success stories. \n                         Still, many natives believe that \n                         these are temples to a godless \n                         materialism and greed that will only \n                         infect the souls of indigenous peoples \n                         until their love of money has \n                         destroyed the spiritual values their \n                         ancestors died to protect and their \n                         homelands have become no different \n                         from any United States suburb, \n                         satellite city or industrial park.  \n                         Destroying the Indian legacy once \n                         and for all and leaving behind a \n                         nation of selfish, angry natives, of \n                         which I, it's true, am one --\n\n               -- as they hit the Tomahawk's doors --\n\n               INT. TOKAHAWK - NIGHT\n\n               -- and SLAM inside, stumbling into each other, suddenly \n               LAUGHING and slapping backs.

Jumpy laughs \n               with him, steadying his balance. Drunken and slurred:\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Let's win some MONEY!

He and Pug collect the Guards, \n               weapons.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Cover 'em.\n\n               Rudy gets to his feet, pulls the water pistol from his pocket.\n\n               Moves to round up the Old Timer, the waitress, the Poker \n               Players and the Fat Slots Women.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Sorry, guys.

SECURITY LEVEL\n\n               The two Guards lie on the floor, with Security Boss and Video \n               Guard. And the ruined Jack Bangs.\n\n                                     JACK BANGS\n                         No... not here... please... mister...\n\n               Gabriel storms to the video room's doorway.

SPARKS and METAL fly.\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT\n\n               Ashley waits in the Nova, checking her watch. Behind her a \n               RED WRANGLER rolls in and parks. A FIRE CHIEF and his DEPUTY, \n               just off-duty, stroll toward the casino, laughing.\n\n               Ashley sinks low, panicked. Presses her HORN. The firemen \n               spin around but don't see her. They shrug. Keep walking.\n\n               INT. TOMAHAWK\n\n               Rudy forces the gamblers and employees behind the bar. Onto \n               the floor with Bear the Bartender, whispering hard:\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Get down and stay down, and you're \n                         gonna be fine. Just don't do anything. \n                         My friends are disturbed --\n\n               The hostages do as told. Rudy breathes relief, squirt gun in \n               hand. And then stares at the array of bottles around him.\n\n               IN THE CASHIER'S CAGE\n\n               Merlin and Pug force the cashiers to the floor:\n\n                                     PUG\n                         What's the security code to the Count \n                         Room?\n\n                                     CASHIER #1\n                         Security code?

Just a key lock. Pug BLOWS it away with his guns, \n               kicks the door open --\n\n               -- and gets SHOT TO HELL by three COUNT MEN inside, pistols \n               blazing! Pug puppets, dead. A wad of chaw hits the ceiling.\n\n               Stunned Merlin FIRES BACK.\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT\n\n               -- as the Firemen hear the GUNFIRE, pulling holstered pistols --\n\n               INT. TOMAHAWK\n\n               -- while Merlin dives out of the cage, joining Jumpy, taking \n               cover as the Count Men FIRE AWAY --\n\n               -- as Rudy scrambles back from the bar --\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         You said no GUNS in there! NO GUNS!\n\n               Merlin and Jumpy leap up, GUNS BLAZING, firing through the \n               cage bars at the Count Men. Killing all three just as --\n\n               THE OFF-DUTY FIREMEN\n\n               storm through the doors, pistols ready --\n\n                                     FIREMEN\n                         DROP IT! DROP THE GUNS!\n\n               Merlin and Jumpy are caught. Trade a look. And let their \n               weapons fall, turning just as --\n\n               THE CHEVY NOVA\n\n               CRASHES through the casino doors, MOWING DOWN the firemen!\n\n               The car SLAMS inside, crashing into slot machines. The slots \n               send SPARKS showering into the air. Which set off the casino \n               floor's SPRINKLERS. The room fills with watery spray.\n\n               Ashley swiftly climbs out of the mangled vehicle. Rudy stares \n               darkly at her. She knows he knows. And she doesn't care.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                              (wild-eyed)\n                         WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Yeah. That's love.\n\n               She storms on by. The slots pay off behind her.\n\n               INT. COUNT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\n               Jumpy, Merlin, Ashley and Rudy step inside the Count Room. \n               There are stacks and stacks of bills.\n\n               Ashley smiles wide, throws Jumpy three laundry sacks.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!\n\n               Merlin, meanwhile, slams Rudy against the wall:\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         You knew there were guns in here!\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Merlin, I didn't know --\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         You got Pug killed!

JACK BANGS' OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n               Gabriel stands at the windows overlooking the watery carnage. \n               The taped jingle of slots still plays.\n\n               Poor Jack Bangs lies on his desk, beaten to a pulp. Blood \n               runs down his face and shark suit. Tears and shock:\n\n                                     JACK BANGS\n                         I can't go back to Vegas...

Wow.\n\n               And Jack Bangs opens it --\n\n               -- reaching inside in the same swift motion, so that as the \n               safe swings open to reveal it's a rack of WEAPONS that lies \n               inside, Jack Bangs already has an Uzi in hand --\n\n                                     JACK BANGS\n                         VEEEEGGGGAAAASSSS!!!\n\n               BULLETS as he turns back to the room --\n\n               -- sending Gabriel, Ashley, and Merlin diving for the floor! \n               Jumpy can't get down, as BULLETS riddle him dead --\n\n               -- and BLOW OUT the smoked windows overlooking the casino --\n\n               Jack Bangs keeps turning in a madman's circle --\n\n               -- BLOWING OUT the windows to the parking lot, shattering \n               the liquor, sending Rudy scrambling under his desk --\n\n                                     JACK BANGS\n                         I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! \n                         I CAN'T! GO BACK!\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         GO!!!\n\n               He and Ashley both scramble for the windows, jumping out \n               with two of the money sacks --\n\n               TO THE CASINO FLOOR\n\n               -- and landing on poker tables below, overturning them --\n\n               Jack Bangs keeps FIRING, into the casino, SHREDDING the tables \n               but missing Gabriel and Ashley -- as he JUMPS right after \n               them.\n\n               BACK IN BANGS' OFFICE\n\n               Merlin scrambles to his feet, whirling with his gun, looking \n               for Rudy --\n\n               -- just as Rudy slams into him. Merlin's SHOT hits the \n               ceiling.\n\n               The two of them CRASH down, wrestling and rolling toward the \n               parking lot window. Two guns spill to the floor. Rudy grabs \n               one, just as Merlin kicks out, leaping up --\n\n               -- and freezes, seeing Rudy's got a pistol on him.\n\n               Before Merlin can make a move, Rudy fires --\n\n               -- and a thin stream of water shoots out. Leaving a stain on \n               his shirt. It's the water pistol. Rudy stares blankly.\n\n               As Merlin swiftly snatches the second gun, a real gun, off \n               the floor. Rudy's dead to rights.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Hell. I'm gonna take pleasure in \n                         this...\n\n               With the gun on Rudy, Merlin finds a cigarette in his pockets.\n\n               Pops it between his lips, raises a lighter's flame --\n\n               -- and hesitates. Sniffing the air. Looking down.\n\n               At the stain on his shirt. His lighter still lit --\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Me too.\n\n               -- and Rudy fires the water pistol again, this time catching \n               Merlin's lighter, which turns the stream into a ARC OF FIRE! \n               He's filled alcohol in the gun!\n\n               FLAMING LIQUOR shoots into Merlin's face and eyes. He drops \n               the handgun. Rudy keeps squeezing the squirt gun, spreading \n               the fire down his neck and chest. Merlin howls wildly --\n\n               -- and staggers back, blind and helpless, pinwheeling himself --\n\n               OUT THE PARKING LOT WINDOW\n\n               -- and CRASHING down on the hood of a Pontiac, head through \n               the windshield, boots on the bumper, dead. Flames flickering.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Smoke 'em if you got 'em.\n\n               IN THE CASINO\n\n               Gabriel and Ashley have scrambled to the Nova, tumbling in \n               with the money sacks. Jack Bangs gets up, stalking toward \n               them, still FIRING and babbling.\n\n               Gabriel FIRES back, hitting Bangs in the chest. He staggers, \n               but stays upright. His bullets RIDDLE the car, shattering \n               the windshield, but Gabriel and Ashley keep their heads down, \n               slamming it into reverse --\n\n               -- and burning rubber backwards out the casino entrance, \n               into the parking lot, and speeding out of sight.\n\n               Jack Bangs stops shooting.\n\n               He staggers back toward the bar, totters there, and turns, \n               gun still raised.\n\n               Rudy stands at the base of the stairs to the security level. \n               He puts his hands up, until he sees the dying look in Bangs, \n               face. The uzi drops to the ground.\n\n               A silence. Even the slots have stopped.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         I'm sorry.\n\n               Jack Bangs stares blankly. Surveys the wreckage of his poor \n               man's empire. And gives a small shrug.\n\n                                     JACK BANGS\n                         That's why they call it gambling.\n\n               He slumps against the bar and hits the floor. Dead.\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n               Rudy ambles out into the snowy night. The lot is quiet. He \n               takes a few wary steps toward the road --\n\n               -- and hears a CLICK. He turns to see Ashley standing behind \n               him, with a gun. Shaking her pretty head.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         Your turn.\n\n               Rudy shuts his eyes for the end.\n\n               EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - NIGHT\n\n               The Nova drives up a ramp into the back of the truck, in \n               reverse. Gabriel gets out, pulls shut the trailer. Ashley \n               collects the hazard triangles. They hurry to the cab.\n\n               EXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n\n               The Motor City monster storms through the night, passing a \n               couple POLICE CARS, sirens wailing, speeding the other way.\n\n               INT. GABRIEL'S RIG\n\n               Gabriel and Ashley inside, with the money sacks:\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         With the wrong fucking guy! We took \n                         the place down with the wrong fucking \n                         guy! Is that Christmas?! Huh?! Is \n                         that Christmas?!\n\n               He grabs Ashley, kisses her wildly. Then turns back --\n\n               TO THE SLEEPER COMPARTMENT\n\n               Where Rudy lies sideways, hands bound with his Santa belt.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         God bless us every one...\n\n               EXT. RIDGESIDE ROAD - NIGHT\n\n               A winding two-lane road, overlooking a small ravine at a \n               grassy overlook. The road is dusted with snow; there's been \n               no traffic here for awhile.\n\n               The Motor City Monster steams to a stop beyond the overlook. \n               Then starts backing up, such that the gate of the trailer is \n               fifteen feet from the edge of the ridge.\n\n               A hundred-foot drop into the ravine below.\n\n               Gabriel and Ashley pile out of the cab. They lift the trailer \n               gate, extend the tire ramps. The ramps run from the trailer \n               to five feet away from, the ravine drop.\n\n               IN THE CAB\n\n               Gabriel pulls Rudy out of the sleeper. Marches him back --\n\n               TO THE RAVINE'S EDGE\n\n               -- and gives him a look. Forces him to his knees. Ashley is \n               in the truck trailer, splashing the inside of the Nova with \n               a can of gasoline.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         You almost got away with it, Santa. \n                         Got outta the Tomahawk, got to your \n                         car, got halfway to Canada till you \n                         caught some ice in the road. By the \n                         time you hit bottom down there, whole \n                         car was burning like a comet.  Musta \n                         burned up all that money too.\n\n               Rudy glances to the trailer. Ashley tosses a couple handfuls \n               of bills into the car.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Buncha guys in red suits busted in, \n                         they'll say. Started shooting. They \n                         won't be able to remember... if it \n                         was three, or four... or five. Four \n                         dead Santas and some burned-up cash. \n                         Merry Christmas, The End.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it \n                         hers.\n\n               Gabriel smiles at him.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         She told me 'bout the convict \n                         magazines. Had to figure there'd be \n                         some boys in the pen with some useful \n                         knowledge. With nobody to talk to. \n                         Nobody to listen. So we stocked up \n                         on stationery.\n\n               Ashley hops down. Gabriel puts an arm around her.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Hard life being a trucker's girl.\n\n               Rudy eyes Ashley. She stares darkly back.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         I saved your life.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         You shouldn't have.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         He did love you, you know. Nick. He \n                         did love you.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         Who wouldn't.\n\n               So cold. But Rudy doesn't pause.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Maybe this is where you wanted him, \n                         Ashley. At the bottom of a ravine, \n                         dead as ice with a burnt-up heart. \n                         Maybe. But it didn't happen. 'Cause \n                         what you did for him was make him \n                         the happiest held ever been. You \n                         showed him hope and taught him mercy.  \n                         And he died a peaceful man. You wanted \n                         to destroy some convict... and all \n                         you did was save his soul. Remember \n                         that. Love your money and remember \n                         that.\n\n               Ashley shivers, a touch shaken. But steels herself:\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         Merry Christmas, Rudy.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         I'm glad it was me.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         Merry Christmas.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Get in the car.\n\n               Gabriel hauls him up. Marches him to the trailer. Rudy stops \n               at the ramp. Gabriel pushes. Rudy doesn't move.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Get in the CAR!\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         How'd you know my name...\n\n               He turns back to Ashley.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         What?\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Rudy.

To Ashley:\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         I... you told me your name was Rudy. \n                         You told me a million times, back in \n                         the truck, telling me you weren't \n                         Nick --\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         No --\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         You were screaming you weren't Nick! \n                         And we just didn't fucking believe \n                         you!\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         But I never said Rudy.\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         You said it a million times!\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         I never told you my name.\n\n               He stares her down. Then stares at Gabriel.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Ash?\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         How'd you know my name was Rudy.\n\n                                     GABRIEL\n                         Ash?\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         How'd you know my name.\n\n               Ashley stares daggers. Shakes her head ruefully --\n\n                                     ASHLEY\n                         Men.\n\n               -- and pulls a handgun, SHOOTING Gabriel in the heart.\n\n               Gabriel falls to his knees in the snow, his mouth a ring of \n               shock.

There's a party going on inside; \n               a dining table visible beyond them.\n\n               The Mother and Father's smiles disappear. Shock.

Nick has been corresponding with a young woman named Ashley Mercer, who is waiting for him on the outside. After Nick takes a shiv in a prison fight and dies, Rudy, who just wants to have a cup of hot chocolate after he reunites with his family, takes his place and lets the beautiful Ashley think he is the one who has been writing her. Gabriel, the leader of a gang who assaults Rudy and Ashley in their cabin, and is Ashley's brother and tells \"Nick\" that the gang, with Nick's help, will rob the casino he used to work at. Rudy reveals he is not Nick, but Ashley continues to confirm he is and that she wrote to him knowing Gabriel was going to kidnap and force Rudy to assist in the robbery. Rudy, while furious with Ashley, is reluctantly forced to go along with his ruse.\nUsing the information from the real Nick\u2019s prison cell stories, Rudy is able to devise a robbery plan and informs Gabriel that the biggest loot is hidden inside a safe in the manager\u2019s office (the \"PowWow\" safe). On the night of the robbery, Rudy breaks out of his holding in order to find a way to arm himself as he knows Gabriel will kill him after the robbery. He stumbles upon Gabriel and Ashley and learns that they are lovers and partners in crime.\nThe group robs the casino, each dressed as Santa Claus. Rudy, forced to take part in the robbery, hides the fact that he knows Ashley\u2019s secret. Shots are fired and security guards and Santas are shot. Ashley drives into the Casino and lets Nick/Rudy know she is in on the heist. All meeting in the manager's office, Gabriel introduces Rudy to the casino manager as Nick but the manager recognizes that he isn\u2019t Nick and Rudy confesses. Gabriel, furious at Rudy\u2019s deception, spares him for a moment when he demands to know where the \"PowWow\u201d safe is. When the manager opens the safe, he grabs guns from inside and kills one of the robbers as the rest flee. Rudy kills another one of the robbers and is then grabbed by Gabriel and Ashley who tie him up in their 18-wheeler truck.\nThey plan to drive him off the edge of a cliff in a burning vehicle with a little of the money so that officials will guess all had been burned. After accidentally revealing too much information during an argument with Rudy, Ashley shoots and kills the now suspicious Gabriel. Shortly after, Nick appears, having staged his death at the prison. It is revealed that Ashley's real name is Millie Bobeck and Rudy learns that the two had collaborated to rob the casino using Rudy and Gabriel and his gang. Ashley had known the entire time who Rudy truly was. Nick also informs Rudy that the prison stories were part of a set-up.\nAfter they tie Rudy to the steering wheel to drive off the cliff, he produces a knife he had gotten earlier, cuts his bindings, hot wires the car, sets it to reverse and crushes Nick. With Ashley firing at him, he rams the fiery car into her and dives out as the car and Ashley go over the cliff. Nick tries to convince Rudy that they can share the money but Rudy locks him in the truck and also sends it over the cliff. Rudy picks up the stolen cash and begins distributing it in mailboxes he comes across on the way home to his family, and eats a Christmas dinner with them. The film closes with Rudy smiling."}

Pause.

The four are released from the camp in exchange for assassinating a former Cuban government official at the request of wealthy drug dealer Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia), and they are given green cards. They become dishwashers in a diner.\nFrank's henchman Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham) gives the group the opportunity to purchase cocaine from Colombian dealers, but the deal collapses. Angel is dismembered with a chainsaw, while Manny and Chi-Chi rescue Tony and kill the Colombians. Suspecting that Omar betrayed them, Tony and Manny insist on personally delivering the recovered drugs and money to Frank. During their meeting, Tony is instantly attracted to Frank's girlfriend Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer). He and Manny are hired to work for Frank.\nMonths later, Tony visits his mother Georgina (M\u00edriam Col\u00f3n) and younger sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), of whom he is fiercely protective. Gina is thrilled to see Tony again but Georgina is disgusted by his life of crime and throws him out. Manny comments on Gina's beauty before being warned by Tony to stay away from her.\nFrank sends Tony and Omar to Bolivia to meet with cocaine kingpin Alejandro Sosa (Paul Shenar). Tony negotiates a deal without Frank's approval, angering Omar, who leaves to contact Frank. Sosa claims that Omar is a police informant and then has Tony witness as a beaten Omar is hanged from a helicopter. Tony vouches for Frank's organization, so Sosa agrees to the deal, parting with a warning that Tony should never betray him.\nBack in Miami, Frank is infuriated by Omar's demise and the unauthorized deal struck by Tony, prompting Tony to establish his own organization. He also informs Elvira of his personal interest in her. At a nightclub, corrupt detective Mel Bernstein (Harris Yulin) attempts to extort money from Tony in return for police protection and information. Tony angers Frank further by openly pursuing Elvira in the club. Gina is also there, and Tony notices her dancing and being groped by a man. He angrily confronts Gina before having Manny take her home.\nHit men attempt to assassinate Tony, but he escapes from the club. Tony, Manny, and Chi-Chi go to Frank's office, certain that his former boss sent both Bernstein and the assassins. They find him there with Bernstein. At gunpoint, Frank confesses to his involvement and begs for his life, but he and Bernstein are both killed.\nTony marries Elvira and becomes the dealer of Sosa's supplies. He builds a multimillion-dollar empire, living in a vast, heavily guarded estate. By 1983, however, Tony becomes increasingly paranoid as he and Elvira excessively use cocaine. His money launderer demands a greater percentage, while Manny grows resentful of Tony taking sole credit for their success. A sting by federal agents results in Tony being charged with money laundering and tax evasion. Sosa offers to use his government connections to keep Tony out of jail, but only if Tony first assassinates a journalist intending to expose Sosa.\nLater, Tony pushes his best friend Manny and wife Elvira further away by publically blaming his friend for his arrest and accusing his wife of being infertile because of her excessive drug use. He travels without them to New York City, where he, Chi-Chi, and Sosa's henchman Alberto (Mark Margolis) prepare an ambush. Alberto plants a bomb on the journalist's car, but the intended victim is unexpectedly accompanied by his wife and children, so Tony calls off the mission. Alberto insists on continuing, but Tony becomes enraged and kills him. Returning home, Tony is contacted by Sosa, who is furious and ends their partnership.\nTony goes looking for Manny and Gina, both of whom have been missing for several days. He finds them together with Gina in a state of near-undress, and kills Manny. A devastated Gina tells Tony that she and Manny had just gotten married the day before and were planning to surprise him. Tony returns to his mansion, where he buries his face in a large mound of cocaine. Sosa's men invade the mansion and kill Tony's men. A drugged Gina accuses her brother of wanting her for himself, points a gun at Tony, and wounds him. One of Sosa's men then shoots and kills her. Tony becomes distraught at the sight of Gina's corpse and, in a cocaine-fueled fury, he turns a grenade-launcher-equipped M-16 on Sosa's men, mowing down many. Tony is repeatedly shot, but continues to fight until he is shot in the back. His body falls into a fountain below, in front of a statue reading \"The World is Yours.\""}

But she had an enchantment \n                         upon her of a fearful sort which could \n                         only be broken by love's first kiss. \n                         She was locked away in a castle guarded \n                         by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. \n                         Many brave knights had attempted to \n                         free her from this dreadful prison, \n                         but non prevailed.

One \n               of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's \n               hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head.

(the pixie dust begins \n                         to wear off) Uh-oh.

This way! \n                         Turn!\n \n               Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. \n               Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared \n               for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He \n               quickly hides behind Shrek.\n \n                                     HEAD GUARD\n                         You there.

You and what army?\n\n               He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well \n               and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail \n               and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and \n               begins walking back to his cottage.\n \n                                     DONKEY\n                         Can I say something to you?

She \n               then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off \n               the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep. \n               Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for \n               a moment and she puckers her lips.

Oh!\n \n               Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings \n               toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks \n               up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. \n               He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps \n               Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. \n               Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and \n               roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto \n               her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms \n               a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey \n               take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and \n               then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.\n \n                                     DONKEY\n                         Hi, Princess!\n\n                                     FIONA\n                         It talks!\n\n                                     SHREK\n                         Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's \n                         the trick.\n \n               They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots \n               a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a \n               crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His \n               eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles \n               off and walks lightly.\n \n                                     SHREK\n                         Oh!\n\n               Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.\n \n               \n                                     SHREK\n                         Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll \n                         take care of the dragon.\n \n               Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the \n               castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping \n               chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that \n               is still around the dragons neck.\n \n                                     SHREK\n                         (echoing) Run!\n\n               They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot \n               pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons \n               breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on \n               for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They \n               are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look \n               in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to \n               get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the \n               dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs \n               quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a \n               sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.\n \n                                     FIONA\n                         (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You \n                         did it!

Soft music plays \n               in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic \n               Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.\n \n                                     FARQUAAD\n                         Again, show me again.

Perfect.\n\n               Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up \n               to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly \n               at her image in the mirror.\n \n               MORNING\n\n               Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey \n               who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes \n               across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along \n               with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles \n               to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too \n               big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but \n               she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona \n               is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still \n               sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking \n               in his sleep.\n \n                                     DONKEY\n                         (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like \n                         it like that.

They are walking through the \n               forest.

Suddenly \n               from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into \n               a tree.\n \n                                     ROBIN HOOD\n                         La liberte!

Shrek tells them that he will go ask Farquaad to send them back. He brings along a talking Donkey who is the only fairytale creature who knows the way to Duloc.\nMeanwhile, Farquaad tortures the Gingerbread Man into giving the location of the remaining fairytale creatures until his guards rush in with something he has been searching for: the Magic Mirror. He asks The Mirror if his kingdom is the fairest of them all but is told that he is not even a king. To be a king he must marry a princess and is given three options, from which he chooses Princess Fiona, who is locked in a castle tower guarded by lava and a dragon. The Mirror tries to mention \"the little thing that happens at night\" but is unsuccessful.\nShrek and Donkey arrive at Farquaad's palace in Duloc, where they end up in a tournament. The winner gets the \"privilege\" of rescuing Fiona so that Farquaad may marry her. Shrek and Donkey easily defeat the other knights in wrestling-match fashion, and Farquaad accepts his offer to move the fairytale creatures from his swamp if Shrek rescues Fiona.\nShrek and Donkey travel to the castle and split up to find Fiona. Donkey encounters the dragon and sweet-talks the beast before learning that it is female. Dragon takes a liking to him and carries him to her chambers. Shrek finds Fiona, who is appalled at his lack of romanticism. As they leave, Shrek saves Donkey, caught in Dragon's tender clutches, and forces her to chase them out of the castle. At first, Fiona is thrilled to be rescued but is quickly disappointed when Shrek reveals he is an ogre.\nAs the three journey to Duloc, Fiona urges the two to camp out for the night while she sleeps in a cave. Shrek and Donkey stargaze while Shrek tells stories about great ogres and says that he will build a wall around his swamp when he returns. When Donkey persistently asks why, he says that everyone judges him before knowing him; therefore, he feels he is better off alone, despite Donkey's admission that he did not immediately judge him when they met.\nAlong the way, Shrek and Fiona find they have more in common and fall in love. The trio is almost at Duloc, and that night Fiona shelters in a windmill. When Donkey hears strange noises coming from it, he finds Fiona turned into an ogre. She explains her childhood curse and transforms each night, which is why she was locked away, and that only her true love's kiss will return her to her \"love's true form\". Shrek, about to confess his feelings for Fiona with a sunflower, partly overhears them, and is heartbroken as he mistakes her disgust with her transformation to an \"ugly beast\" as disgust with him. Fiona makes Donkey promise not to tell Shrek, vowing to do it herself. The next morning, Shrek has brought Lord Farquaad to Fiona. The couple return to Duloc, while a hurt Shrek angrily leaves his friendship with Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp, remembering what Fiona \"said\" about him.\nDespite his privacy, Shrek is devastated and misses Fiona. Furious at Shrek, Donkey comes to the swamp where Shrek says he overheard Donkey and Fiona's conversation. Donkey keeps his promise to Fiona and tells Shrek that she was talking about someone else. He accepts Shrek's apology and tells him that Fiona will be getting married soon, urging Shrek into action to gain Fiona's love. They travel to Duloc quickly, thanks to Dragon, who had escaped her confines and followed Donkey.\nShrek interrupts the wedding before Farquaad can kiss Fiona. He tells her that Farquaad is not her true love and only marrying her to become king. The sun sets, which turns Fiona into an ogre in front of everyone in the church, causing a surprised Shrek to fully understand what he overheard. Outraged by Fiona, Farquaad orders Shrek killed and Fiona detained. Shrek whistles for Dragon who bursts in along with Donkey and devours Farquaad. Shrek and Fiona profess their love and share a kiss; Fiona is bathed in light as her curse is broken but is surprised that she is still an ogre, as she thought she would become beautiful, to which Shrek replies that she is beautiful. They marry in the swamp and leave on their honeymoon while the rest celebrate by singing \"I'm a Believer\"."}

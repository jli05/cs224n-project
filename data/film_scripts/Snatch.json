RUSSIA -- NIGHT\n\n\n\n\n      We open on a GUARD sitting in front of a sentry post. He is\n      wearing a heavy fur hat that covers his ears and a military-\n      jacket. Behind him is a list of instructions (in Russian).\n      He 'sucks in a cigarette as though he's a drowning man lookin\n      for oxygen. A CAR comes to a stop by the sentry post, the,\n      guard looks, asks a couple of questions and is given an\n     -envelope which he quickly examines, he then attempts to stick\n      his head in the car. A gun barrel is promptly stuck in his\n      face and a couple of angry words emanate from the back, the\n      guard jumps back and quickly raises the barrier.\n\n\n\n     This next section will be intercut with the credit sequence.\n\n                                      \u00ab\u00b7'\n\n\n2    INT. BACK OF RUSSIAN CAR -- NIGHT\n\n     On the back seat is FRANKY FOUR -FINGERS, (New York street\n     wise Jew) who is clutching a fancy looking briefcase which\n     is handcuffed to his wrist. He is flanked by TWO RUSSIAN\n     HOODS.

The window is wound\n     down and a gun barrel is stuck through.

He flips the case open\n      and pulls out a transparent plastic bag full of American\n      dollars. The package is pulled out of the window, the driver\n      doesn't move, we dissolve for a passage of time, the anxiety\n      is more than obvious, but Four Fingers can do nothing. All\n      of a sudden a package comes through the window and the car\n      speeds off without waiting for an inspection of the delivery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n2   CONTINUED:\n\n    Franky opens the package and he reveals a stone the size of\n    a fist. He shines a torch onto it and puts a stone inspectin\n    monocle to his eye. He's satisfied.\n\n    CUT TO: MUSIC,A CLOSE UP OF THE DIAMOND.

Gorgeous George takes a\n     swipe: it was an .impressive punch, but Micky is a quick littl\n     bastard and sidesteps. Micky does nothing to retaliate; his\n     hands are still by his,side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n20   CONTINUED:\n\n\n\n\n     Gorgeous George lunges out and grabs Micky by the throat and\n     groin, picks him up like a sack of spuds and throws him\n     against the car door. All eyes are on Micky for a second or\n     two, then he rises and appears little bothered by this, he\n     gets up brushes himself off and starts to pace again, hardly\n     even looking at the big man.\n\n                          GORGEOUS GEORGE\n\n              You want to stay down my friend, I\n              promise you, you want to stay down.\n     Micky ignores this and continues to pace, the big fella grabs\n     him and puts him in a headlock and charges him into the stable\n     door.

Micky raises\n     his head there is still no damage to speak of. All of a\n     sudden he starts jumping up and down like he's warming up,\n     throwing a few shadow punches, taking off his shirt. This\n     reveals a heavily tattooed and scarred torso, and underneath\n     these embellishments is a physique that warrants some respect.\n\n                          GORGEOUS GEORGE (CONT'D)\n\n              This is sick.

Vin looks uncomfortable. Another door is\n      opened and a man brings out Lincoln.

I am sure\n                you've heard one or two of those\n                stories. For example, did you hear\n                about the three black fellas that\n                did a very bad thing, however they\n                made some effort to redeem that very\n                bad thing, so the governor saw fit\n                not to kill em. He thought it would\n                be a more advantageous concept to\n                let them kill each other and let the\n                survivor live to tell the tale.\n                That way everybody wins, well, all\n                except the two that died of course.\n      We look at the table where we see three large kitchen knives\n      sitting provocatively. Tyrone rushes for one of the blades\n      grabs it and runs at Vin, Vin sidesteps and Tyrone keeps\n      running straight into the arms of Errol who raises his gun\n      at the last moment. Tyrone slides the blade into Errol 's\n      ribs and Errol fires a shot straight at Tyrone. The bullet\n      passes through Tyrone and hits John in the throat . Vin,\n      Lincoln and Sol are left wondering what the fuck has just\n      happened .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n111   CONTINUED:    (2)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                   BAD BOY LINCOLN      ,\n\n                    Grab it.\n\n\n\n\n                                   SOL\n\n                    What?\n\n\n\n\n                                VINNY\n\n                    The gun you prick.\n      Sol goes for one, and Vin goes for the other.\n\n112   INT.

WAREHOUSE\n\n      Micky appears from a small door at the back of the warehouse.\n      He approaches the ring accompanied with shouts of\n      encouragement and counter shouts. He's wearing a pair of\n      semi cut tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt with grease marks\n      down the front. Turkish walks behind him, Micky still looks\n      bored. He climbs into the ring. Then from the same door as\n      the one through Micky came out walks a larger character with\n      a nose that appears to have seen countless rounds with a\n      frying pan: HORACE 'GOOD NIGHT1 ANDERSON.\n\n                            THE REFF\n\n                Alright lads no eye gouging no biting.\n                Do your worst. Back to your corners.\n\n\n\n      We drift again into Micky's pov, his world is becoming more\n      and more surreal. He can faintly hear Turkish whispering\n      words to him, but he's not really listening. A bell comes\n      from somewhere, and Micky instinctively walks to the center\n      of the ring. \"Good night\" is already there, they pace one\n      another for a second or two, Micky avoids a punch or two and\n      then he takes a hard one and he knows it, we flash to white,\n      Micky's in trouble: he lets one of his missiles go and BANG\n      it shakes \"good night\" to his core, all goes quiet. We go\n      to super slow motion: his knees buckle and \"good night\" is\n      in trouble. Micky maintains a frown as he watches his\n      opponent's knees threaten to betray him. The crowd tries to\n      digest what is happening. After a period of silence reality\n      dawns. Brick Top mouths the words in silence.\"Don1t go down\n      you fucker\". The crowd wants Micky to finish the job. But\n      common sense reins back the coup de grace. \"Good night\"\n      eventually regains control of his legs and stumbles forward,\n      after a few sleepy punches he starts to provide a serious\n      onslaught.\n\n\n\n\n                            TURKISH\n\n                I don't like the look of this Tommy,\n                bring the van up to the back door.\n      This goes on for two rounds (which is montage down to a few\n      seconds). We go in the mind of poor Micky. We break the\n      music just as it's starting to look dangerous... The bell\n      goes and Micky walks to the wrong corner. Turkish pulls him\n      back to his corner.\n\n                            TURKISH (CONT'D)\n\n               They are on ya. You got to hurt him\n               Micky. Otherwise we are\n               rumbled.... you hear me Micky? Do\n               -something, it looks like it' s rigged.\n      Micky goes out again his hands are low, BANG there is a flash\n      of white as Micky goes down in the dirt. Dust rises from\n      where he fell. He gets up quickly, his hands are still low,\n      BANG he goes down again, in no time he's up.\n\n\n\n\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n\n\n\n\n120   CONTINUED:    -\n\n      BANG: he hits the ground again and this time when he hits\n      the deck, he penetrates the dust covered floor, like i t ' s\n      made out of water. He falls through the water like he's\n      sinking; his eyes are open and he can't breathe, he continues\n      to fall, but he's unpanicked (he is now Micky 1). When Micky\n      1 looks up he can see himself in the corner of the ring takin\n      kidney punches from Good Night, he's winded and only semi-\n      conscious (this is Micky 2). Micky 1 makes the effort to\n      swim up and tries to penetrate the floor but he's stuck he\n      can't get through. Micky 2 takes more punishment in the\n      ring, as Micky 1 ' s hand continues to try to break the\n      underside of the floor but it stretches like rubber and forces\n      Micky 1 down again. Micky 1 looks up again and sees how\n      much trouble Micky 2 ' s in the ring. Micky 1 is panicking\n      now, he's running out of oxygen and Micky 2's being beaten,\n      Micky 1 starts -to sink again but now flames tickle the bottom\n      of his feet he looks up. and sees Micky 2 being smashed to\n      hell, his body eventually collapses and Micky 2 falls through\n      the floor. And as the latter falls through, Micky 1 manages\n      to rise from the depths and his punch manages to perforate\n      the surface. The punch continues its trajectory and has the\n      power to fell a red blooded rhino.... it catches \"Good Night\"\n      on the jaw and it's good night for \"Good Night\" it's unlikely\n      that he'll awake in the next hour. Dear oh dear everybody\n      is in trouble.\n\n\n\n      Again we cut to the reactions of the relevant parties.\n\n                               TURKISH (CONT'D)\n\n                   Tommy get the van.\n\n\n\n\n                               TOMMY\n\n                   I have it, it's waiting.\n      Turkish jumps into the ring and grabs Micky.\n\n                               TURKISH\n\n                   We are off Micky, hold tight, and\n                   move quickly. ,\n      Turkish pulls Micky away. It's not as hard as it might be\n      trying to get out, because the crowd seems to have found its\n      own disputes, chairs start to fly. Brick Top's boys are\n      frustrated in the mayhem. Brick Top calmly dials into his\n      mobile telephone. It rings.\n\n                                                                     1\n\n\n121   EXT.

Brick Top opens the door as\n      he is about to get in, he's eyes widen to the size of saucers\n      as FOUR MEN (who we recognize from the wake) are sitting in\n      the place of his driver. They both have sawed-off shotguns\n      and empty four barrels into the chest of Brick Top and Ken.\n      The car spins away, leaving their twitching bodies on the\n      dirt.\n\n                                                                       :\n\n\n122   INT.

There's a sense of relief. He then throws\n      the stone, it cuts through the air. And the dog seeing\n      .another projectile runs to intercept it. There's a pause\n      while all now focus again on the dog. This is digested\n      literally and mentally. The dog recognizes all the attention\n      it's receiving. And goes through the motions of swallowing\n      it. Hands attempts an approach. The dog understandably\n      feels uncomfortable about the advancing vanguard and decides\n      emergency action is needed, and seeing the open window\n      launches itself out of it.\n\n      FADE TO BLACK\n\n\n      FADE UP\n\n\n124   EXT.

One of the other robbers advises Franky to obtain a gun from ex-KGB agent Boris \"The Blade\". Unbeknownst to Franky, Boris and the robber are brothers and plan to steal the diamond from him before he can turn it over to Doug.\nMeanwhile, boxing promoter and slot machine shop owner Turkish convinces gangster \"Brick Top\" to add the boxer \"Gorgeous George\" to the bets at Brick Top's bookies. However, when Turkish sends his partner Tommy and Gorgeous George to purchase a caravan from a group of Travellers, George gets into a fight with Mickey O'Neil, a bare-knuckle boxing champion who badly injures George. Turkish convinces Mickey to replace George in his upcoming match by agreeing to purchase a new caravan for Mickey's mother. Brick Top agrees to the change on the condition that Mickey throws the fight in the fourth round.\nBoris gives Franky a revolver in exchange for a favour: Franky is to place a bet on Boris' behalf at Brick Top's bookies. Avi, knowing Franky has a gambling problem, flies to London with his bodyguard \"Rosebud\" to claim the diamond personally. Boris hires Vinny and Sol, two small-time crooks, to rob Franky while he is at the bookies. The robbery goes awry and Sol, Vinny, and their driver Tyrone are caught on-camera, but manage to kidnap Franky.\nInstead of throwing the fight, Mickey knocks his opponent out with a single punch. Infuriated, Brick Top robs Turkish of his savings and demands that Mickey fight again, and lose this time. Meanwhile, Boris retrieves the diamond and murders Franky with a pistol. As Sol, Vinny, Tyrone, and their friend, Yardie \"Bad Boy\" Lincoln are trying to decide how to dispose of Franky's body, Brick Top arrives to kill them for robbing his bookies. Sol bargains for their lives by promising Brick Top the stolen diamond, and is given 48 hours to retrieve it.\nAvi and Doug hire \"Bullet-Tooth\" Tony to help them find Franky. When the trail leads to Boris, they kidnap him and retrieve the diamond, closely pursued by Sol, Vinny, and Tyrone. Coincidentally Turkish and Tommy are driving on the same stretch of road at the time. When Tommy throws Turkish's carton of milk out of their car window; it splashes over Tony's windscreen, causing him to crash and killing Rosebud in the process. Boris escapes from the wreck only to be hit by Tyrone's car. Tony and Avi are confronted by Sol, Vinny, and Tyrone at a pub where Tony realizes that the trio's pistols are replicas, which he contrasts with his real handgun and intimidates them into leaving. The wounded Boris arrives with an assault rifle with a grenade launcher looking for the diamond back but is shot and killed by Tony. Sol and Vinny escape with the diamond, which Vinny hides in his pants. When Tony catches up to them, they tell him that the diamond is back at their pawn shop. Once there, they produce the diamond, but it is promptly swallowed by a dog that Vinny got from the travelers. Avi fires at the fleeing dog and accidentally kills Tony. He gives up and returns to New York.\nMickey refuses to fight again unless Turkish buys a better caravan for his mother, but Turkish has no money left since Brick Top stole his savings. Furious, Brick Top has his men vandalize Turkish's gambling arcade and burn down Mickey's mother's caravan while she is asleep inside. Mickey agrees to fight to avoid more carnage, but gets so drunk after his mother's wake that Turkish fears he will not make it to the fourth round. If he fails to go down as agreed, Brick Top's men will execute Turkish, Tommy, Mickey, and the entire campsite of travelers. Mickey makes it to the fourth round, when he suddenly knocks out his opponent. Outside the arena, Brick Top and his men are killed by the travelers. Mickey has bet on himself to win, and waited until the fourth round to allow the travelers time to ambush and kill Brick Top's men at the campsite.\nThe next morning, Turkish and Tommy find the travelers campsite deserted. When confronted by the police, they cannot explain why they are there, until Vinny's dog suddenly arrives and they claim to be walking it. Sol and Vinny are arrested when the police find Franky and Tony's bodies in their car. Turkish and Tommy take the dog to a veterinarian to extract a squeaky toy that it had swallowed, and discover the diamond in its stomach, as well. They consult Doug about selling the diamond and he calls Avi, who returns to London."}

LAFORCHE HOME - DAY\r\n\r\n          Sun spikes through the jostling leaves of a maple tree. A\r\n          strong wind bends them back, showing their light green\r\n          bellies.\r\n\r\n          This is a modest house in a row of modest houses. Propane\r\n          tanks and farmland at their backs show this neighborhood to\r\n          be more rural than suburb.\r\n\r\n          CURTIS LAFORCHE(35) stands in his driveway. His eyes, locked\r\n          on the sky, narrow as he stares at...\r\n\r\n          A STORM CELL stretching out on the horizon in front of him.\r\n          It's a bruised sky filled with a vicious mixture of black and\r\n          gray clouds. They swirl in and out of one another sending\r\n          wispy tentacles toward the ground.\r\n\r\n          Curtis stands, awestruck.\r\n\r\n          The clouds move fast overhead. He looks up as they overtake\r\n          his position. A light rain begins.\r\n\r\n          The rain pats the ground. It makes soft indentions on his\r\n          cotton shirt. He watches it hit the concrete, falling harder\r\n          now. He notices something strange.\r\n\r\n          The rain makes dark spots on the sidewalk. He pulls his\r\n          shirt out and sees dark spots forming there. He holds his\r\n          palm out flat in front of him. The rain pools.\r\n\r\n          He rubs the water through his thumb and fingers. It's an\r\n          amber color, viscous, like fresh motor oil.\r\n\r\n          Curtis looks to the sky, the rain pelting his face now.\r\n          Jagged, angry clouds blanketing overhead. The wind bends\r\n          back the trunk of the maple tree.\r\n\r\n          Curtis stands alone at the base of the surging STORM CELL.\r\n\r\n          TITLE: TAKE SHELTER\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. BATHROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Curtis holds his head under the running shower nozzle. Cool,\r\n          clean water rushes over his face.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. KITCHEN - DAY\r\n\r\n          SAMANTHA(29) stands at the stovetop stirring eggs in a pan.\r\n          She's still dressed in her sleeping attire, an oversized T-\r\n          shirt and pajama bottoms with cartoon frogs on them.\r\n          HANNAH(5) sits at the kitchen table tearing up a piece of\r\n          toast and feeding it to the dog.\r\n\r\n           2.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Hannah is a blonde little girl with a large hearing aid\r\n          wrapped over her right ear. It clips into her hair near the\r\n          back of her head. The dog's name is Red, a Rhodesian\r\n          Ridgeback that appreciates the attention.\r\n          Curtis enters the kitchen and kisses Hannah on the head. In\r\n          the same motion, he takes the piece of toast from her hand\r\n          and sets it on her plate.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           (takes a seat)\r\n           No, no, no...Don't feed the dog\r\n           darlin'.\r\n          Hannah immediately picks the piece of toast back up and feeds\r\n          it to the dog. Samantha brings the pan over and spoons eggs\r\n          out on everyone's plates.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Thanks babe.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           You slept late.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Yeah. I need to go. What you got\r\n           going today?\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           I've got to finish up some curtains\r\n           for Saturday, and Nat and Cam are\r\n           coming over.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n\r\n                          (MOUTH FULL)\r\n           With the kids?\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Yeah. Cammie said she just needed\r\n           to get out of the house.\r\n          Samantha takes her seat at the table.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Tell Nat to take it easy on her.\r\n          Curtis gets up and goes to Hannah.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Cam can hold her own. We need to\r\n           send in the deposit for the beach\r\n           condo.\r\n          He kneels beside his daughter's chair and waits for her to\r\n          make eye contact. She looks over at him. He speaks using\r\n          sign language. Three broad, slow gestures.\r\n\r\n           3.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n\r\n                          (SIGNING)\r\n           I love you.\r\n          Hannah puts her arms around his neck and he squeezes her. He\r\n          stands and grabs a sack lunch off the counter. On his way\r\n          out, he kisses Samantha on top of the head.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Just write the check, babe. Okay.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Okay. Bye.\r\n          Samantha sips her coffee as Hannah feeds more toast to the\r\n          dog.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n           (as she signs)\r\n           No more food. You, eat.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY\r\n\r\n          Curtis shoulders his way out the front screen door. Keys in\r\n          his mouth and sack lunch in his hand, he makes his way down\r\n          the porch steps and onto the front walk.\r\n          He pops open the chain-link gate and heads for the PICK-UP\r\n          parked on the street. Clear blue sky overhead.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. SOYBEAN FIELD - DAY\r\n\r\n          Small soybean plants slouch in the noonday sun. A slight\r\n          breeze picks up, jostling the leaves, but the sound is\r\n          drowned out by a loud, mechanical rumbling.\r\n          A spiral drill churns up dark soil as it digs deeper into the\r\n          ground. Curtis, wearing work goggles, grabs hold of the\r\n          drill's cabling system and yanks down.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Yeah, let's keep going with that\r\n           bit! It'll go another 10 feet!\r\n          He yells to DEWART(36), a big guy sitting at the controls of\r\n          a diesel powered WELL-DRILLING RIG. The truck has a long\r\n          rusted bed with metal scaffolding raised HIGH on its back.\r\n\r\n                          DEWART\r\n           We won't get the gravel pack down\r\n           today!\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Why not?!\r\n\r\n           4.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          DEWART\r\n           Those clouds! We're gonna have to\r\n           call it!\r\n          Curtis looks back to a potential STORM. Gray clouds forming\r\n          across the horizon.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Happy hour starts at five Dewart!\r\n\r\n                          DEWART\r\n\r\n                          (TO HIMSELF)\r\n           Not if it's rainin'...Ready?\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Oh, yeah.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY\r\n\r\n          Samantha sits at a table running a long piece of sheer fabric\r\n          through her sewing machine. She's making curtains.\r\n          NAT(37) sips a screwdriver from a clear plastic cup designed\r\n          not to sweat. She's a woman with rough edges.\r\n          CAMMIE(24) cradles a brown-haired BABY on top of her\r\n          pregnant, eight month belly.\r\n          As Nat speaks, she looks out a sliding glass door at her two\r\n          kids, DJ(7) and SUE(5), playing with Hannah.\r\n\r\n                          NAT\r\n           They were just drinkin' and\r\n           laughin' and oh, my god...it was\r\n           like I was bein' in a museum and I\r\n           saw the progress from apes to men.\r\n           I saw it. I saw the future.\r\n           Dewart, that was him...that was\r\n           going to be him in 20 years.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Oh my god.\r\n          Cammie laughs.\r\n\r\n                          NAT\r\n           Let me tell you, you laugh. You\r\n           laugh. But this little one in your\r\n           arms is gonna be shufflin' in a bar\r\n           just like `em. Yep...\r\n\r\n                          (GLANCES OUTSIDE)\r\n           Hannah!\r\n          Samantha jumps up from her sewing to see outside. Hannah,\r\n          with her back to the house, bangs a 2 X 4 with a rusted nail\r\n          in the end into the ground. Samantha is out the door.\r\n\r\n           5.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Samantha walks briskly, talking to the other children.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           You guys okay?\r\n\r\n                          SUE\r\n           Yeah.\r\n          Samantha takes a wide line around Hannah, who continues\r\n          banging the two-by-four into the ground. As soon as the\r\n          child sees her mother, she stops.\r\n          Samantha crouches in front of Hannah, gently taking the board\r\n          away from her. Samantha signs with her hand and speaks at\r\n          the same time.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           No. Don't touch.\r\n          Hannah tilts her head, looking off to the side. Samantha\r\n          touches her chin bringing her eyes back around.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n           (signing and speaking)\r\n           You understand?\r\n          Hannah nods once, \"yes\".\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n           Oksy. Come here.\r\n          Samantha stands and takes the board to a trash pile in the\r\n          back corner of the yard. A STORM SHELTER is buried in the\r\n          ground just behind the pile. It's a grass covered mound with\r\n          two rusted metal doors angled toward the sky.\r\n          She throws the board onto the heap and wipes her hands on her\r\n          pants. Staring at the pile, she lets out an irritated sigh.\r\n          Thunder rumbles low in the distance. She looks up at the\r\n          approaching clouds and calls to the children as she walks\r\n          back inside.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n           Hey, DJ. Bring the girls inside.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. SOYBEAN FIELD - DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n          THUNDER STRIKE.\r\n          The drill bit spins as rain pelts the ground turning the dark\r\n          soil into black mud.\r\n\r\n           6.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Curtis holds a rain slicker over his head. He watches as the\r\n          hole they are drilling fills up with brown water. He lifts\r\n          his boot, which makes a sucking sound as it dislodges from\r\n          the mud.\r\n          Looking at the horizon, he sees no sign of the storm letting\r\n          up. He looks to Dewart, who smiles at him from behind the\r\n          controls of the rig.\r\n\r\n                          DEWART\r\n           What? It's not my fault! I told\r\n           you!\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Yeah. All right...All right! I'm\r\n           callin' it! Shut it down!\r\n          Dewart gladly eases back on the lever at his knee.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          I/E. LAFORCHE HOME - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n          Samantha holds the front door open as Nat and Cammie leave\r\n          with their children packed up and in tow. It's raining\r\n          pretty hard outside.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Bye guys. Thanks for coming over.\r\n\r\n                          NAT\r\n           I'll call next week about the Lions\r\n           Club supper.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Okay.

The\r\n          rain outside is the only noise. She heads to the kitchen.\r\n\r\n          IN THE KITCHEN,\r\n          Hannah is sitting Indian-style at the glass doors watching\r\n          the rain. Samantha walks over and kneels down behind her.\r\n          She wraps her arms around Hannah, who lifts a hand to the\r\n          glass.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n           Can you sign s-t-o-r-m?\r\n\r\n           7.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Samantha puts her hand onto the glass next to Hannah's and\r\n          signs \"s-t-o-r-m\". Hannah turns to see her mother's face,\r\n          and Samantha uses both hands to make the signed symbol.\r\n          Fingers, spread and bent, moved downward.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n           Storm.\r\n          Hannah looks back out the window. They watch the storm\r\n          together.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          I/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/DEWART'S HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n          The blue top of a small cooler is knocked to the floorboard\r\n          as Dewart fishes the last Busch tallboy out of icy water. He\r\n          cracks it open and takes an extended sip.\r\n          Curtis, sitting behind the wheel of his truck, looks at his\r\n          drunk friend.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           I gotta get home.\r\n\r\n                          DEWART\r\n           Nat and me been lookin' into a\r\n           threesome.

She can't be no taller than\r\n           5 foot.\r\n          Dewart starts laughing, which makes Curtis laugh.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Shit man.\r\n          The laughing subsides.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           I don't see me and Sam gettin' into\r\n           somethin' like that.\r\n\r\n                          DEWART\r\n           No. I don't guess you would.\r\n          Dewart is staring at Curtis.\r\n\r\n                          DEWART (CONT'D)\r\n           You got a good life Curtis.\r\n\r\n           8.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Curtis shrugs.\r\n\r\n                          DEWART (CONT'D)\r\n           I'm serious. I think that's the\r\n           best compliment you can give a man,\r\n           take a look at his life and say,\r\n           that's good. That guy's doin'\r\n           somethin' right.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Well. It ain't always so easy.\r\n\r\n                          DEWART\r\n           Hell I know that.\r\n          Dewart sees something out his window.\r\n\r\n                          DEWART (CONT'D)\r\n           Ah shit. I gotta go...Manana.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Good night.\r\n          Nat, in a house robe and slippers, weaves her way through the\r\n          maze of junk on their front lawn.\r\n          Dewart passes her without saying a word. Curtis watches as\r\n          she follows him inside the house, still talking. He shifts\r\n          into drive and pulls away.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. LAFORCHE HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The lights are out and the house is quiet. Curtis eases open\r\n          the front door and steps inside. Standing on the door mat,\r\n          he slips off his mud-caked boots and gently sets them aside.\r\n\r\n          AT HANNAH'S BEDROOM DOOR,\r\n          Curtis places his palm flat on the door and lets it open.\r\n          Hannah is curled up with the covers. He watches her sleep.\r\n          Samantha, barefoot and wearing a sleep shirt, walks up behind\r\n          Curtis. He turns his head when she approaches.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n\r\n                          (SOFTLY)\r\n           Hey baby.\r\n          She wraps her arms around his waist and he lifts his elbow to\r\n          make room for her. They whisper.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           She do all right today?\r\n\r\n           9.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           She was fine. She's still not\r\n           playin' with the others, though.\r\n           She can't connect. Honey, you\r\n           gotta clean up that trash pile in\r\n           the back. She fished out a board\r\n           that had nails on it.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           I'll get to it this weekend.\r\n          It's quiet for a moment.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           I still take off my boots so I\r\n           won't wake her up.\r\n          She smiles up at her husband.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           I still whisper.\r\n          He pulls her tight. They stand together in the doorway. The\r\n          house is silent.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - DAY\r\n\r\n          Curtis loads pieces from the trash pile into a wheelbarrow.\r\n          He keeps an eye on Hannah as she jumps on a small, plastic\r\n          playscape in the middle of the backyard.\r\n          The dog, Red, paces by the back door. He's agitated, but his\r\n          movement is limited by the length of rope tied from his\r\n          collar to a nearby post. He barks.\r\n\r\n          THUNDER STRIKES.\r\n          Curtis flinches at the loud boom. He looks to the sky and\r\n          sees dark clouds twisting overhead. Hannah plays, unaffected\r\n          by the noise.\r\n          To get a better view, Curtis moves from beneath a tree in the\r\n          corner of the yard and surveys the large swath of farmland\r\n          that runs up to his property.\r\n          Chain-link fencing partitions the yard from a deep concrete\r\n          culvert that leads out to the open field.\r\n          A giant STORM CELL gathers force on the horizon there.\r\n          Red barks incessantly. He winces and strains against the\r\n          rope tied to his collar.\r\n          Curtis flinches again as A BOLT OF LIGHTNING streaks to the\r\n          ground in the distance. Sparks shoot into the air leaving a\r\n          circle of scorched crops. Another CRACK of thunder.\r\n\r\n           10.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          A light rain begins. Red snaps his head around and bucks\r\n          into the air. He gnashes at the rope.\r\n          Curtis collects Hannah off the playscape and turns back to\r\n          the approaching STORM CELL. He holds up his hand and studies\r\n          the falling rain. It's the thick, amber colored liquid.\r\n          With Hannah in his arms, Curtis watches, awestruck, as wispy\r\n          tentacles drip to the ground forming a collection of THREE\r\n          TORNADOS out in the field.\r\n          Behind them, Red's teeth fray the rope at his collar. He\r\n          thrashes his head, the rope SNAPS, and the dog flies toward\r\n          Curtis and Hannah.\r\n          Curtis turns to see Red charging them. He barely has time to\r\n          set Hannah down before Red catches him by the forearm.\r\n          They crash to the ground, tangled together. Rain coming down\r\n          hard now.\r\n          Curtis yells and waves Hannah back. Red, snapping, buries\r\n          his teeth into the muscles in Curtis' arm. Blood streams\r\n          from the wound.\r\n          Curtis screams in pain.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. BEDROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Curtis bolts up in bed grabbing his forearm. He grinds his\r\n          teeth and doubles over in pain. It takes a moment for him to\r\n          find his bearings.\r\n          His breathing slows. He gently rubs his hand over the skin\r\n          on his arm. Sweat has collected around his collar and\r\n          temples.\r\n          From the bed, sheets in a twisted mess, he looks around the\r\n          room unsure of what just happened to him.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. KITCHEN - DAY\r\n\r\n          Eggs cool on a plate.\r\n          Curtis sits at the kitchen table dressed for work. He stares\r\n          vacantly at his breakfast.\r\n          He looks up at Hannah. She sits on the floor surrounded by\r\n          toy building blocks and plays with the dog. She rubs under\r\n          Red's chest and in turn he licks her face. She smiles and\r\n          gently pushes him away.\r\n          Samantha sits with her knees up drinking coffee.\r\n\r\n           11.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Curtis?\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           What?\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Did you hear me? You got to be\r\n           home, showered, ready to walk out\r\n           the door by six tonight.\r\n          Curtis stands up and goes over to Hannah. He grabs her off\r\n          the floor and she begins to protest with kicks and crying.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n           What's wrong?\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Nothing. I just want her to eat her\r\n           breakfast and stop playin' with the\r\n           damn dog.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           She's fine down there. She had\r\n           toast already.\r\n          Curtis, against flailing, manages to get Hannah in her chair.\r\n          Curtis backs off, frustrated. Hannah climbs down from her\r\n          chair and goes back to the floor and the dog.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Hannah. Come here. Hannah.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Curtis?\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           What?\r\n          He stops and checks his watch.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           I'm late.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           You didn't eat anything?\r\n          Heading out.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           It's okay.\r\n          Curtis is gone.

DELTA AGRI-PRO MAIN OFFICE - DAY\r\n\r\n          The main headquarters of Delta Agri-Pro is housed in a giant\r\n          metal building. A row of cheaply built, 70's style offices\r\n          with drop tile ceilings line the left of a large warehouse\r\n          that contains all manner of agricultural and construction\r\n          equipment. Tractors, backhoes, welding rigs, etc.\r\n          A GROUP OF MEN, many of which were represented at Gator's bar\r\n          yesterday, sit in folding chairs or stand in a semi-circle\r\n          around JIM THOMPSON(53). He speaks, clipboard in hand.\r\n\r\n                          JIM\r\n           I didn't say you had control over\r\n           the weather Russell, what I did say\r\n           was that the top shelf has to be\r\n           cleared by the 15th. That's non-\r\n           negotiable.\r\n          Dewart eats from a bag of Sunflower seeds. Curtis stares\r\n          down at his forearm. He rubs the skin there. Jim runs a\r\n          finger down his clipboard.\r\n\r\n                          JIM (CONT'D)\r\n           Umm, Curtis. Where we at on that\r\n           east 82nd site?\r\n          Curtis snaps his head up, takes a second.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Yesterday slowed us down. We\r\n           couldn't get the second pilot hole\r\n           drilled.\r\n          Jim drops his head and the clipboard falls to his side. A\r\n          melodramatic move.\r\n\r\n                          JIM\r\n           It rained for two hours yesterday.\r\n           Two hours and our entire schedule\r\n           went in the toilet.

SOYBEAN FIELD - DAY\r\n\r\n          The wheels of the well-drilling rig are half sunk into the\r\n          muddy soil.\r\n          Curtis stands over the hole being drilled. The turning metal\r\n          pole suddenly seizes up and stops. Smoke begins to seep up\r\n          from the hole.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Sonofabitch.\r\n          Dewart jumps down from the control panel to take a look.\r\n\r\n                          DEWART\r\n           We stripped that bit.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Yeah. Well, bring it up. We gotta\r\n           re-set it.\r\n          Dewart walks back to his controls. Curtis heads to the cab\r\n          of the drilling rig and checks his watch.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Shit.\r\n          Something catches his eye in the distance. Clearing past the\r\n          rig, he walks out into the adjacent field.\r\n          He removes his goggles, eyes fixed on the acres of farmland\r\n          that stretch for miles in front of him.\r\n          In the sky overhead,\r\n\r\n           14.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          AN ENORMOUS FLOCK OF BIRDS ROLL IN UNISON.\r\n          Hundreds of them make up a black swarm that twists and shifts\r\n          in the air. They dive bomb then ascend in intricate,\r\n          GEOMETRIC patterns.\r\n          Curtis watches, mesmerized.\r\n          Dewart strains a wrench against a bolt as the drill screeches\r\n          in reverse.\r\n\r\n                          DEWART\r\n           Curtis!\r\n          Curtis acknowledges Dewart but can't take his eyes off the\r\n          pattern of birds. They shrink and stretch from thick clumps\r\n          to long cylindrical tubes. A choreography.\r\n          Curtis reluctantly heads back to the rig, which is shrieking\r\n          with the SOUND of metal on metal.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           You ever see birds fly like that?!\r\n\r\n                          DEWART\r\n           (holding his hand to his\r\n\r\n                          EAR)\r\n           What?!\r\n          Curtis looks back, giving the birds a final review.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          I/E. CURTIS' TRUCK/HOUSE - EVENING\r\n          The sun has just set adding a purple hue to the sky.

Now in ASL...\r\n          Curtis looks over at Samantha, who is sitting in the desk\r\n          next to him. She won't look at him.\r\n          He cranes his neck around to see toward the back of the room.\r\n          An ASSISTANT TEACHER sits on a large, colorful rug with a\r\n          GROUP of CHILDREN, all different ages, playing games that\r\n          teach hand signs. Hannah actively participates in the group.\r\n\r\n                          TEACHER (CONT'D)\r\n           ...the male sign is signed at the\r\n           forehead area. For example, father\r\n           is signed up here like\r\n           this...Father, very good.\r\n          Curtis turns back in his chair and makes the sign for \"dad\"\r\n          along with the other parents.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM - NIGHT - LATER\r\n\r\n          Curtis, Samantha, and Hannah sit on the floor in a circle\r\n          atop the colored rug.\r\n          Samantha turns over large flashcards with illustrated scenes\r\n          on them. They take turns making the corresponding sign.\r\n          Curtis stares at Samantha, but she's still giving him the\r\n          cold shoulder. Finally, while holding up a card, she looks\r\n          at him. He signs, \"I'm sorry\". A fist moving in a circular\r\n          motion at his chest.\r\n\r\n           16.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           You're not sorry.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           I am sorry.\r\n          She looks to Hannah and signs, \"swim\".\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Well, you stink. You smell really\r\n           bad.\r\n          He smiles.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           I think I smell good.\r\n          She smiles, begrudgingly, and then signs to Hannah, \"Dad\" and\r\n          \"stink\". Curtis turns to some ladies behind him.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Do I smell good?\r\n          Samantha laughs and tries to cover his mouth with her hand.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           See. Maybe I should marry her\r\n           instead.\r\n          They continue to laugh.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Stop.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. CURTIS' TRUCK - DAY\r\n\r\n          Curtis slams the door to his truck, sealing him off from the\r\n          torrential rainfall outside.\r\n          He shakes water off, wipes his face. The windows are smeared\r\n          by thick, dark rain. It's hard to see out.\r\n          He looks over to Hannah sitting in her car seat. It looks\r\n          odd on the front bench of the truck. He signs to her.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           (signing and speaking)\r\n           You okay?\r\n          She nods. He cranks the truck and turns on the wipers. The\r\n          liquid on the windshield streaks into long smudges. Curtis\r\n          leans forward to get a better view of the street. He checks\r\n          his blind spot and pulls away.\r\n\r\n          MOVING FAST ON A MAIN ROAD,\r\n\r\n           17.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Stop lights blur into hazy red and green spheres.\r\n          Curtis checks the rearview, but the back window is covered by\r\n          the rain. He tries rolling down his window, but water blows\r\n          in. He rolls it back up and the smudging gets worse.\r\n          The truck shimmies from left to right, pushed by the wind. A\r\n          THUNDER STRIKE rattles.\r\n          Suddenly,\r\n\r\n          THE SHAPE OF A PERSON STANDING IN THE ROAD.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n           SHIT!\r\n          Curtis stomps on the brakes and turns the wheel. The truck\r\n          hydroplanes.\r\n          CRASH! Curtis' head busts against the steering column. The\r\n          front windshield cracks as the truck jerks to a stop.\r\n          The HISS of a broken radiator. Curtis winces from the blow\r\n          to his head. Hannah is crying. He reaches over to her.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Are you okay?\r\n          Hannah physically looks all right, but she continues crying.\r\n          Curtis reaches out and places a hand on her head. He's\r\n          dazed, mumbling.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           You're okay.\r\n          The truck is angled up slightly like the front end has inched\r\n          up a pole. A cut on his forehead has begun to bleed.\r\n          He sees movement. A PERSON passes by the hazy side window.\r\n          A SHAPE moves past the driver's window.\r\n          The truck shifts as weight is added to the bed. The SOUND of\r\n          SOMEONE pulling things from the back of the truck. A moment.\r\n          WHACK! Curtis flinches as a 2X4 pounds the windshield.\r\n          The truck jostles from the weight of someone jumping on the\r\n          hood.\r\n          Bump. Bump.\r\n          The roof caves in with two FOOTSTEPS.\r\n          Curtis looks around frantically. He reaches over to Hannah\r\n          and begins to unstrap her from the car seat.\r\n\r\n           18.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          SMASH! A BOARD breaks through the Passenger Window.\r\n          A WOMAN, pale and aggressive, stands in the rain storm\r\n          staring through the broken glass. She reaches for the lock.\r\n          Curtis pulls Hannah from the child seat and recoils against\r\n          his door but is jolted as another board CRASHES through the\r\n          driver's window.\r\n          A HAND yanks Curtis by his collar. He's pulled against the\r\n          door. A pasty forearm wraps around his neck, choking him.\r\n          He strains against the arm. Sucks air. Needing to breath.\r\n          The Woman at the passenger door grabs for Hannah. Curtis\r\n          kicks at her.\r\n          A MAN's boot KICKS OUT the back window. The Man in the bed\r\n          of the truck reaches for Curtis' face. He flails and kicks,\r\n          unable to break free from the forearm at his door.\r\n          The Woman gets hold of Hannah. The child is yanked from\r\n          Curtis' arms. He screams.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Hannah! Hannah!\r\n          Hands claw at Curtis' face. Scratching. Blood streaks. The\r\n          Woman has disappeared into the storm with Hannah.\r\n          Curtis screams. Fingers swoop into his open mouth, grabbing\r\n          hold of his cheek. They pull the cheek back. TEARING.\r\n          He yells in pain.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT.

Put on your shoes\r\n\r\n          IN THE KITCHEN,\r\n          Samantha walks in.

He just stirs a spoon in\r\n          the black coffee.\r\n          Samantha walks up to him and puts a hand on his back. She\r\n          notices that his shirt is soaked with sweat.\r\n\r\n           19.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n           Honey, you're soaked.\r\n          He turns, taking a sip from the mug.

In the mirror, the trash pile comes into view.\r\n          Just behind it, the STORM SHELTER doors appear.\r\n          The truck shutters to a stop. Curtis studies the Shelter in\r\n          the side mirror for a moment. A grassy bulge with angled\r\n          metal doors peeking over the trash heap. He climbs out.\r\n          A blue tarp is pulled from the bed of the truck, floating\r\n          down to the yard.\r\n          Curtis slips on a pair of work gloves and continues to eye\r\n          the Storm Shelter. He yanks a bale of chain-link from the\r\n          bed of the truck and carries it to the back corner of the\r\n          yard. He steals another glance back toward the Shelter.\r\n\r\n           21.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Dropping the bale, he sizes up the space. He looks to the\r\n          sky.

He\r\n          speaks gently to the dog.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Get in.\r\n          Red walks into the pen.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Good boy.\r\n          Curtis closes the gate, kneels and places his hands on the\r\n          fence. Red approaches so that his nose is touching Curtis'\r\n          fingers. Curtis scratches him.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           I'm sorry about this buddy. We\r\n           just gotta work it like this for\r\n           awhile okay?\r\n          Curtis stands, wiping his hands off on his jeans. He sees\r\n          the Storm Shelter poking up from behind the trash pile. He\r\n          looks down at Red.\r\n          Curtis walks to the Shelter. Clearing past the trash pile,\r\n          the shelter appears, the mound fully visible.\r\n          Curtis stops at the angled doors. He studies them. A rusted\r\n          padlock is snapped shut across the handles. He reaches out\r\n          and lifts up the padlock. He yanks on it, then lets it fall.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. KITCHEN - DAY\r\n\r\n          Coins splash across the kitchen counter. Curtis sets an\r\n          empty coffee can back on the shelf in front of him and begins\r\n          sifting through the change.\r\n          Odd screws, buttons, then he gets to what he's looking for.\r\n          A small set of brass keys on a matching ring. He grabs the\r\n          keys from the pile and exits.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Curtis walks back out to the storm shelter, keys in hand,\r\n          long flashlight in his back pocket.\r\n          He pulls up the padlock that holds the two rusted doors\r\n          together. Popping off the rubber cover, he tries a key. The\r\n          lock pops up. He unhooks it from the doors and lets it fall\r\n          to the ground.\r\n          Curtis strains to pull the first door open. It's heavy and\r\n          sticks from lack of use. Finally, with a creak, the door\r\n          swings back.\r\n\r\n           24.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Curtis holds his head to the side, a musty odor coming from\r\n          inside. He forces the second door open.\r\n          Curtis stands in front of the shelter, a gaping black hole\r\n          angled up from the earth.\r\n          He takes the flashlight from his pocket and turns it on. It\r\n          illuminates concrete steps leading down.\r\n          The dog, nose at the fence, watches from his pen on the other\r\n          side of the yard.\r\n          Curtis enters the shelter.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. STORM SHELTER - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          It's pitch black inside. Curtis makes his way down the steps\r\n          and holds out the flashlight. An assortment of trash on the\r\n          ground, empty cans and water bottles, some candy wrappers.\r\n          The whole shelter is only about 6' X 8'. His head fits fine,\r\n          but he still ducks like he might bump it.\r\n          He shines the light on the back wall. A rotted, wooden bench\r\n          is bolted into the concrete there. Curtis walks to it and\r\n          takes a seat.\r\n          He's looking back toward the steps now. A shaft of light\r\n          cuts a strict beam through the open doors, lighting only the\r\n          concrete entry.\r\n          Curtis takes in the quiet of the concrete box. He leans his\r\n          head back on the wall and closes his eyes.\r\n          He shuts off his flashlight. Left in the dark, he takes a\r\n          deep breath. Exhales slowly.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT.

She\r\n          sets a portion aside and closes the tackle box. Curtis says\r\n          something, but it's inaudible.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n           What?\r\n          She opens the tin and removes an envelope with the word\r\n          \"BEACH\" written on it in black sharpie. Samantha adds the\r\n          money to the envelope and puts up the jar. She opens the\r\n          fridge and takes out the milk.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n           You hear me?

LAFORCHE HOME - DAY\r\n\r\n          It's daytime, but the house feels dark from the storm blowing\r\n          outside. The SOUND of rain pelts the windows and roof.\r\n          Curtis, dressed for work, walks from his bedroom down the\r\n          hallway. He passes the den and stops at its entryway.\r\n\r\n          IN THE DEN,\r\n          Hannah sits on the couch with her back to him. She's on her\r\n          knees looking out one of the front windows.\r\n          A dull orange glow halos from the bank of windows. What\r\n          sunlight there is appears diffused by the dark, thick rain\r\n          smearing down the outside of the glass.\r\n\r\n          A THUNDER STRIKE.\r\n\r\n           27.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Curtis flinches. He shows concern as heavier rain begins\r\n          battering the house.

Windows begin to\r\n          rattle in their frames.\r\n          Curtis walks over and reaches for Hannah but is startled by\r\n          the sight of a MAN'S FACE just outside the window. Hannah\r\n          and the Man have been staring at one another.\r\n          The Man, hollow eyed and pale, moves out of the window and\r\n          out of sight.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Hey!\r\n          Thunder CRACKS overhead. Curtis scoops Hannah into his arms\r\n          and heads out of the room.\r\n          BANG. The front door rattles. Curtis stops and turns back.\r\n          BANG. BANG. The SOUND of someone kicking at the front door.\r\n          The storm outside has grown to a deafening pitch.\r\n          The power goes out.\r\n          The entire house vibrates, like a freight train running\r\n          across the roof. The BANGING at the front door continues,\r\n          frame giving way, as the STORM reaches its apex.\r\n          Curtis, holding Hannah, kneels and braces himself in the\r\n          entryway to the den. He covers the back of Hannah's head\r\n          with his hands and squeezes her tight into his shoulder.\r\n          Then Silence. A stillness.\r\n          The rain stops. No more banging at the front door. The SUN\r\n          moves brightly though the front windows.\r\n\r\n          WOOSH.\r\n          The furniture in the den lifts off the ground. A couch,\r\n          Lazyboy, coffee table and lamp. It all hangs in the air,\r\n          floating for a moment. Quietly.\r\n          Curtis watches, eyes wide. A rumbling. Grows. The SUNLIGHT\r\n          vanishes.\r\n          SMASH! The sound of the storm is sucked back into the room as\r\n          the furniture crashes to the floor, breaking apart on impact.\r\n\r\n           28.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          The windows BLOW OUT.\r\n          Curtis squeezes his eyes shut and pivots his body, trying to\r\n          protect Hannah.

He's sucking for a breath. Hyperventilating.\r\n          He rises up in bed, gasping. His face flushed and head\r\n          soaked in sweat. His eyes dart around the room, frantically\r\n          searching his surroundings.\r\n          One more gasp, and air enters his lungs. He coughs. More\r\n          air. Long, deep breaths. He's calming down.\r\n          His breathing comes under control. His attention turns to\r\n          something else. Something under the sheets.\r\n          Curtis pulls back the bed sheets. The mattress is soaked in\r\n          YELLOW urine. This scares him.\r\n          His hand trembles as he reaches out to touch his wet boxers.\r\n          The toilet FLUSHES. Footsteps in heels.\r\n          Curtis quickly pulls the covers back up. Samantha enters the\r\n          bedroom. She pulls her hair into a tight ponytail and picks\r\n          earrings off a nearby dresser, her back to Curtis.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Babe?\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Yeah?\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           You got the number for Dr. Shannan?\r\n          She turns.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           You're still not feeling good?\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Yeah, but you got the number?\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Uh, yeah baby but he'll be closed\r\n           today.\r\n          She approaches the bed and he holds his hand out.\r\n\r\n           29.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Right.

He\r\n          subtly removes a prescription bottle from his pants pocket\r\n          and cups it in his palm.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Oh, honey. Look at this one. It's\r\n           a 2-1 and it sits directly on the\r\n           beach. Wouldn't that be great? We\r\n           wouldn't have to worry about Hannah\r\n           crossing traffic.\r\n          Curtis walks over and leans in to see the page.

The horizon is still clear.\r\n          Curtis begins to hyperventilate. Short breaths accompanied\r\n          by cold sweat. Sucking air. He can't breath. He panics.\r\n          The truck tires slide on the gravel shoulder as he abruptly\r\n          slams on the brakes and steers off the highway.\r\n          Dust settles outside as Curtis begins to get his breathing\r\n          under control. He rests his head on the steering wheel and\r\n          shuts his eyes tight.\r\n          Everything quiets down. His breathing. The road. No more\r\n          thunder.\r\n          Curtis looks out his passenger window.\r\n          His truck has stopped in front of a Tractor Trailer Depot.

He looks up at the sky. Clear and blue.\r\n          A thought comes to him. He checks his watch.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          I/E.

Cars passing.\r\n          The pump stops. The final amount reads, \"$68.79\". He hangs\r\n          the hose back onto the pump and pulls a cell phone from his\r\n          pocket. He dials and waits.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           (into the phone)\r\n           May I have the number for Doctor\r\n           George Shannan?\r\n\r\n                          (WAITS)\r\n           Thanks.\r\n          Curtis, phone still at his ear, turns and watches the\r\n          horizon. The sun hangs low in the sky. A reddish haze.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           (into the phone)\r\n           Hi, is Doctor Shannan there?

HANNAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Hannah sleeps soundly in her bed. Curtis stands at the door\r\n          watching her. He walks over and takes a seat on the edge of\r\n          the bed. He listens to her breath.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The backyard is almost pitch black. Curtis stands in front\r\n          of the storm shelter doors holding out the Coleman Lantern.\r\n\r\n           49.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He surveys the backyard with it. The trash pile has been\r\n          removed leaving the yard more open.\r\n          Curtis begins to count steps out from the left edge of the\r\n          shelter doors. He counts to himself, three feet per stride.\r\n          He begins to outline a rectangle.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. DEN - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The house is quiet and the den is lit by a single lamp.\r\n          Curtis sits alone on the couch, hunched over the coffee\r\n          table. He writes on a yellow legal pad. It's a list with\r\n          the heading, \"REMODEL\". It reads:\r\n          -Shipping Container, $1,800\r\n\r\n          -PVC, $475\r\n          -Plumbing and waste, $1,650\r\n          -Bobcat, $1,750\r\n          -Jackhammer with pneumatics, $800\r\n          -Sealant, $150\r\n          -Dirt, -$250\r\n          At the bottom of the list, Curtis writes the figure, \"$7,500\"\r\n          and circles it.\r\n          He studies the number, then begins drawing a rectangular\r\n          diagram below it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK OFFICE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Curtis blows into a Styrofoam cup and stares through the\r\n          blinds of an office window. Outside, a flag snaps at the top\r\n          of a pole next to the FIRST NATIONAL BANK sign.\r\n          He looks down at a NEWSPAPER laid out on an end table next to\r\n          him. He flips it over and studies the ads on the back. A\r\n          big one in the corner catches his eye.\r\n          It reads, \"CUYAHOGA GUN AND KNIFE SHOW!\" The ad lists items\r\n          for sell/trade: ...Tactical Gear, Gas Masks, Batons...\r\n          Curtis focuses in on the words \"Gas Masks\" and tears the ad\r\n          out. JOHN MYERS(34) enters with a set of papers in his hand.\r\n          Curtis quickly tucks the ad into his back pocket.\r\n          Myers takes a seat in one of two chairs in front of his desk\r\n          and looks over the papers. He takes a pen out of his pocket\r\n          as Curtis sits down next to him.\r\n\r\n                          MYERS\r\n           Well you've kept up with the\r\n           payments on the house.\r\n\r\n           50.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           We've been good about that.\r\n          Myers nods, but he carries a look of concern. He confides.\r\n\r\n                          MYERS\r\n           I gotta tell you Curtis, banks\r\n           aren't loaning money the way they\r\n           used to. We've got you a loan\r\n           today, but the interest rates are\r\n           variable and we have to tie it to\r\n           your house.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           That's fine.\r\n          Myers sits back, drawing the pen to his lips and tapping it.\r\n\r\n                          MYERS\r\n           Curtis, I've known you a long time.\r\n           We financed your house for you, two\r\n           vehicles. I'm telling you this is\r\n           a risky loan you're taking.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           I need the money John.\r\n          Myers nods, then leans forward and clicks the pen.\r\n\r\n                          MYERS\r\n           Okay.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK - DAY\r\n\r\n          Curtis opens the door to his truck which is parked in the\r\n          bank's lot. He unbuttons his starched white shirt and places\r\n          it on the truck seat.\r\n          He pulls out a dirty blue work shirt and begins buttoning it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT.

A poster about\r\n          flu shots hangs on the wall. There is no personal decor.\r\n\r\n                          KENDRA\r\n           Hi.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Hello.\r\n          She half stands and offers a hand.\r\n\r\n                          KENDRA\r\n           Have a seat.

I already answered all the\r\n           questions on the forms.\r\n\r\n                          KENDRA\r\n           Yeah, I know. I looked at `em, but\r\n           I need to get a profile started on\r\n           you.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Right. Well...\r\n          Curtis slides the yellow legal pad out of the book he\r\n          brought. It's the library book on Mental Illness.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Out of the five possible symptoms\r\n           needed to be diagnosed with\r\n\r\n                          SCHIZOPHRENIA:\r\n\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n\r\n           54.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           (reads off the pad)\r\n           delusions, hallucinations,\r\n           disorganized speech, disorganized\r\n           behavior, and the negative\r\n           symptoms, I've had two. Delusions\r\n           and hallucinations. But they say\r\n           it has to continue for six months\r\n           to be diagnosed schizophrenia and\r\n           mine hasn't been goin' on anywhere\r\n           near that long. So, I took this\r\n           quiz in the back of the book and I\r\n           scored a five out of a possible\r\n           twenty. Schizophrenia starts at\r\n           twelve. So, they say it might be\r\n           a...\r\n           (reads off the pad)\r\n           brief psychotic disorder. Whatever\r\n           it is, I need to know what to do or\r\n           what to get on to get this thing\r\n           under control.\r\n          Kendra stares at him.\r\n\r\n                          KENDRA\r\n           Look. I'm a counselor. Certified,\r\n           but I'm not a psychiatrist. I\r\n           can't prescribe anything to you. I\r\n           can talk to you, I can recommend\r\n           where to send you, but that's it.\r\n          Curtis begins to gather his things.\r\n\r\n                          KENDRA (CONT'D)\r\n           Now that said, if you want to talk,\r\n           I'll listen. For a lot of people\r\n           that's a good start.\r\n          Curtis hesitates.\r\n\r\n                          KENDRA (CONT'D)\r\n           Now you said here that your mother\r\n           was diagnosed with paranoid\r\n           schizophrenia in her thirties. And\r\n           you're at 35. You wanna talk about\r\n           that?\r\n          Curtis settles in his seat. Sets his book on the floor.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Yeah, I don't know my mother's\r\n           symptoms. I was just 10. My\r\n           brother was 17. And, uh...I don't\r\n           know. She just left me in the car\r\n           in the parking lot at the grocery\r\n           store one day. And she didn't come\r\n           back. And then they found her a\r\n           week later eatin' trash out of a\r\n           dumpster in northern Kentucky.\r\n\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n\r\n           55.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           My dad had to put her in the state\r\n           hospital in Columbus.

But I really do\r\n           think you should continue with the\r\n           sign language.

He signs \"SUNSHINE\", a circle in the\r\n          sky with the hand then coming down, fingers spread.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          I/E. SAMANTHA'S CAR/INTERSTATE - NIGHT\r\n          Curtis drives while Samantha and Hannah sleep in the back.\r\n          Surrounding farmland drops quickly into darkness joining a\r\n          purple sky in the distance. Through the passenger window, a\r\n          streak of lightning breaks across the horizon. Then another.\r\n          Curtis, seeing this, repositions to get a better look through\r\n          the window. It's horizontal lightning that appears to leap\r\n          from cloud to cloud. Well defined bolts that strobe the\r\n          night sky silhouetting towering thunderheads.\r\n\r\n           56.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Curtis looks back to Samantha and Hannah, still asleep.\r\n          He pulls the car over to the shoulder of the interstate and\r\n          continues watching. He climbs out.\r\n\r\n          ON THE SHOULDER OF THE INTERSTATE,\r\n          Cars rush by as Curtis gently closes the car door. Keeping\r\n          his eyes on the lightning storm, he walks to the shoulder.\r\n          It's a fantastic display of light. Hurried and intense. A\r\n          BOLT of lightning reaches down to the ground. Sparks pop off\r\n          the earth in the distance. Another BOLT streaks down,\r\n          getting closer.\r\n          Curtis sees the traffic continuing to pass by at full speed.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n\r\n                          (TO HIMSELF)\r\n           Is anyone seeing this?\r\n          Curtis walks to the back window of the car and sees Samantha\r\n          sleeping inside. He reaches out to knock but stops himself.\r\n          He turns back to the lightning and watches.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT.

Sunlight bounces off the finished concrete.\r\n          Curtis pulls the chain for the door as Dewart slams the tow\r\n          latch down on the back of a DUMP TRUCK.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          I/E.

Dewart stands at the back of the\r\n          trailer with his hand on the ramp lever as Curtis reverses a\r\n          BACKHOE onto the street.\r\n          -Samantha works her booth at the flea market. Hannah neatly\r\n          organizes a collection of colored beads on the floor.\r\n          -A 20 foot rectangle has been outlined in bright orange paint\r\n          next to the storm shelter in Curtis' backyard. Other colored\r\n          markings denote gas and water lines. The bucket on the\r\n          Backhoe digs into the center of the dotted rectangle.\r\n          -Dewart maneuvers the Backhoe's bucket and drops a load of\r\n          earth into the bed of the Dump Truck. Red, the dog, barks at\r\n          the loud machinery from his pen.\r\n\r\n           57.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          -Curtis uses a smaller trench digging machine on the backside\r\n          of the yard, radiating out from the main dig site.

LAFORCHE HOME - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          Samantha's car pulls up and parks on the opposite side of the\r\n          street from their house. She gets out, puzzled by the\r\n          Backhoe and Trailer parked in front of her house.\r\n          Huge light brown tracks of dirt stripe the concrete driveway.\r\n          Leading Hannah by the hand, Samantha follows the tracks to\r\n          the backyard.\r\n\r\n          IN THE BACKYARD,\r\n          Samantha stops, mouth agape, stunned by what she sees.\r\n          A 20 foot by 8 foot wide hole that is 10 feet deep sits in\r\n          the middle of her yard. Smaller trenches lead out from it.\r\n          Dewart leans against the propane tank in the back corner of\r\n          the yard. He digs dirt from underneath his fingernails with\r\n          a pocket knife. Seeing Samantha, he waves a hand.\r\n          Curtis' head appears from the hole. He stops when he sees\r\n          Samantha. They stare at one another. He can see her\r\n          surprise. He continues up the ladder and walks over to her.\r\n          Dewart watches from the back of the yard.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Hey. It's all right. Calm down.\r\n          Samantha takes Hannah into the house without saying a word.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Samantha.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Are you out of your mind?\r\n          She continues into the house. Curtis turns, frustrated.\r\n          Dewart takes this in, then goes back to his nails.\r\n\r\n           58.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT.

Curtis stands a few\r\n          paces back. His hands dug into the back of his dusty jeans.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Not a word. You didn't say one\r\n           word about this to me. Don't you\r\n           think you owe me that?

She turns over to see Curtis.\r\n          He's having a SEIZURE.\r\n          Samantha reaches for him. Eyes closed, his body convulses\r\n          violently.

Curtis' body is still.\r\n          Samantha freezes.\r\n          His eyes open and he thrashes up in bed. Samantha jumps,\r\n          tripping and stumbling backward.\r\n          Curtis sucks short breaths into his lungs. His head darts\r\n          back and forth, eyes wild. He sees Samantha staring up at\r\n          him from the floor. He begins to calm down.\r\n          Curtis touches his mouth. Sees the blood there.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n           Honey?\r\n          Samantha stands up and goes over to him. She sits on the\r\n          edge of the bed and touches his arm. She's scared.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n           Honey?

The\r\n          SOUND of ambulance sirens approach from the distance.\r\n          Samantha speaks, her voice trembling.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n           Baby what's goin' on?\r\n\r\n           61.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. LAFORCHE HOME - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The ambulance lights splash across the house. Curtis escorts\r\n          TWO EMTs down the front walk.

He spits into the kitchen sink.\r\n          Samantha sits at the table watching him. Concerned, scared.\r\n          She holds a balled up tissue in her hand. Curtis takes a\r\n          seat across the table. She waits for him to say something.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           I haven't been honest with you.\r\n           I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           What's goin' on?\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           I've been havin' these dreams.

His\r\n           eyes were different. He came after\r\n           me with a pick ax. And we fought.\r\n           And he ran it through my leg.\r\n          Curtis zones out for a moment. Samantha says nothing.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           It's hard to explain, because it's\r\n           not just a dream.

I\r\n           just need you to believe me.\r\n          Samantha's eyes are red. Her nose. She nods slightly and\r\n          dabs the tissue at the corner of her eye.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           I've been to a counselor.

Sighs, frustrated\r\n          with it all.\r\n          He checks over his shoulder, scans the parking lot.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - LATER\r\n\r\n          Curtis stands on top of the shipping container that rests in\r\n          the hole roughly a foot below the yard. Wearing tinted\r\n          goggles, he cuts a circular hole in the top of the container\r\n          with a small blowtorch.\r\n          The sparks stop and Curtis raises the goggles to inspect his\r\n          work. He kicks at the weld with the heel of his boot and the\r\n          metal falls into the container.\r\n\r\n           68.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          He sets down the torch and removes a roof turbine vent from a\r\n          cardboard box and holds it up next to the newly cut hole.\r\n\r\n           KYLE (O.S.)\r\n           What the hell are you doin'?\r\n          Curtis smiles to himself. He turns to find KYLE(42) standing\r\n          at the edge of the hole. His hands are tucked into the back\r\n          of his jeans and he's sizing up the work.\r\n          Curtis steps off the roof of the shipping container onto\r\n          ground level. He holds out a hand and Kyle shakes it, never\r\n          taking his eyes off the unfinished shelter.\r\n\r\n                          KYLE (CONT'D)\r\n           What you got goin' on here?\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Just addin' on to the storm\r\n           shelter.\r\n\r\n                          KYLE\r\n           Why?\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Just `cause.\r\n          Kyle notices the PVC piping running in the trenches.\r\n\r\n                          KYLE\r\n           You runnin' water to it?\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Oh, yeah.

KENDRA'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Curtis finds ANDY(42), a man in khakis and a button up,\r\n          sitting behind the desk.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Oh, `scuse me.\r\n          Andy rises from his chair.\r\n\r\n                          ANDY\r\n           Are you Curtis?\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Yeah.\r\n\r\n                          ANDY\r\n           Come in. Kendra transferred out.\r\n           I'll be meeting with you today.\r\n          Curtis looks at the man. He's kind of mincing.\r\n\r\n                          ANDY (CONT'D)\r\n           Please, sit down.\r\n          Curtis takes a seat.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           What happened to Kendra?\r\n\r\n                          ANDY\r\n           She got into a program at OSU so\r\n           she'll be transferring near there.\r\n           I've split her case load with\r\n           another counselor. It's been kind\r\n           of crazy around here lately.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Huh.\r\n\r\n                          ANDY\r\n           So I've looked over your file. It\r\n           says your mother was diagnosed with\r\n           paranoid schizophrenia in her early\r\n           thirties. Let's start there.\r\n\r\n           76.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Curtis looks at the man for a moment, then stands and walks\r\n          out of the room.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. LAFORCHE HOME/DRIVEWAY - DAY\r\n\r\n          Curtis' truck is parked in the driveway with the hood up and\r\n          the engine running.\r\n          Curtis stands over the vibrating engine, studying it. He\r\n          looks at the belts. He watches them move.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. STORM SHELTER - DAY\r\n\r\n          Curtis hefts a porcelain toilet down the steps of the\r\n          shelter. A dull light glows through the new entryway that's\r\n          been knocked out through the back left wall.\r\n          Curtis goes through it.\r\n\r\n          IN THE SHIPPING CONTAINER SECTION,\r\n          Curtis sets the toilet on the floor. He picks up the camping\r\n          lantern and holds it up to the space.\r\n          The lack of light makes it feel more cavernous than it is.\r\n          Two cots have been brought down as well as an assortment of\r\n          supplies. Canned food, a small gas burner.\r\n          Curtis hangs the lantern onto a hook on the wall and goes\r\n          about connecting the toilet to a pipe sticking out of the\r\n          back corner.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY\r\n\r\n          Samantha walks inside followed by Hannah and a WOMAN from the\r\n          flea market.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           I'm so sorry. I completely forgot.\r\n\r\n                          WOMAN\r\n           That's okay. Don't worry about it.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Here. I hope you like them.\r\n          Samantha hands over the plastic bag.\r\n\r\n                          WOMAN\r\n           Thanks. I brought cash.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           That's terrific. It's fine.\r\n\r\n           77.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Samantha takes three twenties from her.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n           Call me if they don't work and I'm\r\n           sorry again.\r\n\r\n                          WOMAN\r\n           Oh, it's okay. Thank you.\r\n          Samantha closes the door.\r\n\r\n          IN THE KITCHEN,\r\n          Samantha takes the tin decorated with ocean creatures down\r\n          from the fridge. She removes the envelope with the word\r\n          \"BEACH\" written on it and takes out a stack of bills.\r\n          She folds the bills over and stuffs them into her purse\r\n          before placing the empty envelope back in the tin.\r\n          She looks out back and sees Curtis sitting with Hannah.\r\n\r\n          OUTSIDE,\r\n          The shipping container has been covered over with dirt. Two\r\n          rotating vents spin at either end of the brown mound. Curtis\r\n          sits on the freshly packed dirt signing with Hannah.\r\n          He signs something that makes her laugh. Hannah smacks a\r\n          muddy clump between her hands. Curtis touches her nose,\r\n          leaving a dirt smudge. Hannah laughs. She touches his face,\r\n          smudging it.\r\n\r\n          IN THE KITCHEN,\r\n          Samantha watches through the back door.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Samantha tucks Hannah into bed. She kisses her on the head\r\n          and turns out the bedside lamp. Samantha leaves the room.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - EVENING\r\n\r\n          Samantha steps out of the house. She walks over to Curtis,\r\n          who is standing on a grassy section of the yard over an\r\n          assortment of auto parts. They don't speak for a moment.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           What's that?\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           That's the alternator from the\r\n           truck.\r\n\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n\r\n           78.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           I was just trying to figure out a\r\n           way to charge enough batteries to\r\n           run lights down there. Ah, what the\r\n           hell? Maybe I'll hook it up to your\r\n           old exercycle.\r\n          Samantha almost smiles. Curtis keeps his eyes on the parts.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           You gonna leave me?\r\n          Samantha looks at his hands. They hang by his sides.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           You flinched when I touched your\r\n           hand this morning.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           I was in one of your dreams?\r\n          Curtis nods.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Yeah.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Can you deal with that?\r\n          He holds open his hand to her. She takes it.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Yeah.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Okay. Then I made a decision. We\r\n           cancel the beach trip. We have\r\n           enough to cover bills for the next\r\n           two months with your last check.\r\n           I'm going to get a job. You're\r\n           gonna find another job. I'm going\r\n           to call to see if we can move\r\n           Hannah's surgery up. We'll need to\r\n           see what it costs to extend your\r\n           policy to the end of the year. I\r\n           want you to see a psychiatrist.\r\n           Not a counselor from the free\r\n           clinic. Someone good.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Doctor Shannan gave me the number\r\n           of somebody. But, uh, I just don't\r\n           think we can afford it.\r\n\r\n           79.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           We'll find the money. Also, the\r\n           Lions Club supper's this weekend.\r\n           I want you to come with me.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           I don't want to see any of those\r\n           people.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           I want you to go. I need to do\r\n           something normal.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           All right.\r\n          Curtis nods. Samantha let's go of his hand and walks back to\r\n          the house. Curtis goes back to studying the auto parts.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. LIONS CLUB LODGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The inside of the club is a musty banquet hall with wood\r\n          panelled walls and a drop tile ceiling. The place is packed.\r\n          Rows of folding tables fill the center of the room. A long\r\n          LINE has formed along the side wall that wraps to a serving\r\n          station at the back. Heated metal bins filled with fried\r\n          oysters and french fries.\r\n          Curtis gets in line with his family.\r\n\r\n          AT THE SERVING TABLE,\r\n          Curtis holds two paper plates.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           How many pieces does Hannah get?\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Just one.\r\n          Curtis uses tongs to grab pieces of fried oyster. Looking\r\n          up, he can see back through the kitchen to an open door\r\n          outside. Dewart stands there over a butane fired frying pot.\r\n          He wears an apron and stares at Curtis.\r\n          Curtis moves down the line.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. LIONS CLUB LODGE - LATER\r\n\r\n          Lewis sits with Cammie and their baby. He laughs and talks\r\n          with another man. From a different table, Russell leans over\r\n          to eye Curtis.\r\n\r\n           80.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Curtis sits at a table with his family. He loads Hannah's\r\n          plate up with ketchup.\r\n          A tap on his shoulder. Curtis turns to find Dewart standing\r\n          over him.\r\n\r\n                          DEWART\r\n           What're you doin' here?\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Not here man.\r\n          Dewart taps him on the shoulder again.\r\n\r\n                          DEWART\r\n           I said what are you doin' here.\r\n          Curtis stands and Dewart takes a step back. The general\r\n          noise of the place starts to quiet down as people take\r\n          notice. A few stand.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Curtis.\r\n\r\n                          DEWART\r\n           I told people what you been doin'.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           I know.\r\n\r\n                          DEWART\r\n           You cut me loose. Everything we\r\n           been through.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           I know. I'm sorry.\r\n          Dewart shoves him in the chest.\r\n\r\n                          DEWART\r\n           You ain't fucking sorry. You sorry\r\n           you wouldn't cut me loose. We\r\n           fuckin' friends! This how you\r\n           treat friends?\r\n          Curtis places a hand on Dewart's chest.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Come on.\r\n          Dewart punches Curtis in the face. It stings.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           God dammit.\r\n\r\n           81.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Samantha gathers Hannah and moves back. Dewart shoves Curtis\r\n          across the table. Oysters and bottles go everywhere. The\r\n          entire room is on its feet watching.\r\n          Curtis slips getting up. Dewart walks around the table,\r\n          heading for him.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n\r\n           STOP IT DEWART!\r\n          Curtis stands and kicks Dewart in the knee. It buckles back\r\n          and he's on the floor. He cries out and grabs the twisted\r\n          joint. He's done.\r\n          Curtis paces over him, covered in ketchup and soda. He\r\n          shouts down at him.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n\r\n           I SAID NOT HERE! GOD DAMNIT!\r\n          He wipes at his face. Sees all of the people staring at him.\r\n          Addresses them.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           You think I'm crazy?! Huh! Is that\r\n           what he told you!\r\n          Curtis TURNS OVER A TABLE. He points to the gawking crowd.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Well, listen up! There is a storm\r\n           comin' like nothing you have ever\r\n           seen. And not a one of you is\r\n           prepared for it.\r\n\r\n                          (PACING)\r\n           You think I'm crazy?

She looks on as Curtis\r\n          paces, pointing and yelling, red faced at the crowd.\r\n          Curtis backs off.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Sleep well in your beds. Cause if\r\n           this thing comes true, there ain't\r\n           gonna be any more.\r\n          Curtis looks down at Dewart.\r\n          He turns to see Hannah. She's tucked under her Mother's leg\r\n          crying. This hits him hard. He stops. Looking at Samantha,\r\n          his eyes fill with tears.\r\n\r\n           82.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Samantha, leading Hannah by the hand, walks to Curtis. He\r\n          stares at her, on the verge of breaking down.\r\n          She takes her hand and gently pulls his head down to her\r\n          shoulder. Without another look toward the crowd, Samantha\r\n          leads her family out of the dining hall.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. LAFORCHE HOME - DAY\r\n\r\n          Hannah stands on a toolbox and rests her elbows on the side\r\n          of Curtis' truck. The hood is open. She watches her father\r\n          fiddle with re-installing the alternator. His fingers\r\n          covered in grease.\r\n          Hannah steps down from the toolbox and walks into the front\r\n          yard. Curtis pauses, hearing a high-pitched, warbling SOUND\r\n          in the distance. He notices Hannah is gone.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Hannah?\r\n          He pulls his head out from the hood and sees Hannah standing\r\n          on the curb. She looks down the street. He runs down his\r\n          driveway, wiping his hands on a rag and watching the horizon.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Hannah!\r\n          A FLOCK OF BIRDS, flying in intricate geometric patterns,\r\n          swarm above the house at the end of the street. They twist\r\n          and bend into speckled black shapes.\r\n          Hannah, watching, walks into the street. Curtis catches her\r\n          by the hand. He turns away from the birds to see a STORM\r\n          CELL building on the opposite horizon. He scoops Hannah into\r\n          his arms, stepping back from it.\r\n          The SOUND of the birds grows louder. Curtis pivots to find\r\n          the mass of birds barreling down the street toward him. He\r\n          turns away as the wall of birds crash past him. The force so\r\n          powerful it knocks him backward.\r\n          He covers Hannah's head, dodging the onslaught of wind and\r\n          wings. The Flock passes. Curtis stands, his face cut and\r\n          scraped. Hannah cries, clinging to his chest.\r\n\r\n          SMASH!\r\n          The windshield of a car parked next to him SHATTERS. Curtis\r\n          looks at the broken glass. A dead bird, it's neck broken,\r\n          rests crumpled on the hood.\r\n\r\n          SMACK!\r\n\r\n           83.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Another bird crashes into the asphalt just in front of him.\r\n          Then another. Curtis looks up. The Flock of birds are\r\n          circling overhead and diving down at him.\r\n          More birds crashing to the ground. Curtis covers his head.\r\n          The neighborhood's tornado SIRENS begin to sound.\r\n          Curtis rushes Hannah toward his front door as dozens of birds\r\n          plummet from the sky. The sirens BLARING.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Curtis wakes to Samantha shaking him by the shoulders. She's\r\n          nearly on top of him in the bed.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Curtis! Wake up! Wake up!\r\n          TORNADO SIRENS continue to scream throughout the\r\n          neighborhood.\r\n          Curtis looks to the window. Rain and hail are battering the\r\n          house. He jumps to his feet and grabs Samantha by the arm.\r\n          They rush out of the room.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. HANNAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Curtis bursts into the room. Hannah is standing at the\r\n          window looking out. Curtis scoops her up, scaring her. She\r\n          begins to cry as they run from the room.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Wind blows fiercely as pellets of hail bounce off the ground.\r\n          Rain cuts at a sharp angle. The Tornado Sirens continue.\r\n          Curtis, Hannah in his arms and Samantha close behind, exits\r\n          the back of the house and heads to the storm shelter. He\r\n          passes Hannah to Samantha and fumbles with the padlock keys.\r\n          At the doors to the shelter, Samantha holds her robe up to\r\n          shield Hannah from the hail. Curtis gets the lock and opens\r\n          the door. They go inside.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. STORM SHELTER - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Curtis slams the doors behind them. It's pitch black until\r\n          he gets to the switch on the lantern. The room fills with\r\n          the orange glow as Curtis snaps the padlock through the door\r\n          handles.\r\n\r\n           84.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Come on. It's okay.\r\n          Curtis leads them through the entry to the larger section of\r\n          the shelter. Samantha takes Hannah and sits with her on one\r\n          of the cots. She's signing to her, trying to calm her down.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           It's okay. All right. Come on. Sit\r\n           down.\r\n          Curtis goes to a trunk in the corner and begins rooting\r\n          through it. He removes two gas masks and an oxygen mask\r\n          connected to a small tank.\r\n          He goes over and kneels in front of Hannah. He tries\r\n          slipping the oxygen mask over her face. Samantha grabs his\r\n          wrist.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           No. Don't do that.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           It's okay. It's oxygen. Here. Put\r\n           this on.\r\n          Curtis hands Samantha a gas mask.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Are you kidding?\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Please just do it. Okay?\r\n          He looks to Hannah and places an oxygen mask over her face..\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           There we go. All right. Keep it out\r\n           of your eyes. Okay?\r\n          He signs to her.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Hey. I love you. It's okay.\r\n          Curtis eases on the knob at the top of the tank.\r\n          He climbs onto the cot and puts his arm around them. He\r\n          slips on his gas mask.\r\n          Samantha is hesitant. She looks at her husband in the mask\r\n          and leans back against the side of the container. Hannah\r\n          looks up at her. She touches her mother's mask.\r\n          Samantha slips on the gas mask.\r\n\r\n           85.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          The camping lantern on the floor casts long shadows up. The\r\n          faint boom of thunder rolls softly outside.\r\n          The family sits huddled together on the cot, wearing their\r\n          masks.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. STORM SHELTER - LATER\r\n\r\n          A CRACK of thunder rattles the shelter. Curtis snaps awake,\r\n          still wearing his gas mask.\r\n          Samantha has climbed on the other cot and is asleep. Hannah\r\n          sleeps under Curtis' arm. He gently lays her down on the cot\r\n          and stands to stretch.\r\n          He walks into the original section of the shelter and grabs a\r\n          small flashlight off the metal shelving. He clicks it on and\r\n          moves over to the concrete steps.\r\n          He takes a seat and listens. He places his hand onto the\r\n          metal door. A BOOM of thunder.\r\n          He can hear the rain and wind blowing outside.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. STORM SHELTER - LATER\r\n\r\n          Samantha rubs Curtis' shoulder, gently waking him.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Wake up babe.\r\n          Curtis' head moves. He sees that Samantha and Hannah have\r\n          removed their masks.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Where's your mask?\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           We took them off.

Take it off.\r\n          Curtis slips the mask off his face. Worried, he takes a\r\n          breath.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA (CONT'D)\r\n           You need to open the door now.\r\n\r\n           86.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Curtis doesn't move.

Get the keys. Open the\r\n           door.\r\n          Curtis slowly gets to his feet. He sees the dark entryway to\r\n          the original section of the shelter. Taking the lantern, he\r\n          walks to it.\r\n          Samantha and Hannah follow.\r\n          Curtis stops just inside. He holds the lantern up,\r\n          illuminating the padlocked metal doors.\r\n          He looks back at his family, then climbs the steps. He\r\n          places his hand on the door. He flinches.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           It's still storming.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           No. It's not.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           I can hear it.\r\n          Samantha stares at him. The room is silent.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           I don't hear anything.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Put your hand on the door. You can\r\n           feel it.\r\n          He takes Samantha's wrist and guides her to the doors. He\r\n          watches her face as she places a hand against the metal. She\r\n          looks at him, her eyes getting red, and shakes her head \"no\".\r\n          Curtis kneels in front of Hannah and mimics the signs from\r\n          earlier.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           (signing and speaking)\r\n           Thunder?

Looks to the ceiling\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           (signing and speaking)\r\n           You feel it? You feel it?\r\n          Hannah walks to her mother. Samantha holds onto her.\r\n          Curtis steps back from them. They watch him, their backs to\r\n          the doors. He flinches and covers his mouth.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Baby, there's no storm outside.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           I'm sorry.\r\n          Samantha walks over to him.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Curtis. I wouldn't lie to you. We\r\n           love you very much. Please open\r\n           the door.\r\n          Curtis is on the verge of tears.\r\n          He slowly reaches into his jeans pocket. He removes the\r\n          keys. He holds them out to Samantha.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           I'm sorry. I can't.\r\n          Samantha looks at the keys, then at Curtis. Tears shake from\r\n          his trembling face.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           I love you, but if I open the door,\r\n           then nothin's gonna change. You'll\r\n           see that everything's fine, but\r\n           nothing will change. Please. This\r\n           is what it means to stay with us.\r\n           This is something you have to do.\r\n          He looks at Hannah, then Samantha. Curtis steadies himself,\r\n          trying to control his flinching. He wipes his face with the\r\n          back of his hands and takes a deep breath.\r\n          Curtis walks toward the doors. On the steps, he reaches up\r\n          to the padlock. The keys shake in his fingers. He turns to\r\n          Samantha.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           Could you move Hannah back?\r\n\r\n           88.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Samantha picks Hannah up in her arms and Curtis watches them\r\n          retreat to the rear wall.\r\n          He goes back to the lock. He inserts the key. The padlock\r\n          pops open. Curtis removes it. He looks back at Samantha,\r\n          then flings open the doors.\r\n\r\n          SUNLIGHT.\r\n          It's blinding. Curtis holds his hand up to cover his eyes.\r\n          He stares up at a crystal blue sky. Samantha watches as\r\n          Curtis steps out of the shelter.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. LAFORCHE BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Curtis rises through the storm shelter's entryway. Out of\r\n          the corner of his eye he catches,\r\n\r\n          A MAN PASSING BY.\r\n          Curtis is startled. He turns to see a CREW of MEN from the\r\n          power company hoisting a ladder onto the pole at the corner\r\n          of the house. A power line dangles overhead.\r\n          He turns to see NEIGHBORS in their yards clearing debris.\r\n          Leaves and branches clutter the ground. The aftermath of a\r\n          storm.\r\n          Samantha steps out of the shelter holding Hannah.

We can start you on\r\n           some medication that I think will\r\n           help, but that action alone would\r\n           mean a lot.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           We usually go on a trip to Myrtle\r\n           Beach every summer.

It would\r\n           give you all some time to prepare\r\n           as a family, but I want to be\r\n           clear, when Curtis gets back he'll\r\n           need to take more time than that.\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           What does that mean?\r\n\r\n                          PSYCHIATRIST\r\n           I mean that he'll need hands on\r\n           therapy at a real facility.\r\n          Curtis looks up for the first time.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS\r\n           You mean I have to leave my family.\r\n\r\n                          PSYCHIATRIST\r\n           I think you need to seriously\r\n           commit to some treatment.\r\n          Curtis processes this.

He hands the\r\n          bucket over for Hannah to refill.\r\n          The SOUND of the waves behind them has STOPPED. They don't\r\n          notice.\r\n          Curtis takes two fingers and digs a small trench around the\r\n          sand castle.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Curtis looks up ready to sign the letters but sees Hannah\r\n          staring at the water. She looks at him and signs something\r\n          with her hands.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           What is it honey?\r\n          Curtis misses it. He shakes his head, \"no\", and Hannah signs\r\n          again, slowly: \"S-T-O-R-M\".\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           What?\r\n          Curtis turns to the shoreline, getting to his feet.\r\n          He looks down at Hannah, who watches, mesmerized. Scared,\r\n          she looks to her father. He grabs her under the arms and\r\n          rests her on his hip. She buries her head into his chest.\r\n\r\n          AT THE CONDO,\r\n          A gust of wind greets Samantha as she walks out onto the deck\r\n          holding a plate of hotdogs and a bowl of chili. She stops,\r\n          seeing the horizon. Her mouth falls open.\r\n          She slowly sets the plate and bowl down on the table, her\r\n          mind racing. She looks down at Curtis in disbelief.\r\n\r\n           91.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Curtis looks up to the Condo and makes eye contact. He\r\n          studies her face.\r\n          Samantha looks at her husband, trying to process it all. She\r\n          looks out at the horizon then back down to Curtis. Concern\r\n          on her face, she nods to him.\r\n          Curtis sees her nod.\r\n          Samantha's eyes, still locked on Curtis, soften, as if to\r\n          apologize. After a moment, she mouths to him, \"I love you.\"\r\n          Curtis nods back to her.\r\n          She looks back up to the shoreline.\r\n\r\n          ON THE BEACH,\r\n          Curtis' feet kick up sand as he rushes back toward the condo.\r\n\r\n          AT THE CONDO,\r\n          Samantha hasn't moved from the porch. A light rain begins to\r\n          fall. Her hands grip the railing. She turns her left palm\r\n          up. Dark rain collects there.\r\n\r\n          ON THE HORIZON IN FRONT OF HER,\r\n\r\n          THE WATER HAS RECEDED INTO THE GULF SOME 100 YARDS. THE DARK\r\n\r\n          SANDY BOTTOM LOOKS ODD STRETCHED OUT SO FAR. A STORM CELL\r\n\r\n          SITS MASSED ON THE HORIZON. CHURNING BLACK CLOUDS FILLED\r\n\r\n          WITH LAYERS OF HORIZONTAL LIGHTNING.\r\n          Behind Samantha, Curtis appears in the open sliding door\r\n          clutching Hannah. The Storm Cell is reflected in the glass\r\n          next to him.\r\n\r\n                          CURTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Sam.\r\n          Samantha looks down at her palm. She rubs the thick, viscous\r\n          rain in her fingers. She looks back up at the storm.\r\n          On Samantha's face,\r\n\r\n                          SAMANTHA\r\n           Okay.\r\n\r\n           THE END.\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nTake Shelter\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Jeff Nichols\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb", "summary": "After the death of her husband, Dr. Cara Harding's (Julianne Moore) faith in God has been shaken, but not her belief in science. In an attempt to get her more open to accepting unexplainable psychiatric theories, her father (Jeffrey DeMunn) introduces her to Adam (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a patient with multiple personalities who also takes on some of the physical characteristics of his other personalities. Cara quickly discovers that his other personalities were murder victims; and the more she finds out about Adam and his past, the closer she and her loved ones are to becoming victims themselves."}

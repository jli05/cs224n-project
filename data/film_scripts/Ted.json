He has a couple\r\n          stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's\r\n          evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's\r\n          been around for three decades.

He raises it to empty the\r\n          remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity\r\n          Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much,\r\n          though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that\r\n          this is a guy who has never really given up his\r\n          childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear.

The girl is\r\n          gamely tolerating it, but is clearly not digging the\r\n          moves. John thrusts his butt back in one move,\r\n          accidentally bumping a girl behind him with enough force\r\n          to send her sprawling on the floor. As the crowd reacts\r\n          to this, we see that it is Lori.

A few beats go by, then the window\r\n          slides open from the outside, and Ted tumbles in, landing\r\n          on the floor, soaked.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN\r\n                          JESUS--\r\n                         \r\n          Ted shakes the water off himself like a dog.

Eventually, he stumbles\r\n          into the bathroom, and crashes through the shower door,\r\n          shattering it. He and Ted exchange punches to the face.\r\n          John lands a particularly hard one, which sends Ted\r\n          flying across the room, and slamming into the wall. Ted\r\n          hits the floor, and runs out of the bathroom. John\r\n          stumbles to his feet. Ted scrambles across the bed,\r\n          reaches into the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Bible.\r\n          John staggers out of the bathroom, just in time to be\r\n          pelted in the head as Ted throws the Bible at him.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN (CONT'D)\r\n           AAAAAA!!! Fucking Jesus fucking Christ!\r\n           god fucking dammit!!!\r\n          Ted throws other objects at him, including beer cans and\r\n          the phone. John and Ted stare at each other for a beat,\r\n          each one breathing heavily (Ted is now on the floor).\r\n          John charges at Ted, sailing across the bed, and tackling\r\n          him, knocking over the side table and lamp in the\r\n          process. John and Ted scuffle on the floor, engaging in\r\n          a realistic-as-possible fistfight. Each one gets a\r\n          number of blows in. John throws Ted off him, and back\r\n          onto the bed. Ted taunts him.\r\n                         \r\n                          TED\r\n           C'mon, motherfucker!\r\n                         \r\n          John jumps at Ted, throwing a jab at him. But Ted\r\n          dodges, and John's fist goes into the wall above the\r\n          headboard. He struggles to pull free as he flails about\r\n          with his other hand, grabbing at Ted. Ted dodges again,\r\n          and scrambles up John's head, jumping up and grabbing the\r\n          chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted\r\n          to swing back and forth. John pulls free, and stumbles\r\n          backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing\r\n          lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall,\r\n          and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out\r\n          of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord\r\n          catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from\r\n          John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and\r\n          cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down,\r\n          whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the\r\n          bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach,\r\n          clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He\r\n          jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the\r\n          clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor,\r\n          yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his\r\n          bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks\r\n          blindly at Ted. He turns over, kicking ted in the face,\r\n          and kicking the cabinet that the TV is on.\r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                          94\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n                         \r\n          The TV wobbles, and falls off the cabinet, landing with a\r\n          crash, right on his groin. John lies there, with the TV\r\n          on his crotch and his pants down, and breathes heavily.\r\n          Ted, still dazed from the kick to the face, crawls over\r\n          to him. Both breathe heavily. John's breathing\r\n          deteriorates into sobs.\r\n                         \r\n                          TED (CONT'D)\r\n                          (BREATHING HEAVILY)\r\n           Why...why are you crying?\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN\r\n           My dick is in the TV.\r\n                         \r\n          John continues to sob. Ted climbs down off the table and\r\n          up onto the bed. He pushes the TV off John, then lies\r\n          down next to him.

He puts\r\n          his foot on the brakes, and the car screeches as it\r\n          drastically reduces speed. John's car slams into Donny's\r\n          causing Ted to go flying back through open rear window of\r\n          Donny's car, past Robert (who is still in the way back)\r\n          and tumbling into the back seat.\r\n                         \r\n                          TED\r\n           God dammit!\r\n                         \r\n          Ted gets his bearings, and notices the sack that Donny\r\n          captured him in, lying on the floor. He looks up at\r\n          Donny for a beat, then grabs the sack.\r\n                         \r\n          ANGLE ON Donny driving. Suddenly, Ted jumps up from\r\n          behind, and throws the sack over Donny's head, bracing\r\n          himself against the back of the front seat. Donny yells\r\n          in anger, and pulls at Ted, trying to get him off.\r\n                          117\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          Donny grabs Ted and flings him off his face, onto the\r\n          floor on the passengers' side. Donny rips the sack off\r\n          his head, and reacts as he looks out the front window.\r\n          He's approaching the end of the tunnel, and there is\r\n          opposing traffic moving in the other direction.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS\r\n          Donny swerves past the traffic, narrowly avoiding\r\n          clipping one of the cars. A moment later, John and Lori\r\n          come racing out of the tunnel. However, a truck drives\r\n          through the intersection, stopping them in their tracks.\r\n                         \r\n                          LORI\r\n           Shit!\r\n                         \r\n          She pounds on the steering wheel, frantically willing the\r\n          truck to get out of the way. Finally it does, and they\r\n          continue on into the city.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          Donny's car races through the streets, pursued by John\r\n          and Lori, who are catching up again, but are still a ways\r\n          behind.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. DONNY'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          Ted is still on the floor on the passenger's seat side.\r\n          He looks around, and spots a \"Club\" underneath the seat.\r\n          He glances at Donny, whose eyes are on the road. Ted\r\n          grabs the club, and scrambles up the seat, taking a swing\r\n          at Donny. Donny ducks out of the way, and tries to slap\r\n          Ted away as Ted continues to takes swings at him. A few\r\n          of them land, eventually drawing blood. Donny smacks Ted\r\n          away. Ted tumbles back onto the passenger's seat. Then,\r\n          with determination, he grabs the Club again, scurries in\r\n          front of Donny, and locks the Club onto the steering\r\n          wheel with a snap! Donny's eyes widen as Ted scrambles\r\n          into the back seat. Donny tries to turn the wheel, but\r\n          can't.\r\n                          118\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. BOSTON CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Donny's car swerves out of control, veering up the\r\n          street, and crashing into a lamppost, fishtailing as it\r\n          impacts. The airbags go off as the car comes to a stop.\r\n          Taking advantage of the situation, Ted scrambles out the\r\n          back window. He catches his fur on a jagged shard of\r\n          glass, slightly ripping his side. He hangs and struggles\r\n          for a bit, then drops to the ground. He sways a bit.\r\n          TED'S POV - We see that his vision is swimming slightly.\r\n          That little rip has done something... He shakes it off,\r\n          and runs up the sidewalk. ANGLE ON DONNY, who scrambles\r\n          out of the wrecked car, followed by Robert. They chase\r\n          Ted up the street. Ted spots a garage with the door\r\n          slightly open. He squeezes himself underneath, and\r\n          disappears inside.\r\n          ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - They screech to a stop behind\r\n          Donny's car. They hurry out, just in time to see Donny\r\n          and Robert duck underneath the door. They run up the\r\n          sidewalk after them.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. UNDERGROUND AREA - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          Ted runs down a ramp, looking frantically around for an\r\n          escape route. He darts off to the left, sprinting up a\r\n          ramp, followed by Donny and Robert. Ted stops at a red\r\n          metal fence, and squeezes through, rushing up the stairs\r\n          on the other side. Donny reaches the fence, but with his\r\n          larger size he has to climb over the top, which slows him\r\n          down a bit.\r\n                         \r\n          ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - We catch them ducking in through\r\n          the garage door, and running inside. They look around\r\n          for a beat. ANGLE ON ROBERT, who turns and sees them\r\n          (Donny has already made it over the fence). ANGLE BACK\r\n          ON JOHN.\r\n                         \r\n           ROBERT (O.S.)\r\n           NO!!\r\n                         \r\n          John and Lori turn just in time to see Robert charging at\r\n          them!\r\n                         \r\n                          ROBERT (CONT'D)\r\n           You can't have my teddy bear!!\r\n                         \r\n          When Robert reaches John, John knocks him down with one\r\n          punch to the face. Robert collapses. Lori and John look\r\n          down at him.\r\n                         \r\n                          LORI\r\n           Oh my god.\r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                          119\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n                         \r\n                          JOHN\r\n           Sorry, someone had to go Joan Crawford on\r\n           that kid.\r\n                          (THEN)\r\n           Come on!\r\n                         \r\n          John and Lori run up the ramp, leaving a stunned Robert\r\n          behind. When they reach the red fence, they look around,\r\n          but it's unclear which way Ted and Donny have gone. John\r\n          continues up the ramp (in the wrong direction) with Lori\r\n          just behind him.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          Ted runs as fast as his stubby legs will carry him.\r\n          Donny is in pursuit, and getting closer. The chase moves\r\n          past a concession area, and up a few flights of stairs.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. UPPER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          Ted runs out onto the upper level, and stops. The camera\r\n          PIVOTS 180 DEGREES and ascends to reveal the expanse of\r\n          FENWAY PARK down below. A few lights are on, and one\r\n          lone maintenance man sweeps the dirt. Donny emerges from\r\n          the stairwell, which snaps Ted out of it. Ted sprints\r\n          past the front row of seats, and comes to a dead end. He\r\n          has nowhere else to go. With Donny closing in, Ted\r\n          scurries out onto the ledge, and pulls himself up onto\r\n          the lighting tower. He looks down. From TED'S POV, it's\r\n          a long drop. Donny reaches out to grab him, but can't\r\n          quite reach. Donny glances down at the drop for a beat,\r\n          then pulls himself out onto the ledge to go after Ted.\r\n          Ted climbs farther up the tower.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

CLOSE UP ON TED'S FACE -\r\n          His eyes go wide, and for a moment, his face freezes with\r\n          fear. TED'S POV - His vision swims a bit more.

You\r\n           may kiss the bride.\r\n                         \r\n          John and Lori kiss each other. They turn and wave to the\r\n          cheering crowd. Ted waves happily to John, who waves\r\n          back. John and Lori run down the aisle joyfully, passing\r\n          pews full of people from the movie: Lori's co-workers,\r\n          John's co-workers, (Guy sitting with HIS BOYFRIEND, Alix\r\n          and Tanya, etc.).\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. OLD BOSTON CHURCH - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          John and Lori come running out of the church, as the\r\n          crowd throws rice at them. They run to a waiting limo\r\n          with a \"Just Married\" sign on the back. John gets in,\r\n          and Lori turns to throw the bouquet toward Gina,\r\n          Michelle, Tracy, and Tanya. Tanya catches it. She turns\r\n          and smiles at Alix. Then suddenly, Tami-Lynn bursts into\r\n          frame, punching Tanya in the jaw. Tanya goes down as\r\n          Tami-Lynn tackles her, and the crowd tries to pull her\r\n          off. ANGLE ON the limo as it pulls away...\r\n                         \r\n          Ted stands next to Sam J. Jones, watching with a smile as\r\n          his best friend heads off.\r\n                         \r\n                          TED\r\n           Y'know Sam, there's only one way to end a\r\n           perfect day.\r\n                         \r\n                          SAM JONES\r\n           What's that?\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          TED\r\n           On three.\r\n                         \r\n                          SAM JONES\r\n           What on three?\r\n                         \r\n                          TED\r\n           Flash jump.\r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                          128\r\n                         CONTINUED:\r\n                         \r\n                          SAM JONES\r\n                          (REALIZING)\r\n           Right.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n           One... two... three.\r\n                         \r\n          DOWNSHOT Ted and Sam Jones leap into the air at the same\r\n          time...\r\n                         \r\n           TED/SAM JONES\r\n           YEAH!!!\r\n                         \r\n          They freeze frame in mid-air, as the Flash Gordon theme\r\n          kicks in.

The wish coincides with a shooting star and comes true; word spread and Ted was briefly a celebrity.\nIn 2012, John and Ted are still living in Boston\u2014aged 35 and 27 respectively\u2014 and are still staunch companions enjoying a hedonistic life. John is dating Lori Collins. As their anniversary approaches, Lori hopes to marry John but feels he could not move forward with Ted around. John is hesitant against making Ted leave, but he is persuaded to act when they find Ted at home with four prostitutes.\nJohn finds Ted his own apartment and a job at a grocery store, where Ted begins dating his coworker Tami-Lynn. Lori learns that John has been skipping work\u2014using her as an excuse\u2014to continue to spend most of his time with Ted. Things start to come to a head when John and Lori are invited to a party put on by Lori's womanizing manager Rex, and Ted lures John away to a party at his apartment with the offer to meet Sam J. Jones, the star of their favorite film, Flash Gordon. Although John intends to stay only a few minutes, he gets caught up in the occasion. Lori finds John there and breaks up with him. John blames Ted for ruining his life and tells him to stay away.\nJohn and Ted confront each other about their ruined friendship and manage to reconcile after a violent brawl in John's hotel room. To repair John's relationship with Lori, Ted arranges with an old lover, singer Norah Jones, to help by having John express his love for Lori with a song during her concert. Although John's performance proves an embarrassment, Lori is touched by the attempt and returns to her apartment after being angered by Rex's sneering of him. Ted comes clean to Lori about his role in John's relapse and offers to leave them alone forever if she can talk to him. Lori is persuaded, but moments after she leaves, Ted is kidnapped by Donny, an obsessive stalker who idolized Ted as a child. Donny plans to make Ted the toy of his brutish son Robert. Ted distracts Robert and reaches a phone to contact John, but he is immediately recaptured. Realizing Ted is in danger, John and Lori locate Donny's residence and track him to rescue Ted. The chase leads to Fenway Park, where John punches Robert, but during the chase, Ted is damaged and falls onto the field ripped entirely in half. A police car arrives, forcing Donny to flee. As John and Lori gather Ted's stuffing, Ted relays his wish that John be happy with Lori, as the magic that gives him life fades away.\nUnable to accept Ted's death, a distraught John and Lori attempt to repair Ted, which proves useless. That night, Lori feels guilty about the incident, and makes a wish on a shooting star. The next morning, John hangs his head while looking over Ted's dead body. Fortunately, Ted is magically restored and after he tricks John into thinking he is retarded, he and Lori fully reconcile with Ted, who encourages them to resume their relationship. With that resolution, John and Lori are married (with Sam Jones as the presiding minister), and Ted comfortably accepts having a life of his own as he and Tami-Lynn continued their torrid love affair. One afternoon, Ted was caught behind the deli counter eating potato salad off of Tami-Lynn's bare bottom. He was instantly promoted to store manager. Sam Jones attempts to restart his career and moves into a studio apartment with Brandon Routh. Rex gives up his pursuit of Lori, goes into a deep depression, and dies of Lou Gehrig's disease. Donny gets arrested by the Boston Police Department for kidnapping a plush toy, but the charges are dropped because they sound ridiculous. Robert hires a personal trainer, loses a significant amount of weight, and goes on to become Taylor Lautner."}

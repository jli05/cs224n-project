IRAQI DESERT - DAY\n\n     WIDE ANGLE POV of wide open desert, flat grey sky.\n\n     THE CAMERA is running forward, toward a big sand berm in the\n     distance. There are O.S. sounds: SOLDIER'S EQUIPMENT\n     CLANKING, BOOTS RUNNING ON SAND. Hear a MAN's BREATHING.\n\n     The back of his helmeted head and his uniformed shoulders\n     APPEAR in the BOTTOM of the FRAME, running. This is TROY\n     BARLOW, Sargeant, U.S. Army, 25 years old. On his helmet is\n     a photo-button with a photo of a newborn baby.\n\n     Suddenly, on the sand berm 100 meters ahead, an IRAQI SOLDIER\n     stands. Troy stops in his tracks, out of breath, and stares\n     at the figure on the berm. The Iraqi flutters a white flag\n     over his head, then puts it down and picks up a gun. Troy\n     turns around, we see his face for the first time.\n\n                         TROY\n               Are we shooting people, or what?\n\n                         SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)\n               Are we shooting?\n\n                         TROY\n               That's what I'm asking you.\n\n                         SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)\n               What's the answer?\n\n                         TROY\n               I don't know the answer. That's\n               what I'm trying to find out.\n\n     PAN TO THREE SOLDIERS 40 yards away -- ZOOM IN --\n\n     SOLDIER #1 unwraps a stick of gum and puts it into his mouth.\n     TWO OTHER SOLDIERS put out their hands and get pieces of gum.\n\n     PAN TO 100 yards away -- ZOOM IN -- SOLDIER #2 stands with\n     his head tilted back while SOLDIER #3 looks into his eye.\n\n                         SOLDIER #3\n               It looks like a grain of sand, but\n               I don't know how I'm gonna get it\n               out--\n\n     CAPTAIN VAN METER, 37, crab-like, is in the far distance.\n\n                         CAPTAIN VAN METER\n               If they surrender, don't shoot, if\n               they don't surrender, then shoot.\n\n     PAN BACK TO Troy, faces the CAMERA, CLOSE, scared, then turns\n     back to the dune and runs a few yards.\n\n     Stops and stares, raises his rifle.  He aims at the figure on\n     the horizon.\n\n     POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\n\n     The Iraqi soldier in the cross hairs. Hear Troy's breathing,\n     loud, as he pulls trigger slowly.  Slow motion RIFLE sound.\n\n     Silent pause. The Iraqi soldier stands there, then his neck\n     explodes like a sack of blood. Silent, except for sound of\n     Troy's LOUD BREATHING as he walks toward the big berm, and up\n     to the crest. All we hear are his footsteps and breathing.\n\n                         SOLDIER #3 (O.S.)\n               That guy just shot a towel head.\n\n                         SOLDIER #4 (O.S.)\n               Bullshit.\n\n     YOUNG IRAQI SOLDIER\n\n     lies on the ground. A piece of his neck is blown away. He is\n     rasping, a flag is clasped in one hand; a rifle in the other.\n     He is looking up at Troy, who looks down at him.\n\n                                              SMASH CUT TO\n\n     FANTASY - INT.

Doc picks the case up.\n\n                         IRAQI MAJOR\n               You need a truck.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               We'll rig two carts.\n\n                         TROY\n               Let's take the truck.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               We're not taking their truck.\n\n                         TROY\n               Why not?\n\n                         IRAQI MAJOR\n               We cooperate with peace accord.\n               Please take truck.\n\n                         TROY\n               Let's take the truck.\n\n     Archie looks vaguely disgusted.\n\n     Troy backs the truck up.\n\n     Vuitton hat cases are loaded into the back of the truck,\n     which is completely full.\n\n     Archie sits behind the wheel of the Humvee. Vig sits next to\n     him. Archie starts the engine. Iraqi 6 taps on the door of\n     the Humvee by way of saying goodbye. Archie nods.\n\n     The Iraqi Major points to the Shiite Woman.\n\n                         IRAQI MAJOR\n               Nazaran yafit haisul.\n\n     Archie watches as Iraqis 6 & 7 walk directly to the circle of\n     soldiers around the woman -- it is now clear she has been\n     raped. They pull her from the group, they stand the Woman in\n     an open area and shoot her dead.\n\n     Troy jerks slightly in his seat and turns away. Doc stares.\n\n     Archie bows his head to the steering wheel and leans there\n     for a second as Vig looks wide-eyed at the dead woman.\n\n     The Girl in arm casts screams. She is grabbed by the hair and\n     pulled away by an Iraqi soldier, but the Man In Glasses\n     punches him and takes the girl. The soldier chases them with\n     a knife and jabs at the man, cutting him, but not lethally.\n\n     Archie gets out of the Humvee and slams the door, walks\n     slowly toward the Iraqi soldiers.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               This has to stop.\n\n     The Iraqis look at him. The soldier with the knife continues\n     to slash the Man In Glasses.\n\n                         INTERROGATOR\n               You get your ass kick in a war, it\n               feel good to be strong again.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               What did you say?\n\n                         IRAQI MAJOR\n               You go now, please.\n\n     He salutes Archie.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               I don't think so.

The plan is for gold, right?\n\n                         DOC\n               We can help them first, then be on\n               our way.\n\n                         TROY\n               No, we can't.

The Interrogator laughs.\n\n                         INTERROGATOR\n               Cannot do.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               What do you mean, cannot do? I'm\n               offering you a lot of money.\n\n     The Iraqi Major continues smiling.\n\n                         IRAQI MAJOR\n               Cannot let Shiite go --\n\n                         INTERROGATOR\n               Saddam kill us.\n\n                         IRAQI MAJOR\n               Saddam kill to me if we let them\n               go, OK? Now you go.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               Cover me.\n\n                         TROY\n               Jesus Christ, we can't save\n               everybody.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               Are you listening? I said cover me.\n\n     Troy and Doc stare at Archie, then Troy gets out of the\n     truck, Doc gets out of the Humvee, and they nervously point\n     their pistols. Troy points his gun at Iraqi 6, who has come\n     forward with a rifle; Doc points at Iraqi 7, who has also\n     come forward. To the rear, Iraqi 6 stands with a rifle, near\n     Iraqis 2,3,4 and the Sargeant stand over the eight\n     prone Shiite prisoners laying face down.\n\n     Vig nervously sits for a moment, then jumps to his feet and\n     mans the mounted machine gun in the rear of the Hummer.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               No unnecessary shots, Conrad, is\n               that clear?\n\n                         VIG\n               Yes, sir.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               Because we know what bullets do to\n               vital organs, don't we?\n\n                         VIG\n               Make infected pockets filled with\n               bile, sir.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               That's right, that's what they do.\n\n     Troy, Doc, Vig watch with trepidation as Archie walks toward\n     the soldier slashing the Man In Glasses, who carries the Girl.\n\n     Archie reaches over and grabs the slasher's wrist, pulling\n     the blade away from the man's body. He holds the soldier's\n     wrist up. The soldier grabs for Archie's throat with his free\n     hand, but Archie grabs this hand and twists it away, putting\n     the Iraqi into a choke hold. The soldier drops the knife in\n     the dirt.\n\n     The bloodied Man In Glasses collapses to the ground,\n     clutching the Little Girl in arm casts.\n\n     Troy, Doc, Vig point their guns. The Iraqi Major is pissed.\n\n     Archie sweeps the soldier's feet out, pins the soldier face\n     down on the ground, and throws the soldier's gun away. Archie\n     helps the Shiite Man In Glasses to his feet, takes the Girl,\n     and walks them over to the Humvee.\n\n     Two Shiite prisoners try to stand up, the Iraqi guards kick\n     them back down.\n\n                         IRAQI MAJOR\n                      (pissed)\n               U.S.A. is out of Shiite war.\n\n     The Iraqi Major raises his machine gun as he stands next to\n     the Humvee, but Archie grabs the barrel and holds it down.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               No shooting.\n\n     Troy looks scared as he points his pistol at the Iraqi\n     soldiers, who point their rifles back at Troy and Doc.\n\n     CUT BACK TO the Major pauses, then smashes the barrel of his\n     machine gun, with Archie's hand, against the Humvee.\n\n     Archie winces, but doesn't let go. The Major does it again,\n     smashing Archie's hand. Archie winces, doesn't let go. The\n     Major tries to jerk the barrel up, but Archie pushes it down,\n     and it fires by accident, into the Major's leg. The Major\n     howls with pain. Blood dribbles out the bottom of his pants\n     leg like piss.\n\n     Troy covers Iraqi 6 with his rifle.\n\n                         TROY\n               What's happening?\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               Accident. Stay cool.\n\n     Vig nervously swings the mounted machine gun from one Iraqi\n     in the rear to another, but doesn't shoot. Iraqi soldiers\n     point their rifles at the Americans.\n\n     ANGLE ON TROY\n\n                         TROY\n               No.\n\n     WHIP PAN TO Iraqi 6 jerks his rifle toward Archie and fires.\n\n     The sound cuts out.\n\n     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: WHIP PAN from Iraqi rifle to Archie.\n\n     The only SOUND is the BULLET PIERCING THE FLESH of Archie's\n     lower left arm and tearing his muscle as it passes through.\n     Archie grimaces violently in pain.\n\n     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: Troy fires his pistol. NO SOUND except\n     for the SLOW MOTION SOUND of the BULLET EXPLODING.\n\n     SLOW MOTION: The bullet tears through Iraqi 6's chest.\n\n     THE ONLY SOUND is the IRAQI'S HEARTBEAT, the bullet tearing\n     flesh and crushing bone, and the heartbeat stopping with a\n     VIOLENT SPLASH. Iraqi 6 falls to the ground with only a dull\n     thud and the slow clank of his gear.\n\n     REGULAR SPEED: Vig swings the mounted machine gun from one\n     Iraqi to another, but still doesn't shoot. He looks terrified\n     as his thumbs twitch on the triggers.\n\n     Iraqi 7 FIRES twice.\n\n     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: a bullet tears into Troy's chest with\n     a DULL SNAP. He winces in pain.\n\n     PAN TO the windshield of the Humvee shatters behind Doc; he\n     turns and fires his pistol.\n\n     PAN TO -- slightly slow motion: NO SOUND EXCEPT THE BULLET\n     TEARING INTO IRAQI 7'S KNEE, smashing through bone. He falls\n     to the ground clutching his leg.\n\n     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: Vig swings the mounted machine gun and\n     FIRES. NO SOUND BUT THE SLOW CRACKS OF THE RED TRACER BULLETS\n     EXPLODING from the gun.\n\n     SLOW MOTION: tracer bullets slice across the face of Iraqi 5\n     and Iraqi 2 in the rear, NO SOUND BUT THE BULLETS BREAKING\n     THROUGH BONE AND FLESH.\n\n     SLOW MOTION: Archie jams his pistol under the Major's chin\n     and FIRES -- the ONLY SOUND IS THE. SLOW EXPLOSION OF THE GUN,\n     and the slow tearing of tissue, ending with a sharp SNAP as\n     the tissue, bone, and the bullet CRACK out the top of the\n     Iraqi Major's head.\n\n     HIGH ANGLE LOOKING DOWN -- replay of entire shoot out at\n     REGULAR SPEED. Ending on the wide-eyed Little Girl with her\n     hand in her mouth, staring.\n\n     ANOTHER ANGLE -- replay of entire shoot out at REGULAR SPEED.\n     Ending on Troy wincing as he holds his chest.\n\n     The dead Iraqi Major lies face down in sand with eyes open;\n     the Interrogator holds his hand and WEEPS.\n\n     Archie's lightly blood-flecked face stares down at the dead\n     Major, clouds pass overhead.\n\n     Dead Iraqi 6 lies with legs twisted under his body.\n\n     A rivulet of blood trickles through the sand. A spider runs\n     across it and gets stuck.\n\n     LOW ANGLE up at Doc, stone still, staring straight ahead as\n     clouds pass slowly above him in the sky.\n\n     Vig nervously swings the mounted machine gun back and forth.\n\n     Troy, drenched in sweat, looks pained as he unbuttons his\n     shirt: there's a gunshot in his kevlar vest. The slug drops\n     out of the dent, into his hand -- he exhales.\n\n     Iraqis 2, 3, 4, and the Sargeant, throw their hands up in\n     surrender and drop their weapons.  Big Iraqi 2 walks toward\n     the Humvee in surrender, and bows down.\n\n     Archie points.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               Cover these three.\n\n     Vig swings the mounted machine gun toward the three remaining\n     Iraqi soldiers who stand over eight terrified Shiites.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               Doc.\n\n     Doc follows Archie over to the three Iraqi soldiers.\n\n                         DOC\n               Down.\n\n     The soldiers get on their knees, pleading for mercy.\n\n                         IRAQI SOLDIER\n               Kazal stan hamir in fatar.\n\n     Doc takes the Iraqi soldiers' guns and pushes them down.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               Put the Shiites in the Humvee.\n\n                         TROY\n               There's no room.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               Make room.\n\n                         TROY\n               What the fuck happened to\n               necessity?\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               It just changed.\n\n                         TROY\n               Not for me.\n\n     Shiites and Iraqi soldiers watch the debate nervously.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               Obey the fucking order, Barlow.\n\n                         TROY\n               This is fucked up.\n\n     Doc points to the Shiites.\n\n                         DOC\n               What if that was you?\n\n     Troy displays the gunshot in the Kevlar.\n\n                         TROY\n               What if this was you not wearing\n               Kevlar?\n\n     Suddenly, THE SOUND of an APPROACHING TANK.

MINEFIELD\n\n     The airborne Humvee lands on its side, hits another mine, is\n     blown into the air, lands on its back, and is blown to pieces.\n\n     Troy sits sideways as the truck slides across the sand to a\n     halt inches before a mine, 30 yards behind the wrecked Humvee.\n\n     SILENCE. A wheel on the wrecked Humvee spin in the air,\n     squeaking.\n\n     Louis Vuitton suitcases are scattered all over. One has\n     opened and the gold bars are spilled around.\n\n     Shiites stagger to their feet, some cut and bleeding, some\n     limping. They cover their faces with their clothes as the\n     dense brown fog descends around them.\n\n     Vig's right eye has taken shrapnel and is bloody mess -- he\n     gropes in the sand for his glasses as blood drips down.\n\n     Archie puts his gas mask on the Little Girl with arm casts.\n     Doc takes his mask off when he sees what Archie has done and\n     gives it to the Shiite Man in Glasses.\n\n     Doc picks up Vig's glasses and hands them to Vig, who stands,\n     blinking his one good eye, while blood streams down his face.\n\n                         DOC\n               Cover your face, Conrad. Cover\n               your mouth, man.\n\n     Vig is in shock. Doc lifts Vig's bloody hand to Vig's mouth.\n     Unseen in the fog, Troy climbs out of the overturned truck.\n\n     He picks up two Vuitton hat cases, looks up, sees the TWO\n     LITTLE CHILDREN from the Humvee, running across a mine field\n     SCREAMING.\n\n                         TROY\n               Hey.

DESERT - MINEFIELD\n\n     Troy chases the children through the brown fog, he drops one\n     of the suitcases, catches up to the Girl and scoops her up in\n     his left arm and covers her face with her coat.\n\n     TROY'S POV\n\n     as he runs between land mines after the Boy, who is way ahead.\n\n     BACK TO THE SCENE\n\n     Troy drops the other Vuitton bag, catches the Boy and has\n     both children under his arms like footballs -- when suddenly\n     Troy is grabbed from behind with a cord around his neck -- he\n     lands on his back with the two children in his arms.\n\n     TROY'S POV LOOKING UP\n\n     the Iraqi Interrogator, wearing a gas mask, kicks Troy in the\n     head. The screaming Children are torn from Troy's arms by\n     Iraqi soldiers. Troy reaches for his pistol and it is ripped\n     from his hand as he is dragged to an Iraqi jeep.\n\n     EXT.

The Infiniti, Rolls, Mercedes shoot over it,\n     arcing down toward the bunker, engines roaring.\n\n     EXT. OASIS BUNKER\n\n     It is quiet. A Slim Jim is unwrapped as an IRAQI GUARD slowly\n     raises it to his mouth, bites it, chews, and looks puzzled at\n     the cars approaching in the distance.\n\n     HIGH WIDE SHOT - looking straight down.\n\n     The cars drive three abreast down the approach road to the\n     bunker.

The two\n     guards point their guns at Vig and the Shiite and they run\n     into the desert as bullets pop around them.\n\n     EXT. RIGHT SIDE OF BUNKER\n\n     Archie skids the Mercedes to a halt on the right side of the\n     bunker, jumps out, slams the door, followed by Imam and the\n     two other Shiites.\n\n     They run toward the bunker, Archie with a wad of plastic\n     explosive and nails in one hand and a cigarette lighter in\n     the other. He HEARS the CHIRP of a car alarm being activated\n     as he runs to the bunker.\n\n     Imam finds a vent hole on the low facade of the bunker, pulls\n     off a grill. Archie lights a fuse sticking out of the plastic\n     explosive, and drops it into the vent.\n\n     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\n\n     Troy gags and spits, his front is covered in oil.

SIDE OF BUNKER\n\n     Archie and Imam run back to the Mercedes, but the car is\n     locked, his pistol sits inside on the front seat. A GUNSHOT\n     from the bunker roof shatters the window of the Mercedes,\n     setting off THE CAR ALARM.\n\n     Archie reaches in, grabs his pistol, and bolts as a launched\n     grenade blows the Mercedes.\n\n     EXT. FRONT OF BUNKER - DAY\n\n     12 Iraqi soldiers pour out of the smoking bunker as 3 Shiite\n     riflemen with Doc fire on them. Two Iraqis go down, with only\n     the sound of bullets piercing their flesh.\n\n     6 Iraqis run for it, into the desert. 2 Iraqis throw their\n     hands up in surrender while 2 look ambivalent, one holds a\n     stack of new Levis. Doc raises a hand to stop his Shiite\n     gunmen from firing, but they fire anyway and 3 Iraqis fire\n     back -- the Shiite next to Doc is hit in the face.\n\n                         DOC\n               Stop shooting, what's the matter\n               with you?\n\n     He reaches out and holds the rifle of a Shiite. Everyone\n     stops firing, slowly the Iraqis drop their guns. Doc has WET\n     HIS PANTS.\n\n     Archie runs up from the right, grabs Doc's arm and they run\n     past surrendering Iraqi soldiers and into the front entrance.\n     of the bunker. Imam takes cover on the side of the bunker\n     while Shiites and Iraqis aim at each other.\n\n     Vig approaches cautiously from the desert, HEARS AN AIRCRAFT,\n     and looks up. An Iraqi helicopter comes in fast and opens\n     FIRE with MACHINE GUNS --\n\n                         VIG\n               Shit.\n\n     Vig runs toward the bunker for cover, but is cut off by\n     MACHINE GUN FIRE from THE CHOPPER. Shiites FIRE rifles up at\n     the chopper.\n\n     INT. IRAQI CHOPPER\n\n     Chips of metal and plastic fly off as bullets hit the\n     chopper. Arabic chatter is heard over a crackling radio.\n\n     POV - FROM INSIDE THE CHOPPER\n\n     100 feet below -- Vig and six remaining Shiite riflemen are\n     running into the desert away from the chopper.\n\n     EXT. DESERT -  DAY\n\n     Vig and the six Shiites frantically search for cover.\n\n     The chopper FIRES and one of the Shiites running with Vig is\n     hit in the head, thrown by the force of the gunshot into Vig,\n     who goes down, faking it.\n\n     Vig lies face down, out of breath, with the dead Shiite on\n     top of him while the chopper hovers above.\n\n                         VIG\n               Jesus God, I don't wanna get hit,\n               please Jesus, watch over me --\n\n     INT. BUNKER\n\n     It is dimly lighted by a few mounted emergency lights.\n\n     Archie and Doc run down the empty stairs, through the big\n     main room -- it is empty.

He\n     approaches and kicks it repeatedly, without success.\n\n     Archie kicks in a door -- it is pitch black -- an emergency\n     light flickers on and off -- revealing the two Iraqi\n     torturers at the control table, where one tries to fix the\n     emergency light with a screwdriver --\n\n     In flickering light -- Archie SHOOTS one Iraqi guard squarely\n     in the chest, then the other -- the only SOUND IS THE GUN\n     POPPING and the BULLETS TEARING into their bodies.\n\n     Archie turns to the Interrogator, who stands next to Troy.\n\n                         INTERROGATOR\n               It's OK, buddy, we are just\n               talking now --\n\n     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- Archie shoots the Interrogator in the\n     thigh. THE ONLY SOUND IS GUN SHOOTING, FLESH TEARING --\n\n     Blood thinly splatters across Troy's face as the Interrogator\n     grimaces and falls to the floor. The light flicks on a few\n     beats, then off a few beats.\n\n     Archie rips the wires from the table controls, goes to Troy,\n     unhinges the wire from his jaw.\n\n     The Interrogator writhes in pain on the ground. Archie takes\n     the Interrogator's pistol, snaps open a knife, cuts the cord\n     binding Troy to the chair and gives Troy the pistol.\n\n     Troy sits, stained with oil, blood, tears. He gets up, looks\n     down at the interrogator on the floor, points the pistol into\n     the Interrogator's face.\n\n     The Interrogator stares at Troy, who stares back. Archie\n     watches, out of breath. Troy FIRES the gun just to the side\n     of the Interrogator's face, into the ground. The Interrogator\n     looks terrified, crying. Troy stares back, looks unhappy,\n     lowers the gun.\n\n     Troy and Archie look at each other for an intense moment.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               Let's go.\n\n     INT.

They release\n     the safeties. Havichon, with his leg in a cast, stays back to\n     man the mounted machine gun on the Humvee.

Troy\n     cannot jog, he crouches down, and is passed by the others.\n     The Shiites look up at the choppers as they jog. Doc and\n     Walter look up also. Archie does not.\n\n     Havichon in the Humvee swings the mounted gun up to the\n     choppers as they pass overhead, loud.\n\n     PAN UP TO Six Apaches hover over everyone's heads and land in\n     the 50 yards between Archie and the border, blocking his\n     path, blowing up dust.\n\n     Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, the Shiites turn and wince in the\n     blowing sand.\n\n     10 U.S. MILITARY POLICE jump from the landing choppers,\n     followed by another TEN U.S. TROOPS with rifles.\n\n     Iraqi soldiers watch apprehensively.\n\n     M.P.S grab Archie, Troy, And Doc, and pull them away from\n     the Shiites.\n\n     Troy shouts over the choppers.\n\n                         TROY\n               Wait.\n\n     U.S. soldiers push the Shiites toward the border.\n\n     The Shiites, including two who carry Vig's body, run toward\n     the border unaccompanied by American protection.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               Let them get over the border.\n\n     Troy pulls away from MPS, resisting arrest.\n\n                         TROY\n               Let them get over, wait --\n\n     Plastic handcuffs are put onto Troy, behind his back.\n\n                         TROY\n               I have to reach this --\n\n     Archie and Doc, not resisting, are handcuffed in front --\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               Put his cuffs in front.\n\n     He and Doc are pulled away from Troy.\n\n     Iraqi soldiers take the Shiites prisoner, grabbing them,\n     throwing some to the ground.

Troy and Doc, held in custody,\n     watch.  The General makes a 'CUT' signal to the choppers --\n     and the chopper engines cut off and whir down; it grows QUIET.\n\n     THE U.S. Soldiers -- holding Walter and the Drivers in\n     custody -- stand and watch Archie.\n\n                         GENERAL HORN\n               How much do you have?\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               4 tons.\n\n     General Horn picks up a gold brick.\n\n                         GENERAL HORN\n               Where's it at?\n\n                         TROY\n               Get them over first.\n\n                         ARCHIE GATES\n               They helped us get it, Ron.

None of them allows the others to prosper and creates trouble for each other in whatever they do. Their parents have taken money from a money lender called Dinakaran who has given the money on lease of the place. When the debts increased, the three realized that they cannot repay the money and get back the palace and so they try to steal the papers from Dinakaran's house with the help of his daughters who were having affairs with the three kings. But Dinakaran catches them and hands them over to the police.\nIn the police lockup, they happen to hear from a blind man that there is a treasure hidden somewhere in the Mysore forest which belonged to their family. He says that this was hidden by Tipu Sultan centuries back. He can help them if they promise to give him a portion of it. But that night, his illness becomes worse and he dies on his way to the hospital, but he hands the three a map of the treasure before he leaves the cell.\nThe three kings leave to Mysore to find the treasure. Each of them takes a different route and tries to be there first and make the treasure their own, but ultimately they have join hands because each of them had only one portion of the map which they split while having a fight in the police lockup. Finally they finds the treasure but it turns out that everything was a forged play and they were part of a reality show which a popular channel organized. They all end up humiliated because cameras were following them every moment and caught all their fights on camera and broadcast it.\nBut during one of the fights they had inside the cave, it turns out that the three kings misplaced the gold idol kept by the channel and took the real golden idol itself. This makes them all rich and they take back the palace form the money lender. The three kings get married with their lovers and they gets three kids. In the final scene, it is shown that the three kids are also fighting with each other the same way their fathers did when they were kids showing us that the legacy continues."}

The space ranger\nsuggests a few tips for the dinosaur.  Rex tries again, this\ntime giving a \"JURASSIC PARK\" ROAR.\n\nThe roar blasts Potato Head's features right off his face.\n\nF) Woody passes Etch-A-Sketch, who's sporting a portrait of\nBuzz.\n\nWoody looks across the room to see Buzz combing Troll Doll's\nhair, chatting away like a hair dresser.\n\nWoody angrily shakes Etch, removing Buzz's image.\n\nG) Rocky, Snake, Troll Doll and Rex are lifting Tinkertoys\nas weights.  Buzz works out on top of an upside down Robot,\nusing his feet as a treadmill.\n\nPotato Head attempts to lift his Tinkertoy barbell but ends\nup tumbling backwards, leaving his arms connected to the\nbarbell.\n\nH) Woody looks under the bed for Slinky, finding only the\ncheckerboard.\n\nWoody peeks around the corner of the bed to see Slinky and\nRobot, under Buzz's direction, setting Buzz's \"ship\" up on\ntop of ABC blocks for repair.\n\nIn frustration, Woody kicks the checkerboard, sending the\npieces flying.  One of the checkers ricochets off the\ndresser and boomerangs into Woody's mouth.\n\nI) On Andy's bed, Buzz pets Slinky whose back end is\nstretched over to the other side where Woody sits.  Slinky's\nwagging tail whacks Woody in the face repeatedly.\n\nWoody shoves Slinky's rear end off the bed, leaving his\nfront end no choice but to eventually follow.\n\nJ) At bedtime, Andy loads his toys into the toybox until\njust Woody and Buzz are left.  He deliberates as to which\ntoy to keep and which to toss into the toybox.\n\nINT.

With his family moving away one week before his birthday, Andy is given a week-early party to spend with his friends, while the toys stage a reconnaissance mission to discover Andy's new presents. Andy receives a spaceman action figure named Buzz Lightyear, whose impressive features see him replacing Woody as Andy's favorite toy. Woody becomes resentful, especially when he notices that Buzz also gets attention from the other toys. However, Buzz believes himself to be a real space ranger on a mission to return to his home planet, while Woody tries to convince him that he is just a toy.\nAs Andy prepares for a family outing at Pizza Planet, his mother allows him to bring only one toy along. Fearing Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap Buzz behind a desk, but the plan ends in failure when Woody accidentally knocks Buzz out the window, which results in the other toys turning against Woody by accusing him of eliminating Buzz out of jealousy. Now that Buzz is missing, Andy reluctantly takes Woody to Pizza Planet, but Buzz climbs into the car and confronts Woody when they stop at a gas station. As they fight, they fall out of the van, which drives off and leaves them behind. While Buzz still believes he is a real space ranger, Woody spots a Pizza Planet delivery truck and convinces him that it can take him to a space port. As Woody looks for Andy at Pizza Planet, Buzz sees a rocket-shaped skill game and jumps inside, mistaking it for a real spaceship. Woody follows him in it, but Andy's toy-abusing neighbor, Sid Phillips, arrives and operates the machine, maneuvering the claw to snag Buzz and Woody who are then taken to his house.\nAt Sid's house, Woody and Buzz try to escape before Andy's moving day, encountering Sid's abused toy creations and his vicious bull terrier Scud. During an attempt, Buzz sees a commercial for Buzz Lightyear action figures and realizes that he is actually a toy himself. Disbelieving, he attempts to prove that he could fly, but falls and crashes down the stairs, breaks his left arm off and becomes depressed. Woody sees Andy's other toys from a distance and cannot convince them that Buzz is alive. After Sid's toys fix Buzz's arm to Woody's surprise, Sid decides to blow up the space ranger with a firework rocket, but a thunderstorm delays the plan. That night, Woody tells Buzz that he can bring joy to Andy as a toy, reinvigorating his spirit. The next morning, Woody and Sid's toys rescue Buzz and scare Sid into no longer abusing toys by coming to life in front of him. Woody and Buzz then leave Sid's house just as Andy's mother drives away toward their new house.\nThey manage to climb onto the moving truck, but Scud chases after them and tries to pull Woody off the truck. Buzz tackles the dog and is left behind. Woody tries rescuing Buzz with Andy's RC car, but the other toys, still thinking Woody is eliminating fellow toys, attack the cowboy and toss him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC pickup Woody and continue after the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize their mistake and try to help them get back aboard but RC's batteries become depleted, stranding them. Woody then ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into the truck before they soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket before it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the van, right next to Andy.\nOn Christmas, at their new house, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile."}

That's all Mr. X needs, and another\n          shot rings out while he's still on a dead run. THWAP!\n          The bullet finds its mark in the yelping man's forehead,\n          silencing him, just as...\n          .Mr. X ducks behind a stairwell door.\n          He pulls up his right hand and looks down the barrel of\n          this pistol: built into the barrel is thin c u r\n          screen. It actually shows the heat signatures of the\n          three remaining marksmen, one of which is directly in\n          front of him, hiding behind a small rooftop supply shed.\n          A second marksmen is just on the other side of the\n          stairwell. The third is on the far side of the rooftop.\n          Mr. X takes another look at the heat signature of the\n          marksman hiding behind the shed and he FIRES his gun...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          5.\n\n          /~,\n          ...then does an amazing thing: in the split second that\n          the bullet travels forward, he jerks his gun to the\n          side... actually steering the bullet around the wall and\n          into the ksman's throat.\n          Before the guy's blood hits the ground, the assassin is\n          moving again: he dashes away from the stairwell then\n          makes two incredible shots; one knocks a piece of\n          aluminum off the top of the stairwell...\n          ..which causes it to flip up in the air above the head\n          of the hiding marksman...\n          . the second shot strikes the aluminum again, ,,..,sending\n          the bullet ricocheting down into the ton of the\n          marksman's heads As he falls...\n          THE CAMERA MOVES OVER TO WHERE... the FINAL MARKSMAN is\n          breathing hard, like an engine with a chronic misfire, as\n          he looks out at the dead bodies of his fallen comrades...\n          all chopped down in a matter of seconds.\n          He squeezes his eyes shut, trying to psyche himself up...\n\n          LAST MARKSMAN\n\n          (SOFTLY)\n          C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.\n          He looks out at the stairwell door... and all is quiet.\n          Maybe Mr. X didn't know he was there, maybe he left,\n          maybe the last marksman can sneak away after all.\n\n          LAST MARKSMEN\n\n          (SOFTLY)\n          Okay... okay...\n          He finally decides...\n          .and takes one step forward...\n          THWAP1!1 A bullet disintegrates his knee.\n          He falls, clutching the knee in agony, as Mr. X walks\n          toward him slowly until he stands right over him like a\n          hunter over his prey.\n          Mr. X's shoe comes down on the final marksman's wrist,\n          pinning it away from his dropped weapon.\n\n          MR.

He backs up to a pallet of\n          stacked newspapers, using it as cover. What he doesn't\n          realize is that between each stack of papers is a space,\n          just big enough for a --\n          THWAP!

Just as\n          Wesley is about to cut him down, Cross fires at a wooden\n          beam holding back some massive rolls of NEWSPAPER. The\n          rolls tumble over and Wesley has to dive out of the way,\n          allowing Cross to escape up the stairs.\n          Wesley, Fox and the Waiter all race for the stairs.\n\n          ON LEVEL TWO:\n          Giant printing machines are running full speed, printing\n          up the morning edition.\n          A group of NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES see the guns the\n          Fraternity members are toting and scramble for safety.\n          Wesley has to yell to be heard over the whirring\n          machines...\n\n          WESLEY\n          (to the Waiter)\n          Stay here and cover us.

Everything looks clear, until...\n          ...shots ring out and a shelf o w a1l o\n          Waiter's head gives way! He turns to see a bunch of cans\n          of spray lubricant falling to the floor.

The place is\n          already in pandemonium, with PEOPLE yelling and screaming\n          and running for cover. Quickly, Wesley realizes he's in\n          the business offices of the paper, and it looks\n          surprisingly similar to his old office.

Without hesitation, Wesley opens fire at\n          Cross... who immediately returns fire...\n          .and his bullets actually collide with Cross's by ets\n          in mid-air!!! The bullets ricochet and take out a\n          COMPUTER SCREEN where someone was playing SOLITAIRE.\n          The two assassins blast away, all while diving and moving\n          over and in the cubicles. Cross has a gun similar to the\n          Imanishis, and they each steer their bullets at each\n          other from sharp angles...\n          Strangely,. the first bullet collision was not blind luck,\n          but the pattern for the battle. They are fighting the\n          same fight, their bullets meeting in the middle, each man\n          using the same techniques at the exact same time.\n          Wesley needs an angle, and spots a DRY ERASE BOARD the\n          words \"Action Items\" written on it. He fires at it, and\n          his bullets bounce off it at an angle where one of them\n          strikes Cross in the shoulder... THWAP!!!\n          Cross can't believe he's hit but he doesn't have time to\n          flinch... right as Wesley fires again, he turns, barely\n          avoiding the rain of bullets and leaps through a nearby\n          window, smashing the glass out,\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          76.\n          Wesley doesn't hesitate behind him... he sprints for the\n          same window and dives through it, guns at the ready\n          and...\n\n          OUTSIDE THE WINDOW:\n          .we stay with Wesley as he falls from the third floor,\n          firing his guns the whole time...\n          .until he lands top of an \"L\" train moving at ll\n          speed.\n\n          THE WAREHOUSE DISTRICT:\n          Fox limps out of the newspaper building and hurries to\n          the Porsche.

SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING\n\n          The Harley pulls up to a lower-middle-class house, the\n          kind you might find in any run-down suburb. Kids run\n          around the neighborhood, playing.\n\n          ON THE BIKE:\n          Wesley sits and looks at one particular house. He climbs\n          off'and heads to the side of the house, still carrying\n          his book.\n\n          SIDE OF THE HOUSE:\n          He ducks through a broken chain-link fence and moves down\n          the side of the house...\n          .until he finds a familiar wooden BOARD. Familiar\n          because we've seen this place before: it's where he\n          lived when he was a foster kid.\n          He removes the board, then reaches into the hole. His\n          hand seizes on something. From the hole, he withdraws a\n          KEY attached to a note with an address on it: 1850 North\n          Highbury St.\n          Wesley's eyes move from the copy of MONTE CRISTO, to the\n          key, and back to the book.\n          Finally, he lowers his hands... revealing a little eight-\n          year-old kid, watching him curiously from the back yard.\n\n          WESLEY\n          Hey.\n\n          KID\n          Hey.\n\n          WESLEY\n          You live here?\n          The kid.nods .\n\n           WESLEY (CONT'D)\n           Foster home?\n          4014 The kid nods again.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          81.\n\n          WESLEY (CONT'D)\n          Read this.\n          He tosses the kid the book and heads off.\n\n          EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY\n\n          He pulls the Harley over to a curb and then reaches into\n          his jacket pocket and withdraws the note and the key.\n          Across the street, the address matches: 1850 N.\n          Highbury.

If she's wounded, we\n          wouldn't know it.\n          Wesley does the same on a nearby table.

With another kick, she\n          sends the hot table flying at him. It rips free from its\n          wiring, and the nozzle sprays gas out into the\n          restaurant... SSSSSSSSS...\n          Wesley knocks the flying table out of the way, but not\n          before it burns his arm as he blocks it.\n          Spotting his guns, he sprints for them as Fox unleashes a\n          hailstorm of bullets.\n          But he's too damn fast, and he dives across the floor\n          Pete Rose style, sliding to a stop at the precise moment\n          where his hands come u holSling his weapons.\n          In.one fluid motion, he flips back over and EAM!

HOSPITAL BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - DAY\n\n          Wesley bursts from the stairwell doorway and moves to the\n          front door of the building. He clicks the empty\n          cartridges out of his guns and is about to reload when he\n          hears a sickening sound behind him...\n          The sound of two knife blades being rubbed together...\n          .and Wesley turns to f' the Butcher there waiting for\n          The Butcher quickly hurls a knife, which buries in_the\n          fleshy part of Wesley's shoulder 1\n           Wesley ignores it and fires...\n          i L\n\n          SAM BAM!

To make\n          things worse, directly across the street from Wesley is\n          the Pharmacist, and each has a gun on him.\n\n          THE PHARMACIST\n          Three on one, mate. You're out of ammo.\n          And you're in a part of the map with no\n          Fraternity stashes.\n\n          (LAUGHS)\n          That's what I'd call a real ball ache.\n          For a moment, Wesley stands there, sizing up the\n          situation. His eyes swivel from the Gardener to the Chef\n          to the Pharmacist.\n          Just then, the buildings ound all of them go black.,\n          just like in cross's model! Wesley's eyes fall on the on\n          the red corner of the nearest building, a cement block\n          making up a decorative support column in front of it.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          104.\n          Wesley smiles.\n\n          WESLEY\n          I'm working off of a different map.\n          With that, the world goes back 12 its natural colorB, and\n          he races for the building, jumping up onto and over a\n          Lexus parked at the curb. The three assassins fire\n          relentlessly at him, but their bullets slam into the car,\n          smashing it to bits... as...\n          . on the other side of it, Wesley goes into a slide just\n          as he reaches that cement block... affixed to it is a\n          small SILVER CROSSI Wesley slaps his hand on the Cross\n          and the cement block mechanically opens, revealing: a new\n          pair of sophisticated MA ISHIS I\n          As his adversaries converge on him, Wesley takes the\n          guns, spins, splits both hands apart and we...\n\n          SPLITSCREEN:\n          ...to follow both of his bullets in flight.\n\n          ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN:\n          .THE BULLET from the left gun heads for the Chef. He\n          tries to drop down, but the bullet curves downward, it\n          pierces his body... and...\n\n          INSIDE HIS BODY:\n          We see the bullet ricochet off of one of his ribs-exit\n          his side and head for the Pharmacist, while...\n\n          ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN:\n          ...the bullet from the right gun heads for the Gardener,\n          who moves fast to fire his own gun, but the bullet\n          catches him in the wrist, knocking his gun out of his\n          hand, and...\n\n          INSIDE THE WRIST:\n          . it hits the Gardener's scaphoid bone, ricocheting out,\n          also, right at the Pharmacist...\n\n          THE SCREEN RETURNS TO NORMAL:\n          .just as the two bullets come together...\n\n          THE PHARMACIST\n          Bugger.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          105.\n          hitting the Pharmacist on both sides of-his head,\n          before he can even react.\n          Wesley watches a pink spray shoot out from both sides of\n          the Pharmacist's head as he falls to the asphalt, dead.\n          But Wesley's not through, he moves over to the Gardener\n          and rolls him over.\n\n          WESLEY\n          Where is he?\n\n          THE GARDENER\n          Where it started..\n          BAN! Wesley ends it for the Gardener.\n\n          EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY\n\n          We've seen this place before. It's the same roof where\n          cross took out the second head of\n          The door is kicked open and Wesley walks out, eyes\n          blazing.\n          Sloan is waiting for standing t feet away,\n          holding his father's pearl-handled gun, trained right on\n          Wesley's head.\n\n          SLOAN\n          Can't say I don't have a sense of irony.\n          The place I first decided to bring you\n          in.\n          Wesley is clutching his wounded shoulder with his wounded\n          hand as blood starts to seep out of it in big red drops.\n\n          SLOAN (CONT'D)\n          You once asked why I helped hide you as\n          an infant... It gave me power, Wesley'.\n          Power to become a head of the Fraternity.\n          Power over your father. And ultimately\n          it gave me you: the perfect weapon to\n          kill your father.\n\n          WESLEY\n          But now you have to dispose of the\n          weapon.\n\n          SLOAN\n          In some ways it pains me to do so. You\n          460 are like the son I never had.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          106.\n\n          WESLEY\n          Fuck you.\n          Sloan's eyes narrow.\n\n          SLOAN\n          Fine. Keep your worthless dignity.\n          You're still just the same loser we\n          plucked off the street six weeks ago.\n          Wesley continues to bleed, taking this in. Sloan laughs\n          derisively.\n\n          SLOAN (CONT'D)\n          You can't win, Wesley. The Fraternity is\n          everywhere. Even if you kill me others\n          will come from other cities to take my\n          place. You'll be hunted your whole life.\n\n          (BEAT)\n          But that's not gonna happen. Like I told\n          you before, when we are called, death is\n          as certain as the sun.\n          Wesley stands as straight as he can muster. The two men\n          face each other like two gunmen on Main Street in Dodge\n          city... an old newspaper even blows through like a\n          tumbleweed.\n          And we are close on Wesley's face. act it i the\n          same shot from the opening of the movie.\n\n          WESLEY\n          Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and\n          pathetic.\n          We see now that his healthy hand is inching away from his\n          bleeding arm, reaching into his sleeve...\n\n          WESLEY (CONT'D)\n          But not today.\n          With that, he nulls out the matching pearl-handled gun,\n          the twin-brother of the one Sloan is holding, and they\n          both open fire...\n          .Wesley shoots Sloan's bullets out of the air and Sloan\n          does the same. Just like he did with h' father.\n          .But Sloan is good, and one of the bullets finds it's\n          mark, hitting Wesley sSMarely in the same arm that took\n          the knife.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          107.\n\n          WESLEY (CONT'D\n          Uhhh!\n          He can't raise his arm, it's useless, but he's come too\n          damn far to stop now... he flips his gun from his good\n          hand to his bad hand and manages to keep FIRING!\n          Then Wesley does something unexpected... he starts\n          sprinting straight at Sloan, still knocking his bullets\n          out of the air...\n          He closes the gap... ten feet... five feet...\n          ..a surprised and worried expression now spreads on\n          Sloan's face,.like what is this kid doing?\n          But Wesley is not stopping, he shoots the gun out of\n          Sloan's hand and then closes on him, tackling him off his\n          feet!\n          They go flying right over the edge of the building.\n          Wesley's able to grab on to a railing cable and stop\n          himself...\n          ..but Sloan is going to go over.\n          At the last moment, Sloan reacher. for-something.\n          anything. and grabs one-handed the barrel of\n          Wesley's gun...\n          For a moment, they dangle there in this precarious\n          position, looking each other in the face. Sloan can't\n          believe he's been bested by this kid.\n\n          SLOAN\n\n          (SNARLS)\n          Go ahead and shoot me, killer. Just like\n          you did your old man.\n          Wesley's finger starts to squeeze the trigger, but then\n          he smiles...\n\n          WESLEY\n          I'm done with this life. Just like my\n          father.\n          And with that, Wes1gy drops the n out of his h\n\n          FROM TWO HUNDRED FEET BELOW:\n          We watch Sloan's body fall through the sky...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          108.\n          ..down, down, down...\n          .until it SMASHES into the sidewalk, splattering like a\n          grapefruit.\n\n          ON THE ROOFTOP:\n          Wesley rolls over on to his back, looking up at the\n          darkening sky.\n\n          WESLEY (V.O.)\n          It's true. Six weeks ago I was ordinary\n          and-pathetic. Just like you.\n          He sits up, moving OUT OF FRAME.\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n          EXT.

It holds tight on the picture.\n\n          WESLEY (V.0.)\n          I've learned that all of us are unique,\n          even though sometimes we're too fucking\n          blind to see it.\n\n          EXT.

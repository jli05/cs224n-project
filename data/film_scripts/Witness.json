On the SOUND \n               TRACK, the haunting SOUNDS OF A GREGORIAN FUNERAL CHANT. The \n               CAMERA PANS UP to the faces of older brothers and sisters, \n               then to parents and grandparents. These are not familiar \n               faces, but faces from another age, strong and open. All are \n               dressed in the distinctive clothing of the Amish.\n\n               EXT.

The many buggies are aligned in the b.g.\n\n               As the pallbearers begin to shovel soil and gravel into the \n               grave, the Preacher begins to read a hymn in German... a \n               slow atonal litany which seems to hang forever on the frosty \n               air.\n\n               RACHEL\n\n               TIGHTENING to her as the hymn continues...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

Not exactly \n               what old Jacob Ammann had in mind, maybe, but a well set-up \n               man nonetheless, and at ease among men. He's among a group \n               of men including old STOLTZFUS, the local healer, FISHER, \n               BIEILER and Bieiler's stout young son, Tom.\n\n                                     STOLTZFUS\n                         Lapp was a good farmer.

Samuel stops \n               before one of the urinals \u0096 a long, trough-like affair with \n               water drizzling down the rear porcelain panel.\n\n               It's set a little high for Samuel, and it is making GLUGGING \n               FLUSHING NOISES that are, at least, intimidating. Samuel \n               stares for a moment, then turns, looks toward the stalls, \n               stoops to see which are empty.\n\n               HIS POV \u0096 TOILETS\n\n               Beneath the row of doors we can see no feet visible.

He enters. As he does so, a heavily \n               bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters. With some urgency, \n               he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind \n               a paper towel dispenser. Suddenly he glances up.\n\n               Two other men have entered the men's room; one is a large \n               BLACK MAN in a three-piece suit under an expensive, overcoat. \n               His PARTNER is a Caucasian in designer jeans, half boots and \n               a short leather jacket.\n\n               They advance on the young man with unmistakable menace.\n\n               The young man whirls in terror; his two assailants lunge for \n               him... a savage, wordless struggle ensues in the close \n               confines of the lavatory.\n\n               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL\n\n               As the struggling men bounce off the door of his stall... he \n               can see their feet under the edge of the door.\n\n               BACK TO FIGHT\n\n               As the struggle builds to a climax... ends with the young \n               man stiffening with a grunt, his face draining of color.\n\n               The two attackers step away, the blade in the black man's \n               hand bloodstained.

Finally his \n               bloodied hand reaches to smear at his face in the mirror. \n               Then he collapses to the floor.\n\n               The black man motions for his partner to watch the door, \n               then quickly reaches up and removes the notebook from behind \n               the dispenser.\n\n               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL\n\n               As he edges open the stall door a crack. Over his shoulder \n               we can see the black man, his BACK TO US, rifling the \n               backpack.

At the last minute he finally wedges it in.\n\n               BLACK MAN\n\n               He elbows Samuel's stall... the door won't open.\n\n               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL\n\n               Fighting back panic, Samuel has retreated as far as he can.\n\n               BLACK MAN\n\n               As he gives the door a kick.

But he loses his hat in the \n               process. His hand snakes back INTO FRAME to snatch it just \n               as the black man gives the door a ferocious kick that \n               splinters the lock and nearly takes it off its hinges. He's \n               framed there, the big muzzle of the .38 revolver looking \n               down our throats.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               As his partner snaps from the doorway:\n\n                                     PARTNER\n                         Will you come on, for Christ's sakes!\n\n               A beat, then the black man holsters his weapon, turns to \n               follow the partner out.\n\n               BACK TO SAMUEL\n\n               As we hear the SOUND OF THE TWO MEN EXITING the lavatory.

Book, checking out the \n               battery power, hits the radio \u0096 and suddenly from the \n               Twentieth Century comes the sound of one of its major \n               inventions \u0096 rock and roll.\n\n               It fills the barn, but Book turns up the volume a click more \n               even and, eyeing Rachel, starts moving with the beat. It's \n               his culture, coming through loud and clear, as incongruous \n               as it all might seem with the tough Philly cop decked out in \n               Amish.\n\n               Rachel can't help but laugh...

She looks on, amused.\n\n               Hochstetler gives Rachel a look, and we realize that his \n               showing up just now to appropriate Book was no happenstance.\n\n               And Book realizes it as well.\n\n                                     HOCHSTETLER\n                         Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.\n\n                                     BOOK\n                         It's been a while.\n\n                                     HOCHSTETLER\n                         No matter.

There's an unmistakable atmosphere of \n               competition between the two men, which doesn't go entirely \n               unnoticed by the half-dozen or so other young men on the \n               gang.\n\n               ...or, indeed, by Rachel; in fact, she seems \u0096 without leaning \n               on it too heavily \u0096 to be measuring the two men as the morning \n               progresses, and she occasionally passes within proximity of \n               them.\n\n               ...Eli and a couple of other elders prowling the job with \n               sheaves of hand-drawn sketches under their arms, supervising \n               the construction. All around them the structure is rising \n               with remarkable rapidity.\n\n               ...Rachel, where she's helping the women set out the huge \n               noon meal. Other women are sitting on benches in the b.g., \n               knitting or doing quiltwork.\n\n               ...Samuel, where he's banging away with a hammer, with a \n               group of boys his own age. Elsewhere we see little girls \n               \"botching\" (a hand-clapping game played to German rhymes).\n\n               ...The very elderly; sitting on the grass or in wheelchairs \n               in the sunlight, looking on \u0096 the old men kibitzing in German, \n               the women gossiping.\n\n               Until...\n\n               BIG SHOT\n\n               Of the barn-raising with the noon sun high overhead... at \n               least a hundred and fifty men are swarming over and about \n               the barn framework...\n\n               ...some aid the rafters, some hauling lumber to the job, \n               others sawing, hammering, drilling, joining, planing and \n               what-all... so many that the barn seems almost to be rearing \n               up before our very eyes.

They \n               are, therefore, crotch to the mast and facing one another, \n               way out at the far end of the roof.\n\n               Suddenly, as Hochstetler raises his hammer, the studs start \n               to part, threatening to de-ball the both of them.\n\n               Hochstetler drops his hammer, grabs both sides of the roof \n               with incredible brute strength, and, literally, pulls it \n               back together.\n\n               Book stares at Hochstetler with nothing short of awe.\n\n               Hochstetler, straining and grinning, looks to Book:\n\n                                     HOCHSTETLER\n                         Nail it!\n\n                                     BOOK\n                         Yes, sir.\n\n               And he does nail it while Hochstetler, grinning and holding, \n               looks on.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               BIG SHOT\n\n               The barn is done, the workmen climbing down from the rafters. \n               It's late afternoon.\n\n               ANGLE ON BOOK\n\n               He hesitates. His face is pale and covered with sweat. The \n               exertion of the day has taken its toll. He's in danger of \n               fainting and is some forty feet above the ground. But he's \n               determined it won't happen, determined that he won't fall, \n               nor will he humiliate himself by calling for help. Hochstetler \n               guesses the situation. He moves beside Book, claps an arm \n               about him, says nothing, doesn't even look at Book. From \n               below, someone TELLS them to hurry up.\n\n               Hochstetler shouts:\n\n                                     HOCHSTETLER\n                         We admire our work!\n\n               The moment passes for Book, and he's okay. Hochstetler removes \n               his supporting arm. Book looks him in the eye, nods his \n               appreciation almost imperceptibly. Hochstetler wants no \n               thanks, and Book knows it. Hochstetler gives him a resounding \n               SLAP on the back, and starts climbing down. Book follows.\n\n               EXT.

Book \n               shakes Hochstetler off him, straightens his hat, and in a \n               kind of daze, begins walking past the scene in the direction \n               of the Lapp farm.\n\n               The youths are picking up their wounded, helping them back \n               to their truck, aided by none other than Hochstetler.

Then, deliberately, Book makes a fist, \n               raps on the board smartly once.\n\n               MCELROY\n\n               Startled, REACTING. He sets his feet, leans back against the \n               back wall of the ladder well, brings the shotgun up, puts \n               the muzzle against the kickboard, clicks off the safety.\n\n               BOOK\n\n               We HEAR with him the thump of the muzzle, the CLICK... and, \n               with marvelous speed, Book pulls the kickboard and drops it \n               to the floor.\n\n               McELROY \u0096 FLASH CUT Staring in, stun-eyed, already falling \n               forward (having leaned his weight on the shotgun) as Book \n               seizes the shotgun by the barrel, pulls inward.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               As McElroy pitches forward through the opening, SCREAMS and \n               GRABS as he plunges past Book. The shotgun FIRES as McElroy \n               manages to hold onto Book, and both men plunge thirty feet \n               to the bottom of the silo.\n\n               BOOK\n\n               He falls almost straight down, lands on his back, lies \n               stunned.\n\n               MCELROY\n\n               His forward motion has carried him across the silo. His head \n               bounds off the white brick wall about five feet up... and he \n               falls in a heap, blood gushing from his head, as...\n\n               TIGHT ON BOOK\n\n               Blinking, groaning, just beginning to stir... and, suddenly, \n               into the frame comes a hand with a pistol in it. The muzzle \n               is placed firmly against Book's temple.\n\n               WIDER\n\n               Schaeffer holding the pistol. He cocks the pistol, tenses as \n               if to FIRE (and he is actually about to)... when there is a \n               SOUND behind him. He snaps around.\n\n               WHAT HE SEES\n\n               Old Stoltzfus and Samuel standing in the kickboard opening \n               (Schaeffer having kicked the kickboard in when he heard the \n               shot from within the silo). They stand solemnly, looking on \n               as:\n\n               SCHAEFFER\n\n               He eases the hammer down on this pistol, speaks softly:\n\n                                     SCHAEFFER\n                         Okay, Johnny. On your feet.\n\n               THE SCENE\n\n               As Book struggles to his feet \u0096 Schaeffer holding the pistol \n               tight to Book's head. Book turns, sees Samuel and Stoltzfus, \n               blinks.\n\n               Schaeffer shoves Book toward the opening. As Book moves toward \n               Samuel, he speaks quietly:\n\n                                     BOOK\n                         It's okay, Sam.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               As Book and McElroy move out of the silo, down the passageway \n               toward the milkhouse, Stoltzfus and Sam (after a glance in \n               at the inert McElroy) follow and...\n\n               EXT. BARN \u0096 DAY\n\n               As first Stoltzfus and Samuel, then Book and Schaeffer emerge \n               into the barnyard. Schaeffer has the muzzle of his pistol \n               pressed firmly against Book's throat, just below his jaw.\n\n               Schaeffer pulls up, frowning:\n\n                                     SCHAEFFER\n                         Hold it.\n\n               WHAT HE SEES\n\n               The Amishmen gathered \u0096 the Stoltzfus family, the Hochstetler \n               brothers, et al.

BARN / DRIVE \u0096 DAY\n\n               From a high wide angle the final scene is played out. \n               Schaeffer and Book, now moving again slowly up the drive, \n               the Amish following along closely on both sides.\n\n               CLOSE ON BOOK\n\n               As Schaeffer prods Book forward, warily eyeing the Amish.\n\n                                     SCHAEFFER\n                         Get back, you people!\n                              (prodding)\n                         Keep moving, Johnny...\n\n               Book takes a couple of steps further, then abruptly stops. \n               The Amish stand about close, staring, no one moving. Book \n               now slowly turns his head, looks at Schaeffer.\n\n                                     BOOK\n                         You're going to have to do it right \n                         here, Schaeffer.\n\n                                     SCHAEFFER\n                         Don't try me, Johnny!\n\n               Eli steps forward, bloody cloth held to his head.\n\n                                     ELI\n                         So... will you kill us all, then?\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               As Schaeffer's eyes waver between Book and Eli, Book slowly \n               turns until he is facing Schaeffer... the gun now leveled \u0096 \n               and almost pressing against \u0096 Book's chest. Book locks eyes \n               with Schaeffer.\n\n               Quietly:\n\n                                     BOOK\n                         It's all over, Paul.\n\n                                     SCHAEFFER\n                         Move!

Schaeffer staggers against Hochstetler, who \u0096 partly \n               to keep him from falling, and partly (it appears) to \n               congratulate him on his surrender \u0096 wraps one brawny arm \n               around Schaeffer's shoulders, gives him a short approving \n               nod... holds Schaeffer as:\n\n               BOOK\n\n               Turning, looking into the crowd, finding Rachel.

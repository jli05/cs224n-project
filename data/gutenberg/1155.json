{"summary": "In the Prologue, a man aboard the RMS Lusitania on 7 May 1915 quietly gives important papers to a young American woman, as she is more likely to survive the sinking ship.\nIn 1919 London, demobilised soldier Tommy Beresford meets war volunteer Prudence \"Tuppence\" Cowley, both out of work and money. They form the \"The Young Adventurers, Ltd\", planning to hire themselves out with \"[n]o unreasonable offer refused.\" They are overheard by Mr Whittington who follows Tuppence to offer her a position. He is shocked when she gives her name as \"Jane Finn\". Whittington sends her away with some money, then disappears without a trace. They advertise for information regarding Jane Finn.\nThe advertisement yields two immediate replies. They first meet with Mr Carter, whom Tommy recognises as a leader in British intelligence from his war service. Mr Carter tells of Jane Finn aboard the RMS Lusitania when it sank in 1915. She received a secret treaty to deliver to the American embassy in London. She survived, but the government has found neither Jane Finn nor the draft treaty since. Publication of the treaty now would compromise the British government. Tommy and Tuppence agree to work for Carter. He warns them of the elusive and merciless figure known as Mr Brown. Next they meet with Julius Hersheimmer, an American multimillionaire who is the first cousin of Jane Finn, staying at the Ritz Hotel. He is intent on finding her. He has already contacted Scotland Yard; an Inspector named Brown took his only photo of Jane, before a real inspector contacted him. Tommy and Tuppence join forces with Julius.\nWhittington mentions the name Rita to Tuppence. Tommy and Tuppence find her among the surviving passengers of the Lusitania, Mrs Marguerite Vandemeyer. Whittington and Boris Ivanovitch leave Rita's flat before Tommy and Tuppence have left the building. Tommy follows them, phoning Julius to aid him. Tommy follows Boris through London to a house in Soho, while Julius trails Whittington on the train to Bournemouth. Boris leads Tommy into a meeting of Bolshevist conspirators, where he is caught. Claiming he has knowledge regarding the missing treaty, he delays his execution. Tuppence secures the co-operation of Albert, the lift boy at Mrs Vandemeyer's residence, and obtains a job as Rita's maid. Tuppence hears Rita mention Mr Brown. The next visitor is Sir James Peel Edgerton, K.C.. On her afternoon off, Tuppence meets Julius at the Ritz. Julius had followed Whittington to a private nursing home, where Whittington met with a nurse. Before Julius could act, both Whittington and the nurse left. Tommy has not returned. Tuppence keeps Mr Carter informed. Tuppence persuades Julius to seek advice from Sir James. Tuppence returns early to the flat, where she interrupts her mistress's preparations to flee. After a tussle, Tuppence gains control of the gun, and Rita, who admits she knows who Mr Brown is. Upon the arrival of Julius and Sir James, Mrs Vandemeyer screams, collapses, and dies that night from poisoning. Before her death, she murmurs \"Mr Brown\" in Tuppence's ear.\nThe three contact the head of the private clinic, Dr Hall, to find Mr Whittington. Jane Finn had been admitted to Hall's nursing home under the name Janet Vandemeyer, because she suffered a complete loss of memory after the sinking of the Lusitania, but she left his nursing home. Sir James sows distrust among the young adventurers. Tuppence rushes out upon receiving a telegram signed by Tommy.\nTommy is imprisoned in the conspirators' house in Soho, where the young French woman Annette serves his meals. The conspirators tie Tommy up to be taken away and killed. Annette arranges his escape, but she refuses to leave the house. Tommy returns to the Ritz, where he and Julius recognise the telegram to Tuppence as a ruse. They retrieve the telegram, but fail to find her at the address given. Sir James discovers Jane Finn, who has recovered her memory after an accident. She tells them where she hid the treaty. At the hiding place, they find no treaty, but a message from Mr Brown. Tommy goes to London to alert Mr Carter. There, Tommy learns it is feared Tuppence is drowned. Tommy returns to the Ritz. He and Julius argue, which Julius resolves by leaving the hotel. While searching for writing paper in Julius's drawer, Tommy finds a photograph of Annette. This chance find is a new clue. Tommy concludes that the Jane Finn they met was planted by their enemies, to stop their investigation. He receives a telegram falsely signed by Tuppence (with her name misspelled). He figures out who sent it; the identity of Mr Brown; and now proceeds on a plan to prove the truth of his solution. Tommy gets an original copy of the telegram sent to Tuppence, and sees that her destination was altered on the copy he read. With Albert, he proceeds to the correct destination house. He leaves a false note for Julius, indicating that he left for Argentina.\nJulius kidnaps Mr Kramenin, one of the conspirators. Under duress, Kramenin gets Tuppence and Annette released, whereupon all of them drive off in Julius's car. Tommy is at the same house, where he jumps on the back of the car. It becomes clear that Annette is Jane Finn. In a surprise move, Tommy snatches Julius's weapon, and sends Tuppence and Jane by train to Sir James in London, while he and Julius proceed in the car. The women reach Sir James's residence. Here, Jane tells her story: after receiving the packet on the ship, she became suspicious of Mrs Vandemeyer. She placed blank sheets in the original packet, carrying the treaty sealed inside magazine pages. During the trip away from Ireland, she was mugged and taken to the house in Soho. Perceiving the intent of her captors, Jane decided to pretend amnesia and conversed only in French. During the night, she hid the treaty in the back of a picture in her room. She maintained her new role all these years, despite the threats and tension. Tuppence is suspicious that Julius is Mr Brown, which alarms Jane. Sir James agrees, adding that someone has killed the real Julius in America, and that man killed Mrs. Vandemeyer. They rush to Soho. They recover the treaty at the house. Sir James identifies himself to the two women as the true Mr Brown, and announces his plan to kill them, wound himself, and then blame it on the elusive Mr Brown. Julius and Tommy, who are hiding in the room, overwhelm Sir James / Mr Brown, who commits suicide from poison in a ring he wore. Tommy understood that Mr Carter would not believe Sir James was guilty unless he witnessed it himself, the two having long been friends.\nJulius gives a party in honor of Jane. All those concerned in the case meet, including Tuppence's father, the archdeacon and Tommy's rich uncle, who makes him his heir. The novel ends with two proposals of marriage accepted: Julius and Jane, and Tommy and Tuppence.\n\n", "full_text": "THE SECRET ADVERSARY\n\nBy Agatha Christie\n\n\n               TO ALL THOSE WHO LEAD\n               MONOTONOUS LIVES\n               IN THE HOPE THAT THEY MAY EXPERIENCE\n               AT SECOND HAND\n               THE DELIGHTS AND DANGERS OF\n               ADVENTURE\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n     Prologue\n     I      The Young Adventurers, Ltd.\n     II     Mr. Whittington's Offer\n     III    A Set Back\n     IV     Who Is Jane Finn?\n     V      Mr. Julius P.

The Lusitania had been\nstruck by two torpedoes in succession and was sinking rapidly, while\nthe boats were being launched with all possible speed. The women and\nchildren were being lined up awaiting their turn. Some still clung\ndesperately to husbands and fathers; others clutched their children\nclosely to their breasts. One girl stood alone, slightly apart from\nthe rest. She was quite young, not more than eighteen. She did not seem\nafraid, and her grave, steadfast eyes looked straight ahead.\n\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\n\nA man's voice beside her made her start and turn. She had noticed the\nspeaker more than once amongst the first-class passengers. There had\nbeen a hint of mystery about him which had appealed to her imagination.\nHe spoke to no one. If anyone spoke to him he was quick to rebuff the\noverture. Also he had a nervous way of looking over his shoulder with a\nswift, suspicious glance.\n\nShe noticed now that he was greatly agitated. There were beads of\nperspiration on his brow. He was evidently in a state of overmastering\nfear. And yet he did not strike her as the kind of man who would be\nafraid to meet death!\n\n\"Yes?\" Her grave eyes met his inquiringly.\n\nHe stood looking at her with a kind of desperate irresolution.\n\n\"It must be!\" he muttered to himself. \"Yes--it is the only way.\" Then\naloud he said abruptly: \"You are an American?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"A patriotic one?\"\n\nThe girl flushed.\n\n\"I guess you've no right to ask such a thing! Of course I am!\"\n\n\"Don't be offended. You wouldn't be if you knew how much there was at\nstake. But I've got to trust some one--and it must be a woman.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because of 'women and children first.'\" He looked round and lowered his\nvoice. \"I'm carrying papers--vitally important papers. They may make all\nthe difference to the Allies in the war. You understand? These papers\nhave GOT to be saved! They've more chance with you than with me. Will\nyou take them?\"\n\nThe girl held out her hand.\n\n\"Wait--I must warn you. There may be a risk--if I've been followed. I\ndon't think I have, but one never knows. If so, there will be danger.\nHave you the nerve to go through with it?\"\n\nThe girl smiled.\n\n\"I'll go through with it all right. And I'm real proud to be chosen!\nWhat am I to do with them afterwards?\"\n\n\"Watch the newspapers! I'll advertise in the personal column of the\nTimes, beginning 'Shipmate.' At the end of three days if there's\nnothing--well, you'll know I'm down and out. Then take the packet to\nthe American Embassy, and deliver it into the Ambassador's own hands. Is\nthat clear?\"\n\n\"Quite clear.\"\n\n\"Then be ready--I'm going to say good-bye.\" He took her hand in his.\n\"Good-bye. Good luck to you,\" he said in a louder tone.\n\nHer hand closed on the oilskin packet that had lain in his palm.\n\nThe Lusitania settled with a more decided list to starboard. In answer\nto a quick command, the girl went forward to take her place in the boat.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. THE YOUNG ADVENTURERS, LTD.\n\n\"TOMMY, old thing!\"\n\n\"Tuppence, old bean!\"\n\nThe two young people greeted each other affectionately, and momentarily\nblocked the Dover Street Tube exit in doing so. The adjective \"old\"\nwas misleading. Their united ages would certainly not have totalled\nforty-five.\n\n\"Not seen you for simply centuries,\" continued the young man. \"Where are\nyou off to? Come and chew a bun with me. We're getting a bit unpopular\nhere--blocking the gangway as it were. Let's get out of it.\"\n\nThe girl assenting, they started walking down Dover Street towards\nPiccadilly.\n\n\"Now then,\" said Tommy, \"where shall we go?\"\n\nThe very faint anxiety which underlay his tone did not escape the astute\nears of Miss Prudence Cowley, known to her intimate friends for some\nmysterious reason as \"Tuppence.\" She pounced at once.\n\n\"Tommy, you're stony!\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" declared Tommy unconvincingly. \"Rolling in cash.\"\n\n\"You always were a shocking liar,\" said Tuppence severely, \"though you\ndid once persuade Sister Greenbank that the doctor had ordered you beer\nas a tonic, but forgotten to write it on the chart. Do you remember?\"\n\nTommy chuckled.\n\n\"I should think I did! Wasn't the old cat in a rage when she found\nout? Not that she was a bad sort really, old Mother Greenbank! Good old\nhospital--demobbed like everything else, I suppose?\"\n\nTuppence sighed.\n\n\"Yes. You too?\"\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n\"Two months ago.\"\n\n\"Gratuity?\" hinted Tuppence.\n\n\"Spent.\"\n\n\"Oh, Tommy!\"\n\n\"No, old thing, not in riotous dissipation. No such luck! The cost of\nliving--ordinary plain, or garden living nowadays is, I assure you, if\nyou do not know----\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" interrupted Tuppence, \"there is nothing I do NOT know\nabout the cost of living. Here we are at Lyons', and we will each of us\npay for our own. That's it!\" And Tuppence led the way upstairs.\n\nThe place was full, and they wandered about looking for a table,\ncatching odds and ends of conversation as they did so.\n\n\"And--do you know, she sat down and CRIED when I told her she couldn't\nhave the flat after all.\" \"It was simply a BARGAIN, my dear! Just like\nthe one Mabel Lewis brought from Paris----\"\n\n\"Funny scraps one does overhear,\" murmured Tommy. \"I passed two Johnnies\nin the street to-day talking about some one called Jane Finn. Did you\never hear such a name?\"\n\nBut at that moment two elderly ladies rose and collected parcels, and\nTuppence deftly ensconced herself in one of the vacant seats.\n\nTommy ordered tea and buns. Tuppence ordered tea and buttered toast.\n\n\"And mind the tea comes in separate teapots,\" she added severely.\n\nTommy sat down opposite her. His bared head revealed a shock\nof exquisitely slicked-back red hair. His face was pleasantly\nugly--nondescript, yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a\nsportsman. His brown suit was well cut, but perilously near the end of\nits tether.\n\nThey were an essentially modern-looking couple as they sat there.\nTuppence had no claim to beauty, but there was character and charm in\nthe elfin lines of her little face, with its determined chin and large,\nwide-apart grey eyes that looked mistily out from under straight, black\nbrows. She wore a small bright green toque over her black bobbed hair,\nand her extremely short and rather shabby skirt revealed a pair of\nuncommonly dainty ankles. Her appearance presented a valiant attempt at\nsmartness.\n\nThe tea came at last, and Tuppence, rousing herself from a fit of\nmeditation, poured it out.\n\n\"Now then,\" said Tommy, taking a large bite of bun, \"let's get\nup-to-date. Remember, I haven't seen you since that time in hospital in\n1916.\"\n\n\"Very well.\" Tuppence helped herself liberally to buttered toast.\n\"Abridged biography of Miss Prudence Cowley, fifth daughter of\nArchdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell, Suffolk. Miss Cowley left the\ndelights (and drudgeries) of her home life early in the war and came up\nto London, where she entered an officers' hospital. First month: Washed\nup six hundred and forty-eight plates every day. Second month: Promoted\nto drying aforesaid plates. Third month: Promoted to peeling potatoes.\nFourth month: Promoted to cutting bread and butter. Fifth month:\nPromoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail. Sixth\nmonth: Promoted to waiting at table. Seventh month: Pleasing appearance\nand nice manners so striking that am promoted to waiting on the Sisters!\nEighth month: Slight check in career. Sister Bond ate Sister Westhaven's\negg! Grand row! Wardmaid clearly to blame! Inattention in such important\nmatters cannot be too highly censured. Mop and pail again! How are the\nmighty fallen! Ninth month: Promoted to sweeping out wards, where I\nfound a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford (bow,\nTommy!), whom I had not seen for five long years. The meeting was\naffecting! Tenth month: Reproved by matron for visiting the pictures in\ncompany with one of the patients, namely: the aforementioned Lieutenant\nThomas Beresford. Eleventh and twelfth months: Parlourmaid duties\nresumed with entire success. At the end of the year left hospital in a\nblaze of glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drove successively\na trade delivery van, a motor-lorry and a general! The last was the\npleasantest. He was quite a young general!\"\n\n\"What blighter was that?\" inquired Tommy. \"Perfectly sickening the way\nthose brass hats drove from the War Office to the Savoy, and from the\nSavoy to the War Office!\"\n\n\"I've forgotten his name now,\" confessed Tuppence. \"To resume, that was\nin a way the apex of my career. I next entered a Government office. We\nhad several very enjoyable tea parties. I had intended to become a\nland girl, a postwoman, and a bus conductress by way of rounding off\nmy career--but the Armistice intervened! I clung to the office with the\ntrue limpet touch for many long months, but, alas, I was combed out at\nlast. Since then I've been looking for a job. Now then--your turn.\"\n\n\"There's not so much promotion in mine,\" said Tommy regretfully, \"and a\ngreat deal less variety. I went out to France again, as you know. Then\nthey sent me to Mesopotamia, and I got wounded for the second time,\nand went into hospital out there. Then I got stuck in Egypt till the\nArmistice happened, kicked my heels there some time longer, and, as I\ntold you, finally got demobbed. And, for ten long, weary months I've\nbeen job hunting! There aren't any jobs! And, if there were, they\nwouldn't give 'em to me. What good am I? What do I know about business?\nNothing.\"\n\nTuppence nodded gloomily.\n\n\"What about the colonies?\" she suggested.\n\nTommy shook his head.\n\n\"I shouldn't like the colonies--and I'm perfectly certain they wouldn't\nlike me!\"\n\n\"Rich relations?\"\n\nAgain Tommy shook his head.\n\n\"Oh, Tommy, not even a great-aunt?\"\n\n\"I've got an old uncle who's more or less rolling, but he's no good.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Wanted to adopt me once. I refused.\"\n\n\"I think I remember hearing about it,\" said Tuppence slowly. \"You\nrefused because of your mother----\"\n\nTommy flushed.\n\n\"Yes, it would have been a bit rough on the mater. As you know, I was\nall she had. Old boy hated her--wanted to get me away from her. Just a\nbit of spite.\"\n\n\"Your mother's dead, isn't she?\" said Tuppence gently.\n\nTommy nodded.\n\nTuppence's large grey eyes looked misty.\n\n\"You're a good sort, Tommy. I always knew it.\"\n\n\"Rot!\" said Tommy hastily. \"Well, that's my position. I'm just about\ndesperate.\"\n\n\"So am I! I've hung out as long as I could. I've touted round. I've\nanswered advertisements. I've tried every mortal blessed thing. I've\nscrewed and saved and pinched! But it's no good. I shall have to go\nhome!\"\n\n\"Don't you want to?\"\n\n\"Of course I don't want to! What's the good of being sentimental?\nFather's a dear--I'm awfully fond of him--but you've no idea how I worry\nhim! He has that delightful early Victorian view that short skirts and\nsmoking are immoral. You can imagine what a thorn in the flesh I am to\nhim! He just heaved a sigh of relief when the war took me off. You see,\nthere are seven of us at home. It's awful! All housework and mothers'\nmeetings! I have always been the changeling. I don't want to go back,\nbut--oh, Tommy, what else is there to do?\"\n\nTommy shook his head sadly. There was a silence, and then Tuppence burst\nout:\n\n\"Money, money, money! I think about money morning, noon and night! I\ndare say it's mercenary of me, but there it is!\"\n\n\"Same here,\" agreed Tommy with feeling.\n\n\"I've thought over every imaginable way of getting it too,\" continued\nTuppence. \"There are only three! To be left it, to marry it, or to make\nit. First is ruled out. I haven't got any rich elderly relatives. Any\nrelatives I have are in homes for decayed gentlewomen! I always help old\nladies over crossings, and pick up parcels for old gentlemen, in case\nthey should turn out to be eccentric millionaires. But not one of them\nhas ever asked me my name--and quite a lot never said 'Thank you.'\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"Of course,\" resumed Tuppence, \"marriage is my best chance. I made up my\nmind to marry money when I was quite young. Any thinking girl would!\nI'm not sentimental, you know.\" She paused. \"Come now, you can't say I'm\nsentimental,\" she added sharply.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" agreed Tommy hastily. \"No one would ever think of\nsentiment in connection with you.\"\n\n\"That's not very polite,\" replied Tuppence. \"But I dare say you mean it\nall right. Well, there it is! I'm ready and willing--but I never meet\nany rich men! All the boys I know are about as hard up as I am.\"\n\n\"What about the general?\" inquired Tommy.\n\n\"I fancy he keeps a bicycle shop in time of peace,\" explained Tuppence.\n\"No, there it is! Now you could marry a rich girl.\"\n\n\"I'm like you. I don't know any.\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter. You can always get to know one. Now, if I see a\nman in a fur coat come out of the Ritz I can't rush up to him and say:\n'Look here, you're rich. I'd like to know you.'\"\n\n\"Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garbed female?\"\n\n\"Don't be silly. You tread on her foot, or pick up her handkerchief, or\nsomething like that. If she thinks you want to know her she's flattered,\nand will manage it for you somehow.\"\n\n\"You overrate my manly charms,\" murmured Tommy.\n\n\"On the other hand,\" proceeded Tuppence, \"my millionaire would probably\nrun for his life! No--marriage is fraught with difficulties. Remains--to\nMAKE money!\"\n\n\"We've tried that, and failed,\" Tommy reminded her.\n\n\"We've tried all the orthodox ways, yes. But suppose we try the\nunorthodox. Tommy, let's be adventurers!\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Tommy cheerfully. \"How do we begin?\"\n\n\"That's the difficulty. If we could make ourselves known, people might\nhire us to commit crimes for them.\"\n\n\"Delightful,\" commented Tommy. \"Especially coming from a clergyman's\ndaughter!\"\n\n\"The moral guilt,\" Tuppence pointed out, \"would be theirs--not mine. You\nmust admit that there's a difference between stealing a diamond necklace\nfor yourself and being hired to steal it.\"\n\n\"There wouldn't be the least difference if you were caught!\"\n\n\"Perhaps not. But I shouldn't be caught. I'm so clever.\"\n\n\"Modesty always was your besetting sin,\" remarked Tommy.\n\n\"Don't rag. Look here, Tommy, shall we really? Shall we form a business\npartnership?\"\n\n\"Form a company for the stealing of diamond necklaces?\"\n\n\"That was only an illustration. Let's have a--what do you call it in\nbook-keeping?\"\n\n\"Don't know. Never did any.\"\n\n\"I have--but I always got mixed up, and used to put credit entries on\nthe debit side, and vice versa--so they fired me out. Oh, I know--a\njoint venture! It struck me as such a romantic phrase to come across in\nthe middle of musty old figures. It's got an Elizabethan flavour about\nit--makes one think of galleons and doubloons. A joint venture!\"\n\n\"Trading under the name of the Young Adventurers, Ltd.? Is that your\nidea, Tuppence?\"\n\n\"It's all very well to laugh, but I feel there might be something in\nit.\"\n\n\"How do you propose to get in touch with your would-be employers?\"\n\n\"Advertisement,\" replied Tuppence promptly. \"Have you got a bit of paper\nand a pencil? Men usually seem to have. Just like we have hairpins and\npowder-puffs.\"\n\nTommy handed over a rather shabby green notebook, and Tuppence began\nwriting busily.\n\n\"Shall we begin: 'Young officer, twice wounded in the war--'\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well, my dear boy. But I can assure you that that sort of\nthing might touch the heart of an elderly spinster, and she might adopt\nyou, and then there would be no need for you to be a young adventurer at\nall.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be adopted.\"\n\n\"I forgot you had a prejudice against it. I was only ragging you!\nThe papers are full up to the brim with that type of thing. Now\nlisten--how's this? 'Two young adventurers for hire. Willing to do\nanything, go anywhere. Pay must be good.' (We might as well make\nthat clear from the start.) Then we might add: 'No reasonable offer\nrefused'--like flats and furniture.\"\n\n\"I should think any offer we get in answer to that would be a pretty\nUNreasonable one!\"\n\n\"Tommy! You're a genius! That's ever so much more chic. 'No unreasonable\noffer refused--if pay is good.' How's that?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't mention pay again. It looks rather eager.\"\n\n\"It couldn't look as eager as I feel! But perhaps you are right. Now\nI'll read it straight through. 'Two young adventurers for hire. Willing\nto do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No unreasonable offer\nrefused.' How would that strike you if you read it?\"\n\n\"It would strike me as either being a hoax, or else written by a\nlunatic.\"\n\n\"It's not half so insane as a thing I read this morning beginning\n'Petunia' and signed 'Best Boy.'\" She tore out the leaf and handed it to\nTommy. \"There you are. Times, I think. Reply to Box so-and-so. I expect\nit will be about five shillings. Here's half a crown for my share.\"\n\nTommy was holding the paper thoughtfully. His faced burned a deeper red.\n\n\"Shall we really try it?\" he said at last. \"Shall we, Tuppence? Just for\nthe fun of the thing?\"\n\n\"Tommy, you're a sport! I knew you would be! Let's drink to success.\"\nShe poured some cold dregs of tea into the two cups.\n\n\"Here's to our joint venture, and may it prosper!\"\n\n\"The Young Adventurers, Ltd.!\" responded Tommy.\n\nThey put down the cups and laughed rather uncertainly. Tuppence rose.\n\n\"I must return to my palatial suite at the hostel.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is time I strolled round to the Ritz,\" agreed Tommy with a\ngrin. \"Where shall we meet? And when?\"\n\n\"Twelve o'clock to-morrow. Piccadilly Tube station. Will that suit you?\"\n\n\"My time is my own,\" replied Mr. Beresford magnificently.\n\n\"So long, then.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, old thing.\"\n\nThe two young people went off in opposite directions. Tuppence's hostel\nwas situated in what was charitably called Southern Belgravia. For\nreasons of economy she did not take a bus.\n\nShe was half-way across St. James's Park, when a man's voice behind her\nmade her start.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" it said. \"But may I speak to you for a moment?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. MR. WHITTINGTON'S OFFER\n\nTUPPENCE turned sharply, but the words hovering on the tip of her tongue\nremained unspoken, for the man's appearance and manner did not bear out\nher first and most natural assumption. She hesitated. As if he read her\nthoughts, the man said quickly:\n\n\"I can assure you I mean no disrespect.\"\n\nTuppence believed him. Although she disliked and distrusted him\ninstinctively, she was inclined to acquit him of the particular motive\nwhich she had at first attributed to him. She looked him up and down. He\nwas a big man, clean shaven, with a heavy jowl. His eyes were small and\ncunning, and shifted their glance under her direct gaze.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" she asked.\n\nThe man smiled.\n\n\"I happened to overhear part of your conversation with the young\ngentleman in Lyons'.\"\n\n\"Well--what of it?\"\n\n\"Nothing--except that I think I may be of some use to you.\"\n\nAnother inference forced itself into Tuppence's mind:\n\n\"You followed me here?\"\n\n\"I took that liberty.\"\n\n\"And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?\"\n\nThe man took a card from his pocket and handed it to her with a bow.\n\nTuppence took it and scrutinized it carefully. It bore the inscription,\n\"Mr. Edward Whittington.\" Below the name were the words \"Esthonia\nGlassware Co.,\" and the address of a city office. Mr. Whittington spoke\nagain:\n\n\"If you will call upon me to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock, I will\nlay the details of my proposition before you.\"\n\n\"At eleven o'clock?\" said Tuppence doubtfully.\n\n\"At eleven o'clock.\"\n\nTuppence made up her mind.\n\n\"Very well. I'll be there.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Good evening.\"\n\nHe raised his hat with a flourish, and walked away. Tuppence remained\nfor some minutes gazing after him. Then she gave a curious movement of\nher shoulders, rather as a terrier shakes himself.\n\n\"The adventures have begun,\" she murmured to herself. \"What does he want\nme to do, I wonder? There's something about you, Mr. Whittington, that I\ndon't like at all. But, on the other hand, I'm not the least bit afraid\nof you. And as I've said before, and shall doubtless say again, little\nTuppence can look after herself, thank you!\"\n\nAnd with a short, sharp nod of her head she walked briskly onward. As a\nresult of further meditations, however, she turned aside from the direct\nroute and entered a post office. There she pondered for some moments,\na telegraph form in her hand. The thought of a possible five shillings\nspent unnecessarily spurred her to action, and she decided to risk the\nwaste of ninepence.\n\nDisdaining the spiky pen and thick, black treacle which a beneficent\nGovernment had provided, Tuppence drew out Tommy's pencil which she had\nretained and wrote rapidly: \"Don't put in advertisement. Will explain\nto-morrow.\" She addressed it to Tommy at his club, from which in one\nshort month he would have to resign, unless a kindly fortune permitted\nhim to renew his subscription.\n\n\"It may catch him,\" she murmured. \"Anyway, it's worth trying.\"\n\nAfter handing it over the counter she set out briskly for home, stopping\nat a baker's to buy three penny-worth of new buns.\n\nLater, in her tiny cubicle at the top of the house she munched buns and\nreflected on the future. What was the Esthonia Glassware Co., and what\nearthly need could it have for her services? A pleasurable thrill of\nexcitement made Tuppence tingle. At any rate, the country vicarage had\nretreated into the background again. The morrow held possibilities.\n\nIt was a long time before Tuppence went to sleep that night, and, when\nat length she did, she dreamed that Mr. Whittington had set her to\nwashing up a pile of Esthonia Glassware, which bore an unaccountable\nresemblance to hospital plates!\n\nIt wanted some five minutes to eleven when Tuppence reached the block\nof buildings in which the offices of the Esthonia Glassware Co. were\nsituated. To arrive before the time would look over-eager. So Tuppence\ndecided to walk to the end of the street and back again. She did so. On\nthe stroke of eleven she plunged into the recesses of the building.\nThe Esthonia Glassware Co. was on the top floor. There was a lift, but\nTuppence chose to walk up.\n\nSlightly out of breath, she came to a halt outside the ground glass door\nwith the legend painted across it \"Esthonia Glassware Co.\"\n\nTuppence knocked. In response to a voice from within, she turned the\nhandle and walked into a small rather dirty outer office.\n\nA middle-aged clerk got down from a high stool at a desk near the window\nand came towards her inquiringly.\n\n\"I have an appointment with Mr. Whittington,\" said Tuppence.\n\n\"Will you come this way, please.\" He crossed to a partition door with\n\"Private\" on it, knocked, then opened the door and stood aside to let\nher pass in.\n\nMr. Whittington was seated behind a large desk covered with papers.\nTuppence felt her previous judgment confirmed. There was something wrong\nabout Mr. Whittington. The combination of his sleek prosperity and his\nshifty eye was not attractive.\n\nHe looked up and nodded.\n\n\"So you've turned up all right? That's good. Sit down, will you?\"\n\nTuppence sat down on the chair facing him. She looked particularly small\nand demure this morning. She sat there meekly with downcast eyes whilst\nMr. Whittington sorted and rustled amongst his papers. Finally he pushed\nthem away, and leaned over the desk.\n\n\"Now, my dear young lady, let us come to business.\" His large face\nbroadened into a smile. \"You want work? Well, I have work to offer\nyou. What should you say now to L100 down, and all expenses paid?\" Mr.\nWhittington leaned back in his chair, and thrust his thumbs into the\narm-holes of his waistcoat.\n\nTuppence eyed him warily.\n\n\"And the nature of the work?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Nominal--purely nominal. A pleasant trip, that is all.\"\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\nMr. Whittington smiled again.\n\n\"Paris.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. To herself she said: \"Of course,\nif father heard that he would have a fit! But somehow I don't see Mr.\nWhittington in the role of the gay deceiver.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Whittington. \"What could be more delightful? To put the\nclock back a few years--a very few, I am sure--and re-enter one of those\ncharming pensionnats de jeunes filles with which Paris abounds----\"\n\nTuppence interrupted him.\n\n\"A pensionnat?\"\n\n\"Exactly. Madame Colombier's in the Avenue de Neuilly.\"\n\nTuppence knew the name well. Nothing could have been more select. She\nhad had several American friends there. She was more than ever puzzled.\n\n\"You want me to go to Madame Colombier's? For how long?\"\n\n\"That depends. Possibly three months.\"\n\n\"And that is all? There are no other conditions?\"\n\n\"None whatever. You would, of course, go in the character of my ward,\nand you would hold no communication with your friends. I should have\nto request absolute secrecy for the time being. By the way, you are\nEnglish, are you not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Yet you speak with a slight American accent?\"\n\n\"My great pal in hospital was a little American girl. I dare say I\npicked it up from her. I can soon get out of it again.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it might be simpler for you to pass as an American.\nDetails about your past life in England might be more difficult to\nsustain. Yes, I think that would be decidedly better. Then----\"\n\n\"One moment, Mr. Whittington! You seem to be taking my consent for\ngranted.\"\n\nWhittington looked surprised.\n\n\"Surely you are not thinking of refusing? I can assure you that Madame\nColombier's is a most high-class and orthodox establishment. And the\nterms are most liberal.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Tuppence. \"That's just it. The terms are almost too\nliberal, Mr. Whittington. I cannot see any way in which I can be worth\nthat amount of money to you.\"\n\n\"No?\" said Whittington softly. \"Well, I will tell you. I could doubtless\nobtain some one else for very much less. What I am willing to pay for\nis a young lady with sufficient intelligence and presence of mind to\nsustain her part well, and also one who will have sufficient discretion\nnot to ask too many questions.\"\n\nTuppence smiled a little. She felt that Whittington had scored.\n\n\"There's another thing. So far there has been no mention of Mr.\nBeresford. Where does he come in?\"\n\n\"Mr. Beresford?\"\n\n\"My partner,\" said Tuppence with dignity. \"You saw us together\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. But I'm afraid we shan't require his services.\"\n\n\"Then it's off!\" Tuppence rose. \"It's both or neither. Sorry--but that's\nhow it is. Good morning, Mr. Whittington.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute. Let us see if something can't be managed. Sit down\nagain, Miss----\" He paused interrogatively.\n\nTuppence's conscience gave her a passing twinge as she remembered the\narchdeacon. She seized hurriedly on the first name that came into her\nhead.\n\n\"Jane Finn,\" she said hastily; and then paused open-mouthed at the\neffect of those two simple words.\n\nAll the geniality had faded out of Whittington's face. It was purple\nwith rage, and the veins stood out on the forehead. And behind it all\nthere lurked a sort of incredulous dismay. He leaned forward and hissed\nsavagely:\n\n\"So that's your little game, is it?\"\n\nTuppence, though utterly taken aback, nevertheless kept her head. She\nhad not the faintest comprehension of his meaning, but she was naturally\nquick-witted, and felt it imperative to \"keep her end up\" as she phrased\nit.\n\nWhittington went on:\n\n\"Been playing with me, have you, all the time, like a cat and mouse?\nKnew all the time what I wanted you for, but kept up the comedy. Is that\nit, eh?\" He was cooling down. The red colour was ebbing out of his face.\nHe eyed her keenly. \"Who's been blabbing? Rita?\"\n\nTuppence shook her head. She was doubtful as to how long she could\nsustain this illusion, but she realized the importance of not dragging\nan unknown Rita into it.\n\n\"No,\" she replied with perfect truth. \"Rita knows nothing about me.\"\n\nHis eyes still bored into her like gimlets.\n\n\"How much do you know?\" he shot out.\n\n\"Very little indeed,\" answered Tuppence, and was pleased to note that\nWhittington's uneasiness was augmented instead of allayed. To have\nboasted that she knew a lot might have raised doubts in his mind.\n\n\"Anyway,\" snarled Whittington, \"you knew enough to come in here and\nplump out that name.\"\n\n\"It might be my own name,\" Tuppence pointed out.\n\n\"It's likely, isn't it, then there would be two girls with a name like\nthat?\"\n\n\"Or I might just have hit upon it by chance,\" continued Tuppence,\nintoxicated with the success of truthfulness.\n\nMr. Whittington brought his fist down upon the desk with a bang.\n\n\"Quit fooling! How much do you know? And how much do you want?\"\n\nThe last five words took Tuppence's fancy mightily, especially after a\nmeagre breakfast and a supper of buns the night before. Her present part\nwas of the adventuress rather than the adventurous order, but she did\nnot deny its possibilities. She sat up and smiled with the air of one\nwho has the situation thoroughly well in hand.\n\n\"My dear Mr. Whittington,\" she said, \"let us by all means lay our cards\nupon the table. And pray do not be so angry. You heard me say yesterday\nthat I proposed to live by my wits. It seems to me that I have now\nproved I have some wits to live by! I admit I have knowledge of a\ncertain name, but perhaps my knowledge ends there.\"\n\n\"Yes--and perhaps it doesn't,\" snarled Whittington.\n\n\"You insist on misjudging me,\" said Tuppence, and sighed gently.\n\n\"As I said once before,\" said Whittington angrily, \"quit fooling, and\ncome to the point. You can't play the innocent with me. You know a great\ndeal more than you're willing to admit.\"\n\nTuppence paused a moment to admire her own ingenuity, and then said\nsoftly:\n\n\"I shouldn't like to contradict you, Mr. Whittington.\"\n\n\"So we come to the usual question--how much?\"\n\nTuppence was in a dilemma. So far she had fooled Whittington with\ncomplete success, but to mention a palpably impossible sum might awaken\nhis suspicions. An idea flashed across her brain.\n\n\"Suppose we say a little something down, and a fuller discussion of the\nmatter later?\"\n\nWhittington gave her an ugly glance.\n\n\"Blackmail, eh?\"\n\nTuppence smiled sweetly.\n\n\"Oh no! Shall we say payment of services in advance?\"\n\nWhittington grunted.\n\n\"You see,\" explained Tuppence still sweetly, \"I'm so very fond of\nmoney!\"\n\n\"You're about the limit, that's what you are,\" growled Whittington, with\na sort of unwilling admiration. \"You took me in all right. Thought you\nwere quite a meek little kid with just enough brains for my purpose.\"\n\n\"Life,\" moralized Tuppence, \"is full of surprises.\"\n\n\"All the same,\" continued Whittington, \"some one's been talking. You say\nit isn't Rita. Was it----? Oh, come in.\"\n\nThe clerk followed his discreet knock into the room, and laid a paper at\nhis master's elbow.\n\n\"Telephone message just come for you, sir.\"\n\nWhittington snatched it up and read it. A frown gathered on his brow.\n\n\"That'll do, Brown. You can go.\"\n\nThe clerk withdrew, closing the door behind him. Whittington turned to\nTuppence.\n\n\"Come to-morrow at the same time. I'm busy now. Here's fifty to go on\nwith.\"\n\nHe rapidly sorted out some notes, and pushed them across the table to\nTuppence, then stood up, obviously impatient for her to go.\n\nThe girl counted the notes in a businesslike manner, secured them in her\nhandbag, and rose.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Whittington,\" she said politely. \"At least, au\nrevoir, I should say.\"\n\n\"Exactly. Au revoir!\" Whittington looked almost genial again, a\nreversion that aroused in Tuppence a faint misgiving. \"Au revoir, my\nclever and charming young lady.\"\n\nTuppence sped lightly down the stairs. A wild elation possessed her. A\nneighbouring clock showed the time to be five minutes to twelve.\n\n\"Let's give Tommy a surprise!\" murmured Tuppence, and hailed a taxi.\n\nThe cab drew up outside the tube station. Tommy was just within the\nentrance. His eyes opened to their fullest extent as he hurried forward\nto assist Tuppence to alight. She smiled at him affectionately, and\nremarked in a slightly affected voice:\n\n\"Pay the thing, will you, old bean? I've got nothing smaller than a\nfive-pound note!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. A SET BACK\n\nTHE moment was not quite so triumphant as it ought to have been. To\nbegin with, the resources of Tommy's pockets were somewhat limited. In\nthe end the fare was managed, the lady recollecting a plebeian twopence,\nand the driver, still holding the varied assortment of coins in his\nhand, was prevailed upon to move on, which he did after one last hoarse\ndemand as to what the gentleman thought he was giving him?\n\n\"I think you've given him too much, Tommy,\" said Tuppence innocently. \"I\nfancy he wants to give some of it back.\"\n\nIt was possibly this remark which induced the driver to move away.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Beresford, at length able to relieve his feelings,\n\"what the--dickens, did you want to take a taxi for?\"\n\n\"I was afraid I might be late and keep you waiting,\" said Tuppence\ngently.\n\n\"Afraid--you--might--be--late! Oh, Lord, I give it up!\" said Mr.\nBeresford.\n\n\"And really and truly,\" continued Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide,\n\"I haven't got anything smaller than a five-pound note.\"\n\n\"You did that part of it very well, old bean, but all the same the\nfellow wasn't taken in--not for a moment!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully, \"he didn't believe it. That's the\ncurious part about speaking the truth. No one does believe it. I found\nthat out this morning. Now let's go to lunch. How about the Savoy?\"\n\nTommy grinned.\n\n\"How about the Ritz?\"\n\n\"On second thoughts, I prefer the Piccadilly. It's nearer. We shan't\nhave to take another taxi. Come along.\"\n\n\"Is this a new brand of humour? Or is your brain really unhinged?\"\ninquired Tommy.\n\n\"Your last supposition is the correct one. I have come into money, and\nthe shock has been too much for me! For that particular form of mental\ntrouble an eminent physician recommends unlimited Hors d'oeuvre, Lobster\na l'americane, Chicken Newberg, and Peche Melba! Let's go and get them!\"\n\n\"Tuppence, old girl, what has really come over you?\"\n\n\"Oh, unbelieving one!\" Tuppence wrenched open her bag. \"Look here, and\nhere, and here!\"\n\n\"Great Jehosaphat! My dear girl, don't wave Fishers aloft like that!\"\n\n\"They're not Fishers. They're five times better than Fishers, and this\none's ten times better!\"\n\nTommy groaned.\n\n\"I must have been drinking unawares! Am I dreaming, Tuppence, or do I\nreally behold a large quantity of five-pound notes being waved about in\na dangerous fashion?\"\n\n\"Even so, O King! Now, will you come and have lunch?\"\n\n\"I'll come anywhere. But what have you been doing? Holding up a bank?\"\n\n\"All in good time. What an awful place Piccadilly Circus is. There's a\nhuge bus bearing down on us. It would be too terrible if they killed the\nfive-pound notes!\"\n\n\"Grill room?\" inquired Tommy, as they reached the opposite pavement in\nsafety.\n\n\"The other's more expensive,\" demurred Tuppence.\n\n\"That's mere wicked wanton extravagance. Come on below.\"\n\n\"Are you sure I can get all the things I want there?\"\n\n\"That extremely unwholesome menu you were outlining just now? Of course\nyou can--or as much as is good for you, anyway.\"\n\n\"And now tell me,\" said Tommy, unable to restrain his pent-up curiosity\nany longer, as they sat in state surrounded by the many hors d'oeuvre of\nTuppence's dreams.\n\nMiss Cowley told him.\n\n\"And the curious part of it is,\" she ended, \"that I really did invent\nthe name of Jane Finn! I didn't want to give my own because of poor\nfather--in case I should get mixed up in anything shady.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that's so,\" said Tommy slowly. \"But you didn't invent it.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"No. I told it to you. Don't you remember, I said yesterday I'd\noverheard two people talking about a female called Jane Finn? That's\nwhat brought the name into your mind so pat.\"\n\n\"So you did. I remember now. How extraordinary----\" Tuppence tailed off\ninto silence. Suddenly she aroused herself. \"Tommy!\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"What were they like, the two men you passed?\"\n\nTommy frowned in an effort at remembrance.\n\n\"One was a big fat sort of chap. Clean shaven, I think--and dark.\"\n\n\"That's him,\" cried Tuppence, in an ungrammatical squeal. \"That's\nWhittington! What was the other man like?\"\n\n\"I can't remember. I didn't notice him particularly. It was really the\noutlandish name that caught my attention.\"\n\n\"And people say that coincidences don't happen!\" Tuppence tackled her\nPeche Melba happily.\n\nBut Tommy had become serious.\n\n\"Look here, Tuppence, old girl, what is this going to lead to?\"\n\n\"More money,\" replied his companion.\n\n\"I know that. You've only got one idea in your head. What I mean is,\nwhat about the next step? How are you going to keep the game up?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Tuppence laid down her spoon. \"You're right, Tommy, it is a bit of\na poser.\"\n\n\"After all, you know, you can't bluff him forever. You're sure to slip\nup sooner or later. And, anyway, I'm not at all sure that it isn't\nactionable--blackmail, you know.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. Blackmail is saying you'll tell unless you are given\nmoney. Now, there's nothing I could tell, because I don't really know\nanything.\"\n\n\"Hm,\" said Tommy doubtfully. \"Well, anyway, what ARE we going to do?\nWhittington was in a hurry to get rid of you this morning, but next time\nhe'll want to know something more before he parts with his money. He'll\nwant to know how much YOU know, and where you got your information from,\nand a lot of other things that you can't cope with. What are you going\nto do about it?\"\n\nTuppence frowned severely.\n\n\"We must think. Order some Turkish coffee, Tommy. Stimulating to the\nbrain. Oh, dear, what a lot I have eaten!\"\n\n\"You have made rather a hog of yourself! So have I for that matter, but\nI flatter myself that my choice of dishes was more judicious than yours.\nTwo coffees.\" (This was to the waiter.) \"One Turkish, one French.\"\n\nTuppence sipped her coffee with a deeply reflective air, and snubbed\nTommy when he spoke to her.\n\n\"Be quiet. I'm thinking.\"\n\n\"Shades of Pelmanism!\" said Tommy, and relapsed into silence.\n\n\"There!\" said Tuppence at last. \"I've got a plan. Obviously what we've\ngot to do is to find out more about it all.\"\n\nTommy applauded.\n\n\"Don't jeer. We can only find out through Whittington. We must discover\nwhere he lives, what he does--sleuth him, in fact! Now I can't do it,\nbecause he knows me, but he only saw you for a minute or two in Lyons'.\nHe's not likely to recognize you. After all, one young man is much like\nanother.\"\n\n\"I repudiate that remark utterly. I'm sure my pleasing features and\ndistinguished appearance would single me out from any crowd.\"\n\n\"My plan is this,\" Tuppence went on calmly, \"I'll go alone to-morrow.\nI'll put him off again like I did to-day. It doesn't matter if I don't\nget any more money at once. Fifty pounds ought to last us a few days.\"\n\n\"Or even longer!\"\n\n\"You'll hang about outside. When I come out I shan't speak to you in\ncase he's watching. But I'll take up my stand somewhere near, and when\nhe comes out of the building I'll drop a handkerchief or something, and\noff you go!\"\n\n\"Off I go where?\"\n\n\"Follow him, of course, silly! What do you think of the idea?\"\n\n\"Sort of thing one reads about in books. I somehow feel that in real\nlife one will feel a bit of an ass standing in the street for hours with\nnothing to do. People will wonder what I'm up to.\"\n\n\"Not in the city. Every one's in such a hurry. Probably no one will even\nnotice you at all.\"\n\n\"That's the second time you've made that sort of remark. Never mind, I\nforgive you. Anyway, it will be rather a lark. What are you doing this\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Tuppence meditatively. \"I HAD thought of hats! Or perhaps\nsilk stockings! Or perhaps----\"\n\n\"Hold hard,\" admonished Tommy. \"There's a limit to fifty pounds! But\nlet's do dinner and a show to-night at all events.\"\n\n\"Rather.\"\n\nThe day passed pleasantly. The evening even more so. Two of the\nfive-pound notes were now irretrievably dead.\n\nThey met by arrangement the following morning and proceeded citywards.\nTommy remained on the opposite side of the road while Tuppence plunged\ninto the building.\n\nTommy strolled slowly down to the end of the street, then back again.\nJust as he came abreast of the building, Tuppence darted across the\nroad.\n\n\"Tommy!\"\n\n\"Yes. What's up?\"\n\n\"The place is shut. I can't make anyone hear.\"\n\n\"That's odd.\"\n\n\"Isn't it? Come up with me, and let's try again.\"\n\nTommy followed her. As they passed the third floor landing a young clerk\ncame out of an office. He hesitated a moment, then addressed himself to\nTuppence.\n\n\"Were you wanting the Esthonia Glassware?\"\n\n\"Yes, please.\"\n\n\"It's closed down. Since yesterday afternoon. Company being wound up,\nthey say. Not that I've ever heard of it myself. But anyway the office\nis to let.\"\n\n\"Th--thank you,\" faltered Tuppence. \"I suppose you don't know Mr.\nWhittington's address?\"\n\n\"Afraid I don't. They left rather suddenly.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Tommy. \"Come on, Tuppence.\"\n\nThey descended to the street again where they gazed at one another\nblankly.\n\n\"That's torn it,\" said Tommy at length.\n\n\"And I never suspected it,\" wailed Tuppence.\n\n\"Cheer up, old thing, it can't be helped.\"\n\n\"Can't it, though!\" Tuppence's little chin shot out defiantly. \"Do you\nthink this is the end? If so, you're wrong. It's just the beginning!\"\n\n\"The beginning of what?\"\n\n\"Of our adventure! Tommy, don't you see, if they are scared enough to\nrun away like this, it shows that there must be a lot in this Jane Finn\nbusiness! Well, we'll get to the bottom of it. We'll run them down!\nWe'll be sleuths in earnest!\"\n\n\"Yes, but there's no one left to sleuth.\"\n\n\"No, that's why we'll have to start all over again. Lend me that bit of\npencil. Thanks. Wait a minute--don't interrupt. There!\" Tuppence handed\nback the pencil, and surveyed the piece of paper on which she had\nwritten with a satisfied eye:\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Advertisement.\"\n\n\"You're not going to put that thing in after all?\"\n\n\"No, it's a different one.\" She handed him the slip of paper.\n\nTommy read the words on it aloud:\n\n\"WANTED, any information respecting Jane Finn. Apply Y.A.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. WHO IS JANE FINN?\n\nTHE next day passed slowly. It was necessary to curtail expenditure.\nCarefully husbanded, forty pounds will last a long time. Luckily the\nweather was fine, and \"walking is cheap,\" dictated Tuppence. An outlying\npicture house provided them with recreation for the evening.\n\nThe day of disillusionment had been a Wednesday. On Thursday the\nadvertisement had duly appeared. On Friday letters might be expected to\narrive at Tommy's rooms.\n\nHe had been bound by an honourable promise not to open any such letters\nif they did arrive, but to repair to the National Gallery, where his\ncolleague would meet him at ten o'clock.\n\nTuppence was first at the rendezvous. She ensconced herself on a red\nvelvet seat, and gazed at the Turners with unseeing eyes until she saw\nthe familiar figure enter the room.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well,\" returned Mr. Beresford provokingly. \"Which is your favourite\npicture?\"\n\n\"Don't be a wretch. Aren't there ANY answers?\"\n\nTommy shook his head with a deep and somewhat overacted melancholy.\n\n\"I didn't want to disappoint you, old thing, by telling you right off.\nIt's too bad. Good money wasted.\" He sighed. \"Still, there it is. The\nadvertisement has appeared, and--there are only two answers!\"\n\n\"Tommy, you devil!\" almost screamed Tuppence. \"Give them to me. How\ncould you be so mean!\"\n\n\"Your language, Tuppence, your language! They're very particular at the\nNational Gallery. Government show, you know. And do remember, as I have\npointed out to you before, that as a clergyman's daughter----\"\n\n\"I ought to be on the stage!\" finished Tuppence with a snap.\n\n\"That is not what I intended to say. But if you are sure that you have\nenjoyed to the full the reaction of joy after despair with which I have\nkindly provided you free of charge, let us get down to our mail, as the\nsaying goes.\"\n\nTuppence snatched the two precious envelopes from him unceremoniously,\nand scrutinized them carefully.\n\n\"Thick paper, this one. It looks rich. We'll keep it to the last and\nopen the other first.\"\n\n\"Right you are. One, two, three, go!\"\n\nTuppence's little thumb ripped open the envelope, and she extracted the\ncontents.\n\n\n\"DEAR SIR,\n\n\"Referring to your advertisement in this morning's paper, I may be able\nto be of some use to you. Perhaps you could call and see me at the above\naddress at eleven o'clock to-morrow morning.\n\n\"Yours truly,\n\n\"A. CARTER.\"\n\n\n\"27 Carshalton Gardens,\" said Tuppence, referring to the address.\n\"That's Gloucester Road way. Plenty of time to get there if we tube.\"\n\n\"The following,\" said Tommy, \"is the plan of campaign. It is my turn to\nassume the offensive. Ushered into the presence of Mr. Carter, he and I\nwish each other good morning as is customary. He then says: 'Please take\na seat, Mr.--er?' To which I reply promptly and significantly: 'Edward\nWhittington!' whereupon Mr. Carter turns purple in the face and gasps\nout: 'How much?' Pocketing the usual fee of fifty pounds, I rejoin you\nin the road outside, and we proceed to the next address and repeat the\nperformance.\"\n\n\"Don't be absurd, Tommy. Now for the other letter. Oh, this is from the\nRitz!\"\n\n\"A hundred pounds instead of fifty!\"\n\n\"I'll read it:\n\n\"DEAR SIR,\n\n\"Re your advertisement, I should be glad if you would call round\nsomewhere about lunch-time.\n\n\"Yours truly,\n\n\"JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER.\"\n\n\n\"Ha!\" said Tommy. \"Do I smell a Boche? Or only an American millionaire\nof unfortunate ancestry? At all events we'll call at lunch-time. It's a\ngood time--frequently leads to free food for two.\"\n\nTuppence nodded assent.\n\n\"Now for Carter. We'll have to hurry.\"\n\nCarshalton Terrace proved to be an unimpeachable row of what Tuppence\ncalled \"ladylike looking houses.\" They rang the bell at No. 27, and a\nneat maid answered the door. She looked so respectable that Tuppence's\nheart sank. Upon Tommy's request for Mr. Carter, she showed them into\na small study on the ground floor where she left them. Hardly a minute\nelapsed, however, before the door opened, and a tall man with a lean\nhawklike face and a tired manner entered the room.\n\n\"Mr. Y. A.?\" he said, and smiled. His smile was distinctly attractive.\n\"Do sit down, both of you.\"\n\nThey obeyed. He himself took a chair opposite to Tuppence and smiled at\nher encouragingly. There was something in the quality of his smile that\nmade the girl's usual readiness desert her.\n\nAs he did not seem inclined to open the conversation, Tuppence was\nforced to begin.\n\n\"We wanted to know--that is, would you be so kind as to tell us anything\nyou know about Jane Finn?\"\n\n\"Jane Finn? Ah!\" Mr. Carter appeared to reflect. \"Well, the question is,\nwhat do you know about her?\"\n\nTuppence drew herself up.\n\n\"I don't see that that's got anything to do with it.\"\n\n\"No? But it has, you know, really it has.\" He smiled again in his tired\nway, and continued reflectively. \"So that brings us down to it again.\nWhat do you know about Jane Finn?\n\n\"Come now,\" he continued, as Tuppence remained silent. \"You must know\nSOMETHING to have advertised as you did?\" He leaned forward a little,\nhis weary voice held a hint of persuasiveness. \"Suppose you tell me...\"\n\nThere was something very magnetic about Mr. Carter's personality.\nTuppence seemed to shake herself free of it with an effort, as she said:\n\n\"We couldn't do that, could we, Tommy?\"\n\nBut to her surprise, her companion did not back her up. His eyes were\nfixed on Mr. Carter, and his tone when he spoke held an unusual note of\ndeference.\n\n\"I dare say the little we know won't be any good to you, sir. But such\nas it is, you're welcome to it.\"\n\n\"Tommy!\" cried out Tuppence in surprise.\n\nMr. Carter slewed round in his chair. His eyes asked a question.\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I recognized you at once. Saw you in France when I was with\nthe Intelligence. As soon as you came into the room, I knew----\"\n\nMr. Carter held up his hand.\n\n\"No names, please. I'm known as Mr. Carter here. It's my cousin's house,\nby the way. She's willing to lend it to me sometimes when it's a case of\nworking on strictly unofficial lines. Well, now\"--he looked from one to\nthe other--\"who's going to tell me the story?\"\n\n\"Fire ahead, Tuppence,\" directed Tommy. \"It's your yarn.\"\n\n\"Yes, little lady, out with it.\"\n\nAnd obediently Tuppence did out with it, telling the whole story from\nthe forming of the Young Adventurers, Ltd., downwards.\n\nMr. Carter listened in silence with a resumption of his tired manner.\nNow and then he passed his hand across his lips as though to hide a\nsmile. When she had finished he nodded gravely.\n\n\"Not much. But suggestive. Quite suggestive. If you'll excuse my saying\nso, you're a curious young couple. I don't know--you might succeed where\nothers have failed... I believe in luck, you know--always have....\"\n\nHe paused a moment, and then went on.\n\n\"Well, how about it? You're out for adventure. How would you like\nto work for me? All quite unofficial, you know. Expenses paid, and a\nmoderate screw?\"\n\nTuppence gazed at him, her lips parted, her eyes growing wider and\nwider.\n\n\"What should we have to do?\" she breathed.\n\nMr. Carter smiled.\n\n\"Just go on with what you're doing now. FIND JANE FINN.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--who IS Jane Finn?\"\n\nMr. Carter nodded gravely.\n\n\"Yes, you're entitled to know that, I think.\"\n\nHe leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs, brought the tips of his\nfingers together, and began in a low monotone:\n\n\"Secret diplomacy (which, by the way, is nearly always bad policy!) does\nnot concern you. It will be sufficient to say that in the early days of\n1915 a certain document came into being. It was the draft of a secret\nagreement--treaty--call it what you like. It was drawn up ready for\nsignature by the various representatives, and drawn up in America--at\nthat time a neutral country. It was dispatched to England by a special\nmessenger selected for that purpose, a young fellow called Danvers. It\nwas hoped that the whole affair had been kept so secret that nothing\nwould have leaked out. That kind of hope is usually disappointed.\nSomebody always talks!\n\n\"Danvers sailed for England on the Lusitania. He carried the precious\npapers in an oilskin packet which he wore next his skin. It was on that\nparticular voyage that the Lusitania was torpedoed and sunk. Danvers was\namong the list of those missing. Eventually his body was washed ashore,\nand identified beyond any possible doubt. But the oilskin packet was\nmissing!\n\n\"The question was, had it been taken from him, or had he himself\npassed it on into another's keeping? There were a few incidents that\nstrengthened the possibility of the latter theory. After the torpedo\nstruck the ship, in the few moments during the launching of the boats,\nDanvers was seen speaking to a young American girl. No one actually\nsaw him pass anything to her, but he might have done so. It seems to me\nquite likely that he entrusted the papers to this girl, believing that\nshe, as a woman, had a greater chance of bringing them safely to shore.\n\n\"But if so, where was the girl, and what had she done with the papers?\nBy later advice from America it seemed likely that Danvers had been\nclosely shadowed on the way over. Was this girl in league with his\nenemies? Or had she, in her turn, been shadowed and either tricked or\nforced into handing over the precious packet?\n\n\"We set to work to trace her out. It proved unexpectedly difficult.\nHer name was Jane Finn, and it duly appeared among the list of the\nsurvivors, but the girl herself seemed to have vanished completely.\nInquiries into her antecedents did little to help us. She was an orphan,\nand had been what we should call over here a pupil teacher in a small\nschool out West. Her passport had been made out for Paris, where she\nwas going to join the staff of a hospital. She had offered her services\nvoluntarily, and after some correspondence they had been accepted.\nHaving seen her name in the list of the saved from the Lusitania, the\nstaff of the hospital were naturally very surprised at her not arriving\nto take up her billet, and at not hearing from her in any way.\n\n\"Well, every effort was made to trace the young lady--but all in vain.\nWe tracked her across Ireland, but nothing could be heard of her after\nshe set foot in England. No use was made of the draft treaty--as might\nvery easily have been done--and we therefore came to the conclusion that\nDanvers had, after all, destroyed it. The war entered on another phase,\nthe diplomatic aspect changed accordingly, and the treaty was never\nredrafted. Rumours as to its existence were emphatically denied. The\ndisappearance of Jane Finn was forgotten and the whole affair was lost\nin oblivion.\"\n\nMr. Carter paused, and Tuppence broke in impatiently:\n\n\"But why has it all cropped up again? The war's over.\"\n\nA hint of alertness came into Mr. Carter's manner.\n\n\"Because it seems that the papers were not destroyed after all, and that\nthey might be resurrected to-day with a new and deadly significance.\"\n\nTuppence stared. Mr. Carter nodded.\n\n\"Yes, five years ago, that draft treaty was a weapon in our hands;\nto-day it is a weapon against us. It was a gigantic blunder. If its\nterms were made public, it would mean disaster.... It might possibly\nbring about another war--not with Germany this time! That is an extreme\npossibility, and I do not believe in its likelihood myself, but that\ndocument undoubtedly implicates a number of our statesmen whom we cannot\nafford to have discredited in any way at the present moment. As a party\ncry for Labour it would be irresistible, and a Labour Government at this\njuncture would, in my opinion, be a grave disability for British trade,\nbut that is a mere nothing to the REAL danger.\"\n\nHe paused, and then said quietly:\n\n\"You may perhaps have heard or read that there is Bolshevist influence\nat work behind the present Labour unrest?\"\n\nTuppence nodded.\n\n\"That is the truth. Bolshevist gold is pouring into this country for the\nspecific purpose of procuring a Revolution. And there is a certain man,\na man whose real name is unknown to us, who is working in the dark for\nhis own ends. The Bolshevists are behind the Labour unrest--but this\nman is BEHIND THE BOLSHEVISTS. Who is he? We do not know. He is always\nspoken of by the unassuming title of 'Mr. Brown.' But one thing is\ncertain, he is the master criminal of this age. He controls a marvellous\norganization. Most of the Peace propaganda during the war was originated\nand financed by him. His spies are everywhere.\"\n\n\"A naturalized German?\" asked Tommy.\n\n\"On the contrary, I have every reason to believe he is an Englishman. He\nwas pro-German, as he would have been pro-Boer. What he seeks to attain\nwe do not know--probably supreme power for himself, of a kind unique in\nhistory. We have no clue as to his real personality. It is reported that\neven his own followers are ignorant of it. Where we have come across his\ntracks, he has always played a secondary part. Somebody else assumes\nthe chief role. But afterwards we always find that there has been some\nnonentity, a servant or a clerk, who has remained in the background\nunnoticed, and that the elusive Mr. Brown has escaped us once more.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Tuppence jumped. \"I wonder----\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I remember in Mr. Whittington's office. The clerk--he called him Brown.\nYou don't think----\"\n\nCarter nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"Very likely. A curious point is that the name is usually mentioned. An\nidiosyncrasy of genius. Can you describe him at all?\"\n\n\"I really didn't notice. He was quite ordinary--just like anyone else.\"\n\nMr. Carter sighed in his tired manner.\n\n\"That is the invariable description of Mr. Brown! Brought a telephone\nmessage to the man Whittington, did he? Notice a telephone in the outer\noffice?\"\n\nTuppence thought.\n\n\"No, I don't think I did.\"\n\n\"Exactly. That 'message' was Mr. Brown's way of giving an order to his\nsubordinate. He overheard the whole conversation of course. Was it after\nthat that Whittington handed you over the money, and told you to come\nthe following day?\"\n\nTuppence nodded.\n\n\"Yes, undoubtedly the hand of Mr. Brown!\" Mr. Carter paused. \"Well,\nthere it is, you see what you are pitting yourselves against? Possibly\nthe finest criminal brain of the age. I don't quite like it, you know.\nYou're such young things, both of you. I shouldn't like anything to\nhappen to you.\"\n\n\"It won't,\" Tuppence assured him positively.\n\n\"I'll look after her, sir,\" said Tommy.\n\n\"And I'll look after YOU,\" retorted Tuppence, resenting the manly\nassertion.\n\n\"Well, then, look after each other,\" said Mr. Carter, smiling. \"Now\nlet's get back to business. There's something mysterious about this\ndraft treaty that we haven't fathomed yet. We've been threatened with\nit--in plain and unmistakable terms. The Revolutionary element as good\nas declare that it's in their hands, and that they intend to produce it\nat a given moment. On the other hand, they are clearly at fault about\nmany of its provisions. The Government consider it as mere bluff\non their part, and, rightly or wrongly, have stuck to the policy of\nabsolute denial. I'm not so sure. There have been hints, indiscreet\nallusions, that seem to indicate that the menace is a real one. The\nposition is much as though they had got hold of an incriminating\ndocument, but couldn't read it because it was in cipher--but we know\nthat the draft treaty wasn't in cipher--couldn't be in the nature of\nthings--so that won't wash. But there's SOMETHING. Of course, Jane Finn\nmay be dead for all we know--but I don't think so. The curious thing is\nthat THEY'RE TRYING TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE GIRL FROM US.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yes. One or two little things have cropped up. And your story, little\nlady, confirms my idea. They know we're looking for Jane Finn. Well,\nthey'll produce a Jane Finn of their own--say at a pensionnat in Paris.\"\nTuppence gasped, and Mr. Carter smiled. \"No one knows in the least what\nshe looks like, so that's all right. She's primed with a trumped-up\ntale, and her real business is to get as much information as possible\nout of us. See the idea?\"\n\n\"Then you think\"--Tuppence paused to grasp the supposition fully--\"that\nit WAS as Jane Finn that they wanted me to go to Paris?\"\n\nMr. Carter smiled more wearily than ever.\n\n\"I believe in coincidences, you know,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. MR. JULIUS P. HERSHEIMMER\n\n\n\"WELL,\" said Tuppence, recovering herself, \"it really seems as though it\nwere meant to be.\"\n\nCarter nodded.\n\n\"I know what you mean. I'm superstitious myself. Luck, and all that sort\nof thing. Fate seems to have chosen you out to be mixed up in this.\"\n\nTommy indulged in a chuckle.\n\n\"My word! I don't wonder Whittington got the wind up when Tuppence\nplumped out that name! I should have myself. But look here, sir, we're\ntaking up an awful lot of your time. Have you any tips to give us before\nwe clear out?\"\n\n\"I think not. My experts, working in stereotyped ways, have failed.\nYou will bring imagination and an open mind to the task. Don't be\ndiscouraged if that too does not succeed. For one thing there is a\nlikelihood of the pace being forced.\"\n\nTuppence frowned uncomprehendingly.\n\n\"When you had that interview with Whittington, they had time before\nthem. I have information that the big coup was planned for early in the\nnew year. But the Government is contemplating legislative action which\nwill deal effectually with the strike menace. They'll get wind of it\nsoon, if they haven't already, and it's possible that that may bring\nthings to a head. I hope it will myself. The less time they have to\nmature their plans the better. I'm just warning you that you haven't\nmuch time before you, and that you needn't be cast down if you fail.\nIt's not an easy proposition anyway. That's all.\"\n\nTuppence rose.\n\n\"I think we ought to be businesslike. What exactly can we count upon you\nfor, Mr. Carter?\" Mr. Carter's lips twitched slightly, but he replied\nsuccinctly: \"Funds within reason, detailed information on any point, and\nNO OFFICIAL RECOGNITION. I mean that if you get yourselves into trouble\nwith the police, I can't officially help you out of it. You're on your\nown.\"\n\nTuppence nodded sagely.\n\n\"I quite understand that. I'll write out a list of the things I want to\nknow when I've had time to think. Now--about money----\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Tuppence. Do you want to say how much?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. We've got plenty to go with for the present, but when we\nwant more----\"\n\n\"It will be waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--I'm sure I don't want to be rude about the Government if\nyou've got anything to do with it, but you know one really has the devil\nof a time getting anything out of it! And if we have to fill up a blue\nform and send it in, and then, after three months, they send us a green\none, and so on--well, that won't be much use, will it?\"\n\nMr. Carter laughed outright.\n\n\"Don't worry, Miss Tuppence. You will send a personal demand to me here,\nand the money, in notes, shall be sent by return of post. As to salary,\nshall we say at the rate of three hundred a year? And an equal sum for\nMr. Beresford, of course.\"\n\nTuppence beamed upon him.\n\n\"How lovely. You are kind. I do love money! I'll keep beautiful accounts\nof our expenses all debit and credit, and the balance on the right side,\nand red line drawn sideways with the totals the same at the bottom. I\nreally know how to do it when I think.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you do. Well, good-bye, and good luck to you both.\"\n\nHe shook hands with them, and in another minute they were descending the\nsteps of 27 Carshalton Terrace with their heads in a whirl.\n\n\"Tommy! Tell me at once, who is 'Mr. Carter'?\"\n\nTommy murmured a name in her ear.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence, impressed.\n\n\"And I can tell you, old bean, he's IT!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence again. Then she added reflectively,\n\n\"I like him, don't you? He looks so awfully tired and bored, and yet you\nfeel that underneath he's just like steel, all keen and flashing. Oh!\"\nShe gave a skip. \"Pinch me, Tommy, do pinch me. I can't believe it's\nreal!\"\n\nMr. Beresford obliged.\n\n\"Ow! That's enough! Yes, we're not dreaming. We've got a job!\"\n\n\"And what a job! The joint venture has really begun.\"\n\n\"It's more respectable than I thought it would be,\" said Tuppence\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"Luckily I haven't got your craving for crime! What time is it? Let's\nhave lunch--oh!\"\n\nThe same thought sprang to the minds of each. Tommy voiced it first.\n\n\"Julius P. Hersheimmer!\"\n\n\"We never told Mr. Carter about hearing from him.\"\n\n\"Well, there wasn't much to tell--not till we've seen him. Come on, we'd\nbetter take a taxi.\"\n\n\"Now who's being extravagant?\"\n\n\"All expenses paid, remember. Hop in.\"\n\n\"At any rate, we shall make a better effect arriving this way,\" said\nTuppence, leaning back luxuriously. \"I'm sure blackmailers never arrive\nin buses!\"\n\n\"We've ceased being blackmailers,\" Tommy pointed out.\n\n\"I'm not sure I have,\" said Tuppence darkly.\n\nOn inquiring for Mr. Hersheimmer, they were at once taken up to his\nsuite. An impatient voice cried \"Come in\" in answer to the page-boy's\nknock, and the lad stood aside to let them pass in.\n\nMr. Julius P. Hersheimmer was a great deal younger than either Tommy or\nTuppence had pictured him. The girl put him down as thirty-five. He\nwas of middle height, and squarely built to match his jaw. His face was\npugnacious but pleasant. No one could have mistaken him for anything but\nan American, though he spoke with very little accent.\n\n\"Get my note? Sit down and tell me right away all you know about my\ncousin.\"\n\n\"Your cousin?\"\n\n\"Sure thing. Jane Finn.\"\n\n\"Is she your cousin?\"\n\n\"My father and her mother were brother and sister,\" explained Mr.\nHersheimmer meticulously.\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Tuppence. \"Then you know where she is?\"\n\n\"No!\" Mr. Hersheimmer brought down his fist with a bang on the table.\n\"I'm darned if I do! Don't you?\"\n\n\"We advertised to receive information, not to give it,\" said Tuppence\nseverely.\n\n\"I guess I know that. I can read. But I thought maybe it was her back\nhistory you were after, and that you'd know where she was now?\"\n\n\"Well, we wouldn't mind hearing her back history,\" said Tuppence\nguardedly.\n\nBut Mr. Hersheimmer seemed to grow suddenly suspicious.\n\n\"See here,\" he declared. \"This isn't Sicily! No demanding ransom or\nthreatening to crop her ears if I refuse. These are the British Isles,\nso quit the funny business, or I'll just sing out for that beautiful big\nBritish policeman I see out there in Piccadilly.\"\n\nTommy hastened to explain.\n\n\"We haven't kidnapped your cousin. On the contrary, we're trying to find\nher. We're employed to do so.\"\n\nMr. Hersheimmer leant back in his chair.\n\n\"Put me wise,\" he said succinctly.\n\nTommy fell in with this demand in so far as he gave him a guarded\nversion of the disappearance of Jane Finn, and of the possibility of her\nhaving been mixed up unawares in \"some political show.\" He alluded to\nTuppence and himself as \"private inquiry agents\" commissioned to find\nher, and added that they would therefore be glad of any details Mr.\nHersheimmer could give them.\n\nThat gentleman nodded approval.\n\n\"I guess that's all right. I was just a mite hasty. But London gets my\ngoat! I only know little old New York. Just trot out your questions and\nI'll answer.\"\n\nFor the moment this paralysed the Young Adventurers, but Tuppence,\nrecovering herself, plunged boldly into the breach with a reminiscence\nculled from detective fiction.\n\n\"When did you last see the dece--your cousin, I mean?\"\n\n\"Never seen her,\" responded Mr. Hersheimmer.\n\n\"What?\" demanded Tommy, astonished.\n\nHersheimmer turned to him.\n\n\"No, sir. As I said before, my father and her mother were brother and\nsister, just as you might be\"--Tommy did not correct this view of their\nrelationship--\"but they didn't always get on together. And when my aunt\nmade up her mind to marry Amos Finn, who was a poor school teacher out\nWest, my father was just mad! Said if he made his pile, as he seemed\nin a fair way to do, she'd never see a cent of it. Well, the upshot was\nthat Aunt Jane went out West and we never heard from her again.\n\n\"The old man DID pile it up. He went into oil, and he went into steel,\nand he played a bit with railroads, and I can tell you he made Wall\nStreet sit up!\" He paused. \"Then he died--last fall--and I got the\ndollars. Well, would you believe it, my conscience got busy! Kept\nknocking me up and saying: What about your Aunt Jane, way out West?\nIt worried me some. You see, I figured it out that Amos Finn would never\nmake good. He wasn't the sort. End of it was, I hired a man to hunt her\ndown. Result, she was dead, and Amos Finn was dead, but they'd left\na daughter--Jane--who'd been torpedoed in the Lusitania on her way to\nParis. She was saved all right, but they didn't seem able to hear of her\nover this side. I guessed they weren't hustling any, so I thought I'd\ncome along over, and speed things up. I phoned Scotland Yard and the\nAdmiralty first thing. The Admiralty rather choked me off, but Scotland\nYard were very civil--said they would make inquiries, even sent a man\nround this morning to get her photograph. I'm off to Paris to-morrow,\njust to see what the Prefecture is doing. I guess if I go to and fro\nhustling them, they ought to get busy!\"\n\nThe energy of Mr. Hersheimmer was tremendous. They bowed before it.\n\n\"But say now,\" he ended, \"you're not after her for anything? Contempt of\ncourt, or something British? A proud-spirited young American girl might\nfind your rules and regulations in war time rather irksome, and get up\nagainst it. If that's the case, and there's such a thing as graft in\nthis country, I'll buy her off.\"\n\nTuppence reassured him.\n\n\"That's good. Then we can work together. What about some lunch? Shall we\nhave it up here, or go down to the restaurant?\"\n\nTuppence expressed a preference for the latter, and Julius bowed to her\ndecision.\n\nOysters had just given place to Sole Colbert when a card was brought to\nHersheimmer.\n\n\"Inspector Japp, C.I.D. Scotland Yard again. Another man this time. What\ndoes he expect I can tell him that I didn't tell the first chap? I hope\nthey haven't lost that photograph. That Western photographer's place was\nburned down and all his negatives destroyed--this is the only copy in\nexistence. I got it from the principal of the college there.\"\n\nAn unformulated dread swept over Tuppence.\n\n\"You--you don't know the name of the man who came this morning?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. No, I don't. Half a second. It was on his card. Oh, I know!\nInspector Brown. Quiet, unassuming sort of chap.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. A PLAN OF CAMPAIGN\n\nA veil might with profit be drawn over the events of the next half-hour.\nSuffice it to say that no such person as \"Inspector Brown\" was known to\nScotland Yard. The photograph of Jane Finn, which would have been of\nthe utmost value to the police in tracing her, was lost beyond recovery.\nOnce again \"Mr. Brown\" had triumphed.\n\nThe immediate result of this set back was to effect a rapprochement\nbetween Julius Hersheimmer and the Young Adventurers. All barriers went\ndown with a crash, and Tommy and Tuppence felt they had known the young\nAmerican all their lives. They abandoned the discreet reticence of\n\"private inquiry agents,\" and revealed to him the whole history of\nthe joint venture, whereat the young man declared himself \"tickled to\ndeath.\"\n\nHe turned to Tuppence at the close of the narration.\n\n\"I've always had a kind of idea that English girls were just a mite\nmoss-grown. Old-fashioned and sweet, you know, but scared to move round\nwithout a footman or a maiden aunt. I guess I'm a bit behind the times!\"\n\nThe upshot of these confidential relations was that Tommy and Tuppence\ntook up their abode forthwith at the Ritz, in order, as Tuppence put it,\nto keep in touch with Jane Finn's only living relation. \"And put like\nthat,\" she added confidentially to Tommy, \"nobody could boggle at the\nexpense!\"\n\nNobody did, which was the great thing.\n\n\"And now,\" said the young lady on the morning after their installation,\n\"to work!\"\n\nMr. Beresford put down the Daily Mail, which he was reading, and\napplauded with somewhat unnecessary vigour. He was politely requested by\nhis colleague not to be an ass.\n\n\"Dash it all, Tommy, we've got to DO something for our money.\"\n\nTommy sighed.\n\n\"Yes, I fear even the dear old Government will not support us at the\nRitz in idleness for ever.\"\n\n\"Therefore, as I said before, we must DO something.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Tommy, picking up the Daily Mail again, \"DO it. I shan't\nstop you.\"\n\n\"You see,\" continued Tuppence. \"I've been thinking----\"\n\nShe was interrupted by a fresh bout of applause.\n\n\"It's all very well for you to sit there being funny, Tommy. It would do\nyou no harm to do a little brain work too.\"\n\n\"My union, Tuppence, my union! It does not permit me to work before 11\na.m.\"\n\n\"Tommy, do you want something thrown at you? It is absolutely essential\nthat we should without delay map out a plan of campaign.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\"\n\n\"Well, let's do it.\"\n\nTommy laid his paper finally aside. \"There's something of the simplicity\nof the truly great mind about you, Tuppence. Fire ahead. I'm listening.\"\n\n\"To begin with,\" said Tuppence, \"what have we to go upon?\"\n\n\"Absolutely nothing,\" said Tommy cheerily.\n\n\"Wrong!\" Tuppence wagged an energetic finger. \"We have two distinct\nclues.\"\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"First clue, we know one of the gang.\"\n\n\"Whittington?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'd recognize him anywhere.\"\n\n\"Hum,\" said Tommy doubtfully, \"I don't call that much of a clue. You\ndon't know where to look for him, and it's about a thousand to one\nagainst your running against him by accident.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure about that,\" replied Tuppence thoughtfully. \"I've often\nnoticed that once coincidences start happening they go on happening in\nthe most extraordinary way. I dare say it's some natural law that we\nhaven't found out. Still, as you say, we can't rely on that. But there\nARE places in London where simply every one is bound to turn up sooner\nor later. Piccadilly Circus, for instance. One of my ideas was to take\nup my stand there every day with a tray of flags.\"\n\n\"What about meals?\" inquired the practical Tommy.\n\n\"How like a man! What does mere food matter?\"\n\n\"That's all very well. You've just had a thundering good breakfast. No\none's got a better appetite than you have, Tuppence, and by tea-time\nyou'd be eating the flags, pins and all. But, honestly, I don't think\nmuch of the idea. Whittington mayn't be in London at all.\"\n\n\"That's true. Anyway, I think clue No. 2 is more promising.\"\n\n\"Let's hear it.\"\n\n\"It's nothing much. Only a Christian name--Rita. Whittington mentioned\nit that day.\"\n\n\"Are you proposing a third advertisement: Wanted, female crook,\nanswering to the name of Rita?\"\n\n\"I am not. I propose to reason in a logical manner. That man, Danvers,\nwas shadowed on the way over, wasn't he? And it's more likely to have\nbeen a woman than a man----\"\n\n\"I don't see that at all.\"\n\n\"I am absolutely certain that it would be a woman, and a good-looking\none,\" replied Tuppence calmly.\n\n\"On these technical points I bow to your decision,\" murmured Mr.\nBeresford.\n\n\"Now, obviously this woman, whoever she was, was saved.\"\n\n\"How do you make that out?\"\n\n\"If she wasn't, how would they have known Jane Finn had got the papers?\"\n\n\"Correct. Proceed, O Sherlock!\"\n\n\"Now there's just a chance, I admit it's only a chance, that this woman\nmay have been 'Rita.'\"\n\n\"And if so?\"\n\n\"If so, we've got to hunt through the survivors of the Lusitania till we\nfind her.\"\n\n\"Then the first thing is to get a list of the survivors.\"\n\n\"I've got it. I wrote a long list of things I wanted to know, and sent\nit to Mr. Carter. I got his reply this morning, and among other things\nit encloses the official statement of those saved from the Lusitania.\nHow's that for clever little Tuppence?\"\n\n\"Full marks for industry, zero for modesty. But the great point is, is\nthere a 'Rita' on the list?\"\n\n\"That's just what I don't know,\" confessed Tuppence.\n\n\"Don't know?\"\n\n\"Yes. Look here.\" Together they bent over the list. \"You see, very few\nChristian names are given. They're nearly all Mrs. or Miss.\"\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n\"That complicates matters,\" he murmured thoughtfully.\n\nTuppence gave her characteristic \"terrier\" shake.\n\n\"Well, we've just got to get down to it, that's all. We'll start with\nthe London area. Just note down the addresses of any of the females who\nlive in London or roundabout, while I put on my hat.\"\n\nFive minutes later the young couple emerged into Piccadilly, and a few\nseconds later a taxi was bearing them to The Laurels, Glendower Road,\nN.7, the residence of Mrs. Edgar Keith, whose name figured first in a\nlist of seven reposing in Tommy's pocket-book.\n\nThe Laurels was a dilapidated house, standing back from the road with\na few grimy bushes to support the fiction of a front garden. Tommy paid\noff the taxi, and accompanied Tuppence to the front door bell. As she\nwas about to ring it, he arrested her hand.\n\n\"What are you going to say?\"\n\n\"What am I going to say? Why, I shall say--Oh dear, I don't know. It's\nvery awkward.\"\n\n\"I thought as much,\" said Tommy with satisfaction. \"How like a woman! No\nforesight! Now just stand aside, and see how easily the mere male\ndeals with the situation.\" He pressed the bell. Tuppence withdrew to a\nsuitable spot.\n\nA slatternly looking servant, with an extremely dirty face and a pair of\neyes that did not match, answered the door.\n\nTommy had produced a notebook and pencil.\n\n\"Good morning,\" he said briskly and cheerfully. \"From the Hampstead\nBorough Council. The new Voting Register. Mrs. Edgar Keith lives here,\ndoes she not?\"\n\n\"Yaas,\" said the servant.\n\n\"Christian name?\" asked Tommy, his pencil poised.\n\n\"Missus's? Eleanor Jane.\"\n\n\"Eleanor,\" spelt Tommy. \"Any sons or daughters over twenty-one?\"\n\n\"Naow.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Tommy closed the notebook with a brisk snap. \"Good\nmorning.\"\n\nThe servant volunteered her first remark:\n\n\"I thought perhaps as you'd come about the gas,\" she observed\ncryptically, and shut the door.\n\nTommy rejoined his accomplice.\n\n\"You see, Tuppence,\" he observed. \"Child's play to the masculine mind.\"\n\n\"I don't mind admitting that for once you've scored handsomely. I should\nnever have thought of that.\"\n\n\"Good wheeze, wasn't it? And we can repeat it ad lib.\"\n\nLunch-time found the young couple attacking a steak and chips in an\nobscure hostelry with avidity. They had collected a Gladys Mary and a\nMarjorie, been baffled by one change of address, and had been forced to\nlisten to a long lecture on universal suffrage from a vivacious American\nlady whose Christian name had proved to be Sadie.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Tommy, imbibing a long draught of beer, \"I feel better.\nWhere's the next draw?\"\n\nThe notebook lay on the table between them. Tuppence picked it up.\n\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer,\" she read, \"20 South Audley Mansions. Miss Wheeler, 43\nClapington Road, Battersea. She's a lady's maid, as far as I remember,\nso probably won't be there, and, anyway, she's not likely.\"\n\n\"Then the Mayfair lady is clearly indicated as the first port of call.\"\n\n\"Tommy, I'm getting discouraged.\"\n\n\"Buck up, old bean. We always knew it was an outside chance. And,\nanyway, we're only starting. If we draw a blank in London, there's a\nfine tour of England, Ireland and Scotland before us.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Tuppence, her flagging spirits reviving. \"And all expenses\npaid! But, oh, Tommy, I do like things to happen quickly. So far,\nadventure has succeeded adventure, but this morning has been dull as\ndull.\"\n\n\"You must stifle this longing for vulgar sensation, Tuppence. Remember\nthat if Mr. Brown is all he is reported to be, it's a wonder that he has\nnot ere now done us to death. That's a good sentence, quite a literary\nflavour about it.\"\n\n\"You're really more conceited than I am--with less excuse! Ahem! But it\ncertainly is queer that Mr. Brown has not yet wreaked vengeance upon us.\n(You see, I can do it too.) We pass on our way unscathed.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he doesn't think us worth bothering about,\" suggested the young\nman simply.\n\nTuppence received the remark with great disfavour.\n\n\"How horrid you are, Tommy. Just as though we didn't count.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Tuppence. What I meant was that we work like moles in the dark,\nand that he has no suspicion of our nefarious schemes. Ha ha!\"\n\n\"Ha ha!\" echoed Tuppence approvingly, as she rose.\n\nSouth Audley Mansions was an imposing-looking block of flats just off\nPark Lane. No. 20 was on the second floor.\n\nTommy had by this time the glibness born of practice. He rattled off\nthe formula to the elderly woman, looking more like a housekeeper than a\nservant, who opened the door to him.\n\n\"Christian name?\"\n\n\"Margaret.\"\n\nTommy spelt it, but the other interrupted him.\n\n\"No, G U E.\"\n\n\"Oh, Marguerite; French way, I see.\" He paused, then plunged boldly. \"We\nhad her down as Rita Vandemeyer, but I suppose that's incorrect?\"\n\n\"She's mostly called that, sir, but Marguerite's her name.\"\n\n\"Thank you. That's all. Good morning.\"\n\nHardly able to contain his excitement, Tommy hurried down the stairs.\nTuppence was waiting at the angle of the turn.\n\n\"You heard?\"\n\n\"Yes. Oh, TOMMY!\"\n\nTommy squeezed her arm sympathetically.\n\n\"I know, old thing. I feel the same.\"\n\n\"It's--it's so lovely to think of things--and then for them really to\nhappen!\" cried Tuppence enthusiastically.\n\nHer hand was still in Tommy's. They had reached the entrance hall. There\nwere footsteps on the stairs above them, and voices.\n\nSuddenly, to Tommy's complete surprise, Tuppence dragged him into the\nlittle space by the side of the lift where the shadow was deepest.\n\n\"What the----\"\n\n\"Hush!\"\n\nTwo men came down the stairs and passed out through the entrance.\nTuppence's hand closed tighter on Tommy's arm.\n\n\"Quick--follow them. I daren't. He might recognize me. I don't know who\nthe other man is, but the bigger of the two was Whittington.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE HOUSE IN SOHO\n\nWHITTINGTON and his companion were walking at a good pace. Tommy started\nin pursuit at once, and was in time to see them turn the corner of the\nstreet. His vigorous strides soon enabled him to gain upon them, and by\nthe time he, in his turn, reached the corner the distance between them\nwas sensibly lessened. The small Mayfair streets were comparatively\ndeserted, and he judged it wise to content himself with keeping them in\nsight.\n\nThe sport was a new one to him. Though familiar with the technicalities\nfrom a course of novel reading, he had never before attempted to\n\"follow\" anyone, and it appeared to him at once that, in actual\npractice, the proceeding was fraught with difficulties. Supposing, for\ninstance, that they should suddenly hail a taxi? In books, you simply\nleapt into another, promised the driver a sovereign--or its modern\nequivalent--and there you were. In actual fact, Tommy foresaw that it\nwas extremely likely there would be no second taxi. Therefore he\nwould have to run. What happened in actual fact to a young man who ran\nincessantly and persistently through the London streets? In a main road\nhe might hope to create the illusion that he was merely running for a\nbus. But in these obscure aristocratic byways he could not but feel that\nan officious policeman might stop him to explain matters.\n\nAt this juncture in his thoughts a taxi with flag erect turned the\ncorner of the street ahead. Tommy held his breath. Would they hail it?\n\nHe drew a sigh of relief as they allowed it to pass unchallenged. Their\ncourse was a zigzag one designed to bring them as quickly as possible\nto Oxford Street. When at length they turned into it, proceeding in an\neasterly direction, Tommy slightly increased his pace. Little by little\nhe gained upon them. On the crowded pavement there was little chance of\nhis attracting their notice, and he was anxious if possible to catch\na word or two of their conversation. In this he was completely\nfoiled; they spoke low and the din of the traffic drowned their voices\neffectually.\n\nJust before the Bond Street Tube station they crossed the road, Tommy,\nunperceived, faithfully at their heels, and entered the big Lyons'.\nThere they went up to the first floor, and sat at a small table in the\nwindow. It was late, and the place was thinning out. Tommy took a seat\nat the table next to them, sitting directly behind Whittington in case\nof recognition. On the other hand, he had a full view of the second man\nand studied him attentively. He was fair, with a weak, unpleasant face,\nand Tommy put him down as being either a Russian or a Pole. He was\nprobably about fifty years of age, his shoulders cringed a little as he\ntalked, and his eyes, small and crafty, shifted unceasingly.\n\nHaving already lunched heartily, Tommy contented himself with ordering\na Welsh rarebit and a cup of coffee. Whittington ordered a substantial\nlunch for himself and his companion; then, as the waitress withdrew, he\nmoved his chair a little closer to the table and began to talk earnestly\nin a low voice. The other man joined in. Listen as he would, Tommy could\nonly catch a word here and there; but the gist of it seemed to be some\ndirections or orders which the big man was impressing on his companion,\nand with which the latter seemed from time to time to disagree.\nWhittington addressed the other as Boris.\n\nTommy caught the word \"Ireland\" several times, also \"propaganda,\" but\nof Jane Finn there was no mention. Suddenly, in a lull in the clatter of\nthe room, he got one phrase entire. Whittington was speaking. \"Ah, but\nyou don't know Flossie. She's a marvel. An archbishop would swear she\nwas his own mother. She gets the voice right every time, and that's\nreally the principal thing.\"\n\nTommy did not hear Boris's reply, but in response to it Whittington said\nsomething that sounded like: \"Of course--only in an emergency....\"\n\nThen he lost the thread again. But presently the phrases became distinct\nagain whether because the other two had insensibly raised their voices,\nor because Tommy's ears were getting more attuned, he could not tell.\nBut two words certainly had a most stimulating effect upon the listener.\nThey were uttered by Boris and they were: \"Mr. Brown.\"\n\nWhittington seemed to remonstrate with him, but he merely laughed.\n\n\"Why not, my friend? It is a name most respectable--most common. Did\nhe not choose it for that reason? Ah, I should like to meet him--Mr.\nBrown.\"\n\nThere was a steely ring in Whittington's voice as he replied:\n\n\"Who knows? You may have met him already.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" retorted the other. \"That is children's talk--a fable for the\npolice. Do you know what I say to myself sometimes? That he is a fable\ninvented by the Inner Ring, a bogy to frighten us with. It might be so.\"\n\n\"And it might not.\"\n\n\"I wonder... or is it indeed true that he is with us and amongst us,\nunknown to all but a chosen few? If so, he keeps his secret well. And\nthe idea is a good one, yes. We never know. We look at each other--ONE\nOF US IS MR. BROWN--which? He commands--but also he serves. Among us--in\nthe midst of us. And no one knows which he is....\"\n\nWith an effort the Russian shook off the vagary of his fancy. He looked\nat his watch.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Whittington. \"We might as well go.\"\n\nHe called the waitress and asked for his bill. Tommy did likewise, and a\nfew moments later was following the two men down the stairs.\n\nOutside, Whittington hailed a taxi, and directed the driver to go to\nWaterloo.\n\nTaxis were plentiful here, and before Whittington's had driven off\nanother was drawing up to the curb in obedience to Tommy's peremptory\nhand.\n\n\"Follow that other taxi,\" directed the young man. \"Don't lose it.\"\n\nThe elderly chauffeur showed no interest. He merely grunted and jerked\ndown his flag. The drive was uneventful. Tommy's taxi came to rest at\nthe departure platform just after Whittington's. Tommy was behind him at\nthe booking-office. He took a first-class single ticket to Bournemouth,\nTommy did the same. As he emerged, Boris remarked, glancing up at the\nclock: \"You are early. You have nearly half an hour.\"\n\nBoris's words had aroused a new train of thought in Tommy's mind.\nClearly Whittington was making the journey alone, while the other\nremained in London. Therefore he was left with a choice as to which he\nwould follow. Obviously, he could not follow both of them unless----Like\nBoris, he glanced up at the clock, and then to the announcement board\nof the trains. The Bournemouth train left at 3.30. It was now ten past.\nWhittington and Boris were walking up and down by the bookstall. He gave\none doubtful look at them, then hurried into an adjacent telephone\nbox. He dared not waste time in trying to get hold of Tuppence. In all\nprobability she was still in the neighbourhood of South Audley Mansions.\nBut there remained another ally. He rang up the Ritz and asked for\nJulius Hersheimmer. There was a click and a buzz. Oh, if only the young\nAmerican was in his room! There was another click, and then \"Hello\" in\nunmistakable accents came over the wire.\n\n\"That you, Hersheimmer? Beresford speaking. I'm at Waterloo. I've\nfollowed Whittington and another man here. No time to explain.\nWhittington's off to Bournemouth by the 3.30. Can you get there by\nthen?\"\n\nThe reply was reassuring.\n\n\"Sure. I'll hustle.\"\n\nThe telephone rang off. Tommy put back the receiver with a sigh of\nrelief. His opinion of Julius's power of hustling was high. He felt\ninstinctively that the American would arrive in time.\n\nWhittington and Boris were still where he had left them. If Boris\nremained to see his friend off, all was well. Then Tommy fingered his\npocket thoughtfully. In spite of the carte blanche assured to him, he\nhad not yet acquired the habit of going about with any considerable sum\nof money on him. The taking of the first-class ticket to Bournemouth\nhad left him with only a few shillings in his pocket. It was to be hoped\nthat Julius would arrive better provided.\n\nIn the meantime, the minutes were creeping by: 3.15, 3.20, 3.25, 3.27.\nSupposing Julius did not get there in time. 3.29.... Doors were banging.\nTommy felt cold waves of despair pass over him. Then a hand fell on his\nshoulder.\n\n\"Here I am, son. Your British traffic beats description! Put me wise to\nthe crooks right away.\"\n\n\"That's Whittington--there, getting in now, that big dark man. The other\nis the foreign chap he's talking to.\"\n\n\"I'm on to them. Which of the two is my bird?\"\n\nTommy had thought out this question.\n\n\"Got any money with you?\"\n\nJulius shook his head, and Tommy's face fell.\n\n\"I guess I haven't more than three or four hundred dollars with me at\nthe moment,\" explained the American.\n\nTommy gave a faint whoop of relief.\n\n\"Oh, Lord, you millionaires! You don't talk the same language! Climb\naboard the lugger. Here's your ticket. Whittington's your man.\"\n\n\"Me for Whittington!\" said Julius darkly. The train was just starting\nas he swung himself aboard. \"So long, Tommy.\" The train slid out of the\nstation.\n\nTommy drew a deep breath. The man Boris was coming along the platform\ntowards him. Tommy allowed him to pass and then took up the chase once\nmore.\n\nFrom Waterloo Boris took the tube as far as Piccadilly Circus. Then he\nwalked up Shaftesbury Avenue, finally turning off into the maze of mean\nstreets round Soho. Tommy followed him at a judicious distance.\n\nThey reached at length a small dilapidated square. The houses there had\na sinister air in the midst of their dirt and decay. Boris looked round,\nand Tommy drew back into the shelter of a friendly porch. The place was\nalmost deserted. It was a cul-de-sac, and consequently no traffic passed\nthat way. The stealthy way the other had looked round stimulated Tommy's\nimagination. From the shelter of the doorway he watched him go up the\nsteps of a particularly evil-looking house and rap sharply, with a\npeculiar rhythm, on the door. It was opened promptly, he said a word or\ntwo to the doorkeeper, then passed inside. The door was shut to again.\n\nIt was at this juncture that Tommy lost his head. What he ought to have\ndone, what any sane man would have done, was to remain patiently where\nhe was and wait for his man to come out again. What he did do was\nentirely foreign to the sober common sense which was, as a rule, his\nleading characteristic. Something, as he expressed it, seemed to snap in\nhis brain. Without a moment's pause for reflection he, too, went up the\nsteps, and reproduced as far as he was able the peculiar knock.\n\nThe door swung open with the same promptness as before. A\nvillainous-faced man with close-cropped hair stood in the doorway.\n\n\"Well?\" he grunted.\n\nIt was at that moment that the full realization of his folly began to\ncome home to Tommy. But he dared not hesitate. He seized at the first\nwords that came into his mind.\n\n\"Mr. Brown?\" he said.\n\nTo his surprise the man stood aside.\n\n\"Upstairs,\" he said, jerking his thumb over his shoulder, \"second door\non your left.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE ADVENTURES OF TOMMY\n\n\nTAKEN aback though he was by the man's words, Tommy did not hesitate.\nIf audacity had successfully carried him so far, it was to be hoped\nit would carry him yet farther. He quietly passed into the house and\nmounted the ramshackle staircase. Everything in the house was filthy\nbeyond words. The grimy paper, of a pattern now indistinguishable,\nhung in loose festoons from the wall. In every angle was a grey mass of\ncobweb.\n\nTommy proceeded leisurely. By the time he reached the bend of the\nstaircase, he had heard the man below disappear into a back room.\nClearly no suspicion attached to him as yet. To come to the house and\nask for \"Mr. Brown\" appeared indeed to be a reasonable and natural\nproceeding.\n\nAt the top of the stairs Tommy halted to consider his next move. In\nfront of him ran a narrow passage, with doors opening on either side of\nit. From the one nearest him on the left came a low murmur of voices.\nIt was this room which he had been directed to enter. But what held\nhis glance fascinated was a small recess immediately on his right,\nhalf concealed by a torn velvet curtain. It was directly opposite the\nleft-handed door and, owing to its angle, it also commanded a good view\nof the upper part of the staircase. As a hiding-place for one or, at a\npinch, two men, it was ideal, being about two feet deep and three feet\nwide. It attracted Tommy mightily. He thought things over in his usual\nslow and steady way, deciding that the mention of \"Mr. Brown\" was not a\nrequest for an individual, but in all probability a password used by\nthe gang. His lucky use of it had gained him admission. So far he had\naroused no suspicion. But he must decide quickly on his next step.\n\nSuppose he were boldly to enter the room on the left of the passage.\nWould the mere fact of his having been admitted to the house be\nsufficient? Perhaps a further password would be required, or, at any\nrate, some proof of identity. The doorkeeper clearly did not know all\nthe members of the gang by sight, but it might be different upstairs.\nOn the whole it seemed to him that luck had served him very well so far,\nbut that there was such a thing as trusting it too far. To enter\nthat room was a colossal risk. He could not hope to sustain his part\nindefinitely; sooner or later he was almost bound to betray himself, and\nthen he would have thrown away a vital chance in mere foolhardiness.\n\nA repetition of the signal knock sounded on the door below, and Tommy,\nhis mind made up, slipped quickly into the recess, and cautiously drew\nthe curtain farther across so that it shielded him completely from\nsight. There were several rents and slits in the ancient material which\nafforded him a good view. He would watch events, and any time he chose\ncould, after all, join the assembly, modelling his behaviour on that of\nthe new arrival.\n\nThe man who came up the staircase with a furtive, soft-footed tread was\nquite unknown to Tommy. He was obviously of the very dregs of society.\nThe low beetling brows, and the criminal jaw, the bestiality of the\nwhole countenance were new to the young man, though he was a type that\nScotland Yard would have recognized at a glance.\n\nThe man passed the recess, breathing heavily as he went. He stopped at\nthe door opposite, and gave a repetition of the signal knock. A voice\ninside called out something, and the man opened the door and passed in,\naffording Tommy a momentary glimpse of the room inside. He thought there\nmust be about four or five people seated round a long table that took up\nmost of the space, but his attention was caught and held by a tall man\nwith close-cropped hair and a short, pointed, naval-looking beard,\nwho sat at the head of the table with papers in front of him. As the\nnew-comer entered he glanced up, and with a correct, but curiously\nprecise enunciation, which attracted Tommy's notice, he asked:\n\n\"Your number, comrade?\"\n\n\"Fourteen, gov'nor,\" replied the other hoarsely.\n\n\"Correct.\"\n\nThe door shut again.\n\n\"If that isn't a Hun, I'm a Dutchman!\" said Tommy to himself. \"And\nrunning the show darned systematically too--as they always do. Lucky I\ndidn't roll in. I'd have given the wrong number, and there would have\nbeen the deuce to pay. No, this is the place for me. Hullo, here's\nanother knock.\"\n\nThis visitor proved to be of an entirely different type to the last.\nTommy recognized in him an Irish Sinn Feiner. Certainly Mr. Brown's\norganization was a far-reaching concern. The common criminal, the\nwell-bred Irish gentleman, the pale Russian, and the efficient German\nmaster of the ceremonies! Truly a strange and sinister gathering! Who\nwas this man who held in his finger these curiously variegated links of\nan unknown chain?\n\nIn this case, the procedure was exactly the same. The signal knock, the\ndemand for a number, and the reply \"Correct.\"\n\nTwo knocks followed in quick succession on the door below. The first man\nwas quite unknown to Tommy, who put him down as a city clerk. A quiet,\nintelligent-looking man, rather shabbily dressed. The second was of the\nworking classes, and his face was vaguely familiar to the young man.\n\nThree minutes later came another, a man of commanding appearance,\nexquisitely dressed, and evidently well born. His face, again, was not\nunknown to the watcher, though he could not for the moment put a name to\nit.\n\nAfter his arrival there was a long wait. In fact Tommy concluded that\nthe gathering was now complete, and was just cautiously creeping out\nfrom his hiding-place, when another knock sent him scuttling back to\ncover.\n\nThis last-comer came up the stairs so quietly that he was almost abreast\nof Tommy before the young man had realized his presence.\n\nHe was a small man, very pale, with a gentle almost womanish air. The\nangle of the cheek-bones hinted at his Slavonic ancestry, otherwise\nthere was nothing to indicate his nationality. As he passed the recess,\nhe turned his head slowly. The strange light eyes seemed to burn through\nthe curtain; Tommy could hardly believe that the man did not know he was\nthere and in spite of himself he shivered. He was no more fanciful than\nthe majority of young Englishmen, but he could not rid himself of the\nimpression that some unusually potent force emanated from the man. The\ncreature reminded him of a venomous snake.\n\nA moment later his impression was proved correct. The new-comer knocked\non the door as all had done, but his reception was very different. The\nbearded man rose to his feet, and all the others followed suit. The\nGerman came forward and shook hands. His heels clicked together.\n\n\"We are honoured,\" he said. \"We are greatly honoured. I much feared that\nit would be impossible.\"\n\nThe other answered in a low voice that had a kind of hiss in it:\n\n\"There were difficulties. It will not be possible again, I fear. But one\nmeeting is essential--to define my policy. I can do nothing without--Mr.\nBrown. He is here?\"\n\nThe change in the German's voice was audible as he replied with slight\nhesitation:\n\n\"We have received a message. It is impossible for him to be present\nin person.\" He stopped, giving a curious impression of having left the\nsentence unfinished.\n\nA very slow smile overspread the face of the other. He looked round at a\ncircle of uneasy faces.\n\n\"Ah! I understand. I have read of his methods. He works in the dark and\ntrusts no one. But, all the same, it is possible that he is among us\nnow....\" He looked round him again, and again that expression of fear\nswept over the group. Each man seemed eyeing his neighbour doubtfully.\n\nThe Russian tapped his cheek.\n\n\"So be it. Let us proceed.\"\n\nThe German seemed to pull himself together. He indicated the place he\nhad been occupying at the head of the table. The Russian demurred, but\nthe other insisted.\n\n\"It is the only possible place,\" he said, \"for--Number One. Perhaps\nNumber Fourteen will shut the door?\"\n\nIn another moment Tommy was once more confronting bare wooden panels,\nand the voices within had sunk once more to a mere undistinguishable\nmurmur. Tommy became restive. The conversation he had overheard had\nstimulated his curiosity. He felt that, by hook or by crook, he must\nhear more.\n\nThere was no sound from below, and it did not seem likely that the\ndoorkeeper would come upstairs. After listening intently for a minute or\ntwo, he put his head round the curtain. The passage was deserted. Tommy\nbent down and removed his shoes, then, leaving them behind the curtain,\nhe walked gingerly out on his stockinged feet, and kneeling down by\nthe closed door he laid his ear cautiously to the crack. To his intense\nannoyance he could distinguish little more; just a chance word here and\nthere if a voice was raised, which merely served to whet his curiosity\nstill farther.\n\nHe eyed the handle of the door tentatively. Could he turn it by degrees\nso gently and imperceptibly that those in the room would notice nothing?\nHe decided that with great care it could be done. Very slowly, a\nfraction of an inch at a time, he moved it round, holding his breath in\nhis excessive care. A little more--a little more still--would it never\nbe finished? Ah! at last it would turn no farther.\n\nHe stayed so for a minute or two, then drew a deep breath, and pressed\nit ever so slightly inward. The door did not budge. Tommy was annoyed.\nIf he had to use too much force, it would almost certainly creak.\nHe waited until the voices rose a little, then he tried again. Still\nnothing happened. He increased the pressure. Had the beastly thing\nstuck? Finally, in desperation, he pushed with all his might. But the\ndoor remained firm, and at last the truth dawned upon him. It was locked\nor bolted on the inside.\n\nFor a moment or two Tommy's indignation got the better of him.\n\n\"Well, I'm damned!\" he said. \"What a dirty trick!\"\n\nAs his indignation cooled, he prepared to face the situation. Clearly\nthe first thing to be done was to restore the handle to its original\nposition. If he let it go suddenly, the men inside would be almost\ncertain to notice it, so, with the same infinite pains, he reversed his\nformer tactics. All went well, and with a sigh of relief the young man\nrose to his feet. There was a certain bulldog tenacity about Tommy that\nmade him slow to admit defeat. Checkmated for the moment, he was far\nfrom abandoning the conflict. He still intended to hear what was going\non in the locked room. As one plan had failed, he must hunt about for\nanother.\n\nHe looked round him. A little farther along the passage on the left was\na second door. He slipped silently along to it. He listened for a moment\nor two, then tried the handle. It yielded, and he slipped inside.\n\nThe room, which was untenanted, was furnished as a bedroom. Like\neverything else in the house, the furniture was falling to pieces, and\nthe dirt was, if anything, more abundant.\n\nBut what interested Tommy was the thing he had hoped to find, a\ncommunicating door between the two rooms, up on the left by the window.\nCarefully closing the door into the passage behind him, he stepped\nacross to the other and examined it closely. The bolt was shot across\nit. It was very rusty, and had clearly not been used for some time. By\ngently wriggling it to and fro, Tommy managed to draw it back without\nmaking too much noise. Then he repeated his former manoeuvres with the\nhandle--this time with complete success. The door swung open--a crack,\na mere fraction, but enough for Tommy to hear what went on. There was\na velvet portiere on the inside of this door which prevented him from\nseeing, but he was able to recognize the voices with a reasonable amount\nof accuracy.\n\nThe Sinn Feiner was speaking. His rich Irish voice was unmistakable:\n\n\"That's all very well. But more money is essential. No money--no\nresults!\"\n\nAnother voice which Tommy rather thought was that of Boris replied:\n\n\"Will you guarantee that there ARE results?\"\n\n\"In a month from now--sooner or later as you wish--I will guarantee you\nsuch a reign of terror in Ireland as shall shake the British Empire to\nits foundations.\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then came the soft, sibilant accents of Number\nOne:\n\n\"Good! You shall have the money. Boris, you will see to that.\"\n\nBoris asked a question:\n\n\"Via the Irish Americans, and Mr. Potter as usual?\"\n\n\"I guess that'll be all right!\" said a new voice, with a transatlantic\nintonation, \"though I'd like to point out, here and now, that things\nare getting a mite difficult. There's not the sympathy there was, and\na growing disposition to let the Irish settle their own affairs without\ninterference from America.\"\n\nTommy felt that Boris had shrugged his shoulders as he answered:\n\n\"Does that matter, since the money only nominally comes from the\nStates?\"\n\n\"The chief difficulty is the landing of the ammunition,\" said the Sinn\nFeiner. \"The money is conveyed in easily enough--thanks to our colleague\nhere.\"\n\nAnother voice, which Tommy fancied was that of the tall,\ncommanding-looking man whose face had seemed familiar to him, said:\n\n\"Think of the feelings of Belfast if they could hear you!\"\n\n\"That is settled, then,\" said the sibilant tones. \"Now, in the matter\nof the loan to an English newspaper, you have arranged the details\nsatisfactorily, Boris?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"That is good. An official denial from Moscow will be forthcoming if\nnecessary.\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then the clear voice of the German broke the\nsilence:\n\n\"I am directed by--Mr. Brown, to place the summaries of the reports\nfrom the different unions before you. That of the miners is most\nsatisfactory. We must hold back the railways. There may be trouble with\nthe A.S.E.\"\n\nFor a long time there was a silence, broken only by the rustle of papers\nand an occasional word of explanation from the German. Then Tommy heard\nthe light tap-tap of fingers, drumming on the table.\n\n\"And--the date, my friend?\" said Number One.\n\n\"The 29th.\"\n\nThe Russian seemed to consider:\n\n\"That is rather soon.\"\n\n\"I know. But it was settled by the principal Labour leaders, and we\ncannot seem to interfere too much. They must believe it to be entirely\ntheir own show.\"\n\nThe Russian laughed softly, as though amused.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he said. \"That is true. They must have no inkling that we\nare using them for our own ends. They are honest men--and that is their\nvalue to us. It is curious--but you cannot make a revolution without\nhonest men. The instinct of the populace is infallible.\" He paused, and\nthen repeated, as though the phrase pleased him: \"Every revolution has\nhad its honest men. They are soon disposed of afterwards.\"\n\nThere was a sinister note in his voice.\n\nThe German resumed:\n\n\"Clymes must go. He is too far-seeing. Number Fourteen will see to\nthat.\"\n\nThere was a hoarse murmur.\n\n\"That's all right, gov'nor.\" And then after a moment or two: \"Suppose\nI'm nabbed.\"\n\n\"You will have the best legal talent to defend you,\" replied the\nGerman quietly. \"But in any case you will wear gloves fitted with the\nfinger-prints of a notorious housebreaker. You have little to fear.\"\n\n\"Oh, I ain't afraid, gov'nor. All for the good of the cause. The streets\nis going to run with blood, so they say.\" He spoke with a grim relish.\n\"Dreams of it, sometimes, I does. And diamonds and pearls rolling about\nin the gutter for anyone to pick up!\"\n\nTommy heard a chair shifted. Then Number One spoke:\n\n\"Then all is arranged. We are assured of success?\"\n\n\"I--think so.\" But the German spoke with less than his usual confidence.\n\nNumber One's voice held suddenly a dangerous quality:\n\n\"What has gone wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing; but----\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"The Labour leaders. Without them, as you say, we can do nothing. If\nthey do not declare a general strike on the 29th----\"\n\n\"Why should they not?\"\n\n\"As you've said, they're honest. And, in spite of everything we've\ndone to discredit the Government in their eyes, I'm not sure that they\nhaven't got a sneaking faith and belief in it.\"\n\n\"But----\"\n\n\"I know. They abuse it unceasingly. But, on the whole, public opinion\nswings to the side of the Government. They will not go against it.\"\n\nAgain the Russian's fingers drummed on the table.\n\n\"To the point, my friend. I was given to understand that there was a\ncertain document in existence which assured success.\"\n\n\"That is so. If that document were placed before the leaders, the result\nwould be immediate. They would publish it broadcast throughout England,\nand declare for the revolution without a moment's hesitation. The\nGovernment would be broken finally and completely.\"\n\n\"Then what more do you want?\"\n\n\"The document itself,\" said the German bluntly.\n\n\"Ah! It is not in your possession? But you know where it is?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Does anyone know where it is?\"\n\n\"One person--perhaps. And we are not sure of that even.\"\n\n\"Who is this person?\"\n\n\"A girl.\"\n\nTommy held his breath.\n\n\"A girl?\" The Russian's voice rose contemptuously. \"And you have not\nmade her speak? In Russia we have ways of making a girl talk.\"\n\n\"This case is different,\" said the German sullenly.\n\n\"How--different?\" He paused a moment, then went on: \"Where is the girl\nnow?\"\n\n\"The girl?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"She is----\"\n\nBut Tommy heard no more. A crashing blow descended on his head, and all\nwas darkness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. TUPPENCE ENTERS DOMESTIC SERVICE\n\nWHEN Tommy set forth on the trail of the two men, it took all Tuppence's\nself-command to refrain from accompanying him. However, she contained\nherself as best she might, consoled by the reflection that her reasoning\nhad been justified by events. The two men had undoubtedly come from the\nsecond floor flat, and that one slender thread of the name \"Rita\" had\nset the Young Adventurers once more upon the track of the abductors of\nJane Finn.\n\nThe question was what to do next? Tuppence hated letting the grass grow\nunder her feet. Tommy was amply employed, and debarred from joining him\nin the chase, the girl felt at a loose end. She retraced her steps\nto the entrance hall of the mansions. It was now tenanted by a small\nlift-boy, who was polishing brass fittings, and whistling the latest air\nwith a good deal of vigour and a reasonable amount of accuracy.\n\nHe glanced round at Tuppence's entry. There was a certain amount of the\ngamin element in the girl, at all events she invariably got on well\nwith small boys. A sympathetic bond seemed instantly to be formed. She\nreflected that an ally in the enemy's camp, so to speak, was not to be\ndespised.\n\n\"Well, William,\" she remarked cheerfully, in the best approved\nhospital-early-morning style, \"getting a good shine up?\"\n\nThe boy grinned responsively.\n\n\"Albert, miss,\" he corrected.\n\n\"Albert be it,\" said Tuppence. She glanced mysteriously round the hall.\nThe effect was purposely a broad one in case Albert should miss it. She\nleaned towards the boy and dropped her voice: \"I want a word with you,\nAlbert.\"\n\nAlbert ceased operations on the fittings and opened his mouth slightly.\n\n\"Look! Do you know what this is?\" With a dramatic gesture she flung back\nthe left side of her coat and exposed a small enamelled badge. It was\nextremely unlikely that Albert would have any knowledge of it--indeed,\nit would have been fatal for Tuppence's plans, since the badge in\nquestion was the device of a local training corps originated by the\narchdeacon in the early days of the war. Its presence in Tuppence's coat\nwas due to the fact that she had used it for pinning in some flowers a\nday or two before. But Tuppence had sharp eyes, and had noted the corner\nof a threepenny detective novel protruding from Albert's pocket, and the\nimmediate enlargement of his eyes told her that her tactics were good,\nand that the fish would rise to the bait.\n\n\"American Detective Force!\" she hissed.\n\nAlbert fell for it.\n\n\"Lord!\" he murmured ecstatically.\n\nTuppence nodded at him with the air of one who has established a\nthorough understanding.\n\n\"Know who I'm after?\" she inquired genially.\n\nAlbert, still round-eyed, demanded breathlessly:\n\n\"One of the flats?\"\n\nTuppence nodded and jerked a thumb up the stairs.\n\n\"No. 20. Calls herself Vandemeyer. Vandemeyer! Ha! ha!\"\n\nAlbert's hand stole to his pocket.\n\n\"A crook?\" he queried eagerly.\n\n\"A crook? I should say so. Ready Rita they call her in the States.\"\n\n\"Ready Rita,\" repeated Albert deliriously. \"Oh, ain't it just like the\npictures!\"\n\nIt was. Tuppence was a great frequenter of the cinema.\n\n\"Annie always said as how she was a bad lot,\" continued the boy.\n\n\"Who's Annie?\" inquired Tuppence idly.\n\n\"'Ouse-parlourmaid. She's leaving to-day. Many's the time Annie's said\nto me: 'Mark my words, Albert, I wouldn't wonder if the police was to\ncome after her one of these days.' Just like that. But she's a stunner\nto look at, ain't she?\"\n\n\"She's some peach,\" allowed Tuppence carelessly. \"Finds it useful in her\nlay-out, you bet. Has she been wearing any of the emeralds, by the way?\"\n\n\"Emeralds? Them's the green stones, isn't they?\"\n\nTuppence nodded.\n\n\"That's what we're after her for. You know old man Rysdale?\"\n\nAlbert shook his head.\n\n\"Peter B. Rysdale, the oil king?\"\n\n\"It seems sort of familiar to me.\"\n\n\"The sparklers belonged to him. Finest collection of emeralds in the\nworld. Worth a million dollars!\"\n\n\"Lumme!\" came ecstatically from Albert. \"It sounds more like the\npictures every minute.\"\n\nTuppence smiled, gratified at the success of her efforts.\n\n\"We haven't exactly proved it yet. But we're after her. And\"--she\nproduced a long-drawn-out wink--\"I guess she won't get away with the\ngoods this time.\"\n\nAlbert uttered another ejaculation indicative of delight.\n\n\"Mind you, sonny, not a word of this,\" said Tuppence suddenly. \"I guess\nI oughtn't to have put you wise, but in the States we know a real smart\nlad when we see one.\"\n\n\"I'll not breathe a word,\" protested Albert eagerly. \"Ain't there\nanything I could do? A bit of shadowing, maybe, or such like?\"\n\nTuppence affected to consider, then shook her head.\n\n\"Not at the moment, but I'll bear you in mind, son. What's this about\nthe girl you say is leaving?\"\n\n\"Annie? Regular turn up, they 'ad. As Annie said, servants is some one\nnowadays, and to be treated accordingly, and, what with her passing the\nword round, she won't find it so easy to get another.\"\n\n\"Won't she?\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. \"I wonder----\"\n\nAn idea was dawning in her brain. She thought a minute or two, then\ntapped Albert on the shoulder.\n\n\"See here, son, my brain's got busy. How would it be if you mentioned\nthat you'd got a young cousin, or a friend of yours had, that might suit\nthe place. You get me?\"\n\n\"I'm there,\" said Albert instantly. \"You leave it to me, miss, and I'll\nfix the whole thing up in two ticks.\"\n\n\"Some lad!\" commented Tuppence, with a nod of approval. \"You might say\nthat the young woman could come in right away. You let me know, and if\nit's O.K. I'll be round to-morrow at eleven o'clock.\"\n\n\"Where am I to let you know to?\"\n\n\"Ritz,\" replied Tuppence laconically. \"Name of Cowley.\"\n\nAlbert eyed her enviously.\n\n\"It must be a good job, this tec business.\"\n\n\"It sure is,\" drawled Tuppence, \"especially when old man Rysdale backs\nthe bill. But don't fret, son. If this goes well, you shall come in on\nthe ground floor.\"\n\nWith which promise she took leave of her new ally, and walked briskly\naway from South Audley Mansions, well pleased with her morning's work.\n\nBut there was no time to be lost. She went straight back to the Ritz and\nwrote a few brief words to Mr. Carter. Having dispatched this, and Tommy\nnot having yet returned--which did not surprise her--she started off\non a shopping expedition which, with an interval for tea and assorted\ncreamy cakes, occupied her until well after six o'clock, and she\nreturned to the hotel jaded, but satisfied with her purchases. Starting\nwith a cheap clothing store, and passing through one or two second-hand\nestablishments, she had finished the day at a well-known hairdresser's.\nNow, in the seclusion of her bedroom, she unwrapped that final purchase.\nFive minutes later she smiled contentedly at her reflection in the\nglass. With an actress's pencil she had slightly altered the line of her\neyebrows, and that, taken in conjunction with the new luxuriant growth\nof fair hair above, so changed her appearance that she felt confident\nthat even if she came face to face with Whittington he would not\nrecognize her. She would wear elevators in her shoes, and the cap and\napron would be an even more valuable disguise. From hospital experience\nshe knew only too well that a nurse out of uniform is frequently\nunrecognized by her patients.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence aloud, nodding at the pert reflection in the glass,\n\"you'll do.\" She then resumed her normal appearance.\n\nDinner was a solitary meal. Tuppence was rather surprised at Tommy's\nnon-return. Julius, too, was absent--but that to the girl's mind was\nmore easily explained. His \"hustling\" activities were not confined\nto London, and his abrupt appearances and disappearances were fully\naccepted by the Young Adventurers as part of the day's work. It\nwas quite on the cards that Julius P. Hersheimmer had left for\nConstantinople at a moment's notice if he fancied that a clue to his\ncousin's disappearance was to be found there. The energetic young\nman had succeeded in making the lives of several Scotland Yard men\nunbearable to them, and the telephone girls at the Admiralty had learned\nto know and dread the familiar \"Hullo!\" He had spent three hours in\nParis hustling the Prefecture, and had returned from there imbued with\nthe idea, possibly inspired by a weary French official, that the true\nclue to the mystery was to be found in Ireland.\n\n\"I dare say he's dashed off there now,\" thought Tuppence. \"All very\nwell, but this is very dull for ME! Here I am bursting with news, and\nabsolutely no one to tell it to! Tommy might have wired, or something. I\nwonder where he is. Anyway, he can't have 'lost the trail' as they say.\nThat reminds me----\" And Miss Cowley broke off in her meditations, and\nsummoned a small boy.\n\nTen minutes later the lady was ensconced comfortably on her bed,\nsmoking cigarettes and deep in the perusal of Garnaby Williams, the Boy\nDetective, which, with other threepenny works of lurid fiction, she had\nsent out to purchase. She felt, and rightly, that before the strain\nof attempting further intercourse with Albert, it would be as well to\nfortify herself with a good supply of local colour.\n\nThe morning brought a note from Mr. Carter:\n\n\"DEAR MISS TUPPENCE,\n\n\"You have made a splendid start, and I congratulate you. I feel, though,\nthat I should like to point out to you once more the risks you are\nrunning, especially if you pursue the course you indicate. Those people\nare absolutely desperate and incapable of either mercy or pity. I feel\nthat you probably underestimate the danger, and therefore warn you\nagain that I can promise you no protection. You have given us valuable\ninformation, and if you choose to withdraw now no one could blame you.\nAt any rate, think the matter over well before you decide.\n\n\"If, in spite of my warnings, you make up your mind to go through with\nit, you will find everything arranged. You have lived for two years with\nMiss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly, and Mrs. Vandemeyer can apply to\nher for a reference.\n\n\"May I be permitted a word or two of advice? Stick as near to the truth\nas possible--it minimizes the danger of 'slips.' I suggest that you\nshould represent yourself to be what you are, a former V.A.D., who has\nchosen domestic service as a profession. There are many such at the\npresent time. That explains away any incongruities of voice or manner\nwhich otherwise might awaken suspicion.\n\n\"Whichever way you decide, good luck to you.\n\n\"Your sincere friend,\n\n\"MR. CARTER.\"\n\n\nTuppence's spirits rose mercurially. Mr. Carter's warnings passed\nunheeded. The young lady had far too much confidence in herself to pay\nany heed to them.\n\nWith some reluctance she abandoned the interesting part she had sketched\nout for herself. Although she had no doubts of her own powers to sustain\na role indefinitely, she had too much common sense not to recognize the\nforce of Mr. Carter's arguments.\n\nThere was still no word or message from Tommy, but the morning post\nbrought a somewhat dirty postcard with the words: \"It's O.K.\" scrawled\nupon it.\n\nAt ten-thirty Tuppence surveyed with pride a slightly battered tin trunk\ncontaining her new possessions. It was artistically corded. It was with\na slight blush that she rang the bell and ordered it to be placed in a\ntaxi. She drove to Paddington, and left the box in the cloak room.\nShe then repaired with a handbag to the fastnesses of the ladies'\nwaiting-room. Ten minutes later a metamorphosed Tuppence walked demurely\nout of the station and entered a bus.\n\nIt was a few minutes past eleven when Tuppence again entered the hall\nof South Audley Mansions. Albert was on the look-out, attending to his\nduties in a somewhat desultory fashion. He did not immediately recognize\nTuppence. When he did, his admiration was unbounded.\n\n\"Blest if I'd have known you! That rig-out's top-hole.\"\n\n\"Glad you like it, Albert,\" replied Tuppence modestly. \"By the way, am I\nyour cousin, or am I not?\"\n\n\"Your voice too,\" cried the delighted boy. \"It's as English as anything!\nNo, I said as a friend of mine knew a young gal. Annie wasn't best\npleased. She's stopped on till to-day--to oblige, SHE said, but really\nit's so as to put you against the place.\"\n\n\"Nice girl,\" said Tuppence.\n\nAlbert suspected no irony.\n\n\"She's style about her, and keeps her silver a treat--but, my word,\nain't she got a temper. Are you going up now, miss? Step inside the\nlift. No. 20 did you say?\" And he winked.\n\nTuppence quelled him with a stern glance, and stepped inside.\n\nAs she rang the bell of No. 20 she was conscious of Albert's eyes slowly\ndescending beneath the level of the floor.\n\nA smart young woman opened the door.\n\n\"I've come about the place,\" said Tuppence.\n\n\"It's a rotten place,\" said the young woman without hesitation. \"Regular\nold cat--always interfering. Accused me of tampering with her letters.\nMe! The flap was half undone anyway. There's never anything in the\nwaste-paper basket--she burns everything. She's a wrong 'un, that's what\nshe is. Swell clothes, but no class. Cook knows something about her--but\nshe won't tell--scared to death of her. And suspicious! She's on to you\nin a minute if you as much as speak to a fellow. I can tell you----\"\n\nBut what more Annie could tell, Tuppence was never destined to learn,\nfor at that moment a clear voice with a peculiarly steely ring to it\ncalled:\n\n\"Annie!\"\n\nThe smart young woman jumped as if she had been shot.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Who are you talking to?\"\n\n\"It's a young woman about the situation, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Show her in then. At once.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\nTuppence was ushered into a room on the right of the long passage. A\nwoman was standing by the fireplace. She was no longer in her first\nyouth, and the beauty she undeniably possessed was hardened and\ncoarsened. In her youth she must have been dazzling. Her pale gold hair,\nowing a slight assistance to art, was coiled low on her neck, her eyes,\nof a piercing electric blue, seemed to possess a faculty of boring into\nthe very soul of the person she was looking at. Her exquisite figure was\nenhanced by a wonderful gown of indigo charmeuse. And yet, despite her\nswaying grace, and the almost ethereal beauty of her face, you felt\ninstinctively the presence of something hard and menacing, a kind of\nmetallic strength that found expression in the tones of her voice and in\nthat gimlet-like quality of her eyes.\n\nFor the first time Tuppence felt afraid. She had not feared Whittington,\nbut this woman was different. As if fascinated, she watched the long\ncruel line of the red curving mouth, and again she felt that sensation\nof panic pass over her. Her usual self-confidence deserted her. Vaguely\nshe felt that deceiving this woman would be very different to deceiving\nWhittington. Mr. Carter's warning recurred to her mind. Here, indeed,\nshe might expect no mercy.\n\nFighting down that instinct of panic which urged her to turn tail and\nrun without further delay, Tuppence returned the lady's gaze firmly and\nrespectfully.\n\nAs though that first scrutiny had been satisfactory, Mrs. Vandemeyer\nmotioned to a chair.\n\n\"You can sit down. How did you hear I wanted a house-parlourmaid?\"\n\n\n\"Through a friend who knows the lift boy here. He thought the place\nmight suit me.\"\n\nAgain that basilisk glance seemed to pierce her through.\n\n\"You speak like an educated girl?\"\n\nGlibly enough, Tuppence ran through her imaginary career on the lines\nsuggested by Mr. Carter. It seemed to her, as she did so, that the\ntension of Mrs. Vandemeyer's attitude relaxed.\n\n\"I see,\" she remarked at length. \"Is there anyone I can write to for a\nreference?\"\n\n\"I lived last with a Miss Dufferin, The Parsonage, Llanelly. I was with\nher two years.\"\n\n\"And then you thought you would get more money by coming to London,\nI suppose? Well, it doesn't matter to me. I will give you\nL50--L60--whatever you want. You can come in at once?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am. To-day, if you like. My box is at Paddington.\"\n\n\"Go and fetch it in a taxi, then. It's an easy place. I am out a good\ndeal. By the way, what's your name?\"\n\n\"Prudence Cooper, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Very well, Prudence. Go away and fetch your box. I shall be out to\nlunch. The cook will show you where everything is.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am.\"\n\nTuppence withdrew. The smart Annie was not in evidence. In the hall\nbelow a magnificent hall porter had relegated Albert to the background.\nTuppence did not even glance at him as she passed meekly out.\n\nThe adventure had begun, but she felt less elated than she had done\nearlier in the morning. It crossed her mind that if the unknown Jane\nFinn had fallen into the hands of Mrs. Vandemeyer, it was likely to have\ngone hard with her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. ENTER SIR JAMES PEEL EDGERTON\n\nTUPPENCE betrayed no awkwardness in her new duties. The daughters of the\narchdeacon were well grounded in household tasks. They were also experts\nin training a \"raw girl,\" the inevitable result being that the raw girl,\nonce trained, departed elsewhere where her newly acquired knowledge\ncommanded a more substantial remuneration than the archdeacon's meagre\npurse allowed.\n\nTuppence had therefore very little fear of proving inefficient. Mrs.\nVandemeyer's cook puzzled her. She evidently went in deadly terror of\nher mistress. The girl thought it probable that the other woman had some\nhold over her. For the rest, she cooked like a chef, as Tuppence had\nan opportunity of judging that evening. Mrs. Vandemeyer was expecting a\nguest to dinner, and Tuppence accordingly laid the beautifully polished\ntable for two. She was a little exercised in her own mind as to this\nvisitor. It was highly possible that it might prove to be Whittington.\nAlthough she felt fairly confident that he would not recognize her, yet\nshe would have been better pleased had the guest proved to be a total\nstranger. However, there was nothing for it but to hope for the best.\n\nAt a few minutes past eight the front door bell rang, and Tuppence went\nto answer it with some inward trepidation. She was relieved to see that\nthe visitor was the second of the two men whom Tommy had taken upon\nhimself to follow.\n\nHe gave his name as Count Stepanov. Tuppence announced him, and Mrs.\nVandemeyer rose from her seat on a low divan with a quick murmur of\npleasure.\n\n\"It is delightful to see you, Boris Ivanovitch,\" she said.\n\n\"And you, madame!\" He bowed low over her hand.\n\nTuppence returned to the kitchen.\n\n\"Count Stepanov, or some such,\" she remarked, and affecting a frank and\nunvarnished curiosity: \"Who's he?\"\n\n\"A Russian gentleman, I believe.\"\n\n\"Come here much?\"\n\n\"Once in a while. What d'you want to know for?\"\n\n\"Fancied he might be sweet on the missus, that's all,\" explained the\ngirl, adding with an appearance of sulkiness: \"How you do take one up!\"\n\n\"I'm not quite easy in my mind about the souffle,\" explained the other.\n\n\"You know something,\" thought Tuppence to herself, but aloud she only\nsaid: \"Going to dish up now? Right-o.\"\n\nWhilst waiting at table, Tuppence listened closely to all that was said.\nShe remembered that this was one of the men Tommy was shadowing when she\nhad last seen him. Already, although she would hardly admit it, she was\nbecoming uneasy about her partner. Where was he? Why had no word of any\nkind come from him? She had arranged before leaving the Ritz to have\nall letters or messages sent on at once by special messenger to a small\nstationer's shop near at hand where Albert was to call in frequently.\nTrue, it was only yesterday morning that she had parted from Tommy, and\nshe told herself that any anxiety on his behalf would be absurd. Still,\nit was strange that he had sent no word of any kind.\n\nBut, listen as she might, the conversation presented no clue. Boris and\nMrs. Vandemeyer talked on purely indifferent subjects: plays they had\nseen, new dances, and the latest society gossip. After dinner they\nrepaired to the small boudoir where Mrs. Vandemeyer, stretched on the\ndivan, looked more wickedly beautiful than ever. Tuppence brought in the\ncoffee and liqueurs and unwillingly retired. As she did so, she heard\nBoris say:\n\n\"New, isn't she?\"\n\n\"She came in to-day. The other was a fiend. This girl seems all right.\nShe waits well.\"\n\nTuppence lingered a moment longer by the door which she had carefully\nneglected to close, and heard him say:\n\n\"Quite safe, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Really, Boris, you are absurdly suspicious. I believe she's the cousin\nof the hall porter, or something of the kind. And nobody even dreams\nthat I have any connection with our--mutual friend, Mr. Brown.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, be careful, Rita. That door isn't shut.\"\n\n\"Well, shut it then,\" laughed the woman.\n\nTuppence removed herself speedily.\n\nShe dared not absent herself longer from the back premises, but she\ncleared away and washed up with a breathless speed acquired in hospital.\nThen she slipped quietly back to the boudoir door. The cook, more\nleisurely, was still busy in the kitchen and, if she missed the other,\nwould only suppose her to be turning down the beds.\n\nAlas! The conversation inside was being carried on in too low a tone\nto permit of her hearing anything of it. She dared not reopen the\ndoor, however gently. Mrs. Vandemeyer was sitting almost facing it, and\nTuppence respected her mistress's lynx-eyed powers of observation.\n\nNevertheless, she felt she would give a good deal to overhear what was\ngoing on. Possibly, if anything unforeseen had happened, she might get\nnews of Tommy. For some moments she reflected desperately, then her\nface brightened. She went quickly along the passage to Mrs. Vandemeyer's\nbedroom, which had long French windows leading on to a balcony that ran\nthe length of the flat. Slipping quickly through the window, Tuppence\ncrept noiselessly along till she reached the boudoir window. As she\nhad thought it stood a little ajar, and the voices within were plainly\naudible.\n\nTuppence listened attentively, but there was no mention of anything\nthat could be twisted to apply to Tommy. Mrs. Vandemeyer and the Russian\nseemed to be at variance over some matter, and finally the latter\nexclaimed bitterly:\n\n\"With your persistent recklessness, you will end by ruining us!\"\n\n\"Bah!\" laughed the woman. \"Notoriety of the right kind is the best way\nof disarming suspicion. You will realize that one of these days--perhaps\nsooner than you think!\"\n\n\"In the meantime, you are going about everywhere with Peel Edgerton.\nNot only is he, perhaps, the most celebrated K.C. in England, but his\nspecial hobby is criminology! It is madness!\"\n\n\"I know that his eloquence has saved untold men from the gallows,\" said\nMrs. Vandemeyer calmly. \"What of it? I may need his assistance in that\nline myself some day. If so, how fortunate to have such a friend at\ncourt--or perhaps it would be more to the point to say IN court.\"\n\nBoris got up and began striding up and down. He was very excited.\n\n\"You are a clever woman, Rita; but you are also a fool! Be guided by me,\nand give up Peel Edgerton.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer shook her head gently.\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"You refuse?\" There was an ugly ring in the Russian's voice.\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Then, by Heaven,\" snarled the Russian, \"we will see----\" But Mrs.\nVandemeyer also rose to her feet, her eyes flashing.\n\n\"You forget, Boris,\" she said. \"I am accountable to no one. I take my\norders only from--Mr. Brown.\"\n\nThe other threw up his hands in despair.\n\n\"You are impossible,\" he muttered. \"Impossible! Already it may be too\nlate. They say Peel Edgerton can SMELL a criminal! How do we know what\nis at the bottom of his sudden interest in you? Perhaps even now his\nsuspicions are aroused. He guesses----\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer eyed him scornfully.\n\n\"Reassure yourself, my dear Boris. He suspects nothing. With less than\nyour usual chivalry, you seem to forget that I am commonly accounted a\nbeautiful woman. I assure you that is all that interests Peel Edgerton.\"\n\nBoris shook his head doubtfully.\n\n\"He has studied crime as no other man in this kingdom has studied it. Do\nyou fancy that you can deceive him?\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer's eyes narrowed.\n\n\"If he is all that you say--it would amuse me to try!\"\n\n\"Good heavens, Rita----\"\n\n\"Besides,\" added Mrs. Vandemeyer, \"he is extremely rich. I am not one\nwho despises money. The 'sinews of war,' you know, Boris!\"\n\n\"Money--money! That is always the danger with you, Rita. I believe you\nwould sell your soul for money. I believe----\" He paused, then in a\nlow, sinister voice he said slowly: \"Sometimes I believe that you would\nsell--us!\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer smiled and shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"The price, at any rate, would have to be enormous,\" she said lightly.\n\"It would be beyond the power of anyone but a millionaire to pay.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" snarled the Russian. \"You see, I was right!\"\n\n\"My dear Boris, can you not take a joke?\"\n\n\"Was it a joke?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Then all I can say is that your ideas of humour are peculiar, my dear\nRita.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer smiled.\n\n\"Let us not quarrel, Boris. Touch the bell. We will have some drinks.\"\n\nTuppence beat a hasty retreat. She paused a moment to survey herself in\nMrs. Vandemeyer's long glass, and be sure that nothing was amiss with\nher appearance. Then she answered the bell demurely.\n\nThe conversation that she had overheard, although interesting in that\nit proved beyond doubt the complicity of both Rita and Boris, threw very\nlittle light on the present preoccupations. The name of Jane Finn had\nnot even been mentioned.\n\nThe following morning a few brief words with Albert informed her that\nnothing was waiting for her at the stationer's. It seemed incredible\nthat Tommy, if all was well with him, should not send any word to her.\nA cold hand seemed to close round her heart.... Supposing... She choked\nher fears down bravely. It was no good worrying. But she leapt at a\nchance offered her by Mrs. Vandemeyer.\n\n\"What day do you usually go out, Prudence?\"\n\n\"Friday's my usual day, ma'am.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer lifted her eyebrows.\n\n\"And to-day is Friday! But I suppose you hardly wish to go out to-day,\nas you only came yesterday.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of asking you if I might, ma'am.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer looked at her a minute longer, and then smiled.\n\n\"I wish Count Stepanov could hear you. He made a suggestion about\nyou last night.\" Her smile broadened, catlike. \"Your request is\nvery--typical. I am satisfied. You do not understand all this--but\nyou can go out to-day. It makes no difference to me, as I shall not be\ndining at home.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am.\"\n\nTuppence felt a sensation of relief once she was out of the other's\npresence. Once again she admitted to herself that she was afraid,\nhorribly afraid, of the beautiful woman with the cruel eyes.\n\nIn the midst of a final desultory polishing of her silver, Tuppence was\ndisturbed by the ringing of the front door bell, and went to answer it.\nThis time the visitor was neither Whittington nor Boris, but a man of\nstriking appearance.\n\nJust a shade over average height, he nevertheless conveyed the\nimpression of a big man. His face, clean-shaven and exquisitely mobile,\nwas stamped with an expression of power and force far beyond the\nordinary. Magnetism seemed to radiate from him.\n\nTuppence was undecided for the moment whether to put him down as an\nactor or a lawyer, but her doubts were soon solved as he gave her his\nname: Sir James Peel Edgerton.\n\nShe looked at him with renewed interest. This, then, was the famous K.C.\nwhose name was familiar all over England. She had heard it said that he\nmight one day be Prime Minister. He was known to have refused office in\nthe interests of his profession, preferring to remain a simple Member\nfor a Scotch constituency.\n\nTuppence went back to her pantry thoughtfully. The great man had\nimpressed her. She understood Boris's agitation. Peel Edgerton would not\nbe an easy man to deceive.\n\nIn about a quarter of an hour the bell rang, and Tuppence repaired to\nthe hall to show the visitor out. He had given her a piercing glance\nbefore. Now, as she handed him his hat and stick, she was conscious of\nhis eyes raking her through. As she opened the door and stood aside to\nlet him pass out, he stopped in the doorway.\n\n\"Not been doing this long, eh?\"\n\nTuppence raised her eyes, astonished. She read in his glance kindliness,\nand something else more difficult to fathom.\n\nHe nodded as though she had answered.\n\n\"V.A.D. and hard up, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Did Mrs. Vandemeyer tell you that?\" asked Tuppence suspiciously.\n\n\"No, child. The look of you told me. Good place here?\"\n\n\"Very good, thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"Ah, but there are plenty of good places nowadays. And a change does no\nharm sometimes.\"\n\n\"Do you mean----?\" began Tuppence.\n\nBut Sir James was already on the topmost stair. He looked back with his\nkindly, shrewd glance.\n\n\"Just a hint,\" he said. \"That's all.\"\n\nTuppence went back to the pantry more thoughtful than ever.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. JULIUS TELLS A STORY\n\nDRESSED appropriately, Tuppence duly sallied forth for her \"afternoon\nout.\" Albert was in temporary abeyance, but Tuppence went herself to the\nstationer's to make quite sure that nothing had come for her. Satisfied\non this point, she made her way to the Ritz. On inquiry she learnt that\nTommy had not yet returned. It was the answer she had expected, but it\nwas another nail in the coffin of her hopes. She resolved to appeal to\nMr. Carter, telling him when and where Tommy had started on his quest,\nand asking him to do something to trace him. The prospect of his\naid revived her mercurial spirits, and she next inquired for Julius\nHersheimmer. The reply she got was to the effect that he had returned\nabout half an hour ago, but had gone out immediately.\n\nTuppence's spirits revived still more. It would be something to see\nJulius. Perhaps he could devise some plan for finding out what\nhad become of Tommy. She wrote her note to Mr. Carter in Julius's\nsitting-room, and was just addressing the envelope when the door burst\nopen.\n\n\"What the hell----\" began Julius, but checked himself abruptly. \"I beg\nyour pardon, Miss Tuppence. Those fools down at the office would have it\nthat Beresford wasn't here any longer--hadn't been here since Wednesday.\nIs that so?\"\n\nTuppence nodded.\n\n\"You don't know where he is?\" she asked faintly.\n\n\"I? How should I know? I haven't had one darned word from him, though I\nwired him yesterday morning.\"\n\n\"I expect your wire's at the office unopened.\"\n\n\"But where is he?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I hoped you might.\"\n\n\"I tell you I haven't had one darned word from him since we parted at\nthe depot on Wednesday.\"\n\n\"What depot?\"\n\n\"Waterloo. Your London and South Western road.\"\n\n\"Waterloo?\" frowned Tuppence.\n\n\"Why, yes. Didn't he tell you?\"\n\n\"I haven't seen him either,\" replied Tuppence impatiently. \"Go on about\nWaterloo. What were you doing there?\"\n\n\"He gave me a call. Over the phone. Told me to get a move on, and\nhustle. Said he was trailing two crooks.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence, her eyes opening. \"I see. Go on.\"\n\n\"I hurried along right away. Beresford was there. He pointed out the\ncrooks. The big one was mine, the guy you bluffed. Tommy shoved a ticket\ninto my hand and told me to get aboard the cars. He was going to sleuth\nthe other crook.\" Julius paused. \"I thought for sure you'd know all\nthis.\"\n\n\"Julius,\" said Tuppence firmly, \"stop walking up and down. It makes me\ngiddy. Sit down in that armchair, and tell me the whole story with as\nfew fancy turns of speech as possible.\"\n\nMr. Hersheimmer obeyed.\n\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"Where shall I begin?\"\n\n\"Where you left off. At Waterloo.\"\n\n\"Well,\" began Julius, \"I got into one of your dear old-fashioned\nfirst-class British compartments. The train was just off. First thing I\nknew a guard came along and informed me mighty politely that I wasn't\nin a smoking-carriage. I handed him out half a dollar, and that settled\nthat. I did a bit of prospecting along the corridor to the next coach.\nWhittington was there right enough. When I saw the skunk, with his big\nsleek fat face, and thought of poor little Jane in his clutches, I felt\nreal mad that I hadn't got a gun with me. I'd have tickled him up some.\n\n\"We got to Bournemouth all right. Whittington took a cab and gave the\nname of an hotel. I did likewise, and we drove up within three minutes\nof each other. He hired a room, and I hired one too. So far it was all\nplain sailing. He hadn't the remotest notion that anyone was on to him.\nWell, he just sat around in the hotel lounge, reading the papers and so\non, till it was time for dinner. He didn't hurry any over that either.\n\n\"I began to think that there was nothing doing, that he'd just come on\nthe trip for his health, but I remembered that he hadn't changed for\ndinner, though it was by way of being a slap-up hotel, so it seemed\nlikely enough that he'd be going out on his real business afterwards.\n\n\"Sure enough, about nine o'clock, so he did. Took a car across the\ntown--mighty pretty place by the way, I guess I'll take Jane there for\na spell when I find her--and then paid it off and struck out along those\npine-woods on the top of the cliff. I was there too, you understand.\nWe walked, maybe, for half an hour. There's a lot of villas all the way\nalong, but by degrees they seemed to get more and more thinned out, and\nin the end we got to one that seemed the last of the bunch. Big house it\nwas, with a lot of piny grounds around it.\n\n\"It was a pretty black night, and the carriage drive up to the house was\ndark as pitch. I could hear him ahead, though I couldn't see him. I\nhad to walk carefully in case he might get on to it that he was being\nfollowed. I turned a curve and I was just in time to see him ring the\nbell and get admitted to the house. I just stopped where I was. It was\nbeginning to rain, and I was soon pretty near soaked through. Also, it\nwas almighty cold.\n\n\"Whittington didn't come out again, and by and by I got kind of restive,\nand began to mouch around. All the ground floor windows were shuttered\ntight, but upstairs, on the first floor (it was a two-storied house) I\nnoticed a window with a light burning and the curtains not drawn.\n\n\"Now, just opposite to that window, there was a tree growing. It was\nabout thirty foot away from the house, maybe, and I sort of got it into\nmy head that, if I climbed up that tree, I'd very likely be able to see\ninto that room. Of course, I knew there was no reason why Whittington\nshould be in that room rather than in any other--less reason, in fact,\nfor the betting would be on his being in one of the reception-rooms\ndownstairs. But I guess I'd got the hump from standing so long in the\nrain, and anything seemed better than going on doing nothing. So I\nstarted up.\n\n\"It wasn't so easy, by a long chalk! The rain had made the boughs mighty\nslippery, and it was all I could do to keep a foothold, but bit by bit I\nmanaged it, until at last there I was level with the window.\n\n\"But then I was disappointed. I was too far to the left. I could only\nsee sideways into the room. A bit of curtain, and a yard of wallpaper\nwas all I could command. Well, that wasn't any manner of good to me, but\njust as I was going to give it up, and climb down ignominiously, some\none inside moved and threw his shadow on my little bit of wall--and, by\ngum, it was Whittington!\n\n\"After that, my blood was up. I'd just got to get a look into that\nroom. It was up to me to figure out how. I noticed that there was a long\nbranch running out from the tree in the right direction. If I could only\nswarm about half-way along it, the proposition would be solved. But it\nwas mighty uncertain whether it would bear my weight. I decided I'd\njust got to risk that, and I started. Very cautiously, inch by inch, I\ncrawled along. The bough creaked and swayed in a nasty fashion, and it\ndidn't do to think of the drop below, but at last I got safely to where\nI wanted to be.\n\n\"The room was medium-sized, furnished in a kind of bare hygienic way.\nThere was a table with a lamp on it in the middle of the room, and\nsitting at that table, facing towards me, was Whittington right enough.\nHe was talking to a woman dressed as a hospital nurse. She was sitting\nwith her back to me, so I couldn't see her face. Although the blinds\nwere up, the window itself was shut, so I couldn't catch a word of what\nthey said. Whittington seemed to be doing all the talking, and the nurse\njust listened. Now and then she nodded, and sometimes she'd shake\nher head, as though she were answering questions. He seemed very\nemphatic--once or twice he beat with his fist on the table. The rain had\nstopped now, and the sky was clearing in that sudden way it does.\n\n\"Presently, he seemed to get to the end of what he was saying. He got\nup, and so did she. He looked towards the window and asked something--I\nguess it was whether it was raining. Anyway, she came right across and\nlooked out. Just then the moon came out from behind the clouds. I\nwas scared the woman would catch sight of me, for I was full in the\nmoonlight. I tried to move back a bit. The jerk I gave was too much for\nthat rotten old branch. With an almighty crash, down it came, and Julius\nP. Hersheimmer with it!\"\n\n\"Oh, Julius,\" breathed Tuppence, \"how exciting! Go on.\"\n\n\"Well, luckily for me, I pitched down into a good soft bed of earth--but\nit put me out of action for the time, sure enough. The next thing I\nknew, I was lying in bed with a hospital nurse (not Whittington's one)\non one side of me, and a little black-bearded man with gold glasses,\nand medical man written all over him, on the other. He rubbed his hands\ntogether, and raised his eyebrows as I stared at him. 'Ah!' he said. 'So\nour young friend is coming round again. Capital. Capital.'\n\n\"I did the usual stunt. Said: 'What's happened?' And 'Where am I?' But\nI knew the answer to the last well enough. There's no moss growing on\nmy brain. 'I think that'll do for the present, sister,' said the little\nman, and the nurse left the room in a sort of brisk well-trained way.\nBut I caught her handing me out a look of deep curiosity as she passed\nthrough the door.\n\n\"That look of hers gave me an idea. 'Now then, doc,' I said, and tried\nto sit up in bed, but my right foot gave me a nasty twinge as I did so.\n'A slight sprain,' explained the doctor. 'Nothing serious. You'll be\nabout again in a couple of days.'\"\n\n\"I noticed you walked lame,\" interpolated Tuppence.\n\nJulius nodded, and continued:\n\n\"'How did it happen?' I asked again. He replied dryly. 'You fell, with\na considerable portion of one of my trees, into one of my newly planted\nflower-beds.'\n\n\"I liked the man. He seemed to have a sense of humour. I felt sure that\nhe, at least, was plumb straight. 'Sure, doc,' I said, 'I'm sorry about\nthe tree, and I guess the new bulbs will be on me. But perhaps you'd\nlike to know what I was doing in your garden?' 'I think the facts do\ncall for an explanation,' he replied. 'Well, to begin with, I wasn't\nafter the spoons.'\n\n\"He smiled. 'My first theory. But I soon altered my mind. By the way,\nyou are an American, are you not?' I told him my name. 'And you?' 'I am\nDr. Hall, and this, as you doubtless know, is my private nursing home.'\n\n\"I didn't know, but I wasn't going to put him wise. I was just thankful\nfor the information. I liked the man, and I felt he was straight, but\nI wasn't going to give him the whole story. For one thing he probably\nwouldn't have believed it.\n\n\"I made up my mind in a flash. 'Why, doctor,' I said, 'I guess I feel\nan almighty fool, but I owe it to you to let you know that it wasn't\nthe Bill Sikes business I was up to.' Then I went on and mumbled out\nsomething about a girl. I trotted out the stern guardian business, and a\nnervous breakdown, and finally explained that I had fancied I recognized\nher among the patients at the home, hence my nocturnal adventures. I\nguess it was just the kind of story he was expecting. 'Quite a romance,'\nhe said genially, when I'd finished. 'Now, doc,' I went on, 'will you\nbe frank with me? Have you here now, or have you had here at any time,\na young girl called Jane Finn?' He repeated the name thoughtfully. 'Jane\nFinn?' he said. 'No.'\n\n\"I was chagrined, and I guess I showed it. 'You are sure?' 'Quite sure,\nMr. Hersheimmer. It is an uncommon name, and I should not have been\nlikely to forget it.'\n\n\"Well, that was flat. It laid me out for a space. I'd kind of hoped\nmy search was at an end. 'That's that,' I said at last. 'Now, there's\nanother matter. When I was hugging that darned branch I thought I\nrecognized an old friend of mine talking to one of your nurses.' I\npurposely didn't mention any name because, of course, Whittington might\nbe calling himself something quite different down here, but the doctor\nanswered at once. 'Mr. Whittington, perhaps?' 'That's the fellow,' I\nreplied. 'What's he doing down here? Don't tell me HIS nerves are out of\norder?'\n\n\"Dr. Hall laughed. 'No. He came down to see one of my nurses, Nurse\nEdith, who is a niece of his.' 'Why, fancy that!' I exclaimed. 'Is he\nstill here?' 'No, he went back to town almost immediately.' 'What a\npity!' I ejaculated. 'But perhaps I could speak to his niece--Nurse\nEdith, did you say her name was?'\n\n\"But the doctor shook his head. 'I'm afraid that, too, is impossible.\nNurse Edith left with a patient to-night also.' 'I seem to be real\nunlucky,' I remarked. 'Have you Mr. Whittington's address in town?\nI guess I'd like to look him up when I get back.' 'I don't know his\naddress. I can write to Nurse Edith for it if you like.' I thanked him.\n'Don't say who it is wants it. I'd like to give him a little surprise.'\n\n\"That was about all I could do for the moment. Of course, if the girl\nwas really Whittington's niece, she might be too cute to fall into the\ntrap, but it was worth trying. Next thing I did was to write out a wire\nto Beresford saying where I was, and that I was laid up with a sprained\nfoot, and telling him to come down if he wasn't busy. I had to be\nguarded in what I said. However, I didn't hear from him, and my foot\nsoon got all right. It was only ricked, not really sprained, so to-day I\nsaid good-bye to the little doctor chap, asked him to send me word if\nhe heard from Nurse Edith, and came right away back to town. Say, Miss\nTuppence, you're looking mighty pale!\"\n\n\"It's Tommy,\" said Tuppence. \"What can have happened to him?\"\n\n\"Buck up, I guess he's all right really. Why shouldn't he be? See here,\nit was a foreign-looking guy he went off after. Maybe they've gone\nabroad--to Poland, or something like that?\"\n\nTuppence shook her head.\n\n\"He couldn't without passports and things. Besides I've seen that man,\nBoris Something, since. He dined with Mrs. Vandemeyer last night.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Who?\"\n\n\"I forgot. Of course you don't know all that.\"\n\n\"I'm listening,\" said Julius, and gave vent to his favourite expression.\n\"Put me wise.\"\n\nTuppence thereupon related the events of the last two days. Julius's\nastonishment and admiration were unbounded.\n\n\"Bully for you! Fancy you a menial. It just tickles me to death!\" Then\nhe added seriously: \"But say now, I don't like it, Miss Tuppence, I sure\ndon't. You're just as plucky as they make 'em, but I wish you'd keep\nright out of this. These crooks we're up against would as soon croak a\ngirl as a man any day.\"\n\n\"Do you think I'm afraid?\" said Tuppence indignantly, valiantly\nrepressing memories of the steely glitter in Mrs. Vandemeyer's eyes.\n\n\"I said before you were darned plucky. But that doesn't alter facts.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother ME!\" said Tuppence impatiently. \"Let's think about what can\nhave happened to Tommy. I've written to Mr. Carter about it,\" she added,\nand told him the gist of her letter.\n\nJulius nodded gravely.\n\n\"I guess that's good as far as it goes. But it's for us to get busy and\ndo something.\"\n\n\"What can we do?\" asked Tuppence, her spirits rising.\n\n\"I guess we'd better get on the track of Boris. You say he's been to\nyour place. Is he likely to come again?\"\n\n\"He might. I really don't know.\"\n\n\"I see. Well, I guess I'd better buy a car, a slap-up one, dress as a\nchauffeur and hang about outside. Then if Boris comes, you could make\nsome kind of signal, and I'd trail him. How's that?\"\n\n\"Splendid, but he mightn't come for weeks.\"\n\n\"We'll have to chance that. I'm glad you like the plan.\" He rose.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"To buy the car, of course,\" replied Julius, surprised. \"What make do\nyou like? I guess you'll do some riding in it before we've finished.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Tuppence faintly, \"I LIKE Rolls-Royces, but----\"\n\n\"Sure,\" agreed Julius. \"What you say goes. I'll get one.\"\n\n\"But you can't at once,\" cried Tuppence. \"People wait ages sometimes.\"\n\n\"Little Julius doesn't,\" affirmed Mr. Hersheimmer. \"Don't you worry any.\nI'll be round in the car in half an hour.\"\n\nTuppence got up.\n\n\"You're awfully good, Julius. But I can't help feeling that it's rather\na forlorn hope. I'm really pinning my faith to Mr. Carter.\"\n\n\"Then I shouldn't.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Just an idea of mine.\"\n\n\"Oh; but he must do something. There's no one else. By the way, I forgot\nto tell you of a queer thing that happened this morning.\"\n\nAnd she narrated her encounter with Sir James Peel Edgerton. Julius was\ninterested.\n\n\"What did the guy mean, do you think?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't quite know,\" said Tuppence meditatively. \"But I think that, in\nan ambiguous, legal, without prejudishish lawyer's way, he was trying to\nwarn me.\"\n\n\"Why should he?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" confessed Tuppence. \"But he looked kind, and\nsimply awfully clever. I wouldn't mind going to him and telling him\neverything.\"\n\nSomewhat to her surprise, Julius negatived the idea sharply.\n\n\"See here,\" he said, \"we don't want any lawyers mixed up in this. That\nguy couldn't help us any.\"\n\n\"Well, I believe he could,\" reiterated Tuppence obstinately.\n\n\"Don't you think it. So long. I'll be back in half an hour.\"\n\nThirty-five minutes had elapsed when Julius returned. He took Tuppence\nby the arm, and walked her to the window.\n\n\"There she is.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence with a note of reverence in her voice, as she gazed\ndown at the enormous car.\n\n\"She's some pace-maker, I can tell you,\" said Julius complacently.\n\n\"How did you get it?\" gasped Tuppence.\n\n\"She was just being sent home to some bigwig.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I went round to his house,\" said Julius. \"I said that I reckoned a car\nlike that was worth every penny of twenty thousand dollars. Then I told\nhim that it was worth just about fifty thousand dollars to me if he'd\nget out.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Tuppence, intoxicated.\n\n\"Well,\" returned Julius, \"he got out, that's all.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. A FRIEND IN NEED\n\nFRIDAY and Saturday passed uneventfully. Tuppence had received a brief\nanswer to her appeal from Mr. Carter. In it he pointed out that the\nYoung Adventurers had undertaken the work at their own risk, and had\nbeen fully warned of the dangers. If anything had happened to Tommy he\nregretted it deeply, but he could do nothing.\n\nThis was cold comfort. Somehow, without Tommy, all the savour went out\nof the adventure, and, for the first time, Tuppence felt doubtful of\nsuccess. While they had been together she had never questioned it for\na minute. Although she was accustomed to take the lead, and to pride\nherself on her quick-wittedness, in reality she had relied upon Tommy\nmore than she realized at the time. There was something so eminently\nsober and clear-headed about him, his common sense and soundness of\nvision were so unvarying, that without him Tuppence felt much like a\nrudderless ship. It was curious that Julius, who was undoubtedly much\ncleverer than Tommy, did not give her the same feeling of support. She\nhad accused Tommy of being a pessimist, and it is certain that he\nalways saw the disadvantages and difficulties which she herself was\noptimistically given to overlooking, but nevertheless she had really\nrelied a good deal on his judgment. He might be slow, but he was very\nsure.\n\nIt seemed to the girl that, for the first time, she realized the\nsinister character of the mission they had undertaken so lightheartedly.\nIt had begun like a page of romance. Now, shorn of its glamour, it\nseemed to be turning to grim reality. Tommy--that was all that mattered.\nMany times in the day Tuppence blinked the tears out of her eyes\nresolutely. \"Little fool,\" she would apostrophize herself, \"don't\nsnivel. Of course you're fond of him. You've known him all your life.\nBut there's no need to be sentimental about it.\"\n\nIn the meantime, nothing more was seen of Boris. He did not come to the\nflat, and Julius and the car waited in vain. Tuppence gave herself over\nto new meditations. Whilst admitting the truth of Julius's objections,\nshe had nevertheless not entirely relinquished the idea of appealing to\nSir James Peel Edgerton. Indeed, she had gone so far as to look up his\naddress in the Red Book. Had he meant to warn her that day? If so, why?\nSurely she was at least entitled to demand an explanation. He had looked\nat her so kindly. Perhaps he might tell them something concerning Mrs.\nVandemeyer which might lead to a clue to Tommy's whereabouts.\n\nAnyway, Tuppence decided, with her usual shake of the shoulders, it was\nworth trying, and try it she would. Sunday was her afternoon out. She\nwould meet Julius, persuade him to her point of view, and they would\nbeard the lion in his den.\n\nWhen the day arrived Julius needed a considerable amount of persuading,\nbut Tuppence held firm. \"It can do no harm,\" was what she always came\nback to. In the end Julius gave in, and they proceeded in the car to\nCarlton House Terrace.\n\nThe door was opened by an irreproachable butler. Tuppence felt a little\nnervous. After all, perhaps it WAS colossal cheek on her part. She\nhad decided not to ask if Sir James was \"at home,\" but to adopt a more\npersonal attitude.\n\n\"Will you ask Sir James if I can see him for a few minutes? I have an\nimportant message for him.\"\n\nThe butler retired, returning a moment or two later.\n\n\"Sir James will see you. Will you step this way?\"\n\nHe ushered them into a room at the back of the house, furnished as a\nlibrary. The collection of books was a magnificent one, and Tuppence\nnoticed that all one wall was devoted to works on crime and criminology.\nThere were several deep-padded leather arm-chairs, and an old-fashioned\nopen hearth. In the window was a big roll-top desk strewn with papers at\nwhich the master of the house was sitting.\n\nHe rose as they entered.\n\n\"You have a message for me? Ah\"--he recognized Tuppence with a\nsmile--\"it's you, is it? Brought a message from Mrs. Vandemeyer, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" said Tuppence. \"In fact, I'm afraid I only said that to\nbe quite sure of getting in. Oh, by the way, this is Mr. Hersheimmer,\nSir James Peel Edgerton.\"\n\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" said the American, shooting out a hand.\n\n\"Won't you both sit down?\" asked Sir James. He drew forward two chairs.\n\n\"Sir James,\" said Tuppence, plunging boldly, \"I dare say you will think\nit is most awful cheek of me coming here like this. Because, of course,\nit's nothing whatever to do with you, and then you're a very important\nperson, and of course Tommy and I are very unimportant.\" She paused for\nbreath.\n\n\"Tommy?\" queried Sir James, looking across at the American.\n\n\"No, that's Julius,\" explained Tuppence. \"I'm rather nervous, and that\nmakes me tell it badly. What I really want to know is what you meant by\nwhat you said to me the other day? Did you mean to warn me against Mrs.\nVandemeyer? You did, didn't you?\"\n\n\"My dear young lady, as far as I recollect I only mentioned that there\nwere equally good situations to be obtained elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. But it was a hint, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps it was,\" admitted Sir James gravely.\n\n\"Well, I want to know more. I want to know just WHY you gave me a hint.\"\n\nSir James smiled at her earnestness.\n\n\"Suppose the lady brings a libel action against me for defamation of\ncharacter?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Tuppence. \"I know lawyers are always dreadfully\ncareful. But can't we say 'without prejudice' first, and then say just\nwhat we want to.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Sir James, still smiling, \"without prejudice, then, if I\nhad a young sister forced to earn her living, I should not like to see\nher in Mrs. Vandemeyer's service. I felt it incumbent on me just to give\nyou a hint. It is no place for a young and inexperienced girl. That is\nall I can tell you.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. \"Thank you very much. But I'm not\nREALLY inexperienced, you know. I knew perfectly that she was a bad lot\nwhen I went there--as a matter of fact that's WHY I went----\" She broke\noff, seeing some bewilderment on the lawyer's face, and went on: \"I\nthink perhaps I'd better tell you the whole story, Sir James. I've a\nsort of feeling that you'd know in a minute if I didn't tell the truth,\nand so you might as well know all about it from the beginning. What do\nyou think, Julius?\"\n\n\"As you're bent on it, I'd go right ahead with the facts,\" replied the\nAmerican, who had so far sat in silence.\n\n\"Yes, tell me all about it,\" said Sir James. \"I want to know who Tommy\nis.\"\n\nThus encouraged Tuppence plunged into her tale, and the lawyer listened\nwith close attention.\n\n\"Very interesting,\" he said, when she finished. \"A great deal of what\nyou tell me, child, is already known to me. I've had certain theories\nof my own about this Jane Finn. You've done extraordinarily well so\nfar, but it's rather too bad of--what do you know him as?--Mr. Carter to\npitchfork you two young things into an affair of this kind. By the\nway, where did Mr. Hersheimmer come in originally? You didn't make that\nclear?\"\n\nJulius answered for himself.\n\n\"I'm Jane's first cousin,\" he explained, returning the lawyer's keen\ngaze.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Oh, Sir James,\" broke out Tuppence, \"what do you think has become of\nTommy?\"\n\n\"H'm.\" The lawyer rose, and paced slowly up and down. \"When you arrived,\nyoung lady, I was just packing up my traps. Going to Scotland by the\nnight train for a few days' fishing. But there are different kinds of\nfishing. I've a good mind to stay, and see if we can't get on the track\nof that young chap.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Tuppence clasped her hands ecstatically.\n\n\"All the same, as I said before, it's too bad of--of Carter to set you\ntwo babies on a job like this. Now, don't get offended, Miss--er----\"\n\n\"Cowley. Prudence Cowley. But my friends call me Tuppence.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Tuppence, then, as I'm certainly going to be a friend. Don't\nbe offended because I think you're young. Youth is a failing only too\neasily outgrown. Now, about this young Tommy of yours----\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Tuppence clasped her hands.\n\n\"Frankly, things look bad for him. He's been butting in somewhere where\nhe wasn't wanted. Not a doubt of it. But don't give up hope.\"\n\n\"And you really will help us? There, Julius! He didn't want me to come,\"\nshe added by way of explanation.\n\n\"H'm,\" said the lawyer, favouring Julius with another keen glance. \"And\nwhy was that?\"\n\n\"I reckoned it would be no good worrying you with a petty little\nbusiness like this.\"\n\n\"I see.\" He paused a moment. \"This petty little business, as you call\nit, bears directly on a very big business, bigger perhaps than either\nyou or Miss Tuppence know. If this boy is alive, he may have very\nvaluable information to give us. Therefore, we must find him.\"\n\n\"Yes, but how?\" cried Tuppence. \"I've tried to think of everything.\"\n\nSir James smiled.\n\n\"And yet there's one person quite near at hand who in all probability\nknows where he is, or at all events where he is likely to be.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\" asked Tuppence, puzzled.\n\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer.\"\n\n\"Yes, but she'd never tell us.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is where I come in. I think it quite likely that I shall be\nable to make Mrs. Vandemeyer tell me what I want to know.\"\n\n\"How?\" demanded Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide.\n\n\"Oh, just by asking her questions,\" replied Sir James easily. \"That's\nthe way we do it, you know.\"\n\nHe tapped with his finger on the table, and Tuppence felt again the\nintense power that radiated from the man.\n\n\"And if she won't tell?\" asked Julius suddenly.\n\n\"I think she will. I have one or two powerful levers. Still, in that\nunlikely event, there is always the possibility of bribery.\"\n\n\"Sure. And that's where I come in!\" cried Julius, bringing his fist down\non the table with a bang. \"You can count on me, if necessary, for one\nmillion dollars. Yes, sir, one million dollars!\"\n\nSir James sat down and subjected Julius to a long scrutiny.\n\n\"Mr. Hersheimmer,\" he said at last, \"that is a very large sum.\"\n\n\"I guess it'll have to be. These aren't the kind of folk to offer\nsixpence to.\"\n\n\"At the present rate of exchange it amounts to considerably over two\nhundred and fifty thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"That's so. Maybe you think I'm talking through my hat, but I can\ndeliver the goods all right, with enough over to spare for your fee.\"\n\nSir James flushed slightly.\n\n\"There is no question of a fee, Mr. Hersheimmer. I am not a private\ndetective.\"\n\n\"Sorry. I guess I was just a mite hasty, but I've been feeling bad about\nthis money question. I wanted to offer a big reward for news of Jane\nsome days ago, but your crusted institution of Scotland Yard advised me\nagainst it. Said it was undesirable.\"\n\n\"They were probably right,\" said Sir James dryly.\n\n\"But it's all O.K. about Julius,\" put in Tuppence. \"He's not pulling\nyour leg. He's got simply pots of money.\"\n\n\"The old man piled it up in style,\" explained Julius. \"Now, let's get\ndown to it. What's your idea?\"\n\nSir James considered for a moment or two.\n\n\"There is no time to be lost. The sooner we strike the better.\" He\nturned to Tuppence. \"Is Mrs. Vandemeyer dining out to-night, do you\nknow?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so, but she will not be out late. Otherwise, she would\nhave taken the latchkey.\"\n\n\"Good. I will call upon her about ten o'clock. What time are you\nsupposed to return?\"\n\n\"About nine-thirty or ten, but I could go back earlier.\"\n\n\"You must not do that on any account. It might arouse suspicion if you\ndid not stay out till the usual time. Be back by nine-thirty. I will\narrive at ten. Mr. Hersheimmer will wait below in a taxi perhaps.\"\n\n\"He's got a new Rolls-Royce car,\" said Tuppence with vicarious pride.\n\n\"Even better. If I succeed in obtaining the address from her, we can\ngo there at once, taking Mrs. Vandemeyer with us if necessary. You\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Tuppence rose to her feet with a skip of delight. \"Oh, I feel so\nmuch better!\"\n\n\"Don't build on it too much, Miss Tuppence. Go easy.\"\n\nJulius turned to the lawyer.\n\n\"Say, then. I'll call for you in the car round about nine-thirty. Is\nthat right?\"\n\n\"Perhaps that will be the best plan. It would be unnecessary to have two\ncars waiting about. Now, Miss Tuppence, my advice to you is to go and\nhave a good dinner, a REALLY good one, mind. And don't think ahead more\nthan you can help.\"\n\nHe shook hands with them both, and a moment later they were outside.\n\n\"Isn't he a duck?\" inquired Tuppence ecstatically, as she skipped down\nthe steps. \"Oh, Julius, isn't he just a duck?\"\n\n\"Well, I allow he seems to be the goods all right. And I was wrong about\nits being useless to go to him. Say, shall we go right away back to the\nRitz?\"\n\n\"I must walk a bit, I think. I feel so excited. Drop me in the park,\nwill you? Unless you'd like to come too?\"\n\n\"I want to get some petrol,\" he explained. \"And send off a cable or\ntwo.\"\n\n\"All right. I'll meet you at the Ritz at seven. We'll have to dine\nupstairs. I can't show myself in these glad rags.\"\n\n\"Sure. I'll get Felix help me choose the menu. He's some head waiter,\nthat. So long.\"\n\nTuppence walked briskly along towards the Serpentine, first glancing at\nher watch. It was nearly six o'clock. She remembered that she had had no\ntea, but felt too excited to be conscious of hunger. She walked as\nfar as Kensington Gardens and then slowly retraced her steps, feeling\ninfinitely better for the fresh air and exercise. It was not so easy to\nfollow Sir James's advice, and put the possible events of the evening\nout of her head. As she drew nearer and nearer to Hyde Park corner, the\ntemptation to return to South Audley Mansions was almost irresistible.\n\nAt any rate, she decided, it would do no harm just to go and LOOK at the\nbuilding. Perhaps, then, she could resign herself to waiting patiently\nfor ten o'clock.\n\nSouth Audley Mansions looked exactly the same as usual. What Tuppence\nhad expected she hardly knew, but the sight of its red brick stolidity\nslightly assuaged the growing and entirely unreasonable uneasiness\nthat possessed her. She was just turning away when she heard a piercing\nwhistle, and the faithful Albert came running from the building to join\nher.\n\nTuppence frowned. It was no part of the programme to have attention\ncalled to her presence in the neighbourhood, but Albert was purple with\nsuppressed excitement.\n\n\"I say, miss, she's a-going!\"\n\n\"Who's going?\" demanded Tuppence sharply.\n\n\"The crook. Ready Rita. Mrs. Vandemeyer. She's a-packing up, and she's\njust sent down word for me to get her a taxi.\"\n\n\"What?\" Tuppence clutched his arm.\n\n\"It's the truth, miss. I thought maybe as you didn't know about it.\"\n\n\"Albert,\" cried Tuppence, \"you're a brick. If it hadn't been for you\nwe'd have lost her.\"\n\nAlbert flushed with pleasure at this tribute.\n\n\"There's no time to lose,\" said Tuppence, crossing the road. \"I've got\nto stop her. At all costs I must keep her here until----\" She broke off.\n\"Albert, there's a telephone here, isn't there?\"\n\nThe boy shook his head.\n\n\"The flats mostly have their own, miss. But there's a box just round the\ncorner.\"\n\n\"Go to it then, at once, and ring up the Ritz Hotel. Ask for Mr.\nHersheimmer, and when you get him tell him to get Sir James and come on\nat once, as Mrs. Vandemeyer is trying to hook it. If you can't get him,\nring up Sir James Peel Edgerton, you'll find his number in the book, and\ntell him what's happening. You won't forget the names, will you?\"\n\nAlbert repeated them glibly. \"You trust to me, miss, it'll be all right.\nBut what about you? Aren't you afraid to trust yourself with her?\"\n\n\"No, no, that's all right. BUT GO AND TELEPHONE. Be quick.\"\n\nDrawing a long breath, Tuppence entered the Mansions and ran up to the\ndoor of No. 20. How she was to detain Mrs. Vandemeyer until the two men\narrived, she did not know, but somehow or other it had to be done, and\nshe must accomplish the task single-handed. What had occasioned this\nprecipitate departure? Did Mrs. Vandemeyer suspect her?\n\nSpeculations were idle. Tuppence pressed the bell firmly. She might\nlearn something from the cook.\n\nNothing happened and, after waiting some minutes, Tuppence pressed the\nbell again, keeping her finger on the button for some little while.\nAt last she heard footsteps inside, and a moment later Mrs. Vandemeyer\nherself opened the door. She lifted her eyebrows at the sight of the\ngirl.\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"I had a touch of toothache, ma'am,\" said Tuppence glibly. \"So thought\nit better to come home and have a quiet evening.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer said nothing, but she drew back and let Tuppence pass\ninto the hall.\n\n\"How unfortunate for you,\" she said coldly. \"You had better go to bed.\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall be all right in the kitchen, ma'am. Cook will----\"\n\n\"Cook is out,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer, in a rather disagreeable tone. \"I\nsent her out. So you see you had better go to bed.\"\n\nSuddenly Tuppence felt afraid. There was a ring in Mrs. Vandemeyer's\nvoice that she did not like at all. Also, the other woman was slowly\nedging her up the passage. Tuppence turned at bay.\n\n\"I don't want----\"\n\nThen, in a flash, a rim of cold steel touched her temple, and Mrs.\nVandemeyer's voice rose cold and menacing:\n\n\"You damned little fool! Do you think I don't know? No, don't answer. If\nyou struggle or cry out, I'll shoot you like a dog.\"\n\nThe rim of steel pressed a little harder against the girl's temple.\n\n\"Now then, march,\" went on Mrs. Vandemeyer. \"This way--into my room. In\na minute, when I've done with you, you'll go to bed as I told you to.\nAnd you'll sleep--oh yes, my little spy, you'll sleep all right!\"\n\nThere was a sort of hideous geniality in the last words which Tuppence\ndid not at all like. For the moment there was nothing to be done, and\nshe walked obediently into Mrs. Vandemeyer's bedroom. The pistol never\nleft her forehead. The room was in a state of wild disorder, clothes\nwere flung about right and left, a suit-case and a hat box, half-packed,\nstood in the middle of the floor.\n\nTuppence pulled herself together with an effort. Her voice shook a\nlittle, but she spoke out bravely.\n\n\"Come now,\" she said. \"This is nonsense. You can't shoot me. Why, every\none in the building would hear the report.\"\n\n\"I'd risk that,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer cheerfully. \"But, as long as you\ndon't sing out for help, you're all right--and I don't think you will.\nYou're a clever girl. You deceived ME all right. I hadn't a suspicion\nof you! So I've no doubt that you understand perfectly well that this\nis where I'm on top and you're underneath. Now then--sit on the bed. Put\nyour hands above your head, and if you value your life don't move them.\"\n\nTuppence obeyed passively. Her good sense told her that there was\nnothing else to do but accept the situation. If she shrieked for help\nthere was very little chance of anyone hearing her, whereas there was\nprobably quite a good chance of Mrs. Vandemeyer's shooting her. In the\nmeantime, every minute of delay gained was valuable.\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer laid down the revolver on the edge of the washstand\nwithin reach of her hand, and, still eyeing Tuppence like a lynx in case\nthe girl should attempt to move, she took a little stoppered bottle from\nits place on the marble and poured some of its contents into a glass\nwhich she filled up with water.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Tuppence sharply.\n\n\"Something to make you sleep soundly.\"\n\nTuppence paled a little.\n\n\"Are you going to poison me?\" she asked in a whisper.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer, smiling agreeably.\n\n\"Then I shan't drink it,\" said Tuppence firmly. \"I'd much rather be\nshot. At any rate that would make a row, and some one might hear it. But\nI won't be killed off quietly like a lamb.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer stamped her foot.\n\n\"Don't be a little fool! Do you really think I want a hue and cry for\nmurder out after me? If you've any sense at all, you'll realize that\npoisoning you wouldn't suit my book at all. It's a sleeping draught,\nthat's all. You'll wake up to-morrow morning none the worse. I simply\ndon't want the bother of tying you up and gagging you. That's the\nalternative--and you won't like it, I can tell you! I can be very rough\nif I choose. So drink this down like a good girl, and you'll be none the\nworse for it.\"\n\nIn her heart of hearts Tuppence believed her. The arguments she had\nadduced rang true. It was a simple and effective method of getting her\nout of the way for the time being. Nevertheless, the girl did not take\nkindly to the idea of being tamely put to sleep without as much as one\nbid for freedom. She felt that once Mrs. Vandemeyer gave them the slip,\nthe last hope of finding Tommy would be gone.\n\nTuppence was quick in her mental processes. All these reflections\npassed through her mind in a flash, and she saw where a chance, a very\nproblematical chance, lay, and she determined to risk all in one supreme\neffort.\n\nAccordingly, she lurched suddenly off the bed and fell on her knees\nbefore Mrs. Vandemeyer, clutching her skirts frantically.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" she moaned. \"It's poison--I know it's poison.\nOh, don't make me drink it\"--her voice rose to a shriek--\"don't make me\ndrink it!\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer, glass in hand, looked down with a curling lip at this\nsudden collapse.\n\n\"Get up, you little idiot! Don't go on drivelling there. How you ever\nhad the nerve to play your part as you did I can't think.\" She stamped\nher foot. \"Get up, I say.\"\n\nBut Tuppence continued to cling and sob, interjecting her sobs with\nincoherent appeals for mercy. Every minute gained was to the good.\nMoreover, as she grovelled, she moved imperceptibly nearer to her\nobjective.\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer gave a sharp impatient exclamation, and jerked the girl\nto her knees.\n\n\"Drink it at once!\" Imperiously she pressed the glass to the girl's\nlips.\n\nTuppence gave one last despairing moan.\n\n\"You swear it won't hurt me?\" she temporized.\n\n\"Of course it won't hurt you. Don't be a fool.\"\n\n\"Will you swear it?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the other impatiently. \"I swear it.\"\n\nTuppence raised a trembling left hand to the glass.\n\n\"Very well.\" Her mouth opened meekly.\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer gave a sigh of relief, off her guard for the moment.\nThen, quick as a flash, Tuppence jerked the glass upward as hard as she\ncould. The fluid in it splashed into Mrs. Vandemeyer's face, and during\nher momentary gasp, Tuppence's right hand shot out and grasped the\nrevolver where it lay on the edge of the washstand. The next moment\nshe had sprung back a pace, and the revolver pointed straight at Mrs.\nVandemeyer's heart, with no unsteadiness in the hand that held it.\n\nIn the moment of victory, Tuppence betrayed a somewhat unsportsmanlike\ntriumph.\n\n\"Now who's on top and who's underneath?\" she crowed.\n\nThe other's face was convulsed with rage. For a minute Tuppence thought\nshe was going to spring upon her, which would have placed the girl in an\nunpleasant dilemma, since she meant to draw the line at actually letting\noff the revolver. However, with an effort Mrs. Vandemeyer controlled\nherself, and at last a slow evil smile crept over her face.\n\n\"Not a fool, then, after all! You did that well, girl. But you shall pay\nfor it--oh, yes, you shall pay for it! I have a long memory!\"\n\n\"I'm surprised you should have been gulled so easily,\" said Tuppence\nscornfully. \"Did you really think I was the kind of girl to roll about\non the floor and whine for mercy?\"\n\n\"You may do--some day!\" said the other significantly.\n\nThe cold malignity of her manner sent an unpleasant chill down\nTuppence's spine, but she was not going to give in to it.\n\n\"Supposing we sit down,\" she said pleasantly. \"Our present attitude is\na little melodramatic. No--not on the bed. Draw a chair up to the table,\nthat's right. Now I'll sit opposite you with the revolver in front of\nme--just in case of accidents. Splendid. Now, let's talk.\"\n\n\"What about?\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer sullenly.\n\nTuppence eyed her thoughtfully for a minute. She was remembering several\nthings. Boris's words, \"I believe you would sell--us!\" and her answer,\n\"The price would have to be enormous,\" given lightly, it was true,\nyet might not there be a substratum of truth in it? Long ago, had not\nWhittington asked: \"Who's been blabbing? Rita?\" Would Rita Vandemeyer\nprove to be the weak spot in the armour of Mr. Brown?\n\nKeeping her eyes fixed steadily on the other's face, Tuppence replied\nquietly:\n\n\"Money----\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer started. Clearly, the reply was unexpected.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you. You said just now that you had a long memory. A long\nmemory isn't half as useful as a long purse! I dare say it relieves your\nfeelings a good deal to plan out all sorts of dreadful things to do to\nme, but is that PRACTICAL? Revenge is very unsatisfactory. Every one\nalways says so. But money\"--Tuppence warmed to her pet creed--\"well,\nthere's nothing unsatisfactory about money, is there?\"\n\n\"Do you think,\" said Mrs. Vandemeyer scornfully, \"that I am the kind of\nwoman to sell my friends?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence promptly. \"If the price was big enough.\"\n\n\"A paltry hundred pounds or so!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Tuppence. \"I should suggest--a hundred thousand!\"\n\nHer economical spirit did not permit her to mention the whole million\ndollars suggested by Julius.\n\nA flush crept over Mrs. Vandemeyer's face.\n\n\"What did you say?\" she asked, her fingers playing nervously with a\nbrooch on her breast. In that moment Tuppence knew that the fish was\nhooked, and for the first time she felt a horror of her own money-loving\nspirit. It gave her a dreadful sense of kinship to the woman fronting\nher.\n\n\"A hundred thousand pounds,\" repeated Tuppence.\n\nThe light died out of Mrs. Vandemeyer's eyes. She leaned back in her\nchair.\n\n\"Bah!\" she said. \"You haven't got it.\"\n\n\"No,\" admitted Tuppence, \"I haven't--but I know some one who has.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"A friend of mine.\"\n\n\"Must be a millionaire,\" remarked Mrs. Vandemeyer unbelievingly.\n\n\"As a matter of fact he is. He's an American. He'll pay you that\nwithout a murmur. You can take it from me that it's a perfectly genuine\nproposition.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer sat up again.\n\n\"I'm inclined to believe you,\" she said slowly.\n\nThere was silence between them for some time, then Mrs. Vandemeyer\nlooked up.\n\n\"What does he want to know, this friend of yours?\"\n\nTuppence went through a momentary struggle, but it was Julius's money,\nand his interests must come first.\n\n\"He wants to know where Jane Finn is,\" she said boldly.\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer showed no surprise.\n\n\"I'm not sure where she is at the present moment,\" she replied.\n\n\"But you could find out?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" returned Mrs. Vandemeyer carelessly. \"There would be no\ndifficulty about that.\"\n\n\"Then\"--Tuppence's voice shook a little--\"there's a boy, a friend of\nmine. I'm afraid something's happened to him, through your pal Boris.\"\n\n\"What's his name?\"\n\n\"Tommy Beresford.\"\n\n\"Never heard of him. But I'll ask Boris. He'll tell me anything he\nknows.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" Tuppence felt a terrific rise in her spirits. It impelled\nher to more audacious efforts. \"There's one thing more.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nTuppence leaned forward and lowered her voice.\n\n\"WHO IS MR. BROWN?\"\n\nHer quick eyes saw the sudden paling of the beautiful face. With an\neffort Mrs. Vandemeyer pulled herself together and tried to resume her\nformer manner. But the attempt was a mere parody.\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"You can't have learnt much about us if you don't know that NOBODY KNOWS\nWHO MR. BROWN IS....\"\n\n\"You do,\" said Tuppence quietly.\n\nAgain the colour deserted the other's face.\n\n\"What makes you think that?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the girl truthfully. \"But I'm sure.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer stared in front of her for a long time.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said hoarsely, at last, \"I know. I was beautiful, you\nsee--very beautiful--\"\n\n\"You are still,\" said Tuppence with admiration.\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer shook her head. There was a strange gleam in her\nelectric-blue eyes.\n\n\"Not beautiful enough,\" she said in a soft dangerous voice.\n\"Not--beautiful--enough! And sometimes, lately, I've been afraid....\nIt's dangerous to know too much!\" She leaned forward across the table.\n\"Swear that my name shan't be brought into it--that no one shall ever\nknow.\"\n\n\"I swear it. And, once's he caught, you'll be out of danger.\"\n\nA terrified look swept across Mrs. Vandemeyer's face.\n\n\"Shall I? Shall I ever be?\" She clutched Tuppence's arm. \"You're sure\nabout the money?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"When shall I have it? There must be no delay.\"\n\n\"This friend of mine will be here presently. He may have to send cables,\nor something like that. But there won't be any delay--he's a terrific\nhustler.\"\n\nA resolute look settled on Mrs. Vandemeyer's face.\n\n\"I'll do it. It's a great sum of money, and besides\"--she gave a curious\nsmile--\"it is not--wise to throw over a woman like me!\"\n\nFor a moment or two, she remained smiling, and lightly tapping her\nfingers on the table. Suddenly she started, and her face blanched.\n\n\"What was that?\"\n\n\"I heard nothing.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer gazed round her fearfully.\n\n\"If there should be some one listening----\"\n\n\"Nonsense. Who could there be?\"\n\n\"Even the walls might have ears,\" whispered the other. \"I tell you I'm\nfrightened. You don't know him!\"\n\n\"Think of the hundred thousand pounds,\" said Tuppence soothingly.\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer passed her tongue over her dried lips.\n\n\"You don't know him,\" she reiterated hoarsely. \"He's--ah!\"\n\nWith a shriek of terror she sprang to her feet. Her outstretched hand\npointed over Tuppence's head. Then she swayed to the ground in a dead\nfaint.\n\nTuppence looked round to see what had startled her.\n\nIn the doorway were Sir James Peel Edgerton and Julius Hersheimmer.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. THE VIGIL\n\nSIR James brushed past Julius and hurriedly bent over the fallen woman.\n\n\"Heart,\" he said sharply. \"Seeing us so suddenly must have given her a\nshock. Brandy--and quickly, or she'll slip through our fingers.\"\n\nJulius hurried to the washstand.\n\n\"Not there,\" said Tuppence over her shoulder. \"In the tantalus in the\ndining-room. Second door down the passage.\"\n\nBetween them Sir James and Tuppence lifted Mrs. Vandemeyer and carried\nher to the bed. There they dashed water on her face, but with no result.\nThe lawyer fingered her pulse.\n\n\"Touch and go,\" he muttered. \"I wish that young fellow would hurry up\nwith the brandy.\"\n\nAt that moment Julius re-entered the room, carrying a glass half full of\nthe spirit which he handed to Sir James. While Tuppence lifted her head\nthe lawyer tried to force a little of the spirit between her closed\nlips. Finally the woman opened her eyes feebly. Tuppence held the glass\nto her lips.\n\n\"Drink this.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer complied. The brandy brought the colour back to her\nwhite cheeks, and revived her in a marvellous fashion. She tried to sit\nup--then fell back with a groan, her hand to her side.\n\n\"It's my heart,\" she whispered. \"I mustn't talk.\"\n\nShe lay back with closed eyes.\n\nSir James kept his finger on her wrist a minute longer, then withdrew it\nwith a nod.\n\n\"She'll do now.\"\n\nAll three moved away, and stood together talking in low voices. One\nand all were conscious of a certain feeling of anticlimax. Clearly any\nscheme for cross-questioning the lady was out of the question for the\nmoment. For the time being they were baffled, and could do nothing.\n\nTuppence related how Mrs. Vandemeyer had declared herself willing\nto disclose the identity of Mr. Brown, and how she had consented to\ndiscover and reveal to them the whereabouts of Jane Finn. Julius was\ncongratulatory.\n\n\"That's all right, Miss Tuppence. Splendid! I guess that hundred\nthousand pounds will look just as good in the morning to the lady as it\ndid over night. There's nothing to worry over. She won't speak without\nthe cash anyway, you bet!\"\n\nThere was certainly a good deal of common sense in this, and Tuppence\nfelt a little comforted.\n\n\"What you say is true,\" said Sir James meditatively. \"I must confess,\nhowever, that I cannot help wishing we had not interrupted at the minute\nwe did. Still, it cannot be helped, it is only a matter of waiting until\nthe morning.\"\n\nHe looked across at the inert figure on the bed. Mrs. Vandemeyer lay\nperfectly passive with closed eyes. He shook his head.\n\n\"Well,\" said Tuppence, with an attempt at cheerfulness, \"we must wait\nuntil the morning, that's all. But I don't think we ought to leave the\nflat.\"\n\n\"What about leaving that bright boy of yours on guard?\"\n\n\"Albert? And suppose she came round again and hooked it. Albert couldn't\nstop her.\"\n\n\"I guess she won't want to make tracks away from the dollars.\"\n\n\"She might. She seemed very frightened of 'Mr. Brown.'\"\n\n\"What? Real plumb scared of him?\"\n\n\"Yes. She looked round and said even walls had ears.\"\n\n\"Maybe she meant a dictaphone,\" said Julius with interest.\n\n\"Miss Tuppence is right,\" said Sir James quietly. \"We must not leave the\nflat--if only for Mrs. Vandemeyer's sake.\"\n\nJulius stared at him.\n\n\"You think he'd get after her? Between now and to-morrow morning. How\ncould he know, even?\"\n\n\"You forget your own suggestion of a dictaphone,\" said Sir James dryly.\n\"We have a very formidable adversary. I believe, if we exercise all due\ncare, that there is a very good chance of his being delivered into our\nhands. But we must neglect no precaution. We have an important witness,\nbut she must be safeguarded. I would suggest that Miss Tuppence should\ngo to bed, and that you and I, Mr. Hersheimmer, should share the vigil.\"\n\nTuppence was about to protest, but happening to glance at the bed she\nsaw Mrs. Vandemeyer, her eyes half-open, with such an expression of\nmingled fear and malevolence on her face that it quite froze the words\non her lips.\n\nFor a moment she wondered whether the faint and the heart attack had\nbeen a gigantic sham, but remembering the deadly pallor she could hardly\ncredit the supposition. As she looked the expression disappeared as by\nmagic, and Mrs. Vandemeyer lay inert and motionless as before. For a\nmoment the girl fancied she must have dreamt it. But she determined\nnevertheless to be on the alert.\n\n\"Well,\" said Julius, \"I guess we'd better make a move out of here any\nway.\"\n\nThe others fell in with his suggestion. Sir James again felt Mrs.\nVandemeyer's pulse.\n\n\"Perfectly satisfactory,\" he said in a low voice to Tuppence. \"She'll be\nabsolutely all right after a night's rest.\"\n\nThe girl hesitated a moment by the bed. The intensity of the expression\nshe had surprised had impressed her powerfully. Mrs. Vandemeyer lifted\nher lids. She seemed to be struggling to speak. Tuppence bent over her.\n\n\"Don't--leave----\" she seemed unable to proceed, murmuring something\nthat sounded like \"sleepy.\" Then she tried again.\n\nTuppence bent lower still. It was only a breath.\n\n\"Mr.--Brown----\" The voice stopped.\n\nBut the half-closed eyes seemed still to send an agonized message.\n\nMoved by a sudden impulse, the girl said quickly:\n\n\"I shan't leave the flat. I shall sit up all night.\"\n\nA flash of relief showed before the lids descended once more. Apparently\nMrs. Vandemeyer slept. But her words had awakened a new uneasiness in\nTuppence. What had she meant by that low murmur: \"Mr. Brown?\" Tuppence\ncaught herself nervously looking over her shoulder. The big wardrobe\nloomed up in a sinister fashion before her eyes. Plenty of room for a\nman to hide in that.... Half-ashamed of herself, Tuppence pulled it open\nand looked inside. No one--of course! She stooped down and looked under\nthe bed. There was no other possible hiding-place.\n\nTuppence gave her familiar shake of the shoulders. It was absurd, this\ngiving way to nerves! Slowly she went out of the room. Julius and Sir\nJames were talking in a low voice. Sir James turned to her.\n\n\"Lock the door on the outside, please, Miss Tuppence, and take out the\nkey. There must be no chance of anyone entering that room.\"\n\nThe gravity of his manner impressed them, and Tuppence felt less ashamed\nof her attack of \"nerves.\"\n\n\"Say,\" remarked Julius suddenly, \"there's Tuppence's bright boy. I guess\nI'd better go down and ease his young mind. That's some lad, Tuppence.\"\n\n\"How did you get in, by the way?\" asked Tuppence suddenly. \"I forgot to\nask.\"\n\n\"Well, Albert got me on the phone all right. I ran round for Sir James\nhere, and we came right on. The boy was on the look out for us, and was\njust a mite worried about what might have happened to you. He'd been\nlistening outside the door of the flat, but couldn't hear anything.\nAnyhow he suggested sending us up in the coal lift instead of ringing\nthe bell. And sure enough we landed in the scullery and came right along\nto find you. Albert's still below, and must be just hopping mad by this\ntime.\" With which Julius departed abruptly.\n\n\"Now then, Miss Tuppence,\" said Sir James, \"you know this place better\nthan I do. Where do you suggest we should take up our quarters?\"\n\nTuppence considered for a moment or two.\n\n\"I think Mrs. Vandemeyer's boudoir would be the most comfortable,\" she\nsaid at last, and led the way there.\n\nSir James looked round approvingly.\n\n\"This will do very well, and now, my dear young lady, do go to bed and\nget some sleep.\"\n\nTuppence shook her head resolutely.\n\n\"I couldn't, thank you, Sir James. I should dream of Mr. Brown all\nnight!\"\n\n\"But you'll be so tired, child.\"\n\n\"No, I shan't. I'd rather stay up--really.\"\n\nThe lawyer gave in.\n\nJulius reappeared some minutes later, having reassured Albert and\nrewarded him lavishly for his services. Having in his turn failed to\npersuade Tuppence to go to bed, he said decisively:\n\n\"At any rate, you've got to have something to eat right away. Where's\nthe larder?\"\n\nTuppence directed him, and he returned in a few minutes with a cold pie\nand three plates.\n\nAfter a hearty meal, the girl felt inclined to pooh-pooh her fancies of\nhalf an hour before. The power of the money bribe could not fail.\n\n\"And now, Miss Tuppence,\" said Sir James, \"we want to hear your\nadventures.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" agreed Julius.\n\nTuppence narrated her adventures with some complacence. Julius\noccasionally interjected an admiring \"Bully.\" Sir James said nothing\nuntil she had finished, when his quiet \"well done, Miss Tuppence,\" made\nher flush with pleasure.\n\n\"There's one thing I don't get clearly,\" said Julius. \"What put her up\nto clearing out?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" confessed Tuppence.\n\nSir James stroked his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"The room was in great disorder. That looks as though her flight was\nunpremeditated. Almost as though she got a sudden warning to go from\nsome one.\"\n\n\"Mr. Brown, I suppose,\" said Julius scoffingly.\n\nThe lawyer looked at him deliberately for a minute or two.\n\n\"Why not?\" he said. \"Remember, you yourself have once been worsted by\nhim.\"\n\nJulius flushed with vexation.\n\n\"I feel just mad when I think of how I handed out Jane's photograph to\nhim like a lamb. Gee, if I ever lay hands on it again, I'll freeze on to\nit like--like hell!\"\n\n\"That contingency is likely to be a remote one,\" said the other dryly.\n\n\"I guess you're right,\" said Julius frankly. \"And, in any case, it's the\noriginal I'm out after. Where do you think she can be, Sir James?\"\n\nThe lawyer shook his head.\n\n\"Impossible to say. But I've a very good idea where she has been.\"\n\n\"You have? Where?\"\n\nSir James smiled.\n\n\"At the scene of your nocturnal adventures, the Bournemouth nursing\nhome.\"\n\n\"There? Impossible. I asked.\"\n\n\"No, my dear sir, you asked if anyone of the name of Jane Finn had been\nthere. Now, if the girl had been placed there it would almost certainly\nbe under an assumed name.\"\n\n\"Bully for you,\" cried Julius. \"I never thought of that!\"\n\n\"It was fairly obvious,\" said the other.\n\n\"Perhaps the doctor's in it too,\" suggested Tuppence.\n\nJulius shook his head.\n\n\"I don't think so. I took to him at once. No, I'm pretty sure Dr. Hall's\nall right.\"\n\n\"Hall, did you say?\" asked Sir James. \"That is curious--really very\ncurious.\"\n\n\"Why?\" demanded Tuppence.\n\n\"Because I happened to meet him this morning. I've known him slightly on\nand off for some years, and this morning I ran across him in the street.\nStaying at the Metropole, he told me.\" He turned to Julius. \"Didn't he\ntell you he was coming up to town?\"\n\nJulius shook his head.\n\n\"Curious,\" mused Sir James. \"You did not mention his name this\nafternoon, or I would have suggested your going to him for further\ninformation with my card as introduction.\"\n\n\"I guess I'm a mutt,\" said Julius with unusual humility. \"I ought to\nhave thought of the false name stunt.\"\n\n\"How could you think of anything after falling out of that tree?\" cried\nTuppence. \"I'm sure anyone else would have been killed right off.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess it doesn't matter now, anyway,\" said Julius. \"We've got\nMrs. Vandemeyer on a string, and that's all we need.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence, but there was a lack of assurance in her voice.\n\nA silence settled down over the party. Little by little the magic of\nthe night began to gain a hold on them. There were sudden creaks of the\nfurniture, imperceptible rustlings in the curtains. Suddenly Tuppence\nsprang up with a cry.\n\n\"I can't help it. I know Mr. Brown's somewhere in the flat! I can FEEL\nhim.\"\n\n\"Sure, Tuppence, how could he be? This door's open into the hall. No\none could have come in by the front door without our seeing and hearing\nhim.\"\n\n\"I can't help it. I FEEL he's here!\"\n\nShe looked appealingly at Sir James, who replied gravely:\n\n\"With due deference to your feelings, Miss Tuppence (and mine as well\nfor that matter), I do not see how it is humanly possible for anyone to\nbe in the flat without our knowledge.\"\n\nThe girl was a little comforted by his words.\n\n\"Sitting up at night is always rather jumpy,\" she confessed.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sir James. \"We are in the condition of people holding a\nseance. Perhaps if a medium were present we might get some marvellous\nresults.\"\n\n\"Do you believe in spiritualism?\" asked Tuppence, opening her eyes wide.\n\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"There is some truth in it, without a doubt. But most of the testimony\nwould not pass muster in the witness-box.\"\n\nThe hours drew on. With the first faint glimmerings of dawn, Sir James\ndrew aside the curtains. They beheld, what few Londoners see, the slow\nrising of the sun over the sleeping city. Somehow, with the coming\nof the light, the dreads and fancies of the past night seemed absurd.\nTuppence's spirits revived to the normal.\n\n\"Hooray!\" she said. \"It's going to be a gorgeous day. And we shall find\nTommy. And Jane Finn. And everything will be lovely. I shall ask Mr.\nCarter if I can't be made a Dame!\"\n\nAt seven o'clock Tuppence volunteered to go and make some tea. She\nreturned with a tray, containing the teapot and four cups.\n\n\"Who's the other cup for?\" inquired Julius.\n\n\"The prisoner, of course. I suppose we might call her that?\"\n\n\"Taking her tea seems a kind of anticlimax to last night,\" said Julius\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes, it does,\" admitted Tuppence. \"But, anyway, here goes. Perhaps\nyou'd both come, too, in case she springs on me, or anything. You see,\nwe don't know what mood she'll wake up in.\"\n\nSir James and Julius accompanied her to the door.\n\n\"Where's the key? Oh, of course, I've got it myself.\"\n\nShe put it in the lock, and turned it, then paused.\n\n\"Supposing, after all, she's escaped?\" she murmured in a whisper.\n\n\"Plumb impossible,\" replied Julius reassuringly.\n\nBut Sir James said nothing.\n\nTuppence drew a long breath and entered. She heaved a sigh of relief as\nshe saw that Mrs. Vandemeyer was lying on the bed.\n\n\"Good morning,\" she remarked cheerfully. \"I've brought you some tea.\"\n\nMrs. Vandemeyer did not reply. Tuppence put down the cup on the table\nby the bed and went across to draw up the blinds. When she turned, Mrs.\nVandemeyer still lay without a movement. With a sudden fear clutching\nat her heart, Tuppence ran to the bed. The hand she lifted was cold as\nice.... Mrs. Vandemeyer would never speak now....\n\nHer cry brought the others. A very few minutes sufficed. Mrs. Vandemeyer\nwas dead--must have been dead some hours. She had evidently died in her\nsleep.\n\n\"If that isn't the cruellest luck,\" cried Julius in despair.\n\nThe lawyer was calmer, but there was a curious gleam in his eyes.\n\n\"If it is luck,\" he replied.\n\n\"You don't think--but, say, that's plumb impossible--no one could have\ngot in.\"\n\n\"No,\" admitted the lawyer. \"I don't see how they could. And yet--she is\non the point of betraying Mr. Brown, and--she dies. Is it only chance?\"\n\n\"But how----\"\n\n\"Yes, HOW! That is what we must find out.\" He stood there silently,\ngently stroking his chin. \"We must find out,\" he said quietly, and\nTuppence felt that if she was Mr. Brown she would not like the tone of\nthose simple words.\n\nJulius's glance went to the window.\n\n\"The window's open,\" he remarked. \"Do you think----\"\n\nTuppence shook her head.\n\n\"The balcony only goes along as far as the boudoir. We were there.\"\n\n\"He might have slipped out----\" suggested Julius.\n\nBut Sir James interrupted him.\n\n\"Mr. Brown's methods are not so crude. In the meantime we must send for\na doctor, but before we do so, is there anything in this room that might\nbe of value to us?\"\n\nHastily, the three searched. A charred mass in the grate indicated\nthat Mrs. Vandemeyer had been burning papers on the eve of her flight.\nNothing of importance remained, though they searched the other rooms as\nwell.\n\n\"There's that,\" said Tuppence suddenly, pointing to a small,\nold-fashioned safe let into the wall. \"It's for jewellery, I believe,\nbut there might be something else in it.\"\n\nThe key was in the lock, and Julius swung open the door, and searched\ninside. He was some time over the task.\n\n\"Well,\" said Tuppence impatiently.\n\nThere was a pause before Julius answered, then he withdrew his head and\nshut to the door.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said.\n\nIn five minutes a brisk young doctor arrived, hastily summoned. He was\ndeferential to Sir James, whom he recognized.\n\n\"Heart failure, or possibly an overdose of some sleeping-draught.\" He\nsniffed. \"Rather an odour of chloral in the air.\"\n\nTuppence remembered the glass she had upset. A new thought drove her to\nthe washstand. She found the little bottle from which Mrs. Vandemeyer\nhad poured a few drops.\n\nIt had been three parts full. Now--IT WAS EMPTY.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. A CONSULTATION\n\nNOTHING was more surprising and bewildering to Tuppence than the ease\nand simplicity with which everything was arranged, owing to Sir James's\nskilful handling. The doctor accepted quite readily the theory that Mrs.\nVandemeyer had accidentally taken an overdose of chloral. He doubted\nwhether an inquest would be necessary. If so, he would let Sir James\nknow. He understood that Mrs. Vandemeyer was on the eve of departure for\nabroad, and that the servants had already left? Sir James and his young\nfriends had been paying a call upon her, when she was suddenly stricken\ndown and they had spent the night in the flat, not liking to leave\nher alone. Did they know of any relatives? They did not, but Sir James\nreferred him to Mrs. Vandemeyer's solicitor.\n\nShortly afterwards a nurse arrived to take charge, and the other left\nthe ill-omened building.\n\n\"And what now?\" asked Julius, with a gesture of despair. \"I guess we're\ndown and out for good.\"\n\nSir James stroked his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"No,\" he said quietly. \"There is still the chance that Dr. Hall may be\nable to tell us something.\"\n\n\"Gee! I'd forgotten him.\"\n\n\"The chance is slight, but it must not be neglected. I think I told you\nthat he is staying at the Metropole. I should suggest that we call upon\nhim there as soon as possible. Shall we say after a bath and breakfast?\"\n\nIt was arranged that Tuppence and Julius should return to the Ritz, and\ncall for Sir James in the car. This programme was faithfully carried\nout, and a little after eleven they drew up before the Metropole. They\nasked for Dr. Hall, and a page-boy went in search of him. In a few\nminutes the little doctor came hurrying towards them.\n\n\"Can you spare us a few minutes, Dr. Hall?\" said Sir James pleasantly.\n\"Let me introduce you to Miss Cowley. Mr. Hersheimmer, I think, you\nalready know.\"\n\nA quizzical gleam came into the doctor's eye as he shook hands with\nJulius.\n\n\"Ah, yes, my young friend of the tree episode! Ankle all right, eh?\"\n\n\"I guess it's cured owing to your skilful treatment, doc.\"\n\n\"And the heart trouble? Ha ha!\"\n\n\"Still searching,\" said Julius briefly.\n\n\"To come to the point, can we have a word with you in private?\" asked\nSir James.\n\n\"Certainly. I think there is a room here where we shall be quite\nundisturbed.\"\n\nHe led the way, and the others followed him. They sat down, and the\ndoctor looked inquiringly at Sir James.\n\n\"Dr. Hall, I am very anxious to find a certain young lady for the\npurpose of obtaining a statement from her. I have reason to believe\nthat she has been at one time or another in your establishment at\nBournemouth. I hope I am transgressing no professional etiquette in\nquestioning you on the subject?\"\n\n\"I suppose it is a matter of testimony?\"\n\nSir James hesitated a moment, then he replied:\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I shall be pleased to give you any information in my power. What is\nthe young lady's name? Mr. Hersheimmer asked me, I remember----\" He half\nturned to Julius.\n\n\"The name,\" said Sir James bluntly, \"is really immaterial. She would be\nalmost certainly sent to you under an assumed one. But I should like to\nknow if you are acquainted with a Mrs. Vandemeyer?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer, of 20 South Audley Mansions? I know her slightly.\"\n\n\"You are not aware of what has happened?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You do not know that Mrs. Vandemeyer is dead?\"\n\n\"Dear, dear, I had no idea of it! When did it happen?\"\n\n\"She took an overdose of chloral last night.\"\n\n\"Purposely?\"\n\n\"Accidentally, it is believed. I should not like to say myself. Anyway,\nshe was found dead this morning.\"\n\n\"Very sad. A singularly handsome woman. I presume she was a friend of\nyours, since you are acquainted with all these details.\"\n\n\"I am acquainted with the details because--well, it was I who found her\ndead.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said the doctor, starting.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sir James, and stroked his chin reflectively.\n\n\"This is very sad news, but you will excuse me if I say that I do not\nsee how it bears on the subject of your inquiry?\"\n\n\"It bears on it in this way, is it not a fact that Mrs. Vandemeyer\ncommitted a young relative of hers to your charge?\"\n\nJulius leaned forward eagerly.\n\n\"That is the case,\" said the doctor quietly.\n\n\"Under the name of----?\"\n\n\"Janet Vandemeyer. I understood her to be a niece of Mrs. Vandemeyer's.\"\n\n\"And she came to you?\"\n\n\"As far as I can remember in June or July of 1915.\"\n\n\"Was she a mental case?\"\n\n\"She is perfectly sane, if that is what you mean. I understood from Mrs.\nVandemeyer that the girl had been with her on the Lusitania when\nthat ill-fated ship was sunk, and had suffered a severe shock in\nconsequence.\"\n\n\"We're on the right track, I think?\" Sir James looked round.\n\n\"As I said before, I'm a mutt!\" returned Julius.\n\nThe doctor looked at them all curiously.\n\n\"You spoke of wanting a statement from her,\" he said. \"Supposing she is\nnot able to give one?\"\n\n\"What? You have just said that she is perfectly sane.\"\n\n\"So she is. Nevertheless, if you want a statement from her concerning\nany events prior to May 7, 1915, she will not be able to give it to\nyou.\"\n\nThey looked at the little man, stupefied. He nodded cheerfully.\n\n\"It's a pity,\" he said. \"A great pity, especially as I gather, Sir\nJames, that the matter is important. But there it is, she can tell you\nnothing.\"\n\n\"But why, man? Darn it all, why?\"\n\nThe little man shifted his benevolent glance to the excited young\nAmerican.\n\n\"Because Janet Vandemeyer is suffering from a complete loss of memory.\"\n\n\"WHAT?\"\n\n\"Quite so. An interesting case, a very interesting case. Not so\nuncommon, really, as you would think. There are several very well known\nparallels. It's the first case of the kind that I've had under my own\npersonal observation, and I must admit that I've found it of absorbing\ninterest.\" There was something rather ghoulish in the little man's\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"And she remembers nothing,\" said Sir James slowly.\n\n\"Nothing prior to May 7, 1915. After that date her memory is as good as\nyours or mine.\"\n\n\"Then the first thing she remembers?\"\n\n\"Is landing with the survivors. Everything before that is a blank. She\ndid not know her own name, or where she had come from, or where she was.\nShe couldn't even speak her own tongue.\"\n\n\"But surely all this is most unusual?\" put in Julius.\n\n\"No, my dear sir. Quite normal under the circumstances. Severe shock to\nthe nervous system. Loss of memory proceeds nearly always on the same\nlines. I suggested a specialist, of course. There's a very good man in\nParis--makes a study of these cases--but Mrs. Vandemeyer opposed the\nidea of publicity that might result from such a course.\"\n\n\"I can imagine she would,\" said Sir James grimly.\n\n\"I fell in with her views. There is a certain notoriety given to these\ncases. And the girl was very young--nineteen, I believe. It seemed\na pity that her infirmity should be talked about--might damage her\nprospects. Besides, there is no special treatment to pursue in such\ncases. It is really a matter of waiting.\"\n\n\"Waiting?\"\n\n\"Yes, sooner or later, the memory will return--as suddenly as it\nwent. But in all probability the girl will have entirely forgotten the\nintervening period, and will take up life where she left off--at the\nsinking of the Lusitania.\"\n\n\"And when do you expect this to happen?\"\n\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Ah, that I cannot say. Sometimes it is a matter of months, sometimes\nit has been known to be as long as twenty years! Sometimes another shock\ndoes the trick. One restores what the other took away.\"\n\n\"Another shock, eh?\" said Julius thoughtfully.\n\n\"Exactly. There was a case in Colorado----\" The little man's voice\ntrailed on, voluble, mildly enthusiastic.\n\nJulius did not seem to be listening. He had relapsed into his own\nthoughts and was frowning. Suddenly he came out of his brown study,\nand hit the table such a resounding bang with his fist that every one\njumped, the doctor most of all.\n\n\"I've got it! I guess, doc, I'd like your medical opinion on the plan\nI'm about to outline. Say Jane was to cross the herring pond again, and\nthe same thing was to happen. The submarine, the sinking ship, every one\nto take to the boats--and so on. Wouldn't that do the trick? Wouldn't it\ngive a mighty big bump to her subconscious self, or whatever the jargon\nis, and start it functioning again right away?\"\n\n\"A very interesting speculation, Mr. Hersheimmer. In my own opinion, it\nwould be successful. It is unfortunate that there is no chance of the\nconditions repeating themselves as you suggest.\"\n\n\"Not by nature, perhaps, doc. But I'm talking about art.\"\n\n\"Art?\"\n\n\"Why, yes. What's the difficulty? Hire a liner----\"\n\n\"A liner!\" murmured Dr. Hall faintly.\n\n\"Hire some passengers, hire a submarine--that's the only difficulty, I\nguess. Governments are apt to be a bit hidebound over their engines of\nwar. They won't sell to the firstcomer. Still, I guess that can be got\nover. Ever heard of the word 'graft,' sir? Well, graft gets there every\ntime! I reckon that we shan't really need to fire a torpedo. If every\none hustles round and screams loud enough that the ship is sinking, it\nought to be enough for an innocent young girl like Jane. By the time\nshe's got a life-belt on her, and is being hustled into a boat, with\na well-drilled lot of artistes doing the hysterical stunt on deck,\nwhy--she ought to be right back where she was in May, 1915. How's that\nfor the bare outline?\"\n\nDr. Hall looked at Julius. Everything that he was for the moment\nincapable of saying was eloquent in that look.\n\n\"No,\" said Julius, in answer to it, \"I'm not crazy. The thing's\nperfectly possible. It's done every day in the States for the movies.\nHaven't you seen trains in collision on the screen? What's the\ndifference between buying up a train and buying up a liner? Get the\nproperties and you can go right ahead!\"\n\nDr. Hall found his voice.\n\n\"But the expense, my dear sir.\" His voice rose. \"The expense! It will be\nCOLOSSAL!\"\n\n\"Money doesn't worry me any,\" explained Julius simply.\n\nDr. Hall turned an appealing face to Sir James, who smiled slightly.\n\n\"Mr. Hersheimmer is very well off--very well off indeed.\"\n\nThe doctor's glance came back to Julius with a new and subtle quality in\nit. This was no longer an eccentric young fellow with a habit of falling\noff trees. The doctor's eyes held the deference accorded to a really\nrich man.\n\n\"Very remarkable plan. Very remarkable,\" he murmured. \"The movies--of\ncourse! Your American word for the kinema. Very interesting. I fear we\nare perhaps a little behind the times over here in our methods. And you\nreally mean to carry out this remarkable plan of yours.\"\n\n\"You bet your bottom dollar I do.\"\n\nThe doctor believed him--which was a tribute to his nationality. If an\nEnglishman had suggested such a thing, he would have had grave doubts as\nto his sanity.\n\n\"I cannot guarantee a cure,\" he pointed out. \"Perhaps I ought to make\nthat quite clear.\"\n\n\"Sure, that's all right,\" said Julius. \"You just trot out Jane, and\nleave the rest to me.\"\n\n\"Jane?\"\n\n\"Miss Janet Vandemeyer, then. Can we get on the long distance to your\nplace right away, and ask them to send her up; or shall I run down and\nfetch her in my car?\"\n\nThe doctor stared.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Hersheimmer. I thought you understood.\"\n\n\"Understood what?\"\n\n\"That Miss Vandemeyer is no longer under my care.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. TUPPENCE RECEIVES A PROPOSAL\n\nJULIUS sprang up.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I thought you were aware of that.\"\n\n\"When did she leave?\"\n\n\"Let me see. To-day is Monday, is it not? It must have been last\nWednesday--why, surely--yes, it was the same evening that you--er--fell\nout of my tree.\"\n\n\"That evening? Before, or after?\"\n\n\"Let me see--oh yes, afterwards. A very urgent message arrived from Mrs.\nVandemeyer. The young lady and the nurse who was in charge of her left\nby the night train.\"\n\nJulius sank back again into his chair.\n\n\"Nurse Edith--left with a patient--I remember,\" he muttered. \"My God, to\nhave been so near!\"\n\nDr. Hall looked bewildered.\n\n\"I don't understand. Is the young lady not with her aunt, after all?\"\n\nTuppence shook her head. She was about to speak when a warning glance\nfrom Sir James made her hold her tongue. The lawyer rose.\n\n\"I'm much obliged to you, Hall. We're very grateful for all you've\ntold us. I'm afraid we're now in the position of having to track Miss\nVandemeyer anew. What about the nurse who accompanied her; I suppose you\ndon't know where she is?\"\n\nThe doctor shook his head.\n\n\"We've not heard from her, as it happens. I understood she was to remain\nwith Miss Vandemeyer for a while. But what can have happened? Surely the\ngirl has not been kidnapped.\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" said Sir James gravely.\n\nThe other hesitated.\n\n\"You do not think I ought to go to the police?\"\n\n\"No, no. In all probability the young lady is with other relations.\"\n\nThe doctor was not completely satisfied, but he saw that Sir James was\ndetermined to say no more, and realized that to try and extract\nmore information from the famous K.C. would be mere waste of labour.\nAccordingly, he wished them goodbye, and they left the hotel. For a few\nminutes they stood by the car talking.\n\n\"How maddening,\" cried Tuppence. \"To think that Julius must have been\nactually under the same roof with her for a few hours.\"\n\n\"I was a darned idiot,\" muttered Julius gloomily.\n\n\"You couldn't know,\" Tuppence consoled him. \"Could he?\" She appealed to\nSir James.\n\n\"I should advise you not to worry,\" said the latter kindly. \"No use\ncrying over spilt milk, you know.\"\n\n\"The great thing is what to do next,\" added Tuppence the practical.\n\nSir James shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"You might advertise for the nurse who accompanied the girl. That is\nthe only course I can suggest, and I must confess I do not hope for much\nresult. Otherwise there is nothing to be done.\"\n\n\"Nothing?\" said Tuppence blankly. \"And--Tommy?\"\n\n\"We must hope for the best,\" said Sir James. \"Oh yes, we must go on\nhoping.\"\n\nBut over her downcast head his eyes met Julius's, and almost\nimperceptibly he shook his head. Julius understood. The lawyer\nconsidered the case hopeless. The young American's face grew grave. Sir\nJames took Tuppence's hand.\n\n\"You must let me know if anything further comes to light. Letters will\nalways be forwarded.\"\n\nTuppence stared at him blankly.\n\n\"You are going away?\"\n\n\"I told you. Don't you remember? To Scotland.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I thought----\" The girl hesitated.\n\nSir James shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"My dear young lady, I can do nothing more, I fear. Our clues have all\nended in thin air. You can take my word for it that there is nothing\nmore to be done. If anything should arise, I shall be glad to advise you\nin any way I can.\"\n\nHis words gave Tuppence an extraordinarily desolate feeling.\n\n\"I suppose you're right,\" she said. \"Anyway, thank you very much for\ntrying to help us. Good-bye.\"\n\nJulius was bending over the car. A momentary pity came into Sir James's\nkeen eyes, as he gazed into the girl's downcast face.\n\n\"Don't be too disconsolate, Miss Tuppence,\" he said in a low voice.\n\"Remember, holiday-time isn't always all playtime. One sometimes manages\nto put in some work as well.\"\n\nSomething in his tone made Tuppence glance up sharply. He shook his head\nwith a smile.\n\n\"No, I shan't say any more. Great mistake to say too much. Remember\nthat. Never tell all you know--not even to the person you know best.\nUnderstand? Good-bye.\"\n\nHe strode away. Tuppence stared after him. She was beginning to\nunderstand Sir James's methods. Once before he had thrown her a hint\nin the same careless fashion. Was this a hint? What exactly lay\nbehind those last brief words? Did he mean that, after all, he had not\nabandoned the case; that, secretly, he would be working on it still\nwhile----\n\nHer meditations were interrupted by Julius, who adjured her to \"get\nright in.\"\n\n\"You're looking kind of thoughtful,\" he remarked as they started off.\n\"Did the old guy say anything more?\"\n\nTuppence opened her mouth impulsively, and then shut it again. Sir\nJames's words sounded in her ears: \"Never tell all you know--not even\nto the person you know best.\" And like a flash there came into her mind\nanother memory. Julius before the safe in the flat, her own question and\nthe pause before his reply, \"Nothing.\" Was there really nothing? Or\nhad he found something he wished to keep to himself? If he could make a\nreservation, so could she.\n\n\"Nothing particular,\" she replied.\n\nShe felt rather than saw Julius throw a sideways glance at her.\n\n\"Say, shall we go for a spin in the park?\"\n\n\"If you like.\"\n\nFor a while they ran on under the trees in silence. It was a beautiful\nday. The keen rush through the air brought a new exhilaration to\nTuppence.\n\n\"Say, Miss Tuppence, do you think I'm ever going to find Jane?\"\n\nJulius spoke in a discouraged voice. The mood was so alien to him that\nTuppence turned and stared at him in surprise. He nodded.\n\n\"That's so. I'm getting down and out over the business. Sir James to-day\nhadn't got any hope at all, I could see that. I don't like him--we don't\ngee together somehow--but he's pretty cute, and I guess he wouldn't quit\nif there was any chance of success--now, would he?\"\n\nTuppence felt rather uncomfortable, but clinging to her belief that\nJulius also had withheld something from her, she remained firm.\n\n\"He suggested advertising for the nurse,\" she reminded him.\n\n\"Yes, with a 'forlorn hope' flavour to his voice! No--I'm about fed up.\nI've half a mind to go back to the States right away.\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" cried Tuppence. \"We've got to find Tommy.\"\n\n\"I sure forgot Beresford,\" said Julius contritely. \"That's so. We must\nfind him. But after--well, I've been day-dreaming ever since I started\non this trip--and these dreams are rotten poor business. I'm quit of\nthem. Say, Miss Tuppence, there's something I'd like to ask you.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"You and Beresford. What about it?\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" replied Tuppence with dignity, adding rather\ninconsequently: \"And, anyway, you're wrong!\"\n\n\"Not got a sort of kindly feeling for one another?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Tuppence with warmth. \"Tommy and I are\nfriends--nothing more.\"\n\n\"I guess every pair of lovers has said that sometime or another,\"\nobserved Julius.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" snapped Tuppence. \"Do I look the sort of girl that's always\nfalling in love with every man she meets?\"\n\n\"You do not. You look the sort of girl that's mighty often getting\nfallen in love with!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence, rather taken aback. \"That's a compliment, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"Sure. Now let's get down to this. Supposing we never find Beresford\nand--and----\"\n\n\"All right--say it! I can face facts. Supposing he's--dead! Well?\"\n\n\"And all this business fiddles out. What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Tuppence forlornly.\n\n\"You'll be darned lonesome, you poor kid.\"\n\n\"I shall be all right,\" snapped Tuppence with her usual resentment of\nany kind of pity.\n\n\"What about marriage?\" inquired Julius. \"Got any views on the subject?\"\n\n\"I intend to marry, of course,\" replied Tuppence. \"That is, if\"--she\npaused, knew a momentary longing to draw back, and then stuck to her\nguns bravely--\"I can find some one rich enough to make it worth my\nwhile. That's frank, isn't it? I dare say you despise me for it.\"\n\n\"I never despise business instinct,\" said Julius. \"What particular\nfigure have you in mind?\"\n\n\"Figure?\" asked Tuppence, puzzled. \"Do you mean tall or short?\"\n\n\"No. Sum--income.\"\n\n\"Oh, I--I haven't quite worked that out.\"\n\n\"What about me?\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Sure thing.\"\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I tell you I couldn't.\"\n\n\"Again, why not?\"\n\n\"It would seem so unfair.\"\n\n\"I don't see anything unfair about it. I call your bluff, that's all. I\nadmire you immensely, Miss Tuppence, more than any girl I've ever met.\nYou're so darned plucky. I'd just love to give you a real, rattling good\ntime. Say the word, and we'll run round right away to some high-class\njeweller, and fix up the ring business.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" gasped Tuppence.\n\n\"Because of Beresford?\"\n\n\"No, no, NO!\"\n\n\"Well then?\"\n\nTuppence merely continued to shake her head violently.\n\n\"You can't reasonably expect more dollars than I've got.\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't that,\" gasped Tuppence with an almost hysterical laugh.\n\"But thanking you very much, and all that, I think I'd better say no.\"\n\n\"I'd be obliged if you'd do me the favour to think it over until\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"It's no use.\"\n\n\"Still, I guess we'll leave it like that.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Tuppence meekly.\n\nNeither of them spoke again until they reached the Ritz.\n\nTuppence went upstairs to her room. She felt morally battered to the\nground after her conflict with Julius's vigorous personality. Sitting\ndown in front of the glass, she stared at her own reflection for some\nminutes.\n\n\"Fool,\" murmured Tuppence at length, making a grimace. \"Little fool.\nEverything you want--everything you've ever hoped for, and you go and\nbleat out 'no' like an idiotic little sheep. It's your one chance. Why\ndon't you take it? Grab it? Snatch at it? What more do you want?\"\n\nAs if in answer to her own question, her eyes fell on a small snapshot\nof Tommy that stood on her dressing-table in a shabby frame. For a\nmoment she struggled for self-control, and then abandoning all presence,\nshe held it to her lips and burst into a fit of sobbing.\n\n\"Oh, Tommy, Tommy,\" she cried, \"I do love you so--and I may never see\nyou again....\"\n\nAt the end of five minutes Tuppence sat up, blew her nose, and pushed\nback her hair.\n\n\"That's that,\" she observed sternly. \"Let's look facts in the face. I\nseem to have fallen in love--with an idiot of a boy who probably doesn't\ncare two straws about me.\" Here she paused. \"Anyway,\" she resumed, as\nthough arguing with an unseen opponent, \"I don't KNOW that he does. He'd\nnever have dared to say so. I've always jumped on sentiment--and here\nI am being more sentimental than anybody. What idiots girls are! I've\nalways thought so. I suppose I shall sleep with his photograph under my\npillow, and dream about him all night. It's dreadful to feel you've been\nfalse to your principles.\"\n\nTuppence shook her head sadly, as she reviewed her backsliding.\n\n\"I don't know what to say to Julius, I'm sure. Oh, what a fool I feel!\nI'll have to say SOMETHING--he's so American and thorough, he'll insist\nupon having a reason. I wonder if he did find anything in that safe----\"\n\nTuppence's meditations went off on another tack. She reviewed the events\nof last night carefully and persistently. Somehow, they seemed bound up\nwith Sir James's enigmatical words....\n\nSuddenly she gave a great start--the colour faded out of her face. Her\neyes, fascinated, gazed in front of her, the pupils dilated.\n\n\"Impossible,\" she murmured. \"Impossible! I must be going mad even to\nthink of such a thing....\"\n\nMonstrous--yet it explained everything....\n\nAfter a moment's reflection she sat down and wrote a note, weighing each\nword as she did so. Finally she nodded her head as though satisfied, and\nslipped it into an envelope which she addressed to Julius. She went\ndown the passage to his sitting-room and knocked at the door. As she had\nexpected, the room was empty. She left the note on the table.\n\nA small page-boy was waiting outside her own door when she returned to\nit.\n\n\"Telegram for you, miss.\"\n\nTuppence took it from the salver, and tore it open carelessly. Then she\ngave a cry. The telegram was from Tommy!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. FURTHER ADVENTURES OF TOMMY\n\nFROM a darkness punctuated with throbbing stabs of fire, Tommy dragged\nhis senses slowly back to life. When he at last opened his eyes, he was\nconscious of nothing but an excruciating pain through his temples. He\nwas vaguely aware of unfamiliar surroundings. Where was he? What had\nhappened? He blinked feebly. This was not his bedroom at the Ritz. And\nwhat the devil was the matter with his head?\n\n\"Damn!\" said Tommy, and tried to sit up. He had remembered. He was in\nthat sinister house in Soho. He uttered a groan and fell back. Through\nhis almost-closed lids he reconnoitred carefully.\n\n\"He is coming to,\" remarked a voice very near Tommy's ear. He recognized\nit at once for that of the bearded and efficient German, and lay\nartistically inert. He felt that it would be a pity to come round too\nsoon; and until the pain in his head became a little less acute, he felt\nquite incapable of collecting his wits. Painfully he tried to puzzle out\nwhat had happened. Obviously somebody must have crept up behind him as\nhe listened and struck him down with a blow on the head. They knew\nhim now for a spy, and would in all probability give him short shrift.\nUndoubtedly he was in a tight place. Nobody knew where he was, therefore\nhe need expect no outside assistance, and must depend solely on his own\nwits.\n\n\"Well, here goes,\" murmured Tommy to himself, and repeated his former\nremark.\n\n\"Damn!\" he observed, and this time succeeded in sitting up.\n\nIn a minute the German stepped forward and placed a glass to his lips,\nwith the brief command \"Drink.\" Tommy obeyed. The potency of the draught\nmade him choke, but it cleared his brain in a marvellous manner.\n\nHe was lying on a couch in the room in which the meeting had been held.\nOn one side of him was the German, on the other the villainous-faced\ndoorkeeper who had let him in. The others were grouped together at a\nlittle distance away. But Tommy missed one face. The man known as Number\nOne was no longer of the company.\n\n\"Feel better?\" asked the German, as he removed the empty glass.\n\n\"Yes, thanks,\" returned Tommy cheerfully.\n\n\"Ah, my young friend, it is lucky for you your skull is so thick. The\ngood Conrad struck hard.\" He indicated the evil-faced doorkeeper by a\nnod. The man grinned.\n\nTommy twisted his head round with an effort.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"so you're Conrad, are you? It strikes me the thickness\nof my skull was lucky for you too. When I look at you I feel it's almost\na pity I've enabled you to cheat the hangman.\"\n\nThe man snarled, and the bearded man said quietly:\n\n\"He would have run no risk of that.\"\n\n\"Just as you like,\" replied Tommy. \"I know it's the fashion to run down\nthe police. I rather believe in them myself.\"\n\nHis manner was nonchalant to the last degree. Tommy Beresford was one\nof those young Englishmen not distinguished by any special intellectual\nability, but who are emphatically at their best in what is known as a\n\"tight place.\" Their natural diffidence and caution fall from them like\na glove. Tommy realized perfectly that in his own wits lay the only\nchance of escape, and behind his casual manner he was racking his brains\nfuriously.\n\nThe cold accents of the German took up the conversation:\n\n\"Have you anything to say before you are put to death as a spy?\"\n\n\"Simply lots of things,\" replied Tommy with the same urbanity as before.\n\n\"Do you deny that you were listening at that door?\"\n\n\"I do not. I must really apologize--but your conversation was so\ninteresting that it overcame my scruples.\"\n\n\"How did you get in?\"\n\n\"Dear old Conrad here.\" Tommy smiled deprecatingly at him. \"I hesitate\nto suggest pensioning off a faithful servant, but you really ought to\nhave a better watchdog.\"\n\nConrad snarled impotently, and said sullenly, as the man with the beard\nswung round upon him:\n\n\"He gave the word. How was I to know?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Tommy chimed in. \"How was he to know? Don't blame the poor\nfellow. His hasty action has given me the pleasure of seeing you all\nface to face.\"\n\nHe fancied that his words caused some discomposure among the group, but\nthe watchful German stilled it with a wave of his hand.\n\n\"Dead men tell no tales,\" he said evenly.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Tommy, \"but I'm not dead yet!\"\n\n\"You soon will be, my young friend,\" said the German.\n\nAn assenting murmur came from the others.\n\nTommy's heart beat faster, but his casual pleasantness did not waver.\n\n\"I think not,\" he said firmly. \"I should have a great objection to\ndying.\"\n\nHe had got them puzzled, he saw that by the look on his captor's face.\n\n\"Can you give us any reason why we should not put you to death?\" asked\nthe German.\n\n\"Several,\" replied Tommy. \"Look here, you've been asking me a lot of\nquestions. Let me ask you one for a change. Why didn't you kill me off\nat once before I regained consciousness?\"\n\nThe German hesitated, and Tommy seized his advantage.\n\n\"Because you didn't know how much I knew--and where I obtained that\nknowledge. If you kill me now, you never will know.\"\n\nBut here the emotions of Boris became too much for him. He stepped\nforward waving his arms.\n\n\"You hell-hound of a spy,\" he screamed. \"We will give you short shrift.\nKill him! Kill him!\"\n\nThere was a roar of applause.\n\n\"You hear?\" said the German, his eyes on Tommy. \"What have you to say to\nthat?\"\n\n\"Say?\" Tommy shrugged his shoulders. \"Pack of fools. Let them ask\nthemselves a few questions. How did I get into this place? Remember what\ndear old Conrad said--WITH YOUR OWN PASSWORD, wasn't it? How did I get\nhold of that? You don't suppose I came up those steps haphazard and said\nthe first thing that came into my head?\"\n\nTommy was pleased with the concluding words of this speech. His only\nregret was that Tuppence was not present to appreciate its full flavour.\n\n\"That is true,\" said the working man suddenly. \"Comrades, we have been\nbetrayed!\"\n\nAn ugly murmur arose. Tommy smiled at them encouragingly.\n\n\"That's better. How can you hope to make a success of any job if you\ndon't use your brains?\"\n\n\"You will tell us who has betrayed us,\" said the German. \"But that shall\nnot save you--oh, no! You shall tell us all that you know. Boris, here,\nknows pretty ways of making people speak!\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Tommy scornfully, fighting down a singularly unpleasant\nfeeling in the pit of his stomach. \"You will neither torture me nor kill\nme.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" asked Boris.\n\n\"Because you'd kill the goose that lays the golden eggs,\" replied Tommy\nquietly.\n\nThere was a momentary pause. It seemed as though Tommy's persistent\nassurance was at last conquering. They were no longer completely sure of\nthemselves. The man in the shabby clothes stared at Tommy searchingly.\n\n\"He's bluffing you, Boris,\" he said quietly.\n\nTommy hated him. Had the man seen through him?\n\nThe German, with an effort, turned roughly to Tommy.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"What do you think I mean?\" parried Tommy, searching desperately in his\nown mind.\n\nSuddenly Boris stepped forward, and shook his fist in Tommy's face.\n\n\"Speak, you swine of an Englishman--speak!\"\n\n\"Don't get so excited, my good fellow,\" said Tommy calmly. \"That's the\nworst of you foreigners. You can't keep calm. Now, I ask you, do I look\nas though I thought there were the least chance of your killing me?\"\n\nHe looked confidently round, and was glad they could not hear the\npersistent beating of his heart which gave the lie to his words.\n\n\"No,\" admitted Boris at last sullenly, \"you do not.\"\n\n\"Thank God, he's not a mind reader,\" thought Tommy. Aloud he pursued his\nadvantage:\n\n\"And why am I so confident? Because I know something that puts me in a\nposition to propose a bargain.\"\n\n\"A bargain?\" The bearded man took him up sharply.\n\n\"Yes--a bargain. My life and liberty against----\" He paused.\n\n\"Against what?\"\n\nThe group pressed forward. You could have heard a pin drop.\n\nSlowly Tommy spoke.\n\n\"The papers that Danvers brought over from America in the Lusitania.\"\n\nThe effect of his words was electrical. Every one was on his feet.\nThe German waved them back. He leaned over Tommy, his face purple with\nexcitement.\n\n\"Himmel! You have got them, then?\"\n\nWith magnificent calm Tommy shook his head.\n\n\"You know where they are?\" persisted the German.\n\nAgain Tommy shook his head. \"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"Then--then----\" angry and baffled, the words failed him.\n\nTommy looked round. He saw anger and bewilderment on every face, but his\ncalm assurance had done its work--no one doubted but that something lay\nbehind his words.\n\n\"I don't know where the papers are--but I believe that I can find them.\nI have a theory----\"\n\n\"Pah!\"\n\nTommy raised his hand, and silenced the clamours of disgust.\n\n\"I call it a theory--but I'm pretty sure of my facts--facts that are\nknown to no one but myself. In any case what do you lose? If I can\nproduce the papers--you give me my life and liberty in exchange. Is it a\nbargain?\"\n\n\"And if we refuse?\" said the German quietly.\n\nTommy lay back on the couch.\n\n\"The 29th,\" he said thoughtfully, \"is less than a fortnight ahead----\"\n\nFor a moment the German hesitated. Then he made a sign to Conrad.\n\n\"Take him into the other room.\"\n\nFor five minutes, Tommy sat on the bed in the dingy room next door. His\nheart was beating violently. He had risked all on this throw. How would\nthey decide? And all the while that this agonized questioning went on\nwithin him, he talked flippantly to Conrad, enraging the cross-grained\ndoorkeeper to the point of homicidal mania.\n\nAt last the door opened, and the German called imperiously to Conrad to\nreturn.\n\n\"Let's hope the judge hasn't put his black cap on,\" remarked Tommy\nfrivolously. \"That's right, Conrad, march me in. The prisoner is at the\nbar, gentlemen.\"\n\nThe German was seated once more behind the table. He motioned to Tommy\nto sit down opposite to him.\n\n\"We accept,\" he said harshly, \"on terms. The papers must be delivered to\nus before you go free.\"\n\n\"Idiot!\" said Tommy amiably. \"How do you think I can look for them if\nyou keep me tied by the leg here?\"\n\n\"What do you expect, then?\"\n\n\"I must have liberty to go about the business in my own way.\"\n\nThe German laughed.\n\n\"Do you think we are little children to let you walk out of here leaving\nus a pretty story full of promises?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Tommy thoughtfully. \"Though infinitely simpler for me, I\ndid not really think you would agree to that plan. Very well, we must\narrange a compromise. How would it be if you attached little Conrad here\nto my person. He's a faithful fellow, and very ready with the fist.\"\n\n\"We prefer,\" said the German coldly, \"that you should remain here.\nOne of our number will carry out your instructions minutely. If the\noperations are complicated, he will return to you with a report and you\ncan instruct him further.\"\n\n\"You're tying my hands,\" complained Tommy. \"It's a very delicate affair,\nand the other fellow will muff it up as likely as not, and then where\nshall I be? I don't believe one of you has got an ounce of tact.\"\n\nThe German rapped the table.\n\n\"Those are our terms. Otherwise, death!\"\n\nTommy leaned back wearily.\n\n\"I like your style. Curt, but attractive. So be it, then. But one thing\nis essential, I must see the girl.\"\n\n\"What girl?\"\n\n\"Jane Finn, of course.\"\n\nThe other looked at him curiously for some minutes, then he said slowly,\nand as though choosing his words with care:\n\n\"Do you not know that she can tell you nothing?\"\n\nTommy's heart beat a little faster. Would he succeed in coming face to\nface with the girl he was seeking?\n\n\"I shall not ask her to tell me anything,\" he said quietly. \"Not in so\nmany words, that is.\"\n\n\"Then why see her?\"\n\nTommy paused.\n\n\"To watch her face when I ask her one question,\" he replied at last.\n\nAgain there was a look in the German's eyes that Tommy did not quite\nunderstand.\n\n\"She will not be able to answer your question.\"\n\n\"That does not matter. I shall have seen her face when I ask it.\"\n\n\"And you think that will tell you anything?\" He gave a short\ndisagreeable laugh. More than ever, Tommy felt that there was a\nfactor somewhere that he did not understand. The German looked at\nhim searchingly. \"I wonder whether, after all, you know as much as we\nthink?\" he said softly.\n\nTommy felt his ascendancy less sure than a moment before. His hold had\nslipped a little. But he was puzzled. What had he said wrong? He spoke\nout on the impulse of the moment.\n\n\"There may be things that you know which I do not. I have not pretended\nto be aware of all the details of your show. But equally I've got\nsomething up my sleeve that you don't know about. And that's where I\nmean to score. Danvers was a damned clever fellow----\" He broke off as\nif he had said too much.\n\nBut the German's face had lightened a little.\n\n\"Danvers,\" he murmured. \"I see----\" He paused a minute, then waved to\nConrad. \"Take him away. Upstairs--you know.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Tommy. \"What about the girl?\"\n\n\"That may perhaps be arranged.\"\n\n\"It must be.\"\n\n\"We will see about it. Only one person can decide that.\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked Tommy. But he knew the answer.\n\n\"Mr. Brown----\"\n\n\"Shall I see him?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Conrad harshly.\n\nTommy rose obediently. Outside the door his gaoler motioned to him to\nmount the stairs. He himself followed close behind. On the floor above\nConrad opened a door and Tommy passed into a small room. Conrad lit a\nhissing gas burner and went out. Tommy heard the sound of the key being\nturned in the lock.\n\nHe set to work to examine his prison. It was a smaller room than the\none downstairs, and there was something peculiarly airless about the\natmosphere of it. Then he realized that there was no window. He walked\nround it. The walls were filthily dirty, as everywhere else. Four\npictures hung crookedly on the wall representing scenes from Faust.\nMarguerite with her box of jewels, the church scene, Siebel and his\nflowers, and Faust and Mephistopheles. The latter brought Tommy's mind\nback to Mr. Brown again. In this sealed and closed chamber, with its\nclose-fitting heavy door, he felt cut off from the world, and the\nsinister power of the arch-criminal seemed more real. Shout as he would,\nno one could ever hear him. The place was a living tomb....\n\nWith an effort Tommy pulled himself together. He sank on to the bed\nand gave himself up to reflection. His head ached badly; also, he was\nhungry. The silence of the place was dispiriting.\n\n\"Anyway,\" said Tommy, trying to cheer himself, \"I shall see the\nchief--the mysterious Mr. Brown and with a bit of luck in bluffing I\nshall see the mysterious Jane Finn also. After that----\"\n\nAfter that Tommy was forced to admit the prospect looked dreary.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. ANNETTE\n\nTHE troubles of the future, however, soon faded before the troubles of\nthe present. And of these, the most immediate and pressing was that of\nhunger. Tommy had a healthy and vigorous appetite. The steak and\nchips partaken of for lunch seemed now to belong to another decade. He\nregretfully recognized the fact that he would not make a success of a\nhunger strike.\n\nHe prowled aimlessly about his prison. Once or twice he discarded\ndignity, and pounded on the door. But nobody answered the summons.\n\n\"Hang it all!\" said Tommy indignantly. \"They can't mean to starve me\nto death.\" A new-born fear passed through his mind that this might,\nperhaps, be one of those \"pretty ways\" of making a prisoner speak, which\nhad been attributed to Boris. But on reflection he dismissed the idea.\n\n\"It's that sour-faced brute Conrad,\" he decided. \"That's a fellow I\nshall enjoy getting even with one of these days. This is just a bit of\nspite on his part. I'm certain of it.\"\n\nFurther meditations induced in him the feeling that it would be\nextremely pleasant to bring something down with a whack on Conrad's\negg-shaped head. Tommy stroked his own head tenderly, and gave himself\nup to the pleasures of imagination. Finally a bright idea flashed\nacross his brain. Why not convert imagination into reality? Conrad\nwas undoubtedly the tenant of the house. The others, with the possible\nexception of the bearded German, merely used it as a rendezvous.\nTherefore, why not wait in ambush for Conrad behind the door, and when\nhe entered bring down a chair, or one of the decrepit pictures, smartly\non to his head. One would, of course, be careful not to hit too hard.\nAnd then--and then, simply walk out! If he met anyone on the way down,\nwell----Tommy brightened at the thought of an encounter with his fists.\nSuch an affair was infinitely more in his line than the verbal encounter\nof this afternoon. Intoxicated by his plan, Tommy gently unhooked the\npicture of the Devil and Faust, and settled himself in position. His\nhopes were high. The plan seemed to him simple but excellent.\n\nTime went on, but Conrad did not appear. Night and day were the same\nin this prison room, but Tommy's wrist-watch, which enjoyed a certain\ndegree of accuracy, informed him that it was nine o'clock in the\nevening. Tommy reflected gloomily that if supper did not arrive soon\nit would be a question of waiting for breakfast. At ten o'clock hope\ndeserted him, and he flung himself on the bed to seek consolation in\nsleep. In five minutes his woes were forgotten.\n\nThe sound of the key turning in the lock awoke him from his slumbers.\nNot belonging to the type of hero who is famous for awaking in full\npossession of his faculties, Tommy merely blinked at the ceiling and\nwondered vaguely where he was. Then he remembered, and looked at his\nwatch. It was eight o'clock.\n\n\"It's either early morning tea or breakfast,\" deduced the young man,\n\"and pray God it's the latter!\"\n\nThe door swung open. Too late, Tommy remembered his scheme of\nobliterating the unprepossessing Conrad. A moment later he was glad that\nhe had, for it was not Conrad who entered, but a girl. She carried a\ntray which she set down on the table.\n\nIn the feeble light of the gas burner Tommy blinked at her. He decided\nat once that she was one of the most beautiful girls he had ever seen.\nHer hair was a full rich brown, with sudden glints of gold in it as\nthough there were imprisoned sunbeams struggling in its depths. There\nwas a wild-rose quality about her face. Her eyes, set wide apart, were\nhazel, a golden hazel that again recalled a memory of sunbeams.\n\nA delirious thought shot through Tommy's mind.\n\n\"Are you Jane Finn?\" he asked breathlessly.\n\nThe girl shook her head wonderingly.\n\n\"My name is Annette, monsieur.\"\n\nShe spoke in a soft, broken English.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tommy, rather taken aback. \"Francaise?\" he hazarded.\n\n\"Oui, monsieur. Monsieur parle francais?\"\n\n\"Not for any length of time,\" said Tommy. \"What's that? Breakfast?\"\n\nThe girl nodded. Tommy dropped off the bed and came and inspected the\ncontents of the tray. It consisted of a loaf, some margarine, and a jug\nof coffee.\n\n\"The living is not equal to the Ritz,\" he observed with a sigh. \"But\nfor what we are at last about to receive the Lord has made me truly\nthankful. Amen.\"\n\nHe drew up a chair, and the girl turned away to the door.\n\n\"Wait a sec,\" cried Tommy. \"There are lots of things I want to ask you,\nAnnette. What are you doing in this house? Don't tell me you're Conrad's\nniece, or daughter, or anything, because I can't believe it.\"\n\n\"I do the SERVICE, monsieur. I am not related to anybody.\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Tommy. \"You know what I asked you just now. Have you ever\nheard that name?\"\n\n\"I have heard people speak of Jane Finn, I think.\"\n\n\"You don't know where she is?\"\n\nAnnette shook her head.\n\n\"She's not in this house, for instance?\"\n\n\"Oh no, monsieur. I must go now--they will be waiting for me.\"\n\nShe hurried out. The key turned in the lock.\n\n\"I wonder who 'they' are,\" mused Tommy, as he continued to make inroads\non the loaf. \"With a bit of luck, that girl might help me to get out of\nhere. She doesn't look like one of the gang.\"\n\nAt one o'clock Annette reappeared with another tray, but this time\nConrad accompanied her.\n\n\"Good morning,\" said Tommy amiably. \"You have NOT used Pear's soap, I\nsee.\"\n\nConrad growled threateningly.\n\n\"No light repartee, have you, old bean? There, there, we can't always\nhave brains as well as beauty. What have we for lunch? Stew? How did I\nknow? Elementary, my dear Watson--the smell of onions is unmistakable.\"\n\n\"Talk away,\" grunted the man. \"It's little enough time you'll have to\ntalk in, maybe.\"\n\nThe remark was unpleasant in its suggestion, but Tommy ignored it. He\nsat down at the table.\n\n\"Retire, varlet,\" he said, with a wave of his hand. \"Prate not to thy\nbetters.\"\n\nThat evening Tommy sat on the bed, and cogitated deeply. Would Conrad\nagain accompany the girl? If he did not, should he risk trying to make\nan ally of her? He decided that he must leave no stone unturned. His\nposition was desperate.\n\nAt eight o'clock the familiar sound of the key turning made him spring\nto his feet. The girl was alone.\n\n\"Shut the door,\" he commanded. \"I want to speak to you.\" She obeyed.\n\n\"Look here, Annette, I want you to help me get out of this.\" She shook\nher head.\n\n\"Impossible. There are three of them on the floor below.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Tommy was secretly grateful for the information. \"But you would\nhelp me if you could?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nThe girl hesitated.\n\n\"I think--they are my own people. You have spied upon them. They are\nquite right to keep you here.\"\n\n\"They're a bad lot, Annette. If you'll help me, I'll take you away from\nthe lot of them. And you'd probably get a good whack of money.\"\n\nBut the girl merely shook her head.\n\n\"I dare not, monsieur; I am afraid of them.\"\n\nShe turned away.\n\n\"Wouldn't you do anything to help another girl?\" cried Tommy. \"She's\nabout your age too. Won't you save her from their clutches?\"\n\n\"You mean Jane Finn?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It is her you came here to look for? Yes?\"\n\n\"That's it.\"\n\nThe girl looked at him, then passed her hand across her forehead.\n\n\"Jane Finn. Always I hear that name. It is familiar.\"\n\nTommy came forward eagerly.\n\n\"You must know SOMETHING about her?\"\n\nBut the girl turned away abruptly.\n\n\"I know nothing--only the name.\" She walked towards the door. Suddenly\nshe uttered a cry. Tommy stared. She had caught sight of the picture\nhe had laid against the wall the night before. For a moment he caught a\nlook of terror in her eyes. As inexplicably it changed to relief. Then\nabruptly she went out of the room. Tommy could make nothing of it. Did\nshe fancy that he had meant to attack her with it? Surely not. He rehung\nthe picture on the wall thoughtfully.\n\nThree more days went by in dreary inaction. Tommy felt the strain\ntelling on his nerves. He saw no one but Conrad and Annette, and the\ngirl had become dumb. She spoke only in monosyllables. A kind of dark\nsuspicion smouldered in her eyes. Tommy felt that if this solitary\nconfinement went on much longer he would go mad. He gathered from Conrad\nthat they were waiting for orders from \"Mr. Brown.\" Perhaps, thought\nTommy, he was abroad or away, and they were obliged to wait for his\nreturn.\n\nBut the evening of the third day brought a rude awakening.\n\nIt was barely seven o'clock when he heard the tramp of footsteps outside\nin the passage. In another minute the door was flung open. Conrad\nentered. With him was the evil-looking Number 14. Tommy's heart sank at\nthe sight of them.\n\n\"Evenin', gov'nor,\" said the man with a leer. \"Got those ropes, mate?\"\n\nThe silent Conrad produced a length of fine cord. The next minute Number\n14's hands, horribly dexterous, were winding the cord round his limbs,\nwhile Conrad held him down.\n\n\"What the devil----?\" began Tommy.\n\nBut the slow, speechless grin of the silent Conrad froze the words on\nhis lips.\n\nNumber 14 proceeded deftly with his task. In another minute Tommy was a\nmere helpless bundle. Then at last Conrad spoke:\n\n\"Thought you'd bluffed us, did you? With what you knew, and what you\ndidn't know. Bargained with us! And all the time it was bluff! Bluff!\nYou know less than a kitten. But your number's up now all right, you\nb---- swine.\"\n\nTommy lay silent. There was nothing to say. He had failed. Somehow\nor other the omnipotent Mr. Brown had seen through his pretensions.\nSuddenly a thought occurred to him.\n\n\"A very good speech, Conrad,\" he said approvingly. \"But wherefore the\nbonds and fetters? Why not let this kind gentleman here cut my throat\nwithout delay?\"\n\n\"Garn,\" said Number 14 unexpectedly. \"Think we're as green as to do you\nin here, and have the police nosing round? Not 'alf! We've ordered the\ncarriage for your lordship to-morrow mornin', but in the meantime we're\nnot taking any chances, see!\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Tommy, \"could be plainer than your words--unless it was\nyour face.\"\n\n\"Stow it,\" said Number 14.\n\n\"With pleasure,\" replied Tommy. \"You're making a sad mistake--but yours\nwill be the loss.\"\n\n\"You don't kid us that way again,\" said Number 14. \"Talking as though\nyou were still at the blooming Ritz, aren't you?\"\n\nTommy made no reply. He was engaged in wondering how Mr. Brown had\ndiscovered his identity. He decided that Tuppence, in the throes of\nanxiety, had gone to the police, and that his disappearance having been\nmade public the gang had not been slow to put two and two together.\n\nThe two men departed and the door slammed. Tommy was left to his\nmeditations. They were not pleasant ones. Already his limbs felt cramped\nand stiff. He was utterly helpless, and he could see no hope anywhere.\n\nAbout an hour had passed when he heard the key softly turned, and the\ndoor opened. It was Annette. Tommy's heart beat a little faster. He had\nforgotten the girl. Was it possible that she had come to his help?\n\nSuddenly he heard Conrad's voice:\n\n\"Come out of it, Annette. He doesn't want any supper to-night.\"\n\n\"Oui, oui, je sais bien. But I must take the other tray. We need the\nthings on it.\"\n\n\"Well, hurry up,\" growled Conrad.\n\nWithout looking at Tommy the girl went over to the table, and picked up\nthe tray. She raised a hand and turned out the light.\n\n\"Curse you\"--Conrad had come to the door--\"why did you do that?\"\n\n\"I always turn it out. You should have told me. Shall I relight it,\nMonsieur Conrad?\"\n\n\"No, come on out of it.\"\n\n\"Le beau petit monsieur,\" cried Annette, pausing by the bed in the\ndarkness. \"You have tied him up well, hein? He is like a trussed\nchicken!\" The frank amusement in her tone jarred on the boy; but at\nthat moment, to his amazement, he felt her hand running lightly over\nhis bonds, and something small and cold was pressed into the palm of his\nhand.\n\n\"Come on, Annette.\"\n\n\"Mais me voila.\"\n\nThe door shut. Tommy heard Conrad say:\n\n\"Lock it and give me the key.\"\n\nThe footsteps died away. Tommy lay petrified with amazement. The object\nAnnette had thrust into his hand was a small penknife, the blade open.\nFrom the way she had studiously avoided looking at him, and her action\nwith the light, he came to the conclusion that the room was overlooked.\nThere must be a peep-hole somewhere in the walls. Remembering how\nguarded she had always been in her manner, he saw that he had probably\nbeen under observation all the time. Had he said anything to give\nhimself away? Hardly. He had revealed a wish to escape and a desire\nto find Jane Finn, but nothing that could have given a clue to his\nown identity. True, his question to Annette had proved that he was\npersonally unacquainted with Jane Finn, but he had never pretended\notherwise. The question now was, did Annette really know more? Were her\ndenials intended primarily for the listeners? On that point he could\ncome to no conclusion.\n\nBut there was a more vital question that drove out all others. Could he,\nbound as he was, manage to cut his bonds? He essayed cautiously to\nrub the open blade up and down on the cord that bound his two wrists\ntogether. It was an awkward business, and drew a smothered \"Ow\" of pain\nfrom him as the knife cut into his wrist. But slowly and doggedly he\nwent on sawing to and fro. He cut the flesh badly, but at last he felt\nthe cord slacken. With his hands free, the rest was easy. Five minutes\nlater he stood upright with some difficulty, owing to the cramp in his\nlimbs. His first care was to bind up his bleeding wrist. Then he sat on\nthe edge of the bed to think. Conrad had taken the key of the door, so\nhe could expect little more assistance from Annette. The only outlet\nfrom the room was the door, consequently he would perforce have to wait\nuntil the two men returned to fetch him. But when they did... Tommy\nsmiled! Moving with infinite caution in the dark room, he found and\nunhooked the famous picture. He felt an economical pleasure that his\nfirst plan would not be wasted. There was now nothing to do but to wait.\nHe waited.\n\nThe night passed slowly. Tommy lived through an eternity of hours, but\nat last he heard footsteps. He stood upright, drew a deep breath, and\nclutched the picture firmly.\n\nThe door opened. A faint light streamed in from outside. Conrad went\nstraight towards the gas to light it. Tommy deeply regretted that it was\nhe who had entered first. It would have been pleasant to get even with\nConrad. Number 14 followed. As he stepped across the threshold, Tommy\nbrought the picture down with terrific force on his head. Number 14 went\ndown amidst a stupendous crash of broken glass. In a minute Tommy had\nslipped out and pulled to the door. The key was in the lock. He turned\nit and withdrew it just as Conrad hurled himself against the door from\nthe inside with a volley of curses.\n\nFor a moment Tommy hesitated. There was the sound of some one stirring\non the floor below. Then the German's voice came up the stairs.\n\n\"Gott im Himmel! Conrad, what is it?\"\n\nTommy felt a small hand thrust into his. Beside him stood Annette. She\npointed up a rickety ladder that apparently led to some attics.\n\n\"Quick--up here!\" She dragged him after her up the ladder. In another\nmoment they were standing in a dusty garret littered with lumber. Tommy\nlooked round.\n\n\"This won't do. It's a regular trap. There's no way out.\"\n\n\"Hush! Wait.\" The girl put her finger to her lips. She crept to the top\nof the ladder and listened.\n\nThe banging and beating on the door was terrific. The German and another\nwere trying to force the door in. Annette explained in a whisper:\n\n\"They will think you are still inside. They cannot hear what Conrad\nsays. The door is too thick.\"\n\n\"I thought you could hear what went on in the room?\"\n\n\"There is a peep-hole into the next room. It was clever of you to guess.\nBut they will not think of that--they are only anxious to get in.\"\n\n\"Yes--but look here----\"\n\n\"Leave it to me.\" She bent down. To his amazement, Tommy saw that she\nwas fastening the end of a long piece of string to the handle of a big\ncracked jug. She arranged it carefully, then turned to Tommy.\n\n\"Have you the key of the door?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Give it to me.\"\n\nHe handed it to her.\n\n\"I am going down. Do you think you can go halfway, and then swing\nyourself down BEHIND the ladder, so that they will not see you?\"\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n\"There's a big cupboard in the shadow of the landing. Stand behind\nit. Take the end of this string in your hand. When I've let the others\nout--PULL!\"\n\nBefore he had time to ask her anything more, she had flitted lightly\ndown the ladder and was in the midst of the group with a loud cry:\n\n\"Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Qu'est-ce qu'il y a?\"\n\nThe German turned on her with an oath.\n\n\"Get out of this. Go to your room!\"\n\nVery cautiously Tommy swung himself down the back of the ladder. So\nlong as they did not turn round... all was well. He crouched behind the\ncupboard. They were still between him and the stairs.\n\n\"AH!\" Annette appeared to stumble over something. She stooped. \"Mon\nDieu, voila la clef!\"\n\nThe German snatched it from her. He unlocked the door. Conrad stumbled\nout, swearing.\n\n\"Where is he? Have you got him?\"\n\n\"We have seen no one,\" said the German sharply. His face paled. \"Who do\nyou mean?\"\n\nConrad gave vent to another oath.\n\n\"He's got away.\"\n\n\"Impossible. He would have passed us.\"\n\nAt that moment, with an ecstatic smile Tommy pulled the string. A crash\nof crockery came from the attic above. In a trice the men were pushing\neach other up the rickety ladder and had disappeared into the darkness\nabove.\n\nQuick as a flash Tommy leapt from his hiding-place and dashed down the\nstairs, pulling the girl with him. There was no one in the hall. He\nfumbled over the bolts and chain. At last they yielded, the door swung\nopen. He turned. Annette had disappeared.\n\nTommy stood spell-bound. Had she run upstairs again? What madness\npossessed her! He fumed with impatience, but he stood his ground. He\nwould not go without her.\n\nAnd suddenly there was an outcry overhead, an exclamation from the\nGerman, and then Annette's voice, clear and high:\n\n\"Ma foi, he has escaped! And quickly! Who would have thought it?\"\n\nTommy still stood rooted to the ground. Was that a command to him to go?\nHe fancied it was.\n\nAnd then, louder still, the words floated down to him:\n\n\"This is a terrible house. I want to go back to Marguerite. To\nMarguerite. TO MARGUERITE!\"\n\nTommy had run back to the stairs. She wanted him to go and leave her.\nBut why? At all costs he must try and get her away with him. Then his\nheart sank. Conrad was leaping down the stairs, uttering a savage cry at\nthe sight of him. After him came the others.\n\nTommy stopped Conrad's rush with a straight blow with his fist. It\ncaught the other on the point of the jaw and he fell like a log. The\nsecond man tripped over his body and fell. From higher up the staircase\nthere was a flash, and a bullet grazed Tommy's ear. He realized that\nit would be good for his health to get out of this house as soon as\npossible. As regards Annette he could do nothing. He had got even with\nConrad, which was one satisfaction. The blow had been a good one.\n\nHe leapt for the door, slamming it behind him. The square was deserted.\nIn front of the house was a baker's van. Evidently he was to have been\ntaken out of London in that, and his body found many miles from the\nhouse in Soho. The driver jumped to the pavement and tried to bar\nTommy's way. Again Tommy's fist shot out, and the driver sprawled on the\npavement.\n\nTommy took to his heels and ran--none too soon. The front door opened\nand a hail of bullets followed him. Fortunately none of them hit him. He\nturned the corner of the square.\n\n\"There's one thing,\" he thought to himself, \"they can't go on shooting.\nThey'll have the police after them if they do. I wonder they dared to\nthere.\"\n\nHe heard the footsteps of his pursuers behind him, and redoubled his own\npace. Once he got out of these by-ways he would be safe. There would be\na policeman about somewhere--not that he really wanted to invoke the aid\nof the police if he could possibly do without it. It meant explanations,\nand general awkwardness. In another moment he had reason to bless his\nluck. He stumbled over a prostrate figure, which started up with a yell\nof alarm and dashed off down the street. Tommy drew back into a doorway.\nIn a minute he had the pleasure of seeing his two pursuers, of whom the\nGerman was one, industriously tracking down the red herring!\n\nTommy sat down quietly on the doorstep and allowed a few moments to\nelapse while he recovered his breath. Then he strolled gently in the\nopposite direction. He glanced at his watch. It was a little after\nhalf-past five. It was rapidly growing light. At the next corner he\npassed a policeman. The policeman cast a suspicious eye on him. Tommy\nfelt slightly offended. Then, passing his hand over his face, he\nlaughed. He had not shaved or washed for three days! What a guy he must\nlook.\n\nHe betook himself without more ado to a Turkish Bath establishment which\nhe knew to be open all night. He emerged into the busy daylight feeling\nhimself once more, and able to make plans.\n\nFirst of all, he must have a square meal. He had eaten nothing since\nmidday yesterday. He turned into an A.B.C. shop and ordered eggs and\nbacon and coffee. Whilst he ate, he read a morning paper propped up\nin front of him. Suddenly he stiffened. There was a long article on\nKramenin, who was described as the \"man behind Bolshevism\" in Russia,\nand who had just arrived in London--some thought as an unofficial envoy.\nHis career was sketched lightly, and it was firmly asserted that he,\nand not the figurehead leaders, had been the author of the Russian\nRevolution.\n\nIn the centre of the page was his portrait.\n\n\"So that's who Number 1 is,\" said Tommy with his mouth full of eggs and\nbacon. \"Not a doubt about it, I must push on.\"\n\nHe paid for his breakfast, and betook himself to Whitehall. There he\nsent up his name, and the message that it was urgent. A few minutes\nlater he was in the presence of the man who did not here go by the name\nof \"Mr. Carter.\" There was a frown on his face.\n\n\"Look here, you've no business to come asking for me in this way. I\nthought that was distinctly understood?\"\n\n\"It was, sir. But I judged it important to lose no time.\"\n\nAnd as briefly and succinctly as possible he detailed the experiences of\nthe last few days.\n\nHalf-way through, Mr. Carter interrupted him to give a few cryptic\norders through the telephone. All traces of displeasure had now left his\nface. He nodded energetically when Tommy had finished.\n\n\"Quite right. Every moment's of value. Fear we shall be too late anyway.\nThey wouldn't wait. Would clear out at once. Still, they may have left\nsomething behind them that will be a clue. You say you've recognized\nNumber 1 to be Kramenin? That's important. We want something against him\nbadly to prevent the Cabinet falling on his neck too freely. What about\nthe others? You say two faces were familiar to you? One's a Labour man,\nyou think? Just look through these photos, and see if you can spot him.\"\n\nA minute later, Tommy held one up. Mr. Carter exhibited some surprise.\n\n\"Ah, Westway! Shouldn't have thought it. Poses as being moderate. As for\nthe other fellow, I think I can give a good guess.\" He handed another\nphotograph to Tommy, and smiled at the other's exclamation. \"I'm right,\nthen. Who is he? Irishman. Prominent Unionist M.P. All a blind, of\ncourse. We've suspected it--but couldn't get any proof. Yes, you've done\nvery well, young man. The 29th, you say, is the date. That gives us very\nlittle time--very little time indeed.\"\n\n\"But----\" Tommy hesitated.\n\nMr. Carter read his thoughts.\n\n\"We can deal with the General Strike menace, I think. It's a\ntoss-up--but we've got a sporting chance! But if that draft treaty turns\nup--we're done. England will be plunged in anarchy. Ah, what's that?\nThe car? Come on, Beresford, we'll go and have a look at this house of\nyours.\"\n\nTwo constables were on duty in front of the house in Soho. An inspector\nreported to Mr. Carter in a low voice. The latter turned to Tommy.\n\n\"The birds have flown--as we thought. We might as well go over it.\"\n\nGoing over the deserted house seemed to Tommy to partake of the\ncharacter of a dream. Everything was just as it had been. The prison\nroom with the crooked pictures, the broken jug in the attic, the meeting\nroom with its long table. But nowhere was there a trace of papers.\nEverything of that kind had either been destroyed or taken away. And\nthere was no sign of Annette.\n\n\"What you tell me about the girl puzzled me,\" said Mr. Carter. \"You\nbelieve that she deliberately went back?\"\n\n\"It would seem so, sir. She ran upstairs while I was getting the door\nopen.\"\n\n\"H'm, she must belong to the gang, then; but, being a woman, didn't feel\nlike standing by to see a personable young man killed. But evidently\nshe's in with them, or she wouldn't have gone back.\"\n\n\"I can't believe she's really one of them, sir. She--seemed so\ndifferent----\"\n\n\"Good-looking, I suppose?\" said Mr. Carter with a smile that made Tommy\nflush to the roots of his hair. He admitted Annette's beauty rather\nshamefacedly.\n\n\"By the way,\" observed Mr. Carter, \"have you shown yourself to Miss\nTuppence yet? She's been bombarding me with letters about you.\"\n\n\"Tuppence? I was afraid she might get a bit rattled. Did she go to the\npolice?\"\n\nMr. Carter shook his head.\n\n\"Then I wonder how they twigged me.\"\n\nMr. Carter looked inquiringly at him, and Tommy explained. The other\nnodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"True, that's rather a curious point. Unless the mention of the Ritz was\nan accidental remark?\"\n\n\"It might have been, sir. But they must have found out about me suddenly\nin some way.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Carter, looking round him, \"there's nothing more to be\ndone here. What about some lunch with me?\"\n\n\"Thanks awfully, sir. But I think I'd better get back and rout out\nTuppence.\"\n\n\"Of course. Give her my kind regards and tell her not to believe you're\nkilled too readily next time.\"\n\nTommy grinned.\n\n\"I take a lot of killing, sir.\"\n\n\"So I perceive,\" said Mr. Carter dryly. \"Well, good-bye. Remember you're\na marked man now, and take reasonable care of yourself.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\nHailing a taxi briskly Tommy stepped in, and was swiftly borne to the\nRitz, dwelling the while on the pleasurable anticipation of startling\nTuppence.\n\n\"Wonder what she's been up to. Dogging 'Rita' most likely. By the way,\nI suppose that's who Annette meant by Marguerite. I didn't get it at the\ntime.\" The thought saddened him a little, for it seemed to prove that\nMrs. Vandemeyer and the girl were on intimate terms.\n\nThe taxi drew up at the Ritz. Tommy burst into its sacred portals\neagerly, but his enthusiasm received a check. He was informed that Miss\nCowley had gone out a quarter of an hour ago.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. THE TELEGRAM\n\nBAFFLED for the moment, Tommy strolled into the restaurant, and ordered\na meal of surpassing excellence. His four days' imprisonment had taught\nhim anew to value good food.\n\nHe was in the middle of conveying a particularly choice morsel of Sole\na la Jeanette to his mouth, when he caught sight of Julius entering the\nroom. Tommy waved a menu cheerfully, and succeeded in attracting the\nother's attention. At the sight of Tommy, Julius's eyes seemed as though\nthey would pop out of his head. He strode across, and pump-handled\nTommy's hand with what seemed to the latter quite unnecessary vigour.\n\n\"Holy snakes!\" he ejaculated. \"Is it really you?\"\n\n\"Of course it is. Why shouldn't it be?\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't it be? Say, man, don't you know you've been given up\nfor dead? I guess we'd have had a solemn requiem for you in another few\ndays.\"\n\n\"Who thought I was dead?\" demanded Tommy.\n\n\"Tuppence.\"\n\n\"She remembered the proverb about the good dying young, I suppose. There\nmust be a certain amount of original sin in me to have survived. Where\nis Tuppence, by the way?\"\n\n\"Isn't she here?\"\n\n\"No, the fellows at the office said she'd just gone out.\"\n\n\"Gone shopping, I guess. I dropped her here in the car about an hour\nago. But, say, can't you shed that British calm of yours, and get down\nto it? What on God's earth have you been doing all this time?\"\n\n\"If you're feeding here,\" replied Tommy, \"order now. It's going to be a\nlong story.\"\n\nJulius drew up a chair to the opposite side of the table, summoned a\nhovering waiter, and dictated his wishes. Then he turned to Tommy.\n\n\"Fire ahead. I guess you've had some few adventures.\"\n\n\"One or two,\" replied Tommy modestly, and plunged into his recital.\n\nJulius listened spellbound. Half the dishes that were placed before him\nhe forgot to eat. At the end he heaved a long sigh.\n\n\"Bully for you. Reads like a dime novel!\"\n\n\"And now for the home front,\" said Tommy, stretching out his hand for a\npeach.\n\n\"We-el,\" drawled Julius, \"I don't mind admitting we've had some\nadventures too.\"\n\nHe, in his turn, assumed the role of narrator. Beginning with his\nunsuccessful reconnoitring at Bournemouth, he passed on to his return\nto London, the buying of the car, the growing anxieties of Tuppence,\nthe call upon Sir James, and the sensational occurrences of the previous\nnight.\n\n\"But who killed her?\" asked Tommy. \"I don't quite understand.\"\n\n\"The doctor kidded himself she took it herself,\" replied Julius dryly.\n\n\"And Sir James? What did he think?\"\n\n\"Being a legal luminary, he is likewise a human oyster,\" replied Julius.\n\"I should say he 'reserved judgment.'\" He went on to detail the events\nof the morning.\n\n\"Lost her memory, eh?\" said Tommy with interest. \"By Jove, that explains\nwhy they looked at me so queerly when I spoke of questioning her. Bit of\na slip on my part, that! But it wasn't the sort of thing a fellow would\nbe likely to guess.\"\n\n\"They didn't give you any sort of hint as to where Jane was?\"\n\nTommy shook his head regretfully.\n\n\"Not a word. I'm a bit of an ass, as you know. I ought to have got more\nout of them somehow.\"\n\n\"I guess you're lucky to be here at all. That bluff of yours was the\ngoods all right. How you ever came to think of it all so pat beats me to\na frazzle!\"\n\n\"I was in such a funk I had to think of something,\" said Tommy simply.\n\nThere was a moment's pause, and then Tommy reverted to Mrs. Vandemeyer's\ndeath.\n\n\"There's no doubt it was chloral?\"\n\n\"I believe not. At least they call it heart failure induced by an\noverdose, or some such claptrap. It's all right. We don't want to\nbe worried with an inquest. But I guess Tuppence and I and even the\nhighbrow Sir James have all got the same idea.\"\n\n\"Mr. Brown?\" hazarded Tommy.\n\n\"Sure thing.\"\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n\"All the same,\" he said thoughtfully, \"Mr. Brown hasn't got wings. I\ndon't see how he got in and out.\"\n\n\"How about some high-class thought transference stunt? Some magnetic\ninfluence that irresistibly impelled Mrs. Vandemeyer to commit suicide?\"\n\nTommy looked at him with respect.\n\n\"Good, Julius. Distinctly good. Especially the phraseology. But it\nleaves me cold. I yearn for a real Mr. Brown of flesh and blood. I think\nthe gifted young detectives must get to work, study the entrances and\nexits, and tap the bumps on their foreheads until the solution of the\nmystery dawns on them. Let's go round to the scene of the crime. I wish\nwe could get hold of Tuppence. The Ritz would enjoy the spectacle of the\nglad reunion.\"\n\nInquiry at the office revealed the fact that Tuppence had not yet\nreturned.\n\n\"All the same, I guess I'll have a look round upstairs,\" said Julius.\n\"She might be in my sitting-room.\" He disappeared.\n\nSuddenly a diminutive boy spoke at Tommy's elbow:\n\n\"The young lady--she's gone away by train, I think, sir,\" he murmured\nshyly.\n\n\"What?\" Tommy wheeled round upon him.\n\nThe small boy became pinker than before.\n\n\"The taxi, sir. I heard her tell the driver Charing Cross and to look\nsharp.\"\n\nTommy stared at him, his eyes opening wide in surprise. Emboldened, the\nsmall boy proceeded. \"So I thought, having asked for an A.B.C. and a\nBradshaw.\"\n\nTommy interrupted him:\n\n\"When did she ask for an A.B.C. and a Bradshaw?\"\n\n\"When I took her the telegram, sir.\"\n\n\"A telegram?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"When was that?\"\n\n\"About half-past twelve, sir.\"\n\n\"Tell me exactly what happened.\"\n\nThe small boy drew a long breath.\n\n\"I took up a telegram to No. 891--the lady was there. She opened it\nand gave a gasp, and then she said, very jolly like: 'Bring me up a\nBradshaw, and an A.B.C., and look sharp, Henry.' My name isn't Henry,\nbut----\"\n\n\"Never mind your name,\" said Tommy impatiently. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I brought them, and she told me to wait, and looked up\nsomething. And then she looks up at the clock, and 'Hurry up,' she says.\n'Tell them to get me a taxi,' and she begins a-shoving on of her hat in\nfront of the glass, and she was down in two ticks, almost as quick as I\nwas, and I seed her going down the steps and into the taxi, and I heard\nher call out what I told you.\"\n\nThe small boy stopped and replenished his lungs. Tommy continued to\nstare at him. At that moment Julius rejoined him. He held an open letter\nin his hand.\n\n\"I say, Hersheimmer\"--Tommy turned to him--\"Tuppence has gone off\nsleuthing on her own.\"\n\n\"Shucks!\"\n\n\"Yes, she has. She went off in a taxi to Charing Cross in the deuce of a\nhurry after getting a telegram.\" His eye fell on the letter in Julius's\nhand. \"Oh; she left a note for you. That's all right. Where's she off\nto?\"\n\nAlmost unconsciously, he held out his hand for the letter, but\nJulius folded it up and placed it in his pocket. He seemed a trifle\nembarrassed.\n\n\"I guess this is nothing to do with it. It's about something\nelse--something I asked her that she was to let me know about.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Tommy looked puzzled, and seemed waiting for more.\n\n\"See here,\" said Julius suddenly, \"I'd better put you wise. I asked Miss\nTuppence to marry me this morning.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tommy mechanically. He felt dazed. Julius's words were\ntotally unexpected. For the moment they benumbed his brain.\n\n\"I'd like to tell you,\" continued Julius, \"that before I suggested\nanything of the kind to Miss Tuppence, I made it clear that I didn't\nwant to butt in in any way between her and you----\"\n\nTommy roused himself.\n\n\"That's all right,\" he said quickly. \"Tuppence and I have been pals for\nyears. Nothing more.\" He lit a cigarette with a hand that shook ever\nso little. \"That's quite all right. Tuppence always said that she was\nlooking out for----\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly, his face crimsoning, but Julius was in no way\ndiscomposed.\n\n\"Oh, I guess it'll be the dollars that'll do the trick. Miss Tuppence\nput me wise to that right away. There's no humbug about her. We ought to\ngee along together very well.\"\n\nTommy looked at him curiously for a minute, as though he were about\nto speak, then changed his mind and said nothing. Tuppence and Julius!\nWell, why not? Had she not lamented the fact that she knew no rich men?\nHad she not openly avowed her intention of marrying for money if she\never had the chance? Her meeting with the young American millionaire\nhad given her the chance--and it was unlikely she would be slow to avail\nherself of it. She was out for money. She had always said so. Why blame\nher because she had been true to her creed?\n\nNevertheless, Tommy did blame her. He was filled with a passionate and\nutterly illogical resentment. It was all very well to SAY things like\nthat--but a REAL girl would never marry for money. Tuppence was utterly\ncold-blooded and selfish, and he would be delighted if he never saw her\nagain! And it was a rotten world!\n\nJulius's voice broke in on these meditations.\n\n\"Yes, we ought to get along together very well. I've heard that a girl\nalways refuses you once--a sort of convention.\"\n\nTommy caught his arm.\n\n\"Refuses? Did you say REFUSES?\"\n\n\"Sure thing. Didn't I tell you that? She just rapped out a 'no' without\nany kind of reason to it. The eternal feminine, the Huns call it, I've\nheard. But she'll come round right enough. Likely enough, I hustled her\nsome----\"\n\nBut Tommy interrupted regardless of decorum.\n\n\"What did she say in that note?\" he demanded fiercely.\n\nThe obliging Julius handed it to him.\n\n\"There's no earthly clue in it as to where she's gone,\" he assured\nTommy. \"But you might as well see for yourself if you don't believe me.\"\n\nThe note, in Tuppence's well-known schoolboy writing, ran as follows:\n\n\n\"DEAR JULIUS,\n\n\"It's always better to have things in black and white. I don't feel I\ncan be bothered to think of marriage until Tommy is found. Let's leave\nit till then.\n\n\"Yours affectionately,\n\n\"TUPPENCE.\"\n\n\nTommy handed it back, his eyes shining. His feelings had undergone a\nsharp reaction. He now felt that Tuppence was all that was noble and\ndisinterested. Had she not refused Julius without hesitation? True, the\nnote betokened signs of weakening, but he could excuse that. It read\nalmost like a bribe to Julius to spur him on in his efforts to find\nTommy, but he supposed she had not really meant it that way. Darling\nTuppence, there was not a girl in the world to touch her! When he saw\nher----His thoughts were brought up with a sudden jerk.\n\n\"As you say,\" he remarked, pulling himself together, \"there's not a hint\nhere as to what she's up to. Hi--Henry!\"\n\nThe small boy came obediently. Tommy produced five shillings.\n\n\"One thing more. Do you remember what the young lady did with the\ntelegram?\"\n\nHenry gasped and spoke.\n\n\"She crumpled it up into a ball and threw it into the grate, and made a\nsort of noise like 'Whoop!' sir.\"\n\n\"Very graphic, Henry,\" said Tommy. \"Here's your five shillings. Come on,\nJulius. We must find that telegram.\"\n\nThey hurried upstairs. Tuppence had left the key in her door. The room\nwas as she had left it. In the fireplace was a crumpled ball of orange\nand white. Tommy disentangled it and smoothed out the telegram.\n\n\"Come at once, Moat House, Ebury, Yorkshire, great developments--TOMMY.\"\n\nThey looked at each other in stupefaction. Julius spoke first:\n\n\"You didn't send it?\"\n\n\"Of course not. What does it mean?\"\n\n\"I guess it means the worst,\" said Julius quietly. \"They've got her.\"\n\n\"WHAT?\"\n\n\"Sure thing! They signed your name, and she fell into the trap like a\nlamb.\"\n\n\"My God! What shall we do?\"\n\n\"Get busy, and go after her! Right now! There's no time to waste. It's\nalmighty luck that she didn't take the wire with her. If she had we'd\nprobably never have traced her. But we've got to hustle. Where's that\nBradshaw?\"\n\nThe energy of Julius was infectious. Left to himself, Tommy would\nprobably have sat down to think things out for a good half-hour before\nhe decided on a plan of action. But with Julius Hersheimmer about,\nhustling was inevitable.\n\nAfter a few muttered imprecations he handed the Bradshaw to Tommy as\nbeing more conversant with its mysteries. Tommy abandoned it in favour\nof an A.B.C.\n\n\"Here we are. Ebury, Yorks. From King's Cross. Or St. Pancras. (Boy must\nhave made a mistake. It was King's Cross, not CHARING Cross.) 12.50,\nthat's the train she went by. 2.10, that's gone. 3.20 is the next--and a\ndamned slow train too.\"\n\n\"What about the car?\"\n\nTommy shook his head.\n\n\"Send it up if you like, but we'd better stick to the train. The great\nthing is to keep calm.\"\n\nJulius groaned.\n\n\"That's so. But it gets my goat to think of that innocent young girl in\ndanger!\"\n\nTommy nodded abstractedly. He was thinking. In a moment or two, he said:\n\n\"I say, Julius, what do they want her for, anyway?\"\n\n\"Eh? I don't get you?\"\n\n\"What I mean is that I don't think it's their game to do her any harm,\"\nexplained Tommy, puckering his brow with the strain of his mental\nprocesses. \"She's a hostage, that's what she is. She's in no immediate\ndanger, because if we tumble on to anything, she'd be damned useful to\nthem. As long as they've got her, they've got the whip hand of us. See?\"\n\n\"Sure thing,\" said Julius thoughtfully. \"That's so.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" added Tommy, as an afterthought, \"I've great faith in\nTuppence.\"\n\nThe journey was wearisome, with many stops, and crowded carriages. They\nhad to change twice, once at Doncaster, once at a small junction. Ebury\nwas a deserted station with a solitary porter, to whom Tommy addressed\nhimself:\n\n\"Can you tell me the way to the Moat House?\"\n\n\"The Moat House? It's a tidy step from here. The big house near the sea,\nyou mean?\"\n\nTommy assented brazenly. After listening to the porter's meticulous\nbut perplexing directions, they prepared to leave the station. It was\nbeginning to rain, and they turned up the collars of their coats as they\ntrudged through the slush of the road. Suddenly Tommy halted.\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" He ran back to the station and tackled the porter anew.\n\n\"Look here, do you remember a young lady who arrived by an earlier\ntrain, the 12.50 from London? She'd probably ask you the way to the Moat\nHouse.\"\n\nHe described Tuppence as well as he could, but the porter shook his\nhead. Several people had arrived by the train in question. He could not\ncall to mind one young lady in particular. But he was quite certain that\nno one had asked him the way to the Moat House.\n\nTommy rejoined Julius, and explained. Depression was settling on him\nlike a leaden weight. He felt convinced that their quest was going to\nbe unsuccessful. The enemy had over three hours' start. Three hours was\nmore than enough for Mr. Brown. He would not ignore the possibility of\nthe telegram having been found.\n\nThe way seemed endless. Once they took the wrong turning and went nearly\nhalf a mile out of their direction. It was past seven o'clock when a\nsmall boy told them that \"t' Moat House\" was just past the next corner.\n\nA rusty iron gate swinging dismally on its hinges! An overgrown drive\nthick with leaves. There was something about the place that struck a\nchill to both their hearts. They went up the deserted drive. The leaves\ndeadened their footsteps. The daylight was almost gone. It was like\nwalking in a world of ghosts. Overhead the branches flapped and creaked\nwith a mournful note. Occasionally a sodden leaf drifted silently down,\nstartling them with its cold touch on their cheek.\n\nA turn of the drive brought them in sight of the house. That, too,\nseemed empty and deserted. The shutters were closed, the steps up to\nthe door overgrown with moss. Was it indeed to this desolate spot\nthat Tuppence had been decoyed? It seemed hard to believe that a human\nfootstep had passed this way for months.\n\nJulius jerked the rusty bell handle. A jangling peal rang discordantly,\nechoing through the emptiness within. No one came. They rang again and\nagain--but there was no sign of life. Then they walked completely round\nthe house. Everywhere silence, and shuttered windows. If they could\nbelieve the evidence of their eyes the place was empty.\n\n\"Nothing doing,\" said Julius.\n\nThey retraced their steps slowly to the gate.\n\n\"There must be a village handy,\" continued the young American. \"We'd\nbetter make inquiries there. They'll know something about the place, and\nwhether there's been anyone there lately.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's not a bad idea.\"\n\nProceeding up the road, they soon came to a little hamlet. On the\noutskirts of it, they met a workman swinging his bag of tools, and Tommy\nstopped him with a question.\n\n\"The Moat House? It's empty. Been empty for years. Mrs. Sweeny's got the\nkey if you want to go over it--next to the post office.\"\n\nTommy thanked him. They soon found the post office, which was also a\nsweet and general fancy shop, and knocked at the door of the cottage\nnext to it. A clean, wholesome-looking woman opened it. She readily\nproduced the key of the Moat House.\n\n\"Though I doubt if it's the kind of place to suit you, sir. In a\nterrible state of repair. Ceilings leaking and all. 'Twould need a lot\nof money spent on it.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" said Tommy cheerily. \"I dare say it'll be a washout, but\nhouses are scarce nowadays.\"\n\n\"That they are,\" declared the woman heartily. \"My daughter and\nson-in-law have been looking for a decent cottage for I don't know how\nlong. It's all the war. Upset things terribly, it has. But excuse me,\nsir, it'll be too dark for you to see much of the house. Hadn't you\nbetter wait until to-morrow?\"\n\n\"That's all right. We'll have a look around this evening, anyway. We'd\nhave been here before only we lost our way. What's the best place to\nstay at for the night round here?\"\n\nMrs. Sweeny looked doubtful.\n\n\"There's the Yorkshire Arms, but it's not much of a place for gentlemen\nlike you.\"\n\n\"Oh, it will do very well. Thanks. By the way, you've not had a young\nlady here asking for this key to-day?\"\n\nThe woman shook her head.\n\n\"No one's been over the place for a long time.\"\n\n\"Thanks very much.\"\n\nThey retraced their steps to the Moat House. As the front door swung\nback on its hinges, protesting loudly, Julius struck a match and\nexamined the floor carefully. Then he shook his head.\n\n\"I'd swear no one's passed this way. Look at the dust. Thick. Not a sign\nof a footmark.\"\n\nThey wandered round the deserted house. Everywhere the same tale. Thick\nlayers of dust apparently undisturbed.\n\n\"This gets me,\" said Julius. \"I don't believe Tuppence was ever in this\nhouse.\"\n\n\"She must have been.\"\n\nJulius shook his head without replying.\n\n\"We'll go over it again to-morrow,\" said Tommy. \"Perhaps we'll see more\nin the daylight.\"\n\nOn the morrow they took up the search once more, and were reluctantly\nforced to the conclusion that the house had not been invaded for some\nconsiderable time. They might have left the village altogether but for\na fortunate discovery of Tommy's. As they were retracing their steps to\nthe gate, he gave a sudden cry, and stooping, picked something up from\namong the leaves, and held it out to Julius. It was a small gold brooch.\n\n\"That's Tuppence's!\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. I've often seen her wear it.\"\n\nJulius drew a deep breath.\n\n\"I guess that settles it. She came as far as here, anyway. We'll make\nthat pub our head-quarters, and raise hell round here until we find her.\nSomebody MUST have seen her.\"\n\nForthwith the campaign began. Tommy and Julius worked separately and\ntogether, but the result was the same. Nobody answering to Tuppence's\ndescription had been seen in the vicinity. They were baffled--but not\ndiscouraged. Finally they altered their tactics. Tuppence had certainly\nnot remained long in the neighbourhood of the Moat House. That pointed\nto her having been overcome and carried away in a car. They renewed\ninquiries. Had anyone seen a car standing somewhere near the Moat House\nthat day? Again they met with no success.\n\nJulius wired to town for his own car, and they scoured the neighbourhood\ndaily with unflagging zeal. A grey limousine on which they had set high\nhopes was traced to Harrogate, and turned out to be the property of a\nhighly respectable maiden lady!\n\nEach day saw them set out on a new quest. Julius was like a hound on\nthe leash. He followed up the slenderest clue. Every car that had passed\nthrough the village on the fateful day was tracked down. He forced his\nway into country properties and submitted the owners of the motors to\na searching cross-examination. His apologies were as thorough as his\nmethods, and seldom failed in disarming the indignation of his victims;\nbut, as day succeeded day, they were no nearer to discovering Tuppence's\nwhereabouts. So well had the abduction been planned that the girl seemed\nliterally to have vanished into thin air.\n\nAnd another preoccupation was weighing on Tommy's mind.\n\n\"Do you know how long we've been here?\" he asked one morning as they\nsat facing each other at breakfast. \"A week! We're no nearer to finding\nTuppence, and NEXT SUNDAY IS THE 29TH!\"\n\n\"Shucks!\" said Julius thoughtfully. \"I'd almost forgotten about the\n29th. I've been thinking of nothing but Tuppence.\"\n\n\"So have I. At least, I hadn't forgotten about the 29th, but it didn't\nseem to matter a damn in comparison to finding Tuppence. But to-day's\nthe 23rd, and time's getting short. If we're ever going to get hold of\nher at all, we must do it before the 29th--her life won't be worth an\nhour's purchase afterwards. The hostage game will be played out by then.\nI'm beginning to feel that we've made a big mistake in the way we've set\nabout this. We've wasted time and we're no forrader.\"\n\n\"I'm with you there. We've been a couple of mutts, who've bitten off a\nbigger bit than they can chew. I'm going to quit fooling right away!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you. I'm going to do what we ought to have done a week ago.\nI'm going right back to London to put the case in the hands of your\nBritish police. We fancied ourselves as sleuths. Sleuths! It was a piece\nof damn-fool foolishness! I'm through! I've had enough of it. Scotland\nYard for me!\"\n\n\"You're right,\" said Tommy slowly. \"I wish to God we'd gone there right\naway.\"\n\n\"Better late than never. We've been like a couple of babes playing 'Here\nwe go round the Mulberry Bush.' Now I'm going right along to Scotland\nYard to ask them to take me by the hand and show me the way I should go.\nI guess the professional always scores over the amateur in the end. Are\nyou coming along with me?\"\n\nTommy shook his head.\n\n\"What's the good? One of us is enough. I might as well stay here and\nnose round a bit longer. Something MIGHT turn up. One never knows.\"\n\n\"Sure thing. Well, so long. I'll be back in a couple of shakes with a\nfew inspectors along. I shall tell them to pick out their brightest and\nbest.\"\n\nBut the course of events was not to follow the plan Julius had laid\ndown. Later in the day Tommy received a wire:\n\n\n\"Join me Manchester Midland Hotel. Important news--JULIUS.\"\n\n\nAt 7:30 that night Tommy alighted from a slow cross-country train.\nJulius was on the platform.\n\n\"Thought you'd come by this train if you weren't out when my wire\narrived.\"\n\nTommy grasped him by the arm.\n\n\"What is it? Is Tuppence found?\"\n\nJulius shook his head.\n\n\"No. But I found this waiting in London. Just arrived.\"\n\nHe handed the telegraph form to the other. Tommy's eyes opened as he\nread:\n\n\n\"Jane Finn found. Come Manchester Midland Hotel immediately--PEEL\nEDGERTON.\"\n\n\nJulius took the form back and folded it up.\n\n\"Queer,\" he said thoughtfully. \"I thought that lawyer chap had quit!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. JANE FINN\n\n\"MY train got in half an hour ago,\" explained Julius, as he led the way\nout of the station. \"I reckoned you'd come by this before I left London,\nand wired accordingly to Sir James. He's booked rooms for us, and will\nbe round to dine at eight.\"\n\n\"What made you think he'd ceased to take any interest in the case?\"\nasked Tommy curiously.\n\n\"What he said,\" replied Julius dryly. \"The old bird's as close as an\noyster! Like all the darned lot of them, he wasn't going to commit\nhimself till he was sure he could deliver the goods.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Tommy thoughtfully.\n\nJulius turned on him.\n\n\"You wonder what?\"\n\n\"Whether that was his real reason.\"\n\n\"Sure. You bet your life it was.\"\n\nTommy shook his head unconvinced.\n\nSir James arrived punctually at eight o'clock, and Julius introduced\nTommy. Sir James shook hands with him warmly.\n\n\"I am delighted to make your acquaintance, Mr. Beresford. I have heard\nso much about you from Miss Tuppence\"--he smiled involuntarily--\"that it\nreally seems as though I already know you quite well.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Tommy with his cheerful grin. He scanned the\ngreat lawyer eagerly. Like Tuppence, he felt the magnetism of the\nother's personality. He was reminded of Mr. Carter. The two men, totally\nunlike so far as physical resemblance went, produced a similar effect.\nBeneath the weary manner of the one and the professional reserve of the\nother, lay the same quality of mind, keen-edged like a rapier.\n\nIn the meantime he was conscious of Sir James's close scrutiny. When the\nlawyer dropped his eyes the young man had the feeling that the other had\nread him through and through like an open book. He could not but wonder\nwhat the final judgment was, but there was little chance of learning\nthat. Sir James took in everything, but gave out only what he chose. A\nproof of that occurred almost at once.\n\nImmediately the first greetings were over Julius broke out into a flood\nof eager questions. How had Sir James managed to track the girl? Why had\nhe not let them know that he was still working on the case? And so on.\n\nSir James stroked his chin and smiled. At last he said:\n\n\"Just so, just so. Well, she's found. And that's the great thing, isn't\nit? Eh! Come now, that's the great thing?\"\n\n\"Sure it is. But just how did you strike her trail? Miss Tuppence and I\nthought you'd quit for good and all.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" The lawyer shot a lightning glance at him, then resumed operations\non his chin. \"You thought that, did you? Did you really? H'm, dear me.\"\n\n\"But I guess I can take it we were wrong,\" pursued Julius.\n\n\"Well, I don't know that I should go so far as to say that. But it's\ncertainly fortunate for all parties that we've managed to find the young\nlady.\"\n\n\"But where is she?\" demanded Julius, his thoughts flying off on another\ntack. \"I thought you'd be sure to bring her along?\"\n\n\"That would hardly be possible,\" said Sir James gravely.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because the young lady was knocked down in a street accident, and has\nsustained slight injuries to the head. She was taken to the infirmary,\nand on recovering consciousness gave her name as Jane Finn. When--ah!--I\nheard that, I arranged for her to be removed to the house of a\ndoctor--a friend of mine, and wired at once for you. She relapsed into\nunconsciousness and has not spoken since.\"\n\n\"She's not seriously hurt?\"\n\n\"Oh, a bruise and a cut or two; really, from a medical point of view,\nabsurdly slight injuries to have produced such a condition. Her state is\nprobably to be attributed to the mental shock consequent on recovering\nher memory.\"\n\n\"It's come back?\" cried Julius excitedly.\n\nSir James tapped the table rather impatiently.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, Mr. Hersheimmer, since she was able to give her real name.\nI thought you had appreciated that point.\"\n\n\"And you just happened to be on the spot,\" said Tommy. \"Seems quite like\na fairy tale.\"\n\nBut Sir James was far too wary to be drawn.\n\n\"Coincidences are curious things,\" he said dryly.\n\nNevertheless Tommy was now certain of what he had before only suspected.\nSir James's presence in Manchester was not accidental. Far from\nabandoning the case, as Julius supposed, he had by some means of his own\nsuccessfully run the missing girl to earth. The only thing that puzzled\nTommy was the reason for all this secrecy. He concluded that it was a\nfoible of the legal mind.\n\nJulius was speaking.\n\n\"After dinner,\" he announced, \"I shall go right away and see Jane.\"\n\n\"That will be impossible, I fear,\" said Sir James. \"It is very unlikely\nthey would allow her to see visitors at this time of night. I should\nsuggest to-morrow morning about ten o'clock.\"\n\nJulius flushed. There was something in Sir James which always stirred\nhim to antagonism. It was a conflict of two masterful personalities.\n\n\"All the same, I reckon I'll go round there to-night and see if I can't\nginger them up to break through their silly rules.\"\n\n\"It will be quite useless, Mr. Hersheimmer.\"\n\nThe words came out like the crack of a pistol, and Tommy looked up with\na start. Julius was nervous and excited. The hand with which he raised\nhis glass to his lips shook slightly, but his eyes held Sir James's\ndefiantly. For a moment the hostility between the two seemed likely to\nburst into flame, but in the end Julius lowered his eyes, defeated.\n\n\"For the moment, I reckon you're the boss.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the other. \"We will say ten o'clock then?\" With\nconsummate ease of manner he turned to Tommy. \"I must confess, Mr.\nBeresford, that it was something of a surprise to me to see you here\nthis evening. The last I heard of you was that your friends were in\ngrave anxiety on your behalf. Nothing had been heard of you for\nsome days, and Miss Tuppence was inclined to think you had got into\ndifficulties.\"\n\n\"I had, sir!\" Tommy grinned reminiscently. \"I was never in a tighter\nplace in my life.\"\n\nHelped out by questions from Sir James, he gave an abbreviated account\nof his adventures. The lawyer looked at him with renewed interest as he\nbrought the tale to a close.\n\n\"You got yourself out of a tight place very well,\" he said gravely. \"I\ncongratulate you. You displayed a great deal of ingenuity and carried\nyour part through well.\"\n\nTommy blushed, his face assuming a prawnlike hue at the praise.\n\n\"I couldn't have got away but for the girl, sir.\"\n\n\"No.\" Sir James smiled a little. \"It was lucky for you she happened\nto--er--take a fancy to you.\" Tommy appeared about to protest, but Sir\nJames went on. \"There's no doubt about her being one of the gang, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not, sir. I thought perhaps they were keeping her there by\nforce, but the way she acted didn't fit in with that. You see, she went\nback to them when she could have got away.\"\n\nSir James nodded thoughtfully.\n\n\"What did she say? Something about wanting to be taken to Marguerite?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I suppose she meant Mrs. Vandemeyer.\"\n\n\"She always signed herself Rita Vandemeyer. All her friends spoke of\nher as Rita. Still, I suppose the girl must have been in the habit of\ncalling her by her full name. And, at the moment she was crying out to\nher, Mrs. Vandemeyer was either dead or dying! Curious! There are one\nor two points that strike me as being obscure--their sudden change\nof attitude towards yourself, for instance. By the way, the house was\nraided, of course?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, but they'd all cleared out.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Sir James dryly.\n\n\"And not a clue left behind.\"\n\n\"I wonder----\" The lawyer tapped the table thoughtfully.\n\nSomething in his voice made Tommy look up. Would this man's eyes have\nseen something where theirs had been blind? He spoke impulsively:\n\n\"I wish you'd been there, sir, to go over the house!\"\n\n\"I wish I had,\" said Sir James quietly. He sat for a moment in silence.\nThen he looked up. \"And since then? What have you been doing?\"\n\nFor a moment, Tommy stared at him. Then it dawned on him that of course\nthe lawyer did not know.\n\n\"I forgot that you didn't know about Tuppence,\" he said slowly. The\nsickening anxiety, forgotten for a while in the excitement of knowing\nJane Finn was found at last, swept over him again.\n\nThe lawyer laid down his knife and fork sharply.\n\n\"Has anything happened to Miss Tuppence?\" His voice was keen-edged.\n\n\"She's disappeared,\" said Julius.\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"A week ago.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nSir James's questions fairly shot out. Between them Tommy and Julius\ngave the history of the last week and their futile search.\n\nSir James went at once to the root of the matter.\n\n\"A wire signed with your name? They knew enough of you both for that.\nThey weren't sure of how much you had learnt in that house. Their\nkidnapping of Miss Tuppence is the counter-move to your escape. If\nnecessary they could seal your lips with a threat of what might happen\nto her.\"\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n\"That's just what I thought, sir.\"\n\nSir James looked at him keenly. \"You had worked that out, had you? Not\nbad--not at all bad. The curious thing is that they certainly did not\nknow anything about you when they first held you prisoner. You are sure\nthat you did not in any way disclose your identity?\"\n\nTommy shook his head.\n\n\"That's so,\" said Julius with a nod. \"Therefore I reckon some one put\nthem wise--and not earlier than Sunday afternoon.\"\n\n\"Yes, but who?\"\n\n\"That almighty omniscient Mr. Brown, of course!\"\n\nThere was a faint note of derision in the American's voice which made\nSir James look up sharply.\n\n\"You don't believe in Mr. Brown, Mr. Hersheimmer?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I do not,\" returned the young American with emphasis. \"Not\nas such, that is to say. I reckon it out that he's a figurehead--just a\nbogy name to frighten the children with. The real head of this business\nis that Russian chap Kramenin. I guess he's quite capable of running\nrevolutions in three countries at once if he chose! The man Whittington\nis probably the head of the English branch.\"\n\n\"I disagree with you,\" said Sir James shortly. \"Mr. Brown exists.\" He\nturned to Tommy. \"Did you happen to notice where that wire was handed\nin?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I'm afraid I didn't.\"\n\n\"H'm. Got it with you?\"\n\n\"It's upstairs, sir, in my kit.\"\n\n\"I'd like to have a look at it sometime. No hurry. You've wasted a\nweek\"--Tommy hung his head--\"a day or so more is immaterial. We'll deal\nwith Miss Jane Finn first. Afterwards, we'll set to work to rescue Miss\nTuppence from bondage. I don't think she's in any immediate danger. That\nis, so long as they don't know that we've got Jane Finn, and that\nher memory has returned. We must keep that dark at all costs. You\nunderstand?\"\n\nThe other two assented, and, after making arrangements for meeting on\nthe morrow, the great lawyer took his leave.\n\nAt ten o'clock, the two young men were at the appointed spot. Sir\nJames had joined them on the doorstep. He alone appeared unexcited. He\nintroduced them to the doctor.\n\n\"Mr. Hersheimmer--Mr. Beresford--Dr. Roylance. How's the patient?\"\n\n\"Going on well. Evidently no idea of the flight of time. Asked this\nmorning how many had been saved from the Lusitania. Was it in the papers\nyet? That, of course, was only what was to be expected. She seems to\nhave something on her mind, though.\"\n\n\"I think we can relieve her anxiety. May we go up?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nTommy's heart beat sensibly faster as they followed the doctor upstairs.\nJane Finn at last! The long-sought, the mysterious, the elusive Jane\nFinn! How wildly improbable success had seemed! And here in this house,\nher memory almost miraculously restored, lay the girl who held the\nfuture of England in her hands. A half groan broke from Tommy's lips.\nIf only Tuppence could have been at his side to share in the triumphant\nconclusion of their joint venture! Then he put the thought of Tuppence\nresolutely aside. His confidence in Sir James was growing. There was\na man who would unerringly ferret out Tuppence's whereabouts. In the\nmeantime Jane Finn! And suddenly a dread clutched at his heart. It\nseemed too easy.... Suppose they should find her dead... stricken down\nby the hand of Mr. Brown?\n\nIn another minute he was laughing at these melodramatic fancies. The\ndoctor held open the door of a room and they passed in. On the white\nbed, bandages round her head, lay the girl. Somehow the whole scene\nseemed unreal. It was so exactly what one expected that it gave the\neffect of being beautifully staged.\n\nThe girl looked from one to the other of them with large wondering eyes.\nSir James spoke first.\n\n\"Miss Finn,\" he said, \"this is your cousin, Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer.\"\n\nA faint flush flitted over the girl's face, as Julius stepped forward\nand took her hand.\n\n\"How do, Cousin Jane?\" he said lightly.\n\nBut Tommy caught the tremor in his voice.\n\n\"Are you really Uncle Hiram's son?\" she asked wonderingly.\n\nHer voice, with the slight warmth of the Western accent, had an almost\nthrilling quality. It seemed vaguely familiar to Tommy, but he thrust\nthe impression aside as impossible.\n\n\"Sure thing.\"\n\n\"We used to read about Uncle Hiram in the papers,\" continued the girl,\nin her low soft tones. \"But I never thought I'd meet you one day. Mother\nfigured it out that Uncle Hiram would never get over being mad with\nher.\"\n\n\"The old man was like that,\" admitted Julius. \"But I guess the new\ngeneration's sort of different. Got no use for the family feud business.\nFirst thing I thought about, soon as the war was over, was to come along\nand hunt you up.\"\n\nA shadow passed over the girl's face.\n\n\"They've been telling me things--dreadful things--that my memory went,\nand that there are years I shall never know about--years lost out of my\nlife.\"\n\n\"You didn't realize that yourself?\"\n\nThe girl's eyes opened wide.\n\n\"Why, no. It seems to me as though it were no time since we were being\nhustled into those boats. I can see it all now.\" She closed her eyes\nwith a shudder.\n\nJulius looked across at Sir James, who nodded.\n\n\"Don't worry any. It isn't worth it. Now, see here, Jane, there's\nsomething we want to know about. There was a man aboard that boat with\nsome mighty important papers on him, and the big guns in this country\nhave got a notion that he passed on the goods to you. Is that so?\"\n\nThe girl hesitated, her glance shifting to the other two. Julius\nunderstood.\n\n\"Mr. Beresford is commissioned by the British Government to get those\npapers back. Sir James Peel Edgerton is an English Member of Parliament,\nand might be a big gun in the Cabinet if he liked. It's owing to him\nthat we've ferreted you out at last. So you can go right ahead and tell\nus the whole story. Did Danvers give you the papers?\"\n\n\"Yes. He said they'd have a better chance with me, because they would\nsave the women and children first.\"\n\n\"Just as we thought,\" said Sir James.\n\n\"He said they were very important--that they might make all the\ndifference to the Allies. But, if it's all so long ago, and the war's\nover, what does it matter now?\"\n\n\"I guess history repeats itself, Jane. First there was a great hue\nand cry over those papers, then it all died down, and now the whole\ncaboodle's started all over again--for rather different reasons. Then\nyou can hand them over to us right away?\"\n\n\"But I can't.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I haven't got them.\"\n\n\"You--haven't--got them?\" Julius punctuated the words with little\npauses.\n\n\"No--I hid them.\"\n\n\"You hid them?\"\n\n\"Yes. I got uneasy. People seemed to be watching me. It scared\nme--badly.\" She put her hand to her head. \"It's almost the last thing I\nremember before waking up in the hospital....\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Sir James, in his quiet penetrating tones. \"What do you\nremember?\"\n\nShe turned to him obediently.\n\n\"It was at Holyhead. I came that way--I don't remember why....\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter. Go on.\"\n\n\"In the confusion on the quay I slipped away. Nobody saw me. I took a\ncar. Told the man to drive me out of the town. I watched when we got on\nthe open road. No other car was following us. I saw a path at the side\nof the road. I told the man to wait.\"\n\nShe paused, then went on. \"The path led to the cliff, and down to the\nsea between big yellow gorse bushes--they were like golden flames. I\nlooked round. There wasn't a soul in sight. But just level with my head\nthere was a hole in the rock. It was quite small--I could only just get\nmy hand in, but it went a long way back. I took the oilskin packet from\nround my neck and shoved it right in as far as I could. Then I tore off\na bit of gorse--My! but it did prick--and plugged the hole with it so\nthat you'd never guess there was a crevice of any kind there. Then I\nmarked the place carefully in my own mind, so that I'd find it again.\nThere was a queer boulder in the path just there--for all the world\nlike a dog sitting up begging. Then I went back to the road. The car was\nwaiting, and I drove back. I just caught the train. I was a bit ashamed\nof myself for fancying things maybe, but, by and by, I saw the man\nopposite me wink at a woman who was sitting next to me, and I felt\nscared again, and was glad the papers were safe. I went out in the\ncorridor to get a little air. I thought I'd slip into another carriage.\nBut the woman called me back, said I'd dropped something, and when I\nstooped to look, something seemed to hit me--here.\" She placed her hand\nto the back of her head. \"I don't remember anything more until I woke up\nin the hospital.\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Finn.\" It was Sir James who spoke. \"I hope we have not\ntired you?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right. My head aches a little, but otherwise I feel\nfine.\"\n\nJulius stepped forward and took her hand again.\n\n\"So long, Cousin Jane. I'm going to get busy after those papers, but\nI'll be back in two shakes of a dog's tail, and I'll tote you up to\nLondon and give you the time of your young life before we go back to the\nStates! I mean it--so hurry up and get well.\"\n\n\n\n CHAPTER XX. TOO LATE\n\nIN the street they held an informal council of war. Sir James had drawn\na watch from his pocket. \"The boat train to Holyhead stops at Chester at\n12.14. If you start at once I think you can catch the connection.\"\n\nTommy looked up, puzzled.\n\n\"Is there any need to hurry, sir? To-day is only the 24th.\"\n\n\"I guess it's always well to get up early in the morning,\" said Julius,\nbefore the lawyer had time to reply. \"We'll make tracks for the depot\nright away.\"\n\nA little frown had settled on Sir James's brow.\n\n\"I wish I could come with you. I am due to speak at a meeting at two\no'clock. It is unfortunate.\"\n\nThe reluctance in his tone was very evident. It was clear, on the other\nhand, that Julius was easily disposed to put up with the loss of the\nother's company.\n\n\"I guess there's nothing complicated about this deal,\" he remarked.\n\"Just a game of hide-and-seek, that's all.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Sir James.\n\n\"Sure thing. What else could it be?\"\n\n\"You are still young, Mr. Hersheimmer. At my age you will probably have\nlearnt one lesson. 'Never underestimate your adversary.'\"\n\nThe gravity of his tone impressed Tommy, but had little effect upon\nJulius.\n\n\"You think Mr. Brown might come along and take a hand? If he does, I'm\nready for him.\" He slapped his pocket. \"I carry a gun. Little Willie\nhere travels round with me everywhere.\" He produced a murderous-looking\nautomatic, and tapped it affectionately before returning it to its\nhome. \"But he won't be needed this trip. There's nobody to put Mr. Brown\nwise.\"\n\nThe lawyer shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"There was nobody to put Mr. Brown wise to the fact that Mrs. Vandemeyer\nmeant to betray him. Nevertheless, MRS. VANDEMEYER DIED WITHOUT\nSPEAKING.\"\n\nJulius was silenced for once, and Sir James added on a lighter note:\n\n\"I only want to put you on your guard. Good-bye, and good luck. Take\nno unnecessary risks once the papers are in your hands. If there is any\nreason to believe that you have been shadowed, destroy them at once.\nGood luck to you. The game is in your hands now.\" He shook hands with\nthem both.\n\nTen minutes later the two young men were seated in a first-class\ncarriage en route for Chester.\n\nFor a long time neither of them spoke. When at length Julius broke the\nsilence, it was with a totally unexpected remark.\n\n\"Say,\" he observed thoughtfully, \"did you ever make a darned fool of\nyourself over a girl's face?\"\n\nTommy, after a moment's astonishment, searched his mind.\n\n\"Can't say I have,\" he replied at last. \"Not that I can recollect,\nanyhow. Why?\"\n\n\"Because for the last two months I've been making a sentimental idiot of\nmyself over Jane! First moment I clapped eyes on her photograph my heart\ndid all the usual stunts you read about in novels. I guess I'm ashamed\nto admit it, but I came over here determined to find her and fix it all\nup, and take her back as Mrs. Julius P. Hersheimmer!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tommy, amazed.\n\nJulius uncrossed his legs brusquely and continued:\n\n\"Just shows what an almighty fool a man can make of himself! One look at\nthe girl in the flesh, and I was cured!\"\n\nFeeling more tongue-tied than ever, Tommy ejaculated \"Oh!\" again.\n\n\"No disparagement to Jane, mind you,\" continued the other. \"She's a real\nnice girl, and some fellow will fall in love with her right away.\"\n\n\"I thought her a very good-looking girl,\" said Tommy, finding his\ntongue.\n\n\"Sure she is. But she's not like her photo one bit. At least I suppose\nshe is in a way--must be--because I recognized her right off. If I'd\nseen her in a crowd I'd have said 'There's a girl whose face I know'\nright away without any hesitation. But there was something about that\nphoto\"--Julius shook his head, and heaved a sigh--\"I guess romance is a\nmighty queer thing!\"\n\n\"It must be,\" said Tommy coldly, \"if you can come over here in love with\none girl, and propose to another within a fortnight.\"\n\nJulius had the grace to look discomposed.\n\n\"Well, you see, I'd got a sort of tired feeling that I'd never find\nJane--and that it was all plumb foolishness anyway. And then--oh, well,\nthe French, for instance, are much more sensible in the way they look at\nthings. They keep romance and marriage apart----\"\n\nTommy flushed.\n\n\"Well, I'm damned! If that's----\"\n\nJulius hastened to interrupt.\n\n\"Say now, don't be hasty. I don't mean what you mean. I take it\nAmericans have a higher opinion of morality than you have even. What I\nmeant was that the French set about marriage in a businesslike way--find\ntwo people who are suited to one another, look after the money affairs,\nand see the whole thing practically, and in a businesslike spirit.\"\n\n\"If you ask me,\" said Tommy, \"we're all too damned businesslike\nnowadays. We're always saying, 'Will it pay?' The men are bad enough,\nand the girls are worse!\"\n\n\"Cool down, son. Don't get so heated.\"\n\n\"I feel heated,\" said Tommy.\n\nJulius looked at him and judged it wise to say no more.\n\nHowever, Tommy had plenty of time to cool down before they reached\nHolyhead, and the cheerful grin had returned to his countenance as they\nalighted at their destination.\n\nAfter consultation, and with the aid of a road map, they were fairly\nwell agreed as to direction, so were able to hire a taxi without more\nado and drive out on the road leading to Treaddur Bay. They instructed\nthe man to go slowly, and watched narrowly so as not to miss the path.\nThey came to it not long after leaving the town, and Tommy stopped the\ncar promptly, asked in a casual tone whether the path led down to the\nsea, and hearing it did paid off the man in handsome style.\n\nA moment later the taxi was slowly chugging back to Holyhead. Tommy and\nJulius watched it out of sight, and then turned to the narrow path.\n\n\"It's the right one, I suppose?\" asked Tommy doubtfully. \"There must be\nsimply heaps along here.\"\n\n\"Sure it is. Look at the gorse. Remember what Jane said?\"\n\nTommy looked at the swelling hedges of golden blossom which bordered the\npath on either side, and was convinced.\n\nThey went down in single file, Julius leading. Twice Tommy turned his\nhead uneasily. Julius looked back.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I've got the wind up somehow. Keep fancying there's some\none following us.\"\n\n\"Can't be,\" said Julius positively. \"We'd see him.\"\n\nTommy had to admit that this was true. Nevertheless, his sense of\nuneasiness deepened. In spite of himself he believed in the omniscience\nof the enemy.\n\n\"I rather wish that fellow would come along,\" said Julius. He patted his\npocket. \"Little William here is just aching for exercise!\"\n\n\"Do you always carry it--him--with you?\" inquired Tommy with burning\ncuriosity.\n\n\"Most always. I guess you never know what might turn up.\"\n\nTommy kept a respectful silence. He was impressed by little William. It\nseemed to remove the menace of Mr. Brown farther away.\n\nThe path was now running along the side of the cliff, parallel to the\nsea. Suddenly Julius came to such an abrupt halt that Tommy cannoned\ninto him.\n\n\"What's up?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Look there. If that doesn't beat the band!\"\n\nTommy looked. Standing out half obstructing the path was a huge boulder\nwhich certainly bore a fanciful resemblance to a \"begging\" terrier.\n\n\"Well,\" said Tommy, refusing to share Julius's emotion, \"it's what we\nexpected to see, isn't it?\"\n\nJulius looked at him sadly and shook his head.\n\n\"British phlegm! Sure we expected it--but it kind of rattles me, all the\nsame, to see it sitting there just where we expected to find it!\"\n\nTommy, whose calm was, perhaps, more assumed than natural, moved his\nfeet impatiently.\n\n\"Push on. What about the hole?\"\n\nThey scanned the cliff-side narrowly. Tommy heard himself saying\nidiotically:\n\n\"The gorse won't be there after all these years.\"\n\nAnd Julius replied solemnly:\n\n\"I guess you're right.\"\n\nTommy suddenly pointed with a shaking hand.\n\n\"What about that crevice there?\"\n\nJulius replied in an awestricken voice:\n\n\"That's it--for sure.\"\n\nThey looked at each other.\n\n\"When I was in France,\" said Tommy reminiscently, \"whenever my batman\nfailed to call me, he always said that he had come over queer. I never\nbelieved it. But whether he felt it or not, there IS such a sensation.\nI've got it now! Badly!\"\n\nHe looked at the rock with a kind of agonized passion.\n\n\"Damn it!\" he cried. \"It's impossible! Five years! Think of it!\nBird's-nesting boys, picnic parties, thousands of people passing! It\ncan't be there! It's a hundred to one against its being there! It's\nagainst all reason!\"\n\nIndeed, he felt it to be impossible--more, perhaps, because he could not\nbelieve in his own success where so many others had failed. The thing\nwas too easy, therefore it could not be. The hole would be empty.\n\nJulius looked at him with a widening smile.\n\n\"I guess you're rattled now all right,\" he drawled with some enjoyment.\n\"Well, here goes!\" He thrust his hand into the crevice, and made a\nslight grimace. \"It's a tight fit. Jane's hand must be a few sizes\nsmaller than mine. I don't feel anything--no--say, what's this? Gee\nwhiz!\" And with a flourish he waved aloft a small discoloured packet.\n\"It's the goods all right. Sewn up in oilskin. Hold it while I get my\npenknife.\"\n\nThe unbelievable had happened. Tommy held the precious packet tenderly\nbetween his hands. They had succeeded!\n\n\"It's queer,\" he murmured idly, \"you'd think the stitches would have\nrotted. They look just as good as new.\"\n\nThey cut them carefully and ripped away the oilskin. Inside was a small\nfolded sheet of paper. With trembling fingers they unfolded it. The\nsheet was blank! They stared at each other, puzzled.\n\n\"A dummy?\" hazarded Julius. \"Was Danvers just a decoy?\"\n\nTommy shook his head. That solution did not satisfy him. Suddenly his\nface cleared.\n\n\"I've got it! SYMPATHETIC INK!\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"Worth trying anyhow. Heat usually does the trick. Get some sticks.\nWe'll make a fire.\"\n\nIn a few minutes the little fire of twigs and leaves was blazing\nmerrily. Tommy held the sheet of paper near the glow. The paper curled a\nlittle with the heat. Nothing more.\n\nSuddenly Julius grasped his arm, and pointed to where characters were\nappearing in a faint brown colour.\n\n\"Gee whiz! You've got it! Say, that idea of yours was great. It never\noccurred to me.\"\n\nTommy held the paper in position some minutes longer until he judged the\nheat had done its work. Then he withdrew it. A moment later he uttered a\ncry.\n\nAcross the sheet in neat brown printing ran the words: WITH THE\nCOMPLIMENTS OF MR. BROWN.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. TOMMY MAKES A DISCOVERY\n\nFOR a moment or two they stood staring at each other stupidly, dazed\nwith the shock. Somehow, inexplicably, Mr. Brown had forestalled them.\nTommy accepted defeat quietly. Not so Julius.\n\n\"How in tarnation did he get ahead of us? That's what beats me!\" he\nended up.\n\nTommy shook his head, and said dully:\n\n\"It accounts for the stitches being new. We might have guessed....\"\n\n\"Never mind the darned stitches. How did he get ahead of us? We hustled\nall we knew. It's downright impossible for anyone to get here quicker\nthan we did. And, anyway, how did he know? Do you reckon there was a\ndictaphone in Jane's room? I guess there must have been.\"\n\nBut Tommy's common sense pointed out objections.\n\n\"No one could have known beforehand that she was going to be in that\nhouse--much less that particular room.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" admitted Julius. \"Then one of the nurses was a crook and\nlistened at the door. How's that?\"\n\n\"I don't see that it matters anyway,\" said Tommy wearily. \"He may have\nfound out some months ago, and removed the papers, then----No, by Jove,\nthat won't wash! They'd have been published at once.\"\n\n\"Sure thing they would! No, some one's got ahead of us to-day by an hour\nor so. But how they did it gets my goat.\"\n\n\"I wish that chap Peel Edgerton had been with us,\" said Tommy\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"Why?\" Julius stared. \"The mischief was done when we came.\"\n\n\"Yes----\" Tommy hesitated. He could not explain his own feeling--the\nillogical idea that the K.C.'s presence would somehow have averted the\ncatastrophe. He reverted to his former point of view. \"It's no good\narguing about how it was done. The game's up. We've failed. There's only\none thing for me to do.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Get back to London as soon as possible. Mr. Carter must be warned. It's\nonly a matter of hours now before the blow falls. But, at any rate, he\nought to know the worst.\"\n\nThe duty was an unpleasant one, but Tommy had no intention of shirking\nit. He must report his failure to Mr. Carter. After that his work was\ndone. He took the midnight mail to London. Julius elected to stay the\nnight at Holyhead.\n\nHalf an hour after arrival, haggard and pale, Tommy stood before his\nchief.\n\n\"I've come to report, sir. I've failed--failed badly.\"\n\nMr. Carter eyed him sharply.\n\n\"You mean that the treaty----\"\n\n\"Is in the hands of Mr. Brown, sir.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Carter quietly. The expression on his face did not\nchange, but Tommy caught the flicker of despair in his eyes. It\nconvinced him as nothing else had done that the outlook was hopeless.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Carter after a minute or two, \"we mustn't sag at the\nknees, I suppose. I'm glad to know definitely. We must do what we can.\"\n\nThrough Tommy's mind flashed the assurance: \"It's hopeless, and he knows\nit's hopeless!\"\n\nThe other looked up at him.\n\n\"Don't take it to heart, lad,\" he said kindly. \"You did your best. You\nwere up against one of the biggest brains of the century. And you came\nvery near success. Remember that.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir. It's awfully decent of you.\"\n\n\"I blame myself. I have been blaming myself ever since I heard this\nother news.\"\n\nSomething in his tone attracted Tommy's attention. A new fear gripped at\nhis heart.\n\n\"Is there--something more, sir?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so,\" said Mr. Carter gravely. He stretched out his hand to a\nsheet on the table.\n\n\"Tuppence----?\" faltered Tommy.\n\n\"Read for yourself.\"\n\nThe typewritten words danced before his eyes. The description of a green\ntoque, a coat with a handkerchief in the pocket marked P.L.C. He looked\nan agonized question at Mr. Carter. The latter replied to it:\n\n\"Washed up on the Yorkshire coast--near Ebury. I'm afraid--it looks very\nmuch like foul play.\"\n\n\"My God!\" gasped Tommy. \"TUPPENCE! Those devils--I'll never rest till\nI've got even with them! I'll hunt them down! I'll----\"\n\nThe pity on Mr. Carter's face stopped him.\n\n\"I know what you feel like, my poor boy. But it's no good. You'll waste\nyour strength uselessly. It may sound harsh, but my advice to you is:\nCut your losses. Time's merciful. You'll forget.\"\n\n\"Forget Tuppence? Never!\"\n\nMr. Carter shook his head.\n\n\"So you think now. Well, it won't bear thinking of--that brave little\ngirl! I'm sorry about the whole business--confoundedly sorry.\"\n\nTommy came to himself with a start.\n\n\"I'm taking up your time, sir,\" he said with an effort. \"There's no need\nfor you to blame yourself. I dare say we were a couple of young fools to\ntake on such a job. You warned us all right. But I wish to God I'd been\nthe one to get it in the neck. Good-bye, sir.\"\n\nBack at the Ritz, Tommy packed up his few belongings mechanically,\nhis thoughts far away. He was still bewildered by the introduction of\ntragedy into his cheerful commonplace existence. What fun they had\nhad together, he and Tuppence! And now--oh, he couldn't believe it--it\ncouldn't be true! TUPPENCE--DEAD! Little Tuppence, brimming over with\nlife! It was a dream, a horrible dream. Nothing more.\n\nThey brought him a note, a few kind words of sympathy from Peel\nEdgerton, who had read the news in the paper. (There had been a large\nheadline: EX-V.A.D. FEARED DROWNED.) The letter ended with the offer\nof a post on a ranch in the Argentine, where Sir James had considerable\ninterests.\n\n\"Kind old beggar,\" muttered Tommy, as he flung it aside.\n\nThe door opened, and Julius burst in with his usual violence. He held an\nopen newspaper in his hand.\n\n\"Say, what's all this? They seem to have got some fool idea about\nTuppence.\"\n\n\"It's true,\" said Tommy quietly.\n\n\"You mean they've done her in?\"\n\nTommy nodded.\n\n\"I suppose when they got the treaty she--wasn't any good to them any\nlonger, and they were afraid to let her go.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm darned!\" said Julius. \"Little Tuppence. She sure was the\npluckiest little girl----\"\n\nBut suddenly something seemed to crack in Tommy's brain. He rose to his\nfeet.\n\n\"Oh, get out! You don't really care, damn you! You asked her to marry\nyou in your rotten cold-blooded way, but I LOVED her. I'd have given the\nsoul out of my body to save her from harm. I'd have stood by without a\nword and let her marry you, because you could have given her the sort of\ntime she ought to have had, and I was only a poor devil without a penny\nto bless himself with. But it wouldn't have been because I didn't care!\"\n\n\"See here,\" began Julius temperately.\n\n\"Oh, go to the devil! I can't stand your coming here and talking about\n'little Tuppence.' Go and look after your cousin. Tuppence is my girl!\nI've always loved her, from the time we played together as kids. We\ngrew up and it was just the same. I shall never forget when I was in\nhospital, and she came in in that ridiculous cap and apron! It was like\na miracle to see the girl I loved turn up in a nurse's kit----\"\n\nBut Julius interrupted him.\n\n\"A nurse's kit! Gee whiz! I must be going to Colney Hatch! I could swear\nI've seen Jane in a nurse's cap too. And that's plumb impossible! No,\nby gum, I've got it! It was her I saw talking to Whittington at that\nnursing home in Bournemouth. She wasn't a patient there! She was a\nnurse!\"\n\n\"I dare say,\" said Tommy angrily, \"she's probably been in with them from\nthe start. I shouldn't wonder if she stole those papers from Danvers to\nbegin with.\"\n\n\"I'm darned if she did!\" shouted Julius. \"She's my cousin, and as\npatriotic a girl as ever stepped.\"\n\n\"I don't care a damn what she is, but get out of here!\" retorted Tommy\nalso at the top of his voice.\n\nThe young men were on the point of coming to blows. But suddenly, with\nan almost magical abruptness, Julius's anger abated.\n\n\"All right, son,\" he said quietly, \"I'm going. I don't blame you any for\nwhat you've been saying. It's mighty lucky you did say it. I've been\nthe most almighty blithering darned idiot that it's possible to imagine.\nCalm down\"--Tommy had made an impatient gesture--\"I'm going right away\nnow--going to the London and North Western Railway depot, if you want to\nknow.\"\n\n\"I don't care a damn where you're going,\" growled Tommy.\n\nAs the door closed behind Julius, he returned to his suit-case.\n\n\"That's the lot,\" he murmured, and rang the bell.\n\n\"Take my luggage down.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Going away, sir?\"\n\n\"I'm going to the devil,\" said Tommy, regardless of the menial's\nfeelings.\n\nThat functionary, however, merely replied respectfully:\n\n\"Yes, sir. Shall I call a taxi?\"\n\nTommy nodded.\n\nWhere was he going? He hadn't the faintest idea. Beyond a fixed\ndetermination to get even with Mr. Brown he had no plans. He re-read Sir\nJames's letter, and shook his head. Tuppence must be avenged. Still, it\nwas kind of the old fellow.\n\n\"Better answer it, I suppose.\" He went across to the writing-table.\nWith the usual perversity of bedroom stationery, there were innumerable\nenvelopes and no paper. He rang. No one came. Tommy fumed at the\ndelay. Then he remembered that there was a good supply in Julius's\nsitting-room. The American had announced his immediate departure, there\nwould be no fear of running up against him. Besides, he wouldn't mind if\nhe did. He was beginning to be rather ashamed of the things he had said.\nOld Julius had taken them jolly well. He'd apologize if he found him\nthere.\n\nBut the room was deserted. Tommy walked across to the writing-table,\nand opened the middle drawer. A photograph, carelessly thrust in face\nupwards, caught his eye. For a moment he stood rooted to the ground.\nThen he took it out, shut the drawer, walked slowly over to an\narm-chair, and sat down still staring at the photograph in his hand.\n\nWhat on earth was a photograph of the French girl Annette doing in\nJulius Hersheimmer's writing-table?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. IN DOWNING STREET\n\nTHE Prime Minister tapped the desk in front of him with nervous fingers.\nHis face was worn and harassed. He took up his conversation with Mr.\nCarter at the point it had broken off. \"I don't understand,\" he said.\n\"Do you really mean that things are not so desperate after all?\"\n\n\"So this lad seems to think.\"\n\n\"Let's have a look at his letter again.\"\n\nMr. Carter handed it over. It was written in a sprawling boyish hand.\n\n\"DEAR MR. CARTER,\n\n\"Something's turned up that has given me a jar. Of course I may be\nsimply making an awful ass of myself, but I don't think so. If my\nconclusions are right, that girl at Manchester was just a plant. The\nwhole thing was prearranged, sham packet and all, with the object of\nmaking us think the game was up--therefore I fancy that we must have\nbeen pretty hot on the scent.\n\n\"I think I know who the real Jane Finn is, and I've even got an idea\nwhere the papers are. That last's only a guess, of course, but I've a\nsort of feeling it'll turn out right. Anyhow, I enclose it in a sealed\nenvelope for what it's worth. I'm going to ask you not to open it until\nthe very last moment, midnight on the 28th, in fact. You'll understand\nwhy in a minute. You see, I've figured it out that those things of\nTuppence's are a plant too, and she's no more drowned than I am. The way\nI reason is this: as a last chance they'll let Jane Finn escape in\nthe hope that she's been shamming this memory stunt, and that once she\nthinks she's free she'll go right away to the cache. Of course it's\nan awful risk for them to take, because she knows all about them--but\nthey're pretty desperate to get hold of that treaty. BUT IF THEY KNOW\nTHAT THE PAPERS HAVE BEEN RECOVERED BY US, neither of those two girls'\nlives will be worth an hour's purchase. I must try and get hold of\nTuppence before Jane escapes.\n\n\"I want a repeat of that telegram that was sent to Tuppence at the Ritz.\nSir James Peel Edgerton said you would be able to manage that for me.\nHe's frightfully clever.\n\n\"One last thing--please have that house in Soho watched day and night.\n\n\"Yours, etc.,\n\n\"THOMAS BERESFORD.\"\n\n\nThe Prime Minister looked up.\n\n\"The enclosure?\"\n\nMr. Carter smiled dryly.\n\n\"In the vaults of the Bank. I am taking no chances.\"\n\n\"You don't think\"--the Prime Minister hesitated a minute--\"that it would\nbe better to open it now? Surely we ought to secure the document, that\nis, provided the young man's guess turns out to be correct, at once. We\ncan keep the fact of having done so quite secret.\"\n\n\"Can we? I'm not so sure. There are spies all round us. Once it's known\nI wouldn't give that\"--he snapped his fingers--\"for the life of those\ntwo girls. No, the boy trusted me, and I shan't let him down.\"\n\n\"Well, well, we must leave it at that, then. What's he like, this lad?\"\n\n\"Outwardly, he's an ordinary clean-limbed, rather block-headed young\nEnglishman. Slow in his mental processes. On the other hand, it's quite\nimpossible to lead him astray through his imagination. He hasn't got\nany--so he's difficult to deceive. He worries things out slowly, and\nonce he's got hold of anything he doesn't let go. The little lady's\nquite different. More intuition and less common sense. They make a\npretty pair working together. Pace and stamina.\"\n\n\"He seems confident,\" mused the Prime Minister.\n\n\"Yes, and that's what gives me hope. He's the kind of diffident youth\nwho would have to be VERY sure before he ventured an opinion at all.\"\n\nA half smile came to the other's lips.\n\n\"And it is this--boy who will defeat the master criminal of our time?\"\n\n\"This--boy, as you say! But I sometimes fancy I see a shadow behind.\"\n\n\"You mean?\"\n\n\"Peel Edgerton.\"\n\n\"Peel Edgerton?\" said the Prime Minister in astonishment.\n\n\"Yes. I see his hand in THIS.\" He struck the open letter. \"He's\nthere--working in the dark, silently, unobtrusively. I've always felt\nthat if anyone was to run Mr. Brown to earth, Peel Edgerton would be the\nman. I tell you he's on the case now, but doesn't want it known. By the\nway, I got rather an odd request from him the other day.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"He sent me a cutting from some American paper. It referred to a man's\nbody found near the docks in New York about three weeks ago. He asked me\nto collect any information on the subject I could.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nCarter shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I couldn't get much. Young fellow about thirty-five--poorly\ndressed--face very badly disfigured. He was never identified.\"\n\n\"And you fancy that the two matters are connected in some way?\"\n\n\"Somehow I do. I may be wrong, of course.\"\n\nThere was a pause, then Mr. Carter continued:\n\n\"I asked him to come round here. Not that we'll get anything out of him\nhe doesn't want to tell. His legal instincts are too strong. But there's\nno doubt he can throw light on one or two obscure points in young\nBeresford's letter. Ah, here he is!\"\n\nThe two men rose to greet the new-comer. A half whimsical thought\nflashed across the Premier's mind. \"My successor, perhaps!\"\n\n\"We've had a letter from young Beresford,\" said Mr. Carter, coming to\nthe point at once. \"You've seen him, I suppose?\"\n\n\"You suppose wrong,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"Oh!\" Mr. Carter was a little nonplussed.\n\nSir James smiled, and stroked his chin.\n\n\"He rang me up,\" he volunteered.\n\n\"Would you have any objection to telling us exactly what passed between\nyou?\"\n\n\"Not at all. He thanked me for a certain letter which I had written to\nhim--as a matter of fact, I had offered him a job. Then he reminded\nme of something I had said to him at Manchester respecting that bogus\ntelegram which lured Miss Cowley away. I asked him if anything untoward\nhad occurred. He said it had--that in a drawer in Mr. Hersheimmer's room\nhe had discovered a photograph.\" The lawyer paused, then continued:\n\"I asked him if the photograph bore the name and address of a\nCalifornian photographer. He replied: 'You're on to it, sir. It had.'\nThen he went on to tell me something I DIDN'T know. The original of that\nphotograph was the French girl, Annette, who saved his life.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Exactly. I asked the young man with some curiosity what he had done\nwith the photograph. He replied that he had put it back where he found\nit.\" The lawyer paused again. \"That was good, you know--distinctly\ngood. He can use his brains, that young fellow. I congratulated him. The\ndiscovery was a providential one. Of course, from the moment that the\ngirl in Manchester was proved to be a plant everything was altered.\nYoung Beresford saw that for himself without my having to tell it\nhim. But he felt he couldn't trust his judgment on the subject of\nMiss Cowley. Did I think she was alive? I told him, duly weighing the\nevidence, that there was a very decided chance in favour of it. That\nbrought us back to the telegram.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I advised him to apply to you for a copy of the original wire. It\nhad occurred to me as probable that, after Miss Cowley flung it on the\nfloor, certain words might have been erased and altered with the express\nintention of setting searchers on a false trail.\"\n\nCarter nodded. He took a sheet from his pocket, and read aloud:\n\n\n\"Come at once, Astley Priors, Gatehouse, Kent. Great\ndevelopments--TOMMY.\"\n\n\n\"Very simple,\" said Sir James, \"and very ingenious. Just a few words\nto alter, and the thing was done. And the one important clue they\noverlooked.\"\n\n\"What was that?\"\n\n\"The page-boy's statement that Miss Cowley drove to Charing Cross. They\nwere so sure of themselves that they took it for granted he had made a\nmistake.\"\n\n\"Then young Beresford is now?\"\n\n\"At Gatehouse, Kent, unless I am much mistaken.\"\n\nMr. Carter looked at him curiously.\n\n\"I rather wonder you're not there too, Peel Edgerton?\"\n\n\"Ah, I'm busy on a case.\"\n\n\"I thought you were on your holiday?\"\n\n\"Oh, I've not been briefed. Perhaps it would be more correct to say I'm\npreparing a case. Any more facts about that American chap for me?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not. Is it important to find out who he was?\"\n\n\"Oh, I know who he was,\" said Sir James easily. \"I can't prove it\nyet--but I know.\"\n\nThe other two asked no questions. They had an instinct that it would be\nmere waste of breath.\n\n\"But what I don't understand,\" said the Prime-Minister suddenly, \"is how\nthat photograph came to be in Mr. Hersheimmer's drawer?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it never left it,\" suggested the lawyer gently.\n\n\"But the bogus inspector? Inspector Brown?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Sir James thoughtfully. He rose to his feet. \"I mustn't keep\nyou. Go on with the affairs of the nation. I must get back to--my case.\"\n\nTwo days later Julius Hersheimmer returned from Manchester. A note from\nTommy lay on his table:\n\n\n\"DEAR HERSHEIMMER,\n\n\"Sorry I lost my temper. In case I don't see you again, good-bye. I've\nbeen offered a job in the Argentine, and might as well take it.\n\n\"Yours,\n\n\"TOMMY BERESFORD.\"\n\n\nA peculiar smile lingered for a moment on Julius's face. He threw the\nletter into the waste-paper basket.\n\n\"The darned fool!\" he murmured.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. A RACE AGAINST TIME\n\nAFTER ringing up Sir James, Tommy's next procedure was to make a call\nat South Audley Mansions. He found Albert discharging his professional\nduties, and introduced himself without more ado as a friend of\nTuppence's. Albert unbent immediately.\n\n\"Things has been very quiet here lately,\" he said wistfully. \"Hope the\nyoung lady's keeping well, sir?\"\n\n\"That's just the point, Albert. She's disappeared.\"\n\n\"You don't mean as the crooks have got her?\"\n\n\"They have.\"\n\n\"In the Underworld?\"\n\n\"No, dash it all, in this world!\"\n\n\"It's a h'expression, sir,\" explained Albert. \"At the pictures the\ncrooks always have a restoorant in the Underworld. But do you think as\nthey've done her in, sir?\"\n\n\"I hope not. By the way, have you by any chance an aunt, a cousin,\na grandmother, or any other suitable female relation who might be\nrepresented as being likely to kick the bucket?\"\n\nA delighted grin spread slowly over Albert's countenance.\n\n\"I'm on, sir. My poor aunt what lives in the country has been mortal bad\nfor a long time, and she's asking for me with her dying breath.\"\n\nTommy nodded approval.\n\n\"Can you report this in the proper quarter and meet me at Charing Cross\nin an hour's time?\"\n\n\"I'll be there, sir. You can count on me.\"\n\nAs Tommy had judged, the faithful Albert proved an invaluable ally. The\ntwo took up their quarters at the inn in Gatehouse. To Albert fell the\ntask of collecting information. There was no difficulty about it.\n\nAstley Priors was the property of a Dr. Adams. The doctor no longer\npracticed, had retired, the landlord believed, but he took a few private\npatients--here the good fellow tapped his forehead knowingly--\"balmy\nones! You understand!\" The doctor was a popular figure in the village,\nsubscribed freely to all the local sports--\"a very pleasant, affable\ngentleman.\" Been there long? Oh, a matter of ten years or so--might be\nlonger. Scientific gentleman, he was. Professors and people often came\ndown from town to see him. Anyway, it was a gay house, always visitors.\n\nIn the face of all this volubility, Tommy felt doubts. Was it possible\nthat this genial, well-known figure could be in reality a dangerous\ncriminal? His life seemed so open and aboveboard. No hint of sinister\ndoings. Suppose it was all a gigantic mistake? Tommy felt a cold chill\nat the thought.\n\nThen he remembered the private patients--\"balmy ones.\" He inquired\ncarefully if there was a young lady amongst them, describing Tuppence.\nBut nothing much seemed to be known about the patients--they were seldom\nseen outside the grounds. A guarded description of Annette also failed\nto provoke recognition.\n\nAstley Priors was a pleasant red-brick edifice, surrounded by\nwell-wooded grounds which effectually shielded the house from\nobservation from the road.\n\nOn the first evening Tommy, accompanied by Albert, explored the grounds.\nOwing to Albert's insistence they dragged themselves along painfully on\ntheir stomachs, thereby producing a great deal more noise than if\nthey had stood upright. In any case, these precautions were totally\nunnecessary. The grounds, like those of any other private house after\nnightfall, seemed untenanted. Tommy had imagined a possible fierce\nwatchdog. Albert's fancy ran to a puma, or a tame cobra. But they\nreached a shrubbery near the house quite unmolested.\n\nThe blinds of the dining-room window were up. There was a large company\nassembled round the table. The port was passing from hand to hand. It\nseemed a normal, pleasant company. Through the open window scraps of\nconversation floated out disjointedly on the night air. It was a heated\ndiscussion on county cricket!\n\nAgain Tommy felt that cold chill of uncertainty. It seemed impossible\nto believe that these people were other than they seemed. Had he been\nfooled once more? The fair-bearded, spectacled gentleman who sat at the\nhead of the table looked singularly honest and normal.\n\nTommy slept badly that night. The following morning the indefatigable\nAlbert, having cemented an alliance with the greengrocer's boy, took the\nlatter's place and ingratiated himself with the cook at Malthouse.\nHe returned with the information that she was undoubtedly \"one of\nthe crooks,\" but Tommy mistrusted the vividness of his imagination.\nQuestioned, he could adduce nothing in support of his statement except\nhis own opinion that she wasn't the usual kind. You could see that at a\nglance.\n\nThe substitution being repeated (much to the pecuniary advantage of the\nreal greengrocer's boy) on the following day, Albert brought back the\nfirst piece of hopeful news. There WAS a French young lady staying in\nthe house. Tommy put his doubts aside. Here was confirmation of\nhis theory. But time pressed. To-day was the 27th. The 29th was the\nmuch-talked-of \"Labour Day,\" about which all sorts of rumours were\nrunning riot. Newspapers were getting agitated. Sensational hints of a\nLabour coup d'etat were freely reported. The Government said nothing. It\nknew and was prepared. There were rumours of dissension among the Labour\nleaders. They were not of one mind. The more far-seeing among them\nrealized that what they proposed might well be a death-blow to the\nEngland that at heart they loved. They shrank from the starvation and\nmisery a general strike would entail, and were willing to meet the\nGovernment half-way. But behind them were subtle, insistent forces at\nwork, urging the memories of old wrongs, deprecating the weakness of\nhalf-and-half measures, fomenting misunderstandings.\n\nTommy felt that, thanks to Mr. Carter, he understood the position fairly\naccurately. With the fatal document in the hands of Mr. Brown,\npublic opinion would swing to the side of the Labour extremists and\nrevolutionists. Failing that, the battle was an even chance. The\nGovernment with a loyal army and police force behind them might\nwin--but at a cost of great suffering. But Tommy nourished another and\na preposterous dream. With Mr. Brown unmasked and captured he\nbelieved, rightly or wrongly, that the whole organization would crumble\nignominiously and instantaneously. The strange permeating influence\nof the unseen chief held it together. Without him, Tommy believed an\ninstant panic would set in; and, the honest men left to themselves, an\neleventh-hour reconciliation would be possible.\n\n\"This is a one-man show,\" said Tommy to himself. \"The thing to do is to\nget hold of the man.\"\n\nIt was partly in furtherance of this ambitious design that he had\nrequested Mr. Carter not to open the sealed envelope. The draft\ntreaty was Tommy's bait. Every now and then he was aghast at his own\npresumption. How dared he think that he had discovered what so many\nwiser and clever men had overlooked? Nevertheless, he stuck tenaciously\nto his idea.\n\nThat evening he and Albert once more penetrated the grounds of Astley\nPriors. Tommy's ambition was somehow or other to gain admission to the\nhouse itself. As they approached cautiously, Tommy gave a sudden gasp.\n\nOn the second floor window some one standing between the window and\nthe light in the room threw a silhouette on the blind. It was one Tommy\nwould have recognized anywhere! Tuppence was in that house!\n\nHe clutched Albert by the shoulder.\n\n\"Stay here! When I begin to sing, watch that window.\"\n\nHe retreated hastily to a position on the main drive, and began in a\ndeep roar, coupled with an unsteady gait, the following ditty:\n\n          I am a Soldier           A jolly British Soldier;\n   You can see that I'm a Soldier by my feet...\n\n\nIt had been a favourite on the gramophone in Tuppence's hospital days.\nHe did not doubt but that she would recognize it and draw her own\nconclusions. Tommy had not a note of music in his voice, but his lungs\nwere excellent. The noise he produced was terrific.\n\nPresently an unimpeachable butler, accompanied by an equally\nunimpeachable footman, issued from the front door. The butler\nremonstrated with him. Tommy continued to sing, addressing the butler\naffectionately as \"dear old whiskers.\" The footman took him by one arm,\nthe butler by the other. They ran him down the drive, and neatly out\nof the gate. The butler threatened him with the police if he intruded\nagain. It was beautifully done--soberly and with perfect decorum. Anyone\nwould have sworn that the butler was a real butler, the footman a real\nfootman--only, as it happened, the butler was Whittington!\n\nTommy retired to the inn and waited for Albert's return. At last that\nworthy made his appearance.\n\n\"Well?\" cried Tommy eagerly.\n\n\"It's all right. While they was a-running of you out the window opened,\nand something was chucked out.\" He handed a scrap of paper to Tommy. \"It\nwas wrapped round a letterweight.\"\n\nOn the paper were scrawled three words: \"To-morrow--same time.\"\n\n\"Good egg!\" cried Tommy. \"We're getting going.\"\n\n\"I wrote a message on a piece of paper, wrapped it round a stone, and\nchucked it through the window,\" continued Albert breathlessly.\n\nTommy groaned.\n\n\"Your zeal will be the undoing of us, Albert. What did you say?\"\n\n\"Said we was a-staying at the inn. If she could get away, to come there\nand croak like a frog.\"\n\n\"She'll know that's you,\" said Tommy with a sigh of relief. \"Your\nimagination runs away with you, you know, Albert. Why, you wouldn't\nrecognize a frog croaking if you heard it.\"\n\nAlbert looked rather crest-fallen.\n\n\"Cheer up,\" said Tommy. \"No harm done. That butler's an old friend of\nmine--I bet he knew who I was, though he didn't let on. It's not their\ngame to show suspicion. That's why we've found it fairly plain sailing.\nThey don't want to discourage me altogether. On the other hand, they\ndon't want to make it too easy. I'm a pawn in their game, Albert, that's\nwhat I am. You see, if the spider lets the fly walk out too easily,\nthe fly might suspect it was a put-up job. Hence the usefulness of that\npromising youth, Mr. T. Beresford, who's blundered in just at the right\nmoment for them. But later, Mr. T. Beresford had better look out!\"\n\nTommy retired for the night in a state of some elation. He had\nelaborated a careful plan for the following evening. He felt sure that\nthe inhabitants of Astley Priors would not interfere with him up to\na certain point. It was after that that Tommy proposed to give them a\nsurprise.\n\nAbout twelve o'clock, however, his calm was rudely shaken. He was told\nthat some one was demanding him in the bar. The applicant proved to be a\nrude-looking carter well coated with mud.\n\n\"Well, my good fellow, what is it?\" asked Tommy.\n\n\"Might this be for you, sir?\" The carter held out a very dirty folded\nnote, on the outside of which was written: \"Take this to the gentleman\nat the inn near Astley Priors. He will give you ten shillings.\"\n\nThe handwriting was Tuppence's. Tommy appreciated her quick-wittedness\nin realizing that he might be staying at the inn under an assumed name.\nHe snatched at it.\n\n\"That's all right.\"\n\nThe man withheld it.\n\n\"What about my ten shillings?\"\n\nTommy hastily produced a ten-shilling note, and the man relinquished his\nfind. Tommy unfastened it.\n\n\"DEAR TOMMY,\n\n\"I knew it was you last night. Don't go this evening. They'll be lying\nin wait for you. They're taking us away this morning. I heard something\nabout Wales--Holyhead, I think. I'll drop this on the road if I get a\nchance. Annette told me how you'd escaped. Buck up.\n\n\"Yours,\n\n\"TWOPENCE.\"\n\n\nTommy raised a shout for Albert before he had even finished perusing\nthis characteristic epistle.\n\n\"Pack my bag! We're off!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" The boots of Albert could be heard racing upstairs.\nHolyhead? Did that mean that, after all----Tommy was puzzled. He read on\nslowly.\n\nThe boots of Albert continued to be active on the floor above.\n\nSuddenly a second shout came from below.\n\n\"Albert! I'm a damned fool! Unpack that bag!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nTommy smoothed out the note thoughtfully.\n\n\"Yes, a damned fool,\" he said softly. \"But so's some one else! And at\nlast I know who it is!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. JULIUS TAKES A HAND\n\nIN his suite at Claridge's, Kramenin reclined on a couch and dictated to\nhis secretary in sibilant Russian.\n\nPresently the telephone at the secretary's elbow purred, and he took up\nthe receiver, spoke for a minute or two, then turned to his employer.\n\n\"Some one below is asking for you.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\n\"He gives the name of Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer.\"\n\n\"Hersheimmer,\" repeated Kramenin thoughtfully. \"I have heard that name\nbefore.\"\n\n\"His father was one of the steel kings of America,\" explained the\nsecretary, whose business it was to know everything. \"This young man\nmust be a millionaire several times over.\"\n\nThe other's eyes narrowed appreciatively.\n\n\"You had better go down and see him, Ivan. Find out what he wants.\"\n\nThe secretary obeyed, closing the door noiselessly behind him. In a few\nminutes he returned.\n\n\"He declines to state his business--says it is entirely private and\npersonal, and that he must see you.\"\n\n\"A millionaire several times over,\" murmured Kramenin. \"Bring him up, my\ndear Ivan.\"\n\nThe secretary left the room once more, and returned escorting Julius.\n\n\"Monsieur Kramenin?\" said the latter abruptly.\n\nThe Russian, studying him attentively with his pale venomous eyes,\nbowed.\n\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" said the American. \"I've got some very important\nbusiness I'd like to talk over with you, if I can see you alone.\" He\nlooked pointedly at the other.\n\n\"My secretary, Monsieur Grieber, from whom I have no secrets.\"\n\n\"That may be so--but I have,\" said Julius dryly. \"So I'd be obliged if\nyou'd tell him to scoot.\"\n\n\"Ivan,\" said the Russian softly, \"perhaps you would not mind retiring\ninto the next room----\"\n\n\"The next room won't do,\" interrupted Julius. \"I know these ducal\nsuites--and I want this one plumb empty except for you and me. Send him\nround to a store to buy a penn'orth of peanuts.\"\n\nThough not particularly enjoying the American's free and easy manner\nof speech, Kramenin was devoured by curiosity. \"Will your business take\nlong to state?\"\n\n\"Might be an all night job if you caught on.\"\n\n\"Very good, Ivan. I shall not require you again this evening. Go to the\ntheatre--take a night off.\"\n\n\"Thank you, your excellency.\"\n\nThe secretary bowed and departed.\n\nJulius stood at the door watching his retreat. Finally, with a satisfied\nsigh, he closed it, and came back to his position in the centre of the\nroom.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Hersheimmer, perhaps you will be so kind as to come to the\npoint?\"\n\n\"I guess that won't take a minute,\" drawled Julius. Then, with an abrupt\nchange of manner: \"Hands up--or I shoot!\"\n\nFor a moment Kramenin stared blindly into the big automatic, then, with\nalmost comical haste, he flung up his hands above his head. In that\ninstant Julius had taken his measure. The man he had to deal with was an\nabject physical coward--the rest would be easy.\n\n\"This is an outrage,\" cried the Russian in a high hysterical voice. \"An\noutrage! Do you mean to kill me?\"\n\n\"Not if you keep your voice down. Don't go edging sideways towards that\nbell. That's better.\"\n\n\"What do you want? Do nothing rashly. Remember my life is of the utmost\nvalue to my country. I may have been maligned----\"\n\n\"I reckon,\" said Julius, \"that the man who let daylight into you would\nbe doing humanity a good turn. But you needn't worry any. I'm not\nproposing to kill you this trip--that is, if you're reasonable.\"\n\nThe Russian quailed before the stern menace in the other's eyes. He\npassed his tongue over his dry lips.\n\n\"What do you want? Money?\"\n\n\"No. I want Jane Finn.\"\n\n\"Jane Finn? I--never heard of her!\"\n\n\"You're a darned liar! You know perfectly who I mean.\"\n\n\"I tell you I've never heard of the girl.\"\n\n\"And I tell you,\" retorted Julius, \"that Little Willie here is just\nhopping mad to go off!\"\n\nThe Russian wilted visibly.\n\n\"You wouldn't dare----\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I would, son!\"\n\nKramenin must have recognized something in the voice that carried\nconviction, for he said sullenly:\n\n\"Well? Granted I do know who you mean--what of it?\"\n\n\"You will tell me now--right here--where she is to be found.\"\n\nKramenin shook his head.\n\n\"I daren't.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I daren't. You ask an impossibility.\"\n\n\"Afraid, eh? Of whom? Mr. Brown? Ah, that tickles you up! There is such\na person, then? I doubted it. And the mere mention of him scares you\nstiff!\"\n\n\"I have seen him,\" said the Russian slowly. \"Spoken to him face to face.\nI did not know it until afterwards. He was one of a crowd. I should not\nknow him again. Who is he really? I do not know. But I know this--he is\na man to fear.\"\n\n\"He'll never know,\" said Julius.\n\n\"He knows everything--and his vengeance is swift. Even\nI--Kramenin!--would not be exempt!\"\n\n\"Then you won't do as I ask you?\"\n\n\"You ask an impossibility.\"\n\n\"Sure that's a pity for you,\" said Julius cheerfully. \"But the world in\ngeneral will benefit.\" He raised the revolver.\n\n\"Stop,\" shrieked the Russian. \"You cannot mean to shoot me?\"\n\n\"Of course I do. I've always heard you Revolutionists held life cheap,\nbut it seems there's a difference when it's your own life in question.\nI gave you just one chance of saving your dirty skin, and that you\nwouldn't take!\"\n\n\"They would kill me!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Julius pleasantly, \"it's up to you. But I'll just say this.\nLittle Willie here is a dead cert, and if I was you I'd take a sporting\nchance with Mr. Brown!\"\n\n\"You will hang if you shoot me,\" muttered the Russian irresolutely.\n\n\"No, stranger, that's where you're wrong. You forget the dollars. A\nbig crowd of solicitors will get busy, and they'll get some high-brow\ndoctors on the job, and the end of it all will be that they'll say my\nbrain was unhinged. I shall spend a few months in a quiet sanatorium, my\nmental health will improve, the doctors will declare me sane again, and\nall will end happily for little Julius. I guess I can bear a few months'\nretirement in order to rid the world of you, but don't you kid yourself\nI'll hang for it!\"\n\nThe Russian believed him. Corrupt himself, he believed implicitly in the\npower of money. He had read of American murder trials running much on\nthe lines indicated by Julius. He had bought and sold justice himself.\nThis virile young American, with the significant drawling voice, had the\nwhip hand of him.\n\n\"I'm going to count five,\" continued Julius, \"and I guess, if you let me\nget past four, you needn't worry any about Mr. Brown. Maybe he'll send\nsome flowers to the funeral, but YOU won't smell them! Are you ready?\nI'll begin. One--two three--four----\"\n\nThe Russian interrupted with a shriek:\n\n\"Do not shoot. I will do all you wish.\"\n\nJulius lowered the revolver.\n\n\"I thought you'd hear sense. Where is the girl?\"\n\n\"At Gatehouse, in Kent. Astley Priors, the place is called.\"\n\n\"Is she a prisoner there?\"\n\n\"She's not allowed to leave the house--though it's safe enough really.\nThe little fool has lost her memory, curse her!\"\n\n\"That's been annoying for you and your friends, I reckon. What about the\nother girl, the one you decoyed away over a week ago?\"\n\n\"She's there too,\" said the Russian sullenly.\n\n\"That's good,\" said Julius. \"Isn't it all panning out beautifully? And a\nlovely night for the run!\"\n\n\"What run?\" demanded Kramenin, with a stare.\n\n\"Down to Gatehouse, sure. I hope you're fond of motoring?\"\n\n\"What do you mean? I refuse to go.\"\n\n\"Now don't get mad. You must see I'm not such a kid as to leave you\nhere. You'd ring up your friends on that telephone first thing! Ah!\" He\nobserved the fall on the other's face. \"You see, you'd got it all fixed.\nNo, sir, you're coming along with me. This your bedroom next door here?\nWalk right in. Little Willie and I will come behind. Put on a thick\ncoat, that's right. Fur lined? And you a Socialist! Now we're ready. We\nwalk downstairs and out through the hall to where my car's waiting. And\ndon't you forget I've got you covered every inch of the way. I can shoot\njust as well through my coat pocket. One word, or a glance even, at one\nof those liveried menials, and there'll sure be a strange face in the\nSulphur and Brimstone Works!\"\n\nTogether they descended the stairs, and passed out to the waiting car.\nThe Russian was shaking with rage. The hotel servants surrounded them.\nA cry hovered on his lips, but at the last minute his nerve failed him.\nThe American was a man of his word.\n\nWhen they reached the car, Julius breathed a sigh of relief. The\ndanger-zone was passed. Fear had successfully hypnotized the man by his\nside.\n\n\"Get in,\" he ordered. Then as he caught the other's sidelong glance,\n\"No, the chauffeur won't help you any. Naval man. Was on a submarine in\nRussia when the Revolution broke out. A brother of his was murdered by\nyour people. George!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" The chauffeur turned his head.\n\n\"This gentleman is a Russian Bolshevik. We don't want to shoot him, but\nit may be necessary. You understand?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, sir.\"\n\n\"I want to go to Gatehouse in Kent. Know the road at all?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, it will be about an hour and a half's run.\"\n\n\"Make it an hour. I'm in a hurry.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best, sir.\" The car shot forward through the traffic.\n\nJulius ensconced himself comfortably by the side of his victim. He kept\nhis hand in the pocket of his coat, but his manner was urbane to the\nlast degree.\n\n\"There was a man I shot once in Arizona----\" he began cheerfully.\n\nAt the end of the hour's run the unfortunate Kramenin was more dead than\nalive. In succession to the anecdote of the Arizona man, there had been\na tough from 'Frisco, and an episode in the Rockies. Julius's narrative\nstyle, if not strictly accurate, was picturesque!\n\nSlowing down, the chauffeur called over his shoulder that they were just\ncoming into Gatehouse. Julius bade the Russian direct them. His plan was\nto drive straight up to the house. There Kramenin was to ask for the two\ngirls. Julius explained to him that Little Willie would not be tolerant\nof failure. Kramenin, by this time, was as putty in the other's hands.\nThe terrific pace they had come had still further unmanned him. He had\ngiven himself up for dead at every corner.\n\nThe car swept up the drive, and stopped before the porch. The chauffeur\nlooked round for orders.\n\n\"Turn the car first, George. Then ring the bell, and get back to your\nplace. Keep the engine going, and be ready to scoot like hell when I\ngive the word.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\nThe front door was opened by the butler. Kramenin felt the muzzle of the\nrevolver pressed against his ribs.\n\n\"Now,\" hissed Julius. \"And be careful.\"\n\nThe Russian beckoned. His lips were white, and his voice was not very\nsteady:\n\n\"It is I--Kramenin! Bring down the girl at once! There is no time to\nlose!\"\n\nWhittington had come down the steps. He uttered an exclamation of\nastonishment at seeing the other.\n\n\"You! What's up? Surely you know the plan----\"\n\nKramenin interrupted him, using the words that have created many\nunnecessary panics:\n\n\"We have been betrayed! Plans must be abandoned. We must save our own\nskins. The girl! And at once! It's our only chance.\"\n\nWhittington hesitated, but for hardly a moment.\n\n\"You have orders--from HIM?\"\n\n\"Naturally! Should I be here otherwise? Hurry! There is no time to be\nlost. The other little fool had better come too.\"\n\nWhittington turned and ran back into the house. The agonizing minutes\nwent by. Then--two figures hastily huddled in cloaks appeared on the\nsteps and were hustled into the car. The smaller of the two was inclined\nto resist and Whittington shoved her in unceremoniously. Julius leaned\nforward, and in doing so the light from the open door lit up his face.\nAnother man on the steps behind Whittington gave a startled exclamation.\nConcealment was at an end.\n\n\"Get a move on, George,\" shouted Julius.\n\nThe chauffeur slipped in his clutch, and with a bound the car started.\n\nThe man on the steps uttered an oath. His hand went to his pocket. There\nwas a flash and a report. The bullet just missed the taller girl by an\ninch.\n\n\"Get down, Jane,\" cried Julius. \"Flat on the bottom of the car.\" He\nthrust her sharply forward, then standing up, he took careful aim and\nfired.\n\n\"Have you hit him?\" cried Tuppence eagerly.\n\n\"Sure,\" replied Julius. \"He isn't killed, though. Skunks like that take\na lot of killing. Are you all right, Tuppence?\"\n\n\"Of course I am. Where's Tommy? And who's this?\" She indicated the\nshivering Kramenin.\n\n\"Tommy's making tracks for the Argentine. I guess he thought you'd\nturned up your toes. Steady through the gate, George! That's right.\nIt'll take 'em at least five minutes to get busy after us. They'll use\nthe telephone, I guess, so look out for snares ahead--and don't take the\ndirect route. Who's this, did you say, Tuppence? Let me present Monsieur\nKramenin. I persuaded him to come on the trip for his health.\"\n\nThe Russian remained mute, still livid with terror.\n\n\"But what made them let us go?\" demanded Tuppence suspiciously.\n\n\"I reckon Monsieur Kramenin here asked them so prettily they just\ncouldn't refuse!\"\n\nThis was too much for the Russian. He burst out vehemently:\n\n\"Curse you--curse you! They know now that I betrayed them. My life won't\nbe safe for an hour in this country.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" assented Julius. \"I'd advise you to make tracks for Russia\nright away.\"\n\n\"Let me go, then,\" cried the other. \"I have done what you asked. Why do\nyou still keep me with you?\"\n\n\"Not for the pleasure of your company. I guess you can get right off now\nif you want to. I thought you'd rather I tooled you back to London.\"\n\n\"You may never reach London,\" snarled the other. \"Let me go here and\nnow.\"\n\n\"Sure thing. Pull up, George. The gentleman's not making the return\ntrip. If I ever come to Russia, Monsieur Kramenin, I shall expect a\nrousing welcome, and----\"\n\nBut before Julius had finished his speech, and before the car had\nfinally halted, the Russian had swung himself out and disappeared into\nthe night.\n\n\"Just a mite impatient to leave us,\" commented Julius, as the car\ngathered way again. \"And no idea of saying good-bye politely to the\nladies. Say, Jane, you can get up on the seat now.\"\n\nFor the first time the girl spoke.\n\n\"How did you 'persuade' him?\" she asked.\n\nJulius tapped his revolver.\n\n\"Little Willie here takes the credit!\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" cried the girl. The colour surged into her face, her eyes\nlooked admiringly at Julius.\n\n\"Annette and I didn't know what was going to happen to us,\" said\nTuppence. \"Old Whittington hurried us off. We thought it was lambs to\nthe slaughter.\"\n\n\"Annette,\" said Julius. \"Is that what you call her?\"\n\nHis mind seemed to be trying to adjust itself to a new idea.\n\n\"It's her name,\" said Tuppence, opening her eyes very wide.\n\n\"Shucks!\" retorted Julius. \"She may think it's her name, because her\nmemory's gone, poor kid. But it's the one real and original Jane Finn\nwe've got here.\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Tuppence.\n\nBut she was interrupted. With an angry spurt, a bullet embedded itself\nin the upholstery of the car just behind her head.\n\n\"Down with you,\" cried Julius. \"It's an ambush. These guys have got busy\npretty quickly. Push her a bit, George.\"\n\nThe car fairly leapt forward. Three more shots rang out, but went\nhappily wide. Julius, upright, leant over the back of the car.\n\n\"Nothing to shoot at,\" he announced gloomily. \"But I guess there'll be\nanother little picnic soon. Ah!\"\n\nHe raised his hand to his cheek.\n\n\"You are hurt?\" said Annette quickly.\n\n\"Only a scratch.\"\n\nThe girl sprang to her feet.\n\n\"Let me out! Let me out, I say! Stop the car. It is me they're after.\nI'm the one they want. You shall not lose your lives because of me. Let\nme go.\" She was fumbling with the fastenings of the door.\n\nJulius took her by both arms, and looked at her. She had spoken with no\ntrace of foreign accent.\n\n\"Sit down, kid,\" he said gently. \"I guess there's nothing wrong with\nyour memory. Been fooling them all the time, eh?\"\n\nThe girl looked at him, nodded, and then suddenly burst into tears.\nJulius patted her on the shoulder.\n\n\"There, there--just you sit tight. We're not going to let you quit.\"\n\nThrough her sobs the girl said indistinctly:\n\n\"You're from home. I can tell by your voice. It makes me home-sick.\"\n\n\"Sure I'm from home. I'm your cousin--Julius Hersheimmer. I came over to\nEurope on purpose to find you--and a pretty dance you've led me.\"\n\nThe car slackened speed. George spoke over his shoulder:\n\n\"Cross-roads here, sir. I'm not sure of the way.\"\n\nThe car slowed down till it hardly moved. As it did so a figure climbed\nsuddenly over the back, and plunged head first into the midst of them.\n\n\"Sorry,\" said Tommy, extricating himself.\n\nA mass of confused exclamations greeted him. He replied to them\nseverally:\n\n\"Was in the bushes by the drive. Hung on behind. Couldn't let you know\nbefore at the pace you were going. It was all I could do to hang on. Now\nthen, you girls, get out!\"\n\n\"Get out?\"\n\n\"Yes. There's a station just up that road. Train due in three minutes.\nYou'll catch it if you hurry.\"\n\n\"What the devil are you driving at?\" demanded Julius. \"Do you think you\ncan fool them by leaving the car?\"\n\n\"You and I aren't going to leave the car. Only the girls.\"\n\n\"You're crazed, Beresford. Stark staring mad! You can't let those girls\ngo off alone. It'll be the end of it if you do.\"\n\nTommy turned to Tuppence.\n\n\"Get out at once, Tuppence. Take her with you, and do just as I say.\nNo one will do you any harm. You're safe. Take the train to London. Go\nstraight to Sir James Peel Edgerton. Mr. Carter lives out of town, but\nyou'll be safe with him.\"\n\n\"Darn you!\" cried Julius. \"You're mad. Jane, you stay where you are.\"\n\nWith a sudden swift movement, Tommy snatched the revolver from Julius's\nhand, and levelled it at him.\n\n\"Now will you believe I'm in earnest? Get out, both of you, and do as I\nsay--or I'll shoot!\"\n\nTuppence sprang out, dragging the unwilling Jane after her.\n\n\"Come on, it's all right. If Tommy's sure--he's sure. Be quick. We'll\nmiss the train.\"\n\nThey started running.\n\nJulius's pent-up rage burst forth.\n\n\"What the hell----\"\n\nTommy interrupted him.\n\n\"Dry up! I want a few words with you, Mr. Julius Hersheimmer.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. JANE'S STORY\n\nHER arm through Jane's, dragging her along, Tuppence reached the\nstation. Her quick ears caught the sound of the approaching train.\n\n\"Hurry up,\" she panted, \"or we'll miss it.\"\n\nThey arrived on the platform just as the train came to a standstill.\nTuppence opened the door of an empty first-class compartment, and the\ntwo girls sank down breathless on the padded seats.\n\nA man looked in, then passed on to the next carriage. Jane started\nnervously. Her eyes dilated with terror. She looked questioningly at\nTuppence.\n\n\"Is he one of them, do you think?\" she breathed.\n\nTuppence shook her head.\n\n\"No, no. It's all right.\" She took Jane's hand in hers. \"Tommy wouldn't\nhave told us to do this unless he was sure we'd be all right.\"\n\n\"But he doesn't know them as I do!\" The girl shivered. \"You can't\nunderstand. Five years! Five long years! Sometimes I thought I should go\nmad.\"\n\n\"Never mind. It's all over.\"\n\n\"Is it?\"\n\nThe train was moving now, speeding through the night at a gradually\nincreasing rate. Suddenly Jane Finn started up.\n\n\"What was that? I thought I saw a face--looking in through the window.\"\n\n\"No, there's nothing. See.\" Tuppence went to the window, and lifting the\nstrap let the pane down.\n\n\"You're sure?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\nThe other seemed to feel some excuse was necessary:\n\n\"I guess I'm acting like a frightened rabbit, but I can't help it. If\nthey caught me now they'd----\" Her eyes opened wide and staring.\n\n\"DON'T!\" implored Tuppence. \"Lie back, and DON'T THINK. You can be quite\nsure that Tommy wouldn't have said it was safe if it wasn't.\"\n\n\"My cousin didn't think so. He didn't want us to do this.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Tuppence, rather embarrassed.\n\n\"What are you thinking of?\" said Jane sharply.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Your voice was so--queer!\"\n\n\"I WAS thinking of something,\" confessed Tuppence. \"But I don't want to\ntell you--not now. I may be wrong, but I don't think so. It's just an\nidea that came into my head a long time ago. Tommy's got it too--I'm\nalmost sure he has. But don't YOU worry--there'll be time enough for\nthat later. And it mayn't be so at all! Do what I tell you--lie back and\ndon't think of anything.\"\n\n\"I'll try.\" The long lashes drooped over the hazel eyes.\n\nTuppence, for her part, sat bolt upright--much in the attitude of a\nwatchful terrier on guard. In spite of herself she was nervous. Her eyes\nflashed continually from one window to the other. She noted the exact\nposition of the communication cord. What it was that she feared, she\nwould have been hard put to it to say. But in her own mind she was\nfar from feeling the confidence displayed in her words. Not that she\ndisbelieved in Tommy, but occasionally she was shaken with doubts as to\nwhether anyone so simple and honest as he was could ever be a match for\nthe fiendish subtlety of the arch-criminal.\n\nIf they once reached Sir James Peel Edgerton in safety, all would be\nwell. But would they reach him? Would not the silent forces of Mr. Brown\nalready be assembling against them? Even that last picture of Tommy,\nrevolver in hand, failed to comfort her. By now he might be overpowered,\nborne down by sheer force of numbers.... Tuppence mapped out her plan of\ncampaign.\n\nAs the train at length drew slowly into Charing Cross, Jane Finn sat up\nwith a start.\n\n\"Have we arrived? I never thought we should!\"\n\n\"Oh, I thought we'd get to London all right. If there's going to be any\nfun, now is when it will begin. Quick, get out. We'll nip into a taxi.\"\n\nIn another minute they were passing the barrier, had paid the necessary\nfares, and were stepping into a taxi.\n\n\"King's Cross,\" directed Tuppence. Then she gave a jump. A man looked in\nat the window, just as they started. She was almost certain it was the\nsame man who had got into the carriage next to them. She had a horrible\nfeeling of being slowly hemmed in on every side.\n\n\"You see,\" she explained to Jane, \"if they think we're going to Sir\nJames, this will put them off the scent. Now they'll imagine we're going\nto Mr. Carter. His country place is north of London somewhere.\"\n\nCrossing Holborn there was a block, and the taxi was held up. This was\nwhat Tuppence had been waiting for.\n\n\"Quick,\" she whispered. \"Open the right-hand door!\"\n\nThe two girls stepped out into the traffic. Two minutes later they were\nseated in another taxi and were retracing their steps, this time direct\nto Carlton House Terrace.\n\n\"There,\" said Tuppence, with great satisfaction, \"this ought to do them.\nI can't help thinking that I'm really rather clever! How that other taxi\nman will swear! But I took his number, and I'll send him a postal order\nto-morrow, so that he won't lose by it if he happens to be genuine.\nWhat's this thing swerving----Oh!\"\n\nThere was a grinding noise and a bump. Another taxi had collided with\nthem.\n\nIn a flash Tuppence was out on the pavement. A policeman was\napproaching. Before he arrived Tuppence had handed the driver five\nshillings, and she and Jane had merged themselves in the crowd.\n\n\"It's only a step or two now,\" said Tuppence breathlessly. The accident\nhad taken place in Trafalgar Square.\n\n\"Do you think the collision was an accident, or done deliberately?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It might have been either.\"\n\nHand-in-hand, the two girls hurried along.\n\n\"It may be my fancy,\" said Tuppence suddenly, \"but I feel as though\nthere was some one behind us.\"\n\n\"Hurry!\" murmured the other. \"Oh, hurry!\"\n\nThey were now at the corner of Carlton House Terrace, and their spirits\nlightened. Suddenly a large and apparently intoxicated man barred their\nway.\n\n\"Good evening, ladies,\" he hiccupped. \"Whither away so fast?\"\n\n\"Let us pass, please,\" said Tuppence imperiously.\n\n\"Just a word with your pretty friend here.\" He stretched out an unsteady\nhand, and clutched Jane by the shoulder. Tuppence heard other footsteps\nbehind. She did not pause to ascertain whether they were friends or\nfoes. Lowering her head, she repeated a manoeuvre of childish days,\nand butted their aggressor full in the capacious middle. The success of\nthese unsportsmanlike tactics was immediate. The man sat down abruptly\non the pavement. Tuppence and Jane took to their heels. The house they\nsought was some way down. Other footsteps echoed behind them. Their\nbreath was coming in choking gasps as they reached Sir James's door.\nTuppence seized the bell and Jane the knocker.\n\nThe man who had stopped them reached the foot of the steps. For a moment\nhe hesitated, and as he did so the door opened. They fell into the hall\ntogether. Sir James came forward from the library door.\n\n\"Hullo! What's this?\"\n\nHe stepped forward, and put his arm round Jane as she swayed\nuncertainly. He half carried her into the library, and laid her on the\nleather couch. From a tantalus on the table he poured out a few drops of\nbrandy, and forced her to drink them. With a sigh she sat up, her eyes\nstill wild and frightened.\n\n\"It's all right. Don't be afraid, my child. You're quite safe.\"\n\nHer breath came more normally, and the colour was returning to her\ncheeks. Sir James looked at Tuppence quizzically.\n\n\"So you're not dead, Miss Tuppence, any more than that Tommy boy of\nyours was!\"\n\n\"The Young Adventurers take a lot of killing,\" boasted Tuppence.\n\n\"So it seems,\" said Sir James dryly. \"Am I right in thinking that the\njoint venture has ended in success, and that this\"--he turned to the\ngirl on the couch--\"is Miss Jane Finn?\"\n\nJane sat up.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said quietly, \"I am Jane Finn. I have a lot to tell you.\"\n\n\"When you are stronger----\"\n\n\"No--now!\" Her voice rose a little. \"I shall feel safer when I have told\neverything.\"\n\n\"As you please,\" said the lawyer.\n\nHe sat down in one of the big arm-chairs facing the couch. In a low\nvoice Jane began her story.\n\n\"I came over on the Lusitania to take up a post in Paris. I was\nfearfully keen about the war, and just dying to help somehow or other. I\nhad been studying French, and my teacher said they were wanting help in\na hospital in Paris, so I wrote and offered my services, and they were\naccepted. I hadn't got any folk of my own, so it made it easy to arrange\nthings.\n\n\"When the Lusitania was torpedoed, a man came up to me. I'd noticed him\nmore than once--and I'd figured it out in my own mind that he was afraid\nof somebody or something. He asked me if I was a patriotic American,\nand told me he was carrying papers which were just life or death to\nthe Allies. He asked me to take charge of them. I was to watch for an\nadvertisement in the Times. If it didn't appear, I was to take them to\nthe American Ambassador.\n\n\"Most of what followed seems like a nightmare still. I see it in my\ndreams sometimes.... I'll hurry over that part. Mr. Danvers had told me\nto watch out. He might have been shadowed from New York, but he didn't\nthink so. At first I had no suspicions, but on the boat to Holyhead I\nbegan to get uneasy. There was one woman who had been very keen to look\nafter me, and chum up with me generally--a Mrs. Vandemeyer. At first I'd\nbeen only grateful to her for being so kind to me; but all the time I\nfelt there was something about her I didn't like, and on the Irish\nboat I saw her talking to some queer-looking men, and from the way they\nlooked I saw that they were talking about me. I remembered that she'd\nbeen quite near me on the Lusitania when Mr. Danvers gave me the packet,\nand before that she'd tried to talk to him once or twice. I began to get\nscared, but I didn't quite see what to do.\n\n\"I had a wild idea of stopping at Holyhead, and not going on to London\nthat day, but I soon saw that that would be plumb foolishness. The only\nthing was to act as though I'd noticed nothing, and hope for the best.\nI couldn't see how they could get me if I was on my guard. One thing\nI'd done already as a precaution--ripped open the oilskin packet and\nsubstituted blank paper, and then sewn it up again. So, if anyone did\nmanage to rob me of it, it wouldn't matter.\n\n\"What to do with the real thing worried me no end. Finally I opened it\nout flat--there were only two sheets--and laid it between two of the\nadvertisement pages of a magazine. I stuck the two pages together\nround the edge with some gum off an envelope. I carried the magazine\ncarelessly stuffed into the pocket of my ulster.\n\n\"At Holyhead I tried to get into a carriage with people that looked all\nright, but in a queer way there seemed always to be a crowd round me\nshoving and pushing me just the way I didn't want to go. There was\nsomething uncanny and frightening about it. In the end I found myself in\na carriage with Mrs. Vandemeyer after all. I went out into the corridor,\nbut all the other carriages were full, so I had to go back and sit down.\nI consoled myself with the thought that there were other people in the\ncarriage--there was quite a nice-looking man and his wife sitting just\nopposite. So I felt almost happy about it until just outside London. I\nhad leaned back and closed my eyes. I guess they thought I was asleep,\nbut my eyes weren't quite shut, and suddenly I saw the nice-looking man\nget something out of his bag and hand it to Mrs. Vandemeyer, and as he\ndid so he WINKED....\n\n\"I can't tell you how that wink sort of froze me through and through. My\nonly thought was to get out in the corridor as quick as ever I could. I\ngot up, trying to look natural and easy. Perhaps they saw something--I\ndon't know--but suddenly Mrs. Vandemeyer said 'Now,' and flung something\nover my nose and mouth as I tried to scream. At the same moment I felt a\nterrific blow on the back of my head....\"\n\nShe shuddered. Sir James murmured something sympathetically. In a minute\nshe resumed:\n\n\"I don't know how long it was before I came back to consciousness. I\nfelt very ill and sick. I was lying on a dirty bed. There was a\nscreen round it, but I could hear two people talking in the room. Mrs.\nVandemeyer was one of them. I tried to listen, but at first I couldn't\ntake much in. When at last I did begin to grasp what was going on--I was\njust terrified! I wonder I didn't scream right out there and then.\n\n\"They hadn't found the papers. They'd got the oilskin packet with the\nblanks, and they were just mad! They didn't know whether I'd changed the\npapers, or whether Danvers had been carrying a dummy message, while\nthe real one was sent another way. They spoke of\"--she closed her\neyes--\"torturing me to find out!\n\n\"I'd never known what fear--really sickening fear--was before! Once\nthey came to look at me. I shut my eyes and pretended to be still\nunconscious, but I was afraid they'd hear the beating of my heart.\nHowever, they went away again. I began thinking madly. What could I do?\nI knew I wouldn't be able to stand up against torture very long.\n\n\"Suddenly something put the thought of loss of memory into my head. The\nsubject had always interested me, and I'd read an awful lot about it.\nI had the whole thing at my finger-tips. If only I could succeed in\ncarrying the bluff through, it might save me. I said a prayer, and drew\na long breath. Then I opened my eyes and started babbling in FRENCH!\n\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer came round the screen at once. Her face was so wicked I\nnearly died, but I smiled up at her doubtfully, and asked her in French\nwhere I was.\n\n\"It puzzled her, I could see. She called the man she had been talking\nto. He stood by the screen with his face in shadow. He spoke to me in\nFrench. His voice was very ordinary and quiet, but somehow, I don't know\nwhy, he scared me worse than the woman. I felt he'd seen right through\nme, but I went on playing my part. I asked again where I was, and then\nwent on that there was something I MUST remember--MUST remember--only\nfor the moment it was all gone. I worked myself up to be more and more\ndistressed. He asked me my name. I said I didn't know--that I couldn't\nremember anything at all.\n\n\"Suddenly he caught my wrist, and began twisting it. The pain was awful.\nI screamed. He went on. I screamed and screamed, but I managed to shriek\nout things in French. I don't know how long I could have gone on, but\nluckily I fainted. The last thing I heard was his voice saying: 'That's\nnot bluff! Anyway, a kid of her age wouldn't know enough.' I guess he\nforgot American girls are older for their age than English ones, and\ntake more interest in scientific subjects.\n\n\"When I came to, Mrs. Vandemeyer was sweet as honey to me. She'd had her\norders, I guess. She spoke to me in French--told me I'd had a shock\nand been very ill. I should be better soon. I pretended to be rather\ndazed--murmured something about the 'doctor' having hurt my wrist. She\nlooked relieved when I said that.\n\n\"By and by she went out of the room altogether. I was suspicious still,\nand lay quite quiet for some time. In the end, however, I got up and\nwalked round the room, examining it. I thought that even if anyone\nWAS watching me from somewhere, it would seem natural enough under the\ncircumstances. It was a squalid, dirty place. There were no windows,\nwhich seemed queer. I guessed the door would be locked, but I didn't\ntry it. There were some battered old pictures on the walls, representing\nscenes from Faust.\"\n\nJane's two listeners gave a simultaneous \"Ah!\" The girl nodded.\n\n\"Yes--it was the place in Soho where Mr. Beresford was imprisoned. Of\ncourse, at the time I didn't even know if I was in London. One thing was\nworrying me dreadfully, but my heart gave a great throb of relief when\nI saw my ulster lying carelessly over the back of a chair. AND THE\nMAGAZINE WAS STILL ROLLED UP IN THE POCKET!\n\n\"If only I could be certain that I was not being overlooked! I looked\ncarefully round the walls. There didn't seem to be a peep-hole of any\nkind--nevertheless I felt kind of sure there must be. All of a sudden I\nsat down on the edge of the table, and put my face in my hands, sobbing\nout a 'Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!' I've got very sharp ears. I distinctly heard\nthe rustle of a dress, and slight creak. That was enough for me. I was\nbeing watched!\n\n\"I lay down on the bed again, and by and by Mrs. Vandemeyer brought me\nsome supper. She was still sweet as they make them. I guess she'd been\ntold to win my confidence. Presently she produced the oilskin packet,\nand asked me if I recognized it, watching me like a lynx all the time.\n\n\"I took it and turned it over in a puzzled sort of way. Then I shook my\nhead. I said that I felt I OUGHT to remember something about it, that it\nwas just as though it was all coming back, and then, before I could get\nhold of it, it went again. Then she told me that I was her niece, and\nthat I was to call her 'Aunt Rita.' I did obediently, and she told me\nnot to worry--my memory would soon come back.\n\n\"That was an awful night. I'd made my plan whilst I was waiting for her.\nThe papers were safe so far, but I couldn't take the risk of leaving\nthem there any longer. They might throw that magazine away any minute.\nI lay awake waiting until I judged it must be about two o'clock in the\nmorning. Then I got up as softly as I could, and felt in the dark along\nthe left-hand wall. Very gently, I unhooked one of the pictures from its\nnail--Marguerite with her casket of jewels. I crept over to my coat and\ntook out the magazine, and an odd envelope or two that I had shoved in.\nThen I went to the washstand, and damped the brown paper at the back\nof the picture all round. Presently I was able to pull it away. I had\nalready torn out the two stuck-together pages from the magazine, and now\nI slipped them with their precious enclosure between the picture and its\nbrown paper backing. A little gum from the envelopes helped me to\nstick the latter up again. No one would dream the picture had ever been\ntampered with. I rehung it on the wall, put the magazine back in my\ncoat pocket, and crept back to bed. I was pleased with my hiding-place.\nThey'd never think of pulling to pieces one of their own pictures. I\nhoped that they'd come to the conclusion that Danvers had been carrying\na dummy all along, and that, in the end, they'd let me go.\n\n\"As a matter of fact, I guess that's what they did think at first, and,\nin a way, it was dangerous for me. I learnt afterwards that they nearly\ndid away with me then and there--there was never much chance of their\n'letting me go'--but the first man, who was the boss, preferred to keep\nme alive on the chance of my having hidden them, and being able to tell\nwhere if I recovered my memory. They watched me constantly for weeks.\nSometimes they'd ask me questions by the hour--I guess there was nothing\nthey didn't know about the third degree!--but somehow I managed to hold\nmy own. The strain of it was awful, though...\n\n\"They took me back to Ireland, and over every step of the Journey again,\nin case I'd hidden it somewhere en route. Mrs. Vandemeyer and another\nwoman never left me for a moment. They spoke of me as a young relative\nof Mrs. Vandemeyer's whose mind was affected by the shock of the\nLusitania. There was no one I could appeal to for help without giving\nmyself away to THEM, and if I risked it and failed--and Mrs. Vandemeyer\nlooked so rich, and so beautifully dressed, that I felt convinced they'd\ntake her word against mine, and think it was part of my mental trouble\nto think myself 'persecuted'--I felt that the horrors in store for me\nwould be too awful once they knew I'd been only shamming.\"\n\nSir James nodded comprehendingly.\n\n\"Mrs. Vandemeyer was a woman of great personality. With that and her\nsocial position she would have had little difficulty in imposing her\npoint of view in preference to yours. Your sensational accusations\nagainst her would not easily have found credence.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought. It ended in my being sent to a sanatorium at\nBournemouth. I couldn't make up my mind at first whether it was a sham\naffair or genuine. A hospital nurse had charge of me. I was a special\npatient. She seemed so nice and normal that at last I determined to\nconfide in her. A merciful providence just saved me in time from falling\ninto the trap. My door happened to be ajar, and I heard her talking\nto some one in the passage. SHE WAS ONE OF THEM! They still fancied it\nmight be a bluff on my part, and she was put in charge of me to make\nsure! After that, my nerve went completely. I dared trust nobody.\n\n\"I think I almost hypnotized myself. After a while, I almost forgot\nthat I was really Jane Finn. I was so bent on playing the part of Janet\nVandemeyer that my nerves began to play me tricks. I became really\nill--for months I sank into a sort of stupor. I felt sure I should\ndie soon, and that nothing really mattered. A sane person shut up in a\nlunatic asylum often ends by becoming insane, they say. I guess I was\nlike that. Playing my part had become second nature to me. I wasn't even\nunhappy in the end--just apathetic. Nothing seemed to matter. And the\nyears went on.\n\n\"And then suddenly things seemed to change. Mrs. Vandemeyer came down\nfrom London. She and the doctor asked me questions, experimented with\nvarious treatments. There was some talk of sending me to a specialist in\nParis. In the end, they did not dare risk it. I overheard something that\nseemed to show that other people--friends--were looking for me. I\nlearnt later that the nurse who had looked after me went to Paris,\nand consulted a specialist, representing herself to be me. He put her\nthrough some searching tests, and exposed her loss of memory to be\nfraudulent; but she had taken a note of his methods and reproduced\nthem on me. I dare say I couldn't have deceived the specialist for a\nminute--a man who has made a lifelong study of a thing is unique--but\nI managed once again to hold my own with them. The fact that I'd not\nthought of myself as Jane Finn for so long made it easier.\n\n\"One night I was whisked off to London at a moment's notice. They took\nme back to the house in Soho. Once I got away from the sanatorium I felt\ndifferent--as though something in me that had been buried for a long\ntime was waking up again.\n\n\"They sent me in to wait on Mr. Beresford. (Of course I didn't know\nhis name then.) I was suspicious--I thought it was another trap. But he\nlooked so honest, I could hardly believe it. However, I was careful in\nall I said, for I knew we could be overheard. There's a small hole, high\nup in the wall.\n\n\"But on the Sunday afternoon a message was brought to the house. They\nwere all very disturbed. Without their knowing, I listened. Word had\ncome that he was to be killed. I needn't tell the next part, because\nyou know it. I thought I'd have time to rush up and get the papers from\ntheir hiding-place, but I was caught. So I screamed out that he was\nescaping, and I said I wanted to go back to Marguerite. I shouted the\nname three times very loud. I knew the others would think I meant\nMrs. Vandemeyer, but I hoped it might make Mr. Beresford think of the\npicture. He'd unhooked one the first day--that's what made me hesitate\nto trust him.\"\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"Then the papers,\" said Sir James slowly, \"are still at the back of the\npicture in that room.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" The girl had sunk back on the sofa exhausted with the strain of\nthe long story.\n\nSir James rose to his feet. He looked at his watch.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, \"we must go at once.\"\n\n\"To-night?\" queried Tuppence, surprised.\n\n\"To-morrow may be too late,\" said Sir James gravely. \"Besides, by\ngoing to-night we have the chance of capturing that great man and\nsuper-criminal--Mr. Brown!\"\n\nThere was dead silence, and Sir James continued:\n\n\"You have been followed here--not a doubt of it. When we leave the house\nwe shall be followed again, but not molested, FOR IT IS MR. BROWN'S PLAN\nTHAT WE ARE TO LEAD HIM. But the Soho house is under police supervision\nnight and day. There are several men watching it. When we enter that\nhouse, Mr. Brown will not draw back--he will risk all, on the chance\nof obtaining the spark to fire his mine. And he fancies the risk not\ngreat--since he will enter in the guise of a friend!\"\n\nTuppence flushed, then opened her mouth impulsively.\n\n\"But there's something you don't know--that we haven't told you.\" Her\neyes dwelt on Jane in perplexity.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked the other sharply. \"No hesitations, Miss Tuppence.\nWe need to be sure of our going.\"\n\nBut Tuppence, for once, seemed tongue-tied.\n\n\"It's so difficult--you see, if I'm wrong--oh, it would be dreadful.\"\nShe made a grimace at the unconscious Jane. \"Never forgive me,\" she\nobserved cryptically.\n\n\"You want me to help you out, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, please. YOU know who Mr. Brown is, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sir James gravely. \"At last I do.\"\n\n\"At last?\" queried Tuppence doubtfully. \"Oh, but I thought----\" She\npaused.\n\n\"You thought correctly, Miss Tuppence. I have been morally certain of\nhis identity for some time--ever since the night of Mrs. Vandemeyer's\nmysterious death.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" breathed Tuppence.\n\n\"For there we are up against the logic of facts. There are only two\nsolutions. Either the chloral was administered by her own hand, which\ntheory I reject utterly, or else----\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Or else it was administered in the brandy you gave her. Only three\npeople touched that brandy--you, Miss Tuppence, I myself, and one\nother--Mr. Julius Hersheimmer!\"\n\nJane Finn stirred and sat up, regarding the speaker with wide astonished\neyes.\n\n\"At first, the thing seemed utterly impossible. Mr. Hersheimmer, as the\nson of a prominent millionaire, was a well-known figure in America. It\nseemed utterly impossible that he and Mr. Brown could be one and the\nsame. But you cannot escape from the logic of facts. Since the thing\nwas so--it must be accepted. Remember Mrs. Vandemeyer's sudden and\ninexplicable agitation. Another proof, if proof was needed.\n\n\"I took an early opportunity of giving you a hint. From some words of\nMr. Hersheimmer's at Manchester, I gathered that you had understood and\nacted on that hint. Then I set to work to prove the impossible possible.\nMr. Beresford rang me up and told me, what I had already suspected,\nthat the photograph of Miss Jane Finn had never really been out of Mr.\nHersheimmer's possession----\"\n\nBut the girl interrupted. Springing to her feet, she cried out angrily:\n\n\"What do you mean? What are you trying to suggest? That Mr. Brown is\nJULIUS? Julius--my own cousin!\"\n\n\"No, Miss Finn,\" said Sir James unexpectedly. \"Not your cousin. The man\nwho calls himself Julius Hersheimmer is no relation to you whatsoever.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. MR. BROWN\n\nSIR James's words came like a bomb-shell. Both girls looked equally\npuzzled. The lawyer went across to his desk, and returned with a small\nnewspaper cutting, which he handed to Jane. Tuppence read it over\nher shoulder. Mr. Carter would have recognized it. It referred to the\nmysterious man found dead in New York.\n\n\"As I was saying to Miss Tuppence,\" resumed the lawyer, \"I set to work\nto prove the impossible possible. The great stumbling-block was the\nundeniable fact that Julius Hersheimmer was not an assumed name. When I\ncame across this paragraph my problem was solved. Julius Hersheimmer set\nout to discover what had become of his cousin. He went out West, where\nhe obtained news of her and her photograph to aid him in his search. On\nthe eve of his departure from New York he was set upon and murdered. His\nbody was dressed in shabby clothes, and the face disfigured to prevent\nidentification. Mr. Brown took his place. He sailed immediately for\nEngland. None of the real Hersheimmer's friends or intimates saw him\nbefore he sailed--though indeed it would hardly have mattered if they\nhad, the impersonation was so perfect. Since then he had been hand and\nglove with those sworn to hunt him down. Every secret of theirs has been\nknown to him. Only once did he come near disaster. Mrs. Vandemeyer knew\nhis secret. It was no part of his plan that that huge bribe should ever\nbe offered to her. But for Miss Tuppence's fortunate change of plan, she\nwould have been far away from the flat when we arrived there. Exposure\nstared him in the face. He took a desperate step, trusting in his\nassumed character to avert suspicion. He nearly succeeded--but not\nquite.\"\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" murmured Jane. \"He seemed so splendid.\"\n\n\"The real Julius Hersheimmer WAS a splendid fellow! And Mr. Brown is\na consummate actor. But ask Miss Tuppence if she also has not had her\nsuspicions.\"\n\nJane turned mutely to Tuppence. The latter nodded.\n\n\"I didn't want to say it, Jane--I knew it would hurt you. And, after\nall, I couldn't be sure. I still don't understand why, if he's Mr.\nBrown, he rescued us.\"\n\n\"Was it Julius Hersheimmer who helped you to escape?\"\n\nTuppence recounted to Sir James the exciting events of the evening,\nending up: \"But I can't see WHY!\"\n\n\"Can't you? I can. So can young Beresford, by his actions. As a last\nhope Jane Finn was to be allowed to escape--and the escape must be\nmanaged so that she harbours no suspicions of its being a put-up job.\nThey're not averse to young Beresford's being in the neighbourhood, and,\nif necessary, communicating with you. They'll take care to get him out\nof the way at the right minute. Then Julius Hersheimmer dashes up and\nrescues you in true melodramatic style. Bullets fly--but don't hit\nanybody. What would have happened next? You would have driven straight\nto the house in Soho and secured the document which Miss Finn would\nprobably have entrusted to her cousin's keeping. Or, if he conducted the\nsearch, he would have pretended to find the hiding-place already rifled.\nHe would have had a dozen ways of dealing with the situation, but the\nresult would have been the same. And I rather fancy some accident would\nhave happened to both of you. You see, you know rather an inconvenient\namount. That's a rough outline. I admit I was caught napping; but\nsomebody else wasn't.\"\n\n\"Tommy,\" said Tuppence softly.\n\n\"Yes. Evidently when the right moment came to get rid of him--he was too\nsharp for them. All the same, I'm not too easy in my mind about him.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because Julius Hersheimmer is Mr. Brown,\" said Sir James dryly. \"And it\ntakes more than one man and a revolver to hold up Mr. Brown....\"\n\nTuppence paled a little.\n\n\"What can we do?\"\n\n\"Nothing until we've been to the house in Soho. If Beresford has still\ngot the upper hand, there's nothing to fear. If otherwise, our enemy\nwill come to find us, and he will not find us unprepared!\" From a drawer\nin the desk, he took a service revolver, and placed it in his coat\npocket.\n\n\"Now we're ready. I know better than even to suggest going without you,\nMiss Tuppence----\"\n\n\"I should think so indeed!\"\n\n\"But I do suggest that Miss Finn should remain here. She will be\nperfectly safe, and I am afraid she is absolutely worn out with all she\nhas been through.\"\n\nBut to Tuppence's surprise Jane shook her head.\n\n\"No. I guess I'm going too. Those papers were my trust. I must go\nthrough with this business to the end. I'm heaps better now anyway.\"\n\nSir James's car was ordered round. During the short drive Tuppence's\nheart beat tumultuously. In spite of momentary qualms of uneasiness\nrespecting Tommy, she could not but feel exultation. They were going to\nwin!\n\nThe car drew up at the corner of the square and they got out. Sir James\nwent up to a plain-clothes man who was on duty with several others, and\nspoke to him. Then he rejoined the girls.\n\n\"No one has gone into the house so far. It is being watched at the back\nas well, so they are quite sure of that. Anyone who attempts to enter\nafter we have done so will be arrested immediately. Shall we go in?\"\n\nA policeman produced a key. They all knew Sir James well. They had also\nhad orders respecting Tuppence. Only the third member of the party was\nunknown to them. The three entered the house, pulling the door to behind\nthem. Slowly they mounted the rickety stairs. At the top was the ragged\ncurtain hiding the recess where Tommy had hidden that day. Tuppence had\nheard the story from Jane in her character of \"Annette.\" She looked at\nthe tattered velvet with interest. Even now she could almost swear it\nmoved--as though some one was behind it. So strong was the illusion\nthat she almost fancied she could make out the outline of a form....\nSupposing Mr. Brown--Julius--was there waiting....\n\nImpossible of course! Yet she almost went back to put the curtain aside\nand make sure....\n\nNow they were entering the prison room. No place for anyone to hide\nhere, thought Tuppence, with a sigh of relief, then chided herself\nindignantly. She must not give way to this foolish fancying--this\ncurious insistent feeling that MR. BROWN WAS IN THE HOUSE.... Hark! what\nwas that? A stealthy footstep on the stairs? There WAS some one in the\nhouse! Absurd! She was becoming hysterical.\n\nJane had gone straight to the picture of Marguerite. She unhooked it\nwith a steady hand. The dust lay thick upon it, and festoons of cobwebs\nlay between it and the wall. Sir James handed her a pocket-knife, and\nshe ripped away the brown paper from the back.... The advertisement\npage of a magazine fell out. Jane picked it up. Holding apart the frayed\ninner edges she extracted two thin sheets covered with writing!\n\nNo dummy this time! The real thing!\n\n\"We've got it,\" said Tuppence. \"At last....\"\n\nThe moment was almost breathless in its emotion. Forgotten the faint\ncreakings, the imagined noises of a minute ago. None of them had eyes\nfor anything but what Jane held in her hand.\n\nSir James took it, and scrutinized it attentively.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said quietly, \"this is the ill-fated draft treaty!\"\n\n\"We've succeeded,\" said Tuppence. There was awe and an almost wondering\nunbelief in her voice.\n\nSir James echoed her words as he folded the paper carefully and put it\naway in his pocket-book, then he looked curiously round the dingy room.\n\n\"It was here that our young friend was confined for so long, was\nit not?\" he said. \"A truly sinister room. You notice the absence of\nwindows, and the thickness of the close-fitting door. Whatever took\nplace here would never be heard by the outside world.\"\n\nTuppence shivered. His words woke a vague alarm in her. What if there\nWAS some one concealed in the house? Some one who might bar that door on\nthem, and leave them to die like rats in a trap? Then she realized the\nabsurdity of her thought. The house was surrounded by police who, if\nthey failed to reappear, would not hesitate to break in and make a\nthorough search. She smiled at her own foolishness--then looked up with\na start to find Sir James watching her. He gave her an emphatic little\nnod.\n\n\"Quite right, Miss Tuppence. You scent danger. So do I. So does Miss\nFinn.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted Jane. \"It's absurd--but I can't help it.\"\n\nSir James nodded again.\n\n\"You feel--as we all feel--THE PRESENCE OF MR. BROWN. Yes\"--as Tuppence\nmade a movement--\"not a doubt of it--MR. BROWN IS HERE....\"\n\n\"In this house?\"\n\n\"In this room.... You don't understand? I AM MR. BROWN....\"\n\nStupefied, unbelieving, they stared at him. The very lines of his face\nhad changed. It was a different man who stood before them. He smiled a\nslow cruel smile.\n\n\"Neither of you will leave this room alive! You said just now we had\nsucceeded. I have succeeded! The draft treaty is mine.\" His smile grew\nwider as he looked at Tuppence. \"Shall I tell you how it will be? Sooner\nor later the police will break in, and they will find three victims of\nMr. Brown--three, not two, you understand, but fortunately the third\nwill not be dead, only wounded, and will be able to describe the attack\nwith a wealth of detail! The treaty? It is in the hands of Mr. Brown. So\nno one will think of searching the pockets of Sir James Peel Edgerton!\"\n\nHe turned to Jane.\n\n\"You outwitted me. I make my acknowledgments. But you will not do it\nagain.\"\n\nThere was a faint sound behind him, but, intoxicated with success, he\ndid not turn his head.\n\nHe slipped his hand into his pocket.\n\n\"Checkmate to the Young Adventurers,\" he said, and slowly raised the big\nautomatic.\n\nBut, even as he did so, he felt himself seized from behind in a grip of\niron. The revolver was wrenched from his hand, and the voice of Julius\nHersheimmer said drawlingly:\n\n\"I guess you're caught redhanded with the goods upon you.\"\n\nThe blood rushed to the K.C.'s face, but his self-control was\nmarvellous, as he looked from one to the other of his two captors. He\nlooked longest at Tommy.\n\n\"You,\" he said beneath his breath. \"YOU! I might have known.\"\n\nSeeing that he was disposed to offer no resistance, their grip\nslackened. Quick as a flash his left hand, the hand which bore the big\nsignet ring, was raised to his lips....\n\n\"'Ave, Caesar! te morituri salutant,'\" he said, still looking at Tommy.\n\nThen his face changed, and with a long convulsive shudder he fell\nforward in a crumpled heap, whilst an odour of bitter almonds filled the\nair.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. A SUPPER PARTY AT THE SAVOY\n\nTHE supper party given by Mr. Julius Hersheimmer to a few friends on the\nevening of the 30th will long be remembered in catering circles. It took\nplace in a private room, and Mr. Hersheimmer's orders were brief and\nforcible. He gave carte blanche--and when a millionaire gives carte\nblanche he usually gets it!\n\nEvery delicacy out of season was duly provided. Waiters carried bottles\nof ancient and royal vintage with loving care. The floral decorations\ndefied the seasons, and fruits of the earth as far apart as May and\nNovember found themselves miraculously side by side. The list of guests\nwas small and select. The American Ambassador, Mr. Carter, who had taken\nthe liberty, he said, of bringing an old friend, Sir William Beresford,\nwith him, Archdeacon Cowley, Dr. Hall, those two youthful adventurers,\nMiss Prudence Cowley and Mr. Thomas Beresford, and last, but not least,\nas guest of honour, Miss Jane Finn.\n\nJulius had spared no pains to make Jane's appearance a success. A\nmysterious knock had brought Tuppence to the door of the apartment she\nwas sharing with the American girl. It was Julius. In his hand he held a\ncheque.\n\n\"Say, Tuppence,\" he began, \"will you do me a good turn? Take this, and\nget Jane regularly togged up for this evening. You're all coming to\nsupper with me at the Savoy. See? Spare no expense. You get me?\"\n\n\"Sure thing,\" mimicked Tuppence. \"We shall enjoy ourselves. It will be a\npleasure dressing Jane. She's the loveliest thing I've ever seen.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" agreed Mr. Hersheimmer fervently.\n\nHis fervour brought a momentary twinkle to Tuppence's eye.\n\n\"By the way, Julius,\" she remarked demurely, \"I--haven't given you my\nanswer yet.\"\n\n\"Answer?\" said Julius. His face paled.\n\n\"You know--when you asked me to--marry you,\" faltered Tuppence, her\neyes downcast in the true manner of the early Victorian heroine, \"and\nwouldn't take no for an answer. I've thought it well over----\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Julius. The perspiration stood on his forehead.\n\nTuppence relented suddenly.\n\n\"You great idiot!\" she said. \"What on earth induced you to do it? I\ncould see at the time you didn't care a twopenny dip for me!\"\n\n\"Not at all. I had--and still have--the highest sentiments of esteem and\nrespect--and admiration for you----\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said Tuppence. \"Those are the kind of sentiments that very soon\ngo to the wall when the other sentiment comes along! Don't they, old\nthing?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said Julius stiffly, but a large and\nburning blush overspread his countenance.\n\n\"Shucks!\" retorted Tuppence. She laughed, and closed the door, reopening\nit to add with dignity: \"Morally, I shall always consider I have been\njilted!\"\n\n\"What was it?\" asked Jane as Tuppence rejoined her.\n\n\"Julius.\"\n\n\"What did he want?\"\n\n\"Really, I think, he wanted to see you, but I wasn't going to let him.\nNot until to-night, when you're going to burst upon every one like King\nSolomon in his glory! Come on! WE'RE GOING TO SHOP!\"\n\nTo most people the 29th, the much-heralded \"Labour Day,\" had passed much\nas any other day. Speeches were made in the Park and Trafalgar Square.\nStraggling processions, singing the Red Flag, wandered through the\nstreets in a more or less aimless manner. Newspapers which had hinted at\na general strike, and the inauguration of a reign of terror, were forced\nto hide their diminished heads. The bolder and more astute among\nthem sought to prove that peace had been effected by following their\ncounsels. In the Sunday papers a brief notice of the sudden death of Sir\nJames Peel Edgerton, the famous K.C., had appeared. Monday's paper\ndealt appreciatively with the dead man's career. The exact manner of his\nsudden death was never made public.\n\nTommy had been right in his forecast of the situation. It had been a\none-man show. Deprived of their chief, the organization fell to pieces.\nKramenin had made a precipitate return to Russia, leaving England early\non Sunday morning. The gang had fled from Astley Priors in a panic,\nleaving behind, in their haste, various damaging documents which\ncompromised them hopelessly. With these proofs of conspiracy in their\nhands, aided further by a small brown diary taken from the pocket of\nthe dead man which had contained a full and damning resume of the whole\nplot, the Government had called an eleventh-hour conference. The Labour\nleaders were forced to recognize that they had been used as a cat's\npaw. Certain concessions were made by the Government, and were eagerly\naccepted. It was to be Peace, not War!\n\nBut the Cabinet knew by how narrow a margin they had escaped utter\ndisaster. And burnt in on Mr. Carter's brain was the strange scene which\nhad taken place in the house in Soho the night before.\n\nHe had entered the squalid room to find that great man, the friend of\na lifetime, dead--betrayed out of his own mouth. From the dead man's\npocket-book he had retrieved the ill-omened draft treaty, and then\nand there, in the presence of the other three, it had been reduced to\nashes.... England was saved!\n\nAnd now, on the evening of the 30th, in a private room at the Savoy, Mr.\nJulius P. Hersheimmer was receiving his guests.\n\nMr. Carter was the first to arrive. With him was a choleric-looking old\ngentleman, at sight of whom Tommy flushed up to the roots of his hair.\nHe came forward.\n\n\"Ha!\" said the old gentleman, surveying him apoplectically. \"So you're\nmy nephew, are you? Not much to look at--but you've done good work, it\nseems. Your mother must have brought you up well after all. Shall we\nlet bygones be bygones, eh? You're my heir, you know; and in future I\npropose to make you an allowance--and you can look upon Chalmers Park as\nyour home.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir, it's awfully decent of you.\"\n\n\"Where's this young lady I've been hearing such a lot about?\"\n\nTommy introduced Tuppence.\n\n\"Ha!\" said Sir William, eyeing her. \"Girls aren't what they used to be\nin my young days.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are,\" said Tuppence. \"Their clothes are different, perhaps,\nbut they themselves are just the same.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps you're right. Minxes then--minxes now!\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Tuppence. \"I'm a frightful minx myself.\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" said the old gentleman, chuckling, and pinched her ear\nin high good-humour. Most young women were terrified of the \"old bear,\"\nas they termed him. Tuppence's pertness delighted the old misogynist.\n\nThen came the timid archdeacon, a little bewildered by the company in\nwhich he found himself, glad that his daughter was considered to have\ndistinguished herself, but unable to help glancing at her from time\nto time with nervous apprehension. But Tuppence behaved admirably. She\nforbore to cross her legs, set a guard upon her tongue, and steadfastly\nrefused to smoke.\n\nDr. Hall came next, and he was followed by the American Ambassador.\n\n\"We might as well sit down,\" said Julius, when he had introduced all his\nguests to each other. \"Tuppence, will you----\"\n\nHe indicated the place of honour with a wave of his hand.\n\nBut Tuppence shook her head.\n\n\"No--that's Jane's place! When one thinks of how she's held out all\nthese years, she ought to be made the queen of the feast to-night.\"\n\nJulius flung her a grateful glance, and Jane came forward shyly to the\nallotted seat. Beautiful as she had seemed before, it was as nothing to\nthe loveliness that now went fully adorned. Tuppence had performed her\npart faithfully. The model gown supplied by a famous dressmaker had been\nentitled \"A tiger lily.\" It was all golds and reds and browns, and out\nof it rose the pure column of the girl's white throat, and the bronze\nmasses of hair that crowned her lovely head. There was admiration in\nevery eye, as she took her seat.\n\nSoon the supper party was in full swing, and with one accord Tommy was\ncalled upon for a full and complete explanation.\n\n\"You've been too darned close about the whole business,\" Julius accused\nhim. \"You let on to me that you were off to the Argentine--though I\nguess you had your reasons for that. The idea of both you and Tuppence\ncasting me for the part of Mr. Brown just tickles me to death!\"\n\n\"The idea was not original to them,\" said Mr. Carter gravely. \"It was\nsuggested, and the poison very carefully instilled, by a past-master in\nthe art. The paragraph in the New York paper suggested the plan to him,\nand by means of it he wove a web that nearly enmeshed you fatally.\"\n\n\"I never liked him,\" said Julius. \"I felt from the first that there was\nsomething wrong about him, and I always suspected that it was he who\nsilenced Mrs. Vandemeyer so appositely. But it wasn't till I heard that\nthe order for Tommy's execution came right on the heels of our interview\nwith him that Sunday that I began to tumble to the fact that he was the\nbig bug himself.\"\n\n\"I never suspected it at all,\" lamented Tuppence. \"I've always thought\nI was so much cleverer than Tommy--but he's undoubtedly scored over me\nhandsomely.\"\n\nJulius agreed.\n\n\"Tommy's been the goods this trip! And, instead of sitting there as dumb\nas a fish, let him banish his blushes, and tell us all about it.\"\n\n\"Hear! hear!\"\n\n\"There's nothing to tell,\" said Tommy, acutely uncomfortable. \"I was an\nawful mug--right up to the time I found that photograph of Annette, and\nrealized that she was Jane Finn. Then I remembered how persistently she\nhad shouted out that word 'Marguerite'--and I thought of the pictures,\nand--well, that's that. Then of course I went over the whole thing to\nsee where I'd made an ass of myself.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" said Mr. Carter, as Tommy showed signs of taking refuge in\nsilence once more.\n\n\"That business about Mrs. Vandemeyer had worried me when Julius told me\nabout it. On the face of it, it seemed that he or Sir James must have\ndone the trick. But I didn't know which. Finding that photograph in the\ndrawer, after that story of how it had been got from him by Inspector\nBrown, made me suspect Julius. Then I remembered that it was Sir James\nwho had discovered the false Jane Finn. In the end, I couldn't make up\nmy mind--and just decided to take no chances either way. I left a note\nfor Julius, in case he was Mr. Brown, saying I was off to the Argentine,\nand I dropped Sir James's letter with the offer of the job by the desk\nso that he would see it was a genuine stunt. Then I wrote my letter to\nMr. Carter and rang up Sir James. Taking him into my confidence would\nbe the best thing either way, so I told him everything except where I\nbelieved the papers to be hidden. The way he helped me to get on the\ntrack of Tuppence and Annette almost disarmed me, but not quite. I kept\nmy mind open between the two of them. And then I got a bogus note from\nTuppence--and I knew!\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\nTommy took the note in question from his pocket and passed it round the\ntable.\n\n\"It's her handwriting all right, but I knew it wasn't from her because\nof the signature. She'd never spell her name 'Twopence,' but anyone\nwho'd never seen it written might quite easily do so. Julius HAD seen\nit--he showed me a note of hers to him once--but SIR JAMES HADN'T! After\nthat everything was plain sailing. I sent off Albert post-haste to Mr.\nCarter. I pretended to go away, but doubled back again. When Julius came\nbursting up in his car, I felt it wasn't part of Mr. Brown's plan--and\nthat there would probably be trouble. Unless Sir James was actually\ncaught in the act, so to speak, I knew Mr. Carter would never believe it\nof him on my bare word----\"\n\n\"I didn't,\" interposed Mr. Carter ruefully.\n\n\"That's why I sent the girls off to Sir James. I was sure they'd fetch\nup at the house in Soho sooner or later. I threatened Julius with the\nrevolver, because I wanted Tuppence to repeat that to Sir James, so that\nhe wouldn't worry about us. The moment the girls were out of sight I\ntold Julius to drive like hell for London, and as we went along I told\nhim the whole story. We got to the Soho house in plenty of time and met\nMr. Carter outside. After arranging things with him we went in and hid\nbehind the curtain in the recess. The policemen had orders to say, if\nthey were asked, that no one had gone into the house. That's all.\"\n\nAnd Tommy came to an abrupt halt.\n\nThere was silence for a moment.\n\n\"By the way,\" said Julius suddenly, \"you're all wrong about that\nphotograph of Jane. It WAS taken from me, but I found it again.\"\n\n\"Where?\" cried Tuppence.\n\n\"In that little safe on the wall in Mrs. Vandemeyer's bedroom.\"\n\n\"I knew you found something,\" said Tuppence reproachfully. \"To tell you\nthe truth, that's what started me off suspecting you. Why didn't you\nsay?\"\n\n\"I guess I was a mite suspicious too. It had been got away from me once,\nand I determined I wouldn't let on I'd got it until a photographer had\nmade a dozen copies of it!\"\n\n\"We all kept back something or other,\" said Tuppence thoughtfully. \"I\nsuppose secret service work makes you like that!\"\n\nIn the pause that ensued, Mr. Carter took from his pocket a small shabby\nbrown book.\n\n\"Beresford has just said that I would not have believed Sir James Peel\nEdgerton to be guilty unless, so to speak, he was caught in the act.\nThat is so. Indeed, not until I read the entries in this little book\ncould I bring myself fully to credit the amazing truth. This book will\npass into the possession of Scotland Yard, but it will never be publicly\nexhibited. Sir James's long association with the law would make it\nundesirable. But to you, who know the truth, I propose to read certain\npassages which will throw some light on the extraordinary mentality of\nthis great man.\"\n\nHe opened the book, and turned the thin pages.\n\n\n\"... It is madness to keep this book. I know that. It is documentary\nevidence against me. But I have never shrunk from taking risks. And I\nfeel an urgent need for self-expression.... The book will only be taken\nfrom my dead body....\n\n\"... From an early age I realized that I had exceptional abilities. Only\na fool underestimates his capabilities. My brain power was greatly above\nthe average. I know that I was born to succeed. My appearance was\nthe only thing against me. I was quiet and insignificant--utterly\nnondescript....\n\n\"... When I was a boy I heard a famous murder trial. I was deeply\nimpressed by the power and eloquence of the counsel for the defence.\nFor the first time I entertained the idea of taking my talents to that\nparticular market.... Then I studied the criminal in the dock.... The\nman was a fool--he had been incredibly, unbelievably stupid. Even\nthe eloquence of his counsel was hardly likely to save him. I felt\nan immeasurable contempt for him.... Then it occurred to me that the\ncriminal standard was a low one. It was the wastrels, the failures, the\ngeneral riff-raff of civilization who drifted into crime....\nStrange that men of brains had never realized its extraordinary\nopportunities.... I played with the idea.... What a magnificent\nfield--what unlimited possibilities! It made my brain reel....\n\n\"... I read standard works on crime and criminals. They all confirmed my\nopinion. Degeneracy, disease--never the deliberate embracing of a career\nby a far-seeing man. Then I considered. Supposing my utmost ambitions\nwere realized--that I was called to the bar, and rose to the height of\nmy profession? That I entered politics--say, even, that I became Prime\nMinister of England? What then? Was that power? Hampered at every turn\nby my colleagues, fettered by the democratic system of which I should\nbe the mere figurehead! No--the power I dreamed of was absolute! An\nautocrat! A dictator! And such power could only be obtained by working\noutside the law. To play on the weaknesses of human nature, then on the\nweaknesses of nations--to get together and control a vast organization,\nand finally to overthrow the existing order, and rule! The thought\nintoxicated me....\n\n\"... I saw that I must lead two lives. A man like myself is bound to\nattract notice. I must have a successful career which would mask my true\nactivities.... Also I must cultivate a personality. I modelled myself\nupon famous K.C.'s. I reproduced their mannerisms, their magnetism. If I\nhad chosen to be an actor, I should have been the greatest actor living!\nNo disguises--no grease paint--no false beards! Personality! I put it\non like a glove! When I shed it, I was myself, quiet, unobtrusive, a man\nlike every other man. I called myself Mr. Brown. There are hundreds of\nmen called Brown--there are hundreds of men looking just like me....\n\n\"... I succeeded in my false career. I was bound to succeed. I shall\nsucceed in the other. A man like me cannot fail....\n\n\"... I have been reading a life of Napoleon. He and I have much in\ncommon....\n\n\"... I make a practice of defending criminals. A man should look after\nhis own people....\n\n\"... Once or twice I have felt afraid. The first time was in Italy.\nThere was a dinner given. Professor D----, the great alienist, was\npresent. The talk fell on insanity. He said, 'A great many men are\nmad, and no one knows it. They do not know it themselves.' I do not\nunderstand why he looked at me when he said that. His glance was\nstrange.... I did not like it....\n\n\"... The war has disturbed me.... I thought it would further my plans.\nThe Germans are so efficient. Their spy system, too, was excellent.\nThe streets are full of these boys in khaki. All empty-headed young\nfools.... Yet I do not know.... They won the war.... It disturbs me....\n\n\"... My plans are going well.... A girl butted in--I do not think she\nreally knew anything.... But we must give up the Esthonia.... No risks\nnow....\n\n\".... All goes well. The loss of memory is vexing. It cannot be a fake.\nNo girl could deceive ME!...\n\n\"...The 29th.... That is very soon....\" Mr. Carter paused.\n\n\"I will not read the details of the coup that was planned. But there are\njust two small entries that refer to the three of you. In the light of\nwhat happened they are interesting.\n\n\"... By inducing the girl to come to me of her own accord, I have\nsucceeded in disarming her. But she has intuitive flashes that might be\ndangerous.... She must be got out of the way.... I can do nothing with\nthe American. He suspects and dislikes me. But he cannot know. I fancy\nmy armour is impregnable.... Sometimes I fear I have underestimated\nthe other boy. He is not clever, but it is hard to blind his eyes to\nfacts....\"\n\n\nMr. Carter shut the book.\n\n\"A great man,\" he said. \"Genius, or insanity, who can say?\"\n\nThere was silence.\n\nThen Mr. Carter rose to his feet.\n\n\"I will give you a toast. The Joint Venture which has so amply justified\nitself by success!\"\n\nIt was drunk with acclamation.\n\n\"There's something more we want to hear,\" continued Mr. Carter. He\nlooked at the American Ambassador. \"I speak for you also, I know. We'll\nask Miss Jane Finn to tell us the story that only Miss Tuppence has\nheard so far--but before we do so we'll drink her health. The health of\none of the bravest of America's daughters, to whom is due the thanks and\ngratitude of two great countries!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. AND AFTER\n\n\"THAT was a mighty good toast, Jane,\" said Mr. Hersheimmer, as he and\nhis cousin were being driven back in the Rolls-Royce to the Ritz.\n\n\"The one to the joint venture?\"\n\n\"No--the one to you. There isn't another girl in the world who could\nhave carried it through as you did. You were just wonderful!\"\n\nJane shook her head.\n\n\"I don't feel wonderful. At heart I'm just tired and lonesome--and\nlonging for my own country.\"\n\n\"That brings me to something I wanted to say. I heard the Ambassador\ntelling you his wife hoped you would come to them at the Embassy right\naway. That's good enough, but I've got another plan. Jane--I want you to\nmarry me! Don't get scared and say no at once. You can't love me right\naway, of course, that's impossible. But I've loved you from the very\nmoment I set eyes on your photo--and now I've seen you I'm simply crazy\nabout you! If you'll only marry me, I won't worry you any--you shall\ntake your own time. Maybe you'll never come to love me, and if that's\nthe case I'll manage to set you free. But I want the right to look after\nyou, and take care of you.\"\n\n\"That's what I want,\" said the girl wistfully. \"Some one who'll be good\nto me. Oh, you don't know how lonesome I feel!\"\n\n\"Sure thing I do. Then I guess that's all fixed up, and I'll see the\narchbishop about a special license to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"Oh, Julius!\"\n\n\"Well, I don't want to hustle you any, Jane, but there's no sense in\nwaiting about. Don't be scared--I shan't expect you to love me all at\nonce.\"\n\nBut a small hand was slipped into his.\n\n\"I love you now, Julius,\" said Jane Finn. \"I loved you that first moment\nin the car when the bullet grazed your cheek....\"\n\nFive minutes later Jane murmured softly:\n\n\"I don't know London very well, Julius, but is it such a very long way\nfrom the Savoy to the Ritz?\"\n\n\"It depends how you go,\" explained Julius unblushingly. \"We're going by\nway of Regent's Park!\"\n\n\"Oh, Julius--what will the chauffeur think?\"\n\n\"At the wages I pay him, he knows better than to do any independent\nthinking. Why, Jane, the only reason I had the supper at the Savoy was\nso that I could drive you home. I didn't see how I was ever going to\nget hold of you alone. You and Tuppence have been sticking together\nlike Siamese twins. I guess another day of it would have driven me and\nBeresford stark staring mad!\"\n\n\"Oh. Is he----?\"\n\n\"Of course he is. Head over ears.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" said Jane thoughtfully.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"From all the things Tuppence didn't say!\"\n\n\"There you have me beat,\" said Mr. Hersheimmer. But Jane only laughed.\n\nIn the meantime, the Young Adventurers were sitting bolt upright,\nvery stiff and ill at ease, in a taxi which, with a singular lack of\noriginality, was also returning to the Ritz via Regent's Park.\n\nA terrible constraint seemed to have settled down between them. Without\nquite knowing what had happened, everything seemed changed. They were\ntongue-tied--paralysed. All the old camaraderie was gone.\n\nTuppence could think of nothing to say.\n\nTommy was equally afflicted.\n\nThey sat very straight and forbore to look at each other.\n\nAt last Tuppence made a desperate effort.\n\n\"Rather fun, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Rather.\"\n\nAnother silence.\n\n\"I like Julius,\" essayed Tuppence again.\n\nTommy was suddenly galvanized into life.\n\n\"You're not going to marry him, do you hear?\" he said dictatorially. \"I\nforbid it.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Tuppence meekly.\n\n\"Absolutely, you understand.\"\n\n\"He doesn't want to marry me--he really only asked me out of kindness.\"\n\n\"That's not very likely,\" scoffed Tommy.\n\n\"It's quite true. He's head over ears in love with Jane. I expect he's\nproposing to her now.\"\n\n\"She'll do for him very nicely,\" said Tommy condescendingly.\n\n\"Don't you think she's the most lovely creature you've ever seen?\"\n\n\"Oh, I dare say.\"\n\n\"But I suppose you prefer sterling worth,\" said Tuppence demurely.\n\n\"I--oh, dash it all, Tuppence, you know!\"\n\n\"I like your uncle, Tommy,\" said Tuppence, hastily creating a diversion.\n\"By the way, what are you going to do, accept Mr. Carter's offer of\na Government job, or accept Julius's invitation and take a richly\nremunerated post in America on his ranch?\"\n\n\"I shall stick to the old ship, I think, though it's awfully good of\nHersheimmer. But I feel you'd be more at home in London.\"\n\n\"I don't see where I come in.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Tommy positively.\n\nTuppence stole a glance at him sideways.\n\n\"There's the money, too,\" she observed thoughtfully.\n\n\"What money?\"\n\n\"We're going to get a cheque each. Mr. Carter told me so.\"\n\n\"Did you ask how much?\" inquired Tommy sarcastically.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Tuppence triumphantly. \"But I shan't tell you.\"\n\n\"Tuppence, you are the limit!\"\n\n\"It has been fun, hasn't it, Tommy? I do hope we shall have lots more\nadventures.\"\n\n\"You're insatiable, Tuppence. I've had quite enough adventures for the\npresent.\"\n\n\"Well, shopping is almost as good,\" said Tuppence dreamily.\n\"Think of buying old furniture, and bright carpets, and futurist\nsilk curtains, and a polished dining-table, and a divan with lots of\ncushions.\"\n\n\"Hold hard,\" said Tommy. \"What's all this for?\"\n\n\"Possibly a house--but I think a flat.\"\n\n\"Whose flat?\"\n\n\"You think I mind saying it, but I don't in the least! OURS, so there!\"\n\n\"You darling!\" cried Tommy, his arms tightly round her. \"I was\ndetermined to make you say it. I owe you something for the relentless\nway you've squashed me whenever I've tried to be sentimental.\"\n\nTuppence raised her face to his. The taxi proceeded on its course round\nthe north side of Regent's Park.\n\n\"You haven't really proposed now,\" pointed out Tuppence. \"Not what our\ngrandmothers would call a proposal. But after listening to a rotten one\nlike Julius's, I'm inclined to let you off.\"\n\n\"You won't be able to get out of marrying me, so don't you think it.\"\n\n\"What fun it will be,\" responded Tuppence. \"Marriage is called all sorts\nof things, a haven, and a refuge, and a crowning glory, and a state of\nbondage, and lots more.

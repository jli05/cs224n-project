{"summary": "Dumas wrote that the idea of revenge in The Count of Monte Cristo came from a story in a book compiled by Jacques Peuchet, a French police archivist, published in 1838 after the death of the author. Dumas included this essay in one of the editions from 1846. Peuchet told of a shoemaker, Pierre Picaud, living in Nîmes in 1807, who was engaged to marry a rich woman when three jealous friends falsely accused him of being a spy for England. Picaud was placed under a form of house arrest in the Fenestrelle Fort, where he served as a servant to a rich Italian cleric. When the man died, he left his fortune to Picaud, whom he had begun to treat as a son. Picaud then spent years plotting his revenge on the three men who were responsible for his misfortune. He stabbed the first with a dagger on which were printed the words \"Number One\", and then he poisoned the second. The third man's son he lured into crime and his daughter into prostitution, finally stabbing the man himself. This third man, named Loupian, had married Picaud's fiancée while Picaud was under arrest.\nIn another of the \"True Stories\", Peuchet describes a poisoning in a family. This story, also quoted in the Pleiade edition, has obviously served as model for the chapter of the murders inside the Villefort family. The introduction to the Pleiade edition mentions other sources from real life: Abbé Faria existed and died in 1819 after a life with much resemblance to that of the Faria in the novel. As for Dantès, his fate is quite different from his model in Peuchet's book, since the latter is murdered by the \"Caderousse\" of the plot. But Dantès has \"alter egos\" in two other Dumas works; in \"Pauline\" from 1838, and more significantly in \"Georges\" from 1843, where a young man with black ancestry is preparing a revenge against white people who had humiliated him.\n\n", "full_text": "THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO\n\nby Alexandre Dumas, Pere\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1. Marseilles--The Arrival.\n\nOn the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde\nsignalled the three-master, the Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, and\nNaples.\n\nAs usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Chateau d'If,\ngot on board the vessel between Cape Morgion and Rion island.\n\nImmediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean\nwere covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a\nship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has\nbeen built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an\nowner of the city.\n\nThe ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic\nshock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled\nPomegue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but\nso slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is\nthe forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have\nhappened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly\nthat if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself,\nfor she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the\nanchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by\nthe side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow\nentrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and\nvigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each\ndirection of the pilot.\n\nThe vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much\naffected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the\nvessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled\nalongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into La Reserve\nbasin.\n\nWhen the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his\nstation by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship's bulwarks.\n\nHe was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with\nblack eyes, and hair as dark as a raven's wing; and his whole appearance\nbespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from\ntheir cradle to contend with danger.\n\n\"Ah, is it you, Dantes?\" cried the man in the skiff. \"What's the matter?\nand why have you such an air of sadness aboard?\"\n\n\"A great misfortune, M. Morrel,\" replied the young man,--\"a great\nmisfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave\nCaptain Leclere.\"\n\n\"And the cargo?\" inquired the owner, eagerly.\n\n\"Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that head.\nBut poor Captain Leclere--\"\n\n\"What happened to him?\" asked the owner, with an air of considerable\nresignation. \"What happened to the worthy captain?\"\n\n\"He died.\"\n\n\"Fell into the sea?\"\n\n\"No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.\" Then turning to the\ncrew, he said, \"Bear a hand there, to take in sail!\"\n\nAll hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the\ncrew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and\nouthaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail\nclewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his\norders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to the\nowner.\n\n\"And how did this misfortune occur?\" inquired the latter, resuming the\ninterrupted conversation.\n\n\"Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the\nharbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind.\nIn twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days\nafterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his\nrest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six pound shot at his head\nand his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword and\ncross of honor. It was worth while, truly,\" added the young man with a\nmelancholy smile, \"to make war against the English for ten years, and to\ndie in his bed at last, like everybody else.\"\n\n\"Why, you see, Edmond,\" replied the owner, who appeared more comforted\nat every moment, \"we are all mortal, and the old must make way for the\nyoung. If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure me\nthat the cargo--\"\n\n\"Is all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise you\nnot to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.\"\n\nThen, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted:\n\"Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!\"\n\nThe order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a\nman-of-war.\n\n\"Let go--and clue up!\" At this last command all the sails were lowered,\nand the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards.\n\n\"Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,\" said Dantes, observing the\nowner's impatience, \"here is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out of\nhis cabin, who will furnish you with every particular. As for me, I must\nlook after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.\"\n\nThe owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which\nDantes flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to\na sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going\nto his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards\nthe owner. He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of\nunprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to\nhis subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as responsible\nagent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him as\nmuch disliked by the crew as Edmond Dantes was beloved by them.\n\n\"Well, M. Morrel,\" said Danglars, \"you have heard of the misfortune that\nhas befallen us?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.\"\n\n\"And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service,\nas became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as\nthat of Morrel & Son,\" replied Danglars.\n\n\"But,\" replied the owner, glancing after Dantes, who was watching the\nanchoring of his vessel, \"it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so\nold as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend\nEdmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require instruction\nfrom any one.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate. \"Yes,\nhe is young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was the\ncaptain's breath out of his body when he assumed the command without\nconsulting any one, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the\nIsland of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.\"\n\n\"As to taking command of the vessel,\" replied Morrel, \"that was his duty\nas captain's mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba,\nhe was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.\"\n\n\"The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are,\nM. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the\npleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.\"\n\n\"Dantes,\" said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, \"come this\nway!\"\n\n\"In a moment, sir,\" answered Dantes, \"and I'm with you.\" Then calling to\nthe crew, he said--\"Let go!\"\n\nThe anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through the\nport-hole. Dantes continued at his post in spite of the presence of the\npilot, until this manoeuvre was completed, and then he added, \"Half-mast\nthe colors, and square the yards!\"\n\n\"You see,\" said Danglars, \"he fancies himself captain already, upon my\nword.\"\n\n\"And so, in fact, he is,\" said the owner.\n\n\"Except your signature and your partner's, M. Morrel.\"\n\n\"And why should he not have this?\" asked the owner; \"he is young, it is\ntrue, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.\"\n\nA cloud passed over Danglars' brow. \"Your pardon, M. Morrel,\" said\nDantes, approaching, \"the vessel now rides at anchor, and I am at your\nservice. You hailed me, I think?\"\n\nDanglars retreated a step or two. \"I wished to inquire why you stopped\nat the Island of Elba?\"\n\n\"I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain\nLeclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.\"\n\n\"Then did you see him, Edmond?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The marshal.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nMorrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantes on one side, he said\nsuddenly--\"And how is the emperor?\"\n\n\"Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.\"\n\n\"You saw the emperor, then?\"\n\n\"He entered the marshal's apartment while I was there.\"\n\n\"And you spoke to him?\"\n\n\"Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,\" said Dantes, with a smile.\n\n\"And what did he say to you?\"\n\n\"Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the\ncourse she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not\nbeen laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I\ntold him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel &\nSon. 'Ah, yes,' he said, 'I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners\nfrom father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same\nregiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.'\"\n\n\"Pardieu, and that is true!\" cried the owner, greatly delighted. \"And\nthat was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain. Dantes,\nyou must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you will see\nit will bring tears into the old soldier's eyes. Come, come,\" continued\nhe, patting Edmond's shoulder kindly, \"you did very right, Dantes, to\nfollow Captain Leclere's instructions, and touch at Elba, although if\nit were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal, and had\nconversed with the emperor, it might bring you into trouble.\"\n\n\"How could that bring me into trouble, sir?\" asked Dantes; \"for I did\nnot even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor merely made such\ninquiries as he would of the first comer. But, pardon me, here are the\nhealth officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.\" And the\nyoung man went to the gangway. As he departed, Danglars approached, and\nsaid,--\n\n\"Well, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his\nlanding at Porto-Ferrajo?\"\n\n\"Yes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.\"\n\n\"Well, so much the better,\" said the supercargo; \"for it is not pleasant\nto think that a comrade has not done his duty.\"\n\n\"Dantes has done his,\" replied the owner, \"and that is not saying much.\nIt was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.\"\n\n\"Talking of Captain Leclere, has not Dantes given you a letter from\nhim?\"\n\n\"To me?--no--was there one?\"\n\n\"I believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter\nto his care.\"\n\n\"Of what packet are you speaking, Danglars?\"\n\n\"Why, that which Dantes left at Porto-Ferrajo.\"\n\n\"How do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?\"\n\nDanglars turned very red.\n\n\"I was passing close to the door of the captain's cabin, which was half\nopen, and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantes.\"\n\n\"He did not speak to me of it,\" replied the shipowner; \"but if there be\nany letter he will give it to me.\"\n\nDanglars reflected for a moment. \"Then, M. Morrel, I beg of you,\"\nsaid he, \"not to say a word to Dantes on the subject. I may have been\nmistaken.\"\n\nAt this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew.\n\n\"Well, my dear Dantes, are you now free?\" inquired the owner.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You have not been long detained.\"\n\n\"No. I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading; and\nas to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I\ngave them.\"\n\n\"Then you have nothing more to do here?\"\n\n\"No--everything is all right now.\"\n\n\"Then you can come and dine with me?\"\n\n\"I really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel. My first visit is due to\nmy father, though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have done\nme.\"\n\n\"Right, Dantes, quite right. I always knew you were a good son.\"\n\n\"And,\" inquired Dantes, with some hesitation, \"do you know how my father\nis?\"\n\n\"Well, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.\"\n\n\"Yes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.\"\n\n\"That proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your\nabsence.\"\n\nDantes smiled. \"My father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal\nleft, I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from\nHeaven.\"\n\n\"Well, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on\nyou.\"\n\n\"I must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has\nbeen paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.\"\n\n\"True, Dantes, I forgot that there was at the Catalans some one who\nexpects you no less impatiently than your father--the lovely Mercedes.\"\n\nDantes blushed.\n\n\"Ah, ha,\" said the shipowner, \"I am not in the least surprised, for\nshe has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the\nPharaon. Peste, Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!\"\n\n\"She is not my mistress,\" replied the young sailor, gravely; \"she is my\nbetrothed.\"\n\n\"Sometimes one and the same thing,\" said Morrel, with a smile.\n\n\"Not with us, sir,\" replied Dantes.\n\n\"Well, well, my dear Edmond,\" continued the owner, \"don't let me detain\nyou. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all\nthe time you require for your own. Do you want any money?\"\n\n\"No, sir; I have all my pay to take--nearly three months' wages.\"\n\n\"You are a careful fellow, Edmond.\"\n\n\"Say I have a poor father, sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see\nyour father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those who\ndetained him from me after a three months' voyage.\"\n\n\"Then I have your leave, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Captain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?\"\n\n\"He was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask your\nleave of absence for some days.\"\n\n\"To get married?\"\n\n\"Yes, first, and then to go to Paris.\"\n\n\"Very good; have what time you require, Dantes. It will take quite six\nweeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until\nthree months after that; only be back again in three months, for the\nPharaon,\" added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back, \"cannot\nsail without her captain.\"\n\n\"Without her captain!\" cried Dantes, his eyes sparkling with animation;\n\"pray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes\nof my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain of the\nPharaon?\"\n\n\"If I were sole owner we'd shake hands on it now, my dear Dantes,\nand call it settled; but I have a partner, and you know the Italian\nproverb--Chi ha compagno ha padrone--'He who has a partner has a\nmaster.' But the thing is at least half done, as you have one out of two\nvotes. Rely on me to procure you the other; I will do my best.\"\n\n\"Ah, M. Morrel,\" exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his eyes,\nand grasping the owner's hand, \"M. Morrel, I thank you in the name of my\nfather and of Mercedes.\"\n\n\"That's all right, Edmond. There's a providence that watches over the\ndeserving. Go to your father: go and see Mercedes, and afterwards come\nto me.\"\n\n\"Shall I row you ashore?\"\n\n\"No, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with Danglars.\nHave you been satisfied with him this voyage?\"\n\n\"That is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir. Do you\nmean is he a good comrade? No, for I think he never liked me since the\nday when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose\nto him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle\nthe dispute--a proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite\nright to refuse. If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the\nquestion, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you\nwill be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.\"\n\n\"But tell me, Dantes, if you had command of the Pharaon should you be\nglad to see Danglars remain?\"\n\n\"Captain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest respect\nfor those who possess the owners' confidence.\"\n\n\"That's right, that's right, Dantes! I see you are a thoroughly good\nfellow, and will detain you no longer. Go, for I see how impatient you\nare.\"\n\n\"Then I have leave?\"\n\n\"Go, I tell you.\"\n\n\"May I have the use of your skiff?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Then, for the present, M. Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!\"\n\n\"I hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond. Good luck to you.\"\n\nThe young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down in the stern\nsheets, with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebiere. The two\noarsmen bent to their work, and the little boat glided away as rapidly\nas possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the\nnarrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of\nthe harbor to the Quai d'Orleans.\n\nThe shipowner, smiling, followed him with his eyes until he saw him\nspring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng, which\nfrom five o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock at night, swarms\nin the famous street of La Canebiere,--a street of which the modern\nPhocaeans are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world,\nand with that accent which gives so much character to what is said, \"If\nParis had La Canebiere, Paris would be a second Marseilles.\" On turning\nround the owner saw Danglars behind him, apparently awaiting orders,\nbut in reality also watching the young sailor,--but there was a great\ndifference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the\nmovements of Edmond Dantes.\n\n\n\nChapter 2. Father and Son.\n\nWe will leave Danglars struggling with the demon of hatred, and\nendeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil\nsuspicions against his comrade, and follow Dantes, who, after having\ntraversed La Canebiere, took the Rue de Noailles, and entering a small\nhouse, on the left of the Allees de Meillan, rapidly ascended four\nflights of a dark staircase, holding the baluster with one hand, while\nwith the other he repressed the beatings of his heart, and paused before\na half-open door, from which he could see the whole of a small room.\n\nThis room was occupied by Dantes' father. The news of the arrival of the\nPharaon had not yet reached the old man, who, mounted on a chair, was\namusing himself by training with trembling hand the nasturtiums and\nsprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his window.\nSuddenly, he felt an arm thrown around his body, and a well-known voice\nbehind him exclaimed, \"Father--dear father!\"\n\nThe old man uttered a cry, and turned round; then, seeing his son, he\nfell into his arms, pale and trembling.\n\n\"What ails you, my dearest father? Are you ill?\" inquired the young man,\nmuch alarmed.\n\n\"No, no, my dear Edmond--my boy--my son!--no; but I did not expect you;\nand joy, the surprise of seeing you so suddenly--Ah, I feel as if I were\ngoing to die.\"\n\n\"Come, come, cheer up, my dear father! 'Tis I--really I! They say joy\nnever hurts, and so I came to you without any warning. Come now, do\nsmile, instead of looking at me so solemnly. Here I am back again, and\nwe are going to be happy.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, my boy, so we will--so we will,\" replied the old man; \"but\nhow shall we be happy? Shall you never leave me again? Come, tell me all\nthe good fortune that has befallen you.\"\n\n\"God forgive me,\" said the young man, \"for rejoicing at happiness\nderived from the misery of others, but, Heaven knows, I did not seek\nthis good fortune; it has happened, and I really cannot pretend to\nlament it. The good Captain Leclere is dead, father, and it is probable\nthat, with the aid of M. Morrel, I shall have his place. Do you\nunderstand, father? Only imagine me a captain at twenty, with a hundred\nlouis pay, and a share in the profits! Is this not more than a poor\nsailor like me could have hoped for?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear boy,\" replied the old man, \"it is very fortunate.\"\n\n\"Well, then, with the first money I touch, I mean you to have a small\nhouse, with a garden in which to plant clematis, nasturtiums, and\nhoneysuckle. But what ails you, father? Are you not well?\"\n\n\"'Tis nothing, nothing; it will soon pass away\"--and as he said so the\nold man's strength failed him, and he fell backwards.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said the young man, \"a glass of wine, father, will revive\nyou. Where do you keep your wine?\"\n\n\"No, no; thanks. You need not look for it; I do not want it,\" said the\nold man.\n\n\"Yes, yes, father, tell me where it is,\" and he opened two or three\ncupboards.\n\n\"It is no use,\" said the old man, \"there is no wine.\"\n\n\"What, no wine?\" said Dantes, turning pale, and looking alternately\nat the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards. \"What, no\nwine? Have you wanted money, father?\"\n\n\"I want nothing now that I have you,\" said the old man.\n\n\"Yet,\" stammered Dantes, wiping the perspiration from his brow,--\"yet I\ngave you two hundred francs when I left, three months ago.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Edmond, that is true, but you forgot at that time a little\ndebt to our neighbor, Caderousse. He reminded me of it, telling me if\nI did not pay for you, he would be paid by M. Morrel; and so, you see,\nlest he might do you an injury\"--\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why, I paid him.\"\n\n\"But,\" cried Dantes, \"it was a hundred and forty francs I owed\nCaderousse.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" stammered the old man.\n\n\"And you paid him out of the two hundred francs I left you?\"\n\nThe old man nodded.\n\n\"So that you have lived for three months on sixty francs,\" muttered\nEdmond.\n\n\"You know how little I require,\" said the old man.\n\n\"Heaven pardon me,\" cried Edmond, falling on his knees before his\nfather.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"You have wounded me to the heart.\"\n\n\"Never mind it, for I see you once more,\" said the old man; \"and now\nit's all over--everything is all right again.\"\n\n\"Yes, here I am,\" said the young man, \"with a promising future and a\nlittle money. Here, father, here!\" he said, \"take this--take it, and\nsend for something immediately.\" And he emptied his pockets on the\ntable, the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces, five or six\nfive-franc pieces, and some smaller coin. The countenance of old Dantes\nbrightened.\n\n\"Whom does this belong to?\" he inquired.\n\n\"To me, to you, to us! Take it; buy some provisions; be happy, and\nto-morrow we shall have more.\"\n\n\"Gently, gently,\" said the old man, with a smile; \"and by your leave I\nwill use your purse moderately, for they would say, if they saw me buy\ntoo many things at a time, that I had been obliged to await your return,\nin order to be able to purchase them.\"\n\n\"Do as you please; but, first of all, pray have a servant, father. I\nwill not have you left alone so long. I have some smuggled coffee and\nmost capital tobacco, in a small chest in the hold, which you shall have\nto-morrow. But, hush, here comes somebody.\"\n\n\"'Tis Caderousse, who has heard of your arrival, and no doubt comes to\ncongratulate you on your fortunate return.\"\n\n\"Ah, lips that say one thing, while the heart thinks another,\" murmured\nEdmond. \"But, never mind, he is a neighbor who has done us a service on\na time, so he's welcome.\"\n\nAs Edmond paused, the black and bearded head of Caderousse appeared at\nthe door. He was a man of twenty-five or six, and held a piece of cloth,\nwhich, being a tailor, he was about to make into a coat-lining.\n\n\"What, is it you, Edmond, back again?\" said he, with a broad\nMarseillaise accent, and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth.\n\n\"Yes, as you see, neighbor Caderousse; and ready to be agreeable to you\nin any and every way,\" replied Dantes, but ill-concealing his coldness\nunder this cloak of civility.\n\n\"Thanks--thanks; but, fortunately, I do not want for anything; and it\nchances that at times there are others who have need of me.\" Dantes made\na gesture. \"I do not allude to you, my boy. No!--no! I lent you money,\nand you returned it; that's like good neighbors, and we are quits.\"\n\n\"We are never quits with those who oblige us,\" was Dantes' reply; \"for\nwhen we do not owe them money, we owe them gratitude.\"\n\n\"What's the use of mentioning that? What is done is done. Let us talk\nof your happy return, my boy. I had gone on the quay to match a piece of\nmulberry cloth, when I met friend Danglars. 'You at Marseilles?'--'Yes,'\nsays he.\n\n\"'I thought you were at Smyrna.'--'I was; but am now back again.'\n\n\"'And where is the dear boy, our little Edmond?'\n\n\"'Why, with his father, no doubt,' replied Danglars. And so I came,\"\nadded Caderousse, \"as fast as I could to have the pleasure of shaking\nhands with a friend.\"\n\n\"Worthy Caderousse!\" said the old man, \"he is so much attached to us.\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure I am. I love and esteem you, because honest folks are\nso rare. But it seems you have come back rich, my boy,\" continued the\ntailor, looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which Dantes\nhad thrown on the table.\n\nThe young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of\nhis neighbor. \"Eh,\" he said, negligently, \"this money is not mine. I was\nexpressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my\nabsence, and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table. Come,\nfather\" added Dantes, \"put this money back in your box--unless neighbor\nCaderousse wants anything, and in that case it is at his service.\"\n\n\"No, my boy, no,\" said Caderousse. \"I am not in any want, thank God,\nmy living is suited to my means. Keep your money--keep it, I say;--one\nnever has too much;--but, at the same time, my boy, I am as much obliged\nby your offer as if I took advantage of it.\"\n\n\"It was offered with good will,\" said Dantes.\n\n\"No doubt, my boy; no doubt. Well, you stand well with M. Morrel I\nhear,--you insinuating dog, you!\"\n\n\"M. Morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,\" replied Dantes.\n\n\"Then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him.\"\n\n\"What, did you refuse to dine with him?\" said old Dantes; \"and did he\ninvite you to dine?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear father,\" replied Edmond, smiling at his father's\nastonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son.\n\n\"And why did you refuse, my son?\" inquired the old man.\n\n\"That I might the sooner see you again, my dear father,\" replied the\nyoung man. \"I was most anxious to see you.\"\n\n\"But it must have vexed M. Morrel, good, worthy man,\" said Caderousse.\n\"And when you are looking forward to be captain, it was wrong to annoy\nthe owner.\"\n\n\"But I explained to him the cause of my refusal,\" replied Dantes, \"and I\nhope he fully understood it.\"\n\n\"Yes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to one's patrons.\"\n\n\"I hope to be captain without that,\" said Dantes.\n\n\"So much the better--so much the better! Nothing will give greater\npleasure to all your old friends; and I know one down there behind the\nSaint Nicolas citadel who will not be sorry to hear it.\"\n\n\"Mercedes?\" said the old man.\n\n\"Yes, my dear father, and with your permission, now I have seen you, and\nknow you are well and have all you require, I will ask your consent to\ngo and pay a visit to the Catalans.\"\n\n\"Go, my dear boy,\" said old Dantes: \"and heaven bless you in your wife,\nas it has blessed me in my son!\"\n\n\"His wife!\" said Caderousse; \"why, how fast you go on, father Dantes;\nshe is not his wife yet, as it seems to me.\"\n\n\"So, but according to all probability she soon will be,\" replied Edmond.\n\n\"Yes--yes,\" said Caderousse; \"but you were right to return as soon as\npossible, my boy.\"\n\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"Because Mercedes is a very fine girl, and fine girls never lack\nfollowers; she particularly has them by dozens.\"\n\n\"Really?\" answered Edmond, with a smile which had in it traces of slight\nuneasiness.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" continued Caderousse, \"and capital offers, too; but you know,\nyou will be captain, and who could refuse you then?\"\n\n\"Meaning to say,\" replied Dantes, with a smile which but ill-concealed\nhis trouble, \"that if I were not a captain\"--\n\n\"Eh--eh!\" said Caderousse, shaking his head.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said the sailor, \"I have a better opinion than you of\nwomen in general, and of Mercedes in particular; and I am certain that,\ncaptain or not, she will remain ever faithful to me.\"\n\n\"So much the better--so much the better,\" said Caderousse. \"When one\nis going to be married, there is nothing like implicit confidence; but\nnever mind that, my boy,--go and announce your arrival, and let her know\nall your hopes and prospects.\"\n\n\"I will go directly,\" was Edmond's reply; and, embracing his father, and\nnodding to Caderousse, he left the apartment.\n\nCaderousse lingered for a moment, then taking leave of old Dantes, he\nwent downstairs to rejoin Danglars, who awaited him at the corner of the\nRue Senac.\n\n\"Well,\" said Danglars, \"did you see him?\"\n\n\"I have just left him,\" answered Caderousse.\n\n\"Did he allude to his hope of being captain?\"\n\n\"He spoke of it as a thing already decided.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Danglars, \"he is in too much hurry, it appears to me.\"\n\n\"Why, it seems M. Morrel has promised him the thing.\"\n\n\"So that he is quite elated about it?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, he is actually insolent over the matter--has already offered\nme his patronage, as if he were a grand personage, and proffered me a\nloan of money, as though he were a banker.\"\n\n\"Which you refused?\"\n\n\"Most assuredly; although I might easily have accepted it, for it was\nI who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned; but now M.\nDantes has no longer any occasion for assistance--he is about to become\na captain.\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Danglars, \"he is not one yet.\"\n\n\"Ma foi, it will be as well if he is not,\" answered Caderousse; \"for if\nhe should be, there will be really no speaking to him.\"\n\n\"If we choose,\" replied Danglars, \"he will remain what he is; and\nperhaps become even less than he is.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Nothing--I was speaking to myself. And is he still in love with the\nCatalane?\"\n\n\"Over head and ears; but, unless I am much mistaken, there will be a\nstorm in that quarter.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself.\"\n\n\"Why should I?\"\n\n\"It is more important than you think, perhaps. You do not like Dantes?\"\n\n\"I never like upstarts.\"\n\n\"Then tell me all you know about the Catalane.\"\n\n\"I know nothing for certain; only I have seen things which induce me to\nbelieve, as I told you, that the future captain will find some annoyance\nin the vicinity of the Vieilles Infirmeries.\"\n\n\"What have you seen?--come, tell me!\"\n\n\"Well, every time I have seen Mercedes come into the city she has\nbeen accompanied by a tall, strapping, black-eyed Catalan, with a red\ncomplexion, brown skin, and fierce air, whom she calls cousin.\"\n\n\"Really; and you think this cousin pays her attentions?\"\n\n\"I only suppose so. What else can a strapping chap of twenty-one mean\nwith a fine wench of seventeen?\"\n\n\"And you say that Dantes has gone to the Catalans?\"\n\n\"He went before I came down.\"\n\n\"Let us go the same way; we will stop at La Reserve, and we can drink a\nglass of La Malgue, whilst we wait for news.\"\n\n\"Come along,\" said Caderousse; \"but you pay the score.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Danglars; and going quickly to the designated\nplace, they called for a bottle of wine, and two glasses.\n\nPere Pamphile had seen Dantes pass not ten minutes before; and assured\nthat he was at the Catalans, they sat down under the budding foliage\nof the planes and sycamores, in the branches of which the birds were\nsinging their welcome to one of the first days of spring.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. The Catalans.\n\nBeyond a bare, weather-worn wall, about a hundred paces from the spot\nwhere the two friends sat looking and listening as they drank their\nwine, was the village of the Catalans. Long ago this mysterious colony\nquitted Spain, and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this\nday. Whence it came no one knew, and it spoke an unknown tongue. One of\nits chiefs, who understood Provencal, begged the commune of Marseilles\nto give them this bare and barren promontory, where, like the sailors of\nold, they had run their boats ashore. The request was granted; and three\nmonths afterwards, around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which\nhad brought these gypsies of the sea, a small village sprang up. This\nvillage, constructed in a singular and picturesque manner, half Moorish,\nhalf Spanish, still remains, and is inhabited by descendants of the\nfirst comers, who speak the language of their fathers. For three or four\ncenturies they have remained upon this small promontory, on which\nthey had settled like a flight of seabirds, without mixing with the\nMarseillaise population, intermarrying, and preserving their original\ncustoms and the costume of their mother-country as they have preserved\nits language.\n\nOur readers will follow us along the only street of this little village,\nand enter with us one of the houses, which is sunburned to the beautiful\ndead-leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country, and within\ncoated with whitewash, like a Spanish posada. A young and beautiful\ngirl, with hair as black as jet, her eyes as velvety as the gazelle's,\nwas leaning with her back against the wainscot, rubbing in her slender\ndelicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms, the flowers of\nwhich she was picking off and strewing on the floor; her arms, bare to\nthe elbow, brown, and modelled after those of the Arlesian Venus, moved\nwith a kind of restless impatience, and she tapped the earth with her\narched and supple foot, so as to display the pure and full shape of her\nwell-turned leg, in its red cotton, gray and blue clocked, stocking. At\nthree paces from her, seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs,\nleaning his elbow on an old worm-eaten table, was a tall young man of\ntwenty, or two-and-twenty, who was looking at her with an air in which\nvexation and uneasiness were mingled. He questioned her with his eyes,\nbut the firm and steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look.\n\n\"You see, Mercedes,\" said the young man, \"here is Easter come round\nagain; tell me, is this the moment for a wedding?\"\n\n\"I have answered you a hundred times, Fernand, and really you must be\nvery stupid to ask me again.\"\n\n\"Well, repeat it,--repeat it, I beg of you, that I may at last believe\nit! Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love, which had\nyour mother's sanction. Make me understand once for all that you are\ntrifling with my happiness, that my life or death are nothing to you.\nAh, to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband, Mercedes, and\nto lose that hope, which was the only stay of my existence!\"\n\n\"At least it was not I who ever encouraged you in that hope, Fernand,\"\nreplied Mercedes; \"you cannot reproach me with the slightest coquetry.\nI have always said to you, 'I love you as a brother; but do not ask from\nme more than sisterly affection, for my heart is another's.' Is not this\ntrue, Fernand?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is very true, Mercedes,\" replied the young man, \"Yes, you\nhave been cruelly frank with me; but do you forget that it is among the\nCatalans a sacred law to intermarry?\"\n\n\"You mistake, Fernand; it is not a law, but merely a custom, and, I pray\nof you, do not cite this custom in your favor. You are included in the\nconscription, Fernand, and are only at liberty on sufferance, liable at\nany moment to be called upon to take up arms. Once a soldier, what would\nyou do with me, a poor orphan, forlorn, without fortune, with nothing\nbut a half-ruined hut and a few ragged nets, the miserable inheritance\nleft by my father to my mother, and by my mother to me? She has been\ndead a year, and you know, Fernand, I have subsisted almost entirely on\npublic charity. Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you, and that is\nan excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing, and I accept it,\nFernand, because you are the son of my father's brother, because we were\nbrought up together, and still more because it would give you so much\npain if I refuse. But I feel very deeply that this fish which I go and\nsell, and with the produce of which I buy the flax I spin,--I feel very\nkeenly, Fernand, that this is charity.\"\n\n\"And if it were, Mercedes, poor and lone as you are, you suit me as\nwell as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker\nof Marseilles! What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful\nhousekeeper, and where can I look for these better than in you?\"\n\n\"Fernand,\" answered Mercedes, shaking her head, \"a woman becomes a bad\nmanager, and who shall say she will remain an honest woman, when\nshe loves another man better than her husband? Rest content with my\nfriendship, for I say once more that is all I can promise, and I will\npromise no more than I can bestow.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" replied Fernand, \"you can endure your own wretchedness\npatiently, but you are afraid to share mine. Well, Mercedes, beloved by\nyou, I would tempt fortune; you would bring me good luck, and I should\nbecome rich. I could extend my occupation as a fisherman, might get a\nplace as clerk in a warehouse, and become in time a dealer myself.\"\n\n\"You could do no such thing, Fernand; you are a soldier, and if you\nremain at the Catalans it is because there is no war; so remain a\nfisherman, and contented with my friendship, as I cannot give you more.\"\n\n\"Well, I will do better, Mercedes. I will be a sailor; instead of the\ncostume of our fathers, which you despise, I will wear a varnished hat,\na striped shirt, and a blue jacket, with an anchor on the buttons. Would\nnot that dress please you?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mercedes, with an angry glance,--\"what do you\nmean? I do not understand you?\"\n\n\"I mean, Mercedes, that you are thus harsh and cruel with me, because\nyou are expecting some one who is thus attired; but perhaps he whom you\nawait is inconstant, or if he is not, the sea is so to him.\"\n\n\"Fernand,\" cried Mercedes, \"I believed you were good-hearted, and I was\nmistaken! Fernand, you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the\nanger of God! Yes, I will not deny it, I do await, and I do love him of\nwhom you speak; and, if he does not return, instead of accusing him of\nthe inconstancy which you insinuate, I will tell you that he died loving\nme and me only.\" The young girl made a gesture of rage. \"I understand\nyou, Fernand; you would be revenged on him because I do not love you;\nyou would cross your Catalan knife with his dirk. What end would that\nanswer? To lose you my friendship if he were conquered, and see that\nfriendship changed into hate if you were victor. Believe me, to seek a\nquarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the woman who loves that\nman. No, Fernand, you will not thus give way to evil thoughts. Unable to\nhave me for your wife, you will content yourself with having me for\nyour friend and sister; and besides,\" she added, her eyes troubled and\nmoistened with tears, \"wait, wait, Fernand; you said just now that the\nsea was treacherous, and he has been gone four months, and during these\nfour months there have been some terrible storms.\"\n\nFernand made no reply, nor did he attempt to check the tears which\nflowed down the cheeks of Mercedes, although for each of these tears he\nwould have shed his heart's blood; but these tears flowed for another.\nHe arose, paced a while up and down the hut, and then, suddenly stopping\nbefore Mercedes, with his eyes glowing and his hands clinched,--\"Say,\nMercedes,\" he said, \"once for all, is this your final determination?\"\n\n\"I love Edmond Dantes,\" the young girl calmly replied, \"and none but\nEdmond shall ever be my husband.\"\n\n\"And you will always love him?\"\n\n\"As long as I live.\"\n\nFernand let fall his head like a defeated man, heaved a sigh that was\nlike a groan, and then suddenly looking her full in the face, with\nclinched teeth and expanded nostrils, said,--\"But if he is dead\"--\n\n\"If he is dead, I shall die too.\"\n\n\"If he has forgotten you\"--\n\n\"Mercedes!\" called a joyous voice from without,--\"Mercedes!\"\n\n\"Ah,\" exclaimed the young girl, blushing with delight, and fairly\nleaping in excess of love, \"you see he has not forgotten me, for here he\nis!\" And rushing towards the door, she opened it, saying, \"Here, Edmond,\nhere I am!\"\n\nFernand, pale and trembling, drew back, like a traveller at the sight\nof a serpent, and fell into a chair beside him. Edmond and Mercedes were\nclasped in each other's arms. The burning Marseilles sun, which shot\ninto the room through the open door, covered them with a flood of light.\nAt first they saw nothing around them. Their intense happiness isolated\nthem from all the rest of the world, and they only spoke in broken\nwords, which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather\nthe expression of sorrow. Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy, pale, and\nthreatening countenance of Fernand, as it was defined in the shadow.\nBy a movement for which he could scarcely account to himself, the young\nCatalan placed his hand on the knife at his belt.\n\n\"Ah, your pardon,\" said Dantes, frowning in his turn; \"I did not\nperceive that there were three of us.\" Then, turning to Mercedes, he\ninquired, \"Who is this gentleman?\"\n\n\"One who will be your best friend, Dantes, for he is my friend, my\ncousin, my brother; it is Fernand--the man whom, after you, Edmond, I\nlove the best in the world. Do you not remember him?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" said Dantes, and without relinquishing Mercedes hand clasped in\none of his own, he extended the other to the Catalan with a cordial air.\nBut Fernand, instead of responding to this amiable gesture, remained\nmute and trembling. Edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at the\nagitated and embarrassed Mercedes, and then again on the gloomy and\nmenacing Fernand. This look told him all, and his anger waxed hot.\n\n\"I did not know, when I came with such haste to you, that I was to meet\nan enemy here.\"\n\n\"An enemy!\" cried Mercedes, with an angry look at her cousin. \"An enemy\nin my house, do you say, Edmond! If I believed that, I would place my\narm under yours and go with you to Marseilles, leaving the house to\nreturn to it no more.\"\n\nFernand's eye darted lightning. \"And should any misfortune occur to\nyou, dear Edmond,\" she continued with the same calmness which proved to\nFernand that the young girl had read the very innermost depths of his\nsinister thought, \"if misfortune should occur to you, I would ascend the\nhighest point of the Cape de Morgion and cast myself headlong from it.\"\n\nFernand became deadly pale. \"But you are deceived, Edmond,\" she\ncontinued. \"You have no enemy here--there is no one but Fernand, my\nbrother, who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend.\"\n\nAnd at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the\nCatalan, who, as if fascinated by it, came slowly towards Edmond, and\noffered him his hand. His hatred, like a powerless though furious wave,\nwas broken against the strong ascendancy which Mercedes exercised over\nhim. Scarcely, however, had he touched Edmond's hand than he felt he had\ndone all he could do, and rushed hastily out of the house.\n\n\"Oh,\" he exclaimed, running furiously and tearing his hair--\"Oh, who\nwill deliver me from this man? Wretched--wretched that I am!\"\n\n\"Hallo, Catalan! Hallo, Fernand! where are you running to?\" exclaimed a\nvoice.\n\nThe young man stopped suddenly, looked around him, and perceived\nCaderousse sitting at table with Danglars, under an arbor.\n\n\"Well\", said Caderousse, \"why don't you come? Are you really in such a\nhurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends?\"\n\n\"Particularly when they have still a full bottle before them,\" added\nDanglars. Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air, but did not\nsay a word.\n\n\"He seems besotted,\" said Danglars, pushing Caderousse with his knee.\n\"Are we mistaken, and is Dantes triumphant in spite of all we have\nbelieved?\"\n\n\"Why, we must inquire into that,\" was Caderousse's reply; and turning\ntowards the young man, said, \"Well, Catalan, can't you make up your\nmind?\"\n\nFernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow, and slowly\nentered the arbor, whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to\nhis senses, and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted\nbody.\n\n\"Good-day,\" said he. \"You called me, didn't you?\" And he fell, rather\nthan sat down, on one of the seats which surrounded the table.\n\n\"I called you because you were running like a madman, and I was afraid\nyou would throw yourself into the sea,\" said Caderousse, laughing. \"Why,\nwhen a man has friends, they are not only to offer him a glass of wine,\nbut, moreover, to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water\nunnecessarily!\"\n\nFernand gave a groan, which resembled a sob, and dropped his head into\nhis hands, his elbows leaning on the table.\n\n\"Well, Fernand, I must say,\" said Caderousse, beginning the\nconversation, with that brutality of the common people in which\ncuriosity destroys all diplomacy, \"you look uncommonly like a rejected\nlover;\" and he burst into a hoarse laugh.\n\n\"Bah!\" said Danglars, \"a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in\nlove. You are laughing at him, Caderousse.\"\n\n\"No,\" he replied, \"only hark how he sighs! Come, come, Fernand,\" said\nCaderousse, \"hold up your head, and answer us. It's not polite not to\nreply to friends who ask news of your health.\"\n\n\"My health is well enough,\" said Fernand, clinching his hands without\nraising his head.\n\n\"Ah, you see, Danglars,\" said Caderousse, winking at his friend, \"this\nis how it is; Fernand, whom you see here, is a good and brave Catalan,\none of the best fishermen in Marseilles, and he is in love with a very\nfine girl, named Mercedes; but it appears, unfortunately, that the fine\ngirl is in love with the mate of the Pharaon; and as the Pharaon arrived\nto-day--why, you understand!\"\n\n\"No; I do not understand,\" said Danglars.\n\n\"Poor Fernand has been dismissed,\" continued Caderousse.\n\n\"Well, and what then?\" said Fernand, lifting up his head, and looking at\nCaderousse like a man who looks for some one on whom to vent his anger;\n\"Mercedes is not accountable to any person, is she? Is she not free to\nlove whomsoever she will?\"\n\n\"Oh, if you take it in that sense,\" said Caderousse, \"it is another\nthing. But I thought you were a Catalan, and they told me the Catalans\nwere not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival. It was\neven told me that Fernand, especially, was terrible in his vengeance.\"\n\nFernand smiled piteously. \"A lover is never terrible,\" he said.\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" remarked Danglars, affecting to pity the young man from\nthe bottom of his heart. \"Why, you see, he did not expect to see Dantes\nreturn so suddenly--he thought he was dead, perhaps; or perchance\nfaithless! These things always come on us more severely when they come\nsuddenly.\"\n\n\"Ah, ma foi, under any circumstances,\" said Caderousse, who drank as he\nspoke, and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect,--\"under\nany circumstances Fernand is not the only person put out by the\nfortunate arrival of Dantes; is he, Danglars?\"\n\n\"No, you are right--and I should say that would bring him ill-luck.\"\n\n\"Well, never mind,\" answered Caderousse, pouring out a glass of wine\nfor Fernand, and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time, while\nDanglars had merely sipped his. \"Never mind--in the meantime he marries\nMercedes--the lovely Mercedes--at least he returns to do that.\"\n\nDuring this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man, on\nwhose heart Caderousse's words fell like molten lead.\n\n\"And when is the wedding to be?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, it is not yet fixed!\" murmured Fernand.\n\n\"No, but it will be,\" said Caderousse, \"as surely as Dantes will be\ncaptain of the Pharaon--eh, Danglars?\"\n\nDanglars shuddered at this unexpected attack, and turned to Caderousse,\nwhose countenance he scrutinized, to try and detect whether the blow\nwas premeditated; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already\nrendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, filling the glasses, \"let us drink to Captain Edmond\nDantes, husband of the beautiful Catalane!\"\n\nCaderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand, and\nswallowed the contents at a gulp. Fernand dashed his on the ground.\n\n\"Eh, eh, eh!\" stammered Caderousse. \"What do I see down there by the\nwall, in the direction of the Catalans? Look, Fernand, your eyes are\nbetter than mine. I believe I see double. You know wine is a deceiver;\nbut I should say it was two lovers walking side by side, and hand in\nhand. Heaven forgive me, they do not know that we can see them, and they\nare actually embracing!\"\n\nDanglars did not lose one pang that Fernand endured.\n\n\"Do you know them, Fernand?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the reply, in a low voice. \"It is Edmond and Mercedes!\"\n\n\"Ah, see there, now!\" said Caderousse; \"and I did not recognize them!\nHallo, Dantes! hello, lovely damsel! Come this way, and let us know when\nthe wedding is to be, for Fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell\nus.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, will you?\" said Danglars, pretending to restrain\nCaderousse, who, with the tenacity of drunkards, leaned out of the\narbor. \"Try to stand upright, and let the lovers make love without\ninterruption. See, look at Fernand, and follow his example; he is\nwell-behaved!\"\n\nFernand, probably excited beyond bearing, pricked by Danglars, as the\nbull is by the bandilleros, was about to rush out; for he had risen from\nhis seat, and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his\nrival, when Mercedes, smiling and graceful, lifted up her lovely head,\nand looked at them with her clear and bright eyes. At this Fernand\nrecollected her threat of dying if Edmond died, and dropped again\nheavily on his seat. Danglars looked at the two men, one after the\nother, the one brutalized by liquor, the other overwhelmed with love.\n\n\"I shall get nothing from these fools,\" he muttered; \"and I am very much\nafraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward. Here's an envious\nfellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his\nwrath, and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from under\nhis nose and takes on like a big baby. Yet this Catalan has eyes that\nglisten like those of the vengeful Spaniards, Sicilians, and Calabrians,\nand the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow.\nUnquestionably, Edmond's star is in the ascendant, and he will marry the\nsplendid girl--he will be captain, too, and laugh at us all, unless\"--a\nsinister smile passed over Danglars' lips--\"unless I take a hand in the\naffair,\" he added.\n\n\"Hallo!\" continued Caderousse, half-rising, and with his fist on the\ntable, \"hallo, Edmond! do you not see your friends, or are you too proud\nto speak to them?\"\n\n\"No, my dear fellow!\" replied Dantes, \"I am not proud, but I am happy,\nand happiness blinds, I think, more than pride.\"\n\n\"Ah, very well, that's an explanation!\" said Caderousse. \"How do you do,\nMadame Dantes?\"\n\nMercedes courtesied gravely, and said--\"That is not my name, and in my\ncountry it bodes ill fortune, they say, to call a young girl by the name\nof her betrothed before he becomes her husband. So call me Mercedes, if\nyou please.\"\n\n\"We must excuse our worthy neighbor, Caderousse,\" said Dantes, \"he is so\neasily mistaken.\"\n\n\"So, then, the wedding is to take place immediately, M. Dantes,\" said\nDanglars, bowing to the young couple.\n\n\"As soon as possible, M. Danglars; to-day all preliminaries will be\narranged at my father's, and to-morrow, or next day at latest, the\nwedding festival here at La Reserve. My friends will be there, I hope;\nthat is to say, you are invited, M. Danglars, and you, Caderousse.\"\n\n\"And Fernand,\" said Caderousse with a chuckle; \"Fernand, too, is\ninvited!\"\n\n\"My wife's brother is my brother,\" said Edmond; \"and we, Mercedes and I,\nshould be very sorry if he were absent at such a time.\"\n\nFernand opened his mouth to reply, but his voice died on his lips, and\nhe could not utter a word.\n\n\"To-day the preliminaries, to-morrow or next day the ceremony! You are\nin a hurry, captain!\"\n\n\"Danglars,\" said Edmond, smiling, \"I will say to you as Mercedes said\njust now to Caderousse, 'Do not give me a title which does not belong to\nme'; that may bring me bad luck.\"\n\n\"Your pardon,\" replied Danglars, \"I merely said you seemed in a hurry,\nand we have lots of time; the Pharaon cannot be under weigh again in\nless than three months.\"\n\n\"We are always in a hurry to be happy, M. Danglars; for when we have\nsuffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in good\nfortune. But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste; I\nmust go to Paris.\"\n\n\"Ah, really?--to Paris! and will it be the first time you have ever been\nthere, Dantes?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have you business there?\"\n\n\"Not of my own; the last commission of poor Captain Leclere; you know\nto what I allude, Danglars--it is sacred. Besides, I shall only take the\ntime to go and return.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I understand,\" said Danglars, and then in a low tone, he\nadded, \"To Paris, no doubt to deliver the letter which the grand marshal\ngave him. Ah, this letter gives me an idea--a capital idea! Ah; Dantes,\nmy friend, you are not yet registered number one on board the good ship\nPharaon;\" then turning towards Edmond, who was walking away, \"A pleasant\njourney,\" he cried.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Edmond with a friendly nod, and the two lovers\ncontinued on their way, as calm and joyous as if they were the very\nelect of heaven.\n\n\n\nChapter 4. Conspiracy.\n\nDanglars followed Edmond and Mercedes with his eyes until the two lovers\ndisappeared behind one of the angles of Fort Saint Nicolas, then turning\nround, he perceived Fernand, who had fallen, pale and trembling, into\nhis chair, while Caderousse stammered out the words of a drinking-song.\n\n\"Well, my dear sir,\" said Danglars to Fernand, \"here is a marriage which\ndoes not appear to make everybody happy.\"\n\n\"It drives me to despair,\" said Fernand.\n\n\"Do you, then, love Mercedes?\"\n\n\"I adore her!\"\n\n\"For long?\"\n\n\"As long as I have known her--always.\"\n\n\"And you sit there, tearing your hair, instead of seeking to remedy your\ncondition; I did not think that was the way of your people.\"\n\n\"What would you have me do?\" said Fernand.\n\n\"How do I know? Is it my affair? I am not in love with Mademoiselle\nMercedes; but for you--in the words of the gospel, seek, and you shall\nfind.\"\n\n\"I have found already.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I would stab the man, but the woman told me that if any misfortune\nhappened to her betrothed, she would kill herself.\"\n\n\"Pooh! Women say those things, but never do them.\"\n\n\"You do not know Mercedes; what she threatens she will do.\"\n\n\"Idiot!\" muttered Danglars; \"whether she kill herself or not, what\nmatter, provided Dantes is not captain?\"\n\n\"Before Mercedes should die,\" replied Fernand, with the accents of\nunshaken resolution, \"I would die myself!\"\n\n\"That's what I call love!\" said Caderousse with a voice more tipsy than\never. \"That's love, or I don't know what love is.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Danglars, \"you appear to me a good sort of fellow, and hang\nme, I should like to help you, but\"--\n\n\"Yes,\" said Caderousse, \"but how?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" replied Danglars, \"you are three parts drunk; finish\nthe bottle, and you will be completely so. Drink then, and do not meddle\nwith what we are discussing, for that requires all one's wit and cool\njudgment.\"\n\n\"I--drunk!\" said Caderousse; \"well that's a good one! I could drink\nfour more such bottles; they are no bigger than cologne flasks. Pere\nPamphile, more wine!\" and Caderousse rattled his glass upon the table.\n\n\"You were saying, sir\"--said Fernand, awaiting with great anxiety the\nend of this interrupted remark.\n\n\"What was I saying? I forget. This drunken Caderousse has made me lose\nthe thread of my sentence.\"\n\n\"Drunk, if you like; so much the worse for those who fear wine, for it\nis because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will\nextract from their hearts;\" and Caderousse began to sing the two last\nlines of a song very popular at the time,--\n\n'Tous les mechants sont beuveurs d'eau; C'est bien prouve par le\ndeluge.' [*]\n\n     * \"The wicked are great drinkers of water; As the flood\n     proved once for all.\"\n\n\"You said, sir, you would like to help me, but\"--\n\n\"Yes; but I added, to help you it would be sufficient that Dantes\ndid not marry her you love; and the marriage may easily be thwarted,\nmethinks, and yet Dantes need not die.\"\n\n\"Death alone can separate them,\" remarked Fernand.\n\n\"You talk like a noodle, my friend,\" said Caderousse; \"and here is\nDanglars, who is a wide-awake, clever, deep fellow, who will prove to\nyou that you are wrong. Prove it, Danglars. I have answered for you. Say\nthere is no need why Dantes should die; it would, indeed, be a pity he\nshould. Dantes is a good fellow; I like Dantes. Dantes, your health.\"\n\nFernand rose impatiently. \"Let him run on,\" said Danglars, restraining\nthe young man; \"drunk as he is, he is not much out in what he says.\nAbsence severs as well as death, and if the walls of a prison were\nbetween Edmond and Mercedes they would be as effectually separated as if\nhe lay under a tombstone.\"\n\n\"Yes; but one gets out of prison,\" said Caderousse, who, with what sense\nwas left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, \"and when one gets\nout and one's name is Edmond Dantes, one seeks revenge\"--\n\n\"What matters that?\" muttered Fernand.\n\n\"And why, I should like to know,\" persisted Caderousse, \"should they put\nDantes in prison? he has not robbed or killed or murdered.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\" said Danglars.\n\n\"I won't hold my tongue!\" replied Caderousse; \"I say I want to know why\nthey should put Dantes in prison; I like Dantes; Dantes, your health!\"\nand he swallowed another glass of wine.\n\nDanglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his\nintoxication, and turning towards Fernand, said, \"Well, you understand\nthere is no need to kill him.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, if, as you said just now, you have the means of having\nDantes arrested. Have you that means?\"\n\n\"It is to be found for the searching. But why should I meddle in the\nmatter? it is no affair of mine.\"\n\n\"I know not why you meddle,\" said Fernand, seizing his arm; \"but this I\nknow, you have some motive of personal hatred against Dantes, for he who\nhimself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of others.\"\n\n\"I!--motives of hatred against Dantes? None, on my word! I saw you were\nunhappy, and your unhappiness interested me; that's all; but since you\nbelieve I act for my own account, adieu, my dear friend, get out of the\naffair as best you may;\" and Danglars rose as if he meant to depart.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Fernand, restraining him, \"stay! It is of very little\nconsequence to me at the end of the matter whether you have any angry\nfeeling or not against Dantes. I hate him! I confess it openly. Do you\nfind the means, I will execute it, provided it is not to kill the man,\nfor Mercedes has declared she will kill herself if Dantes is killed.\"\n\nCaderousse, who had let his head drop on the table, now raised it, and\nlooking at Fernand with his dull and fishy eyes, he said,--\"Kill Dantes!\nwho talks of killing Dantes? I won't have him killed--I won't! He's my\nfriend, and this morning offered to share his money with me, as I shared\nmine with him. I won't have Dantes killed--I won't!\"\n\n\"And who has said a word about killing him, muddlehead?\" replied\nDanglars. \"We were merely joking; drink to his health,\" he added,\nfilling Caderousse's glass, \"and do not interfere with us.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Dantes' good health!\" said Caderousse, emptying his glass,\n\"here's to his health! his health--hurrah!\"\n\n\"But the means--the means?\" said Fernand.\n\n\"Have you not hit upon any?\" asked Danglars.\n\n\"No!--you undertook to do so.\"\n\n\"True,\" replied Danglars; \"the French have the superiority over the\nSpaniards, that the Spaniards ruminate, while the French invent.\"\n\n\"Do you invent, then,\" said Fernand impatiently.\n\n\"Waiter,\" said Danglars, \"pen, ink, and paper.\"\n\n\"Pen, ink, and paper,\" muttered Fernand.\n\n\"Yes; I am a supercargo; pen, ink, and paper are my tools, and without\nmy tools I am fit for nothing.\"\n\n\"Pen, ink, and paper, then,\" called Fernand loudly.\n\n\"There's what you want on that table,\" said the waiter.\n\n\"Bring them here.\" The waiter did as he was desired.\n\n\"When one thinks,\" said Caderousse, letting his hand drop on the paper,\n\"there is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at\nthe corner of a wood to assassinate him! I have always had more dread\nof a pen, a bottle of ink, and a sheet of paper, than of a sword or\npistol.\"\n\n\"The fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be,\" said Danglars. \"Give\nhim some more wine, Fernand.\" Fernand filled Caderousse's glass, who,\nlike the confirmed toper he was, lifted his hand from the paper and\nseized the glass.\n\nThe Catalan watched him until Caderousse, almost overcome by this fresh\nassault on his senses, rested, or rather dropped, his glass upon the\ntable.\n\n\"Well!\" resumed the Catalan, as he saw the final glimmer of Caderousse's\nreason vanishing before the last glass of wine.\n\n\"Well, then, I should say, for instance,\" resumed Danglars, \"that if\nafter a voyage such as Dantes has just made, in which he touched at the\nIsland of Elba, some one were to denounce him to the king's procureur as\na Bonapartist agent\"--\n\n\"I will denounce him!\" exclaimed the young man hastily.\n\n\"Yes, but they will make you then sign your declaration, and confront\nyou with him you have denounced; I will supply you with the means of\nsupporting your accusation, for I know the fact well. But Dantes cannot\nremain forever in prison, and one day or other he will leave it, and\nthe day when he comes out, woe betide him who was the cause of his\nincarceration!\"\n\n\"Oh, I should wish nothing better than that he would come and seek a\nquarrel with me.\"\n\n\"Yes, and Mercedes! Mercedes, who will detest you if you have only the\nmisfortune to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved Edmond!\"\n\n\"True!\" said Fernand.\n\n\"No, no,\" continued Danglars; \"if we resolve on such a step, it would\nbe much better to take, as I now do, this pen, dip it into this ink, and\nwrite with the left hand (that the writing may not be recognized) the\ndenunciation we propose.\" And Danglars, uniting practice with theory,\nwrote with his left hand, and in a writing reversed from his usual\nstyle, and totally unlike it, the following lines, which he handed to\nFernand, and which Fernand read in an undertone:--\n\n\"The honorable, the king's attorney, is informed by a friend of the\nthrone and religion, that one Edmond Dantes, mate of the ship Pharaon,\narrived this morning from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples\nand Porto-Ferrajo, has been intrusted by Murat with a letter for the\nusurper, and by the usurper with a letter for the Bonapartist committee\nin Paris. Proof of this crime will be found on arresting him, for the\nletter will be found upon him, or at his father's, or in his cabin on\nboard the Pharaon.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" resumed Danglars; \"now your revenge looks like\ncommon-sense, for in no way can it revert to yourself, and the matter\nwill thus work its own way; there is nothing to do now but fold the\nletter as I am doing, and write upon it, 'To the king's attorney,' and\nthat's all settled.\" And Danglars wrote the address as he spoke.\n\n\"Yes, and that's all settled!\" exclaimed Caderousse, who, by a last\neffort of intellect, had followed the reading of the letter, and\ninstinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation\nmust entail. \"Yes, and that's all settled; only it will be an infamous\nshame;\" and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Danglars, taking it from beyond his reach; \"and as what I\nsay and do is merely in jest, and I, amongst the first and foremost,\nshould be sorry if anything happened to Dantes--the worthy Dantes--look\nhere!\" And taking the letter, he squeezed it up in his hands and threw\nit into a corner of the arbor.\n\n\"All right!\" said Caderousse. \"Dantes is my friend, and I won't have him\nill-used.\"\n\n\"And who thinks of using him ill? Certainly neither I nor Fernand,\"\nsaid Danglars, rising and looking at the young man, who still remained\nseated, but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung\ninto the corner.\n\n\"In this case,\" replied Caderousse, \"let's have some more wine. I wish\nto drink to the health of Edmond and the lovely Mercedes.\"\n\n\"You have had too much already, drunkard,\" said Danglars; \"and if you\ncontinue, you will be compelled to sleep here, because unable to stand\non your legs.\"\n\n\"I?\" said Caderousse, rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken\nman, \"I can't keep on my legs? Why, I'll wager I can go up into the\nbelfry of the Accoules, and without staggering, too!\"\n\n\"Done!\" said Danglars, \"I'll take your bet; but to-morrow--to-day it is\ntime to return. Give me your arm, and let us go.\"\n\n\"Very well, let us go,\" said Caderousse; \"but I don't want your arm at\nall. Come, Fernand, won't you return to Marseilles with us?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Fernand; \"I shall return to the Catalans.\"\n\n\"You're wrong. Come with us to Marseilles--come along.\"\n\n\"I will not.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? you will not? Well, just as you like, my prince;\nthere's liberty for all the world. Come along, Danglars, and let the\nyoung gentleman return to the Catalans if he chooses.\"\n\nDanglars took advantage of Caderousse's temper at the moment, to take\nhim off towards Marseilles by the Porte Saint-Victor, staggering as he\nwent.\n\nWhen they had advanced about twenty yards, Danglars looked back and\nsaw Fernand stoop, pick up the crumpled paper, and putting it into his\npocket then rush out of the arbor towards Pillon.\n\n\"Well,\" said Caderousse, \"why, what a lie he told! He said he was going\nto the Catalans, and he is going to the city. Hallo, Fernand!\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't see straight,\" said Danglars; \"he's gone right enough.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Caderousse, \"I should have said not--how treacherous wine\nis!\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" said Danglars to himself, \"now the thing is at work and it\nwill effect its purpose unassisted.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 5. The Marriage-Feast.\n\nThe morning's sun rose clear and resplendent, touching the foamy waves\ninto a network of ruby-tinted light.\n\nThe feast had been made ready on the second floor at La Reserve, with\nwhose arbor the reader is already familiar. The apartment destined for\nthe purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows, over each\nof which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the\nname of one of the principal cities of France; beneath these windows a\nwooden balcony extended the entire length of the house. And although\nthe entertainment was fixed for twelve o'clock, an hour previous to\nthat time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests,\nconsisting of the favored part of the crew of the Pharaon, and other\npersonal friends of the bride-groom, the whole of whom had arrayed\nthemselves in their choicest costumes, in order to do greater honor to\nthe occasion.\n\nVarious rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the Pharaon\nhad promised to attend the nuptial feast; but all seemed unanimous in\ndoubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could\npossibly be intended.\n\nDanglars, however, who now made his appearance, accompanied by\nCaderousse, effectually confirmed the report, stating that he had\nrecently conversed with M. Morrel, who had himself assured him of his\nintention to dine at La Reserve.\n\nIn fact, a moment later M. Morrel appeared and was saluted with an\nenthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the Pharaon, who hailed\nthe visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose\nwedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in\ncommand of the ship; and as Dantes was universally beloved on board his\nvessel, the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding\nthat the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with\ntheir own.\n\nWith the entrance of M. Morrel, Danglars and Caderousse were despatched\nin search of the bride-groom to convey to him the intelligence of the\narrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a\nlively sensation, and to beseech him to make haste.\n\nDanglars and Caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed; but ere\nthey had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them,\ncomposed of the betrothed pair, a party of young girls in attendance on\nthe bride, by whose side walked Dantes' father; the whole brought up by\nFernand, whose lips wore their usual sinister smile.\n\nNeither Mercedes nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his\ncountenance; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the\nsunshine and the presence of each other.\n\nHaving acquitted themselves of their errand, and exchanged a hearty\nshake of the hand with Edmond, Danglars and Caderousse took their places\nbeside Fernand and old Dantes,--the latter of whom attracted universal\nnotice. The old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk,\ntrimmed with steel buttons, beautifully cut and polished. His thin\nbut wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked\nstockings, evidently of English manufacture, while from his\nthree-cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue\nribbons. Thus he came along, supporting himself on a curiously carved\nstick, his aged countenance lit up with happiness, looking for all the\nworld like one of the aged dandies of 1796, parading the newly opened\ngardens of the Tuileries and Luxembourg. Beside him glided Caderousse,\nwhose desire to partake of the good things provided for the\nwedding-party had induced him to become reconciled to the Dantes, father\nand son, although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect\nrecollection of the events of the preceding night; just as the brain\nretains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream.\n\nAs Danglars approached the disappointed lover, he cast on him a look of\ndeep meaning, while Fernand, as he slowly paced behind the happy pair,\nwho seemed, in their own unmixed content, to have entirely forgotten\nthat such a being as himself existed, was pale and abstracted;\noccasionally, however, a deep flush would overspread his countenance,\nand a nervous contraction distort his features, while, with an agitated\nand restless gaze, he would glance in the direction of Marseilles, like\none who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event.\n\nDantes himself was simply, but becomingly, clad in the dress peculiar to\nthe merchant service--a costume somewhat between a military and a civil\ngarb; and with his fine countenance, radiant with joy and happiness, a\nmore perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined.\n\nLovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios, Mercedes boasted the same\nbright flashing eyes of jet, and ripe, round, coral lips. She moved\nwith the light, free step of an Arlesienne or an Andalusian. One more\npracticed in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath\na veil, or, at least, have cast down her thickly fringed lashes, so as\nto have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes; but, on the\ncontrary, the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed\nto say: \"If you are my friends, rejoice with me, for I am very happy.\"\n\nAs soon as the bridal party came in sight of La Reserve, M. Morrel\ndescended and came forth to meet it, followed by the soldiers and\nsailors there assembled, to whom he had repeated the promise already\ngiven, that Dantes should be the successor to the late Captain Leclere.\nEdmond, at the approach of his patron, respectfully placed the arm of\nhis affianced bride within that of M. Morrel, who, forthwith conducting\nher up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the\nfeast was prepared, was gayly followed by the guests, beneath whose\nheavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of\nseveral minutes.\n\n\"Father,\" said Mercedes, stopping when she had reached the centre of the\ntable, \"sit, I pray you, on my right hand; on my left I will place him\nwho has ever been as a brother to me,\" pointing with a soft and gentle\nsmile to Fernand; but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst\ntorture on him, for his lips became ghastly pale, and even beneath the\ndark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though\nsome sudden pang drove it back to the heart.\n\nDuring this time, Dantes, at the opposite side of the table, had been\noccupied in similarly placing his most honored guests. M. Morrel was\nseated at his right hand, Danglars at his left; while, at a sign from\nEdmond, the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most\nagreeable.\n\nThen they began to pass around the dusky, piquant, Arlesian sausages,\nand lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses, prawns of large size and\nbrilliant color, the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel\nwithin, the clovis, esteemed by the epicures of the South as more than\nrivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster,--all the delicacies, in\nfact, that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach, and\nstyled by the grateful fishermen \"fruits of the sea.\"\n\n\"A pretty silence truly!\" said the old father of the bride-groom, as\nhe carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the\ntopaz, and which had just been placed before Mercedes herself. \"Now,\nwould anybody think that this room contained a happy, merry party, who\ndesire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" sighed Caderousse, \"a man cannot always feel happy because he is\nabout to be married.\"\n\n\"The truth is,\" replied Dantes, \"that I am too happy for noisy mirth;\nif that is what you meant by your observation, my worthy friend, you\nare right; joy takes a strange effect at times, it seems to oppress us\nalmost the same as sorrow.\"\n\nDanglars looked towards Fernand, whose excitable nature received and\nbetrayed each fresh impression.\n\n\"Why, what ails you?\" asked he of Edmond. \"Do you fear any approaching\nevil? I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this\ninstant.\"\n\n\"And that is the very thing that alarms me,\" returned Dantes. \"Man does\nnot appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed; happiness\nis like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood, where fierce,\nfiery dragons defend the entrance and approach; and monsters of all\nshapes and kinds, requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours. I own\nthat I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which I\nfeel myself unworthy--that of being the husband of Mercedes.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay!\" cried Caderousse, smiling, \"you have not attained that honor\nyet. Mercedes is not yet your wife. Just assume the tone and manner of\na husband, and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet\ncome!\"\n\nThe bride blushed, while Fernand, restless and uneasy, seemed to start\nat every fresh sound, and from time to time wiped away the large drops\nof perspiration that gathered on his brow.\n\n\"Well, never mind that, neighbor Caderousse; it is not worth while to\ncontradict me for such a trifle as that. 'Tis true that Mercedes is not\nactually my wife; but,\" added he, drawing out his watch, \"in an hour and\na half she will be.\"\n\nA general exclamation of surprise ran round the table, with the\nexception of the elder Dantes, whose laugh displayed the still perfect\nbeauty of his large white teeth. Mercedes looked pleased and gratified,\nwhile Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch.\n\n\"In an hour?\" inquired Danglars, turning pale. \"How is that, my friend?\"\n\n\"Why, thus it is,\" replied Dantes. \"Thanks to the influence of M.\nMorrel, to whom, next to my father, I owe every blessing I enjoy, every\ndifficulty his been removed. We have purchased permission to waive the\nusual delay; and at half-past two o'clock the mayor of Marseilles will\nbe waiting for us at the city hall. Now, as a quarter-past one has\nalready struck, I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying,\nthat, in another hour and thirty minutes Mercedes will have become\nMadame Dantes.\"\n\nFernand closed his eyes, a burning sensation passed across his brow, and\nhe was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling\nfrom his chair; but in spite of all his efforts, he could not refrain\nfrom uttering a deep groan, which, however, was lost amid the noisy\nfelicitations of the company.\n\n\"Upon my word,\" cried the old man, \"you make short work of this kind of\naffair. Arrived here only yesterday morning, and married to-day at three\no'clock! Commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work!\"\n\n\"But,\" asked Danglars, in a timid tone, \"how did you manage about the\nother formalities--the contract--the settlement?\"\n\n\"The contract,\" answered Dantes, laughingly, \"it didn't take long to\nfix that. Mercedes has no fortune; I have none to settle on her. So, you\nsee, our papers were quickly written out, and certainly do not come very\nexpensive.\" This joke elicited a fresh burst of applause.\n\n\"So that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to\nbe the actual wedding dinner!\" said Danglars.\n\n\"No, no,\" answered Dantes; \"don't imagine I am going to put you off in\nthat shabby manner. To-morrow morning I start for Paris; four days to\ngo, and the same to return, with one day to discharge the commission\nintrusted to me, is all the time I shall be absent. I shall be back here\nby the first of March, and on the second I give my real marriage feast.\"\n\nThis prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests\nto such a degree, that the elder Dantes, who, at the commencement of\nthe repast, had commented upon the silence that prevailed, now found\nit difficult, amid the general din of voices, to obtain a moment's\ntranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride\nand bride-groom.\n\nDantes, perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father, responded\nby a look of grateful pleasure; while Mercedes glanced at the clock and\nmade an expressive gesture to Edmond.\n\nAround the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at\nsuch a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of\nsocial position not to feel the trammels of etiquette. Such as at\nthe commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves\naccording to their inclination rose unceremoniously, and sought out more\nagreeable companions. Everybody talked at once, without waiting for a\nreply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own\nthoughts.\n\nFernand's paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Danglars.\nAs for Fernand himself, he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the\ndamned; unable to rest, he was among the first to quit the table,\nand, as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such\ndeafening sounds, he continued, in utter silence, to pace the farther\nend of the salon.\n\nCaderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom Fernand seemed most\nanxious to avoid, had joined him in a corner of the room.\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Caderousse, from whose mind the friendly treatment\nof Dantes, united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken\nof, had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at Dantes' good\nfortune,--\"upon my word, Dantes is a downright good fellow, and when I\nsee him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be. I\ncannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him\nthat trick you were planning yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh, there was no harm meant,\" answered Danglars; \"at first I certainly\ndid feel somewhat uneasy as to what Fernand might be tempted to do; but\nwhen I saw how completely he had mastered his feelings, even so far as\nto become one of his rival's attendants, I knew there was no further\ncause for apprehension.\" Caderousse looked full at Fernand--he was\nghastly pale.\n\n\"Certainly,\" continued Danglars, \"the sacrifice was no trifling one,\nwhen the beauty of the bride is concerned. Upon my soul, that future\ncaptain of mine is a lucky dog! Gad, I only wish he would let me take\nhis place.\"\n\n\"Shall we not set forth?\" asked the sweet, silvery voice of Mercedes;\n\"two o'clock has just struck, and you know we are expected in a quarter\nof an hour.\"\n\n\"To be sure!--to be sure!\" cried Dantes, eagerly quitting the table;\n\"let us go directly!\"\n\nHis words were re-echoed by the whole party, with vociferous cheers.\n\nAt this moment Danglars, who had been incessantly observing every change\nin Fernand's look and manner, saw him stagger and fall back, with an\nalmost convulsive spasm, against a seat placed near one of the open\nwindows. At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound\non the stairs, followed by the measured tread of soldiery, with the\nclanking of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and buzz\nas of many voices, so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal\nparty, among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled\nevery disposition to talk, and almost instantaneously the most deathlike\nstillness prevailed.\n\nThe sounds drew nearer. Three blows were struck upon the panel of the\ndoor. The company looked at each other in consternation.\n\n\"I demand admittance,\" said a loud voice outside the room, \"in the name\nof the law!\" As no attempt was made to prevent it, the door was opened,\nand a magistrate, wearing his official scarf, presented himself,\nfollowed by four soldiers and a corporal. Uneasiness now yielded to the\nmost extreme dread on the part of those present.\n\n\"May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit?\" said\nM. Morrel, addressing the magistrate, whom he evidently knew; \"there is\ndoubtless some mistake easily explained.\"\n\n\"If it be so,\" replied the magistrate, \"rely upon every reparation being\nmade; meanwhile, I am the bearer of an order of arrest, and although I\nmost reluctantly perform the task assigned me, it must, nevertheless, be\nfulfilled. Who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of\nEdmond Dantes?\" Every eye was turned towards the young man who, spite of\nthe agitation he could not but feel, advanced with dignity, and said, in\na firm voice, \"I am he; what is your pleasure with me?\"\n\n\"Edmond Dantes,\" replied the magistrate, \"I arrest you in the name of\nthe law!\"\n\n\"Me!\" repeated Edmond, slightly changing color, \"and wherefore, I pray?\"\n\n\"I cannot inform you, but you will be duly acquainted with the\nreasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary\nexamination.\"\n\nM. Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless. He\nsaw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law, and perfectly\nwell knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate\ndecked with his official scarf, as to address a petition to some cold\nmarble effigy. Old Dantes, however, sprang forward. There are situations\nwhich the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to understand.\nHe prayed and supplicated in terms so moving, that even the officer\nwas touched, and, although firm in his duty, he kindly said, \"My worthy\nfriend, let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions. Your son has\nprobably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his\ncargo, and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly\nhe has given the information required, whether touching the health of\nhis crew, or the value of his freight.\"\n\n\"What is the meaning of all this?\" inquired Caderousse, frowningly, of\nDanglars, who had assumed an air of utter surprise.\n\n\"How can I tell you?\" replied he; \"I am, like yourself, utterly\nbewildered at all that is going on, and cannot in the least make out\nwhat it is about.\" Caderousse then looked around for Fernand, but he had\ndisappeared.\n\nThe scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling\nclearness. The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared\neffectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the\nevening before had raised between himself and his memory.\n\n\"So, so,\" said he, in a hoarse and choking voice, to Danglars, \"this,\nthen, I suppose, is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday?\nAll I can say is, that if it be so, 'tis an ill turn, and well deserves\nto bring double evil on those who have projected it.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" returned Danglars, \"I tell you again I have nothing whatever\nto do with it; besides, you know very well that I tore the paper to\npieces.\"\n\n\"No, you did not!\" answered Caderousse, \"you merely threw it by--I saw\nit lying in a corner.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, you fool!--what should you know about it?--why, you\nwere drunk!\"\n\n\"Where is Fernand?\" inquired Caderousse.\n\n\"How do I know?\" replied Danglars; \"gone, as every prudent man ought to\nbe, to look after his own affairs, most likely. Never mind where he is,\nlet you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor friends.\"\n\nDuring this conversation, Dantes, after having exchanged a cheerful\nshake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends, had surrendered\nhimself to the officer sent to arrest him, merely saying, \"Make\nyourselves quite easy, my good fellows, there is some little mistake to\nclear up, that's all, depend upon it; and very likely I may not have to\ngo so far as the prison to effect that.\"\n\n\"Oh, to be sure!\" responded Danglars, who had now approached the group,\n\"nothing more than a mistake, I feel quite certain.\"\n\nDantes descended the staircase, preceded by the magistrate, and followed\nby the soldiers. A carriage awaited him at the door; he got in, followed\nby two soldiers and the magistrate, and the vehicle drove off towards\nMarseilles.\n\n\"Adieu, adieu, dearest Edmond!\" cried Mercedes, stretching out her arms\nto him from the balcony.\n\nThe prisoner heard the cry, which sounded like the sob of a broken\nheart, and leaning from the coach he called out, \"Good-by, Mercedes--we\nshall soon meet again!\" Then the vehicle disappeared round one of the\nturnings of Fort Saint Nicholas.\n\n\"Wait for me here, all of you!\" cried M. Morrel; \"I will take the first\nconveyance I find, and hurry to Marseilles, whence I will bring you word\nhow all is going on.\"\n\n\"That's right!\" exclaimed a multitude of voices, \"go, and return as\nquickly as you can!\"\n\nThis second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of\nterrified silence on the part of those who were left behind. The old\nfather and Mercedes remained for some time apart, each absorbed in\ngrief; but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their\neyes, and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other's\narms.\n\nMeanwhile Fernand made his appearance, poured out for himself a glass\nof water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it, went to sit\ndown at the first vacant place, and this was, by mere chance, placed\nnext to the seat on which poor Mercedes had fallen half fainting,\nwhen released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old Dantes.\nInstinctively Fernand drew back his chair.\n\n\"He is the cause of all this misery--I am quite sure of it,\" whispered\nCaderousse, who had never taken his eyes off Fernand, to Danglars.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" answered the other; \"he's too stupid to imagine such\na scheme. I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever\nwrought it.\"\n\n\"You don't mention those who aided and abetted the deed,\" said\nCaderousse.\n\n\"Surely,\" answered Danglars, \"one cannot be held responsible for every\nchance arrow shot into the air.\"\n\n\"You can, indeed, when the arrow lights point downward on somebody's\nhead.\"\n\nMeantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every\ndifferent form.\n\n\"What think you, Danglars,\" said one of the party, turning towards him,\n\"of this event?\"\n\n\"Why,\" replied he, \"I think it just possible Dantes may have been\ndetected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as\ncontraband.\"\n\n\"But how could he have done so without your knowledge, Danglars, since\nyou are the ship's supercargo?\"\n\n\"Why, as for that, I could only know what I was told respecting the\nmerchandise with which the vessel was laden. I know she was loaded with\ncotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastret's\nwarehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascal's; that is all I was obliged to\nknow, and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars.\"\n\n\"Now I recollect,\" said the afflicted old father; \"my poor boy told me\nyesterday he had got a small case of coffee, and another of tobacco for\nme!\"\n\n\"There, you see,\" exclaimed Danglars. \"Now the mischief is out; depend\nupon it the custom-house people went rummaging about the ship in our\nabsence, and discovered poor Dantes' hidden treasures.\"\n\nMercedes, however, paid no heed to this explanation of her lover's\narrest. Her grief, which she had hitherto tried to restrain, now burst\nout in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said the old man, \"be comforted, my poor child; there is\nstill hope!\"\n\n\"Hope!\" repeated Danglars.\n\n\"Hope!\" faintly murmured Fernand, but the word seemed to die away on his\npale agitated lips, and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance.\n\n\"Good news! good news!\" shouted forth one of the party stationed in the\nbalcony on the lookout. \"Here comes M. Morrel back. No doubt, now, we\nshall hear that our friend is released!\"\n\nMercedes and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at\nthe door. He was very pale.\n\n\"What news?\" exclaimed a general burst of voices.\n\n\"Alas, my friends,\" replied M. Morrel, with a mournful shake of his\nhead, \"the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I expected.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed--indeed, sir, he is innocent!\" sobbed forth Mercedes.\n\n\"That I believe!\" answered M. Morrel; \"but still he is charged\"--\n\n\"With what?\" inquired the elder Dantes.\n\n\"With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction!\" Many of our readers\nmay be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the\nperiod at which our story is dated.\n\nA despairing cry escaped the pale lips of Mercedes; the old man sank\ninto a chair.\n\n\"Ah, Danglars!\" whispered Caderousse, \"you have deceived me--the trick\nyou spoke of last night has been played; but I cannot suffer a poor\nold man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault. I am\ndetermined to tell them all about it.\"\n\n\"Be silent, you simpleton!\" cried Danglars, grasping him by the arm, \"or\nI will not answer even for your own safety. Who can tell whether Dantes\nbe innocent or guilty? The vessel did touch at Elba, where he quitted\nit, and passed a whole day in the island. Now, should any letters or\nother documents of a compromising character be found upon him, will it\nnot be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices?\"\n\nWith the rapid instinct of selfishness, Caderousse readily perceived the\nsolidity of this mode of reasoning; he gazed, doubtfully, wistfully, on\nDanglars, and then caution supplanted generosity.\n\n\"Suppose we wait a while, and see what comes of it,\" said he, casting a\nbewildered look on his companion.\n\n\"To be sure!\" answered Danglars. \"Let us wait, by all means. If he be\ninnocent, of course he will be set at liberty; if guilty, why, it is no\nuse involving ourselves in a conspiracy.\"\n\n\"Let us go, then. I cannot stay here any longer.\"\n\n\"With all my heart!\" replied Danglars, pleased to find the other so\ntractable. \"Let us take ourselves out of the way, and leave things for\nthe present to take their course.\"\n\nAfter their departure, Fernand, who had now again become the friend and\nprotector of Mercedes, led the girl to her home, while the friends of\nDantes conducted the now half-fainting man back to his abode.\n\nThe rumor of Edmond's arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in\ncirculating throughout the city.\n\n\"Could you ever have credited such a thing, my dear Danglars?\" asked M.\nMorrel, as, on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh\ntidings of Dantes, from M. de Villefort, the assistant procureur, he\novertook his supercargo and Caderousse. \"Could you have believed such a\nthing possible?\"\n\n\"Why, you know I told you,\" replied Danglars, \"that I considered the\ncircumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very\nsuspicious circumstance.\"\n\n\"And did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself?\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\" returned Danglars. Then added in a low whisper, \"You\nunderstand that, on account of your uncle, M. Policar Morrel, who served\nunder the other government, and who does not altogether conceal what\nhe thinks on the subject, you are strongly suspected of regretting the\nabdication of Napoleon. I should have feared to injure both Edmond and\nyourself, had I divulged my own apprehensions to a soul. I am too well\naware that though a subordinate, like myself, is bound to acquaint the\nshipowner with everything that occurs, there are many things he ought\nmost carefully to conceal from all else.\"\n\n\"'Tis well, Danglars--'tis well!\" replied M. Morrel. \"You are a worthy\nfellow; and I had already thought of your interests in the event of poor\nEdmond having become captain of the Pharaon.\"\n\n\"Is it possible you were so kind?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed; I had previously inquired of Dantes what was his opinion\nof you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your\npost, for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you.\"\n\n\"And what was his reply?\"\n\n\"That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair\nwhich he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that\nwhoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship's owner\nwould have his preference also.\"\n\n\"The hypocrite!\" murmured Danglars.\n\n\"Poor Dantes!\" said Caderousse. \"No one can deny his being a\nnoble-hearted young fellow.\"\n\n\"But meanwhile,\" continued M. Morrel, \"here is the Pharaon without a\ncaptain.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" replied Danglars, \"since we cannot leave this port for the next\nthree months, let us hope that ere the expiration of that period Dantes\nwill be set at liberty.\"\n\n\"No doubt; but in the meantime?\"\n\n\"I am entirely at your service, M. Morrel,\" answered Danglars. \"You know\nthat I am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain\nin the service; and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my\nservices, that upon Edmond's release from prison no further change will\nbe requisite on board the Pharaon than for Dantes and myself each to\nresume our respective posts.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Danglars--that will smooth over all difficulties. I fully\nauthorize you at once to assume the command of the Pharaon, and look\ncarefully to the unloading of her freight. Private misfortunes must\nnever be allowed to interfere with business.\"\n\n\"Be easy on that score, M. Morrel; but do you think we shall be\npermitted to see our poor Edmond?\"\n\n\"I will let you know that directly I have seen M. de Villefort, whom I\nshall endeavor to interest in Edmond's favor. I am aware he is a furious\nroyalist; but, in spite of that, and of his being king's attorney, he is\na man like ourselves, and I fancy not a bad sort of one.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" replied Danglars; \"but I hear that he is ambitious, and\nthat's rather against him.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" returned M. Morrel, \"we shall see. But now hasten on\nboard, I will join you there ere long.\" So saying, the worthy shipowner\nquitted the two allies, and proceeded in the direction of the Palais de\nJustice.\n\n\"You see,\" said Danglars, addressing Caderousse, \"the turn things have\ntaken. Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence?\"\n\n\"Not the slightest, but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere\njoke should lead to such consequences.\"\n\n\"But who perpetrated that joke, let me ask? neither you nor myself, but\nFernand; you knew very well that I threw the paper into a corner of the\nroom--indeed, I fancied I had destroyed it.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" replied Caderousse, \"that I can answer for, you did not. I\nonly wish I could see it now as plainly as I saw it lying all crushed\nand crumpled in a corner of the arbor.\"\n\n\"Well, then, if you did, depend upon it, Fernand picked it up, and\neither copied it or caused it to be copied; perhaps, even, he did not\ntake the trouble of recopying it. And now I think of it, by Heavens, he\nmay have sent the letter itself! Fortunately, for me, the handwriting\nwas disguised.\"\n\n\"Then you were aware of Dantes being engaged in a conspiracy?\"\n\n\"Not I. As I before said, I thought the whole thing was a joke, nothing\nmore. It seems, however, that I have unconsciously stumbled upon the\ntruth.\"\n\n\"Still,\" argued Caderousse, \"I would give a great deal if nothing of the\nkind had happened; or, at least, that I had had no hand in it. You will\nsee, Danglars, that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! If any harm come of it, it should fall on the guilty person;\nand that, you know, is Fernand. How can we be implicated in any way?\nAll we have got to do is, to keep our own counsel, and remain perfectly\nquiet, not breathing a word to any living soul; and you will see that\nthe storm will pass away without in the least affecting us.\"\n\n\"Amen!\" responded Caderousse, waving his hand in token of adieu to\nDanglars, and bending his steps towards the Allees de Meillan, moving\nhis head to and fro, and muttering as he went, after the manner of one\nwhose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea.\n\n\"So far, then,\" said Danglars, mentally, \"all has gone as I would have\nit. I am, temporarily, commander of the Pharaon, with the certainty of\nbeing permanently so, if that fool of a Caderousse can be persuaded to\nhold his tongue. My only fear is the chance of Dantes being released.\nBut, there, he is in the hands of Justice; and,\" added he with a smile,\n\"she will take her own.\" So saying, he leaped into a boat, desiring to\nbe rowed on board the Pharaon, where M. Morrel had agreed to meet him.\n\n\n\nChapter 6. The Deputy Procureur du Roi.\n\nIn one of the aristocratic mansions built by Puget in the Rue du Grand\nCours opposite the Medusa fountain, a second marriage feast was being\ncelebrated, almost at the same hour with the nuptial repast given\nby Dantes. In this case, however, although the occasion of the\nentertainment was similar, the company was strikingly dissimilar.\nInstead of a rude mixture of sailors, soldiers, and those belonging to\nthe humblest grade of life, the present assembly was composed of the\nvery flower of Marseilles society,--magistrates who had resigned their\noffice during the usurper's reign; officers who had deserted from the\nimperial army and joined forces with Conde; and younger members of\nfamilies, brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of\nexile would convert into a martyr, and fifteen of restoration elevate to\nthe rank of a god.\n\nThe guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic\nconversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions\nthat then agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily, for five\ncenturies religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the\nviolence of party feeling.\n\nThe emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held\nsovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects\na small population of five or six thousand souls,--after having been\naccustomed to hear the \"Vive Napoleons\" of a hundred and twenty millions\nof human beings, uttered in ten different languages,--was looked upon\nhere as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh connection with\nFrance or claim to her throne.\n\nThe magistrates freely discussed their political views; the military\npart of the company talked unreservedly of Moscow and Leipsic, while\nthe women commented on the divorce of Josephine. It was not over the\ndownfall of the man, but over the defeat of the Napoleonic idea, that\nthey rejoiced, and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and\ncheering prospect of a revivified political existence.\n\nAn old man, decorated with the cross of Saint Louis, now rose and\nproposed the health of King Louis XVIII. It was the Marquis de\nSaint-Meran. This toast, recalling at once the patient exile of Hartwell\nand the peace-loving King of France, excited universal enthusiasm;\nglasses were elevated in the air a l'Anglais, and the ladies, snatching\ntheir bouquets from their fair bosoms, strewed the table with their\nfloral treasures. In a word, an almost poetical fervor prevailed.\n\n\"Ah,\" said the Marquise de Saint-Meran, a woman with a stern, forbidding\neye, though still noble and distinguished in appearance, despite her\nfifty years--\"ah, these revolutionists, who have driven us from those\nvery possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the\nReign of Terror, would be compelled to own, were they here, that all\ntrue devotion was on our side, since we were content to follow the\nfortunes of a falling monarch, while they, on the contrary, made their\nfortune by worshipping the rising sun; yes, yes, they could not help\nadmitting that the king, for whom we sacrificed rank, wealth, and\nstation was truly our 'Louis the well-beloved,' while their wretched\nusurper his been, and ever will be, to them their evil genius, their\n'Napoleon the accursed.' Am I not right, Villefort?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, madame. I really must pray you to excuse me, but--in\ntruth--I was not attending to the conversation.\"\n\n\"Marquise, marquise!\" interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the\ntoast, \"let the young people alone; let me tell you, on one's wedding\nday there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry\npolitics.\"\n\n\"Never mind, dearest mother,\" said a young and lovely girl, with a\nprofusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid\ncrystal, \"'tis all my fault for seizing upon M. de Villefort, so as to\nprevent his listening to what you said. But there--now take him--he is\nyour own for as long as you like. M. Villefort, I beg to remind you my\nmother speaks to you.\"\n\n\"If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly\ncaught, I shall be delighted to answer,\" said M. de Villefort.\n\n\"Never mind, Renee,\" replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness\nthat seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however all\nother feelings may be withered in a woman's nature, there is always one\nbright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the shrine\nof maternal love. \"I forgive you. What I was saying, Villefort, was,\nthat the Bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or devotion.\"\n\n\"They had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,\"\nreplied the young man, \"and that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the\nMahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but\nambitions followers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the\npersonification of equality.\"\n\n\"He!\" cried the marquise: \"Napoleon the type of equality! For mercy's\nsake, then, what would you call Robespierre? Come, come, do not strip\nthe latter of his just rights to bestow them on the Corsican, who, to my\nmind, has usurped quite enough.\"\n\n\"Nay, madame; I would place each of these heroes on his right\npedestal--that of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis Quinze;\nthat of Napoleon on the column of the Place Vendome. The only difference\nconsists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these\ntwo men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the equality\nthat degrades; one brings a king within reach of the guillotine, the\nother elevates the people to a level with the throne. Observe,\" said\nVillefort, smiling, \"I do not mean to deny that both these men were\nrevolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and the 4th of\nApril, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy of being\ngratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order;\nand that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust he is\nforever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites.\nStill, marquise, it has been so with other usurpers--Cromwell, for\ninstance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon, had his partisans and\nadvocates.\"\n\n\"Do you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully\nrevolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the\nson of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.\" A\ndeep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort.\n\n\"'Tis true, madame,\" answered he, \"that my father was a Girondin, but he\nwas not among the number of those who voted for the king's death; he\nwas an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and\nhad well-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father\nperished.\"\n\n\"True,\" replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree at\nthe tragic remembrance thus called up; \"but bear in mind, if you please,\nthat our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from\ndiametrically opposite principles; in proof of which I may remark, that\nwhile my family remained among the stanchest adherents of the exiled\nprinces, your father lost no time in joining the new government; and\nthat while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin, the Count Noirtier\nbecame a senator.\"\n\n\"Dear mother,\" interposed Renee, \"you know very well it was agreed that\nall these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside.\"\n\n\"Suffer me, also, madame,\" replied Villefort, \"to add my earnest request\nto Mademoiselle de Saint-Meran's, that you will kindly allow the veil of\noblivion to cover and conceal the past. What avails recrimination over\nmatters wholly past recall? For my own part, I have laid aside even the\nname of my father, and altogether disown his political principles. He\nwas--nay, probably may still be--a Bonapartist, and is called Noirtier;\nI, on the contrary, am a stanch royalist, and style myself de Villefort.\nLet what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away\nwith the old trunk, and condescend only to regard the young shoot which\nhas started up at a distance from the parent tree, without having the\npower, any more than the wish, to separate entirely from the stock from\nwhich it sprung.\"\n\n\"Bravo, Villefort!\" cried the marquis; \"excellently well said! Come,\nnow, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring\nto persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty and\nforgetfulness of the past.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" replied the marquise; \"let the past be forever\nforgotten. I promise you it affords me as little pleasure to revive it\nas it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be firm and inflexible\nfor the future in his political principles. Remember, also, Villefort,\nthat we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict\nloyalty, and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the\npast, as I do\" (and here she extended to him her hand)--\"as I now do at\nyour entreaty. But bear in mind, that should there fall in your way any\none guilty of conspiring against the government, you will be so much the\nmore bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment, as it is known\nyou belong to a suspected family.\"\n\n\"Alas, madame,\" returned Villefort, \"my profession, as well as the times\nin which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already successfully\nconducted several public prosecutions, and brought the offenders to\nmerited punishment. But we have not done with the thing yet.\"\n\n\"Do you, indeed, think so?\" inquired the marquise.\n\n\"I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is\ntoo near France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.\nMarseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one\nfrivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists;\nfrom hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of\npersons, and assassinations in the lower.\"\n\n\"You have heard, perhaps,\" said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de\nSaint-Meran's oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d'Artois,\n\"that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?\"\n\n\"Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,\" said M. de\nSaint-Meran; \"and where is it decided to transfer him?\"\n\n\"To Saint Helena.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, where is that?\" asked the marquise.\n\n\"An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two\nthousand leagues from here,\" replied the count.\n\n\"So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly\nto have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples,\nof which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the\nsovereignty of which he coveted for his son.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" said Villefort, \"there are the treaties of 1814, and we\ncannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, we shall find some way out of it,\" responded M. de Salvieux.\n\"There wasn't any trouble over treaties when it was a question of\nshooting the poor Duc d'Enghien.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the marquise, \"it seems probable that, by the aid of the\nHoly Alliance, we shall be rid of Napoleon; and we must trust to the\nvigilance of M. de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his partisans. The\nking is either a king or no king; if he be acknowledged as sovereign of\nFrance, he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity; and this can best\nbe effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every\nattempt at conspiracy--'tis the best and surest means of preventing\nmischief.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, madame,\" answered Villefort, \"the strong arm of the law\nis not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place.\"\n\n\"Then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it.\"\n\n\"Nay, madame, the law is frequently powerless to effect this; all it can\ndo is to avenge the wrong done.\"\n\n\"Oh, M. de Villefort,\" cried a beautiful young creature, daughter to\nthe Comte de Salvieux, and the cherished friend of Mademoiselle de\nSaint-Meran, \"do try and get up some famous trial while we are at\nMarseilles. I never was in a law-court; I am told it is so very\namusing!\"\n\n\"Amusing, certainly,\" replied the young man, \"inasmuch as, instead of\nshedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre,\nyou behold in a law-court a case of real and genuine distress--a drama\nof life. The prisoner whom you there see pale, agitated, and alarmed,\ninstead of--as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy--going home\nto sup peacefully with his family, and then retiring to rest, that he\nmay recommence his mimic woes on the morrow,--is removed from your\nsight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the\nexecutioner. I leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to\nbear you through such a scene. Of this, however, be assured, that should\nany favorable opportunity present itself, I will not fail to offer you\nthe choice of being present.\"\n\n\"For shame, M. de Villefort!\" said Renee, becoming quite pale; \"don't\nyou see how you are frightening us?--and yet you laugh.\"\n\n\"What would you have? 'Tis like a duel. I have already recorded\nsentence of death, five or six times, against the movers of political\nconspiracies, and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened,\nand only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart?\"\n\n\"Gracious heavens, M. de Villefort,\" said Renee, becoming more and more\nterrified; \"you surely are not in earnest.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am,\" replied the young magistrate with a smile; \"and in the\ninteresting trial that young lady is anxious to witness, the case would\nonly be still more aggravated. Suppose, for instance, the prisoner,\nas is more than probable, to have served under Napoleon--well, can\nyou expect for an instant, that one accustomed, at the word of his\ncommander, to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe, will\nscruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to\nbe his personal enemy, than to slaughter his fellow-creatures, merely\nbecause bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey? Besides, one\nrequires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused, in\norder to lash one's self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power.\nI would not choose to see the man against whom I pleaded smile, as\nthough in mockery of my words. No; my pride is to see the accused pale,\nagitated, and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my\neloquence.\" Renee uttered a smothered exclamation.\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried one of the guests; \"that is what I call talking to some\npurpose.\"\n\n\"Just the person we require at a time like the present,\" said a second.\n\n\"What a splendid business that last case of yours was, my dear\nVillefort!\" remarked a third; \"I mean the trial of the man for murdering\nhis father. Upon my word, you killed him ere the executioner had laid\nhis hand upon him.\"\n\n\"Oh, as for parricides, and such dreadful people as that,\" interposed\nRenee, \"it matters very little what is done to them; but as regards\npoor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed\nthemselves up in political intrigues\"--\n\n\"Why, that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit; for,\ndon't you see, Renee, the king is the father of his people, and he who\nshall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent\nof thirty-two millions of souls, is a parricide upon a fearfully great\nscale?\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about that,\" replied Renee; \"but, M. de\nVillefort, you have promised me--have you not?--always to show mercy to\nthose I plead for.\"\n\n\"Make yourself quite easy on that point,\" answered Villefort, with\none of his sweetest smiles; \"you and I will always consult upon our\nverdicts.\"\n\n\"My love,\" said the marquise, \"attend to your doves, your lap-dogs, and\nembroidery, but do not meddle with what you do not understand. Nowadays\nthe military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is\nthe badge of honor. There is a wise Latin proverb that is very much in\npoint.\"\n\n\"Cedant arma togae,\" said Villefort with a bow.\n\n\"I cannot speak Latin,\" responded the marquise.\n\n\"Well,\" said Renee, \"I cannot help regretting you had not chosen some\nother profession than your own--a physician, for instance. Do you know I\nalways felt a shudder at the idea of even a destroying angel?\"\n\n\"Dear, good Renee,\" whispered Villefort, as he gazed with unutterable\ntenderness on the lovely speaker.\n\n\"Let us hope, my child,\" cried the marquis, \"that M. de Villefort may\nprove the moral and political physician of this province; if so, he will\nhave achieved a noble work.\"\n\n\"And one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father's\nconduct,\" added the incorrigible marquise.\n\n\"Madame,\" replied Villefort, with a mournful smile, \"I have already had\nthe honor to observe that my father has--at least, I hope so--abjured\nhis past errors, and that he is, at the present moment, a firm and\nzealous friend to religion and order--a better royalist, possibly, than\nhis son; for he has to atone for past dereliction, while I have no other\nimpulse than warm, decided preference and conviction.\" Having made this\nwell-turned speech, Villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect\nof his oratory, much as he would have done had he been addressing the\nbench in open court.\n\n\"Do you know, my dear Villefort,\" cried the Comte de Salvieux, \"that\nis exactly what I myself said the other day at the Tuileries, when\nquestioned by his majesty's principal chamberlain touching the\nsingularity of an alliance between the son of a Girondin and the\ndaughter of an officer of the Duc de Conde; and I assure you he seemed\nfully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences\nwas based upon sound and excellent principles. Then the king, who,\nwithout our suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted\nus by saying, 'Villefort'--observe that the king did not pronounce the\nword Noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on\nthat of Villefort--'Villefort,' said his majesty, 'is a young man of\ngreat judgment and discretion, who will be sure to make a figure in his\nprofession; I like him much, and it gave me great pleasure to hear that\nhe was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and Marquise de\nSaint-Meran. I should myself have recommended the match, had not the\nnoble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it.'\"\n\n\"Is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express\nhimself so favorably of me?\" asked the enraptured Villefort.\n\n\"I give you his very words; and if the marquis chooses to be candid,\nhe will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to\nhim, when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your\nespousing his daughter.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" answered the marquis.\n\n\"How much do I owe this gracious prince! What is there I would not do to\nevince my earnest gratitude!\"\n\n\"That is right,\" cried the marquise. \"I love to see you thus. Now, then,\nwere a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be most welcome.\"\n\n\"For my part, dear mother.\" interposed Renee, \"I trust your wishes will\nnot prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty offenders,\npoor debtors, and miserable cheats to fall into M. de Villefort's\nhands,--then I shall be contented.\"\n\n\"Just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be\ncalled upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of\nwasps, or any other slight affection of the epidermis. If you wish to\nsee me the king's attorney, you must desire for me some of those violent\nand dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to\nthe physician.\"\n\nAt this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefort's wish had\nsufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and\nwhispered a few words in his ear. Villefort immediately rose from table\nand quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon, however,\nreturned, his whole face beaming with delight. Renee regarded him with\nfond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as they then\nwere with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed to excite\nthe innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and\nintelligent lover.\n\n\"You were wishing just now,\" said Villefort, addressing her, \"that\nI were a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at least resemble the\ndisciples of Esculapius in one thing--that of not being able to call a\nday my own, not even that of my betrothal.\"\n\n\"And wherefore were you called away just now?\" asked Mademoiselle de\nSaint-Meran, with an air of deep interest.\n\n\"For a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the\nexecutioner.\"\n\n\"How dreadful!\" exclaimed Renee, turning pale.\n\n\"Is it possible?\" burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to\nthe magistrate to hear his words.\n\n\"Why, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonaparte conspiracy\nhas just been discovered.\"\n\n\"Can I believe my ears?\" cried the marquise.\n\n\"I will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,\" said\nVillefort:--\n\n\"'The king's attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the\nreligions institutions of his country, that one named Edmond Dantes,\nmate of the ship Pharaon, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having\ntouched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter\nfrom Murat to the usurper, and again taken charge of another letter from\nthe usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample corroboration of\nthis statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned Edmond\nDantes, who either carries the letter for Paris about with him, or has\nit at his father's abode. Should it not be found in the possession\nof father or son, then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin\nbelonging to the said Dantes on board the Pharaon.'\"\n\n\"But,\" said Renee, \"this letter, which, after all, is but an anonymous\nscrawl, is not even addressed to you, but to the king's attorney.\"\n\n\"True; but that gentleman being absent, his secretary, by his orders,\nopened his letters; thinking this one of importance, he sent for me,\nbut not finding me, took upon himself to give the necessary orders for\narresting the accused party.\"\n\n\"Then the guilty person is absolutely in custody?\" said the marquise.\n\n\"Nay, dear mother, say the accused person. You know we cannot yet\npronounce him guilty.\"\n\n\"He is in safe custody,\" answered Villefort; \"and rely upon it, if\nthe letter is found, he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again,\nunless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman.\"\n\n\"And where is the unfortunate being?\" asked Renee.\n\n\"He is at my house.\"\n\n\"Come, come, my friend,\" interrupted the marquise, \"do not neglect your\nduty to linger with us. You are the king's servant, and must go wherever\nthat service calls you.\"\n\n\"O Villefort!\" cried Renee, clasping her hands, and looking towards\nher lover with piteous earnestness, \"be merciful on this the day of our\nbetrothal.\"\n\nThe young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair\npleader sat, and leaning over her chair said tenderly,--\n\n\"To give you pleasure, my sweet Renee, I promise to show all the lenity\nin my power; but if the charges brought against this Bonapartist hero\nprove correct, why, then, you really must give me leave to order his\nhead to be cut off.\" Renee shuddered.\n\n\"Never mind that foolish girl, Villefort,\" said the marquise. \"She will\nsoon get over these things.\" So saying, Madame de Saint-Meran extended\nher dry bony hand to Villefort, who, while imprinting a son-in-law's\nrespectful salute on it, looked at Renee, as much as to say, \"I must try\nand fancy 'tis your dear hand I kiss, as it should have been.\"\n\n\"These are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal,\" sighed poor\nRenee.\n\n\"Upon my word, child!\" exclaimed the angry marquise, \"your folly exceeds\nall bounds. I should be glad to know what connection there can possibly\nbe between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state!\"\n\n\"O mother!\" murmured Renee.\n\n\"Nay, madame, I pray you pardon this little traitor. I promise you that\nto make up for her want of loyalty, I will be most inflexibly severe;\"\nthen casting an expressive glance at his betrothed, which seemed to say,\n\"Fear not, for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with mercy,\"\nand receiving a sweet and approving smile in return, Villefort quitted\nthe room.\n\n\n\nChapter 7. The Examination.\n\nNo sooner had Villefort left the salon, than he assumed the grave air\nof a man who holds the balance of life and death in his hands. Now, in\nspite of the nobility of his countenance, the command of which, like a\nfinished actor, he had carefully studied before the glass, it was by\nno means easy for him to assume an air of judicial severity. Except the\nrecollection of the line of politics his father had adopted, and which\nmight interfere, unless he acted with the greatest prudence, with his\nown career, Gerard de Villefort was as happy as a man could be. Already\nrich, he held a high official situation, though only twenty-seven.\nHe was about to marry a young and charming woman, whom he loved, not\npassionately, but reasonably, as became a deputy attorney of the\nking; and besides her personal attractions, which were very great,\nMademoiselle de Saint-Meran's family possessed considerable political\ninfluence, which they would, of course, exert in his favor. The dowry\nof his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns, and he had, besides,\nthe prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a million at her\nfather's death. These considerations naturally gave Villefort a feeling\nof such complete felicity that his mind was fairly dazzled in its\ncontemplation.\n\nAt the door he met the commissary of police, who was waiting for him.\nThe sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to\nearth; he composed his face, as we have before described, and said, \"I\nhave read the letter, sir, and you have acted rightly in arresting\nthis man; now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the\nconspiracy.\"\n\n\"We know nothing as yet of the conspiracy, monsieur; all the papers\nfound have been sealed up and placed on your desk. The prisoner himself\nis named Edmond Dantes, mate on board the three-master the Pharaon,\ntrading in cotton with Alexandria and Smyrna, and belonging to Morrel &\nSon, of Marseilles.\"\n\n\"Before he entered the merchant service, had he ever served in the\nmarines?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, monsieur, he is very young.\"\n\n\"How old?\"\n\n\"Nineteen or twenty at the most.\"\n\nAt this moment, and as Villefort had arrived at the corner of the\nRue des Conseils, a man, who seemed to have been waiting for him,\napproached; it was M. Morrel.\n\n\"Ah, M. de Villefort,\" cried he, \"I am delighted to see you. Some\nof your people have committed the strangest mistake--they have just\narrested Edmond Dantes, mate of my vessel.\"\n\n\"I know it, monsieur,\" replied Villefort, \"and I am now going to examine\nhim.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Morrel, carried away by his friendship, \"you do not know him,\nand I do. He is the most estimable, the most trustworthy creature in the\nworld, and I will venture to say, there is not a better seaman in all\nthe merchant service. Oh, M. de Villefort, I beseech your indulgence for\nhim.\"\n\nVillefort, as we have seen, belonged to the aristocratic party at\nMarseilles, Morrel to the plebeian; the first was a royalist, the other\nsuspected of Bonapartism. Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel, and\nreplied,--\n\n\"You are aware, monsieur, that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in\nprivate life, and the best seaman in the merchant service, and yet be,\npolitically speaking, a great criminal. Is it not true?\"\n\nThe magistrate laid emphasis on these words, as if he wished to apply\nthem to the owner himself, while his eyes seemed to plunge into\nthe heart of one who, interceding for another, had himself need of\nindulgence. Morrel reddened, for his own conscience was not quite clear\non politics; besides, what Dantes had told him of his interview with the\ngrand-marshal, and what the emperor had said to him, embarrassed him. He\nreplied, however,--\n\n\"I entreat you, M. de Villefort, be, as you always are, kind and\nequitable, and give him back to us soon.\" This give us sounded\nrevolutionary in the deputy's ears.\n\n\"Ah, ah,\" murmured he, \"is Dantes then a member of some Carbonari\nsociety, that his protector thus employs the collective form? He was, if\nI recollect, arrested in a tavern, in company with a great many others.\"\nThen he added, \"Monsieur, you may rest assured I shall perform my duty\nimpartially, and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed\nto me in vain; should he, however, be guilty, in this present epoch,\nimpunity would furnish a dangerous example, and I must do my duty.\"\n\nAs he had now arrived at the door of his own house, which adjoined\nthe Palais de Justice, he entered, after having, coldly saluted the\nshipowner, who stood, as if petrified, on the spot where Villefort had\nleft him. The ante-chamber was full of police agents and gendarmes, in\nthe midst of whom, carefully watched, but calm and smiling, stood the\nprisoner. Villefort traversed the ante-chamber, cast a side glance at\nDantes, and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him, disappeared,\nsaying, \"Bring in the prisoner.\"\n\nRapid as had been Villefort's glance, it had served to give him an idea\nof the man he was about to interrogate. He had recognized intelligence\nin the high forehead, courage in the dark eye and bent brow, and\nfrankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth.\nVillefort's first impression was favorable; but he had been so often\nwarned to mistrust first impulses, that he applied the maxim to the\nimpression, forgetting the difference between the two words. He stifled,\ntherefore, the feelings of compassion that were rising, composed his\nfeatures, and sat down, grim and sombre, at his desk. An instant after\nDantes entered. He was pale, but calm and collected, and saluting his\njudge with easy politeness, looked round for a seat, as if he had been\nin M. Morrel's salon. It was then that he encountered for the first\ntime Villefort's look,--that look peculiar to the magistrate, who, while\nseeming to read the thoughts of others, betrays nothing of his own.\n\n\"Who and what are you?\" demanded Villefort, turning over a pile of\npapers, containing information relative to the prisoner, that a police\nagent had given to him on his entry, and that, already, in an hour's\ntime, had swelled to voluminous proportions, thanks to the corrupt\nespionage of which \"the accused\" is always made the victim.\n\n\"My name is Edmond Dantes,\" replied the young man calmly; \"I am mate of\nthe Pharaon, belonging to Messrs. Morrel & Son.\"\n\n\"Your age?\" continued Villefort.\n\n\"Nineteen,\" returned Dantes.\n\n\"What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?\"\n\n\"I was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur,\" said the young man,\nhis voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between that\nhappy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great\nwas the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the\nradiant face of Mercedes.\n\n\"You were at the festival of your marriage?\" said the deputy, shuddering\nin spite of himself.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been\nattached to for three years.\" Villefort, impassive as he was, was struck\nwith this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of Dantes, surprised\nin the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in his own\nbosom--he also was on the point of being married, and he was summoned\nfrom his own happiness to destroy that of another. \"This philosophic\nreflection,\" thought he, \"will make a great sensation at M. de\nSaint-Meran's;\" and he arranged mentally, while Dantes awaited further\nquestions, the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for\neloquence. When this speech was arranged, Villefort turned to Dantes.\n\n\"Go on, sir,\" said he.\n\n\"What would you have me say?\"\n\n\"Give all the information in your power.\"\n\n\"Tell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I\nknow; only,\" added he, with a smile, \"I warn you I know very little.\"\n\n\"Have you served under the usurper?\"\n\n\"I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.\"\n\n\"It is reported your political opinions are extreme,\" said Villefort,\nwho had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make this\ninquiry, as if it were an accusation.\n\n\"My political opinions!\" replied Dantes. \"Alas, sir, I never had any\nopinions. I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play.\nIf I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M. Morrel. Thus\nall my opinions--I will not say public, but private--are confined to\nthese three sentiments,--I love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and\nI adore Mercedes. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how\nuninteresting it is.\" As Dantes spoke, Villefort gazed at his ingenuous\nand open countenance, and recollected the words of Renee, who, without\nknowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him. With\nthe deputy's knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man\nuttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This lad, for he\nwas scarcely a man,--simple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of\nthe heart never found when sought for; full of affection for everybody,\nbecause he was happy, and because happiness renders even the wicked\ngood--extended his affection even to his judge, spite of Villefort's\nsevere look and stern accent. Dantes seemed full of kindness.\n\n\"Pardieu,\" said Villefort, \"he is a noble fellow. I hope I shall gain\nRenee's favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on\nme. I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet\nkiss in private.\" Full of this idea, Villefort's face became so joyous,\nthat when he turned to Dantes, the latter, who had watched the change on\nhis physiognomy, was smiling also.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Villefort, \"have you any enemies, at least, that you know.\"\n\n\"I have enemies?\" replied Dantes; \"my position is not sufficiently\nelevated for that. As for my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat\ntoo hasty; but I have striven to repress it. I have had ten or twelve\nsailors under me, and if you question them, they will tell you that\nthey love and respect me, not as a father, for I am too young, but as an\nelder brother.\"\n\n\"But you may have excited jealousy. You are about to become captain at\nnineteen--an elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl, who\nloves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the\nenvy of some one.\"\n\n\"You are right; you know men better than I do, and what you say may\npossibly be the case, I confess; but if such persons are among my\nacquaintances I prefer not to know it, because then I should be forced\nto hate them.\"\n\n\"You are wrong; you should always strive to see clearly around you. You\nseem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty\nto aid you in discovering the author of this accusation. Here is the\npaper; do you know the writing?\" As he spoke, Villefort drew the letter\nfrom his pocket, and presented it to Dantes. Dantes read it. A cloud\npassed over his brow as he said,--\n\n\"No, monsieur, I do not know the writing, and yet it is tolerably plain.\nWhoever did it writes well. I am very fortunate,\" added he, looking\ngratefully at Villefort, \"to be examined by such a man as you; for this\nenvious person is a real enemy.\" And by the rapid glance that the young\nman's eyes shot forth, Villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath\nthis mildness.\n\n\"Now,\" said the deputy, \"answer me frankly, not as a prisoner to a\njudge, but as one man to another who takes an interest in him, what\ntruth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter?\"\nAnd Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter Dantes had just\ngiven back to him.\n\n\"None at all. I will tell you the real facts. I swear by my honor as a\nsailor, by my love for Mercedes, by the life of my father\"--\n\n\"Speak, monsieur,\" said Villefort. Then, internally, \"If Renee could\nsee me, I hope she would be satisfied, and would no longer call me a\ndecapitator.\"\n\n\"Well, when we quitted Naples, Captain Leclere was attacked with a brain\nfever. As we had no doctor on board, and he was so anxious to arrive at\nElba, that he would not touch at any other port, his disorder rose to\nsuch a height, that at the end of the third day, feeling he was dying,\nhe called me to him. 'My dear Dantes,' said he, 'swear to perform what I\nam going to tell you, for it is a matter of the deepest importance.'\n\n\"'I swear, captain,' replied I.\n\n\"'Well, as after my death the command devolves on you as mate,\nassume the command, and bear up for the Island of Elba, disembark at\nPorto-Ferrajo, ask for the grand-marshal, give him this letter--perhaps\nthey will give you another letter, and charge you with a commission. You\nwill accomplish what I was to have done, and derive all the honor and\nprofit from it.'\n\n\"'I will do it, captain; but perhaps I shall not be admitted to the\ngrand marshal's presence as easily as you expect?'\n\n\"'Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him, and remove every\ndifficulty,' said the captain. At these words he gave me a ring. It was\ntime--two hours after he was delirious; the next day he died.\"\n\n\"And what did you do then?\"\n\n\"What I ought to have done, and what every one would have done in my\nplace. Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred; but with\na sailor the last requests of his superior are commands. I sailed for\nthe Island of Elba, where I arrived the next day; I ordered everybody\nto remain on board, and went on shore alone. As I had expected, I found\nsome difficulty in obtaining access to the grand-marshal; but I sent the\nring I had received from the captain to him, and was instantly admitted.\nHe questioned me concerning Captain Leclere's death; and, as the latter\nhad told me, gave me a letter to carry on to a person in Paris. I\nundertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do. I landed\nhere, regulated the affairs of the vessel, and hastened to visit my\naffianced bride, whom I found more lovely than ever. Thanks to M.\nMorrel, all the forms were got over; in a word I was, as I told you,\nat my marriage-feast; and I should have been married in an hour, and\nto-morrow I intended to start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this\ncharge which you as well as I now see to be unjust.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Villefort, \"this seems to me the truth. If you have been\nculpable, it was imprudence, and this imprudence was in obedience to the\norders of your captain. Give up this letter you have brought from Elba,\nand pass your word you will appear should you be required, and go and\nrejoin your friends.\n\n\"I am free, then, sir?\" cried Dantes joyfully.\n\n\"Yes; but first give me this letter.\"\n\n\"You have it already, for it was taken from me with some others which I\nsee in that packet.\"\n\n\"Stop a moment,\" said the deputy, as Dantes took his hat and gloves. \"To\nwhom is it addressed?\"\n\n\"To Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-Heron, Paris.\" Had a thunderbolt fallen\ninto the room, Villefort could not have been more stupefied. He sank\ninto his seat, and hastily turning over the packet, drew forth the fatal\nletter, at which he glanced with an expression of terror.\n\n\"M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Heron, No. 13,\" murmured he, growing still paler.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dantes; \"do you know him?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Villefort; \"a faithful servant of the king does not know\nconspirators.\"\n\n\"It is a conspiracy, then?\" asked Dantes, who after believing himself\nfree, now began to feel a tenfold alarm. \"I have, however, already told\nyou, sir, I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter.\"\n\n\"Yes; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed,\"\nsaid Villefort.\n\n\"I was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it.\"\n\n\"Have you shown this letter to any one?\" asked Villefort, becoming still\nmore pale.\n\n\"To no one, on my honor.\"\n\n\"Everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the\nIsland of Elba, and addressed to M. Noirtier?\"\n\n\"Everybody, except the person who gave it to me.\"\n\n\"And that was too much, far too much,\" murmured Villefort. Villefort's\nbrow darkened more and more, his white lips and clinched teeth filled\nDantes with apprehension. After reading the letter, Villefort covered\nhis face with his hands.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Dantes timidly, \"what is the matter?\" Villefort made no\nanswer, but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds, and\nagain perused the letter.\n\n\"And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?\"\n\n\"I give you my word of honor, sir,\" said Dantes; \"but what is the\nmatter? You are ill--shall I ring for assistance?--shall I call?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Villefort, rising hastily; \"stay where you are. It is for me\nto give orders here, and not you.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied Dantes proudly, \"it was only to summon assistance\nfor you.\"\n\n\"I want none; it was a temporary indisposition. Attend to yourself;\nanswer me.\" Dantes waited, expecting a question, but in vain. Villefort\nfell back on his chair, passed his hand over his brow, moist with\nperspiration, and, for the third time, read the letter.\n\n\"Oh, if he knows the contents of this!\" murmured he, \"and that Noirtier\nis the father of Villefort, I am lost!\" And he fixed his eyes upon\nEdmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts.\n\n\"Oh, it is impossible to doubt it,\" cried he, suddenly.\n\n\"In heaven's name!\" cried the unhappy young man, \"if you doubt me,\nquestion me; I will answer you.\" Villefort made a violent effort, and in\na tone he strove to render firm,--\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"I am no longer able, as I had hoped, to restore you\nimmediately to liberty; before doing so, I must consult the trial\njustice; what my own feeling is you already know.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur,\" cried Dantes, \"you have been rather a friend than a\njudge.\"\n\n\"Well, I must detain you some time longer, but I will strive to make it\nas short as possible. The principal charge against you is this letter,\nand you see\"--Villefort approached the fire, cast it in, and waited\nuntil it was entirely consumed.\n\n\"You see, I destroy it?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed Dantes, \"you are goodness itself.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" continued Villefort; \"you can now have confidence in me after\nwhat I have done.\"\n\n\"Oh, command, and I will obey.\"\n\n\"Listen; this is not a command, but advice I give you.\"\n\n\"Speak, and I will follow your advice.\"\n\n\"I shall detain you until this evening in the Palais de Justice. Should\nany one else interrogate you, say to him what you have said to me, but\ndo not breathe a word of this letter.\"\n\n\"I promise.\" It was Villefort who seemed to entreat, and the prisoner\nwho reassured him.\n\n\"You see,\" continued he, glancing toward the grate, where fragments of\nburnt paper fluttered in the flames, \"the letter is destroyed; you and I\nalone know of its existence; should you, therefore, be questioned, deny\nall knowledge of it--deny it boldly, and you are saved.\"\n\n\"Be satisfied; I will deny it.\"\n\n\"It was the only letter you had?\"\n\n\"It was.\"\n\n\"Swear it.\"\n\n\"I swear it.\"\n\nVillefort rang. A police agent entered. Villefort whispered some words\nin his ear, to which the officer replied by a motion of his head.\n\n\"Follow him,\" said Villefort to Dantes. Dantes saluted Villefort\nand retired. Hardly had the door closed when Villefort threw himself\nhalf-fainting into a chair.\n\n\"Alas, alas,\" murmured he, \"if the procureur himself had been at\nMarseilles I should have been ruined. This accursed letter would have\ndestroyed all my hopes. Oh, my father, must your past career always\ninterfere with my successes?\" Suddenly a light passed over his face,\na smile played round his set mouth, and his haggard eyes were fixed in\nthought.\n\n\"This will do,\" said he, \"and from this letter, which might have ruined\nme, I will make my fortune. Now to the work I have in hand.\" And after\nhaving assured himself that the prisoner was gone, the deputy procureur\nhastened to the house of his betrothed.\n\n\n\nChapter 8. The Chateau D'If.\n\nThe commissary of police, as he traversed the ante-chamber, made a sign\nto two gendarmes, who placed themselves one on Dantes' right and the\nother on his left. A door that communicated with the Palais de Justice\nwas opened, and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors,\nwhose appearance might have made even the boldest shudder. The Palais de\nJustice communicated with the prison,--a sombre edifice, that from\nits grated windows looks on the clock-tower of the Accoules. After\nnumberless windings, Dantes saw a door with an iron wicket. The\ncommissary took up an iron mallet and knocked thrice, every blow seeming\nto Dantes as if struck on his heart. The door opened, the two gendarmes\ngently pushed him forward, and the door closed with a loud sound behind\nhim. The air he inhaled was no longer pure, but thick and mephitic,--he\nwas in prison. He was conducted to a tolerably neat chamber, but grated\nand barred, and its appearance, therefore, did not greatly alarm him;\nbesides, the words of Villefort, who seemed to interest himself so\nmuch, resounded still in his ears like a promise of freedom. It was four\no'clock when Dantes was placed in this chamber. It was, as we have said,\nthe 1st of March, and the prisoner was soon buried in darkness. The\nobscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing; at the slightest sound\nhe rose and hastened to the door, convinced they were about to liberate\nhim, but the sound died away, and Dantes sank again into his seat. At\nlast, about ten o'clock, and just as Dantes began to despair, steps were\nheard in the corridor, a key turned in the lock, the bolts creaked,\nthe massy oaken door flew open, and a flood of light from two torches\npervaded the apartment. By the torchlight Dantes saw the glittering\nsabres and carbines of four gendarmes. He had advanced at first, but\nstopped at the sight of this display of force.\n\n\"Are you come to fetch me?\" asked he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied a gendarme.\n\n\"By the orders of the deputy procureur?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\" The conviction that they came from M. de Villefort\nrelieved all Dantes' apprehensions; he advanced calmly, and placed\nhimself in the centre of the escort. A carriage waited at the door, the\ncoachman was on the box, and a police officer sat beside him.\n\n\"Is this carriage for me?\" said Dantes.\n\n\"It is for you,\" replied a gendarme.\n\nDantes was about to speak; but feeling himself urged forward, and having\nneither the power nor the intention to resist, he mounted the steps, and\nwas in an instant seated inside between two gendarmes; the two others\ntook their places opposite, and the carriage rolled heavily over the\nstones.\n\nThe prisoner glanced at the windows--they were grated; he had changed\nhis prison for another that was conveying him he knew not whither.\nThrough the grating, however, Dantes saw they were passing through the\nRue Caisserie, and by the Rue Saint-Laurent and the Rue Taramis, to the\nport. Soon he saw the lights of La Consigne.\n\nThe carriage stopped, the officer descended, approached the guardhouse,\na dozen soldiers came out and formed themselves in order; Dantes saw the\nreflection of their muskets by the light of the lamps on the quay.\n\n\"Can all this force be summoned on my account?\" thought he.\n\nThe officer opened the door, which was locked, and, without speaking\na word, answered Dantes' question; for he saw between the ranks of\nthe soldiers a passage formed from the carriage to the port. The two\ngendarmes who were opposite to him descended first, then he was ordered\nto alight and the gendarmes on each side of him followed his example.\nThey advanced towards a boat, which a custom-house officer held by a\nchain, near the quay.\n\nThe soldiers looked at Dantes with an air of stupid curiosity. In an\ninstant he was placed in the stern-sheets of the boat, between the\ngendarmes, while the officer stationed himself at the bow; a shove sent\nthe boat adrift, and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the\nPilon. At a shout from the boat, the chain that closes the mouth of\nthe port was lowered and in a second they were, as Dantes knew, in the\nFrioul and outside the inner harbor.\n\nThe prisoner's first feeling was of joy at again breathing the pure\nair--for air is freedom; but he soon sighed, for he passed before La\nReserve, where he had that morning been so happy, and now through the\nopen windows came the laughter and revelry of a ball. Dantes folded his\nhands, raised his eyes to heaven, and prayed fervently.\n\nThe boat continued her voyage. They had passed the Tete de Morte,\nwere now off the Anse du Pharo, and about to double the battery. This\nmanoeuvre was incomprehensible to Dantes.\n\n\"Whither are you taking me?\" asked he.\n\n\"You will soon know.\"\n\n\"But still\"--\n\n\"We are forbidden to give you any explanation.\" Dantes, trained in\ndiscipline, knew that nothing would be more absurd than to question\nsubordinates, who were forbidden to reply; and so he remained silent.\n\nThe most vague and wild thoughts passed through his mind. The boat they\nwere in could not make a long voyage; there was no vessel at anchor\noutside the harbor; he thought, perhaps, they were going to leave him on\nsome distant point. He was not bound, nor had they made any attempt to\nhandcuff him; this seemed a good augury. Besides, had not the deputy,\nwho had been so kind to him, told him that provided he did not pronounce\nthe dreaded name of Noirtier, he had nothing to apprehend? Had not\nVillefort in his presence destroyed the fatal letter, the only proof\nagainst him?\n\nHe waited silently, striving to pierce through the darkness.\n\nThey had left the Ile Ratonneau, where the lighthouse stood, on the\nright, and were now opposite the Point des Catalans. It seemed to the\nprisoner that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach, for it\nwas there Mercedes dwelt. How was it that a presentiment did not warn\nMercedes that her lover was within three hundred yards of her?\n\nOne light alone was visible; and Dantes saw that it came from Mercedes'\nchamber. Mercedes was the only one awake in the whole settlement. A loud\ncry could be heard by her. But pride restrained him and he did not utter\nit. What would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman?\n\nHe remained silent, his eyes fixed upon the light; the boat went on, but\nthe prisoner thought only of Mercedes. An intervening elevation of land\nhid the light. Dantes turned and perceived that they had got out to sea.\nWhile he had been absorbed in thought, they had shipped their oars and\nhoisted sail; the boat was now moving with the wind.\n\nIn spite of his repugnance to address the guards, Dantes turned to the\nnearest gendarme, and taking his hand,--\n\n\"Comrade,\" said he, \"I adjure you, as a Christian and a soldier, to tell\nme where we are going. I am Captain Dantes, a loyal Frenchman, thought\naccused of treason; tell me where you are conducting me, and I promise\nyou on my honor I will submit to my fate.\"\n\nThe gendarme looked irresolutely at his companion, who returned for\nanswer a sign that said, \"I see no great harm in telling him now,\" and\nthe gendarme replied,--\n\n\"You are a native of Marseilles, and a sailor, and yet you do not know\nwhere you are going?\"\n\n\"On my honor, I have no idea.\"\n\n\"Have you no idea whatever?\"\n\n\"None at all.\"\n\n\"That is impossible.\"\n\n\"I swear to you it is true. Tell me, I entreat.\"\n\n\"But my orders.\"\n\n\"Your orders do not forbid your telling me what I must know in ten\nminutes, in half an hour, or an hour. You see I cannot escape, even if I\nintended.\"\n\n\"Unless you are blind, or have never been outside the harbor, you must\nknow.\"\n\n\"I do not.\"\n\n\"Look round you then.\" Dantes rose and looked forward, when he saw\nrise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning rock on which\nstands the Chateau d'If. This gloomy fortress, which has for more than\nthree hundred years furnished food for so many wild legends, seemed to\nDantes like a scaffold to a malefactor.\n\n\"The Chateau d'If?\" cried he, \"what are we going there for?\" The\ngendarme smiled.\n\n\"I am not going there to be imprisoned,\" said Dantes; \"it is only\nused for political prisoners. I have committed no crime. Are there any\nmagistrates or judges at the Chateau d'If?\"\n\n\"There are only,\" said the gendarme, \"a governor, a garrison, turnkeys,\nand good thick walls. Come, come, do not look so astonished, or you\nwill make me think you are laughing at me in return for my good nature.\"\nDantes pressed the gendarme's hand as though he would crush it.\n\n\"You think, then,\" said he, \"that I am taken to the Chateau d'If to be\nimprisoned there?\"\n\n\"It is probable; but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard.\"\n\n\"Without any inquiry, without any formality?\"\n\n\"All the formalities have been gone through; the inquiry is already\nmade.\"\n\n\"And so, in spite of M. de Villefort's promises?\"\n\n\"I do not know what M. de Villefort promised you,\" said the gendarme,\n\"but I know we are taking you to the Chateau d'If. But what are you\ndoing? Help, comrades, help!\"\n\nBy a rapid movement, which the gendarme's practiced eye had perceived,\nDantes sprang forward to precipitate himself into the sea; but four\nvigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat. He\nfell back cursing with rage.\n\n\"Good!\" said the gendarme, placing his knee on his chest; \"believe\nsoft-spoken gentlemen again! Harkye, my friend, I have disobeyed my\nfirst order, but I will not disobey the second; and if you move, I will\nblow your brains out.\" And he levelled his carbine at Dantes, who felt\nthe muzzle against his temple.\n\nFor a moment the idea of struggling crossed his mind, and of so ending\nthe unexpected evil that had overtaken him. But he bethought him of M.\nde Villefort's promise; and, besides, death in a boat from the hand of\na gendarme seemed too terrible. He remained motionless, but gnashing his\nteeth and wringing his hands with fury.\n\nAt this moment the boat came to a landing with a violent shock. One of\nthe sailors leaped on shore, a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley,\nand Dantes guessed they were at the end of the voyage, and that they\nwere mooring the boat.\n\nHis guards, taking him by the arms and coat-collar, forced him to rise,\nand dragged him towards the steps that lead to the gate of the fortress,\nwhile the police officer carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed\nbehind.\n\nDantes made no resistance; he was like a man in a dream: he saw soldiers\ndrawn up on the embankment; he knew vaguely that he was ascending a\nflight of steps; he was conscious that he passed through a door, and\nthat the door closed behind him; but all this indistinctly as through\na mist. He did not even see the ocean, that terrible barrier against\nfreedom, which the prisoners look upon with utter despair.\n\nThey halted for a minute, during which he strove to collect his\nthoughts. He looked around; he was in a court surrounded by high walls;\nhe heard the measured tread of sentinels, and as they passed before the\nlight he saw the barrels of their muskets shine.\n\nThey waited upwards of ten minutes. Certain Dantes could not escape, the\ngendarmes released him. They seemed awaiting orders. The orders came.\n\n\"Where is the prisoner?\" said a voice.\n\n\"Here,\" replied the gendarmes.\n\n\"Let him follow me; I will take him to his cell.\"\n\n\"Go!\" said the gendarmes, thrusting Dantes forward.\n\nThe prisoner followed his guide, who led him into a room almost under\nground, whose bare and reeking walls seemed as though impregnated with\ntears; a lamp placed on a stool illumined the apartment faintly,\nand showed Dantes the features of his conductor, an under-jailer,\nill-clothed, and of sullen appearance.\n\n\"Here is your chamber for to-night,\" said he. \"It is late, and the\ngovernor is asleep. To-morrow, perhaps, he may change you. In the\nmeantime there is bread, water, and fresh straw; and that is all a\nprisoner can wish for. Goodnight.\" And before Dantes could open his\nmouth--before he had noticed where the jailer placed his bread or the\nwater--before he had glanced towards the corner where the straw was,\nthe jailer disappeared, taking with him the lamp and closing the door,\nleaving stamped upon the prisoner's mind the dim reflection of the\ndripping walls of his dungeon.\n\nDantes was alone in darkness and in silence--cold as the shadows that\nhe felt breathe on his burning forehead. With the first dawn of day the\njailer returned, with orders to leave Dantes where he was. He found the\nprisoner in the same position, as if fixed there, his eyes swollen with\nweeping. He had passed the night standing, and without sleep. The jailer\nadvanced; Dantes appeared not to perceive him. He touched him on the\nshoulder. Edmond started.\n\n\"Have you not slept?\" said the jailer.\n\n\"I do not know,\" replied Dantes. The jailer stared.\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" continued he.\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Do you wish for anything?\"\n\n\"I wish to see the governor.\" The jailer shrugged his shoulders and left\nthe chamber.\n\nDantes followed him with his eyes, and stretched forth his hands towards\nthe open door; but the door closed. All his emotion then burst forth;\nhe cast himself on the ground, weeping bitterly, and asking himself what\ncrime he had committed that he was thus punished.\n\nThe day passed thus; he scarcely tasted food, but walked round and\nround the cell like a wild beast in its cage. One thought in particular\ntormented him: namely, that during his journey hither he had sat so\nstill, whereas he might, a dozen times, have plunged into the sea, and,\nthanks to his powers of swimming, for which he was famous, have gained\nthe shore, concealed himself until the arrival of a Genoese or Spanish\nvessel, escaped to Spain or Italy, where Mercedes and his father could\nhave joined him. He had no fears as to how he should live--good seamen\nare welcome everywhere. He spoke Italian like a Tuscan, and Spanish like\na Castilian; he would have been free, and happy with Mercedes and\nhis father, whereas he was now confined in the Chateau d'If, that\nimpregnable fortress, ignorant of the future destiny of his father and\nMercedes; and all this because he had trusted to Villefort's promise.\nThe thought was maddening, and Dantes threw himself furiously down on\nhis straw. The next morning at the same hour, the jailer came again.\n\n\"Well,\" said the jailer, \"are you more reasonable to-day?\" Dantes made\nno reply.\n\n\"Come, cheer up; is there anything that I can do for you?\"\n\n\"I wish to see the governor.\"\n\n\"I have already told you it was impossible.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because it is against prison rules, and prisoners must not even ask for\nit.\"\n\n\"What is allowed, then?\"\n\n\"Better fare, if you pay for it, books, and leave to walk about.\"\n\n\"I do not want books, I am satisfied with my food, and do not care to\nwalk about; but I wish to see the governor.\"\n\n\"If you worry me by repeating the same thing, I will not bring you any\nmore to eat.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Edmond, \"if you do not, I shall die of hunger--that\nis all.\"\n\nThe jailer saw by his tone he would be happy to die; and as every\nprisoner is worth ten sous a day to his jailer, he replied in a more\nsubdued tone.\n\n\"What you ask is impossible; but if you are very well behaved you will\nbe allowed to walk about, and some day you will meet the governor, and\nif he chooses to reply, that is his affair.\"\n\n\"But,\" asked Dantes, \"how long shall I have to wait?\"\n\n\"Ah, a month--six months--a year.\"\n\n\"It is too long a time. I wish to see him at once.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the jailer, \"do not always brood over what is impossible, or\nyou will be mad in a fortnight.\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"Yes; we have an instance here; it was by always offering a million of\nfrancs to the governor for his liberty that an abbe became mad, who was\nin this chamber before you.\"\n\n\"How long has he left it?\"\n\n\"Two years.\"\n\n\"Was he liberated, then?\"\n\n\"No; he was put in a dungeon.\"\n\n\"Listen!\" said Dantes. \"I am not an abbe, I am not mad; perhaps I shall\nbe, but at present, unfortunately, I am not. I will make you another\noffer.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"I do not offer you a million, because I have it not; but I will give\nyou a hundred crowns if, the first time you go to Marseilles, you will\nseek out a young girl named Mercedes, at the Catalans, and give her two\nlines from me.\"\n\n\"If I took them, and were detected, I should lose my place, which is\nworth two thousand francs a year; so that I should be a great fool to\nrun such a risk for three hundred.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Dantes, \"mark this; if you refuse at least to tell Mercedes\nI am here, I will some day hide myself behind the door, and when you\nenter I will dash out your brains with this stool.\"\n\n\"Threats!\" cried the jailer, retreating and putting himself on the\ndefensive; \"you are certainly going mad. The abbe began like you, and in\nthree days you will be like him, mad enough to tie up; but, fortunately,\nthere are dungeons here.\" Dantes whirled the stool round his head.\n\n\"All right, all right,\" said the jailer; \"all right, since you will have\nit so. I will send word to the governor.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" returned Dantes, dropping the stool and sitting on it as if\nhe were in reality mad. The jailer went out, and returned in an instant\nwith a corporal and four soldiers.\n\n\"By the governor's orders,\" said he, \"conduct the prisoner to the tier\nbeneath.\"\n\n\"To the dungeon, then,\" said the corporal.\n\n\"Yes; we must put the madman with the madmen.\" The soldiers seized\nDantes, who followed passively.\n\nHe descended fifteen steps, and the door of a dungeon was opened, and\nhe was thrust in. The door closed, and Dantes advanced with outstretched\nhands until he touched the wall; he then sat down in the corner until\nhis eyes became accustomed to the darkness. The jailer was right; Dantes\nwanted but little of being utterly mad.\n\n\n\nChapter 9. The Evening of the Betrothal.\n\nVillefort had, as we have said, hastened back to Madame de Saint-Meran's\nin the Place du Grand Cours, and on entering the house found that the\nguests whom he had left at table were taking coffee in the salon. Renee\nwas, with all the rest of the company, anxiously awaiting him, and his\nentrance was followed by a general exclamation.\n\n\"Well, Decapitator, Guardian of the State, Royalist, Brutus, what is the\nmatter?\" said one. \"Speak out.\"\n\n\"Are we threatened with a fresh Reign of Terror?\" asked another.\n\n\"Has the Corsican ogre broken loose?\" cried a third.\n\n\"Marquise,\" said Villefort, approaching his future mother-in-law, \"I\nrequest your pardon for thus leaving you. Will the marquis honor me by a\nfew moments' private conversation?\"\n\n\"Ah, it is really a serious matter, then?\" asked the marquis, remarking\nthe cloud on Villefort's brow.\n\n\"So serious that I must take leave of you for a few days; so,\" added he,\nturning to Renee, \"judge for yourself if it be not important.\"\n\n\"You are going to leave us?\" cried Renee, unable to hide her emotion at\nthis unexpected announcement.\n\n\"Alas,\" returned Villefort, \"I must!\"\n\n\"Where, then, are you going?\" asked the marquise.\n\n\"That, madame, is an official secret; but if you have any commissions\nfor Paris, a friend of mine is going there to-night, and will with\npleasure undertake them.\" The guests looked at each other.\n\n\"You wish to speak to me alone?\" said the marquis.\n\n\"Yes, let us go to the library, please.\" The marquis took his arm, and\nthey left the salon.\n\n\"Well,\" asked he, as soon as they were by themselves, \"tell me what it\nis?\"\n\n\"An affair of the greatest importance, that demands my immediate\npresence in Paris. Now, excuse the indiscretion, marquis, but have you\nany landed property?\"\n\n\"All my fortune is in the funds; seven or eight hundred thousand\nfrancs.\"\n\n\"Then sell out--sell out, marquis, or you will lose it all.\"\n\n\"But how can I sell out here?\"\n\n\"You have a broker, have you not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then give me a letter to him, and tell him to sell out without an\ninstant's delay, perhaps even now I shall arrive too late.\"\n\n\"The deuce you say!\" replied the marquis, \"let us lose no time, then!\"\n\nAnd, sitting down, he wrote a letter to his broker, ordering him to sell\nout at the market price.\n\n\"Now, then,\" said Villefort, placing the letter in his pocketbook, \"I\nmust have another!\"\n\n\"To whom?\"\n\n\"To the king.\"\n\n\"To the king?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I dare not write to his majesty.\"\n\n\"I do not ask you to write to his majesty, but ask M. de Salvieux to\ndo so. I want a letter that will enable me to reach the king's presence\nwithout all the formalities of demanding an audience; that would\noccasion a loss of precious time.\"\n\n\"But address yourself to the keeper of the seals; he has the right of\nentry at the Tuileries, and can procure you audience at any hour of the\nday or night.\"\n\n\"Doubtless; but there is no occasion to divide the honors of my\ndiscovery with him. The keeper would leave me in the background, and\ntake all the glory to himself. I tell you, marquis, my fortune is made\nif I only reach the Tuileries the first, for the king will not forget\nthe service I do him.\"\n\n\"In that case go and get ready. I will call Salvieux and make him write\nthe letter.\"\n\n\"Be as quick as possible, I must be on the road in a quarter of an\nhour.\"\n\n\"Tell your coachman to stop at the door.\"\n\n\"You will present my excuses to the marquise and Mademoiselle Renee,\nwhom I leave on such a day with great regret.\"\n\n\"You will find them both here, and can make your farewells in person.\"\n\n\"A thousand thanks--and now for the letter.\"\n\nThe marquis rang, a servant entered.\n\n\"Say to the Comte de Salvieux that I would like to see him.\"\n\n\"Now, then, go,\" said the marquis.\n\n\"I shall be gone only a few moments.\"\n\nVillefort hastily quitted the apartment, but reflecting that the sight\nof the deputy procureur running through the streets would be enough to\nthrow the whole city into confusion, he resumed his ordinary pace. At\nhis door he perceived a figure in the shadow that seemed to wait for\nhim. It was Mercedes, who, hearing no news of her lover, had come\nunobserved to inquire after him.\n\nAs Villefort drew near, she advanced and stood before him. Dantes had\nspoken of Mercedes, and Villefort instantly recognized her. Her beauty\nand high bearing surprised him, and when she inquired what had become of\nher lover, it seemed to him that she was the judge, and he the accused.\n\n\"The young man you speak of,\" said Villefort abruptly, \"is a great\ncriminal, and I can do nothing for him, mademoiselle.\" Mercedes burst\ninto tears, and, as Villefort strove to pass her, again addressed him.\n\n\"But, at least, tell me where he is, that I may know whether he is alive\nor dead,\" said she.\n\n\"I do not know; he is no longer in my hands,\" replied Villefort.\n\nAnd desirous of putting an end to the interview, he pushed by her, and\nclosed the door, as if to exclude the pain he felt. But remorse is not\nthus banished; like Virgil's wounded hero, he carried the arrow in his\nwound, and, arrived at the salon, Villefort uttered a sigh that was\nalmost a sob, and sank into a chair.\n\nThen the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his heart. The\nman he sacrificed to his ambition, that innocent victim immolated on\nthe altar of his father's faults, appeared to him pale and threatening,\nleading his affianced bride by the hand, and bringing with him remorse,\nnot such as the ancients figured, furious and terrible, but that slow\nand consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from hour to hour up\nto the very moment of death. Then he had a moment's hesitation. He had\nfrequently called for capital punishment on criminals, and owing to his\nirresistible eloquence they had been condemned, and yet the slightest\nshadow of remorse had never clouded Villefort's brow, because they were\nguilty; at least, he believed so; but here was an innocent man whose\nhappiness he had destroyed: in this case he was not the judge, but the\nexecutioner.\n\nAs he thus reflected, he felt the sensation we have described, and which\nhad hitherto been unknown to him, arise in his bosom, and fill him\nwith vague apprehensions. It is thus that a wounded man trembles\ninstinctively at the approach of the finger to his wound until it be\nhealed, but Villefort's was one of those that never close, or if they\ndo, only close to reopen more agonizing than ever. If at this moment the\nsweet voice of Renee had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy, or the\nfair Mercedes had entered and said, \"In the name of God, I conjure you\nto restore me my affianced husband,\" his cold and trembling hands\nwould have signed his release; but no voice broke the stillness of the\nchamber, and the door was opened only by Villefort's valet, who came to\ntell him that the travelling carriage was in readiness.\n\nVillefort rose, or rather sprang, from his chair, hastily opened one\nof the drawers of his desk, emptied all the gold it contained into\nhis pocket, stood motionless an instant, his hand pressed to his head,\nmuttered a few inarticulate sounds, and then, perceiving that his\nservant had placed his cloak on his shoulders, he sprang into the\ncarriage, ordering the postilions to drive to M. de Saint-Meran's. The\nhapless Dantes was doomed.\n\nAs the marquis had promised, Villefort found the marquise and Renee\nin waiting. He started when he saw Renee, for he fancied she was again\nabout to plead for Dantes. Alas, her emotions were wholly personal: she\nwas thinking only of Villefort's departure.\n\nShe loved Villefort, and he left her at the moment he was about to\nbecome her husband. Villefort knew not when he should return, and Renee,\nfar from pleading for Dantes, hated the man whose crime separated her\nfrom her lover.\n\nMeanwhile what of Mercedes? She had met Fernand at the corner of the Rue\nde la Loge; she had returned to the Catalans, and had despairingly cast\nherself on her couch. Fernand, kneeling by her side, took her hand, and\ncovered it with kisses that Mercedes did not even feel. She passed the\nnight thus. The lamp went out for want of oil, but she paid no heed to\nthe darkness, and dawn came, but she knew not that it was day. Grief had\nmade her blind to all but one object--that was Edmond.\n\n\"Ah, you are there,\" said she, at length, turning towards Fernand.\n\n\"I have not quitted you since yesterday,\" returned Fernand sorrowfully.\n\nM. Morrel had not readily given up the fight. He had learned that Dantes\nhad been taken to prison, and he had gone to all his friends, and\nthe influential persons of the city; but the report was already in\ncirculation that Dantes was arrested as a Bonapartist agent; and as the\nmost sanguine looked upon any attempt of Napoleon to remount the throne\nas impossible, he met with nothing but refusal, and had returned home\nin despair, declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more\ncould be done.\n\nCaderousse was equally restless and uneasy, but instead of seeking, like\nM. Morrel, to aid Dantes, he had shut himself up with two bottles of\nblack currant brandy, in the hope of drowning reflection. But he did not\nsucceed, and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink, and yet not\nso intoxicated as to forget what had happened. With his elbows on the\ntable he sat between the two empty bottles, while spectres danced in the\nlight of the unsnuffed candle--spectres such as Hoffmann strews over his\npunch-drenched pages, like black, fantastic dust.\n\nDanglars alone was content and joyous--he had got rid of an enemy and\nmade his own situation on the Pharaon secure. Danglars was one of those\nmen born with a pen behind the ear, and an inkstand in place of a heart.\nEverything with him was multiplication or subtraction. The life of a man\nwas to him of far less value than a numeral, especially when, by taking\nit away, he could increase the sum total of his own desires. He went to\nbed at his usual hour, and slept in peace.\n\nVillefort, after having received M. de Salvieux' letter, embraced Renee,\nkissed the marquise's hand, and shaken that of the marquis, started for\nParis along the Aix road.\n\nOld Dantes was dying with anxiety to know what had become of Edmond. But\nwe know very well what had become of Edmond.\n\n\n\nChapter 10. The King's Closet at the Tuileries.\n\nWe will leave Villefort on the road to Paris, travelling--thanks\nto trebled fees--with all speed, and passing through two or three\napartments, enter at the Tuileries the little room with the arched\nwindow, so well known as having been the favorite closet of Napoleon and\nLouis XVIII., and now of Louis Philippe.\n\nThere, seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from\nHartwell, and to which, from one of those fancies not uncommon to\ngreat people, he was particularly attached, the king, Louis XVIII., was\ncarelessly listening to a man of fifty or fifty-two years of age, with\ngray hair, aristocratic bearing, and exceedingly gentlemanly attire,\nand meanwhile making a marginal note in a volume of Gryphius's rather\ninaccurate, but much sought-after, edition of Horace--a work which\nwas much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical\nmonarch.\n\n\"You say, sir\"--said the king.\n\n\"That I am exceedingly disquieted, sire.\"\n\n\"Really, have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean\nkine?\"\n\n\"No, sire, for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty and\nseven years of scarcity; and with a king as full of foresight as your\nmajesty, scarcity is not a thing to be feared.\"\n\n\"Then of what other scourge are you afraid, my dear Blacas?\"\n\n\"Sire, I have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the\nsouth.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear duke,\" replied Louis XVIII., \"I think you are wrongly\ninformed, and know positively that, on the contrary, it is very fine\nweather in that direction.\" Man of ability as he was, Louis XVIII. liked\na pleasant jest.\n\n\"Sire,\" continued M. de Blacas, \"if it only be to reassure a faithful\nservant, will your majesty send into Languedoc, Provence, and Dauphine,\ntrusty men, who will bring you back a faithful report as to the feeling\nin these three provinces?\"\n\n\"Caninus surdis,\" replied the king, continuing the annotations in his\nHorace.\n\n\"Sire,\" replied the courtier, laughing, in order that he might seem\nto comprehend the quotation, \"your majesty may be perfectly right in\nrelying on the good feeling of France, but I fear I am not altogether\nwrong in dreading some desperate attempt.\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"By Bonaparte, or, at least, by his adherents.\"\n\n\"My dear Blacas,\" said the king, \"you with your alarms prevent me from\nworking.\"\n\n\"And you, sire, prevent me from sleeping with your security.\"\n\n\"Wait, my dear sir, wait a moment; for I have such a delightful note on\nthe Pastor quum traheret--wait, and I will listen to you afterwards.\"\n\nThere was a brief pause, during which Louis XVIII. wrote, in a hand as\nsmall as possible, another note on the margin of his Horace, and then\nlooking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of\nhis own, while he is only commenting upon the idea of another, said,--\n\n\"Go on, my dear duke, go on--I listen.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Blacas, who had for a moment the hope of sacrificing\nVillefort to his own profit, \"I am compelled to tell you that these are\nnot mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me; but a\nserious-minded man, deserving all my confidence, and charged by me to\nwatch over the south\" (the duke hesitated as he pronounced these words),\n\"has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the king,\nand so I hastened to you, sire.\"\n\n\"Mala ducis avi domum,\" continued Louis XVIII., still annotating.\n\n\"Does your majesty wish me to drop the subject?\"\n\n\"By no means, my dear duke; but just stretch out your hand.\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"Whichever you please--there to the left.\"\n\n\"Here, sire?\"\n\n\"I tell you to the left, and you are looking to the right; I mean on my\nleft--yes, there. You will find yesterday's report of the minister of\npolice. But here is M. Dandre himself;\" and M. Dandre, announced by the\nchamberlain-in-waiting, entered.\n\n\"Come in,\" said Louis XVIII., with repressed smile, \"come in, Baron, and\ntell the duke all you know--the latest news of M. de Bonaparte; do not\nconceal anything, however serious,--let us see, the Island of Elba is a\nvolcano, and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and bristling\nwar--bella, horrida bella.\" M. Dandre leaned very respectfully on the\nback of a chair with his two hands, and said,--\n\n\"Has your majesty perused yesterday's report?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; but tell the duke himself, who cannot find anything, what the\nreport contains--give him the particulars of what the usurper is doing\nin his islet.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the baron to the duke, \"all the servants of his majesty\nmust approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the Island\nof Elba. Bonaparte\"--M. Dandre looked at Louis XVIII., who, employed in\nwriting a note, did not even raise his head. \"Bonaparte,\" continued\nthe baron, \"is mortally wearied, and passes whole days in watching his\nminers at work at Porto-Longone.\"\n\n\"And scratches himself for amusement,\" added the king.\n\n\"Scratches himself?\" inquired the duke, \"what does your majesty mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, my dear duke. Did you forget that this great man, this\nhero, this demigod, is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries\nhim to death, prurigo?\"\n\n\"And, moreover, my dear duke,\" continued the minister of police, \"we are\nalmost assured that, in a very short time, the usurper will be insane.\"\n\n\"Insane?\"\n\n\"Raving mad; his head becomes weaker. Sometimes he weeps bitterly,\nsometimes laughs boisterously, at other time he passes hours on\nthe seashore, flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes\n'duck-and-drake' five or six times, he appears as delighted as if he had\ngained another Marengo or Austerlitz. Now, you must agree that these are\nindubitable symptoms of insanity.\"\n\n\"Or of wisdom, my dear baron--or of wisdom,\" said Louis XVIII.,\nlaughing; \"the greatest captains of antiquity amused themselves\nby casting pebbles into the ocean--see Plutarch's life of Scipio\nAfricanus.\"\n\nM. de Blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the\ntruthful minister. Villefort, who did not choose to reveal the whole\nsecret, lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure, had\nyet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness.\n\n\"Well, well, Dandre,\" said Louis XVIII., \"Blacas is not yet convinced;\nlet us proceed, therefore, to the usurper's conversion.\" The minister of\npolice bowed.\n\n\"The usurper's conversion!\" murmured the duke, looking at the king and\nDandre, who spoke alternately, like Virgil's shepherds. \"The usurper\nconverted!\"\n\n\"Decidedly, my dear duke.\"\n\n\"In what way converted?\"\n\n\"To good principles. Tell him all about it, baron.\"\n\n\"Why, this is the way of it,\" said the minister, with the gravest air in\nthe world: \"Napoleon lately had a review, and as two or three of his\nold veterans expressed a desire to return to France, he gave them their\ndismissal, and exhorted them to 'serve the good king.' These were his\nown words, of that I am certain.\"\n\n\"Well, Blacas, what think you of this?\" inquired the king triumphantly,\nand pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast before him.\n\n\"I say, sire, that the minister of police is greatly deceived or I am;\nand as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the\nguardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty, it is probable\nthat I am in error. However, sire, if I might advise, your majesty will\ninterrogate the person of whom I spoke to you, and I will urge your\nmajesty to do him this honor.\"\n\n\"Most willingly, duke; under your auspices I will receive any person you\nplease, but you must not expect me to be too confiding. Baron, have you\nany report more recent than this dated the 20th February.--this is the\n4th of March?\"\n\n\"No, sire, but I am hourly expecting one; it may have arrived since I\nleft my office.\"\n\n\"Go thither, and if there be none--well, well,\" continued Louis XVIII.,\n\"make one; that is the usual way, is it not?\" and the king laughed\nfacetiously.\n\n\"Oh, sire,\" replied the minister, \"we have no occasion to invent any;\nevery day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations,\ncoming from hosts of people who hope for some return for services which\nthey seek to render, but cannot; they trust to fortune, and rely upon\nsome unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, go\"; said Louis XVIII., \"and remember that I am waiting for\nyou.\"\n\n\"I will but go and return, sire; I shall be back in ten minutes.\"\n\n\"And I, sire,\" said M. de Blacas, \"will go and find my messenger.\"\n\n\"Wait, sir, wait,\" said Louis XVIII. \"Really, M. de Blacas, I\nmust change your armorial bearings; I will give you an eagle with\noutstretched wings, holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to\nescape, and bearing this device--Tenax.\"\n\n\"Sire, I listen,\" said De Blacas, biting his nails with impatience.\n\n\"I wish to consult you on this passage, 'Molli fugiens anhelitu,' you\nknow it refers to a stag flying from a wolf. Are you not a sportsman\nand a great wolf-hunter? Well, then, what do you think of the molli\nanhelitu?\"\n\n\"Admirable, sire; but my messenger is like the stag you refer to, for he\nhas posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days.\"\n\n\"Which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety, my dear duke, when we\nhave a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours, and\nthat without getting in the least out of breath.\"\n\n\"Ah, sire, you recompense but badly this poor young man, who has come so\nfar, and with so much ardor, to give your majesty useful information. If\nonly for the sake of M. de Salvieux, who recommends him to me, I entreat\nyour majesty to receive him graciously.\"\n\n\"M. de Salvieux, my brother's chamberlain?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"He is at Marseilles.\"\n\n\"And writes me thence.\"\n\n\"Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?\"\n\n\"No; but strongly recommends M. de Villefort, and begs me to present him\nto your majesty.\"\n\n\"M. de Villefort!\" cried the king, \"is the messenger's name M. de\nVillefort?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"And he comes from Marseilles?\"\n\n\"In person.\"\n\n\"Why did you not mention his name at once?\" replied the king, betraying\nsome uneasiness.\n\n\"Sire, I thought his name was unknown to your majesty.\"\n\n\"No, no, Blacas; he is a man of strong and elevated understanding,\nambitious, too, and, pardieu, you know his father's name!\"\n\n\"His father?\"\n\n\"Yes, Noirtier.\"\n\n\"Noirtier the Girondin?--Noirtier the senator?\"\n\n\"He himself.\"\n\n\"And your majesty has employed the son of such a man?\"\n\n\"Blacas, my friend, you have but limited comprehension. I told you\nVillefort was ambitious, and to attain this ambition Villefort would\nsacrifice everything, even his father.\"\n\n\"Then, sire, may I present him?\"\n\n\"This instant, duke! Where is he?\"\n\n\"Waiting below, in my carriage.\"\n\n\"Seek him at once.\"\n\n\"I hasten to do so.\" The duke left the royal presence with the speed of\na young man; his really sincere royalism made him youthful again. Louis\nXVIII. remained alone, and turning his eyes on his half-opened Horace,\nmuttered,--\n\n\"Justum et tenacem propositi virum.\"\n\nM. de Blacas returned as speedily as he had departed, but in the\nante-chamber he was forced to appeal to the king's authority.\nVillefort's dusty garb, his costume, which was not of courtly cut,\nexcited the susceptibility of M. de Breze, who was all astonishment at\nfinding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king\nin such attire. The duke, however, overcame all difficulties with a\nword--his majesty's order; and, in spite of the protestations which the\nmaster of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles,\nVillefort was introduced.\n\nThe king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him. On\nopening the door, Villefort found himself facing him, and the young\nmagistrate's first impulse was to pause.\n\n\"Come in, M. de Villefort,\" said the king, \"come in.\" Villefort bowed,\nand advancing a few steps, waited until the king should interrogate him.\n\n\"M. de Villefort,\" said Louis XVIII., \"the Duc de Blacas assures me you\nhave some interesting information to communicate.\"\n\n\"Sire, the duke is right, and I believe your majesty will think it\nequally important.\"\n\n\"In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as bad\nin your opinion as I am asked to believe?\"\n\n\"Sire, I believe it to be most urgent, but I hope, by the speed I have\nused, that it is not irreparable.\"\n\n\"Speak as fully as you please, sir,\" said the king, who began to give\nway to the emotion which had showed itself in Blacas's face and affected\nVillefort's voice. \"Speak, sir, and pray begin at the beginning; I like\norder in everything.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Villefort, \"I will render a faithful report to your\nmajesty, but I must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some\nobscurity in my language.\" A glance at the king after this discreet\nand subtle exordium, assured Villefort of the benignity of his august\nauditor, and he went on:--\n\n\"Sire, I have come as rapidly to Paris as possible, to inform your\nmajesty that I have discovered, in the exercise of my duties, not a\ncommonplace and insignificant plot, such as is every day got up in the\nlower ranks of the people and in the army, but an actual conspiracy--a\nstorm which menaces no less than your majesty's throne. Sire, the\nusurper is arming three ships, he meditates some project, which, however\nmad, is yet, perhaps, terrible. At this moment he will have left Elba,\nto go whither I know not, but assuredly to attempt a landing either at\nNaples, or on the coast of Tuscany, or perhaps on the shores of France.\nYour majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island of Elba has\nmaintained his relations with Italy and France?\"\n\n\"I am, sir,\" said the king, much agitated; \"and recently we have had\ninformation that the Bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the Rue\nSaint-Jacques. But proceed, I beg of you. How did you obtain these\ndetails?\"\n\n\"Sire, they are the results of an examination which I have made of a man\nof Marseilles, whom I have watched for some time, and arrested on the\nday of my departure. This person, a sailor, of turbulent character,\nand whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island\nof Elba. There he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral\nmessage to a Bonapartist in Paris, whose name I could not extract from\nhim; but this mission was to prepare men's minds for a return (it is the\nman who says this, sire)--a return which will soon occur.\"\n\n\"And where is this man?\"\n\n\"In prison, sire.\"\n\n\"And the matter seems serious to you?\"\n\n\"So serious, sire, that when the circumstance surprised me in the midst\nof a family festival, on the very day of my betrothal, I left my bride\nand friends, postponing everything, that I might hasten to lay at your\nmajesty's feet the fears which impressed me, and the assurance of my\ndevotion.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Louis XVIII., \"was there not a marriage engagement between\nyou and Mademoiselle de Saint-Meran?\"\n\n\"Daughter of one of your majesty's most faithful servants.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, M. de Villefort.\"\n\n\"Sire, I fear it is more than a plot; I fear it is a conspiracy.\"\n\n\"A conspiracy in these times,\" said Louis XVIII., smiling, \"is a thing\nvery easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to an end, inasmuch\nas, re-established so recently on the throne of our ancestors, we have\nour eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and the future. For\nthe last ten months my ministers have redoubled their vigilance, in\norder to watch the shore of the Mediterranean. If Bonaparte landed at\nNaples, the whole coalition would be on foot before he could even reach\nPiomoino; if he land in Tuscany, he will be in an unfriendly territory;\nif he land in France, it must be with a handful of men, and the result\nof that is easily foretold, execrated as he is by the population. Take\ncourage, sir; but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude.\"\n\n\"Ah, here is M. Dandre!\" cried de Blacas. At this instant the minister\nof police appeared at the door, pale, trembling, and as if ready to\nfaint. Villefort was about to retire, but M. de Blacas, taking his hand,\nrestrained him.\n\n\n\nChapter 11. The Corsican Ogre.\n\nAt the sight of this agitation Louis XVIII. pushed from him violently\nthe table at which he was sitting.\n\n\"What ails you, baron?\" he exclaimed. \"You appear quite aghast. Has your\nuneasiness anything to do with what M. de Blacas has told me, and M. de\nVillefort has just confirmed?\" M. de Blacas moved suddenly towards the\nbaron, but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of\nthe statesman; and besides, as matters were, it was much more to his\nadvantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that\nhe should humiliate the prefect.\n\n\"Sire\"--stammered the baron.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" asked Louis XVIII. The minister of police, giving\nway to an impulse of despair, was about to throw himself at the feet of\nLouis XVIII., who retreated a step and frowned.\n\n\"Will you speak?\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, sire, what a dreadful misfortune! I am, indeed, to be pitied. I can\nnever forgive myself!\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Louis XVIII., \"I command you to speak.\"\n\n\"Well, sire, the usurper left Elba on the 26th February, and landed on\nthe 1st of March.\"\n\n\"And where? In Italy?\" asked the king eagerly.\n\n\"In France, sire,--at a small port, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan.\"\n\n\"The usurper landed in France, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan, two\nhundred and fifty leagues from Paris, on the 1st of March, and you only\nacquired this information to-day, the 4th of March! Well, sir, what you\ntell me is impossible. You must have received a false report, or you\nhave gone mad.\"\n\n\"Alas, sire, it is but too true!\" Louis made a gesture of indescribable\nanger and alarm, and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had\nstruck him at the same moment in heart and countenance.\n\n\"In France!\" he cried, \"the usurper in France! Then they did not watch\nover this man. Who knows? they were, perhaps, in league with him.\"\n\n\"Oh, sire,\" exclaimed the Duc de Blacas, \"M. Dandre is not a man to be\naccused of treason! Sire, we have all been blind, and the minister of\npolice has shared the general blindness, that is all.\"\n\n\"But\"--said Villefort, and then suddenly checking himself, he was\nsilent; then he continued, \"Your pardon, sire,\" he said, bowing, \"my\nzeal carried me away. Will your majesty deign to excuse me?\"\n\n\"Speak, sir, speak boldly,\" replied Louis. \"You alone forewarned us of\nthe evil; now try and aid us with the remedy.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Villefort, \"the usurper is detested in the south; and it\nseems to me that if he ventured into the south, it would be easy to\nraise Languedoc and Provence against him.\"\n\n\"Yes, assuredly,\" replied the minister; \"but he is advancing by Gap and\nSisteron.\"\n\n\"Advancing--he is advancing!\" said Louis XVIII. \"Is he then advancing on\nParis?\" The minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent\nto a complete avowal.\n\n\"And Dauphine, sir?\" inquired the king, of Villefort. \"Do you think it\npossible to rouse that as well as Provence?\"\n\n\"Sire, I am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact; but the feeling\nin Dauphine is quite the reverse of that in Provence or Languedoc. The\nmountaineers are Bonapartists, sire.\"\n\n\"Then,\" murmured Louis, \"he was well informed. And how many men had he\nwith him?\"\n\n\"I do not know, sire,\" answered the minister of police.\n\n\"What, you do not know! Have you neglected to obtain information on that\npoint? Of course it is of no consequence,\" he added, with a withering\nsmile.\n\n\"Sire, it was impossible to learn; the despatch simply stated the fact\nof the landing and the route taken by the usurper.\"\n\n\"And how did this despatch reach you?\" inquired the king. The minister\nbowed his head, and while a deep color overspread his cheeks, he\nstammered out,--\n\n\"By the telegraph, sire.\"--Louis XVIII. advanced a step, and folded his\narms over his chest as Napoleon would have done.\n\n\"So then,\" he exclaimed, turning pale with anger, \"seven conjoined and\nallied armies overthrew that man. A miracle of heaven replaced me on\nthe throne of my fathers after five-and-twenty years of exile. I have,\nduring those five-and-twenty years, spared no pains to understand the\npeople of France and the interests which were confided to me; and now,\nwhen I see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach, the power I\nhold in my hands bursts, and shatters me to atoms!\"\n\n\"Sire, it is fatality!\" murmured the minister, feeling that the pressure\nof circumstances, however light a thing to destiny, was too much for any\nhuman strength to endure.\n\n\"What our enemies say of us is then true. We have learnt nothing,\nforgotten nothing! If I were betrayed as he was, I would console myself;\nbut to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor,\nwho ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves,--for my\nfortune is theirs--before me they were nothing--after me they will be\nnothing, and perish miserably from incapacity--ineptitude! Oh, yes, sir,\nyou are right--it is fatality!\"\n\nThe minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm. M. de Blacas wiped\nthe moisture from his brow. Villefort smiled within himself, for he felt\nhis increased importance.\n\n\"To fall,\" continued King Louis, who at the first glance had sounded the\nabyss on which the monarchy hung suspended,--\"to fall, and learn of that\nfall by telegraph! Oh, I would rather mount the scaffold of my brother,\nLouis XVI., than thus descend the staircase at the Tuileries driven away\nby ridicule. Ridicule, sir--why, you know not its power in France, and\nyet you ought to know it!\"\n\n\"Sire, sire,\" murmured the minister, \"for pity's\"--\n\n\"Approach, M. de Villefort,\" resumed the king, addressing the young man,\nwho, motionless and breathless, was listening to a conversation on which\ndepended the destiny of a kingdom. \"Approach, and tell monsieur that it\nis possible to know beforehand all that he has not known.\"\n\n\"Sire, it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man\nconcealed from all the world.\"\n\n\"Really impossible! Yes--that is a great word, sir. Unfortunately, there\nare great words, as there are great men; I have measured them. Really\nimpossible for a minister who has an office, agents, spies, and fifteen\nhundred thousand francs for secret service money, to know what is going\non at sixty leagues from the coast of France! Well, then, see, here is a\ngentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal--a gentleman,\nonly a simple magistrate, who learned more than you with all your\npolice, and who would have saved my crown, if, like you, he had the\npower of directing a telegraph.\" The look of the minister of police was\nturned with concentrated spite on Villefort, who bent his head in modest\ntriumph.\n\n\"I do not mean that for you, Blacas,\" continued Louis XVIII.; \"for if\nyou have discovered nothing, at least you have had the good sense\nto persevere in your suspicions. Any other than yourself would have\nconsidered the disclosure of M. de Villefort insignificant, or else\ndictated by venal ambition,\" These words were an allusion to the\nsentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much\nconfidence an hour before.\n\nVillefort understood the king's intent. Any other person would, perhaps,\nhave been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise; but\nhe feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister,\nalthough he saw that Dandre was irrevocably lost. In fact, the\nminister, who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to unearth\nNapoleon's secret, might in despair at his own downfall interrogate\nDantes and so lay bare the motives of Villefort's plot. Realizing this,\nVillefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen minister, instead of\naiding to crush him.\n\n\"Sire,\" said Villefort, \"the suddenness of this event must prove to your\nmajesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence; what your majesty\nis pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing\nto chance, and I have profited by that chance, like a good and devoted\nservant--that's all. Do not attribute to me more than I deserve, sire,\nthat your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion\nyou have been pleased to form of me.\" The minister of police thanked\nthe young man by an eloquent look, and Villefort understood that he had\nsucceeded in his design; that is to say, that without forfeiting the\ngratitude of the king, he had made a friend of one on whom, in case of\nnecessity, he might rely.\n\n\"'Tis well,\" resumed the king. \"And now, gentlemen,\" he continued,\nturning towards M. de Blacas and the minister of police, \"I have no\nfurther occasion for you, and you may retire; what now remains to do is\nin the department of the minister of war.\"\n\n\"Fortunately, sire,\" said M. de Blacas, \"we can rely on the army; your\nmajesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment.\"\n\n\"Do not mention reports, duke, to me, for I know now what confidence to\nplace in them. Yet, speaking of reports, baron, what have you learned\nwith regard to the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques?\"\n\n\"The affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques!\" exclaimed Villefort, unable to\nrepress an exclamation. Then, suddenly pausing, he added, \"Your pardon,\nsire, but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget, not the\nrespect I have, for that is too deeply engraved in my heart, but the\nrules of etiquette.\"\n\n\"Go on, go on, sir,\" replied the king; \"you have to-day earned the right\nto make inquiries here.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" interposed the minister of police, \"I came a moment ago to give\nyour majesty fresh information which I had obtained on this head, when\nyour majesty's attention was attracted by the terrible event that has\noccurred in the gulf, and now these facts will cease to interest your\nmajesty.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, sir,--on the contrary,\" said Louis XVIII., \"this\naffair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies\nour attention, and the death of General Quesnel will, perhaps, put us on\nthe direct track of a great internal conspiracy.\" At the name of General\nQuesnel, Villefort trembled.\n\n\"Everything points to the conclusion, sire,\" said the minister of\npolice, \"that death was not the result of suicide, as we first believed,\nbut of assassination. General Quesnel, it appears, had just left a\nBonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown person had been\nwith him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the Rue\nSaint-Jacques; unfortunately, the general's valet, who was dressing\nhis hair at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street\nmentioned, but did not catch the number.\" As the police minister related\nthis to the king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life hung on the\nspeaker's lips, turned alternately red and pale. The king looked towards\nhim.\n\n\"Do you not think with me, M. de Villefort, that General Quesnel, whom\nthey believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely\ndevoted to me, has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush?\"\n\n\"It is probable, sire,\" replied Villefort. \"But is this all that is\nknown?\"\n\n\"They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him.\"\n\n\"On his track?\" said Villefort.\n\n\"Yes, the servant has given his description. He is a man of from fifty\nto fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with shaggy\neyebrows, and a thick mustache. He was dressed in a blue frock-coat,\nbuttoned up to the chin, and wore at his button-hole the rosette of an\nofficer of the Legion of Honor. Yesterday a person exactly corresponding\nwith this description was followed, but he was lost sight of at the\ncorner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue Coq-Heron.\" Villefort\nleaned on the back of an arm-chair, for as the minister of police went\non speaking he felt his legs bend under him; but when he learned that\nthe unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him, he\nbreathed again.\n\n\"Continue to seek for this man, sir,\" said the king to the minister of\npolice; \"for if, as I am all but convinced, General Quesnel, who\nwould have been so useful to us at this moment, has been murdered, his\nassassins, Bonapartists or not, shall be cruelly punished.\" It required\nall Villefort's coolness not to betray the terror with which this\ndeclaration of the king inspired him.\n\n\"How strange,\" continued the king, with some asperity; \"the police think\nthat they have disposed of the whole matter when they say, 'A murder has\nbeen committed,' and especially so when they can add, 'And we are on the\ntrack of the guilty persons.'\"\n\n\"Sire, your majesty will, I trust, be amply satisfied on this point at\nleast.\"\n\n\"We shall see. I will no longer detain you, M. de Villefort, for you\nmust be fatigued after so long a journey; go and rest. Of course you\nstopped at your father's?\" A feeling of faintness came over Villefort.\n\n\"No, sire,\" he replied, \"I alighted at the Hotel de Madrid, in the Rue\nde Tournon.\"\n\n\"But you have seen him?\"\n\n\"Sire, I went straight to the Duc de Blacas.\"\n\n\"But you will see him, then?\"\n\n\"I think not, sire.\"\n\n\"Ah, I forgot,\" said Louis, smiling in a manner which proved that all\nthese questions were not made without a motive; \"I forgot you and\nM. Noirtier are not on the best terms possible, and that is another\nsacrifice made to the royal cause, and for which you should be\nrecompensed.\"\n\n\"Sire, the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a\nrecompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have nothing\nmore to ask for.\"\n\n\"Never mind, sir, we will not forget you; make your mind easy. In the\nmeanwhile\" (the king here detached the cross of the Legion of Honor\nwhich he usually wore over his blue coat, near the cross of St. Louis,\nabove the order of Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel and St. Lazare, and gave it\nto Villefort)--\"in the meanwhile take this cross.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said Villefort, \"your majesty mistakes; this is an officer's\ncross.\"\n\n\"Ma foi,\" said Louis XVIII., \"take it, such as it is, for I have not the\ntime to procure you another. Blacas, let it be your care to see that the\nbrevet is made out and sent to M. de Villefort.\" Villefort's eyes were\nfilled with tears of joy and pride; he took the cross and kissed it.\n\n\"And now,\" he said, \"may I inquire what are the orders with which your\nmajesty deigns to honor me?\"\n\n\"Take what rest you require, and remember that if you are not able to\nserve me here in Paris, you may be of the greatest service to me at\nMarseilles.\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied Villefort, bowing, \"in an hour I shall have quitted\nParis.\"\n\n\"Go, sir,\" said the king; \"and should I forget you (kings' memories are\nshort), do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection. Baron,\nsend for the minister of war. Blacas, remain.\"\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" said the minister of police to Villefort, as they left the\nTuileries, \"you entered by luck's door--your fortune is made.\"\n\n\"Will it be long first?\" muttered Villefort, saluting the minister,\nwhose career was ended, and looking about him for a hackney-coach.\nOne passed at the moment, which he hailed; he gave his address to the\ndriver, and springing in, threw himself on the seat, and gave loose to\ndreams of ambition.\n\nTen minutes afterwards Villefort reached his hotel, ordered horses to be\nready in two hours, and asked to have his breakfast brought to him. He\nwas about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and\nloud. The valet opened the door, and Villefort heard some one speak his\nname.\n\n\"Who could know that I was here already?\" said the young man. The valet\nentered.\n\n\"Well,\" said Villefort, \"what is it?--Who rang?--Who asked for me?\"\n\n\"A stranger who will not send in his name.\"\n\n\"A stranger who will not send in his name! What can he want with me?\"\n\n\"He wishes to speak to you.\"\n\n\"To me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did he mention my name?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What sort of person is he?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, a man of about fifty.\"\n\n\"Short or tall?\"\n\n\"About your own height, sir.\"\n\n\"Dark or fair?\"\n\n\"Dark,--very dark; with black eyes, black hair, black eyebrows.\"\n\n\"And how dressed?\" asked Villefort quickly.\n\n\"In a blue frock-coat, buttoned up close, decorated with the Legion of\nHonor.\"\n\n\"It is he!\" said Villefort, turning pale.\n\n\"Eh, pardieu,\" said the individual whose description we have twice\ngiven, entering the door, \"what a great deal of ceremony! Is it the\ncustom in Marseilles for sons to keep their fathers waiting in their\nanterooms?\"\n\n\"Father!\" cried Villefort, \"then I was not deceived; I felt sure it must\nbe you.\"\n\n\"Well, then, if you felt so sure,\" replied the new-comer, putting his\ncane in a corner and his hat on a chair, \"allow me to say, my dear\nGerard, that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the\ndoor.\"\n\n\"Leave us, Germain,\" said Villefort. The servant quitted the apartment\nwith evident signs of astonishment.\n\n\n\nChapter 12. Father and Son.\n\nM. Noirtier--for it was, indeed, he who entered--looked after the\nservant until the door was closed, and then, fearing, no doubt, that he\nmight be overheard in the ante-chamber, he opened the door again,\nnor was the precaution useless, as appeared from the rapid retreat of\nGermain, who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our\nfirst parents. M. Noirtier then took the trouble to close and bolt the\nante-chamber door, then that of the bed-chamber, and then extended his\nhand to Villefort, who had followed all his motions with surprise which\nhe could not conceal.\n\n\"Well, now, my dear Gerard,\" said he to the young man, with a very\nsignificant look, \"do you know, you seem as if you were not very glad to\nsee me?\"\n\n\"My dear father,\" said Villefort, \"I am, on the contrary, delighted; but\nI so little expected your visit, that it has somewhat overcome me.\"\n\n\"But, my dear fellow,\" replied M. Noirtier, seating himself, \"I might\nsay the same thing to you, when you announce to me your wedding for the\n28th of February, and on the 3rd of March you turn up here in Paris.\"\n\n\"And if I have come, my dear father,\" said Gerard, drawing closer to\nM. Noirtier, \"do not complain, for it is for you that I came, and my\njourney will be your salvation.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed!\" said M. Noirtier, stretching himself out at his ease\nin the chair. \"Really, pray tell me all about it, for it must be\ninteresting.\"\n\n\"Father, you have heard speak of a certain Bonapartist club in the Rue\nSaint-Jacques?\"\n\n\"No. 53; yes, I am vice-president.\"\n\n\"Father, your coolness makes me shudder.\"\n\n\"Why, my dear boy, when a man has been proscribed by the mountaineers,\nhas escaped from Paris in a hay-cart, been hunted over the plains of\nBordeaux by Robespierre's bloodhounds, he becomes accustomed to most\nthings. But go on, what about the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques?\"\n\n\"Why, they induced General Quesnel to go there, and General Quesnel, who\nquitted his own house at nine o'clock in the evening, was found the next\nday in the Seine.\"\n\n\"And who told you this fine story?\"\n\n\"The king himself.\"\n\n\"Well, then, in return for your story,\" continued Noirtier, \"I will tell\nyou another.\"\n\n\"My dear father, I think I already know what you are about to tell me.\"\n\n\"Ah, you have heard of the landing of the emperor?\"\n\n\"Not so loud, father, I entreat of you--for your own sake as well as\nmine. Yes, I heard this news, and knew it even before you could; for\nthree days ago I posted from Marseilles to Paris with all possible\nspeed, half-desperate at the enforced delay.\"\n\n\"Three days ago? You are crazy. Why, three days ago the emperor had not\nlanded.\"\n\n\"No matter, I was aware of his intention.\"\n\n\"How did you know about it?\"\n\n\"By a letter addressed to you from the Island of Elba.\"\n\n\"To me?\"\n\n\"To you; and which I discovered in the pocket-book of the messenger. Had\nthat letter fallen into the hands of another, you, my dear father, would\nprobably ere this have been shot.\" Villefort's father laughed.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said he, \"will the Restoration adopt imperial methods so\npromptly? Shot, my dear boy? What an idea! Where is the letter you speak\nof? I know you too well to suppose you would allow such a thing to pass\nyou.\"\n\n\"I burnt it, for fear that even a fragment should remain; for that\nletter must have led to your condemnation.\"\n\n\"And the destruction of your future prospects,\" replied Noirtier; \"yes,\nI can easily comprehend that. But I have nothing to fear while I have\nyou to protect me.\"\n\n\"I do better than that, sir--I save you.\"\n\n\"You do? Why, really, the thing becomes more and more dramatic--explain\nyourself.\"\n\n\"I must refer again to the club in the Rue Saint-Jacques.\"\n\n\"It appears that this club is rather a bore to the police. Why didn't\nthey search more vigilantly? they would have found\"--\n\n\"They have not found; but they are on the track.\"\n\n\"Yes, that the usual phrase; I am quite familiar with it. When the\npolice is at fault, it declares that it is on the track; and the\ngovernment patiently awaits the day when it comes to say, with a\nsneaking air, that the track is lost.\"\n\n\"Yes, but they have found a corpse; the general has been killed, and in\nall countries they call that a murder.\"\n\n\"A murder do you call it? why, there is nothing to prove that the\ngeneral was murdered. People are found every day in the Seine, having\nthrown themselves in, or having been drowned from not knowing how to\nswim.\"\n\n\"Father, you know very well that the general was not a man to drown\nhimself in despair, and people do not bathe in the Seine in the month of\nJanuary. No, no, do not be deceived; this was murder in every sense of\nthe word.\"\n\n\"And who thus designated it?\"\n\n\"The king himself.\"\n\n\"The king! I thought he was philosopher enough to allow that there was\nno murder in politics. In politics, my dear fellow, you know, as well\nas I do, there are no men, but ideas--no feelings, but interests; in\npolitics we do not kill a man, we only remove an obstacle, that is all.\nWould you like to know how matters have progressed? Well, I will tell\nyou. It was thought reliance might be placed in General Quesnel; he was\nrecommended to us from the Island of Elba; one of us went to him, and\ninvited him to the Rue Saint-Jacques, where he would find some friends.\nHe came there, and the plan was unfolded to him for leaving Elba, the\nprojected landing, etc. When he had heard and comprehended all to the\nfullest extent, he replied that he was a royalist. Then all looked at\neach other,--he was made to take an oath, and did so, but with such an\nill grace that it was really tempting Providence to swear him, and yet,\nin spite of that, the general was allowed to depart free--perfectly\nfree. Yet he did not return home. What could that mean? why, my dear\nfellow, that on leaving us he lost his way, that's all. A murder?\nreally, Villefort, you surprise me. You, a deputy procureur, to found\nan accusation on such bad premises! Did I ever say to you, when you were\nfulfilling your character as a royalist, and cut off the head of one of\nmy party, 'My son, you have committed a murder?' No, I said, 'Very well,\nsir, you have gained the victory; to-morrow, perchance, it will be our\nturn.'\"\n\n\"But, father, take care; when our turn comes, our revenge will be\nsweeping.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you.\"\n\n\"You rely on the usurper's return?\"\n\n\"We do.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken; he will not advance two leagues into the interior of\nFrance without being followed, tracked, and caught like a wild beast.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, the emperor is at this moment on the way to Grenoble;\non the 10th or 12th he will be at Lyons, and on the 20th or 25th at\nParis.\"\n\n\"The people will rise.\"\n\n\"Yes, to go and meet him.\"\n\n\"He has but a handful of men with him, and armies will be despatched\nagainst him.\"\n\n\"Yes, to escort him into the capital. Really, my dear Gerard, you are\nbut a child; you think yourself well informed because the telegraph\nhas told you, three days after the landing, 'The usurper has landed at\nCannes with several men. He is pursued.' But where is he? what is he\ndoing? You do not know at all, and in this way they will chase him to\nParis, without drawing a trigger.\"\n\n\"Grenoble and Lyons are faithful cities, and will oppose to him an\nimpassable barrier.\"\n\n\"Grenoble will open her gates to him with enthusiasm--all Lyons will\nhasten to welcome him. Believe me, we are as well informed as you, and\nour police are as good as your own. Would you like a proof of it? well,\nyou wished to conceal your journey from me, and yet I knew of your\narrival half an hour after you had passed the barrier. You gave your\ndirection to no one but your postilion, yet I have your address, and in\nproof I am here the very instant you are going to sit at table. Ring,\nthen, if you please, for a second knife, fork, and plate, and we will\ndine together.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" replied Villefort, looking at his father with astonishment,\n\"you really do seem very well informed.\"\n\n\"Eh? the thing is simple enough. You who are in power have only the\nmeans that money produces--we who are in expectation, have those which\ndevotion prompts.\"\n\n\"Devotion!\" said Villefort, with a sneer.\n\n\"Yes, devotion; for that is, I believe, the phrase for hopeful\nambition.\"\n\nAnd Villefort's father extended his hand to the bell-rope, to summon the\nservant whom his son had not called. Villefort caught his arm.\n\n\"Wait, my dear father,\" said the young man, \"one word more.\"\n\n\"Say on.\"\n\n\"However stupid the royalist police may be, they do know one terrible\nthing.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"The description of the man who, on the morning of the day when General\nQuesnel disappeared, presented himself at his house.\"\n\n\"Oh, the admirable police have found that out, have they? And what may\nbe that description?\"\n\n\"Dark complexion; hair, eyebrows, and whiskers, black; blue frock-coat,\nbuttoned up to the chin; rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor in\nhis button-hole; a hat with wide brim, and a cane.\"\n\n\"Ah, ha, that's it, is it?\" said Noirtier; \"and why, then, have they not\nlaid hands on him?\"\n\n\"Because yesterday, or the day before, they lost sight of him at the\ncorner of the Rue Coq-Heron.\"\n\n\"Didn't I say that your police were good for nothing?\"\n\n\"Yes; but they may catch him yet.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Noirtier, looking carelessly around him, \"true, if this\nperson were not on his guard, as he is;\" and he added with a smile, \"He\nwill consequently make a few changes in his personal appearance.\" At\nthese words he rose, and put off his frock-coat and cravat, went towards\na table on which lay his son's toilet articles, lathered his face,\ntook a razor, and, with a firm hand, cut off the compromising whiskers.\nVillefort watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration.\n\nHis whiskers cut off, Noirtier gave another turn to his hair; took,\ninstead of his black cravat, a colored neckerchief which lay at the top\nof an open portmanteau; put on, in lieu of his blue and high-buttoned\nfrock-coat, a coat of Villefort's of dark brown, and cut away in front;\ntried on before the glass a narrow-brimmed hat of his son's, which\nappeared to fit him perfectly, and, leaving his cane in the corner where\nhe had deposited it, he took up a small bamboo switch, cut the air with\nit once or twice, and walked about with that easy swagger which was one\nof his principal characteristics.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, turning towards his wondering son, when this disguise\nwas completed, \"well, do you think your police will recognize me now.\"\n\n\"No, father,\" stammered Villefort; \"at least, I hope not.\"\n\n\"And now, my dear boy,\" continued Noirtier, \"I rely on your prudence to\nremove all the things which I leave in your care.\"\n\n\"Oh, rely on me,\" said Villefort.\n\n\"Yes, yes; and now I believe you are right, and that you have really\nsaved my life; be assured I will return the favor hereafter.\" Villefort\nshook his head.\n\n\"You are not convinced yet?\"\n\n\"I hope at least, that you may be mistaken.\"\n\n\"Shall you see the king again?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"Would you pass in his eyes for a prophet?\"\n\n\"Prophets of evil are not in favor at the court, father.\"\n\n\"True, but some day they do them justice; and supposing a second\nrestoration, you would then pass for a great man.\"\n\n\"Well, what should I say to the king?\"\n\n\"Say this to him: 'Sire, you are deceived as to the feeling in France,\nas to the opinions of the towns, and the prejudices of the army; he\nwhom in Paris you call the Corsican ogre, who at Nevers is styled\nthe usurper, is already saluted as Bonaparte at Lyons, and emperor at\nGrenoble. You think he is tracked, pursued, captured; he is advancing\nas rapidly as his own eagles. The soldiers you believe to be dying with\nhunger, worn out with fatigue, ready to desert, gather like atoms of\nsnow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward. Sire, go, leave France\nto its real master, to him who acquired it, not by purchase, but by\nright of conquest; go, sire, not that you incur any risk, for your\nadversary is powerful enough to show you mercy, but because it would be\nhumiliating for a grandson of Saint Louis to owe his life to the man of\nArcola, Marengo, Austerlitz.' Tell him this, Gerard; or, rather, tell\nhim nothing. Keep your journey a secret; do not boast of what you\nhave come to Paris to do, or have done; return with all speed; enter\nMarseilles at night, and your house by the back-door, and there remain,\nquiet, submissive, secret, and, above all, inoffensive; for this time, I\nswear to you, we shall act like powerful men who know their enemies. Go,\nmy son--go, my dear Gerard, and by your obedience to my paternal orders,\nor, if you prefer it, friendly counsels, we will keep you in your place.\nThis will be,\" added Noirtier, with a smile, \"one means by which you\nmay a second time save me, if the political balance should some day take\nanother turn, and cast you aloft while hurling me down. Adieu, my dear\nGerard, and at your next journey alight at my door.\" Noirtier left the\nroom when he had finished, with the same calmness that had characterized\nhim during the whole of this remarkable and trying conversation.\nVillefort, pale and agitated, ran to the window, put aside the curtain,\nand saw him pass, cool and collected, by two or three ill-looking men at\nthe corner of the street, who were there, perhaps, to arrest a man with\nblack whiskers, and a blue frock-coat, and hat with broad brim.\n\nVillefort stood watching, breathless, until his father had disappeared\nat the Rue Bussy. Then he turned to the various articles he had left\nbehind him, put the black cravat and blue frock-coat at the bottom of\nthe portmanteau, threw the hat into a dark closet, broke the cane into\nsmall bits and flung it in the fire, put on his travelling-cap, and\ncalling his valet, checked with a look the thousand questions he was\nready to ask, paid his bill, sprang into his carriage, which was ready,\nlearned at Lyons that Bonaparte had entered Grenoble, and in the\nmidst of the tumult which prevailed along the road, at length reached\nMarseilles, a prey to all the hopes and fears which enter into the heart\nof man with ambition and its first successes.\n\n\n\nChapter 13. The Hundred Days.\n\nM. Noirtier was a true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he had\npredicted. Every one knows the history of the famous return from Elba,\na return which was unprecedented in the past, and will probably remain\nwithout a counterpart in the future.\n\nLouis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow;\nthe monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious\nfoundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure\nof ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort,\ntherefore, gained nothing save the king's gratitude (which was rather\nlikely to injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion of\nHonor, which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas had\nduly forwarded the brevet.\n\nNapoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had\nit not been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the\nGirondin of '93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately\nhad been his protector. All Villefort's influence barely enabled him to\nstifle the secret Dantes had so nearly divulged. The king's procureur\nalone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.\n\nHowever, scarcely was the imperial power established--that is, scarcely\nhad the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue orders from\nthe closet into which we have introduced our readers,--he found on the\ntable there Louis XVIII.'s half-filled snuff-box,--scarcely had this\noccurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to rekindle\nthe flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and it\nrequired but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater\nviolence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the\nroyalists whenever they ventured abroad.\n\nOwing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment--we\nwill not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather\na timid man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of\nBonaparte accused him of \"moderation\"--but sufficiently influential to\nmake a demand in favor of Dantes.\n\nVillefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more\nfavorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gerard\nrequired a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII.\nreturned, the influence of M. de Saint-Meran, like his own, could\nbe vastly increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The\ndeputy-procureur was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles,\nwhen one morning his door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.\n\nAny one else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man\nof ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made Morrel\nwait in the ante-chamber, although he had no one with him, for the\nsimple reason that the king's procureur always makes every one wait, and\nafter passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he ordered M.\nMorrel to be admitted.\n\nMorrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had\nfound him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial\npoliteness, that most insurmountable barrier which separates the\nwell-bred from the vulgar man.\n\nHe had entered Villefort's office expecting that the magistrate would\ntremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder all\nover him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his desk,\nand his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door; Villefort\ngazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him; then,\nafter a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned his hat\nin his hands,--\n\n\"M. Morrel, I believe?\" said Villefort.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Come nearer,\" said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of the hand,\n\"and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this visit.\"\n\n\"Do you not guess, monsieur?\" asked Morrel.\n\n\"Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be\ndelighted.\"\n\n\"Everything depends on you.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself, pray.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Morrel, recovering his assurance as he proceeded, \"do\nyou recollect that a few days before the landing of his majesty the\nemperor, I came to intercede for a young man, the mate of my ship, who\nwas accused of being concerned in correspondence with the Island of\nElba? What was the other day a crime is to-day a title to favor. You\nthen served Louis XVIII., and you did not show any favor--it was your\nduty; to-day you serve Napoleon, and you ought to protect him--it is\nequally your duty; I come, therefore, to ask what has become of him?\"\n\nVillefort by a strong effort sought to control himself. \"What is his\nname?\" said he. \"Tell me his name.\"\n\n\"Edmond Dantes.\"\n\nVillefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a\npistol at five-and-twenty paces than have heard this name spoken; but he\ndid not blanch.\n\n\"Dantes,\" repeated he, \"Edmond Dantes.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\" Villefort opened a large register, then went to a\ntable, from the table turned to his registers, and then, turning to\nMorrel,--\n\n\"Are you quite sure you are not mistaken, monsieur?\" said he, in the\nmost natural tone in the world.\n\nHad Morrel been a more quick-sighted man, or better versed in these\nmatters, he would have been surprised at the king's procureur answering\nhim on such a subject, instead of referring him to the governors of the\nprison or the prefect of the department. But Morrel, disappointed in\nhis expectations of exciting fear, was conscious only of the other's\ncondescension. Villefort had calculated rightly.\n\n\"No,\" said Morrel; \"I am not mistaken. I have known him for ten years,\nthe last four of which he was in my service. Do not you recollect, I\ncame about six weeks ago to plead for clemency, as I come to-day to\nplead for justice. You received me very coldly. Oh, the royalists were\nvery severe with the Bonapartists in those days.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" returned Villefort, \"I was then a royalist, because I\nbelieved the Bourbons not only the heirs to the throne, but the chosen\nof the nation. The miraculous return of Napoleon has conquered me, the\nlegitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people.\"\n\n\"That's right!\" cried Morrel. \"I like to hear you speak thus, and I\naugur well for Edmond from it.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" said Villefort, turning over the leaves of a register;\n\"I have it--a sailor, who was about to marry a young Catalan girl. I\nrecollect now; it was a very serious charge.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"You know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de Justice.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I made my report to the authorities at Paris, and a week after he was\ncarried off.\"\n\n\"Carried off!\" said Morrel. \"What can they have done with him?\"\n\n\"Oh, he has been taken to Fenestrelles, to Pignerol, or to the\nSainte-Marguerite islands. Some fine morning he will return to take\ncommand of your vessel.\"\n\n\"Come when he will, it shall be kept for him. But how is it he is not\nalready returned? It seems to me the first care of government should be\nto set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it.\"\n\n\"Do not be too hasty, M. Morrel,\" replied Villefort. \"The order of\nimprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his liberation\nmust proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has scarcely been\nreinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been forwarded.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Morrel, \"is there no way of expediting all these\nformalities--of releasing him from arrest?\"\n\n\"There has been no arrest.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"It is sometimes essential to government to cause a man's disappearance\nwithout leaving any traces, so that no written forms or documents may\ndefeat their wishes.\"\n\n\"It might be so under the Bourbons, but at present\"--\n\n\"It has always been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis XIV.\nThe emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis himself,\nand the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register is\nincalculable.\" Had Morrel even any suspicions, so much kindness would\nhave dispelled them.\n\n\"Well, M. de Villefort, how would you advise me to act?\" asked he.\n\n\"Petition the minister.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know what that is; the minister receives two hundred petitions\nevery day, and does not read three.\"\n\n\"That is true; but he will read a petition countersigned and presented\nby me.\"\n\n\"And will you undertake to deliver it?\"\n\n\"With the greatest pleasure. Dantes was then guilty, and now he is\ninnocent, and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn\nhim.\" Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry, which,\nhowever improbable it might be, if it did take place would leave him\ndefenceless.\n\n\"But how shall I address the minister?\"\n\n\"Sit down there,\" said Villefort, giving up his place to Morrel, \"and\nwrite what I dictate.\"\n\n\"Will you be so good?\"\n\n\"Certainly. But lose no time; we have lost too much already.\"\n\n\"That is true. Only think what the poor fellow may even now be\nsuffering.\" Villefort shuddered at the suggestion; but he had gone\ntoo far to draw back. Dantes must be crushed to gratify Villefort's\nambition.\n\nVillefort dictated a petition, in which, from an excellent intention, no\ndoubt, Dantes' patriotic services were exaggerated, and he was made out\none of the most active agents of Napoleon's return. It was evident that\nat the sight of this document the minister would instantly release him.\nThe petition finished, Villefort read it aloud.\n\n\"That will do,\" said he; \"leave the rest to me.\"\n\n\"Will the petition go soon?\"\n\n\"To-day.\"\n\n\"Countersigned by you?\"\n\n\"The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the contents\nof your petition.\" And, sitting down, Villefort wrote the certificate at\nthe bottom.\n\n\"What more is to be done?\"\n\n\"I will do whatever is necessary.\" This assurance delighted Morrel, who\ntook leave of Villefort, and hastened to announce to old Dantes that he\nwould soon see his son.\n\nAs for Villefort, instead of sending to Paris, he carefully preserved\nthe petition that so fearfully compromised Dantes, in the hopes of an\nevent that seemed not unlikely,--that is, a second restoration. Dantes\nremained a prisoner, and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis\nXVIII.'s throne, or the still more tragic destruction of the empire.\n\nTwice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand, and twice\nhad Villefort soothed him with promises. At last there was Waterloo,\nand Morrel came no more; he had done all that was in his power, and any\nfresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly.\n\nLouis XVIII. remounted the throne; Villefort, to whom Marseilles\nhad become filled with remorseful memories, sought and obtained the\nsituation of king's procureur at Toulouse, and a fortnight afterwards\nhe married Mademoiselle de Saint-Meran, whose father now stood higher at\ncourt than ever.\n\nAnd so Dantes, after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo, remained in\nhis dungeon, forgotten of earth and heaven. Danglars comprehended the\nfull extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed Dantes; and, when\nNapoleon returned to France, he, after the manner of mediocre minds,\ntermed the coincidence, \"a decree of Providence.\" But when Napoleon\nreturned to Paris, Danglars' heart failed him, and he lived in constant\nfear of Dantes' return on a mission of vengeance. He therefore informed\nM. Morrel of his wish to quit the sea, and obtained a recommendation\nfrom him to a Spanish merchant, into whose service he entered at the end\nof March, that is, ten or twelve days after Napoleon's return. He then\nleft for Madrid, and was no more heard of.\n\nFernand understood nothing except that Dantes was absent. What had\nbecome of him he cared not to inquire. Only, during the respite the\nabsence of his rival afforded him, he reflected, partly on the means of\ndeceiving Mercedes as to the cause of his absence, partly on plans of\nemigration and abduction, as from time to time he sat sad and motionless\non the summit of Cape Pharo, at the spot from whence Marseilles and\nthe Catalans are visible, watching for the apparition of a young and\nhandsome man, who was for him also the messenger of vengeance. Fernand's\nmind was made up; he would shoot Dantes, and then kill himself. But\nFernand was mistaken; a man of his disposition never kills himself, for\nhe constantly hopes.\n\nDuring this time the empire made its last conscription, and every man\nin France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the\nemperor. Fernand departed with the rest, bearing with him the terrible\nthought that while he was away, his rival would perhaps return and marry\nMercedes. Had Fernand really meant to kill himself, he would have done\nso when he parted from Mercedes. His devotion, and the compassion he\nshowed for her misfortunes, produced the effect they always produce on\nnoble minds--Mercedes had always had a sincere regard for Fernand, and\nthis was now strengthened by gratitude.\n\n\"My brother,\" said she as she placed his knapsack on his shoulders,\n\"be careful of yourself, for if you are killed, I shall be alone in the\nworld.\" These words carried a ray of hope into Fernand's heart. Should\nDantes not return, Mercedes might one day be his.\n\nMercedes was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never\nseemed so barren, and the sea that had never seemed so vast. Bathed in\ntears she wandered about the Catalan village. Sometimes she stood mute\nand motionless as a statue, looking towards Marseilles, at other times\ngazing on the sea, and debating as to whether it were not better to cast\nherself into the abyss of the ocean, and thus end her woes. It was\nnot want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into\nexecution; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her.\nCaderousse was, like Fernand, enrolled in the army, but, being married\nand eight years older, he was merely sent to the frontier. Old Dantes,\nwho was only sustained by hope, lost all hope at Napoleon's downfall.\nFive months after he had been separated from his son, and almost at the\nhour of his arrest, he breathed his last in Mercedes' arms. M. Morrel\npaid the expenses of his funeral, and a few small debts the poor old man\nhad contracted.\n\nThere was more than benevolence in this action; there was courage; the\nsouth was aflame, and to assist, even on his death-bed, the father of so\ndangerous a Bonapartist as Dantes, was stigmatized as a crime.\n\n\n\nChapter 14. The Two Prisoners.\n\nA year after Louis XVIII.'s restoration, a visit was made by the\ninspector-general of prisons. Dantes in his cell heard the noise of\npreparation,--sounds that at the depth where he lay would have been\ninaudible to any but the ear of a prisoner, who could hear the splash of\nthe drop of water that every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon. He\nguessed something uncommon was passing among the living; but he had so\nlong ceased to have any intercourse with the world, that he looked upon\nhimself as dead.\n\nThe inspector visited, one after another, the cells and dungeons of\nseveral of the prisoners, whose good behavior or stupidity recommended\nthem to the clemency of the government. He inquired how they were fed,\nand if they had any request to make. The universal response was, that\nthe fare was detestable, and that they wanted to be set free.\n\nThe inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for. They shook\ntheir heads. What could they desire beyond their liberty? The inspector\nturned smilingly to the governor.\n\n\"I do not know what reason government can assign for these useless\nvisits; when you see one prisoner, you see all,--always the same\nthing,--ill fed and innocent. Are there any others?\"\n\n\"Yes; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons.\"\n\n\"Let us visit them,\" said the inspector with an air of fatigue. \"We must\nplay the farce to the end. Let us see the dungeons.\"\n\n\"Let us first send for two soldiers,\" said the governor. \"The prisoners\nsometimes, through mere uneasiness of life, and in order to be sentenced\nto death, commit acts of useless violence, and you might fall a victim.\"\n\n\"Take all needful precautions,\" replied the inspector.\n\nTwo soldiers were accordingly sent for, and the inspector descended\na stairway, so foul, so humid, so dark, as to be loathsome to sight,\nsmell, and respiration.\n\n\"Oh,\" cried the inspector, \"who can live here?\"\n\n\"A most dangerous conspirator, a man we are ordered to keep the most\nstrict watch over, as he is daring and resolute.\"\n\n\"He is alone?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"How long has he been there?\"\n\n\"Nearly a year.\"\n\n\"Was he placed here when he first arrived?\"\n\n\"No; not until he attempted to kill the turnkey, who took his food to\nhim.\"\n\n\"To kill the turnkey?\"\n\n\"Yes, the very one who is lighting us. Is it not true, Antoine?\" asked\nthe governor.\n\n\"True enough; he wanted to kill me!\" returned the turnkey.\n\n\"He must be mad,\" said the inspector.\n\n\"He is worse than that,--he is a devil!\" returned the turnkey.\n\n\"Shall I complain of him?\" demanded the inspector.\n\n\"Oh, no; it is useless. Besides, he is almost mad now, and in another\nyear he will be quite so.\"\n\n\"So much the better for him,--he will suffer less,\" said the inspector.\nHe was, as this remark shows, a man full of philanthropy, and in every\nway fit for his office.\n\n\"You are right, sir,\" replied the governor; \"and this remark proves that\nyou have deeply considered the subject. Now we have in a dungeon about\ntwenty feet distant, and to which you descend by another stair, an abbe,\nformerly leader of a party in Italy, who has been here since 1811, and\nin 1813 he went mad, and the change is astonishing. He used to weep, he\nnow laughs; he grew thin, he now grows fat. You had better see him, for\nhis madness is amusing.\"\n\n\"I will see them both,\" returned the inspector; \"I must conscientiously\nperform my duty.\" This was the inspector's first visit; he wished to\ndisplay his authority.\n\n\"Let us visit this one first,\" added he.\n\n\"By all means,\" replied the governor, and he signed to the turnkey to\nopen the door. At the sound of the key turning in the lock, and the\ncreaking of the hinges, Dantes, who was crouched in a corner of the\ndungeon, whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow\niron grating above, raised his head. Seeing a stranger, escorted by two\nturnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers, and to whom\nthe governor spoke bareheaded, Dantes, who guessed the truth, and that\nthe moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come,\nsprang forward with clasped hands.\n\nThe soldiers interposed their bayonets, for they thought that he was\nabout to attack the inspector, and the latter recoiled two or three\nsteps. Dantes saw that he was looked upon as dangerous. Then, infusing\nall the humility he possessed into his eyes and voice, he addressed the\ninspector, and sought to inspire him with pity.\n\nThe inspector listened attentively; then, turning to the governor,\nobserved, \"He will become religious--he is already more gentle; he is\nafraid, and retreated before the bayonets--madmen are not afraid of\nanything; I made some curious observations on this at Charenton.\" Then,\nturning to the prisoner, \"What is it you want?\" said he.\n\n\"I want to know what crime I have committed--to be tried; and if I am\nguilty, to be shot; if innocent, to be set at liberty.\"\n\n\"Are you well fed?\" said the inspector.\n\n\"I believe so; I don't know; it's of no consequence. What matters\nreally, not only to me, but to officers of justice and the king, is that\nan innocent man should languish in prison, the victim of an infamous\ndenunciation, to die here cursing his executioners.\"\n\n\"You are very humble to-day,\" remarked the governor; \"you are not\nso always; the other day, for instance, when you tried to kill the\nturnkey.\"\n\n\"It is true, sir, and I beg his pardon, for he his always been very good\nto me, but I was mad.\"\n\n\"And you are not so any longer?\"\n\n\"No; captivity has subdued me--I have been here so long.\"\n\n\"So long?--when were you arrested, then?\" asked the inspector.\n\n\"The 28th of February, 1815, at half-past two in the afternoon.\"\n\n\"To-day is the 30th of July, 1816,--why it is but seventeen months.\"\n\n\"Only seventeen months,\" replied Dantes. \"Oh, you do not know what is\nseventeen months in prison!--seventeen ages rather, especially to a man\nwho, like me, had arrived at the summit of his ambition--to a man, who,\nlike me, was on the point of marrying a woman he adored, who saw an\nhonorable career opened before him, and who loses all in an instant--who\nsees his prospects destroyed, and is ignorant of the fate of his\naffianced wife, and whether his aged father be still living! Seventeen\nmonths captivity to a sailor accustomed to the boundless ocean, is a\nworse punishment than human crime ever merited. Have pity on me,\nthen, and ask for me, not intelligence, but a trial; not pardon, but a\nverdict--a trial, sir, I ask only for a trial; that, surely, cannot be\ndenied to one who is accused!\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" said the inspector; then, turning to the governor, \"On\nmy word, the poor devil touches me. You must show me the proofs against\nhim.\"\n\n\"Certainly; but you will find terrible charges.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" continued Dantes, \"I know it is not in your power to release\nme; but you can plead for me--you can have me tried--and that is all\nI ask. Let me know my crime, and the reason why I was condemned.\nUncertainty is worse than all.\"\n\n\"Go on with the lights,\" said the inspector.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" cried Dantes, \"I can tell by your voice you are touched with\npity; tell me at least to hope.\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you that,\" replied the inspector; \"I can only promise to\nexamine into your case.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am free--then I am saved!\"\n\n\"Who arrested you?\"\n\n\"M. Villefort. See him, and hear what he says.\"\n\n\"M. Villefort is no longer at Marseilles; he is now at Toulouse.\"\n\n\"I am no longer surprised at my detention,\" murmured Dantes, \"since my\nonly protector is removed.\"\n\n\"Had M. de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you?\"\n\n\"None; on the contrary, he was very kind to me.\"\n\n\"I can, then, rely on the notes he has left concerning you?\"\n\n\"Entirely.\"\n\n\"That is well; wait patiently, then.\" Dantes fell on his knees, and\nprayed earnestly. The door closed; but this time a fresh inmate was left\nwith Dantes--hope.\n\n\"Will you see the register at once,\" asked the governor, \"or proceed to\nthe other cell?\"\n\n\"Let us visit them all,\" said the inspector. \"If I once went up those\nstairs. I should never have the courage to come down again.\"\n\n\"Ah, this one is not like the other, and his madness is less affecting\nthan this one's display of reason.\"\n\n\"What is his folly?\"\n\n\"He fancies he possesses an immense treasure. The first year he offered\ngovernment a million of francs for his release; the second, two; the\nthird, three; and so on progressively. He is now in his fifth year of\ncaptivity; he will ask to speak to you in private, and offer you five\nmillions.\"\n\n\"How curious!--what is his name?\"\n\n\"The Abbe Faria.\"\n\n\"No. 27,\" said the inspector.\n\n\"It is here; unlock the door, Antoine.\" The turnkey obeyed, and the\ninspector gazed curiously into the chamber of the \"mad abbe.\"\n\nIn the centre of the cell, in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster\ndetached from the wall, sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely\ncovered him. He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines, and seemed\nas much absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the soldier of\nMarcellus slew him.\n\nHe did not move at the sound of the door, and continued his calculations\nuntil the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the\nsombre walls of his cell; then, raising his head, he perceived with\nastonishment the number of persons present. He hastily seized the\ncoverlet of his bed, and wrapped it round him.\n\n\"What is it you want?\" said the inspector.\n\n\"I, monsieur,\" replied the abbe with an air of surprise--\"I want\nnothing.\"\n\n\"You do not understand,\" continued the inspector; \"I am sent here by\ngovernment to visit the prison, and hear the requests of the prisoners.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is different,\" cried the abbe; \"and we shall understand each\nother, I hope.\"\n\n\"There, now,\" whispered the governor, \"it is just as I told you.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" continued the prisoner, \"I am the Abbe Faria, born at Rome.\nI was for twenty years Cardinal Spada's secretary; I was arrested, why,\nI know not, toward the beginning of the year 1811; since then I have\ndemanded my liberty from the Italian and French government.\"\n\n\"Why from the French government?\"\n\n\"Because I was arrested at Piombino, and I presume that, like Milan and\nFlorence, Piombino has become the capital of some French department.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the inspector, \"you have not the latest news from Italy?\"\n\n\"My information dates from the day on which I was arrested,\" returned\nthe Abbe Faria; \"and as the emperor had created the kingdom of Rome for\nhis infant son, I presume that he has realized the dream of Machiavelli\nand Caesar Borgia, which was to make Italy a united kingdom.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" returned the inspector, \"providence has changed this\ngigantic plan you advocate so warmly.\"\n\n\"It is the only means of rendering Italy strong, happy, and\nindependent.\"\n\n\"Very possibly; only I am not come to discuss politics, but to inquire\nif you have anything to ask or to complain of.\"\n\n\"The food is the same as in other prisons,--that is, very bad; the\nlodging is very unhealthful, but, on the whole, passable for a dungeon;\nbut it is not that which I wish to speak of, but a secret I have to\nreveal of the greatest importance.\"\n\n\"We are coming to the point,\" whispered the governor.\n\n\"It is for that reason I am delighted to see you,\" continued the abbe,\n\"although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation, which,\nif it succeeded, would possibly change Newton's system. Could you allow\nme a few words in private.\"\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" said the governor.\n\n\"You knew him,\" returned the inspector with a smile.\n\n\"What you ask is impossible, monsieur,\" continued he, addressing Faria.\n\n\"But,\" said the abbe, \"I would speak to you of a large sum, amounting to\nfive millions.\"\n\n\"The very sum you named,\" whispered the inspector in his turn.\n\n\"However,\" continued Faria, seeing that the inspector was about to\ndepart, \"it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone; the governor\ncan be present.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" said the governor, \"I know beforehand what you are\nabout to say; it concerns your treasures, does it not?\" Faria fixed his\neyes on him with an expression that would have convinced any one else of\nhis sanity.\n\n\"Of course,\" said he; \"of what else should I speak?\"\n\n\"Mr. Inspector,\" continued the governor, \"I can tell you the story as\nwell as he, for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five\nyears.\"\n\n\"That proves,\" returned the abbe, \"that you are like those of Holy Writ,\nwho having ears hear not, and having eyes see not.\"\n\n\"My dear sir, the government is rich and does not want your treasures,\"\nreplied the inspector; \"keep them until you are liberated.\" The abbe's\neyes glistened; he seized the inspector's hand.\n\n\"But what if I am not liberated,\" cried he, \"and am detained here until\nmy death? this treasure will be lost. Had not government better profit\nby it? I will offer six millions, and I will content myself with the\nrest, if they will only give me my liberty.\"\n\n\"On my word,\" said the inspector in a low tone, \"had I not been told\nbeforehand that this man was mad, I should believe what he says.\"\n\n\"I am not mad,\" replied Faria, with that acuteness of hearing peculiar\nto prisoners. \"The treasure I speak of really exists, and I offer to\nsign an agreement with you, in which I promise to lead you to the spot\nwhere you shall dig; and if I deceive you, bring me here again,--I ask\nno more.\"\n\nThe governor laughed. \"Is the spot far from here?\"\n\n\"A hundred leagues.\"\n\n\"It is not ill-planned,\" said the governor. \"If all the prisoners took\nit into their heads to travel a hundred leagues, and their guardians\nconsented to accompany them, they would have a capital chance of\nescaping.\"\n\n\"The scheme is well known,\" said the inspector; \"and the abbe's plan has\nnot even the merit of originality.\"\n\nThen turning to Faria--\"I inquired if you are well fed?\" said he.\n\n\"Swear to me,\" replied Faria, \"to free me if what I tell you prove true,\nand I will stay here while you go to the spot.\"\n\n\"Are you well fed?\" repeated the inspector.\n\n\"Monsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so\nthere is no chance of my escaping.\"\n\n\"You do not reply to my question,\" replied the inspector impatiently.\n\n\"Nor you to mine,\" cried the abbe. \"You will not accept my gold; I will\nkeep it for myself. You refuse me my liberty; God will give it me.\" And\nthe abbe, casting away his coverlet, resumed his place, and continued\nhis calculations.\n\n\"What is he doing there?\" said the inspector.\n\n\"Counting his treasures,\" replied the governor.\n\nFaria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt. They\nwent out. The turnkey closed the door behind them.\n\n\"He was wealthy once, perhaps?\" said the inspector.\n\n\"Or dreamed he was, and awoke mad.\"\n\n\"After all,\" said the inspector, \"if he had been rich, he would not have\nbeen here.\" So the matter ended for the Abbe Faria. He remained in his\ncell, and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity.\n\nCaligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the\nimpossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his\nwealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. But the kings of modern\ntimes, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither\ncourage nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the\neye that scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves\nsprung from Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are\nnot inviolable.\n\nIt has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer\nthe victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition rarely\nallowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their\nflesh lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its cell,\nfrom whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital,\nwhere the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being\nthe jailer delivers to him. The very madness of the Abbe Faria, gone mad\nin prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity.\n\nThe inspector kept his word with Dantes; he examined the register, and\nfound the following note concerning him:--\n\nEdmond Dantes:\n\nViolent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba.\n\nThe greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised.\n\nThis note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it\nhad been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend\nagainst this accusation; he simply wrote,--\"Nothing to be done.\"\n\nThis visit had infused new vigor into Dantes; he had, till then,\nforgotten the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the\ndate, 30th July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose\nhis reckoning again. Days and weeks passed away, then months--Dantes\nstill waited; he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This\nfortnight expired, he decided that the inspector would do nothing until\nhis return to Paris, and that he would not reach there until his circuit\nwas finished, he therefore fixed three months; three months passed\naway, then six more. Finally ten months and a half had gone by and\nno favorable change had taken place, and Dantes began to fancy the\ninspector's visit but a dream, an illusion of the brain.\n\nAt the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had\nobtained charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his\nsubordinates, and amongst them Dantes' jailer. A new governor arrived;\nit would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the prisoners;\nhe learned their numbers instead. This horrible place contained fifty\ncells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell,\nand the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantes--he was now\nnumber 34.\n\n\n\nChapter 15. Number 34 and Number 27.\n\nDantes passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in\nsuspense. He was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence\nwhich is the sequence to hope; then he began to doubt his own innocence,\nwhich justified in some measure the governor's belief in his mental\nalienation; and then, relaxing his sentiment of pride, he addressed his\nsupplications, not to God, but to man. God is always the last resource.\nUnfortunates, who ought to begin with God, do not have any hope in him\ntill they have exhausted all other means of deliverance.\n\nDantes asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another; for\na change, however disadvantageous, was still a change, and would afford\nhim some amusement. He entreated to be allowed to walk about, to have\nfresh air, books, and writing materials. His requests were not granted,\nbut he went on asking all the same. He accustomed himself to speaking to\nthe new jailer, although the latter was, if possible, more taciturn\nthan the old one; but still, to speak to a man, even though mute, was\nsomething. Dantes spoke for the sake of hearing his own voice; he had\ntried to speak when alone, but the sound of his voice terrified him.\nOften, before his captivity, Dantes' mind had revolted at the idea of\nassemblages of prisoners, made up of thieves, vagabonds, and murderers.\nHe now wished to be amongst them, in order to see some other face\nbesides that of his jailer; he sighed for the galleys, with the infamous\ncostume, the chain, and the brand on the shoulder. The galley-slaves\nbreathed the fresh air of heaven, and saw each other. They were very\nhappy. He besought the jailer one day to let him have a companion, were\nit even the mad abbe.\n\nThe jailer, though rough and hardened by the constant sight of so much\nsuffering, was yet a man. At the bottom of his heart he had often had a\nfeeling of pity for this unhappy young man who suffered so; and he laid\nthe request of number 34 before the governor; but the latter sapiently\nimagined that Dantes wished to conspire or attempt an escape, and\nrefused his request. Dantes had exhausted all human resources, and he\nthen turned to God.\n\nAll the pious ideas that had been so long forgotten, returned; he\nrecollected the prayers his mother had taught him, and discovered a new\nmeaning in every word; for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere\nmedley of words, until misfortune comes and the unhappy sufferer first\nunderstands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the\npity of heaven! He prayed, and prayed aloud, no longer terrified at\nthe sound of his own voice, for he fell into a sort of ecstasy. He\nlaid every action of his life before the Almighty, proposed tasks to\naccomplish, and at the end of every prayer introduced the entreaty\noftener addressed to man than to God: \"Forgive us our trespasses as\nwe forgive them that trespass against us.\" Yet in spite of his earnest\nprayers, Dantes remained a prisoner.\n\nThen gloom settled heavily upon him. Dantes was a man of great\nsimplicity of thought, and without education; he could not, therefore,\nin the solitude of his dungeon, traverse in mental vision the history of\nthe ages, bring to life the nations that had perished, and rebuild the\nancient cities so vast and stupendous in the light of the imagination,\nand that pass before the eye glowing with celestial colors in Martin's\nBabylonian pictures. He could not do this, he whose past life was so\nshort, whose present so melancholy, and his future so doubtful. Nineteen\nyears of light to reflect upon in eternal darkness! No distraction could\ncome to his aid; his energetic spirit, that would have exalted in thus\nrevisiting the past, was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage. He clung to\none idea--that of his happiness, destroyed, without apparent cause,\nby an unheard-of fatality; he considered and reconsidered this idea,\ndevoured it (so to speak), as the implacable Ugolino devours the skull\nof Archbishop Roger in the Inferno of Dante.\n\nRage supplanted religious fervor. Dantes uttered blasphemies that made\nhis jailer recoil with horror, dashed himself furiously against the\nwalls of his prison, wreaked his anger upon everything, and chiefly upon\nhimself, so that the least thing,--a grain of sand, a straw, or a breath\nof air that annoyed him, led to paroxysms of fury. Then the letter that\nVillefort had showed to him recurred to his mind, and every line gleamed\nforth in fiery letters on the wall like the mene tekel upharsin of\nBelshazzar. He told himself that it was the enmity of man, and not the\nvengeance of heaven, that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery.\nHe consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he\ncould imagine, and found them all insufficient, because after torture\ncame death, and after death, if not repose, at least the boon of\nunconsciousness.\n\nBy dint of constantly dwelling on the idea that tranquillity was death,\nand if punishment were the end in view other tortures than death must be\ninvented, he began to reflect on suicide. Unhappy he, who, on the brink\nof misfortune, broods over ideas like these!\n\nBefore him is a dead sea that stretches in azure calm before the eye;\nbut he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling\nwith a monster that would drag him down to perdition. Once thus\nensnared, unless the protecting hand of God snatch him thence, all is\nover, and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction. This state\nof mental anguish is, however, less terrible than the sufferings that\nprecede or the punishment that possibly will follow. There is a sort of\nconsolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss, at the bottom of\nwhich lie darkness and obscurity.\n\nEdmond found some solace in these ideas. All his sorrows, all his\nsufferings, with their train of gloomy spectres, fled from his cell when\nthe angel of death seemed about to enter. Dantes reviewed his past\nlife with composure, and, looking forward with terror to his future\nexistence, chose that middle line that seemed to afford him a refuge.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" said he, \"in my voyages, when I was a man and commanded\nother men, I have seen the heavens overcast, the sea rage and foam, the\nstorm arise, and, like a monstrous bird, beating the two horizons with\nits wings. Then I felt that my vessel was a vain refuge, that trembled\nand shook before the tempest. Soon the fury of the waves and the sight\nof the sharp rocks announced the approach of death, and death then\nterrified me, and I used all my skill and intelligence as a man and a\nsailor to struggle against the wrath of God. But I did so because I was\nhappy, because I had not courted death, because to be cast upon a bed\nof rocks and seaweed seemed terrible, because I was unwilling that I, a\ncreature made for the service of God, should serve for food to the gulls\nand ravens. But now it is different; I have lost all that bound me to\nlife, death smiles and invites me to repose; I die after my own manner,\nI die exhausted and broken-spirited, as I fall asleep when I have paced\nthree thousand times round my cell.\"\n\nNo sooner had this idea taken possession of him than he became more\ncomposed, arranged his couch to the best of his power, ate little and\nslept less, and found existence almost supportable, because he felt that\nhe could throw it off at pleasure, like a worn-out garment. Two methods\nof self-destruction were at his disposal. He could hang himself with his\nhandkerchief to the window bars, or refuse food and die of starvation.\nBut the first was repugnant to him. Dantes had always entertained the\ngreatest horror of pirates, who are hung up to the yard-arm; he would\nnot die by what seemed an infamous death. He resolved to adopt the\nsecond, and began that day to carry out his resolve. Nearly four years\nhad passed away; at the end of the second he had ceased to mark the\nlapse of time.\n\nDantes said, \"I wish to die,\" and had chosen the manner of his death,\nand fearful of changing his mind, he had taken an oath to die. \"When my\nmorning and evening meals are brought,\" thought he, \"I will cast them\nout of the window, and they will think that I have eaten them.\"\n\nHe kept his word; twice a day he cast out, through the barred aperture,\nthe provisions his jailer brought him--at first gayly, then with\ndeliberation, and at last with regret. Nothing but the recollection\nof his oath gave him strength to proceed. Hunger made viands once\nrepugnant, now acceptable; he held the plate in his hand for an hour\nat a time, and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat, of tainted\nfish, of black and mouldy bread. It was the last yearning for life\ncontending with the resolution of despair; then his dungeon seemed less\nsombre, his prospects less desperate. He was still young--he was\nonly four or five and twenty--he had nearly fifty years to live. What\nunforseen events might not open his prison door, and restore him to\nliberty? Then he raised to his lips the repast that, like a voluntary\nTantalus, he refused himself; but he thought of his oath, and he\nwould not break it. He persisted until, at last, he had not sufficient\nstrength to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole. The next\nmorning he could not see or hear; the jailer feared he was dangerously\nill. Edmond hoped he was dying.\n\nThus the day passed away. Edmond felt a sort of stupor creeping over him\nwhich brought with it a feeling almost of content; the gnawing pain at\nhis stomach had ceased; his thirst had abated; when he closed his eyes\nhe saw myriads of lights dancing before them like the will-o'-the-wisps\nthat play about the marshes. It was the twilight of that mysterious\ncountry called Death!\n\nSuddenly, about nine o'clock in the evening, Edmond heard a hollow sound\nin the wall against which he was lying.\n\nSo many loathsome animals inhabited the prison, that their noise did\nnot, in general, awake him; but whether abstinence had quickened his\nfaculties, or whether the noise was really louder than usual, Edmond\nraised his head and listened. It was a continual scratching, as if made\nby a huge claw, a powerful tooth, or some iron instrument attacking the\nstones.\n\nAlthough weakened, the young man's brain instantly responded to the idea\nthat haunts all prisoners--liberty! It seemed to him that heaven had\nat length taken pity on him, and had sent this noise to warn him on the\nvery brink of the abyss. Perhaps one of those beloved ones he had so\noften thought of was thinking of him, and striving to diminish the\ndistance that separated them.\n\nNo, no, doubtless he was deceived, and it was but one of those dreams\nthat forerun death!\n\nEdmond still heard the sound. It lasted nearly three hours; he then\nheard a noise of something falling, and all was silent.\n\nSome hours afterwards it began again, nearer and more distinct. Edmond\nwas intensely interested. Suddenly the jailer entered.\n\nFor a week since he had resolved to die, and during the four days that\nhe had been carrying out his purpose, Edmond had not spoken to the\nattendant, had not answered him when he inquired what was the matter\nwith him, and turned his face to the wall when he looked too curiously\nat him; but now the jailer might hear the noise and put an end to\nit, and so destroy a ray of something like hope that soothed his last\nmoments.\n\nThe jailer brought him his breakfast. Dantes raised himself up and began\nto talk about everything; about the bad quality of the food, about the\ncoldness of his dungeon, grumbling and complaining, in order to have an\nexcuse for speaking louder, and wearying the patience of his jailer,\nwho out of kindness of heart had brought broth and white bread for his\nprisoner.\n\nFortunately, he fancied that Dantes was delirious; and placing the food\non the rickety table, he withdrew. Edmond listened, and the sound became\nmore and more distinct.\n\n\"There can be no doubt about it,\" thought he; \"it is some prisoner who\nis striving to obtain his freedom. Oh, if I were only there to help\nhim!\" Suddenly another idea took possession of his mind, so used to\nmisfortune, that it was scarcely capable of hope--the idea that the\nnoise was made by workmen the governor had ordered to repair the\nneighboring dungeon.\n\nIt was easy to ascertain this; but how could he risk the question? It\nwas easy to call his jailer's attention to the noise, and watch his\ncountenance as he listened; but might he not by this means destroy\nhopes far more important than the short-lived satisfaction of his own\ncuriosity? Unfortunately, Edmond's brain was still so feeble that he\ncould not bend his thoughts to anything in particular.\n\nHe saw but one means of restoring lucidity and clearness to his\njudgment. He turned his eyes towards the soup which the jailer had\nbrought, rose, staggered towards it, raised the vessel to his lips, and\ndrank off the contents with a feeling of indescribable pleasure. He had\noften heard that shipwrecked persons had died through having eagerly\ndevoured too much food. Edmond replaced on the table the bread he was\nabout to devour, and returned to his couch--he did not wish to die. He\nsoon felt that his ideas became again collected--he could think, and\nstrengthen his thoughts by reasoning. Then he said to himself, \"I must\nput this to the test, but without compromising anybody. If it is a\nworkman, I need but knock against the wall, and he will cease to work,\nin order to find out who is knocking, and why he does so; but as his\noccupation is sanctioned by the governor, he will soon resume it. If, on\nthe contrary, it is a prisoner, the noise I make will alarm him, he will\ncease, and not begin again until he thinks every one is asleep.\"\n\nEdmond rose again, but this time his legs did not tremble, and his sight\nwas clear; he went to a corner of his dungeon, detached a stone, and\nwith it knocked against the wall where the sound came. He struck thrice.\nAt the first blow the sound ceased, as if by magic.\n\nEdmond listened intently; an hour passed, two hours passed, and no sound\nwas heard from the wall--all was silent there.\n\nFull of hope, Edmond swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and water,\nand, thanks to the vigor of his constitution, found himself well-nigh\nrecovered.\n\nThe day passed away in utter silence--night came without recurrence of\nthe noise.\n\n\"It is a prisoner,\" said Edmond joyfully. The night passed in perfect\nsilence. Edmond did not close his eyes.\n\nIn the morning the jailer brought him fresh provisions--he had already\ndevoured those of the previous day; he ate these listening anxiously for\nthe sound, walking round and round his cell, shaking the iron bars of\nthe loophole, restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise, and\nso preparing himself for his future destiny. At intervals he listened\nto learn if the noise had not begun again, and grew impatient at the\nprudence of the prisoner, who did not guess he had been disturbed by a\ncaptive as anxious for liberty as himself.\n\nThree days passed--seventy-two long tedious hours which he counted off\nby minutes!\n\nAt length one evening, as the jailer was visiting him for the last time\nthat night, Dantes, with his ear for the hundredth time at the wall,\nfancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the stones. He\nmoved away, walked up and down his cell to collect his thoughts, and\nthen went back and listened.\n\nThe matter was no longer doubtful. Something was at work on the other\nside of the wall; the prisoner had discovered the danger, and had\nsubstituted a lever for a chisel.\n\nEncouraged by this discovery, Edmond determined to assist the\nindefatigable laborer. He began by moving his bed, and looked around\nfor anything with which he could pierce the wall, penetrate the moist\ncement, and displace a stone.\n\nHe saw nothing, he had no knife or sharp instrument, the window grating\nwas of iron, but he had too often assured himself of its solidity. All\nhis furniture consisted of a bed, a chair, a table, a pail, and a jug.\nThe bed had iron clamps, but they were screwed to the wood, and it would\nhave required a screw-driver to take them off. The table and chair\nhad nothing, the pail had once possessed a handle, but that had been\nremoved.\n\nDantes had but one resource, which was to break the jug, and with one of\nthe sharp fragments attack the wall. He let the jug fall on the floor,\nand it broke in pieces.\n\nDantes concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his bed,\nleaving the rest on the floor. The breaking of his jug was too natural\nan accident to excite suspicion. Edmond had all the night to work in,\nbut in the darkness he could not do much, and he soon felt that he was\nworking against something very hard; he pushed back his bed, and waited\nfor day.\n\nAll night he heard the subterranean workman, who continued to mine his\nway. Day came, the jailer entered. Dantes told him that the jug had\nfallen from his hands while he was drinking, and the jailer went\ngrumblingly to fetch another, without giving himself the trouble to\nremove the fragments of the broken one. He returned speedily, advised\nthe prisoner to be more careful, and departed.\n\nDantes heard joyfully the key grate in the lock; he listened until the\nsound of steps died away, and then, hastily displacing his bed, saw\nby the faint light that penetrated into his cell, that he had labored\nuselessly the previous evening in attacking the stone instead of\nremoving the plaster that surrounded it.\n\nThe damp had rendered it friable, and Dantes was able to break it\noff--in small morsels, it is true, but at the end of half an hour he had\nscraped off a handful; a mathematician might have calculated that in\ntwo years, supposing that the rock was not encountered, a passage twenty\nfeet long and two feet broad, might be formed.\n\nThe prisoner reproached himself with not having thus employed the hours\nhe had passed in vain hopes, prayer, and despondency. During the six\nyears that he had been imprisoned, what might he not have accomplished?\n\nIn three days he had succeeded, with the utmost precaution, in removing\nthe cement, and exposing the stone-work. The wall was built of rough\nstones, among which, to give strength to the structure, blocks of hewn\nstone were at intervals imbedded. It was one of these he had uncovered,\nand which he must remove from its socket.\n\nDantes strove to do this with his nails, but they were too weak. The\nfragments of the jug broke, and after an hour of useless toil, he\npaused.\n\nWas he to be thus stopped at the beginning, and was he to wait inactive\nuntil his fellow workman had completed his task? Suddenly an idea\noccurred to him--he smiled, and the perspiration dried on his forehead.\n\nThe jailer always brought Dantes' soup in an iron saucepan; this\nsaucepan contained soup for both prisoners, for Dantes had noticed that\nit was either quite full, or half empty, according as the turnkey gave\nit to him or to his companion first.\n\nThe handle of this saucepan was of iron; Dantes would have given ten\nyears of his life in exchange for it.\n\nThe jailer was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into\nDantes' plate, and Dantes, after eating his soup with a wooden spoon,\nwashed the plate, which thus served for every day. Now when evening\ncame Dantes put his plate on the ground near the door; the jailer, as he\nentered, stepped on it and broke it.\n\nThis time he could not blame Dantes. He was wrong to leave it there, but\nthe jailer was wrong not to have looked before him.\n\nThe jailer, therefore, only grumbled. Then he looked about for something\nto pour the soup into; Dantes' entire dinner service consisted of one\nplate--there was no alternative.\n\n\"Leave the saucepan,\" said Dantes; \"you can take it away when you bring\nme my breakfast.\" This advice was to the jailer's taste, as it spared\nhim the necessity of making another trip. He left the saucepan.\n\nDantes was beside himself with joy. He rapidly devoured his food,\nand after waiting an hour, lest the jailer should change his mind and\nreturn, he removed his bed, took the handle of the saucepan, inserted\nthe point between the hewn stone and rough stones of the wall, and\nemployed it as a lever. A slight oscillation showed Dantes that all\nwent well. At the end of an hour the stone was extricated from the wall,\nleaving a cavity a foot and a half in diameter.\n\nDantes carefully collected the plaster, carried it into the corner of\nhis cell, and covered it with earth. Then, wishing to make the best\nuse of his time while he had the means of labor, he continued to work\nwithout ceasing. At the dawn of day he replaced the stone, pushed his\nbed against the wall, and lay down. The breakfast consisted of a piece\nof bread; the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table.\n\n\"Well, don't you intend to bring me another plate?\" said Dantes.\n\n\"No,\" replied the turnkey; \"you destroy everything. First you break your\njug, then you make me break your plate; if all the prisoners followed\nyour example, the government would be ruined. I shall leave you the\nsaucepan, and pour your soup into that. So for the future I hope you\nwill not be so destructive.\"\n\nDantes raised his eyes to heaven and clasped his hands beneath the\ncoverlet. He felt more gratitude for the possession of this piece of\niron than he had ever felt for anything. He had noticed, however, that\nthe prisoner on the other side had ceased to labor; no matter, this was\na greater reason for proceeding--if his neighbor would not come to him,\nhe would go to his neighbor. All day he toiled on untiringly, and by\nthe evening he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and\nfragments of stone. When the hour for his jailer's visit arrived, Dantes\nstraightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could, and placed\nit in its accustomed place. The turnkey poured his ration of soup\ninto it, together with the fish--for thrice a week the prisoners were\ndeprived of meat. This would have been a method of reckoning time, had\nnot Dantes long ceased to do so. Having poured out the soup, the turnkey\nretired. Dantes wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really\nceased to work. He listened--all was silent, as it had been for the last\nthree days. Dantes sighed; it was evident that his neighbor distrusted\nhim. However, he toiled on all the night without being discouraged; but\nafter two or three hours he encountered an obstacle. The iron made no\nimpression, but met with a smooth surface; Dantes touched it, and found\nthat it was a beam. This beam crossed, or rather blocked up, the hole\nDantes had made; it was necessary, therefore, to dig above or under\nit. The unhappy young man had not thought of this. \"O my God, my God!\"\nmurmured he, \"I have so earnestly prayed to you, that I hoped my prayers\nhad been heard. After having deprived me of my liberty, after having\ndeprived me of death, after having recalled me to existence, my God,\nhave pity on me, and do not let me die in despair!\"\n\n\"Who talks of God and despair at the same time?\" said a voice that\nseemed to come from beneath the earth, and, deadened by the distance,\nsounded hollow and sepulchral in the young man's ears. Edmond's hair\nstood on end, and he rose to his knees.\n\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"I hear a human voice.\" Edmond had not heard any one\nspeak save his jailer for four or five years; and a jailer is no man\nto a prisoner--he is a living door, a barrier of flesh and blood adding\nstrength to restraints of oak and iron.\n\n\"In the name of heaven,\" cried Dantes, \"speak again, though the sound of\nyour voice terrifies me. Who are you?\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" said the voice.\n\n\"An unhappy prisoner,\" replied Dantes, who made no hesitation in\nanswering.\n\n\"Of what country?\"\n\n\"A Frenchman.\"\n\n\"Your name?\"\n\n\"Edmond Dantes.\"\n\n\"Your profession?\"\n\n\"A sailor.\"\n\n\"How long have you been here?\"\n\n\"Since the 28th of February, 1815.\"\n\n\"Your crime?\"\n\n\"I am innocent.\"\n\n\"But of what are you accused?\"\n\n\"Of having conspired to aid the emperor's return.\"\n\n\"What! For the emperor's return?--the emperor is no longer on the\nthrone, then?\"\n\n\"He abdicated at Fontainebleau in 1814, and was sent to the Island\nof Elba. But how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all\nthis?\"\n\n\"Since 1811.\"\n\nDantes shuddered; this man had been four years longer than himself in\nprison.\n\n\"Do not dig any more,\" said the voice; \"only tell me how high up is your\nexcavation?\"\n\n\"On a level with the floor.\"\n\n\"How is it concealed?\"\n\n\"Behind my bed.\"\n\n\"Has your bed been moved since you have been a prisoner?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What does your chamber open on?\"\n\n\"A corridor.\"\n\n\"And the corridor?\"\n\n\"On a court.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" murmured the voice.\n\n\"Oh, what is the matter?\" cried Dantes.\n\n\"I have made a mistake owing to an error in my plans. I took the wrong\nangle, and have come out fifteen feet from where I intended. I took the\nwall you are mining for the outer wall of the fortress.\"\n\n\"But then you would be close to the sea?\"\n\n\"That is what I hoped.\"\n\n\"And supposing you had succeeded?\"\n\n\"I should have thrown myself into the sea, gained one of the islands\nnear here--the Isle de Daume or the Isle de Tiboulen--and then I should\nhave been safe.\"\n\n\"Could you have swum so far?\"\n\n\"Heaven would have given me strength; but now all is lost.\"\n\n\"All?\"\n\n\"Yes; stop up your excavation carefully, do not work any more, and wait\nuntil you hear from me.\"\n\n\"Tell me, at least, who you are?\"\n\n\"I am--I am No. 27.\"\n\n\"You mistrust me, then,\" said Dantes. Edmond fancied he heard a bitter\nlaugh resounding from the depths.\n\n\"Oh, I am a Christian,\" cried Dantes, guessing instinctively that this\nman meant to abandon him. \"I swear to you by him who died for us that\nnaught shall induce me to breathe one syllable to my jailers; but I\nconjure you do not abandon me. If you do, I swear to you, for I have got\nto the end of my strength, that I will dash my brains out against the\nwall, and you will have my death to reproach yourself with.\"\n\n\"How old are you? Your voice is that of a young man.\"\n\n\"I do not know my age, for I have not counted the years I have been\nhere. All I do know is, that I was just nineteen when I was arrested,\nthe 28th of February, 1815.\"\n\n\"Not quite twenty-six!\" murmured the voice; \"at that age he cannot be a\ntraitor.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no,\" cried Dantes. \"I swear to you again, rather than betray\nyou, I would allow myself to be hacked in pieces!\"\n\n\"You have done well to speak to me, and ask for my assistance, for I was\nabout to form another plan, and leave you; but your age reassures me. I\nwill not forget you. Wait.\"\n\n\"How long?\"\n\n\"I must calculate our chances; I will give you the signal.\"\n\n\"But you will not leave me; you will come to me, or you will let me come\nto you. We will escape, and if we cannot escape we will talk; you\nof those whom you love, and I of those whom I love. You must love\nsomebody?\"\n\n\"No, I am alone in the world.\"\n\n\"Then you will love me. If you are young, I will be your comrade; if you\nare old, I will be your son. I have a father who is seventy if he yet\nlives; I only love him and a young girl called Mercedes. My father has\nnot yet forgotten me, I am sure, but God alone knows if she loves me\nstill; I shall love you as I loved my father.\"\n\n\"It is well,\" returned the voice; \"to-morrow.\"\n\nThese few words were uttered with an accent that left no doubt of his\nsincerity; Dantes rose, dispersed the fragments with the same precaution\nas before, and pushed his bed back against the wall. He then gave\nhimself up to his happiness. He would no longer be alone. He was,\nperhaps, about to regain his liberty; at the worst, he would have a\ncompanion, and captivity that is shared is but half captivity. Plaints\nmade in common are almost prayers, and prayers where two or three are\ngathered together invoke the mercy of heaven.\n\nAll day Dantes walked up and down his cell. He sat down occasionally\non his bed, pressing his hand on his heart. At the slightest noise he\nbounded towards the door. Once or twice the thought crossed his mind\nthat he might be separated from this unknown, whom he loved already; and\nthen his mind was made up--when the jailer moved his bed and stooped to\nexamine the opening, he would kill him with his water jug. He would be\ncondemned to die, but he was about to die of grief and despair when this\nmiraculous noise recalled him to life.\n\nThe jailer came in the evening. Dantes was on his bed. It seemed to him\nthat thus he better guarded the unfinished opening. Doubtless there was\na strange expression in his eyes, for the jailer said, \"Come, are you\ngoing mad again?\"\n\nDantes did not answer; he feared that the emotion of his voice would\nbetray him. The jailer went away shaking his head. Night came; Dantes\nhoped that his neighbor would profit by the silence to address him, but\nhe was mistaken. The next morning, however, just as he removed his bed\nfrom the wall, he heard three knocks; he threw himself on his knees.\n\n\"Is it you?\" said he; \"I am here.\"\n\n\"Is your jailer gone?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dantes; \"he will not return until the evening; so that we\nhave twelve hours before us.\"\n\n\"I can work, then?\" said the voice.\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes; this instant, I entreat you.\"\n\nIn a moment that part of the floor on which Dantes was resting his two\nhands, as he knelt with his head in the opening, suddenly gave way; he\ndrew back smartly, while a mass of stones and earth disappeared in a\nhole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed. Then from\nthe bottom of this passage, the depth of which it was impossible to\nmeasure, he saw appear, first the head, then the shoulders, and lastly\nthe body of a man, who sprang lightly into his cell.\n\n\n\nChapter 16. A Learned Italian.\n\nSeizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired, Dantes\nalmost carried him towards the window, in order to obtain a better view\nof his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through\nthe grating.\n\nHe was a man of small stature, with hair blanched rather by suffering\nand sorrow than by age. He had a deep-set, penetrating eye, almost\nburied beneath the thick gray eyebrow, and a long (and still black)\nbeard reaching down to his breast. His thin face, deeply furrowed by\ncare, and the bold outline of his strongly marked features, betokened a\nman more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical\nstrength. Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow,\nwhile the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could\nonly guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned.\n\nThe stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty-five years; but a\ncertain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it\nprobable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time.\nHe received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with\nevident pleasure, as though his chilled affections were rekindled and\ninvigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent. He thanked him\nwith grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome, although he must at\nthat moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where\nhe had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty.\n\n\"Let us first see,\" said he, \"whether it is possible to remove the\ntraces of my entrance here--our future tranquillity depends upon our\njailers being entirely ignorant of it.\" Advancing to the opening,\nhe stooped and raised the stone easily in spite of its weight; then,\nfitting it into its place, he said,--\n\n\"You removed this stone very carelessly; but I suppose you had no tools\nto aid you.\"\n\n\"Why,\" exclaimed Dantes, with astonishment, \"do you possess any?\"\n\n\"I made myself some; and with the exception of a file, I have all that\nare necessary,--a chisel, pincers, and lever.\"\n\n\"Oh, how I should like to see these products of your industry and\npatience.\"\n\n\"Well, in the first place, here is my chisel.\" So saying, he displayed a\nsharp strong blade, with a handle made of beechwood.\n\n\"And with what did you contrive to make that?\" inquired Dantes.\n\n\"With one of the clamps of my bedstead; and this very tool has sufficed\nme to hollow out the road by which I came hither, a distance of about\nfifty feet.\"\n\n\"Fifty feet!\" responded Dantes, almost terrified.\n\n\"Do not speak so loud, young man--don't speak so loud. It frequently\noccurs in a state prison like this, that persons are stationed outside\nthe doors of the cells purposely to overhear the conversation of the\nprisoners.\"\n\n\"But they believe I am shut up alone here.\"\n\n\"That makes no difference.\"\n\n\"And you say that you dug your way a distance of fifty feet to get\nhere?\"\n\n\"I do; that is about the distance that separates your chamber from mine;\nonly, unfortunately, I did not curve aright; for want of the necessary\ngeometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion, instead of\ntaking an ellipsis of forty feet, I made it fifty. I expected, as I told\nyou, to reach the outer wall, pierce through it, and throw myself into\nthe sea; I have, however, kept along the corridor on which your chamber\nopens, instead of going beneath it. My labor is all in vain, for I find\nthat the corridor looks into a courtyard filled with soldiers.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Dantes; \"but the corridor you speak of only bounds\none side of my cell; there are three others--do you know anything of\ntheir situation?\"\n\n\"This one is built against the solid rock, and it would take ten\nexperienced miners, duly furnished with the requisite tools, as many\nyears to perforate it. This adjoins the lower part of the governor's\napartments, and were we to work our way through, we should only get\ninto some lock-up cellars, where we must necessarily be recaptured. The\nfourth and last side of your cell faces on--faces on--stop a minute, now\nwhere does it face?\"\n\nThe wall of which he spoke was the one in which was fixed the loophole\nby which light was admitted to the chamber. This loophole, which\ngradually diminished in size as it approached the outside, to an opening\nthrough which a child could not have passed, was, for better security,\nfurnished with three iron bars, so as to quiet all apprehensions even\nin the mind of the most suspicious jailer as to the possibility of a\nprisoner's escape. As the stranger asked the question, he dragged the\ntable beneath the window.\n\n\"Climb up,\" said he to Dantes. The young man obeyed, mounted on the\ntable, and, divining the wishes of his companion, placed his back\nsecurely against the wall and held out both hands. The stranger, whom\nas yet Dantes knew only by the number of his cell, sprang up with an\nagility by no means to be expected in a person of his years, and, light\nand steady on his feet as a cat or a lizard, climbed from the table to\nthe outstretched hands of Dantes, and from them to his shoulders;\nthen, bending double, for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from\nholding himself erect, he managed to slip his head between the upper\nbars of the window, so as to be able to command a perfect view from top\nto bottom.\n\nAn instant afterwards he hastily drew back his head, saying, \"I thought\nso!\" and sliding from the shoulders of Dantes as dextrously as he had\nascended, he nimbly leaped from the table to the ground.\n\n\"What was it that you thought?\" asked the young man anxiously, in his\nturn descending from the table.\n\nThe elder prisoner pondered the matter. \"Yes,\" said he at length, \"it\nis so. This side of your chamber looks out upon a kind of open gallery,\nwhere patrols are continually passing, and sentries keep watch day and\nnight.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure of that?\"\n\n\"Certain. I saw the soldier's shape and the top of his musket; that made\nme draw in my head so quickly, for I was fearful he might also see me.\"\n\n\"Well?\" inquired Dantes.\n\n\"You perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your\ndungeon?\"\n\n\"Then,\" pursued the young man eagerly--\n\n\"Then,\" answered the elder prisoner, \"the will of God be done!\" and\nas the old man slowly pronounced those words, an air of profound\nresignation spread itself over his careworn countenance. Dantes gazed on\nthe man who could thus philosophically resign hopes so long and ardently\nnourished with an astonishment mingled with admiration.\n\n\"Tell me, I entreat of you, who and what you are?\" said he at length;\n\"never have I met with so remarkable a person as yourself.\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" answered the stranger; \"if, indeed, you feel any curiosity\nrespecting one, now, alas, powerless to aid you in any way.\"\n\n\"Say not so; you can console and support me by the strength of your own\npowerful mind. Pray let me know who you really are?\"\n\nThe stranger smiled a melancholy smile. \"Then listen,\" said he. \"I am\nthe Abbe Faria, and have been imprisoned as you know in this Chateau\nd'If since the year 1811; previously to which I had been confined for\nthree years in the fortress of Fenestrelle. In the year 1811 I was\ntransferred to Piedmont in France. It was at this period I learned that\nthe destiny which seemed subservient to every wish formed by Napoleon,\nhad bestowed on him a son, named king of Rome even in his cradle. I was\nvery far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of;\nnamely, that four years afterwards, this colossus of power would be\noverthrown. Then who reigns in France at this moment--Napoleon II.?\"\n\n\"No, Louis XVIII.\"\n\n\"The brother of Louis XVII.! How inscrutable are the ways of\nprovidence--for what great and mysterious purpose has it pleased heaven\nto abase the man once so elevated, and raise up him who was so abased?\"\n\nDantes' whole attention was riveted on a man who could thus forget his\nown misfortunes while occupying himself with the destinies of others.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" continued he, \"'Twill be the same as it was in England.\nAfter Charles I., Cromwell; after Cromwell, Charles II., and then James\nII., and then some son-in-law or relation, some Prince of Orange, a\nstadtholder who becomes a king. Then new concessions to the people, then\na constitution, then liberty. Ah, my friend!\" said the abbe, turning\ntowards Dantes, and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet,\n\"you are young, you will see all this come to pass.\"\n\n\"Probably, if ever I get out of prison!\"\n\n\"True,\" replied Faria, \"we are prisoners; but I forget this sometimes,\nand there are even moments when my mental vision transports me beyond\nthese walls, and I fancy myself at liberty.\"\n\n\"But wherefore are you here?\"\n\n\"Because in 1807 I dreamed of the very plan Napoleon tried to realize in\n1811; because, like Machiavelli, I desired to alter the political face\nof Italy, and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity\nof petty principalities, each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler,\nI sought to form one large, compact, and powerful empire; and, lastly,\nbecause I fancied I had found my Caesar Borgia in a crowned simpleton,\nwho feigned to enter into my views only to betray me. It was the plan of\nAlexander VI. and Clement VII., but it will never succeed now, for they\nattempted it fruitlessly, and Napoleon was unable to complete his work.\nItaly seems fated to misfortune.\" And the old man bowed his head.\n\nDantes could not understand a man risking his life for such matters.\nNapoleon certainly he knew something of, inasmuch as he had seen and\nspoken with him; but of Clement VII. and Alexander VI. he knew nothing.\n\n\"Are you not,\" he asked, \"the priest who here in the Chateau d'If is\ngenerally thought to be--ill?\"\n\n\"Mad, you mean, don't you?\"\n\n\"I did not like to say so,\" answered Dantes, smiling.\n\n\"Well, then,\" resumed Faria with a bitter smile, \"let me answer your\nquestion in full, by acknowledging that I am the poor mad prisoner\nof the Chateau d'If, for many years permitted to amuse the different\nvisitors with what is said to be my insanity; and, in all probability,\nI should be promoted to the honor of making sport for the children, if\nsuch innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to\nsuffering and despair.\"\n\nDantes remained for a short time mute and motionless; at length he\nsaid,--\"Then you abandon all hope of escape?\"\n\n\"I perceive its utter impossibility; and I consider it impious to\nattempt that which the Almighty evidently does not approve.\"\n\n\"Nay, be not discouraged. Would it not be expecting too much to hope to\nsucceed at your first attempt? Why not try to find an opening in another\ndirection from that which has so unfortunately failed?\"\n\n\"Alas, it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to\neffect a purpose so unexpectedly frustrated, that you talk of beginning\nover again. In the first place, I was four years making the tools I\npossess, and have been two years scraping and digging out earth, hard\nas granite itself; then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove\nhuge stones I should once have deemed impossible to loosen. Whole days\nhave I passed in these Titanic efforts, considering my labor well repaid\nif, by night-time I had contrived to carry away a square inch of this\nhard-bound cement, changed by ages into a substance unyielding as the\nstones themselves; then to conceal the mass of earth and rubbish I dug\nup, I was compelled to break through a staircase, and throw the\nfruits of my labor into the hollow part of it; but the well is now so\ncompletely choked up, that I scarcely think it would be possible to add\nanother handful of dust without leading to discovery. Consider also that\nI fully believed I had accomplished the end and aim of my undertaking,\nfor which I had so exactly husbanded my strength as to make it just hold\nout to the termination of my enterprise; and now, at the moment when I\nreckoned upon success, my hopes are forever dashed from me. No, I repeat\nagain, that nothing shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at\nvariance with the Almighty's pleasure.\"\n\nDantes held down his head, that the other might not see how joy at the\nthought of having a companion outweighed the sympathy he felt for the\nfailure of the abbe's plans.\n\nThe abbe sank upon Edmond's bed, while Edmond himself remained standing.\nEscape had never once occurred to him. There are, indeed, some things\nwhich appear so impossible that the mind does not dwell on them for an\ninstant. To undermine the ground for fifty feet--to devote three years\nto a labor which, if successful, would conduct you to a precipice\noverhanging the sea--to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty,\nsixty, perhaps a hundred feet, at the risk of being dashed to pieces\nagainst the rocks, should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped\nthe fire of the sentinels; and even, supposing all these perils past,\nthen to have to swim for your life a distance of at least three miles\nere you could reach the shore--were difficulties so startling and\nformidable that Dantes had never even dreamed of such a scheme,\nresigning himself rather to death. But the sight of an old man clinging\nto life with so desperate a courage, gave a fresh turn to his ideas, and\ninspired him with new courage. Another, older and less strong than he,\nhad attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake,\nand had failed only because of an error in calculation. This same\nperson, with almost incredible patience and perseverance, had contrived\nto provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt.\nAnother had done all this; why, then, was it impossible to Dantes? Faria\nhad dug his way through fifty feet, Dantes would dig a hundred; Faria,\nat the age of fifty, had devoted three years to the task; he, who was\nbut half as old, would sacrifice six; Faria, a priest and savant,\nhad not shrunk from the idea of risking his life by trying to swim a\ndistance of three miles to one of the islands--Daume, Rattonneau, or\nLemaire; should a hardy sailer, an experienced diver, like himself,\nshrink from a similar task; should he, who had so often for mere\namusement's sake plunged to the bottom of the sea to fetch up the bright\ncoral branch, hesitate to entertain the same project? He could do it in\nan hour, and how many times had he, for pure pastime, continued in the\nwater for more than twice as long! At once Dantes resolved to follow the\nbrave example of his energetic companion, and to remember that what has\nonce been done may be done again.\n\nAfter continuing some time in profound meditation, the young man\nsuddenly exclaimed, \"I have found what you were in search of!\"\n\nFaria started: \"Have you, indeed?\" cried he, raising his head with quick\nanxiety; \"pray, let me know what it is you have discovered?\"\n\n\"The corridor through which you have bored your way from the cell you\noccupy here, extends in the same direction as the outer gallery, does it\nnot?\"\n\n\"It does.\"\n\n\"And is not above fifteen feet from it?\"\n\n\"About that.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I will tell you what we must do. We must pierce through the\ncorridor by forming a side opening about the middle, as it were the top\npart of a cross. This time you will lay your plans more accurately; we\nshall get out into the gallery you have described; kill the sentinel\nwho guards it, and make our escape. All we require to insure success is\ncourage, and that you possess, and strength, which I am not deficient\nin; as for patience, you have abundantly proved yours--you shall now see\nme prove mine.\"\n\n\"One instant, my dear friend,\" replied the abbe; \"it is clear you do not\nunderstand the nature of the courage with which I am endowed, and what\nuse I intend making of my strength. As for patience, I consider that I\nhave abundantly exercised that in beginning every morning the task of\nthe night before, and every night renewing the task of the day. But\nthen, young man (and I pray of you to give me your full attention), then\nI thought I could not be doing anything displeasing to the Almighty in\ntrying to set an innocent being at liberty--one who had committed no\noffence, and merited not condemnation.\"\n\n\"And have your notions changed?\" asked Dantes with much surprise; \"do\nyou think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have\nencountered me?\"\n\n\"No; neither do I wish to incur guilt. Hitherto I have fancied myself\nmerely waging war against circumstances, not men. I have thought it\nno sin to bore through a wall, or destroy a staircase; but I cannot so\neasily persuade myself to pierce a heart or take away a life.\" A slight\nmovement of surprise escaped Dantes.\n\n\"Is it possible,\" said he, \"that where your liberty is at stake you can\nallow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it?\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" replied Faria, \"what has hindered you from knocking down your\njailer with a piece of wood torn from your bedstead, dressing yourself\nin his clothes, and endeavoring to escape?\"\n\n\"Simply the fact that the idea never occurred to me,\" answered Dantes.\n\n\"Because,\" said the old man, \"the natural repugnance to the commission\nof such a crime prevented you from thinking of it; and so it ever is\nbecause in simple and allowable things our natural instincts keep us\nfrom deviating from the strict line of duty. The tiger, whose nature\nteaches him to delight in shedding blood, needs but the sense of smell\nto show him when his prey is within his reach, and by following this\ninstinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to\nspring on his victim; but man, on the contrary, loathes the idea of\nblood--it is not alone that the laws of social life inspire him with\na shrinking dread of taking life; his natural construction and\nphysiological formation\"--\n\nDantes was confused and silent at this explanation of the thoughts which\nhad unconsciously been working in his mind, or rather soul; for there\nare two distinct sorts of ideas, those that proceed from the head and\nthose that emanate from the heart.\n\n\"Since my imprisonment,\" said Faria, \"I have thought over all the most\ncelebrated cases of escape on record. They have rarely been successful.\nThose that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated\nupon, and carefully arranged; such, for instance, as the escape of the\nDuc de Beaufort from the Chateau de Vincennes, that of the Abbe Dubuquoi\nfrom For l'Eveque; of Latude from the Bastille. Then there are those for\nwhich chance sometimes affords opportunity, and those are the best of\nall. Let us, therefore, wait patiently for some favorable moment, and\nwhen it presents itself, profit by it.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Dantes, \"you might well endure the tedious delay; you were\nconstantly employed in the task you set yourself, and when weary with\ntoil, you had your hopes to refresh and encourage you.\"\n\n\"I assure you,\" replied the old man, \"I did not turn to that source for\nrecreation or support.\"\n\n\"What did you do then?\"\n\n\"I wrote or studied.\"\n\n\"Were you then permitted the use of pens, ink, and paper?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" answered the abbe; \"I had none but what I made for myself.\"\n\n\"You made paper, pens and ink?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nDantes gazed with admiration, but he had some difficulty in believing.\nFaria saw this.\n\n\"When you pay me a visit in my cell, my young friend,\" said he, \"I will\nshow you an entire work, the fruits of the thoughts and reflections of\nmy whole life; many of them meditated over in the shades of the Colosseum\nat Rome, at the foot of St. Mark's column at Venice, and on the borders\nof the Arno at Florence, little imagining at the time that they would be\narranged in order within the walls of the Chateau d'If. The work I speak\nof is called 'A Treatise on the Possibility of a General Monarchy in\nItaly,' and will make one large quarto volume.\"\n\n\"And on what have you written all this?\"\n\n\"On two of my shirts. I invented a preparation that makes linen as\nsmooth and as easy to write on as parchment.\"\n\n\"You are, then, a chemist?\"\n\n\"Somewhat; I know Lavoisier, and was the intimate friend of Cabanis.\"\n\n\"But for such a work you must have needed books--had you any?\"\n\n\"I had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at Rome; but after\nreading them over many times, I found out that with one hundred and\nfifty well-chosen books a man possesses, if not a complete summary of\nall human knowledge, at least all that a man need really know. I devoted\nthree years of my life to reading and studying these one hundred and\nfifty volumes, till I knew them nearly by heart; so that since I have\nbeen in prison, a very slight effort of memory has enabled me to recall\ntheir contents as readily as though the pages were open before me. I\ncould recite you the whole of Thucydides, Xenophon, Plutarch, Titus\nLivius, Tacitus, Strada, Jornandes, Dante, Montaigne, Shakespeare,\nSpinoza, Machiavelli, and Bossuet. I name only the most important.\"\n\n\"You are, doubtless, acquainted with a variety of languages, so as to\nhave been able to read all these?\"\n\n\"Yes, I speak five of the modern tongues--that is to say, German,\nFrench, Italian, English, and Spanish; by the aid of ancient Greek I\nlearned modern Greek--I don't speak it so well as I could wish, but I am\nstill trying to improve myself.\"\n\n\"Improve yourself!\" repeated Dantes; \"why, how can you manage to do so?\"\n\n\"Why, I made a vocabulary of the words I knew; turned, returned, and\narranged them, so as to enable me to express my thoughts through\ntheir medium. I know nearly one thousand words, which is all that is\nabsolutely necessary, although I believe there are nearly one hundred\nthousand in the dictionaries. I cannot hope to be very fluent, but I\ncertainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes;\nand that would be quite as much as I should ever require.\"\n\nStronger grew the wonder of Dantes, who almost fancied he had to do\nwith one gifted with supernatural powers; still hoping to find some\nimperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings, he\nadded, \"Then if you were not furnished with pens, how did you manage to\nwrite the work you speak of?\"\n\n\"I made myself some excellent ones, which would be universally preferred\nto all others if once known. You are aware what huge whitings are served\nto us on maigre days. Well, I selected the cartilages of the heads of\nthese fishes, and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which\nI welcomed the arrival of each Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, as\naffording me the means of increasing my stock of pens; for I will freely\nconfess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and\nrelief. While retracing the past, I forget the present; and traversing\nat will the path of history I cease to remember that I am myself a\nprisoner.\"\n\n\"But the ink,\" said Dantes; \"of what did you make your ink?\"\n\n\"There was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon,\" replied Faria, \"but it\nwas closed up long ere I became an occupant of this prison. Still, it\nmust have been many years in use, for it was thickly covered with a\ncoating of soot; this soot I dissolved in a portion of the wine brought\nto me every Sunday, and I assure you a better ink cannot be desired. For\nvery important notes, for which closer attention is required, I pricked\none of my fingers, and wrote with my own blood.\"\n\n\"And when,\" asked Dantes, \"may I see all this?\"\n\n\"Whenever you please,\" replied the abbe.\n\n\"Oh, then let it be directly!\" exclaimed the young man.\n\n\"Follow me, then,\" said the abbe, as he re-entered the subterranean\npassage, in which he soon disappeared, followed by Dantes.\n\n\n\nChapter 17. The Abbe's Chamber.\n\nAfter having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean\npassage, which, however, did not admit of their holding themselves\nerect, the two friends reached the further end of the corridor, into\nwhich the abbe's cell opened; from that point the passage became much\nnarrower, and barely permitted one to creep through on hands and knees.\nThe floor of the abbe's cell was paved, and it had been by raising one\nof the stones in the most obscure corner that Faria had to been able\nto commence the laborious task of which Dantes had witnessed the\ncompletion.\n\nAs he entered the chamber of his friend, Dantes cast around one eager\nand searching glance in quest of the expected marvels, but nothing more\nthan common met his view.\n\n\"It is well,\" said the abbe; \"we have some hours before us--it is now\njust a quarter past twelve o'clock.\" Instinctively Dantes turned round\nto observe by what watch or clock the abbe had been able so accurately\nto specify the hour.\n\n\"Look at this ray of light which enters by my window,\" said the abbe,\n\"and then observe the lines traced on the wall. Well, by means of these\nlines, which are in accordance with the double motion of the earth, and\nthe ellipse it describes round the sun, I am enabled to ascertain the\nprecise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a watch; for that\nmight be broken or deranged in its movements, while the sun and earth\nnever vary in their appointed paths.\"\n\nThis last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantes, who had always\nimagined, from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in\nthe Mediterranean, that it moved, and not the earth. A double movement\nof the globe he inhabited, and of which he could feel nothing, appeared\nto him perfectly impossible. Each word that fell from his companion's\nlips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science, as worthy of digging\nout as the gold and diamonds in the mines of Guzerat and Golconda,\nwhich he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his\nearliest youth.\n\n\"Come,\" said he to the abbe, \"I am anxious to see your treasures.\"\n\nThe abbe smiled, and, proceeding to the disused fireplace, raised,\nby the help of his chisel, a long stone, which had doubtless been the\nhearth, beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth, serving as a\nsafe depository of the articles mentioned to Dantes.\n\n\"What do you wish to see first?\" asked the abbe.\n\n\"Oh, your great work on the monarchy of Italy!\"\n\nFaria then drew forth from his hiding-place three or four rolls of\nlinen, laid one over the other, like folds of papyrus. These rolls\nconsisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long;\nthey were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing,\nso legible that Dantes could easily read it, as well as make out the\nsense--it being in Italian, a language he, as a Provencal, perfectly\nunderstood.\n\n\"There,\" said he, \"there is the work complete. I wrote the word finis at\nthe end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week ago. I have torn up two\nof my shirts, and as many handkerchiefs as I was master of, to complete\nthe precious pages. Should I ever get out of prison and find in all\nItaly a printer courageous enough to publish what I have composed, my\nliterary reputation is forever secured.\"\n\n\"I see,\" answered Dantes. \"Now let me behold the curious pens with which\nyou have written your work.\"\n\n\"Look!\" said Faria, showing to the young man a slender stick about\nsix inches long, and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine\npainting-brush, to the end of which was tied, by a piece of thread, one\nof those cartilages of which the abbe had before spoken to Dantes;\nit was pointed, and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen. Dantes\nexamined it with intense admiration, then looked around to see the\ninstrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Faria; \"the penknife. That's my masterpiece. I made\nit, as well as this larger knife, out of an old iron candlestick.\" The\npenknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the other knife, it would\nserve a double purpose, and with it one could cut and thrust.\n\nDantes examined the various articles shown to him with the same\nattention that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools\nexhibited in the shops at Marseilles as the works of the savages in the\nSouth Seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading\nvessels.\n\n\"As for the ink,\" said Faria, \"I told you how I managed to obtain\nthat--and I only just make it from time to time, as I require it.\"\n\n\"One thing still puzzles me,\" observed Dantes, \"and that is how you\nmanaged to do all this by daylight?\"\n\n\"I worked at night also,\" replied Faria.\n\n\"Night!--why, for heaven's sake, are your eyes like cats', that you can\nsee to work in the dark?\"\n\n\"Indeed they are not; but God has supplied man with the intelligence\nthat enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions. I\nfurnished myself with a light.\"\n\n\"You did? Pray tell me how.\"\n\n\"I separated the fat from the meat served to me, melted it, and so made\noil--here is my lamp.\" So saying, the abbe exhibited a sort of torch\nvery similar to those used in public illuminations.\n\n\"But light?\"\n\n\"Here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen.\"\n\n\"And matches?\"\n\n\"I pretended that I had a disorder of the skin, and asked for a little\nsulphur, which was readily supplied.\" Dantes laid the different things\nhe had been looking at on the table, and stood with his head drooping\non his breast, as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and strength of\nFaria's mind.\n\n\"You have not seen all yet,\" continued Faria, \"for I did not think it\nwise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding-place. Let us shut\nthis one up.\" They put the stone back in its place; the abbe sprinkled\na little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed,\nrubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance as the\nother, and then, going towards his bed, he removed it from the spot it\nstood in. Behind the head of the bed, and concealed by a stone fitting\nin so closely as to defy all suspicion, was a hollow space, and in this\nspace a ladder of cords between twenty-five and thirty feet in length.\nDantes closely and eagerly examined it; he found it firm, solid, and\ncompact enough to bear any weight.\n\n\"Who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work?\"\n\n\"I tore up several of my shirts, and ripped out the seams in the sheets\nof my bed, during my three years' imprisonment at Fenestrelle; and when\nI was removed to the Chateau d'If, I managed to bring the ravellings\nwith me, so that I have been able to finish my work here.\"\n\n\"And was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, for when I had taken out the thread I required, I hemmed the\nedges over again.\"\n\n\"With what?\"\n\n\"With this needle,\" said the abbe, as, opening his ragged vestments, he\nshowed Dantes a long, sharp fish-bone, with a small perforated eye\nfor the thread, a small portion of which still remained in it. \"I once\nthought,\" continued Faria, \"of removing these iron bars, and letting\nmyself down from the window, which, as you see, is somewhat wider than\nyours, although I should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my\nflight; however, I discovered that I should merely have dropped into a\nsort of inner court, and I therefore renounced the project altogether\nas too full of risk and danger. Nevertheless, I carefully preserved my\nladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which I spoke\njust now, and which sudden chance frequently brings about.\" While\naffecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder, the mind of\nDantes was, in fact, busily occupied by the idea that a person so\nintelligent, ingenious, and clear-sighted as the abbe might probably be\nable to solve the dark mystery of his own misfortunes, where he himself\ncould see nothing.\n\n\"What are you thinking of?\" asked the abbe smilingly, imputing the deep\nabstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe\nand wonder.\n\n\"I was reflecting, in the first place,\" replied Dantes, \"upon the\nenormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to\nreach the high perfection to which you have attained. What would you not\nhave accomplished if you had been free?\"\n\n\"Possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably, in a\nstate of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies; misfortune\nis needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect.\nCompression is needed to explode gunpowder. Captivity has brought\nmy mental faculties to a focus; and you are well aware that from\nthe collision of clouds electricity is produced--from electricity,\nlightning, from lightning, illumination.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Dantes. \"I know nothing. Some of your words are to me\nquite empty of meaning. You must be blessed indeed to possess the\nknowledge you have.\"\n\nThe abbe smiled. \"Well,\" said he, \"but you had another subject for your\nthoughts; did you not say so just now?\"\n\n\"I did!\"\n\n\"You have told me as yet but one of them--let me hear the other.\"\n\n\"It was this,--that while you had related to me all the particulars of\nyour past life, you were perfectly unacquainted with mine.\"\n\n\"Your life, my young friend, has not been of sufficient length to admit\nof your having passed through any very important events.\"\n\n\"It has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved\nmisfortune. I would fain fix the source of it on man that I may no\nlonger vent reproaches upon heaven.\"\n\n\"Then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged?\"\n\n\"I do, indeed; and this I swear by the two beings most dear to me upon\nearth,--my father and Mercedes.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said the abbe, closing his hiding-place, and pushing the bed\nback to its original situation, \"let me hear your story.\"\n\nDantes obeyed, and commenced what he called his history, but which\nconsisted only of the account of a voyage to India, and two or three\nvoyages to the Levant until he arrived at the recital of his last\ncruise, with the death of Captain Leclere, and the receipt of a packet\nto be delivered by himself to the grand marshal; his interview with that\npersonage, and his receiving, in place of the packet brought, a letter\naddressed to a Monsieur Noirtier--his arrival at Marseilles, and\ninterview with his father--his affection for Mercedes, and their nuptual\nfeast--his arrest and subsequent examination, his temporary detention at\nthe Palais de Justice, and his final imprisonment in the Chateau d'If.\nFrom this point everything was a blank to Dantes--he knew nothing\nmore, not even the length of time he had been imprisoned. His recital\nfinished, the abbe reflected long and earnestly.\n\n\"There is,\" said he, at the end of his meditations, \"a clever maxim,\nwhich bears upon what I was saying to you some little while ago, and\nthat is, that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally depraved\nmind, human nature, in a right and wholesome state, revolts at crime.\nStill, from an artificial civilization have originated wants, vices, and\nfalse tastes, which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle\nwithin us all good feelings, and ultimately to lead us into guilt and\nwickedness. From this view of things, then, comes the axiom that if you\nvisit to discover the author of any bad action, seek first to discover\nthe person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any\nway advantageous. Now, to apply it in your case,--to whom could your\ndisappearance have been serviceable?\"\n\n\"To no one, by heaven! I was a very insignificant person.\"\n\n\"Do not speak thus, for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy;\neverything is relative, my dear young friend, from the king who stands\nin the way of his successor, to the employee who keeps his rival out of\na place. Now, in the event of the king's death, his successor inherits a\ncrown,--when the employee dies, the supernumerary steps into his shoes,\nand receives his salary of twelve thousand livres. Well, these twelve\nthousand livres are his civil list, and are as essential to him as the\ntwelve millions of a king. Every one, from the highest to the lowest\ndegree, has his place on the social ladder, and is beset by stormy\npassions and conflicting interests, as in Descartes' theory of pressure\nand impulsion. But these forces increase as we go higher, so that we\nhave a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon the apex and not on\nthe base. Now let us return to your particular world. You say you were\non the point of being made captain of the Pharaon?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Now, could any one have had any interest in preventing the\naccomplishment of these two things? But let us first settle the question\nas to its being the interest of any one to hinder you from being captain\nof the Pharaon. What say you?\"\n\n\"I cannot believe such was the case. I was generally liked on board, and\nhad the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves, I\nfeel convinced their choice would have fallen on me. There was only one\nperson among the crew who had any feeling of ill-will towards me. I had\nquarelled with him some time previously, and had even challenged him to\nfight me; but he refused.\"\n\n\"Now we are getting on. And what was this man's name?\"\n\n\"Danglars.\"\n\n\"What rank did he hold on board?\"\n\n\"He was supercargo.\"\n\n\"And had you been captain, should you have retained him in his\nemployment?\"\n\n\"Not if the choice had remained with me, for I had frequently observed\ninaccuracies in his accounts.\"\n\n\"Good again! Now then, tell me, was any person present during your last\nconversation with Captain Leclere?\"\n\n\"No; we were quite alone.\"\n\n\"Could your conversation have been overheard by any one?\"\n\n\"It might, for the cabin door was open--and--stay; now I\nrecollect,--Danglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was\ngiving me the packet for the grand marshal.\"\n\n\"That's better,\" cried the abbe; \"now we are on the right scent. Did you\ntake anybody with you when you put into the port of Elba?\"\n\n\"Nobody.\"\n\n\"Somebody there received your packet, and gave you a letter in place of\nit, I think?\"\n\n\"Yes; the grand marshal did.\"\n\n\"And what did you do with that letter?\"\n\n\"Put it into my portfolio.\"\n\n\"You had your portfolio with you, then? Now, how could a sailor find\nroom in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official\nletter?\"\n\n\"You are right; it was left on board.\"\n\n\"Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the letter in\nthe portfolio?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And what did you do with this same letter while returning from\nPorto-Ferrajo to the vessel?\"\n\n\"I carried it in my hand.\"\n\n\"So that when you went on board the Pharaon, everybody could see that\nyou held a letter in your hand?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Danglars, as well as the rest?\"\n\n\"Danglars, as well as others.\"\n\n\"Now, listen to me, and try to recall every circumstance attending your\narrest. Do you recollect the words in which the information against you\nwas formulated?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I read it over three times, and the words sank deeply into my\nmemory.\"\n\n\"Repeat it to me.\"\n\nDantes paused a moment, then said, \"This is it, word for word: 'The\nking's attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion,\nthat one Edmond Dantes, mate on board the Pharaon, this day arrived\nfrom Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been\nintrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper; again, by the usurper,\nwith a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris. This proof of his guilt\nmay be procured by his immediate arrest, as the letter will be found\neither about his person, at his father's residence, or in his cabin\non board the Pharaon.'\" The abbe shrugged his shoulders. \"The thing is\nclear as day,\" said he; \"and you must have had a very confiding nature,\nas well as a good heart, not to have suspected the origin of the whole\naffair.\"\n\n\"Do you really think so? Ah, that would indeed be infamous.\"\n\n\"How did Danglars usually write?\"\n\n\"In a handsome, running hand.\"\n\n\"And how was the anonymous letter written?\"\n\n\"Backhanded.\" Again the abbe smiled. \"Disguised.\"\n\n\"It was very boldly written, if disguised.\"\n\n\"Stop a bit,\" said the abbe, taking up what he called his pen, and,\nafter dipping it into the ink, he wrote on a piece of prepared linen,\nwith his left hand, the first two or three words of the accusation.\nDantes drew back, and gazed on the abbe with a sensation almost\namounting to terror.\n\n\"How very astonishing!\" cried he at length. \"Why your writing exactly\nresembles that of the accusation.\"\n\n\"Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand; and\nI have noticed that\"--\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That while the writing of different persons done with the right hand\nvaries, that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform.\"\n\n\"You have evidently seen and observed everything.\"\n\n\"Let us proceed.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes!\"\n\n\"Now as regards the second question.\"\n\n\"I am listening.\"\n\n\"Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage\nwith Mercedes?\"\n\n\"Yes; a young man who loved her.\"\n\n\"And his name was\"--\n\n\"Fernand.\"\n\n\"That is a Spanish name, I think?\"\n\n\"He was a Catalan.\"\n\n\"You imagine him capable of writing the letter?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife\ninto me.\"\n\n\"That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character; an\nassassination they will unhesitatingly commit, but an act of cowardice,\nnever.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said Dantes, \"the various circumstances mentioned in the\nletter were wholly unknown to him.\"\n\n\"You had never spoken of them yourself to any one?\"\n\n\"To no one.\"\n\n\"Not even to your mistress?\"\n\n\"No, not even to my betrothed.\"\n\n\"Then it is Danglars.\"\n\n\"I feel quite sure of it now.\"\n\n\"Wait a little. Pray, was Danglars acquainted with Fernand?\"\n\n\"No--yes, he was. Now I recollect\"--\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"To have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at Pere\nPamphile's the evening before the day fixed for my wedding. They were in\nearnest conversation. Danglars was joking in a friendly way, but Fernand\nlooked pale and agitated.\"\n\n\"Were they alone?\"\n\n\"There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well, and who\nhad, in all probability made their acquaintance; he was a tailor named\nCaderousse, but he was very drunk. Stay!--stay!--How strange that it\nshould not have occurred to me before! Now I remember quite well, that\non the table round which they were sitting were pens, ink, and paper.\nOh, the heartless, treacherous scoundrels!\" exclaimed Dantes, pressing\nhis hand to his throbbing brows.\n\n\"Is there anything else I can assist you in discovering, besides the\nvillany of your friends?\" inquired the abbe with a laugh.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" replied Dantes eagerly; \"I would beg of you, who see so\ncompletely to the depths of things, and to whom the greatest mystery\nseems but an easy riddle, to explain to me how it was that I underwent\nno second examination, was never brought to trial, and, above all, was\ncondemned without ever having had sentence passed on me?\"\n\n\"That is altogether a different and more serious matter,\" responded the\nabbe. \"The ways of justice are frequently too dark and mysterious to\nbe easily penetrated. All we have hitherto done in the matter has been\nchild's play. If you wish me to enter upon the more difficult part of\nthe business, you must assist me by the most minute information on every\npoint.\"\n\n\"Pray ask me whatever questions you please; for, in good truth, you see\nmore clearly into my life than I do myself.\"\n\n\"In the first place, then, who examined you,--the king's attorney, his\ndeputy, or a magistrate?\"\n\n\"The deputy.\"\n\n\"Was he young or old?\"\n\n\"About six or seven and twenty years of age, I should say.\"\n\n\"So,\" answered the abbe. \"Old enough to be ambitions, but too young to\nbe corrupt. And how did he treat you?\"\n\n\"With more of mildness than severity.\"\n\n\"Did you tell him your whole story?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"And did his conduct change at all in the course of your examination?\"\n\n\"He did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had brought\nme into this scrape. He seemed quite overcome by my misfortune.\"\n\n\"By your misfortune?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored?\"\n\n\"He gave me one great proof of his sympathy, at any rate.\"\n\n\"And that?\"\n\n\"He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me.\"\n\n\"What? the accusation?\"\n\n\"No; the letter.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"I saw it done.\"\n\n\"That alters the case. This man might, after all, be a greater scoundrel\nthan you have thought possible.\"\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Dantes, \"you make me shudder. Is the world filled\nwith tigers and crocodiles?\"\n\n\"Yes; and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more\ndangerous than the others.\"\n\n\"Never mind; let us go on.\"\n\n\"With all my heart! You tell me he burned the letter?\"\n\n\"He did; saying at the same time, 'You see I thus destroy the only proof\nexisting against you.'\"\n\n\"This action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it. To whom was this letter addressed?\"\n\n\"To M. Noirtier, No. 13 Coq-Heron, Paris.\"\n\n\"Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could\npossibly have had in the destruction of that letter?\"\n\n\"Why, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made me\npromise several times never to speak of that letter to any one, assuring\nme he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he\ninsisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in\nthe address.\"\n\n\"Noirtier!\" repeated the abbe; \"Noirtier!--I knew a person of that\nname at the court of the Queen of Etruria,--a Noirtier, who had been a\nGirondin during the Revolution! What was your deputy called?\"\n\n\"De Villefort!\" The abbe burst into a fit of laughter, while Dantes\ngazed on him in utter astonishment.\n\n\"What ails you?\" said he at length.\n\n\"Do you see that ray of sunlight?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Well, the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you.\nPoor fellow! poor young man! And you tell me this magistrate expressed\ngreat sympathy and commiseration for you?\"\n\n\"He did.\"\n\n\"And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why, you poor short-sighted simpleton, can you not guess who this\nNoirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed?\nNoirtier was his father.\"\n\nHad a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dantes, or hell opened its\nyawning gulf before him, he could not have been more completely\ntransfixed with horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected\nwords. Starting up, he clasped his hands around his head as though to\nprevent his very brain from bursting, and exclaimed, \"His father! his\nfather!\"\n\n\"Yes, his father,\" replied the abbe; \"his right name was Noirtier de\nVillefort.\" At this instant a bright light shot through the mind of\nDantes, and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before.\nThe change that had come over Villefort during the examination, the\ndestruction of the letter, the exacted promise, the almost supplicating\ntones of the magistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy than to\npronounce punishment,--all returned with a stunning force to his memory.\nHe cried out, and staggered against the wall like a drunken man, then\nhe hurried to the opening that led from the abbe's cell to his own, and\nsaid, \"I must be alone, to think over all this.\"\n\nWhen he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his bed, where the\nturnkey found him in the evening visit, sitting with fixed gaze and\ncontracted features, dumb and motionless as a statue. During these hours\nof profound meditation, which to him had seemed only minutes, he had\nformed a fearful resolution, and bound himself to its fulfilment by a\nsolemn oath.\n\nDantes was at length roused from his revery by the voice of Faria,\nwho, having also been visited by his jailer, had come to invite his\nfellow-sufferer to share his supper. The reputation of being out of his\nmind, though harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the\nabbe unusual privileges. He was supplied with bread of a finer, whiter\nquality than the usual prison fare, and even regaled each Sunday with a\nsmall quantity of wine. Now this was a Sunday, and the abbe had come to\nask his young companion to share the luxuries with him. Dantes followed;\nhis features were no longer contracted, and now wore their usual\nexpression, but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one\nwho had come to a fixed and desperate resolve. Faria bent on him his\npenetrating eye: \"I regret now,\" said he, \"having helped you in your\nlate inquiries, or having given you the information I did.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" inquired Dantes.\n\n\"Because it has instilled a new passion in your heart--that of\nvengeance.\"\n\nDantes smiled. \"Let us talk of something else,\" said he.\n\nAgain the abbe looked at him, then mournfully shook his head; but in\naccordance with Dantes' request, he began to speak of other matters. The\nelder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation, like that\nof all who have experienced many trials, contained many useful\nand important hints as well as sound information; but it was never\negotistical, for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows.\nDantes listened with admiring attention to all he said; some of his\nremarks corresponded with what he already knew, or applied to the sort\nof knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire. A part of the\ngood abbe's words, however, were wholly incomprehensible to him; but,\nlike the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes, opened\nnew vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener, and gave fantastic\nglimpses of new horizons, enabling him justly to estimate the delight an\nintellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as Faria\nalong the heights of truth, where he was so much at home.\n\n\"You must teach me a small part of what you know,\" said Dantes, \"if only\nto prevent your growing weary of me. I can well believe that so learned\na person as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented\nwith the company of one as ignorant and uninformed as myself. If you\nwill only agree to my request, I promise you never to mention another\nword about escaping.\" The abbe smiled. \"Alas, my boy,\" said he, \"human\nknowledge is confined within very narrow limits; and when I have\ntaught you mathematics, physics, history, and the three or four modern\nlanguages with which I am acquainted, you will know as much as I do\nmyself. Now, it will scarcely require two years for me to communicate to\nyou the stock of learning I possess.\"\n\n\"Two years!\" exclaimed Dantes; \"do you really believe I can acquire all\nthese things in so short a time?\"\n\n\"Not their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to\nlearn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned. Memory\nmakes the one, philosophy the other.\"\n\n\"But cannot one learn philosophy?\"\n\n\"Philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences to\ntruth; it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into\nheaven.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Dantes, \"What shall you teach me first? I am in a\nhurry to begin. I want to learn.\"\n\n\"Everything,\" said the abbe. And that very evening the prisoners\nsketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following day.\nDantes possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing\nquickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his\nmind rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally\npoetical feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality\nof arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He\nalready knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic\ndialect during voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two\nlanguages he easily comprehended the construction of all the others, so\nthat at the end of six months he began to speak Spanish, English, and\nGerman. In strict accordance with the promise made to the abbe, Dantes\nspoke no more of escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him\nleft no room for such thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had\npledged his word (on which his sense of honor was keen) kept him from\nreferring in any way to the possibilities of flight. Days, even months,\npassed by unheeded in one rapid and instructive course. At the end of\na year Dantes was a new man. Dantes observed, however, that Faria, in\nspite of the relief his society afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought\nseemed incessantly to harass and distract his mind. Sometimes he would\nfall into long reveries, sigh heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly\nrise, and, with folded arms, begin pacing the confined space of his\ndungeon. One day he stopped all at once, and exclaimed, \"Ah, if there\nwere no sentinel!\"\n\n\"There shall not be one a minute longer than you please,\" said Dantes,\nwho had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as though\nhis brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest\noperations.\n\n\"I have already told you,\" answered the abbe, \"that I loathe the idea of\nshedding blood.\"\n\n\"And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a\nmeasure of self-preservation.\"\n\n\"No matter! I could never agree to it.\"\n\n\"Still, you have thought of it?\"\n\n\"Incessantly, alas!\" cried the abbe.\n\n\"And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you\nnot?\" asked Dantes eagerly.\n\n\"I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel in\nthe gallery beyond us.\"\n\n\"He shall be both blind and deaf,\" replied the young man, with an air of\ndetermination that made his companion shudder.\n\n\"No, no,\" cried the abbe; \"impossible!\" Dantes endeavored to renew the\nsubject; the abbe shook his head in token of disapproval, and refused to\nmake any further response. Three months passed away.\n\n\"Are you strong?\" the abbe asked one day of Dantes. The young man, in\nreply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe, and\nthen as readily straightened it.\n\n\"And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a last\nresort?\"\n\n\"I promise on my honor.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the abbe, \"we may hope to put our design into execution.\"\n\n\"And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?\"\n\n\"At least a year.\"\n\n\"And shall we begin at once?\"\n\n\"At once.\"\n\n\"We have lost a year to no purpose!\" cried Dantes.\n\n\"Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?\" asked the\nabbe.\n\n\"Forgive me!\" cried Edmond, blushing deeply.\n\n\"Tut, tut!\" answered the abbe, \"man is but man after all, and you are\nabout the best specimen of the genus I have ever known. Come, let me\nshow you my plan.\" The abbe then showed Dantes the sketch he had made\nfor their escape. It consisted of a plan of his own cell and that of\nDantes, with the passage which united them. In this passage he proposed\nto drive a level as they do in mines; this level would bring the two\nprisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch;\nonce there, a large excavation would be made, and one of the flag-stones\nwith which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the\ndesired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the soldier, who,\nstunned by his fall, would be immediately bound and gagged by Dantes\nbefore he had power to offer any resistance. The prisoners were then to\nmake their way through one of the gallery windows, and to let themselves\ndown from the outer walls by means of the abbe's ladder of cords.\nDantes' eyes sparkled with joy, and he rubbed his hands with delight at\nthe idea of a plan so simple, yet apparently so certain to succeed.\n\nThat very day the miners began their labors, with a vigor and alacrity\nproportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of\nultimate success. Nothing interrupted the progress of the work\nexcept the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in\nanticipation of the turnkey's visits. They had learned to distinguish\nthe almost imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards\ntheir dungeons, and happily, never failed of being prepared for his\ncoming. The fresh earth excavated during their present work, and which\nwould have entirely blocked up the old passage, was thrown, by degrees\nand with the utmost precaution, out of the window in either Faria's\nor Dantes' cell, the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the\nnight wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to\nremain. More than a year had been consumed in this undertaking, the only\ntools for which had been a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever; Faria\nstill continuing to instruct Dantes by conversing with him, sometimes\nin one language, sometimes in another; at others, relating to him the\nhistory of nations and great men who from time to time have risen to\nfame and trodden the path of glory.\n\nThe abbe was a man of the world, and had, moreover, mixed in the first\nsociety of the day; he wore an air of melancholy dignity which Dantes,\nthanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature, easily\nacquired, as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before\nbeen wanting in, and which is seldom possessed except by those who\nhave been placed in constant intercourse with persons of high birth and\nbreeding. At the end of fifteen months the level was finished, and the\nexcavation completed beneath the gallery, and the two workmen could\ndistinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and\nfro over their heads.\n\nCompelled, as they were, to await a night sufficiently dark to favor\ntheir flight, they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that\nauspicious moment should arrive; their greatest dread now was lest the\nstone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before\nits right time, and this they had in some measure provided against by\npropping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the\nwalls through which they had worked their way. Dantes was occupied in\narranging this piece of wood when he heard Faria, who had remained\nin Edmond's cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their\nrope-ladder, call to him in a tone indicative of great suffering. Dantes\nhastened to his dungeon, where he found him standing in the middle of\nthe room, pale as death, his forehead streaming with perspiration, and\nhis hands clinched tightly together.\n\n\"Gracious heavens!\" exclaimed Dantes, \"what is the matter? what has\nhappened?\"\n\n\"Quick! quick!\" returned the abbe, \"listen to what I have to say.\"\nDantes looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria,\nwhose eyes, already dull and sunken, were surrounded by purple circles,\nwhile his lips were white as those of a corpse, and his very hair seemed\nto stand on end.\n\n\"Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?\" cried Dantes, letting his\nchisel fall to the floor.\n\n\"Alas,\" faltered out the abbe, \"all is over with me. I am seized with a\nterrible, perhaps mortal illness; I can feel that the paroxysm is\nfast approaching. I had a similar attack the year previous to my\nimprisonment. This malady admits but of one remedy; I will tell you what\nthat is. Go into my cell as quickly as you can; draw out one of the feet\nthat support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out for the\npurpose of containing a small phial you will see there half-filled with\na red-looking fluid. Bring it to me--or rather--no, no!--I may be found\nhere, therefore help me back to my room while I have the strength to\ndrag myself along. Who knows what may happen, or how long the attack may\nlast?\"\n\nIn spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly\nfrustrated his hopes, Dantes did not lose his presence of mind, but\ndescended into the passage, dragging his unfortunate companion with him;\nthen, half-carrying, half-supporting him, he managed to reach the abbe's\nchamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed.\n\n\"Thanks,\" said the poor abbe, shivering as though his veins were filled\nwith ice. \"I am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy; when it\ncomes to its height I shall probably lie still and motionless as though\ndead, uttering neither sigh nor groan. On the other hand, the symptoms\nmay be much more violent, and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions,\nfoam at the mouth, and cry out loudly. Take care my cries are not heard,\nfor if they are it is more than probable I should be removed to another\npart of the prison, and we be separated forever. When I become quite\nmotionless, cold, and rigid as a corpse, then, and not before,--be\ncareful about this,--force open my teeth with the knife, pour from eight\nto ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat, and I\nmay perhaps revive.\"\n\n\"Perhaps!\" exclaimed Dantes in grief-stricken tones.\n\n\"Help! help!\" cried the abbe, \"I--I--die--I\"--\n\nSo sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was\nunable to complete the sentence; a violent convulsion shook his whole\nframe, his eyes started from their sockets, his mouth was drawn on one\nside, his cheeks became purple, he struggled, foamed, dashed himself\nabout, and uttered the most dreadful cries, which, however, Dantes\nprevented from being heard by covering his head with the blanket. The\nfit lasted two hours; then, more helpless than an infant, and colder and\npaler than marble, more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under\nfoot, he fell back, doubled up in one last convulsion, and became as\nrigid as a corpse.\n\nEdmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then,\ntaking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely\nfixed jaws, carefully administered the appointed number of drops, and\nanxiously awaited the result. An hour passed away and the old man gave\nno sign of returning animation. Dantes began to fear he had delayed too\nlong ere he administered the remedy, and, thrusting his hands into his\nhair, continued gazing on the lifeless features of his friend. At length\na slight color tinged the livid cheeks, consciousness returned to the\ndull, open eyeballs, a faint sigh issued from the lips, and the sufferer\nmade a feeble effort to move.\n\n\"He is saved! he is saved!\" cried Dantes in a paroxysm of delight.\n\nThe sick man was not yet able to speak, but he pointed with evident\nanxiety towards the door. Dantes listened, and plainly distinguished the\napproaching steps of the jailer. It was therefore near seven o'clock;\nbut Edmond's anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head. The\nyoung man sprang to the entrance, darted through it, carefully drawing\nthe stone over the opening, and hurried to his cell. He had scarcely\ndone so before the door opened, and the jailer saw the prisoner seated\nas usual on the side of his bed. Almost before the key had turned in the\nlock, and before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in\nthe long corridor he had to traverse, Dantes, whose restless anxiety\nconcerning his friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him,\nhurried back to the abbe's chamber, and raising the stone by pressing\nhis head against it, was soon beside the sick man's couch. Faria had\nnow fully regained his consciousness, but he still lay helpless and\nexhausted.\n\n\"I did not expect to see you again,\" said he feebly, to Dantes.\n\n\"And why not?\" asked the young man. \"Did you fancy yourself dying?\"\n\n\"No, I had no such idea; but, knowing that all was ready for flight, I\nthought you might have made your escape.\" The deep glow of indignation\nsuffused the cheeks of Dantes.\n\n\"Without you? Did you really think me capable of that?\"\n\n\"At least,\" said the abbe, \"I now see how wrong such an opinion would\nhave been. Alas, alas! I am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this\nattack.\"\n\n\"Be of good cheer,\" replied Dantes; \"your strength will return.\" And\nas he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside Faria, and took his\nhands. The abbe shook his head.\n\n\"The last attack I had,\" said he, \"lasted but half an hour, and after it\nI was hungry, and got up without help; now I can move neither my right\narm nor leg, and my head seems uncomfortable, which shows that there\nhas been a suffusion of blood on the brain. The third attack will either\ncarry me off, or leave me paralyzed for life.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" cried Dantes; \"you are mistaken--you will not die! And your\nthird attack (if, indeed, you should have another) will find you at\nliberty. We shall save you another time, as we have done this, only with\na better chance of success, because we shall be able to command every\nrequisite assistance.\"\n\n\"My good Edmond,\" answered the abbe, \"be not deceived. The attack which\nhas just passed away, condemns me forever to the walls of a prison. None\ncan fly from a dungeon who cannot walk.\"\n\n\"Well, we will wait,--a week, a month, two months, if need be,--and\nmeanwhile your strength will return. Everything is in readiness for our\nflight, and we can select any time we choose. As soon as you feel able\nto swim we will go.\"\n\n\"I shall never swim again,\" replied Faria. \"This arm is paralyzed; not\nfor a time, but forever. Lift it, and judge if I am mistaken.\" The\nyoung man raised the arm, which fell back by its own weight, perfectly\ninanimate and helpless. A sigh escaped him.\n\n\"You are convinced now, Edmond, are you not?\" asked the abbe. \"Depend\nupon it, I know what I say. Since the first attack I experienced of this\nmalady, I have continually reflected on it. Indeed, I expected it, for\nit is a family inheritance; both my father and grandfather died of it\nin a third attack. The physician who prepared for me the remedy I have\ntwice successfully taken, was no other than the celebrated Cabanis, and\nhe predicted a similar end for me.\"\n\n\"The physician may be mistaken!\" exclaimed Dantes. \"And as for your poor\narm, what difference will that make? I can take you on my shoulders, and\nswim for both of us.\"\n\n\"My son,\" said the abbe, \"you, who are a sailor and a swimmer, must know\nas well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before he had done fifty\nstrokes. Cease, then, to allow yourself to be duped by vain hopes, that\neven your own excellent heart refuses to believe in. Here I shall\nremain till the hour of my deliverance arrives, and that, in all human\nprobability, will be the hour of my death. As for you, who are young\nand active, delay not on my account, but fly--go--I give you back your\npromise.\"\n\n\"It is well,\" said Dantes. \"Then I shall also remain.\" Then, rising and\nextending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old man's head, he\nslowly added, \"By the blood of Christ I swear never to leave you while\nyou live.\"\n\nFaria gazed fondly on his noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled\nyoung friend, and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the\nsincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose.\n\n\"Thanks,\" murmured the invalid, extending one hand. \"I accept. You may\none of these days reap the reward of your disinterested devotion. But\nas I cannot, and you will not, quit this place, it becomes necessary\nto fill up the excavation beneath the soldier's gallery; he might, by\nchance, hear the hollow sound of his footsteps, and call the attention\nof his officer to the circumstance. That would bring about a discovery\nwhich would inevitably lead to our being separated. Go, then, and set\nabout this work, in which, unhappily, I can offer you no assistance;\nkeep at it all night, if necessary, and do not return here to-morrow\ntill after the jailer his visited me. I shall have something of the\ngreatest importance to communicate to you.\"\n\nDantes took the hand of the abbe in his, and affectionately pressed\nit. Faria smiled encouragingly on him, and the young man retired to his\ntask, in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show\ntowards his aged friend.\n\n\n\nChapter 18. The Treasure.\n\nWhen Dantes returned next morning to the chamber of his companion in\ncaptivity, he found Faria seated and looking composed. In the ray of\nlight which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in\nhis left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the\nuse, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small\ncompass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open. He\ndid not speak, but showed the paper to Dantes.\n\n\"What is that?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Look at it,\" said the abbe with a smile.\n\n\"I have looked at it with all possible attention,\" said Dantes, \"and I\nonly see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters\ninscribed with a peculiar kind of ink.\"\n\n\"This paper, my friend,\" said Faria, \"I may now avow to you, since I\nhave the proof of your fidelity--this paper is my treasure, of which,\nfrom this day forth, one-half belongs to you.\"\n\nThe sweat started forth on Dantes brow. Until this day and for how\nlong a time!--he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had\nbrought upon the abbe the accusation of madness. With his instinctive\ndelicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord,\nand Faria had been equally silent. He had taken the silence of the old\nman for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by Faria,\nafter so painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into\nmental alienation.\n\n\"Your treasure?\" stammered Dantes. Faria smiled.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he. \"You have, indeed, a noble nature, Edmond, and I see\nby your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this\nmoment. No, be assured, I am not mad. This treasure exists, Dantes, and\nif I have not been allowed to possess it, you will. Yes--you. No one\nwould listen or believe me, because everyone thought me mad; but you,\nwho must know that I am not, listen to me, and believe me so afterwards\nif you will.\"\n\n\"Alas,\" murmured Edmond to himself, \"this is a terrible relapse! There\nwas only this blow wanting.\" Then he said aloud, \"My dear friend, your\nattack has, perhaps, fatigued you; had you not better repose awhile?\nTo-morrow, if you will, I will hear your narrative; but to-day I wish\nto nurse you carefully. Besides,\" he said, \"a treasure is not a thing we\nneed hurry about.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it is a matter of the utmost importance, Edmond!\"\nreplied the old man. \"Who knows if to-morrow, or the next day after,\nthe third attack may not come on? and then must not all be over? Yes,\nindeed, I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches, which\nwould make the wealth of a dozen families, will be forever lost to those\nmen who persecute me. This idea was one of vengeance to me, and I tasted\nit slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity.\nBut now I have forgiven the world for the love of you; now that I see\nyou, young and with a promising future,--now that I think of all that\nmay result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure, I shudder\nat any delay, and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as\nyourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth.\" Edmond\nturned away his head with a sigh.\n\n\"You persist in your incredulity, Edmond,\" continued Faria. \"My words\nhave not convinced you. I see you require proofs. Well, then, read this\npaper, which I have never shown to any one.\"\n\n\"To-morrow, my dear friend,\" said Edmond, desirous of not yielding to\nthe old man's madness. \"I thought it was understood that we should not\ntalk of that until to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Then we will not talk of it until to-morrow; but read this paper\nto-day.\"\n\n\"I will not irritate him,\" thought Edmond, and taking the paper,\nof which half was wanting,--having been burnt, no doubt, by some\naccident,--he read:--\n\n\"This treasure, which may amount to two... of Roman crowns in the most\ndistant a... of the second opening wh... declare to belong to him alo...\nheir. \"25th April, 149-\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Faria, when the young man had finished reading it.\n\n\"Why,\" replied Dantes, \"I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected\nwords, which are rendered illegible by fire.\"\n\n\"Yes, to you, my friend, who read them for the first time; but not\nfor me, who have grown pale over them by many nights' study, and have\nreconstructed every phrase, completed every thought.\"\n\n\"And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?\"\n\n\"I am sure I have, and you shall judge for yourself; but first listen to\nthe history of this paper.\"\n\n\"Silence!\" exclaimed Dantes. \"Steps approach--I go--adieu.\"\n\nAnd Dantes, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be\nsure to confirm his belief in his friend's mental instability, glided\nlike a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his\nalarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with\nhis foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to\navoid discovery.\n\nIt was the governor, who, hearing of Faria's illness from the jailer,\nhad come in person to see him.\n\nFaria sat up to receive him, avoiding all gestures in order that he\nmight conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half\nstricken him with death. His fear was lest the governor, touched\nwith pity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus\nseparate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the\ncase, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for\nwhom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a\nslight indisposition.\n\nDuring this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands,\ntried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first\nacquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so\nwonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so much\nwisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria deceived as\nto his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria?\n\nDantes remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his friend,\nthinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced, once for\nall, that the abbe was mad--such a conviction would be so terrible!\n\nBut, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone\nby, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get over\nthe distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard the\npainful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his\nleg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was\nobliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to\nenter by the small aperture which led to Dantes' chamber.\n\n\"Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly,\" he said with a benignant smile.\n\"You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain. Listen to me.\"\n\nEdmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he\nseated himself on the stool beside him.\n\n\"You know,\" said the abbe, \"that I was the secretary and intimate friend\nof Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe to this\nworthy lord all the happiness I ever knew. He was not rich, although the\nwealth of his family had passed into a proverb, and I heard the phrase\nvery often, 'As rich as a Spada.' But he, like public rumor, lived on\nthis reputation for wealth; his palace was my paradise. I was tutor to\nhis nephews, who are dead; and when he was alone in the world, I tried\nby absolute devotion to his will, to make up to him all he had done for\nme during ten years of unremitting kindness. The cardinal's house had\nno secrets for me. I had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient\nvolumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts. One day\nwhen I was reproaching him for his unavailing searches, and deploring\nthe prostration of mind that followed them, he looked at me, and,\nsmiling bitterly, opened a volume relating to the History of the City of\nRome. There, in the twentieth chapter of the Life of Pope Alexander VI.,\nwere the following lines, which I can never forget:--\n\n\"'The great wars of Romagna had ended; Caesar Borgia, who had completed\nhis conquest, had need of money to purchase all Italy. The pope had also\nneed of money to bring matters to an end with Louis XII. King of France,\nwho was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses; and it was\nnecessary, therefore, to have recourse to some profitable scheme,\nwhich was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition\nof exhausted Italy. His holiness had an idea. He determined to make two\ncardinals.'\n\n\"By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome, especially rich\nmen--this was the return the holy father looked for. In the first place,\nhe could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the\ncardinals already held; and then he had the two hats to sell besides.\nThere was a third point in view, which will appear hereafter. The\npope and Caesar Borgia first found the two future cardinals; they were\nGiovanni Rospigliosi, who held four of the highest dignities of the\nHoly See, and Caesar Spada, one of the noblest and richest of the Roman\nnobility; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope.\nThey were ambitious, and Caesar Borgia soon found purchasers for their\nappointments. The result was, that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being\ncardinals, and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals\nheld before their elevation, and thus eight hundred thousand crowns\nentered into the coffers of the speculators.\n\n\"It is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation. The pope\nheaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada, conferred upon them the\ninsignia of the cardinalate, and induced them to arrange their affairs\nand take up their residence at Rome. Then the pope and Caesar Borgia\ninvited the two cardinals to dinner. This was a matter of dispute\nbetween the holy father and his son. Caesar thought they could make use\nof one of the means which he always had ready for his friends, that is\nto say, in the first place, the famous key which was given to certain\npersons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard.\nThis key was furnished with a small iron point,--a negligence on the\npart of the locksmith. When this was pressed to effect the opening of\nthe cupboard, of which the lock was difficult, the person was pricked\nby this small point, and died next day. Then there was the ring with the\nlion's head, which Caesar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with\na clasp of the hand. The lion bit the hand thus favored, and at the\nend of twenty-four hours, the bite was mortal. Caesar proposed to his\nfather, that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard,\nor shake hands with them; but Alexander VI., replied: 'Now as to the\nworthy cardinals, Spada and Rospigliosi, let us ask both of them to\ndinner, something tells me that we shall get that money back. Besides,\nyou forget, Caesar, an indigestion declares itself immediately, while\na prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two.' Caesar gave\nway before such cogent reasoning, and the cardinals were consequently\ninvited to dinner.\n\n\"The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope, near San\nPierdarena, a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by\nreport. Rospigliosi, quite set up with his new dignities, went with a\ngood appetite and his most ingratiating manner. Spada, a prudent man,\nand greatly attached to his only nephew, a young captain of the highest\npromise, took paper and pen, and made his will. He then sent word to his\nnephew to wait for him near the vineyard; but it appeared the servant\ndid not find him.\n\n\"Spada knew what these invitations meant; since Christianity, so\neminently civilizing, had made progress in Rome, it was no longer a\ncenturion who came from the tyrant with a message, 'Caesar wills that\nyou die.' but it was a legate a latere, who came with a smile on his\nlips to say from the pope, 'His holiness requests you to dine with him.'\n\n\"Spada set out about two o'clock to San Pierdarena. The pope awaited\nhim. The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of\nhis nephew, in full costume, and Caesar Borgia paying him most marked\nattentions. Spada turned pale, as Caesar looked at him with an ironical\nair, which proved that he had anticipated all, and that the snare was\nwell spread. They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his\nnephew if he had received his message. The nephew replied no; perfectly\ncomprehending the meaning of the question. It was too late, for he had\nalready drunk a glass of excellent wine, placed for him expressly by the\npope's butler. Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him,\nwhich he was pressed to taste. An hour afterwards a physician declared\nthey were both poisoned through eating mushrooms. Spada died on the\nthreshold of the vineyard; the nephew expired at his own door, making\nsigns which his wife could not comprehend.\n\n\"Then Caesar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage, under\npresence of seeking for the papers of the dead man. But the inheritance\nconsisted in this only, a scrap of paper on which Spada had written:--'I\nbequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers, my books, and, amongst others,\nmy breviary with the gold corners, which I beg he will preserve in\nremembrance of his affectionate uncle.'\n\n\"The heirs sought everywhere, admired the breviary, laid hands on the\nfurniture, and were greatly astonished that Spada, the rich man, was\nreally the most miserable of uncles--no treasures--unless they were\nthose of science, contained in the library and laboratories. That was\nall. Caesar and his father searched, examined, scrutinized, but found\nnothing, or at least very little; not exceeding a few thousand crowns in\nplate, and about the same in ready money; but the nephew had time to say\nto his wife before he expired: 'Look well among my uncle's papers; there\nis a will.'\n\n\"They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done, but it\nwas fruitless. There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the Palatine\nHill; but in these days landed property had not much value, and the two\npalaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath\nthe rapacity of the pope and his son. Months and years rolled on.\nAlexander VI. died, poisoned,--you know by what mistake. Caesar,\npoisoned at the same time, escaped by shedding his skin like a snake;\nbut the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a\ntiger's. Then, compelled to quit Rome, he went and got himself obscurely\nkilled in a night skirmish, scarcely noticed in history. After the\npope's death and his son's exile, it was supposed that the Spada family\nwould resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinal's\ntime; but this was not the case. The Spadas remained in doubtful ease,\na mystery hung over this dark affair, and the public rumor was, that\nCaesar, a better politician than his father, had carried off from the\npope the fortune of the two cardinals. I say the two, because Cardinal\nRospigliosi, who had not taken any precaution, was completely despoiled.\n\n\"Up to this point,\" said Faria, interrupting the thread of his\nnarrative, \"this seems to you very meaningless, no doubt, eh?\"\n\n\"Oh, my friend,\" cried Dantes, \"on the contrary, it seems as if I were\nreading a most interesting narrative; go on, I beg of you.\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity. Years rolled\non, and amongst the descendants some were soldiers, others diplomatists;\nsome churchmen, some bankers; some grew rich, and some were ruined. I\ncome now to the last of the family, whose secretary I was--the Count of\nSpada. I had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank\nwith his fortune; and I advised him to invest all he had in an annuity.\nHe did so, and thus doubled his income. The celebrated breviary remained\nin the family, and was in the count's possession. It had been handed\ndown from father to son; for the singular clause of the only will\nthat had been found, had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic,\npreserved in the family with superstitious veneration. It was an\nilluminated book, with beautiful Gothic characters, and so weighty with\ngold, that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of\ngreat solemnity.\n\n\"At the sight of papers of all sorts,--titles, contracts, parchments,\nwhich were kept in the archives of the family, all descending from\nthe poisoned cardinal, I in my turn examined the immense bundles of\ndocuments, like twenty servitors, stewards, secretaries before me; but\nin spite of the most exhaustive researches, I found--nothing. Yet I had\nread, I had even written a precise history of the Borgia family, for\nthe sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had\noccurred to them on the death of the Cardinal Caesar Spada; but could\nonly trace the acquisition of the property of the Cardinal Rospigliosi,\nhis companion in misfortune.\n\n\"I was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the\nBorgias nor the family, but had remained unpossessed like the treasures\nof the Arabian Nights, which slept in the bosom of the earth under the\neyes of the genie. I searched, ransacked, counted, calculated a thousand\nand a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three\nhundred years. It was useless. I remained in my ignorance, and the\nCount of Spada in his poverty. My patron died. He had reserved from\nhis annuity his family papers, his library, composed of five thousand\nvolumes, and his famous breviary. All these he bequeathed to me, with a\nthousand Roman crowns, which he had in ready money, on condition that I\nwould have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul, and that\nI would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house. All this I\ndid scrupulously. Be easy, my dear Edmond, we are near the conclusion.\n\n\"In 1807, a month before I was arrested, and a fortnight after the death\nof the Count of Spada, on the 25th of December (you will see presently\nhow the date became fixed in my memory), I was reading, for the\nthousandth time, the papers I was arranging, for the palace was sold\nto a stranger, and I was going to leave Rome and settle at Florence,\nintending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed, my\nlibrary, and the famous breviary, when, tired with my constant labor\nat the same thing, and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten, my\nhead dropped on my hands, and I fell asleep about three o'clock in the\nafternoon. I awoke as the clock was striking six. I raised my head;\nI was in utter darkness. I rang for a light, but as no one came, I\ndetermined to find one for myself. It was indeed but anticipating the\nsimple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting.\nI took a wax-candle in one hand, and with the other groped about for a\npiece of paper (my match-box being empty), with which I proposed to\nget a light from the small flame still playing on the embers. Fearing,\nhowever, to make use of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a\nmoment, then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which\nwas on the table beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and\nwhich had served as a marker for centuries, kept there by the request of\nthe heirs. I felt for it, found it, twisted it up together, and putting\nit into the expiring flame, set light to it.\n\n\"But beneath my fingers, as if by magic, in proportion as the fire\nascended, I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper. I grasped it\nin my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper\nin the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible\nemotion, recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had been\ntraced in mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when exposed to\nthe fire; nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by the flame.\nIt was that paper you read this morning; read it again, Dantes, and then\nI will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense.\"\n\nFaria, with an air of triumph, offered the paper to Dantes, who this\ntime read the following words, traced with an ink of a reddish color\nresembling rust:--\n\n     \"This 25th day of April, 1498, be...\n     Alexander VI., and fearing that not...\n     he may desire to become my heir, and re...\n     and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned,...\n     my sole heir, that I have bu...\n     and has visited with me, that is, in...\n     Island of Monte Cristo, all I poss...\n     jewels, diamonds, gems; that I alone...\n     may amount to nearly two mil...\n     will find on raising the twentieth ro...\n     creek to the east in a right line.

Two open...ings have been made in these caves;\nthe treasure is in the furthest a...ngle in the second; which treasure I\nbequeath and leave en...tire to him as my sole heir. \"25th April, 1498.\n\"Caes...ar Spada.\"\n\n\"Well, do you comprehend now?\" inquired Faria.\n\n\"It is the declaration of Cardinal Spada, and the will so long sought\nfor,\" replied Edmond, still incredulous.\n\n\"Yes; a thousand times, yes!\"\n\n\"And who completed it as it now is?\"\n\n\"I did. Aided by the remaining fragment, I guessed the rest; measuring\nthe length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden\nmeaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a\ncavern by the small ray of light above us.\"\n\n\"And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?\"\n\n\"I resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying\nwith me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the Italian\nkingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period,\nquite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to\nhim, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my\nhasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having\naroused their suspicions, I was arrested at the very moment I was\nleaving Piombino.\n\n\"Now,\" continued Faria, addressing Dantes with an almost paternal\nexpression, \"now, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself. If\nwe ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here, and\nyou escape alone, the whole belongs to you.\"\n\n\"But,\" inquired Dantes hesitating, \"has this treasure no more legitimate\npossessor in the world than ourselves?\"\n\n\"No, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct. The last Count\nof Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic\nbreviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind\nsatisfied on that point. If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy\nit without remorse.\"\n\n\"And you say this treasure amounts to\"--\n\n\"Two millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our\nmoney.\" [*]\n\n     * $2,600,000 in 1894.\n\n\"Impossible!\" said Dantes, staggered at the enormous amount.\n\n\"Impossible? and why?\" asked the old man. \"The Spada family was one of\nthe oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in\nthose times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such\naccumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at\nthis day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly\na million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they\ncannot touch.\" Edmond thought he was in a dream--he wavered between\nincredulity and joy.\n\n\"I have only kept this secret so long from you,\" continued Faria, \"that\nI might test your character, and then surprise you. Had we escaped\nbefore my attack of catalepsy, I should have conducted you to Monte\nCristo; now,\" he added, with a sigh, \"it is you who will conduct me\nthither. Well, Dantes, you do not thank me?\"\n\n\"This treasure belongs to you, my dear friend,\" replied Dantes, \"and to\nyou only. I have no right to it. I am no relation of yours.\"\n\n\"You are my son, Dantes,\" exclaimed the old man. \"You are the child of\nmy captivity. My profession condemns me to celibacy. God has sent you\nto me to console, at one and the same time, the man who could not be a\nfather, and the prisoner who could not get free.\" And Faria extended the\narm of which alone the use remained to him to the young man who threw\nhimself upon his neck and wept.\n\n\n\nChapter 19. The Third Attack.\n\nNow that this treasure, which had so long been the object of the abbe's\nmeditations, could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really\nloved as a son, it had doubled its value in his eyes, and every day he\nexpatiated on the amount, explaining to Dantes all the good which, with\nthirteen or fourteen millions of francs, a man could do in these days to\nhis friends; and then Dantes' countenance became gloomy, for the oath of\nvengeance he had taken recurred to his memory, and he reflected how much\nill, in these times, a man with thirteen or fourteen millions could do\nto his enemies.\n\nThe abbe did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dantes knew\nit, and had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa,\nbetween Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there. This\nisland was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It is a\nrock of almost conical form, which looks as though it had been thrust\nup by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean. Dantes\ndrew a plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantes advice as to\nthe means he should employ to recover the treasure. But Dantes was far\nfrom being as enthusiastic and confident as the old man. It was past a\nquestion now that Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in which he had\nachieved the discovery, which had given rise to the suspicion of his\nmadness, increased Edmond's admiration of him; but at the same time\nDantes could not believe that the deposit, supposing it had ever\nexisted, still existed; and though he considered the treasure as by no\nmeans chimerical, he yet believed it was no longer there.\n\nHowever, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last\nchance, and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual\nimprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on the sea\nside, which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had repaired it\ncompletely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dantes had\npartly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it will be remembered,\nthe abbe had made to Edmond, the misfortune would have been still\ngreater, for their attempt to escape would have been detected, and they\nwould undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a stronger, and more\ninexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their\nhopes.\n\n\"You see,\" said the young man, with an air of sorrowful resignation, to\nFaria, \"that God deems it right to take from me any claim to merit for\nwhat you call my devotion to you. I have promised to remain forever with\nyou, and now I could not break my promise if I would. The treasure will\nbe no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit this prison. But\nmy real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which awaits me beneath\nthe sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence, our living\ntogether five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it is the\nrays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages you\nhave implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with all\ntheir philological ramifications. These different sciences that you have\nmade so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them,\nand the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them--this\nis my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have made me rich\nand happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better for me than tons\nof gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as problematical as\nthe clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea, which we take\nfor terra firma, and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to\nthem. To have you as long as possible near me, to hear your eloquent\nspeech,--which embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul, and makes my\nwhole frame capable of great and terrible things, if I should ever be\nfree,--so fills my whole existence, that the despair to which I was just\non the point of yielding when I knew you, has no longer any hold over\nme; and this--this is my fortune--not chimerical, but actual. I owe you\nmy real good, my present happiness; and all the sovereigns of the earth,\neven Caesar Borgia himself, could not deprive me of this.\"\n\nThus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed\ntogether went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence\nas to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied\nwould be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left\nleg, and had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was\ncontinually thinking over some means of escape for his young companion,\nand anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might\nbe some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantes to learn it by heart;\nand Dantes knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed\nthe second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would\nbe able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed while\nFaria was giving instructions to Dantes,--instructions which were to\nserve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and hour\nand moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought, which\nwas, to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone under\nsome pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to\nendeavor to find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed\nspot,--the appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in\nthe second opening.\n\nIn the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.\nFaria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand\nand foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had\ngradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught\nhis youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner,\nwho learns to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually\nemployed,--Faria, that he might not see himself grow old; Dantes, for\nfear of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his\nmemory like a distant light wandering in the night. So life went on for\nthem as it does for those who are not victims of misfortune and whose\nactivities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of\nprovidence.\n\nBut beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young\nman, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many\nstifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when\nEdmond returned to his cell. One night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing\nthat he heard some one calling him. He opened his eyes upon utter\ndarkness. His name, or rather a plaintive voice which essayed to\npronounce his name, reached him. He sat up in bed and a cold sweat\nbroke out upon his brow. Undoubtedly the call came from Faria's dungeon.\n\"Alas,\" murmured Edmond; \"can it be?\"\n\nHe moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and\nreached the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the\nlight of the wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken, Dantes\nsaw the old man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead. His\nfeatures were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already\nknew, and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the\nfirst time.\n\n\"Alas, my dear friend,\" said Faria in a resigned tone, \"you understand,\ndo you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?\"\n\nEdmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed\ntowards the door, exclaiming, \"Help, help!\" Faria had just sufficient\nstrength to restrain him.\n\n\"Silence,\" he said, \"or you are lost. We must now only think of you, my\ndear friend, and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your\nflight possible. It would require years to do again what I have done\nhere, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our jailers\nknew we had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my dear\nEdmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty; some\nother unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you will\nappear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young, strong, and\nenduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape, while I have\nbeen but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead body tied\nto you as a drag to all your movements. At length providence has done\nsomething for you; he restores to you more than he takes away, and it\nwas time I should die.\"\n\nEdmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, \"Oh, my friend, my\nfriend, speak not thus!\" and then resuming all his presence of mind,\nwhich had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength,\nwhich had failed at the words of the old man, he said, \"Oh, I have saved\nyou once, and I will save you a second time!\" And raising the foot\nof the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the red\nliquor.\n\n\"See,\" he exclaimed, \"there remains still some of the magic draught.\nQuick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there any fresh\ninstructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.\"\n\n\"There is not a hope,\" replied Faria, shaking his head, \"but no matter;\nGod wills it that man whom he has created, and in whose heart he has\nso profoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in his power to\npreserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is yet always\nso dear.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes!\" exclaimed Dantes; \"and I tell you that I will save you\nyet.\"\n\n\"Well, then, try. The cold gains upon me. I feel the blood flowing\ntowards my brain. These horrible chills, which make my teeth chatter\nand seem to dislocate my bones, begin to pervade my whole frame; in five\nminutes the malady will reach its height, and in a quarter of an hour\nthere will be nothing left of me but a corpse.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Dantes, his heart wrung with anguish.\n\n\"Do as you did before, only do not wait so long, all the springs of\nlife are now exhausted in me, and death,\" he continued, looking at his\nparalyzed arm and leg, \"has but half its work to do. If, after having\nmade me swallow twelve drops instead of ten, you see that I do not\nrecover, then pour the rest down my throat. Now lift me on my bed, for I\ncan no longer support myself.\"\n\nEdmond took the old man in his arms, and laid him on the bed.\n\n\"And now, my dear friend,\" said Faria, \"sole consolation of my wretched\nexistence,--you whom heaven gave me somewhat late, but still gave me,\na priceless gift, and for which I am most grateful,--at the moment of\nseparating from you forever, I wish you all the happiness and all the\nprosperity you so well deserve. My son, I bless thee!\" The young man\ncast himself on his knees, leaning his head against the old man's bed.\n\n\"Listen, now, to what I say in this my dying moment. The treasure of the\nSpadas exists. God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time or\nspace. I see it in the depths of the inner cavern. My eyes pierce the\ninmost recesses of the earth, and are dazzled at the sight of so much\nriches. If you do escape, remember that the poor abbe, whom all the\nworld called mad, was not so. Hasten to Monte Cristo--avail yourself\nof the fortune--for you have indeed suffered long enough.\" A violent\nconvulsion attacked the old man. Dantes raised his head and saw Faria's\neyes injected with blood. It seemed as if a flow of blood had ascended\nfrom the chest to the head.\n\n\"Adieu, adieu!\" murmured the old man, clasping Edmond's hand\nconvulsively--\"adieu!\"\n\n\"Oh, no,--no, not yet,\" he cried; \"do not forsake me! Oh, succor him!\nHelp--help--help!\"\n\n\"Hush--hush!\" murmured the dying man, \"that they may not separate us if\nyou save me!\"\n\n\"You are right. Oh, yes, yes; be assured I shall save you! Besides,\nalthough you suffer much, you do not seem to be in such agony as you\nwere before.\"\n\n\"Do not mistake. I suffer less because there is in me less strength to\nendure. At your age we have faith in life; it is the privilege of\nyouth to believe and hope, but old men see death more clearly. Oh, 'tis\nhere--'tis here--'tis over--my sight is gone--my senses fail! Your hand,\nDantes! Adieu--adieu!\" And raising himself by a final effort, in which\nhe summoned all his faculties, he said,--\"Monte Cristo, forget not Monte\nCristo!\" And he fell back on the bed. The crisis was terrible, and a\nrigid form with twisted limbs, swollen eyelids, and lips flecked with\nbloody foam, lay on the bed of torture, in place of the intellectual\nbeing who so lately rested there.\n\nDantes took the lamp, placed it on a projecting stone above the bed,\nwhence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the\ndistorted countenance and motionless, stiffened body. With steady gaze\nhe awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative.\n\nWhen he believed that the right moment had arrived, he took the knife,\npried open the teeth, which offered less resistance than before, counted\none after the other twelve drops, and watched; the phial contained,\nperhaps, twice as much more. He waited ten minutes, a quarter of an\nhour, half an hour,--no change took place. Trembling, his hair erect,\nhis brow bathed with perspiration, he counted the seconds by the beating\nof his heart. Then he thought it was time to make the last trial, and he\nput the phial to the purple lips of Faria, and without having occasion\nto force open his jaws, which had remained extended, he poured the whole\nof the liquid down his throat.\n\nThe draught produced a galvanic effect, a violent trembling pervaded the\nold man's limbs, his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them,\nhe heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek, and then his convulsed body\nreturned gradually to its former immobility, the eyes remaining open.\n\nHalf an hour, an hour, an hour and a half elapsed, and during this\nperiod of anguish, Edmond leaned over his friend, his hand applied\nto his heart, and felt the body gradually grow cold, and the heart's\npulsation become more and more deep and dull, until at length it\nstopped; the last movement of the heart ceased, the face became livid,\nthe eyes remained open, but the eyeballs were glazed. It was six o'clock\nin the morning, the dawn was just breaking, and its feeble ray came\ninto the dungeon, and paled the ineffectual light of the lamp. Strange\nshadows passed over the countenance of the dead man, and at times gave\nit the appearance of life. While the struggle between day and night\nlasted, Dantes still doubted; but as soon as the daylight gained the\npre-eminence, he saw that he was alone with a corpse. Then an invincible\nand extreme terror seized upon him, and he dared not again press the\nhand that hung out of bed, he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed\nand vacant eyes, which he tried many times to close, but in vain--they\nopened again as soon as shut. He extinguished the lamp, carefully\nconcealed it, and then went away, closing as well as he could the\nentrance to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended.\n\nIt was time, for the jailer was coming. On this occasion he began\nhis rounds at Dantes' cell, and on leaving him he went on to Faria's\ndungeon, taking thither breakfast and some linen. Nothing betokened that\nthe man knew anything of what had occurred. He went on his way.\n\nDantes was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was\ngoing on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend. He therefore\nreturned by the subterraneous gallery, and arrived in time to hear the\nexclamations of the turnkey, who called out for help. Other turnkeys\ncame, and then was heard the regular tramp of soldiers. Last of all came\nthe governor.\n\nEdmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse, heard the\nvoice of the governor, who asked them to throw water on the dead man's\nface; and seeing that, in spite of this application, the prisoner did\nnot recover, they sent for the doctor. The governor then went out,\nand words of pity fell on Dantes' listening ears, mingled with brutal\nlaughter.\n\n\"Well, well,\" said one, \"the madman has gone to look after his treasure.\nGood journey to him!\"\n\n\"With all his millions, he will not have enough to pay for his shroud!\"\nsaid another.\n\n\"Oh,\" added a third voice, \"the shrouds of the Chateau d'If are not\ndear!\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said one of the previous speakers, \"as he was a churchman,\nthey may go to some expense in his behalf.\"\n\n\"They may give him the honors of the sack.\"\n\nEdmond did not lose a word, but comprehended very little of what was\nsaid. The voices soon ceased, and it seemed to him as if every one had\nleft the cell. Still he dared not to enter, as they might have left some\nturnkey to watch the dead. He remained, therefore, mute and motionless,\nhardly venturing to breathe. At the end of an hour, he heard a faint\nnoise, which increased. It was the governor who returned, followed by\nthe doctor and other attendants. There was a moment's silence,--it was\nevident that the doctor was examining the dead body. The inquiries soon\ncommenced.\n\nThe doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had\nsuccumbed, and declared that he was dead. Questions and answers followed\nin a nonchalant manner that made Dantes indignant, for he felt that all\nthe world should have for the poor abbe a love and respect equal to his\nown.\n\n\"I am very sorry for what you tell me,\" said the governor, replying to\nthe assurance of the doctor, \"that the old man is really dead; for he\nwas a quiet, inoffensive prisoner, happy in his folly, and required no\nwatching.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" added the turnkey, \"there was no occasion for watching him: he\nwould have stayed here fifty years, I'll answer for it, without any\nattempt to escape.\"\n\n\"Still,\" said the governor, \"I believe it will be requisite,\nnotwithstanding your certainty, and not that I doubt your science, but\nin discharge of my official duty, that we should be perfectly assured\nthat the prisoner is dead.\" There was a moment of complete silence,\nduring which Dantes, still listening, knew that the doctor was examining\nthe corpse a second time.\n\n\"You may make your mind easy,\" said the doctor; \"he is dead. I will\nanswer for that.\"\n\n\"You know, sir,\" said the governor, persisting, \"that we are not content\nin such cases as this with such a simple examination. In spite of all\nappearances, be so kind, therefore, as to finish your duty by fulfilling\nthe formalities described by law.\"\n\n\"Let the irons be heated,\" said the doctor; \"but really it is a useless\nprecaution.\" This order to heat the irons made Dantes shudder. He heard\nhasty steps, the creaking of a door, people going and coming, and some\nminutes afterwards a turnkey entered, saying,--\n\n\"Here is the brazier, lighted.\" There was a moment's silence, and then\nwas heard the crackling of burning flesh, of which the peculiar\nand nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall where Dantes was\nlistening in horror. The perspiration poured forth upon the young man's\nbrow, and he felt as if he should faint.\n\n\"You see, sir, he is really dead,\" said the doctor; \"this burn in the\nheel is decisive. The poor fool is cured of his folly, and delivered\nfrom his captivity.\"\n\n\"Wasn't his name Faria?\" inquired one of the officers who accompanied\nthe governor.\n\n\"Yes, sir; and, as he said, it was an ancient name. He was, too, very\nlearned, and rational enough on all points which did not relate to his\ntreasure; but on that, indeed, he was intractable.\"\n\n\"It is the sort of malady which we call monomania,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"You had never anything to complain of?\" said the governor to the jailer\nwho had charge of the abbe.\n\n\"Never, sir,\" replied the jailer, \"never; on the contrary, he sometimes\namused me very much by telling me stories. One day, too, when my wife\nwas ill, he gave me a prescription which cured her.\"\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" said the doctor, \"I did not know that I had a rival; but I\nhope, governor, that you will show him all proper respect.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, make your mind easy, he shall be decently interred in the\nnewest sack we can find. Will that satisfy you?\"\n\n\"Must this last formality take place in your presence, sir?\" inquired a\nturnkey.\n\n\"Certainly. But make haste--I cannot stay here all day.\" Other\nfootsteps, going and coming, were now heard, and a moment afterwards the\nnoise of rustling canvas reached Dantes' ears, the bed creaked, and the\nheavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor; then\nthe bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it.\n\n\"This evening,\" said the governor.\n\n\"Will there be any mass?\" asked one of the attendants.\n\n\"That is impossible,\" replied the governor. \"The chaplain of the chateau\ncame to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence, in order to take a\ntrip to Hyeres for a week. I told him I would attend to the prisoners\nin his absence. If the poor abbe had not been in such a hurry, he might\nhave had his requiem.\"\n\n\"Pooh, pooh;\" said the doctor, with the impiety usual in persons of his\nprofession; \"he is a churchman. God will respect his profession, and not\ngive the devil the wicked delight of sending him a priest.\" A shout of\nlaughter followed this brutal jest. Meanwhile the operation of putting\nthe body in the sack was going on.\n\n\"This evening,\" said the governor, when the task was ended.\n\n\"At what hour?\" inquired a turnkey.\n\n\"Why, about ten or eleven o'clock.\"\n\n\"Shall we watch by the corpse?\"\n\n\"Of what use would it be? Shut the dungeon as if he were alive--that\nis all.\" Then the steps retreated, and the voices died away in the\ndistance; the noise of the door, with its creaking hinges and bolts\nceased, and a silence more sombre than that of solitude ensued,--the\nsilence of death, which was all-pervasive, and struck its icy chill to\nthe very soul of Dantes. Then he raised the flag-stone cautiously with\nhis head, and looked carefully around the chamber. It was empty, and\nDantes emerged from the tunnel.\n\n\n\nChapter 20. The Cemetery of the Chateau D'If.\n\nOn the bed, at full length, and faintly illuminated by the pale light\nthat came from the window, lay a sack of canvas, and under its rude\nfolds was stretched a long and stiffened form; it was Faria's last\nwinding-sheet,--a winding-sheet which, as the turnkey said, cost so\nlittle. Everything was in readiness. A barrier had been placed between\nDantes and his old friend. No longer could Edmond look into those\nwide-open eyes which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of\ndeath; no longer could he clasp the hand which had done so much to make\nhis existence blessed. Faria, the beneficent and cheerful companion,\nwith whom he was accustomed to live so intimately, no longer breathed.\nHe seated himself on the edge of that terrible bed, and fell into\nmelancholy and gloomy revery.\n\nAlone--he was alone again--again condemned to silence--again face to\nface with nothingness! Alone!--never again to see the face, never again\nto hear the voice of the only human being who united him to earth! Was\nnot Faria's fate the better, after all--to solve the problem of life at\nits source, even at the risk of horrible suffering? The idea of suicide,\nwhich his friend had driven away and kept away by his cheerful presence,\nnow hovered like a phantom over the abbe's dead body.\n\n\"If I could die,\" he said, \"I should go where he goes, and should\nassuredly find him again. But how to die? It is very easy,\" he went on\nwith a smile; \"I will remain here, rush on the first person that opens\nthe door, strangle him, and then they will guillotine me.\" But excessive\ngrief is like a storm at sea, where the frail bark is tossed from the\ndepths to the top of the wave. Dantes recoiled from the idea of so\ninfamous a death, and passed suddenly from despair to an ardent desire\nfor life and liberty.\n\n\"Die? oh, no,\" he exclaimed--\"not die now, after having lived and\nsuffered so long and so much! Die? yes, had I died years ago; but now to\ndie would be, indeed, to give way to the sarcasm of destiny. No, I want\nto live; I shall struggle to the very last; I will yet win back the\nhappiness of which I have been deprived. Before I die I must not forget\nthat I have my executioners to punish, and perhaps, too, who knows, some\nfriends to reward. Yet they will forget me here, and I shall die in\nmy dungeon like Faria.\" As he said this, he became silent and gazed\nstraight before him like one overwhelmed with a strange and amazing\nthought. Suddenly he arose, lifted his hand to his brow as if his brain\nwere giddy, paced twice or thrice round the dungeon, and then paused\nabruptly by the bed.\n\n\"Just God!\" he muttered, \"whence comes this thought? Is it from thee?\nSince none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon, let me take\nthe place of the dead!\" Without giving himself time to reconsider\nhis decision, and, indeed, that he might not allow his thoughts to be\ndistracted from his desperate resolution, he bent over the appalling\nshroud, opened it with the knife which Faria had made, drew the corpse\nfrom the sack, and bore it along the tunnel to his own chamber, laid it\non his couch, tied around its head the rag he wore at night around his\nown, covered it with his counterpane, once again kissed the ice-cold\nbrow, and tried vainly to close the resisting eyes, which glared\nhorribly, turned the head towards the wall, so that the jailer might,\nwhen he brought the evening meal, believe that he was asleep, as was\nhis frequent custom; entered the tunnel again, drew the bed against the\nwall, returned to the other cell, took from the hiding-place the needle\nand thread, flung off his rags, that they might feel only naked flesh\nbeneath the coarse canvas, and getting inside the sack, placed himself\nin the posture in which the dead body had been laid, and sewed up the\nmouth of the sack from the inside.\n\nHe would have been discovered by the beating of his heart, if by any\nmischance the jailers had entered at that moment. Dantes might have\nwaited until the evening visit was over, but he was afraid that the\ngovernor would change his mind, and order the dead body to be removed\nearlier. In that case his last hope would have been destroyed. Now his\nplans were fully made, and this is what he intended to do. If while he\nwas being carried out the grave-diggers should discover that they were\nbearing a live instead of a dead body, Dantes did not intend to give\nthem time to recognize him, but with a sudden cut of the knife, he meant\nto open the sack from top to bottom, and, profiting by their alarm,\nescape; if they tried to catch him, he would use his knife to better\npurpose.\n\nIf they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave, he would\nallow himself to be covered with earth, and then, as it was night, the\ngrave-diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would\nhave worked his way through the yielding soil and escaped. He hoped that\nthe weight of earth would not be so great that he could not overcome it.\nIf he was detected in this and the earth proved too heavy, he would be\nstifled, and then--so much the better, all would be over. Dantes had not\neaten since the preceding evening, but he had not thought of hunger, nor\ndid he think of it now. His situation was too precarious to allow him\neven time to reflect on any thought but one.\n\nThe first risk that Dantes ran was, that the jailer, when he brought\nhim his supper at seven o'clock, might perceive the change that had been\nmade; fortunately, twenty times at least, from misanthropy or fatigue,\nDantes had received his jailer in bed, and then the man placed his bread\nand soup on the table, and went away without saying a word. This time\nthe jailer might not be as silent as usual, but speak to Dantes, and\nseeing that he received no reply, go to the bed, and thus discover all.\n\nWhen seven o'clock came, Dantes' agony really began. His hand placed\nupon his heart was unable to redress its throbbings, while, with the\nother he wiped the perspiration from his temples. From time to time\nchills ran through his whole body, and clutched his heart in a grasp\nof ice. Then he thought he was going to die. Yet the hours passed on\nwithout any unusual disturbance, and Dantes knew that he had escaped\nthe first peril. It was a good augury. At length, about the hour the\ngovernor had appointed, footsteps were heard on the stairs. Edmond\nfelt that the moment had arrived, summoned up all his courage, held\nhis breath, and would have been happy if at the same time he could\nhave repressed the throbbing of his veins. The footsteps--they\nwere double--paused at the door--and Dantes guessed that the two\ngrave-diggers had come to seek him--this idea was soon converted\ninto certainty, when he heard the noise they made in putting down the\nhand-bier. The door opened, and a dim light reached Dantes' eyes through\nthe coarse sack that covered him; he saw two shadows approach his bed,\na third remaining at the door with a torch in its hand. The two men,\napproaching the ends of the bed, took the sack by its extremities.\n\n\"He's heavy though for an old and thin man,\" said one, as he raised the\nhead.\n\n\"They say every year adds half a pound to the weight of the bones,\" said\nanother, lifting the feet.\n\n\"Have you tied the knot?\" inquired the first speaker.\n\n\"What would be the use of carrying so much more weight?\" was the reply,\n\"I can do that when we get there.\"\n\n\"Yes, you're right,\" replied the companion.\n\n\"What's the knot for?\" thought Dantes.\n\nThey deposited the supposed corpse on the bier. Edmond stiffened himself\nin order to play the part of a dead man, and then the party, lighted by\nthe man with the torch, who went first, ascended the stairs. Suddenly he\nfelt the fresh and sharp night air, and Dantes knew that the mistral was\nblowing. It was a sensation in which pleasure and pain were strangely\nmingled. The bearers went on for twenty paces, then stopped, putting\nthe bier down on the ground. One of them went away, and Dantes heard his\nshoes striking on the pavement.\n\n\"Where am I?\" he asked himself.\n\n\"Really, he is by no means a light load!\" said the other bearer, sitting\non the edge of the hand-barrow. Dantes' first impulse was to escape, but\nfortunately he did not attempt it.\n\n\"Give us a light,\" said the other bearer, \"or I shall never find what I\nam looking for.\" The man with the torch complied, although not asked in\nthe most polite terms.\n\n\"What can he be looking for?\" thought Edmond. \"The spade, perhaps.\" An\nexclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave-digger had found\nthe object of his search. \"Here it is at last,\" he said, \"not without\nsome trouble though.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" was the answer, \"but it has lost nothing by waiting.\"\n\nAs he said this, the man came towards Edmond, who heard a heavy metallic\nsubstance laid down beside him, and at the same moment a cord was\nfastened round his feet with sudden and painful violence.\n\n\"Well, have you tied the knot?\" inquired the grave-digger, who was\nlooking on.\n\n\"Yes, and pretty tight too, I can tell you,\" was the answer.\n\n\"Move on, then.\" And the bier was lifted once more, and they proceeded.\n\nThey advanced fifty paces farther, and then stopped to open a door, then\nwent forward again. The noise of the waves dashing against the rocks on\nwhich the chateau is built, reached Dantes' ear distinctly as they went\nforward.\n\n\"Bad weather!\" observed one of the bearers; \"not a pleasant night for a\ndip in the sea.\"\n\n\"Why, yes, the abbe runs a chance of being wet,\" said the other; and\nthen there was a burst of brutal laughter. Dantes did not comprehend the\njest, but his hair stood erect on his head.\n\n\"Well, here we are at last,\" said one of them. \"A little farther--a\nlittle farther,\" said the other. \"You know very well that the last was\nstopped on his way, dashed on the rocks, and the governor told us next\nday that we were careless fellows.\"\n\nThey ascended five or six more steps, and then Dantes felt that they\ntook him, one by the head and the other by the heels, and swung him to\nand fro. \"One!\" said the grave-diggers, \"two! three!\" And at the same\ninstant Dantes felt himself flung into the air like a wounded bird,\nfalling, falling, with a rapidity that made his blood curdle. Although\ndrawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent, it\nseemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century.\n\nAt last, with a horrible splash, he darted like an arrow into the\nice-cold water, and as he did so he uttered a shrill cry, stifled in a\nmoment by his immersion beneath the waves.\n\nDantes had been flung into the sea, and was dragged into its depths by\na thirty-six pound shot tied to his feet. The sea is the cemetery of the\nChateau d'If.\n\n\n\nChapter 21. The Island of Tiboulen.\n\nDantes, although stunned and almost suffocated, had sufficient presence\nof mind to hold his breath, and as his right hand (prepared as he was\nfor every chance) held his knife open, he rapidly ripped up the sack,\nextricated his arm, and then his body; but in spite of all his efforts\nto free himself from the shot, he felt it dragging him down still lower.\nHe then bent his body, and by a desperate effort severed the cord that\nbound his legs, at the moment when it seemed as if he were actually\nstrangled. With a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the sea, while\nthe shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become\nhis shroud.\n\nDantes waited only to get breath, and then dived, in order to avoid\nbeing seen. When he arose a second time, he was fifty paces from where\nhe had first sunk. He saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky, across\nwhich the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling\nstar to appear; before him was the vast expanse of waters, sombre and\nterrible, whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of\na storm. Behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the sky, rose\nphantom-like the vast stone structure, whose projecting crags seemed\nlike arms extended to seize their prey, and on the highest rock was a\ntorch lighting two figures. He fancied that these two forms were looking\nat the sea; doubtless these strange grave-diggers had heard his cry.\nDantes dived again, and remained a long time beneath the water. This was\nan easy feat to him, for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in\nthe bay before the lighthouse at Marseilles when he swam there, and was\nunanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port. When he came up\nagain the light had disappeared.\n\nHe must now get his bearings. Ratonneau and Pomegue are the nearest\nislands of all those that surround the Chateau d'If, but Ratonneau\nand Pomegue are inhabited, as is also the islet of Daume. Tiboulen and\nLemaire were therefore the safest for Dantes' venture. The islands\nof Tiboulen and Lemaire are a league from the Chateau d'If; Dantes,\nnevertheless, determined to make for them. But how could he find his\nway in the darkness of the night? At this moment he saw the light of\nPlanier, gleaming in front of him like a star. By leaving this light\non the right, he kept the Island of Tiboulen a little on the left; by\nturning to the left, therefore, he would find it. But, as we have said,\nit was at least a league from the Chateau d'If to this island. Often\nin prison Faria had said to him, when he saw him idle and inactive,\n\"Dantes, you must not give way to this listlessness; you will be drowned\nif you seek to escape, and your strength has not been properly exercised\nand prepared for exertion.\" These words rang in Dantes' ears, even\nbeneath the waves; he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if\nhe had not lost his strength. He found with pleasure that his captivity\nhad taken away nothing of his power, and that he was still master of\nthat element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a boy.\n\nFear, that relentless pursuer, clogged Dantes' efforts. He listened for\nany sound that might be audible, and every time that he rose to the top\nof a wave he scanned the horizon, and strove to penetrate the darkness.\nHe fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing boat, and he\nredoubled his exertions, increasing rapidly his distance from the\nchateau, but exhausting his strength. He swam on still, and already the\nterrible chateau had disappeared in the darkness. He could not see it,\nbut he felt its presence. An hour passed, during which Dantes, excited\nby the feeling of freedom, continued to cleave the waves. \"Let us see,\"\nsaid he, \"I have swum above an hour, but as the wind is against me, that\nhas retarded my speed; however, if I am not mistaken, I must be close\nto Tiboulen. But what if I were mistaken?\" A shudder passed over him.\nHe sought to tread water, in order to rest himself; but the sea was\ntoo violent, and he felt that he could not make use of this means of\nrecuperation.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I will swim on until I am worn out, or the cramp\nseizes me, and then I shall sink;\" and he struck out with the energy of\ndespair.\n\nSuddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense,\nand heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him; at the same time he\nfelt a sharp pain in his knee. He fancied for a moment that he had been\nshot, and listened for the report; but he heard nothing. Then he put out\nhis hand, and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that\nhe had gained the shore.\n\nBefore him rose a grotesque mass of rocks, that resembled nothing\nso much as a vast fire petrified at the moment of its most fervent\ncombustion. It was the Island of Tiboulen. Dantes rose, advanced a few\nsteps, and, with a fervent prayer of gratitude, stretched himself on\nthe granite, which seemed to him softer than down. Then, in spite of the\nwind and rain, he fell into the deep, sweet sleep of utter exhaustion.\nAt the expiration of an hour Edmond was awakened by the roar of thunder.\nThe tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty\nwings; from time to time a flash of lightning stretched across the\nheavens like a fiery serpent, lighting up the clouds that rolled on in\nvast chaotic waves.\n\nDantes had not been deceived--he had reached the first of the two\nislands, which was, in fact, Tiboulen. He knew that it was barren and\nwithout shelter; but when the sea became more calm, he resolved to\nplunge into its waves again, and swim to Lemaire, equally arid, but\nlarger, and consequently better adapted for concealment.\n\nAn overhanging rock offered him a temporary shelter, and scarcely had\nhe availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury.\nEdmond felt the trembling of the rock beneath which he lay; the waves,\ndashing themselves against it, wetted him with their spray. He was\nsafely sheltered, and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of\nthe elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning. It seemed\nto him that the island trembled to its base, and that it would, like a\nvessel at anchor, break moorings, and bear him off into the centre\nof the storm. He then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for\nfour-and-twenty hours. He extended his hands, and drank greedily of the\nrainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the rock.\n\nAs he rose, a flash of lightning, that seemed to rive the remotest\nheights of heaven, illumined the darkness. By its light, between the\nIsland of Lemaire and Cape Croiselle, a quarter of a league distant,\nDantes saw a fishing-boat driven rapidly like a spectre before the power\nof winds and waves. A second after, he saw it again, approaching with\nfrightful rapidity. Dantes cried at the top of his voice to warn them of\ntheir danger, but they saw it themselves. Another flash showed him four\nmen clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging, while a fifth clung\nto the broken rudder.\n\nThe men he beheld saw him undoubtedly, for their cries were carried to\nhis ears by the wind. Above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters\nwas waving; suddenly the ropes that still held it gave way, and it\ndisappeared in the darkness of the night like a vast sea-bird. At the\nsame moment a violent crash was heard, and cries of distress. Dantes\nfrom his rocky perch saw the shattered vessel, and among the fragments\nthe floating forms of the hapless sailors. Then all was dark again.\n\nDantes ran down the rocks at the risk of being himself dashed to pieces;\nhe listened, he groped about, but he heard and saw nothing--the cries\nhad ceased, and the tempest continued to rage. By degrees the wind\nabated, vast gray clouds rolled towards the west, and the blue firmament\nappeared studded with bright stars. Soon a red streak became visible in\nthe horizon, the waves whitened, a light played over them, and gilded\ntheir foaming crests with gold. It was day.\n\nDantes stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle, as if\nhe now beheld it for the first time; and indeed since his captivity\nin the Chateau d'If he had forgotten that such scenes were ever to be\nwitnessed. He turned towards the fortress, and looked at both sea and\nland. The gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing\nmajesty and seemed to dominate the scene. It was about five o'clock. The\nsea continued to get calmer.\n\n\"In two or three hours,\" thought Dantes, \"the turnkey will enter my\nchamber, find the body of my poor friend, recognize it, seek for me in\nvain, and give the alarm. Then the tunnel will be discovered; the men\nwho cast me into the sea and who must have heard the cry I uttered, will\nbe questioned. Then boats filled with armed soldiers will pursue the\nwretched fugitive. The cannon will warn every one to refuse shelter to a\nman wandering about naked and famished. The police of Marseilles will be\non the alert by land, whilst the governor pursues me by sea. I am cold,\nI am hungry. I have lost even the knife that saved me. O my God, I have\nsuffered enough surely! Have pity on me, and do for me what I am unable\nto do for myself.\"\n\nAs Dantes (his eyes turned in the direction of the Chateau d'If) uttered\nthis prayer, he saw off the farther point of the Island of Pomegue a\nsmall vessel with lateen sail skimming the sea like a gull in search of\nprey; and with his sailor's eye he knew it to be a Genoese tartan.\nShe was coming out of Marseilles harbor, and was standing out to sea\nrapidly, her sharp prow cleaving through the waves. \"Oh,\" cried Edmond,\n\"to think that in half an hour I could join her, did I not fear being\nquestioned, detected, and conveyed back to Marseilles! What can I do?\nWhat story can I invent? under pretext of trading along the coast, these\nmen, who are in reality smugglers, will prefer selling me to doing a\ngood action. I must wait. But I cannot---- I am starving. In a few hours\nmy strength will be utterly exhausted; besides, perhaps I have not been\nmissed at the fortress. I can pass as one of the sailors wrecked last\nnight. My story will be accepted, for there is no one left to contradict\nme.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Dantes looked toward the spot where the fishing-vessel had\nbeen wrecked, and started. The red cap of one of the sailors hung to a\npoint of the rock and some timbers that had formed part of the vessel's\nkeel, floated at the foot of the crag. In an instant Dantes' plan was\nformed. He swam to the cap, placed it on his head, seized one of the\ntimbers, and struck out so as to cut across the course the vessel was\ntaking.\n\n\"I am saved!\" murmured he. And this conviction restored his strength.\n\nHe soon saw that the vessel, with the wind dead ahead, was tacking\nbetween the Chateau d'If and the tower of Planier. For an instant he\nfeared lest, instead of keeping in shore, she should stand out to sea;\nbut he soon saw that she would pass, like most vessels bound for Italy,\nbetween the islands of Jaros and Calaseraigne. However, the vessel and\nthe swimmer insensibly neared one another, and in one of its tacks\nthe tartan bore down within a quarter of a mile of him. He rose on the\nwaves, making signs of distress; but no one on board saw him, and the\nvessel stood on another tack. Dantes would have shouted, but he knew\nthat the wind would drown his voice.\n\nIt was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber,\nfor without it he would have been unable, perhaps, to reach the\nvessel--certainly to return to shore, should he be unsuccessful in\nattracting attention.\n\nDantes, though almost sure as to what course the vessel would take, had\nyet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him. Then\nhe advanced; but before they could meet, the vessel again changed her\ncourse. By a violent effort he rose half out of the water, waving his\ncap, and uttering a loud shout peculiar to sailers. This time he was\nboth seen and heard, and the tartan instantly steered towards him. At\nthe same time, he saw they were about to lower the boat.\n\nAn instant after, the boat, rowed by two men, advanced rapidly towards\nhim. Dantes let go of the timber, which he now thought to be useless,\nand swam vigorously to meet them. But he had reckoned too much upon his\nstrength, and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to\nhim. His arms became stiff, his legs lost their flexibility, and he was\nalmost breathless.\n\nHe shouted again. The two sailors redoubled their efforts, and one of\nthem cried in Italian, \"Courage!\"\n\nThe word reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the strength\nto surmount passed over his head. He rose again to the surface,\nstruggled with the last desperate effort of a drowning man, uttered a\nthird cry, and felt himself sinking, as if the fatal cannon shot were\nagain tied to his feet. The water passed over his head, and the sky\nturned gray. A convulsive movement again brought him to the surface. He\nfelt himself seized by the hair, then he saw and heard nothing. He had\nfainted.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes Dantes found himself on the deck of the tartan.\nHis first care was to see what course they were taking. They were\nrapidly leaving the Chateau d'If behind. Dantes was so exhausted that\nthe exclamation of joy he uttered was mistaken for a sigh.\n\nAs we have said, he was lying on the deck. A sailor was rubbing his\nlimbs with a woollen cloth; another, whom he recognized as the one who\nhad cried out \"Courage!\" held a gourd full of rum to his mouth; while\nthe third, an old sailer, at once the pilot and captain, looked on with\nthat egotistical pity men feel for a misfortune that they have escaped\nyesterday, and which may overtake them to-morrow.\n\nA few drops of the rum restored suspended animation, while the friction\nof his limbs restored their elasticity.\n\n\"Who are you?\" said the pilot in bad French.\n\n\"I am,\" replied Dantes, in bad Italian, \"a Maltese sailor. We were\ncoming from Syracuse laden with grain. The storm of last night overtook\nus at Cape Morgion, and we were wrecked on these rocks.\"\n\n\"Where do you come from?\"\n\n\"From these rocks that I had the good luck to cling to while our captain\nand the rest of the crew were all lost. I saw your vessel, and fearful\nof being left to perish on the desolate island, I swam off on a piece of\nwreckage to try and intercept your course. You have saved my life, and\nI thank you,\" continued Dantes. \"I was lost when one of your sailors\ncaught hold of my hair.\"\n\n\"It was I,\" said a sailor of a frank and manly appearance; \"and it was\ntime, for you were sinking.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Dantes, holding out his hand, \"I thank you again.\"\n\n\"I almost hesitated, though,\" replied the sailor; \"you looked more like\na brigand than an honest man, with your beard six inches, and your hair\na foot long.\" Dantes recollected that his hair and beard had not been\ncut all the time he was at the Chateau d'If.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"I made a vow, to our Lady of the Grotto not to cut my\nhair or beard for ten years if I were saved in a moment of danger; but\nto-day the vow expires.\"\n\n\"Now what are we to do with you?\" said the captain.\n\n\"Alas, anything you please. My captain is dead; I have barely escaped;\nbut I am a good sailor. Leave me at the first port you make; I shall be\nsure to find employment.\"\n\n\"Do you know the Mediterranean?\"\n\n\"I have sailed over it since my childhood.\"\n\n\"You know the best harbors?\"\n\n\"There are few ports that I could not enter or leave with a bandage over\nmy eyes.\"\n\n\"I say, captain,\" said the sailor who had cried \"Courage!\" to Dantes,\n\"if what he says is true, what hinders his staying with us?\"\n\n\"If he says true,\" said the captain doubtingly. \"But in his present\ncondition he will promise anything, and take his chance of keeping it\nafterwards.\"\n\n\"I will do more than I promise,\" said Dantes.\n\n\"We shall see,\" returned the other, smiling.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Dantes.\n\n\"To Leghorn.\"\n\n\"Then why, instead of tacking so frequently, do you not sail nearer the\nwind?\"\n\n\"Because we should run straight on to the Island of Rion.\"\n\n\"You shall pass it by twenty fathoms.\"\n\n\"Take the helm, and let us see what you know.\" The young man took the\nhelm, felt to see if the vessel answered the rudder promptly and\nseeing that, without being a first-rate sailer, she yet was tolerably\nobedient,--\n\n\"To the sheets,\" said he. The four seamen, who composed the crew,\nobeyed, while the pilot looked on. \"Haul taut.\"--They obeyed.\n\n\"Belay.\" This order was also executed; and the vessel passed, as Dantes\nhad predicted, twenty fathoms to windward.\n\n\"Bravo!\" said the captain.\n\n\"Bravo!\" repeated the sailors. And they all looked with astonishment at\nthis man whose eye now disclosed an intelligence and his body a vigor\nthey had not thought him capable of showing.\n\n\"You see,\" said Dantes, quitting the helm, \"I shall be of some use to\nyou, at least during the voyage. If you do not want me at Leghorn, you\ncan leave me there, and I will pay you out of the first wages I get, for\nmy food and the clothes you lend me.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the captain, \"we can agree very well, if you are reasonable.\"\n\n\"Give me what you give the others, and it will be all right,\" returned\nDantes.\n\n\"That's not fair,\" said the seaman who had saved Dantes; \"for you know\nmore than we do.\"\n\n\"What is that to you, Jacopo?\" returned the Captain. \"Every one is free\nto ask what he pleases.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" replied Jacopo; \"I only make a remark.\"\n\n\"Well, you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of\ntrousers, if you have them.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Jacopo; \"but I have a shirt and a pair of trousers.\"\n\n\"That is all I want,\" interrupted Dantes. Jacopo dived into the hold and\nsoon returned with what Edmond wanted.\n\n\"Now, then, do you wish for anything else?\" said the patron.\n\n\"A piece of bread and another glass of the capital rum I tasted, for\nI have not eaten or drunk for a long time.\" He had not tasted food for\nforty hours. A piece of bread was brought, and Jacopo offered him the\ngourd.\n\n\"Larboard your helm,\" cried the captain to the steersman. Dantes glanced\nthat way as he lifted the gourd to his mouth; then paused with hand in\nmid-air.\n\n\"Hollo! what's the matter at the Chateau d'If?\" said the captain.\n\nA small white cloud, which had attracted Dantes' attention, crowned the\nsummit of the bastion of the Chateau d'If. At the same moment the faint\nreport of a gun was heard. The sailors looked at one another.\n\n\"What is this?\" asked the captain.\n\n\"A prisoner has escaped from the Chateau d'If, and they are firing\nthe alarm gun,\" replied Dantes. The captain glanced at him, but he had\nlifted the rum to his lips and was drinking it with so much composure,\nthat suspicions, if the captain had any, died away.\n\n\"At any rate,\" murmured he, \"if it be, so much the better, for I have\nmade a rare acquisition.\" Under pretence of being fatigued, Dantes asked\nto take the helm; the steersman, glad to be relieved, looked at the\ncaptain, and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to\nhis new comrade. Dantes could thus keep his eyes on Marseilles.\n\n\"What is the day of the month?\" asked he of Jacopo, who sat down beside\nhim.\n\n\"The 28th of February.\"\n\n\"In what year?\"\n\n\"In what year--you ask me in what year?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the young man, \"I ask you in what year!\"\n\n\"You have forgotten then?\"\n\n\"I got such a fright last night,\" replied Dantes, smiling, \"that I have\nalmost lost my memory. I ask you what year is it?\"\n\n\"The year 1829,\" returned Jacopo. It was fourteen years day for day\nsince Dantes' arrest. He was nineteen when he entered the Chateau d'If;\nhe was thirty-three when he escaped. A sorrowful smile passed over his\nface; he asked himself what had become of Mercedes, who must believe him\ndead. Then his eyes lighted up with hatred as he thought of the three\nmen who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity. He renewed\nagainst Danglars, Fernand, and Villefort the oath of implacable\nvengeance he had made in his dungeon. This oath was no longer a vain\nmenace; for the fastest sailer in the Mediterranean would have been\nunable to overtake the little tartan, that with every stitch of canvas\nset was flying before the wind to Leghorn.\n\n\n\nChapter 22. The Smugglers.\n\nDantes had not been a day on board before he had a very clear idea of\nthe men with whom his lot had been cast. Without having been in the\nschool of the Abbe Faria, the worthy master of The Young Amelia (the\nname of the Genoese tartan) knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken\non the shores of that large lake called the Mediterranean, from the\nArabic to the Provencal, and this, while it spared him interpreters,\npersons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet, gave him great\nfacilities of communication, either with the vessels he met at sea,\nwith the small boats sailing along the coast, or with the people without\nname, country, or occupation, who are always seen on the quays of\nseaports, and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must\nsuppose to be a direct gift of providence, as they have no visible means\nof support. It is fair to assume that Dantes was on board a smuggler.\n\nAt first the captain had received Dantes on board with a certain degree\nof distrust. He was very well known to the customs officers of the\ncoast; and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual\nbattle of wits, he had at first thought that Dantes might be an emissary\nof these industrious guardians of rights and duties, who perhaps\nemployed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his\ntrade. But the skilful manner in which Dantes had handled the lugger had\nentirely reassured him; and then, when he saw the light plume of smoke\nfloating above the bastion of the Chateau d'If, and heard the distant\nreport, he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his\nvessel one whose coming and going, like that of kings, was accompanied\nwith salutes of artillery. This made him less uneasy, it must be owned,\nthan if the new-comer had proved to be a customs officer; but this\nsupposition also disappeared like the first, when he beheld the perfect\ntranquillity of his recruit.\n\nEdmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was, without the\nowner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew tried\nto \"pump\" him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave accurate\ndescriptions of Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as Marseilles,\nand held stoutly to his first story. Thus the Genoese, subtle as he\nwas, was duped by Edmond, in whose favor his mild demeanor, his nautical\nskill, and his admirable dissimulation, pleaded. Moreover, it is\npossible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know\nnothing but what they should know, and believe nothing but what they\nshould believe.\n\nIn this state of mutual understanding, they reached Leghorn. Here\nEdmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he could\nrecognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years.\nHe had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had\nbeen, and was now to find out what the man had become. His comrades\nbelieved that his vow was fulfilled. As he had twenty times touched at\nLeghorn, he remembered a barber in St. Ferdinand Street; he went there\nto have his beard and hair cut. The barber gazed in amazement at this\nman with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head\nthe appearance of one of Titian's portraits. At this period it was not\nthe fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber\nwould only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should\nconsent voluntarily to deprive himself of them. The Leghorn barber said\nnothing and went to work.\n\nWhen the operation was concluded, and Edmond felt that his chin was\ncompletely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked\nfor a hand-glass. He was now, as we have said, three-and-thirty years\nof age, and his fourteen years' imprisonment had produced a great\ntransformation in his appearance. Dantes had entered the Chateau d'If\nwith the round, open, smiling face of a young and happy man, with whom\nthe early paths of life have been smooth, and who anticipates a future\ncorresponding with his past. This was now all changed. The oval face\nwas lengthened, his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked\nlines which betoken resolution; his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow\nfurrowed with thought; his eyes were full of melancholy, and from their\ndepths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred;\nhis complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that pale color\nwhich produces, when the features are encircled with black hair, the\naristocratic beauty of the man of the north; the profound learning\nhe had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined\nintellectual expression; and he had also acquired, being naturally of\na goodly stature, that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long\nconcentrated all its force within itself.\n\nTo the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity\nof a rounded and muscular figure. As to his voice, prayers, sobs, and\nimprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly\npenetrating sweetness, and at others rough and almost hoarse. Moreover,\nfrom being so long in twilight or darkness, his eyes had acquired the\nfaculty of distinguishing objects in the night, common to the hyena and\nthe wolf. Edmond smiled when he beheld himself: it was impossible that\nhis best friend--if, indeed, he had any friend left--could recognize\nhim; he could not recognize himself.\n\nThe master of The Young Amelia, who was very desirous of retaining\namongst his crew a man of Edmond's value, had offered to advance him\nfunds out of his future profits, which Edmond had accepted. His next\ncare on leaving the barber's who had achieved his first metamorphosis\nwas to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor's suit--a garb, as we all\nknow, very simple, and consisting of white trousers, a striped shirt,\nand a cap. It was in this costume, and bringing back to Jacopo the shirt\nand trousers he had lent him, that Edmond reappeared before the captain\nof the lugger, who had made him tell his story over and over again\nbefore he could believe him, or recognize in the neat and trim sailor\nthe man with thick and matted beard, hair tangled with seaweed, and body\nsoaking in seabrine, whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned.\nAttracted by his prepossessing appearance, he renewed his offers of an\nengagement to Dantes; but Dantes, who had his own projects, would not\nagree for a longer time than three months.\n\nThe Young Amelia had a very active crew, very obedient to their captain,\nwho lost as little time as possible. He had scarcely been a week at\nLeghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins,\ncontraband cottons, English powder, and tobacco on which the excise had\nforgotten to put its mark. The master was to get all this out of Leghorn\nfree of duties, and land it on the shores of Corsica, where certain\nspeculators undertook to forward the cargo to France. They sailed;\nEdmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon\nof his youth, and which he had so often dreamed of in prison. He left\nGorgone on his right and La Pianosa on his left, and went towards the\ncountry of Paoli and Napoleon. The next morning going on deck, as he\nalways did at an early hour, the patron found Dantes leaning against\nthe bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks,\nwhich the rising sun tinged with rosy light. It was the Island of Monte\nCristo. The Young Amelia left it three-quarters of a league to the\nlarboard, and kept on for Corsica.\n\nDantes thought, as they passed so closely to the island whose name was\nso interesting to him, that he had only to leap into the sea and in\nhalf an hour be at the promised land. But then what could he do without\ninstruments to discover his treasure, without arms to defend himself?\nBesides, what would the sailors say? What would the patron think? He\nmust wait.\n\nFortunately, Dantes had learned how to wait; he had waited fourteen\nyears for his liberty, and now he was free he could wait at least six\nmonths or a year for wealth. Would he not have accepted liberty without\nriches if it had been offered to him? Besides, were not those riches\nchimerical?--offspring of the brain of the poor Abbe Faria, had they\nnot died with him? It is true, the letter of the Cardinal Spada was\nsingularly circumstantial, and Dantes repeated it to himself, from one\nend to the other, for he had not forgotten a word.\n\nEvening came, and Edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of\ntwilight, and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own,\nfor he, with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison, continued to\nbehold it last of all, for he remained alone upon deck. The next morn\nbroke off the coast of Aleria; all day they coasted, and in the evening\nsaw fires lighted on land; the position of these was no doubt a signal\nfor landing, for a ship's lantern was hung up at the mast-head instead\nof the streamer, and they came to within a gunshot of the shore. Dantes\nnoticed that the captain of The Young Amelia had, as he neared the land,\nmounted two small culverins, which, without making much noise, can throw\na four ounce ball a thousand paces or so.\n\nBut on this occasion the precaution was superfluous, and everything\nproceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness. Four shallops came\noff with very little noise alongside the lugger, which, no doubt, in\nacknowledgement of the compliment, lowered her own shallop into the sea,\nand the five boats worked so well that by two o'clock in the morning\nall the cargo was out of The Young Amelia and on terra firma. The same\nnight, such a man of regularity was the patron of The Young Amelia, the\nprofits were divided, and each man had a hundred Tuscan livres, or about\neighty francs. But the voyage was not ended. They turned the bowsprit\ntowards Sardinia, where they intended to take in a cargo, which was to\nreplace what had been discharged. The second operation was as successful\nas the first, The Young Amelia was in luck. This new cargo was destined\nfor the coast of the Duchy of Lucca, and consisted almost entirely of\nHavana cigars, sherry, and Malaga wines.\n\nThere they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties; the\nexcise was, in truth, the everlasting enemy of the patron of The Young\nAmelia. A customs officer was laid low, and two sailors wounded; Dantes\nwas one of the latter, a ball having touched him in the left shoulder.\nDantes was almost glad of this affray, and almost pleased at being\nwounded, for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he\ncould view danger, and with what endurance he could bear suffering. He\nhad contemplated danger with a smile, and when wounded had exclaimed\nwith the great philosopher, \"Pain, thou art not an evil.\" He had,\nmoreover, looked upon the customs officer wounded to death, and, whether\nfrom heat of blood produced by the encounter, or the chill of human\nsentiment, this sight had made but slight impression upon him. Dantes\nwas on the way he desired to follow, and was moving towards the end\nhe wished to achieve; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his\nbosom. Jacopo, seeing him fall, had believed him killed, and rushing\ntowards him raised him up, and then attended to him with all the\nkindness of a devoted comrade.\n\nThis world was not then so good as Doctor Pangloss believed it, neither\nwas it so wicked as Dantes thought it, since this man, who had nothing\nto expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of\nthe prize-money, manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall.\nFortunately, as we have said, Edmond was only wounded, and with certain\nherbs gathered at certain seasons, and sold to the smugglers by the\nold Sardinian women, the wound soon closed. Edmond then resolved to\ntry Jacopo, and offered him in return for his attention a share of his\nprize-money, but Jacopo refused it indignantly.\n\nAs a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the\nfirst bestowed on Edmond, the latter was moved to a certain degree of\naffection. But this sufficed for Jacopo, who instinctively felt that\nEdmond had a right to superiority of position--a superiority which\nEdmond had concealed from all others. And from this time the kindness\nwhich Edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman.\n\nThen in the long days on board ship, when the vessel, gliding on with\nsecurity over the azure sea, required no care but the hand of the\nhelmsman, thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails, Edmond,\nwith a chart in his hand, became the instructor of Jacopo, as the poor\nAbbe Faria had been his tutor. He pointed out to him the bearings of the\ncoast, explained to him the variations of the compass, and taught him to\nread in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven,\nand where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds. And when Jacopo\ninquired of him, \"What is the use of teaching all these things to a\npoor sailor like me?\" Edmond replied, \"Who knows? You may one day be the\ncaptain of a vessel. Your fellow-countryman, Bonaparte, became emperor.\"\nWe had forgotten to say that Jacopo was a Corsican.\n\nTwo months and a half elapsed in these trips, and Edmond had become\nas skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman; he had formed an\nacquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast, and learned all the\nMasonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other. He had\npassed and re-passed his Island of Monte Cristo twenty times, but not\nonce had he found an opportunity of landing there. He then formed a\nresolution. As soon as his engagement with the patron of The Young\nAmelia ended, he would hire a small vessel on his own account--for in\nhis several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastres--and under some\npretext land at the Island of Monte Cristo. Then he would be free to\nmake his researches, not perhaps entirely at liberty, for he would be\ndoubtless watched by those who accompanied him. But in this world we\nmust risk something. Prison had made Edmond prudent, and he was desirous\nof running no risk whatever. But in vain did he rack his imagination;\nfertile as it was, he could not devise any plan for reaching the island\nwithout companionship.\n\nDantes was tossed about on these doubts and wishes, when the patron, who\nhad great confidence in him, and was very desirous of retaining him in\nhis service, took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern\non the Via del' Oglio, where the leading smugglers of Leghorn used\nto congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade. Already\nDantes had visited this maritime Bourse two or three times, and seeing\nall these hardy free-traders, who supplied the whole coast for nearly\ntwo hundred leagues in extent, he had asked himself what power might\nnot that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these\ncontrary and diverging minds. This time it was a great matter that was\nunder discussion, connected with a vessel laden with Turkey carpets,\nstuffs of the Levant, and cashmeres. It was necessary to find some\nneutral ground on which an exchange could be made, and then to try and\nland these goods on the coast of France. If the venture was successful\nthe profit would be enormous, there would be a gain of fifty or sixty\npiastres each for the crew.\n\nThe patron of The Young Amelia proposed as a place of landing the Island\nof Monte Cristo, which being completely deserted, and having neither\nsoldiers nor revenue officers, seemed to have been placed in the midst\nof the ocean since the time of the heathen Olympus by Mercury, the god\nof merchants and robbers, classes of mankind which we in modern times\nhave separated if not made distinct, but which antiquity appears to have\nincluded in the same category. At the mention of Monte Cristo Dantes\nstarted with joy; he rose to conceal his emotion, and took a turn\naround the smoky tavern, where all the languages of the known world were\njumbled in a lingua franca. When he again joined the two persons who had\nbeen discussing the matter, it had been decided that they should touch\nat Monte Cristo and set out on the following night. Edmond, being\nconsulted, was of opinion that the island afforded every possible\nsecurity, and that great enterprises to be well done should be done\nquickly. Nothing then was altered in the plan, and orders were given to\nget under weigh next night, and, wind and weather permitting, to make\nthe neutral island by the following day.\n\n\n\nChapter 23. The Island of Monte Cristo.\n\nThus, at length, by one of the unexpected strokes of fortune which\nsometimes befall those who have for a long time been the victims of an\nevil destiny, Dantes was about to secure the opportunity he wished for,\nby simple and natural means, and land on the island without incurring\nany suspicion. One night more and he would be on his way.\n\nThe night was one of feverish distraction, and in its progress visions\ngood and evil passed through Dantes' mind. If he closed his eyes, he saw\nCardinal Spada's letter written on the wall in characters of flame--if\nhe slept for a moment the wildest dreams haunted his brain. He ascended\ninto grottos paved with emeralds, with panels of rubies, and the\nroof glowing with diamond stalactites. Pearls fell drop by drop, as\nsubterranean waters filter in their caves. Edmond, amazed, wonderstruck,\nfilled his pockets with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight,\nwhen he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles.\nHe then endeavored to re-enter the marvellous grottos, but they had\nsuddenly receded, and now the path became a labyrinth, and then the\nentrance vanished, and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and\nmysterious word which opened the splendid caverns of Ali Baba to the\nArabian fisherman. All was useless, the treasure disappeared, and had\nagain reverted to the genii from whom for a moment he had hoped to carry\nit off. The day came at length, and was almost as feverish as the night\nhad been, but it brought reason to the aid of imagination, and Dantes\nwas then enabled to arrange a plan which had hitherto been vague and\nunsettled in his brain. Night came, and with it the preparation for\ndeparture, and these preparations served to conceal Dantes' agitation.\nHe had by degrees assumed such authority over his companions that he was\nalmost like a commander on board; and as his orders were always clear,\ndistinct, and easy of execution, his comrades obeyed him with celerity\nand pleasure.\n\nThe old patron did not interfere, for he too had recognized the\nsuperiority of Dantes over the crew and himself. He saw in the young man\nhis natural successor, and regretted that he had not a daughter, that\nhe might have bound Edmond to him by a more secure alliance. At seven\no'clock in the evening all was ready, and at ten minutes past seven they\ndoubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled. The sea was calm,\nand, with a fresh breeze from the south-east, they sailed beneath a\nbright blue sky, in which God also lighted up in turn his beacon lights,\neach of which is a world. Dantes told them that all hands might turn in,\nand he would take the helm. When the Maltese (for so they called\nDantes) had said this, it was sufficient, and all went to their bunks\ncontentedly. This frequently happened. Dantes, cast from solitude into\nthe world, frequently experienced an imperious desire for solitude; and\nwhat solitude is more complete, or more poetical, than that of a ship\nfloating in isolation on the sea during the obscurity of the night, in\nthe silence of immensity, and under the eye of heaven?\n\nNow this solitude was peopled with his thoughts, the night lighted up by\nhis illusions, and the silence animated by his anticipations. When the\npatron awoke, the vessel was hurrying on with every sail set, and every\nsail full with the breeze. They were making nearly ten knots an hour.\nThe Island of Monte Cristo loomed large in the horizon. Edmond resigned\nthe lugger to the master's care, and went and lay down in his hammock;\nbut, in spite of a sleepless night, he could not close his eyes for a\nmoment. Two hours afterwards he came on deck, as the boat was about\nto double the Island of Elba. They were just abreast of Mareciana, and\nbeyond the flat but verdant Island of La Pianosa. The peak of Monte\nCristo reddened by the burning sun, was seen against the azure sky.\nDantes ordered the helmsman to put down his helm, in order to leave La\nPianosa to starboard, as he knew that he should shorten his course by\ntwo or three knots. About five o'clock in the evening the island was\ndistinct, and everything on it was plainly perceptible, owing to that\nclearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the light which the rays of the\nsun cast at its setting.\n\nEdmond gazed very earnestly at the mass of rocks which gave out all the\nvariety of twilight colors, from the brightest pink to the deepest blue;\nand from time to time his cheeks flushed, his brow darkened, and a mist\npassed over his eyes. Never did a gamester, whose whole fortune is staked\non one cast of the die, experience the anguish which Edmond felt in his\nparoxysms of hope. Night came, and at ten o'clock they anchored. The\nYoung Amelia was first at the rendezvous. In spite of his usual command\nover himself, Dantes could not restrain his impetuosity. He was the\nfirst to jump on shore; and had he dared, he would, like Lucius Brutus,\nhave \"kissed his mother earth.\" It was dark, but at eleven o'clock the\nmoon rose in the midst of the ocean, whose every wave she silvered,\nand then, \"ascending high,\" played in floods of pale light on the rocky\nhills of this second Pelion.\n\nThe island was familiar to the crew of The Young Amelia,--it was one of\nher regular haunts. As to Dantes, he had passed it on his voyage to and\nfrom the Levant, but never touched at it. He questioned Jacopo. \"Where\nshall we pass the night?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Why, on board the tartan,\" replied the sailor.\n\n\"Should we not do better in the grottos?\"\n\n\"What grottos?\"\n\n\"Why, the grottos--caves of the island.\"\n\n\"I do not know of any grottos,\" replied Jacopo. The cold sweat sprang\nforth on Dantes' brow.\n\n\"What, are there no grottos at Monte Cristo?\" he asked.\n\n\"None.\"\n\nFor a moment Dantes was speechless; then he remembered that these caves\nmight have been filled up by some accident, or even stopped up, for the\nsake of greater security, by Cardinal Spada. The point was, then, to\ndiscover the hidden entrance. It was useless to search at night, and\nDantes therefore delayed all investigation until the morning. Besides,\na signal made half a league out at sea, and to which The Young Amelia\nreplied by a similar signal, indicated that the moment for business had\ncome. The boat that now arrived, assured by the answering signal that\nall was well, soon came in sight, white and silent as a phantom, and\ncast anchor within a cable's length of shore.\n\nThen the landing began. Dantes reflected, as he worked, on the shout of\njoy which, with a single word, he could evoke from all these men, if he\ngave utterance to the one unchanging thought that pervaded his heart;\nbut, far from disclosing this precious secret, he almost feared that\nhe had already said too much, and by his restlessness and continual\nquestions, his minute observations and evident pre-occupation, aroused\nsuspicions. Fortunately, as regarded this circumstance at least, his\npainful past gave to his countenance an indelible sadness, and\nthe glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but\ntransitory.\n\nNo one had the slightest suspicion; and when next day, taking a\nfowling-piece, powder, and shot, Dantes declared his intention to go and\nkill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from rock to rock,\nhis wish was construed into a love of sport, or a desire for solitude.\nHowever, Jacopo insisted on following him, and Dantes did not oppose\nthis, fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust. Scarcely,\nhowever, had they gone a quarter of a league when, having killed a kid,\nhe begged Jacopo to take it to his comrades, and request them to cook\nit, and when ready to let him know by firing a gun. This and some dried\nfruits and a flask of Monte Pulciano, was the bill of fare. Dantes\nwent on, looking from time to time behind and around about him. Having\nreached the summit of a rock, he saw, a thousand feet beneath him, his\ncompanions, whom Jacopo had rejoined, and who were all busy preparing\nthe repast which Edmond's skill as a marksman had augmented with a\ncapital dish.\n\nEdmond looked at them for a moment with the sad and gentle smile of\na man superior to his fellows. \"In two hours' time,\" said he, \"these\npersons will depart richer by fifty piastres each, to go and risk their\nlives again by endeavoring to gain fifty more; then they will return\nwith a fortune of six hundred francs, and waste this treasure in some\ncity with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs. At\nthis moment hope makes me despise their riches, which seem to me\ncontemptible. Yet perchance to-morrow deception will so act on me, that\nI shall, on compulsion, consider such a contemptible possession as the\nutmost happiness. Oh, no!\" exclaimed Edmond, \"that will not be. The\nwise, unerring Faria could not be mistaken in this one thing. Besides,\nit were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched\nlife.\" Thus Dantes, who but three months before had no desire but\nliberty had now not liberty enough, and panted for wealth. The cause was\nnot in Dantes, but in providence, who, while limiting the power of man,\nhas filled him with boundless desires.\n\nMeanwhile, by a cleft between two walls of rock, following a path worn\nby a torrent, and which, in all human probability, human foot had never\nbefore trod, Dantes approached the spot where he supposed the grottos\nmust have existed. Keeping along the shore, and examining the smallest\nobject with serious attention, he thought he could trace, on certain\nrocks, marks made by the hand of man.\n\nTime, which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle, as\nit invests all things of the mind with forgetfulness, seemed to have\nrespected these signs, which apparently had been made with some degree\nof regularity, and probably with a definite purpose. Occasionally the\nmarks were hidden under tufts of myrtle, which spread into large bushes\nladen with blossoms, or beneath parasitical lichen. So Edmond had\nto separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the\nguide-marks were. The sight of marks renewed Edmond fondest hopes. Might\nit not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them, in\norder that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the event of\na catastrophe, which he could not foresee would have been so complete.\nThis solitary place was precisely suited to the requirements of a man\ndesirous of burying treasure. Only, might not these betraying marks have\nattracted other eyes than those for whom they were made? and had the\ndark and wondrous island indeed faithfully guarded its precious secret?\n\nIt seemed, however, to Edmond, who was hidden from his comrades by the\ninequalities of the ground, that at sixty paces from the harbor the\nmarks ceased; nor did they terminate at any grotto. A large round rock,\nplaced solidly on its base, was the only spot to which they seemed to\nlead. Edmond concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the end\nof the route he had only explored its beginning, and he therefore turned\nround and retraced his steps.\n\nMeanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast, had got some water from\na spring, spread out the fruit and bread, and cooked the kid. Just at\nthe moment when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit, they\nsaw Edmond springing with the boldness of a chamois from rock to rock,\nand they fired the signal agreed upon. The sportsman instantly changed\nhis direction, and ran quickly towards them. But even while they watched\nhis daring progress, Edmond's foot slipped, and they saw him stagger on\nthe edge of a rock and disappear. They all rushed towards him, for all\nloved Edmond in spite of his superiority; yet Jacopo reached him first.\n\nHe found Edmond lying prone, bleeding, and almost senseless. He had\nrolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen feet. They poured a little\nrum down his throat, and this remedy which had before been so beneficial\nto him, produced the same effect as formerly. Edmond opened his eyes,\ncomplained of great pain in his knee, a feeling of heaviness in his\nhead, and severe pains in his loins. They wished to carry him to the\nshore; but when they touched him, although under Jacopo's directions, he\ndeclared, with heavy groans, that he could not bear to be moved.\n\nIt may be supposed that Dantes did not now think of his dinner, but he\ninsisted that his comrades, who had not his reasons for fasting, should\nhave their meal. As for himself, he declared that he had only need of\na little rest, and that when they returned he should be easier. The\nsailors did not require much urging. They were hungry, and the smell of\nthe roasted kid was very savory, and your tars are not very ceremonious.\nAn hour afterwards they returned. All that Edmond had been able to\ndo was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a\nmoss-grown rock.\n\nBut, instead of growing easier, Dantes' pains appeared to increase in\nviolence. The old patron, who was obliged to sail in the morning in\norder to land his cargo on the frontiers of Piedmont and France,\nbetween Nice and Frejus, urged Dantes to try and rise. Edmond made great\nexertions in order to comply; but at each effort he fell back, moaning\nand turning pale.\n\n\"He has broken his ribs,\" said the commander, in a low voice. \"No\nmatter; he is an excellent fellow, and we must not leave him. We will\ntry and carry him on board the tartan.\" Dantes declared, however,\nthat he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the\nslightest movement cost him. \"Well,\" said the patron, \"let what may\nhappen, it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you.\nWe will not go till evening.\" This very much astonished the sailors,\nalthough, not one opposed it. The patron was so strict that this was the\nfirst time they had ever seen him give up an enterprise, or even delay\nin its execution. Dantes would not allow that any such infraction of\nregular and proper rules should be made in his favor. \"No, no,\" he said\nto the patron, \"I was awkward, and it is just that I pay the penalty of\nmy clumsiness. Leave me a small supply of biscuit, a gun, powder, and\nballs, to kill the kids or defend myself at need, and a pickaxe, that I\nmay build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me.\"\n\n\"But you'll die of hunger,\" said the patron.\n\n\"I would rather do so,\" was Edmond reply, \"than suffer the inexpressible\nagonies which the slightest movement causes me.\" The patron turned\ntowards his vessel, which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor,\nand, with sails partly set, would be ready for sea when her toilet\nshould be completed.\n\n\"What are we to do, Maltese?\" asked the captain. \"We cannot leave you\nhere so, and yet we cannot stay.\"\n\n\"Go, go!\" exclaimed Dantes.\n\n\"We shall be absent at least a week,\" said the patron, \"and then we must\nrun out of our course to come here and take you up again.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Dantes, \"if in two or three days you hail any fishing-boat,\ndesire them to come here to me. I will pay twenty-five piastres for my\npassage back to Leghorn. If you do not come across one, return for me.\"\nThe patron shook his head.\n\n\"Listen, Captain Baldi; there's one way of settling this,\" said Jacopo.\n\"Do you go, and I will stay and take care of the wounded man.\"\n\n\"And give up your share of the venture,\" said Edmond, \"to remain with\nme?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jacopo, \"and without any hesitation.\"\n\n\"You are a good fellow and a kind-hearted messmate,\" replied Edmond,\n\"and heaven will recompense you for your generous intentions; but I do\nnot wish any one to stay with me. A day or two of rest will set me up,\nand I hope I shall find among the rocks certain herbs most excellent for\nbruises.\"\n\nA peculiar smile passed over Dantes' lips; he squeezed Jacopo's hand\nwarmly, but nothing could shake his determination to remain--and remain\nalone. The smugglers left with Edmond what he had requested and set\nsail, but not without turning about several times, and each time making\nsigns of a cordial farewell, to which Edmond replied with his hand\nonly, as if he could not move the rest of his body. Then, when they\nhad disappeared, he said with a smile,--\"'Tis strange that it should be\namong such men that we find proofs of friendship and devotion.\" Then\nhe dragged himself cautiously to the top of a rock, from which he had\na full view of the sea, and thence he saw the tartan complete her\npreparations for sailing, weigh anchor, and, balancing herself as\ngracefully as a water-fowl ere it takes to the wing, set sail. At\nthe end of an hour she was completely out of sight; at least, it was\nimpossible for the wounded man to see her any longer from the spot where\nhe was. Then Dantes rose more agile and light than the kid among the\nmyrtles and shrubs of these wild rocks, took his gun in one hand, his\npickaxe in the other, and hastened towards the rock on which the marks\nhe had noted terminated. \"And now,\" he exclaimed, remembering the tale\nof the Arabian fisherman, which Faria had related to him, \"now, open\nsesame!\"\n\n\n\nChapter 24. The Secret Cave.\n\nThe sun had nearly reached the meridian, and his scorching rays fell\nfull on the rocks, which seemed themselves sensible of the heat.\nThousands of grasshoppers, hidden in the bushes, chirped with a\nmonotonous and dull note; the leaves of the myrtle and olive trees waved\nand rustled in the wind. At every step that Edmond took he disturbed\nthe lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald; afar off he saw\nthe wild goats bounding from crag to crag. In a word, the island was\ninhabited, yet Edmond felt himself alone, guided by the hand of God. He\nfelt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread--that dread of\nthe daylight which even in the desert makes us fear we are watched and\nobserved. This feeling was so strong that at the moment when Edmond was\nabout to begin his labor, he stopped, laid down his pickaxe, seized his\ngun, mounted to the summit of the highest rock, and from thence gazed\nround in every direction.\n\nBut it was not upon Corsica, the very houses of which he could\ndistinguish; or on Sardinia; or on the Island of Elba, with its\nhistorical associations; or upon the almost imperceptible line that to\nthe experienced eye of a sailor alone revealed the coast of Genoa\nthe proud, and Leghorn the commercial, that he gazed. It was at the\nbrigantine that had left in the morning, and the tartan that had just\nset sail, that Edmond fixed his eyes. The first was just disappearing\nin the straits of Bonifacio; the other, following an opposite direction,\nwas about to round the Island of Corsica. This sight reassured him. He\nthen looked at the objects near him. He saw that he was on the highest\npoint of the island,--a statue on this vast pedestal of granite, nothing\nhuman appearing in sight, while the blue ocean beat against the base of\nthe island, and covered it with a fringe of foam. Then he descended with\ncautious and slow step, for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that\nhe had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality.\n\nDantes, as we have said, had traced the marks along the rocks, and he\nhad noticed that they led to a small creek, which was hidden like the\nbath of some ancient nymph. This creek was sufficiently wide at its\nmouth, and deep in the centre, to admit of the entrance of a small\nvessel of the lugger class, which would be perfectly concealed from\nobservation.\n\nThen following the clew that, in the hands of the Abbe Faria, had\nbeen so skilfully used to guide him through the Daedalian labyrinth of\nprobabilities, he thought that the Cardinal Spada, anxious not to be\nwatched, had entered the creek, concealed his little barque, followed\nthe line marked by the notches in the rock, and at the end of it had\nburied his treasure. It was this idea that had brought Dantes back to\nthe circular rock. One thing only perplexed Edmond, and destroyed his\ntheory. How could this rock, which weighed several tons, have been\nlifted to this spot, without the aid of many men? Suddenly an idea\nflashed across his mind. Instead of raising it, thought he, they have\nlowered it. And he sprang from the rock in order to inspect the base\non which it had formerly stood. He soon perceived that a slope had been\nformed, and the rock had slid along this until it stopped at the spot\nit now occupied. A large stone had served as a wedge; flints and pebbles\nhad been inserted around it, so as to conceal the orifice; this species\nof masonry had been covered with earth, and grass and weeds had grown\nthere, moss had clung to the stones, myrtle-bushes had taken root, and\nthe old rock seemed fixed to the earth.\n\nDantes dug away the earth carefully, and detected, or fancied he\ndetected, the ingenious artifice. He attacked this wall, cemented by the\nhand of time, with his pickaxe. After ten minutes' labor the wall gave\nway, and a hole large enough to insert the arm was opened. Dantes\nwent and cut the strongest olive-tree he could find, stripped off its\nbranches, inserted it in the hole, and used it as a lever. But the rock\nwas too heavy, and too firmly wedged, to be moved by any one man, were\nhe Hercules himself. Dantes saw that he must attack the wedge. But\nhow? He cast his eyes around, and saw the horn full of powder which\nhis friend Jacopo had left him. He smiled; the infernal invention would\nserve him for this purpose. With the aid of his pickaxe, Dantes, after\nthe manner of a labor-saving pioneer, dug a mine between the upper rock\nand the one that supported it, filled it with powder, then made a match\nby rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre. He lighted it and retired. The\nexplosion soon followed; the upper rock was lifted from its base by the\nterrific force of the powder; the lower one flew into pieces; thousands\nof insects escaped from the aperture Dantes had previously formed, and\na huge snake, like the guardian demon of the treasure, rolled himself\nalong in darkening coils, and disappeared.\n\nDantes approached the upper rock, which now, without any support, leaned\ntowards the sea. The intrepid treasure-seeker walked round it, and,\nselecting the spot from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack,\nplaced his lever in one of the crevices, and strained every nerve to\nmove the mass. The rock, already shaken by the explosion, tottered\non its base. Dantes redoubled his efforts; he seemed like one of the\nancient Titans, who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the father\nof the gods. The rock yielded, rolled over, bounded from point to point,\nand finally disappeared in the ocean.\n\nOn the spot it had occupied was a circular space, exposing an iron ring\nlet into a square flag-stone. Dantes uttered a cry of joy and surprise;\nnever had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success. He\nwould fain have continued, but his knees trembled, and his heart beat\nso violently, and his sight became so dim, that he was forced to pause.\nThis feeling lasted but for a moment. Edmond inserted his lever in the\nring and exerted all his strength; the flag-stone yielded, and disclosed\nsteps that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a\nsubterraneous grotto. Any one else would have rushed on with a cry of\njoy. Dantes turned pale, hesitated, and reflected. \"Come,\" said he to\nhimself, \"be a man. I am accustomed to adversity. I must not be cast\ndown by the discovery that I have been deceived. What, then, would be\nthe use of all I have suffered? The heart breaks when, after having been\nelated by flattering hopes, it sees all its illusions destroyed. Faria\nhas dreamed this; the Cardinal Spada buried no treasure here; perhaps he\nnever came here, or if he did, Caesar Borgia, the intrepid adventurer,\nthe stealthy and indefatigable plunderer, has followed him, discovered\nhis traces, pursued them as I have done, raised the stone, and\ndescending before me, has left me nothing.\" He remained motionless and\npensive, his eyes fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his\nfeet.\n\n\"Now that I expect nothing, now that I no longer entertain the slightest\nhopes, the end of this adventure becomes simply a matter of curiosity.\"\nAnd he remained again motionless and thoughtful.\n\n\"Yes, yes; this is an adventure worthy a place in the varied career of\nthat royal bandit. This fabulous event formed but a link in a long chain\nof marvels. Yes, Borgia has been here, a torch in one hand, a sword in\nthe other, and within twenty paces, at the foot of this rock, perhaps\ntwo guards kept watch on land and sea, while their master descended, as\nI am about to descend, dispelling the darkness before his awe-inspiring\nprogress.\"\n\n\"But what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his secret?\"\nasked Dantes of himself.\n\n\"The fate,\" replied he, smiling, \"of those who buried Alaric.\"\n\n\"Yet, had he come,\" thought Dantes, \"he would have found the treasure,\nand Borgia, he who compared Italy to an artichoke, which he could devour\nleaf by leaf, knew too well the value of time to waste it in replacing\nthis rock. I will go down.\"\n\nThen he descended, a smile on his lips, and murmuring that last word of\nhuman philosophy, \"Perhaps!\" But instead of the darkness, and the thick\nand mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find, Dantes saw a dim and\nbluish light, which, as well as the air, entered, not merely by the\naperture he had just formed, but by the interstices and crevices of\nthe rock which were visible from without, and through which he could\ndistinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks,\nand the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the rocks. After having\nstood a few minutes in the cavern, the atmosphere of which was rather\nwarm than damp, Dantes' eye, habituated as it was to darkness, could\npierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern, which was of granite\nthat sparkled like diamonds. \"Alas,\" said Edmond, smiling, \"these are\nthe treasures the cardinal has left; and the good abbe, seeing in a\ndream these glittering walls, has indulged in fallacious hopes.\"\n\nBut he called to mind the words of the will, which he knew by heart. \"In\nthe farthest angle of the second opening,\" said the cardinal's will. He\nhad only found the first grotto; he had now to seek the second.\nDantes continued his search. He reflected that this second grotto must\npenetrate deeper into the island; he examined the stones, and sounded\none part of the wall where he fancied the opening existed, masked for\nprecaution's sake. The pickaxe struck for a moment with a dull sound\nthat drew out of Dantes' forehead large drops of perspiration. At last\nit seemed to him that one part of the wall gave forth a more hollow and\ndeeper echo; he eagerly advanced, and with the quickness of perception\nthat no one but a prisoner possesses, saw that there, in all\nprobability, the opening must be.\n\nHowever, he, like Caesar Borgia, knew the value of time; and, in\norder to avoid fruitless toil, he sounded all the other walls with his\npickaxe, struck the earth with the butt of his gun, and finding nothing\nthat appeared suspicious, returned to that part of the wall whence\nissued the consoling sound he had before heard. He again struck it, and\nwith greater force. Then a singular thing occurred. As he struck the\nwall, pieces of stucco similar to that used in the ground work of\narabesques broke off, and fell to the ground in flakes, exposing a large\nwhite stone. The aperture of the rock had been closed with stones, then\nthis stucco had been applied, and painted to imitate granite. Dantes\nstruck with the sharp end of his pickaxe, which entered someway between\nthe interstices. It was there he must dig. But by some strange play of\nemotion, in proportion as the proofs that Faria, had not been\ndeceived became stronger, so did his heart give way, and a feeling of\ndiscouragement stole over him. This last proof, instead of giving him\nfresh strength, deprived him of it; the pickaxe descended, or rather\nfell; he placed it on the ground, passed his hand over his brow, and\nremounted the stairs, alleging to himself, as an excuse, a desire to\nbe assured that no one was watching him, but in reality because he felt\nthat he was about to faint. The island was deserted, and the sun seemed\nto cover it with its fiery glance; afar off, a few small fishing boats\nstudded the bosom of the blue ocean.\n\nDantes had tasted nothing, but he thought not of hunger at such a\nmoment; he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum, and again entered the\ncavern. The pickaxe that had seemed so heavy, was now like a feather in\nhis grasp; he seized it, and attacked the wall. After several blows he\nperceived that the stones were not cemented, but had been merely placed\none upon the other, and covered with stucco; he inserted the point of\nhis pickaxe, and using the handle as a lever, with joy soon saw the\nstone turn as if on hinges, and fall at his feet. He had nothing more\nto do now, but with the iron tooth of the pickaxe to draw the stones\ntowards him one by one. The aperture was already sufficiently large for\nhim to enter, but by waiting, he could still cling to hope, and retard\nthe certainty of deception. At last, after renewed hesitation, Dantes\nentered the second grotto. The second grotto was lower and more gloomy\nthan the first; the air that could only enter by the newly formed\nopening had the mephitic smell Dantes was surprised not to find in the\nouter cavern. He waited in order to allow pure air to displace the foul\natmosphere, and then went on. At the left of the opening was a dark and\ndeep angle. But to Dantes' eye there was no darkness. He glanced around\nthis second grotto; it was, like the first, empty.\n\nThe treasure, if it existed, was buried in this corner. The time had\nat length arrived; two feet of earth removed, and Dantes' fate would\nbe decided. He advanced towards the angle, and summoning all his\nresolution, attacked the ground with the pickaxe. At the fifth or sixth\nblow the pickaxe struck against an iron substance. Never did funeral\nknell, never did alarm-bell, produce a greater effect on the hearer.\nHad Dantes found nothing he could not have become more ghastly pale.\nHe again struck his pickaxe into the earth, and encountered the same\nresistance, but not the same sound. \"It is a casket of wood bound with\niron,\" thought he. At this moment a shadow passed rapidly before the\nopening; Dantes seized his gun, sprang through the opening, and mounted\nthe stair. A wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave, and was\nfeeding at a little distance. This would have been a favorable occasion\nto secure his dinner; but Dantes feared lest the report of his gun\nshould attract attention.\n\nHe thought a moment, cut a branch of a resinous tree, lighted it at the\nfire at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast, and descended\nwith this torch. He wished to see everything. He approached the hole he\nhad dug, and now, with the aid of the torch, saw that his pickaxe had in\nreality struck against iron and wood. He planted his torch in the ground\nand resumed his labor. In an instant a space three feet long by two feet\nbroad was cleared, and Dantes could see an oaken coffer, bound with cut\nsteel; in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate, which\nwas still untarnished, the arms of the Spada family--viz., a sword,\npale, on an oval shield, like all the Italian armorial bearings, and\nsurmounted by a cardinal's hat; Dantes easily recognized them, Faria had\nso often drawn them for him. There was no longer any doubt: the treasure\nwas there--no one would have been at such pains to conceal an empty\ncasket. In an instant he had cleared every obstacle away, and he saw\nsuccessively the lock, placed between two padlocks, and the two handles\nat each end, all carved as things were carved at that epoch, when art\nrendered the commonest metals precious. Dantes seized the handles, and\nstrove to lift the coffer; it was impossible. He sought to open it; lock\nand padlock were fastened; these faithful guardians seemed unwilling\nto surrender their trust. Dantes inserted the sharp end of the pickaxe\nbetween the coffer and the lid, and pressing with all his force on the\nhandle, burst open the fastenings. The hinges yielded in their turn and\nfell, still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood, and the chest\nwas open.\n\nEdmond was seized with vertigo; he cocked his gun and laid it beside\nhim. He then closed his eyes as children do in order that they may see\nin the resplendent night of their own imagination more stars than are\nvisible in the firmament; then he re-opened them, and stood motionless\nwith amazement. Three compartments divided the coffer. In the first,\nblazed piles of golden coin; in the second, were ranged bars of\nunpolished gold, which possessed nothing attractive save their value;\nin the third, Edmond grasped handfuls of diamonds, pearls, and rubies,\nwhich, as they fell on one another, sounded like hail against glass.\nAfter having touched, felt, examined these treasures, Edmond rushed\nthrough the caverns like a man seized with frenzy; he leaped on a rock,\nfrom whence he could behold the sea. He was alone--alone with these\ncountless, these unheard-of treasures! was he awake, or was it but a\ndream?\n\nHe would fain have gazed upon his gold, and yet he had not strength\nenough; for an instant he leaned his head in his hands as if to prevent\nhis senses from leaving him, and then rushed madly about the rocks of\nMonte Cristo, terrifying the wild goats and scaring the sea-fowls with\nhis wild cries and gestures; then he returned, and, still unable to\nbelieve the evidence of his senses, rushed into the grotto, and found\nhimself before this mine of gold and jewels. This time he fell on\nhis knees, and, clasping his hands convulsively, uttered a prayer\nintelligible to God alone. He soon became calmer and more happy, for\nonly now did he begin to realize his felicity. He then set himself to\nwork to count his fortune. There were a thousand ingots of gold, each\nweighing from two to three pounds; then he piled up twenty-five thousand\ncrowns, each worth about eighty francs of our money, and bearing the\neffigies of Alexander VI. and his predecessors; and he saw that the\ncomplement was not half empty. And he measured ten double handfuls of\npearls, diamonds, and other gems, many of which, mounted by the most\nfamous workmen, were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth. Dantes\nsaw the light gradually disappear, and fearing to be surprised in the\ncavern, left it, his gun in his hand. A piece of biscuit and a small\nquantity of rum formed his supper, and he snatched a few hours' sleep,\nlying over the mouth of the cave.\n\nIt was a night of joy and terror, such as this man of stupendous\nemotions had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime.\n\n\n\nChapter 25. The Unknown.\n\nDay, for which Dantes had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open\neyes, again dawned. With the first light Dantes resumed his search.\nAgain he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening,\nand strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape;\nbut it wore the same wild, barren aspect when seen by the rays of the\nmorning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of\neve. Descending into the grotto, he lifted the stone, filled his pockets\nwith gems, put the box together as well and securely as he could,\nsprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken, and\nthen carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform\nappearance; then, quitting the grotto, he replaced the stone, heaping\non it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite,\nfilling the interstices with earth, into which he deftly inserted\nrapidly growing plants, such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn,\nthen carefully watering these new plantations, he scrupulously effaced\nevery trace of footsteps, leaving the approach to the cavern as\nsavage-looking and untrodden as he had found it. This done, he\nimpatiently awaited the return of his companions. To wait at Monte\nCristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost\nincalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied\nnot the cravings of his heart, which yearned to return to dwell among\nmankind, and to assume the rank, power, and influence which are always\naccorded to wealth--that first and greatest of all the forces within the\ngrasp of man.\n\nOn the sixth day, the smugglers returned. From a distance Dantes\nrecognized the rig and handling of The Young Amelia, and dragging\nhimself with affected difficulty towards the landing-place, he met his\ncompanions with an assurance that, although considerably better than\nwhen they quitted him, he still suffered acutely from his late accident.\nHe then inquired how they had fared in their trip. To this question the\nsmugglers replied that, although successful in landing their cargo in\nsafety, they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a\nguard-ship had just quitted the port of Toulon and was crowding all\nsail towards them. This obliged them to make all the speed they could to\nevade the enemy, when they could but lament the absence of Dantes, whose\nsuperior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so\nmaterially. In fact, the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them\nwhen, fortunately, night came on, and enabled them to double the Cape of\nCorsica, and so elude all further pursuit. Upon the whole, however, the\ntrip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned; while\nthe crew, and particularly Jacopo, expressed great regrets that Dantes\nhad not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits, which\namounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each.\n\nEdmond preserved the most admirable self-command, not suffering the\nfaintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all\nthe benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island;\nbut as The Young Amelia had merely come to Monte Cristo to fetch him\naway, he embarked that same evening, and proceeded with the captain to\nLeghorn. Arrived at Leghorn, he repaired to the house of a Jew, a dealer\nin precious stones, to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds\nfor five thousand francs each. Dantes half feared that such valuable\njewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite\nsuspicion; but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions\nconcerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least\neighty per cent.\n\nThe following day Dantes presented Jacopo with an entirely new vessel,\naccompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres, that he\nmight provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his\noutfit, upon condition that he would go at once to Marseilles for the\npurpose of inquiring after an old man named Louis Dantes, residing\nin the Allees de Meillan, and also a young woman called Mercedes, an\ninhabitant of the Catalan village. Jacopo could scarcely believe his\nsenses at receiving this magnificent present, which Dantes hastened to\naccount for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a\ndesire to spite his family, who did not allow him as much money as he\nliked to spend; but that on his arrival at Leghorn he had come into\npossession of a large fortune, left him by an uncle, whose sole heir\nhe was. The superior education of Dantes gave an air of such extreme\nprobability to this statement that it never once occurred to Jacopo to\ndoubt its accuracy. The term for which Edmond had engaged to serve on\nboard The Young Amelia having expired, Dantes took leave of the captain,\nwho at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain\nas one of the crew, but having been told the history of the legacy, he\nceased to importune him further. The following morning Jacopo set sail\nfor Marseilles, with directions from Dantes to join him at the Island of\nMonte Cristo.\n\nHaving seen Jacopo fairly out of the harbor, Dantes proceeded to make\nhis final adieus on board The Young Amelia, distributing so liberal a\ngratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all,\nand expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him. To the\ncaptain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his\nfuture plans. Then Dantes departed for Genoa. At the moment of his\narrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay; this yacht had been\nbuilt by order of an Englishman, who, having heard that the Genoese\nexcelled all other builders along the shores of the Mediterranean in\nthe construction of fast-sailing vessels, was desirous of possessing a\nspecimen of their skill; the price agreed upon between the Englishman\nand the Genoese builder was forty thousand francs. Dantes, struck with\nthe beauty and capability of the little vessel, applied to its owner to\ntransfer it to him, offering sixty thousand francs, upon condition that\nhe should be allowed to take immediate possession. The proposal was too\nadvantageous to be refused, the more so as the person for whom the\nyacht was intended had gone upon a tour through Switzerland, and was\nnot expected back in less than three weeks or a month, by which time\nthe builder reckoned upon being able to complete another. A bargain was\ntherefore struck. Dantes led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of\na Jew; retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor,\nand upon their return the Jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of\nsixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces.\n\nThe delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable\ncrew for the little vessel, but this Dantes declined with many thanks,\nsaying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone, and his principal\npleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself; the only thing the\nbuilder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet\nin the cabin at his bed's head, the closet to contain three divisions,\nso constructed as to be concealed from all but himself. The builder\ncheerfully undertook the commission, and promised to have these secret\nplaces completed by the next day, Dantes furnishing the dimensions and\nplan in accordance with which they were to be constructed.\n\nThe following day Dantes sailed with his yacht from Genoa, under the\ninspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the\nrich Spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht. But their\nwonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with\nwhich Dantes handled the helm. The boat, indeed, seemed to be animated\nwith almost human intelligence, so promptly did it obey the slightest\ntouch; and Dantes required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to\nacknowledge that the Genoese had not without reason attained their\nhigh reputation in the art of shipbuilding. The spectators followed the\nlittle vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible; they then\nturned their conjectures upon her probable destination. Some insisted\nshe was making for Corsica, others the Island of Elba; bets were offered\nto any amount that she was bound for Spain; while Africa was positively\nreported by many persons as her intended course; but no one thought of\nMonte Cristo. Yet thither it was that Dantes guided his vessel, and at\nMonte Cristo he arrived at the close of the second day; his boat had\nproved herself a first-class sailer, and had come the distance from\nGenoa in thirty-five hours. Dantes had carefully noted the general\nappearance of the shore, and, instead of landing at the usual place, he\ndropped anchor in the little creek. The island was utterly deserted, and\nbore no evidence of having been visited since he went away; his treasure\nwas just as he had left it. Early on the following morning he commenced\nthe removal of his riches, and ere nightfall the whole of his immense\nwealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker.\n\nA week passed by. Dantes employed it in manoeuvring his yacht round the\nisland, studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined\nfor some important service, till at the end of that time he was\nperfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities. The former Dantes\nproposed to augment, the latter to remedy.\n\nUpon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail\napproaching Monte Cristo. As it drew near, he recognized it as the boat\nhe had given to Jacopo. He immediately signalled it. His signal was\nreturned, and in two hours afterwards the new-comer lay at anchor beside\nthe yacht. A mournful answer awaited each of Edmond's eager inquiries\nas to the information Jacopo had obtained. Old Dantes was dead, and\nMercedes had disappeared. Dantes listened to these melancholy tidings\nwith outward calmness; but, leaping lightly ashore, he signified his\ndesire to be quite alone. In a couple of hours he returned. Two of the\nmen from Jacopo's boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating\nit, and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to Marseilles.\nFor his father's death he was in some manner prepared; but he knew not\nhow to account for the mysterious disappearance of Mercedes.\n\nWithout divulging his secret, Dantes could not give sufficiently clear\ninstructions to an agent. There were, besides, other particulars he\nwas desirous of ascertaining, and those were of a nature he alone could\ninvestigate in a manner satisfactory to himself. His looking-glass\nhad assured him, during his stay at Leghorn, that he ran no risk of\nrecognition; moreover, he had now the means of adopting any disguise\nhe thought proper. One fine morning, then, his yacht, followed by the\nlittle fishing-boat, boldly entered the port of Marseilles, and anchored\nexactly opposite the spot from whence, on the never-to-be-forgotten\nnight of his departure for the Chateau d'If, he had been put on board\nthe boat destined to convey him thither. Still Dantes could not view\nwithout a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the\nofficers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was\npermitted to hold communication with the shore; but with that perfect\nself-possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with Faria,\nDantes coolly presented an English passport he had obtained from\nLeghorn, and as this gave him a standing which a French passport would\nnot have afforded, he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his\nimmediate debarkation.\n\nThe first person to attract the attention of Dantes, as he landed on the\nCanebiere, was one of the crew belonging to the Pharaon. Edmond welcomed\nthe meeting with this fellow--who had been one of his own sailors--as a\nsure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in\nhis own appearance. Going straight towards him, he propounded a variety\nof questions on different subjects, carefully watching the man's\ncountenance as he did so; but not a word or look implied that he had the\nslightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was\nthen conversing. Giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his\ncivility, Dantes proceeded onwards; but ere he had gone many steps he\nheard the man loudly calling him to stop. Dantes instantly turned to\nmeet him. \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" said the honest fellow, in almost\nbreathless haste, \"but I believe you made a mistake; you intended to\ngive me a two-franc piece, and see, you gave me a double Napoleon.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my good friend. I see that I have made a trifling mistake,\nas you say; but by way of rewarding your honesty I give you another\ndouble Napoleon, that you may drink to my health, and be able to ask\nyour messmates to join you.\"\n\nSo extreme was the surprise of the sailor, that he was unable even\nto thank Edmond, whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in\nspeechless astonishment. \"Some nabob from India,\" was his comment.\n\nDantes, meanwhile, went on his way. Each step he trod oppressed his\nheart with fresh emotion; his first and most indelible recollections\nwere there; not a tree, not a street, that he passed but seemed filled\nwith dear and cherished memories. And thus he proceeded onwards till he\narrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles, from whence a full view of\nthe Allees de Meillan was obtained. At this spot, so pregnant with fond\nand filial remembrances, his heart beat almost to bursting, his knees\ntottered under him, a mist floated over his sight, and had he not clung\nfor support to one of the trees, he would inevitably have fallen to the\nground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing\nthere. Recovering himself, however, he wiped the perspiration from his\nbrows, and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the\nhouse in which his father had lived.\n\nThe nasturtiums and other plants, which his father had delighted to\ntrain before his window, had all disappeared from the upper part of the\nhouse. Leaning against the tree, he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the\nupper stories of the shabby little house. Then he advanced to the door,\nand asked whether there were any rooms to be let. Though answered in the\nnegative, he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on\nthe fifth floor, that, in despite of the oft-repeated assurance of the\nconcierge that they were occupied, Dantes succeeded in inducing the\nman to go up to the tenants, and ask permission for a gentleman to be\nallowed to look at them.\n\nThe tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been\nscarcely married a week; and seeing them, Dantes sighed heavily. Nothing\nin the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been\nin the time of the elder Dantes; the very paper was different, while the\narticles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in\nEdmond's time had all disappeared; the four walls alone remained as he\nhad left them. The bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as\nthe former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his; and, in\nspite of his efforts to prevent it, the eyes of Edmond were suffused\nin tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed\nhis last, vainly calling for his son. The young couple gazed with\nastonishment at the sight of their visitor's emotion, and wondered to\nsee the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern\nand immovable features; but they felt the sacredness of his grief,\nand kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause, while, with\ninstinctive delicacy, they left him to indulge his sorrow alone. When\nhe withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections, they both\naccompanied him downstairs, reiterating their hope that he would come\nagain whenever he pleased, and assuring him that their poor dwelling\nwould ever be open to him. As Edmond passed the door on the fourth\nfloor, he paused to inquire whether Caderousse the tailor still dwelt\nthere; but he received, for reply, that the person in question had got\ninto difficulties, and at the present time kept a small inn on the route\nfrom Bellegarde to Beaucaire.\n\nHaving obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the\nAllees de Meillan belonged, Dantes next proceeded thither, and, under\nthe name of Lord Wilmore (the name and title inscribed on his passport),\npurchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty-five thousand francs,\nat least ten thousand more than it was worth; but had its owner asked\nhalf a million, it would unhesitatingly have been given. The very same\nday the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house, now\nbecome the property of Dantes, were duly informed by the notary who had\narranged the necessary transfer of deeds, etc., that the new landlord\ngave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house, without the\nleast augmentation of rent, upon condition of their giving instant\npossession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited.\n\nThis strange event aroused great wonder and curiosity in the\nneighborhood of the Allees de Meillan, and a multitude of theories\nwere afloat, none of which was anywhere near the truth. But what raised\npublic astonishment to a climax, and set all conjecture at defiance, was\nthe knowledge that the same stranger who had in the morning visited the\nAllees de Meillan had been seen in the evening walking in the little\nvillage of the Catalans, and afterwards observed to enter a poor\nfisherman's hut, and to pass more than an hour in inquiring after\npersons who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or\nsixteen years. But on the following day the family from whom all these\nparticulars had been asked received a handsome present, consisting of an\nentirely new fishing-boat, with two seines and a tender. The delighted\nrecipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out\ntheir thanks to their generous benefactor, but they had seen him,\nupon quitting the hut, merely give some orders to a sailor, and then\nspringing lightly on horseback, leave Marseilles by the Porte d'Aix.\n\n\n\nChapter 26. The Pont du Gard Inn.\n\nSuch of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south\nof France may perchance have noticed, about midway between the town of\nBeaucaire and the village of Bellegarde,--a little nearer to the former\nthan to the latter,--a small roadside inn, from the front of which\nhung, creaking and flapping in the wind, a sheet of tin covered with\na grotesque representation of the Pont du Gard. This modern place of\nentertainment stood on the left-hand side of the post road, and backed\nupon the Rhone. It also boasted of what in Languedoc is styled a garden,\nconsisting of a small plot of ground, on the side opposite to the main\nentrance reserved for the reception of guests. A few dingy olives and\nstunted fig-trees struggled hard for existence, but their withered dusty\nfoliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict. Between these\nsickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic, tomatoes, and eschalots;\nwhile, lone and solitary, like a forgotten sentinel, a tall pine raised\nits melancholy head in one of the corners of this unattractive spot, and\ndisplayed its flexible stem and fan-shaped summit dried and cracked by\nthe fierce heat of the sub-tropical sun.\n\nIn the surrounding plain, which more resembled a dusty lake than solid\nground, were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat, the effect,\nno doubt, of a curious desire on the part of the agriculturists of the\ncountry to see whether such a thing as the raising of grain in those\nparched regions was practicable. Each stalk served as a perch for a\ngrasshopper, which regaled the passers by through this Egyptian scene\nwith its strident, monotonous note.\n\nFor about seven or eight years the little tavern had been kept by a man\nand his wife, with two servants,--a chambermaid named Trinette, and\na hostler called Pecaud. This small staff was quite equal to all\nthe requirements, for a canal between Beaucaire and Aiguemortes had\nrevolutionized transportation by substituting boats for the cart and\nthe stagecoach. And, as though to add to the daily misery which this\nprosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate inn-keeper, whose utter\nruin it was fast accomplishing, it was situated between the Rhone from\nwhich it had its source and the post-road it had depleted, not a\nhundred steps from the inn, of which we have given a brief but faithful\ndescription.\n\nThe inn-keeper himself was a man of from forty to fifty-five years of\nage, tall, strong, and bony, a perfect specimen of the natives of those\nsouthern latitudes; he had dark, sparkling, and deep-set eyes, hooked\nnose, and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal; his hair, like\nhis beard, which he wore under his chin, was thick and curly, and in\nspite of his age but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads.\nHis naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown\nfrom the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself\nfrom morning till eve at the threshold of his door, on the lookout for\nguests who seldom came, yet there he stood, day after day, exposed to\nthe meridional rays of a burning sun, with no other protection for his\nhead than a red handkerchief twisted around it, after the manner of\nthe Spanish muleteers. This man was our old acquaintance, Gaspard\nCaderousse. His wife, on the contrary, whose maiden name had been\nMadeleine Radelle, was pale, meagre, and sickly-looking. Born in the\nneighborhood of Arles, she had shared in the beauty for which its women\nare proverbial; but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the\ndevastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers\nby the ponds of Aiguemortes and the marshes of Camargue. She remained\nnearly always in her second-floor chamber, shivering in her chair, or\nstretched languid and feeble on her bed, while her husband kept his\ndaily watch at the door--a duty he performed with so much the greater\nwillingness, as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless\nplaints and murmurs of his helpmate, who never saw him without breaking\nout into bitter invectives against fate; to all of which her husband\nwould calmly return an unvarying reply, in these philosophic words:--\n\n\"Hush, La Carconte. It is God's pleasure that things should be so.\"\n\nThe sobriquet of La Carconte had been bestowed on Madeleine Radelle\nfrom the fact that she had been born in a village, so called, situated\nbetween Salon and Lambesc; and as a custom existed among the inhabitants\nof that part of France where Caderousse lived of styling every person by\nsome particular and distinctive appellation, her husband had bestowed on\nher the name of La Carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of\nMadeleine, which, in all probability, his rude gutteral language would\nnot have enabled him to pronounce. Still, let it not be supposed\nthat amid this affected resignation to the will of Providence, the\nunfortunate inn-keeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing\nthe hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits, and the daily\ninfliction of his peevish partner's murmurs and lamentations.\n\nLike other dwellers in the south, he was a man of sober habits and\nmoderate desires, but fond of external show, vain, and addicted to\ndisplay. During the days of his prosperity, not a festivity took place\nwithout himself and wife being among the spectators. He dressed in the\npicturesque costume worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the\nsouth of France, bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by\nthe Catalans and Andalusians; while La Carconte displayed the charming\nfashion prevalent among the women of Arles, a mode of attire borrowed\nequally from Greece and Arabia. But, by degrees, watch-chains,\nnecklaces, parti-colored scarfs, embroidered bodices, velvet vests,\nelegantly worked stockings, striped gaiters, and silver buckles for the\nshoes, all disappeared; and Gaspard Caderousse, unable to appear abroad\nin his pristine splendor, had given up any further participation in the\npomps and vanities, both for himself and wife, although a bitter feeling\nof envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry\nmusic from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to\nwhich he still clung, more for the shelter than the profit it afforded.\n\nCaderousse, then, was, as usual, at his place of observation before\nthe door, his eyes glancing listlessly from a piece of closely shaven\ngrass--on which some fowls were industriously, though fruitlessly,\nendeavoring to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate--to\nthe deserted road, which led away to the north and south, when he was\naroused by the shrill voice of his wife, and grumbling to himself as he\nwent, he mounted to her chamber, first taking care, however, to set the\nentrance door wide open, as an invitation to any chance traveller who\nmight be passing.\n\nAt the moment Caderousse quitted his sentry-like watch before the door,\nthe road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and\nlonely as a desert at mid-day. There it lay stretching out into one\ninterminable line of dust and sand, with its sides bordered by tall,\nmeagre trees, altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance, that no\none in his senses could have imagined that any traveller, at liberty\nto regulate his hours for journeying, would choose to expose himself in\nsuch a formidable Sahara. Nevertheless, had Caderousse but retained\nhis post a few minutes longer, he might have caught a dim outline of\nsomething approaching from the direction of Bellegarde; as the moving\nobject drew nearer, he would easily have perceived that it consisted of\na man and horse, between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding\nappeared to exist. The horse was of Hungarian breed, and ambled along\nat an easy pace. His rider was a priest, dressed in black, and wearing a\nthree-cornered hat; and, spite of the ardent rays of a noonday sun, the\npair came on with a fair degree of rapidity.\n\nHaving arrived before the Pont du Gard, the horse stopped, but whether\nfor his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult\nto say. However that might have been, the priest, dismounting, led his\nsteed by the bridle in search of some place to which he could secure\nhim. Availing himself of a handle that projected from a half-fallen\ndoor, he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton\nhandkerchief, from his pocket, wiped away the perspiration that streamed\nfrom his brow, then, advancing to the door, struck thrice with the end\nof his iron-shod stick. At this unusual sound, a huge black dog came\nrushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil\nabode, snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined\nhostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to\nsociety. At that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the\nwooden staircase that led from the upper floor, and, with many bows and\ncourteous smiles, mine host of the Pont du Gard besought his guest to\nenter.\n\n\"You are welcome, sir, most welcome!\" repeated the astonished\nCaderousse. \"Now, then, Margotin,\" cried he, speaking to the dog, \"will\nyou be quiet? Pray don't heed him, sir!--he only barks, he never bites.\nI make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully\nhot day.\" Then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller\nhe had to entertain, Caderousse hastily exclaimed: \"A thousand pardons!\nI really did not observe whom I had the honor to receive under my poor\nroof. What would the abbe please to have? What refreshment can I offer?\nAll I have is at his service.\"\n\nThe priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching\ngaze--there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar\nscrutiny on the part of the inn-keeper; then, observing in the\ncountenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at\nhis own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded, he deemed\nit as well to terminate this dumb show, and therefore said, speaking\nwith a strong Italian accent, \"You are, I presume, M. Caderousse?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered the host, even more surprised at the question\nthan he had been by the silence which had preceded it; \"I am Gaspard\nCaderousse, at your service.\"\n\n\"Gaspard Caderousse,\" rejoined the priest. \"Yes,--Christian and surname\nare the same. You formerly lived, I believe in the Allees de Meillan, on\nthe fourth floor?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"And you followed the business of a tailor?\"\n\n\"True, I was a tailor, till the trade fell off. It is so hot at\nMarseilles, that really I believe that the respectable inhabitants will\nin time go without any clothing whatever. But talking of heat, is there\nnothing I can offer you by way of refreshment?\"\n\n\"Yes; let me have a bottle of your best wine, and then, with your\npermission, we will resume our conversation from where we left off.\"\n\n\"As you please, sir,\" said Caderousse, who, anxious not to lose the\npresent opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of\nCahors still remaining in his possession, hastily raised a trap-door in\nthe floor of the apartment they were in, which served both as parlor\nand kitchen. Upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the\nexpiration of five minutes, he found the abbe seated upon a wooden\nstool, leaning his elbow on a table, while Margotin, whose animosity\nseemed appeased by the unusual command of the traveller for\nrefreshments, had crept up to him, and had established himself very\ncomfortably between his knees, his long, skinny neck resting on his lap,\nwhile his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the traveller's face.\n\n\"Are you quite alone?\" inquired the guest, as Caderousse placed before\nhim the bottle of wine and a glass.\n\n\"Quite, quite alone,\" replied the man--\"or, at least, practically so,\nfor my poor wife, who is the only person in the house besides myself, is\nlaid up with illness, and unable to render me the least assistance, poor\nthing!\"\n\n\"You are married, then?\" said the priest, with a show of interest,\nglancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment.\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" said Caderousse with a sigh, \"it is easy to perceive I am not\na rich man; but in this world a man does not thrive the better for being\nhonest.\" The abbe fixed on him a searching, penetrating glance.\n\n\"Yes, honest--I can certainly say that much for myself,\" continued the\ninn-keeper, fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbe's gaze; \"I\ncan boast with truth of being an honest man; and,\" continued he\nsignificantly, with a hand on his breast and shaking his head, \"that is\nmore than every one can say nowadays.\"\n\n\"So much the better for you, if what you assert be true,\" said the\nabbe; \"for I am firmly persuaded that, sooner or later, the good will be\nrewarded, and the wicked punished.\"\n\n\"Such words as those belong to your profession,\" answered Caderousse,\n\"and you do well to repeat them; but,\" added he, with a bitter\nexpression of countenance, \"one is free to believe them or not, as one\npleases.\"\n\n\"You are wrong to speak thus,\" said the abbe; \"and perhaps I may, in my\nown person, be able to prove to you how completely you are in error.\"\n\n\"What mean you?\" inquired Caderousse with a look of surprise.\n\n\"In the first place, I must be satisfied that you are the person I am in\nsearch of.\"\n\n\"What proofs do you require?\"\n\n\"Did you, in the year 1814 or 1815, know anything of a young sailor\nnamed Dantes?\"\n\n\"Dantes? Did I know poor dear Edmond? Why, Edmond Dantes and myself\nwere intimate friends!\" exclaimed Caderousse, whose countenance flushed\ndarkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbe fixed on him, while\nthe clear, calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish\nscrutiny.\n\n\"You remind me,\" said the priest, \"that the young man concerning whom I\nasked you was said to bear the name of Edmond.\"\n\n\"Said to bear the name!\" repeated Caderousse, becoming excited and\neager. \"Why, he was so called as truly as I myself bore the appellation\nof Gaspard Caderousse; but tell me, I pray, what has become of poor\nEdmond? Did you know him? Is he alive and at liberty? Is he prosperous\nand happy?\"\n\n\"He died a more wretched, hopeless, heart-broken prisoner than the\nfelons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of Toulon.\"\n\nA deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of Caderousse, who\nturned away, and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with\nthe corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head.\n\n\"Poor fellow, poor fellow!\" murmured Caderousse. \"Well, there, sir, is\nanother proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth, and\nthat none but the wicked prosper. Ah,\" continued Caderousse, speaking\nin the highly colored language of the south, \"the world grows worse and\nworse. Why does not God, if he really hates the wicked, as he is said to\ndo, send down brimstone and fire, and consume them altogether?\"\n\n\"You speak as though you had loved this young Dantes,\" observed the\nabbe, without taking any notice of his companion's vehemence.\n\n\"And so I did,\" replied Caderousse; \"though once, I confess, I envied\nhim his good fortune. But I swear to you, sir, I swear to you, by\neverything a man holds dear, I have, since then, deeply and sincerely\nlamented his unhappy fate.\" There was a brief silence, during which\nthe fixed, searching eye of the abbe was employed in scrutinizing the\nagitated features of the inn-keeper.\n\n\"You knew the poor lad, then?\" continued Caderousse.\n\n\"I was called to see him on his dying bed, that I might administer to\nhim the consolations of religion.\"\n\n\"And of what did he die?\" asked Caderousse in a choking voice.\n\n\"Of what, think you, do young and strong men die in prison, when\nthey have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year, unless it be of\nimprisonment?\" Caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration\nthat gathered on his brow.\n\n\"But the strangest part of the story is,\" resumed the abbe, \"that\nDantes, even in his dying moments, swore by his crucified Redeemer, that\nhe was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention.\"\n\n\"And so he was,\" murmured Caderousse. \"How should he have been\notherwise? Ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.\"\n\n\"And for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he\nhad never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any\nfoul spot or stain have fallen on it.\"\n\nAnd here the look of the abbe, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to\nrest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was\nrapidly spreading over the countenance of Caderousse.\n\n\"A rich Englishman,\" continued the abbe, \"who had been his companion\nin misfortune, but had been released from prison during the second\nrestoration, was possessed of a diamond of immense value; this jewel he\nbestowed on Dantes upon himself quitting the prison, as a mark of his\ngratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which Dantes had\nnursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement.\nInstead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers,\nwho might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor,\nDantes carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of\nprison he might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a diamond\nwould have quite sufficed to make his fortune.\"\n\n\"Then, I suppose,\" asked Caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, \"that it\nwas a stone of immense value?\"\n\n\"Why, everything is relative,\" answered the abbe. \"To one in Edmond's\nposition the diamond certainly was of great value. It was estimated at\nfifty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Bless me!\" exclaimed Caderousse, \"fifty thousand francs! Surely the\ndiamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the abbe, \"it was not of such a size as that; but you\nshall judge for yourself. I have it with me.\"\n\nThe sharp gaze of Caderousse was instantly directed towards the priest's\ngarments, as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure.\nCalmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black\nshagreen, the abbe opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of\nCaderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of admirable\nworkmanship. \"And that diamond,\" cried Caderousse, almost breathless\nwith eager admiration, \"you say, is worth fifty thousand francs?\"\n\n\"It is, without the setting, which is also valuable,\" replied the abbe,\nas he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its brilliant\nhues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated inn-keeper.\n\n\"But how comes the diamond in your possession, sir? Did Edmond make you\nhis heir?\"\n\n\"No, merely his testamentary executor. 'I once possessed four dear and\nfaithful friends, besides the maiden to whom I was betrothed' he said;\n'and I feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss.\nThe name of one of the four friends is Caderousse.'\" The inn-keeper\nshivered.\n\n\"'Another of the number,'\" continued the abbe, without seeming to notice\nthe emotion of Caderousse, \"'is called Danglars; and the third, in spite\nof being my rival, entertained a very sincere affection for me.'\" A\nfiendish smile played over the features of Caderousse, who was about to\nbreak in upon the abbe's speech, when the latter, waving his hand, said,\n\"Allow me to finish first, and then if you have any observations to\nmake, you can do so afterwards. 'The third of my friends, although\nmy rival, was much attached to me,--his name was Fernand; that of my\nbetrothed was'--Stay, stay,\" continued the abbe, \"I have forgotten what\nhe called her.\"\n\n\"Mercedes,\" said Caderousse eagerly.\n\n\"True,\" said the abbe, with a stifled sigh, \"Mercedes it was.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" urged Caderousse.\n\n\"Bring me a carafe of water,\" said the abbe.\n\nCaderousse quickly performed the stranger's bidding; and after pouring\nsome into a glass, and slowly swallowing its contents, the abbe,\nresuming his usual placidity of manner, said, as he placed his empty\nglass on the table,--\"Where did we leave off?\"\n\n\"The name of Edmond's betrothed was Mercedes.\"\n\n\"To be sure. 'You will go to Marseilles,' said Dantes,--for you\nunderstand, I repeat his words just as he uttered them. Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"'You will sell this diamond; you will divide the money into five equal\nparts, and give an equal portion to these good friends, the only persons\nwho have loved me upon earth.'\"\n\n\"But why into five parts?\" asked Caderousse; \"you only mentioned four\npersons.\"\n\n\"Because the fifth is dead, as I hear. The fifth sharer in Edmond's\nbequest, was his own father.\"\n\n\"Too true, too true!\" ejaculated Caderousse, almost suffocated by the\ncontending passions which assailed him, \"the poor old man did die.\"\n\n\"I learned so much at Marseilles,\" replied the abbe, making a strong\neffort to appear indifferent; \"but from the length of time that has\nelapsed since the death of the elder Dantes, I was unable to obtain any\nparticulars of his end. Can you enlighten me on that point?\"\n\n\"I do not know who could if I could not,\" said Caderousse. \"Why, I lived\nalmost on the same floor with the poor old man. Ah, yes, about a year\nafter the disappearance of his son the poor old man died.\"\n\n\"Of what did he die?\"\n\n\"Why, the doctors called his complaint gastro-enteritis, I believe;\nhis acquaintances say he died of grief; but I, who saw him in his dying\nmoments, I say he died of\"--Caderousse paused.\n\n\"Of what?\" asked the priest, anxiously and eagerly.\n\n\"Why, of downright starvation.\"\n\n\"Starvation!\" exclaimed the abbe, springing from his seat. \"Why, the\nvilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that. The very\ndogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying\nhand to cast them a mouthful of bread; and that a man, a Christian,\nshould be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who\ncall themselves Christians, is too horrible for belief. Oh, it is\nimpossible--utterly impossible!\"\n\n\"What I have said, I have said,\" answered Caderousse.\n\n\"And you are a fool for having said anything about it,\" said a voice\nfrom the top of the stairs. \"Why should you meddle with what does not\nconcern you?\"\n\nThe two men turned quickly, and saw the sickly countenance of La\nCarconte peering between the baluster rails; attracted by the sound of\nvoices, she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs, and, seated\non the lower step, head on knees, she had listened to the foregoing\nconversation. \"Mind your own business, wife,\" replied Caderousse\nsharply. \"This gentleman asks me for information, which common\npoliteness will not permit me to refuse.\"\n\n\"Politeness, you simpleton!\" retorted La Carconte. \"What have you to\ndo with politeness, I should like to know? Better study a little common\nprudence. How do you know the motives that person may have for trying to\nextract all he can from you?\"\n\n\"I pledge you my word, madam,\" said the abbe, \"that my intentions are\ngood; and that you husband can incur no risk, provided he answers me\ncandidly.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's all very fine,\" retorted the woman. \"Nothing is easier than\nto begin with fair promises and assurances of nothing to fear; but when\npoor, silly folks, like my husband there, have been persuaded to\ntell all they know, the promises and assurances of safety are quickly\nforgotten; and at some moment when nobody is expecting it, behold\ntrouble and misery, and all sorts of persecutions, are heaped on the\nunfortunate wretches, who cannot even see whence all their afflictions\ncome.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, my good woman, make yourself perfectly easy, I beg of\nyou. Whatever evils may befall you, they will not be occasioned by my\ninstrumentality, that I solemnly promise you.\"\n\nLa Carconte muttered a few inarticulate words, then let her head again\ndrop upon her knees, and went into a fit of ague, leaving the two\nspeakers to resume the conversation, but remaining so as to be able to\nhear every word they uttered. Again the abbe had been obliged to swallow\na draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower\nhim. When he had sufficiently recovered himself, he said, \"It appears,\nthen, that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken\nby every one. Surely, had not such been the case, he would not have\nperished by so dreadful a death.\"\n\n\"Why, he was not altogether forsaken,\" continued Caderousse, \"for\nMercedes the Catalan and Monsieur Morrel were very kind to him;\nbut somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for\nFernand--the very person,\" added Caderousse with a bitter smile,\n\"that you named just now as being one of Dantes' faithful and attached\nfriends.\"\n\n\"And was he not so?\" asked the abbe.\n\n\"Gaspard, Gaspard!\" murmured the woman, from her seat on the stairs,\n\"mind what you are saying!\" Caderousse made no reply to these words,\nthough evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption, but,\naddressing the abbe, said, \"Can a man be faithful to another whose wife\nhe covets and desires for himself? But Dantes was so honorable and\ntrue in his own nature, that he believed everybody's professions of\nfriendship. Poor Edmond, he was cruelly deceived; but it was fortunate\nthat he never knew, or he might have found it more difficult, when on\nhis deathbed, to pardon his enemies. And, whatever people may say,\"\ncontinued Caderousse, in his native language, which was not altogether\ndevoid of rude poetry, \"I cannot help being more frightened at the idea\nof the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living.\"\n\n\"Imbecile!\" exclaimed La Carconte.\n\n\"Do you, then, know in what manner Fernand injured Dantes?\" inquired the\nabbe of Caderousse.\n\n\"Do I? No one better.\"\n\n\"Speak out then, say what it was!\"\n\n\"Gaspard!\" cried La Carconte, \"do as you will; you are master--but if\nyou take my advice you'll hold your tongue.\"\n\n\"Well, wife,\" replied Caderousse, \"I don't know but what you're right!\"\n\n\"So you will say nothing?\" asked the abbe.\n\n\"Why, what good would it do?\" asked Caderousse. \"If the poor lad were\nliving, and came to me and begged that I would candidly tell which\nwere his true and which his false friends, why, perhaps, I should not\nhesitate. But you tell me he is no more, and therefore can have nothing\nto do with hatred or revenge, so let all such feeling be buried with\nhim.\"\n\n\"You prefer, then,\" said the abbe, \"that I should bestow on men you say\nare false and treacherous, the reward intended for faithful friendship?\"\n\n\"That is true enough,\" returned Caderousse. \"You say truly, the gift\nof poor Edmond was not meant for such traitors as Fernand and Danglars;\nbesides, what would it be to them? no more than a drop of water in the\nocean.\"\n\n\"Remember,\" chimed in La Carconte, \"those two could crush you at a\nsingle blow!\"\n\n\"How so?\" inquired the abbe. \"Are these persons, then, so rich and\npowerful?\"\n\n\"Do you not know their history?\"\n\n\"I do not. Pray relate it to me!\" Caderousse seemed to reflect for a few\nmoments, then said, \"No, truly, it would take up too much time.\"\n\n\"Well, my good friend,\" returned the abbe, in a tone that indicated\nutter indifference on his part, \"you are at liberty, either to speak or\nbe silent, just as you please; for my own part, I respect your scruples\nand admire your sentiments; so let the matter end. I shall do my duty\nas conscientiously as I can, and fulfil my promise to the dying man. My\nfirst business will be to dispose of this diamond.\" So saying, the abbe\nagain draw the small box from his pocket, opened it, and contrived to\nhold it in such a light, that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed\nbefore the dazzled gaze of Caderousse.\n\n\"Wife, wife!\" cried he in a hoarse voice, \"come here!\"\n\n\"Diamond!\" exclaimed La Carconte, rising and descending to the chamber\nwith a tolerably firm step; \"what diamond are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Why, did you not hear all we said?\" inquired Caderousse. \"It is a\nbeautiful diamond left by poor Edmond Dantes, to be sold, and the money\ndivided between his father, Mercedes, his betrothed bride, Fernand,\nDanglars, and myself. The jewel is worth at least fifty thousand\nfrancs.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a magnificent jewel!\" cried the astonished woman.\n\n\"The fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then, does\nit not?\" asked Caderousse.\n\n\"It does,\" replied the abbe; \"with the addition of an equal division\nof that part intended for the elder Dantes, which I believe myself at\nliberty to divide equally with the four survivors.\"\n\n\"And why among us four?\" inquired Caderousse.\n\n\"As being the friends Edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him.\"\n\n\"I don't call those friends who betray and ruin you,\" murmured the wife\nin her turn, in a low, muttering voice.\n\n\"Of course not!\" rejoined Caderousse quickly; \"no more do I, and that\nwas what I was observing to this gentleman just now. I said I looked\nupon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery, perhaps\ncrime.\"\n\n\"Remember,\" answered the abbe calmly, as he replaced the jewel and its\ncase in the pocket of his cassock, \"it is your fault, not mine, that I\ndo so. You will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both\nFernand and Danglars, in order that I may execute Edmond's last\nwishes.\" The agitation of Caderousse became extreme, and large drops of\nperspiration rolled from his heated brow. As he saw the abbe rise from\nhis seat and go towards the door, as though to ascertain if his horse\nwere sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey, Caderousse and his\nwife exchanged looks of deep meaning.\n\n\"There, you see, wife,\" said the former, \"this splendid diamond might\nall be ours, if we chose!\"\n\n\"Do you believe it?\"\n\n\"Why, surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us!\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied La Carconte, \"do as you like. For my part, I wash my\nhands of the affair.\" So saying, she once more climbed the staircase\nleading to her chamber, her body convulsed with chills, and her teeth\nrattling in her head, in spite of the intense heat of the weather.\nArrived at the top stair, she turned round, and called out, in a warning\ntone, to her husband, \"Gaspard, consider well what you are about to do!\"\n\n\"I have both reflected and decided,\" answered he. La Carconte then\nentered her chamber, the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy,\nuncertain tread, as she proceeded towards her arm-chair, into which she\nfell as though exhausted.\n\n\"Well,\" asked the abbe, as he returned to the apartment below, \"what\nhave you made up your mind to do?\"\n\n\"To tell you all I know,\" was the reply.\n\n\"I certainly think you act wisely in so doing,\" said the priest. \"Not\nbecause I have the least desire to learn anything you may please to\nconceal from me, but simply that if, through your assistance, I could\ndistribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator, why, so\nmuch the better, that is all.\"\n\n\"I hope it may be so,\" replied Caderousse, his face flushed with\ncupidity.\n\n\"I am all attention,\" said the abbe.\n\n\"Stop a minute,\" answered Caderousse; \"we might be interrupted in the\nmost interesting part of my story, which would be a pity; and it is as\nwell that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves.\"\nWith these words he went stealthily to the door, which he closed, and,\nby way of still greater precaution, bolted and barred it, as he was\naccustomed to do at night. During this time the abbe had chosen his\nplace for listening at his ease. He removed his seat into a corner of\nthe room, where he himself would be in deep shadow, while the light\nwould be fully thrown on the narrator; then, with head bent down and\nhands clasped, or rather clinched together, he prepared to give his\nwhole attention to Caderousse, who seated himself on the little stool,\nexactly opposite to him.\n\n\"Remember, this is no affair of mine,\" said the trembling voice of La\nCarconte, as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the\nscene that was enacting below.\n\n\"Enough, enough!\" replied Caderousse; \"say no more about it; I will take\nall the consequences upon myself.\" And he began his story.\n\n\n\nChapter 27. The Story.\n\n\"First, sir,\" said Caderousse, \"you must make me a promise.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" inquired the abbe.\n\n\"Why, if you ever make use of the details I am about to give you, that\nyou will never let any one know that it was I who supplied them; for the\npersons of whom I am about to talk are rich and powerful, and if they\nonly laid the tips of their fingers on me, I should break to pieces like\nglass.\"\n\n\"Make yourself easy, my friend,\" replied the abbe. \"I am a priest, and\nconfessions die in my breast. Recollect, our only desire is to carry\nout, in a fitting manner, the last wishes of our friend. Speak, then,\nwithout reserve, as without hatred; tell the truth, the whole truth; I\ndo not know, never may know, the persons of whom you are about to speak;\nbesides, I am an Italian, and not a Frenchman, and belong to God, and\nnot to man, and I shall shortly retire to my convent, which I have\nonly quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man.\" This positive\nassurance seemed to give Caderousse a little courage.\n\n\"Well, then, under these circumstances,\" said Caderousse, \"I will, I\neven believe I ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor\nEdmond thought so sincere and unquestionable.\"\n\n\"Begin with his father, if you please.\" said the abbe; \"Edmond talked to\nme a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love.\"\n\n\"The history is a sad one, sir,\" said Caderousse, shaking his head;\n\"perhaps you know all the earlier part of it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" answered the abbe; \"Edmond related to me everything until the\nmoment when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to Marseilles.\"\n\n\"At La Reserve! Oh, yes; I can see it all before me this moment.\"\n\n\"Was it not his betrothal feast?\"\n\n\"It was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending;\na police commissary, followed by four soldiers, entered, and Dantes was\narrested.\"\n\n\"Yes, and up to this point I know all,\" said the priest. \"Dantes himself\nonly knew that which personally concerned him, for he never beheld again\nthe five persons I have named to you, or heard mention of any one of\nthem.\"\n\n\"Well, when Dantes was arrested, Monsieur Morrel hastened to obtain the\nparticulars, and they were very sad. The old man returned alone to his\nhome, folded up his wedding suit with tears in his eyes, and paced up\nand down his chamber the whole day, and would not go to bed at all,\nfor I was underneath him and heard him walking the whole night; and for\nmyself, I assure you I could not sleep either, for the grief of the poor\nfather gave me great uneasiness, and every step he took went to my heart\nas really as if his foot had pressed against my breast. The next day\nMercedes came to implore the protection of M. de Villefort; she did not\nobtain it, however, and went to visit the old man; when she saw him so\nmiserable and heart-broken, having passed a sleepless night, and not\ntouched food since the previous day, she wished him to go with her that\nshe might take care of him; but the old man would not consent. 'No,' was\nthe old man's reply, 'I will not leave this house, for my poor dear boy\nloves me better than anything in the world; and if he gets out of prison\nhe will come and see me the first thing, and what would he think if I\ndid not wait here for him?' I heard all this from the window, for I was\nanxious that Mercedes should persuade the old man to accompany her, for\nhis footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a moment's\nrepose.\"\n\n\"But did you not go up-stairs and try to console the poor old man?\"\nasked the abbe.\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" replied Caderousse, \"we cannot console those who will not\nbe consoled, and he was one of these; besides, I know not why, but he\nseemed to dislike seeing me. One night, however, I heard his sobs, and I\ncould not resist my desire to go up to him, but when I reached his door\nhe was no longer weeping but praying. I cannot now repeat to you, sir,\nall the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of; it was\nmore than piety, it was more than grief, and I, who am no canter, and\nhate the Jesuits, said then to myself, 'It is really well, and I am very\nglad that I have not any children; for if I were a father and felt such\nexcessive grief as the old man does, and did not find in my memory or\nheart all he is now saying, I should throw myself into the sea at once,\nfor I could not bear it.'\"\n\n\"Poor father!\" murmured the priest.\n\n\"From day to day he lived on alone, and more and more solitary. M.\nMorrel and Mercedes came to see him, but his door was closed; and,\nalthough I was certain he was at home, he would not make any answer.\nOne day, when, contrary to his custom, he had admitted Mercedes, and the\npoor girl, in spite of her own grief and despair, endeavored to console\nhim, he said to her,--'Be assured, my dear daughter, he is dead; and\ninstead of expecting him, it is he who is awaiting us; I am quite happy,\nfor I am the oldest, and of course shall see him first.' However well\ndisposed a person may be, why you see we leave off after a time seeing\npersons who are in sorrow, they make one melancholy; and so at last\nold Dantes was left all to himself, and I only saw from time to time\nstrangers go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried\nto hide; but I guessed what these bundles were, and that he sold by\ndegrees what he had to pay for his subsistence. At length the poor old\nfellow reached the end of all he had; he owed three quarters' rent, and\nthey threatened to turn him out; he begged for another week, which was\ngranted to him. I know this, because the landlord came into my apartment\nwhen he left his. For the first three days I heard him walking about as\nusual, but, on the fourth I heard nothing. I then resolved to go up to\nhim at all risks. The door was closed, but I looked through the keyhole,\nand saw him so pale and haggard, that believing him very ill, I went and\ntold M. Morrel and then ran on to Mercedes. They both came immediately,\nM. Morrel bringing a doctor, and the doctor said it was inflammation\nof the bowels, and ordered him a limited diet. I was there, too, and I\nnever shall forget the old man's smile at this prescription. From that\ntime he received all who came; he had an excuse for not eating any more;\nthe doctor had put him on a diet.\" The abbe uttered a kind of groan.\n\"The story interests you, does it not, sir?\" inquired Caderousse.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the abbe, \"it is very affecting.\"\n\n\"Mercedes came again, and she found him so altered that she was even\nmore anxious than before to have him taken to her own home. This was M.\nMorrel's wish also, who would fain have conveyed the old man against his\nconsent; but the old man resisted, and cried so that they were actually\nfrightened. Mercedes remained, therefore, by his bedside, and M. Morrel\nwent away, making a sign to the Catalan that he had left his purse on\nthe chimney-piece. But availing himself of the doctor's order, the old\nman would not take any sustenance; at length (after nine days of despair\nand fasting), the old man died, cursing those who had caused his misery,\nand saying to Mercedes, 'If you ever see my Edmond again, tell him I die\nblessing him.'\" The abbe rose from his chair, made two turns round the\nchamber, and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat. \"And\nyou believe he died\"--\n\n\"Of hunger, sir, of hunger,\" said Caderousse. \"I am as certain of it as\nthat we two are Christians.\"\n\nThe abbe, with a shaking hand, seized a glass of water that was standing\nby him half-full, swallowed it at one gulp, and then resumed his seat,\nwith red eyes and pale cheeks. \"This was, indeed, a horrid event.\" said\nhe in a hoarse voice.\n\n\"The more so, sir, as it was men's and not God's doing.\"\n\n\"Tell me of those men,\" said the abbe, \"and remember too,\" he added in\nan almost menacing tone, \"you have promised to tell me everything. Tell\nme, therefore, who are these men who killed the son with despair, and\nthe father with famine?\"\n\n\"Two men jealous of him, sir; one from love, and the other from\nambition,--Fernand and Danglars.\"\n\n\"How was this jealousy manifested? Speak on.\"\n\n\"They denounced Edmond as a Bonapartist agent.\"\n\n\"Which of the two denounced him? Which was the real delinquent?\"\n\n\"Both, sir; one with a letter, and the other put it in the post.\"\n\n\"And where was this letter written?\"\n\n\"At La Reserve, the day before the betrothal feast.\"\n\n\"'Twas so, then--'twas so, then,\" murmured the abbe. \"Oh, Faria, Faria,\nhow well did you judge men and things!\"\n\n\"What did you please to say, sir?\" asked Caderousse.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" replied the priest; \"go on.\"\n\n\"It was Danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand, that his\nwriting might not be recognized, and Fernand who put it in the post.\"\n\n\"But,\" exclaimed the abbe suddenly, \"you were there yourself.\"\n\n\"I!\" said Caderousse, astonished; \"who told you I was there?\"\n\nThe abbe saw he had overshot the mark, and he added quickly,--\"No one;\nbut in order to have known everything so well, you must have been an\neye-witness.\"\n\n\"True, true!\" said Caderousse in a choking voice, \"I was there.\"\n\n\"And did you not remonstrate against such infamy?\" asked the abbe; \"if\nnot, you were an accomplice.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Caderousse, \"they had made me drink to such an\nexcess that I nearly lost all perception. I had only an indistinct\nunderstanding of what was passing around me. I said all that a man in\nsuch a state could say; but they both assured me that it was a jest they\nwere carrying on, and perfectly harmless.\"\n\n\"Next day--next day, sir, you must have seen plain enough what they had\nbeen doing, yet you said nothing, though you were present when Dantes\nwas arrested.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I was there, and very anxious to speak; but Danglars\nrestrained me. 'If he should really be guilty,' said he, 'and did really\nput in to the Island of Elba; if he is really charged with a letter for\nthe Bonapartist committee at Paris, and if they find this letter upon\nhim, those who have supported him will pass for his accomplices.' I\nconfess I had my fears, in the state in which politics then were, and I\nheld my tongue. It was cowardly, I confess, but it was not criminal.\"\n\n\"I understand--you allowed matters to take their course, that was all.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered Caderousse; \"and remorse preys on me night and day.\nI often ask pardon of God, I swear to you, because this action, the only\none with which I have seriously to reproach myself in all my life, is\nno doubt the cause of my abject condition. I am expiating a moment of\nselfishness, and so I always say to La Carconte, when she complains,\n'Hold your tongue, woman; it is the will of God.'\" And Caderousse bowed\nhis head with every sign of real repentance.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said the abbe, \"you have spoken unreservedly; and thus to\naccuse yourself is to deserve pardon.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, Edmond is dead, and has not pardoned me.\"\n\n\"He did not know,\" said the abbe.\n\n\"But he knows it all now,\" interrupted Caderousse; \"they say the dead\nknow everything.\" There was a brief silence; the abbe rose and paced up\nand down pensively, and then resumed his seat. \"You have two or three\ntimes mentioned a M. Morrel,\" he said; \"who was he?\"\n\n\"The owner of the Pharaon and patron of Dantes.\"\n\n\"And what part did he play in this sad drama?\" inquired the abbe.\n\n\"The part of an honest man, full of courage and real regard. Twenty\ntimes he interceded for Edmond. When the emperor returned, he wrote,\nimplored, threatened, and so energetically, that on the second\nrestoration he was persecuted as a Bonapartist. Ten times, as I told\nyou, he came to see Dantes' father, and offered to receive him in his\nown house; and the night or two before his death, as I have already\nsaid, he left his purse on the mantelpiece, with which they paid the old\nman's debts, and buried him decently; and so Edmond's father died, as\nhe had lived, without doing harm to any one. I have the purse still by\nme--a large one, made of red silk.\"\n\n\"And,\" asked the abbe, \"is M. Morrel still alive?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Caderousse.\n\n\"In that case,\" replied the abbe, \"he should be rich, happy.\"\n\nCaderousse smiled bitterly. \"Yes, happy as myself,\" said he.\n\n\"What! M. Morrel unhappy?\" exclaimed the abbe.\n\n\"He is reduced almost to the last extremity--nay, he is almost at the\npoint of dishonor.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Caderousse, \"so it is; after five and twenty years\nof labor, after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of\nMarseilles, M. Morrel is utterly ruined; he has lost five ships in two\nyears, has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large houses, and his\nonly hope now is in that very Pharaon which poor Dantes commanded, and\nwhich is expected from the Indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo.\nIf this ship founders, like the others, he is a ruined man.\"\n\n\"And has the unfortunate man wife or children?\" inquired the abbe.\n\n\"Yes, he has a wife, who through everything has behaved like an angel;\nhe has a daughter, who was about to marry the man she loved, but whose\nfamily now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man; he\nhas, besides, a son, a lieutenant in the army; and, as you may suppose,\nall this, instead of lessening, only augments his sorrows. If he were\nalone in the world he would blow out his brains, and there would be an\nend.\"\n\n\"Horrible!\" ejaculated the priest.\n\n\"And it is thus heaven recompenses virtue, sir,\" added Caderousse. \"You\nsee, I, who never did a bad action but that I have told you of--am in\ndestitution, with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes, and\nI unable to do anything in the world for her; I shall die of hunger, as\nold Dantes did, while Fernand and Danglars are rolling in wealth.\"\n\n\"How is that?\"\n\n\"Because their deeds have brought them good fortune, while honest men\nhave been reduced to misery.\"\n\n\"What has become of Danglars, the instigator, and therefore the most\nguilty?\"\n\n\"What has become of him? Why, he left Marseilles, and was taken, on the\nrecommendation of M. Morrel, who did not know his crime, as cashier\ninto a Spanish bank. During the war with Spain he was employed in the\ncommissariat of the French army, and made a fortune; then with that\nmoney he speculated in the funds, and trebled or quadrupled his capital;\nand, having first married his banker's daughter, who left him a widower,\nhe has married a second time, a widow, a Madame de Nargonne, daughter of\nM. de Servieux, the king's chamberlain, who is in high favor at court.\nHe is a millionaire, and they have made him a baron, and now he is the\nBaron Danglars, with a fine residence in the Rue de Mont-Blanc, with ten\nhorses in his stables, six footmen in his ante-chamber, and I know not\nhow many millions in his strongbox.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the abbe, in a peculiar tone, \"he is happy.\"\n\n\"Happy? Who can answer for that? Happiness or unhappiness is the secret\nknown but to one's self and the walls--walls have ears but no tongue;\nbut if a large fortune produces happiness, Danglars is happy.\"\n\n\"And Fernand?\"\n\n\"Fernand? Why, much the same story.\"\n\n\"But how could a poor Catalan fisher-boy, without education or\nresources, make a fortune? I confess this staggers me.\"\n\n\"And it has staggered everybody. There must have been in his life some\nstrange secret that no one knows.\"\n\n\"But, then, by what visible steps has he attained this high fortune or\nhigh position?\"\n\n\"Both, sir--he has both fortune and position--both.\"\n\n\"This must be impossible!\"\n\n\"It would seem so; but listen, and you will understand. Some days before\nthe return of the emperor, Fernand was drafted. The Bourbons left him\nquietly enough at the Catalans, but Napoleon returned, a special levy\nwas made, and Fernand was compelled to join. I went too; but as I was\nolder than Fernand, and had just married my poor wife, I was only sent\nto the coast. Fernand was enrolled in the active troop, went to the\nfrontier with his regiment, and was at the battle of Ligny. The night\nafter that battle he was sentry at the door of a general who carried on\na secret correspondence with the enemy. That same night the general\nwas to go over to the English. He proposed to Fernand to accompany him;\nFernand agreed to do so, deserted his post, and followed the general.\nFernand would have been court-martialed if Napoleon had remained on\nthe throne, but his action was rewarded by the Bourbons. He returned to\nFrance with the epaulet of sub-lieutenant, and as the protection of\nthe general, who is in the highest favor, was accorded to him, he was\na captain in 1823, during the Spanish war--that is to say, at the time\nwhen Danglars made his early speculations. Fernand was a Spaniard, and\nbeing sent to Spain to ascertain the feeling of his fellow-countrymen,\nfound Danglars there, got on very intimate terms with him, won over the\nsupport of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces, received\npromises and made pledges on his own part, guided his regiment by paths\nknown to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held\nby the royalists, and, in fact, rendered such services in this brief\ncampaign that, after the taking of Trocadero, he was made colonel, and\nreceived the title of count and the cross of an officer of the Legion of\nHonor.\"\n\n\"Destiny! destiny!\" murmured the abbe.\n\n\"Yes, but listen: this was not all. The war with Spain being ended,\nFernand's career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to\nendure throughout Europe. Greece only had risen against Turkey, and had\nbegun her war of independence; all eyes were turned towards Athens--it\nwas the fashion to pity and support the Greeks. The French government,\nwithout protecting them openly, as you know, gave countenance to\nvolunteer assistance. Fernand sought and obtained leave to go and serve\nin Greece, still having his name kept on the army roll. Some time after,\nit was stated that the Comte de Morcerf (this was the name he bore) had\nentered the service of Ali Pasha with the rank of instructor-general.\nAli Pasha was killed, as you know, but before he died he recompensed\nthe services of Fernand by leaving him a considerable sum, with which he\nreturned to France, when he was gazetted lieutenant-general.\"\n\n\"So that now?\"--inquired the abbe.\n\n\"So that now,\" continued Caderousse, \"he owns a magnificent house--No.\n27, Rue du Helder, Paris.\" The abbe opened his mouth, hesitated for\na moment, then, making an effort at self-control, he said, \"And\nMercedes--they tell me that she has disappeared?\"\n\n\"Disappeared,\" said Caderousse, \"yes, as the sun disappears, to rise the\nnext day with still more splendor.\"\n\n\"Has she made a fortune also?\" inquired the abbe, with an ironical\nsmile.\n\n\"Mercedes is at this moment one of the greatest ladies in Paris,\"\nreplied Caderousse.\n\n\"Go on,\" said the abbe; \"it seems as if I were listening to the story of\na dream. But I have seen things so extraordinary, that what you tell me\nseems less astonishing than it otherwise might.\"\n\n\"Mercedes was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived\nher of Edmond. I have told you of her attempts to propitiate M. de\nVillefort, her devotion to the elder Dantes. In the midst of her\ndespair, a new affliction overtook her. This was the departure of\nFernand--of Fernand, whose crime she did not know, and whom she regarded\nas her brother. Fernand went, and Mercedes remained alone. Three months\npassed and still she wept--no news of Edmond, no news of Fernand, no\ncompanionship save that of an old man who was dying with despair. One\nevening, after a day of accustomed vigil at the angle of two roads\nleading to Marseilles from the Catalans, she returned to her home\nmore depressed than ever. Suddenly she heard a step she knew, turned\nanxiously around, the door opened, and Fernand, dressed in the uniform\nof a sub-lieutenant, stood before her. It was not the one she wished for\nmost, but it seemed as if a part of her past life had returned to her.\nMercedes seized Fernand's hands with a transport which he took for love,\nbut which was only joy at being no longer alone in the world, and seeing\nat last a friend, after long hours of solitary sorrow. And then, it must\nbe confessed, Fernand had never been hated--he was only not precisely\nloved. Another possessed all Mercedes' heart; that other was absent, had\ndisappeared, perhaps was dead. At this last thought Mercedes burst into\na flood of tears, and wrung her hands in agony; but the thought, which\nshe had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another,\ncame now in full force upon her mind; and then, too, old Dantes\nincessantly said to her, 'Our Edmond is dead; if he were not, he would\nreturn to us.' The old man died, as I have told you; had he lived,\nMercedes, perchance, had not become the wife of another, for he would\nhave been there to reproach her infidelity. Fernand saw this, and when\nhe learned of the old man's death he returned. He was now a lieutenant.\nAt his first coming he had not said a word of love to Mercedes; at the\nsecond he reminded her that he loved her. Mercedes begged for six months\nmore in which to await and mourn for Edmond.\"\n\n\"So that,\" said the abbe, with a bitter smile, \"that makes eighteen\nmonths in all. What more could the most devoted lover desire?\" Then he\nmurmured the words of the English poet, \"'Frailty, thy name is woman.'\"\n\n\"Six months afterwards,\" continued Caderousse, \"the marriage took place\nin the church of Accoules.\"\n\n\"The very church in which she was to have married Edmond,\" murmured the\npriest; \"there was only a change of bride-grooms.\"\n\n\"Well, Mercedes was married,\" proceeded Caderousse; \"but although in the\neyes of the world she appeared calm, she nearly fainted as she passed\nLa Reserve, where, eighteen months before, the betrothal had been\ncelebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved had she\nlooked to the bottom of her heart. Fernand, more happy, but not more at\nhis ease--for I saw at this time he was in constant dread of Edmond's\nreturn--Fernand was very anxious to get his wife away, and to depart\nhimself. There were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with\nthe Catalans, and eight days after the wedding they left Marseilles.\"\n\n\"Did you ever see Mercedes again?\" inquired the priest.\n\n\"Yes, during the Spanish war, at Perpignan, where Fernand had left her;\nshe was attending to the education of her son.\" The abbe started. \"Her\nson?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Caderousse, \"little Albert.\"\n\n\"But, then, to be able to instruct her child,\" continued the abbe, \"she\nmust have received an education herself. I understood from Edmond that\nshe was the daughter of a simple fisherman, beautiful but uneducated.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" replied Caderousse, \"did he know so little of his lovely\nbetrothed? Mercedes might have been a queen, sir, if the crown were to\nbe placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent. Fernand's\nfortune was already waxing great, and she developed with his growing\nfortune. She learned drawing, music--everything. Besides, I believe,\nbetween ourselves, she did this in order to distract her mind, that she\nmight forget; and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the\nweight on her heart. But now her position in life is assured,\" continued\nCaderousse; \"no doubt fortune and honors have comforted her; she is\nrich, a countess, and yet\"--Caderousse paused.\n\n\"And yet what?\" asked the abbe.\n\n\"Yet, I am sure, she is not happy,\" said Caderousse.\n\n\"What makes you believe this?\"\n\n\"Why, when I found myself utterly destitute, I thought my old friends\nwould, perhaps, assist me. So I went to Danglars, who would not even\nreceive me. I called on Fernand, who sent me a hundred francs by his\nvalet-de-chambre.\"\n\n\"Then you did not see either of them?\"\n\n\"No, but Madame de Morcerf saw me.\"\n\n\"How was that?\"\n\n\"As I went away a purse fell at my feet--it contained five and twenty\nlouis; I raised my head quickly, and saw Mercedes, who at once shut the\nblind.\"\n\n\"And M. de Villefort?\" asked the abbe.\n\n\"Oh, he never was a friend of mine, I did not know him, and I had\nnothing to ask of him.\"\n\n\"Do you not know what became of him, and the share he had in Edmond's\nmisfortunes?\"\n\n\"No; I only know that some time after Edmond's arrest, he married\nMademoiselle de Saint-Meran, and soon after left Marseilles; no doubt\nhe has been as lucky as the rest; no doubt he is as rich as Danglars,\nas high in station as Fernand. I only, as you see, have remained poor,\nwretched, and forgotten.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, my friend,\" replied the abbe; \"God may seem sometimes\nto forget for a time, while his justice reposes, but there always comes\na moment when he remembers--and behold--a proof!\" As he spoke, the\nabbe took the diamond from his pocket, and giving it to Caderousse,\nsaid,--\"Here, my friend, take this diamond, it is yours.\"\n\n\"What, for me only?\" cried Caderousse, \"ah, sir, do not jest with me!\"\n\n\"This diamond was to have been shared among his friends. Edmond had one\nfriend only, and thus it cannot be divided. Take the diamond, then, and\nsell it; it is worth fifty thousand francs, and I repeat my wish that\nthis sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir,\" said Caderousse, putting out one hand timidly, and with the\nother wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow,--\"Oh, sir, do\nnot make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man.\"\n\n\"I know what happiness and what despair are, and I never make a jest of\nsuch feelings. Take it, then, but in exchange--\"\n\nCaderousse, who touched the diamond, withdrew his hand. The abbe smiled.\n\"In exchange,\" he continued, \"give me the red silk purse that M. Morrel\nleft on old Dantes' chimney-piece, and which you tell me is still in\nyour hands.\" Caderousse, more and more astonished, went toward a large\noaken cupboard, opened it, and gave the abbe a long purse of faded red\nsilk, round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt. The\nabbe took it, and in return gave Caderousse the diamond.\n\n\"Oh, you are a man of God, sir,\" cried Caderousse; \"for no one knew that\nEdmond had given you this diamond, and you might have kept it.\"\n\n\"Which,\" said the abbe to himself, \"you would have done.\" The abbe\nrose, took his hat and gloves. \"Well,\" he said, \"all you have told me is\nperfectly true, then, and I may believe it in every particular.\"\n\n\"See, sir,\" replied Caderousse, \"in this corner is a crucifix in holy\nwood--here on this shelf is my wife's testament; open this book, and I\nwill swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix. I will swear to you by\nmy soul's salvation, my faith as a Christian, I have told everything to\nyou as it occurred, and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear\nof God at the day of the last judgment!\"\n\n\"'Tis well,\" said the abbe, convinced by his manner and tone that\nCaderousse spoke the truth. \"'Tis well, and may this money profit you!\nAdieu; I go far from men who thus so bitterly injure each other.\"\nThe abbe with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of\nCaderousse, opened the door himself, got out and mounted his horse, once\nmore saluted the innkeeper, who kept uttering his loud farewells, and\nthen returned by the road he had travelled in coming. When Caderousse\nturned around, he saw behind him La Carconte, paler and trembling more\nthan ever. \"Is, then, all that I have heard really true?\" she inquired.\n\n\"What? That he has given the diamond to us only?\" inquired Caderousse,\nhalf bewildered with joy; \"yes, nothing more true! See, here it is.\" The\nwoman gazed at it a moment, and then said, in a gloomy voice, \"Suppose\nit's false?\" Caderousse started and turned pale. \"False!\" he muttered.\n\"False! Why should that man give me a false diamond?\"\n\n\"To get your secret without paying for it, you blockhead!\"\n\nCaderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an\nidea. \"Oh!\" he said, taking up his hat, which he placed on the red\nhandkerchief tied round his head, \"we will soon find out.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"Why, the fair is on at Beaucaire, there are always jewellers from Paris\nthere, and I will show it to them. Look after the house, wife, and I\nshall be back in two hours,\" and Caderousse left the house in haste,\nand ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had\ntaken. \"Fifty thousand francs!\" muttered La Carconte when left alone;\n\"it is a large sum of money, but it is not a fortune.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 28. The Prison Register.\n\nThe day after that in which the scene we have just described had taken\nplace on the road between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, a man of about\nthirty or two and thirty, dressed in a bright blue frock coat, nankeen\ntrousers, and a white waistcoat, having the appearance and accent of\nan Englishman, presented himself before the mayor of Marseilles. \"Sir,\"\nsaid he, \"I am chief clerk of the house of Thomson & French, of Rome. We\nare, and have been these ten years, connected with the house of Morrel\n& Son, of Marseilles. We have a hundred thousand francs or thereabouts\nloaned on their securities, and we are a little uneasy at reports that\nhave reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin. I have come,\ntherefore, express from Rome, to ask you for information.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied the mayor. \"I know very well that during the last four or\nfive years misfortune has seemed to pursue M. Morrel. He has lost four\nor five vessels, and suffered by three or four bankruptcies; but it\nis not for me, although I am a creditor myself to the amount of\nten thousand francs, to give any information as to the state of his\nfinances. Ask of me, as mayor, what is my opinion of M. Morrel, and I\nshall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree, and who has\nup to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality.\nThis is all I can say, sir; if you wish to learn more, address yourself\nto M. de Boville, the inspector of prisons, No. 15, Rue de Nouailles;\nhe has, I believe, two hundred thousand francs in Morrel's hands, and if\nthere be any grounds for apprehension, as this is a greater amount than\nmine, you will most probably find him better informed than myself.\"\n\nThe Englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy, made his bow\nand went away, proceeding with a characteristic British stride towards\nthe street mentioned. M. de Boville was in his private room, and the\nEnglishman, on perceiving him, made a gesture of surprise, which seemed\nto indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence.\nAs to M. de Boville, he was in such a state of despair, that it was\nevident all the faculties of his mind, absorbed in the thought which\noccupied him at the moment, did not allow either his memory or his\nimagination to stray to the past. The Englishman, with the coolness of\nhis nation, addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which\nhe had accosted the mayor of Marseilles. \"Oh, sir,\" exclaimed M. de\nBoville, \"your fears are unfortunately but too well founded, and you see\nbefore you a man in despair. I had two hundred thousand francs placed\nin the hands of Morrel & Son; these two hundred thousand francs were the\ndowry of my daughter, who was to be married in a fortnight, and these\ntwo hundred thousand francs were payable, half on the 15th of this\nmonth, and the other half on the 15th of next month. I had informed M.\nMorrel of my desire to have these payments punctually, and he has been\nhere within the last half-hour to tell me that if his ship, the Pharaon,\ndid not come into port on the 15th, he would be wholly unable to make\nthis payment.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the Englishman, \"this looks very much like a suspension of\npayment.\"\n\n\"It looks more like bankruptcy!\" exclaimed M. de Boville despairingly.\n\nThe Englishman appeared to reflect a moment, and then said,--\"From which\nit would appear, sir, that this credit inspires you with considerable\napprehension?\"\n\n\"To tell you the truth, I consider it lost.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I will buy it of you!\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Yes, I!\"\n\n\"But at a tremendous discount, of course?\"\n\n\"No, for two hundred thousand francs. Our house,\" added the Englishman\nwith a laugh, \"does not do things in that way.\"\n\n\"And you will pay\"--\n\n\"Ready money.\" And the Englishman drew from his pocket a bundle of\nbank-notes, which might have been twice the sum M. de Boville feared\nto lose. A ray of joy passed across M. de Boville's countenance, yet\nhe made an effort at self-control, and said,--\"Sir, I ought to tell\nyou that, in all probability, you will not realize six per cent of this\nsum.\"\n\n\"That's no affair of mine,\" replied the Englishman, \"that is the affair\nof the house of Thomson & French, in whose name I act. They have,\nperhaps, some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm.\nBut all I know, sir, is, that I am ready to hand you over this sum in\nexchange for your assignment of the debt. I only ask a brokerage.\"\n\n\"Of course, that is perfectly just,\" cried M. de Boville. \"The\ncommission is usually one and a half; will you have two--three--five per\ncent, or even more? Whatever you say.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied the Englishman, laughing, \"I am like my house, and do not\ndo such things--no, the commission I ask is quite different.\"\n\n\"Name it, sir, I beg.\"\n\n\"You are the inspector of prisons?\"\n\n\"I have been so these fourteen years.\"\n\n\"You keep the registers of entries and departures?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"To these registers there are added notes relative to the prisoners?\"\n\n\"There are special reports on every prisoner.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I was educated at home by a poor devil of an abbe, who\ndisappeared suddenly. I have since learned that he was confined in the\nChateau d'If, and I should like to learn some particulars of his death.\"\n\n\"What was his name?\"\n\n\"The Abbe Faria.\"\n\n\"Oh, I recollect him perfectly,\" cried M. de Boville; \"he was crazy.\"\n\n\"So they said.\"\n\n\"Oh, he was, decidedly.\"\n\n\"Very possibly; but what sort of madness was it?\"\n\n\"He pretended to know of an immense treasure, and offered vast sums to\nthe government if they would liberate him.\"\n\n\"Poor devil!--and he is dead?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, five or six months ago--last February.\"\n\n\"You have a good memory, sir, to recollect dates so well.\"\n\n\"I recollect this, because the poor devil's death was accompanied by a\nsingular incident.\"\n\n\"May I ask what that was?\" said the Englishman with an expression\nof curiosity, which a close observer would have been astonished at\ndiscovering in his phlegmatic countenance.\n\n\"Oh dear, yes, sir; the abbe's dungeon was forty or fifty feet distant\nfrom that of one of Bonaparte's emissaries,--one of those who had\ncontributed the most to the return of the usurper in 1815,--a very\nresolute and very dangerous man.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said the Englishman.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied M. de Boville; \"I myself had occasion to see this man\nin 1816 or 1817, and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of\nsoldiers. That man made a deep impression on me; I shall never forget\nhis countenance!\" The Englishman smiled imperceptibly.\n\n\"And you say, sir,\" he interposed, \"that the two dungeons\"--\n\n\"Were separated by a distance of fifty feet; but it appears that this\nEdmond Dantes\"--\n\n\"This dangerous man's name was\"--\n\n\"Edmond Dantes. It appears, sir, that this Edmond Dantes had procured\ntools, or made them, for they found a tunnel through which the prisoners\nheld communication with one another.\"\n\n\"This tunnel was dug, no doubt, with an intention of escape?\"\n\n\"No doubt; but unfortunately for the prisoners, the Abbe Faria had an\nattack of catalepsy, and died.\"\n\n\"That must have cut short the projects of escape.\"\n\n\"For the dead man, yes,\" replied M. de Boville, \"but not for the\nsurvivor; on the contrary, this Dantes saw a means of accelerating his\nescape. He, no doubt, thought that prisoners who died in the Chateau\nd'If were interred in an ordinary burial-ground, and he conveyed the\ndead man into his own cell, took his place in the sack in which they had\nsewed up the corpse, and awaited the moment of interment.\"\n\n\"It was a bold step, and one that showed some courage,\" remarked the\nEnglishman.\n\n\"As I have already told you, sir, he was a very dangerous man; and,\nfortunately, by his own act disembarrassed the government of the fears\nit had on his account.\"\n\n\"How was that?\"\n\n\"How? Do you not comprehend?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"The Chateau d'If has no cemetery, and they simply throw the dead into\nthe sea, after fastening a thirty-six pound cannon-ball to their feet.\"\n\n\"Well,\" observed the Englishman as if he were slow of comprehension.\n\n\"Well, they fastened a thirty-six pound ball to his feet, and threw him\ninto the sea.\"\n\n\"Really!\" exclaimed the Englishman.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" continued the inspector of prisons. \"You may imagine the\namazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the\nrocks! I should like to have seen his face at that moment.\"\n\n\"That would have been difficult.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" replied De Boville, in supreme good-humor at the certainty\nof recovering his two hundred thousand francs,--\"no matter, I can fancy\nit.\" And he shouted with laughter.\n\n\"So can I,\" said the Englishman, and he laughed too; but he laughed as\nthe English do, \"at the end of his teeth.\"\n\n\"And so,\" continued the Englishman who first gained his composure, \"he\nwas drowned?\"\n\n\"Unquestionably.\"\n\n\"So that the governor got rid of the dangerous and the crazy prisoner at\nthe same time?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"But some official document was drawn up as to this affair, I suppose?\"\ninquired the Englishman.\n\n\"Yes, yes, the mortuary deposition. You understand, Dantes' relations,\nif he had any, might have some interest in knowing if he were dead or\nalive.\"\n\n\"So that now, if there were anything to inherit from him, they may do so\nwith easy conscience. He is dead, and no mistake about it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; and they may have the fact attested whenever they please.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said the Englishman. \"But to return to these registers.\"\n\n\"True, this story has diverted our attention from them. Excuse me.\"\n\n\"Excuse you for what? For the story? By no means; it really seems to me\nvery curious.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. So, sir, you wish to see all relating to the poor abbe,\nwho really was gentleness itself.\"\n\n\"Yes, you will much oblige me.\"\n\n\"Go into my study here, and I will show it to you.\" And they both\nentered M. de Boville's study. Everything was here arranged in perfect\norder; each register had its number, each file of papers its place. The\ninspector begged the Englishman to seat himself in an arm-chair, and\nplaced before him the register and documents relative to the Chateau\nd'If, giving him all the time he desired for the examination, while De\nBoville seated himself in a corner, and began to read his newspaper. The\nEnglishman easily found the entries relative to the Abbe Faria; but it\nseemed that the history which the inspector had related interested him\ngreatly, for after having perused the first documents he turned over the\nleaves until he reached the deposition respecting Edmond Dantes. There\nhe found everything arranged in due order,--the accusation, examination,\nMorrel's petition, M. de Villefort's marginal notes. He folded up\nthe accusation quietly, and put it as quietly in his pocket; read the\nexamination, and saw that the name of Noirtier was not mentioned in it;\nperused, too, the application dated 10th April, 1815, in which Morrel,\nby the deputy procureur's advice, exaggerated with the best intentions\n(for Napoleon was then on the throne) the services Dantes had rendered\nto the imperial cause--services which Villefort's certificates rendered\nindispensable. Then he saw through the whole thing. This petition\nto Napoleon, kept back by Villefort, had become, under the second\nrestoration, a terrible weapon against him in the hands of the king's\nattorney. He was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the\nregister this note, placed in a bracket against his name:--\n\nEdmond Dantes.\n\nAn inveterate Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from the\nIsland of Elba.\n\nTo be kept in strict solitary confinement, and to be closely watched and\nguarded.\n\nBeneath these lines was written in another hand: \"See note\nabove--nothing can be done.\" He compared the writing in the bracket with\nthe writing of the certificate placed beneath Morrel's petition, and\ndiscovered that the note in the bracket was the same writing as the\ncertificate--that is to say, was in Villefort's handwriting. As to the\nnote which accompanied this, the Englishman understood that it might\nhave been added by some inspector who had taken a momentary interest in\nDantes' situation, but who had, from the remarks we have quoted, found\nit impossible to give any effect to the interest he had felt.\n\nAs we have said, the inspector, from discretion, and that he might not\ndisturb the Abbe Faria's pupil in his researches, had seated himself\nin a corner, and was reading Le Drapeau Blanc. He did not see the\nEnglishman fold up and place in his pocket the accusation written by\nDanglars under the arbor of La Reserve, and which had the postmark,\n\"Marseilles, 27th Feb., delivery 6 o'clock, P.M.\" But it must be said\nthat if he had seen it, he attached so little importance to this scrap\nof paper, and so much importance to his two hundred thousand francs,\nthat he would not have opposed whatever the Englishman might do, however\nirregular it might be.\n\n\"Thanks,\" said the latter, closing the register with a slam, \"I have\nall I want; now it is for me to perform my promise. Give me a simple\nassignment of your debt; acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash,\nand I will hand you over the money.\" He rose, gave his seat to M. de\nBoville, who took it without ceremony, and quickly drew up the required\nassignment, while the Englishman counted out the bank-notes on the other\nside of the desk.\n\n\n\nChapter 29. The House of Morrel & Son.\n\nAny one who had quitted Marseilles a few years previously, well\nacquainted with the interior of Morrel's warehouse, and had returned at\nthis date, would have found a great change. Instead of that air of life,\nof comfort, and of happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous\nbusiness establishment--instead of merry faces at the windows, busy\nclerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridors--instead of the court\nfilled with bales of goods, re-echoing with the cries and the jokes of\nporters, one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and\ngloom. Out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted\ncorridor and the empty office, but two remained. One was a young man of\nthree or four and twenty, who was in love with M. Morrel's daughter, and\nhad remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce\nhim to withdraw; the other was an old one-eyed cashier, called \"Cocles,\"\nor \"Cock-eye,\" a nickname given him by the young men who used to throng\nthis vast now almost deserted bee-hive, and which had so completely\nreplaced his real name that he would not, in all probability, have\nreplied to any one who addressed him by it.\n\nCocles remained in M. Morrel's service, and a most singular change had\ntaken place in his position; he had at the same time risen to the rank\nof cashier, and sunk to the rank of a servant. He was, however, the\nsame Cocles, good, patient, devoted, but inflexible on the subject of\narithmetic, the only point on which he would have stood firm against the\nworld, even against M. Morrel; and strong in the multiplication-table,\nwhich he had at his fingers' ends, no matter what scheme or what trap\nwas laid to catch him. In the midst of the disasters that befell the\nhouse, Cocles was the only one unmoved. But this did not arise from a\nwant of affection; on the contrary, from a firm conviction. Like the\nrats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even before the vessel\nweighs anchor, so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the\noffice and the warehouse. Cocles had seen them go without thinking of\ninquiring the cause of their departure. Everything was as we have said,\na question of arithmetic to Cocles, and during twenty years he had\nalways seen all payments made with such exactitude, that it seemed as\nimpossible to him that the house should stop payment, as it would to a\nmiller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to\nflow.\n\nNothing had as yet occurred to shake Cocles' belief; the last month's\npayment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude; Cocles had\ndetected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash, and the same\nevening he had brought them to M. Morrel, who, with a melancholy smile,\nthrew them into an almost empty drawer, saying:--\n\n\"Thanks, Cocles; you are the pearl of cashiers.\"\n\nCocles went away perfectly happy, for this eulogium of M. Morrel,\nhimself the pearl of the honest men of Marseilles, flattered him more\nthan a present of fifty crowns. But since the end of the month M. Morrel\nhad passed many an anxious hour. In order to meet the payments then due;\nhe had collected all his resources, and, fearing lest the report of his\ndistress should get bruited abroad at Marseilles when he was known to be\nreduced to such an extremity, he went to the Beaucaire fair to sell his\nwife's and daughter's jewels and a portion of his plate. By this means\nthe end of the month was passed, but his resources were now exhausted.\nCredit, owing to the reports afloat, was no longer to be had; and to\nmeet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 10th of the present\nmonth, and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next\nmonth to M. de Boville, M. Morrel had, in reality, no hope but the\nreturn of the Pharaon, of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel\nwhich had weighed anchor at the same time, and which had already arrived\nin harbor. But this vessel which, like the Pharaon, came from Calcutta,\nhad been in for a fortnight, while no intelligence had been received of\nthe Pharaon.\n\nSuch was the state of affairs when, the day after his interview with M.\nde Boville, the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French\nof Rome, presented himself at M. Morrel's. Emmanuel received him; this\nyoung man was alarmed by the appearance of every new face, for every new\nface might be that of a new creditor, come in anxiety to question the\nhead of the house. The young man, wishing to spare his employer the pain\nof this interview, questioned the new-comer; but the stranger declared\nthat he had nothing to say to M. Emmanuel, and that his business was\nwith M. Morrel in person. Emmanuel sighed, and summoned Cocles. Cocles\nappeared, and the young man bade him conduct the stranger to M. Morrel's\napartment. Cocles went first, and the stranger followed him. On the\nstaircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen or seventeen, who looked\nwith anxiety at the stranger.\n\n\"M. Morrel is in his room, is he not, Mademoiselle Julie?\" said the\ncashier.\n\n\"Yes; I think so, at least,\" said the young girl hesitatingly. \"Go and\nsee, Cocles, and if my father is there, announce this gentleman.\"\n\n\"It will be useless to announce me, mademoiselle,\" returned the\nEnglishman. \"M. Morrel does not know my name; this worthy gentleman has\nonly to announce the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French\nof Rome, with whom your father does business.\"\n\nThe young girl turned pale and continued to descend, while the stranger\nand Cocles continued to mount the staircase. She entered the office\nwhere Emmanuel was, while Cocles, by the aid of a key he possessed,\nopened a door in the corner of a landing-place on the second staircase,\nconducted the stranger into an ante-chamber, opened a second door, which\nhe closed behind him, and after having left the clerk of the house of\nThomson & French alone, returned and signed to him that he could enter.\nThe Englishman entered, and found Morrel seated at a table, turning over\nthe formidable columns of his ledger, which contained the list of his\nliabilities. At the sight of the stranger, M. Morrel closed the ledger,\narose, and offered a seat to the stranger; and when he had seen him\nseated, resumed his own chair. Fourteen years had changed the worthy\nmerchant, who, in his thirty-sixth year at the opening of this history,\nwas now in his fiftieth; his hair had turned white, time and sorrow\nhad ploughed deep furrows on his brow, and his look, once so firm and\npenetrating, was now irresolute and wandering, as if he feared being\nforced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person. The\nEnglishman looked at him with an air of curiosity, evidently mingled\nwith interest. \"Monsieur,\" said Morrel, whose uneasiness was increased\nby this examination, \"you wish to speak to me?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur; you are aware from whom I come?\"\n\n\"The house of Thomson & French; at least, so my cashier tells me.\"\n\n\"He has told you rightly. The house of Thomson & French had 300,000 or\n400,000 francs to pay this month in France; and, knowing your strict\npunctuality, have collected all the bills bearing your signature, and\ncharged me as they became due to present them, and to employ the money\notherwise.\" Morrel sighed deeply, and passed his hand over his forehead,\nwhich was covered with perspiration.\n\n\"So then, sir,\" said Morrel, \"you hold bills of mine?\"\n\n\"Yes, and for a considerable sum.\"\n\n\"What is the amount?\" asked Morrel with a voice he strove to render\nfirm.\n\n\"Here is,\" said the Englishman, taking a quantity of papers from his\npocket, \"an assignment of 200,000 francs to our house by M. de Boville,\nthe inspector of prisons, to whom they are due. You acknowledge, of\ncourse, that you owe this sum to him?\"\n\n\"Yes; he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent nearly\nfive years ago.\"\n\n\"When are you to pay?\"\n\n\"Half the 15th of this month, half the 15th of next.\"\n\n\"Just so; and now here are 32,500 francs payable shortly; they are all\nsigned by you, and assigned to our house by the holders.\"\n\n\"I recognize them,\" said Morrel, whose face was suffused, as he thought\nthat, for the first time in his life, he would be unable to honor his\nown signature. \"Is this all?\"\n\n\"No, I have for the end of the month these bills which have been\nassigned to us by the house of Pascal, and the house of Wild & Turner of\nMarseilles, amounting to nearly 55,000. francs; in all, 287,500\nfrancs.\" It is impossible to describe what Morrel suffered during\nthis enumeration. \"Two hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred\nfrancs,\" repeated he.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the Englishman. \"I will not,\" continued he, after\na moment's silence, \"conceal from you, that while your probity and\nexactitude up to this moment are universally acknowledged, yet the\nreport is current in Marseilles that you are not able to meet your\nliabilities.\" At this almost brutal speech Morrel turned deathly\npale. \"Sir,\" said he, \"up to this time--and it is now more than\nfour-and-twenty years since I received the direction of this house from\nmy father, who had himself conducted it for five and thirty years--never\nhas anything bearing the signature of Morrel & Son been dishonored.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" replied the Englishman. \"But as a man of honor should\nanswer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the same\npunctuality?\" Morrel shuddered, and looked at the man, who spoke with\nmore assurance than he had hitherto shown. \"To questions frankly put,\"\nsaid he, \"a straightforward answer should be given. Yes, I shall pay,\nif, as I hope, my vessel arrives safely; for its arrival will again\nprocure me the credit which the numerous accidents, of which I have been\nthe victim, have deprived me; but if the Pharaon should be lost, and\nthis last resource be gone\"--the poor man's eyes filled with tears.\n\n\"Well,\" said the other, \"if this last resource fail you?\"\n\n\"Well,\" returned Morrel, \"it is a cruel thing to be forced to say, but,\nalready used to misfortune, I must habituate myself to shame. I fear I\nshall be forced to suspend payment.\"\n\n\"Have you no friends who could assist you?\" Morrel smiled mournfully.\n\"In business, sir,\" said he, \"one has no friends, only correspondents.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" murmured the Englishman; \"then you have but one hope.\"\n\n\"But one.\"\n\n\"The last?\"\n\n\"The last.\"\n\n\"So that if this fail\"--\n\n\"I am ruined,--completely ruined!\"\n\n\"As I was on my way here, a vessel was coming into port.\"\n\n\"I know it, sir; a young man, who still adheres to my fallen fortunes,\npasses a part of his time in a belvidere at the top of the house, in\nhopes of being the first to announce good news to me; he has informed me\nof the arrival of this ship.\"\n\n\"And it is not yours?\"\n\n\"No, she is a Bordeaux vessel, La Gironde; she comes from India also;\nbut she is not mine.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she has spoken to the Pharaon, and brings you some tidings of\nher?\"\n\n\"Shall I tell you plainly one thing, sir? I dread almost as much to\nreceive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt. Uncertainty\nis still hope.\" Then in a low voice Morrel added,--\"This delay is not\nnatural. The Pharaon left Calcutta the 5th February; she ought to have\nbeen here a month ago.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" said the Englishman. \"What is the meaning of that\nnoise?\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" cried Morrel, turning pale, \"what is it?\" A loud noise was\nheard on the stairs of people moving hastily, and half-stifled sobs.\nMorrel rose and advanced to the door; but his strength failed him and\nhe sank into a chair. The two men remained opposite one another, Morrel\ntrembling in every limb, the stranger gazing at him with an air of\nprofound pity. The noise had ceased; but it seemed that Morrel expected\nsomething--something had occasioned the noise, and something must\nfollow. The stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs; and that\nthe footsteps, which were those of several persons, stopped at the door.\nA key was inserted in the lock of the first door, and the creaking of\nhinges was audible.\n\n\"There are only two persons who have the key to that door,\" murmured\nMorrel, \"Cocles and Julie.\" At this instant the second door opened,\nand the young girl, her eyes bathed with tears, appeared. Morrel rose\ntremblingly, supporting himself by the arm of the chair. He would have\nspoken, but his voice failed him. \"Oh, father!\" said she, clasping her\nhands, \"forgive your child for being the bearer of evil tidings.\"\n\nMorrel again changed color. Julie threw herself into his arms.\n\n\"Oh, father, father!\" murmured she, \"courage!\"\n\n\"The Pharaon has gone down, then?\" said Morrel in a hoarse voice. The\nyoung girl did not speak; but she made an affirmative sign with her head\nas she lay on her father's breast.\n\n\"And the crew?\" asked Morrel.\n\n\"Saved,\" said the girl; \"saved by the crew of the vessel that has just\nentered the harbor.\" Morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an\nexpression of resignation and sublime gratitude. \"Thanks, my God,\" said\nhe, \"at least thou strikest but me alone.\" A tear moistened the eye of\nthe phlegmatic Englishman.\n\n\"Come in, come in,\" said Morrel, \"for I presume you are all at the\ndoor.\"\n\nScarcely had he uttered those words than Madame Morrel entered weeping\nbitterly. Emmanuel followed her, and in the antechamber were visible the\nrough faces of seven or eight half-naked sailors. At the sight of these\nmen the Englishman started and advanced a step; then restrained himself,\nand retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment.\nMadame Morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers,\nJulie still lay with her head on his shoulder, Emmanuel stood in the\ncentre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between Morrel's\nfamily and the sailors at the door.\n\n\"How did this happen?\" said Morrel.\n\n\"Draw nearer, Penelon,\" said the young man, \"and tell us all about it.\"\n\nAn old seaman, bronzed by the tropical sun, advanced, twirling the\nremains of a tarpaulin between his hands. \"Good-day, M. Morrel,\" said\nhe, as if he had just quitted Marseilles the previous evening, and had\njust returned from Aix or Toulon.\n\n\"Good-day, Penelon,\" returned Morrel, who could not refrain from smiling\nthrough his tears, \"where is the captain?\"\n\n\"The captain, M. Morrel,--he has stayed behind sick at Palma; but please\nGod, it won't be much, and you will see him in a few days all alive and\nhearty.\"\n\n\"Well, now tell your story, Penelon.\"\n\nPenelon rolled his quid in his cheek, placed his hand before his\nmouth, turned his head, and sent a long jet of tobacco-juice into the\nantechamber, advanced his foot, balanced himself, and began,--\"You see,\nM. Morrel,\" said he, \"we were somewhere between Cape Blanc and Cape\nBoyador, sailing with a fair breeze, south-south-west after a week's\ncalm, when Captain Gaumard comes up to me--I was at the helm I should\ntell you--and says, 'Penelon, what do you think of those clouds coming\nup over there?' I was just then looking at them myself. 'What do I\nthink, captain? Why I think that they are rising faster than they have\nany business to do, and that they would not be so black if they didn't\nmean mischief.'--'That's my opinion too,' said the captain, 'and I'll\ntake precautions accordingly. We are carrying too much canvas. Avast,\nthere, all hands! Take in the studding-sl's and stow the flying jib.' It\nwas time; the squall was on us, and the vessel began to heel. 'Ah,' said\nthe captain, 'we have still too much canvas set; all hands lower\nthe mains'l!' Five minutes after, it was down; and we sailed under\nmizzen-tops'ls and to'gall'nt sails. 'Well, Penelon,' said the captain,\n'what makes you shake your head?' 'Why,' I says, 'I still think you've\ngot too much on.' 'I think you're right,' answered he, 'we shall have a\ngale.' 'A gale? More than that, we shall have a tempest, or I don't know\nwhat's what.' You could see the wind coming like the dust at Montredon;\nluckily the captain understood his business. 'Take in two reefs in the\ntops'ls,' cried the captain; 'let go the bowlin's, haul the brace, lower\nthe to'gall'nt sails, haul out the reef-tackles on the yards.'\"\n\n\"That was not enough for those latitudes,\" said the Englishman; \"I\nshould have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker.\"\n\nHis firm, sonorous, and unexpected voice made every one start. Penelon\nput his hand over his eyes, and then stared at the man who thus\ncriticized the manoeuvres of his captain. \"We did better than that,\nsir,\" said the old sailor respectfully; \"we put the helm up to run\nbefore the tempest; ten minutes after we struck our tops'ls and scudded\nunder bare poles.\"\n\n\"The vessel was very old to risk that,\" said the Englishman.\n\n\"Eh, it was that that did the business; after pitching heavily for\ntwelve hours we sprung a leak. 'Penelon,' said the captain, 'I think we\nare sinking, give me the helm, and go down into the hold.' I gave him\nthe helm, and descended; there was already three feet of water. 'All\nhands to the pumps!' I shouted; but it was too late, and it seemed the\nmore we pumped the more came in. 'Ah,' said I, after four hours' work,\n'since we are sinking, let us sink; we can die but once.' 'That's\nthe example you set, Penelon,' cries the captain; 'very well, wait a\nminute.' He went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols.\n'I will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump,' said\nhe.\"\n\n\"Well done!\" said the Englishman.\n\n\"There's nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons,\" continued\nthe sailor; \"and during that time the wind had abated, and the sea gone\ndown, but the water kept rising; not much, only two inches an hour,\nbut still it rose. Two inches an hour does not seem much, but in twelve\nhours that makes two feet, and three we had before, that makes five.\n'Come,' said the captain, 'we have done all in our power, and M. Morrel\nwill have nothing to reproach us with, we have tried to save the ship,\nlet us now save ourselves. To the boats, my lads, as quick as you can.'\nNow,\" continued Penelon, \"you see, M. Morrel, a sailor is attached to\nhis ship, but still more to his life, so we did not wait to be told\ntwice; the more so, that the ship was sinking under us, and seemed to\nsay, 'Get along--save yourselves.' We soon launched the boat, and all\neight of us got into it. The captain descended last, or rather, he\ndid not descend, he would not quit the vessel; so I took him round the\nwaist, and threw him into the boat, and then I jumped after him. It\nwas time, for just as I jumped the deck burst with a noise like the\nbroadside of a man-of-war. Ten minutes after she pitched forward, then\nthe other way, spun round and round, and then good-by to the Pharaon. As\nfor us, we were three days without anything to eat or drink, so that we\nbegan to think of drawing lots who should feed the rest, when we saw La\nGironde; we made signals of distress, she perceived us, made for us, and\ntook us all on board. There now, M. Morrel, that's the whole truth, on\nthe honor of a sailor; is not it true, you fellows there?\" A general\nmurmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed\ntheir misfortunes and sufferings.\n\n\"Well, well,\" said M. Morrel, \"I know there was no one in fault but\ndestiny. It was the will of God that this should happen, blessed be his\nname. What wages are due to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, don't let us talk of that, M. Morrel.\"\n\n\"Yes, but we will talk of it.\"\n\n\"Well, then, three months,\" said Penelon.\n\n\"Cocles, pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows,\" said\nMorrel. \"At another time,\" added he, \"I should have said, Give them,\nbesides, two hundred francs over as a present; but times are changed,\nand the little money that remains to me is not my own.\"\n\nPenelon turned to his companions, and exchanged a few words with them.\n\n\"As for that, M. Morrel,\" said he, again turning his quid, \"as for\nthat\"--\n\n\"As for what?\"\n\n\"The money.\"\n\n\"Well\"--\n\n\"Well, we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at present,\nand that we will wait for the rest.\"\n\n\"Thanks, my friends, thanks!\" cried Morrel gratefully; \"take it--take\nit; and if you can find another employer, enter his service; you are\nfree to do so.\" These last words produced a prodigious effect on the\nseaman. Penelon nearly swallowed his quid; fortunately he recovered.\n\"What, M. Morrel!\" said he in a low voice, \"you send us away; you are\nthen angry with us!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said M. Morrel, \"I am not angry, quite the contrary, and I do\nnot send you away; but I have no more ships, and therefore I do not want\nany sailors.\"\n\n\"No more ships!\" returned Penelon; \"well, then, you'll build some; we'll\nwait for you.\"\n\n\"I have no money to build ships with, Penelon,\" said the poor owner\nmournfully, \"so I cannot accept your kind offer.\"\n\n\"No more money? Then you must not pay us; we can scud, like the Pharaon,\nunder bare poles.\"\n\n\"Enough, enough!\" cried Morrel, almost overpowered; \"leave me, I pray\nyou; we shall meet again in a happier time. Emmanuel, go with them, and\nsee that my orders are executed.\"\n\n\"At least, we shall see each other again, M. Morrel?\" asked Penelon.\n\n\"Yes; I hope so, at least. Now go.\" He made a sign to Cocles, who went\nfirst; the seamen followed him and Emmanuel brought up the rear. \"Now,\"\nsaid the owner to his wife and daughter, \"leave me; I wish to speak with\nthis gentleman.\" And he glanced towards the clerk of Thomson & French,\nwho had remained motionless in the corner during this scene, in which he\nhad taken no part, except the few words we have mentioned. The two women\nlooked at this person whose presence they had entirely forgotten, and\nretired; but, as she left the apartment, Julie gave the stranger a\nsupplicating glance, to which he replied by a smile that an indifferent\nspectator would have been surprised to see on his stern features. The\ntwo men were left alone. \"Well, sir,\" said Morrel, sinking into a chair,\n\"you have heard all, and I have nothing further to tell you.\"\n\n\"I see,\" returned the Englishman, \"that a fresh and unmerited misfortune\nhis overwhelmed you, and this only increases my desire to serve you.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir!\" cried Morrel.\n\n\"Let me see,\" continued the stranger, \"I am one of your largest\ncreditors.\"\n\n\"Your bills, at least, are the first that will fall due.\"\n\n\"Do you wish for time to pay?\"\n\n\"A delay would save my honor, and consequently my life.\"\n\n\"How long a delay do you wish for?\"--Morrel reflected. \"Two months,\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"I will give you three,\" replied the stranger.\n\n\"But,\" asked Morrel, \"will the house of Thomson & French consent?\"\n\n\"Oh, I take everything on myself. To-day is the 5th of June.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, renew these bills up to the 5th of September; and on the 5th of\nSeptember at eleven o'clock (the hand of the clock pointed to eleven), I\nshall come to receive the money.\"\n\n\"I shall expect you,\" returned Morrel; \"and I will pay you--or I shall\nbe dead.\" These last words were uttered in so low a tone that the\nstranger could not hear them. The bills were renewed, the old ones\ndestroyed, and the poor ship-owner found himself with three months\nbefore him to collect his resources. The Englishman received his thanks\nwith the phlegm peculiar to his nation; and Morrel, overwhelming him\nwith grateful blessings, conducted him to the staircase. The stranger\nmet Julie on the stairs; she pretended to be descending, but in reality\nshe was waiting for him. \"Oh, sir\"--said she, clasping her hands.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said the stranger, \"one day you will receive a letter\nsigned 'Sinbad the Sailor.' Do exactly what the letter bids you, however\nstrange it may appear.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" returned Julie.\n\n\"Do you promise?\"\n\n\"I swear to you I will.\"\n\n\"It is well. Adieu, mademoiselle. Continue to be the good, sweet girl\nyou are at present, and I have great hopes that heaven will reward you\nby giving you Emmanuel for a husband.\"\n\nJulie uttered a faint cry, blushed like a rose, and leaned against the\nbaluster. The stranger waved his hand, and continued to descend. In\nthe court he found Penelon, who, with a rouleau of a hundred francs in\neither hand, seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them. \"Come\nwith me, my friend,\" said the Englishman; \"I wish to speak to you.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 30. The Fifth of September.\n\nThe extension provided for by the agent of Thomson & French, at the\nmoment when Morrel expected it least, was to the poor shipowner so\ndecided a stroke of good fortune that he almost dared to believe that\nfate was at length grown weary of wasting her spite upon him. The same\nday he told his wife, Emmanuel, and his daughter all that had occurred;\nand a ray of hope, if not of tranquillity, returned to the family.\nUnfortunately, however, Morrel had not only engagements with the house\nof Thomson & French, who had shown themselves so considerate towards\nhim; and, as he had said, in business he had correspondents, and not\nfriends. When he thought the matter over, he could by no means account\nfor this generous conduct on the part of Thomson & French towards him;\nand could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this:--\"We\nhad better help a man who owes us nearly 300,000 francs, and have those\n300,000 francs at the end of three months than hasten his ruin, and\nget only six or eight per cent of our money back again.\" Unfortunately,\nwhether through envy or stupidity, all Morrel's correspondents did not\ntake this view; and some even came to a contrary decision. The\nbills signed by Morrel were presented at his office with scrupulous\nexactitude, and, thanks to the delay granted by the Englishman, were\npaid by Cocles with equal punctuality. Cocles thus remained in his\naccustomed tranquillity. It was Morrel alone who remembered with alarm,\nthat if he had to repay on the 15th the 50,000 francs of M. de Boville,\nand on the 30th the 32,500 francs of bills, for which, as well as the\ndebt due to the inspector of prisons, he had time granted, he must be a\nruined man.\n\nThe opinion of all the commercial men was that, under the reverses\nwhich had successively weighed down Morrel, it was impossible for him to\nremain solvent. Great, therefore, was the astonishment when at the\nend of the month, he cancelled all his obligations with his usual\npunctuality. Still confidence was not restored to all minds, and the\ngeneral opinion was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner\nhad been postponed only until the end of the month. The month passed,\nand Morrel made extraordinary efforts to get in all his resources.\nFormerly his paper, at any date, was taken with confidence, and was even\nin request. Morrel now tried to negotiate bills at ninety days only, and\nnone of the banks would give him credit. Fortunately, Morrel had some\nfunds coming in on which he could rely; and, as they reached him, he\nfound himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the end of\nJuly came. The agent of Thomson & French had not been again seen at\nMarseilles; the day after, or two days after his visit to Morrel, he had\ndisappeared; and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the\nmayor, the inspector of prisons, and M. Morrel, his departure left no\ntrace except in the memories of these three persons. As to the sailors\nof the Pharaon, they must have found snug berths elsewhere, for they\nalso had disappeared.\n\nCaptain Gaumard, recovered from his illness, had returned from Palma.\nHe delayed presenting himself at Morrel's, but the owner, hearing of\nhis arrival, went to see him. The worthy shipowner knew, from Penelon's\nrecital, of the captain's brave conduct during the storm, and tried to\nconsole him. He brought him also the amount of his wages, which Captain\nGaumard had not dared to apply for. As he descended the staircase,\nMorrel met Penelon, who was going up. Penelon had, it would seem, made\ngood use of his money, for he was newly clad. When he saw his employer,\nthe worthy tar seemed much embarrassed, drew on one side into the corner\nof the landing-place, passed his quid from one cheek to the other,\nstared stupidly with his great eyes, and only acknowledged the squeeze\nof the hand which Morrel as usual gave him by a slight pressure in\nreturn. Morrel attributed Penelon's embarrassment to the elegance of his\nattire; it was evident the good fellow had not gone to such an expense\non his own account; he was, no doubt, engaged on board some other\nvessel, and thus his bashfulness arose from the fact of his not having,\nif we may so express ourselves, worn mourning for the Pharaon longer.\nPerhaps he had come to tell Captain Gaumard of his good luck, and to\noffer him employment from his new master. \"Worthy fellows!\" said Morrel,\nas he went away, \"may your new master love you as I loved you, and be\nmore fortunate than I have been!\"\n\nAugust rolled by in unceasing efforts on the part of Morrel to renew\nhis credit or revive the old. On the 20th of August it was known at\nMarseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach, and then it was said\nthat the bills would go to protest at the end of the month, and that\nMorrel had gone away and left his chief clerk Emmanuel, and his cashier\nCocles, to meet the creditors. But, contrary to all expectation, when\nthe 31st of August came, the house opened as usual, and Cocles appeared\nbehind the grating of the counter, examined all bills presented with\nthe usual scrutiny, and, from first to last, paid all with the usual\nprecision. There came in, moreover, two drafts which M. Morrel had fully\nanticipated, and which Cocles paid as punctually as the bills which the\nshipowner had accepted. All this was incomprehensible, and then, with\nthe tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news, the failure was put off\nuntil the end of September. On the 1st, Morrel returned; he was awaited\nby his family with extreme anxiety, for from this journey to Paris\nthey hoped great things. Morrel had thought of Danglars, who was now\nimmensely rich, and had lain under great obligations to Morrel in former\ndays, since to him it was owing that Danglars entered the service of\nthe Spanish banker, with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast\nwealth. It was said at this moment that Danglars was worth from six\nto eight millions of francs, and had unlimited credit. Danglars, then,\nwithout taking a crown from his pocket, could save Morrel; he had but to\npass his word for a loan, and Morrel was saved. Morrel had long thought\nof Danglars, but had kept away from some instinctive motive, and had\ndelayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource. And\nMorrel was right, for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a\nrefusal. Yet, on his arrival, Morrel did not utter a complaint, or\nsay one harsh word. He embraced his weeping wife and daughter, pressed\nEmmanuel's hand with friendly warmth, and then going to his private room\non the second floor had sent for Cocles. \"Then,\" said the two women to\nEmmanuel, \"we are indeed ruined.\"\n\nIt was agreed in a brief council held among them, that Julie should\nwrite to her brother, who was in garrison at Nimes, to come to them\nas speedily as possible. The poor women felt instinctively that they\nrequired all their strength to support the blow that impended. Besides,\nMaximilian Morrel, though hardly two and twenty, had great influence\nover his father. He was a strong-minded, upright young man. At the time\nwhen he decided on his profession his father had no desire to choose for\nhim, but had consulted young Maximilian's taste. He had at once declared\nfor a military life, and had in consequence studied hard, passed\nbrilliantly through the Polytechnic School, and left it as\nsub-lieutenant of the 53d of the line. For a year he had held this rank,\nand expected promotion on the first vacancy. In his regiment Maximilian\nMorrel was noted for his rigid observance, not only of the obligations\nimposed on a soldier, but also of the duties of a man; and he thus\ngained the name of \"the stoic.\" We need hardly say that many of those\nwho gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it, and did\nnot even know what it meant. This was the young man whom his mother and\nsister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which\nthey felt they would soon have to endure. They had not mistaken the\ngravity of this event, for the moment after Morrel had entered his\nprivate office with Cocles, Julie saw the latter leave it pale,\ntrembling, and his features betraying the utmost consternation. She\nwould have questioned him as he passed by her, but the worthy creature\nhastened down the staircase with unusual precipitation, and only raised\nhis hands to heaven and exclaimed, \"Oh, mademoiselle, mademoiselle,\nwhat a dreadful misfortune! Who could ever have believed it!\" A moment\nafterwards Julie saw him go up-stairs carrying two or three heavy\nledgers, a portfolio, and a bag of money.\n\nMorrel examined the ledgers, opened the portfolio, and counted the\nmoney. All his funds amounted to 6,000, or 8,000. francs, his bills\nreceivable up to the 5th to 4,000 or 5,000, which, making the best of\neverything, gave him 14,000. francs to meet debts amounting to 287,500\nfrancs. He had not even the means for making a possible settlement on\naccount. However, when Morrel went down to his dinner, he appeared very\ncalm. This calmness was more alarming to the two women than the deepest\ndejection would have been. After dinner Morrel usually went out and used\nto take his coffee at the Phocaean club, and read the Semaphore; this\nday he did not leave the house, but returned to his office.\n\nAs to Cocles, he seemed completely bewildered. For part of the day he\nwent into the court-yard, seated himself on a stone with his head bare\nand exposed to the blazing sun. Emmanuel tried to comfort the women, but\nhis eloquence faltered. The young man was too well acquainted with the\nbusiness of the house, not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over\nthe Morrel family. Night came, the two women had watched, hoping that\nwhen he left his room Morrel would come to them, but they heard him pass\nbefore their door, and trying to conceal the noise of his footsteps.\nThey listened; he went into his sleeping-room, and fastened the door\ninside. Madame Morrel sent her daughter to bed, and half an hour after\nJulie had retired, she rose, took off her shoes, and went stealthily\nalong the passage, to see through the keyhole what her husband was\ndoing. In the passage she saw a retreating shadow; it was Julie, who,\nuneasy herself, had anticipated her mother. The young lady went towards\nMadame Morrel.\n\n\"He is writing,\" she said. They had understood each other without\nspeaking. Madame Morrel looked again through the keyhole, Morrel was\nwriting; but Madame Morrel remarked, what her daughter had not observed,\nthat her husband was writing on stamped paper. The terrible idea that he\nwas writing his will flashed across her; she shuddered, and yet had not\nstrength to utter a word. Next day M. Morrel seemed as calm as ever,\nwent into his office as usual, came to his breakfast punctually, and\nthen, after dinner, he placed his daughter beside him, took her head\nin his arms, and held her for a long time against his bosom. In the\nevening, Julie told her mother, that although he was apparently so calm,\nshe had noticed that her father's heart beat violently. The next\ntwo days passed in much the same way. On the evening of the 4th of\nSeptember, M. Morrel asked his daughter for the key of his study. Julie\ntrembled at this request, which seemed to her of bad omen. Why did her\nfather ask for this key which she always kept, and which was only taken\nfrom her in childhood as a punishment? The young girl looked at Morrel.\n\n\"What have I done wrong, father,\" she said, \"that you should take this\nkey from me?\"\n\n\"Nothing, my dear,\" replied the unhappy man, the tears starting to his\neyes at this simple question,--\"nothing, only I want it.\" Julie made\na pretence to feel for the key. \"I must have left it in my room,\"\nshe said. And she went out, but instead of going to her apartment she\nhastened to consult Emmanuel. \"Do not give this key to your father,\"\nsaid he, \"and to-morrow morning, if possible, do not quit him for a\nmoment.\" She questioned Emmanuel, but he knew nothing, or would not say\nwhat he knew. During the night, between the 4th and 5th of September,\nMadame Morrel remained listening for every sound, and, until three\no'clock in the morning, she heard her husband pacing the room in great\nagitation. It was three o'clock when he threw himself on the bed.\nThe mother and daughter passed the night together. They had expected\nMaximilian since the previous evening. At eight o'clock in the morning\nMorrel entered their chamber. He was calm; but the agitation of the\nnight was legible in his pale and careworn visage. They did not dare\nto ask him how he had slept. Morrel was kinder to his wife, more\naffectionate to his daughter, than he had ever been. He could not cease\ngazing at and kissing the sweet girl. Julie, mindful of Emmanuel's\nrequest, was following her father when he quitted the room, but he said\nto her quickly,--\"Remain with your mother, dearest.\" Julie wished to\naccompany him. \"I wish you to do so,\" said he.\n\nThis was the first time Morrel had ever so spoken, but he said it in\na tone of paternal kindness, and Julie did not dare to disobey. She\nremained at the same spot standing mute and motionless. An instant\nafterwards the door opened, she felt two arms encircle her, and a mouth\npressed her forehead. She looked up and uttered an exclamation of joy.\n\n\"Maximilian, my dearest brother!\" she cried. At these words Madame\nMorrel rose, and threw herself into her son's arms. \"Mother,\" said the\nyoung man, looking alternately at Madame Morrel and her daughter, \"what\nhas occurred--what has happened? Your letter has frightened me, and I\nhave come hither with all speed.\"\n\n\"Julie,\" said Madame Morrel, making a sign to the young man, \"go and\ntell your father that Maximilian has just arrived.\" The young lady\nrushed out of the apartment, but on the first step of the staircase she\nfound a man holding a letter in his hand.\n\n\"Are you not Mademoiselle Julie Morrel?\" inquired the man, with a strong\nItalian accent.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Julie with hesitation; \"what is your pleasure? I do\nnot know you.\"\n\n\"Read this letter,\" he said, handing it to her. Julie hesitated. \"It\nconcerns the best interests of your father,\" said the messenger.\n\nThe young girl hastily took the letter from him. She opened it quickly\nand read:--\n\n\"Go this moment to the Allees de Meillan, enter the house No. 15,\nask the porter for the key of the room on the fifth floor, enter the\napartment, take from the corner of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red\nsilk, and give it to your father. It is important that he should receive\nit before eleven o'clock. You promised to obey me implicitly. Remember\nyour oath.\n\n\"Sinbad the Sailor.\"\n\nThe young girl uttered a joyful cry, raised her eyes, looked round to\nquestion the messenger, but he had disappeared. She cast her eyes\nagain over the note to peruse it a second time, and saw there was a\npostscript. She read:--\n\n\"It is important that you should fulfil this mission in person and\nalone. If you go accompanied by any other person, or should any one else\ngo in your place, the porter will reply that he does not know anything\nabout it.\"\n\nThis postscript decreased greatly the young girl's happiness. Was there\nnothing to fear? was there not some snare laid for her? Her innocence\nhad kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young girl\nof her age. But there is no need to know danger in order to fear it;\nindeed, it may be observed, that it is usually unknown perils that\ninspire the greatest terror.\n\nJulie hesitated, and resolved to take counsel. Yet, through a singular\nimpulse, it was neither to her mother nor her brother that she applied,\nbut to Emmanuel. She hastened down and told him what had occurred on the\nday when the agent of Thomson & French had come to her father's, related\nthe scene on the staircase, repeated the promise she had made, and\nshowed him the letter. \"You must go, then, mademoiselle,\" said Emmanuel.\n\n\"Go there?\" murmured Julie.\n\n\"Yes; I will accompany you.\"\n\n\"But did you not read that I must be alone?\" said Julie.\n\n\"And you shall be alone,\" replied the young man. \"I will await you at\nthe corner of the Rue de Musee, and if you are so long absent as to make\nme uneasy, I will hasten to rejoin you, and woe to him of whom you shall\nhave cause to complain to me!\"\n\n\"Then, Emmanuel?\" said the young girl with hesitation, \"it is your\nopinion that I should obey this invitation?\"\n\n\"Yes. Did not the messenger say your father's safety depended upon it?\"\n\n\"But what danger threatens him, then, Emmanuel?\" she asked.\n\nEmmanuel hesitated a moment, but his desire to make Julie decide\nimmediately made him reply.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said; \"to-day is the 5th of September, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"To-day, then, at eleven o'clock, your father has nearly three hundred\nthousand francs to pay?\"\n\n\"Yes, we know that.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" continued Emmanuel, \"we have not fifteen thousand francs\nin the house.\"\n\n\"What will happen then?\"\n\n\"Why, if to-day before eleven o'clock your father has not found someone\nwho will come to his aid, he will be compelled at twelve o'clock to\ndeclare himself a bankrupt.\"\n\n\"Oh, come, then, come!\" cried she, hastening away with the young man.\nDuring this time, Madame Morrel had told her son everything. The young\nman knew quite well that, after the succession of misfortunes which\nhad befallen his father, great changes had taken place in the style of\nliving and housekeeping; but he did not know that matters had reached\nsuch a point. He was thunderstruck. Then, rushing hastily out of the\napartment, he ran up-stairs, expecting to find his father in his study,\nbut he rapped there in vain.\n\nWhile he was yet at the door of the study he heard the bedroom door\nopen, turned, and saw his father. Instead of going direct to his study,\nM. Morrel had returned to his bed-chamber, which he was only this moment\nquitting. Morrel uttered a cry of surprise at the sight of his son,\nof whose arrival he was ignorant. He remained motionless on the spot,\npressing with his left hand something he had concealed under his coat.\nMaximilian sprang down the staircase, and threw his arms round his\nfather's neck; but suddenly he recoiled, and placed his right hand on\nMorrel's breast. \"Father,\" he exclaimed, turning pale as death, \"what\nare you going to do with that brace of pistols under your coat?\"\n\n\"Oh, this is what I feared!\" said Morrel.\n\n\"Father, father, in heaven's name,\" exclaimed the young man, \"what are\nthese weapons for?\"\n\n\"Maximilian,\" replied Morrel, looking fixedly at his son, \"you are a\nman, and a man of honor. Come, and I will explain to you.\"\n\nAnd with a firm step Morrel went up to his study, while Maximilian\nfollowed him, trembling as he went. Morrel opened the door, and closed\nit behind his son; then, crossing the anteroom, went to his desk on\nwhich he placed the pistols, and pointed with his finger to an open\nledger. In this ledger was made out an exact balance-sheet of his\naffair's. Morrel had to pay, within half an hour, 287,500 francs. All he\npossessed was 15,257 francs. \"Read!\" said Morrel.\n\nThe young man was overwhelmed as he read. Morrel said not a word. What\ncould he say? What need he add to such a desperate proof in figures?\"\nAnd have you done all that is possible, father, to meet this disastrous\nresult?\" asked the young man, after a moment's pause. \"I have,\" replied\nMorrel.\n\n\"You have no money coming in on which you can rely?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"You have exhausted every resource?\"\n\n\"All.\"\n\n\"And in half an hour,\" said Maximilian in a gloomy voice, \"our name is\ndishonored!\"\n\n\"Blood washes out dishonor,\" said Morrel.\n\n\"You are right, father; I understand you.\" Then extending his hand\ntowards one of the pistols, he said, \"There is one for you and one for\nme--thanks!\" Morrel caught his hand. \"Your mother--your sister! Who will\nsupport them?\" A shudder ran through the young man's frame. \"Father,\" he\nsaid, \"do you reflect that you are bidding me to live?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do so bid you,\" answered Morrel, \"it is your duty. You have a\ncalm, strong mind, Maximilian. Maximilian, you are no ordinary man. I\nmake no requests or commands; I only ask you to examine my position as\nif it were your own, and then judge for yourself.\"\n\nThe young man reflected for a moment, then an expression of sublime\nresignation appeared in his eyes, and with a slow and sad gesture he\ntook off his two epaulets, the insignia of his rank. \"Be it so, then,\nmy father,\" he said, extending his hand to Morrel, \"die in peace, my\nfather; I will live.\" Morrel was about to cast himself on his knees\nbefore his son, but Maximilian caught him in his arms, and those two\nnoble hearts were pressed against each other for a moment. \"You know it\nis not my fault,\" said Morrel. Maximilian smiled. \"I know, father, you\nare the most honorable man I have ever known.\"\n\n\"Good, my son. And now there is no more to be said; go and rejoin your\nmother and sister.\"\n\n\"My father,\" said the young man, bending his knee, \"bless me!\" Morrel\ntook the head of his son between his two hands, drew him forward, and\nkissing his forehead several times said, \"Oh, yes, yes, I bless you in\nmy own name, and in the name of three generations of irreproachable\nmen, who say through me, 'The edifice which misfortune has destroyed,\nprovidence may build up again.' On seeing me die such a death, the most\ninexorable will have pity on you. To you, perhaps, they will accord the\ntime they have refused to me. Then do your best to keep our name free\nfrom dishonor. Go to work, labor, young man, struggle ardently and\ncourageously; live, yourself, your mother and sister, with the most\nrigid economy, so that from day to day the property of those whom I\nleave in your hands may augment and fructify. Reflect how glorious a day\nit will be, how grand, how solemn, that day of complete restoration, on\nwhich you will say in this very office, 'My father died because he could\nnot do what I have this day done; but he died calmly and peaceably,\nbecause in dying he knew what I should do.'\"\n\n\"My father, my father!\" cried the young man, \"why should you not live?\"\n\n\"If I live, all would be changed; if I live, interest would be converted\ninto doubt, pity into hostility; if I live I am only a man who his\nbroken his word, failed in his engagements--in fact, only a bankrupt.\nIf, on the contrary, I die, remember, Maximilian, my corpse is that of\nan honest but unfortunate man. Living, my best friends would avoid my\nhouse; dead, all Marseilles will follow me in tears to my last home.\nLiving, you would feel shame at my name; dead, you may raise your head\nand say, 'I am the son of him you killed, because, for the first time,\nhe has been compelled to break his word.'\"\n\nThe young man uttered a groan, but appeared resigned.\n\n\"And now,\" said Morrel, \"leave me alone, and endeavor to keep your\nmother and sister away.\"\n\n\"Will you not see my sister once more?\" asked Maximilian. A last\nbut final hope was concealed by the young man in the effect of this\ninterview, and therefore he had suggested it. Morrel shook his head. \"I\nsaw her this morning, and bade her adieu.\"\n\n\"Have you no particular commands to leave with me, my father?\" inquired\nMaximilian in a faltering voice.\n\n\"Yes; my son, and a sacred command.\"\n\n\"Say it, my father.\"\n\n\"The house of Thomson & French is the only one who, from humanity, or,\nit may be, selfishness--it is not for me to read men's hearts--has had\nany pity for me. Its agent, who will in ten minutes present himself to\nreceive the amount of a bill of 287,500 francs, I will not say granted,\nbut offered me three months. Let this house be the first repaid, my son,\nand respect this man.\"\n\n\"Father, I will,\" said Maximilian.\n\n\"And now, once more, adieu,\" said Morrel. \"Go, leave me; I would be\nalone. You will find my will in the secretary in my bedroom.\"\n\nThe young man remained standing and motionless, having but the force of\nwill and not the power of execution.\n\n\"Hear me, Maximilian,\" said his father. \"Suppose I was a soldier like\nyou, and ordered to carry a certain redoubt, and you knew I must be\nkilled in the assault, would you not say to me, as you said just now,\n'Go, father; for you are dishonored by delay, and death is preferable to\nshame!'\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the young man, \"yes;\" and once again embracing his\nfather with convulsive pressure, he said, \"Be it so, my father.\"\n\nAnd he rushed out of the study. When his son had left him, Morrel\nremained an instant standing with his eyes fixed on the door; then\nputting forth his arm, he pulled the bell. After a moment's interval,\nCocles appeared.\n\nIt was no longer the same man--the fearful revelations of the three last\ndays had crushed him. This thought--the house of Morrel is about to stop\npayment--bent him to the earth more than twenty years would otherwise\nhave done.\n\n\"My worthy Cocles,\" said Morrel in a tone impossible to describe, \"do\nyou remain in the ante-chamber. When the gentleman who came three months\nago--the agent of Thomson & French--arrives, announce his arrival to\nme.\" Cocles made no reply; he made a sign with his head, went into the\nanteroom, and seated himself. Morrel fell back in his chair, his eyes\nfixed on the clock; there were seven minutes left, that was all. The\nhand moved on with incredible rapidity, he seemed to see its motion.\n\nWhat passed in the mind of this man at the supreme moment of his agony\ncannot be told in words. He was still comparatively young, he was\nsurrounded by the loving care of a devoted family, but he had convinced\nhimself by a course of reasoning, illogical perhaps, yet certainly\nplausible, that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the\nworld, even life itself. To form the slightest idea of his feelings, one\nmust have seen his face with its expression of enforced resignation and\nits tear-moistened eyes raised to heaven. The minute hand moved on.\nThe pistols were loaded; he stretched forth his hand, took one up, and\nmurmured his daughter's name. Then he laid it down seized his pen, and\nwrote a few words. It seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient\nfarewell of his beloved daughter. Then he turned again to the clock,\ncounting time now not by minutes, but by seconds. He took up the deadly\nweapon again, his lips parted and his eyes fixed on the clock, and then\nshuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the pistol. At this\nmoment of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his brow, a pang\nstronger than death clutched at his heart-strings. He heard the door of\nthe staircase creak on its hinges--the clock gave its warning to strike\neleven--the door of his study opened; Morrel did not turn round--he\nexpected these words of Cocles, \"The agent of Thomson & French.\"\n\nHe placed the muzzle of the pistol between his teeth. Suddenly he heard\na cry--it was his daughter's voice. He turned and saw Julie. The pistol\nfell from his hands. \"My father!\" cried the young girl, out of breath,\nand half dead with joy--\"saved, you are saved!\" And she threw herself\ninto his arms, holding in her extended hand a red, netted silk purse.\n\n\"Saved, my child!\" said Morrel; \"what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, saved--saved! See, see!\" said the young girl.\n\nMorrel took the purse, and started as he did so, for a vague remembrance\nreminded him that it once belonged to himself. At one end was the\nreceipted bill for the 287,000 francs, and at the other was a diamond\nas large as a hazel-nut, with these words on a small slip of\nparchment:--Julie's Dowry.\n\nMorrel passed his hand over his brow; it seemed to him a dream. At this\nmoment the clock struck eleven. He felt as if each stroke of the hammer\nfell upon his heart. \"Explain, my child,\" he said, \"Explain, my child,\"\nhe said, \"explain--where did you find this purse?\"\n\n\"In a house in the Allees de Meillan, No. 15, on the corner of a\nmantelpiece in a small room on the fifth floor.\"\n\n\"But,\" cried Morrel, \"this purse is not yours!\" Julie handed to her\nfather the letter she had received in the morning.\n\n\"And did you go alone?\" asked Morrel, after he had read it.\n\n\"Emmanuel accompanied me, father. He was to have waited for me at the\ncorner of the Rue de Musee, but, strange to say, he was not there when I\nreturned.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Morrel!\" exclaimed a voice on the stairs.--\"Monsieur Morrel!\"\n\n\"It is his voice!\" said Julie. At this moment Emmanuel entered, his\ncountenance full of animation and joy. \"The Pharaon!\" he cried; \"the\nPharaon!\"\n\n\"What--what--the Pharaon! Are you mad, Emmanuel? You know the vessel is\nlost.\"\n\n\"The Pharaon, sir--they signal the Pharaon! The Pharaon is entering the\nharbor!\" Morrel fell back in his chair, his strength was failing him;\nhis understanding weakened by such events, refused to comprehend such\nincredible, unheard-of, fabulous facts. But his son came in. \"Father,\"\ncried Maximilian, \"how could you say the Pharaon was lost? The lookout\nhas signalled her, and they say she is now coming into port.\"\n\n\"My dear friends,\" said Morrel, \"if this be so, it must be a miracle of\nheaven! Impossible, impossible!\"\n\nBut what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his\nhand, the acceptance receipted--the splendid diamond.\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" exclaimed Cocles, \"what can it mean?--the Pharaon?\"\n\n\"Come, dear ones,\" said Morrel, rising from his seat, \"let us go and\nsee, and heaven have pity upon us if it be false intelligence!\" They all\nwent out, and on the stairs met Madame Morrel, who had been afraid to go\nup into the study. In a moment they were at the Cannebiere. There was a\ncrowd on the pier. All the crowd gave way before Morrel. \"The Pharaon,\nthe Pharaon!\" said every voice.\n\nAnd, wonderful to see, in front of the tower of Saint-Jean, was a\nship bearing on her stern these words, printed in white letters, \"The\nPharaon, Morrel & Son, of Marseilles.\" She was the exact duplicate of\nthe other Pharaon, and loaded, as that had been, with cochineal and\nindigo. She cast anchor, clued up sails, and on the deck was Captain\nGaumard giving orders, and good old Penelon making signals to M. Morrel.\nTo doubt any longer was impossible; there was the evidence of the\nsenses, and ten thousand persons who came to corroborate the testimony.\nAs Morrel and his son embraced on the pier-head, in the presence and\namid the applause of the whole city witnessing this event, a man, with\nhis face half-covered by a black beard, and who, concealed behind the\nsentry-box, watched the scene with delight, uttered these words in a low\ntone: \"Be happy, noble heart, be blessed for all the good thou hast done\nand wilt do hereafter, and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like\nyour good deeds.\"\n\nAnd with a smile expressive of supreme content, he left his\nhiding-place, and without being observed, descended one of the flights\nof steps provided for debarkation, and hailing three times, shouted\n\"Jacopo, Jacopo, Jacopo!\" Then a launch came to shore, took him on\nboard, and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up, on whose deck\nhe sprung with the activity of a sailor; thence he once again looked\ntowards Morrel, who, weeping with joy, was shaking hands most cordially\nwith all the crowd around him, and thanking with a look the unknown\nbenefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies. \"And now,\" said\nthe unknown, \"farewell kindness, humanity, and gratitude! Farewell to\nall the feelings that expand the heart! I have been heaven's substitute\nto recompense the good--now the god of vengeance yields to me his power\nto punish the wicked!\" At these words he gave a signal, and, as if only\nawaiting this signal, the yacht instantly put out to sea.\n\n\n\nChapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor.\n\nTowards the beginning of the year 1838, two young men belonging to the\nfirst society of Paris, the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf and the Baron\nFranz d'Epinay, were at Florence. They had agreed to see the Carnival at\nRome that year, and that Franz, who for the last three or four years\nhad inhabited Italy, should act as cicerone to Albert. As it is no\ninconsiderable affair to spend the Carnival at Rome, especially when\nyou have no great desire to sleep on the Piazza del Popolo, or the Campo\nVaccino, they wrote to Signor Pastrini, the proprietor of the Hotel de\nLondres, Piazza di Spagna, to reserve comfortable apartments for them.\nSignor Pastrini replied that he had only two rooms and a parlor on the\nthird floor, which he offered at the low charge of a louis per diem.\nThey accepted his offer; but wishing to make the best use of the time\nthat was left, Albert started for Naples. As for Franz, he remained at\nFlorence, and after having passed a few days in exploring the paradise\nof the Cascine, and spending two or three evenings at the houses of\nthe Florentine nobility, he took a fancy into his head (having\nalready visited Corsica, the cradle of Bonaparte) to visit Elba, the\nwaiting-place of Napoleon.\n\nOne evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring\nthat secured it to the dock at Leghorn, wrapped himself in his coat and\nlay down, and said to the crew,--\"To the Island of Elba!\" The boat shot\nout of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz disembarked at\nPorto-Ferrajo. He traversed the island, after having followed the\ntraces which the footsteps of the giant have left, and re-embarked\nfor Marciana. Two hours after he again landed at Pianosa, where he was\nassured that red partridges abounded. The sport was bad; Franz only\nsucceeded in killing a few partridges, and, like every unsuccessful\nsportsman, he returned to the boat very much out of temper. \"Ah, if your\nexcellency chose,\" said the captain, \"you might have capital sport.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Do you see that island?\" continued the captain, pointing to a conical\npile rising from the indigo sea.\n\n\"Well, what is this island?\"\n\n\"The Island of Monte Cristo.\"\n\n\"But I have no permission to shoot over this island.\"\n\n\"Your excellency does not require a permit, for the island is\nuninhabited.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed!\" said the young man. \"A desert island in the midst of the\nMediterranean must be a curiosity.\"\n\n\"It is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks, and does not\ncontain an acre of land capable of cultivation.\"\n\n\"To whom does this island belong?\"\n\n\"To Tuscany.\"\n\n\"What game shall I find there!\"\n\n\"Thousands of wild goats.\"\n\n\"Who live upon the stones, I suppose,\" said Franz with an incredulous\nsmile.\n\n\"No, but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the crevices\nof the rocks.\"\n\n\"Where can I sleep?\"\n\n\"On shore in the grottos, or on board in your cloak; besides, if your\nexcellency pleases, we can leave as soon as you like--we can sail as\nwell by night as by day, and if the wind drops we can use our oars.\"\n\nAs Franz had sufficient time, and his apartments at Rome were not\nyet available, he accepted the proposition. Upon his answer in the\naffirmative, the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone.\n\"Well,\" asked he, \"what now? Is there any difficulty in the way?\"\n\n\"No.\" replied the captain, \"but we must warn your excellency that the\nisland is an infected port.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Monte Cristo although uninhabited, yet serves occasionally as a refuge\nfor the smugglers and pirates who come from Corsica, Sardinia, and\nAfrica, and if it becomes known that we have been there, we shall have\nto perform quarantine for six days on our return to Leghorn.\"\n\n\"The deuce! That puts a different face on the matter. Six days! Why,\nthat's as long as the Almighty took to make the world! Too long a\nwait--too long.\"\n\n\"But who will say your excellency has been to Monte Cristo?\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall not,\" cried Franz.\n\n\"Nor I, nor I,\" chorused the sailors.\n\n\"Then steer for Monte Cristo.\"\n\nThe captain gave his orders, the helm was put up, and the boat was soon\nsailing in the direction of the island. Franz waited until all was in\norder, and when the sail was filled, and the four sailors had taken\ntheir places--three forward, and one at the helm--he resumed the\nconversation. \"Gaetano,\" said he to the captain, \"you tell me Monte\nCristo serves as a refuge for pirates, who are, it seems to me, a very\ndifferent kind of game from the goats.\"\n\n\"Yes, your excellency, and it is true.\"\n\n\"I knew there were smugglers, but I thought that since the capture of\nAlgiers, and the destruction of the regency, pirates existed only in the\nromances of Cooper and Captain Marryat.\"\n\n\"Your excellency is mistaken; there are pirates, like the bandits who\nwere believed to have been exterminated by Pope Leo XII., and who yet,\nevery day, rob travellers at the gates of Rome. Has not your excellency\nheard that the French charge d'affaires was robbed six months ago within\nfive hundred paces of Velletri?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I heard that.\"\n\n\"Well, then, if, like us, your excellency lived at Leghorn, you would\nhear, from time to time, that a little merchant vessel, or an English\nyacht that was expected at Bastia, at Porto-Ferrajo, or at Civita\nVecchia, has not arrived; no one knows what has become of it, but,\ndoubtless, it has struck on a rock and foundered. Now this rock it has\nmet has been a long and narrow boat, manned by six or eight men, who\nhave surprised and plundered it, some dark and stormy night, near some\ndesert and gloomy island, as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses\nof a forest.\"\n\n\"But,\" asked Franz, who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the\nboat, \"why do not those who have been plundered complain to the French,\nSardinian, or Tuscan governments?\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Gaetano with a smile.\n\n\"Yes, why?\"\n\n\"Because, in the first place, they transfer from the vessel to their own\nboat whatever they think worth taking, then they bind the crew hand and\nfoot, they attach to every one's neck a four and twenty pound ball, a\nlarge hole is chopped in the vessel's bottom, and then they leave her.\nAt the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and settle\ndown. First one gun'l goes under, then the other. Then they lift and\nsink again, and both go under at once. All at once there's a noise like\na cannon--that's the air blowing up the deck. Soon the water rushes\nout of the scupper-holes like a whale spouting, the vessel gives a last\ngroan, spins round and round, and disappears, forming a vast whirlpool\nin the ocean, and then all is over, so that in five minutes nothing but\nthe eye of God can see the vessel where she lies at the bottom of the\nsea. Do you understand now,\" said the captain, \"why no complaints are\nmade to the government, and why the vessel never reaches port?\"\n\nIt is probable that if Gaetano had related this previous to proposing\nthe expedition, Franz would have hesitated, but now that they had\nstarted, he thought it would be cowardly to draw back. He was one of\nthose men who do not rashly court danger, but if danger presents itself,\ncombat it with the most unalterable coolness. Calm and resolute, he\ntreated any peril as he would an adversary in a duel,--calculated\nits probable method of approach; retreated, if at all, as a point of\nstrategy and not from cowardice; was quick to see an opening for attack,\nand won victory at a single thrust. \"Bah!\" said he, \"I have travelled\nthrough Sicily and Calabria--I have sailed two months in the\nArchipelago, and yet I never saw even the shadow of a bandit or a\npirate.\"\n\n\"I did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project,\"\nreplied Gaetano, \"but you questioned me, and I have answered; that's\nall.\"\n\n\"Yes, and your conversation is most interesting; and as I wish to enjoy\nit as long as possible, steer for Monte Cristo.\"\n\nThe wind blew strongly, the boat made six or seven knots an hour, and\nthey were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage. As they drew near\nthe island seemed to lift from the sea, and the air was so clear that\nthey could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another, like\ncannon balls in an arsenal, with green bushes and trees growing in the\ncrevices. As for the sailors, although they appeared perfectly tranquil\nyet it was evident that they were on the alert, and that they carefully\nwatched the glassy surface over which they were sailing, and on which a\nfew fishing-boats, with their white sails, were alone visible. They were\nwithin fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to set behind\nCorsica, whose mountains appeared against the sky, showing their rugged\npeaks in bold relief; this mass of rock, like the giant Adamastor, rose\ndead ahead, a formidable barrier, and intercepting the light that gilded\nits massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow. Little by little\nthe shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of\nthe expiring day; at last the reflection rested on the summit of the\nmountain, where it paused an instant, like the fiery crest of a volcano,\nthen gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base, and\nthe island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually\ndarker; half an hour after, the night was quite dark.\n\nFortunately, the mariners were used to these latitudes, and knew every\nrock in the Tuscan Archipelago; for in the midst of this obscurity Franz\nwas not without uneasiness--Corsica had long since disappeared, and\nMonte Cristo itself was invisible; but the sailors seemed, like the\nlynx, to see in the dark, and the pilot who steered did not evince the\nslightest hesitation. An hour had passed since the sun had set, when\nFranz fancied he saw, at a quarter of a mile to the left, a dark mass,\nbut he could not precisely make out what it was, and fearing to excite\nthe mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land, he\nremained silent; suddenly a great light appeared on the strand; land\nmight resemble a cloud, but the fire was not a meteor. \"What is this\nlight?\" asked he.\n\n\"Hush!\" said the captain; \"it is a fire.\"\n\n\"But you told me the island was uninhabited?\"\n\n\"I said there were no fixed habitations on it, but I said also that it\nserved sometimes as a harbor for smugglers.\"\n\n\"And for pirates?\"\n\n\"And for pirates,\" returned Gaetano, repeating Franz's words. \"It is for\nthat reason I have given orders to pass the island, for, as you see, the\nfire is behind us.\"\n\n\"But this fire?\" continued Franz. \"It seems to me rather reassuring than\notherwise; men who did not wish to be seen would not light a fire.\"\n\n\"Oh, that goes for nothing,\" said Gaetano. \"If you can guess the\nposition of the island in the darkness, you will see that the fire\ncannot be seen from the side or from Pianosa, but only from the sea.\"\n\n\"You think, then, this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant\nneighbors?\"\n\n\"That is what we must find out,\" returned Gaetano, fixing his eyes on\nthis terrestrial star.\n\n\"How can you find out?\"\n\n\"You shall see.\" Gaetano consulted with his companions, and after five\nminutes' discussion a manoeuvre was executed which caused the vessel to\ntack about, they returned the way they had come, and in a few minutes\nthe fire disappeared, hidden by an elevation of the land. The pilot\nagain changed the course of the boat, which rapidly approached the\nisland, and was soon within fifty paces of it. Gaetano lowered the sail,\nand the boat came to rest. All this was done in silence, and from the\nmoment that their course was changed not a word was spoken.\n\nGaetano, who had proposed the expedition, had taken all the\nresponsibility on himself; the four sailors fixed their eyes on him,\nwhile they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row\naway, which, thanks to the darkness, would not be difficult. As for\nFranz, he examined his arms with the utmost coolness; he had two\ndouble-barrelled guns and a rifle; he loaded them, looked at the\npriming, and waited quietly. During this time the captain had thrown off\nhis vest and shirt, and secured his trousers round his waist; his feet\nwere naked, so he had no shoes and stockings to take off; after these\npreparations he placed his finger on his lips, and lowering himself\nnoiselessly into the sea, swam towards the shore with such precaution\nthat it was impossible to hear the slightest sound; he could only\nbe traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake. This track soon\ndisappeared; it was evident that he had touched the shore. Every one on\nboard remained motionless for half an hour, when the same luminous track\nwas again observed, and the swimmer was soon on board. \"Well?\" exclaimed\nFranz and the sailors in unison.\n\n\"They are Spanish smugglers,\" said he; \"they have with them two Corsican\nbandits.\"\n\n\"And what are these Corsican bandits doing here with Spanish smugglers?\"\n\n\"Alas,\" returned the captain with an accent of the most profound pity,\n\"we ought always to help one another. Very often the bandits are hard\npressed by gendarmes or carbineers; well, they see a vessel, and good\nfellows like us on board, they come and demand hospitality of us; you\ncan't refuse help to a poor hunted devil; we receive them, and for\ngreater security we stand out to sea. This costs us nothing, and saves\nthe life, or at least the liberty, of a fellow-creature, who on the\nfirst occasion returns the service by pointing out some safe spot where\nwe can land our goods without interruption.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Franz, \"then you are a smuggler occasionally, Gaetano?\"\n\n\"Your excellency, we must live somehow,\" returned the other, smiling\nimpenetrably.\n\n\"Then you know the men who are now on Monte Cristo?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, we sailors are like freemasons, and recognize each other by\nsigns.\"\n\n\"And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all; smugglers are not thieves.\"\n\n\"But these two Corsican bandits?\" said Franz, calculating the chances of\nperil.\n\n\"It is not their fault that they are bandits, but that of the\nauthorities.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Because they are pursued for having made a stiff, as if it was not in a\nCorsican's nature to revenge himself.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by having made a stiff?--having assassinated a man?\"\nsaid Franz, continuing his investigation.\n\n\"I mean that they have killed an enemy, which is a very different\nthing,\" returned the captain.\n\n\"Well,\" said the young man, \"let us demand hospitality of these\nsmugglers and bandits. Do you think they will grant it?\"\n\n\"Without doubt.\"\n\n\"How many are they?\"\n\n\"Four, and the two bandits make six.\"\n\n\"Just our number, so that if they prove troublesome, we shall be able to\nhold them in check; so, for the last time, steer to Monte Cristo.\"\n\n\"Yes, but your excellency will permit us to take all due precautions.\"\n\n\"By all means, be as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses; I do more\nthan permit, I exhort you.\"\n\n\"Silence, then!\" said Gaetano.\n\nEvery one obeyed. For a man who, like Franz, viewed his position in\nits true light, it was a grave one. He was alone in the darkness with\nsailors whom he did not know, and who had no reason to be devoted to\nhim; who knew that he had several thousand francs in his belt, and who\nhad often examined his weapons,--which were very beautiful,--if not with\nenvy, at least with curiosity. On the other hand, he was about to land,\nwithout any other escort than these men, on an island which had, indeed,\na very religious name, but which did not seem to Franz likely to afford\nhim much hospitality, thanks to the smugglers and bandits. The history\nof the scuttled vessels, which had appeared improbable during the day,\nseemed very probable at night; placed as he was between two possible\nsources of danger, he kept his eye on the crew, and his gun in his\nhand. The sailors had again hoisted sail, and the vessel was once more\ncleaving the waves. Through the darkness Franz, whose eyes were now more\naccustomed to it, could see the looming shore along which the boat was\nsailing, and then, as they rounded a rocky point, he saw the fire more\nbrilliant than ever, and about it five or six persons seated. The blaze\nillumined the sea for a hundred paces around. Gaetano skirted the light,\ncarefully keeping the boat in the shadow; then, when they were opposite\nthe fire, he steered to the centre of the circle, singing a fishing\nsong, of which his companions sung the chorus. At the first words of\nthe song the men seated round the fire arose and approached the\nlanding-place, their eyes fixed on the boat, evidently seeking to\nknow who the new-comers were and what were their intentions. They soon\nappeared satisfied and returned (with the exception of one, who\nremained at the shore) to their fire, at which the carcass of a goat was\nroasting. When the boat was within twenty paces of the shore, the man on\nthe beach, who carried a carbine, presented arms after the manner of\na sentinel, and cried, \"Who comes there?\" in Sardinian. Franz coolly\ncocked both barrels. Gaetano then exchanged a few words with this man\nwhich the traveller did not understand, but which evidently concerned\nhim. \"Will your excellency give your name, or remain incognito?\" asked\nthe captain.\n\n\"My name must rest unknown,--merely say I am a Frenchman travelling for\npleasure.\" As soon as Gaetano had transmitted this answer, the sentinel\ngave an order to one of the men seated round the fire, who rose and\ndisappeared among the rocks. Not a word was spoken, every one seemed\noccupied, Franz with his disembarkment, the sailors with their sails,\nthe smugglers with their goat; but in the midst of all this carelessness\nit was evident that they mutually observed each other. The man who had\ndisappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by which he\nhad left; he made a sign with his head to the sentinel, who, turning\nto the boat, said, \"S'accommodi.\" The Italian s'accommodi is\nuntranslatable; it means at once, \"Come, enter, you are welcome; make\nyourself at home; you are the master.\" It is like that Turkish phrase\nof Moliere's that so astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of\nthings implied in its utterance. The sailors did not wait for a second\ninvitation; four strokes of the oar brought them to land; Gaetano sprang\nto shore, exchanged a few words with the sentinel, then his comrades\ndisembarked, and lastly came Franz. One of his guns was swung over his\nshoulder, Gaetano had the other, and a sailor held his rifle; his\ndress, half artist, half dandy, did not excite any suspicion, and,\nconsequently, no disquietude. The boat was moored to the shore, and they\nadvanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac; but, doubtless,\nthe spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of\nsentinel, for he cried out, \"Not that way, if you please.\"\n\nGaetano faltered an excuse, and advanced to the opposite side, while\ntwo sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way.\nThey advanced about thirty paces, and then stopped at a small esplanade\nsurrounded with rocks, in which seats had been cut, not unlike\nsentry-boxes. Around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks\nand thick bushes of myrtles. Franz lowered a torch, and saw by the mass\nof cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover\nthis retreat, which was, doubtless, one of the halting-places of the\nwandering visitors of Monte Cristo. As for his suspicions, once on\nterra firma, once that he had seen the indifferent, if not friendly,\nappearance of his hosts, his anxiety had quite disappeared, or rather,\nat sight of the goat, had turned to appetite. He mentioned this to\nGaetano, who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare\na supper when they had in their boat, bread, wine, half a dozen\npartridges, and a good fire to roast them by. \"Besides,\" added he, \"if\nthe smell of their roast meat tempts you, I will go and offer them two\nof our birds for a slice.\"\n\n\"You are a born diplomat,\" returned Franz; \"go and try.\"\n\nMeanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which\nthey made a fire. Franz waited impatiently, inhaling the aroma of the\nroasted meat, when the captain returned with a mysterious air.\n\n\"Well,\" said Franz, \"anything new?--do they refuse?\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" returned Gaetano, \"the chief, who was told you were a\nyoung Frenchman, invites you to sup with him.\"\n\n\"Well,\" observed Franz, \"this chief is very polite, and I see no\nobjection--the more so as I bring my share of the supper.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is not that; he has plenty, and to spare, for supper; but he\nmakes one condition, and rather a peculiar one, before he will receive\nyou at his house.\"\n\n\"His house? Has he built one here, then?\"\n\n\"No; but he has a very comfortable one all the same, so they say.\"\n\n\"You know this chief, then?\"\n\n\"I have heard talk of him.\"\n\n\"Favorably or otherwise?\"\n\n\"Both.\"\n\n\"The deuce!--and what is this condition?\"\n\n\"That you are blindfolded, and do not take off the bandage until he\nhimself bids you.\" Franz looked at Gaetano, to see, if possible, what he\nthought of this proposal. \"Ah,\" replied he, guessing Franz's thought, \"I\nknow this is a serious matter.\"\n\n\"What should you do in my place?\"\n\n\"I, who have nothing to lose,--I should go.\"\n\n\"You would accept?\"\n\n\"Yes, were it only out of curiosity.\"\n\n\"There is something very peculiar about this chief, then?\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said Gaetano, lowering his voice, \"I do not know if what they\nsay is true\"--he stopped to see if any one was near.\n\n\"What do they say?\"\n\n\"That this chief inhabits a cavern to which the Pitti Palace is\nnothing.\"\n\n\"What nonsense!\" said Franz, reseating himself.\n\n\"It is no nonsense; it is quite true. Cama, the pilot of the Saint\nFerdinand, went in once, and he came back amazed, vowing that such\ntreasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" observed Franz, \"that with such stories you make me think\nof Ali Baba's enchanted cavern?\"\n\n\"I tell you what I have been told.\"\n\n\"Then you advise me to accept?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't say that; your excellency will do as you please; I should\nbe sorry to advise you in the matter.\" Franz pondered the matter for a\nfew moments, concluded that a man so rich could not have any intention\nof plundering him of what little he had, and seeing only the prospect\nof a good supper, accepted. Gaetano departed with the reply. Franz was\nprudent, and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host.\nHe turned towards the sailor, who, during this dialogue, had sat gravely\nplucking the partridges with the air of a man proud of his office,\nand asked him how these men had landed, as no vessel of any kind was\nvisible.\n\n\"Never mind that,\" returned the sailor, \"I know their vessel.\"\n\n\"Is it a very beautiful vessel?\"\n\n\"I would not wish for a better to sail round the world.\"\n\n\"Of what burden is she?\"\n\n\"About a hundred tons; but she is built to stand any weather. She is\nwhat the English call a yacht.\"\n\n\"Where was she built?\"\n\n\"I know not; but my own opinion is she is a Genoese.\"\n\n\"And how did a leader of smugglers,\" continued Franz, \"venture to build\na vessel designed for such a purpose at Genoa?\"\n\n\"I did not say that the owner was a smuggler,\" replied the sailor.\n\n\"No; but Gaetano did, I thought.\"\n\n\"Gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance, he had not then\nspoken to any one.\"\n\n\"And if this person be not a smuggler, who is he?\"\n\n\"A wealthy signor, who travels for his pleasure.\"\n\n\"Come,\" thought Franz, \"he is still more mysterious, since the two\naccounts do not agree.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\"\n\n\"If you ask him he says Sinbad the Sailor; but I doubt if it be his real\nname.\"\n\n\"Sinbad the Sailor?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And where does he reside?\"\n\n\"On the sea.\"\n\n\"What country does he come from?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen him?\"\n\n\"Sometimes.\"\n\n\"What sort of a man is he?\"\n\n\"Your excellency will judge for yourself.\"\n\n\"Where will he receive me?\"\n\n\"No doubt in the subterranean palace Gaetano told you of.\"\n\n\"Have you never had the curiosity, when you have landed and found this\nisland deserted, to seek for this enchanted palace?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, more than once, but always in vain; we examined the grotto all\nover, but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening; they\nsay that the door is not opened by a key, but a magic word.\"\n\n\"Decidedly,\" muttered Franz, \"this is an Arabian Nights' adventure.\"\n\n\"His excellency waits for you,\" said a voice, which he recognized as\nthat of the sentinel. He was accompanied by two of the yacht's crew.\nFranz drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and presented it to the man\nwho had spoken to him. Without uttering a word, they bandaged his eyes\nwith a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some\nindiscretion. Afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make\nthe least attempt to raise the bandage. He promised. Then his two guides\ntook his arms, and he went on, guided by them, and preceded by the\nsentinel. After going about thirty paces, he smelt the appetizing odor\nof the kid that was roasting, and knew thus that he was passing the\nbivouac; they then led him on about fifty paces farther, evidently\nadvancing towards that part of the shore where they would not allow\nGaetano to go--a refusal he could now comprehend. Presently, by a change\nin the atmosphere, he knew that they were entering a cave; after going\non for a few seconds more he heard a crackling, and it seemed to him as\nthough the atmosphere again changed, and became balmy and perfumed. At\nlength his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet, and his guides let\ngo their hold of him. There was a moment's silence, and then a voice, in\nexcellent French, although, with a foreign accent, said, \"Welcome, sir.\nI beg you will remove your bandage.\" It may be supposed, then, Franz\ndid not wait for a repetition of this permission, but took off\nthe handkerchief, and found himself in the presence of a man from\nthirty-eight to forty years of age, dressed in a Tunisian costume--that\nis to say, a red cap with a long blue silk tassel, a vest of black cloth\nembroidered with gold, pantaloons of deep red, large and full gaiters\nof the same color, embroidered with gold like the vest, and yellow\nslippers; he had a splendid cashmere round his waist, and a small\nsharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle. Although of a\npaleness that was almost livid, this man had a remarkably handsome face;\nhis eyes were penetrating and sparkling; his nose, quite straight, and\nprojecting direct from the brow, was of the pure Greek type, while\nhis teeth, as white as pearls, were set off to admiration by the black\nmustache that encircled them.\n\nHis pallor was so peculiar, that it seemed to pertain to one who had\nbeen long entombed, and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow\nand hue of life. He was not particularly tall, but extremely well made,\nand, like the men of the south, had small hands and feet. But what\nastonished Franz, who had treated Gaetano's description as a fable,\nwas the splendor of the apartment in which he found himself. The entire\nchamber was lined with crimson brocade, worked with flowers of gold. In\na recess was a kind of divan, surmounted with a stand of Arabian swords\nin silver scabbards, and the handles resplendent with gems; from the\nceiling hung a lamp of Venetian glass, of beautiful shape and color,\nwhile the feet rested on a Turkey carpet, in which they sunk to the\ninstep; tapestry hung before the door by which Franz had entered, and\nalso in front of another door, leading into a second apartment which\nseemed to be brilliantly illuminated. The host gave Franz time to\nrecover from his surprise, and, moreover, returned look for look, not\neven taking his eyes off him. \"Sir,\" he said, after a pause, \"a thousand\nexcuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither; but as,\nduring the greater portion of the year, this island is deserted, if the\nsecret of this abode were discovered. I should doubtless, find on my\nreturn my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder, which would\nbe exceedingly annoying, not for the loss it occasioned me, but because\nI should not have the certainty I now possess of separating myself from\nall the rest of mankind at pleasure. Let me now endeavor to make you\nforget this temporary unpleasantness, and offer you what no doubt you\ndid not expect to find here--that is to say, a tolerable supper and\npretty comfortable beds.\"\n\n\"Ma foi, my dear sir,\" replied Franz, \"make no apologies. I have\nalways observed that they bandage people's eyes who penetrate enchanted\npalaces, for instance, those of Raoul in the 'Huguenots,' and really\nI have nothing to complain of, for what I see makes me think of the\nwonders of the 'Arabian Nights.'\"\n\n\"Alas, I may say with Lucullus, if I could have anticipated the honor of\nyour visit, I would have prepared for it. But such as is my hermitage,\nit is at your disposal; such as is my supper, it is yours to share, if\nyou will. Ali, is the supper ready?\" At this moment the tapestry moved\naside, and a Nubian, black as ebony, and dressed in a plain white tunic,\nmade a sign to his master that all was prepared in the dining-room.\n\"Now,\" said the unknown to Franz, \"I do not know if you are of my\nopinion, but I think nothing is more annoying than to remain two or\nthree hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to\naddress one another. Pray observe, that I too much respect the laws of\nhospitality to ask your name or title. I only request you to give me one\nby which I may have the pleasure of addressing you. As for myself,\nthat I may put you at your ease, I tell you that I am generally called\n'Sinbad the Sailor.'\"\n\n\"And I,\" replied Franz, \"will tell you, as I only require his wonderful\nlamp to make me precisely like Aladdin, that I see no reason why at this\nmoment I should not be called Aladdin. That will keep us from going away\nfrom the East whither I am tempted to think I have been conveyed by some\ngood genius.\"\n\n\"Well, then, Signor Aladdin,\" replied the singular amphitryon, \"you\nheard our repast announced, will you now take the trouble to enter the\ndining-room, your humble servant going first to show the way?\" At these\nwords, moving aside the tapestry, Sinbad preceded his guest. Franz\nnow looked upon another scene of enchantment; the table was splendidly\ncovered, and once convinced of this important point he cast his eyes\naround him. The dining-room was scarcely less striking than the room he\nhad just left; it was entirely of marble, with antique bas-reliefs of\npriceless value; and at the four corners of this apartment, which was\noblong, were four magnificent statues, having baskets in their hands.\nThese baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit; there were\nSicily pine-apples, pomegranates from Malaga, oranges from the Balearic\nIsles, peaches from France, and dates from Tunis. The supper consisted\nof a roast pheasant garnished with Corsican blackbirds; a boar's ham\nwith jelly, a quarter of a kid with tartar sauce, a glorious turbot,\nand a gigantic lobster. Between these large dishes were smaller ones\ncontaining various dainties. The dishes were of silver, and the plates\nof Japanese china.\n\nFranz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a\ndream. Ali alone was present to wait at table, and acquitted himself\nso admirably, that the guest complimented his host thereupon. \"Yes,\"\nreplied he, while he did the honors of the supper with much ease and\ngrace--\"yes, he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me, and does all\nhe can to prove it. He remembers that I saved his life, and as he has a\nregard for his head, he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept\nit on his shoulders.\" Ali approached his master, took his hand, and\nkissed it.\n\n\"Would it be impertinent, Signor Sinbad,\" said Franz, \"to ask you the\nparticulars of this kindness?\"\n\n\"Oh, they are simple enough,\" replied the host. \"It seems the fellow\nhad been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the Bey of Tunis than\netiquette permits to one of his color, and he was condemned by the bey\nto have his tongue cut out, and his hand and head cut off; the tongue\nthe first day, the hand the second, and the head the third. I always had\na desire to have a mute in my service, so learning the day his tongue\nwas cut out, I went to the bey, and proposed to give him for Ali a\nsplendid double-barreled gun which I knew he was very desirous of\nhaving. He hesitated a moment, he was so very desirous to complete the\npoor devil's punishment. But when I added to the gun an English cutlass\nwith which I had shivered his highness's yataghan to pieces, the bey\nyielded, and agreed to forgive the hand and head, but on condition that\nthe poor fellow never again set foot in Tunis. This was a useless clause\nin the bargain, for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the\nshores of Africa, he runs down below, and can only be induced to appear\nagain when we are out of sight of that quarter of the globe.\"\n\nFranz remained a moment silent and pensive, hardly knowing what to think\nof the half-kindness, half-cruelty, with which his host related the\nbrief narrative. \"And like the celebrated sailor whose name you have\nassumed,\" he said, by way of changing the conversation, \"you pass your\nlife in travelling?\"\n\n\"Yes. I made a vow at a time when I little thought I should ever be able\nto accomplish it,\" said the unknown with a singular smile; \"and I made\nsome others also which I hope I may fulfil in due season.\" Although\nSinbad pronounced these words with much calmness, his eyes gave forth\ngleams of extraordinary ferocity.\n\n\"You have suffered a great deal, sir?\" said Franz inquiringly.\n\nSinbad started and looked fixedly at him, as he replied, \"What makes you\nsuppose so?\"\n\n\"Everything,\" answered Franz,--\"your voice, your look, your pallid\ncomplexion, and even the life you lead.\"\n\n\"I?--I live the happiest life possible, the real life of a pasha. I am\nking of all creation. I am pleased with one place, and stay there; I get\ntired of it, and leave it; I am free as a bird and have wings like\none; my attendants obey my slightest wish. Sometimes I amuse myself by\ndelivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law. Then I\nhave my mode of dispensing justice, silent and sure, without respite or\nappeal, which condemns or pardons, and which no one sees. Ah, if you had\ntasted my life, you would not desire any other, and would never return\nto the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there.\"\n\n\"Revenge, for instance!\" observed Franz.\n\nThe unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate\ninto the depth of the heart and thoughts. \"And why revenge?\" he asked.\n\n\"Because,\" replied Franz, \"you seem to me like a man who, persecuted by\nsociety, has a fearful account to settle with it.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" responded Sinbad, laughing with his singular laugh which displayed\nhis white and sharp teeth. \"You have not guessed rightly. Such as you\nsee me I am, a sort of philosopher, and one day perhaps I shall go to\nParis to rival Monsieur Appert, and the little man in the blue cloak.\"\n\n\"And will that be the first time you ever took that journey?\"\n\n\"Yes; it will. I must seem to you by no means curious, but I assure you\nthat it is not my fault I have delayed it so long--it will happen one\nday or the other.\"\n\n\"And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?\"\n\n\"I do not know; it depends on circumstances which depend on certain\narrangements.\"\n\n\"I should like to be there at the time you come, and I will endeavor\nto repay you, as far as lies in my power, for your liberal hospitality\ndisplayed to me at Monte Cristo.\"\n\n\"I should avail myself of your offer with pleasure,\" replied the host,\n\"but, unfortunately, if I go there, it will be, in all probability,\nincognito.\"\n\nThe supper appeared to have been supplied solely for Franz, for the\nunknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to\nwhich his guest did ample justice. Then Ali brought on the dessert, or\nrather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on\nthe table. Between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with\na silver cover. The care with which Ali placed this cup on the table\nroused Franz's curiosity. He raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish\npaste, something like preserved angelica, but which was perfectly\nunknown to him. He replaced the lid, as ignorant of what the cup\ncontained as he was before he had looked at it, and then casting his\neyes towards his host he saw him smile at his disappointment. \"You\ncannot guess,\" said he, \"what there is in that small vase, can you?\"\n\n\"No, I really cannot.\"\n\n\"Well, then, that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia which\nHebe served at the table of Jupiter.\"\n\n\"But,\" replied Franz, \"this ambrosia, no doubt, in passing through\nmortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human name;\nin vulgar phrase, what may you term this composition, for which, to tell\nthe truth, I do not feel any particular desire?\"\n\n\"Ah, thus it is that our material origin is revealed,\" cried Sinbad; \"we\nfrequently pass so near to happiness without seeing, without regarding\nit, or if we do see and regard it, yet without recognizing it. Are you\na man for the substantials, and is gold your god? taste this, and the\nmines of Peru, Guzerat, and Golconda are opened to you. Are you a man\nof imagination--a poet? taste this, and the boundaries of possibility\ndisappear; the fields of infinite space open to you, you advance free in\nheart, free in mind, into the boundless realms of unfettered revery. Are\nyou ambitious, and do you seek after the greatnesses of the earth? taste\nthis, and in an hour you will be a king, not a king of a petty kingdom\nhidden in some corner of Europe like France, Spain, or England, but king\nof the world, king of the universe, king of creation; without bowing at\nthe feet of Satan, you will be king and master of all the kingdoms of\nthe earth. Is it not tempting what I offer you, and is it not an easy\nthing, since it is only to do thus? look!\" At these words he uncovered\nthe small cup which contained the substance so lauded, took a\nteaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat, raised it to his lips, and swallowed\nit slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent backwards. Franz did\nnot disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat, but when he\nhad finished, he inquired,--\"What, then, is this precious stuff?\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear,\" he replied, \"of the Old Man of the Mountain, who\nattempted to assassinate Philip Augustus?\"\n\n\"Of course I have.\"\n\n\"Well, you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the\nmountain whence he derived his picturesque name. In this valley were\nmagnificent gardens planted by Hassen-ben-Sabah, and in these gardens\nisolated pavilions. Into these pavilions he admitted the elect,\nand there, says Marco Polo, gave them to eat a certain herb, which\ntransported them to Paradise, in the midst of ever-blooming shrubs,\never-ripe fruit, and ever-lovely virgins. What these happy persons took\nfor reality was but a dream; but it was a dream so soft, so voluptuous,\nso enthralling, that they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave\nit to them, and obedient to his orders as to those of a deity, struck\ndown the designated victim, died in torture without a murmur, believing\nthat the death they underwent was but a quick transition to that life of\ndelights of which the holy herb, now before you, had given them a slight\nforetaste.\"\n\n\"Then,\" cried Franz, \"it is hashish! I know that--by name at least.\"\n\n\"That is it precisely, Signor Aladdin; it is hashish--the purest and\nmost unadulterated hashish of Alexandria,--the hashish of Abou-Gor, the\ncelebrated maker, the only man, the man to whom there should be built a\npalace, inscribed with these words, 'A grateful world to the dealer in\nhappiness.'\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Franz, \"I have a very great inclination to judge for\nmyself of the truth or exaggeration of your eulogies.\"\n\n\"Judge for yourself, Signor Aladdin--judge, but do not confine yourself\nto one trial. Like everything else, we must habituate the senses to a\nfresh impression, gentle or violent, sad or joyous. There is a struggle\nin nature against this divine substance,--in nature which is not made\nfor joy and clings to pain. Nature subdued must yield in the combat, the\ndream must succeed to reality, and then the dream reigns supreme, then\nthe dream becomes life, and life becomes the dream. But what changes\noccur! It is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the joys\nof the assumed existence, that you would desire to live no longer, but\nto dream thus forever. When you return to this mundane sphere from\nyour visionary world, you would seem to leave a Neapolitan spring for a\nLapland winter--to quit paradise for earth--heaven for hell! Taste the\nhashish, guest of mine--taste the hashish.\"\n\nFranz's only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous\npreparation, about as much in quantity as his host had eaten, and lift\nit to his mouth. \"Diable!\" he said, after having swallowed the divine\npreserve. \"I do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you\ndescribe, but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say.\"\n\n\"Because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the\nsubstances it flavors. Tell me, the first time you tasted oysters, tea,\nporter, truffles, and sundry other dainties which you now adore, did you\nlike them? Could you comprehend how the Romans stuffed their pheasants\nwith assafoetida, and the Chinese eat swallows' nests? Eh? no! Well, it\nis the same with hashish; only eat for a week, and nothing in the world\nwill seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor, which now appears\nto you flat and distasteful. Let us now go into the adjoining chamber,\nwhich is your apartment, and Ali will bring us coffee and pipes.\" They\nboth arose, and while he who called himself Sinbad--and whom we have\noccasionally named so, that we might, like his guest, have some title by\nwhich to distinguish him--gave some orders to the servant, Franz entered\nstill another apartment. It was simply yet richly furnished. It was\nround, and a large divan completely encircled it. Divan, walls, ceiling,\nfloor, were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the\nrichest carpets; there were heavy-maned lion-skins from Atlas,\nstriped tiger-skins from Bengal; panther-skins from the Cape, spotted\nbeautifully, like those that appeared to Dante; bear-skins from Siberia,\nfox-skins from Norway, and so on; and all these skins were strewn in\nprofusion one on the other, so that it seemed like walking over the most\nmossy turf, or reclining on the most luxurious bed. Both laid themselves\ndown on the divan; chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces\nwere within reach, and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke\nthe same pipe twice. Each of them took one, which Ali lighted and then\nretired to prepare the coffee. There was a moment's silence, during\nwhich Sinbad gave himself up to thoughts that seemed to occupy him\nincessantly, even in the midst of his conversation; and Franz abandoned\nhimself to that mute revery, into which we always sink when smoking\nexcellent tobacco, which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles\nof the mind, and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the\nsoul. Ali brought in the coffee. \"How do you take it?\" inquired the\nunknown; \"in the French or Turkish style, strong or weak, sugar or none,\ncool or boiling? As you please; it is ready in all ways.\"\n\n\"I will take it in the Turkish style,\" replied Franz.\n\n\"And you are right,\" said his host; \"it shows you have a tendency for an\nOriental life. Ah, those Orientals; they are the only men who know how\nto live. As for me,\" he added, with one of those singular smiles which\ndid not escape the young man, \"when I have completed my affairs in\nParis, I shall go and die in the East; and should you wish to see me\nagain, you must seek me at Cairo, Bagdad, or Ispahan.\"\n\n\"Ma foi,\" said Franz, \"it would be the easiest thing in the world; for I\nfeel eagle's wings springing out at my shoulders, and with those wings I\ncould make a tour of the world in four and twenty hours.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, the hashish is beginning its work. Well, unfurl your wings,\nand fly into superhuman regions; fear nothing, there is a watch over\nyou; and if your wings, like those of Icarus, melt before the sun, we\nare here to ease your fall.\" He then said something in Arabic to Ali,\nwho made a sign of obedience and withdrew, but not to any distance. As\nto Franz a strange transformation had taken place in him. All the bodily\nfatigue of the day, all the preoccupation of mind which the events of\nthe evening had brought on, disappeared as they do at the first approach\nof sleep, when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the\ncoming of slumber. His body seemed to acquire an airy lightness, his\nperception brightened in a remarkable manner, his senses seemed to\nredouble their power, the horizon continued to expand; but it was not\nthe gloomy horizon of vague alarms, and which he had seen before he\nslept, but a blue, transparent, unbounded horizon, with all the blue of\nthe ocean, all the spangles of the sun, all the perfumes of the summer\nbreeze; then, in the midst of the songs of his sailors,--songs so clear\nand sonorous, that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes\nbeen taken down,--he saw the Island of Monte Cristo, no longer as a\nthreatening rock in the midst of the waves, but as an oasis in the\ndesert; then, as his boat drew nearer, the songs became louder, for an\nenchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven, as if some Loreley had\ndecreed to attract a soul thither, or Amphion, the enchanter, intended\nthere to build a city.\n\nAt length the boat touched the shore, but without effort, without shock,\nas lips touch lips; and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains\nof most delicious melody. He descended, or rather seemed to descend,\nseveral steps, inhaling the fresh and balmy air, like that which may be\nsupposed to reign around the grotto of Circe, formed from such perfumes\nas set the mind a dreaming, and such fires as burn the very senses; and\nhe saw again all he had seen before his sleep, from Sinbad, his singular\nhost, to Ali, the mute attendant; then all seemed to fade away and\nbecome confused before his eyes, like the last shadows of the magic\nlantern before it is extinguished, and he was again in the chamber of\nstatues, lighted only by one of those pale and antique lamps which watch\nin the dead of the night over the sleep of pleasure. They were the\nsame statues, rich in form, in attraction, and poesy, with eyes of\nfascination, smiles of love, and bright and flowing hair. They were\nPhryne, Cleopatra, Messalina, those three celebrated courtesans. Then\namong them glided like a pure ray, like a Christian angel in the midst\nof Olympus, one of those chaste figures, those calm shadows, those\nsoft visions, which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble\nwantons. Then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love,\nand approached the couch on which he was reposing, their feet hidden in\ntheir long white tunics, their throats bare, hair flowing like waves,\nand assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist, but which saints\nwithstood, and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the\nserpent charms the bird; and then he gave way before looks that held him\nin a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss.\nIt seemed to Franz that he closed his eyes, and in a last look about him\nsaw the vision of modesty completely veiled; and then followed a dream\nof passion like that promised by the Prophet to the elect. Lips of stone\nturned to flame, breasts of ice became like heated lava, so that to\nFranz, yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug, love was a\nsorrow and voluptuousness a torture, as burning mouths were pressed to\nhis thirsty lips, and he was held in cool serpent-like embraces. The\nmore he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses\nyielded to its thrall, and at length, weary of a struggle that taxed his\nvery soul, he gave way and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath\nthe kisses of these marble goddesses, and the enchantment of his\nmarvellous dream.\n\n\n\nChapter 32. The Waking.\n\nWhen Franz returned to himself, he seemed still to be in a dream. He\nthought himself in a sepulchre, into which a ray of sunlight in pity\nscarcely penetrated. He stretched forth his hand, and touched stone; he\nrose to his seat, and found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of\ndry heather, very soft and odoriferous. The vision had fled; and as if\nthe statues had been but shadows from the tomb, they had vanished at\nhis waking. He advanced several paces towards the point whence the light\ncame, and to all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of\nreality. He found that he was in a grotto, went towards the opening, and\nthrough a kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky. The air and\nwater were shining in the beams of the morning sun; on the shore the\nsailors were sitting, chatting and laughing; and at ten yards from them\nthe boat was at anchor, undulating gracefully on the water. There for\nsome time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow, and\nlistened to the dash of the waves on the beach, that left against the\nrocks a lace of foam as white as silver. He was for some time without\nreflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of\nnature, specially after a fantastic dream; then gradually this view\nof the outer world, so calm, so pure, so grand, reminded him of the\nillusiveness of his vision, and once more awakened memory. He recalled\nhis arrival on the island, his presentation to a smuggler chief,\na subterranean palace full of splendor, an excellent supper, and a\nspoonful of hashish. It seemed, however, even in the very face of open\nday, that at least a year had elapsed since all these things had passed,\nso deep was the impression made in his mind by the dream, and so strong\na hold had it taken of his imagination. Thus every now and then he\nsaw in fancy amid the sailors, seated on a rock, or undulating in the\nvessel, one of the shadows which had shared his dream with looks and\nkisses. Otherwise, his head was perfectly clear, and his body refreshed;\nhe was free from the slightest headache; on the contrary, he felt a\ncertain degree of lightness, a faculty for absorbing the pure air, and\nenjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever.\n\nHe went gayly up to the sailors, who rose as soon as they perceived him;\nand the patron, accosting him, said, \"The Signor Sinbad has left his\ncompliments for your excellency, and desires us to express the regret he\nfeels at not being able to take his leave in person; but he trusts you\nwill excuse him, as very important business calls him to Malaga.\"\n\n\"So, then, Gaetano,\" said Franz, \"this is, then, all reality; there\nexists a man who has received me in this island, entertained me right\nroyally, and his departed while I was asleep?\"\n\n\"He exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all\nher sails spread; and if you will use your glass, you will, in all\nprobability, recognize your host in the midst of his crew.\" So saying,\nGaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was making sail\ntowards the southern point of Corsica. Franz adjusted his telescope, and\ndirected it towards the yacht. Gaetano was not mistaken. At the stern\nthe mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the shore, and\nholding a spy-glass in his hand. He was attired as he had been on the\nprevious evening, and waved his pocket-handkerchief to his guest in\ntoken of adieu. Franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as\nan exchange of signals. After a second, a slight cloud of smoke was seen\nat the stern of the vessel, which rose gracefully as it expanded in\nthe air, and then Franz heard a slight report. \"There, do you hear?\"\nobserved Gaetano; \"he is bidding you adieu.\" The young man took his\ncarbine and fired it in the air, but without any idea that the noise\ncould be heard at the distance which separated the yacht from the shore.\n\n\"What are your excellency's orders?\" inquired Gaetano.\n\n\"In the first place, light me a torch.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, I understand,\" replied the patron, \"to find the entrance to\nthe enchanted apartment. With much pleasure, your excellency, if it\nwould amuse you; and I will get you the torch you ask for. But I too\nhave had the idea you have, and two or three times the same fancy has\ncome over me; but I have always given it up. Giovanni, light a torch,\"\nhe added, \"and give it to his excellency.\"\n\nGiovanni obeyed. Franz took the lamp, and entered the subterranean\ngrotto, followed by Gaetano. He recognized the place where he had awaked\nby the bed of heather that was there; but it was in vain that he carried\nhis torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto. He saw nothing,\nunless that, by traces of smoke, others had before him attempted the\nsame thing, and, like him, in vain. Yet he did not leave a foot of this\ngranite wall, as impenetrable as futurity, without strict scrutiny; he\ndid not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword\ninto it, or a projecting point on which he did not lean and press in\nthe hopes it would give way. All was vain; and he lost two hours in his\nattempts, which were at last utterly useless. At the end of this time he\ngave up his search, and Gaetano smiled.\n\nWhen Franz appeared again on the shore, the yacht only seemed like a\nsmall white speck on the horizon. He looked again through his glass, but\neven then he could not distinguish anything. Gaetano reminded him that\nhe had come for the purpose of shooting goats, which he had utterly\nforgotten. He took his fowling-piece, and began to hunt over the island\nwith the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty, rather than enjoying a\npleasure; and at the end of a quarter of an hour he had killed a goat\nand two kids. These animals, though wild and agile as chamois, were too\nmuch like domestic goats, and Franz could not consider them as game.\nMoreover, other ideas, much more enthralling, occupied his mind. Since,\nthe evening before, he had really been the hero of one of the tales of\nthe \"Thousand and One Nights,\" and he was irresistibly attracted towards\nthe grotto. Then, in spite of the failure of his first search, he began\na second, after having told Gaetano to roast one of the two kids. The\nsecond visit was a long one, and when he returned the kid was roasted\nand the repast ready. Franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the\nprevious evening when his mysterious host had invited him to supper; and\nhe saw the little yacht, now like a sea-gull on the wave, continuing her\nflight towards Corsica. \"Why,\" he remarked to Gaetano, \"you told me that\nSignor Sinbad was going to Malaga, while it seems he is in the direction\nof Porto-Vecchio.\"\n\n\"Don't you remember,\" said the patron, \"I told you that among the crew\nthere were two Corsican brigands?\"\n\n\"True; and he is going to land them,\" added Franz.\n\n\"Precisely so,\" replied Gaetano. \"Ah, he is one who fears neither God\nnor Satan, they say, and would at any time run fifty leagues out of his\ncourse to do a poor devil a service.\"\n\n\"But such services as these might involve him with the authorities\nof the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy,\" said\nFranz.\n\n\"And what cares he for that,\" replied Gaetano with a laugh, \"or any\nauthorities? He smiles at them. Let them try to pursue him! Why, in the\nfirst place, his yacht is not a ship, but a bird, and he would beat any\nfrigate three knots in every nine; and if he were to throw himself on\nthe coast, why, is he not certain of finding friends everywhere?\"\n\nIt was perfectly clear that the Signor Sinbad, Franz's host, had the\nhonor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits\nalong the whole coast of the Mediterranean, and so enjoyed exceptional\nprivileges. As to Franz, he had no longer any inducement to remain\nat Monte Cristo. He had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the\ngrotto; he consequently despatched his breakfast, and, his boat being\nready, he hastened on board, and they were soon under way. At the\nmoment the boat began her course they lost sight of the yacht, as it\ndisappeared in the gulf of Porto-Vecchio. With it was effaced the\nlast trace of the preceding night; and then supper, Sinbad, hashish,\nstatues,--all became a dream for Franz. The boat sailed on all day and\nall night, and next morning, when the sun rose, they had lost sight of\nMonte Cristo. When Franz had once again set foot on shore, he forgot,\nfor the moment at least, the events which had just passed, while he\nfinished his affairs of pleasure at Florence, and then thought of\nnothing but how he should rejoin his companion, who was awaiting him at\nRome.\n\nHe set out, and on the Saturday evening reached the Eternal City by the\nmail-coach. An apartment, as we have said, had been retained beforehand,\nand thus he had but to go to Signor Pastrini's hotel. But this was not\nso easy a matter, for the streets were thronged with people, and Rome\nwas already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes\nall great events; and at Rome there are four great events in every\nyear,--the Carnival, Holy Week, Corpus Christi, and the Feast of St.\nPeter. All the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull\napathy, between life and death, which renders it similar to a kind of\nstation between this world and the next--a sublime spot, a resting-place\nfull of poetry and character, and at which Franz had already halted five\nor six times, and at each time found it more marvellous and striking. At\nlast he made his way through the mob, which was continually increasing\nand getting more and more turbulent, and reached the hotel. On his\nfirst inquiry he was told, with the impertinence peculiar to hired\nhackney-coachmen and inn-keepers with their houses full, that there was\nno room for him at the Hotel de Londres. Then he sent his card to Signor\nPastrini, and asked for Albert de Morcerf. This plan succeeded; and\nSignor Pastrini himself ran to him, excusing himself for having made his\nexcellency wait, scolding the waiters, taking the candlestick from the\nporter, who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead\nhim to Albert, when Morcerf himself appeared.\n\nThe apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor. The two rooms\nlooked onto the street--a fact which Signor Pastrini commented upon as\nan inappreciable advantage. The rest of the floor was hired by a very\nrich gentleman who was supposed to be a Sicilian or Maltese; but the\nhost was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller\nbelonged. \"Very good, signor Pastrini,\" said Franz; \"but we must have\nsome supper instantly, and a carriage for tomorrow and the following\ndays.\"\n\n\"As to supper,\" replied the landlord, \"you shall be served immediately;\nbut as for the carriage\"--\n\n\"What as to the carriage?\" exclaimed Albert. \"Come, come, Signor\nPastrini, no joking; we must have a carriage.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied the host, \"we will do all in our power to procure you\none--this is all I can say.\"\n\n\"And when shall we know?\" inquired Franz.\n\n\"To-morrow morning,\" answered the inn-keeper.\n\n\"Oh, the deuce! then we shall pay the more, that's all, I see plainly\nenough. At Drake's or Aaron's one pays twenty-five lire for common days,\nand thirty or thirty-five lire a day more for Sundays and feast days;\nadd five lire a day more for extras, that will make forty, and there's\nan end of it.\"\n\n\"I am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a\ncarriage.\"\n\n\"Then they must put horses to mine. It is a little worse for the\njourney, but that's no matter.\"\n\n\"There are no horses.\" Albert looked at Franz like a man who hears a\nreply he does not understand.\n\n\"Do you understand that, my dear Franz--no horses?\" he said, \"but can't\nwe have post-horses?\"\n\n\"They have been all hired this fortnight, and there are none left but\nthose absolutely requisite for posting.\"\n\n\"What are we to say to this?\" asked Franz.\n\n\"I say, that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension, I am\naccustomed not to dwell on that thing, but to pass to another. Is supper\nready, Signor Pastrini?\"\n\n\"Yes, your excellency.\"\n\n\"Well, then, let us sup.\"\n\n\"But the carriage and horses?\" said Franz.\n\n\"Be easy, my dear boy; they will come in due season; it is only a\nquestion of how much shall be charged for them.\" Morcerf then, with that\ndelighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a full\npurse or well-lined pocketbook, supped, went to bed, slept soundly, and\ndreamed he was racing all over Rome at Carnival time in a coach with six\nhorses.\n\n\n\nChapter 33. Roman Bandits.\n\nThe next morning Franz woke first, and instantly rang the bell. The\nsound had not yet died away when Signor Pastrini himself entered.\n\n\"Well, excellency,\" said the landlord triumphantly, and without waiting\nfor Franz to question him, \"I feared yesterday, when I would not promise\nyou anything, that you were too late--there is not a single carriage to\nbe had--that is, for the last three days of the carnival.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Franz, \"for the very three days it is most needed.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" said Albert, entering; \"no carriage to be had?\"\n\n\"Just so,\" returned Franz, \"you have guessed it.\"\n\n\"Well, your Eternal City is a nice sort of place.\"\n\n\"That is to say, excellency,\" replied Pastrini, who was desirous of\nkeeping up the dignity of the capital of the Christian world in the\neyes of his guest, \"that there are no carriages to be had from Sunday\nto Tuesday evening, but from now till Sunday you can have fifty if you\nplease.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is something,\" said Albert; \"to-day is Thursday, and who knows\nwhat may arrive between this and Sunday?\"\n\n\"Ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive,\" replied Franz, \"which\nwill make it still more difficult.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Morcerf, \"let us enjoy the present without gloomy\nforebodings for the future.\"\n\n\"At least we can have a window?\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"In the Corso.\"\n\n\"Ah, a window!\" exclaimed Signor Pastrini,--\"utterly impossible; there\nwas only one left on the fifth floor of the Doria Palace, and that has\nbeen let to a Russian prince for twenty sequins a day.\"\n\nThe two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction.\n\n\"Well,\" said Franz to Albert, \"do you know what is the best thing we can\ndo? It is to pass the Carnival at Venice; there we are sure of obtaining\ngondolas if we cannot have carriages.\"\n\n\"Ah, the devil, no,\" cried Albert; \"I came to Rome to see the Carnival,\nand I will, though I see it on stilts.\"\n\n\"Bravo! an excellent idea. We will disguise ourselves as monster\npulchinellos or shepherds of the Landes, and we shall have complete\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"Do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to Sunday\nmorning?\"\n\n\"Parbleu!\" said Albert, \"do you think we are going to run about on foot\nin the streets of Rome, like lawyer's clerks?\"\n\n\"I hasten to comply with your excellencies' wishes; only, I tell you\nbeforehand, the carriage will cost you six piastres a day.\"\n\n\"And, as I am not a millionaire, like the gentleman in the next\napartments,\" said Franz, \"I warn you, that as I have been four times\nbefore at Rome, I know the prices of all the carriages; we will give you\ntwelve piastres for to-day, tomorrow, and the day after, and then you\nwill make a good profit.\"\n\n\"But, excellency\"--said Pastrini, still striving to gain his point.\n\n\"Now go,\" returned Franz, \"or I shall go myself and bargain with your\naffettatore, who is mine also; he is an old friend of mine, who has\nplundered me pretty well already, and, in the hope of making more out\nof me, he will take a less price than the one I offer you; you will lose\nthe preference, and that will be your fault.\"\n\n\"Do not give yourselves the trouble, excellency,\" returned Signor\nPastrini, with the smile peculiar to the Italian speculator when\nhe confesses defeat; \"I will do all I can, and I hope you will be\nsatisfied.\"\n\n\"And now we understand each other.\"\n\n\"When do you wish the carriage to be here?\"\n\n\"In an hour.\"\n\n\"In an hour it will be at the door.\"\n\nAn hour after the vehicle was at the door; it was a hack conveyance\nwhich was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the\noccasion, but, in spite of its humble exterior, the young men would have\nthought themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of\nthe Carnival. \"Excellency,\" cried the cicerone, seeing Franz approach\nthe window, \"shall I bring the carriage nearer to the palace?\"\n\nAccustomed as Franz was to the Italian phraseology, his first impulse\nwas to look round him, but these words were addressed to him. Franz\nwas the \"excellency,\" the vehicle was the \"carriage,\" and the Hotel de\nLondres was the \"palace.\" The genius for laudation characteristic of the\nrace was in that phrase.\n\nFranz and Albert descended, the carriage approached the palace; their\nexcellencies stretched their legs along the seats; the cicerone sprang\ninto the seat behind. \"Where do your excellencies wish to go?\" asked he.\n\n\"To Saint Peter's first, and then to the Colosseum,\" returned Albert.\nBut Albert did not know that it takes a day to see Saint Peter's, and a\nmonth to study it. The day was passed at Saint Peter's alone. Suddenly\nthe daylight began to fade away; Franz took out his watch--it was\nhalf-past four. They returned to the hotel; at the door Franz ordered\nthe coachman to be ready at eight. He wished to show Albert the\nColosseum by moonlight, as he had shown him Saint Peter's by daylight.\nWhen we show a friend a city one has already visited, we feel the same\npride as when we point out a woman whose lover we have been. He was\nto leave the city by the Porta del Popolo, skirt the outer wall, and\nre-enter by the Porta San Giovanni; thus they would behold the Colosseum\nwithout finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the\nCapitol, the Forum, the Arch of Septimus Severus, the Temple of\nAntoninus and Faustina, and the Via Sacra. They sat down to dinner.\nSignor Pastrini had promised them a banquet; he gave them a tolerable\nrepast. At the end of the dinner he entered in person. Franz thought\nthat he came to hear his dinner praised, and began accordingly, but at\nthe first words he was interrupted. \"Excellency,\" said Pastrini, \"I am\ndelighted to have your approbation, but it was not for that I came.\"\n\n\"Did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage?\" asked Albert,\nlighting his cigar.\n\n\"No; and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any longer;\nat Rome things can or cannot be done; when you are told anything cannot\nbe done, there is an end of it.\"\n\n\"It is much more convenient at Paris,--when anything cannot be done, you\npay double, and it is done directly.\"\n\n\"That is what all the French say,\" returned Signor Pastrini, somewhat\npiqued; \"for that reason, I do not understand why they travel.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Albert, emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his chair\non its hind legs, \"only madmen, or blockheads like us, ever do travel.\nMen in their senses do not quit their hotel in the Rue du Helder, their\nwalk on the Boulevard de Gand, and the Cafe de Paris.\" It is of course\nunderstood that Albert resided in the aforesaid street, appeared every\nday on the fashionable walk, and dined frequently at the only restaurant\nwhere you can really dine, that is, if you are on good terms with\nits frequenters. Signor Pastrini remained silent a short time; it was\nevident that he was musing over this answer, which did not seem\nvery clear. \"But,\" said Franz, in his turn interrupting his host's\nmeditations, \"you had some motive for coming here, may I beg to know\nwhat it was?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; you have ordered your carriage at eight o'clock precisely?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"You intend visiting Il Colosseo.\"\n\n\"You mean the Colosseum?\"\n\n\"It is the same thing. You have told your coachman to leave the city\nby the Porta del Popolo, to drive round the walls, and re-enter by the\nPorta San Giovanni?\"\n\n\"These are my words exactly.\"\n\n\"Well, this route is impossible.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Very dangerous, to say the least.\"\n\n\"Dangerous!--and why?\"\n\n\"On account of the famous Luigi Vampa.\"\n\n\"Pray, who may this famous Luigi Vampa be?\" inquired Albert; \"he may be\nvery famous at Rome, but I can assure you he is quite unknown at Paris.\"\n\n\"What! do you not know him?\"\n\n\"I have not that honor.\"\n\n\"You have never heard his name?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Well, then, he is a bandit, compared to whom the Decesaris and the\nGasparones were mere children.\"\n\n\"Now then, Albert,\" cried Franz, \"here is a bandit for you at last.\"\n\n\"I forewarn you, Signor Pastrini, that I shall not believe one word of\nwhat you are going to tell us; having told you this, begin.\"\n\n\"Once upon a time\"--\n\n\"Well, go on.\" Signor Pastrini turned toward Franz, who seemed to him\nthe more reasonable of the two; we must do him justice,--he had had a\ngreat many Frenchmen in his house, but had never been able to comprehend\nthem. \"Excellency,\" said he gravely, addressing Franz, \"if you look\nupon me as a liar, it is useless for me to say anything; it was for your\ninterest!\"--\n\n\"Albert does not say you are a liar, Signor Pastrini,\" said Franz, \"but\nthat he will not believe what you are going to tell us,--but I will\nbelieve all you say; so proceed.\"\n\n\"But if your excellency doubt my veracity\"--\n\n\"Signor Pastrini,\" returned Franz, \"you are more susceptible than\nCassandra, who was a prophetess, and yet no one believed her; while\nyou, at least, are sure of the credence of half your audience. Come, sit\ndown, and tell us all about this Signor Vampa.\"\n\n\"I had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had\nsince the days of Mastrilla.\"\n\n\"Well, what has this bandit to do with the order I have given the\ncoachman to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo, and to re-enter by\nthe Porta San Giovanni?\"\n\n\"This,\" replied Signor Pastrini, \"that you will go out by one, but I\nvery much doubt your returning by the other.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Franz.\n\n\"Because, after nightfall, you are not safe fifty yards from the gates.\"\n\n\"On your honor is that true?\" cried Albert.\n\n\"Count,\" returned Signor Pastrini, hurt at Albert's repeated doubts\nof the truth of his assertions, \"I do not say this to you, but to your\ncompanion, who knows Rome, and knows, too, that these things are not to\nbe laughed at.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Albert, turning to Franz, \"here is an admirable\nadventure; we will fill our carriage with pistols, blunderbusses, and\ndouble-barrelled guns. Luigi Vampa comes to take us, and we take him--we\nbring him back to Rome, and present him to his holiness the Pope, who\nasks how he can repay so great a service; then we merely ask for a\ncarriage and a pair of horses, and we see the Carnival in the carriage,\nand doubtless the Roman people will crown us at the Capitol, and\nproclaim us, like Curtius and the veiled Horatius, the preservers of\ntheir country.\" Whilst Albert proposed this scheme, Signor Pastrini's\nface assumed an expression impossible to describe.\n\n\"And pray,\" asked Franz, \"where are these pistols, blunderbusses, and\nother deadly weapons with which you intend filling the carriage?\"\n\n\"Not out of my armory, for at Terracina I was plundered even of my\nhunting-knife.\"\n\n\"I shared the same fate at Aquapendente.\"\n\n\"Do you know, Signor Pastrini,\" said Albert, lighting a second cigar at\nthe first, \"that this practice is very convenient for bandits, and that\nit seems to be due to an arrangement of their own.\" Doubtless Signor\nPastrini found this pleasantry compromising, for he only answered half\nthe question, and then he spoke to Franz, as the only one likely to\nlisten with attention. \"Your excellency knows that it is not customary\nto defend yourself when attacked by bandits.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Albert, whose courage revolted at the idea of being\nplundered tamely, \"not make any resistance!\"\n\n\"No, for it would be useless. What could you do against a dozen bandits\nwho spring out of some pit, ruin, or aqueduct, and level their pieces at\nyou?\"\n\n\"Eh, parbleu!--they should kill me.\"\n\nThe inn-keeper turned to Franz with an air that seemed to say, \"Your\nfriend is decidedly mad.\"\n\n\"My dear Albert,\" returned Franz, \"your answer is sublime, and worthy\nthe 'Let him die,' of Corneille, only, when Horace made that answer, the\nsafety of Rome was concerned; but, as for us, it is only to gratify\na whim, and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a\nmotive.\" Albert poured himself out a glass of lacryma Christi, which he\nsipped at intervals, muttering some unintelligible words.\n\n\"Well, Signor Pastrini,\" said Franz, \"now that my companion is quieted,\nand you have seen how peaceful my intentions are, tell me who is this\nLuigi Vampa. Is he a shepherd or a nobleman?--young or old?--tall or\nshort? Describe him, in order that, if we meet him by chance, like\nBugaboo John or Lara, we may recognize him.\"\n\n\"You could not apply to any one better able to inform you on all these\npoints, for I knew him when he was a child, and one day that I fell\ninto his hands, going from Ferentino to Alatri, he, fortunately for me,\nrecollected me, and set me free, not only without ransom, but made me a\npresent of a very splendid watch, and related his history to me.\"\n\n\"Let us see the watch,\" said Albert.\n\nSignor Pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent Breguet, bearing the\nname of its maker, of Parisian manufacture, and a count's coronet.\n\n\"Here it is,\" said he.\n\n\"Peste,\" returned Albert, \"I compliment you on it; I have its\nfellow\"--he took his watch from his waistcoat pocket--\"and it cost me\n3,000 francs.\"\n\n\"Let us hear the history,\" said Franz, motioning Signor Pastrini to seat\nhimself.\n\n\"Your excellencies permit it?\" asked the host.\n\n\"Pardieu!\" cried Albert, \"you are not a preacher, to remain standing!\"\n\nThe host sat down, after having made each of them a respectful bow,\nwhich meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know\nconcerning Luigi Vampa. \"You tell me,\" said Franz, at the moment Signor\nPastrini was about to open his mouth, \"that you knew Luigi Vampa when he\nwas a child--he is still a young man, then?\"\n\n\"A young man? he is only two and twenty;--he will gain himself a\nreputation.\"\n\n\"What do you think of that, Albert?--at two and twenty to be thus\nfamous?\"\n\n\"Yes, and at his age, Alexander, Caesar, and Napoleon, who have all made\nsome noise in the world, were quite behind him.\"\n\n\"So,\" continued Franz, \"the hero of this history is only two and\ntwenty?\"\n\n\"Scarcely so much.\"\n\n\"Is he tall or short?\"\n\n\"Of the middle height--about the same stature as his excellency,\"\nreturned the host, pointing to Albert.\n\n\"Thanks for the comparison,\" said Albert, with a bow.\n\n\"Go on, Signor Pastrini,\" continued Franz, smiling at his friend's\nsusceptibility. \"To what class of society does he belong?\"\n\n\"He was a shepherd-boy attached to the farm of the Count of San-Felice,\nsituated between Palestrina and the lake of Gabri; he was born at\nPampinara, and entered the count's service when he was five years old;\nhis father was also a shepherd, who owned a small flock, and lived by\nthe wool and the milk, which he sold at Rome. When quite a child, the\nlittle Vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity. One day, when he\nwas seven years old, he came to the curate of Palestrina, and asked to\nbe taught to read; it was somewhat difficult, for he could not quit his\nflock; but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet\ntoo poor to pay a priest and which, having no other name, was called\nBorgo; he told Luigi that he might meet him on his return, and that then\nhe would give him a lesson, warning him that it would be short, and that\nhe must profit as much as possible by it. The child accepted joyfully.\nEvery day Luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from\nPalestrina to Borgo; every day, at nine o'clock in the morning, the\npriest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside, and the little\nshepherd took his lesson out of the priest's breviary. At the end of\nthree months he had learned to read. This was not enough--he must now\nlearn to write. The priest had a writing teacher at Rome make three\nalphabets--one large, one middling, and one small; and pointed out to\nhim that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the letters on\na slate, and thus learn to write. The same evening, when the flock was\nsafe at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at Palestrina,\ntook a large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a sort of stylus.\nThe next morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began. At\nthe end of three months he had learned to write. The curate, astonished\nat his quickness and intelligence, made him a present of pens, paper,\nand a penknife. This demanded new effort, but nothing compared to the\nfirst; at the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the\nstylus. The curate related the incident to the Count of San-Felice,\nwho sent for the little shepherd, made him read and write before him,\nordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics, and to give him\ntwo piastres a month. With this, Luigi purchased books and pencils.\nHe applied his imitative powers to everything, and, like Giotto, when\nyoung, he drew on his slate sheep, houses, and trees. Then, with his\nknife, he began to carve all sorts of objects in wood; it was thus that\nPinelli, the famous sculptor, had commenced.\n\n\"A girl of six or seven--that is, a little younger than Vampa--tended\nsheep on a farm near Palestrina; she was an orphan, born at Valmontone\nand was named Teresa. The two children met, sat down near each other,\nlet their flocks mingle together, played, laughed, and conversed\ntogether; in the evening they separated the Count of San-Felice's\nflock from those of Baron Cervetri, and the children returned to their\nrespective farms, promising to meet the next morning. The next day they\nkept their word, and thus they grew up together. Vampa was twelve, and\nTeresa eleven. And yet their natural disposition revealed itself. Beside\nhis taste for the fine arts, which Luigi had carried as far as he\ncould in his solitude, he was given to alternating fits of sadness and\nenthusiasm, was often angry and capricious, and always sarcastic. None\nof the lads of Pampinara, Palestrina, or Valmontone had been able\nto gain any influence over him or even to become his companion. His\ndisposition (always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make\nthem) kept him aloof from all friendships. Teresa alone ruled by a look,\na word, a gesture, this impetuous character, which yielded beneath the\nhand of a woman, and which beneath the hand of a man might have broken,\nbut could never have been bended. Teresa was lively and gay, but\ncoquettish to excess. The two piastres that Luigi received every month\nfrom the Count of San-Felice's steward, and the price of all the little\ncarvings in wood he sold at Rome, were expended in ear-rings, necklaces,\nand gold hairpins. So that, thanks to her friend's generosity, Teresa\nwas the most beautiful and the best-attired peasant near Rome. The two\nchildren grew up together, passing all their time with each other, and\ngiving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different characters.\nThus, in all their dreams, their wishes, and their conversations, Vampa\nsaw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an army, or governor of\na province. Teresa saw herself rich, superbly attired, and attended by a\ntrain of liveried domestics. Then, when they had thus passed the day in\nbuilding castles in the air, they separated their flocks, and descended\nfrom the elevation of their dreams to the reality of their humble\nposition.\n\n\"One day the young shepherd told the count's steward that he had seen a\nwolf come out of the Sabine mountains, and prowl around his flock. The\nsteward gave him a gun; this was what Vampa longed for. This gun had\nan excellent barrel, made at Breschia, and carrying a ball with the\nprecision of an English rifle; but one day the count broke the stock,\nand had then cast the gun aside. This, however, was nothing to a\nsculptor like Vampa; he examined the broken stock, calculated what\nchange it would require to adapt the gun to his shoulder, and made a\nfresh stock, so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or\ntwenty piastres, had he chosen to sell it. But nothing could be farther\nfrom his thoughts. For a long time a gun had been the young man's\ngreatest ambition. In every country where independence has taken the\nplace of liberty, the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a\nweapon, which at once renders him capable of defence or attack, and, by\nrendering its owner terrible, often makes him feared. From this moment\nVampa devoted all his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of\nhis precious weapon; he purchased powder and ball, and everything served\nhim for a mark--the trunk of some old and moss-grown olivetree, that\ngrew on the Sabine mountains; the fox, as he quitted his earth on some\nmarauding excursion; the eagle that soared above their heads: and thus\nhe soon became so expert, that Teresa overcame the terror she at first\nfelt at the report, and amused herself by watching him direct the ball\nwherever he pleased, with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand.\n\n\"One evening a wolf emerged from a pine-wood near which they were\nusually stationed, but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere\nhe was dead. Proud of this exploit, Vampa took the dead animal on his\nshoulders, and carried him to the farm. These exploits had gained Luigi\nconsiderable reputation. The man of superior abilities always finds\nadmirers, go where he will. He was spoken of as the most adroit, the\nstrongest, and the most courageous contadino for ten leagues around; and\nalthough Teresa was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of\nthe Sabines, no one had ever spoken to her of love, because it was known\nthat she was beloved by Vampa. And yet the two young people had never\ndeclared their affection; they had grown together like two trees whose\nroots are mingled, whose branches intertwined, and whose intermingled\nperfume rises to the heavens. Only their wish to see each other had\nbecome a necessity, and they would have preferred death to a day's\nseparation. Teresa was sixteen, and Vampa seventeen. About this time,\na band of brigands that had established itself in the Lepini mountains\nbegan to be much spoken of. The brigands have never been really\nextirpated from the neighborhood of Rome. Sometimes a chief is wanted,\nbut when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band\nof followers.\n\n\"The celebrated Cucumetto, pursued in the Abruzzo, driven out of the\nkingdom of Naples, where he had carried on a regular war, had crossed\nthe Garigliano, like Manfred, and had taken refuge on the banks of the\nAmasine between Sonnino and Juperno. He strove to collect a band of\nfollowers, and followed the footsteps of Decesaris and Gasperone,\nwhom he hoped to surpass. Many young men of Palestrina, Frascati, and\nPampinara had disappeared. Their disappearance at first caused much\ndisquietude; but it was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto. After\nsome time Cucumetto became the object of universal attention; the most\nextraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of\nhim. One day he carried off a young girl, the daughter of a surveyor of\nFrosinone. The bandit's laws are positive; a young girl belongs first\nto him who carries her off, then the rest draw lots for her, and she is\nabandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings. When\ntheir parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom, a messenger is sent\nto negotiate; the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger;\nshould the ransom be refused, the prisoner is irrevocably lost. The\nyoung girl's lover was in Cucumetto's troop; his name was Carlini. When\nshe recognized her lover, the poor girl extended her arms to him, and\nbelieved herself safe; but Carlini felt his heart sink, for he but too\nwell knew the fate that awaited her. However, as he was a favorite with\nCucumetto, as he had for three years faithfully served him, and as he\nhad saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down,\nhe hoped the chief would have pity on him. He took Cucumetto one side,\nwhile the young girl, seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in\nthe centre of the forest, made a veil of her picturesque head-dress to\nhide her face from the lascivious gaze of the bandits. There he told\nthe chief all--his affection for the prisoner, their promises of mutual\nfidelity, and how every night, since he had been near, they had met in\nsome neighboring ruins.\n\n\"It so happened that night that Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a village,\nso that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting. Cucumetto had\nbeen there, however, by accident, as he said, and had carried the maiden\noff. Carlini besought his chief to make an exception in Rita's favor, as\nher father was rich, and could pay a large ransom. Cucumetto seemed to\nyield to his friend's entreaties, and bade him find a shepherd to send\nto Rita's father at Frosinone. Carlini flew joyfully to Rita, telling\nher she was saved, and bidding her write to her father, to inform\nhim what had occurred, and that her ransom was fixed at three hundred\npiastres. Twelve hours' delay was all that was granted--that is, until\nnine the next morning. The instant the letter was written, Carlini\nseized it, and hastened to the plain to find a messenger. He found a\nyoung shepherd watching his flock. The natural messengers of the bandits\nare the shepherds who live between the city and the mountains, between\ncivilized and savage life. The boy undertook the commission, promising\nto be in Frosinone in less than an hour. Carlini returned, anxious to\nsee his mistress, and announce the joyful intelligence. He found the\ntroop in the glade, supping off the provisions exacted as contributions\nfrom the peasants; but his eye vainly sought Rita and Cucumetto among\nthem. He inquired where they were, and was answered by a burst of\nlaughter. A cold perspiration burst from every pore, and his hair stood\non end. He repeated his question. One of the bandits rose, and offered\nhim a glass filled with Orvietto, saying, 'To the health of the brave\nCucumetto and the fair Rita.' At this moment Carlini heard a woman's\ncry; he divined the truth, seized the glass, broke it across the face of\nhim who presented it, and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came.\nAfter a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket; he found Rita\nsenseless in the arms of Cucumetto. At the sight of Carlini, Cucumetto\nrose, a pistol in each hand. The two brigands looked at each other for\na moment--the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips, the other\nwith the pallor of death on his brow. A terrible battle between the\ntwo men seemed imminent; but by degrees Carlini's features relaxed,\nhis hand, which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt, fell to his\nside. Rita lay between them. The moon lighted the group.\n\n\"'Well,' said Cucumetto, 'have you executed your commission?'\n\n\"'Yes, captain,' returned Carlini. 'At nine o'clock to-morrow Rita's\nfather will be here with the money.'--'It is well; in the meantime, we\nwill have a merry night; this young girl is charming, and does credit to\nyour taste. Now, as I am not egotistical, we will return to our comrades\nand draw lots for her.'--'You have determined, then, to abandon her to\nthe common law?' said Carlini.\n\n\"'Why should an exception be made in her favor?'\n\n\"'I thought that my entreaties'--\n\n\"'What right have you, any more than the rest, to ask for an\nexception?'--'It is true.'--'But never mind,' continued Cucumetto,\nlaughing, 'sooner or later your turn will come.' Carlini's teeth\nclinched convulsively.\n\n\"'Now, then,' said Cucumetto, advancing towards the other bandits, 'are\nyou coming?'--'I follow you.'\n\n\"Cucumetto departed, without losing sight of Carlini, for, doubtless,\nhe feared lest he should strike him unawares; but nothing betrayed a\nhostile design on Carlini's part. He was standing, his arms folded, near\nRita, who was still insensible. Cucumetto fancied for a moment the young\nman was about to take her in his arms and fly; but this mattered little\nto him now Rita had been his; and as for the money, three hundred\npiastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he cared\nlittle about it. He continued to follow the path to the glade; but, to\nhis great surprise, Carlini arrived almost as soon as himself. 'Let us\ndraw lots! let us draw lots!' cried all the brigands, when they saw the\nchief.\n\n\"Their demand was fair, and the chief inclined his head in sign of\nacquiescence. The eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand,\nand the red light of the fire made them look like demons. The names of\nall, including Carlini, were placed in a hat, and the youngest of the\nband drew forth a ticket; the ticket bore the name of Diovolaccio. He\nwas the man who had proposed to Carlini the health of their chief, and\nto whom Carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face. A large\nwound, extending from the temple to the mouth, was bleeding profusely.\nDiovalaccio, seeing himself thus favored by fortune, burst into a loud\nlaugh. 'Captain,' said he, 'just now Carlini would not drink your health\nwhen I proposed it to him; propose mine to him, and let us see if he\nwill be more condescending to you than to me.' Every one expected an\nexplosion on Carlini's part; but to their great surprise, he took a\nglass in one hand and a flask in the other, and filling it,--'Your\nhealth, Diavolaccio,' said he calmly, and he drank it off, without his\nhand trembling in the least. Then sitting down by the fire, 'My\nsupper,' said he; 'my expedition has given me an appetite.'--'Well done,\nCarlini!' cried the brigands; 'that is acting like a good fellow;' and\nthey all formed a circle round the fire, while Diavolaccio disappeared.\nCarlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened. The bandits looked on\nwith astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps.\nThey turned round, and saw Diavolaccio bearing the young girl in his\narms. Her head hung back, and her long hair swept the ground. As they\nentered the circle, the bandits could perceive, by the firelight, the\nunearthly pallor of the young girl and of Diavolaccio. This apparition\nwas so strange and so solemn, that every one rose, with the exception\nof Carlini, who remained seated, and ate and drank calmly. Diavolaccio\nadvanced amidst the most profound silence, and laid Rita at the\ncaptain's feet. Then every one could understand the cause of the\nunearthly pallor in the young girl and the bandit. A knife was plunged\nup to the hilt in Rita's left breast. Every one looked at Carlini;\nthe sheath at his belt was empty. 'Ah, ah,' said the chief, 'I now\nunderstand why Carlini stayed behind.' All savage natures appreciate a\ndesperate deed. No other of the bandits would, perhaps, have done the\nsame; but they all understood what Carlini had done. 'Now, then,' cried\nCarlini, rising in his turn, and approaching the corpse, his hand on the\nbutt of one of his pistols, 'does any one dispute the possession of\nthis woman with me?'--'No,' returned the chief, 'she is thine.' Carlini\nraised her in his arms, and carried her out of the circle of firelight.\nCucumetto placed his sentinels for the night, and the bandits wrapped\nthemselves in their cloaks, and lay down before the fire. At midnight\nthe sentinel gave the alarm, and in an instant all were on the alert. It\nwas Rita's father, who brought his daughter's ransom in person. 'Here,'\nsaid he, to Cucumetto, 'here are three hundred piastres; give me back\nmy child. But the chief, without taking the money, made a sign to him\nto follow. The old man obeyed. They both advanced beneath the trees,\nthrough whose branches streamed the moonlight. Cucumetto stopped at\nlast, and pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree.\n\n\"'There,' said he, 'demand thy child of Carlini; he will tell thee\nwhat has become of her;' and he returned to his companions. The old man\nremained motionless; he felt that some great and unforeseen misfortune\nhung over his head. At length he advanced toward the group, the meaning\nof which he could not comprehend. As he approached, Carlini raised his\nhead, and the forms of two persons became visible to the old man's eyes.\nA woman lay on the ground, her head resting on the knees of a man,\nwho was seated by her; as he raised his head, the woman's face became\nvisible. The old man recognized his child, and Carlini recognized the\nold man. 'I expected thee,' said the bandit to Rita's father.--'Wretch!'\nreturned the old man, 'what hast thou done?' and he gazed with terror on\nRita, pale and bloody, a knife buried in her bosom. A ray of\nmoonlight poured through the trees, and lighted up the face of the\ndead.--'Cucumetto had violated thy daughter,' said the bandit; 'I loved\nher, therefore I slew her; for she would have served as the sport of\nthe whole band.' The old man spoke not, and grew pale as death. 'Now,'\ncontinued Carlini, 'if I have done wrongly, avenge her;' and withdrawing\nthe knife from the wound in Rita's bosom, he held it out to the old man\nwith one hand, while with the other he tore open his vest.--'Thou hast\ndone well!' returned the old man in a hoarse voice; 'embrace me, my\nson.' Carlini threw himself, sobbing like a child, into the arms of his\nmistress's father. These were the first tears the man of blood had\never wept. 'Now,' said the old man, 'aid me to bury my child.' Carlini\nfetched two pickaxes; and the father and the lover began to dig at the\nfoot of a huge oak, beneath which the young girl was to repose. When\nthe grave was formed, the father kissed her first, and then the lover;\nafterwards, one taking the head, the other the feet, they placed her\nin the grave. Then they knelt on each side of the grave, and said the\nprayers of the dead. Then, when they had finished, they cast the earth\nover the corpse, until the grave was filled. Then, extending his\nhand, the old man said; 'I thank you, my son; and now leave me\nalone.'--'Yet'--replied Carlini.--'Leave me, I command you.' Carlini\nobeyed, rejoined his comrades, folded himself in his cloak, and soon\nappeared to sleep as soundly as the rest. It had been resolved the night\nbefore to change their encampment. An hour before daybreak, Cucumetto\naroused his men, and gave the word to march. But Carlini would not quit\nthe forest, without knowing what had become of Rita's father. He went\ntoward the place where he had left him. He found the old man suspended\nfrom one of the branches of the oak which shaded his daughter's grave.\nHe then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead body of the one\nand the tomb of the other. But he was unable to complete this oath, for\ntwo days afterwards, in an encounter with the Roman carbineers, Carlini\nwas killed. There was some surprise, however, that, as he was with his\nface to the enemy, he should have received a ball between his shoulders.\nThat astonishment ceased when one of the brigands remarked to his\ncomrades that Cucumetto was stationed ten paces in Carlini's rear when\nhe fell. On the morning of the departure from the forest of Frosinone he\nhad followed Carlini in the darkness, and heard this oath of vengeance,\nand, like a wise man, anticipated it. They told ten other stories of\nthis bandit chief, each more singular than the other. Thus, from Fondi\nto Perusia, every one trembles at the name of Cucumetto.\n\n\"These narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between\nLuigi and Teresa. The young girl trembled very much at hearing the\nstories; but Vampa reassured her with a smile, tapping the butt of his\ngood fowling-piece, which threw its ball so well; and if that did not\nrestore her courage, he pointed to a crow, perched on some dead branch,\ntook aim, touched the trigger, and the bird fell dead at the foot of the\ntree. Time passed on, and the two young people had agreed to be married\nwhen Vampa should be twenty and Teresa nineteen years of age. They were\nboth orphans, and had only their employers' leave to ask, which had been\nalready sought and obtained. One day when they were talking over their\nplans for the future, they heard two or three reports of firearms,\nand then suddenly a man came out of the wood, near which the two young\npersons used to graze their flocks, and hurried towards them. When he\ncame within hearing, he exclaimed. 'I am pursued; can you conceal me?'\nThey knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit; but there is an\ninnate sympathy between the Roman brigand and the Roman peasant and the\nlatter is always ready to aid the former. Vampa, without saying a word,\nhastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their grotto, drew\nit away, made a sign to the fugitive to take refuge there, in a retreat\nunknown to every one, closed the stone upon him, and then went and\nresumed his seat by Teresa. Instantly afterwards four carbineers, on\nhorseback, appeared on the edge of the wood; three of them appeared to\nbe looking for the fugitive, while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner\nby the neck. The three carbineers looked about carefully on every side,\nsaw the young peasants, and galloping up, began to question them. They\nhad seen no one. 'That is very annoying,' said the brigadier; for the\nman we are looking for is the chief.'--'Cucumetto?' cried Luigi and\nTeresa at the same moment.\n\n\"'Yes,' replied the brigadier; 'and as his head is valued at a thousand\nRoman crowns, there would have been five hundred for you, if you had\nhelped us to catch him.' The two young persons exchanged looks. The\nbrigadier had a moment's hope. Five hundred Roman crowns are three\nthousand lire, and three thousand lire are a fortune for two poor\norphans who are going to be married.\n\n\"'Yes, it is very annoying,' said Vampa; 'but we have not seen him.'\n\n\"Then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions, but\nin vain; then, after a time, they disappeared. Vampa then removed the\nstone, and Cucumetto came out. Through the crevices in the granite he\nhad seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers, and guessed\nthe subject of their parley. He had read in the countenances of Luigi\nand Teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him, and he drew\nfrom his pocket a purse full of gold, which he offered to them. But\nVampa raised his head proudly; as to Teresa, her eyes sparkled when she\nthought of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this\npurse of gold.\n\n\"Cucumetto was a cunning fiend, and had assumed the form of a brigand\ninstead of a serpent, and this look from Teresa showed to him that she\nwas a worthy daughter of Eve, and he returned to the forest, pausing\nseveral times on his way, under the pretext of saluting his protectors.\nSeveral days elapsed, and they neither saw nor heard of Cucumetto. The\ntime of the Carnival was at hand. The Count of San-Felice announced a\ngrand masked ball, to which all that were distinguished in Rome were\ninvited. Teresa had a great desire to see this ball. Luigi asked\npermission of his protector, the steward, that she and he might be\npresent amongst the servants of the house. This was granted. The ball\nwas given by the Count for the particular pleasure of his daughter\nCarmela, whom he adored. Carmela was precisely the age and figure of\nTeresa, and Teresa was as handsome as Carmela. On the evening of the\nball Teresa was attired in her best, her most brilliant ornaments in her\nhair, and gayest glass beads,--she was in the costume of the women of\nFrascati. Luigi wore the very picturesque garb of the Roman peasant\nat holiday time. They both mingled, as they had leave to do, with the\nservants and peasants.\n\n\"The festa was magnificent; not only was the villa brilliantly\nilluminated, but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from\nthe trees in the garden; and very soon the palace overflowed to the\nterraces, and the terraces to the garden-walks. At each cross-path was\nan orchestra, and tables spread with refreshments; the guests stopped,\nformed quadrilles, and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased.\nCarmela was attired like a woman of Sonnino. Her cap was embroidered\nwith pearls, the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds, her girdle\nwas of Turkey silk, with large embroidered flowers, her bodice and skirt\nwere of cashmere, her apron of Indian muslin, and the buttons of her\ncorset were of jewels. Two of her companions were dressed, the one as a\nwoman of Nettuno, and the other as a woman of La Riccia. Four young men\nof the richest and noblest families of Rome accompanied them with that\nItalian freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in\nthe world. They were attired as peasants of Albano, Velletri,\nCivita-Castellana, and Sora. We need hardly add that these peasant\ncostumes, like those of the young women, were brilliant with gold and\njewels.\n\n\"Carmela wished to form a quadrille, but there was one lady wanting.\nCarmela looked all around her, but not one of the guests had a costume\nsimilar to her own, or those of her companions. The Count of San-Felice\npointed out Teresa, who was hanging on Luigi's arm in a group of\npeasants. 'Will you allow me, father?' said Carmela.--'Certainly,'\nreplied the count, 'are we not in Carnival time?'--Carmela turned\ntowards the young man who was talking with her, and saying a few words\nto him, pointed with her finger to Teresa. The young man looked, bowed\nin obedience, and then went to Teresa, and invited her to dance in a\nquadrille directed by the count's daughter. Teresa felt a flush pass\nover her face; she looked at Luigi, who could not refuse his assent.\nLuigi slowly relinquished Teresa's arm, which he had held beneath his\nown, and Teresa, accompanied by her elegant cavalier, took her appointed\nplace with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille. Certainly, in\nthe eyes of an artist, the exact and strict costume of Teresa had a very\ndifferent character from that of Carmela and her companions; and Teresa\nwas frivolous and coquettish, and thus the embroidery and muslins, the\ncashmere waist-girdles, all dazzled her, and the reflection of sapphires\nand diamonds almost turned her giddy brain.\n\n\"Luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind. It was\nlike an acute pain which gnawed at his heart, and then thrilled through\nhis whole body. He followed with his eye each movement of Teresa and her\ncavalier; when their hands touched, he felt as though he should swoon;\nevery pulse beat with violence, and it seemed as though a bell were\nringing in his ears. When they spoke, although Teresa listened timidly\nand with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier, as Luigi\ncould read in the ardent looks of the good-looking young man that his\nlanguage was that of praise, it seemed as if the whole world was turning\nround with him, and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears\nideas of murder and assassination. Then fearing that his paroxysm might\nget the better of him, he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree\nagainst which he was leaning, and with the other convulsively grasped\nthe dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt, and which,\nunwittingly, he drew from the scabbard from time to time. Luigi was\njealous! He felt that, influenced by her ambitions and coquettish\ndisposition, Teresa might escape him.\n\n\"The young peasant girl, at first timid and scared, soon recovered\nherself. We have said that Teresa was handsome, but this is not all;\nTeresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more\npotent than our affected and studied elegancies. She had almost all\nthe honors of the quadrille, and if she were envious of the Count of\nSan-Felice's daughter, we will not undertake to say that Carmela was not\njealous of her. And with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier\nled her back to the place whence he had taken her, and where Luigi\nawaited her. Twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had glanced\nat Luigi, and each time she saw that he was pale and that his features\nwere agitated, once even the blade of his knife, half drawn from its\nsheath, had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare. Thus, it was\nalmost tremblingly that she resumed her lover's arm. The quadrille had\nbeen most perfect, and it was evident there was a great demand for a\nrepetition, Carmela alone objecting to it, but the Count of San-Felice\nbesought his daughter so earnestly, that she acceded. One of the\ncavaliers then hastened to invite Teresa, without whom it was impossible\nfor the quadrille to be formed, but the young girl had disappeared. The\ntruth was, that Luigi had not felt the strength to support another such\ntrial, and, half by persuasion and half by force, he had removed Teresa\ntoward another part of the garden. Teresa had yielded in spite of\nherself, but when she looked at the agitated countenance of the young\nman, she understood by his silence and trembling voice that something\nstrange was passing within him. She herself was not exempt from internal\nemotion, and without having done anything wrong, yet fully comprehended\nthat Luigi was right in reproaching her. Why, she did not know, but yet\nshe did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited. However,\nto Teresa's great astonishment, Luigi remained mute, and not a word\nescaped his lips the rest of the evening. When the chill of the night\nhad driven away the guests from the gardens, and the gates of the villa\nwere closed on them for the festa in-doors, he took Teresa quite away,\nand as he left her at her home, he said,--\n\n\"'Teresa, what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young\nCountess of San-Felice?'--'I thought,' replied the young girl, with\nall the frankness of her nature, 'that I would give half my life for a\ncostume such as she wore.'\n\n\"'And what said your cavalier to you?'--'He said it only depended on\nmyself to have it, and I had only one word to say.'\n\n\"'He was right,' said Luigi. 'Do you desire it as ardently as you\nsay?'--'Yes.'--'Well, then, you shall have it!'\n\n\"The young girl, much astonished, raised her head to look at him, but\nhis face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips.\nAs Luigi spoke thus, he left her. Teresa followed him with her eyes into\nthe darkness as long as she could, and when he had quite disappeared,\nshe went into the house with a sigh.\n\n\"That night a memorable event occurred, due, no doubt, to the imprudence\nof some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights. The Villa\nof San-Felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of the\nlovely Carmela. Awakened in the night by the light of the flames, she\nsprang out of bed, wrapped herself in a dressing-gown, and attempted\nto escape by the door, but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was\nalready a prey to the flames. She then returned to her room, calling for\nhelp as loudly as she could, when suddenly her window, which was twenty\nfeet from the ground, was opened, a young peasant jumped into the\nchamber, seized her in his arms, and with superhuman skill and strength\nconveyed her to the turf of the grass-plot, where she fainted. When she\nrecovered, her father was by her side. All the servants surrounded her,\noffering her assistance. An entire wing of the villa was burnt down; but\nwhat of that, as long as Carmela was safe and uninjured? Her preserver\nwas everywhere sought for, but he did not appear; he was inquired after,\nbut no one had seen him. Carmela was greatly troubled that she had not\nrecognized him. As the count was immensely rich, excepting the danger\nCarmela had run,--and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped,\nmade that appear to him rather a favor of providence than a real\nmisfortune,--the loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a\ntrifle.\n\n\"The next day, at the usual hour, the two young peasants were on the\nborders of the forest. Luigi arrived first. He came toward Teresa in\nhigh spirits, and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the\nprevious evening. The young girl was very pensive, but seeing Luigi so\ncheerful, she on her part assumed a smiling air, which was natural to\nher when she was not excited or in a passion. Luigi took her arm beneath\nhis own, and led her to the door of the grotto. Then he paused. The\nyoung girl, perceiving that there was something extraordinary, looked\nat him steadfastly. 'Teresa,' said Luigi, 'yesterday evening you told\nme you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the\ncount's daughter.'--'Yes,' replied Teresa with astonishment; 'but I was\nmad to utter such a wish.'--'And I replied, \"Very well, you shall have\nit.\"'--'Yes,' replied the young girl, whose astonishment increased\nat every word uttered by Luigi, 'but of course your reply was only to\nplease me.'\n\n\"'I have promised no more than I have given you, Teresa,' said Luigi\nproudly. 'Go into the grotto and dress yourself.' At these words he\ndrew away the stone, and showed Teresa the grotto, lighted up by two\nwax lights, which burnt on each side of a splendid mirror; on a rustic\ntable, made by Luigi, were spread out the pearl necklace and the diamond\npins, and on a chair at the side was laid the rest of the costume.\n\n\"Teresa uttered a cry of joy, and, without inquiring whence this attire\ncame, or even thanking Luigi, darted into the grotto, transformed into a\ndressing-room. Luigi pushed the stone behind her, for on the crest of a\nsmall adjacent hill which cut off the view toward Palestrina, he saw a\ntraveller on horseback, stopping a moment, as if uncertain of his road,\nand thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is\npeculiar to distant objects in southern climes. When he saw Luigi,\nhe put his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him. Luigi was not\nmistaken. The traveller, who was going from Palestrina to Tivoli, had\nmistaken his way; the young man directed him; but as at a distance of\na quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways, and on\nreaching these the traveller might again stray from his route, he begged\nLuigi to be his guide. Luigi threw his cloak on the ground, placed his\ncarbine on his shoulder, and freed from his heavy covering, preceded\nthe traveller with the rapid step of a mountaineer, which a horse can\nscarcely keep up with. In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached\nthe cross-roads. On arriving there, with an air as majestic as that of\nan emperor, he stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which\nthe traveller was to follow.--\"That is your road, excellency, and now\nyou cannot again mistake.\"--'And here is your recompense,' said the\ntraveller, offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money.\n\n\"'Thank you,' said Luigi, drawing back his hand; 'I render a service, I\ndo not sell it.'--'Well,' replied the traveller, who seemed used to this\ndifference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride\nof the mountaineer, 'if you refuse wages, you will, perhaps, accept a\ngift.'--'Ah, yes, that is another thing.'--'Then,' said the traveller,\n'take these two Venetian sequins and give them to your bride, to make\nherself a pair of earrings.'\n\n\"'And then do you take this poniard,' said the young herdsman; 'you will\nnot find one better carved between Albano and Civita-Castellana.'\n\n\"'I accept it,' answered the traveller, 'but then the obligation will\nbe on my side, for this poniard is worth more than two sequins.'--'For a\ndealer perhaps; but for me, who engraved it myself, it is hardly worth a\npiastre.'\n\n\"'What is your name?' inquired the traveller.--'Luigi Vampa,' replied\nthe shepherd, with the same air as he would have replied, Alexander,\nKing of Macedon.--'And yours?'--'I,' said the traveller, 'am called\nSinbad the Sailor.'\" Franz d'Epinay started with surprise.\n\n\"Sinbad the Sailor.\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the narrator; \"that was the name which the traveller gave\nto Vampa as his own.\"\n\n\"Well, and what may you have to say against this name?\" inquired Albert;\n\"it is a very pretty name, and the adventures of the gentleman of that\nname amused me very much in my youth, I must confess.\"--Franz said no\nmore. The name of Sinbad the Sailor, as may well be supposed, awakened\nin him a world of recollections, as had the name of the Count of Monte\nCristo on the previous evening.\n\n\"Proceed!\" said he to the host.\n\n\"Vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket, and slowly\nreturned by the way he had gone. As he came within two or three hundred\npaces of the grotto, he thought he heard a cry. He listened to know\nwhence this sound could proceed. A moment afterwards he thought he heard\nhis own name pronounced distinctly. The cry proceeded from the grotto.\nHe bounded like a chamois, cocking his carbine as he went, and in a\nmoment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had\nperceived the traveller. Three cries for help came more distinctly to\nhis ear. He cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off Teresa,\nas Nessus, the centaur, carried Dejanira. This man, who was hastening\ntowards the wood, was already three-quarters of the way on the road from\nthe grotto to the forest. Vampa measured the distance; the man was at\nleast two hundred paces in advance of him, and there was not a chance\nof overtaking him. The young shepherd stopped, as if his feet had\nbeen rooted to the ground; then he put the butt of his carbine to his\nshoulder, took aim at the ravisher, followed him for a second in his\ntrack, and then fired. The ravisher stopped suddenly, his knees bent\nunder him, and he fell with Teresa in his arms. The young girl rose\ninstantly, but the man lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of\ndeath. Vampa then rushed towards Teresa; for at ten paces from the dying\nman her legs had failed her, and she had dropped on her knees, so that\nthe young man feared that the ball that had brought down his enemy, had\nalso wounded his betrothed. Fortunately, she was unscathed, and it was\nfright alone that had overcome Teresa. When Luigi had assured himself\nthat she was safe and unharmed, he turned towards the wounded man. He\nhad just expired, with clinched hands, his mouth in a spasm of agony,\nand his hair on end in the sweat of death. His eyes remained open and\nmenacing. Vampa approached the corpse, and recognized Cucumetto. From\nthe day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young peasants, he\nhad been enamoured of Teresa, and had sworn she should be his. From that\ntime he had watched them, and profiting by the moment when her lover had\nleft her alone, had carried her off, and believed he at length had her\nin his power, when the ball, directed by the unerring skill of the young\nherdsman, had pierced his heart. Vampa gazed on him for a moment\nwithout betraying the slightest emotion; while, on the contrary, Teresa,\nshuddering in every limb, dared not approach the slain ruffian but\nby degrees, and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the\nshoulder of her lover. Suddenly Vampa turned toward his mistress:--'Ah,'\nsaid he--'good, good! You are dressed; it is now my turn to dress\nmyself.'\n\n\"Teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the Count of\nSan-Felice's daughter. Vampa took Cucumetto's body in his arms and\nconveyed it to the grotto, while in her turn Teresa remained outside.\nIf a second traveller had passed, he would have seen a strange thing,--a\nshepherdess watching her flock, clad in a cashmere grown, with ear-rings\nand necklace of pearls, diamond pins, and buttons of sapphires,\nemeralds, and rubies. He would, no doubt, have believed that he had\nreturned to the times of Florian, and would have declared, on reaching\nParis, that he had met an Alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of\nthe Sabine Hill. At the end of a quarter of an hour Vampa quitted the\ngrotto; his costume was no less elegant than that of Teresa. He wore\na vest of garnet-colored velvet, with buttons of cut gold; a silk\nwaistcoat covered with embroidery; a Roman scarf tied round his neck; a\ncartridge-box worked with gold, and red and green silk; sky-blue velvet\nbreeches, fastened above the knee with diamond buckles; garters of\ndeerskin, worked with a thousand arabesques, and a hat whereon hung\nribbons of all colors; two watches hung from his girdle, and a splendid\nponiard was in his belt. Teresa uttered a cry of admiration. Vampa in\nthis attire resembled a painting by Leopold Robert, or Schnetz. He had\nassumed the entire costume of Cucumetto. The young man saw the effect\nproduced on his betrothed, and a smile of pride passed over his\nlips.--'Now,' he said to Teresa, 'are you ready to share my\nfortune, whatever it may be?'--'Oh, yes!' exclaimed the young girl\nenthusiastically.--'And follow me wherever I go?'--'To the world's\nend.'--'Then take my arm, and let us on; we have no time to lose.'--The\nyoung girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he was\nconducting her, for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome,\nproud, and powerful as a god. They went towards the forest, and soon\nentered it. We need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were\nknown to Vampa; he therefore went forward without a moment's hesitation,\nalthough there was no beaten track, but he knew his path by looking at\nthe trees and bushes, and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour\nand a half. At the end of this time they had reached the thickest of the\nforest. A torrent, whose bed was dry, led into a deep gorge. Vampa took\nthis wild road, which, enclosed between two ridges, and shadowed by the\ntufted umbrage of the pines, seemed, but for the difficulties of its\ndescent, that path to Avernus of which Virgil speaks. Teresa had become\nalarmed at the wild and deserted look of the plain around her, and\npressed closely against her guide, not uttering a syllable; but as she\nsaw him advance with even step and composed countenance, she endeavored\nto repress her emotion. Suddenly, about ten paces from them, a man\nadvanced from behind a tree and aimed at Vampa.--'Not another step,' he\nsaid, 'or you are a dead man.'--'What, then,' said Vampa, raising his\nhand with a gesture of disdain, while Teresa, no longer able to restrain\nher alarm, clung closely to him, 'do wolves rend each other?'--'Who\nare you?' inquired the sentinel.--'I am Luigi Vampa, shepherd of\nthe San-Felice farm.'--'What do you want?'--'I would speak with your\ncompanions who are in the glade at Rocca Bianca.'--'Follow me, then,'\nsaid the sentinel; 'or, as you know your way, go first.'--Vampa smiled\ndisdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit, went before\nTeresa, and continued to advance with the same firm and easy step as\nbefore. At the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to stop.\nThe two young persons obeyed. Then the bandit thrice imitated the cry of\na crow; a croak answered this signal.--'Good!' said the sentry, 'you may\nnow go on.'--Luigi and Teresa again set forward; as they went on\nTeresa clung tremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the\nglistening of carbines through the trees. The retreat of Rocca Bianca\nwas at the top of a small mountain, which no doubt in former days\nhad been a volcano--an extinct volcano before the days when Remus and\nRomulus had deserted Alba to come and found the city of Rome. Teresa\nand Luigi reached the summit, and all at once found themselves in the\npresence of twenty bandits. 'Here is a young man who seeks and wishes\nto speak to you,' said the sentinel.--'What has he to say?' inquired\nthe young man who was in command in the chief's absence.--'I wish to\nsay that I am tired of a shepherd's life,' was Vampa's reply.--'Ah,\nI understand,' said the lieutenant; 'and you seek admittance into our\nranks?'--'Welcome!' cried several bandits from Ferrusino, Pampinara,\nand Anagni, who had recognized Luigi Vampa.--'Yes, but I came to ask\nsomething more than to be your companion.'--'And what may that be?'\ninquired the bandits with astonishment.--'I come to ask to be your\ncaptain,' said the young man. The bandits shouted with laughter.\n'And what have you done to aspire to this honor?' demanded the\nlieutenant.--'I have killed your chief, Cucumetto, whose dress I now\nwear; and I set fire to the villa San-Felice to procure a wedding-dress\nfor my betrothed.' An hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain,\nvice Cucumetto deceased.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear Albert,\" said Franz, turning towards his friend; \"what\nthink you of citizen Luigi Vampa?\"\n\n\"I say he is a myth,\" replied Albert, \"and never had an existence.\"\n\n\"And what may a myth be?\" inquired Pastrini.\n\n\"The explanation would be too long, my dear landlord,\" replied Franz.\n\n\"And you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this moment\nin the environs of Rome?\"\n\n\"And with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an\nexample.\"\n\n\"Then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him?\"\n\n\"Why, you see, he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the\nplains, the fishermen of the Tiber, and the smugglers of the coast. They\nseek for him in the mountains, and he is on the waters; they follow him\non the waters, and he is on the open sea; then they pursue him, and he\nhas suddenly taken refuge in the islands, at Giglio, Guanouti, or Monte\nCristo; and when they hunt for him there, he reappears suddenly at\nAlbano, Tivoli, or La Riccia.\"\n\n\"And how does he behave towards travellers?\"\n\n\"Alas! his plan is very simple. It depends on the distance he may be\nfrom the city, whether he gives eight hours, twelve hours, or a day\nwherein to pay their ransom; and when that time has elapsed he allows\nanother hour's grace. At the sixtieth minute of this hour, if the\nmoney is not forthcoming, he blows out the prisoner's brains with a\npistol-shot, or plants his dagger in his heart, and that settles the\naccount.\"\n\n\"Well, Albert,\" inquired Franz of his companion, \"are you still disposed\nto go to the Colosseum by the outer wall?\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Albert, \"if the way be picturesque.\" The clock struck\nnine as the door opened, and a coachman appeared. \"Excellencies,\" said\nhe, \"the coach is ready.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Franz, \"let us to the Colosseum.\"\n\n\"By the Porta del Popolo or by the streets, your excellencies?\"\n\n\"By the streets, morbleu, by the streets!\" cried Franz.\n\n\"Ah, my dear fellow,\" said Albert, rising, and lighting his third cigar,\n\"really, I thought you had more courage.\" So saying, the two young men\nwent down the staircase, and got into the carriage.\n\n\n\nChapter 34. The Colosseum.\n\nFranz had so managed his route, that during the ride to the Colosseum\nthey passed not a single ancient ruin, so that no preliminary impression\ninterfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building\nthey came to admire. The road selected was a continuation of the Via\nSistina; then by cutting off the right angle of the street in which\nstands Santa Maria Maggiore and proceeding by the Via Urbana and\nSan Pietro in Vincoli, the travellers would find themselves directly\nopposite the Colosseum. This itinerary possessed another great\nadvantage,--that of leaving Franz at full liberty to indulge his deep\nreverie upon the subject of Signor Pastrini's story, in which his\nmysterious host of Monte Cristo was so strangely mixed up. Seated with\nfolded arms in a corner of the carriage, he continued to ponder over\nthe singular history he had so lately listened to, and to ask himself\nan interminable number of questions touching its various circumstances\nwithout, however, arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them. One\nfact more than the rest brought his friend \"Sinbad the Sailor\" back\nto his recollection, and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy that\nseemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors; and Pastrini's\naccount of Vampa's having found refuge on board the vessels of smugglers\nand fishermen, reminded Franz of the two Corsican bandits he had found\nsupping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht, which had even\ndeviated from its course and touched at Porto-Vecchio for the sole\npurpose of landing them. The very name assumed by his host of Monte\nCristo and again repeated by the landlord of the Hotel de Londres,\nabundantly proved to him that his island friend was playing his\nphilanthropic part on the shores of Piombino, Civita-Vecchio, Ostia, and\nGaeta, as on those of Corsica, Tuscany, and Spain; and further, Franz\nbethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both\nof Tunis and Palermo, proving thereby how largely his circle of\nacquaintances extended.\n\nBut however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these\nreflections, they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark\nfrowning ruins of the stupendous Colosseum, through the various openings\nof which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly\ngleam from the eyes of the wandering dead. The carriage stopped near the\nMeta Sudans; the door was opened, and the young men, eagerly alighting,\nfound themselves opposite a cicerone, who appeared to have sprung up\nfrom the ground, so unexpected was his appearance.\n\nThe usual guide from the hotel having followed them, they had paid two\nconductors, nor is it possible, at Rome, to avoid this abundant supply\nof guides; besides the ordinary cicerone, who seizes upon you directly\nyou set foot in your hotel, and never quits you while you remain in the\ncity, there is also a special cicerone belonging to each monument--nay,\nalmost to each part of a monument. It may, therefore, be easily imagined\nthere is no scarcity of guides at the Colosseum, that wonder of all\nages, which Martial thus eulogizes: \"Let Memphis cease to boast the\nbarbarous miracles of her pyramids, and the wonders of Babylon be talked\nof no more among us; all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic\nlabor of the Caesars, and the many voices of Fame spread far and wide\nthe surpassing merits of this incomparable monument.\"\n\nAs for Albert and Franz, they essayed not to escape from their\nciceronian tyrants; and, indeed, it would have been so much the more\ndifficult to break their bondage, as the guides alone are permitted to\nvisit these monuments with torches in their hands. Thus, then, the\nyoung men made no attempt at resistance, but blindly and confidingly\nsurrendered themselves into the care and custody of their conductors.\nAlbert had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the\nColosseum, while his less favored companion trod for the first time in\nhis life the classic ground forming the monument of Flavius Vespasian;\nand, to his credit be it spoken, his mind, even amid the glib loquacity\nof the guides, was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic\nadmiration of all he saw; and certainly no adequate notion of these\nstupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them, and\nmore especially by moonlight, at which time the vast proportions of the\nbuilding appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of\na southern moonlit sky, whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to\nlight the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of an eastern\nclime. Scarcely, therefore, had the reflective Franz walked a hundred\nsteps beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin, than, abandoning\nAlbert to the guides (who would by no means yield their prescriptive\nright of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down,\nand as regularly followed by them, but dragged the unconscious visitor\nto the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal,\nbeginning, as a matter of course, with the Lions' Den, and finishing\nwith Caesar's \"Podium,\"), to escape a jargon and mechanical survey\nof the wonders by which he was surrounded, Franz ascended a\nhalf-dilapidated staircase, and, leaving them to follow their monotonous\nround, seated himself at the foot of a column, and immediately opposite\na large aperture, which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed\nview of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin.\n\nFranz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden\nby the shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a\nresting-place, and from whence his eyes followed the motions of Albert\nand his guides, who, holding torches in their hands, had emerged from\na vomitarium at the opposite extremity of the Colosseum, and then again\ndisappeared down the steps conducting to the seats reserved for the\nVestal virgins, resembling, as they glided along, some restless shades\nfollowing the flickering glare of so many ignes-fatui. All at once his\near caught a sound resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase\nopposite the one by which he had himself ascended. There was nothing\nremarkable in the circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and\nfalling heavily below; but it seemed to him that the substance that fell\ngave way beneath the pressure of a foot, and also that some one, who\nendeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being\nheard, was approaching the spot where he sat. Conjecture soon became\ncertainty, for the figure of a man was distinctly visible to Franz,\ngradually emerging from the staircase opposite, upon which the moon was\nat that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness.\n\nThe stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who, like\nFranz, preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to\nthe frivolous gabble of the guides. And his appearance had nothing\nextraordinary in it; but the hesitation with which he proceeded,\nstopping and listening with anxious attention at every step he took,\nconvinced Franz that he expected the arrival of some person. By a sort\nof instinctive impulse, Franz withdrew as much as possible behind his\npillar. About ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were, the\nroof had given way, leaving a large round opening, through which might\nbe seen the blue vault of heaven, thickly studded with stars. Around\nthis opening, which had, possibly, for ages permitted a free entrance\nto the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile, grew a\nquantity of creeping plants, whose delicate green branches stood out in\nbold relief against the clear azure of the firmament, while large masses\nof thick, strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm, and\nhung floating to and fro, like so many waving strings. The person whose\nmysterious arrival had attracted the attention of Franz stood in a kind\nof half-light, that rendered it impossible to distinguish his features,\nalthough his dress was easily made out. He wore a large brown mantle,\none fold of which, thrown over his left shoulder, served likewise\nto mask the lower part of his countenance, while the upper part was\ncompletely hidden by his broad-brimmed hat. The lower part of his dress\nwas more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon, which,\nentering through the broken ceiling, shed their refulgent beams on feet\ncased in elegantly made boots of polished leather, over which descended\nfashionably cut trousers of black cloth.\n\nFrom the imperfect means Franz had of judging, he could only come to\none conclusion,--that the person whom he was thus watching certainly\nbelonged to no inferior station of life. Some few minutes had elapsed,\nand the stranger began to show manifest signs of impatience, when a\nslight noise was heard outside the aperture in the roof, and almost\nimmediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the flood of light that had\nentered it, and the figure of a man was clearly seen gazing with eager\nscrutiny on the immense space beneath him; then, as his eye caught\nsight of him in the mantle, he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted\nboughs, and glided down by their help to within three or four feet\nof the ground, and then leaped lightly on his feet. The man who had\nperformed this daring act with so much indifference wore the Transtevere\ncostume. \"I beg your excellency's pardon for keeping you waiting,\" said\nthe man, in the Roman dialect, \"but I don't think I'm many minutes after\nmy time, ten o'clock has just struck on the Lateran.\"\n\n\"Say not a word about being late,\" replied the stranger in purest\nTuscan; \"'tis I who am too soon. But even if you had caused me to wait\na little while, I should have felt quite sure that the delay was not\noccasioned by any fault of yours.\"\n\n\"Your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking,\" said the man; \"I\ncame here direct from the Castle of St. Angelo, and I had an immense\ndeal of trouble before I could get a chance to speak to Beppo.\"\n\n\"And who is Beppo?\"\n\n\"Oh, Beppo is employed in the prison, and I give him so much a year to\nlet me know what is going on within his holiness's castle.\"\n\n\"Indeed! You are a provident person, I see.\"\n\n\"Why, you see, no one knows what may happen. Perhaps some of these days\nI may be entrapped, like poor Peppino and may be very glad to have some\nlittle nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net, and so help me out\nof prison.\"\n\n\"Briefly, what did you glean?\"\n\n\"That two executions of considerable interest will take place the\nday after to-morrow at two o'clock, as is customary at Rome at the\ncommencement of all great festivals. One of the culprits will be\nmazzolato; [*] he is an atrocious villain, who murdered the priest who\nbrought him up, and deserves not the smallest pity. The other sufferer\nis sentenced to be decapitato; [**] and he, your excellency, is poor\nPeppino.\"\n\n     * Knocked on the head.\n\n     ** Beheaded.\n\n\"The fact is, that you have inspired not only the pontifical government,\nbut also the neighboring states, with such extreme fear, that they are\nglad of all opportunity of making an example.\"\n\n\"But Peppino did not even belong to my band: he was merely a poor\nshepherd, whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions.\"\n\n\"Which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes. But mark\nthe distinction with which he is treated; instead of being knocked on\nthe head as you would be if once they caught hold of you, he is simply\nsentenced to be guillotined, by which means, too, the amusements of\nthe day are diversified, and there is a spectacle to please every\nspectator.\"\n\n\"Without reckoning the wholly unexpected one I am preparing to surprise\nthem with.\"\n\n\"My good friend,\" said the man in the cloak, \"excuse me for saying that\nyou seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant\nact.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am; but one thing I have resolved on, and that is, to stop at\nnothing to restore a poor devil to liberty, who has got into this scrape\nsolely from having served me. I should hate and despise myself as a\ncoward did I desert the brave fellow in his present extremity.\"\n\n\"And what do you mean to do?\"\n\n\"To surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men, who, at a signal\nfrom me, will rush forward directly Peppino is brought for execution,\nand, by the assistance of their stilettos, drive back the guard, and\ncarry off the prisoner.\"\n\n\"That seems to me as hazardous as uncertain, and convinces me that my\nscheme is far better than yours.\"\n\n\"And what is your excellency's project?\"\n\n\"Just this. I will so advantageously bestow 2,000 piastres, that the\nperson receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for Peppino;\nand during that year, another skilfully placed 1,000 piastres will\nafford him the means of escaping from his prison.\"\n\n\"And do you feel sure of succeeding?\"\n\n\"Pardieu!\" exclaimed the man in the cloak, suddenly expressing himself\nin French.\n\n\"What did your excellency say?\" inquired the other.\n\n\"I said, my good fellow, that I would do more single-handed by the\nmeans of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos,\npistols, carbines, and blunderbusses included. Leave me, then, to act,\nand have no fears for the result.\"\n\n\"At least, there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness,\nin case your excellency should fail.\"\n\n\"None whatever. Take what precautions you please, if it is any\nsatisfaction to you to do so; but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve I\nseek.\"\n\n\"Remember, the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow, and that\nyou have but one day to work in.\"\n\n\"And what of that? Is not a day divided into twenty-four hours, each\nhour into sixty minutes, and every minute sub-divided into sixty\nseconds? Now in 86,400 seconds very many things can be done.\"\n\n\"And how shall I know whether your excellency has succeeded or not.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is very easily arranged. I have engaged the three lower\nwindows at the Cafe Rospoli; should I have obtained the requisite pardon\nfor Peppino, the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks,\nand the centre with white, having a large cross in red marked on it.\"\n\n\"And whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer directing\nthe execution?\"\n\n\"Send one of your men, disguised as a penitent friar, and I will give it\nto him. His dress will procure him the means of approaching the scaffold\nitself, and he will deliver the official order to the officer, who, in\nhis turn, will hand it to the executioner; in the meantime, it will be\nas well to acquaint Peppino with what we have determined on, if it\nbe only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses, because in\neither case a very useless expense will have been incurred.\"\n\n\"Your excellency,\" said the man, \"you are fully persuaded of my entire\ndevotion to you, are you not?\"\n\n\"Nay, I flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it,\" replied the\ncavalier in the cloak.\n\n\"Well, then, only fulfil your promise of rescuing Peppino, and\nhenceforward you shall receive not only devotion, but the most absolute\nobedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render\nto another.\"\n\n\"Have a care how far you pledge yourself, my good friend, for I may\nremind you of your promise at some, perhaps, not very distant period,\nwhen I, in my turn, may require your aid and influence.\"\n\n\"Let that day come sooner or later, your excellency will find me what\nI have found you in this my heavy trouble; and if from the other end\nof the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing, you may\nregard it as done, for done it shall be, on the word and faith of\"--\n\n\"Hush!\" interrupted the stranger; \"I hear a noise.\"\n\n\"'Tis some travellers, who are visiting the Colosseum by torchlight.\"\n\n\"'Twere better we should not be seen together; those guides are nothing\nbut spies, and might possibly recognize you; and, however I may be\nhonored by your friendship, my worthy friend, if once the extent of our\nintimacy were known, I am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit\nwould suffer thereby.\"\n\n\"Well, then, if you obtain the reprieve?\"\n\n\"The middle window at the Cafe Rospoli will be hung with white damask,\nbearing a red cross.\"\n\n\"And if you fail?\"\n\n\"Then all three windows will have yellow draperies.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then, my good fellow, use your daggers in any way you please, and I\nfurther promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess.\"\n\n\"We understand each other perfectly, then. Adieu, your excellency;\ndepend upon me as firmly as I do upon you.\"\n\nSaying these words, the Transteverin disappeared down the staircase,\nwhile his companion, muffling his features more closely than before in\nthe folds of his mantle, passed almost close to Franz, and descended\nto the arena by an outward flight of steps. The next minute Franz heard\nhimself called by Albert, who made the lofty building re-echo with the\nsound of his friend's name. Franz, however, did not obey the summons\ntill he had satisfied himself that the two men whose conversation he had\noverheard were at a sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them\nin his descent. In ten minutes after the strangers had departed,\nFranz was on the road to the Piazza de Spagni, listening with studied\nindifference to the learned dissertation delivered by Albert, after the\nmanner of Pliny and Calpurnius, touching the iron-pointed nets used to\nprevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators. Franz let\nhim proceed without interruption, and, in fact, did not hear what\nwas said; he longed to be alone, and free to ponder over all that had\noccurred. One of the two men, whose mysterious meeting in the Colosseum\nhe had so unintentionally witnessed, was an entire stranger to him, but\nnot so the other; and though Franz had been unable to distinguish his\nfeatures, from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the\nshadow, the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on\nhim the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them,\nhear them when or where he might. It was more especially when this man\nwas speaking in a manner half jesting, half bitter, that Franz's ear\nrecalled most vividly the deep sonorous, yet well-pitched voice that had\naddressed him in the grotto of Monte Cristo, and which he heard for the\nsecond time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the Colosseum. And\nthe more he thought, the more entire was his conviction, that the person\nwho wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer,\n\"Sinbad the Sailor.\"\n\nUnder any other circumstances, Franz would have found it impossible to\nresist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage,\nand with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance; but\nin the present instance, the confidential nature of the conversation\nhe had overheard made him, with propriety, judge that his appearance at\nsuch a time would be anything but agreeable. As we have seen, therefore,\nhe permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition,\nbut fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance\nshould chance afford him another opportunity. In vain did Franz endeavor\nto forget the many perplexing thoughts which assailed him; in vain did\nhe court the refreshment of sleep. Slumber refused to visit his eyelids\nand the night was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of\ncircumstances tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant\nto the Colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of Monte Cristo; and\nthe more he thought, the firmer grew his opinion on the subject. Worn\nout at length, he fell asleep at daybreak, and did not awake till late.\nLike a genuine Frenchman, Albert had employed his time in arranging\nfor the evening's diversion; he had sent to engage a box at the Teatro\nArgentino; and Franz, having a number of letters to write, relinquished\nthe carriage to Albert for the whole of the day. At five o'clock Albert\nreturned, delighted with his day's work; he had been occupied in leaving\nhis letters of introduction, and had received in return more invitations\nto balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept; besides\nthis, he had seen (as he called it) all the remarkable sights at Rome.\nYes, in a single day he had accomplished what his more serious-minded\ncompanion would have taken weeks to effect. Neither had he neglected to\nascertain the name of the piece to be played that night at the Teatro\nArgentino, and also what performers appeared in it.\n\nThe opera of \"Parisina\" was announced for representation, and the\nprincipal actors were Coselli, Moriani, and La Specchia. The young men,\ntherefore, had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having the\nopportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of \"Lucia\ndi Lammermoor,\" supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of\nItaly. Albert had never been able to endure the Italian theatres, with\ntheir orchestras from which it is impossible to see, and the absence of\nbalconies, or open boxes; all these defects pressed hard on a man who\nhad had his stall at the Bouffes, and had shared a lower box at the\nOpera. Still, in spite of this, Albert displayed his most dazzling and\neffective costumes each time he visited the theatres; but, alas, his\nelegant toilet was wholly thrown away, and one of the most worthy\nrepresentatives of Parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying\nreflection that he had nearly overrun Italy without meeting with a\nsingle adventure.\n\nSometimes Albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success; but\ninternally he was deeply wounded, and his self-love immensely piqued, to\nthink that Albert de Morcerf, the most admired and most sought after of\nany young person of his day, should thus be passed over, and merely have\nhis labor for his pains. And the thing was so much the more annoying,\nas, according to the characteristic modesty of a Frenchman, Albert had\nquitted Paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself\nin Italy to carry all before him, and that upon his return he\nshould astonish the Parisian world with the recital of his numerous\nlove-affairs. Alas, poor Albert! none of those interesting adventures\nfell in his way; the lovely Genoese, Florentines, and Neapolitans were\nall faithful, if not to their husbands, at least to their lovers, and\nthought not of changing even for the splendid appearance of Albert de\nMorcerf; and all he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of\nItaly have this advantage over those of France, that they are faithful\neven in their infidelity. Yet he could not restrain a hope that in\nItaly, as elsewhere, there might be an exception to the general rule.\nAlbert, besides being an elegant, well-looking young man, was also\npossessed of considerable talent and ability; moreover, he was a\nviscount--a recently created one, certainly, but in the present day it\nis not necessary to go as far back as Noah in tracing a descent, and\na genealogical tree is equally estimated, whether dated from 1399\nor merely 1815; but to crown all these advantages, Albert de Morcerf\ncommanded an income of 50,000 livres, a more than sufficient sum to\nrender him a personage of considerable importance in Paris. It was\ntherefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the\nprincipal cities in Italy without having excited the most trifling\nobservation. Albert, however, hoped to indemnify himself for all these\nslights and indifferences during the Carnival, knowing full well that\namong the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is\ncelebrated, Rome is the spot where even the wisest and gravest throw off\nthe usual rigidity of their lives, and deign to mingle in the follies of\nthis time of liberty and relaxation.\n\nThe Carnival was to commence on the morrow; therefore Albert had not\nan instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes,\nexpectations, and claims to notice. With this design he had engaged a\nbox in the most conspicuous part of the theatre, and exerted himself\nto set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and\nelaborate toilet. The box taken by Albert was in the first circle;\nalthough each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally\naristocratic, and is, for this reason, generally styled the \"nobility's\nboxes,\" and although the box engaged for the two friends was\nsufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen persons, it had cost\nless than would be paid at some of the French theatres for one admitting\nmerely four occupants. Another motive had influenced Albert's selection\nof his seat,--who knew but that, thus advantageously placed, he might\nnot in truth attract the notice of some fair Roman, and an introduction\nmight ensue that would procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage, or\na place in a princely balcony, from which he might behold the gayeties\nof the Carnival? These united considerations made Albert more lively and\nanxious to please than he had hitherto been. Totally disregarding the\nbusiness of the stage, he leaned from his box and began attentively\nscrutinizing the beauty of each pretty woman, aided by a powerful\nopera-glass; but, alas, this attempt to attract notice wholly failed;\nnot even curiosity had been excited, and it was but too apparent\nthat the lovely creatures, into whose good graces he was desirous of\nstealing, were all so much engrossed with themselves, their lovers,\nor their own thoughts, that they had not so much as noticed him or the\nmanipulation of his glass.\n\nThe truth was, that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival, with the\n\"holy week\" that was to succeed it, so filled every fair breast, as to\nprevent the least attention being bestowed even on the business of the\nstage. The actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought\nof; at certain conventional moments, the spectators would suddenly cease\ntheir conversation, or rouse themselves from their musings, to listen\nto some brilliant effort of Moriani's, a well-executed recitative by\nCoselli, or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers of La\nSpecchia; but that momentary excitement over, they quickly relapsed into\ntheir former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation. Towards\nthe close of the first act, the door of a box which had been hitherto\nvacant was opened; a lady entered to whom Franz had been introduced in\nParis, where indeed, he had imagined she still was. The quick eye of\nAlbert caught the involuntary start with which his friend beheld the new\narrival, and, turning to him, he said hastily, \"Do you know the woman\nwho has just entered that box?\"\n\n\"Yes; what do you think of her?\"\n\n\"Oh, she is perfectly lovely--what a complexion! And such magnificent\nhair! Is she French?\"\n\n\"No; a Venetian.\"\n\n\"And her name is--\"\n\n\"Countess G----.\"\n\n\"Ah, I know her by name!\" exclaimed Albert; \"she is said to possess as\nmuch wit and cleverness as beauty. I was to have been presented to her\nwhen I met her at Madame Villefort's ball.\"\n\n\"Shall I assist you in repairing your negligence?\" asked Franz.\n\n\"My dear fellow, are you really on such good terms with her as to\nventure to take me to her box?\"\n\n\"Why, I have only had the honor of being in her society and conversing\nwith her three or four times in my life; but you know that even such\nan acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask.\" At that\ninstant, the countess perceived Franz, and graciously waved her hand to\nhim, to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head. \"Upon\nmy word,\" said Albert, \"you seem to be on excellent terms with the\nbeautiful countess.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken in thinking so,\" returned Franz calmly; \"but you\nmerely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to\ncommit the most egregious blunders,--I mean that of judging the habits\nand customs of Italy and Spain by our Parisian notions; believe me,\nnothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of\nintimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar terms\nthey seem upon; there is a similarity of feeling at this instant between\nourselves and the countess--nothing more.\"\n\n\"Is there, indeed, my good fellow? Pray tell me, is it sympathy of\nheart?\"\n\n\"No; of taste,\" continued Franz gravely.\n\n\"And in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced?\"\n\n\"By the countess's visiting the Colosseum, as we did last night, by\nmoonlight, and nearly alone.\"\n\n\"You were with her, then?\"\n\n\"I was.\"\n\n\"And what did you say to her?\"\n\n\"Oh, we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is\na glorious monument!\"\n\n\"Upon my word,\" cried Albert, \"you must have been a very entertaining\ncompanion alone, or all but alone, with a beautiful woman in such a\nplace of sentiment as the Colosseum, and yet to find nothing better a\ntalk about than the dead! All I can say is, if ever I should get such a\nchance, the living should be my theme.\"\n\n\"And you will probably find your theme ill-chosen.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Albert, breaking in upon his discourse, \"never mind the\npast; let us only remember the present. Are you not going to keep your\npromise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks?\"\n\n\"Certainly, directly the curtain falls on the stage.\"\n\n\"What a confounded time this first act takes. I believe, on my soul,\nthat they never mean to finish it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, they will; only listen to that charming finale. How\nexquisitely Coselli sings his part.\"\n\n\"But what an awkward, inelegant fellow he is.\"\n\n\"Well, then, what do you say to La Specchia? Did you ever see anything\nmore perfect than her acting?\"\n\n\"Why, you know, my dear fellow, when one has been accustomed to Malibran\nand Sontag, such singers as these don't make the same impression on you\nthey perhaps do on others.\"\n\n\"At least, you must admire Moriani's style and execution.\"\n\n\"I never fancied men of his dark, ponderous appearance singing with a\nvoice like a woman's.\"\n\n\"My good friend,\" said Franz, turning to him, while Albert continued to\npoint his glass at every box in the theatre, \"you seem determined not to\napprove; you are really too difficult to please.\" The curtain at length\nfell on the performances, to the infinite satisfaction of the Viscount\nof Morcerf, who seized his hat, rapidly passed his fingers through his\nhair, arranged his cravat and wristbands, and signified to Franz that he\nwas waiting for him to lead the way. Franz, who had mutely interrogated\nthe countess, and received from her a gracious smile in token that he\nwould be welcome, sought not to retard the gratification of Albert's\neager impatience, but began at once the tour of the house, closely\nfollowed by Albert, who availed himself of the few minutes required\nto reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle the height and\nsmoothness of his collar, and to arrange the lappets of his coat. This\nimportant task was just completed as they arrived at the countess's box.\nAt the knock, the door was immediately opened, and the young man who\nwas seated beside the countess, in obedience to the Italian custom,\ninstantly rose and surrendered his place to the strangers, who, in turn,\nwould be expected to retire upon the arrival of other visitors.\n\nFranz presented Albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the\nday, both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents;\nnor did he say more than the truth, for in Paris and the circle in\nwhich the viscount moved, he was looked upon and cited as a model of\nperfection. Franz added that his companion, deeply grieved at having\nbeen prevented the honor of being presented to the countess during her\nsojourn in Paris, was most anxious to make up for it, and had requested\nhim (Franz) to remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box,\nand concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken\nit upon himself to do so. The countess, in reply, bowed gracefully to\nAlbert, and extended her hand with cordial kindness to Franz; then,\ninviting Albert to take the vacant seat beside her, she recommended\nFranz to take the next best, if he wished to view the ballet, and\npointed to the one behind her own chair. Albert was soon deeply\nengrossed in discoursing upon Paris and Parisian matters, speaking\nto the countess of the various persons they both knew there. Franz\nperceived how completely he was in his element; and, unwilling to\ninterfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt, took up Albert's\nglass, and began in his turn to survey the audience. Sitting alone, in\nthe front of a box immediately opposite, but situated on the third\nrow, was a woman of exquisite beauty, dressed in a Greek costume, which\nevidently, from the ease and grace with which she wore it, was her\nnational attire. Behind her, but in deep shadow, was the outline of a\nmasculine figure; but the features of this latter personage it was not\npossible to distinguish. Franz could not forbear breaking in upon the\napparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and\nAlbert, to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair Albanian\nopposite, since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by\neither sex. \"All I can tell about her,\" replied the countess, \"is, that\nshe has been at Rome since the beginning of the season; for I saw her\nwhere she now sits the very first night of the season, and since then\nshe has never missed a performance. Sometimes she is accompanied by the\nperson who is now with her, and at others she is merely attended by a\nblack servant.\"\n\n\"And what do you think of her personal appearance?\"\n\n\"Oh, I consider her perfectly lovely--she is just my idea of what Medora\nmust have been.\"\n\nFranz and the countess exchanged a smile, and then the latter resumed\nher conversation with Albert, while Franz returned to his previous\nsurvey of the house and company. The curtain rose on the ballet, which\nwas one of those excellent specimens of the Italian school, admirably\narranged and put on the stage by Henri, who has established for himself\na great reputation throughout Italy for his taste and skill in the\nchoreographic art--one of those masterly productions of grace, method,\nand elegance in which the whole corps de ballet, from the principal\ndancers to the humblest supernumerary, are all engaged on the stage at\nthe same time; and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting\nthe same attitude, or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous\nmovement, that would lead you to suppose that but one mind, one act of\nvolition, influenced the moving mass--the ballet was called \"Poliska.\"\nHowever much the ballet might have claimed his attention, Franz was too\ndeeply occupied with the beautiful Greek to take any note of it; while\nshe seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it, her\neager, animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference\nof her companion, who, during the whole time the piece lasted, never\neven moved, not even when the furious, crashing din produced by the\ntrumpets, cymbals, and Chinese bells sounded their loudest from the\norchestra. Of this he took no heed, but was, as far as appearances might\nbe trusted, enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams. The ballet\nat length came to a close, and the curtain fell amid the loud, unanimous\nplaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience.\n\nOwing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera\nwith a ballet, the pauses between the performances are very short, the\nsingers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change\ntheir costume, when necessary, while the dancers are executing their\npirouettes and exhibiting their graceful steps. The overture to the\nsecond act began; and, at the first sound of the leader's bow across his\nviolin, Franz observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the Greek\ngirl, who turned around to say a few words to him, and then, leaning\nforward again on the railing of her box, she became as absorbed as\nbefore in what was going on. The countenance of the person who had\naddressed her remained so completely in the shade, that, though Franz\ntried his utmost, he could not distinguish a single feature. The curtain\nrose, and the attention of Franz was attracted by the actors; and his\neyes turned from the box containing the Greek girl and her strange\ncompanion to watch the business of the stage.\n\nMost of my readers are aware that the second act of \"Parisina\" opens\nwith the celebrated and effective duet in which Parisina, while\nsleeping, betrays to Azzo the secret of her love for Ugo. The injured\nhusband goes through all the emotions of jealousy, until conviction\nseizes on his mind, and then, in a frenzy of rage and indignation,\nhe awakens his guilty wife to tell her that he knows her guilt and to\nthreaten her with his vengeance. This duet is one of the most beautiful,\nexpressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the\nfruitful pen of Donizetti. Franz now listened to it for the third\ntime; yet its notes, so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as\nthe wretched husband and wife give vent to their different griefs and\npassions, thrilled through the soul of Franz with an effect equal to his\nfirst emotions upon hearing it. Excited beyond his usual calm\ndemeanor, Franz rose with the audience, and was about to join the\nloud, enthusiastic applause that followed; but suddenly his purpose was\narrested, his hands fell by his sides, and the half-uttered \"bravos\"\nexpired on his lips. The occupant of the box in which the Greek girl sat\nappeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed; for he left\nhis seat to stand up in front, so that, his countenance being fully\nrevealed, Franz had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious\ninhabitant of Monte Cristo, and the very same person he had encountered\nthe preceding evening in the ruins of the Colosseum, and whose voice and\nfigure had seemed so familiar to him. All doubt of his identity was now\nat an end; his singular host evidently resided at Rome. The surprise\nand agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of Franz's former\nsuspicion had no doubt imparted a corresponding expression to his\nfeatures; for the countess, after gazing with a puzzled look at\nhis face, burst into a fit of laughter, and begged to know what had\nhappened. \"Countess,\" returned Franz, totally unheeding her raillery, \"I\nasked you a short time since if you knew any particulars respecting the\nAlbanian lady opposite; I must now beseech you to inform me who and what\nis her husband?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" answered the countess, \"I know no more of him than yourself.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you never before noticed him?\"\n\n\"What a question--so truly French! Do you not know that we Italians have\neyes only for the man we love?\"\n\n\"True,\" replied Franz.\n\n\"All I can say is,\" continued the countess, taking up the lorgnette,\nand directing it toward the box in question, \"that the gentleman, whose\nhistory I am unable to furnish, seems to me as though he had just\nbeen dug up; he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly\ngrave-digger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of\nours, than anything human. How ghastly pale he is!\"\n\n\"Oh, he is always as colorless as you now see him,\" said Franz.\n\n\"Then you know him?\" almost screamed the countess. \"Oh, pray do, for\nheaven's sake, tell us all about--is he a vampire, or a resuscitated\ncorpse, or what?\"\n\n\"I fancy I have seen him before; and I even think he recognizes me.\"\n\n\"And I can well understand,\" said the countess, shrugging up her\nbeautiful shoulders, as though an involuntary shudder passed through her\nveins, \"that those who have once seen that man will never be likely\nto forget him.\" The sensation experienced by Franz was evidently not\npeculiar to himself; another, and wholly uninterested person, felt the\nsame unaccountable awe and misgiving. \"Well.\" inquired Franz, after the\ncountess had a second time directed her lorgnette at the box, \"what do\nyou think of our opposite neighbor?\"\n\n\"Why, that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living form.\"\nThis fresh allusion to Byron [*] drew a smile to Franz's countenance;\nalthough he could but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief\nin the existence of vampires, it would be the presence of such a man as\nthe mysterious personage before him.\n\n\"I must positively find out who and what he is,\" said Franz, rising from\nhis seat.\n\n\"No, no,\" cried the countess; \"you must not leave me. I depend upon you\nto escort me home. Oh, indeed, I cannot permit you to go.\"\n\n     * Scott, of course: \"The son of an ill-fated sire, and the\n     father of a yet more unfortunate family, bore in his looks\n     that cast of inauspicious melancholy by which the\n     physiognomists of that time pretended to distinguish those\n     who were predestined to a violent and unhappy death.\"--The\n     Abbot, ch. xxii.\n\n\"Is it possible,\" whispered Franz, \"that you entertain any fear?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" answered the countess. \"Byron had the most perfect\nbelief in the existence of vampires, and even assured me that he had\nseen them. The description he gave me perfectly corresponds with\nthe features and character of the man before us. Oh, he is the exact\npersonification of what I have been led to expect! The coal-black hair,\nlarge bright, glittering eyes, in which a wild, unearthly fire seems\nburning,--the same ghastly paleness. Then observe, too, that the\nwoman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex. She is a\nforeigner--a stranger. Nobody knows who she is, or where she comes from.\nNo doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does, and is, like\nhimself, a dealer in magical arts. I entreat of you not to go near\nhim--at least to-night; and if to-morrow your curiosity still continues\nas great, pursue your researches if you will; but to-night you neither\ncan nor shall. For that purpose I mean to keep you all to myself.\" Franz\nprotested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day, for\nmany reasons. \"Listen to me,\" said the countess, \"and do not be so very\nheadstrong. I am going home. I have a party at my house to-night, and\ntherefore cannot possibly remain till the end of the opera. Now, I\ncannot for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a\nlady your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it.\"\n\nThere was nothing else left for Franz to do but to take up his hat,\nopen the door of the box, and offer the countess his arm. It was quite\nevident, by her manner, that her uneasiness was not feigned; and Franz\nhimself could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread--so much\nthe stronger in him, as it arose from a variety of corroborative\nrecollections, while the terror of the countess sprang from an\ninstinctive belief, originally created in her mind by the wild tales she\nhad listened to till she believed them truths. Franz could even feel her\narm tremble as he assisted her into the carriage. Upon arriving at\nher hotel, Franz perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of\nexpecting company; on the contrary, her own return before the appointed\nhour seemed greatly to astonish the servants. \"Excuse my little\nsubterfuge,\" said the countess, in reply to her companion's\nhalf-reproachful observation on the subject; \"but that horrid man had\nmade me feel quite uncomfortable, and I longed to be alone, that I might\ncompose my startled mind.\" Franz essayed to smile. \"Nay,\" said she, \"do\nnot smile; it ill accords with the expression of your countenance, and\nI am sure it does not spring from your heart. However, promise me one\nthing.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Promise me, I say.\"\n\n\"I will do anything you desire, except relinquish my determination of\nfinding out who this man is. I have more reasons than you can imagine\nfor desiring to know who he is, from whence he came, and whither he is\ngoing.\"\n\n\"Where he comes from I am ignorant; but I can readily tell you where he\nis going to, and that is down below, without the least doubt.\"\n\n\"Let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make,\" said Franz.\n\n\"Well, then, you must give me your word to return immediately to your\nhotel, and make no attempt to follow this man to-night. There are\ncertain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet\nafterwards. For heaven's sake, do not serve as a conductor between that\nman and me. Pursue your chase after him to-morrow as eagerly as you\nplease; but never bring him near me, if you would not see me die of\nterror. And now, good-night; go to your rooms, and try to sleep away all\nrecollections of this evening. For my own part, I am quite sure I shall\nnot be able to close my eyes.\" So saying, the countess quitted Franz,\nleaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at\nhis expense, or whether her fears and agitations were genuine.\n\nUpon his return to the hotel, Franz found Albert in his dressing-gown\nand slippers, listlessly extended on a sofa, smoking a cigar. \"My dear\nfellow.\" cried he, springing up, \"is it really you? Why, I did not\nexpect to see you before to-morrow.\"\n\n\"My dear Albert,\" replied Franz, \"I am glad of this opportunity to\ntell you, once and forever, that you entertain a most erroneous notion\nconcerning Italian women. I should have thought the continual failures\nyou have met with in all your own love affairs might have taught you\nbetter by this time.\"\n\n\"Upon my soul, these women would puzzle the very Devil to read them\naright. Why, here--they give you their hand--they press yours in\nreturn--they keep up a whispering conversation--permit you to accompany\nthem home. Why, if a Parisian were to indulge in a quarter of these\nmarks of flattering attention, her reputation would be gone forever.\"\n\n\"And the very reason why the women of this fine country put so little\nrestraint on their words and actions, is because they live so much\nin public, and have really nothing to conceal. Besides, you must have\nperceived that the countess was really alarmed.\"\n\n\"At what? At the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting opposite to\nus in the same box with the lovely Greek girl? Now, for my part, I met\nthem in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece; and hang me, if\nI can guess where you took your notions of the other world from. I\ncan assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine-looking\nfellow--admirably dressed. Indeed, I feel quite sure, from the cut of\nhis clothes, they are made by a first-rate Paris tailor--probably\nBlin or Humann. He was rather too pale, certainly; but then, you know,\npaleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent\nand distinguished breeding.\" Franz smiled; for he well remembered that\nAlbert particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his\nown complexion.\n\n\"Well, that tends to confirm my own ideas,\" said Franz, \"that the\ncountess's suspicions were destitute alike of sense and reason. Did he\nspeak in your hearing? and did you catch any of his words?\"\n\n\"I did; but they were uttered in the Romaic dialect. I knew that from\nthe mixture of Greek words. I don't know whether I ever told you that\nwhen I was at college I was rather--rather strong in Greek.\"\n\n\"He spoke the Romaic language, did he?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"That settles it,\" murmured Franz. \"'Tis he, past all doubt.\"\n\n\"What do you say?\"\n\n\"Nothing, nothing. But tell me, what were you thinking about when I came\nin?\"\n\n\"Oh, I was arranging a little surprise for you.\"\n\n\"Indeed. Of what nature?\"\n\n\"Why, you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage.\"\n\n\"Certainly; and I also know that we have done all that human means\nafforded to endeavor to get one.\"\n\n\"Now, then, in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my\nbrain.\" Franz looked at Albert as though he had not much confidence in\nthe suggestions of his imagination. \"I tell you what, Sir Franz,\"\ncried Albert, \"you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and\nincredulous glance as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now.\"\n\n\"And I promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your\nscheme turns out as ingenious as you assert.\"\n\n\"Well, then, hearken to me.\"\n\n\"I listen.\"\n\n\"You agree, do you not, that obtaining a carriage is out of the\nquestion?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Neither can we procure horses?\"\n\n\"True; we have offered any sum, but have failed.\"\n\n\"Well, now, what do you say to a cart? I dare say such a thing might be\nhad.\"\n\n\"Very possibly.\"\n\n\"And a pair of oxen?\"\n\n\"As easily found as the cart.\"\n\n\"Then you see, my good fellow, with a cart and a couple of oxen our\nbusiness can be managed. The cart must be tastefully ornamented; and\nif you and I dress ourselves as Neapolitan reapers, we may get up a\nstriking tableau, after the manner of that splendid picture by Leopold\nRobert. It would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join\nus in the costume of a peasant from Puzzoli or Sorrento. Our group\nwould then be quite complete, more especially as the countess is quite\nbeautiful enough to represent a madonna.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Franz, \"this time, Albert, I am bound to give you credit\nfor having hit upon a most capital idea.\"\n\n\"And quite a national one, too,\" replied Albert with gratified pride.\n\"A mere masque borrowed from our own festivities. Ha, ha, ye Romans!\nyou thought to make us, unhappy strangers, trot at the heels of your\nprocessions, like so many lazzaroni, because no carriages or horses are\nto be had in your beggarly city. But you don't know us; when we can't\nhave one thing we invent another.\"\n\n\"And have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody?\"\n\n\"Only to our host. Upon my return home I sent for him, and I then\nexplained to him what I wished to procure. He assured me that nothing\nwould be easier than to furnish all I desired. One thing I was sorry\nfor; when I bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded, he told me there\nwould not be time, as it would require three days to do that; so you see\nwe must do without this little superfluity.\"\n\n\"And where is he now?\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Our host.\"\n\n\"Gone out in search of our equipage, by to-morrow it might be too late.\"\n\n\"Then he will be able to give us an answer to-night.\"\n\n\"Oh, I expect him every minute.\" At this instant the door opened, and\nthe head of Signor Pastrini appeared. \"Permesso?\" inquired he.\n\n\"Certainly--certainly,\" cried Franz. \"Come in, mine host.\"\n\n\"Now, then,\" asked Albert eagerly, \"have you found the desired cart and\noxen?\"\n\n\"Better than that!\" replied Signor Pastrini, with the air of a man\nperfectly well satisfied with himself.\n\n\"Take care, my worthy host,\" said Albert, \"better is a sure enemy to\nwell.\"\n\n\"Let your excellencies only leave the matter to me,\" returned Signor\nPastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self-confidence.\n\n\"But what have you done?\" asked Franz. \"Speak out, there's a worthy\nfellow.\"\n\n\"Your excellencies are aware,\" responded the landlord, swelling with\nimportance, \"that the Count of Monte Cristo is living on the same floor\nwith yourselves!\"\n\n\"I should think we did know it,\" exclaimed Albert, \"since it is owing\nto that circumstance that we are packed into these small rooms, like two\npoor students in the back streets of Paris.\"\n\n\"When, then, the Count of Monte Cristo, hearing of the dilemma in which\nyou are placed, has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two\nplaces at his windows in the Palazzo Rospoli.\" The friends looked at\neach other with unutterable surprise.\n\n\"But do you think,\" asked Albert, \"that we ought to accept such offers\nfrom a perfect stranger?\"\n\n\"What sort of person is this Count of Monte Cristo?\" asked Franz of his\nhost. \"A very great nobleman, but whether Maltese or Sicilian I cannot\nexactly say; but this I know, that he is noble as a Borghese and rich as\na gold-mine.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Franz, speaking in an undertone to Albert, \"that\nif this person merited the high panegyrics of our landlord, he would\nhave conveyed his invitation through another channel, and not permitted\nit to be brought to us in this unceremonious way. He would have\nwritten--or\"--\n\nAt this instant some one knocked at the door. \"Come in,\" said Franz. A\nservant, wearing a livery of considerable style and richness, appeared\nat the threshold, and, placing two cards in the landlord's hands, who\nforthwith presented them to the two young men, he said, \"Please to\ndeliver these, from the Count of Monte Cristo to Viscomte Albert de\nMorcerf and M. Franz d'Epinay. The Count of Monte Cristo,\" continued the\nservant, \"begs these gentlemen's permission to wait upon them as their\nneighbor, and he will be honored by an intimation of what time they will\nplease to receive him.\"\n\n\"Faith, Franz,\" whispered Albert, \"there is not much to find fault with\nhere.\"\n\n\"Tell the count,\" replied Franz, \"that we will do ourselves the pleasure\nof calling on him.\" The servant bowed and retired.\n\n\"That is what I call an elegant mode of attack,\" said Albert, \"You were\nquite correct in what you said, Signor Pastrini. The Count of Monte\nCristo is unquestionably a man of first-rate breeding and knowledge of\nthe world.\"\n\n\"Then you accept his offer?\" said the host.\n\n\"Of course we do,\" replied Albert. \"Still, I must own I am sorry to\nbe obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapers--it would have\nproduced such an effect! And were it not for the windows at the Palazzo\nRospoli, by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme, I\ndon't know but what I should have held on by my original plan. What say\nyou, Franz?\"\n\n\"Oh, I agree with you; the windows in the Palazzo Rospoli alone decided\nme.\" The truth was, that the mention of two places in the Palazzo\nRospoli had recalled to Franz the conversation he had overheard the\npreceding evening in the ruins of the Colosseum between the mysterious\nunknown and the Transteverin, in which the stranger in the cloak had\nundertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal; and if this\nmuffled-up individual proved (as Franz felt sure he would) the same as\nthe person he had just seen in the Teatro Argentino, then he should be\nable to establish his identity, and also to prosecute his researches\nrespecting him with perfect facility and freedom. Franz passed the night\nin confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with\nhis mysterious tormentor, and in waking speculations as to what the\nmorrow would produce. The next day must clear up every doubt; and\nunless his near neighbor and would-be friend, the Count of Monte Cristo,\npossessed the ring of Gyges, and by its power was able to render himself\ninvisible, it was very certain he could not escape this time. Eight\no'clock found Franz up and dressed, while Albert, who had not the same\nmotives for early rising, was still soundly asleep. The first act\nof Franz was to summon his landlord, who presented himself with his\naccustomed obsequiousness.\n\n\"Pray, Signor Pastrini,\" asked Franz, \"is not some execution appointed\nto take place to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes, your excellency; but if your reason for inquiry is that you may\nprocure a window to view it from, you are much too late.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" answered Franz, \"I had no such intention; and even if I had\nfelt a wish to witness the spectacle, I might have done so from Monte\nPincio--could I not?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed mine host, \"I did not think it likely your excellency\nwould have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected\non that hill, which, indeed, they consider as exclusively belonging to\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"Very possibly I may not go,\" answered Franz; \"but in case I feel\ndisposed, give me some particulars of to-day's executions.\"\n\n\"What particulars would your excellency like to hear?\"\n\n\"Why, the number of persons condemned to suffer, their names, and\ndescription of the death they are to die.\"\n\n\"That happens just lucky, your excellency! Only a few minutes ago they\nbrought me the tavolettas.\"\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"Sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the evening\nbefore an execution, on which is pasted up a paper containing the names\nof the condemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment. The\nreason for so publicly announcing all this is, that all good and\nfaithful Catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate\nculprits, and, above all, beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere\nrepentance.\"\n\n\"And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to\nthose of the faithful, are they?\" asked Franz somewhat incredulously.\n\n\"Oh, dear, no, your excellency! I have not time for anybody's affairs\nbut my own and those of my honorable guests; but I make an agreement\nwith the man who pastes up the papers, and he brings them to me as he\nwould the playbills, that in case any person staying at my hotel should\nlike to witness an execution, he may obtain every requisite information\nconcerning the time and place etc.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, that is a most delicate attention on your part, Signor\nPastrini,\" cried Franz.\n\n\"Why, your excellency,\" returned the landlord, chuckling and rubbing his\nhands with infinite complacency, \"I think I may take upon myself to\nsay I neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage of the noble\nvisitors to this poor hotel.\"\n\n\"I see that plainly enough, my most excellent host, and you may rely\nupon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your\nguests wherever I go. Meanwhile, oblige me by a sight of one of these\ntavolettas.\"\n\n\"Nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency's wish,\" said\nthe landlord, opening the door of the chamber; \"I have caused one to be\nplaced on the landing, close by your apartment.\" Then, taking the tablet\nfrom the wall, he handed it to Franz, who read as follows:--\n\n\"'The public is informed that on Wednesday, February 23d, being the\nfirst day of the Carnival, executions will take place in the Piazza\ndel Popolo, by order of the Tribunal of the Rota, of two persons, named\nAndrea Rondola, and Peppino, otherwise called Rocca Priori; the former\nfound guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest, named\nDon Cesare Torlini, canon of the church of St. John Lateran; and the\nlatter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary\nbandit, Luigi Vampa, and his band. The first-named malefactor will be\nsubjected to the mazzuola, the second culprit beheaded. The prayers of\nall good Christians are entreated for these unfortunate men, that it may\nplease God to awaken them to a sense of their guilt, and to grant them a\nhearty and sincere repentance for their crimes.'\"\n\nThis was precisely what Franz had heard the evening before in the ruins\nof the Colosseum. No part of the programme differed,--the names of the\ncondemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment, all agreed\nwith his previous information. In all probability, therefore, the\nTransteverin was no other than the bandit Luigi Vampa himself, and the\nman shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as \"Sinbad the Sailor,\"\nbut who, no doubt, was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition\nin Rome, as he had already done at Porto-Vecchio and Tunis. Time was\ngetting on, however, and Franz deemed it advisable to awaken Albert; but\nat the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber, his friend entered\nthe room in perfect costume for the day. The anticipated delights of\nthe Carnival had so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long\nbefore his usual hour. \"Now, my excellent Signor Pastrini,\" said Franz,\naddressing his landlord, \"since we are both ready, do you think we may\nproceed at once to visit the Count of Monte Cristo?\"\n\n\"Most assuredly,\" replied he. \"The Count of Monte Cristo is always an\nearly riser; and I can answer for his having been up these two hours.\"\n\n\"Then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our\nrespects to him directly?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am quite sure. I will take all the blame on myself if you find I\nhave led you into an error.\"\n\n\"Well, then, if it be so, are you ready, Albert?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy.\"\n\n\"Yes, let us do so.\" The landlord preceded the friends across the\nlanding, which was all that separated them from the apartments of the\ncount, rang at the bell, and, upon the door being opened by a servant,\nsaid, \"I signori Francesi.\"\n\nThe domestic bowed respectfully, and invited them to enter. They passed\nthrough two rooms, furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected\nto see under the roof of Signor Pastrini, and were shown into an\nelegantly fitted-up drawing-room. The richest Turkey carpets covered\nthe floor, and the softest and most inviting couches, easy-chairs, and\nsofas, offered their high-piled and yielding cushions to such as desired\nrepose or refreshment. Splendid paintings by the first masters were\nranged against the walls, intermingled with magnificent trophies of\nwar, while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the\ndifferent doors of the room. \"If your excellencies will please to be\nseated,\" said the man, \"I will let the count know that you are here.\"\n\nAnd with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried\nportieres. As the door opened, the sound of a guzla reached the ears of\nthe young men, but was almost immediately lost, for the rapid closing\nof the door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter. Franz\nand Albert looked inquiringly at each other, then at the gorgeous\nfurnishings of the apartment. Everything seemed more magnificent at a\nsecond view than it had done at their first rapid survey.\n\n\"Well,\" said Franz to his friend, \"what think you of all this?\"\n\n\"Why, upon my soul, my dear fellow, it strikes me that our elegant and\nattentive neighbor must either be some successful stock-jobber who has\nspeculated in the fall of the Spanish funds, or some prince travelling\nincog.\"\n\n\"Hush, hush!\" replied Franz; \"we shall ascertain who and what he is--he\ncomes!\" As Franz spoke, he heard the sound of a door turning on its\nhinges, and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside,\nand the owner of all these riches stood before the two young men. Albert\ninstantly rose to meet him, but Franz remained, in a manner, spellbound\non his chair; for in the person of him who had just entered he\nrecognized not only the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum, and the\noccupant of the box at the Teatro Argentino, but also his extraordinary\nhost of Monte Cristo.\n\n\n\nChapter 35. La Mazzolata.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the Count of Monte Cristo as he entered, \"I pray you\nexcuse me for suffering my visit to be anticipated; but I feared to\ndisturb you by presenting myself earlier at your apartments; besides,\nyou sent me word that you would come to me, and I have held myself at\nyour disposal.\"\n\n\"Franz and I have to thank you a thousand times, count,\" returned\nAlbert; \"you extricated us from a great dilemma, and we were on\nthe point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly\ninvitation reached us.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" returned the count, motioning the two young men to sit down.\n\"It was the fault of that blockhead Pastrini, that I did not sooner\nassist you in your distress. He did not mention a syllable of your\nembarrassment to me, when he knows that, alone and isolated as I am, I\nseek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors. As\nsoon as I learned I could in any way assist you, I most eagerly seized\nthe opportunity of offering my services.\" The two young men bowed. Franz\nhad, as yet, found nothing to say; he had come to no determination,\nand as nothing in the count's manner manifested the wish that he should\nrecognize him, he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past,\nor wait until he had more proof; besides, although sure it was he\nwho had been in the box the previous evening, he could not be equally\npositive that this was the man he had seen at the Colosseum. He\nresolved, therefore, to let things take their course without making any\ndirect overture to the count. Moreover, he had this advantage, he was\nmaster of the count's secret, while the count had no hold on Franz, who\nhad nothing to conceal. However, he resolved to lead the conversation to\na subject which might possibly clear up his doubts.\n\n\"Count,\" said he, \"you have offered us places in your carriage, and at\nyour windows in the Rospoli Palace. Can you tell us where we can obtain\na sight of the Piazza del Popolo?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the count negligently, looking attentively at Morcerf, \"is\nthere not something like an execution upon the Piazza del Popolo?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Franz, finding that the count was coming to the point he\nwished.\n\n\"Stay, I think I told my steward yesterday to attend to this; perhaps I\ncan render you this slight service also.\" He extended his hand, and rang\nthe bell thrice. \"Did you ever occupy yourself,\" said he to Franz, \"with\nthe employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your\nservants? I have. When I ring once, it is for my valet; twice, for my\nmajordomo; thrice, for my steward,--thus I do not waste a minute or a\nword. Here he is.\" A man of about forty-five or fifty entered, exactly\nresembling the smuggler who had introduced Franz into the cavern; but\nhe did not appear to recognize him. It was evident he had his orders.\n\"Monsieur Bertuccio,\" said the count, \"you have procured me windows\nlooking on the Piazza del Popolo, as I ordered you yesterday.\"\n\n\"Yes, excellency,\" returned the steward; \"but it was very late.\"\n\n\"Did I not tell you I wished for one?\" replied the count, frowning.\n\n\"And your excellency has one, which was let to Prince Lobanieff; but I\nwas obliged to pay a hundred\"--\n\n\"That will do--that will do, Monsieur Bertuccio; spare these gentlemen\nall such domestic arrangements. You have the window, that is sufficient.\nGive orders to the coachman; and be in readiness on the stairs to\nconduct us to it.\" The steward bowed, and was about to quit the room.\n\"Ah,\" continued the count, \"be good enough to ask Pastrini if he\nhas received the tavoletta, and if he can send us an account of the\nexecution.\"\n\n\"There is no need to do that,\" said Franz, taking out his tablets; \"for\nI saw the account, and copied it down.\"\n\n\"Very well, you can retire, M. Bertuccio; but let us know when breakfast\nis ready. These gentlemen,\" added he, turning to the two friends, \"will,\nI trust, do me the honor to breakfast with me?\"\n\n\"But, my dear count,\" said Albert, \"we shall abuse your kindness.\"\n\n\"Not at all; on the contrary, you will give me great pleasure. You\nwill, one or other of you, perhaps both, return it to me at Paris. M.\nBertuccio, lay covers for three.\" He then took Franz's tablets out of\nhis hand. \"'We announce,' he read, in the same tone with which he\nwould have read a newspaper, 'that to-day, the 23d of February, will be\nexecuted Andrea Rondolo, guilty of murder on the person of the respected\nand venerated Don Cesare Torlini, canon of the church of St. John\nLateran, and Peppino, called Rocca Priori, convicted of complicity with\nthe detestable bandit Luigi Vampa, and the men of his band.' Hum! 'The\nfirst will be mazzolato, the second decapitato.' Yes,\" continued\nthe count, \"it was at first arranged in this way; but I think since\nyesterday some change has taken place in the order of the ceremony.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Franz.\n\n\"Yes, I passed the evening at the Cardinal Rospigliosi's, and there\nmention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men.\"\n\n\"For Andrea Rondolo?\" asked Franz.\n\n\"No,\" replied the count, carelessly; \"for the other (he glanced at the\ntablets as if to recall the name), for Peppino, called Rocca Priori. You\nare thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined; but the mazzuola still\nremains, which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first\ntime, and even the second, while the other, as you must know, is very\nsimple. The mandaia [*] never fails, never trembles, never strikes thirty\ntimes ineffectually, like the soldier who beheaded the Count of Chalais,\nand to whose tender mercy Richelieu had doubtless recommended the\nsufferer. Ah,\" added the count, in a contemptuous tone, \"do not tell me\nof European punishments, they are in the infancy, or rather the old age,\nof cruelty.\"\n\n     * Guillotine.\n\n\"Really, count,\" replied Franz, \"one would think that you had studied\nthe different tortures of all the nations of the world.\"\n\n\"There are, at least, few that I have not seen,\" said the count coldly.\n\n\"And you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles?\"\n\n\"My first sentiment was horror, the second indifference, the third\ncuriosity.\"\n\n\"Curiosity--that is a terrible word.\"\n\n\"Why so? In life, our greatest preoccupation is death; is it not then,\ncurious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can part;\nand how, according to their different characters, temperaments, and even\nthe different customs of their countries, different persons bear the\ntransition from life to death, from existence to annihilation? As for\nmyself, I can assure you of one thing,--the more men you see die, the\neasier it becomes to die yourself; and in my opinion, death may be a\ntorture, but it is not an expiation.\"\n\n\"I do not quite understand you,\" replied Franz; \"pray explain your\nmeaning, for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said the count, and deep hatred mounted to his face, as the\nblood would to the face of any other. \"If a man had by unheard-of\nand excruciating tortures destroyed your father, your mother, your\nbetrothed,--a being who, when torn from you, left a desolation, a wound\nthat never closes, in your breast,--do you think the reparation that\nsociety gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the\nguillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of\nthe murderer, and allows him who has caused us years of moral sufferings\nto escape with a few moments of physical pain?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Franz, \"that human justice is insufficient to\nconsole us; she can give blood in return for blood, that is all; but you\nmust demand from her only what it is in her power to grant.\"\n\n\"I will put another case to you,\" continued the count; \"that where\nsociety, attacked by the death of a person, avenges death by death. But\nare there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer\nwithout society taking the least cognizance of them, or offering him\neven the insufficient means of vengeance, of which we have just spoken?\nAre there not crimes for which the impalement of the Turks, the augers\nof the Persians, the stake and the brand of the Iroquois Indians, are\ninadequate tortures, and which are unpunished by society? Answer me, do\nnot these crimes exist?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Franz; \"and it is to punish them that duelling is\ntolerated.\"\n\n\"Ah, duelling,\" cried the count; \"a pleasant manner, upon my soul, of\narriving at your end when that end is vengeance! A man has carried off\nyour mistress, a man has seduced your wife, a man has dishonored your\ndaughter; he has rendered the whole life of one who had the right to\nexpect from heaven that portion of happiness God has promised to every\none of his creatures, an existence of misery and infamy; and you think\nyou are avenged because you send a ball through the head, or pass a\nsword through the breast, of that man who has planted madness in your\nbrain, and despair in your heart. And remember, moreover, that it is\noften he who comes off victorious from the strife, absolved of all crime\nin the eyes of the world. No, no,\" continued the count, \"had I to avenge\nmyself, it is not thus I would take revenge.\"\n\n\"Then you disapprove of duelling? You would not fight a duel?\" asked\nAlbert in his turn, astonished at this strange theory.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied the count; \"understand me, I would fight a duel for\na trifle, for an insult, for a blow; and the more so that, thanks to\nmy skill in all bodily exercises, and the indifference to danger I have\ngradually acquired, I should be almost certain to kill my man. Oh,\nI would fight for such a cause; but in return for a slow, profound,\neternal torture, I would give back the same, were it possible; an eye\nfor an eye, a tooth for a tooth, as the Orientalists say,--our masters\nin everything,--those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a\nlife of dreams and a paradise of realities.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Franz to the count, \"with this theory, which renders you at\nonce judge and executioner of your own cause, it would be difficult to\nadopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under the power\nof the law. Hatred is blind, rage carries you away; and he who pours out\nvengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught.\"\n\n\"Yes, if he be poor and inexperienced, not if he be rich and skilful;\nbesides, the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment\nof which we have already spoken, and which the philanthropic French\nRevolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or broken\non the wheel. What matters this punishment, as long as he is avenged? On\nmy word, I almost regret that in all probability this miserable Peppino\nwill not be beheaded, as you might have had an opportunity then of\nseeing how short a time the punishment lasts, and whether it is worth\neven mentioning; but, really this is a most singular conversation for\nthe Carnival, gentlemen; how did it arise? Ah, I recollect, you asked\nfor a place at my window; you shall have it; but let us first sit down\nto table, for here comes the servant to inform us that breakfast is\nready.\" As he spoke, a servant opened one of the four doors of the\napartment, saying--\"Al suo commodo!\" The two young men arose and entered\nthe breakfast-room.\n\nDuring the meal, which was excellent, and admirably served, Franz looked\nrepeatedly at Albert, in order to observe the impressions which he\ndoubted not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer; but\nwhether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to\nhim, whether the explanation of the Count of Monte Cristo with regard\nto duelling had satisfied him, or whether the events which Franz knew\nof had had their effect on him alone, he remarked that his companion did\nnot pay the least regard to them, but on the contrary ate like a man\nwho for the last four or five months had been condemned to partake of\nItalian cookery--that is, the worst in the world. As for the count, he\njust touched the dishes; he seemed to fulfil the duties of a host by\nsitting down with his guests, and awaited their departure to be served\nwith some strange or more delicate food. This brought back to Franz, in\nspite of himself, the recollection of the terror with which the count\nhad inspired the Countess G----, and her firm conviction that the man in\nthe opposite box was a vampire. At the end of the breakfast Franz took\nout his watch. \"Well,\" said the count, \"what are you doing?\"\n\n\"You must excuse us, count,\" returned Franz, \"but we have still much to\ndo.\"\n\n\"What may that be?\"\n\n\"We have no masks, and it is absolutely necessary to procure them.\"\n\n\"Do not concern yourself about that; we have, I think, a private room in\nthe Piazza del Popolo; I will have whatever costumes you choose brought\nto us, and you can dress there.\"\n\n\"After the execution?\" cried Franz.\n\n\"Before or after, whichever you please.\"\n\n\"Opposite the scaffold?\"\n\n\"The scaffold forms part of the fete.\"\n\n\"Count, I have reflected on the matter,\" said Franz, \"I thank you for\nyour courtesy, but I shall content myself with accepting a place in your\ncarriage and at your window at the Rospoli Palace, and I leave you at\nliberty to dispose of my place at the Piazza del Popolo.\"\n\n\"But I warn you, you will lose a very curious sight,\" returned the\ncount.\n\n\"You will describe it to me,\" replied Franz, \"and the recital from your\nlips will make as great an impression on me as if I had witnessed it. I\nhave more than once intended witnessing an execution, but I have never\nbeen able to make up my mind; and you, Albert?\"\n\n\"I,\" replied the viscount,--\"I saw Castaing executed, but I think I was\nrather intoxicated that day, for I had quitted college the same morning,\nand we had passed the previous night at a tavern.\"\n\n\"Besides, it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at\nParis, that you should not see one anywhere else; when you travel, it is\nto see everything. Think what a figure you will make when you are asked,\n'How do they execute at Rome?' and you reply, 'I do not know'! And,\nbesides, they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel, who killed\nwith a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own\nson. Diable, when a churchman is killed, it should be with a different\nweapon than a log, especially when he has behaved like a father. If you\nwent to Spain, would you not see the bull-fight? Well, suppose it is\na bull-fight you are going to see? Recollect the ancient Romans of\nthe Circus, and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and\na hundred men. Think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators, the\nsage matrons who took their daughters, and the charming Vestals who made\nwith the thumb of their white hands the fatal sign that said, 'Come,\ndespatch the dying.'\"\n\n\"Shall you go, then, Albert?\" asked Franz.\n\n\"Ma foi, yes; like you, I hesitated, but the count's eloquence decides\nme.\"\n\n\"Let us go, then,\" said Franz, \"since you wish it; but on our way to the\nPiazza del Popolo, I wish to pass through the Corso. Is this possible,\ncount?\"\n\n\"On foot, yes, in a carriage, no.\"\n\n\"I will go on foot, then.\"\n\n\"Is it important that you should go that way?\"\n\n\"Yes, there is something I wish to see.\"\n\n\"Well, we will go by the Corso. We will send the carriage to wait for us\non the Piazza del Popolo, by the Strada del Babuino, for I shall be glad\nto pass, myself, through the Corso, to see if some orders I have given\nhave been executed.\"\n\n\"Excellency,\" said a servant, opening the door, \"a man in the dress of a\npenitent wishes to speak to you.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes\" returned the count, \"I know who he is, gentlemen; will you\nreturn to the salon? you will find good cigars on the centre table. I\nwill be with you directly.\" The young men rose and returned into the\nsalon, while the count, again apologizing, left by another door. Albert,\nwho was a great smoker, and who had considered it no small sacrifice to\nbe deprived of the cigars of the Cafe de Paris, approached the table,\nand uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some veritable puros.\n\n\"Well,\" asked Franz, \"what think you of the Count of Monte Cristo?\"\n\n\"What do I think?\" said Albert, evidently surprised at such a question\nfrom his companion; \"I think he is a delightful fellow, who does the\nhonors of his table admirably; who has travelled much, read much, is,\nlike Brutus, of the Stoic school, and moreover,\" added he, sending a\nvolume of smoke up towards the ceiling, \"that he has excellent cigars.\"\nSuch was Albert's opinion of the count, and as Franz well knew that\nAlbert professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection,\nhe made no attempt to change it. \"But,\" said he, \"did you observe one\nvery singular thing?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"How attentively he looked at you.\"\n\n\"At me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"--Albert reflected. \"Ah,\" replied he, sighing, \"that is not very\nsurprising; I have been more than a year absent from Paris, and\nmy clothes are of a most antiquated cut; the count takes me for a\nprovincial. The first opportunity you have, undeceive him, I beg, and\ntell him I am nothing of the kind.\" Franz smiled; an instant after the\ncount entered.\n\n\"I am now quite at your service, gentlemen,\" said he. \"The carriage is\ngoing one way to the Piazza del Popolo, and we will go another; and,\nif you please, by the Corso. Take some more of these cigars, M. de\nMorcerf.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" returned Albert; \"Italian cigars are horrible. When\nyou come to Paris, I will return all this.\"\n\n\"I will not refuse; I intend going there soon, and since you allow me,\nI will pay you a visit. Come, we have not any time to lose, it is\nhalf-past twelve--let us set off.\" All three descended; the coachman\nreceived his master's orders, and drove down the Via del Babuino.\nWhile the three gentlemen walked along the Piazza de Spagni and the\nVia Frattina, which led directly between the Fiano and Rospoli palaces,\nFranz's attention was directed towards the windows of that last palace,\nfor he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the man in the\nmantle and the Transtevere peasant. \"Which are your windows?\" asked he\nof the count, with as much indifference as he could assume. \"The three\nlast,\" returned he, with a negligence evidently unaffected, for he could\nnot imagine with what intention the question was put. Franz glanced\nrapidly towards the three windows. The side windows were hung with\nyellow damask, and the centre one with white damask and a red cross. The\nman in the mantle had kept his promise to the Transteverin, and there\ncould now be no doubt that he was the count. The three windows were\nstill untenanted. Preparations were making on every side; chairs were\nplaced, scaffolds were raised, and windows were hung with flags. The\nmasks could not appear; the carriages could not move about; but the\nmasks were visible behind the windows, the carriages, and the doors.\n\nFranz, Albert, and the count continued to descend the Corso. As they\napproached the Piazza del Popolo, the crowd became more dense, and\nabove the heads of the multitude two objects were visible: the obelisk,\nsurmounted by a cross, which marks the centre of the square, and in\nfront of the obelisk, at the point where the three streets, del Babuino,\ndel Corso, and di Ripetta, meet, the two uprights of the scaffold,\nbetween which glittered the curved knife of the mandaia. At the corner\nof the street they met the count's steward, who was awaiting his master.\nThe window, let at an exorbitant price, which the count had doubtless\nwished to conceal from his guests, was on the second floor of the great\npalace, situated between the Via del Babuino and the Monte Pincio. It\nconsisted, as we have said, of a small dressing-room, opening into a\nbedroom, and, when the door of communication was shut, the inmates were\nquite alone. On chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes of blue and\nwhite satin. \"As you left the choice of your costumes to me,\" said the\ncount to the two friends, \"I have had these brought, as they will be\nthe most worn this year; and they are most suitable, on account of the\nconfetti (sweetmeats), as they do not show the flour.\"\n\nFranz heard the words of the count but imperfectly, and he perhaps did\nnot fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes; for he was\nwholly absorbed by the spectacle that the Piazza del Popolo presented,\nand by the terrible instrument that was in the centre. It was the first\ntime Franz had ever seen a guillotine,--we say guillotine, because\nthe Roman mandaia is formed on almost the same model as the French\ninstrument. [*] The knife, which is shaped like a crescent, that cuts\nwith the convex side, falls from a less height, and that is all the\ndifference. Two men, seated on the movable plank on which the victim\nis laid, were eating their breakfasts, while waiting for the criminal.\nTheir repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages. One of them\nlifted the plank, took out a flask of wine, drank some, and then passed\nit to his companion. These two men were the executioner's assistants.\nAt this sight Franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow. The\nprisoners, transported the previous evening from the Carcere Nuovo to\nthe little church of Santa Maria del Popolo, had passed the night, each\naccompanied by two priests, in a chapel closed by a grating, before\nwhich were two sentinels, who were relieved at intervals. A double line\nof carbineers, placed on each side of the door of the church, reached\nto the scaffold, and formed a circle around it, leaving a path about ten\nfeet wide, and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred feet.\nAll the rest of the square was paved with heads. Many women held their\ninfants on their shoulders, and thus the children had the best view.\nThe Monte Pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators; the\nbalconies of the two churches at the corner of the Via del Babuino and\nthe Via di Ripetta were crammed; the steps even seemed a parti-colored\nsea, that was impelled towards the portico; every niche in the wall\nheld its living statue. What the count said was true--the most curious\nspectacle in life is that of death. And yet, instead of the silence and\nthe solemnity demanded by the occasion, laughter and jests arose from\nthe crowd. It was evident that the execution was, in the eyes of the\npeople, only the commencement of the Carnival. Suddenly the tumult\nceased, as if by magic, and the doors of the church opened. A\nbrotherhood of penitents, clothed from head to foot in robes of gray\nsackcloth, with holes for the eyes, and holding in their hands lighted\ntapers, appeared first; the chief marched at the head. Behind the\npenitents came a man of vast stature and proportions. He was naked, with\nthe exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large\nknife in a sheath, and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron\nsledge-hammer. This man was the executioner. He had, moreover, sandals\nbound on his feet by cords. Behind the executioner came, in the order\nin which they were to die, first Peppino and then Andrea. Each was\naccompanied by two priests. Neither had his eyes bandaged. Peppino\nwalked with a firm step, doubtless aware of what awaited him. Andrea was\nsupported by two priests. Each of them, from time to time, kissed the\ncrucifix a confessor held out to them. At this sight alone Franz felt\nhis legs tremble under him. He looked at Albert--he was as white as his\nshirt, and mechanically cast away his cigar, although he had not half\nsmoked it. The count alone seemed unmoved--nay, more, a slight color\nseemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks. His nostrils dilated like\nthose of a wild beast that scents its prey, and his lips, half opened,\ndisclosed his white teeth, small and sharp like those of a jackal. And\nyet his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness, such as Franz\nhad never before witnessed in them; his black eyes especially were full\nof kindness and pity. However, the two culprits advanced, and as they\napproached their faces became visible. Peppino was a handsome young\nman of four or five and twenty, bronzed by the sun; he carried his head\nerect, and seemed on the watch to see on which side his liberator\nwould appear. Andrea was short and fat; his visage, marked with brutal\ncruelty, did not indicate age; he might be thirty. In prison he had\nsuffered his beard to grow; his head fell on his shoulder, his legs\nbent beneath him, and his movements were apparently automatic and\nunconscious.\n\n     * Dr. Guillotin got the idea of his famous machine from\n     witnessing an execution in Italy.\n\n\"I thought,\" said Franz to the count, \"that you told me there would be\nbut one execution.\"\n\n\"I told you true,\" replied he coldly.\n\n\"And yet here are two culprits.\"\n\n\"Yes; but only one of these two is about to die; the other has many\nyears to live.\"\n\n\"If the pardon is to come, there is no time to lose.\"\n\n\"And see, here it is,\" said the count. At the moment when Peppino\nreached the foot of the mandaia, a priest arrived in some haste,\nforced his way through the soldiers, and, advancing to the chief of the\nbrotherhood, gave him a folded paper. The piercing eye of Peppino had\nnoticed all. The chief took the paper, unfolded it, and, raising his\nhand, \"Heaven be praised, and his holiness also,\" said he in a loud\nvoice; \"here is a pardon for one of the prisoners!\"\n\n\"A pardon!\" cried the people with one voice--\"a pardon!\" At this cry\nAndrea raised his head. \"Pardon for whom?\" cried he.\n\nPeppino remained breathless. \"A pardon for Peppino, called Rocca\nPriori,\" said the principal friar. And he passed the paper to the\nofficer commanding the carbineers, who read and returned it to him.\n\n\"For Peppino!\" cried Andrea, who seemed roused from the torpor in\nwhich he had been plunged. \"Why for him and not for me? We ought to die\ntogether. I was promised he should die with me. You have no right to put\nme to death alone. I will not die alone--I will not!\" And he broke\nfrom the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast, and striving\ndesperately to break the cords that bound his hands. The executioner\nmade a sign, and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized\nhim. \"What is going on?\" asked Franz of the count; for, as all the talk\nwas in the Roman dialect, he had not perfectly understood it. \"Do you\nnot see?\" returned the count, \"that this human creature who is about to\ndie is furious that his fellow-sufferer does not perish with him? and,\nwere he able, he would rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and\nnails than let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be deprived\nof. Oh, man, man--race of crocodiles,\" cried the count, extending his\nclinched hands towards the crowd, \"how well do I recognize you there,\nand that at all times you are worthy of yourselves!\" Meanwhile Andrea\nand the two executioners were struggling on the ground, and he kept\nexclaiming, \"He ought to die!--he shall die!--I will not die alone!\"\n\n\"Look, look,\" cried the count, seizing the young men's hands--\"look, for\non my soul it is curious. Here is a man who had resigned himself to his\nfate, who was going to the scaffold to die--like a coward, it is true,\nbut he was about to die without resistance. Do you know what gave him\nstrength?--do you know what consoled him? It was, that another partook\nof his punishment--that another partook of his anguish--that another\nwas to die before him. Lead two sheep to the butcher's, two oxen to the\nslaughterhouse, and make one of them understand that his companion will\nnot die; the sheep will bleat for pleasure, the ox will bellow with joy.\nBut man--man, whom God created in his own image--man, upon whom God has\nlaid his first, his sole commandment, to love his neighbor--man, to whom\nGod has given a voice to express his thoughts--what is his first cry\nwhen he hears his fellow-man is saved? A blasphemy. Honor to man, this\nmasterpiece of nature, this king of the creation!\" And the count burst\ninto a laugh; a terrible laugh, that showed he must have suffered\nhorribly to be able thus to laugh. However, the struggle still\ncontinued, and it was dreadful to witness. The people all took part\nagainst Andrea, and twenty thousand voices cried, \"Put him to death! put\nhim to death!\" Franz sprang back, but the count seized his arm, and held\nhim before the window. \"What are you doing?\" said he. \"Do you pity him?\nIf you heard the cry of 'Mad dog!' you would take your gun--you would\nunhesitatingly shoot the poor beast, who, after all, was only guilty of\nhaving been bitten by another dog. And yet you pity a man who, without\nbeing bitten by one of his race, has yet murdered his benefactor; and\nwho, now unable to kill any one, because his hands are bound, wishes to\nsee his companion in captivity perish. No, no--look, look!\"\n\nThe command was needless. Franz was fascinated by the horrible\nspectacle. The two assistants had borne Andrea to the scaffold, and\nthere, in spite of his struggles, his bites, and his cries, had forced\nhim to his knees. During this time the executioner had raised his mace,\nand signed to them to get out of the way; the criminal strove to rise,\nbut, ere he had time, the mace fell on his left temple. A dull and heavy\nsound was heard, and the man dropped like an ox on his face, and then\nturned over on his back. The executioner let fall his mace, drew his\nknife, and with one stroke opened his throat, and mounting on his\nstomach, stamped violently on it with his feet. At every stroke a jet of\nblood sprang from the wound.\n\nThis time Franz could contain himself no longer, but sank, half\nfainting, into a seat. Albert, with his eyes closed, was standing\ngrasping the window-curtains. The count was erect and triumphant, like\nthe Avenging Angel!\n\n\n\nChapter 36. The Carnival at Rome.\n\nWhen Franz recovered his senses, he saw Albert drinking a glass of\nwater, of which, to judge from his pallor, he stood in great need;\nand the count, who was assuming his masquerade costume. He glanced\nmechanically towards the square--the scene was wholly changed; scaffold,\nexecutioners, victims, all had disappeared; only the people remained,\nfull of noise and excitement. The bell of Monte Citorio, which only\nsounds on the pope's decease and the opening of the Carnival, was\nringing a joyous peal. \"Well,\" asked he of the count, \"what has, then,\nhappened?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied the count; \"only, as you see, the Carnival has\ncommenced. Make haste and dress yourself.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" said Franz, \"this horrible scene has passed away like a\ndream.\"\n\n\"It is but a dream, a nightmare, that has disturbed you.\"\n\n\"Yes, that I have suffered; but the culprit?\"\n\n\"That is a dream also; only he has remained asleep, while you have\nawakened; and who knows which of you is the most fortunate?\"\n\n\"But Peppino--what has become of him?\"\n\n\"Peppino is a lad of sense, who, unlike most men, who are happy in\nproportion as they are noticed, was delighted to see that the general\nattention was directed towards his companion. He profited by this\ndistraction to slip away among the crowd, without even thanking the\nworthy priests who accompanied him. Decidedly man is an ungrateful and\negotistical animal. But dress yourself; see, M. de Morcerf sets you\nthe example.\" Albert was drawing on the satin pantaloon over his black\ntrousers and varnished boots. \"Well, Albert,\" said Franz, \"do you feel\nmuch inclined to join the revels? Come, answer frankly.\"\n\n\"Ma foi, no,\" returned Albert. \"But I am really glad to have seen such\na sight; and I understand what the count said--that when you have once\nhabituated yourself to a similar spectacle, it is the only one that\ncauses you any emotion.\"\n\n\"Without reflecting that this is the only moment in which you can study\ncharacter,\" said the count; \"on the steps of the scaffold death tears\noff the mask that has been worn through life, and the real visage is\ndisclosed. It must be allowed that Andrea was not very handsome, the\nhideous scoundrel! Come, dress yourselves, gentlemen, dress yourselves.\"\nFranz felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two companions'\nexample. He assumed his costume, and fastened on the mask that scarcely\nequalled the pallor of his own face. Their toilet finished, they\ndescended; the carriage awaited them at the door, filled with sweetmeats\nand bouquets. They fell into the line of carriages. It is difficult to\nform an idea of the perfect change that had taken place. Instead of the\nspectacle of gloomy and silent death, the Piazza del Popolo presented a\nspectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry. A crowd of masks flowed\nin from all sides, emerging from the doors, descending from the windows.\nFrom every street and every corner drove carriages filled with clowns,\nharlequins, dominoes, mummers, pantomimists, Transteverins, knights, and\npeasants, screaming, fighting, gesticulating, throwing eggs filled with\nflour, confetti, nosegays, attacking, with their sarcasms and their\nmissiles, friends and foes, companions and strangers, indiscriminately,\nand no one took offence, or did anything but laugh. Franz and Albert\nwere like men who, to drive away a violent sorrow, have recourse to\nwine, and who, as they drink and become intoxicated, feel a thick veil\ndrawn between the past and the present. They saw, or rather continued\nto see, the image of what they had witnessed; but little by little the\ngeneral vertigo seized them, and they felt themselves obliged to take\npart in the noise and confusion. A handful of confetti that came from\na neighboring carriage, and which, while it covered Morcerf and his\ntwo companions with dust, pricked his neck and that portion of his face\nuncovered by his mask like a hundred pins, incited him to join in the\ngeneral combat, in which all the masks around him were engaged. He rose\nin his turn, and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats, with which\nthe carriage was filled, cast them with all the force and skill he was\nmaster of.\n\nThe strife had fairly begun, and the recollection of what they had seen\nhalf an hour before was gradually effaced from the young men's minds,\nso much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now\nbeheld. As for the Count of Monte Cristo, he had never for an instant\nshown any appearance of having been moved. Imagine the large and\nsplendid Corso, bordered from one end to the other with lofty palaces,\nwith their balconies hung with carpets, and their windows with flags. At\nthese balconies are three hundred thousand spectators--Romans, Italians,\nstrangers from all parts of the world, the united aristocracy of birth,\nwealth, and genius. Lovely women, yielding to the influence of the\nscene, bend over their balconies, or lean from their windows, and shower\ndown confetti, which are returned by bouquets; the air seems darkened\nwith the falling confetti and flying flowers. In the streets the lively\ncrowd is dressed in the most fantastic costumes--gigantic cabbages walk\ngravely about, buffaloes' heads bellow from men's shoulders, dogs walk\non their hind legs; in the midst of all this a mask is lifted, and, as\nin Callot's Temptation of St. Anthony, a lovely face is exhibited,\nwhich we would fain follow, but from which we are separated by troops\nof fiends. This will give a faint idea of the Carnival at Rome. At the\nsecond turn, the count stopped the carriage, and requested permission to\nwithdraw, leaving the vehicle at their disposal. Franz looked up--they\nwere opposite the Rospoli Palace. At the centre window, the one hung\nwith white damask with a red cross, was a blue domino, beneath\nwhich Franz's imagination easily pictured the beautiful Greek of the\nArgentina. \"Gentlemen,\" said the count, springing out, \"when you are\ntired of being actors, and wish to become spectators of this scene,\nyou know you have places at my windows. In the meantime, dispose of my\ncoachman, my carriage, and my servants.\" We have forgotten to mention,\nthat the count's coachman was attired in a bear-skin, exactly resembling\nOdry's in \"The Bear and the Pasha;\" and the two footmen behind were\ndressed up as green monkeys, with spring masks, with which they made\ngrimaces at every one who passed. Franz thanked the count for his\nattention. As for Albert, he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a\ncarriage full of Roman peasants that was passing near him. Unfortunately\nfor him, the line of carriages moved on again, and while he descended\nthe Piazza del Popolo, the other ascended towards the Palazzo di\nVenezia. \"Ah, my dear fellow,\" said he to Franz; \"you did not see?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"There,--that calash filled with Roman peasants.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, I am convinced they are all charming women.\"\n\n\"How unfortunate that you were masked, Albert,\" said Franz; \"here was an\nopportunity of making up for past disappointments.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" replied he, half laughing, half serious; \"I hope the Carnival will\nnot pass without some amends in one shape or the other.\"\n\nBut, in spite of Albert's hope, the day passed unmarked by any incident,\nexcepting two or three encounters with the carriage full of Roman\npeasants. At one of these encounters, accidentally or purposely,\nAlbert's mask fell off. He instantly rose and cast the remainder of the\nbouquets into the carriage. Doubtless one of the charming females\nAlbert had detected beneath their coquettish disguise was touched by his\ngallantry; for, as the carriage of the two friends passed her, she threw\na bunch of violets. Albert seized it, and as Franz had no reason to\nsuppose it was meant for him, he suffered Albert to retain it. Albert\nplaced it in his button-hole, and the carriage went triumphantly on.\n\n\"Well,\" said Franz to him; \"there is the beginning of an adventure.\"\n\n\"Laugh if you please--I really think so. So I will not abandon this\nbouquet.\"\n\n\"Pardieu,\" returned Franz, laughing, \"in token of your ingratitude.\"\nThe jest, however, soon appeared to become earnest; for when Albert and\nFranz again encountered the carriage with the contadini, the one who had\nthrown the violets to Albert, clapped her hands when she beheld them\nin his button-hole. \"Bravo, bravo,\" said Franz; \"things go wonderfully.\nShall I leave you? Perhaps you would prefer being alone?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied he; \"I will not be caught like a fool at a first\ndisclosure by a rendezvous under the clock, as they say at the\nopera-balls. If the fair peasant wishes to carry matters any further,\nwe shall find her, or rather, she will find us to-morrow; then she will\ngive me some sign or other, and I shall know what I have to do.\"\n\n\"On my word,\" said Franz, \"you are wise as Nestor and prudent as\nUlysses, and your fair Circe must be very skilful or very powerful if\nshe succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind.\" Albert was right;\nthe fair unknown had resolved, doubtless, to carry the intrigue no\nfarther; for although the young men made several more turns, they did\nnot again see the calash, which had turned up one of the neighboring\nstreets. Then they returned to the Rospoli Palace; but the count and\nthe blue domino had also disappeared; the two windows, hung with yellow\ndamask, were still occupied by the persons whom the count had invited.\nAt this moment the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the\nmascherata sounded the retreat. The file on the Corso broke the line,\nand in a second all the carriages had disappeared. Franz and Albert were\nopposite the Via delle Maratte; the coachman, without saying a word,\ndrove up it, passed along the Piazza di Spagni and the Rospoli Palace\nand stopped at the door of the hotel. Signor Pastrini came to the door\nto receive his guests. Franz hastened to inquire after the count, and to\nexpress regret that he had not returned in sufficient time; but Pastrini\nreassured him by saying that the Count of Monte Cristo had ordered a\nsecond carriage for himself, and that it had gone at four o'clock to\nfetch him from the Rospoli Palace. The count had, moreover, charged\nhim to offer the two friends the key of his box at the Argentina. Franz\nquestioned Albert as to his intentions; but Albert had great projects\nto put into execution before going to the theatre; and instead of making\nany answer, he inquired if Signor Pastrini could procure him a tailor.\n\"A tailor,\" said the host; \"and for what?\"\n\n\"To make us between now and to-morrow two Roman peasant costumes,\"\nreturned Albert. The host shook his head. \"To make you two costumes\nbetween now and to-morrow? I ask your excellencies' pardon, but this\nis quite a French demand; for the next week you will not find a single\ntailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid\nhim a crown a piece for each button.\"\n\n\"Then I must give up the idea?\"\n\n\"No; we have them ready-made. Leave all to me; and to-morrow, when you\nawake, you shall find a collection of costumes with which you will be\nsatisfied.\"\n\n\"My dear Albert,\" said Franz, \"leave all to our host; he has already\nproved himself full of resources; let us dine quietly, and afterwards go\nand see 'The Algerian Captive.'\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" returned Albert; \"but remember, Signor Pastrini, that both my\nfriend and myself attach the greatest importance to having to-morrow the\ncostumes we have asked for.\" The host again assured them they might rely\non him, and that their wishes should be attended to; upon which Franz\nand Albert mounted to their apartments, and proceeded to disencumber\nthemselves of their costumes. Albert, as he took off his dress,\ncarefully preserved the bunch of violets; it was his token reserved\nfor the morrow. The two friends sat down to table; but they could\nnot refrain from remarking the difference between the Count of Monte\nCristo's table and that of Signor Pastrini. Truth compelled Franz, in\nspite of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the count, to confess\nthat the advantage was not on Pastrini's side. During dessert, the\nservant inquired at what time they wished for the carriage. Albert\nand Franz looked at each other, fearing really to abuse the count's\nkindness. The servant understood them. \"His excellency the Count of\nMonte Cristo had,\" he said, \"given positive orders that the carriage was\nto remain at their lordships' orders all day, and they could therefore\ndispose of it without fear of indiscretion.\"\n\nThey resolved to profit by the count's courtesy, and ordered the horses\nto be harnessed, while they substituted evening dress for that which\nthey had on, and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats\nthey had sustained. This precaution taken, they went to the theatre,\nand installed themselves in the count's box. During the first act, the\nCountess G---- entered. Her first look was at the box where she had seen\nthe count the previous evening, so that she perceived Franz and Albert\nin the place of the very person concerning whom she had expressed so\nstrange an opinion to Franz. Her opera-glass was so fixedly directed\ntowards them, that Franz saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her\ncuriosity; and, availing himself of one of the privileges of the\nspectators of the Italian theatres, who use their boxes to hold\nreceptions, the two friends went to pay their respects to the countess.\nScarcely had they entered, when she motioned to Franz to assume the seat\nof honor. Albert, in his turn, sat behind.\n\n\"Well,\" said she, hardly giving Franz time to sit down, \"it seems you\nhave nothing better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new Lord\nRuthven, and you are already the best friends in the world.\"\n\n\"Without being so far advanced as that, my dear countess,\" returned\nFranz, \"I cannot deny that we have abused his good nature all day.\"\n\n\"All day?\"\n\n\"Yes; this morning we breakfasted with him; we rode in his carriage all\nday, and now we have taken possession of his box.\"\n\n\"You know him, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, and no.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"It is a long story.\"\n\n\"Tell it to me.\"\n\n\"It would frighten you too much.\"\n\n\"So much the more reason.\"\n\n\"At least wait until the story has a conclusion.\"\n\n\"Very well; I prefer complete histories; but tell me how you made his\nacquaintance? Did any one introduce you to him?\"\n\n\"No; it was he who introduced himself to us.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Last night, after we left you.\"\n\n\"Through what medium?\"\n\n\"The very prosaic one of our landlord.\"\n\n\"He is staying, then, at the Hotel de Londres with you?\"\n\n\"Not only in the same hotel, but on the same floor.\"\n\n\"What is his name--for, of course, you know?\"\n\n\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\"\n\n\"That is not a family name?\"\n\n\"No, it is the name of the island he has purchased.\"\n\n\"And he is a count?\"\n\n\"A Tuscan count.\"\n\n\"Well, we must put up with that,\" said the countess, who was herself\nfrom one of the oldest Venetian families. \"What sort of a man is he?\"\n\n\"Ask the Vicomte de Morcerf.\"\n\n\"You hear, M. de Morcerf, I am referred to you,\" said the countess.\n\n\"We should be very hard to please, madam,\" returned Albert, \"did we not\nthink him delightful. A friend of ten years' standing could not have\ndone more for us, or with a more perfect courtesy.\"\n\n\"Come,\" observed the countess, smiling, \"I see my vampire is only some\nmillionaire, who has taken the appearance of Lara in order to avoid\nbeing confounded with M. de Rothschild; and you have seen her?\"\n\n\"Her?\"\n\n\"The beautiful Greek of yesterday.\"\n\n\"No; we heard, I think, the sound of her guzla, but she remained\nperfectly invisible.\"\n\n\"When you say invisible,\" interrupted Albert, \"it is only to keep up\nthe mystery; for whom do you take the blue domino at the window with the\nwhite curtains?\"\n\n\"Where was this window with white hangings?\" asked the countess.\n\n\"At the Rospoli Palace.\"\n\n\"The count had three windows at the Rospoli Palace?\"\n\n\"Yes. Did you pass through the Corso?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, did you notice two windows hung with yellow damask, and one with\nwhite damask with a red cross? Those were the count's windows.\"\n\n\"Why, he must be a nabob. Do you know what those three windows were\nworth?\"\n\n\"Two or three hundred Roman crowns?\"\n\n\"Two or three thousand.\"\n\n\"The deuce.\"\n\n\"Does his island produce him such a revenue?\"\n\n\"It does not bring him a baiocco.\"\n\n\"Then why did he purchase it?\"\n\n\"For a whim.\"\n\n\"He is an original, then?\"\n\n\"In reality,\" observed Albert, \"he seemed to me somewhat eccentric; were\nhe at Paris, and a frequenter of the theatres, I should say he was a\npoor devil literally mad. This morning he made two or three exits worthy\nof Didier or Anthony.\" At this moment a fresh visitor entered, and,\naccording to custom, Franz gave up his seat to him. This circumstance\nhad, moreover, the effect of changing the conversation; an hour\nafterwards the two friends returned to their hotel. Signor Pastrini\nhad already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow; and he\nassured them that they would be perfectly satisfied. The next morning,\nat nine o'clock, he entered Franz's room, followed by a tailor, who\nhad eight or ten Roman peasant costumes on his arm; they selected two\nexactly alike, and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about\ntwenty yards of ribbon, and to procure them two of the long silk sashes\nof different colors with which the lower orders decorate themselves on\nfete-days. Albert was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress--a\njacket and breeches of blue velvet, silk stockings with clocks, shoes\nwith buckles, and a silk waistcoat. This picturesque attire set him off\nto great advantage; and when he had bound the scarf around his waist,\nand when his hat, placed coquettishly on one side, let fall on his\nshoulder a stream of ribbons, Franz was forced to confess that costume\nhas much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain\nnations. The Turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing\nrobes, but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up\nto the chin, and their red caps, which make them look like a bottle of\nwine with a red seal? Franz complimented Albert, who looked at himself\nin the glass with an unequivocal smile of satisfaction. They were thus\nengaged when the Count of Monte Cristo entered.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"although a companion is agreeable, perfect\nfreedom is sometimes still more agreeable. I come to say that to-day,\nand for the remainder of the Carnival, I leave the carriage entirely at\nyour disposal. The host will tell you I have three or four more, so that\nyou will not inconvenience me in any way. Make use of it, I pray you,\nfor your pleasure or your business.\"\n\nThe young men wished to decline, but they could find no good reason for\nrefusing an offer which was so agreeable to them. The Count of Monte\nCristo remained a quarter of an hour with them, conversing on all\nsubjects with the greatest ease. He was, as we have already said,\nperfectly well acquainted with the literature of all countries. A glance\nat the walls of his salon proved to Franz and Albert that he was a\nconnoisseur of pictures. A few words he let fall showed them that he was\nno stranger to the sciences, and he seemed much occupied with chemistry.\nThe two friends did not venture to return the count the breakfast he had\ngiven them; it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for\nhis excellent table the very inferior one of Signor Pastrini. They told\nhim so frankly, and he received their excuses with the air of a man who\nappreciated their delicacy. Albert was charmed with the count's manners,\nand he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect gentleman\nby reason of his varied knowledge. The permission to do what he liked\nwith the carriage pleased him above all, for the fair peasants had\nappeared in a most elegant carriage the preceding evening, and Albert\nwas not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them. At half-past one\nthey descended, the coachman and footman had put on their livery over\ntheir disguises, which gave them a more ridiculous appearance than\never, and which gained them the applause of Franz and Albert. Albert\nhad fastened the faded bunch of violets to his button-hole. At the first\nsound of the bell they hastened into the Corso by the Via Vittoria. At\nthe second turn, a bunch of fresh violets, thrown from a carriage filled\nwith harlequins, indicated to Albert that, like himself and his friend,\nthe peasants had changed their costume, also; and whether it was the\nresult of chance, or whether a similar feeling had possessed them both,\nwhile he had changed his costume they had assumed his.\n\nAlbert placed the fresh bouquet in his button-hole, but he kept the\nfaded one in his hand; and when he again met the calash, he raised it to\nhis lips, an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair lady\nwho had thrown it, but her joyous companions also. The day was as gay\nas the preceding one, perhaps even more animated and noisy; the count\nappeared for an instant at his window, but when they again passed he had\ndisappeared. It is almost needless to say that the flirtation between\nAlbert and the fair peasant continued all day. In the evening, on his\nreturn, Franz found a letter from the embassy, informing him that he\nwould have the honor of being received by his holiness the next day. At\neach previous visit he had made to Rome, he had solicited and obtained\nthe same favor; and incited as much by a religious feeling as by\ngratitude, he was unwilling to quit the capital of the Christian world\nwithout laying his respectful homage at the feet of one of St. Peter's\nsuccessors who has set the rare example of all the virtues. He did\nnot then think of the Carnival, for in spite of his condescension and\ntouching kindness, one cannot incline one's self without awe before the\nvenerable and noble old man called Gregory XVI. On his return from the\nVatican, Franz carefully avoided the Corso; he brought away with him a\ntreasure of pious thoughts, to which the mad gayety of the maskers\nwould have been profanation. At ten minutes past five Albert entered\noverjoyed. The harlequin had reassumed her peasant's costume, and as\nshe passed she raised her mask. She was charming. Franz congratulated\nAlbert, who received his congratulations with the air of a man conscious\nthat they are merited. He had recognized by certain unmistakable signs,\nthat his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy. He had made up his\nmind to write to her the next day. Franz remarked, while he gave these\ndetails, that Albert seemed to have something to ask of him, but that he\nwas unwilling to ask it. He insisted upon it, declaring beforehand\nthat he was willing to make any sacrifice the other wished. Albert let\nhimself be pressed just as long as friendship required, and then avowed\nto Franz that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy\nthe carriage alone the next day. Albert attributed to Franz's absence\nthe extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask. Franz\nwas not sufficiently egotistical to stop Albert in the middle of an\nadventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so\nflattering to his vanity. He felt assured that the perfect indiscretion\nof his friend would duly inform him of all that happened; and as, during\nthree years that he had travelled all over Italy, a similar piece of\ngood fortune had never fallen to his share, Franz was by no means sorry\nto learn how to act on such an occasion. He therefore promised Albert\nthat he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the Carnival\nfrom the windows of the Rospoli Palace.\n\nThe next morning he saw Albert pass and repass, holding an enormous\nbouquet, which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous\nepistle. This belief was changed into certainty when Franz saw the\nbouquet (conspicuous by a circle of white camellias) in the hand of a\ncharming harlequin dressed in rose-colored satin. The evening was no\nlonger joy, but delirium. Albert nothing doubted but that the fair\nunknown would reply in the same manner. Franz anticipated his wishes by\nsaying that the noise fatigued him, and that he should pass the next day\nin writing and looking over his journal. Albert was not deceived, for\nthe next evening Franz saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded paper\nwhich he held by one corner. \"Well,\" said he, \"was I mistaken?\"\n\n\"She has answered you!\" cried Franz.\n\n\"Read.\" This word was pronounced in a manner impossible to describe.\nFranz took the letter, and read:--\n\nTuesday evening, at seven o'clock, descend from your carriage opposite\nthe Via dei Pontefici, and follow the Roman peasant who snatches your\ntorch from you. When you arrive at the first step of the church of\nSan Giacomo, be sure to fasten a knot of rose-colored ribbons to the\nshoulder of your harlequin costume, in order that you may be recognized.\nUntil then you will not see me.\n\nConstancy and Discretion.\n\n\"Well,\" asked he, when Franz had finished, \"what do you think of that?\"\n\n\"I think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable appearance.\"\n\n\"I think so, also,\" replied Albert; \"and I very much fear you will go\nalone to the Duke of Bracciano's ball.\" Franz and Albert had received\nthat morning an invitation from the celebrated Roman banker. \"Take care,\nAlbert,\" said Franz. \"All the nobility of Rome will be present, and if\nyour fair incognita belong to the higher class of society, she must go\nthere.\"\n\n\"Whether she goes there or not, my opinion is still the same,\" returned\nAlbert. \"You have read the letter?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You know how imperfectly the women of the mezzo cito are educated in\nItaly?\" (This is the name of the lower class.)\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, read the letter again. Look at the writing, and find if you\ncan, any blemish in the language or orthography.\" (The writing was, in\nreality, charming, and the orthography irreproachable.) \"You are born to\ngood fortune,\" said Franz, as he returned the letter.\n\n\"Laugh as much as you will,\" replied Albert, \"I am in love.\"\n\n\"You alarm me,\" cried Franz. \"I see that I shall not only go alone to\nthe Duke of Bracciano's, but also return to Florence alone.\"\n\n\"If my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful,\" said Albert, \"I shall\nfix myself at Rome for six weeks, at least. I adore Rome, and I have\nalways had a great taste for archaeology.\"\n\n\"Come, two or three more such adventures, and I do not despair of seeing\nyou a member of the Academy.\" Doubtless Albert was about to discuss\nseriously his right to the academic chair when they were informed that\ndinner was ready. Albert's love had not taken away his appetite. He\nhastened with Franz to seat himself, free to recommence the discussion\nafter dinner. After dinner, the Count of Monte Cristo was announced.\nThey had not seen him for two days. Signor Pastrini informed them that\nbusiness had called him to Civita Vecchia. He had started the previous\nevening, and had only returned an hour since. He was charming. Whether\nhe kept a watch over himself, or whether by accident he did not sound\nthe acrimonious chords that in other circumstances had been touched, he\nwas to-night like everybody else. The man was an enigma to Franz. The\ncount must feel sure that Franz recognized him; and yet he had not let\nfall a single word indicating any previous acquaintance between them.\nOn his side, however great Franz's desire was to allude to their former\ninterview, the fear of being disagreeable to the man who had loaded him\nand his friend with kindness prevented him from mentioning it. The\ncount had learned that the two friends had sent to secure a box at the\nArgentina Theatre, and were told they were all let. In consequence, he\nbrought them the key of his own--at least such was the apparent motive\nof his visit. Franz and Albert made some difficulty, alleging their fear\nof depriving him of it; but the count replied that, as he was going to\nthe Palli Theatre, the box at the Argentina Theatre would be lost if\nthey did not profit by it. This assurance determined the two friends to\naccept it.\n\nFranz had by degrees become accustomed to the count's pallor, which had\nso forcibly struck him at their first meeting. He could not refrain from\nadmiring the severe beauty of his features, the only defect, or rather\nthe principal quality of which was the pallor. Truly, a Byronic hero!\nFranz could not, we will not say see him, but even think of him without\nimagining his stern head upon Manfred's shoulders, or beneath Lara's\nhelmet. His forehead was marked with the line that indicates the\nconstant presence of bitter thoughts; he had the fiery eyes that seem\nto penetrate to the very soul, and the haughty and disdainful upper lip\nthat gives to the words it utters a peculiar character that impresses\nthem on the minds of those to whom they are addressed. The count was no\nlonger young. He was at least forty; and yet it was easy to understand\nthat he was formed to rule the young men with whom he associated at\npresent. And, to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of\nthe English poet, the count seemed to have the power of fascination.\nAlbert was constantly expatiating on their good fortune in meeting such\na man. Franz was less enthusiastic; but the count exercised over him\nalso the ascendency a strong mind always acquires over a mind less\ndomineering. He thought several times of the project the count had\nof visiting Paris; and he had no doubt but that, with his eccentric\ncharacter, his characteristic face, and his colossal fortune, he would\nproduce a great effect there. And yet he did not wish to be at Paris\nwhen the count was there. The evening passed as evenings mostly pass at\nItalian theatres; that is, not in listening to the music, but in paying\nvisits and conversing. The Countess G---- wished to revive the subject of\nthe count, but Franz announced he had something far newer to tell her,\nand, in spite of Albert's demonstrations of false modesty, he informed\nthe countess of the great event which had preoccupied them for the last\nthree days. As similar intrigues are not uncommon in Italy, if we may\ncredit travellers, the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity,\nbut congratulated Albert on his success. They promised, upon separating,\nto meet at the Duke of Bracciano's ball, to which all Rome was invited.\nThe heroine of the bouquet kept her word; she gave Albert no sign of her\nexistence the morrow or the day after.\n\nAt length Tuesday came, the last and most tumultuous day of the\nCarnival. On Tuesday, the theatres open at ten o'clock in the morning,\nas Lent begins after eight at night. On Tuesday, all those who through\nwant of money, time, or enthusiasm, have not been to see the Carnival\nbefore, mingle in the gayety, and contribute to the noise and\nexcitement. From two o'clock till five Franz and Albert followed in the\nfete, exchanging handfuls of confetti with the other carriages and\nthe pedestrians, who crowded amongst the horses' feet and the carriage\nwheels without a single accident, a single dispute, or a single fight.\nThe fetes are veritable pleasure days to the Italians. The author of\nthis history, who has resided five or six years in Italy, does not\nrecollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by one of those\nevents so common in other countries. Albert was triumphant in his\nharlequin costume. A knot of rose-colored ribbons fell from his shoulder\nalmost to the ground. In order that there might be no confusion, Franz\nwore his peasant's costume.\n\nAs the day advanced, the tumult became greater. There was not on the\npavement, in the carriages, at the windows, a single tongue that was\nsilent, a single arm that did not move. It was a human storm, made up\nof a thunder of cries, and a hail of sweetmeats, flowers, eggs, oranges,\nand nosegays. At three o'clock the sound of fireworks, let off on the\nPiazza del Popolo and the Piazza di Venezia (heard with difficulty amid\nthe din and confusion) announced that the races were about to begin. The\nraces, like the moccoli, are one of the episodes peculiar to the last\ndays of the Carnival. At the sound of the fireworks the carriages\ninstantly broke ranks, and retired by the adjacent streets. All these\nevolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous\nrapidity, without the police interfering in the matter. The pedestrians\nranged themselves against the walls; then the trampling of horses and\nthe clashing of steel were heard. A detachment of carbineers, fifteen\nabreast, galloped up the Corso in order to clear it for the barberi.\nWhen the detachment arrived at the Piazza di Venezia, a second volley of\nfireworks was discharged, to announce that the street was clear. Almost\ninstantly, in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry, seven\nor eight horses, excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand\nspectators, passed by like lightning. Then the Castle of Saint Angelo\nfired three cannon to indicate that number three had won. Immediately,\nwithout any other signal, the carriages moved on, flowing on towards the\nCorso, down all the streets, like torrents pent up for a while, which\nagain flow into the parent river; and the immense stream again continued\nits course between its two granite banks.\n\nA new source of noise and movement was added to the crowd. The sellers\nof moccoletti entered on the scene. The moccoli, or moccoletti, are\ncandles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight, and\nwhich give to each actor in the great final scene of the Carnival two\nvery serious problems to grapple with,--first, how to keep his own\nmoccoletto alight; and secondly, how to extinguish the moccoletti of\nothers. The moccoletto is like life: man has found but one means of\ntransmitting it, and that one comes from God. But he has discovered a\nthousand means of taking it away, and the devil has somewhat aided him.\nThe moccoletto is kindled by approaching it to a light. But who can\ndescribe the thousand means of extinguishing the moccoletto?--the\ngigantic bellows, the monstrous extinguishers, the superhuman fans.\nEvery one hastened to purchase moccoletti--Franz and Albert among the\nrest.\n\nThe night was rapidly approaching; and already, at the cry of\n\"Moccoletti!\" repeated by the shrill voices of a thousand vendors, two\nor three stars began to burn among the crowd. It was a signal. At the\nend of ten minutes fifty thousand lights glittered, descending from\nthe Palazzo di Venezia to the Piazza del Popolo, and mounting from the\nPiazzo del Popolo to the Palazzo di Venezia. It seemed like the fete of\njack-o'-lanterns. It is impossible to form any idea of it without having\nseen it. Suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and\nmingled in a wild dance on the face of the earth; the whole accompanied\nby cries that were never heard in any other part of the world. The\nfacchino follows the prince, the Transteverin the citizen, every one\nblowing, extinguishing, relighting. Had old AEolus appeared at this\nmoment, he would have been proclaimed king of the moccoli, and Aquilo\nthe heir-presumptive to the throne. This battle of folly and flame\ncontinued for two hours; the Corso was light as day; the features of\nthe spectators on the third and fourth stories were visible. Every five\nminutes Albert took out his watch; at length it pointed to seven. The\ntwo friends were in the Via dei Pontefici. Albert sprang out, bearing\nhis moccoletto in his hand. Two or three masks strove to knock his\nmoccoletto out of his hand; but Albert, a first-rate pugilist, sent them\nrolling in the street, one after the other, and continued his course\ntowards the church of San Giacomo. The steps were crowded with masks,\nwho strove to snatch each other's torches. Franz followed Albert with\nhis eyes, and saw him mount the first step. Instantly a mask, wearing\nthe well-known costume of a peasant woman, snatched his moccoletto from\nhim without his offering any resistance. Franz was too far off to hear\nwhat they said; but, without doubt, nothing hostile passed, for he saw\nAlbert disappear arm-in-arm with the peasant girl. He watched them pass\nthrough the crowd for some time, but at length he lost sight of them in\nthe Via Macello. Suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the end of\nthe carnival sounded, and at the same instant all the moccoletti were\nextinguished as if by enchantment. It seemed as though one immense blast\nof the wind had extinguished every one. Franz found himself in utter\ndarkness. No sound was audible save that of the carriages that were\ncarrying the maskers home; nothing was visible save a few lights that\nburnt behind the windows. The Carnival was over.\n\n\n\nChapter 37. The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian.\n\nIn his whole life, perhaps, Franz had never before experienced so sudden\nan impression, so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness, as in this\nmoment. It seemed as though Rome, under the magic breath of some demon\nof the night, had suddenly changed into a vast tomb. By a chance, which\nadded yet more to the intensity of the darkness, the moon, which was on\nthe wane, did not rise until eleven o'clock, and the streets which the\nyoung man traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity. The distance\nwas short, and at the end of ten minutes his carriage, or rather the\ncount's, stopped before the Hotel de Londres. Dinner was waiting, but\nas Albert had told him that he should not return so soon, Franz sat down\nwithout him. Signor Pastrini, who had been accustomed to see them dine\ntogether, inquired into the cause of his absence, but Franz merely\nreplied that Albert had received on the previous evening an invitation\nwhich he had accepted. The sudden extinction of the moccoletti, the\ndarkness which had replaced the light, and the silence which had\nsucceeded the turmoil, had left in Franz's mind a certain depression\nwhich was not free from uneasiness. He therefore dined very silently, in\nspite of the officious attention of his host, who presented himself two\nor three times to inquire if he wanted anything.\n\nFranz resolved to wait for Albert as late as possible. He ordered the\ncarriage, therefore, for eleven o'clock, desiring Signor Pastrini to\ninform him the moment that Albert returned to the hotel. At eleven\no'clock Albert had not come back. Franz dressed himself, and went out,\ntelling his host that he was going to pass the night at the Duke of\nBracciano's. The house of the Duke of Bracciano is one of the most\ndelightful in Rome, the duchess, one of the last heiresses of the\nColonnas, does its honors with the most consummate grace, and thus their\nfetes have a European celebrity. Franz and Albert had brought to Rome\nletters of introduction to them, and their first question on his arrival\nwas to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling companion. Franz\nreplied that he had left him at the moment they were about to extinguish\nthe moccoli, and that he had lost sight of him in the Via Macello. \"Then\nhe has not returned?\" said the duke.\n\n\"I waited for him until this hour,\" replied Franz.\n\n\"And do you know whither he went?\"\n\n\"No, not precisely; however, I think it was something very like a\nrendezvous.\"\n\n\"Diavolo!\" said the duke, \"this is a bad day, or rather a bad night,\nto be out late; is it not, countess!\" These words were addressed to\nthe Countess G----, who had just arrived, and was leaning on the arm of\nSignor Torlonia, the duke's brother.\n\n\"I think, on the contrary, that it is a charming night,\" replied the\ncountess, \"and those who are here will complain of but one thing--its\ntoo rapid flight.\"\n\n\"I am not speaking,\" said the duke with a smile, \"of the persons who are\nhere; the men run no other danger than that of falling in love with\nyou, and the women of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely; I\nmeant persons who were out in the streets of Rome.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" asked the countess, \"who is out in the streets of Rome at this\nhour, unless it be to go to a ball?\"\n\n\"Our friend, Albert de Morcerf, countess, whom I left in pursuit of his\nunknown about seven o'clock this evening,\" said Franz, \"and whom I have\nnot seen since.\"\n\n\"And don't you know where he is?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Is he armed?\"\n\n\"He is in masquerade.\"\n\n\"You should not have allowed him to go,\" said the duke to Franz; \"you,\nwho know Rome better than he does.\"\n\n\"You might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi, who\ngained the prize in the race to-day,\" replied Franz; \"and then moreover,\nwhat could happen to him?\"\n\n\"Who can tell? The night is gloomy, and the Tiber is very near the Via\nMacello.\" Franz felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that\nthe feeling of the duke and the countess was so much in unison with his\nown personal disquietude. \"I informed them at the hotel that I had the\nhonor of passing the night here, duke,\" said Franz, \"and desired them to\ncome and inform me of his return.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" replied the duke, \"here I think, is one of my servants who is\nseeking you.\"\n\nThe duke was not mistaken; when he saw Franz, the servant came up to\nhim. \"Your excellency,\" he said, \"the master of the Hotel de Londres has\nsent to let you know that a man is waiting for you with a letter from\nthe Viscount of Morcerf.\"\n\n\"A letter from the viscount!\" exclaimed Franz.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And who is the man?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Why did he not bring it to me here?\"\n\n\"The messenger did not say.\"\n\n\"And where is the messenger?\"\n\n\"He went away directly he saw me enter the ball-room to find you.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the countess to Franz, \"go with all speed--poor young man!\nPerhaps some accident has happened to him.\"\n\n\"I will hasten,\" replied Franz.\n\n\"Shall we see you again to give us any information?\" inquired the\ncountess.\n\n\"Yes, if it is not any serious affair, otherwise I cannot answer as to\nwhat I may do myself.\"\n\n\"Be prudent, in any event,\" said the countess.\n\n\"Oh, pray be assured of that.\" Franz took his hat and went away in\nhaste. He had sent away his carriage with orders for it to fetch him at\ntwo o'clock; fortunately the Palazzo Bracciano, which is on one side\nin the Corso, and on the other in the Square of the Holy Apostles, is\nhardly ten minutes' walk from the Hotel de Londres. As he came near the\nhotel, Franz saw a man in the middle of the street. He had no doubt\nthat it was the messenger from Albert. The man was wrapped up in a large\ncloak. He went up to him, but, to his extreme astonishment, the stranger\nfirst addressed him. \"What wants your excellency of me?\" inquired the\nman, retreating a step or two, as if to keep on his guard.\n\n\"Are not you the person who brought me a letter,\" inquired Franz, \"from\nthe Viscount of Morcerf?\"\n\n\"Your excellency lodges at Pastrini's hotel?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Your excellency is the travelling companion of the viscount?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"Your excellency's name\"--\n\n\"Is the Baron Franz d'Epinay.\"\n\n\"Then it is to your excellency that this letter is addressed.\"\n\n\"Is there any answer?\" inquired Franz, taking the letter from him.\n\n\"Yes--your friend at least hopes so.\"\n\n\"Come up-stairs with me, and I will give it to you.\"\n\n\"I prefer waiting here,\" said the messenger, with a smile.\n\n\"And why?\"\n\n\"Your excellency will know when you have read the letter.\"\n\n\"Shall I find you here, then?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nFranz entered the hotel. On the staircase he met Signor Pastrini.\n\"Well?\" said the landlord.\n\n\"Well--what?\" responded Franz.\n\n\"You have seen the man who desired to speak with you from your friend?\"\nhe asked of Franz.\n\n\"Yes, I have seen him,\" he replied, \"and he has handed this letter to\nme. Light the candles in my apartment, if you please.\" The inn-keeper\ngave orders to a servant to go before Franz with a light. The young man\nhad found Signor Pastrini looking very much alarmed, and this had\nonly made him the more anxious to read Albert's letter; and so he went\ninstantly towards the waxlight, and unfolded it. It was written and\nsigned by Albert. Franz read it twice before he could comprehend what it\ncontained. It was thus worded:--\n\nMy Dear Fellow,--The moment you have received this, have the kindness\nto take the letter of credit from my pocket-book, which you will find\nin the square drawer of the secretary; add your own to it, if it be\nnot sufficient. Run to Torlonia, draw from him instantly four thousand\npiastres, and give them to the bearer. It is urgent that I should have\nthis money without delay. I do not say more, relying on you as you may\nrely on me. Your friend,\n\nAlbert de Morcerf.\n\nP.S.--I now believe in Italian banditti.\n\nBelow these lines were written, in a strange hand, the following in\nItalian:--\n\nSe alle sei della mattina le quattro mile piastre non sono nelle mie\nmani, alla sette il conte Alberto avra cessato di vivere.\n\nLuigi Vampa.\n\n\"If by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my\nhands, by seven o'clock the Count Albert will have ceased to live.\"\n\nThis second signature explained everything to Franz, who now understood\nthe objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment; the\nstreet was safer for him. Albert, then, had fallen into the hands of\nthe famous bandit chief, in whose existence he had for so long a time\nrefused to believe. There was no time to lose. He hastened to open the\nsecretary, and found the pocket-book in the drawer, and in it the letter\nof credit. There were in all six thousand piastres, but of these six\nthousand Albert had already expended three thousand. As to Franz, he had\nno letter of credit, as he lived at Florence, and had only come to Rome\nto pass seven or eight days; he had brought but a hundred louis, and\nof these he had not more than fifty left. Thus seven or eight hundred\npiastres were wanting to them both to make up the sum that Albert\nrequired. True, he might in such a case rely on the kindness of Signor\nTorlonia. He was, therefore, about to return to the Palazzo Bracciano\nwithout loss of time, when suddenly a luminous idea crossed his mind. He\nremembered the Count of Monte Cristo. Franz was about to ring for Signor\nPastrini, when that worthy presented himself. \"My dear sir,\" he said,\nhastily, \"do you know if the count is within?\"\n\n\"Yes, your excellency; he has this moment returned.\"\n\n\"Is he in bed?\"\n\n\"I should say no.\"\n\n\"Then ring at his door, if you please, and request him to be so kind\nas to give me an audience.\" Signor Pastrini did as he was desired,\nand returning five minutes after, he said,--\"The count awaits your\nexcellency.\" Franz went along the corridor, and a servant introduced him\nto the count. He was in a small room which Franz had not yet seen, and\nwhich was surrounded with divans. The count came towards him. \"Well,\nwhat good wind blows you hither at this hour?\" said he; \"have you come\nto sup with me? It would be very kind of you.\"\n\n\"No; I have come to speak to you of a very serious matter.\"\n\n\"A serious matter,\" said the count, looking at Franz with the\nearnestness usual to him; \"and what may it be?\"\n\n\"Are we alone?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the count, going to the door, and returning. Franz gave\nhim Albert's letter. \"Read that,\" he said. The count read it.\n\n\"Well, well!\" said he.\n\n\"Did you see the postscript?\"\n\n\"I did, indeed.\n\n\"'Se alle sei della mattina le quattro mile piastre non sono nelle mie\nmani, alla sette il conte Alberto avra cessato di vivere.\n\n\"'Luigi Vampa.'\"\n\n\"What think you of that?\" inquired Franz.\n\n\"Have you the money he demands?\"\n\n\"Yes, all but eight hundred piastres.\" The count went to his secretary,\nopened it, and pulling out a drawer filled with gold, said to Franz,--\"I\nhope you will not offend me by applying to any one but myself.\"\n\n\"You see, on the contrary, I come to you first and instantly,\" replied\nFranz.\n\n\"And I thank you; have what you will;\" and he made a sign to Franz to\ntake what he pleased.\n\n\"Is it absolutely necessary, then, to send the money to Luigi Vampa?\"\nasked the young man, looking fixedly in his turn at the count.\n\n\"Judge for yourself,\" replied he. \"The postscript is explicit.\"\n\n\"I think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting, you could\nfind a way of simplifying the negotiation,\" said Franz.\n\n\"How so?\" returned the count, with surprise.\n\n\"If we were to go together to Luigi Vampa, I am sure he would not refuse\nyou Albert's freedom.\"\n\n\"What influence can I possibly have over a bandit?\"\n\n\"Have you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten?\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Have you not saved Peppino's life?\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said the count, \"who told you that?\"\n\n\"No matter; I know it.\" The count knit his brows, and remained silent an\ninstant. \"And if I went to seek Vampa, would you accompany me?\"\n\n\"If my society would not be disagreeable.\"\n\n\"Be it so. It is a lovely night, and a walk without Rome will do us both\ngood.\"\n\n\"Shall I take any arms?\"\n\n\"For what purpose?\"\n\n\"Any money?\"\n\n\"It is useless. Where is the man who brought the letter?\"\n\n\"In the street.\"\n\n\"He awaits the answer?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I must learn where we are going. I will summon him hither.\"\n\n\"It is useless; he would not come up.\"\n\n\"To your apartments, perhaps; but he will not make any difficulty at\nentering mine.\" The count went to the window of the apartment that\nlooked on to the street, and whistled in a peculiar manner. The man in\nthe mantle quitted the wall, and advanced into the middle of the street.\n\"Salite!\" said the count, in the same tone in which he would have\ngiven an order to his servant. The messenger obeyed without the least\nhesitation, but rather with alacrity, and, mounting the steps at a\nbound, entered the hotel; five seconds afterwards he was at the door of\nthe room. \"Ah, it is you, Peppino,\" said the count. But Peppino, instead\nof answering, threw himself on his knees, seized the count's hand,\nand covered it with kisses. \"Ah,\" said the count, \"you have, then, not\nforgotten that I saved your life; that is strange, for it is a week\nago.\"\n\n\"No, excellency; and never shall I forget it,\" returned Peppino, with an\naccent of profound gratitude.\n\n\"Never? That is a long time; but it is something that you believe so.\nRise and answer.\" Peppino glanced anxiously at Franz. \"Oh, you may speak\nbefore his excellency,\" said he; \"he is one of my friends. You allow me\nto give you this title?\" continued the count in French, \"it is necessary\nto excite this man's confidence.\"\n\n\"You can speak before me,\" said Franz; \"I am a friend of the count's.\"\n\n\"Good!\" returned Peppino. \"I am ready to answer any questions your\nexcellency may address to me.\"\n\n\"How did the Viscount Albert fall into Luigi's hands?\"\n\n\"Excellency, the Frenchman's carriage passed several times the one in\nwhich was Teresa.\"\n\n\"The chief's mistress?\"\n\n\"Yes. The Frenchman threw her a bouquet; Teresa returned it--all this\nwith the consent of the chief, who was in the carriage.\"\n\n\"What?\" cried Franz, \"was Luigi Vampa in the carriage with the Roman\npeasants?\"\n\n\"It was he who drove, disguised as the coachman,\" replied Peppino.\n\n\"Well?\" said the count.\n\n\"Well, then, the Frenchman took off his mask; Teresa, with the chief's\nconsent, did the same. The Frenchman asked for a rendezvous; Teresa gave\nhim one--only, instead of Teresa, it was Beppo who was on the steps of\nthe church of San Giacomo.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Franz, \"the peasant girl who snatched his mocoletto\nfrom him\"--\n\n\"Was a lad of fifteen,\" replied Peppino. \"But it was no disgrace to your\nfriend to have been deceived; Beppo has taken in plenty of others.\"\n\n\"And Beppo led him outside the walls?\" said the count.\n\n\"Exactly so; a carriage was waiting at the end of the Via Macello. Beppo\ngot in, inviting the Frenchman to follow him, and he did not wait to be\nasked twice. He gallantly offered the right-hand seat to Beppo, and sat\nby him. Beppo told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from\nRome; the Frenchman assured him he would follow him to the end of the\nworld. The coachman went up the Via di Ripetta and the Porta San Paola;\nand when they were two hundred yards outside, as the Frenchman became\nsomewhat too forward, Beppo put a brace of pistols to his head, the\ncoachman pulled up and did the same. At the same time, four of the band,\nwho were concealed on the banks of the Almo, surrounded the carriage.\nThe Frenchman made some resistance, and nearly strangled Beppo; but he\ncould not resist five armed men, and was forced to yield. They made\nhim get out, walk along the banks of the river, and then brought him\nto Teresa and Luigi, who were waiting for him in the catacombs of St.\nSebastian.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the count, turning towards Franz, \"it seems to me that this\nis a very likely story. What do you say to it?\"\n\n\"Why, that I should think it very amusing,\" replied Franz, \"if it had\nhappened to any one but poor Albert.\"\n\n\"And, in truth, if you had not found me here,\" said the count, \"it might\nhave proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your friend dear;\nbut now, be assured, his alarm will be the only serious consequence.\"\n\n\"And shall we go and find him?\" inquired Franz.\n\n\"Oh, decidedly, sir. He is in a very picturesque place--do you know the\ncatacombs of St. Sebastian?\"\n\n\"I was never in them; but I have often resolved to visit them.\"\n\n\"Well, here is an opportunity made to your hand, and it would be\ndifficult to contrive a better. Have you a carriage?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"That is of no consequence; I always have one ready, day and night.\"\n\n\"Always ready?\"\n\n\"Yes. I am a very capricious being, and I should tell you that sometimes\nwhen I rise, or after my dinner, or in the middle of the night, I\nresolve on starting for some particular point, and away I go.\" The count\nrang, and a footman appeared. \"Order out the carriage,\" he said, \"and\nremove the pistols which are in the holsters. You need not awaken the\ncoachman; Ali will drive.\" In a very short time the noise of wheels\nwas heard, and the carriage stopped at the door. The count took out his\nwatch. \"Half-past twelve,\" he said. \"We might start at five o'clock and\nbe in time, but the delay may cause your friend to pass an uneasy night,\nand therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the\nhands of the infidels. Are you still resolved to accompany me?\"\n\n\"More determined than ever.\"\n\n\"Well, then, come along.\"\n\nFranz and the count went downstairs, accompanied by Peppino. At the door\nthey found the carriage. Ali was on the box, in whom Franz recognized\nthe dumb slave of the grotto of Monte Cristo. Franz and the count got\ninto the carriage. Peppino placed himself beside Ali, and they set off\nat a rapid pace. Ali had received his instructions, and went down the\nCorso, crossed the Campo Vaccino, went up the Strada San Gregorio,\nand reached the gates of St. Sebastian. Then the porter raised some\ndifficulties, but the Count of Monte Cristo produced a permit from the\ngovernor of Rome, allowing him to leave or enter the city at any hour of\nthe day or night; the portcullis was therefore raised, the porter had\na louis for his trouble, and they went on their way. The road which the\ncarriage now traversed was the ancient Appian Way, and bordered with\ntombs. From time to time, by the light of the moon, which began to rise,\nFranz imagined that he saw something like a sentinel appear at various\npoints among the ruins, and suddenly retreat into the darkness on a\nsignal from Peppino. A short time before they reached the Baths of\nCaracalla the carriage stopped, Peppino opened the door, and the count\nand Franz alighted.\n\n\"In ten minutes,\" said the count to his companion, \"we shall be there.\"\n\nHe then took Peppino aside, gave him an order in a low voice, and\nPeppino went away, taking with him a torch, brought with them in the\ncarriage. Five minutes elapsed, during which Franz saw the shepherd\ngoing along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface\nof the Campagna; and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall\nred herbage, which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion.\n\"Now,\" said the count, \"let us follow him.\" Franz and the count in their\nturn then advanced along the same path, which, at the distance of\na hundred paces, led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small\nvalley. They then perceived two men conversing in the obscurity. \"Ought\nwe to go on?\" asked Franz of the count; \"or shall we wait awhile?\"\n\n\"Let us go on; Peppino will have warned the sentry of our coming.\" One\nof the two men was Peppino, and the other a bandit on the lookout. Franz\nand the count advanced, and the bandit saluted them. \"Your excellency,\"\nsaid Peppino, addressing the count, \"if you will follow me, the opening\nof the catacombs is close at hand.\"\n\n\"Go on, then,\" replied the count. They came to an opening behind a clump\nof bushes and in the midst of a pile of rocks, by which a man could\nscarcely pass. Peppino glided first into this crevice; after they got\nalong a few paces the passage widened. Peppino passed, lighted his\ntorch, and turned to see if they came after him. The count first reached\nan open space and Franz followed him closely. The passageway sloped in\na gentle descent, enlarging as they proceeded; still Franz and the count\nwere compelled to advance in a stooping posture, and were scarcely able\nto proceed abreast of one another. They went on a hundred and fifty\npaces in this way, and then were stopped by, \"Who comes there?\" At the\nsame time they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel.\n\n\"A friend!\" responded Peppino; and, advancing alone towards the sentry,\nhe said a few words to him in a low tone; and then he, like the first,\nsaluted the nocturnal visitors, making a sign that they might proceed.\n\nBehind the sentinel was a staircase with twenty steps. Franz and the\ncount descended these, and found themselves in a mortuary chamber. Five\ncorridors diverged like the rays of a star, and the walls, dug into\nniches, which were arranged one above the other in the shape of\ncoffins, showed that they were at last in the catacombs. Down one of the\ncorridors, whose extent it was impossible to determine, rays of light\nwere visible. The count laid his hand on Franz's shoulder. \"Would you\nlike to see a camp of bandits in repose?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Exceedingly,\" replied Franz.\n\n\"Come with me, then. Peppino, put out the torch.\" Peppino obeyed, and\nFranz and the count were in utter darkness, except that fifty paces in\nadvance of them a reddish glare, more evident since Peppino had put out\nhis torch, was visible along the wall. They advanced silently, the count\nguiding Franz as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark.\nFranz himself, however, saw his way more plainly in proportion as he\nwent on towards the light, which served in some manner as a guide. Three\narcades were before them, and the middle one was used as a door. These\narcades opened on one side into the corridor where the count and Franz\nwere, and on the other into a large square chamber, entirely surrounded\nby niches similar to those of which we have spoken. In the midst of this\nchamber were four stones, which had formerly served as an altar, as was\nevident from the cross which still surmounted them. A lamp, placed at\nthe base of a pillar, lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the\nsingular scene which presented itself to the eyes of the two visitors\nconcealed in the shadow. A man was seated with his elbow leaning on the\ncolumn, and was reading with his back turned to the arcades, through the\nopenings of which the new-comers contemplated him. This was the chief\nof the band, Luigi Vampa. Around him, and in groups, according to their\nfancy, lying in their mantles, or with their backs against a sort of\nstone bench, which went all round the columbarium, were to be seen\ntwenty brigands or more, each having his carbine within reach. At the\nother end, silent, scarcely visible, and like a shadow, was a\nsentinel, who was walking up and down before a grotto, which was only\ndistinguishable because in that spot the darkness seemed more dense than\nelsewhere. When the count thought Franz had gazed sufficiently on this\npicturesque tableau, he raised his finger to his lips, to warn him to be\nsilent, and, ascending the three steps which led to the corridor of\nthe columbarium, entered the chamber by the middle arcade, and advanced\ntowards Vampa, who was so intent on the book before him that he did not\nhear the noise of his footsteps.\n\n\"Who comes there?\" cried the sentinel, who was less abstracted, and who\nsaw by the lamp-light a shadow approaching his chief. At this challenge,\nVampa rose quickly, drawing at the same moment a pistol from his girdle.\nIn a moment all the bandits were on their feet, and twenty carbines were\nlevelled at the count. \"Well,\" said he in a voice perfectly calm, and no\nmuscle of his countenance disturbed, \"well, my dear Vampa, it appears to\nme that you receive a friend with a great deal of ceremony.\"\n\n\"Ground arms,\" exclaimed the chief, with an imperative sign of the hand,\nwhile with the other he took off his hat respectfully; then, turning to\nthe singular personage who had caused this scene, he said, \"Your pardon,\nyour excellency, but I was so far from expecting the honor of a visit,\nthat I did not really recognize you.\"\n\n\"It seems that your memory is equally short in everything, Vampa,\" said\nthe count, \"and that not only do you forget people's faces, but also the\nconditions you make with them.\"\n\n\"What conditions have I forgotten, your excellency?\" inquired the\nbandit, with the air of a man who, having committed an error, is anxious\nto repair it.\n\n\"Was it not agreed,\" asked the count, \"that not only my person, but also\nthat of my friends, should be respected by you?\"\n\n\"And how have I broken that treaty, your excellency?\"\n\n\"You have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the Vicomte\nAlbert de Morcerf. Well,\" continued the count, in a tone that made\nFranz shudder, \"this young gentleman is one of my friends--this young\ngentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself--this young gentleman has\nbeen up and down the Corso for eight hours in my private carriage, and\nyet, I repeat to you, you have carried him off, and conveyed him hither,\nand,\" added the count, taking the letter from his pocket, \"you have set\na ransom on him, as if he were an utter stranger.\"\n\n\"Why did you not tell me all this--you?\" inquired the brigand chief,\nturning towards his men, who all retreated before his look. \"Why have\nyou caused me thus to fail in my word towards a gentleman like the\ncount, who has all our lives in his hands? By heavens, if I thought one\nof you knew that the young gentleman was the friend of his excellency, I\nwould blow his brains out with my own hand!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the count, turning towards Franz, \"I told you there was\nsome mistake in this.\"\n\n\"Are you not alone?\" asked Vampa with uneasiness.\n\n\"I am with the person to whom this letter was addressed, and to whom\nI desired to prove that Luigi Vampa was a man of his word. Come, your\nexcellency,\" the count added, turning to Franz, \"here is Luigi Vampa,\nwho will himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has\ncommitted.\" Franz approached, the chief advancing several steps to meet\nhim. \"Welcome among us, your excellency,\" he said to him; \"you heard\nwhat the count just said, and also my reply; let me add that I would\nnot for the four thousand piastres at which I had fixed your friend's\nransom, that this had happened.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Franz, looking round him uneasily, \"where is the\nViscount?--I do not see him.\"\n\n\"Nothing has happened to him, I hope,\" said the count frowningly.\n\n\"The prisoner is there,\" replied Vampa, pointing to the hollow space in\nfront of which the bandit was on guard, \"and I will go myself and tell\nhim he is free.\" The chief went towards the place he had pointed out\nas Albert's prison, and Franz and the count followed him. \"What is the\nprisoner doing?\" inquired Vampa of the sentinel.\n\n\"Ma foi, captain,\" replied the sentry, \"I do not know; for the last hour\nI have not heard him stir.\"\n\n\"Come in, your excellency,\" said Vampa. The count and Franz ascended\nseven or eight steps after the chief, who drew back a bolt and opened\na door. Then, by the gleam of a lamp, similar to that which lighted the\ncolumbarium, Albert was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which one of\nthe bandits had lent him, lying in a corner in profound slumber. \"Come,\"\nsaid the count, smiling with his own peculiar smile, \"not so bad for a\nman who is to be shot at seven o'clock to-morrow morning.\" Vampa looked\nat Albert with a kind of admiration; he was not insensible to such a\nproof of courage.\n\n\"You are right, your excellency,\" he said; \"this must be one of your\nfriends.\" Then going to Albert, he touched him on the shoulder, saying,\n\"Will your excellency please to awaken?\" Albert stretched out his arms,\nrubbed his eyelids, and opened his eyes. \"Oh,\" said he, \"is it you,\ncaptain? You should have allowed me to sleep. I had such a delightful\ndream. I was dancing the galop at Torlonia's with the Countess G----.\"\nThen he drew his watch from his pocket, that he might see how time sped.\n\n\"Half-past one only?\" said he. \"Why the devil do you rouse me at this\nhour?\"\n\n\"To tell you that you are free, your excellency.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" replied Albert, with perfect ease of mind, \"remember,\nfor the future, Napoleon's maxim, 'Never awaken me but for bad news;' if\nyou had let me sleep on, I should have finished my galop, and have been\ngrateful to you all my life. So, then, they have paid my ransom?\"\n\n\"No, your excellency.\"\n\n\"Well, then, how am I free?\"\n\n\"A person to whom I can refuse nothing has come to demand you.\"\n\n\"Come hither?\"\n\n\"Yes, hither.\"\n\n\"Really? Then that person is a most amiable person.\" Albert looked\naround and perceived Franz. \"What,\" said he, \"is it you, my dear Franz,\nwhose devotion and friendship are thus displayed?\"\n\n\"No, not I,\" replied Franz, \"but our neighbor, the Count of Monte\nCristo.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear count,\" said Albert gayly, arranging his cravat and\nwristbands, \"you are really most kind, and I hope you will consider\nme as under eternal obligations to you, in the first place for the\ncarriage, and in the next for this visit,\" and he put out his hand to\nthe Count, who shuddered as he gave his own, but who nevertheless did\ngive it. The bandit gazed on this scene with amazement; he was evidently\naccustomed to see his prisoners tremble before him, and yet here was one\nwhose gay temperament was not for a moment altered; as for Franz, he was\nenchanted at the way in which Albert had sustained the national honor in\nthe presence of the bandit. \"My dear Albert,\" he said, \"if you will make\nhaste, we shall yet have time to finish the night at Torlonia's. You\nmay conclude your interrupted galop, so that you will owe no ill-will to\nSignor Luigi, who has, indeed, throughout this whole affair acted like a\ngentleman.\"\n\n\"You are decidedly right, and we may reach the Palazzo by two o'clock.\nSignor Luigi,\" continued Albert, \"is there any formality to fulfil\nbefore I take leave of your excellency?\"\n\n\"None, sir,\" replied the bandit, \"you are as free as air.\"\n\n\"Well, then, a happy and merry life to you. Come, gentlemen, come.\"\n\nAnd Albert, followed by Franz and the count, descended the staircase,\ncrossed the square chamber, where stood all the bandits, hat in hand.\n\"Peppino,\" said the brigand chief, \"give me the torch.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" inquired the count.\n\n\"I will show you the way back myself,\" said the captain; \"that is\nthe least honor that I can render to your excellency.\" And taking the\nlighted torch from the hands of the herdsman, he preceded his guests,\nnot as a servant who performs an act of civility, but like a king who\nprecedes ambassadors. On reaching the door, he bowed. \"And now, your\nexcellency,\" added he, \"allow me to repeat my apologies, and I hope you\nwill not entertain any resentment at what has occurred.\"\n\n\"No, my dear Vampa,\" replied the count; \"besides, you compensate for\nyour mistakes in so gentlemanly a way, that one almost feels obliged to\nyou for having committed them.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" added the chief, turning towards the young men, \"perhaps\nthe offer may not appear very tempting to you; but if you should ever\nfeel inclined to pay me a second visit, wherever I may be, you shall be\nwelcome.\" Franz and Albert bowed. The count went out first, then Albert.\nFranz paused for a moment. \"Has your excellency anything to ask me?\"\nsaid Vampa with a smile.\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" replied Franz; \"I am curious to know what work you were\nperusing with so much attention as we entered.\"\n\n\"Caesar's 'Commentaries,'\" said the bandit, \"it is my favorite work.\"\n\n\"Well, are you coming?\" asked Albert.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Franz, \"here I am,\" and he, in his turn, left the caves.\nThey advanced to the plain. \"Ah, your pardon,\" said Albert, turning\nround; \"will you allow me, captain?\" And he lighted his cigar at Vampa's\ntorch. \"Now, my dear count,\" he said, \"let us on with all the speed\nwe may. I am enormously anxious to finish my night at the Duke of\nBracciano's.\" They found the carriage where they had left it. The count\nsaid a word in Arabic to Ali, and the horses went on at great speed. It\nwas just two o'clock by Albert's watch when the two friends entered into\nthe dancing-room. Their return was quite an event, but as they entered\ntogether, all uneasiness on Albert's account ceased instantly. \"Madame,\"\nsaid the Viscount of Morcerf, advancing towards the countess, \"yesterday\nyou were so condescending as to promise me a galop; I am rather late in\nclaiming this gracious promise, but here is my friend, whose character\nfor veracity you well know, and he will assure you the delay arose from\nno fault of mine.\" And as at this moment the orchestra gave the signal\nfor the waltz, Albert put his arm round the waist of the countess, and\ndisappeared with her in the whirl of dancers. In the meanwhile Franz was\nconsidering the singular shudder that had passed over the Count of Monte\nCristo at the moment when he had been, in some sort, forced to give his\nhand to Albert.\n\n\n\nChapter 38. The Compact.\n\nThe first words that Albert uttered to his friend, on the following\nmorning, contained a request that Franz would accompany him on a visit\nto the count; true, the young man had warmly and energetically thanked\nthe count on the previous evening; but services such as he had rendered\ncould never be too often acknowledged. Franz, who seemed attracted\nby some invisible influence towards the count, in which terror was\nstrangely mingled, felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be\nexposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage\nseemed to exercise over him, and therefore made no objection to Albert's\nrequest, but at once accompanied him to the desired spot, and, after a\nshort delay, the count joined them in the salon. \"My dear count,\" said\nAlbert, advancing to meet him, \"permit me to repeat the poor thanks I\noffered last night, and to assure you that the remembrance of all I owe\nto you will never be effaced from my memory; believe me, as long as I\nlive, I shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the\nprompt and important service you rendered me; and also to remember that\nto you I am indebted even for my life.\"\n\n\"My very good friend and excellent neighbor,\" replied the count, with a\nsmile, \"you really exaggerate my trifling exertions. You owe me nothing\nbut some trifle of 20,000. francs, which you have been saved out of\nyour travelling expenses, so that there is not much of a score between\nus;--but you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and\nunconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate, and the perfect\nindifference you manifested as to the turn events might take.\"\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Albert, \"I deserve no credit for what I could not\nhelp, namely, a determination to take everything as I found it, and to\nlet those bandits see, that although men get into troublesome scrapes\nall over the world, there is no nation but the French that can smile\neven in the face of grim Death himself. All that, however, has nothing\nto do with my obligations to you, and I now come to ask you whether, in\nmy own person, my family, or connections, I can in any way serve you?\nMy father, the Comte de Morcerf, although of Spanish origin, possesses\nconsiderable influence, both at the court of France and Madrid, and I\nunhesitatingly place the best services of myself, and all to whom my\nlife is dear, at your disposal.\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Morcerf,\" replied the count, \"your offer, far from\nsurprising me, is precisely what I expected from you, and I accept it in\nthe same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made;--nay, I will\ngo still further, and say that I had previously made up my mind to ask a\ngreat favor at your hands.\"\n\n\"Oh, pray name it.\"\n\n\"I am wholly a stranger to Paris--it is a city I have never yet seen.\"\n\n\"Is it possible,\" exclaimed Albert, \"that you have reached your present\nage without visiting the finest capital in the world? I can scarcely\ncredit it.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, it is quite true; still, I agree with you in thinking\nthat my present ignorance of the first city in Europe is a reproach\nto me in every way, and calls for immediate correction; but, in all\nprobability, I should have performed so important, so necessary a duty,\nas that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of\nyour justly celebrated capital, had I known any person who would have\nintroduced me into the fashionable world, but unfortunately I possessed\nno acquaintance there, and, of necessity, was compelled to abandon the\nidea.\"\n\n\"So distinguished an individual as yourself,\" cried Albert, \"could\nscarcely have required an introduction.\"\n\n\"You are most kind; but as regards myself, I can find no merit I\npossess, save that, as a millionaire, I might have become a partner in\nthe speculations of M. Aguado and M. Rothschild; but as my motive in\ntravelling to your capital would not have been for the pleasure of\ndabbling in stocks, I stayed away till some favorable chance should\npresent itself of carrying my wish into execution. Your offer, however,\nsmooths all difficulties, and I have only to ask you, my dear M. de\nMorcerf\" (these words were accompanied by a most peculiar smile),\n\"whether you undertake, upon my arrival in France, to open to me the\ndoors of that fashionable world of which I know no more than a Huron or\na native of Cochin-China?\"\n\n\"Oh, that I do, and with infinite pleasure,\" answered Albert; \"and so\nmuch the more readily as a letter received this morning from my father\nsummons me to Paris, in consequence of a treaty of marriage (my dear\nFranz, do not smile, I beg of you) with a family of high standing, and\nconnected with the very cream of Parisian society.\"\n\n\"Connected by marriage, you mean,\" said Franz, laughingly.\n\n\"Well, never mind how it is,\" answered Albert, \"it comes to the same\nthing in the end. Perhaps by the time you return to Paris, I shall be\nquite a sober, staid father of a family! A most edifying representative\nI shall make of all the domestic virtues--don't you think so? But as\nregards your wish to visit our fine city, my dear count, I can only say\nthat you may command me and mine to any extent you please.\"\n\n\"Then it is settled,\" said the count, \"and I give you my solemn\nassurance that I only waited an opportunity like the present to realize\nplans that I have long meditated.\" Franz did not doubt that these plans\nwere the same concerning which the count had dropped a few words in the\ngrotto of Monte Cristo, and while the Count was speaking the young man\nwatched him closely, hoping to read something of his purpose in his\nface, but his countenance was inscrutable especially when, as in the\npresent case, it was veiled in a sphinx-like smile. \"But tell me now,\ncount,\" exclaimed Albert, delighted at the idea of having to chaperon so\ndistinguished a person as Monte Cristo; \"tell me truly whether you are\nin earnest, or if this project of visiting Paris is merely one of the\nchimerical and uncertain air castles of which we make so many in the\ncourse of our lives, but which, like a house built on the sand, is\nliable to be blown over by the first puff of wind?\"\n\n\"I pledge you my honor,\" returned the count, \"that I mean to do as I\nhave said; both inclination and positive necessity compel me to visit\nParis.\"\n\n\"When do you propose going thither?\"\n\n\"Have you made up your mind when you shall be there yourself?\"\n\n\"Certainly I have; in a fortnight or three weeks' time, that is to say,\nas fast as I can get there!\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the Count; \"I will give you three months ere I join you; you\nsee I make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties.\n\n\"And in three months' time,\" said Albert, \"you will be at my house?\"\n\n\"Shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour?\"\ninquired the count; \"only let me warn you that I am proverbial for my\npunctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements.\"\n\n\"Day for day, hour for hour,\" said Albert; \"that will suit me to a dot.\"\n\n\"So be it, then,\" replied the count, and extending his hand towards a\ncalendar, suspended near the chimney-piece, he said, \"to-day is the 21st\nof February;\" and drawing out his watch, added, \"it is exactly half-past\nten o'clock. Now promise me to remember this, and expect me the 21st of\nMay at the same hour in the forenoon.\"\n\n\"Capital,\" exclaimed Albert; \"your breakfast shall be waiting.\"\n\n\"Where do you live?\"\n\n\"No. 27, Rue du Helder.\"\n\n\"Have you bachelor's apartments there? I hope my coming will not put you\nto any inconvenience.\"\n\n\"I reside in my father's house, but occupy a pavilion at the farther\nside of the court-yard, entirely separated from the main building.\"\n\n\"Quite sufficient,\" replied the count, as, taking out his tablets,\nhe wrote down \"No. 27, Rue du Helder, 21st May, half-past ten in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Now then,\" said the count, returning his tablets to his pocket, \"make\nyourself perfectly easy; the hand of your time-piece will not be more\naccurate in marking the time than myself.\"\n\n\"Shall I see you again ere my departure?\" asked Albert.\n\n\"That depends; when do you leave?\"\n\n\"To-morrow evening, at five o'clock.\"\n\n\"In that case I must say adieu to you, as I am compelled to go to\nNaples, and shall not return hither before Saturday evening or Sunday\nmorning. And you, baron,\" pursued the count, addressing Franz, \"do you\nalso depart to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"For France?\"\n\n\"No, for Venice; I shall remain in Italy for another year or two.\"\n\n\"Then we shall not meet in Paris?\"\n\n\"I fear I shall not have that honor.\"\n\n\"Well, since we must part,\" said the count, holding out a hand to\neach of the young men, \"allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant\njourney.\" It was the first time the hand of Franz had come in contact\nwith that of the mysterious individual before him, and unconsciously he\nshuddered at its touch, for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse.\n\"Let us understand each other,\" said Albert; \"it is agreed--is it\nnot?--that you are to be at No. 27, in the Rue du Helder, on the 21st of\nMay, at half-past ten in the morning, and your word of honor passed for\nyour punctuality?\"\n\n\"The 21st of May, at half-past ten in the morning, Rue du Helder, No.\n27,\" replied the Count. The young men then rose, and bowing to the\ncount, quitted the room. \"What is the matter?\" asked Albert of Franz,\nwhen they had returned to their own apartments; \"you seem more than\ncommonly thoughtful.\"\n\n\"I will confess to you, Albert,\" replied Franz, \"the count is a very\nsingular person, and the appointment you have made to meet him in Paris\nfills me with a thousand apprehensions.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" exclaimed Albert, \"what can there possibly be in that\nto excite uneasiness? Why, you must have lost your senses.\"\n\n\"Whether I am in my senses or not,\" answered Franz, \"that is the way I\nfeel.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Franz,\" said Albert; \"I am glad that the occasion has\npresented itself for saying this to you, for I have noticed how cold you\nare in your bearing towards the count, while he, on the other hand, has\nalways been courtesy itself to us. Have you anything particular against\nhim?\"\n\n\"Possibly.\"\n\n\"Did you ever meet him previously to coming hither?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"And where?\"\n\n\"Will you promise me not to repeat a single word of what I am about to\ntell you?\"\n\n\"I promise.\"\n\n\"Upon your honor?\"\n\n\"Upon my honor.\"\n\n\"Then listen to me.\" Franz then related to his friend the history of his\nexcursion to the Island of Monte Cristo and of his finding a party of\nsmugglers there, and the two Corsican bandits with them. He dwelt with\nconsiderable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had\nreceived from the count, and the magnificence of his entertainment\nin the grotto of the \"Thousand and One Nights.\" He recounted, with\ncircumstantial exactitude, all the particulars of the supper, the\nhashish, the statues, the dream, and how, at his awakening, there\nremained no proof or trace of all these events, save the small\nyacht, seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward\nPorto-Vecchio. Then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the\nColosseum, between the count and Vampa, in which the count had promised\nto obtain the release of the bandit Peppino,--an engagement which, as\nour readers are aware, he most faithfully fulfilled. At last he arrived\nat the adventure of the preceding night, and the embarrassment in which\nhe found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven\nhundred piastres to make up the sum required, and finally of his\napplication to the count and the picturesque and satisfactory result\nthat followed. Albert listened with the most profound attention. \"Well,\"\nsaid he, when Franz had concluded, \"what do you find to object to in\nall you have related? The count is fond of travelling, and, being rich,\npossesses a vessel of his own. Go but to Portsmouth or Southampton, and\nyou will find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of\nthe English as can afford the expense, and have the same liking for this\namusement. Now, by way of having a resting-place during his excursions,\navoiding the wretched cookery--which has been trying its best to poison\nme during the last four months, while you have manfully resisted its\neffects for as many years,--and obtaining a bed on which it is possible\nto slumber, Monte Cristo has furnished for himself a temporary abode\nwhere you first found him; but, to prevent the possibility of the Tuscan\ngovernment taking a fancy to his enchanted palace, and thereby depriving\nhim of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of\ncapital, he has wisely enough purchased the island, and taken its name.\nJust ask yourself, my good fellow, whether there are not many persons of\nour acquaintance who assume the names of lands and properties they never\nin their lives were masters of?\"\n\n\"But,\" said Franz, \"the Corsican bandits that were among the crew of his\nvessel?\"\n\n\"Why, really the thing seems to me simple enough. Nobody knows better\nthan yourself that the bandits of Corsica are not rogues or thieves, but\npurely and simply fugitives, driven by some sinister motive from their\nnative town or village, and that their fellowship involves no disgrace\nor stigma; for my own part, I protest that, should I ever go to Corsica,\nmy first visit, ere even I presented myself to the mayor or prefect,\nshould be to the bandits of Colomba, if I could only manage to find\nthem; for, on my conscience, they are a race of men I admire greatly.\"\n\n\"Still,\" persisted Franz, \"I suppose you will allow that such men as\nVampa and his band are regular villains, who have no other motive than\nplunder when they seize your person. How do you explain the influence\nthe count evidently possessed over those ruffians?\"\n\n\"My good friend, as in all probability I own my present safety to that\ninfluence, it would ill become me to search too closely into its source;\ntherefore, instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws, you\nmust give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in\nsuch a connection; not altogether for preserving my life, for my own\nidea was that it never was in much danger, but certainly for saving me\n4,000 piastres, which, being translated, means neither more nor less\nthan 24,000 livres of our money--a sum at which, most assuredly, I\nshould never have been estimated in France, proving most indisputably,\"\nadded Albert with a laugh, \"that no prophet is honored in his own\ncountry.\"\n\n\"Talking of countries,\" replied Franz, \"of what country is the count,\nwhat is his native tongue, whence does he derive his immense fortune,\nand what were those events of his early life--a life as marvellous\nas unknown--that have tinctured his succeeding years with so dark and\ngloomy a misanthropy? Certainly these are questions that, in your place,\nI should like to have answered.\"\n\n\"My dear Franz,\" replied Albert, \"when, upon receipt of my letter, you\nfound the necessity of asking the count's assistance, you promptly went\nto him, saying, 'My friend Albert de Morcerf is in danger; help me to\ndeliver him.' Was not that nearly what you said?\"\n\n\"It was.\"\n\n\"Well, then, did he ask you, 'Who is M. Albert de Morcerf? how does he\ncome by his name--his fortune? what are his means of existence? what is\nhis birthplace! of what country is he a native?' Tell me, did he put all\nthese questions to you?\"\n\n\"I confess he asked me none.\"\n\n\"No; he merely came and freed me from the hands of Signor Vampa, where,\nI can assure you, in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and\nunconcern, I did not very particularly care to remain. Now, then, Franz,\nwhen, for services so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered, he but asks\nme in return to do for him what is done daily for any Russian prince\nor Italian nobleman who may pass through Paris--merely to introduce him\ninto society--would you have me refuse? My good fellow, you must have\nlost your senses to think it possible I could act with such cold-blooded\npolicy.\" And this time it must be confessed that, contrary to the usual\nstate of affairs in discussions between the young men, the effective\narguments were all on Albert's side.\n\n\"Well,\" said Franz with a sigh, \"do as you please my dear viscount, for\nyour arguments are beyond my powers of refutation. Still, in spite of\nall, you must admit that this Count of Monte Cristo is a most singular\npersonage.\"\n\n\"He is a philanthropist,\" answered the other; \"and no doubt his motive\nin visiting Paris is to compete for the Monthyon prize, given, as you\nare aware, to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced\nthe interests of virtue and humanity. If my vote and interest can obtain\nit for him, I will readily give him the one and promise the other. And\nnow, my dear Franz, let us talk of something else. Come, shall we take\nour luncheon, and then pay a last visit to St. Peter's?\" Franz silently\nassented; and the following afternoon, at half-past five o'clock,\nthe young men parted. Albert de Morcerf to return to Paris, and\nFranz d'Epinay to pass a fortnight at Venice. But, ere he entered his\ntravelling carriage, Albert, fearing that his expected guest might\nforget the engagement he had entered into, placed in the care of a\nwaiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the Count of Monte Cristo,\non which, beneath the name of Vicomte Albert de Morcerf, he had written\nin pencil--\"27, Rue du Helder, on the 21st May, half-past ten A.M.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 39. The Guests.\n\nIn the house in the Rue du Helder, where Albert had invited the Count of\nMonte Cristo, everything was being prepared on the morning of the\n21st of May to do honor to the occasion. Albert de Morcerf inhabited a\npavilion situated at the corner of a large court, and directly opposite\nanother building, in which were the servants' apartments. Two windows\nonly of the pavilion faced the street; three other windows looked into\nthe court, and two at the back into the garden. Between the court and\nthe garden, built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture, was\nthe large and fashionable dwelling of the Count and Countess of Morcerf.\nA high wall surrounded the whole of the hotel, surmounted at intervals\nby vases filled with flowers, and broken in the centre by a large gate\nof gilded iron, which served as the carriage entrance. A small door,\nclose to the lodge of the concierge, gave ingress and egress to the\nservants and masters when they were on foot.\n\nIt was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother, unwilling to\npart from her son, and yet aware that a young man of the viscount's age\nrequired the full exercise of his liberty, had chosen this habitation\nfor Albert. There were not lacking, however, evidences of what we may\ncall the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent,\ncareless life of an only son, and who lives as it were in a gilded cage.\nBy means of the two windows looking into the street, Albert could see\nall that passed; the sight of what is going on is necessary to young\nmen, who always want to see the world traverse their horizon, even if\nthat horizon is only a public thoroughfare. Then, should anything appear\nto merit a more minute examination, Albert de Morcerf could follow up\nhis researches by means of a small gate, similar to that close to the\nconcierge's door, and which merits a particular description. It was a\nlittle entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the house\nwas built, so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt; but the\nwell-oiled hinges and locks told quite another story. This door was a\nmockery to the concierge, from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was\nfree, and, like that famous portal in the \"Arabian Nights,\" opening at\nthe \"Sesame\" of Ali Baba, it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic\nword or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest voices or whitest\nfingers in the world. At the end of a long corridor, with which the\ndoor communicated, and which formed the ante-chamber, was, on the right,\nAlbert's breakfast-room, looking into the court, and on the left the\nsalon, looking into the garden. Shrubs and creeping plants covered the\nwindows, and hid from the garden and court these two apartments, the\nonly rooms into which, as they were on the ground-floor, the prying eyes\nof the curious could penetrate. On the floor above were similar rooms,\nwith the addition of a third, formed out of the ante-chamber;\nthese three rooms were a salon, a boudoir, and a bedroom. The salon\ndown-stairs was only an Algerian divan, for the use of smokers. The\nboudoir up-stairs communicated with the bed-chamber by an invisible door\non the staircase; it was evident that every precaution had been taken.\nAbove this floor was a large atelier, which had been increased in size\nby pulling down the partitions--a pandemonium, in which the artist and\nthe dandy strove for preeminence. There were collected and piled up all\nAlbert's successive caprices, hunting-horns, bass-viols, flutes--a whole\norchestra, for Albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music; easels,\npalettes, brushes, pencils--for music had been succeeded by painting;\nfoils, boxing-gloves, broadswords, and single-sticks--for, following\nthe example of the fashionable young men of the time, Albert de Morcerf\ncultivated, with far more perseverance than music and drawing, the\nthree arts that complete a dandy's education, i.e., fencing, boxing,\nand single-stick; and it was here that he received Grisier, Cook,\nand Charles Leboucher. The rest of the furniture of this privileged\napartment consisted of old cabinets, filled with Chinese porcelain and\nJapanese vases, Lucca della Robbia faience, and Palissy platters; of old\narm-chairs, in which perhaps had sat Henry IV. or Sully, Louis XIII. or\nRichelieu--for two of these arm-chairs, adorned with a carved shield,\non which were engraved the fleur-de-lis of France on an azure field\nevidently came from the Louvre, or, at least, some royal residence. Over\nthese dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs, dyed beneath\nPersia's sun, or woven by the fingers of the women of Calcutta or of\nChandernagor. What these stuffs did there, it was impossible to say;\nthey awaited, while gratifying the eyes, a destination unknown to their\nowner himself; in the meantime they filled the place with their golden\nand silky reflections. In the centre of the room was a Roller and\nBlanchet \"baby grand\" piano in rosewood, but holding the potentialities\nof an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity, and groaning beneath\nthe weight of the chefs-d'oeuvre of Beethoven, Weber, Mozart, Haydn,\nGretry, and Porpora. On the walls, over the doors, on the ceiling, were\nswords, daggers, Malay creeses, maces, battle-axes; gilded, damasked,\nand inlaid suits of armor; dried plants, minerals, and stuffed birds,\ntheir flame-colored wings outspread in motionless flight, and their\nbeaks forever open. This was Albert's favorite lounging place.\n\nHowever, the morning of the appointment, the young man had established\nhimself in the small salon down-stairs. There, on a table, surrounded at\nsome distance by a large and luxurious divan, every species of tobacco\nknown,--from the yellow tobacco of Petersburg to the black of Sinai,\nand so on along the scale from Maryland and Porto-Rico, to Latakia,--was\nexposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the Dutch are so fond;\nbeside them, in boxes of fragrant wood, were ranged, according to their\nsize and quality, pueros, regalias, havanas, and manillas; and, in an\nopen cabinet, a collection of German pipes, of chibouques, with their\namber mouth-pieces ornamented with coral, and of narghiles, with their\nlong tubes of morocco, awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the\nsmokers. Albert had himself presided at the arrangement, or, rather, the\nsymmetrical derangement, which, after coffee, the guests at a breakfast\nof modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from\ntheir mouths, and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling.\nAt a quarter to ten, a valet entered; he composed, with a little groom\nnamed John, and who only spoke English, all Albert's establishment,\nalthough the cook of the hotel was always at his service, and on great\noccasions the count's chasseur also. This valet, whose name was Germain,\nand who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master, held in one\nhand a number of papers, and in the other a packet of letters, which\nhe gave to Albert. Albert glanced carelessly at the different missives,\nselected two written in a small and delicate hand, and enclosed in\nscented envelopes, opened them and perused their contents with some\nattention. \"How did these letters come?\" said he.\n\n\"One by the post, Madame Danglars' footman left the other.\"\n\n\"Let Madame Danglars know that I accept the place she offers me in her\nbox. Wait; then, during the day, tell Rosa that when I leave the Opera\nI will sup with her as she wishes. Take her six bottles of different\nwine--Cyprus, sherry, and Malaga, and a barrel of Ostend oysters; get\nthem at Borel's, and be sure you say they are for me.\"\n\n\"At what o'clock, sir, do you breakfast?\"\n\n\"What time is it now?\"\n\n\"A quarter to ten.\"\n\n\"Very well, at half past ten. Debray will, perhaps, be obliged to go to\nthe minister--and besides\" (Albert looked at his tablets), \"it is the\nhour I told the count, 21st May, at half past ten; and though I do not\nmuch rely upon his promise, I wish to be punctual. Is the countess up\nyet?\"\n\n\"If you wish, I will inquire.\"\n\n\"Yes, ask her for one of her liqueur cellarets, mine is incomplete; and\ntell her I shall have the honor of seeing her about three o'clock, and\nthat I request permission to introduce some one to her.\" The valet left\nthe room. Albert threw himself on the divan, tore off the cover of two\nor three of the papers, looked at the theatre announcements, made a face\nseeing they gave an opera, and not a ballet; hunted vainly amongst the\nadvertisements for a new tooth-powder of which he had heard, and threw\ndown, one after the other, the three leading papers of Paris, muttering,\n\"These papers become more and more stupid every day.\" A moment after,\na carriage stopped before the door, and the servant announced M. Lucien\nDebray. A tall young man, with light hair, clear gray eyes, and thin\nand compressed lips, dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved gold\nbuttons, a white neckcloth, and a tortoiseshell eye-glass suspended by a\nsilken thread, and which, by an effort of the superciliary and zygomatic\nmuscles, he fixed in his eye, entered, with a half-official air, without\nsmiling or speaking. \"Good-morning, Lucien, good-morning,\" said Albert;\n\"your punctuality really alarms me. What do I say? punctuality! You,\nwhom I expected last, you arrive at five minutes to ten, when the time\nfixed was half-past! Has the ministry resigned?\"\n\n\"No, my dear fellow,\" returned the young man, seating himself on the\ndivan; \"reassure yourself; we are tottering always, but we never fall,\nand I begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility,\nand then the affairs of the Peninsula will completely consolidate us.\"\n\n\"Ah, true; you drive Don Carlos out of Spain.\"\n\n\"No, no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans. We take him to\nthe other side of the French frontier, and offer him hospitality at\nBourges.\"\n\n\"At Bourges?\"\n\n\"Yes, he has not much to complain of; Bourges is the capital of Charles\nVII. Do you not know that all Paris knew it yesterday, and the day\nbefore it had already transpired on the Bourse, and M. Danglars (I do\nnot know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon\nas we do) made a million!\"\n\n\"And you another order, for I see you have a blue ribbon at your\nbutton-hole.\"\n\n\"Yes; they sent me the order of Charles III.,\" returned Debray,\ncarelessly.\n\n\"Come, do not affect indifference, but confess you were pleased to have\nit.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is very well as a finish to the toilet. It looks very neat on a\nblack coat buttoned up.\"\n\n\"And makes you resemble the Prince of Wales or the Duke of Reichstadt.\"\n\n\"It is for that reason you see me so early.\"\n\n\"Because you have the order of Charles III., and you wish to announce\nthe good news to me?\"\n\n\"No, because I passed the night writing letters,--five and twenty\ndespatches. I returned home at daybreak, and strove to sleep; but my\nhead ached and I got up to have a ride for an hour. At the Bois de\nBoulogne, ennui and hunger attacked me at once,--two enemies who rarely\naccompany each other, and who are yet leagued against me, a sort of\nCarlo-republican alliance. I then recollected you gave a breakfast this\nmorning, and here I am. I am hungry, feed me; I am bored, amuse me.\"\n\n\"It is my duty as your host,\" returned Albert, ringing the bell, while\nLucien turned over, with his gold-mounted cane, the papers that lay on\nthe table. \"Germain, a glass of sherry and a biscuit. In the meantime,\nmy dear Lucien, here are cigars--contraband, of course--try them, and\npersuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us with\ncabbage leaves.\"\n\n\"Peste, I will do nothing of the kind; the moment they come from\ngovernment you would find them execrable. Besides, that does not concern\nthe home but the financial department. Address yourself to M. Humann,\nsection of the indirect contributions, corridor A., No. 26.\"\n\n\"On my word,\" said Albert, \"you astonish me by the extent of your\nknowledge. Take a cigar.\"\n\n\"Really, my dear Albert,\" replied Lucien, lighting a manilla at a\nrose-colored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled stand--\"how\nhappy you are to have nothing to do. You do not know your own good\nfortune!\"\n\n\"And what would you do, my dear diplomatist,\" replied Morcerf, with a\nslight degree of irony in his voice, \"if you did nothing? What? private\nsecretary to a minister, plunged at once into European cabals and\nParisian intrigues; having kings, and, better still, queens, to protect,\nparties to unite, elections to direct; making more use of your cabinet\nwith your pen and your telegraph than Napoleon did of his battle-fields\nwith his sword and his victories; possessing five and twenty thousand\nfrancs a year, besides your place; a horse, for which Chateau-Renaud\noffered you four hundred louis, and which you would not part with; a\ntailor who never disappoints you; with the opera, the jockey-club, and\nother diversions, can you not amuse yourself? Well, I will amuse you.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"By introducing to you a new acquaintance.\"\n\n\"A man or a woman?\"\n\n\"A man.\"\n\n\"I know so many men already.\"\n\n\"But you do not know this man.\"\n\n\"Where does he come from--the end of the world?\"\n\n\"Farther still, perhaps.\"\n\n\"The deuce! I hope he does not bring our breakfast with him.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; our breakfast comes from my father's kitchen. Are you hungry?\"\n\n\"Humiliating as such a confession is, I am. But I dined at M. de\nVillefort's, and lawyers always give you very bad dinners. You would\nthink they felt some remorse; did you ever remark that?\"\n\n\"Ah, depreciate other persons' dinners; you ministers give such splendid\nones.\"\n\n\"Yes; but we do not invite people of fashion. If we were not forced to\nentertain a parcel of country boobies because they think and vote with\nus, we should never dream of dining at home, I assure you.\"\n\n\"Well, take another glass of sherry and another biscuit.\"\n\n\"Willingly. Your Spanish wine is excellent. You see we were quite right\nto pacify that country.\"\n\n\"Yes; but Don Carlos?\"\n\n\"Well, Don Carlos will drink Bordeaux, and in ten years we will marry\nhis son to the little queen.\"\n\n\"You will then obtain the Golden Fleece, if you are still in the\nministry.\"\n\n\"I think, Albert, you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke\nthis morning.\"\n\n\"Well, you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach; but I hear\nBeauchamp in the next room; you can dispute together, and that will pass\naway the time.\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"About the papers.\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said Lucien with an air of sovereign contempt, \"do I\never read the papers?\"\n\n\"Then you will dispute the more.\"\n\n\"M. Beauchamp,\" announced the servant. \"Come in, come in,\" said Albert,\nrising and advancing to meet the young man. \"Here is Debray, who detests\nyou without reading you, so he says.\"\n\n\"He is quite right,\" returned Beauchamp; \"for I criticise him without\nknowing what he does. Good-day, commander!\"\n\n\"Ah, you know that already,\" said the private secretary, smiling and\nshaking hands with him.\n\n\"Pardieu?\"\n\n\"And what do they say of it in the world?\"\n\n\"In which world? we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838.\"\n\n\"In the entire political world, of which you are one of the leaders.\"\n\n\"They say that it is quite fair, and that sowing so much red, you ought\nto reap a little blue.\"\n\n\"Come, come, that is not bad!\" said Lucien. \"Why do you not join our\nparty, my dear Beauchamp? With your talents you would make your fortune\nin three or four years.\"\n\n\"I only await one thing before following your advice; that is, a\nminister who will hold office for six months. My dear Albert, one word,\nfor I must give poor Lucien a respite. Do we breakfast or dine? I must\ngo to the Chamber, for our life is not an idle one.\"\n\n\"You only breakfast; I await two persons, and the instant they arrive we\nshall sit down to table.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 40. The Breakfast.\n\n\"And what sort of persons do you expect to breakfast?\" said Beauchamp.\n\n\"A gentleman, and a diplomatist.\"\n\n\"Then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman, and three\nfor the diplomatist. I shall come back to dessert; keep me some\nstrawberries, coffee, and cigars. I shall take a cutlet on my way to the\nChamber.\"\n\n\"Do not do anything of the sort; for were the gentleman a Montmorency,\nand the diplomatist a Metternich, we will breakfast at eleven; in the\nmeantime, follow Debray's example, and take a glass of sherry and a\nbiscuit.\"\n\n\"Be it so; I will stay; I must do something to distract my thoughts.\"\n\n\"You are like Debray, and yet it seems to me that when the minister is\nout of spirits, the opposition ought to be joyous.\"\n\n\"Ah, you do not know with what I am threatened. I shall hear this\nmorning that M. Danglars make a speech at the Chamber of Deputies, and\nat his wife's this evening I shall hear the tragedy of a peer of France.\nThe devil take the constitutional government, and since we had our\nchoice, as they say, at least, how could we choose that?\"\n\n\"I understand; you must lay in a stock of hilarity.\"\n\n\"Do not run down M. Danglars' speeches,\" said Debray; \"he votes for you,\nfor he belongs to the opposition.\"\n\n\"Pardieu, that is exactly the worst of all. I am waiting until you send\nhim to speak at the Luxembourg, to laugh at my ease.\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said Albert to Beauchamp, \"it is plain that the\naffairs of Spain are settled, for you are most desperately out of humor\nthis morning. Recollect that Parisian gossip has spoken of a marriage\nbetween myself and Mlle. Eugenie Danglars; I cannot in conscience,\ntherefore, let you run down the speeches of a man who will one day say\nto me, 'Vicomte, you know I give my daughter two millions.'\"\n\n\"Ah, this marriage will never take place,\" said Beauchamp. \"The king\nhas made him a baron, and can make him a peer, but he cannot make him a\ngentleman, and the Count of Morcerf is too aristocratic to consent, for\nthe paltry sum of two million francs, to a mesalliance. The Viscount of\nMorcerf can only wed a marchioness.\"\n\n\"But two million francs make a nice little sum,\" replied Morcerf.\n\n\"It is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard, or a railroad\nfrom the Jardin des Plantes to La Rapee.\"\n\n\"Never mind what he says, Morcerf,\" said Debray, \"do you marry her. You\nmarry a money-bag label, it is true; well, but what does that matter? It\nis better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it. You have seven\nmartlets on your arms; give three to your wife, and you will still have\nfour; that is one more than M. de Guise had, who so nearly became King\nof France, and whose cousin was Emperor of Germany.\"\n\n\"On my word, I think you are right, Lucien,\" said Albert absently.\n\n\"To be sure; besides, every millionaire is as noble as a bastard--that\nis, he can be.\"\n\n\"Do not say that, Debray,\" returned Beauchamp, laughing, \"for here is\nChateau-Renaud, who, to cure you of your mania for paradoxes, will pass\nthe sword of Renaud de Montauban, his ancestor, through your body.\"\n\n\"He will sully it then,\" returned Lucien; \"for I am low--very low.\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens,\" cried Beauchamp, \"the minister quotes Beranger, what\nshall we come to next?\"\n\n\"M. de Chateau-Renaud--M. Maximilian Morrel,\" said the servant,\nannouncing two fresh guests.\n\n\"Now, then, to breakfast,\" said Beauchamp; \"for, if I remember, you told\nme you only expected two persons, Albert.\"\n\n\"Morrel,\" muttered Albert--\"Morrel--who is he?\" But before he had\nfinished, M. de Chateau-Renaud, a handsome young man of thirty,\ngentleman all over,--that is, with the figure of a Guiche and the wit\nof a Mortemart,--took Albert's hand. \"My dear Albert,\" said he, \"let me\nintroduce to you M. Maximilian Morrel, captain of Spahis, my friend; and\nwhat is more--however the man speaks for himself--my preserver. Salute\nmy hero, viscount.\" And he stepped on one side to give place to a young\nman of refined and dignified bearing, with large and open brow,\npiercing eyes, and black mustache, whom our readers have already seen\nat Marseilles, under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be\nforgotten. A rich uniform, half French, half Oriental, set off his\ngraceful and stalwart figure, and his broad chest was decorated with\nthe order of the Legion of Honor. The young officer bowed with easy and\nelegant politeness. \"Monsieur,\" said Albert with affectionate courtesy,\n\"the count of Chateau-Renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction\nwould give me; you are his friend, be ours also.\"\n\n\"Well said,\" interrupted Chateau-Renaud; \"and pray that, if you should\never be in a similar predicament, he may do as much for you as he did\nfor me.\"\n\n\"What has he done?\" asked Albert.\n\n\"Oh, nothing worth speaking of,\" said Morrel; \"M. de Chateau-Renaud\nexaggerates.\"\n\n\"Not worth speaking of?\" cried Chateau-Renaud; \"life is not worth\nspeaking of!--that is rather too philosophical, on my word, Morrel. It\nis very well for you, who risk your life every day, but for me, who only\ndid so once\"--\n\n\"We gather from all this, baron, that Captain Morrel saved your life.\"\n\n\"Exactly so.\"\n\n\"On what occasion?\" asked Beauchamp.\n\n\"Beauchamp, my good fellow, you know I am starving,\" said Debray: \"do\nnot set him off on some long story.\"\n\n\"Well, I do not prevent your sitting down to table,\" replied Beauchamp,\n\"Chateau-Renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Morcerf, \"it is only a quarter past ten, and I expect\nsome one else.\"\n\n\"Ah, true, a diplomatist!\" observed Debray.\n\n\"Diplomat or not, I don't know; I only know that he charged himself\non my account with a mission, which he terminated so entirely to my\nsatisfaction, that had I been king, I should have instantly created him\nknight of all my orders, even had I been able to offer him the Golden\nFleece and the Garter.\"\n\n\"Well, since we are not to sit down to table,\" said Debray, \"take a\nglass of sherry, and tell us all about it.\"\n\n\"You all know that I had the fancy of going to Africa.\"\n\n\"It is a road your ancestors have traced for you,\" said Albert\ngallantly.\n\n\"Yes? but I doubt that your object was like theirs--to rescue the Holy\nSepulchre.\"\n\n\"You are quite right, Beauchamp,\" observed the young aristocrat. \"It was\nonly to fight as an amateur. I cannot bear duelling since two seconds,\nwhom I had chosen to arrange an affair, forced me to break the arm of\none of my best friends, one whom you all know--poor Franz d'Epinay.\"\n\n\"Ah, true,\" said Debray, \"you did fight some time ago; about what?\"\n\n\"The devil take me, if I remember,\" returned Chateau-Renaud. \"But I\nrecollect perfectly one thing, that, being unwilling to let such talents\nas mine sleep, I wished to try upon the Arabs the new pistols that had\nbeen given to me. In consequence I embarked for Oran, and went from\nthence to Constantine, where I arrived just in time to witness the\nraising of the siege. I retreated with the rest, for eight and forty\nhours. I endured the rain during the day, and the cold during the\nnight tolerably well, but the third morning my horse died of cold. Poor\nbrute--accustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable,\nthe Arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in Arabia.\"\n\n\"That's why you want to purchase my English horse,\" said Debray, \"you\nthink he will bear the cold better.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, for I have made a vow never to return to Africa.\"\n\n\"You were very much frightened, then?\" asked Beauchamp.\n\n\"Well, yes, and I had good reason to be so,\" replied Chateau-Renaud. \"I\nwas retreating on foot, for my horse was dead. Six Arabs came up, full\ngallop, to cut off my head. I shot two with my double-barrelled gun, and\ntwo more with my pistols, but I was then disarmed, and two were still\nleft; one seized me by the hair (that is why I now wear it so short, for\nno one knows what may happen), the other swung a yataghan, and I already\nfelt the cold steel on my neck, when this gentleman whom you see here\ncharged them, shot the one who held me by the hair, and cleft the skull\nof the other with his sabre. He had assigned himself the task of saving\na man's life that day; chance caused that man to be myself. When I am\nrich I will order a statue of Chance from Klagmann or Marochetti.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Morrel, smiling, \"it was the 5th of September, the\nanniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously preserved;\ntherefore, as far as it lies in my power, I endeavor to celebrate it by\nsome\"--\n\n\"Heroic action,\" interrupted Chateau-Renaud. \"I was chosen. But that is\nnot all--after rescuing me from the sword, he rescued me from the cold,\nnot by sharing his cloak with me, like St. Martin, but by giving me the\nwhole; then from hunger by sharing with me--guess what?\"\n\n\"A Strasbourg pie?\" asked Beauchamp.\n\n\"No, his horse; of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty\nappetite. It was very hard.\"\n\n\"The horse?\" said Morcerf, laughing.\n\n\"No, the sacrifice,\" returned Chateau-Renaud; \"ask Debray if he would\nsacrifice his English steed for a stranger?\"\n\n\"Not for a stranger,\" said Debray, \"but for a friend I might, perhaps.\"\n\n\"I divined that you would become mine, count,\" replied Morrel; \"besides,\nas I had the honor to tell you, heroism or not, sacrifice or not, that\nday I owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the favors good\nfortune had on other days granted to us.\"\n\n\"The history to which M. Morrel alludes,\" continued Chateau-Renaud, \"is\nan admirable one, which he will tell you some day when you are better\nacquainted with him; to-day let us fill our stomachs, and not our\nmemories. What time do you breakfast, Albert?\"\n\n\"At half-past ten.\"\n\n\"Precisely?\" asked Debray, taking out his watch.\n\n\"Oh, you will give me five minutes' grace,\" replied Morcerf, \"for I also\nexpect a preserver.\"\n\n\"Of whom?\"\n\n\"Of myself,\" cried Morcerf; \"parbleu, do you think I cannot be saved as\nwell as any one else, and that there are only Arabs who cut off heads?\nOur breakfast is a philanthropic one, and we shall have at table--at\nleast, I hope so--two benefactors of humanity.\"\n\n\"What shall we do?\" said Debray; \"we have only one Monthyon prize.\"\n\n\"Well, it will be given to some one who has done nothing to deserve it,\"\nsaid Beauchamp; \"that is the way the Academy mostly escapes from the\ndilemma.\"\n\n\"And where does he come from?\" asked Debray. \"You have already answered\nthe question once, but so vaguely that I venture to put it a second\ntime.\"\n\n\"Really,\" said Albert, \"I do not know; when I invited him three months\nago, he was then at Rome, but since that time who knows where he may\nhave gone?\"\n\n\"And you think him capable of being exact?\" demanded Debray.\n\n\"I think him capable of everything.\"\n\n\"Well, with the five minutes' grace, we have only ten left.\"\n\n\"I will profit by them to tell you something about my guest.\"\n\n\"I beg pardon,\" interrupted Beauchamp; \"are there any materials for an\narticle in what you are going to tell us?\"\n\n\"Yes, and for a most curious one.\"\n\n\"Go on, then, for I see I shall not get to the Chamber this morning, and\nI must make up for it.\"\n\n\"I was at Rome during the last Carnival.\"\n\n\"We know that,\" said Beauchamp.\n\n\"Yes, but what you do not know is that I was carried off by bandits.\"\n\n\"There are no bandits,\" cried Debray.\n\n\"Yes there are, and most hideous, or rather most admirable ones, for I\nfound them ugly enough to frighten me.\"\n\n\"Come, my dear Albert,\" said Debray, \"confess that your cook is\nbehindhand, that the oysters have not arrived from Ostend or Marennes,\nand that, like Madame de Maintenon, you are going to replace the dish\nby a story. Say so at once; we are sufficiently well-bred to excuse you,\nand to listen to your history, fabulous as it promises to be.\"\n\n\"And I say to you, fabulous as it may seem, I tell it as a true one from\nbeginning to end. The brigands had carried me off, and conducted me to a\ngloomy spot, called the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said Chateau-Renaud; \"I narrowly escaped catching a fever\nthere.\"\n\n\"And I did more than that,\" replied Morcerf, \"for I caught one. I\nwas informed that I was prisoner until I paid the sum of 4,000 Roman\ncrowns--about 24,000 francs. Unfortunately, I had not above 1,500. I was\nat the end of my journey and of my credit. I wrote to Franz--and were he\nhere he would confirm every word--I wrote then to Franz that if he did\nnot come with the four thousand crowns before six, at ten minutes past\nI should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in\nwhose company I had the honor of being; and Signor Luigi Vampa, such was\nthe name of the chief of these bandits, would have scrupulously kept his\nword.\"\n\n\"But Franz did come with the four thousand crowns,\" said Chateau-Renaud.\n\"A man whose name is Franz d'Epinay or Albert de Morcerf has not much\ndifficulty in procuring them.\"\n\n\"No, he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to present to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Ah, this gentleman is a Hercules killing Cacus, a Perseus freeing\nAndromeda.\"\n\n\"No, he is a man about my own size.\"\n\n\"Armed to the teeth?\"\n\n\"He had not even a knitting-needle.\"\n\n\"But he paid your ransom?\"\n\n\"He said two words to the chief and I was free.\"\n\n\"And they apologized to him for having carried you off?\" said Beauchamp.\n\n\"Just so.\"\n\n\"Why, he is a second Ariosto.\"\n\n\"No, his name is the Count of Monte Cristo.\"\n\n\"There is no Count of Monte Cristo\" said Debray.\n\n\"I do not think so,\" added Chateau-Renaud, with the air of a man who\nknows the whole of the European nobility perfectly.\n\n\"Does any one know anything of a Count of Monte Cristo?\"\n\n\"He comes possibly from the Holy Land, and one of his ancestors\npossessed Calvary, as the Mortemarts did the Dead Sea.\"\n\n\"I think I can assist your researches,\" said Maximilian. \"Monte Cristo\nis a little island I have often heard spoken of by the old sailors my\nfather employed--a grain of sand in the centre of the Mediterranean, an\natom in the infinite.\"\n\n\"Precisely!\" cried Albert. \"Well, he of whom I speak is the lord and\nmaster of this grain of sand, of this atom; he has purchased the title\nof count somewhere in Tuscany.\"\n\n\"He is rich, then?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\"\n\n\"But that ought to be visible.\"\n\n\"That is what deceives you, Debray.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you.\"\n\n\"Have you read the 'Arabian Nights'?\"\n\n\"What a question!\"\n\n\"Well, do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor, if\ntheir sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds? They seem like poor\nfishermen, and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the\nwealth of the Indies.\"\n\n\"Which means?\"\n\n\"Which means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those fishermen. He\nhas even a name taken from the book, since he calls himself Sinbad the\nSailor, and has a cave filled with gold.\"\n\n\"And you have seen this cavern, Morcerf?\" asked Beauchamp.\n\n\"No, but Franz has; for heaven's sake, not a word of this before him.\nFranz went in with his eyes blindfolded, and was waited on by mutes and\nby women to whom Cleopatra was a painted strumpet. Only he is not quite\nsure about the women, for they did not come in until after he had taken\nhashish, so that what he took for women might have been simply a row of\nstatues.\"\n\nThe two young men looked at Morcerf as if to say,--\"Are you mad, or are\nyou laughing at us?\"\n\n\"And I also,\" said Morrel thoughtfully, \"have heard something like this\nfrom an old sailor named Penelon.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" cried Albert, \"it is very lucky that M. Morrel comes to aid me;\nyou are vexed, are you not, that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth?\"\n\n\"My dear Albert,\" said Debray, \"what you tell us is so extraordinary.\"\n\n\"Ah, because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of\nthem--they have no time. They are too much taken up with interfering in\nthe affairs of their countrymen who travel.\"\n\n\"Now you get angry, and attack our poor agents. How will you have them\nprotect you? The Chamber cuts down their salaries every day, so that now\nthey have scarcely any. Will you be ambassador, Albert? I will send you\nto Constantinople.\"\n\n\"No, lest on the first demonstration I make in favor of Mehemet Ali, the\nSultan send me the bowstring, and make my secretaries strangle me.\"\n\n\"You say very true,\" responded Debray.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Albert, \"but this has nothing to do with the existence of\nthe Count of Monte Cristo.\"\n\n\"Pardieu, every one exists.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, but not in the same way; every one has not black slaves,\na princely retinue, an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an\nArabian fortress, horses that cost six thousand francs apiece, and Greek\nmistresses.\"\n\n\"Have you seen the Greek mistress?\"\n\n\"I have both seen and heard her. I saw her at the theatre, and heard her\none morning when I breakfasted with the count.\"\n\n\"He eats, then?\"\n\n\"Yes; but so little, it can hardly be called eating.\"\n\n\"He must be a vampire.\"\n\n\"Laugh, if you will; the Countess G----, who knew Lord Ruthven, declared\nthat the count was a vampire.\"\n\n\"Ah, capital,\" said Beauchamp. \"For a man not connected with newspapers,\nhere is the pendant to the famous sea-serpent of the Constitutionnel.\"\n\n\"Wild eyes, the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure,\" said\nDebray; \"facial angle strongly developed, magnificent forehead,\nlivid complexion, black beard, sharp and white teeth, politeness\nunexceptionable.\"\n\n\"Just so, Lucien,\" returned Morcerf; \"you have described him feature for\nfeature. Yes, keen and cutting politeness. This man has often made me\nshudder; and one day when we were viewing an execution, I thought I\nshould faint, more from hearing the cold and calm manner in which\nhe spoke of every description of torture, than from the sight of the\nexecutioner and the culprit.\"\n\n\"Did he not conduct you to the ruins of the Colosseum and suck your\nblood?\" asked Beauchamp.\n\n\"Or, having delivered you, make you sign a flaming parchment,\nsurrendering your soul to him as Esau did his birth-right?\"\n\n\"Rail on, rail on at your ease, gentlemen,\" said Morcerf, somewhat\npiqued. \"When I look at you Parisians, idlers on the Boulevard de Gand\nor the Bois de Boulogne, and think of this man, it seems to me we are\nnot of the same race.\"\n\n\"I am highly flattered,\" returned Beauchamp. \"At the same time,\" added\nChateau-Renaud, \"your Count of Monte Cristo is a very fine fellow,\nalways excepting his little arrangements with the Italian banditti.\"\n\n\"There are no Italian banditti,\" said Debray.\n\n\"No vampire,\" cried Beauchamp. \"No Count of Monte Cristo\" added Debray.\n\"There is half-past ten striking, Albert.\"\n\n\"Confess you have dreamed this, and let us sit down to breakfast,\"\ncontinued Beauchamp. But the sound of the clock had not died away when\nGermain announced, \"His excellency the Count of Monte Cristo.\" The\ninvoluntary start every one gave proved how much Morcerf's narrative\nhad impressed them, and Albert himself could not wholly refrain from\nmanifesting sudden emotion. He had not heard a carriage stop in the\nstreet, or steps in the ante-chamber; the door had itself opened\nnoiselessly. The count appeared, dressed with the greatest simplicity,\nbut the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in\nhis toilet. Every article of dress--hat, coat, gloves, and boots--was\nfrom the first makers. He seemed scarcely five and thirty. But what\nstruck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait Debray had\ndrawn. The count advanced, smiling, into the centre of the room, and\napproached Albert, who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a\nceremonial manner. \"Punctuality,\" said Monte Cristo, \"is the politeness\nof kings, according to one of your sovereigns, I think; but it is not\nthe same with travellers. However, I hope you will excuse the two\nor three seconds I am behindhand; five hundred leagues are not to be\naccomplished without some trouble, and especially in France, where, it\nseems, it is forbidden to beat the postilions.\"\n\n\"My dear count,\" replied Albert, \"I was announcing your visit to some of\nmy friends, whom I had invited in consequence of the promise you did me\nthe honor to make, and whom I now present to you. They are the Count of\nChateau-Renaud, whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers, and whose\nancestors had a place at the Round Table; M. Lucien Debray, private\nsecretary to the minister of the interior; M. Beauchamp, an editor of a\npaper, and the terror of the French government, but of whom, in spite of\nhis national celebrity, you perhaps have not heard in Italy, since his\npaper is prohibited there; and M. Maximilian Morrel, captain of Spahis.\"\n\nAt this name the count, who had hitherto saluted every one with\ncourtesy, but at the same time with coldness and formality, stepped a\npace forward, and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks. \"You\nwear the uniform of the new French conquerors, monsieur,\" said he; \"it\nis a handsome uniform.\" No one could have said what caused the count's\nvoice to vibrate so deeply, and what made his eye flash, which was in\ngeneral so clear, lustrous, and limpid when he pleased. \"You have never\nseen our Africans, count?\" said Albert. \"Never,\" replied the count, who\nwas by this time perfectly master of himself again.\n\n\"Well, beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest hearts\nin the whole army.\"\n\n\"Oh, M. de Morcerf,\" interrupted Morrel.\n\n\"Let me go on, captain. And we have just heard,\" continued Albert, \"of\na new deed of his, and so heroic a one, that, although I have seen him\nto-day for the first time, I request you to allow me to introduce him\nas my friend.\" At these words it was still possible to observe in Monte\nCristo the concentrated look, changing color, and slight trembling of\nthe eyelid that show emotion. \"Ah, you have a noble heart,\" said the\ncount; \"so much the better.\" This exclamation, which corresponded to\nthe count's own thought rather than to what Albert was saying, surprised\neverybody, and especially Morrel, who looked at Monte Cristo with\nwonder. But, at the same time, the intonation was so soft that, however\nstrange the speech might seem, it was impossible to be offended at it.\n\"Why should he doubt it?\" said Beauchamp to Chateau-Renaud.\n\n\"In reality,\" replied the latter, who, with his aristocratic glance\nand his knowledge of the world, had penetrated at once all that was\npenetrable in Monte Cristo, \"Albert has not deceived us, for the count\nis a most singular being. What say you, Morrel!\"\n\n\"Ma foi, he has an open look about him that pleases me, in spite of the\nsingular remark he has made about me.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Albert, \"Germain informs me that breakfast is ready.\nMy dear count, allow me to show you the way.\" They passed silently into\nthe breakfast-room, and every one took his place. \"Gentlemen,\" said the\ncount, seating himself, \"permit me to make a confession which must form\nmy excuse for any improprieties I may commit. I am a stranger, and a\nstranger to such a degree, that this is the first time I have ever been\nat Paris. The French way of living is utterly unknown to me, and up to\nthe present time I have followed the Eastern customs, which are entirely\nin contrast to the Parisian. I beg you, therefore, to excuse if you find\nanything in me too Turkish, too Italian, or too Arabian. Now, then, let\nus breakfast.\"\n\n\"With what an air he says all this,\" muttered Beauchamp; \"decidedly he\nis a great man.\"\n\n\"A great man in his own country,\" added Debray.\n\n\"A great man in every country, M. Debray,\" said Chateau-Renaud. The\ncount was, it may be remembered, a most temperate guest. Albert remarked\nthis, expressing his fears lest, at the outset, the Parisian mode of\nlife should displease the traveller in the most essential point. \"My\ndear count,\" said he, \"I fear one thing, and that is, that the fare of\nthe Rue du Helder is not so much to your taste as that of the Piazza di\nSpagni. I ought to have consulted you on the point, and have had some\ndishes prepared expressly.\"\n\n\"Did you know me better,\" returned the count, smiling, \"you would not\ngive one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself, who\nhas successively lived on maccaroni at Naples, polenta at Milan, olla\npodrida at Valencia, pilau at Constantinople, karrick in India, and\nswallows' nests in China. I eat everywhere, and of everything, only\nI eat but little; and to-day, that you reproach me with my want of\nappetite, is my day of appetite, for I have not eaten since yesterday\nmorning.\"\n\n\"What,\" cried all the guests, \"you have not eaten for four and twenty\nhours?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the count; \"I was forced to go out of my road to obtain\nsome information near Nimes, so that I was somewhat late, and therefore\nI did not choose to stop.\"\n\n\"And you ate in your carriage?\" asked Morcerf.\n\n\"No, I slept, as I generally do when I am weary without having the\ncourage to amuse myself, or when I am hungry without feeling inclined to\neat.\"\n\n\"But you can sleep when you please, monsieur?\" said Morrel.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You have a recipe for it?\"\n\n\"An infallible one.\"\n\n\"That would be invaluable to us in Africa, who have not always any food\nto eat, and rarely anything to drink.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Monte Cristo; \"but, unfortunately, a recipe excellent for a\nman like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army, which might\nnot awake when it was needed.\"\n\n\"May we inquire what is this recipe?\" asked Debray.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" returned Monte Cristo; \"I make no secret of it. It is a\nmixture of excellent opium, which I fetched myself from Canton in order\nto have it pure, and the best hashish which grows in the East--that is,\nbetween the Tigris and the Euphrates. These two ingredients are mixed\nin equal proportions, and formed into pills. Ten minutes after one is\ntaken, the effect is produced. Ask Baron Franz d'Epinay; I think he\ntasted them one day.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Morcerf, \"he said something about it to me.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Beauchamp, who, as became a journalist, was very\nincredulous, \"you always carry this drug about you?\"\n\n\"Always.\"\n\n\"Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?\"\ncontinued Beauchamp, hoping to take him at a disadvantage.\n\n\"No, monsieur,\" returned the count; and he drew from his pocket a\nmarvellous casket, formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden\nlid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet\nabout the size of a pea. This ball had an acrid and penetrating odor.\nThere were four or five more in the emerald, which would contain about\na dozen. The casket passed around the table, but it was more to examine\nthe admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from hand to\nhand. \"And is it your cook who prepares these pills?\" asked Beauchamp.\n\n\"Oh, no, monsieur,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"I do not thus betray my\nenjoyments to the vulgar. I am a tolerable chemist, and prepare my pills\nmyself.\"\n\n\"This is a magnificent emerald, and the largest I have ever seen,\" said\nChateau-Renaud, \"although my mother has some remarkable family jewels.\"\n\n\"I had three similar ones,\" returned Monte Cristo. \"I gave one to the\nSultan, who mounted it in his sabre; another to our holy father the\nPope, who had it set in his tiara, opposite to one nearly as large,\nthough not so fine, given by the Emperor Napoleon to his predecessor,\nPius VII. I kept the third for myself, and I had it hollowed out, which\nreduced its value, but rendered it more commodious for the purpose I\nintended.\" Every one looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment; he spoke\nwith so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the truth, or\nthat he was mad. However, the sight of the emerald made them naturally\nincline to the former belief. \"And what did these two sovereigns give\nyou in exchange for these magnificent presents?\" asked Debray.\n\n\"The Sultan, the liberty of a woman,\" replied the Count; \"the Pope, the\nlife of a man; so that once in my life I have been as powerful as if\nheaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a throne.\"\n\n\"And it was Peppino you saved, was it not?\" cried Morcerf; \"it was for\nhim that you obtained pardon?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" returned the count, smiling.\n\n\"My dear count, you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear you\nspeak thus,\" said Morcerf. \"I had announced you beforehand to my friends\nas an enchanter of the 'Arabian Nights,' a wizard of the Middle Ages;\nbut the Parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for\ncaprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths, when these\ntruths do not form a part of their daily existence. For example, here is\nDebray who reads, and Beauchamp who prints, every day, 'A member of the\nJockey Club has been stopped and robbed on the Boulevard;' 'four persons\nhave been assassinated in the Rue St. Denis' or 'the Faubourg St.\nGermain;' 'ten, fifteen, or twenty thieves, have been arrested in a cafe\non the Boulevard du Temple, or in the Thermes de Julien,'--and yet these\nsame men deny the existence of the bandits in the Maremma, the Campagna\ndi Romana, or the Pontine Marshes. Tell them yourself that I was taken\nby bandits, and that without your generous intercession I should\nnow have been sleeping in the Catacombs of St. Sebastian, instead of\nreceiving them in my humble abode in the Rue du Helder.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Monte Cristo \"you promised me never to mention that\ncircumstance.\"\n\n\"It was not I who made that promise,\" cried Morcerf; \"it must have been\nsome one else whom you have rescued in the same manner, and whom you\nhave forgotten. Pray speak of it, for I shall not only, I trust, relate\nthe little I do know, but also a great deal I do not know.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" returned the count, smiling, \"that you played a\nsufficiently important part to know as well as myself what happened.\"\n\n\"Well, you promise me, if I tell all I know, to relate, in your turn,\nall that I do not know?\"\n\n\"That is but fair,\" replied Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Well,\" said Morcerf, \"for three days I believed myself the object of\nthe attentions of a masque, whom I took for a descendant of Tullia or\nPoppoea, while I was simply the object of the attentions of a contadina,\nand I say contadina to avoid saying peasant girl. What I know is, that,\nlike a fool, a greater fool than he of whom I spoke just now, I mistook\nfor this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen, with a\nbeardless chin and slim waist, and who, just as I was about to imprint\na chaste salute on his lips, placed a pistol to my head, and, aided by\nseven or eight others, led, or rather dragged me, to the Catacombs of\nSt. Sebastian, where I found a highly educated brigand chief perusing\nCaesar's 'Commentaries,' and who deigned to leave off reading to inform\nme, that unless the next morning, before six o'clock, four thousand\npiastres were paid into his account at his banker's, at a quarter past\nsix I should have ceased to exist. The letter is still to be seen,\nfor it is in Franz d'Epinay's possession, signed by me, and with a\npostscript of M. Luigi Vampa. This is all I know, but I know not, count,\nhow you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of Rome who\nordinarily have so little respect for anything. I assure you, Franz and\nI were lost in admiration.\"\n\n\"Nothing more simple,\" returned the count. \"I had known the famous Vampa\nfor more than ten years. When he was quite a child, and only a shepherd,\nI gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way, and he, in order to\nrepay me, gave me a poniard, the hilt of which he had carved with his\nown hand, and which you may have seen in my collection of arms. In after\nyears, whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents, which\nought to have cemented our friendship, or whether he did not recollect\nme, he sought to take me, but, on the contrary, it was I who captured\nhim and a dozen of his band. I might have handed him over to Roman\njustice, which is somewhat expeditious, and which would have been\nparticularly so with him; but I did nothing of the sort--I suffered him\nand his band to depart.\"\n\n\"With the condition that they should sin no more,\" said Beauchamp,\nlaughing. \"I see they kept their promise.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur,\" returned Monte Cristo \"upon the simple condition that\nthey should respect myself and my friends. Perhaps what I am about to\nsay may seem strange to you, who are socialists, and vaunt humanity and\nyour duty to your neighbor, but I never seek to protect a society which\ndoes not protect me, and which I will even say, generally occupies\nitself about me only to injure me; and thus by giving them a low place\nin my esteem, and preserving a neutrality towards them, it is society\nand my neighbor who are indebted to me.\"\n\n\"Bravo,\" cried Chateau-Renaud; \"you are the first man I ever met\nsufficiently courageous to preach egotism. Bravo, count, bravo!\"\n\n\"It is frank, at least,\" said Morrel. \"But I am sure that the count does\nnot regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly\navowed.\"\n\n\"How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?\" asked Monte\nCristo, who could not help looking at Morrel with so much intensity,\nthat two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that\nclear and piercing glance.\n\n\"Why, it seems to me,\" replied Morrel, \"that in delivering M. de\nMorcerf, whom you did not know, you did good to your neighbor and to\nsociety.\"\n\n\"Of which he is the brightest ornament,\" said Beauchamp, drinking off a\nglass of champagne.\n\n\"My dear count,\" cried Morcerf, \"you are at fault--you, one of the most\nformidable logicians I know--and you must see it clearly proved that\ninstead of being an egotist, you are a philanthropist. Ah, you call\nyourself Oriental, a Levantine, Maltese, Indian, Chinese; your family\nname is Monte Cristo; Sinbad the Sailor is your baptismal appellation,\nand yet the first day you set foot in Paris you instinctively display\nthe greatest virtue, or rather the chief defect, of us eccentric\nParisians,--that is, you assume the vices you have not, and conceal the\nvirtues you possess.\"\n\n\"My dear vicomte,\" returned Monte Cristo, \"I do not see, in all I have\ndone, anything that merits, either from you or these gentlemen, the\npretended eulogies I have received. You were no stranger to me, for\nI knew you from the time I gave up two rooms to you, invited you to\nbreakfast with me, lent you one of my carriages, witnessed the Carnival\nin your company, and saw with you from a window in the Piazza del Popolo\nthe execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted. I will\nappeal to any of these gentlemen, could I leave my guest in the hands\nof a hideous bandit, as you term him? Besides, you know, I had the idea\nthat you could introduce me into some of the Paris salons when I came\nto France. You might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a\nvague project, but to-day you see it was a reality, and you must submit\nto it under penalty of breaking your word.\"\n\n\"I will keep it,\" returned Morcerf; \"but I fear that you will be much\ndisappointed, accustomed as you are to picturesque events and fantastic\nhorizons. Amongst us you will not meet with any of those episodes with\nwhich your adventurous existence has so familiarized you; our Chimborazo\nis Mortmartre, our Himalaya is Mount Valerien, our Great Desert is the\nplain of Grenelle, where they are now boring an artesian well to water\nthe caravans. We have plenty of thieves, though not so many as is said;\nbut these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord.\nFrance is so prosaic, and Paris so civilized a city, that you will not\nfind in its eighty-five departments--I say eighty-five, because I do\nnot include Corsica--you will not find, then, in these eighty-five\ndepartments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph, or a grotto\nin which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp. There is but\none service I can render you, and for that I place myself entirely\nat your orders, that is, to present, or make my friends present, you\neverywhere; besides, you have no need of any one to introduce you--with\nyour name, and your fortune, and your talent\" (Monte Cristo bowed with\na somewhat ironical smile) \"you can present yourself everywhere, and be\nwell received. I can be useful in one way only--if knowledge of Parisian\nhabits, of the means of rendering yourself comfortable, or of the\nbazaars, can assist, you may depend upon me to find you a fitting\ndwelling here. I do not dare offer to share my apartments with you, as I\nshared yours at Rome--I, who do not profess egotism, but am yet egotist\npar excellence; for, except myself, these rooms would not hold a shadow\nmore, unless that shadow were feminine.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the count, \"that is a most conjugal reservation; I recollect\nthat at Rome you said something of a projected marriage. May I\ncongratulate you?\"\n\n\"The affair is still in projection.\"\n\n\"And he who says in 'projection,' means already decided,\" said Debray.\n\n\"No,\" replied Morcerf, \"my father is most anxious about it; and I\nhope, ere long, to introduce you, if not to my wife, at least to my\nbetrothed--Mademoiselle Eugenie Danglars.\"\n\n\"Eugenie Danglars,\" said Monte Cristo; \"tell me, is not her father Baron\nDanglars?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Morcerf, \"a baron of a new creation.\"\n\n\"What matter,\" said Monte Cristo \"if he has rendered the State services\nwhich merit this distinction?\"\n\n\"Enormous ones,\" answered Beauchamp. \"Although in reality a Liberal, he\nnegotiated a loan of six millions for Charles X., in 1829, who made\nhim a baron and chevalier of the Legion of Honor; so that he wears the\nribbon, not, as you would think, in his waistcoat-pocket, but at his\nbutton-hole.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" interrupted Morcerf, laughing, \"Beauchamp, Beauchamp, keep that\nfor the Corsaire or the Charivari, but spare my future father-in-law\nbefore me.\" Then, turning to Monte Cristo, \"You just now spoke his name\nas if you knew the baron?\"\n\n\"I do not know him,\" returned Monte Cristo; \"but I shall probably soon\nmake his acquaintance, for I have a credit opened with him by the house\nof Richard & Blount, of London, Arstein & Eskeles of Vienna, and Thomson\n& French at Rome.\" As he pronounced the two last names, the count\nglanced at Maximilian Morrel. If the stranger expected to produce an\neffect on Morrel, he was not mistaken--Maximilian started as if he had\nbeen electrified. \"Thomson & French,\" said he; \"do you know this house,\nmonsieur?\"\n\n\"They are my bankers in the capital of the Christian world,\" returned\nthe count quietly. \"Can my influence with them be of any service to\nyou?\"\n\n\"Oh, count, you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been,\nup to the present, fruitless. This house, in past years, did ours a\ngreat service, and has, I know not for what reason, always denied having\nrendered us this service.\"\n\n\"I shall be at your orders,\" said Monte Cristo bowing.\n\n\"But,\" continued Morcerf, \"a propos of Danglars,--we have strangely\nwandered from the subject. We were speaking of a suitable habitation\nfor the Count of Monte Cristo. Come, gentlemen, let us all propose some\nplace. Where shall we lodge this new guest in our great capital?\"\n\n\"Faubourg Saint-Germain,\" said Chateau-Renaud. \"The count will find\nthere a charming hotel, with a court and garden.\"\n\n\"Bah, Chateau-Renaud,\" returned Debray, \"you only know your dull\nand gloomy Faubourg Saint-Germain; do not pay any attention to him,\ncount--live in the Chaussee d'Antin, that's the real centre of Paris.\"\n\n\"Boulevard de l'Opera,\" said Beauchamp; \"the second floor--a house with\na balcony. The count will have his cushions of silver cloth brought\nthere, and as he smokes his chibouque, see all Paris pass before him.\"\n\n\"You have no idea, then, Morrel?\" asked Chateau-Renaud; \"you do not\npropose anything.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" returned the young man, smiling; \"on the contrary, I have\none, but I expected the count would be tempted by one of the brilliant\nproposals made him, yet as he has not replied to any of them, I will\nventure to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming hotel, in the\nPompadour style, that my sister has inhabited for a year, in the Rue\nMeslay.\"\n\n\"You have a sister?\" asked the count.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, a most excellent sister.\"\n\n\"Married?\"\n\n\"Nearly nine years.\"\n\n\"Happy?\" asked the count again.\n\n\"As happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be,\" replied\nMaximilian. \"She married the man she loved, who remained faithful to\nus in our fallen fortunes--Emmanuel Herbaut.\" Monte Cristo smiled\nimperceptibly. \"I live there during my leave of absence,\" continued\nMaximilian; \"and I shall be, together with my brother-in-law Emmanuel,\nat the disposition of the Count, whenever he thinks fit to honor us.\"\n\n\"One minute,\" cried Albert, without giving Monte Cristo the time to\nreply. \"Take care, you are going to immure a traveller, Sinbad the\nSailor, a man who comes to see Paris; you are going to make a patriarch\nof him.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Morrel; \"my sister is five and twenty, my brother-in-law\nis thirty, they are gay, young, and happy. Besides, the count will be in\nhis own house, and only see them when he thinks fit to do so.\"\n\n\"Thanks, monsieur,\" said Monte Cristo; \"I shall content myself with\nbeing presented to your sister and her husband, if you will do me the\nhonor to introduce me; but I cannot accept the offer of any one of these\ngentlemen, since my habitation is already prepared.\"\n\n\"What,\" cried Morcerf; \"you are, then, going to an hotel--that will be\nvery dull for you.\"\n\n\"Was I so badly lodged at Rome?\" said Monte Cristo smiling.\n\n\"Parbleu, at Rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your\napartments, but I presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar\nsum every day.\"\n\n\"It is not that which deterred me,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"but as I\ndetermined to have a house to myself, I sent on my valet de chambre, and\nhe ought by this time to have bought the house and furnished it.\"\n\n\"But you have, then, a valet de chambre who knows Paris?\" said\nBeauchamp.\n\n\"It is the first time he has ever been in Paris. He is black, and cannot\nspeak,\" returned Monte Cristo.\n\n\"It is Ali!\" cried Albert, in the midst of the general surprise.\n\n\"Yes, Ali himself, my Nubian mute, whom you saw, I think, at Rome.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Morcerf; \"I recollect him perfectly. But how could you\ncharge a Nubian to purchase a house, and a mute to furnish it?--he will\ndo everything wrong.\"\n\n\"Undeceive yourself, monsieur,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"I am quite sure,\nthat, on the contrary, he will choose everything as I wish. He knows\nmy tastes, my caprices, my wants. He has been here a week, with the\ninstinct of a hound, hunting by himself. He will arrange everything for\nme. He knew, that I should arrive to-day at ten o'clock; he was waiting\nfor me at nine at the Barriere de Fontainebleau. He gave me this paper;\nit contains the number of my new abode; read it yourself,\" and Monte\nCristo passed a paper to Albert. \"Ah, that is really original,\" said\nBeauchamp.\n\n\"And very princely,\" added Chateau-Renaud.\n\n\"What, do you not know your house?\" asked Debray.\n\n\"No,\" said Monte Cristo; \"I told you I did not wish to be behind my\ntime; I dressed myself in the carriage, and descended at the viscount's\ndoor.\" The young men looked at each other; they did not know if it was\na comedy Monte Cristo was playing, but every word he uttered had such\nan air of simplicity, that it was impossible to suppose what he said\nwas false--besides, why should he tell a falsehood? \"We must content\nourselves, then,\" said Beauchamp, \"with rendering the count all the\nlittle services in our power. I, in my quality of journalist, open all\nthe theatres to him.\"\n\n\"Thanks, monsieur,\" returned Monte Cristo, \"my steward has orders to\ntake a box at each theatre.\"\n\n\"Is your steward also a Nubian?\" asked Debray.\n\n\"No, he is a countryman of yours, if a Corsican is a countryman of any\none's. But you know him, M. de Morcerf.\"\n\n\"Is it that excellent M. Bertuccio, who understands hiring windows so\nwell?\"\n\n\"Yes, you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you; he has been\na soldier, a smuggler--in fact, everything. I would not be quite sure\nthat he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle--a stab\nwith a knife, for instance.\"\n\n\"And you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward,\" said Debray.\n\"Of how much does he rob you every year?\"\n\n\"On my word,\" replied the count, \"not more than another. I am sure he\nanswers my purpose, knows no impossibility, and so I keep him.\"\n\n\"Then,\" continued Chateau-Renaud, \"since you have an establishment, a\nsteward, and a hotel in the Champs Elysees, you only want a mistress.\"\nAlbert smiled. He thought of the fair Greek he had seen in the count's\nbox at the Argentina and Valle theatres. \"I have something better than\nthat,\" said Monte Cristo; \"I have a slave. You procure your mistresses\nfrom the opera, the Vaudeville, or the Varietes; I purchased mine at\nConstantinople; it cost me more, but I have nothing to fear.\"\n\n\"But you forget,\" replied Debray, laughing, \"that we are Franks by name\nand franks by nature, as King Charles said, and that the moment she puts\nher foot in France your slave becomes free.\"\n\n\"Who will tell her?\"\n\n\"The first person who sees her.\"\n\n\"She only speaks Romaic.\"\n\n\"That is different.\"\n\n\"But at least we shall see her,\" said Beauchamp, \"or do you keep eunuchs\nas well as mutes?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"I do not carry brutalism so far. Every\none who surrounds me is free to quit me, and when they leave me will\nno longer have any need of me or any one else; it is for that reason,\nperhaps, that they do not quit me.\" They had long since passed to\ndessert and cigars.\n\n\"My dear Albert,\" said Debray, rising, \"it is half-past two. Your\nguest is charming, but you leave the best company to go into the worst\nsometimes. I must return to the minister's. I will tell him of the\ncount, and we shall soon know who he is.\"\n\n\"Take care,\" returned Albert; \"no one has been able to accomplish that.\"\n\n\"Oh, we have three millions for our police; it is true they are almost\nalways spent beforehand, but, no matter, we shall still have fifty\nthousand francs to spend for this purpose.\"\n\n\"And when you know, will you tell me?\"\n\n\"I promise you. Au revoir, Albert. Gentlemen, good morning.\"\n\nAs he left the room, Debray called out loudly, \"My carriage.\"\n\n\"Bravo,\" said Beauchamp to Albert; \"I shall not go to the Chamber, but I\nhave something better to offer my readers than a speech of M. Danglars.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, Beauchamp,\" returned Morcerf, \"do not deprive me of\nthe merit of introducing him everywhere. Is he not peculiar?\"\n\n\"He is more than that,\" replied Chateau-Renaud; \"he is one of the most\nextraordinary men I ever saw in my life. Are you coming, Morrel?\"\n\n\"Directly I have given my card to the count, who has promised to pay us\na visit at Rue Meslay, No. 14.\"\n\n\"Be sure I shall not fail to do so,\" returned the count, bowing. And\nMaximilian Morrel left the room with the Baron de Chateau-Renaud,\nleaving Monte Cristo alone with Morcerf.\n\n\n\nChapter 41. The Presentation.\n\nWhen Albert found himself alone with Monte Cristo, \"My dear count,\"\nsaid he, \"allow me to commence my services as cicerone by showing you\na specimen of a bachelor's apartment. You, who are accustomed to the\npalaces of Italy, can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square\nfeet a young man who is not the worst lodged in Paris can live. As\nwe pass from one room to another, I will open the windows to let you\nbreathe.\" Monte Cristo had already seen the breakfast-room and the salon\non the ground-floor. Albert led him first to his atelier, which was, as\nwe have said, his favorite apartment. Monte Cristo quickly appreciated\nall that Albert had collected here--old cabinets, Japanese porcelain,\nOriental stuffs, Venetian glass, arms from all parts of the\nworld--everything was familiar to him; and at the first glance he\nrecognized their date, their country, and their origin. Morcerf had\nexpected he should be the guide; on the contrary, it was he who, under\nthe count's guidance, followed a course of archaeology, mineralogy, and\nnatural history. They descended to the first floor; Albert led his guest\ninto the salon. The salon was filled with the works of modern artists;\nthere were landscapes by Dupre, with their long reeds and tall trees,\ntheir lowing oxen and marvellous skies; Delacroix's Arabian cavaliers,\nwith their long white burnouses, their shining belts, their damasked\narms, their horses, who tore each other with their teeth while their\nriders contended fiercely with their maces; aquarelles of Boulanger,\nrepresenting Notre Dame de Paris with that vigor that makes the artist\nthe rival of the poet; there were paintings by Diaz, who makes his\nflowers more beautiful than flowers, his suns more brilliant than the\nsun; designs by Decamp, as vividly colored as those of Salvator Rosa,\nbut more poetic; pastels by Giraud and Muller, representing children\nlike angels and women with the features of a virgin; sketches torn from\nthe album of Dauzats' \"Travels in the East,\" that had been made in a few\nseconds on the saddle of a camel, or beneath the dome of a mosque--in a\nword, all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the\nart lost and gone with ages long since past.\n\nAlbert expected to have something new this time to show to the\ntraveller, but, to his great surprise, the latter, without seeking\nfor the signatures, many of which, indeed, were only initials, named\ninstantly the author of every picture in such a manner that it was easy\nto see that each name was not only known to him, but that each style\nassociated with it had been appreciated and studied by him. From the\nsalon they passed into the bed-chamber; it was a model of taste and\nsimple elegance. A single portrait, signed by Leopold Robert, shone in\nits carved and gilded frame. This portrait attracted the Count of Monte\nCristo's attention, for he made three rapid steps in the chamber, and\nstopped suddenly before it. It was the portrait of a young woman of five\nor six and twenty, with a dark complexion, and light and lustrous eyes,\nveiled beneath long lashes. She wore the picturesque costume of the\nCatalan fisherwomen, a red and black bodice, and golden pins in her\nhair. She was looking at the sea, and her form was outlined on the blue\nocean and sky. The light was so faint in the room that Albert did not\nperceive the pallor that spread itself over the count's visage, or the\nnervous heaving of his chest and shoulders. Silence prevailed for an\ninstant, during which Monte Cristo gazed intently on the picture.\n\n\"You have there a most charming mistress, viscount,\" said the count in\na perfectly calm tone; \"and this costume--a ball costume,\ndoubtless--becomes her admirably.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur,\" returned Albert, \"I would never forgive you this mistake\nif you had seen another picture beside this. You do not know my mother;\nshe it is whom you see here. She had her portrait painted thus six\nor eight years ago. This costume is a fancy one, it appears, and the\nresemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same\nas she was in 1830. The countess had this portrait painted during\nthe count's absence. She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable\nsurprise; but, strange to say, this portrait seemed to displease my\nfather, and the value of the picture, which is, as you see, one of the\nbest works of Leopold Robert, could not overcome his dislike to it.\nIt is true, between ourselves, that M. de Morcerf is one of the most\nassiduous peers at the Luxembourg, a general renowned for theory, but a\nmost mediocre amateur of art. It is different with my mother, who paints\nexceedingly well, and who, unwilling to part with so valuable a picture,\ngave it to me to put here, where it would be less likely to displease\nM. de Morcerf, whose portrait, by Gros, I will also show you. Excuse my\ntalking of family matters, but as I shall have the honor of introducing\nyou to the count, I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions\nto this picture. The picture seems to have a malign influence, for my\nmother rarely comes here without looking at it, and still more rarely\ndoes she look at it without weeping. This disagreement is the only one\nthat has ever taken place between the count and countess, who are still\nas much united, although married more than twenty years, as on the first\nday of their wedding.\"\n\nMonte Cristo glanced rapidly at Albert, as if to seek a hidden meaning\nin his words, but it was evident the young man uttered them in the\nsimplicity of his heart. \"Now,\" said Albert, \"that you have seen all my\ntreasures, allow me to offer them to you, unworthy as they are. Consider\nyourself as in your own house, and to put yourself still more at your\nease, pray accompany me to the apartments of M. de Morcerf, he whom I\nwrote from Rome an account of the services you rendered me, and to whom\nI announced your promised visit, and I may say that both the count and\ncountess anxiously desire to thank you in person. You are somewhat blase\nI know, and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor,\nwho has seen so many others. However, accept what I propose to you as\nan initiation into Parisian life--a life of politeness, visiting,\nand introductions.\" Monte Cristo bowed without making any answer; he\naccepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret, as one of\nthose conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty.\nAlbert summoned his servant, and ordered him to acquaint M. and Madame\nde Morcerf of the arrival of the Count of Monte Cristo. Albert followed\nhim with the count. When they arrived at the ante-chamber, above the\ndoor was visible a shield, which, by its rich ornaments and its harmony\nwith the rest of the furniture, indicated the importance the owner\nattached to this blazon. Monte Cristo stopped and examined it\nattentively.\n\n\"Azure seven merlets, or, placed bender,\" said he. \"These are,\ndoubtless, your family arms? Except the knowledge of blazons, that\nenables me to decipher them, I am very ignorant of heraldry--I, a count\nof a fresh creation, fabricated in Tuscany by the aid of a commandery\nof St. Stephen, and who would not have taken the trouble had I not been\ntold that when you travel much it is necessary. Besides, you must have\nsomething on the panels of your carriage, to escape being searched by\nthe custom-house officers. Excuse my putting such a question to you.\"\n\n\"It is not indiscreet,\" returned Morcerf, with the simplicity of\nconviction. \"You have guessed rightly. These are our arms, that is,\nthose of my father, but they are, as you see, joined to another shield,\nwhich has gules, a silver tower, which are my mother's. By her side I am\nSpanish, but the family of Morcerf is French, and, I have heard, one of\nthe oldest of the south of France.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Monte Cristo \"these blazons prove that. Almost all the\narmed pilgrims that went to the Holy Land took for their arms either a\ncross, in honor of their mission, or birds of passage, in sign of\nthe long voyage they were about to undertake, and which they hoped to\naccomplish on the wings of faith. One of your ancestors had joined the\nCrusades, and supposing it to be only that of St. Louis, that makes you\nmount to the thirteenth century, which is tolerably ancient.\"\n\n\"It is possible,\" said Morcerf; \"my father has in his study a\ngenealogical tree which will tell you all that, and on which I made\ncommentaries that would have greatly edified Hozier and Jaucourt. At\npresent I no longer think of it, and yet I must tell you that we are\nbeginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these things under our\npopular government.\"\n\n\"Well, then, your government would do well to choose from the past\nsomething better than the things that I have noticed on your monuments,\nand which have no heraldic meaning whatever. As for you, viscount,\"\ncontinued Monte Cristo to Morcerf, \"you are more fortunate than the\ngovernment, for your arms are really beautiful, and speak to the\nimagination. Yes, you are at once from Provence and Spain; that\nexplains, if the portrait you showed me be like, the dark hue I so much\nadmired on the visage of the noble Catalan.\" It would have required the\npenetration of Oedipus or the Sphinx to have divined the irony the count\nconcealed beneath these words, apparently uttered with the greatest\npoliteness. Morcerf thanked him with a smile, and pushed open the door\nabove which were his arms, and which, as we have said, opened into the\nsalon. In the most conspicuous part of the salon was another portrait.\nIt was that of a man, from five to eight and thirty, in the uniform of\na general officer, wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion, that\nindicates superior rank, the ribbon of the Legion of Honor around his\nneck, which showed he was a commander, and on the right breast, the star\nof a grand officer of the order of the Saviour, and on the left that\nof the grand cross of Charles III., which proved that the person\nrepresented by the picture had served in the wars of Greece and Spain,\nor, what was just the same thing as regarded decorations, had fulfilled\nsome diplomatic mission in the two countries.\n\nMonte Cristo was engaged in examining this portrait with no less care\nthan he had bestowed upon the other, when another door opened, and he\nfound himself opposite to the Count of Morcerf in person. He was a man\nof forty to forty-five years, but he seemed at least fifty, and his\nblack mustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white\nhair, which was cut short, in the military fashion. He was dressed in\nplain clothes, and wore at his button-hole the ribbons of the different\norders to which he belonged. He entered with a tolerably dignified step,\nand some little haste. Monte Cristo saw him advance towards him without\nmaking a single step. It seemed as if his feet were rooted to the\nground, and his eyes on the Count of Morcerf. \"Father,\" said the young\nman, \"I have the honor of presenting to you the Count of Monte Cristo,\nthe generous friend whom I had the good fortune to meet in the critical\nsituation of which I have told you.\"\n\n\"You are most welcome, monsieur,\" said the Count of Morcerf, saluting\nMonte Cristo with a smile, \"and monsieur has rendered our house, in\npreserving its only heir, a service which insures him our eternal\ngratitude.\" As he said these words, the count of Morcerf pointed to a\nchair, while he seated himself in another opposite the window.\n\nMonte Cristo, in taking the seat Morcerf offered him, placed himself in\nsuch a manner as to remain concealed in the shadow of the large velvet\ncurtains, and read on the careworn and livid features of the count a\nwhole history of secret griefs written in each wrinkle time had planted\nthere. \"The countess,\" said Morcerf, \"was at her toilet when she was\ninformed of the visit she was about to receive. She will, however, be in\nthe salon in ten minutes.\"\n\n\"It is a great honor to me,\" returned Monte Cristo, \"to be thus, on the\nfirst day of my arrival in Paris, brought in contact with a man whose\nmerit equals his reputation, and to whom fortune has for once been\nequitable, but has she not still on the plains of Metidja, or in the\nmountains of Atlas, a marshal's staff to offer you?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" replied Morcerf, reddening slightly, \"I have left the service,\nmonsieur. Made a peer at the Restoration, I served through the first\ncampaign under the orders of Marshal Bourmont. I could, therefore,\nexpect a higher rank, and who knows what might have happened had the\nelder branch remained on the throne? But the Revolution of July was, it\nseems, sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful, and it\nwas so for all services that did not date from the imperial period. I\ntendered my resignation, for when you have gained your epaulets on the\nbattle-field, you do not know how to manoeuvre on the slippery grounds\nof the salons. I have hung up my sword, and cast myself into politics.\nI have devoted myself to industry; I study the useful arts. During the\ntwenty years I served, I often wished to do so, but I had not the time.\"\n\n\"These are the ideas that render your nation superior to any other,\"\nreturned Monte Cristo. \"A gentleman of high birth, possessor of an\nample fortune, you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure\nsoldier, step by step--this is uncommon; then become general, peer of\nFrance, commander of the Legion of Honor, you consent to again commence\na second apprenticeship, without any other hope or any other desire than\nthat of one day becoming useful to your fellow-creatures; this, indeed,\nis praiseworthy,--nay, more, it is sublime.\" Albert looked on and\nlistened with astonishment; he was not used to see Monte Cristo give\nvent to such bursts of enthusiasm. \"Alas,\" continued the stranger,\ndoubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered Morcerf's brow, \"we\ndo not act thus in Italy; we grow according to our race and our species,\nand we pursue the same lines, and often the same uselessness, all our\nlives.\"\n\n\"But, monsieur,\" said the Count of Morcerf, \"for a man of your merit,\nItaly is not a country, and France opens her arms to receive you;\nrespond to her call. France will not, perhaps, be always ungrateful. She\ntreats her children ill, but she always welcomes strangers.\"\n\n\"Ah, father,\" said Albert with a smile, \"it is evident you do not know\nthe Count of Monte Cristo; he despises all honors, and contents himself\nwith those written on his passport.\"\n\n\"That is the most just remark,\" replied the stranger, \"I ever heard made\nconcerning myself.\"\n\n\"You have been free to choose your career,\" observed the Count of\nMorcerf, with a sigh; \"and you have chosen the path strewed with\nflowers.\"\n\n\"Precisely, monsieur,\" replied Monte Cristo with one of those smiles\nthat a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze.\n\n\"If I did not fear to fatigue you,\" said the general, evidently charmed\nwith the count's manners, \"I would have taken you to the Chamber;\nthere is a debate very curious to those who are strangers to our modern\nsenators.\"\n\n\"I shall be most grateful, monsieur, if you will, at some future time,\nrenew your offer, but I have been flattered with the hope of being\nintroduced to the countess, and I will therefore wait.\"\n\n\"Ah, here is my mother,\" cried the viscount. Monte Cristo, turned round\nhastily, and saw Madame de Morcerf at the entrance of the salon, at\nthe door opposite to that by which her husband had entered, pale and\nmotionless; when Monte Cristo turned round, she let fall her arm, which\nfor some unknown reason had been resting on the gilded door-post.\nShe had been there some moments, and had heard the last words of the\nvisitor. The latter rose and bowed to the countess, who inclined herself\nwithout speaking. \"Ah, good heavens, madame,\" said the count, \"are you\nill, or is it the heat of the room that affects you?\"\n\n\"Are you ill, mother?\" cried the viscount, springing towards her.\n\nShe thanked them both with a smile. \"No,\" returned she, \"but I feel\nsome emotion on seeing, for the first time, the man without whose\nintervention we should have been in tears and desolation. Monsieur,\"\ncontinued the countess, advancing with the majesty of a queen, \"I owe to\nyou the life of my son, and for this I bless you. Now, I thank you\nfor the pleasure you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of\nthanking you as I have blessed you, from the bottom of my heart.\"\nThe count bowed again, but lower than before; He was even paler than\nMercedes. \"Madame,\" said he, \"the count and yourself recompense too\ngenerously a simple action. To save a man, to spare a father's feelings,\nor a mother's sensibility, is not to do a good action, but a simple deed\nof humanity.\" At these words, uttered with the most exquisite sweetness\nand politeness, Madame de Morcerf replied. \"It is very fortunate for my\nson, monsieur, that he found such a friend, and I thank God that things\nare thus.\" And Mercedes raised her fine eyes to heaven with so fervent\nan expression of gratitude, that the count fancied he saw tears in them.\nM. de Morcerf approached her. \"Madame,\" said he. \"I have already made my\nexcuses to the count for quitting him, and I pray you to do so also. The\nsitting commences at two; it is now three, and I am to speak.\"\n\n\"Go, then, and monsieur and I will strive our best to forget your\nabsence,\" replied the countess, with the same tone of deep feeling.\n\"Monsieur,\" continued she, turning to Monte Cristo, \"will you do us the\nhonor of passing the rest of the day with us?\"\n\n\"Believe me, madame, I feel most grateful for your kindness, but I\ngot out of my travelling carriage at your door this morning, and I am\nignorant how I am installed in Paris, which I scarcely know; this is but\na trifling inquietude, I know, but one that may be appreciated.\"\n\n\"We shall have the pleasure another time,\" said the countess; \"you\npromise that?\" Monte Cristo inclined himself without answering, but\nthe gesture might pass for assent. \"I will not detain you, monsieur,\"\ncontinued the countess; \"I would not have our gratitude become\nindiscreet or importunate.\"\n\n\"My dear Count,\" said Albert, \"I will endeavor to return your politeness\nat Rome, and place my coupe at your disposal until your own be ready.\"\n\n\"A thousand thanks for your kindness, viscount,\" returned the Count of\nMonte Cristo \"but I suppose that M. Bertuccio has suitably employed the\nfour hours and a half I have given him, and that I shall find a carriage\nof some sort ready at the door.\" Albert was used to the count's\nmanner of proceeding; he knew that, like Nero, he was in search of the\nimpossible, and nothing astonished him, but wishing to judge with his\nown eyes how far the count's orders had been executed, he accompanied\nhim to the door of the house. Monte Cristo was not deceived. As soon as\nhe appeared in the Count of Morcerf's ante-chamber, a footman, the\nsame who at Rome had brought the count's card to the two young men, and\nannounced his visit, sprang into the vestibule, and when he arrived at\nthe door the illustrious traveller found his carriage awaiting him. It\nwas a coupe of Koller's building, and with horses and harness for which\nDrake had, to the knowledge of all the lions of Paris, refused on\nthe previous day seven hundred guineas. \"Monsieur,\" said the count to\nAlbert, \"I do not ask you to accompany me to my house, as I can only\nshow you a habitation fitted up in a hurry, and I have, as you know, a\nreputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise. Give me,\ntherefore, one more day before I invite you; I shall then be certain not\nto fail in my hospitality.\"\n\n\"If you ask me for a day, count, I know what to anticipate; it will not\nbe a house I shall see, but a palace. You have decidedly some genius at\nyour control.\"\n\n\"Ma foi, spread that idea,\" replied the Count of Monte Cristo, putting\nhis foot on the velvet-lined steps of his splendid carriage, \"and that\nwill be worth something to me among the ladies.\" As he spoke, he sprang\ninto the vehicle, the door was closed, but not so rapidly that Monte\nCristo failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which\nstirred the curtains of the apartment in which he had left Madame de\nMorcerf. When Albert returned to his mother, he found her in the boudoir\nreclining in a large velvet arm-chair, the whole room so obscure that\nonly the shining spangle, fastened here and there to the drapery, and\nthe angles of the gilded frames of the pictures, showed with some\ndegree of brightness in the gloom. Albert could not see the face of the\ncountess, as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her head,\nand which fell over her features in misty folds, but it seemed to him as\nthough her voice had altered. He could distinguish amid the perfumes of\nthe roses and heliotropes in the flower-stands, the sharp and fragrant\nodor of volatile salts, and he noticed in one of the chased cups on the\nmantle-piece the countess's smelling-bottle, taken from its shagreen\ncase, and exclaimed in a tone of uneasiness, as he entered,--\"My dear\nmother, have you been ill during my absence?\"\n\n\"No, no, Albert, but you know these roses, tuberoses, and orange-flowers\nthrow out at first, before one is used to them, such violent perfumes.\"\n\n\"Then, my dear mother,\" said Albert, putting his hand to the bell, \"they\nmust be taken into the ante-chamber. You are really ill, and just now\nwere so pale as you came into the room\"--\n\n\"Was I pale, Albert?\"\n\n\"Yes; a pallor that suits you admirably, mother, but which did not the\nless alarm my father and myself.\"\n\n\"Did your father speak of it?\" inquired Mercedes eagerly.\n\n\"No, madame; but do you not remember that he spoke of the fact to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do remember,\" replied the countess. A servant entered, summoned\nby Albert's ring of the bell. \"Take these flowers into the anteroom or\ndressing-room,\" said the viscount; \"they make the countess ill.\" The\nfootman obeyed his orders. A long pause ensued, which lasted until all\nthe flowers were removed. \"What is this name of Monte Cristo?\" inquired\nthe countess, when the servant had taken away the last vase of flowers,\n\"is it a family name, or the name of the estate, or a simple title?\"\n\n\"I believe, mother, it is merely a title. The count purchased an island\nin the Tuscan archipelago, and, as he told you to-day, has founded\na commandery. You know the same thing was done for Saint Stephen of\nFlorence, Saint George, Constantinian of Parma, and even for the Order\nof Malta. Except this, he has no pretension to nobility, and calls\nhimself a chance count, although the general opinion at Rome is that the\ncount is a man of very high distinction.\"\n\n\"His manners are admirable,\" said the countess, \"at least, as far as I\ncould judge in the few minutes he remained here.\"\n\n\"They are perfect mother, so perfect, that they surpass by far all I\nhave known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities\nof Europe--the English, the Spanish, and the German.\" The countess\npaused a moment; then, after a slight hesitation, she resumed,--\"You\nhave seen, my dear Albert--I ask the question as a mother--you have\nseen M. de Monte Cristo in his house, you are quicksighted, have much\nknowledge of the world, more tact than is usual at your age, do you\nthink the count is really what he appears to be?\"\n\n\"What does he appear to be?\"\n\n\"Why, you have just said,--a man of high distinction.\"\n\n\"I told you, my dear mother, he was esteemed such.\"\n\n\"But what is your own opinion, Albert?\"\n\n\"I must tell you that I have not come to any decided opinion respecting\nhim, but I think him a Maltese.\"\n\n\"I do not ask you of his origin but what he is.\"\n\n\"Ah, what he is; that is quite another thing. I have seen so many\nremarkable things in him, that if you would have me really say what I\nthink, I shall reply that I really do look upon him as one of Byron's\nheroes, whom misery has marked with a fatal brand; some Manfred, some\nLara, some Werner, one of those wrecks, as it were, of some ancient\nfamily, who, disinherited of their patrimony, have achieved one by the\nforce of their adventurous genius, which has placed them above the laws\nof society.\"\n\n\"You say\"--\n\n\"I say that Monte Cristo is an island in the midst of the Mediterranean,\nwithout inhabitants or garrison, the resort of smugglers of all nations,\nand pirates of every flag. Who knows whether or not these industrious\nworthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection?\"\n\n\"That is possible,\" said the countess, reflecting.\n\n\"Never mind,\" continued the young man, \"smuggler or not, you must agree,\nmother dear, as you have seen him, that the Count of Monte Cristo is\na remarkable man, who will have the greatest success in the salons of\nParis. Why, this very morning, in my rooms, he made his entree amongst\nus by striking every man of us with amazement, not even excepting\nChateau-Renaud.\"\n\n\"And what do you suppose is the count's age?\" inquired Mercedes,\nevidently attaching great importance to this question.\n\n\"Thirty-five or thirty-six, mother.\"\n\n\"So young,--it is impossible,\" said Mercedes, replying at the same time\nto what Albert said as well as to her own private reflection.\n\n\"It is the truth, however. Three or four times he has said to me, and\ncertainly without the slightest premeditation, 'at such a period I was\nfive years old, at another ten years old, at another twelve,' and\nI, induced by curiosity, which kept me alive to these details, have\ncompared the dates, and never found him inaccurate. The age of this\nsingular man, who is of no age, is then, I am certain, thirty-five.\nBesides, mother, remark how vivid his eye, how raven-black his hair,\nand his brow, though so pale, is free from wrinkles,--he is not only\nvigorous, but also young.\" The countess bent her head, as if beneath a\nheavy wave of bitter thoughts. \"And has this man displayed a friendship\nfor you, Albert?\" she asked with a nervous shudder.\n\n\"I am inclined to think so.\"\n\n\"And--do--you--like--him?\"\n\n\"Why, he pleases me in spite of Franz d'Epinay, who tries to convince\nme that he is a being returned from the other world.\" The countess\nshuddered. \"Albert,\" she said, in a voice which was altered by emotion,\n\"I have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances. Now you\nare a man, and are able to give me advice; yet I repeat to you, Albert,\nbe prudent.\"\n\n\"Why, my dear mother, it is necessary, in order to make your advice turn\nto account, that I should know beforehand what I have to distrust.\nThe count never plays, he only drinks pure water tinged with a little\nsherry, and is so rich that he cannot, without intending to laugh at me,\ntry to borrow money. What, then, have I to fear from him?\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said the countess, \"and my fears are weakness,\nespecially when directed against a man who has saved your life. How did\nyour father receive him, Albert? It is necessary that we should be more\nthan complaisant to the count. M. de Morcerf is sometimes occupied, his\nbusiness makes him reflective, and he might, without intending it\"--\n\n\"Nothing could be in better taste than my father's demeanor, madame,\"\nsaid Albert; \"nay, more, he seemed greatly flattered at two or three\ncompliments which the count very skilfully and agreeably paid him with\nas much ease as if he had known him these thirty years. Each of these\nlittle tickling arrows must have pleased my father,\" added Albert with\na laugh. \"And thus they parted the best possible friends, and M. de\nMorcerf even wished to take him to the Chamber to hear the speakers.\"\nThe countess made no reply. She fell into so deep a revery that her eyes\ngradually closed. The young man, standing up before her, gazed upon\nher with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with\nchildren whose mothers are still young and handsome. Then, after seeing\nher eyes closed, and hearing her breathe gently, he believed she had\ndropped asleep, and left the apartment on tiptoe, closing the door after\nhim with the utmost precaution. \"This devil of a fellow,\" he muttered,\nshaking his head; \"I said at the time he would create a sensation here,\nand I measure his effect by an infallible thermometer. My mother has\nnoticed him, and he must therefore, perforce, be remarkable.\" He\nwent down to the stables, not without some slight annoyance, when\nhe remembered that the Count of Monte Cristo had laid his hands on a\n\"turnout\" which sent his bays down to second place in the opinion of\nconnoisseurs. \"Most decidedly,\" said he, \"men are not equal, and I must\nbeg my father to develop this theorem in the Chamber of Peers.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 42. Monsieur Bertuccio.\n\nMeanwhile the count had arrived at his house; it had taken him six\nminutes to perform the distance, but these six minutes were sufficient\nto induce twenty young men who knew the price of the equipage they had\nbeen unable to purchase themselves, to put their horses in a gallop in\norder to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give 20,000 francs\napiece for his horses. The house Ali had chosen, and which was to serve\nas a town residence to Monte Cristo, was situated on the right hand as\nyou ascend the Champs Elysees. A thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in\nthe centre, and masked a portion of the front; around this shrubbery\ntwo alleys, like two arms, extended right and left, and formed a\ncarriage-drive from the iron gates to a double portico, on every step of\nwhich stood a porcelain vase, filled with flowers. This house, isolated\nfrom the rest, had, besides the main entrance, another in the Rue\nPonthieu. Even before the coachman had hailed the concierge, the massy\ngates rolled on their hinges--they had seen the Count coming, and at\nParis, as everywhere else, he was served with the rapidity of lightning.\nThe coachman entered and traversed the half-circle without slackening\nhis speed, and the gates were closed ere the wheels had ceased to sound\non the gravel. The carriage stopped at the left side of the portico, two\nmen presented themselves at the carriage-window; the one was Ali, who,\nsmiling with an expression of the most sincere joy, seemed amply repaid\nby a mere look from Monte Cristo. The other bowed respectfully,\nand offered his arm to assist the count in descending. \"Thanks, M.\nBertuccio,\" said the count, springing lightly up the three steps of the\nportico; \"and the notary?\"\n\n\"He is in the small salon, excellency,\" returned Bertuccio.\n\n\"And the cards I ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number\nof the house?\"\n\n\"Your excellency, it is done already. I have been myself to the best\nengraver of the Palais Royal, who did the plate in my presence. The\nfirst card struck off was taken, according to your orders, to the Baron\nDanglars, Rue de la Chaussee d'Antin, No. 7; the others are on the\nmantle-piece of your excellency's bedroom.\"\n\n\"Good; what o'clock is it?\"\n\n\"Four o'clock.\" Monte Cristo gave his hat, cane, and gloves to the same\nFrench footman who had called his carriage at the Count of Morcerf's,\nand then he passed into the small salon, preceded by Bertuccio,\nwho showed him the way. \"These are but indifferent marbles in this\nante-chamber,\" said Monte Cristo. \"I trust all this will soon be taken\naway.\" Bertuccio bowed. As the steward had said, the notary awaited him\nin the small salon. He was a simple-looking lawyer's clerk, elevated to\nthe extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener. \"You are the notary\nempowered to sell the country house that I wish to purchase, monsieur?\"\nasked Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Yes, count,\" returned the notary.\n\n\"Is the deed of sale ready?\"\n\n\"Yes, count.\"\n\n\"Have you brought it?\"\n\n\"Here it is.\"\n\n\"Very well; and where is this house that I purchase?\" asked the count\ncarelessly, addressing himself half to Bertuccio, half to the notary.\nThe steward made a gesture that signified, \"I do not know.\" The notary\nlooked at the count with astonishment. \"What!\" said he, \"does not the\ncount know where the house he purchases is situated?\"\n\n\"No,\" returned the count.\n\n\"The count does not know?\"\n\n\"How should I know? I have arrived from Cadiz this morning. I have never\nbefore been at Paris, and it is the first time I have ever even set my\nfoot in France.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is different; the house you purchase is at Auteuil.\" At these\nwords Bertuccio turned pale. \"And where is Auteuil?\" asked the count.\n\n\"Close by here, monsieur,\" replied the notary--\"a little beyond Passy; a\ncharming situation, in the heart of the Bois de Boulogne.\"\n\n\"So near as that?\" said the Count; \"but that is not in the country. What\nmade you choose a house at the gates of Paris, M. Bertuccio?\"\n\n\"I,\" cried the steward with a strange expression. \"His excellency\ndid not charge me to purchase this house. If his excellency will\nrecollect--if he will think\"--\n\n\"Ah, true,\" observed Monte Cristo; \"I recollect now. I read the\nadvertisement in one of the papers, and was tempted by the false title,\n'a country house.'\"\n\n\"It is not yet too late,\" cried Bertuccio, eagerly; \"and if your\nexcellency will intrust me with the commission, I will find you a better\nat Enghien, at Fontenay-aux-Roses, or at Bellevue.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" returned Monte Cristo negligently; \"since I have this, I will\nkeep it.\"\n\n\"And you are quite right,\" said the notary, who feared to lose his fee.\n\"It is a charming place, well supplied with spring-water and fine trees;\na comfortable habitation, although abandoned for a long time, without\nreckoning the furniture, which, although old, is yet valuable, now that\nold things are so much sought after. I suppose the count has the tastes\nof the day?\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" returned Monte Cristo; \"it is very convenient, then?\"\n\n\"It is more--it is magnificent.\"\n\n\"Peste, let us not lose such an opportunity,\" returned Monte Cristo.\n\"The deed, if you please, Mr. Notary.\" And he signed it rapidly, after\nhaving first run his eye over that part of the deed in which were\nspecified the situation of the house and the names of the proprietors.\n\"Bertuccio,\" said he, \"give fifty-five thousand francs to monsieur.\" The\nsteward left the room with a faltering step, and returned with a bundle\nof bank-notes, which the notary counted like a man who never gives a\nreceipt for money until after he is sure it is all there. \"And now,\"\ndemanded the count, \"are all the forms complied with?\"\n\n\"All, sir.\"\n\n\"Have you the keys?\"\n\n\"They are in the hands of the concierge, who takes care of the house,\nbut here is the order I have given him to install the count in his new\npossessions.\"\n\n\"Very well;\" and Monte Cristo made a sign with his hand to the notary,\nwhich said, \"I have no further need of you; you may go.\"\n\n\"But,\" observed the honest notary, \"the count is, I think, mistaken; it\nis only fifty thousand francs, everything included.\"\n\n\"And your fee?\"\n\n\"Is included in this sum.\"\n\n\"But have you not come from Auteuil here?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of\ntime and trouble,\" said the count; and he made a gesture of polite\ndismissal. The notary left the room backwards, and bowing down to the\nground; it was the first time he had ever met a similar client. \"See\nthis gentleman out,\" said the count to Bertuccio. And the steward\nfollowed the notary out of the room. Scarcely was the count alone, when\nhe drew from his pocket a book closed with a lock, and opened it with a\nkey which he wore round his neck, and which never left him. After having\nsought for a few minutes, he stopped at a leaf which had several\nnotes, and compared them with the deed of sale, which lay on the table.\n\"'Auteuil, Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28;' it is indeed the same,\" said he;\n\"and now, am I to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or physical\nterror? However, in an hour I shall know all. Bertuccio!\" cried\nhe, striking a light hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong.\n\"Bertuccio!\" The steward appeared at the door. \"Monsieur Bertuccio,\"\nsaid the count, \"did you never tell me that you had travelled in\nFrance?\"\n\n\"In some parts of France--yes, excellency.\"\n\n\"You know the environs of Paris, then?\"\n\n\"No, excellency, no,\" returned the steward, with a sort of nervous\ntrembling, which Monte Cristo, a connoisseur in all emotions, rightly\nattributed to great disquietude.\n\n\"It is unfortunate,\" returned he, \"that you have never visited the\nenvirons, for I wish to see my new property this evening, and had you\ngone with me, you could have given me some useful information.\"\n\n\"To Auteuil!\" cried Bertuccio, whose copper complexion became livid--\"I\ngo to Auteuil?\"\n\n\"Well, what is there surprising in that? When I live at Auteuil, you\nmust come there, as you belong to my service.\" Bertuccio hung down his\nhead before the imperious look of his master, and remained motionless,\nwithout making any answer. \"Why, what has happened to you?--are you\ngoing to make me ring a second time for the carriage?\" asked Monte\nCristo, in the same tone that Louis XIV. pronounced the famous, \"I\nhave been almost obliged to wait.\" Bertuccio made but one bound to the\nante-chamber, and cried in a hoarse voice--\"His excellency's horses!\"\nMonte Cristo wrote two or three notes, and, as he sealed the last, the\nsteward appeared. \"Your excellency's carriage is at the door,\" said he.\n\n\"Well, take your hat and gloves,\" returned Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Am I to accompany you, your excellency?\" cried Bertuccio.\n\n\"Certainly, you must give the orders, for I intend residing at the\nhouse.\" It was unexampled for a servant of the count's to dare to\ndispute an order of his, so the steward, without saying a word, followed\nhis master, who got into the carriage, and signed to him to follow,\nwhich he did, taking his place respectfully on the front seat.\n\n\n\nChapter 43. The House at Auteuil.\n\nMonte Cristo noticed, as they descended the staircase, that Bertuccio\nsigned himself in the Corsican manner; that is, had formed the sign of\nthe cross in the air with his thumb, and as he seated himself in the\ncarriage, muttered a short prayer. Any one but a man of exhaustless\nthirst for knowledge would have had pity on seeing the steward's\nextraordinary repugnance for the count's projected drive without the\nwalls; but the Count was too curious to let Bertuccio off from this\nlittle journey. In twenty minutes they were at Auteuil; the steward's\nemotion had continued to augment as they entered the village. Bertuccio,\ncrouched in the corner of the carriage, began to examine with a feverish\nanxiety every house they passed. \"Tell them to stop at Rue de la\nFontaine, No. 28,\" said the count, fixing his eyes on the steward,\nto whom he gave this order. Bertuccio's forehead was covered with\nperspiration; however, he obeyed, and, leaning out of the window,\nhe cried to the coachman,--\"Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28.\" No. 28 was\nsituated at the extremity of the village; during the drive night had set\nin, and darkness gave the surroundings the artificial appearance of a\nscene on the stage. The carriage stopped, the footman sprang off the\nbox, and opened the door. \"Well,\" said the count, \"you do not get out,\nM. Bertuccio--you are going to stay in the carriage, then? What are\nyou thinking of this evening?\" Bertuccio sprang out, and offered his\nshoulder to the count, who, this time, leaned upon it as he descended\nthe three steps of the carriage. \"Knock,\" said the count, \"and announce\nme.\" Bertuccio knocked, the door opened, and the concierge appeared.\n\"What is it?\" asked he.\n\n\"It is your new master, my good fellow,\" said the footman. And he held\nout to the concierge the notary's order.\n\n\"The house is sold, then?\" demanded the concierge; \"and this gentleman\nis coming to live here?\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend,\" returned the count; \"and I will endeavor to give you\nno cause to regret your old master.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur,\" said the concierge, \"I shall not have much cause to\nregret him, for he came here but seldom; it is five years since he was\nhere last, and he did well to sell the house, for it did not bring him\nin anything at all.\"\n\n\"What was the name of your old master?\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"The Marquis of Saint-Meran. Ah, I am sure he has not sold the house for\nwhat he gave for it.\"\n\n\"The Marquis of Saint-Meran!\" returned the count. \"The name is not\nunknown to me; the Marquis of Saint-Meran!\" and he appeared to meditate.\n\n\"An old gentleman,\" continued the concierge, \"a stanch follower of the\nBourbons; he had an only daughter, who married M. de Villefort, who had\nbeen the king's attorney at Nimes, and afterwards at Versailles.\" Monte\nCristo glanced at Bertuccio, who became whiter than the wall against\nwhich he leaned to prevent himself from falling. \"And is not this\ndaughter dead?\" demanded Monte Cristo; \"I fancy I have heard so.\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, one and twenty years ago; and since then we have not\nseen the poor marquis three times.\"\n\n\"Thanks, thanks,\" said Monte Cristo, judging from the steward's utter\nprostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of\nbreaking it. \"Give me a light.\"\n\n\"Shall I accompany you, monsieur?\"\n\n\"No, it is unnecessary; Bertuccio will show me a light.\" And Monte\nCristo accompanied these words by the gift of two gold pieces, which\nproduced a torrent of thanks and blessings from the concierge. \"Ah,\nmonsieur,\" said he, after having vainly searched on the mantle-piece and\nthe shelves, \"I have not got any candles.\"\n\n\"Take one of the carriage-lamps, Bertuccio,\" said the count, \"and show\nme the apartments.\" The steward obeyed in silence, but it was easy to\nsee, from the manner in which the hand that held the light trembled, how\nmuch it cost him to obey. They went over a tolerably large ground-floor;\na second floor consisted of a salon, a bathroom, and two bedrooms; near\none of the bedrooms they came to a winding staircase that led down to\nthe garden.\n\n\"Ah, here is a private staircase,\" said the count; \"that is convenient.\nLight me, M. Bertuccio, and go first; we will see where it leads to.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied Bertuccio, \"it leads to the garden.\"\n\n\"And, pray, how do you know that?\"\n\n\"It ought to do so, at least.\"\n\n\"Well, let us be sure of that.\" Bertuccio sighed, and went on first; the\nstairs did, indeed, lead to the garden. At the outer door the steward\npaused. \"Go on, Monsieur Bertuccio,\" said the count. But he who was\naddressed stood there, stupefied, bewildered, stunned; his haggard eyes\nglanced around, as if in search of the traces of some terrible event,\nand with his clinched hands he seemed striving to shut out horrible\nrecollections. \"Well,\" insisted the Count. \"No, no,\" cried Bertuccio,\nsetting down the lantern at the angle of the interior wall. \"No,\nmonsieur, it is impossible; I can go no farther.\"\n\n\"What does this mean?\" demanded the irresistible voice of Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Why, you must see, your excellency,\" cried the steward, \"that this is\nnot natural; that, having a house to purchase, you purchase it exactly\nat Auteuil, and that, purchasing it at Auteuil, this house should be No.\n28, Rue de la Fontaine. Oh, why did I not tell you all? I am sure you\nwould not have forced me to come. I hoped your house would have been\nsome other one than this; as if there was not another house at Auteuil\nthan that of the assassination!\"\n\n\"What, what!\" cried Monte Cristo, stopping suddenly, \"what words do\nyou utter? Devil of a man, Corsican that you are--always mysteries or\nsuperstitions. Come, take the lantern, and let us visit the garden; you\nare not afraid of ghosts with me, I hope?\" Bertuccio raised the lantern,\nand obeyed. The door, as it opened, disclosed a gloomy sky, in which the\nmoon strove vainly to struggle through a sea of clouds that covered her\nwith billows of vapor which she illumined for an instant, only to\nsink into obscurity. The steward wished to turn to the left. \"No, no,\nmonsieur,\" said Monte Cristo. \"What is the use of following the alleys?\nHere is a beautiful lawn; let us go on straight forwards.\"\n\nBertuccio wiped the perspiration from his brow, but obeyed; however, he\ncontinued to take the left hand. Monte Cristo, on the contrary, took the\nright hand; arrived near a clump of trees, he stopped. The steward could\nnot restrain himself. \"Move, monsieur--move away, I entreat you; you are\nexactly in the spot!\"\n\n\"What spot?\"\n\n\"Where he fell.\"\n\n\"My dear Monsieur Bertuccio,\" said Monte Cristo, laughing, \"control\nyourself; we are not at Sartena or at Corte. This is not a Corsican\narbor, but an English garden; badly kept, I own, but still you must not\ncalumniate it for that.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I implore you do not stay there!\"\n\n\"I think you are going mad, Bertuccio,\" said the count coldly. \"If that\nis the case, I warn you, I shall have you put in a lunatic asylum.\"\n\n\"Alas, excellency,\" returned Bertuccio, joining his hands, and shaking\nhis head in a manner that would have excited the count's laughter,\nhad not thoughts of a superior interest occupied him, and rendered him\nattentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience. \"Alas,\nexcellency, the evil has arrived!\"\n\n\"M. Bertuccio,\" said the count, \"I am very glad to tell you, that while\nyou gesticulate, you wring your hands and roll your eyes like a man\npossessed by a devil who will not leave him; and I have always observed,\nthat the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a secret. I knew you\nwere a Corsican. I knew you were gloomy, and always brooding over some\nold history of the vendetta; and I overlooked that in Italy, because\nin Italy those things are thought nothing of. But in France they are\nconsidered in very bad taste; there are gendarmes who occupy themselves\nwith such affairs, judges who condemn, and scaffolds which avenge.\"\nBertuccio clasped his hands, and as, in all these evolutions, he did not\nlet fall the lantern, the light showed his pale and altered countenance.\nMonte Cristo examined him with the same look that, at Rome, he had bent\nupon the execution of Andrea, and then, in a tone that made a shudder\npass through the veins of the poor steward,--\"The Abbe Busoni, then told\nme an untruth,\" said he, \"when, after his journey in France, in 1829, he\nsent you to me, with a letter of recommendation, in which he enumerated\nall your valuable qualities. Well, I shall write to the abbe; I shall\nhold him responsible for his protege's misconduct, and I shall soon know\nall about this assassination. Only I warn you, that when I reside in\na country, I conform to all its code, and I have no wish to put myself\nwithin the compass of the French laws for your sake.\"\n\n\"Oh, do not do that, excellency; I have always served you faithfully,\"\ncried Bertuccio, in despair. \"I have always been an honest man, and, as\nfar as lay in my power, I have done good.\"\n\n\"I do not deny it,\" returned the count; \"but why are you thus agitated.\nIt is a bad sign; a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in\nthe cheeks, and such fever in the hands of a man.\"\n\n\"But, your excellency,\" replied Bertuccio hesitatingly, \"did not the\nAbbe Busoni, who heard my confession in the prison at Nimes, tell you\nthat I had a heavy burden upon my conscience?\"\n\n\"Yes; but as he said you would make an excellent steward, I concluded\nyou had stolen--that was all.\"\n\n\"Oh, your excellency,\" returned Bertuccio in deep contempt.\n\n\"Or, as you are a Corsican, that you had been unable to resist the\ndesire of making a 'stiff,' as you call it.\"\n\n\"Yes, my good master,\" cried Bertuccio, casting himself at the count's\nfeet, \"it was simply vengeance--nothing else.\"\n\n\"I understand that, but I do not understand what it is that galvanizes\nyou in this manner.\"\n\n\"But, monsieur, it is very natural,\" returned Bertuccio, \"since it was\nin this house that my vengeance was accomplished.\"\n\n\"What! my house?\"\n\n\"Oh, your excellency, it was not yours, then.\"\n\n\"Whose, then? The Marquis de Saint-Meran, I think, the concierge said.\nWhat had you to revenge on the Marquis de Saint-Meran?\"\n\n\"Oh, it was not on him, monsieur; it was on another.\"\n\n\"This is strange,\" returned Monte Cristo, seeming to yield to his\nreflections, \"that you should find yourself without any preparation in a\nhouse where the event happened that causes you so much remorse.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the steward, \"it is fatality, I am sure. First,\nyou purchase a house at Auteuil--this house is the one where I have\ncommitted an assassination; you descend to the garden by the same\nstaircase by which he descended; you stop at the spot where he received\nthe blow; and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried\nhis child. This is not chance, for chance, in this case, is too much\nlike providence.\"\n\n\"Well, amiable Corsican, let us suppose it is providence. I always\nsuppose anything people please, and, besides, you must concede something\nto diseased minds. Come, collect yourself, and tell me all.\"\n\n\"I have related it but once, and that was to the Abbe Busoni. Such\nthings,\" continued Bertuccio, shaking his head, \"are only related under\nthe seal of confession.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the count, \"I refer you to your confessor. Turn Chartreux\nor Trappist, and relate your secrets, but, as for me, I do not like\nany one who is alarmed by such phantasms, and I do not choose that my\nservants should be afraid to walk in the garden of an evening. I confess\nI am not very desirous of a visit from the commissary of police, for, in\nItaly, justice is only paid when silent--in France she is paid only\nwhen she speaks. Peste, I thought you somewhat Corsican, a great deal\nsmuggler, and an excellent steward; but I see you have other strings to\nyour bow. You are no longer in my service, Monsieur Bertuccio.\"\n\n\"Oh, your excellency, your excellency!\" cried the steward, struck with\nterror at this threat, \"if that is the only reason I cannot remain in\nyour service, I will tell all, for if I quit you, it will only be to go\nto the scaffold.\"\n\n\"That is different,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"but if you intend to tell an\nuntruth, reflect it were better not to speak at all.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, I swear to you, by my hopes of salvation, I will tell you\nall, for the Abbe Busoni himself only knew a part of my secret; but,\nI pray you, go away from that plane-tree. The moon is just bursting\nthrough the clouds, and there, standing where you do, and wrapped in\nthat cloak that conceals your figure, you remind me of M. de Villefort.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Monte Cristo, \"it was M. de Villefort?\"\n\n\"Your excellency knows him?\"\n\n\"The former royal attorney at Nimes?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Who married the Marquis of Saint-Meran's daughter?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe, the most upright,\nthe most rigid magistrate on the bench?\"\n\n\"Well, monsieur,\" said Bertuccio, \"this man with this spotless\nreputation\"--\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Was a villain.\"\n\n\"Bah,\" replied Monte Cristo, \"impossible!\"\n\n\"It is as I tell you.\"\n\n\"Ah, really,\" said Monte Cristo. \"Have you proof of this?\"\n\n\"I had it.\"\n\n\"And you have lost it; how stupid!\"\n\n\"Yes; but by careful search it might be recovered.\"\n\n\"Really,\" returned the count, \"relate it to me, for it begins to\ninterest me.\" And the count, humming an air from \"Lucia,\" went to sit\ndown on a bench, while Bertuccio followed him, collecting his thoughts.\nBertuccio remained standing before him.\n\n\n\nChapter 44. The Vendetta.\n\n\"At what point shall I begin my story, your excellency?\" asked\nBertuccio.\n\n\"Where you please,\" returned Monte Cristo, \"since I know nothing at all\nof it.\"\n\n\"I thought the Abbe Busoni had told your excellency.\"\n\n\"Some particulars, doubtless, but that is seven or eight years ago, and\nI have forgotten them.\"\n\n\"Then I can speak without fear of tiring your excellency.\"\n\n\"Go on, M. Bertuccio; you will supply the want of the evening papers.\"\n\n\"The story begins in 1815.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Monte Cristo, \"1815 is not yesterday.\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, and yet I recollect all things as clearly as if they had\nhappened but then. I had a brother, an elder brother, who was in the\nservice of the emperor; he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed\nentirely of Corsicans. This brother was my only friend; we became\norphans--I at five, he at eighteen. He brought me up as if I had been\nhis son, and in 1814 he married. When the emperor returned from the\nIsland of Elba, my brother instantly joined the army, was slightly\nwounded at Waterloo, and retired with the army beyond the Loire.\"\n\n\"But that is the history of the Hundred Days, M. Bertuccio,\" said the\ncount; \"unless I am mistaken, it has been already written.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, excellency, but these details are necessary, and you\npromised to be patient.\"\n\n\"Go on; I will keep my word.\"\n\n\"One day we received a letter. I should tell you that we lived in the\nlittle village of Rogliano, at the extremity of Cape Corso. This letter\nwas from my brother. He told us that the army was disbanded, and that he\nshould return by Chateauroux, Clermont-Ferrand, Le Puy, and Nimes; and,\nif I had any money, he prayed me to leave it for him at Nimes, with an\ninn-keeper with whom I had dealings.\"\n\n\"In the smuggling line?\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Eh, your excellency? Every one must live.\"\n\n\"Certainly; go on.\"\n\n\"I loved my brother tenderly, as I told your excellency, and I resolved\nnot to send the money, but to take it to him myself. I possessed a\nthousand francs. I left five hundred with Assunta, my sister-in-law, and\nwith the other five hundred I set off for Nimes. It was easy to do so,\nand as I had my boat and a lading to take in at sea, everything favored\nmy project. But, after we had taken in our cargo, the wind became\ncontrary, so that we were four or five days without being able to enter\nthe Rhone. At last, however, we succeeded, and worked up to Arles. I\nleft the boat between Bellegarde and Beaucaire, and took the road to\nNimes.\"\n\n\"We are getting to the story now?\"\n\n\"Yes, your excellency; excuse me, but, as you will see, I only tell you\nwhat is absolutely necessary. Just at this time the famous massacres\ntook place in the south of France. Three brigands, called Trestaillon,\nTruphemy, and Graffan, publicly assassinated everybody whom they\nsuspected of Bonapartism. You have doubtless heard of these massacres,\nyour excellency?\"\n\n\"Vaguely; I was far from France at that period. Go on.\"\n\n\"As I entered Nimes, I literally waded in blood; at every step you\nencountered dead bodies and bands of murderers, who killed, plundered,\nand burned. At the sight of this slaughter and devastation I became\nterrified, not for myself--for I, a simple Corsican fisherman, had\nnothing to fear; on the contrary, that time was most favorable for us\nsmugglers--but for my brother, a soldier of the empire, returning from\nthe army of the Loire, with his uniform and his epaulets, there was\neverything to apprehend. I hastened to the inn-keeper. My misgivings had\nbeen but too true. My brother had arrived the previous evening at\nNimes, and, at the very door of the house where he was about to demand\nhospitality, he had been assassinated. I did all in my power to discover\nthe murderers, but no one durst tell me their names, so much were they\ndreaded. I then thought of that French justice of which I had heard so\nmuch, and which feared nothing, and I went to the king's attorney.\"\n\n\"And this king's attorney was named Villefort?\" asked Monte Cristo\ncarelessly.\n\n\"Yes, your excellency; he came from Marseilles, where he had been\ndeputy-procureur. His zeal had procured him advancement, and he was said\nto be one of the first who had informed the government of the departure\nfrom the Island of Elba.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Monte Cristo \"you went to him?\"\n\n\"'Monsieur,' I said, 'my brother was assassinated yesterday in the\nstreets of Nimes, I know not by whom, but it is your duty to find out.\nYou are the representative of justice here, and it is for justice to\navenge those she has been unable to protect.'--'Who was your brother?'\nasked he.--'A lieutenant in the Corsican battalion.'--'A soldier of the\nusurper, then?'--'A soldier of the French army.'--'Well,' replied he,\n'he has smitten with the sword, and he has perished by the sword.'--'You\nare mistaken, monsieur,' I replied; 'he has perished by the\nponiard.'--'What do you want me to do?' asked the magistrate.--'I have\nalready told you--avenge him.'--'On whom?'--'On his murderers.'--'How\nshould I know who they are?'--'Order them to be sought for.'--'Why, your\nbrother has been involved in a quarrel, and killed in a duel. All these\nold soldiers commit excesses which were tolerated in the time of the\nemperor, but which are not suffered now, for the people here do not like\nsoldiers of such disorderly conduct.'--'Monsieur,' I replied, 'it is not\nfor myself that I entreat your interference--I should grieve for him or\navenge him, but my poor brother had a wife, and were anything to happen\nto me, the poor creature would perish from want, for my brother's pay\nalone kept her. Pray, try and obtain a small government pension for\nher.'\n\n\"'Every revolution has its catastrophes,' returned M. de Villefort;\n'your brother has been the victim of this. It is a misfortune, and\ngovernment owes nothing to his family. If we are to judge by all the\nvengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans\nof the king, when, in their turn, they were in power, your brother would\nbe to-day, in all probability, condemned to death. What has happened is\nquite natural, and in conformity with the law of reprisals.'--'What,'\ncried I, 'do you, a magistrate, speak thus to me?'--'All these Corsicans\nare mad, on my honor,' replied M. de Villefort; 'they fancy that their\ncountryman is still emperor. You have mistaken the time, you should have\ntold me this two months ago, it is too late now. Go now, at once, or I\nshall have you put out.'\n\n\"I looked at him an instant to see if there was anything to hope from\nfurther entreaty. But he was a man of stone. I approached him, and said\nin a low voice, 'Well, since you know the Corsicans so well, you know\nthat they always keep their word. You think that it was a good deed\nto kill my brother, who was a Bonapartist, because you are a royalist.\nWell, I, who am a Bonapartist also, declare one thing to you, which is,\nthat I will kill you. From this moment I declare the vendetta against\nyou, so protect yourself as well as you can, for the next time we meet\nyour last hour has come.' And before he had recovered from his surprise,\nI opened the door and left the room.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Monte Cristo, \"such an innocent looking person as you\nare to do those things, M. Bertuccio, and to a king's attorney at that!\nBut did he know what was meant by the terrible word 'vendetta'?\"\n\n\"He knew so well, that from that moment he shut himself in his house,\nand never went out unattended, seeking me high and low. Fortunately, I\nwas so well concealed that he could not find me. Then he became alarmed,\nand dared not stay any longer at Nimes, so he solicited a change of\nresidence, and, as he was in reality very influential, he was nominated\nto Versailles. But, as you know, a Corsican who has sworn to avenge\nhimself cares not for distance, so his carriage, fast as it went, was\nnever above half a day's journey before me, who followed him on foot.\nThe most important thing was, not to kill him only--for I had an\nopportunity of doing so a hundred times--but to kill him without being\ndiscovered--at least, without being arrested. I no longer belonged to\nmyself, for I had my sister-in-law to protect and provide for. For three\nmonths I watched M. de Villefort, for three months he took not a step\nout-of-doors without my following him. At length I discovered that he\nwent mysteriously to Auteuil. I followed him thither, and I saw him\nenter the house where we now are, only, instead of entering by the\ngreat door that looks into the street, he came on horseback, or in his\ncarriage, left the one or the other at the little inn, and entered by\nthe gate you see there.\" Monte Cristo made a sign with his head to\nshow that he could discern in the darkness the door to which Bertuccio\nalluded. \"As I had nothing more to do at Versailles, I went to Auteuil,\nand gained all the information I could. If I wished to surprise him,\nit was evident this was the spot to lie in wait for him. The house\nbelonged, as the concierge informed your excellency, to M. de\nSaint-Meran, Villefort's father-in-law. M. de Saint-Meran lived at\nMarseilles, so that this country house was useless to him, and it was\nreported to be let to a young widow, known only by the name of 'the\nbaroness.'\n\n\"One evening, as I was looking over the wall, I saw a young and handsome\nwoman who was walking alone in that garden, which was not overlooked by\nany windows, and I guessed that she was awaiting M. de Villefort. When\nshe was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her features, I saw she\nwas from eighteen to nineteen, tall and very fair. As she had a loose\nmuslin dress on and as nothing concealed her figure, I saw she would ere\nlong become a mother. A few moments after, the little door was opened\nand a man entered. The young woman hastened to meet him. They threw\nthemselves into each other's arms, embraced tenderly, and returned\ntogether to the house. The man was M. de Villefort; I fully believed\nthat when he went out in the night he would be forced to traverse the\nwhole of the garden alone.\"\n\n\"And,\" asked the count, \"did you ever know the name of this woman?\"\n\n\"No, excellency,\" returned Bertuccio; \"you will see that I had no time\nto learn it.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"That evening,\" continued Bertuccio, \"I could have killed the procureur,\nbut as I was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood, I was\nfearful of not killing him on the spot, and that if his cries were\noverheard I might be taken; so I put it off until the next occasion, and\nin order that nothing should escape me, I took a chamber looking into\nthe street bordered by the wall of the garden. Three days after, about\nseven o'clock in the evening, I saw a servant on horseback leave the\nhouse at full gallop, and take the road to Sevres. I concluded that he\nwas going to Versailles, and I was not deceived. Three hours later,\nthe man returned covered with dust, his errand was performed, and two\nminutes after, another man on foot, muffled in a mantle, opened the\nlittle door of the garden, which he closed after him. I descended\nrapidly; although I had not seen Villefort's face, I recognized him by\nthe beating of my heart. I crossed the street, and stopped at a post\nplaced at the angle of the wall, and by means of which I had once before\nlooked into the garden. This time I did not content myself with looking,\nbut I took my knife out of my pocket, felt that the point was sharp, and\nsprang over the wall. My first care was to run to the door; he had left\nthe key in it, taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the\nlock. Nothing, then, preventing my escape by this means, I examined\nthe grounds. The garden was long and narrow; a stretch of smooth turf\nextended down the middle, and at the corners were clumps of trees with\nthick and massy foliage, that made a background for the shrubs and\nflowers. In order to go from the door to the house, or from the house\nto the door, M. de Villefort would be obliged to pass by one of these\nclumps of trees.\n\n\"It was the end of September; the wind blew violently. The faint\nglimpses of the pale moon, hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds\nthat were sweeping across the sky, whitened the gravel walks that led\nto the house, but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick\nshrubberies, in which a man could conceal himself without any fear of\ndiscovery. I hid myself in the one nearest to the path Villefort must\ntake, and scarcely was I there when, amidst the gusts of wind, I\nfancied I heard groans; but you know, or rather you do not know, your\nexcellency, that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that\nhe hears low cries perpetually ringing in his ears. Two hours passed\nthus, during which I imagined I heard moans repeatedly. Midnight struck.\nAs the last stroke died away, I saw a faint light shine through the\nwindows of the private staircase by which we have just descended. The\ndoor opened, and the man in the mantle reappeared. The terrible moment\nhad come, but I had so long been prepared for it that my heart did not\nfail in the least. I drew my knife from my pocket again, opened it, and\nmade ready to strike. The man in the mantle advanced towards me, but as\nhe drew near I saw that he had a weapon in his hand. I was afraid, not\nof a struggle, but of a failure. When he was only a few paces from me,\nI saw that what I had taken for a weapon was only a spade. I was still\nunable to divine for what reason M. de Villefort had this spade in his\nhands, when he stopped close to the thicket where I was, glanced round,\nand began to dig a hole in the earth. I then perceived that he was\nhiding something under his mantle, which he laid on the grass in order\nto dig more freely. Then, I confess, curiosity mingled with hatred;\nI wished to see what Villefort was going to do there, and I remained\nmotionless, holding my breath. Then an idea crossed my mind, which was\nconfirmed when I saw the procureur lift from under his mantle a box, two\nfeet long, and six or eight inches deep. I let him place the box in the\nhole he had made, then, while he stamped with his feet to remove all\ntraces of his occupation, I rushed on him and plunged my knife into\nhis breast, exclaiming,--'I am Giovanni Bertuccio; thy death for my\nbrother's; thy treasure for his widow; thou seest that my vengeance is\nmore complete than I had hoped.' I know not if he heard these words; I\nthink he did not, for he fell without a cry. I felt his blood gush\nover my face, but I was intoxicated, I was delirious, and the blood\nrefreshed, instead of burning me. In a second I had disinterred the box;\nthen, that it might not be known I had done so, I filled up the hole,\nthrew the spade over the wall, and rushed through the door, which I\ndouble-locked, carrying off the key.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Monte Cristo \"it seems to me this was nothing but murder and\nrobbery.\"\n\n\"No, your excellency,\" returned Bertuccio; \"it was a vendetta followed\nby restitution.\"\n\n\"And was the sum a large one?\"\n\n\"It was not money.\"\n\n\"Ah, I recollect,\" replied the count; \"did you not say something of an\ninfant?\"\n\n\"Yes, excellency; I hastened to the river, sat down on the bank, and\nwith my knife forced open the lock of the box. In a fine linen cloth\nwas wrapped a new-born child. Its purple visage, and its violet-colored\nhands showed that it had perished from suffocation, but as it was not\nyet cold, I hesitated to throw it into the water that ran at my feet.\nAfter a moment I fancied that I felt a slight pulsation of the heart,\nand as I had been assistant at the hospital at Bastia, I did what a\ndoctor would have done--I inflated the lungs by blowing air into them,\nand at the expiration of a quarter of an hour, it began to breathe, and\ncried feebly. In my turn I uttered a cry, but a cry of joy. 'God has\nnot cursed me then,' I cried, 'since he permits me to save the life of a\nhuman creature, in exchange for the life I have taken away.'\"\n\n\"And what did you do with the child?\" asked Monte Cristo. \"It was an\nembarrassing load for a man seeking to escape.\"\n\n\"I had not for a moment the idea of keeping it, but I knew that at Paris\nthere was an asylum where they receive such creatures. As I passed the\ncity gates I declared that I had found the child on the road, and I\ninquired where the asylum was; the box confirmed my statement, the linen\nproved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents, the blood with which\nI was covered might have proceeded from the child as well as from any\none else. No objection was raised, but they pointed out the asylum,\nwhich was situated at the upper end of the Rue d'Enfer, and after having\ntaken the precaution of cutting the linen in two pieces, so that one\nof the two letters which marked it was on the piece wrapped around the\nchild, while the other remained in my possession, I rang the bell, and\nfled with all speed. A fortnight after I was at Rogliano, and I said to\nAssunta,--'Console thyself, sister; Israel is dead, but he is avenged.'\nShe demanded what I meant, and when I had told her all,--'Giovanni,'\nsaid she, 'you should have brought this child with you; we would have\nreplaced the parents it has lost, have called it Benedetto, and then, in\nconsequence of this good action, God would have blessed us.' In reply I\ngave her the half of the linen I had kept in order to reclaim him if we\nbecame rich.\"\n\n\"What letters were marked on the linen?\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"An H and an N, surmounted by a baron's coronet.\"\n\n\"By heaven, M. Bertuccio, you make use of heraldic terms; where did you\nstudy heraldry?\"\n\n\"In your service, excellency, where everything is learned.\"\n\n\"Go on, I am curious to know two things.\"\n\n\"What are they, your excellency?\"\n\n\"What became of this little boy? for I think you told me it was a boy,\nM. Bertuccio.\"\n\n\"No excellency, I do not recollect telling you that.\"\n\n\"I thought you did; I must have been mistaken.\"\n\n\"No, you were not, for it was in reality a little boy. But your\nexcellency wished to know two things; what was the second?\"\n\n\"The second was the crime of which you were accused when you asked for a\nconfessor, and the Abbe Busoni came to visit you at your request in the\nprison at Nimes.\"\n\n\"The story will be very long, excellency.\"\n\n\"What matter? you know I take but little sleep, and I do not suppose you\nare very much inclined for it either.\" Bertuccio bowed, and resumed his\nstory.\n\n\"Partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me, partly\nto supply the wants of the poor widow, I eagerly returned to my trade of\nsmuggler, which had become more easy since that relaxation of the\nlaws which always follows a revolution. The southern districts were\nill-watched in particular, in consequence of the disturbances that were\nperpetually breaking out in Avignon, Nimes, or Uzes. We profited by this\nrespite on the part of the government to make friends everywhere. Since\nmy brother's assassination in the streets of Nimes, I had never\nentered the town; the result was that the inn-keeper with whom we were\nconnected, seeing that we would no longer come to him, was forced to\ncome to us, and had established a branch to his inn, on the road from\nBellegarde to Beaucaire, at the sign of the Pont du Gard. We had thus,\nat Aigues-Mortes, Martigues, or Bouc, a dozen places where we left our\ngoods, and where, in case of necessity, we concealed ourselves from the\ngendarmes and custom-house officers. Smuggling is a profitable trade,\nwhen a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed; as for\nmyself, brought up in the mountains, I had a double motive for fearing\nthe gendarmes and custom-house officers, as my appearance before the\njudges would cause an inquiry, and an inquiry always looks back into the\npast. And in my past life they might find something far more grave than\nthe selling of smuggled cigars, or barrels of brandy without a permit.\nSo, preferring death to capture, I accomplished the most astonishing\ndeeds, and which, more than once, showed me that the too great care we\ntake of our bodies is the only obstacle to the success of those projects\nwhich require rapid decision, and vigorous and determined execution. In\nreality, when you have once devoted your life to your enterprises,\nyou are no longer the equal of other men, or, rather, other men are no\nlonger your equals, and whosoever has taken this resolution, feels his\nstrength and resources doubled.\"\n\n\"Philosophy, M. Bertuccio,\" interrupted the Count; \"you have done a\nlittle of everything in your life.\"\n\n\"Oh, excellency!\"\n\n\"No, no; but philosophy at half-past ten at night is somewhat late; yet\nI have no other observation to make, for what you say is correct, which\nis more than can be said for all philosophy.\"\n\n\"My journeys became more and more extensive and more productive. Assunta\ntook care of all, and our little fortune increased. One day as I was\nsetting off on an expedition, 'Go,' said she; 'at your return I will\ngive you a surprise.' I questioned her, but in vain; she would tell me\nnothing, and I departed. Our expedition lasted nearly six weeks; we had\nbeen to Lucca to take in oil, to Leghorn for English cottons, and we\nran our cargo without opposition, and returned home full of joy. When I\nentered the house, the first thing I beheld in the middle of Assunta's\nchamber was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the\nrest of the furniture, and in it a baby seven or eight months old. I\nuttered a cry of joy; the only moments of sadness I had known since the\nassassination of the procureur were caused by the recollection that I\nhad abandoned this child. For the assassination itself I had never\nfelt any remorse. Poor Assunta had guessed all. She had profited by my\nabsence, and furnished with the half of the linen, and having written\ndown the day and hour at which I had deposited the child at the asylum,\nhad set off for Paris, and had reclaimed it. No objection was raised,\nand the infant was given up to her. Ah, I confess, your excellency, when\nI saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle, I felt my\neyes filled with tears. 'Ah, Assunta,' cried I, 'you are an excellent\nwoman, and heaven will bless you.'\"\n\n\"This,\" said Monte Cristo, \"is less correct than your philosophy,--it is\nonly faith.\"\n\n\"Alas, your excellency is right,\" replied Bertuccio, \"and God made this\ninfant the instrument of our punishment. Never did a perverse nature\ndeclare itself more prematurely, and yet it was not owing to any fault\nin his bringing up. He was a most lovely child, with large blue eyes, of\nthat deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion; only\nhis hair, which was too light, gave his face a most singular expression,\nand added to the vivacity of his look, and the malice of his smile.\nUnfortunately, there is a proverb which says that 'red is either\naltogether good or altogether bad.' The proverb was but too correct\nas regarded Benedetto, and even in his infancy he manifested the\nworst disposition. It is true that the indulgence of his foster-mother\nencouraged him. This child, for whom my poor sister would go to the\ntown, five or six leagues off, to purchase the earliest fruits and\nthe most tempting sweetmeats, preferred to Palma grapes or Genoese\npreserves, the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor's orchard, or the dried\napples in his loft, when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples\nthat grew in my garden. One day, when Benedetto was about five or six,\nour neighbor Vasilio, who, according to the custom of the country, never\nlocked up his purse or his valuables--for, as your excellency knows,\nthere are no thieves in Corsica--complained that he had lost a louis\nout of his purse; we thought he must have made a mistake in counting\nhis money, but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement. One day,\nBenedetto, who had been gone from the house since morning, to our great\nanxiety, did not return until late in the evening, dragging a monkey\nafter him, which he said he had found chained to the foot of a tree. For\nmore than a month past, the mischievous child, who knew not what to wish\nfor, had taken it into his head to have a monkey. A boatman, who had\npassed by Rogliano, and who had several of these animals, whose tricks\nhad greatly diverted him, had, doubtless, suggested this idea to him.\n'Monkeys are not found in our woods chained to trees,' said I; 'confess\nhow you obtained this animal.' Benedetto maintained the truth of what\nhe had said, and accompanied it with details that did more honor to his\nimagination than to his veracity. I became angry; he began to laugh, I\nthreatened to strike him, and he made two steps backwards. 'You cannot\nbeat me,' said he; 'you have no right, for you are not my father.'\n\n\"We never knew who had revealed this fatal secret, which we had so\ncarefully concealed from him; however, it was this answer, in which the\nchild's whole character revealed itself, that almost terrified me, and\nmy arm fell without touching him. The boy triumphed, and this victory\nrendered him so audacious, that all the money of Assunta, whose\naffection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it,\nwas spent in caprices she knew not how to contend against, and follies\nshe had not the courage to prevent. When I was at Rogliano everything\nwent on properly, but no sooner was my back turned than Benedetto became\nmaster, and everything went ill. When he was only eleven, he chose his\ncompanions from among the young men of eighteen or twenty, the worst\ncharacters in Bastia, or, indeed, in Corsica, and they had already,\nfor some mischievous pranks, been several times threatened with a\nprosecution. I became alarmed, as any prosecution might be attended with\nserious consequences. I was compelled, at this period, to leave Corsica\non an important expedition; I reflected for a long time, and with the\nhope of averting some impending misfortune, I resolved that Benedetto\nshould accompany me. I hoped that the active and laborious life of a\nsmuggler, with the severe discipline on board, would have a salutary\neffect on his character, which was now well-nigh, if not quite, corrupt.\nI spoke to Benedetto alone, and proposed to him to accompany me,\nendeavoring to tempt him by all the promises most likely to dazzle the\nimagination of a child of twelve. He heard me patiently, and when I had\nfinished, burst out laughing.\n\n\"'Are you mad, uncle?' (he called me by this name when he was in good\nhumor); 'do you think I am going to change the life I lead for your mode\nof existence--my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil\nyou impose on yourself, exposed to the bitter frost at night, and the\nscorching heat by day, compelled to conceal yourself, and when you are\nperceived, receive a volley of bullets, all to earn a paltry sum? Why, I\nhave as much money as I want; mother Assunta always furnishes me when I\nask for it! You see that I should be a fool to accept your offer.' The\narguments, and his audacity, perfectly stupefied me. Benedetto rejoined\nhis associates, and I saw him from a distance point me out to them as a\nfool.\"\n\n\"Sweet child,\" murmured Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Oh, had he been my own son,\" replied Bertuccio, \"or even my nephew, I\nwould have brought him back to the right road, for the knowledge that\nyou are doing your duty gives you strength, but the idea that I was\nstriking a child whose father I had killed, made it impossible for me\nto punish him. I gave my sister, who constantly defended the unfortunate\nboy, good advice, and as she confessed that she had several times missed\nmoney to a considerable amount, I showed her a safe place in which to\nconceal our little treasure for the future. My mind was already made\nup. Benedetto could read, write, and cipher perfectly, for when the fit\nseized him, he learned more in a day than others in a week. My intention\nwas to enter him as a clerk in some ship, and without letting him know\nanything of my plan, to convey him some morning on board; by this means\nhis future treatment would depend upon his own conduct. I set off for\nFrance, after having fixed upon the plan. Our cargo was to be landed in\nthe Gulf of Lyons, and this was a difficult thing to do because it was\nthen the year 1829. The most perfect tranquillity was restored, and\nthe vigilance of the custom-house officers was redoubled, and their\nstrictness was increased at this time, in consequence of the fair at\nBeaucaire.\n\n\"Our expedition made a favorable beginning. We anchored our\nvessel--which had a double hold, where our goods were concealed--amidst\na number of other vessels that bordered the banks of the Rhone from\nBeaucaire to Arles. On our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in\nthe night, and to convey it into the town, by the help of the inn-keeper\nwith whom we were connected. Whether success rendered us imprudent,\nor whether we were betrayed, I know not; but one evening, about five\no'clock, our little cabin-boy came breathlessly, to inform us that\nhe had seen a detachment of custom-house officers advancing in our\ndirection. It was not their proximity that alarmed us, for detachments\nwere constantly patrolling along the banks of the Rhone, but the care,\naccording to the boy's account, that they took to avoid being seen. In\nan instant we were on the alert, but it was too late; our vessel was\nsurrounded, and amongst the custom-house officers I observed several\ngendarmes, and, as terrified at the sight of their uniforms as I was\nbrave at the sight of any other, I sprang into the hold, opened a\nport, and dropped into the river, dived, and only rose at intervals to\nbreathe, until I reached a ditch that had recently been made from the\nRhone to the canal that runs from Beaucaire to Aigues-Mortes. I was now\nsafe, for I could swim along the ditch without being seen, and I reached\nthe canal in safety. I had designedly taken this direction. I have\nalready told your excellency of an inn-keeper from Nimes who had set up\na little tavern on the road from Bellegarde to Beaucaire.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Monte Cristo \"I perfectly recollect him; I think he was your\ncolleague.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" answered Bertuccio; \"but he had, seven or eight years\nbefore this period, sold his establishment to a tailor at Marseilles,\nwho, having almost ruined himself in his old trade, wished to make his\nfortune in another. Of course, we made the same arrangements with the\nnew landlord that we had with the old; and it was of this man that I\nintended to ask shelter.\"\n\n\"What was his name?\" inquired the count, who seemed to become somewhat\ninterested in Bertuccio's story.\n\n\"Gaspard Caderousse; he had married a woman from the village of\nCarconte, and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her\nvillage. She was suffering from malarial fever, and seemed dying by\ninches. As for her husband, he was a strapping fellow of forty, or five\nand forty, who had more than once, in time of danger, given ample proof\nof his presence of mind and courage.\"\n\n\"And you say,\" interrupted Monte Cristo \"that this took place towards\nthe year\"--\n\n\"1829, your excellency.\"\n\n\"In what month?\"\n\n\"June.\"\n\n\"The beginning or the end?\"\n\n\"The evening of the 3d.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Monte Cristo \"the evening of the 3d of June, 1829. Go on.\"\n\n\"It was from Caderousse that I intended demanding shelter, and, as we\nnever entered by the door that opened onto the road, I resolved not\nto break through the rule, so climbing over the garden-hedge, I crept\namongst the olive and wild fig trees, and fearing that Caderousse might\nhave some guest, I entered a kind of shed in which I had often passed\nthe night, and which was only separated from the inn by a partition, in\nwhich holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity\nof announcing our presence. My intention was, if Caderousse was alone,\nto acquaint him with my presence, finish the meal the custom-house\nofficers had interrupted, and profit by the threatened storm to return\nto the Rhone, and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew. I\nstepped into the shed, and it was fortunate I did so, for at that moment\nCaderousse entered with a stranger.\n\n\"I waited patiently, not to overhear what they said, but because I could\ndo nothing else; besides, the same thing had occurred often before. The\nman who was with Caderousse was evidently a stranger to the South of\nFrance; he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at\nthe Beaucaire fair, and who during the month the fair lasts, and during\nwhich there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all\nparts of Europe, often have dealings to the amount of 100,000 to 150,000\nfrancs. Caderousse entered hastily. Then, seeing that the room was,\nas usual, empty, and only guarded by the dog, he called to his wife,\n'Hello, Carconte,' said he, 'the worthy priest has not deceived us; the\ndiamond is real.' An exclamation of joy was heard, and the staircase\ncreaked beneath a feeble step. 'What do you say?' asked his wife, pale\nas death.\n\n\"'I say that the diamond is real, and that this gentleman, one of the\nfirst jewellers of Paris, will give us 50,000. francs for it. Only, in\norder to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us, he wishes you to\nrelate to him, as I have done already, the miraculous manner in which\nthe diamond came into our possession. In the meantime please to sit\ndown, monsieur, and I will fetch you some refreshment.' The jeweller\nexamined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty\nof the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have\ncome from the casket of a prince. 'Relate your story, madame,' said he,\nwishing, no doubt, to profit by the absence of the husband, so that the\nlatter could not influence the wife's story, to see if the two recitals\ntallied.\n\n\"'Oh,' returned she, 'it was a gift of heaven. My husband was a great\nfriend, in 1814 or 1815, of a sailor named Edmond Dantes. This poor\nfellow, whom Caderousse had forgotten, had not forgotten him, and at his\ndeath he bequeathed this diamond to him.'--'But how did he obtain\nit?' asked the jeweller; 'had he it before he was imprisoned?'--'No,\nmonsieur; but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a\nrich Englishman, and as in prison he fell sick, and Dantes took the same\ncare of him as if he had been his brother, the Englishman, when he was\nset free, gave this stone to Dantes, who, less fortunate, died, and, in\nhis turn, left it to us, and charged the excellent abbe, who was here\nthis morning, to deliver it.'--'The same story,' muttered the jeweller;\n'and improbable as it seemed at first, it may be true. There's only\nthe price we are not agreed about.'--'How not agreed about?' said\nCaderousse. 'I thought we agreed for the price I asked.'--'That is,'\nreplied the jeweller, 'I offered 40,000 francs.'--'Forty thousand,'\ncried La Carconte; 'we will not part with it for that sum. The abbe told\nus it was worth 50,000. without the setting.'\n\n\"'What was the abbe's name?' asked the indefatigable questioner.--'The\nAbbe Busoni,' said La Carconte.--'He was a foreigner?'--'An Italian,\nfrom the neighborhood of Mantua, I believe.'--'Let me see this diamond\nagain,' replied the jeweller; 'the first time you are often mistaken as\nto the value of a stone.' Caderousse took from his pocket a small case\nof black shagreen, opened, and gave it to the jeweller. At the sight\nof the diamond, which was as large as a hazel-nut, La Carconte's eyes\nsparkled with cupidity.\"\n\n\"And what did you think of this fine story, eavesdropper?\" said Monte\nCristo; \"did you credit it?\"\n\n\"Yes, your excellency. I did not look on Caderousse as a bad man, and I\nthought him incapable of committing a crime, or even a theft.\"\n\n\"That did more honor to your heart than to your experience, M.\nBertuccio. Had you known this Edmond Dantes, of whom they spoke?\"\n\n\"No, your excellency, I had never heard of him before, and never but\nonce afterwards, and that was from the Abbe Busoni himself, when I saw\nhim in the prison at Nimes.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"The jeweller took the ring, and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel\npliers and a small set of copper scales, he took the stone out of its\nsetting, and weighed it carefully. 'I will give you 45,000,' said he,\n'but not a sou more; besides, as that is the exact value of the stone,\nI brought just that sum with me.'--'Oh, that's no matter,' replied\nCaderousse, 'I will go back with you to fetch the other 5,000\nfrancs.'--'No,' returned the jeweller, giving back the diamond and the\nring to Caderousse--'no, it is worth no more, and I am sorry I offered\nso much, for the stone has a flaw in it, which I had not seen. However,\nI will not go back on my word, and I will give 45,000.'--'At least,\nreplace the diamond in the ring,' said La Carconte sharply.--'Ah, true,'\nreplied the jeweller, and he reset the stone.--'No matter,' observed\nCaderousse, replacing the box in his pocket, 'some one else will\npurchase it.'--'Yes,' continued the jeweller; 'but some one else will\nnot be so easy as I am, or content himself with the same story. It is\nnot natural that a man like you should possess such a diamond. He will\ninform against you. You will have to find the Abbe Busoni; and abbes who\ngive diamonds worth two thousand louis are rare. The law would seize it,\nand put you in prison; if at the end of three or four months you are set\nat liberty, the ring will be lost, or a false stone, worth three francs,\nwill be given you, instead of a diamond worth 50,000 or perhaps 55,000\nfrancs; from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk\nin purchasing.' Caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each\nother.--'No,' said Caderousse, 'we are not rich enough to lose 5,000\nfrancs.'--'As you please, my dear sir,' said the jeweller; 'I had,\nhowever, as you see, brought you the money in bright coin.' And he drew\nfrom his pocket a handful of gold, and held it sparkling before the\ndazzled eyes of the innkeeper, and in the other hand he held a packet of\nbank-notes.\n\n\"There was evidently a severe struggle in the mind of Caderousse; it was\nplain that the small shagreen case, which he turned over and over in\nhis hand, did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous\nsum which fascinated his gaze. He turned towards his wife. 'What do you\nthink of this?' he asked in a low voice.--'Let him have it--let him have\nit,' she said. 'If he returns to Beaucaire without the diamond, he will\ninform against us, and, as he says, who knows if we shall ever again see\nthe Abbe Busoni?--in all probability we shall never see him.'--'Well,\nthen, so I will!' said Caderousse; 'so you may have the diamond for\n45,000 francs. But my wife wants a gold chain, and I want a pair of\nsilver buckles.' The jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box,\nwhich contained several samples of the articles demanded. 'Here,' he\nsaid, 'I am very straightforward in my dealings--take your choice.' The\nwoman selected a gold chain worth about five louis, and the husband a\npair of buckles, worth perhaps fifteen francs.--'I hope you will not\ncomplain now?' said the jeweller.\n\n\"'The abbe told me it was worth 50,000 francs,' muttered Caderousse.\n'Come, come--give it to me! What a strange fellow you are,' said\nthe jeweller, taking the diamond from his hand. 'I give you 45,000\nfrancs--that is, 2,500 livres of income,--a fortune such as I wish I had\nmyself, and you are not satisfied!'--'And the five and forty thousand\nfrancs,' inquired Caderousse in a hoarse voice, 'where are they?\nCome--let us see them.'--'Here they are,' replied the jeweller, and he\ncounted out upon the table 15,000. francs in gold, and 30,000 francs in\nbank-notes.\n\n\"'Wait while I light the lamp,' said La Carconte; 'it is growing dark,\nand there may be some mistake.' In fact, night had come on during this\nconversation, and with night the storm which had been threatening for\nthe last half-hour. The thunder growled in the distance; but it was\napparently not heard by the jeweller, Caderousse, or La Carconte,\nabsorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain. I myself felt; a\nstrange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these\nbank-notes; it seemed to me that I was in a dream, and, as it always\nhappens in a dream, I felt myself riveted to the spot. Caderousse\ncounted and again counted the gold and the notes, then handed them to\nhis wife, who counted and counted them again in her turn. During this\ntime, the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight,\nand the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those\nwhich--precursors of the storm--began to play in at the windows. 'Well,'\ninquired the jeweller, 'is the cash all right?'\n\n\"'Yes,' said Caderousse. 'Give me the pocket-book, La Carconte, and find\na bag somewhere.'\n\n\"La Carconte went to a cupboard, and returned with an old leathern\npocket-book and a bag. From the former she took some greasy letters, and\nput in their place the bank-notes, and from the bag took two or three\ncrowns of six livres each, which, in all probability, formed the entire\nfortune of the miserable couple. 'There,' said Caderousse; 'and now,\nalthough you have wronged us of perhaps 10,000 francs, will you have\nyour supper with us? I invite you with good-will.'--'Thank you,'\nreplied the jeweller, 'it must be getting late, and I must return to\nBeaucaire--my wife will be getting uneasy.' He drew out his watch, and\nexclaimed, 'Morbleu, nearly nine o'clock--why, I shall not get back to\nBeaucaire before midnight! Good-night, my friends. If the Abbe Busoni\nshould by any accident return, think of me.'--'In another week you will\nhave left Beaucaire.' remarked Caderousse, 'for the fair ends in a few\ndays.'--'True, but that makes no difference. Write to me at Paris, to\nM. Joannes, in the Palais Royal, arcade Pierre, No. 45. I will make the\njourney on purpose to see him, if it is worth while.' At this moment\nthere was a tremendous clap of thunder, accompanied by a flash of\nlightning so vivid, that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp.\n\n\"'See here,' exclaimed Caderousse. 'You cannot think of going out in\nsuch weather as this.'--'Oh, I am not afraid of thunder,' said the\njeweller.--'And then there are robbers,' said La Carconte. 'The road\nis never very safe during fair time.'--'Oh, as to the robbers,' said\nJoannes, 'here is something for them,' and he drew from his pocket a\npair of small pistols, loaded to the muzzle. 'Here,' said he, 'are dogs\nwho bark and bite at the same time, they are for the two first who shall\nhave a longing for your diamond, Friend Caderousse.'\n\n\"Caderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning look. It seemed\nas though they were both inspired at the same time with some\nhorrible thought. 'Well, then, a good journey to you,' said\nCaderousse.--'Thanks,' replied the jeweller. He then took his cane,\nwhich he had placed against an old cupboard, and went out. At the moment\nwhen he opened the door, such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was\nnearly extinguished. 'Oh,' said he, 'this is very nice weather, and two\nleagues to go in such a storm.'--'Remain,' said Caderousse. 'You can\nsleep here.'--'Yes; do stay,' added La Carconte in a tremulous voice;\n'we will take every care of you.'--'No; I must sleep at Beaucaire. So,\nonce more, good-night.' Caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold.\n'I can see neither heaven nor earth,' said the jeweller, who was outside\nthe door. 'Do I turn to the right, or to the left hand?'--'To the\nright,' said Caderousse. 'You cannot go wrong--the road is bordered by\ntrees on both sides.'--'Good--all right,' said a voice almost lost in\nthe distance. 'Close the door,' said La Carconte; 'I do not like open\ndoors when it thunders.'--'Particularly when there is money in the\nhouse, eh?' answered Caderousse, double-locking the door.\n\n\"He came into the room, went to the cupboard, took out the bag and\npocket-book, and both began, for the third time, to count their gold and\nbank-notes. I never saw such an expression of cupidity as the flickering\nlamp revealed in those two countenances. The woman, especially,\nwas hideous; her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified, her\ncountenance had become livid, and her eyes resembled burning coals.\n'Why,' she inquired in a hoarse voice, 'did you invite him to sleep here\nto-night?'--'Why?' said Caderousse with a shudder; 'why, that he might\nnot have the trouble of returning to Beaucaire.'--'Ah,' responded the\nwoman, with an expression impossible to describe; 'I thought it was\nfor something else.'--'Woman, woman--why do you have such ideas?'\ncried Caderousse; 'or, if you have them, why don't you keep them to\nyourself?'--'Well,' said La Carconte, after a moment's pause, 'you are\nnot a man.'--'What do you mean?' added Caderousse.--'If you had been a\nman, you would not have let him go from here.'--'Woman!'--'Or else\nhe should not have reached Beaucaire.'--'Woman!'--'The road takes a\nturn--he is obliged to follow it--while alongside of the canal there is\na shorter road.'--'Woman!--you offend the good God. There--listen!' And\nat this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder, while the livid\nlightning illumined the room, and the thunder, rolling away in the\ndistance, seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode. 'Mercy!'\nsaid Caderousse, crossing himself.\n\n\"At the same moment, and in the midst of the terrifying silence which\nusually follows a clap of thunder, they heard a knocking at the door.\nCaderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other. 'Who's\nthere?' cried Caderousse, rising, and drawing up in a heap the gold\nand notes scattered over the table, and which he covered with his two\nhands.--'It is I,' shouted a voice.--'And who are you?'--'Eh, pardieu,\nJoannes, the jeweller.'--'Well, and you said I offended the good God,'\nsaid La Carconte with a horrid smile. 'Why, the good God sends him back\nagain.' Caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair. La Carconte,\non the contrary, rose, and going with a firm step towards the door,\nopened it, saying, as she did so--'Come in, dear M. Joannes.'--'Ma foi,'\nsaid the jeweller, drenched with rain, 'I am not destined to return to\nBeaucaire to-night. The shortest follies are best, my dear Caderousse.\nYou offered me hospitality, and I accept it, and have returned to sleep\nbeneath your friendly roof.' Caderousse stammered out something,\nwhile he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow. La Carconte\ndouble-locked the door behind the jeweller.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 45. The Rain of Blood.\n\n\"As the jeweller returned to the apartment, he cast around him a\nscrutinizing glance--but there was nothing to excite suspicion, if\nit did not exist, or to confirm it, if it were already awakened.\nCaderousse's hands still grasped the gold and bank-notes, and La\nCarconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance\nof their guest. 'Well, well,' said the jeweller, 'you seem, my good\nfriends, to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money,\nby counting it over so carefully directly I was gone.'--'Oh, no,'\nanswered Caderousse, 'that was not my reason, I can assure you; but the\ncircumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so\nunexpected, as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune, and it is\nonly by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that\nwe can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream.' The\njeweller smiled.--'Have you any other guests in your house?' inquired\nhe.--'Nobody but ourselves,' replied Caderousse; 'the fact is, we do not\nlodge travellers--indeed, our tavern is so near the town, that nobody\nwould think of stopping here.'--'Then I am afraid I shall very much\ninconvenience you.'--'Inconvenience us? Not at all, my dear sir,'\nsaid La Carconte in her most gracious manner. 'Not at all, I assure\nyou.'--'But where will you manage to stow me?'--'In the chamber\noverhead.'--'Surely that is where you yourselves sleep?'--'Never mind\nthat; we have a second bed in the adjoining room.' Caderousse stared at\nhis wife with much astonishment.\n\n\"The jeweller, meanwhile, was humming a song as he stood warming his\nback at the fire La Carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her\nguest; and this done, she next occupied herself in arranging his supper,\nby spreading a napkin at the end of the table, and placing on it the\nslender remains of their dinner, to which she added three or four\nfresh-laid eggs. Caderousse had once more parted with his treasure--the\nbanknotes were replaced in the pocket-book, the gold put back into\nthe bag, and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard. He then began\npacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air, glancing from time to\ntime at the jeweller, who stood reeking with the steam from his wet\nclothes, and merely changing his place on the warm hearth, to enable the\nwhole of his garments to be dried.\n\n\"'There,' said La Carconte, as she placed a bottle of wine on the table,\n'supper is ready whenever you are.'--'And you?' asked Joannes.--'I don't\nwant any supper,' said Caderousse.--'We dined so very late,' hastily\ninterposed La Carconte.--'Then it seems I am to eat alone,' remarked\nthe jeweller.--'Oh, we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you,'\nanswered La Carconte, with an eager attention she was not accustomed to\nmanifest even to guests who paid for what they took.\n\n\"From time to time Caderousse darted on his wife keen, searching\nglances, but rapid as the lightning flash. The storm still continued.\n'There, there,' said La Carconte; 'do you hear that? upon my word, you\ndid well to come back.'--'Nevertheless,' replied the jeweller, 'if by\nthe time I have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated, I\nshall make another start.'--'It's the mistral,' said Caderousse, 'and\nit will be sure to last till to-morrow morning.' He sighed\nheavily.--'Well,' said the jeweller, as he placed himself at table,\n'all I can say is, so much the worse for those who are abroad.'--'Yes,'\nchimed in La Carconte, 'they will have a wretched night of it.'\n\n\"The jeweller began eating his supper, and the woman, who was ordinarily\nso querulous and indifferent to all who approached her, was suddenly\ntransformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess. Had the unhappy\nman on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with\nher, so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his\nmind, or at least have greatly astonished him. Caderousse, meanwhile,\ncontinued to pace the room in gloomy silence, sedulously avoiding\nthe sight of his guest; but as soon as the stranger had completed his\nrepast, the agitated inn-keeper went eagerly to the door and opened\nit. 'I believe the storm is over,' said he. But as if to contradict his\nstatement, at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the\nhouse to its very foundation, while a sudden gust of wind, mingled\nwith rain, extinguished the lamp he held in his hand. Trembling and\nawe-struck, Caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his\nguest, while La Carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that\nglimmered on the hearth. 'You must be tired,' said she to the jeweller;\n'I have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed; go up when you are\nready, and sleep well.'\n\n\"Joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in\nits fury, but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that,\ninstead of diminishing, the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily\nincreased; resigning himself, therefore, to what seemed inevitable, he\nbade his host good-night, and mounted the stairs. He passed over my head\nand I heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps. The quick, eager\nglance of La Carconte followed him as he ascended, while Caderousse, on\nthe contrary, turned his back, and seemed most anxiously to avoid even\nglancing at him.\n\n\"All these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as\nthey have since done; in fact, all that had happened (with the exception\nof the story of the diamond, which certainly did wear an air of\nimprobability), appeared natural enough, and called for neither\napprehension nor mistrust; but, worn out as I was with fatigue, and\nfully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated, I\ndetermined to obtain a few hours' sleep. Overhead I could accurately\ndistinguish every movement of the jeweller, who, after making the best\narrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night, threw himself\non his bed, and I could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight.\nInsensibly my eyelids grew heavy, deep sleep stole over me, and having\nno suspicion of anything wrong, I sought not to shake it off. I looked\ninto the kitchen once more and saw Caderousse sitting by the side of a\nlong table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are\nfrequently used instead of chairs; his back was turned towards me, so\nthat I could not see the expression of his countenance--neither should I\nhave been able to do so had he been placed differently, as his head was\nburied between his two hands. La Carconte continued to gaze on him for\nsome time, then shrugging her shoulders, she took her seat immediately\nopposite to him. At this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh\nflame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near, and a bright\nlight flashed over the room. La Carconte still kept her eyes fixed\non her husband, but as he made no sign of changing his position, she\nextended her hard, bony hand, and touched him on the forehead.\n\n\"Caderousse shuddered. The woman's lips seemed to move, as though she\nwere talking; but because she merely spoke in an undertone, or my senses\nwere dulled by sleep, I did not catch a word she uttered. Confused\nsights and sounds seemed to float before me, and gradually I fell into\na deep, heavy slumber. How long I had been in this unconscious state\nI know not, when I was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol,\nfollowed by a fearful cry. Weak and tottering footsteps resounded across\nthe chamber above me, and the next instant a dull, heavy weight seemed\nto fall powerless on the staircase. I had not yet fully recovered\nconsciousness, when again I heard groans, mingled with half-stifled\ncries, as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle. A cry more\nprolonged than the others and ending in a series of groans effectually\nroused me from my drowsy lethargy. Hastily raising myself on one arm, I\nlooked around, but all was dark; and it seemed to me as if the rain must\nhave penetrated through the flooring of the room above, for some kind\nof moisture appeared to fall, drop by drop, upon my forehead, and when I\npassed my hand across my brow, I felt that it was wet and clammy.\n\n\"To the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most\nperfect silence--unbroken, save by the footsteps of a man walking about\nin the chamber above. The staircase creaked, he descended into the room\nbelow, approached the fire and lit a candle. The man was Caderousse--he\nwas pale and his shirt was all bloody. Having obtained the light, he\nhurried up-stairs again, and once more I heard his rapid and uneasy\nfootsteps. A moment later he came down again, holding in his hand the\nsmall shagreen case, which he opened, to assure himself it contained\nthe diamond,--seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it\nin, then, as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket, he\ndeposited it in his red handkerchief, which he carefully rolled round\nhis head. After this he took from his cupboard the bank-notes and gold\nhe had put there, thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers, and\nthe other into that of his waistcoat, hastily tied up a small bundle of\nlinen, and rushing towards the door, disappeared in the darkness of the\nnight.\n\n\"Then all became clear and manifest to me, and I reproached myself\nwith what had happened, as though I myself had done the guilty deed.\nI fancied that I still heard faint moans, and imagining that the\nunfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead, I determined to go to his\nrelief, by way of atoning in some slight degree, not for the crime I had\ncommitted, but for that which I had not endeavored to prevent. For this\npurpose I applied all the strength I possessed to force an entrance\nfrom the cramped spot in which I lay to the adjoining room. The poorly\nfastened boards which alone divided me from it yielded to my efforts,\nand I found myself in the house. Hastily snatching up the lighted\ncandle, I hurried to the staircase; about midway a body was lying quite\nacross the stairs. It was that of La Carconte. The pistol I had heard\nhad doubtless been fired at her. The shot had frightfully lacerated her\nthroat, leaving two gaping wounds from which, as well as the mouth, the\nblood was pouring in floods. She was stone dead. I strode past her, and\nascended to the sleeping chamber, which presented an appearance of the\nwildest disorder. The furniture had been knocked over in the deadly\nstruggle that had taken place there, and the sheets, to which the\nunfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung, were dragged across the room.\nThe murdered man lay on the floor, his head leaning against the wall,\nand about him was a pool of blood which poured forth from three large\nwounds in his breast; there was a fourth gash, in which a long table\nknife was plunged up to the handle.\n\n\"I stumbled over some object; I stooped to examine--it was the second\npistol, which had not gone off, probably from the powder being wet. I\napproached the jeweller, who was not quite dead, and at the sound of my\nfootsteps and the creaking of the floor, he opened his eyes, fixed\nthem on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze, moved his lips as though\ntrying to speak, then, overcome by the effort, fell back and expired.\nThis appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses, and finding that I\ncould no longer be of service to any one in the house, my only desire\nwas to fly. I rushed towards the staircase, clutching my hair, and\nuttering a groan of horror. Upon reaching the room below, I found five\nor six custom-house officers, and two or three gendarmes--all heavily\narmed. They threw themselves upon me. I made no resistance; I was no\nlonger master of my senses. When I strove to speak, a few inarticulate\nsounds alone escaped my lips.\n\n\"As I noticed the significant manner in which the whole party pointed to\nmy blood-stained garments, I involuntarily surveyed myself, and then\nI discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as I lay\nbeneath the staircase must have been the blood of La Carconte. I pointed\nto the spot where I had concealed myself. 'What does he mean?' asked a\ngendarme. One of the officers went to the place I directed. 'He means,'\nreplied the man upon his return, 'that he got in that way;' and he\nshowed the hole I had made when I broke through.\n\n\"Then I saw that they took me for the assassin. I recovered force and\nenergy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me, while\nI managed to stammer forth--'I did not do it! Indeed, indeed I did not!'\nA couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my\nbreast.--'Stir but a step,' said they, 'and you are a dead man.'--'Why\nshould you threaten me with death,' cried I, 'when I have already\ndeclared my innocence?'--'Tush, tush,' cried the men; 'keep your\ninnocent stories to tell to the judge at Nimes. Meanwhile, come along\nwith us; and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly.'\nAlas, resistance was far from my thoughts. I was utterly overpowered\nby surprise and terror; and without a word I suffered myself to be\nhandcuffed and tied to a horse's tail, and thus they took me to Nimes.\n\n\"I had been tracked by a customs-officer, who had lost sight of me near\nthe tavern; feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there, he\nhad returned to summon his comrades, who just arrived in time to\nhear the report of the pistol, and to take me in the midst of such\ncircumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving\nmy innocence utterly futile. One only chance was left me, that of\nbeseeching the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every inquiry\nto be made for the Abbe Busoni, who had stopped at the inn of the Pont\ndu Gard on that morning. If Caderousse had invented the story relative\nto the diamond, and there existed no such person as the Abbe Busoni,\nthen, indeed, I was lost past redemption, or, at least, my life hung\nupon the feeble chance of Caderousse himself being apprehended\nand confessing the whole truth. Two months passed away in hopeless\nexpectation on my part, while I must do the magistrate the justice\nto say that he used every means to obtain information of the person I\ndeclared could exculpate me if he would. Caderousse still evaded all\npursuit, and I had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate.\nMy trial was to come on at the approaching assizes; when, on the 8th of\nSeptember--that is to say, precisely three months and five days after\nthe events which had perilled my life--the Abbe Busoni, whom I never\nventured to believe I should see, presented himself at the prison doors,\nsaying he understood one of the prisoners wished to speak to him;\nhe added, that having learned at Marseilles the particulars of my\nimprisonment, he hastened to comply with my desire. You may easily\nimagine with what eagerness I welcomed him, and how minutely I\nrelated the whole of what I had seen and heard. I felt some degree of\nnervousness as I entered upon the history of the diamond, but, to my\ninexpressible astonishment, he confirmed it in every particular, and to\nmy equal surprise, he seemed to place entire belief in all I said. And\nthen it was that, won by his mild charity, seeing that he was acquainted\nwith all the habits and customs of my own country, and considering also\nthat pardon for the only crime of which I was really guilty might come\nwith a double power from lips so benevolent and kind, I besought him to\nreceive my confession, under the seal of which I recounted the Auteuil\naffair in all its details, as well as every other transaction of my\nlife. That which I had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced\nthe same effect as though it had been the result of calculation. My\nvoluntary confession of the assassination at Auteuil proved to him that\nI had not committed that of which I stood accused. When he quitted me,\nhe bade me be of good courage, and to rely upon his doing all in his\npower to convince my judges of my innocence.\n\n\"I had speedy proofs that the excellent abbe was engaged in my behalf,\nfor the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling\nthough acceptable indulgences, and I was told that my trial was to be\npostponed to the assizes following those now being held. In the interim\nit pleased providence to cause the apprehension of Caderousse, who was\ndiscovered in some distant country, and brought back to France, where he\nmade a full confession, refusing to make the fact of his wife's having\nsuggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt.\nThe wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life, and I was\nimmediately set at liberty.\"\n\n\"And then it was, I presume,\" said Monte Cristo \"that you came to me as\nthe bearer of a letter from the Abbe Busoni?\"\n\n\"It was, your excellency; the benevolent abbe took an evident interest\nin all that concerned me.\n\n\"'Your mode of life as a smuggler,' said he to me one day, 'will be\nthe ruin of you; if you get out, don't take it up again.'--'But how,'\ninquired I, 'am I to maintain myself and my poor sister?'\n\n\"'A person, whose confessor I am,' replied he, 'and who entertains a\nhigh regard for me, applied to me a short time since to procure him a\nconfidential servant. Would you like such a post? If so, I will give you\na letter of introduction to him.'--'Oh, father,' I exclaimed, 'you are\nvery good.'\n\n\"'But you must swear solemnly that I shall never have reason to repent\nmy recommendation.' I extended my hand, and was about to pledge myself\nby any promise he would dictate, but he stopped me. 'It is unnecessary\nfor you to bind yourself by any vow,' said he; 'I know and admire the\nCorsican nature too well to fear you. Here, take this,' continued he,\nafter rapidly writing the few lines I brought to your excellency, and\nupon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your service,\nand proudly I ask whether your excellency has ever had cause to repent\nhaving done so?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the count; \"I take pleasure in saying that you have served\nme faithfully, Bertuccio; but you might have shown more confidence in\nme.\"\n\n\"I, your excellency?\"\n\n\"Yes; you. How comes it, that having both a sister and an adopted son,\nyou have never spoken to me of either?\"\n\n\"Alas, I have still to recount the most distressing period of my life.\nAnxious as you may suppose I was to behold and comfort my dear sister,\nI lost no time in hastening to Corsica, but when I arrived at Rogliano I\nfound a house of mourning, the consequences of a scene so horrible that\nthe neighbors remember and speak of it to this day. Acting by my advice,\nmy poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of\nBenedetto, who was continually tormenting her for money, as long as he\nbelieved there was a sou left in her possession. One morning that he had\ndemanded money, threatening her with the severest consequences if she\ndid not supply him with what he desired, he disappeared and remained\naway all day, leaving the kind-hearted Assunta, who loved him as if he\nwere her own child, to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence.\nEvening came, and still, with all the patient solicitude of a mother,\nshe watched for his return.\n\n\"As the eleventh hour struck, he entered with a swaggering air, attended\nby two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions. She\nstretched out her arms to him, but they seized hold of her, and one of\nthe three--none other than the accursed Benedetto exclaimed,--'Put her\nto torture and she'll soon tell us where her money is.'\n\n\"It unfortunately happened that our neighbor, Vasilio, was at Bastia,\nleaving no person in his house but his wife; no human creature beside\ncould hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling. Two held\npoor Assunta, who, unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her,\nsmiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners.\nThe third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows, then returned,\nand the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the\nsight of these preparations, and then dragged Assunta feet foremost\ntowards the brazier, expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her\nsupposed treasure was secreted. In the struggle her clothes caught\nfire, and they were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve\nthemselves from sharing the same fate. Covered with flames, Assunta\nrushed wildly to the door, but it was fastened; she flew to the windows,\nbut they were also secured; then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks;\nit was Assunta calling for help. The cries died away in groans, and next\nmorning, as soon as Vasilio's wife could muster up courage to venture\nabroad, she caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public\nauthorities, when Assunta, although dreadfully burnt, was found still\nbreathing; every drawer and closet in the house had been forced open,\nand the money stolen. Benedetto never again appeared at Rogliano,\nneither have I since that day either seen or heard anything concerning\nhim.\n\n\"It was subsequently to these dreadful events that I waited on\nyour excellency, to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned\nBenedetto, since all trace of him seemed entirely lost; or of my sister,\nsince she was dead.\"\n\n\"And in what light did you view the occurrence?\" inquired Monte Cristo.\n\n\"As a punishment for the crime I had committed,\" answered Bertuccio.\n\"Oh, those Villeforts are an accursed race!\"\n\n\"Truly they are,\" murmured the count in a lugubrious tone.\n\n\"And now,\" resumed Bertuccio, \"your excellency may, perhaps, be able\nto comprehend that this place, which I revisit for the first time--this\ngarden, the actual scene of my crime--must have given rise to\nreflections of no very agreeable nature, and produced that gloom and\ndepression of spirits which excited the notice of your excellency, who\nwas pleased to express a desire to know the cause. At this instant a\nshudder passes over me as I reflect that possibly I am now standing on\nthe very grave in which lies M. de Villefort, by whose hand the ground\nwas dug to receive the corpse of his child.\"\n\n\"Everything is possible,\" said Monte Cristo, rising from the bench on\nwhich he had been sitting; \"even,\" he added in an inaudible voice, \"even\nthat the procureur be not dead. The Abbe Busoni did right to send you\nto me,\" he went on in his ordinary tone, \"and you have done well in\nrelating to me the whole of your history, as it will prevent my forming\nany erroneous opinions concerning you in future. As for that Benedetto,\nwho so grossly belied his name, have you never made any effort to trace\nout whither he has gone, or what has become of him?\"\n\n\"No; far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself, I should\nshun the possibility of meeting him as I would a wild beast. Thank God,\nI have never heard his name mentioned by any person, and I hope and\nbelieve he is dead.\"\n\n\"Do not think so, Bertuccio,\" replied the count; \"for the wicked are\nnot so easily disposed of, for God seems to have them under his special\nwatch-care to make of them instruments of his vengeance.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" responded Bertuccio, \"all I ask of heaven is that I may\nnever see him again. And now, your excellency,\" he added, bowing his\nhead, \"you know everything--you are my judge on earth, as the Almighty\nis in heaven; have you for me no words of consolation?\"\n\n\"My good friend, I can only repeat the words addressed to you by the\nAbbe Busoni. Villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you,\nand, perhaps, to others. Benedetto, if still living, will become the\ninstrument of divine retribution in some way or other, and then be duly\npunished in his turn. As far as you yourself are concerned, I see but\none point in which you are really guilty. Ask yourself, wherefore, after\nrescuing the infant from its living grave, you did not restore it to its\nmother? There was the crime, Bertuccio--that was where you became really\nculpable.\"\n\n\"True, excellency, that was the crime, the real crime, for in that\nI acted like a coward. My first duty, directly I had succeeded in\nrecalling the babe to life, was to restore it to its mother; but, in\norder to do so, I must have made close and careful inquiry, which would,\nin all probability, have led to my own apprehension; and I clung to\nlife, partly on my sister's account, and partly from that feeling\nof pride inborn in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and\nvictorious in the execution of our vengeance. Perhaps, too, the natural\nand instinctive love of life made me wish to avoid endangering my\nown. And then, again, I am not as brave and courageous as was my poor\nbrother.\" Bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words,\nwhile Monte Cristo fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning. After\na brief silence, rendered still more solemn by the time and place, the\ncount said, in a tone of melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner, \"In\norder to bring this conversation to a fitting termination (the last we\nshall ever hold upon this subject), I will repeat to you some words I\nhave heard from the lips of the Abbe Busoni. For all evils there are\ntwo remedies--time and silence. And now leave me, Monsieur Bertuccio, to\nwalk alone here in the garden. The very circumstances which inflict\non you, as a principal in the tragic scene enacted here, such painful\nemotions, are to me, on the contrary, a source of something like\ncontentment, and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my\nestimation. The chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of\ntheir umbrageous boughs, while fancy pictures a moving multitude of\nshapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade. Here I have\na garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the\nimagination, and furnished with thickly grown trees, beneath whose leafy\nscreen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will. This to\nme, who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight\nwall, is, I assure you, a most agreeable surprise. I have no fear of\nghosts, and I have never heard it said that so much harm had been done\nby the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a\nsingle day. Retire within, Bertuccio, and tranquillize your mind. Should\nyour confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you\nfound the Abbe Busoni, send for me, if I am still on earth, and I will\nsoothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your\nparting soul ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity.\"\n\nBertuccio bowed respectfully, and turned away, sighing heavily. Monte\nCristo, left alone, took three or four steps onwards, and murmured,\n\"Here, beneath this plane-tree, must have been where the infant's grave\nwas dug. There is the little door opening into the garden. At this\ncorner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping\napartment. There will be no necessity for me to make a note of these\nparticulars, for there, before my eyes, beneath my feet, all around me,\nI have the plan sketched with all the living reality of truth.\" After\nmaking the tour of the garden a second time, the count re-entered his\ncarriage, while Bertuccio, who perceived the thoughtful expression of\nhis master's features, took his seat beside the driver without uttering\na word. The carriage proceeded rapidly towards Paris.\n\nThat same evening, upon reaching his abode in the Champs Elysees, the\nCount of Monte Cristo went over the whole building with the air of one\nlong acquainted with each nook or corner. Nor, although preceding the\nparty, did he once mistake one door for another, or commit the smallest\nerror when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him\nto a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit. Ali was his principal\nattendant during this nocturnal survey. Having given various orders to\nBertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired\nto make in the house, the Count, drawing out his watch, said to the\nattentive Nubian, \"It is half-past eleven o'clock; Haidee will soon be\nhere. Have the French attendants been summoned to await her coming?\" Ali\nextended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair Greek,\nwhich were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance,\nthat it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their\nexistence. Ali, having pointed to the apartments, held up three fingers\nof his right hand, and then, placing it beneath his head, shut his eyes,\nand feigned to sleep. \"I understand,\" said Monte Cristo, well acquainted\nwith Ali's pantomime; \"you mean to tell me that three female\nattendants await their new mistress in her sleeping-chamber.\" Ali, with\nconsiderable animation, made a sign in the affirmative.\n\n\"Madame will be tired to-night,\" continued Monte Cristo, \"and will, no\ndoubt, wish to rest. Desire the French attendants not to weary her with\nquestions, but merely to pay their respectful duty and retire. You will\nalso see that the Greek servants hold no communication with those of\nthis country.\" He bowed. Just at that moment voices were heard hailing\nthe concierge. The gate opened, a carriage rolled down the avenue, and\nstopped at the steps. The count hastily descended, presented himself\nat the already opened carriage door, and held out his hand to a young\nwoman, completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered\nwith gold. She raised the hand extended towards her to her lips, and\nkissed it with a mixture of love and respect. Some few words passed\nbetween them in that sonorous language in which Homer makes his gods\nconverse. The young woman spoke with an expression of deep tenderness,\nwhile the count replied with an air of gentle gravity. Preceded by Ali,\nwho carried a rose-colored flambeau in his hand, the new-comer, who was\nno other than the lovely Greek who had been Monte Cristo's companion in\nItaly, was conducted to her apartments, while the count retired to the\npavilion reserved for himself. In another hour every light in the house\nwas extinguished, and it might have been thought that all its inmates\nslept.\n\n\n\nChapter 46. Unlimited Credit.\n\nAbout two o'clock the following day a calash, drawn by a pair of\nmagnificent English horses, stopped at the door of Monte Cristo and a\nperson, dressed in a blue coat, with buttons of a similar color, a\nwhite waistcoat, over which was displayed a massive gold chain, brown\ntrousers, and a quantity of black hair descending so low over his\neyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so\nlittle did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles\nstamped on his features--a person, in a word, who, although evidently\npast fifty, desired to be taken for not more than forty, bent forwards\nfrom the carriage door, on the panels of which were emblazoned the\narmorial bearings of a baron, and directed his groom to inquire at the\nporter's lodge whether the Count of Monte Cristo resided there, and if\nhe were within. While waiting, the occupant of the carriage surveyed the\nhouse, the garden as far as he could distinguish it, and the livery\nof servants who passed to and fro, with an attention so close as to be\nsomewhat impertinent. His glance was keen but showed cunning rather than\nintelligence; his lips were straight, and so thin that, as they closed,\nthey were drawn in over the teeth; his cheek-bones were broad and\nprojecting, a never-failing proof of audacity and craftiness; while the\nflatness of his forehead, and the enlargement of the back of his skull,\nwhich rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears, combined\nto form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing, save in the eyes of\nsuch as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs\nbe all that was admirable and enviable, more especially when they gazed\non the enormous diamond that glittered in his shirt, and the red ribbon\nthat depended from his button-hole.\n\nThe groom, in obedience to his orders, tapped at the window of the\nporter's lodge, saying, \"Pray, does not the Count of Monte Cristo live\nhere?\"\n\n\"His excellency does reside here,\" replied the concierge; \"but\"--added\nhe, glancing an inquiring look at Ali. Ali returned a sign in the\nnegative. \"But what?\" asked the groom.\n\n\"His excellency does not receive visitors to-day.\"\n\n\"Then here is my master's card,--the Baron Danglars. You will take it\nto the count, and say that, although in haste to attend the Chamber, my\nmaster came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon him.\"\n\n\"I never speak to his excellency,\" replied the concierge; \"the valet de\nchambre will carry your message.\" The groom returned to the carriage.\n\"Well?\" asked Danglars. The man, somewhat crest-fallen by the rebuke he\nhad received, repeated what the concierge had said. \"Bless me,\" murmured\nBaron Danglars, \"this must surely be a prince instead of a count by\ntheir styling him 'excellency,' and only venturing to address him by the\nmedium of his valet de chambre. However, it does not signify; he has a\nletter of credit on me, so I must see him when he requires his money.\"\n\nThen, throwing himself back in his carriage, Danglars called out to\nhis coachman, in a voice that might be heard across the road, \"To the\nChamber of Deputies.\"\n\nApprised in time of the visit paid him, Monte Cristo had, from behind\nthe blinds of his pavilion, as minutely observed the baron, by means of\nan excellent lorgnette, as Danglars himself had scrutinized the house,\ngarden, and servants. \"That fellow has a decidedly bad countenance,\"\nsaid the count in a tone of disgust, as he shut up his glass into its\nivory case. \"How comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at sight\nof that flat, receding, serpent-like forehead, round, vulture-shaped\nhead, and sharp-hooked nose, like the beak of a buzzard? Ali,\" cried\nhe, striking at the same time on the brazen gong. Ali appeared. \"Summon\nBertuccio,\" said the count. Almost immediately Bertuccio entered the\napartment. \"Did your excellency desire to see me?\" inquired he. \"I did,\"\nreplied the count. \"You no doubt observed the horses standing a few\nminutes since at the door?\"\n\n\"Certainly, your excellency. I noticed them for their remarkable\nbeauty.\"\n\n\"Then how comes it,\" said Monte Cristo with a frown, \"that, when I\ndesired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be found in\nParis, there is another pair, fully as fine as mine, not in my stables?\"\nAt the look of displeasure, added to the angry tone in which the count\nspoke, Ali turned pale and held down his head. \"It is not your fault, my\ngood Ali,\" said the count in the Arabic language, and with a gentleness\nnone would have thought him capable of showing, either in voice or\nface--\"it is not your fault. You do not understand the points of English\nhorses.\" The countenance of poor Ali recovered its serenity. \"Permit me\nto assure your excellency,\" said Bertuccio, \"that the horses you speak\nof were not to be sold when I purchased yours.\" Monte Cristo shrugged\nhis shoulders. \"It seems, sir steward,\" said he, \"that you have yet to\nlearn that all things are to be sold to such as care to pay the price.\"\n\n\"His excellency is not, perhaps, aware that M. Danglars gave 16,000\nfrancs for his horses?\"\n\n\"Very well. Then offer him double that sum; a banker never loses an\nopportunity of doubling his capital.\"\n\n\"Is your excellency really in earnest?\" inquired the steward. Monte\nCristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with\nthe look of one equally surprised and displeased. \"I have to pay a visit\nthis evening,\" replied he. \"I desire that these horses, with completely\nnew harness, may be at the door with my carriage.\" Bertuccio bowed, and\nwas about to retire; but when he reached the door, he paused, and then\nsaid, \"At what o'clock does your excellency wish the carriage and horses\nto be ready?\"\n\n\"At five o'clock,\" replied the count.\n\n\"I beg your excellency's pardon,\" interposed the steward in a\ndeprecating manner, \"for venturing to observe that it is already two\no'clock.\"\n\n\"I am perfectly aware of that fact,\" answered Monte Cristo calmly. Then,\nturning towards Ali, he said, \"Let all the horses in my stables be led\nbefore the windows of your young lady, that she may select those she\nprefers for her carriage. Request her also to oblige me by saying\nwhether it is her pleasure to dine with me; if so, let dinner be served\nin her apartments. Now, leave me, and desire my valet de chambre to\ncome hither.\" Scarcely had Ali disappeared when the valet entered the\nchamber. \"Monsieur Baptistin,\" said the count, \"you have been in my\nservice one year, the time I generally give myself to judge of the\nmerits or demerits of those about me. You suit me very well.\" Baptistin\nbowed low. \"It only remains for me to know whether I also suit you?\"\n\n\"Oh, your excellency!\" exclaimed Baptistin eagerly.\n\n\"Listen, if you please, till I have finished speaking,\" replied Monte\nCristo. \"You receive 1,500 francs per annum for your services here--more\nthan many a brave subaltern, who continually risks his life for his\ncountry, obtains. You live in a manner far superior to many clerks who\nwork ten times harder than you do for their money. Then, though yourself\na servant, you have other servants to wait upon you, take care of your\nclothes, and see that your linen is duly prepared for you. Again, you\nmake a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet, amounting in\nthe course of a year to a sum equalling your wages.\"\n\n\"Nay, indeed, your excellency.\"\n\n\"I am not condemning you for this, Monsieur Baptistin; but let your\nprofits end here. It would be long indeed ere you would find so\nlucrative a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill. I\nneither ill-use nor ill-treat my servants by word or action. An error\nI readily forgive, but wilful negligence or forgetfulness, never. My\ncommands are ordinarily short, clear, and precise; and I would rather be\nobliged to repeat my words twice, or even three times, than they should\nbe misunderstood. I am rich enough to know whatever I desire to know,\nand I can promise you I am not wanting in curiosity. If, then, I\nshould learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to any one\nfavorably or unfavorably, to comment on my actions, or watch my conduct,\nthat very instant you would quit my service. You may now retire. I never\ncaution my servants a second time--remember that.\" Baptistin bowed, and\nwas proceeding towards the door. \"I forgot to mention to you,\" said the\ncount, \"that I lay yearly aside a certain sum for each servant in my\nestablishment; those whom I am compelled to dismiss lose (as a matter of\ncourse) all participation in this money, while their portion goes to the\nfund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me, and among whom\nit will be divided at my death. You have been in my service a year, your\nfund has already begun to accumulate--let it continue to do so.\"\n\nThis address, delivered in the presence of Ali, who, not understanding\none word of the language in which it was spoken, stood wholly unmoved,\nproduced an effect on M. Baptistin only to be conceived by such as have\noccasion to study the character and disposition of French domestics. \"I\nassure your excellency,\" said he, \"that at least it shall be my study\nto merit your approbation in all things, and I will take M. Ali as my\nmodel.\"\n\n\"By no means,\" replied the count in the most frigid tones; \"Ali has many\nfaults mixed with most excellent qualities. He cannot possibly serve you\nas a pattern for your conduct, not being, as you are, a paid servant,\nbut a mere slave--a dog, who, should he fail in his duty towards me, I\nshould not discharge from my service, but kill.\" Baptistin opened his\neyes with astonishment.\n\n\"You seem incredulous,\" said Monte Cristo, who repeated to Ali in the\nArabic language what he had just been saying to Baptistin in French. The\nNubian smiled assentingly to his master's words, then, kneeling on one\nknee, respectfully kissed the hand of the count. This corroboration of\nthe lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder\nand stupefaction of M. Baptistin. The count then motioned the valet\nde chambre to retire, and to Ali to follow to his study, where they\nconversed long and earnestly together. As the hand of the clock pointed\nto five the count struck thrice upon his gong. When Ali was wanted\none stroke was given, two summoned Baptistin, and three Bertuccio. The\nsteward entered. \"My horses,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"They are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency\ndesired. Does your excellency wish me to accompany him?\"\n\n\"No, the coachman, Ali, and Baptistin will go.\" The count descended to\nthe door of his mansion, and beheld his carriage drawn by the very\npair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property\nof Danglars. As he passed them he said--\"They are extremely handsome\ncertainly, and you have done well to purchase them, although you were\nsomewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner.\"\n\n\"Indeed, your excellency, I had very considerable difficulty in\nobtaining them, and, as it is, they have cost an enormous price.\"\n\n\"Does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful,\"\ninquired the count, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\"Nay, if your excellency is satisfied, it is all that I could wish.\nWhither does your excellency desire to be driven?\"\n\n\"To the residence of Baron Danglars, Rue de la Chaussee d'Antin.\" This\nconversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace, from which a\nflight of stone steps led to the carriage-drive. As Bertuccio, with\na respectful bow, was moving away, the count called him back. \"I have\nanother commission for you, M. Bertuccio,\" said he; \"I am desirous of\nhaving an estate by the seaside in Normandy--for instance, between Havre\nand Boulogne. You see I give you a wide range. It will be absolutely\nnecessary that the place you may select have a small harbor, creek, or\nbay, into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor. She draws\nonly fifteen feet. She must be kept in constant readiness to sail\nimmediately I think proper to give the signal. Make the requisite\ninquiries for a place of this description, and when you have met with\nan eligible spot, visit it, and if it possess the advantages desired,\npurchase it at once in your own name. The corvette must now, I think, be\non her way to Fecamp, must she not?\"\n\n\"Certainly, your excellency; I saw her put to sea the same evening we\nquitted Marseilles.\"\n\n\"And the yacht.\"\n\n\"Was ordered to remain at Martigues.\"\n\n\"'Tis well. I wish you to write from time to time to the captains in\ncharge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert.\"\n\n\"And the steamboat?\"\n\n\"She is at Chalons?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels.\"\n\n\"Very good.\"\n\n\"When you have purchased the estate I desire, I want constant relays of\nhorses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road.\"\n\n\"Your excellency may depend upon me.\" The Count made a gesture of\nsatisfaction, descended the terrace steps, and sprang into his carriage,\nwhich was whirled along swiftly to the banker's house. Danglars was\nengaged at that moment, presiding over a railroad committee. But the\nmeeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was announced.\nAs the count's title sounded on his ear he rose, and addressing\nhis colleagues, who were members of one or the other Chamber, he\nsaid,--\"Gentlemen, pardon me for leaving you so abruptly; but a most\nridiculous circumstance has occurred, which is this,--Thomson & French,\nthe Roman bankers, have sent to me a certain person calling himself the\nCount of Monte Cristo, and have given him an unlimited credit with me. I\nconfess this is the drollest thing I have ever met with in the course\nof my extensive foreign transactions, and you may readily suppose it has\ngreatly roused my curiosity. I took the trouble this morning to call\non the pretended count--if he were a real count he wouldn't be so rich.\nBut, would you believe it, 'He was not receiving.' So the master of\nMonte Cristo gives himself airs befitting a great millionaire or a\ncapricious beauty. I made inquiries, and found that the house in the\nChamps Elysees is his own property, and certainly it was very decently\nkept up. But,\" pursued Danglars with one of his sinister smiles, \"an\norder for unlimited credit calls for something like caution on the part\nof the banker to whom that order is given. I am very anxious to see this\nman. I suspect a hoax is intended, but the instigators of it little knew\nwhom they had to deal with. 'They laugh best who laugh last!'\"\n\nHaving delivered himself of this pompous address, uttered with a degree\nof energy that left the baron almost out of breath, he bowed to the\nassembled party and withdrew to his drawing-room, whose sumptuous\nfurnishings of white and gold had caused a great sensation in the\nChaussee d'Antin. It was to this apartment he had desired his guest to\nbe shown, with the purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much\nluxury. He found the count standing before some copies of Albano and\nFattore that had been passed off to the banker as originals; but which,\nmere copies as they were, seemed to feel their degradation in being\nbrought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the\nceiling. The count turned round as he heard the entrance of Danglars\ninto the room. With a slight inclination of the head, Danglars signed\nto the count to be seated, pointing significantly to a gilded arm-chair,\ncovered with white satin embroidered with gold. The count sat down. \"I\nhave the honor, I presume, of addressing M. de Monte Cristo.\"\n\nThe count bowed. \"And I of speaking to Baron Danglars, chevalier of the\nLegion of Honor, and member of the Chamber of Deputies?\"\n\nMonte Cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron's card.\n\nDanglars felt the irony and compressed his lips. \"You will, I trust,\nexcuse me, monsieur, for not calling you by your title when I first\naddressed you,\" he said, \"but you are aware that we are living under a\npopular form of government, and that I am myself a representative of the\nliberties of the people.\"\n\n\"So much so,\" replied Monte Cristo, \"that while you call yourself baron\nyou are not willing to call anybody else count.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, monsieur,\" said Danglars with affected carelessness, \"I\nattach no sort of value to such empty distinctions; but the fact is, I\nwas made baron, and also chevalier of the Legion of Honor, in return for\nservices rendered, but\"--\n\n\"But you have discarded your titles after the example set you by Messrs.\nde Montmorency and Lafayette? That was a noble example to follow,\nmonsieur.\"\n\n\"Why,\" replied Danglars, \"not entirely so; with the servants,--you\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"I see; to your domestics you are 'my lord,' the journalists style\nyou 'monsieur,' while your constituents call you 'citizen.' These\nare distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government. I\nunderstand perfectly.\" Again Danglars bit his lips; he saw that he was\nno match for Monte Cristo in an argument of this sort, and he therefore\nhastened to turn to subjects more congenial.\n\n\"Permit me to inform you, Count,\" said he, bowing, \"that I have received\na letter of advice from Thomson & French, of Rome.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear it, baron,--for I must claim the privilege of\naddressing you after the manner of your servants. I have acquired the\nbad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country\nwhere barons are still barons by right of birth. But as regards the\nletter of advice, I am charmed to find that it has reached you; that\nwill spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for\nmoney myself. You have received a regular letter of advice?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Danglars, \"but I confess I didn't quite comprehend its\nmeaning.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"And for that reason I did myself the honor of calling upon you, in\norder to beg for an explanation.\"\n\n\"Go on, monsieur. Here I am, ready to give you any explanation you\ndesire.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Danglers, \"in the letter--I believe I have it about\nme\"--here he felt in his breast-pocket--\"yes, here it is. Well, this\nletter gives the Count of Monte Cristo unlimited credit on our house.\"\n\n\"Well, baron, what is there difficult to understand about that?\"\n\n\"Merely the term unlimited--nothing else, certainly.\"\n\n\"Is not that word known in France? The people who wrote are\nAnglo-Germans, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, as for the composition of the letter, there is nothing to be said;\nbut as regards the competency of the document, I certainly have doubts.\"\n\n\"Is it possible?\" asked the count, assuming all air and tone of the\nutmost simplicity and candor. \"Is it possible that Thomson & French\nare not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers? Pray tell me what\nyou think, baron, for I feel uneasy, I can assure you, having some\nconsiderable property in their hands.\"\n\n\"Thomson & French are perfectly solvent,\" replied Danglars, with an\nalmost mocking smile: \"but the word unlimited, in financial affairs, is\nso extremely vague.\"\n\n\"Is, in fact, unlimited,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Precisely what I was about to say,\" cried Danglars. \"Now what is vague\nis doubtful; and it was a wise man who said, 'when in doubt, keep out.'\"\n\n\"Meaning to say,\" rejoined Monte Cristo, \"that however Thomson & French\nmay be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly, the Baron\nDanglars is not disposed to follow their example.\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Plainly enough. Messrs. Thomson & French set no bounds to their\nengagements while those of M. Danglars have their limits; he is a wise\nman, according to his own showing.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied the banker, drawing himself up with a haughty air,\n\"the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned.\"\n\n\"It seems, then, reserved for me,\" said Monte Cristo coldly, \"to be the\nfirst to do so.\"\n\n\"By what right, sir?\"\n\n\"By right of the objections you have raised, and the explanations you\nhave demanded, which certainly must have some motive.\"\n\nOnce more Danglars bit his lips. It was the second time he had been\nworsted, and this time on his own ground. His forced politeness sat\nawkwardly upon him, and approached almost to impertinence. Monte Cristo\non the contrary, preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor, aided by\na certain degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure, and thus\npossessed the advantage.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" resumed Danglars, after a brief silence, \"I will endeavor\nto make myself understood, by requesting you to inform me for what sum\nyou propose to draw upon me?\"\n\n\"Why, truly,\" replied Monte Cristo, determined not to lose an inch of\nthe ground he had gained, \"my reason for desiring an 'unlimited' credit\nwas precisely because I did not know how much money I might need.\"\n\nThe banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand. So\nthrowing himself back in his arm-chair, he said, with an arrogant and\npurse-proud air,--\"Let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your\nwishes; you will then be convinced that the resources of the house\nof Danglars, however limited, are still equal to meeting the largest\ndemands; and were you even to require a million\"--\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" interposed Monte Cristo.\n\n\"I said a million,\" replied Danglars, with the confidence of ignorance.\n\n\"But could I do with a million?\" retorted the count. \"My dear sir, if a\ntrifle like that could suffice me, I should never have given myself the\ntrouble of opening an account. A million? Excuse my smiling when you\nspeak of a sum I am in the habit of carrying in my pocket-book or\ndressing-case.\" And with these words Monte Cristo took from his pocket\na small case containing his visiting-cards, and drew forth two orders on\nthe treasury for 500,000 francs each, payable at sight to the bearer.\nA man like Danglars was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method\nof correction. The effect of the present revelation was stunning; he\ntrembled and was on the verge of apoplexy. The pupils of his eyes, as he\ngazed at Monte Cristo dilated horribly.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said Monte Cristo, \"confess honestly that you have not\nperfect confidence in Thomson & French. I understand, and foreseeing\nthat such might be the case, I took, in spite of my ignorance of\naffairs, certain precautions. See, here are two similar letters to that\nyou have yourself received; one from the house of Arstein & Eskeles of\nVienna, to Baron Rothschild, the other drawn by Baring of London, upon\nM. Laffitte. Now, sir, you have but to say the word, and I will spare\nyou all uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of\nthese two firms.\" The blow had struck home, and Danglars was entirely\nvanquished; with a trembling hand he took the two letters from the\ncount, who held them carelessly between finger and thumb, and proceeded\nto scrutinize the signatures, with a minuteness that the count might\nhave regarded as insulting, had it not suited his present purpose to\nmislead the banker. \"Oh, sir,\" said Danglars, after he had convinced\nhimself of the authenticity of the documents he held, and rising as if\nto salute the power of gold personified in the man before him,--\"three\nletters of unlimited credit! I can be no longer mistrustful, but\nyou must pardon me, my dear count, for confessing to some degree of\nastonishment.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" answered Monte Cristo, with the most gentlemanly air, \"'tis\nnot for such trifling sums as these that your banking house is to be\nincommoded. Then, you can let me have some money, can you not?\"\n\n\"Whatever you say, my dear count; I am at your orders.\"\n\n\"Why,\" replied Monte Cristo, \"since we mutually understand each\nother--for such I presume is the case?\" Danglars bowed assentingly. \"You\nare quite sure that not a lurking doubt or suspicion lingers in your\nmind?\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear count,\" exclaimed Danglars, \"I never for an instant\nentertained such a feeling towards you.\"\n\n\"No, you merely wished to be convinced, nothing more; but now that\nwe have come to so clear an understanding, and that all distrust and\nsuspicion are laid at rest, we may as well fix a sum as the probable\nexpenditure of the first year, suppose we say six millions to\"--\n\n\"Six millions!\" gasped Danglars--\"so be it.\"\n\n\"Then, if I should require more,\" continued Monte Cristo in a careless\nmanner, \"why, of course, I should draw upon you; but my present\nintention is not to remain in France more than a year, and during that\nperiod I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I mentioned. However, we\nshall see. Be kind enough, then, to send me 500,000 francs to-morrow. I\nshall be at home till midday, or if not, I will leave a receipt with my\nsteward.\"\n\n\"The money you desire shall be at your house by ten o'clock to-morrow\nmorning, my dear count,\" replied Danglars. \"How would you like to have\nit? in gold, silver, or notes?\"\n\n\"Half in gold, and the other half in bank-notes, if you please,\" said\nthe count, rising from his seat.\n\n\"I must confess to you, count,\" said Danglars, \"that I have hitherto\nimagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great fortunes of\nEurope, and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me.\nMay I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it?\"\n\n\"It has been in the family a very long while,\" returned Monte Cristo, \"a\nsort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period\nof years, during which the accumulated interest has doubled the capital.\nThe period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches\noccurred only a short time ago, and they have only been employed by me\nwithin the last few years. Your ignorance on the subject, therefore, is\neasily accounted for. However, you will be better informed as to me and\nmy possessions ere long.\" And the count, while pronouncing these latter\nwords, accompanied them with one of those ghastly smiles that used to\nstrike terror into poor Franz d'Epinay.\n\n\"With your tastes, and means of gratifying them,\" continued Danglars,\n\"you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable\nmillionaires quite in the shade. If I mistake not you are an admirer of\npaintings, at least I judged so from the attention you appeared to be\nbestowing on mine when I entered the room. If you will permit me, I\nshall be happy to show you my picture gallery, composed entirely of\nworks by the ancient masters--warranted as such. Not a modern picture\namong them. I cannot endure the modern school of painting.\"\n\n\"You are perfectly right in objecting to them, for this one great\nfault--that they have not yet had time to become old.\"\n\n\"Or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by Thorwaldsen,\nBartoloni, and Canova?--all foreign artists, for, as you may perceive, I\nthink but very indifferently of our French sculptors.\"\n\n\"You have a right to be unjust to them, monsieur; they are your\ncompatriots.\"\n\n\"But all this may come later, when we shall be better known to each\nother. For the present, I will confine myself (if perfectly agreeable to\nyou) to introducing you to the Baroness Danglars--excuse my impatience,\nmy dear count, but a client like you is almost like a member of the\nfamily.\" Monte Cristo bowed, in sign that he accepted the proffered\nhonor; Danglars rang and was answered by a servant in a showy livery.\n\"Is the baroness at home?\" inquired Danglars.\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" answered the man.\n\n\"And alone?\"\n\n\"No, my lord, madame has visitors.\"\n\n\"Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame, or\ndo you desire to preserve a strict incognito?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" replied Monte Cristo with a smile, \"I do not arrogate to\nmyself the right of so doing.\"\n\n\"And who is with madame?--M. Debray?\" inquired Danglars, with an air of\nindulgence and good-nature that made Monte Cristo smile, acquainted as\nhe was with the secrets of the banker's domestic life.\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied the servant, \"M. Debray is with madame.\"\nDanglars nodded his head; then, turning to Monte Cristo, said, \"M.\nLucien Debray is an old friend of ours, and private secretary to the\nMinister of the Interior. As for my wife, I must tell you, she lowered\nherself by marrying me, for she belongs to one of the most ancient\nfamilies in France. Her maiden name was De Servieres, and her first\nhusband was Colonel the Marquis of Nargonne.\"\n\n\"I have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars; but I have already met\nM. Lucien Debray.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed?\" said Danglars; \"and where was that?\"\n\n\"At the house of M. de Morcerf.\"\n\n\"Ah, ha, you are acquainted with the young viscount, are you?\"\n\n\"We were together a good deal during the Carnival at Rome.\"\n\n\"True, true,\" cried Danglars. \"Let me see; have I not heard talk of\nsome strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins, and of\nhis having had a miraculous escape? I forget how, but I know he used\nto amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his return\nfrom Italy.\"\n\n\"Her ladyship is waiting to receive you, gentlemen,\" said the servant,\nwho had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress. \"With your\npermission,\" said Danglars, bowing, \"I will precede you, to show you the\nway.\"\n\n\"By all means,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"I follow you.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 47. The Dappled Grays.\n\nThe baron, followed by the count, traversed a long series of apartments,\nin which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the\ngaudiness of ostentatious wealth, until he reached the boudoir of Madame\nDanglars--a small octagonal-shaped room, hung with pink satin, covered\nwith white Indian muslin. The chairs were of ancient workmanship\nand materials; over the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and\nshepherdesses, after the style and manner of Boucher; and at each side\npretty medallions in crayons, harmonizing well with the furnishings of\nthis charming apartment, the only one throughout the great mansion\nin which any distinctive taste prevailed. The truth was, it had been\nentirely overlooked in the plan arranged and followed out by M. Danglars\nand his architect, who had been selected to aid the baron in the great\nwork of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and\ncelebrated decorator of the day. The decorations of the boudoir had then\nbeen left entirely to Madame Danglars and Lucien Debray. M. Danglars,\nhowever, while possessing a great admiration for the antique, as it\nwas understood during the time of the Directory, entertained the most\nsovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his wife's favorite\nsitting-room, where, by the way, he was never permitted to intrude,\nunless, indeed, he excused his own appearance by ushering in some more\nagreeable visitor than himself; and even then he had rather the air and\nmanner of a person who was himself introduced, than that of being\nthe presenter of another, his reception being cordial or frigid, in\nproportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please or\ndisplease the baroness.\n\nMadame Danglars (who, although past the first bloom of youth, was still\nstrikingly handsome) was now seated at the piano, a most elaborate piece\nof cabinet and inlaid work, while Lucien Debray, standing before a small\nwork-table, was turning over the pages of an album. Lucien had found\ntime, preparatory to the count's arrival, to relate many particulars\nrespecting him to Madame Danglars. It will be remembered that Monte\nCristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party\nassembled at the breakfast given by Albert de Morcerf; and although\nDebray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings, he had never\nbeen able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the\nimpressive look and manner of the count, consequently the description\ngiven by Lucien to the baroness bore the highly-colored tinge of his own\nheated imagination. Already excited by the wonderful stories related of\nthe count by De Morcerf, it is no wonder that Madame Danglars eagerly\nlistened to, and fully credited, all the additional circumstances\ndetailed by Debray. This posing at the piano and over the album was only\na little ruse adopted by way of precaution. A most gracious welcome and\nunusual smile were bestowed on M. Danglars; the count, in return for\nhis gentlemanly bow, received a formal though graceful courtesy, while\nLucien exchanged with the count a sort of distant recognition, and with\nDanglars a free and easy nod.\n\n\"Baroness,\" said Danglars, \"give me leave to present to you the Count\nof Monte Cristo, who has been most warmly recommended to me by my\ncorrespondents at Rome. I need but mention one fact to make all the\nladies in Paris court his notice, and that is, that he has come to take\nup his abode in Paris for a year, during which brief period he proposes\nto spend six millions of money. That means balls, dinners, and lawn\nparties without end, in all of which I trust the count will remember\nus, as he may depend upon it we shall him, in our own humble\nentertainments.\" In spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this\naddress, Madame Danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable\ninterest on a man capable of expending six millions in twelve months,\nand who had selected Paris for the scene of his princely extravagance.\n\"And when did you arrive here?\" inquired she.\n\n\"Yesterday morning, madame.\"\n\n\"Coming, as usual, I presume, from the extreme end of the globe? Pardon\nme--at least, such I have heard is your custom.\"\n\n\"Nay, madame. This time I have merely come from Cadiz.\"\n\n\"You have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit. Paris\nis a horrible place in summer. Balls, parties, and fetes are over; the\nItalian opera is in London; the French opera everywhere except in Paris.\nAs for the Theatre Francais, you know, of course, that it is nowhere.\nThe only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the Champ de\nMars and Satory. Do you propose entering any horses at either of these\nraces, count?\"\n\n\"I shall do whatever they do at Paris, madame, if I have the good\nfortune to find some one who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas\nof amusement.\"\n\n\"Are you fond of horses, count?\"\n\n\"I have passed a considerable part of my life in the East, madame, and\nyou are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two things--the\nfine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women.\"\n\n\"Nay, count,\" said the baroness, \"it would have been somewhat more\ngallant to have placed the ladies first.\"\n\n\"You see, madame, how rightly I spoke when I said I required a preceptor\nto guide me in all my sayings and doings here.\" At this instant the\nfavorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the boudoir; approaching\nher mistress, she spoke some words in an undertone. Madame Danglars\nturned very pale, then exclaimed,--\"I cannot believe it; the thing is\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"I assure you, madame,\" replied the woman, \"it is as I have said.\"\nTurning impatiently towards her husband, Madame Danglars demanded, \"Is\nthis true?\"\n\n\"Is what true, madame?\" inquired Danglars, visibly agitated.\n\n\"What my maid tells me.\"\n\n\"But what does she tell you?\"\n\n\"That when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my carriage,\nhe discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his\nknowledge. I desire to know what is the meaning of this?\"\n\n\"Be kind enough, madame, to listen to me,\" said Danglars.\n\n\"Oh, yes; I will listen, monsieur, for I am most curious to hear what\nexplanation you will give. These two gentlemen shall decide between us;\nbut, first, I will state the case to them. Gentlemen,\" continued the\nbaroness, \"among the ten horses in the stables of Baron Danglars, are\ntwo that belong exclusively to me--a pair of the handsomest and most\nspirited creatures to be found in Paris. But to you, at least, M.\nDebray, I need not give a further description, because to you my\nbeautiful pair of dappled grays were well known. Well, I had promised\nMadame de Villefort the loan of my carriage to drive to-morrow to the\nBois; but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they\nare gone--positively gone. No doubt M. Danglars has sacrificed them to\nthe selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs.\nOh, what a detestable crew they are, these mercenary speculators!\"\n\n\"Madame,\" replied Danglars, \"the horses were not sufficiently quiet\nfor you; they were scarcely four years old, and they made me extremely\nuneasy on your account.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" retorted the baroness; \"you could not have entertained any\nalarm on the subject, because you are perfectly well aware that I have\nhad for a month in my service the very best coachman in Paris. But,\nperhaps, you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses?\"\n\n\"My dear love, pray do not say any more about them, and I promise\nyou another pair exactly like them in appearance, only more quiet and\nsteady.\" The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable\ncontempt, while her husband, affecting not to observe this unconjugal\ngesture, turned towards Monte Cristo and said,--\"Upon my word, count,\nI am quite sorry not to have met you sooner. You are setting up an\nestablishment, of course?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" replied the count.\n\n\"I should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses. I have\nalmost given them away, as it is; but, as I before said, I was anxious\nto get rid of them upon any terms. They were only fit for a young man.\"\n\n\"I am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me,\" said Monte\nCristo; \"but this morning I purchased a very excellent pair of\ncarriage-horses, and I do not think they were dear. There they are.\nCome, M. Debray, you are a connoisseur, I believe, let me have your\nopinion upon them.\" As Debray walked towards the window, Danglars\napproached his wife. \"I could not tell you before others,\" said he in a\nlow tone, \"the reason of my parting with the horses; but a most enormous\nprice was offered me this morning for them. Some madman or fool, bent\nupon ruining himself as fast as he can, actually sent his steward to\nme to purchase them at any cost; and the fact is, I have gained 16,000\nfrancs by the sale of them. Come, don't look so angry, and you shall\nhave 4,000 francs of the money to do what you like with, and Eugenie\nshall have 2,000. There, what do you think now of the affair? Wasn't\nI right to part with the horses?\" Madame Danglars surveyed her husband\nwith a look of withering contempt.\n\n\"Great heavens?\" suddenly exclaimed Debray.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the baroness.\n\n\"I cannot be mistaken; there are your horses! The very animals we were\nspeaking of, harnessed to the count's carriage!\"\n\n\"My dappled grays?\" demanded the baroness, springing to the window.\n\"'Tis indeed they!\" said she. Danglars looked absolutely stupefied. \"How\nvery singular,\" cried Monte Cristo with well-feigned astonishment.\n\n\"I cannot believe it,\" murmured the banker. Madame Danglars whispered\na few words in the ear of Debray, who approached Monte Cristo, saying,\n\"The baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for the horses.\"\n\n\"I scarcely know,\" replied the count; \"it was a little surprise prepared\nfor me by my steward, and cost me--well, somewhere about 30,000 francs.\"\nDebray conveyed the count's reply to the baroness. Poor Danglars looked\nso crest-fallen and discomfited that Monte Cristo assumed a pitying air\ntowards him. \"See,\" said the count, \"how very ungrateful women are. Your\nkind attention, in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing\nof the horses, does not seem to have made the least impression on her.\nBut so it is; a woman will often, from mere wilfulness, prefer that\nwhich is dangerous to that which is safe. Therefore, in my opinion, my\ndear baron, the best and easiest way is to leave them to their fancies,\nand allow them to act as they please, and then, if any mischief follows,\nwhy, at least, they have no one to blame but themselves.\" Danglars made\nno reply; he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene between\nhimself and the baroness, whose frowning brow, like that of Olympic\nJove, predicted a storm. Debray, who perceived the gathering clouds,\nand felt no desire to witness the explosion of Madame Danglars' rage,\nsuddenly recollected an appointment, which compelled him to take his\nleave; while Monte Cristo, unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy\nthe advantages he hoped to obtain, made a farewell bow and departed,\nleaving Danglars to endure the angry reproaches of his wife.\n\n\"Excellent,\" murmured Monte Cristo to himself, as he came away. \"All\nhas gone according to my wishes. The domestic peace of this family is\nhenceforth in my hands. Now, then, to play another master-stroke, by\nwhich I shall gain the heart of both husband and wife--delightful!\nStill,\" added he, \"amid all this, I have not yet been presented to\nMademoiselle Eugenie Danglars, whose acquaintance I should have been\nglad to make. But,\" he went on with his peculiar smile, \"I am here in\nParis, and have plenty of time before me--by and by will do for that.\"\nWith these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home. Two\nhours afterwards, Madame Danglars received a most flattering epistle\nfrom the count, in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite\n\"dappled grays,\" protesting that he could not endure the idea of making\nhis entry into the Parisian world of fashion with the knowledge that\nhis splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely woman's\nregrets. The horses were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen\non them in the morning; only, by the count's orders, in the centre of\neach rosette that adorned either side of their heads, had been fastened\na large diamond.\n\nTo Danglars Monte Cristo also wrote, requesting him to excuse the\nwhimsical gift of a capricious millionaire, and to beg the baroness to\npardon the Eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses.\n\nDuring the evening, Monte Cristo quitted Paris for Auteuil, accompanied\nby Ali. The following day, about three o'clock, a single blow struck on\nthe gong summoned Ali to the presence of the count. \"Ali,\" observed\nhis master, as the Nubian entered the chamber, \"you have frequently\nexplained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the\nlasso, have you not?\" Ali drew himself up proudly, and then returned a\nsign in the affirmative. \"I thought I did not mistake. With your lasso\nyou could stop an ox?\" Again Ali repeated his affirmative gesture. \"Or a\ntiger?\" Ali bowed his head in token of assent. \"A lion even?\" Ali sprung\nforwards, imitating the action of one throwing the lasso, then of a\nstrangled lion.\n\n\"I understand,\" said Monte Cristo; \"you wish to tell me you have hunted\nthe lion?\" Ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he\nhad indeed both chased and captured many lions. \"But do you believe\nyou could arrest the progress of two horses rushing forwards with\nungovernable fury?\" The Nubian smiled. \"It is well,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\"Then listen to me. Ere long a carriage will dash past here, drawn by\nthe pair of dappled gray horses you saw me with yesterday; now, at the\nrisk of your own life, you must manage to stop those horses before my\ndoor.\"\n\nAli descended to the street, and marked a straight line on the pavement\nimmediately at the entrance of the house, and then pointed out the line\nhe had traced to the count, who was watching him. The count patted him\ngently on the shoulder, his usual mode of praising Ali, who, pleased\nand gratified with the commission assigned him, walked calmly towards a\nprojecting stone forming the angle of the street and house, and, seating\nhimself thereon, began to smoke his chibouque, while Monte Cristo\nre-entered his dwelling, perfectly assured of the success of his plan.\nStill, as five o'clock approached, and the carriage was momentarily\nexpected by the count, the indication of more than common impatience and\nuneasiness might be observed in his manner. He stationed himself in a\nroom commanding a view of the street, pacing the chamber with restless\nsteps, stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of\napproaching wheels, then to cast an anxious glance on Ali; but the\nregularity with which the Nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque\nproved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his\nfavorite occupation. Suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing\nwheels was heard, and almost immediately a carriage appeared, drawn by\na pair of wild, ungovernable horses, while the terrified coachman strove\nin vain to restrain their furious speed.\n\nIn the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight\nclasped in each other's arms. Terror seemed to have deprived them even\nof the power of uttering a cry. The carriage creaked and rattled as it\nflew over the rough stones, and the slightest obstacle under the wheels\nwould have caused disaster; but it kept on in the middle of the road,\nand those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror.\n\nAli suddenly cast aside his chibouque, drew the lasso from his pocket,\nthrew it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its\ntriple fold, and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by\nthe violence of the shock, then the animal fell over on the pole, which\nsnapped, and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way.\nGladly availing himself of this opportunity, the coachman leaped from\nhis box; but Ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse,\nand held them in his iron grasp, till the beast, snorting with pain,\nsunk beside his companion. All this was achieved in much less time\nthan is occupied in the recital. The brief space had, however, been\nsufficient for a man, followed by a number of servants, to rush from\nthe house before which the accident had occurred, and, as the coachman\nopened the door of the carriage, to take from it a lady who was\nconvulsively grasping the cushions with one hand, while with the other\nshe pressed to her bosom the young boy, who had lost consciousness.\n\nMonte Cristo carried them both to the salon, and deposited them on a\nsofa. \"Compose yourself, madame,\" said he; \"all danger is over.\" The\nwoman looked up at these words, and, with a glance far more expressive\nthan any entreaties could have been, pointed to her child, who still\ncontinued insensible. \"I understand the nature of your alarms, madame,\"\nsaid the count, carefully examining the child, \"but I assure you there\nis not the slightest occasion for uneasiness; your little charge has not\nreceived the least injury; his insensibility is merely the effects of\nterror, and will soon pass.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears? See\nhow deadly pale he is! My child, my darling Edward; speak to your\nmother--open your dear eyes and look on me once again! Oh, sir, in pity\nsend for a physician; my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for\nthe recovery of my boy.\"\n\nWith a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand, Monte Cristo signed to\nthe distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions; then, opening\na casket that stood near, he drew forth a phial of Bohemian glass\nincrusted with gold, containing a liquid of the color of blood, of which\nhe let fall a single drop on the child's lips. Scarcely had it reached\nthem, ere the boy, though still pale as marble, opened his eyes, and\neagerly gazed around him. At this, the delight of the mother was almost\nfrantic. \"Where am I?\" exclaimed she; \"and to whom am I indebted for so\nhappy a termination to my late dreadful alarm?\"\n\n\"Madame,\" answered the count, \"you are under the roof of one who esteems\nhimself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further\ncontinuance of your sufferings.\"\n\n\"My wretched curiosity has brought all this about,\" pursued the lady.\n\"All Paris rung with the praises of Madame Danglars' beautiful horses,\nand I had the folly to desire to know whether they really merited the\nhigh praise given to them.\"\n\n\"Is it possible,\" exclaimed the count with well-feigned astonishment,\n\"that these horses belong to the baroness?\"\n\n\"They do, indeed. May I inquire if you are acquainted with Madame\nDanglars?\"\n\n\"I have that honor; and my happiness at your escape from the danger that\nthreatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that I have been\nthe unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have\nincurred. I yesterday purchased these horses of the baron; but as the\nbaroness evidently regretted parting with them, I ventured to send them\nback to her, with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them\nfrom my hands.\"\n\n\"You are, then, doubtless, the Count of Monte Cristo, of whom Hermine\nhas talked to me so much?\"\n\n\"You have rightly guessed, madame,\" replied the count.\n\n\"And I am Madame Heloise de Villefort.\" The count bowed with the air of\na person who hears a name for the first time. \"How grateful will M. de\nVillefort be for all your goodness; how thankfully will he acknowledge\nthat to you alone he owes the existence of his wife and child! Most\ncertainly, but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid servant, this\ndear child and myself must both have perished.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in.\"\n\n\"I trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your\nman.\"\n\n\"I beseech you, madame,\" replied Monte Cristo \"not to spoil Ali, either\nby too great praise or rewards. I cannot allow him to acquire the habit\nof expecting to be recompensed for every trifling service he may render.\nAli is my slave, and in saving your life he was but discharging his duty\nto me.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" interposed Madame de Villefort, on whom the authoritative style\nadopted by the count made a deep impression, \"nay, but consider that to\npreserve my life he has risked his own.\"\n\n\"His life, madame, belongs not to him; it is mine, in return for my\nhaving myself saved him from death.\" Madame de Villefort made no further\nreply; her mind was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the\nperson who, from the first instant she saw him, had made so powerful\nan impression on her. During the evident preoccupation of Madame de\nVillefort, Monte Cristo scrutinized the features and appearance of\nthe boy she kept folded in her arms, lavishing on him the most tender\nendearments. The child was small for his age, and unnaturally pale. A\nmass of straight black hair, defying all attempts to train or curl\nit, fell over his projecting forehead, and hung down to his shoulders,\ngiving increased vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love\nof mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment. His mouth\nwas large, and the lips, which had not yet regained their color,\nwere particularly thin; in fact, the deep and crafty look, giving a\npredominant expression to the child's face, belonged rather to a boy of\ntwelve or fourteen than to one so young. His first movement was to free\nhimself by a violent push from the encircling arms of his mother, and to\nrush forward to the casket from whence the count had taken the phial of\nelixir; then, without asking permission of any one, he proceeded, in all\nthe wilfulness of a spoiled child unaccustomed to restrain either whims\nor caprices, to pull the corks out of all the bottles.\n\n\"Touch nothing, my little friend,\" cried the count eagerly; \"some of\nthose liquids are not only dangerous to taste, but even to inhale.\"\n\nMadame de Villefort became very pale, and, seizing her son's arm, drew\nhim anxiously toward her; but, once satisfied of his safety, she also\ncast a brief but expressive glance on the casket, which was not lost\nupon the count. At this moment Ali entered. At sight of him Madame de\nVillefort uttered an expression of pleasure, and, holding the child\nstill closer towards her, she said, \"Edward, dearest, do you see that\ngood man? He has shown very great courage and resolution, for he exposed\nhis own life to stop the horses that were running away with us, and\nwould certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces. Thank him, then,\nmy child, in your very best manner; for, had he not come to our aid,\nneither you nor I would have been alive to speak our thanks.\" The child\nstuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner,\nsaying, \"He's too ugly.\"\n\nThe count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes, while\nMadame de Villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation\nvery far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed.\n\"This lady,\" said the Count, speaking to Ali in the Arabic language, \"is\ndesirous that her son should thank you for saving both their lives; but\nthe boy refuses, saying you are too ugly.\" Ali turned his intelligent\ncountenance towards the boy, on whom he gazed without any apparent\nemotion; but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the\npracticed eye of Monte Cristo that the Arab had been wounded to the\nheart.\n\n\"Will you permit me to inquire,\" said Madame de Villefort, as she arose\nto take her leave, \"whether you usually reside here?\"\n\n\"No, I do not,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"it is a small place I have\npurchased quite lately. My place of abode is No. 30, Avenue des Champs\nElysees; but I see you have quite recovered from your fright, and are,\nno doubt, desirous of returning home. Anticipating your wishes, I have\ndesired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my carriages,\nand Ali, he whom you think so very ugly,\" continued he, addressing the\nboy with a smiling air, \"will have the honor of driving you home, while\nyour coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your\ncalash. As soon as that important business is concluded, I will have a\npair of my own horses harnessed to convey it direct to Madame Danglars.\"\n\n\"I dare not return with those dreadful horses,\" said Madame de\nVillefort.\n\n\"You will see,\" replied Monte Cristo, \"that they will be as different as\npossible in the hands of Ali. With him they will be gentle and docile\nas lambs.\" Ali had, indeed, given proof of this; for, approaching the\nanimals, who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty,\nhe rubbed their foreheads and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic\nvinegar, and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths.\nThen, commencing a loud whistling noise, he rubbed them well all over\ntheir bodies for several minutes; then, undisturbed by the noisy crowd\ncollected round the broken carriage, Ali quietly harnessed the pacified\nanimals to the count's chariot, took the reins in his hands, and mounted\nthe box, when to the utter astonishment of those who had witnessed\nthe ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same horses, he was\nactually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle manner before\nhe could induce them to start; and even then all that could be obtained\nfrom the celebrated \"dappled grays,\" now changed into a couple of dull,\nsluggish, stupid brutes, was a slow, pottering pace, kept up with\nso much difficulty that Madame de Villefort was more than two hours\nreturning to her residence in the Faubourg St. Honore.\n\nScarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been\ngone through when she wrote the following letter to Madame Danglars:--\n\nDear Hermine,--I have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent\ndanger, and I owe my safety to the very Count of Monte Cristo we were\ntalking about yesterday, but whom I little expected to see to-day. I\nremember how unmercifully I laughed at what I considered your eulogistic\nand exaggerated praises of him; but I have now ample cause to admit that\nyour enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far short of\nhis merits. Your horses got as far as Ranelagh, when they darted forward\nlike mad things, and galloped away at so fearful a rate, that there\nseemed no other prospect for myself and my poor Edward but that of being\ndashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their progress,\nwhen a strange-looking man,--an Arab, a negro, or a Nubian, at least\na black of some nation or other--at a signal from the count, whose\ndomestic he is, suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals, even\nat the risk of being trampled to death himself; and certainly he must\nhave had a most wonderful escape. The count then hastened to us, and\ntook us into his house, where he speedily recalled my poor Edward to\nlife. He sent us home in his own carriage. Yours will be returned to you\nto-morrow. You will find your horses in bad condition, from the results\nof this accident; they seem thoroughly stupefied, as if sulky and vexed\nat having been conquered by man. The count, however, has commissioned\nme to assure you that two or three days' rest, with plenty of barley for\ntheir sole food during that time, will bring them back to as fine, that\nis as terrifying, a condition as they were in yesterday. Adieu! I cannot\nreturn you many thanks for the drive of yesterday; but, after all,\nI ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses, more\nespecially as it procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the\nCount of Monte Cristo,--and certainly that illustrious personage, apart\nfrom the millions he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of, seemed\nto me one of those curiously interesting problems I, for one, delight in\nsolving at any risk, even if it were to necessitate another drive to\nthe Bois behind your horses. Edward endured the accident with miraculous\ncourage--he did not utter a single cry, but fell lifeless into my arms;\nnor did a tear fall from his eyes after it was over. I doubt not you\nwill consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection, but\nthere is a soul of iron in that delicate, fragile body. Valentine sends\nmany affectionate remembrances to your dear Eugenie. I embrace you with\nall my heart.\n\nHeloise de Villefort.\n\nP.S.--Do pray contrive some means for me to meet the Count of Monte\nCristo at your house. I must and will see him again. I have just made\nM. de Villefort promise to call on him, and I hope the visit will be\nreturned.\n\nThat night the adventure at Auteuil was talked of everywhere. Albert\nrelated it to his mother; Chateau-Renaud recounted it at the Jockey\nClub, and Debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister;\neven Beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation\nof the count's courage and gallantry, thereby celebrating him as the\ngreatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the\naristocracy. Vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who\nleft their names at the residence of Madame de Villefort, with the\ndesign of renewing their visit at the right moment, of hearing from her\nlips all the interesting circumstances of this most romantic adventure.\nAs for M. de Villefort, he fulfilled the predictions of Heloise to the\nletter,--donned his dress suit, drew on a pair of white gloves, ordered\nthe servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery, and\ndrove that same night to No. 30 in the Avenue des Champs-Elysees.\n\n\n\nChapter 48. Ideology.\n\nIf the Count of Monte Cristo had been for a long time familiar with\nthe ways of Parisian society, he would have appreciated better the\nsignificance of the step which M. de Villefort had taken. Standing well\nat court, whether the king regnant was of the older or younger branch,\nwhether the government was doctrinaire liberal, or conservative; looked\nupon by all as a man of talent, since those who have never experienced\na political check are generally so regarded; hated by many, but warmly\nsupported by others, without being really liked by anybody, M. de\nVillefort held a high position in the magistracy, and maintained\nhis eminence like a Harlay or a Mole. His drawing-room, under the\nregenerating influence of a young wife and a daughter by his first\nmarriage, scarcely eighteen, was still one of the well-regulated Paris\nsalons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of\nrigid etiquette were carefully maintained. A freezing politeness,\na strict fidelity to government principles, a profound contempt for\ntheories and theorists, a deep-seated hatred of ideality,--these were\nthe elements of private and public life displayed by M. de Villefort.\n\nHe was not only a magistrate, he was almost a diplomatist. His relations\nwith the former court, of which he always spoke with dignity and\nrespect, made him respected by the new one, and he knew so many\nthings, that not only was he always carefully considered, but sometimes\nconsulted. Perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to\nget rid of M. de Villefort; but, like the feudal barons who rebelled\nagainst their sovereign, he dwelt in an impregnable fortress. This\nfortress was his post as king's attorney, all the advantages of which\nhe exploited with marvellous skill, and which he would not have resigned\nbut to be made deputy, and thus to replace neutrality by opposition.\nOrdinarily M. de Villefort made and returned very few visits. His wife\nvisited for him, and this was the received thing in the world, where the\nweighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as\nan excuse for what was really only calculated pride, a manifestation of\nprofessed superiority--in fact, the application of the axiom, \"Pretend\nto think well of yourself, and the world will think well of you,\" an\naxiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the\nGreeks, \"Know thyself,\" a knowledge for which, in our days, we have\nsubstituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of knowing\nothers.\n\nTo his friends M. de Villefort was a powerful protector; to his enemies,\nhe was a silent, but bitter opponent; for those who were neither the\none nor the other, he was a statue of the law-made man. He had a haughty\nbearing, a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing\nand inquisitorial. Four successive revolutions had built and cemented\nthe pedestal upon which his fortune was based. M. de Villefort had the\nreputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome man in\nFrance. He gave a ball every year, at which he appeared for a quarter of\nan hour only,--that is to say, five and forty minutes less than the king\nis visible at his balls. He was never seen at the theatres, at concerts,\nor in any place of public resort. Occasionally, but seldom, he played\nat whist, and then care was taken to select partners worthy of\nhim--sometimes they were ambassadors, sometimes archbishops, or\nsometimes a prince, or a president, or some dowager duchess. Such was\nthe man whose carriage had just now stopped before the Count of Monte\nCristo's door. The valet de chambre announced M. de Villefort at the\nmoment when the count, leaning over a large table, was tracing on a map\nthe route from St. Petersburg to China.\n\nThe procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would\nhave employed in entering a court of justice. He was the same man, or\nrather the development of the same man, whom we have heretofore seen as\nassistant attorney at Marseilles. Nature, according to her way, had\nmade no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself. From being\nslender he had now become meagre; once pale, he was now yellow; his\ndeep-set eyes were hollow, and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes\nseemed to be an integral portion of his face. He dressed entirely in\nblack, with the exception of his white tie, and his funeral appearance\nwas only mitigated by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost\nimperceptibly through his button-hole, and appeared like a streak of\nblood traced with a delicate brush. Although master of himself, Monte\nCristo, scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the magistrate whose\nsalute he returned, and who, distrustful by habit, and especially\nincredulous as to social prodigies, was much more despised to look\nupon \"the noble stranger,\" as Monte Cristo was already called, as an\nadventurer in search of new fields, or an escaped criminal, rather than\nas a prince of the Holy See, or a sultan of the Thousand and One Nights.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Villefort, in the squeaky tone assumed by magistrates in\ntheir oratorical periods, and of which they cannot, or will not, divest\nthemselves in society, \"sir, the signal service which you yesterday\nrendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to offer you my\nthanks. I have come, therefore, to discharge this duty, and to express\nto you my overwhelming gratitude.\" And as he said this, the \"eye severe\"\nof the magistrate had lost nothing of its habitual arrogance. He spoke\nin a voice of the procureur-general, with the rigid inflexibility of\nneck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to say (as we have before\nobserved) that he was the living statue of the law.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied the count, with a chilling air, \"I am very happy to\nhave been the means of preserving a son to his mother, for they say that\nthe sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all; and the good fortune\nwhich occurred to me, monsieur, might have enabled you to dispense with\na duty which, in its discharge, confers an undoubtedly great honor; for\nI am aware that M. de Villefort is not usually lavish of the favor which\nhe now bestows on me,--a favor which, however estimable, is unequal\nto the satisfaction which I have in my own consciousness.\" Villefort,\nastonished at this reply, which he by no means expected, started like a\nsoldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears, and\na curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment he noted in\nthe tablets of his brain that the Count of Monte Cristo was by no\nmeans a highly bred gentleman. He glanced around, in order to seize\non something on which the conversation might turn, and seemed to fall\neasily on a topic. He saw the map which Monte Cristo had been examining\nwhen he entered, and said, \"You seem geographically engaged, sir? It is\na rich study for you, who, as I learn, have seen as many lands as are\ndelineated on this map.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the count; \"I have sought to make of the human\nrace, taken in the mass, what you practice every day on individuals--a\nphysiological study. I have believed it was much easier to descend from\nthe whole to a part than to ascend from a part to the whole. It is\nan algebraic axiom, which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown\nquantity, and not from an unknown to a known; but sit down, sir, I beg\nof you.\"\n\nMonte Cristo pointed to a chair, which the procureur was obliged to take\nthe trouble to move forwards himself, while the count merely fell back\ninto his own, on which he had been kneeling when M. Villefort entered.\nThus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor, having his back\ntowards the window, his elbow resting on the geographical chart which\nfurnished the theme of conversation for the moment,--a conversation\nwhich assumed, as in the case of the interviews with Danglars and\nMorcerf, a turn analogous to the persons, if not to the situation. \"Ah,\nyou philosophize,\" replied Villefort, after a moment's silence, during\nwhich, like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent, he took\nbreath; \"well, sir, really, if, like you, I had nothing else to do, I\nshould seek a more amusing occupation.\"\n\n\"Why, in truth, sir,\" was Monte Cristo's reply, \"man is but an ugly\ncaterpillar for him who studies him through a solar microscope; but you\nsaid, I think, that I had nothing else to do. Now, really, let me ask,\nsir, have you?--do you believe you have anything to do? or to speak in\nplain terms, do you really think that what you do deserves being called\nanything?\"\n\nVillefort's astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly\nmade by his strange adversary. It was a long time since the magistrate\nhad heard a paradox so strong, or rather, to say the truth more exactly,\nit was the first time he had ever heard of it. The procureur exerted\nhimself to reply. \"Sir,\" he responded, \"you are a stranger, and I\nbelieve you say yourself that a portion of your life has been spent\nin Oriental countries, so you are not aware how human justice, so\nexpeditious in barbarous countries, takes with us a prudent and\nwell-studied course.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--yes, I do, sir; it is the pede claudo of the ancients. I know\nall that, for it is with the justice of all countries especially that I\nhave occupied myself--it is with the criminal procedure of all nations\nthat I have compared natural justice, and I must say, sir, that it is\nthe law of primitive nations, that is, the law of retaliation, that I\nhave most frequently found to be according to the law of God.\"\n\n\"If this law were adopted, sir,\" said the procureur, \"it would greatly\nsimplify our legal codes, and in that case the magistrates would not (as\nyou just observed) have much to do.\"\n\n\"It may, perhaps, come to this in time,\" observed Monte Cristo; \"you\nknow that human inventions march from the complex to the simple, and\nsimplicity is always perfection.\"\n\n\"In the meanwhile,\" continued the magistrate, \"our codes are in full\nforce, with all their contradictory enactments derived from Gallic\ncustoms, Roman laws, and Frank usages; the knowledge of all which,\nyou will agree, is not to be acquired without extended labor; it needs\ntedious study to acquire this knowledge, and, when acquired, a strong\npower of brain to retain it.\"\n\n\"I agree with you entirely, sir; but all that even you know with respect\nto the French code, I know, not only in reference to that code, but as\nregards the codes of all nations. The English, Turkish, Japanese, Hindu\nlaws, are as familiar to me as the French laws, and thus I was right,\nwhen I said to you, that relatively (you know that everything is\nrelative, sir)--that relatively to what I have done, you have very\nlittle to do; but that relatively to all I have learned, you have yet a\ngreat deal to learn.\"\n\n\"But with what motive have you learned all this?\" inquired Villefort,\nin astonishment. Monte Cristo smiled. \"Really, sir,\" he observed, \"I see\nthat in spite of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior\nman, you look at everything from the material and vulgar view of\nsociety, beginning with man, and ending with man--that is to say, in\nthe most restricted, most narrow view which it is possible for human\nunderstanding to embrace.\"\n\n\"Pray, sir, explain yourself,\" said Villefort, more and more astonished,\n\"I really do--not--understand you--perfectly.\"\n\n\"I say, sir, that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of\nnations, you see only the springs of the machine, and lose sight of\nthe sublime workman who makes them act; I say that you do not recognize\nbefore you and around you any but those office-holders whose commissions\nhave been signed by a minister or king; and that the men whom God has\nput above those office-holders, ministers, and kings, by giving them a\nmission to follow out, instead of a post to fill--I say that they\nescape your narrow, limited field of observation. It is thus that human\nweakness fails, from its debilitated and imperfect organs. Tobias took\nthe angel who restored him to light for an ordinary young man. The\nnations took Attila, who was doomed to destroy them, for a conqueror\nsimilar to other conquerors, and it was necessary for both to reveal\ntheir missions, that they might be known and acknowledged; one was\ncompelled to say, 'I am the angel of the Lord'; and the other, 'I am\nthe hammer of God,' in order that the divine essence in both might be\nrevealed.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Villefort, more and more amazed, and really supposing he\nwas speaking to a mystic or a madman, \"you consider yourself as one of\nthose extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned?\"\n\n\"And why not?\" said Monte Cristo coldly.\n\n\"Your pardon, sir,\" replied Villefort, quite astounded, \"but you will\nexcuse me if, when I presented myself to you, I was unaware that I\nshould meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding so far\nsurpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men. It is not usual\nwith us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like\nyourself, possessors, as you are, of immense fortune--at least, so it\nis said--and I beg you to observe that I do not inquire, I merely\nrepeat;--it is not usual, I say, for such privileged and wealthy\nbeings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society, in\nphilosophical reveries, intended at best to console those whom fate has\ndisinherited from the goods of this world.\"\n\n\"Really, sir,\" retorted the count, \"have you attained the eminent\nsituation in which you are, without having admitted, or even without\nhaving met with exceptions? and do you never use your eyes, which must\nhave acquired so much finesse and certainty, to divine, at a glance, the\nkind of man by whom you are confronted? Should not a magistrate be not\nmerely the best administrator of the law, but the most crafty expounder\nof the chicanery of his profession, a steel probe to search hearts, a\ntouchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled with more or\nless of alloy?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Villefort, \"upon my word, you overcome me. I really never\nheard a person speak as you do.\"\n\n\"Because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general\nconditions, and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper\nspheres which God has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings.\"\n\n\"And you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked and\ninvisible beings mingle amongst us?\"\n\n\"Why should they not? Can you see the air you breathe, and yet without\nwhich you could not for a moment exist?\"\n\n\"Then we do not see those beings to whom you allude?\"\n\n\"Yes, we do; you see them whenever God pleases to allow them to assume a\nmaterial form. You touch them, come in contact with them, speak to them,\nand they reply to you.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Villefort, smiling, \"I confess I should like to be warned\nwhen one of these beings is in contact with me.\"\n\n\"You have been served as you desire, monsieur, for you were warned just\nnow, and I now again warn you.\"\n\n\"Then you yourself are one of these marked beings?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur, I believe so; for until now, no man has found himself in\na position similar to mine. The dominions of kings are limited either\nby mountains or rivers, or a change of manners, or an alteration of\nlanguage. My kingdom is bounded only by the world, for I am not an\nItalian, or a Frenchman, or a Hindu, or an American, or a Spaniard--I am\na cosmopolite. No country can say it saw my birth. God alone knows what\ncountry will see me die. I adopt all customs, speak all languages. You\nbelieve me to be a Frenchman, for I speak French with the same facility\nand purity as yourself. Well, Ali, my Nubian, believes me to be an Arab;\nBertuccio, my steward, takes me for a Roman; Haidee, my slave, thinks\nme a Greek. You may, therefore, comprehend, that being of no country,\nasking no protection from any government, acknowledging no man as\nmy brother, not one of the scruples that arrest the powerful, or the\nobstacles which paralyze the weak, paralyzes or arrests me. I have only\ntwo adversaries--I will not say two conquerors, for with perseverance I\nsubdue even them,--they are time and distance. There is a third, and the\nmost terrible--that is my condition as a mortal being. This alone can\nstop me in my onward career, before I have attained the goal at which\nI aim, for all the rest I have reduced to mathematical terms. What men\ncall the chances of fate--namely, ruin, change, circumstances--I have\nfully anticipated, and if any of these should overtake me, yet it\nwill not overwhelm me. Unless I die, I shall always be what I am, and\ntherefore it is that I utter the things you have never heard, even from\nthe mouths of kings--for kings have need, and other persons have fear\nof you. For who is there who does not say to himself, in a society as\nincongruously organized as ours, 'Perhaps some day I shall have to do\nwith the king's attorney'?\"\n\n\"But can you not say that, sir? The moment you become an inhabitant of\nFrance, you are naturally subjected to the French law.\"\n\n\"I know it sir,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"but when I visit a country I\nbegin to study, by all the means which are available, the men from whom\nI may have anything to hope or to fear, till I know them as well as,\nperhaps better than, they know themselves. It follows from this, that\nthe king's attorney, be he who he may, with whom I should have to deal,\nwould assuredly be more embarrassed than I should.\"\n\n\"That is to say,\" replied Villefort with hesitation, \"that human nature\nbeing weak, every man, according to your creed, has committed faults.\"\n\n\"Faults or crimes,\" responded Monte Cristo with a negligent air.\n\n\"And that you alone, amongst the men whom you do not recognize as your\nbrothers--for you have said so,\" observed Villefort in a tone that\nfaltered somewhat--\"you alone are perfect.\"\n\n\"No, not perfect,\" was the count's reply; \"only impenetrable, that's\nall. But let us leave off this strain, sir, if the tone of it is\ndispleasing to you; I am no more disturbed by your justice than are you\nby my second-sight.\"\n\n\"No, no,--by no means,\" said Villefort, who was afraid of seeming\nto abandon his ground. \"No; by your brilliant and almost sublime\nconversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level; we no longer\ntalk, we rise to dissertation. But you know how the theologians in their\ncollegiate chairs, and philosophers in their controversies, occasionally\nsay cruel truths; let us suppose for the moment that we are theologizing\nin a social way, or even philosophically, and I will say to you, rude\nas it may seem, 'My brother, you sacrifice greatly to pride; you may be\nabove others, but above you there is God.'\"\n\n\"Above us all, sir,\" was Monte Cristo's response, in a tone and with\nan emphasis so deep that Villefort involuntarily shuddered. \"I have my\npride for men--serpents always ready to threaten every one who would\npass without crushing them under foot. But I lay aside that pride before\nGod, who has taken me from nothing to make me what I am.\"\n\n\"Then, count, I admire you,\" said Villefort, who, for the first time\nin this strange conversation, used the aristocratic form to the unknown\npersonage, whom, until now, he had only called monsieur. \"Yes, and I\nsay to you, if you are really strong, really superior, really pious,\nor impenetrable, which you were right in saying amounts to the\nsame thing--then be proud, sir, for that is the characteristic of\npredominance. Yet you have unquestionably some ambition.\"\n\n\"I have, sir.\"\n\n\"And what may it be?\"\n\n\"I too, as happens to every man once in his life, have been taken by\nSatan into the highest mountain in the earth, and when there he showed\nme all the kingdoms of the world, and as he said before, so said he to\nme, 'Child of earth, what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me?' I\nreflected long, for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me, and then\nI replied, 'Listen,--I have always heard of providence, and yet I have\nnever seen him, or anything that resembles him, or which can make me\nbelieve that he exists. I wish to be providence myself, for I feel that\nthe most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is\nto recompense and punish.' Satan bowed his head, and groaned. 'You\nmistake,' he said, 'providence does exist, only you have never seen him,\nbecause the child of God is as invisible as the parent. You have seen\nnothing that resembles him, because he works by secret springs, and\nmoves by hidden ways. All I can do for you is to make you one of the\nagents of that providence.' The bargain was concluded. I may sacrifice\nmy soul, but what matters it?\" added Monte Cristo. \"If the thing were\nto do again, I would again do it.\" Villefort looked at Monte Cristo with\nextreme amazement. \"Count,\" he inquired, \"have you any relations?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I am alone in the world.\"\n\n\"So much the worse.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down\nyour pride. You say you fear nothing but death?\"\n\n\"I did not say that I feared it; I only said that death alone could\ncheck the execution of my plans.\"\n\n\"And old age?\"\n\n\"My end will be achieved before I grow old.\"\n\n\"And madness?\"\n\n\"I have been nearly mad; and you know the axiom,--non bis in idem. It\nis an axiom of criminal law, and, consequently, you understand its full\napplication.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" continued Villefort, \"there is something to fear besides\ndeath, old age, and madness. For instance, there is apoplexy--that\nlightning-stroke which strikes but does not destroy you, and yet which\nbrings everything to an end. You are still yourself as now, and yet you\nare yourself no longer; you who, like Ariel, verge on the angelic, are\nbut an inert mass, which, like Caliban, verges on the brutal; and this\nis called in human tongues, as I tell you, neither more nor less than\napoplexy. Come, if so you will, count, and continue this conversation\nat my house, any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of\nunderstanding and anxious to refute you, and I will show you my father,\nM. Noirtier de Villefort, one of the most fiery Jacobins of the French\nRevolution; that is to say, he had the most remarkable audacity,\nseconded by a most powerful organization--a man who has not, perhaps,\nlike yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth, but who has helped to\noverturn one of the greatest; in fact, a man who believed himself,\nlike you, one of the envoys, not of God, but of a supreme being; not of\nprovidence, but of fate. Well, sir, the rupture of a blood-vessel on the\nlobe of the brain has destroyed all this, not in a day, not in an hour,\nbut in a second. M. Noirtier, who, on the previous night, was the old\nJacobin, the old senator, the old Carbonaro, laughing at the guillotine,\nthe cannon, and the dagger--M. Noirtier, playing with revolutions--M.\nNoirtier, for whom France was a vast chess-board, from which pawns,\nrooks, knights, and queens were to disappear, so that the king was\ncheckmated--M. Noirtier, the redoubtable, was the next morning 'poor M.\nNoirtier,' the helpless old man, at the tender mercies of the weakest\ncreature in the household, that is, his grandchild, Valentine; a dumb\nand frozen carcass, in fact, living painlessly on, that time may be\ngiven for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its\ndecay.\"\n\n\"Alas, sir,\" said Monte Cristo \"this spectacle is neither strange to\nmy eye nor my thought. I am something of a physician, and have, like\nmy fellows, sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead\nmatter; yet, like providence, it has remained invisible to my eyes,\nalthough present to my heart. A hundred writers since Socrates, Seneca,\nSt. Augustine, and Gall, have made, in verse and prose, the comparison\nyou have made, and yet I can well understand that a father's sufferings\nmay effect great changes in the mind of a son. I will call on you,\nsir, since you bid me contemplate, for the advantage of my pride, this\nterrible spectacle, which must have been so great a source of sorrow to\nyour family.\"\n\n\"It would have been so unquestionably, had not God given me so large a\ncompensation. In contrast with the old man, who is dragging his way\nto the tomb, are two children just entering into life--Valentine,\nthe daughter by my first wife--Mademoiselle Renee de Saint-Meran--and\nEdward, the boy whose life you have this day saved.\"\n\n\"And what is your deduction from this compensation, sir?\" inquired Monte\nCristo.\n\n\"My deduction is,\" replied Villefort, \"that my father, led away by his\npassions, has committed some fault unknown to human justice, but marked\nby the justice of God. That God, desirous in his mercy to punish but\none person, has visited this justice on him alone.\" Monte Cristo with a\nsmile on his lips, uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would\nhave made Villefort fly had he but heard it. \"Adieu, sir,\" said the\nmagistrate, who had risen from his seat; \"I leave you, bearing a\nremembrance of you--a remembrance of esteem, which I hope will not be\ndisagreeable to you when you know me better; for I am not a man to bore\nmy friends, as you will learn. Besides, you have made an eternal friend\nof Madame de Villefort.\" The count bowed, and contented himself with\nseeing Villefort to the door of his cabinet, the procureur being\nescorted to his carriage by two footmen, who, on a signal from their\nmaster, followed him with every mark of attention. When he had gone,\nMonte Cristo breathed a profound sigh, and said,--\"Enough of this\npoison, let me now seek the antidote.\" Then sounding his bell, he said\nto Ali, who entered, \"I am going to madam's chamber--have the carriage\nready at one o'clock.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 49. Haidee.\n\nIt will be recollected that the new, or rather old, acquaintances of the\nCount of Monte Cristo, residing in the Rue Meslay, were no other than\nMaximilian, Julie, and Emmanuel. The very anticipations of delight to\nbe enjoyed in his forthcoming visits--the bright, pure gleam of heavenly\nhappiness it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had\nvoluntarily engaged, illumined his whole countenance with a look of\nineffable joy and calmness, as, immediately after Villefort's departure,\nhis thoughts flew back to the cheering prospect before him, of tasting,\nat least, a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his\nmind. Even Ali, who had hastened to obey the Count's summons, went forth\nfrom his master's presence in charmed amazement at the unusual animation\nand pleasure depicted on features ordinarily so stern and cold; while,\nas though dreading to put to flight the agreeable ideas hovering over\nhis patron's meditations, whatever they were, the faithful Nubian walked\non tiptoe towards the door, holding his breath, lest its faintest sound\nshould dissipate his master's happy reverie.\n\nIt was noon, and Monte Cristo had set apart one hour to be passed in the\napartments of Haidee, as though his oppressed spirit could not all at\nonce admit the feeling of pure and unmixed joy, but required a gradual\nsuccession of calm and gentle emotions to prepare his mind to receive\nfull and perfect happiness, in the same manner as ordinary natures\ndemand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent\nsensations. The young Greek, as we have already said, occupied\napartments wholly unconnected with those of the count. The rooms had\nbeen fitted up in strict accordance with Oriental ideas; the floors were\ncovered with the richest carpets Turkey could produce; the walls hung\nwith brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture; while\naround each chamber luxurious divans were placed, with piles of soft and\nyielding cushions, that needed only to be arranged at the pleasure or\nconvenience of such as sought repose. Haidee had three French maids,\nand one who was a Greek. The first three remained constantly in a small\nwaiting-room, ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell, or to\nreceive the orders of the Romaic slave, who knew just enough French\nto be able to transmit her mistress's wishes to the three other\nwaiting-women; the latter had received most peremptory instructions from\nMonte Cristo to treat Haidee with all the deference they would observe\nto a queen.\n\nThe young girl herself generally passed her time in the chamber at the\nfarther end of her apartments. This was a sort of boudoir, circular,\nand lighted only from the roof, which consisted of rose-colored glass.\nHaidee was reclining upon soft downy cushions, covered with blue satin\nspotted with silver; her head, supported by one of her exquisitely\nmoulded arms, rested on the divan immediately behind her, while the\nother was employed in adjusting to her lips the coral tube of a rich\nnarghile, through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its\npassage through perfumed water. Her attitude, though perfectly natural\nfor an Eastern woman would, in a European, have been deemed too full\nof coquettish straining after effect. Her dress, which was that of\nthe women of Epirus, consisted of a pair of white satin trousers,\nembroidered with pink roses, displaying feet so exquisitely formed and\nso delicately fair, that they might well have been taken for Parian\nmarble, had not the eye been undeceived by their movements as they\nconstantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned\ntoes, beautifully ornamented with gold and pearls. She wore a blue and\nwhite-striped vest, with long open sleeves, trimmed with silver loops\nand buttons of pearls, and a sort of bodice, which, closing only from\nthe centre to the waist, exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and\nupper part of the bosom; it was fastened with three magnificent diamond\nclasps. The junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed\nby one of the many-colored scarfs, whose brilliant hues and rich silken\nfringe have rendered them so precious in the eyes of Parisian belles.\nTilted on one side of her head she had a small cap of gold-colored silk,\nembroidered with pearls; while on the other a purple rose mingled its\nglowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her hair, of which the\nblackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue. The extreme\nbeauty of the countenance, that shone forth in loveliness that mocked\nthe vain attempts of dress to augment it, was peculiarly and purely\nGrecian; there were the large, dark, melting eyes, the finely formed\nnose, the coral lips, and pearly teeth, that belonged to her race and\ncountry. And, to complete the whole, Haidee was in the very springtide\nand fulness of youthful charms--she had not yet numbered more than\ntwenty summers.\n\nMonte Cristo summoned the Greek attendant, and bade her inquire whether\nit would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his visit. Haidee's\nonly reply was to direct her servant by a sign to withdraw the\ntapestried curtain that hung before the door of her boudoir, the\nframework of the opening thus made serving as a sort of border to the\ngraceful tableau presented by the young girl's picturesque attitude and\nappearance. As Monte Cristo approached, she leaned upon the elbow of the\narm that held the narghile, and extending to him her other hand, said,\nwith a smile of captivating sweetness, in the sonorous language spoken\nby the women of Athens and Sparta, \"Why demand permission ere you enter?\nAre you no longer my master, or have I ceased to be your slave?\" Monte\nCristo returned her smile. \"Haidee,\" said he, \"you well know.\"\n\n\"Why do you address me so coldly--so distantly?\" asked the young Greek.\n\"Have I by any means displeased you? Oh, if so, punish me as you\nwill; but do not--do not speak to me in tones and manner so formal and\nconstrained.\"\n\n\"Haidee,\" replied the count, \"you know that you are now in France, and\nare free.\"\n\n\"Free to do what?\" asked the young girl.\n\n\"Free to leave me.\"\n\n\"Leave you? Why should I leave you?\"\n\n\"That is not for me to say; but we are now about to mix in society--to\nvisit and be visited.\"\n\n\"I don't wish to see anybody but you.\"\n\n\"And should you see one whom you could prefer, I would not be so\nunjust\"--\n\n\"I have never seen any one I preferred to you, and I have never loved\nany one but you and my father.\"\n\n\"My poor child,\" replied Monte Cristo, \"that is merely because your\nfather and myself are the only men who have ever talked to you.\"\n\n\"I don't want anybody else to talk to me. My father said I was his\n'joy'--you style me your 'love,'--and both of you have called me 'my\nchild.'\"\n\n\"Do you remember your father, Haidee?\" The young Greek smiled. \"He is\nhere, and here,\" said she, touching her eyes and her heart. \"And where\nam I?\" inquired Monte Cristo laughingly.\n\n\"You?\" cried she, with tones of thrilling tenderness, \"you are\neverywhere!\" Monte Cristo took the delicate hand of the young girl in\nhis, and was about to raise it to his lips, when the simple child\nof nature hastily withdrew it, and presented her cheek. \"You now\nunderstand, Haidee,\" said the count, \"that from this moment you are\nabsolutely free; that here you exercise unlimited sway, and are at\nliberty to lay aside or continue the costume of your country, as it may\nsuit your inclination. Within this mansion you are absolute mistress of\nyour actions, and may go abroad or remain in your apartments as may seem\nmost agreeable to you. A carriage waits your orders, and Ali and Myrtho\nwill accompany you whithersoever you desire to go. There is but one\nfavor I would entreat of you.\"\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"Guard carefully the secret of your birth. Make no allusion to the\npast; nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the names of your\nillustrious father or ill-fated mother.\"\n\n\"I have already told you, my lord, that I shall see no one.\"\n\n\"It is possible, Haidee, that so perfect a seclusion, though conformable\nwith the habits and customs of the East, may not be practicable in\nParis. Endeavor, then, to accustom yourself to our manner of living in\nthese northern climes as you did to those of Rome, Florence, Milan, and\nMadrid; it may be useful to you one of these days, whether you remain\nhere or return to the East.\" The young girl raised her tearful eyes\ntowards Monte Cristo as she said with touching earnestness, \"Whether we\nreturn to the East, you mean to say, my lord, do you not?\"\n\n\"My child,\" returned Monte Cristo \"you know full well that whenever we\npart, it will be no fault or wish of mine; the tree forsakes not the\nflower--the flower falls from the tree.\"\n\n\"My lord,\" replied Haidee, \"I never will leave you, for I am sure I\ncould not exist without you.\"\n\n\"My poor girl, in ten years I shall be old, and you will be still\nyoung.\"\n\n\"My father had a long white beard, but I loved him; he was sixty years\nold, but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths I saw.\"\n\n\"Then tell me, Haidee, do you believe you shall be able to accustom\nyourself to our present mode of life?\"\n\n\"Shall I see you?\"\n\n\"Every day.\"\n\n\"Then what do you fear, my lord?\"\n\n\"You might find it dull.\"\n\n\"No, my lord. In the morning, I shall rejoice in the prospect of your\ncoming, and in the evening dwell with delight on the happiness I have\nenjoyed in your presence; then too, when alone, I can call forth mighty\npictures of the past, see vast horizons bounded only by the towering\nmountains of Pindus and Olympus. Oh, believe me, that when three great\npassions, such as sorrow, love, and gratitude fill the heart, ennui can\nfind no place.\"\n\n\"You are a worthy daughter of Epirus, Haidee, and your charming and\npoetical ideas prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who\nclaim your country as their birthplace. Depend on my care to see\nthat your youth is not blighted, or suffered to pass away in ungenial\nsolitude; and of this be well assured, that if you love me as a father,\nI love you as a child.\"\n\n\"You are wrong, my lord. The love I have for you is very different from\nthe love I had for my father. My father died, but I did not die. If\nyou were to die, I should die too.\" The Count, with a smile of profound\ntenderness, extended his hand, and she carried it to her lips. Monte\nCristo, thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with Morrel\nand his family, departed, murmuring as he went these lines of Pindar,\n\"Youth is a flower of which love is the fruit; happy is he who, after\nhaving watched its silent growth, is permitted to gather and call it\nhis own.\" The carriage was prepared according to orders, and stepping\nlightly into it, the count drove off at his usual rapid pace.\n\n\n\nChapter 50. The Morrel Family.\n\nIn a very few minutes the count reached No. 7 in the Rue Meslay. The\nhouse was of white stone, and in a small court before it were two small\nbeds full of beautiful flowers. In the concierge that opened the gate\nthe count recognized Cocles; but as he had but one eye, and that eye\nhad become somewhat dim in the course of nine years, Cocles did not\nrecognize the count. The carriages that drove up to the door were\ncompelled to turn, to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of\nrockwork,--an ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole\nquarter, and had gained for the place the appellation of \"The Little\nVersailles.\" It is needless to add that there were gold and silver fish\nin the basin. The house, with kitchens and cellars below, had above\nthe ground-floor, two stories and attics. The whole of the property,\nconsisting of an immense workshop, two pavilions at the bottom of the\ngarden, and the garden itself, had been purchased by Emmanuel, who had\nseen at a glance that he could make of it a profitable speculation. He\nhad reserved the house and half the garden, and building a wall between\nthe garden and the workshops, had let them upon lease with the pavilions\nat the bottom of the garden. So that for a trifling sum he was as well\nlodged, and as perfectly shut out from observation, as the inhabitants\nof the finest mansion in the Faubourg St. Germain. The breakfast-room\nwas finished in oak; the salon in mahogany, and the furnishings were of\nblue velvet; the bedroom was in citronwood and green damask. There was\na study for Emmanuel, who never studied, and a music-room for Julie,\nwho never played. The whole of the second story was set apart for\nMaximilian; it was precisely similar to his sister's apartments, except\nthat for the breakfast-parlor he had a billiard-room, where he received\nhis friends. He was superintending the grooming of his horse, and\nsmoking his cigar at the entrance of the garden, when the count's\ncarriage stopped at the gate.\n\nCocles opened the gate, and Baptistin, springing from the box, inquired\nwhether Monsieur and Madame Herbault and Monsieur Maximilian Morrel\nwould see his excellency the Count of Monte Cristo. \"The Count of Monte\nCristo?\" cried Morrel, throwing away his cigar and hastening to the\ncarriage; \"I should think we would see him. Ah, a thousand thanks,\ncount, for not having forgotten your promise.\" And the young officer\nshook the count's hand so warmly, that Monte Cristo could not be\nmistaken as to the sincerity of his joy, and he saw that he had been\nexpected with impatience, and was received with pleasure. \"Come, come,\"\nsaid Maximilian, \"I will serve as your guide; such a man as you are\nought not to be introduced by a servant. My sister is in the garden\nplucking the dead roses; my brother is reading his two papers, the\nPresse and the Debats, within six steps of her; for wherever you see\nMadame Herbault, you have only to look within a circle of four yards\nand you will find M. Emmanuel, and 'reciprocally,' as they say at the\nPolytechnic School.\" At the sound of their steps a young woman of twenty\nto five and twenty, dressed in a silk morning gown, and busily engaged\nin plucking the dead leaves off a noisette rose-tree, raised her head.\nThis was Julie, who had become, as the clerk of the house of Thomson\n& French had predicted, Madame Emmanuel Herbault. She uttered a cry\nof surprise at the sight of a stranger, and Maximilian began to laugh.\n\"Don't disturb yourself, Julie,\" said he. \"The count has only been two\nor three days in Paris, but he already knows what a fashionable woman of\nthe Marais is, and if he does not, you will show him.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur,\" returned Julie, \"it is treason in my brother to bring\nyou thus, but he never has any regard for his poor sister. Penelon,\nPenelon!\" An old man, who was digging busily at one of the beds, stuck\nhis spade in the earth, and approached, cap in hand, striving to conceal\na quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek. A few locks of\ngray mingled with his hair, which was still thick and matted, while his\nbronzed features and determined glance well suited an old sailor who had\nbraved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics. \"I think\nyou hailed me, Mademoiselle Julie?\" said he. Penelon had still preserved\nthe habit of calling his master's daughter \"Mademoiselle Julie,\" and\nhad never been able to change the name to Madame Herbault. \"Penelon,\"\nreplied Julie, \"go and inform M. Emmanuel of this gentleman's visit,\nand Maximilian will conduct him to the salon.\" Then, turning to Monte\nCristo,--\"I hope you will permit me to leave you for a few minutes,\"\ncontinued she; and without awaiting any reply, disappeared behind a\nclump of trees, and escaped to the house by a lateral alley.\n\n\"I am sorry to see,\" observed Monte Cristo to Morrel, \"that I cause no\nsmall disturbance in your house.\"\n\n\"Look there,\" said Maximilian, laughing; \"there is her husband changing\nhis jacket for a coat. I assure you, you are well known in the Rue\nMeslay.\"\n\n\"Your family appears to be a very happy one,\" said the count, as if\nspeaking to himself.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I assure you, count, they want nothing that can render them\nhappy; they are young and cheerful, they are tenderly attached to each\nother, and with twenty-five thousand francs a year they fancy themselves\nas rich as Rothschild.\"\n\n\"Five and twenty thousand francs is not a large sum, however,\"\nreplied Monte Cristo, with a tone so sweet and gentle, that it went to\nMaximilian's heart like the voice of a father; \"but they will not be\ncontent with that. Your brother-in-law is a barrister? a doctor?\"\n\n\"He was a merchant, monsieur, and had succeeded to the business of my\npoor father. M. Morrel, at his death, left 500,000 francs, which were\ndivided between my sister and myself, for we were his only children. Her\nhusband, who, when he married her, had no other patrimony than his noble\nprobity, his first-rate ability, and his spotless reputation, wished to\npossess as much as his wife. He labored and toiled until he had amassed\n250,000 francs; six years sufficed to achieve this object. Oh, I assure\nyou, sir, it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures,\ndestined by their talents for higher stations, toiling together, and\nthrough their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their\npaternal house, taking six years to accomplish what less scrupulous\npeople would have effected in two or three. Marseilles resounded with\ntheir well-earned praises. At last, one day, Emmanuel came to his wife,\nwho had just finished making up the accounts. 'Julie,' said he to her,\n'Cocles has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred francs; that\ncompletes the 250,000 francs we had fixed as the limits of our gains.\nCan you content yourself with the small fortune which we shall possess\nfor the future? Listen to me. Our house transacts business to the amount\nof a million a year, from which we derive an income of 40,000 francs.\nWe can dispose of the business, if we please, in an hour, for I have\nreceived a letter from M. Delaunay, in which he offers to purchase\nthe good-will of the house, to unite with his own, for 300,000 francs.\nAdvise me what I had better do.'--'Emmanuel,' returned my sister, 'the\nhouse of Morrel can only be carried on by a Morrel. Is it not worth\n300,000 francs to save our father's name from the chances of evil\nfortune and failure?'--'I thought so,' replied Emmanuel; 'but I wished\nto have your advice.'--'This is my counsel:--Our accounts are made up\nand our bills paid; all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more,\nand close our office.' This was done instantly. It was three o'clock; at\na quarter past, a merchant presented himself to insure two ships; it was\na clear profit of 15,000. francs. 'Monsieur,' said Emmanuel, 'have\nthe goodness to address yourself to M. Delaunay. We have quitted\nbusiness.'--'How long?' inquired the astonished merchant. 'A quarter of\nan hour,' was the reply. And this is the reason, monsieur,\" continued\nMaximilian, \"of my sister and brother-in-law having only 25,000 francs a\nyear.\"\n\nMaximilian had scarcely finished his story, during which the count's\nheart had swelled within him, when Emmanuel entered wearing a hat and\ncoat. He saluted the count with the air of a man who is aware of the\nrank of his guest; then, after having led Monte Cristo around the little\ngarden, he returned to the house. A large vase of Japan porcelain,\nfilled with flowers that loaded the air with their perfume, stood in\nthe salon. Julie, suitably dressed, and her hair arranged (she had\naccomplished this feat in less than ten minutes), received the count on\nhis entrance. The songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by,\nand the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite\nframework to the blue velvet curtains. Everything in this charming\nretreat, from the warble of the birds to the smile of the mistress,\nbreathed tranquillity and repose. The count had felt the influence of\nthis happiness from the moment he entered the house, and he remained\nsilent and pensive, forgetting that he was expected to renew the\nconversation, which had ceased after the first salutations had been\nexchanged. The silence became almost painful when, by a violent effort,\ntearing himself from his pleasing reverie--\"Madame,\" said he at length,\n\"I pray you to excuse my emotion, which must astonish you who are only\naccustomed to the happiness I meet here; but contentment is so new a\nsight to me, that I could never be weary of looking at yourself and your\nhusband.\"\n\n\"We are very happy, monsieur,\" replied Julie; \"but we have also known\nunhappiness, and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than\nourselves.\" The Count's features displayed an expression of the most\nintense curiosity.\n\n\"Oh, all this is a family history, as Chateau-Renaud told you the other\nday,\" observed Maximilian. \"This humble picture would have but little\ninterest for you, accustomed as you are to behold the pleasures and the\nmisfortunes of the wealthy and industrious; but such as we are, we have\nexperienced bitter sorrows.\"\n\n\"And God has poured balm into your wounds, as he does into those of all\nwho are in affliction?\" said Monte Cristo inquiringly.\n\n\"Yes, count,\" returned Julie, \"we may indeed say he has, for he has done\nfor us what he grants only to his chosen; he sent us one of his angels.\"\nThe count's cheeks became scarlet, and he coughed, in order to have an\nexcuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth. \"Those born to wealth,\nand who have the means of gratifying every wish,\" said Emmanuel, \"know\nnot what is the real happiness of life, just as those who have been\ntossed on the stormy waters of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone\nrealize the blessings of fair weather.\"\n\nMonte Cristo rose, and without making any answer (for the tremulousness\nof his voice would have betrayed his emotion) walked up and down the\napartment with a slow step.\n\n\"Our magnificence makes you smile, count,\" said Maximilian, who had\nfollowed him with his eyes. \"No, no,\" returned Monte Cristo, pale as\ndeath, pressing one hand on his heart to still its throbbings, while\nwith the other he pointed to a crystal cover, beneath which a silken\npurse lay on a black velvet cushion. \"I was wondering what could be\nthe significance of this purse, with the paper at one end and the large\ndiamond at the other.\"\n\n\"Count,\" replied Maximilian, with an air of gravity, \"those are our most\nprecious family treasures.\"\n\n\"The stone seems very brilliant,\" answered the count.\n\n\"Oh, my brother does not allude to its value, although it has been\nestimated at 100,000 francs; he means, that the articles contained in\nthis purse are the relics of the angel I spoke of just now.\"\n\n\"This I do not comprehend; and yet I may not ask for an explanation,\nmadame,\" replied Monte Cristo bowing. \"Pardon me, I had no intention of\ncommitting an indiscretion.\"\n\n\"Indiscretion,--oh, you make us happy by giving us an excuse for\nexpatiating on this subject. If we wanted to conceal the noble action\nthis purse commemorates, we should not expose it thus to view. Oh, would\nwe could relate it everywhere, and to every one, so that the emotion of\nour unknown benefactor might reveal his presence.\"\n\n\"Ah, really,\" said Monte Cristo in a half-stifled voice.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" returned Maximilian, raising the glass cover, and\nrespectfully kissing the silken purse, \"this has touched the hand of a\nman who saved my father from suicide, us from ruin, and our name from\nshame and disgrace,--a man by whose matchless benevolence we poor\nchildren, doomed to want and wretchedness, can at present hear every\none envying our happy lot. This letter\" (as he spoke, Maximilian drew\na letter from the purse and gave it to the count)--\"this letter was\nwritten by him the day that my father had taken a desperate resolution,\nand this diamond was given by the generous unknown to my sister as\nher dowry.\" Monte Cristo opened the letter, and read it with an\nindescribable feeling of delight. It was the letter written (as our\nreaders know) to Julie, and signed \"Sinbad the Sailor.\" \"Unknown you\nsay, is the man who rendered you this service--unknown to you?\"\n\n\"Yes; we have never had the happiness of pressing his hand,\" continued\nMaximilian. \"We have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this\nfavor, but the whole affair has had a mysterious meaning that we\ncannot comprehend--we have been guided by an invisible hand,--a hand as\npowerful as that of an enchanter.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" cried Julie, \"I have not lost all hope of some day kissing that\nhand, as I now kiss the purse which he has touched. Four years ago,\nPenelon was at Trieste--Penelon, count, is the old sailor you saw in the\ngarden, and who, from quartermaster, has become gardener--Penelon, when\nhe was at Trieste, saw on the quay an Englishman, who was on the point\nof embarking on board a yacht, and he recognized him as the person\nwho called on my father the fifth of June, 1829, and who wrote me this\nletter on the fifth of September. He felt convinced of his identity, but\nhe did not venture to address him.\"\n\n\"An Englishman,\" said Monte Cristo, who grew uneasy at the attention\nwith which Julie looked at him. \"An Englishman you say?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Maximilian, \"an Englishman, who represented himself as\nthe confidential clerk of the house of Thomson & French, at Rome. It was\nthis that made me start when you said the other day, at M. de Morcerf's,\nthat Messrs. Thomson & French were your bankers. That happened, as\nI told you, in 1829. For God's sake, tell me, did you know this\nEnglishman?\"\n\n\"But you tell me, also, that the house of Thomson & French have\nconstantly denied having rendered you this service?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then is it not probable that this Englishman may be some one who,\ngrateful for a kindness your father had shown him, and which he himself\nhad forgotten, has taken this method of requiting the obligation?\"\n\n\"Everything is possible in this affair, even a miracle.\"\n\n\"What was his name?\" asked Monte Cristo.\n\n\"He gave no other name,\" answered Julie, looking earnestly at the count,\n\"than that at the end of his letter--'Sinbad the Sailor.'\"\n\n\"Which is evidently not his real name, but a fictitious one.\"\n\nThen, noticing that Julie was struck with the sound of his voice,--\n\n\"Tell me,\" continued he, \"was he not about my height, perhaps a little\ntaller, with his chin imprisoned, as it were, in a high cravat; his coat\nclosely buttoned up, and constantly taking out his pencil?\"\n\n\"Oh, do you then know him?\" cried Julie, whose eyes sparkled with joy.\n\n\"No,\" returned Monte Cristo \"I only guessed. I knew a Lord Wilmore, who\nwas constantly doing actions of this kind.\"\n\n\"Without revealing himself?\"\n\n\"He was an eccentric being, and did not believe in the existence of\ngratitude.\"\n\n\"Oh, heaven,\" exclaimed Julie, clasping her hands, \"in what did he\nbelieve, then?\"\n\n\"He did not credit it at the period which I knew him,\" said Monte\nCristo, touched to the heart by the accents of Julie's voice; \"but,\nperhaps, since then he has had proofs that gratitude does exist.\"\n\n\"And do you know this gentleman, monsieur?\" inquired Emmanuel.\n\n\"Oh, if you do know him,\" cried Julie, \"can you tell us where he\nis--where we can find him? Maximilian--Emmanuel--if we do but discover\nhim, he must believe in the gratitude of the heart!\" Monte Cristo felt\ntears start into his eyes, and he again walked hastily up and down the\nroom.\n\n\"In the name of heaven,\" said Maximilian, \"if you know anything of him,\ntell us what it is.\"\n\n\"Alas,\" cried Monte Cristo, striving to repress his emotion, \"if Lord\nWilmore was your unknown benefactor, I fear you will never see him\nagain. I parted from him two years ago at Palermo, and he was then on\nthe point of setting out for the most remote regions; so that I fear he\nwill never return.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur, this is cruel of you,\" said Julie, much affected; and the\nyoung lady's eyes swam with tears.\n\n\"Madame,\" replied Monte Cristo gravely, and gazing earnestly on the two\nliquid pearls that trickled down Julie's cheeks, \"had Lord Wilmore seen\nwhat I now see, he would become attached to life, for the tears you shed\nwould reconcile him to mankind;\" and he held out his hand to Julie, who\ngave him hers, carried away by the look and accent of the count. \"But,\"\ncontinued she, \"Lord Wilmore had a family or friends, he must have known\nsome one, can we not--\"\n\n\"Oh, it is useless to inquire,\" returned the count; \"perhaps, after all,\nhe was not the man you seek for. He was my friend: he had no secrets\nfrom me, and if this had been so he would have confided in me.\"\n\n\"And he told you nothing?\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"Nothing that would lead you to suppose?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"And yet you spoke of him at once.\"\n\n\"Ah, in such a case one supposes\"--\n\n\"Sister, sister,\" said Maximilian, coming to the count's aid, \"monsieur\nis quite right. Recollect what our excellent father so often told us,\n'It was no Englishman that thus saved us.'\" Monte Cristo started. \"What\ndid your father tell you, M. Morrel?\" said he eagerly.\n\n\"My father thought that this action had been miraculously performed--he\nbelieved that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us. Oh,\nit was a touching superstition, monsieur, and although I did not myself\nbelieve it, I would not for the world have destroyed my father's faith.\nHow often did he muse over it and pronounce the name of a dear friend--a\nfriend lost to him forever; and on his death-bed, when the near approach\nof eternity seemed to have illumined his mind with supernatural\nlight, this thought, which had until then been but a doubt, became\na conviction, and his last words were, 'Maximilian, it was Edmond\nDantes!'\" At these words the count's paleness, which had for some time\nbeen increasing, became alarming; he could not speak; he looked at his\nwatch like a man who has forgotten the hour, said a few hurried words\nto Madame Herbault, and pressing the hands of Emmanuel and\nMaximilian,--\"Madame,\" said he, \"I trust you will allow me to visit you\noccasionally; I value your friendship, and feel grateful to you for\nyour welcome, for this is the first time for many years that I have thus\nyielded to my feelings;\" and he hastily quitted the apartment.\n\n\"This Count of Monte Cristo is a strange man,\" said Emmanuel.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Maximilian, \"but I feel sure he has an excellent heart,\nand that he likes us.\"\n\n\"His voice went to my heart,\" observed Julie; \"and two or three times I\nfancied that I had heard it before.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 51. Pyramus and Thisbe.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the way along the Faubourg Saint-Honore, and in the\nrear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood,\nwhere the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design\nand magnificence of construction, extended a large garden, where the\nwide-spreading chestnut-trees raised their heads high above the walls in\na solid rampart, and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower\nof delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that\nstood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate,\nthat dated from the time of Louis XII. This noble entrance, however,\nin spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the\ngeraniums planted in the two vases, as they waved their variegated\nleaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom, had\nfallen into utter disuse. The proprietors of the mansion had many years\nbefore thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the\nhouse itself, with its thickly planted court-yard, opening into the\nFaubourg Saint-Honore, and to the garden shut in by this gate, which\nformerly communicated with a fine kitchen-garden of about an acre. For\nthe demon of speculation drew a line, or in other words projected a\nstreet, at the farther side of the kitchen-garden. The street was\nlaid out, a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate, but before\nconstruction was begun, it occurred to the possessor of the property\nthat a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted\nto fruits and vegetables, by building along the line of the proposed\nstreet, and so making it a branch of communication with the Faubourg\nSaint-Honore itself, one of the most important thoroughfares in the city\nof Paris.\n\nIn matters of speculation, however, though \"man proposes,\" \"money\ndisposes.\" From some such difficulty the newly named street died almost\nin birth, and the purchaser of the kitchen-garden, having paid a high\nprice for it, and being quite unable to find any one willing to take his\nbargain off his hands without a considerable loss, yet still clinging\nto the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that\nwould repay him, not only for his past outlay, but also the interest\nupon the capital locked up in his new acquisition, contented himself\nwith letting the ground temporarily to some market-gardeners, at a\nyearly rental of 500 francs. And so, as we have said, the iron gate\nleading into the kitchen-garden had been closed up and left to the rust,\nwhich bade fair before long to eat off its hinges, while to prevent the\nignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming\nto sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion, the gate\nhad been boarded up to a height of six feet. True, the planks were not\nso closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through\ntheir interstices; but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the\ninhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage\nwould be taken of that circumstance.\n\nHorticulture seemed, however, to have been abandoned in the deserted\nkitchen-garden; and where cabbages, carrots, radishes, pease, and melons\nhad once flourished, a scanty crop of lucerne alone bore evidence of its\nbeing deemed worthy of cultivation. A small, low door gave egress from\nthe walled space we have been describing into the projected street, the\nground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters, and\nhad now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not\neven the one-half per cent it had originally paid. Towards the house\nthe chestnut-trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall,\nwithout in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and\nflowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces, as\nthough asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air. At one\ncorner, where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day, a\nlarge stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered\nspot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant\nof the house, which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of\nverdure that partially concealed it, though situated but a hundred paces\noff.\n\nWhoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary\nof a walk, or as a place for meditation, was abundantly justified in\nthe choice by the absence of all glare, the cool, refreshing shade, the\nscreen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun, that found no\nentrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer, the\nincessant and melodious warbling of birds, and the entire removal from\neither the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion. On the\nevening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the\ninhabitants of Paris, might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone\nbench, a book, a parasol, and a work-basket, from which hung a partly\nembroidered cambric handkerchief, while at a little distance from these\narticles was a young woman, standing close to the iron gate, endeavoring\nto discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the\nplanks,--the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which\nshe seemed to seek the object of her wishes, proving how much her\nfeelings were interested in the matter. At that instant the little\nside-gate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly\nopened, and a tall, powerful young man appeared. He was dressed in a\ncommon gray blouse and velvet cap, but his carefully arranged hair,\nbeard and mustache, all of the richest and glossiest black, ill accorded\nwith his plebeian attire. After casting a rapid glance around him, in\norder to assure himself that he was unobserved, he entered by the small\ngate, and, carefully closing and securing it after him, proceeded with a\nhurried step towards the barrier.\n\nAt the sight of him she expected, though probably not in such a costume,\nthe young woman started in terror, and was about to make a hasty\nretreat. But the eye of love had already seen, even through the narrow\nchinks of the wooden palisades, the movement of the white robe, and\nobserved the fluttering of the blue sash. Pressing his lips close to the\nplanks, he exclaimed, \"Don't be alarmed, Valentine--it is I!\" Again the\ntimid girl found courage to return to the gate, saying, as she did so,\n\"And why do you come so late to-day? It is almost dinner-time, and I had\nto use no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful mother-in-law, my\ntoo-devoted maid, and my troublesome brother, who is always teasing me\nabout coming to work at my embroidery, which I am in a fair way never to\nget done. So pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me\nwait, and, after that, tell me why I see you in a dress so singular that\nat first I did not recognize you.\"\n\n\"Dearest Valentine,\" said the young man, \"the difference between our\nrespective stations makes me fear to offend you by speaking of my love,\nbut yet I cannot find myself in your presence without longing to pour\nforth my soul, and tell you how fondly I adore you. If it be but to\ncarry away with me the recollection of such sweet moments, I could even\nthank you for chiding me, for it leaves me a gleam of hope, that if\nyou did not expect me (and that indeed would be worse than vanity to\nsuppose), at least I was in your thoughts. You asked me the cause of my\nbeing late, and why I come disguised. I will candidly explain the reason\nof both, and I trust to your goodness to pardon me. I have chosen a\ntrade.\"\n\n\"A trade? Oh, Maximilian, how can you jest at a time when we have such\ndeep cause for uneasiness?\"\n\n\"Heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than\nlife itself! But listen to me, Valentine, and I will tell you all about\nit. I became weary of ranging fields and scaling walls, and seriously\nalarmed at the idea suggested by you, that if caught hovering about here\nyour father would very likely have me sent to prison as a thief. That\nwould compromise the honor of the French army, to say nothing of the\nfact that the continual presence of a captain of Spahis in a place\nwhere no warlike projects could be supposed to account for it might well\ncreate surprise; so I have become a gardener, and, consequently, adopted\nthe costume of my calling.\"\n\n\"What excessive nonsense you talk, Maximilian!\"\n\n\"Nonsense? Pray do not call what I consider the wisest action of my life\nby such a name. Consider, by becoming a gardener I effectually screen\nour meetings from all suspicion or danger.\"\n\n\"I beseech of you, Maximilian, to cease trifling, and tell me what you\nreally mean.\"\n\n\"Simply, that having ascertained that the piece of ground on which I\nstand was to let, I made application for it, was readily accepted by\nthe proprietor, and am now master of this fine crop of lucerne. Think\nof that, Valentine! There is nothing now to prevent my building myself\na little hut on my plantation, and residing not twenty yards from you.\nOnly imagine what happiness that would afford me. I can scarcely contain\nmyself at the bare idea. Such felicity seems above all price--as a thing\nimpossible and unattainable. But would you believe that I purchase all\nthis delight, joy, and happiness, for which I would cheerfully have\nsurrendered ten years of my life, at the small cost of 500 francs per\nannum, paid quarterly? Henceforth we have nothing to fear. I am on my\nown ground, and have an undoubted right to place a ladder against the\nwall, and to look over when I please, without having any apprehensions\nof being taken off by the police as a suspicious character. I may also\nenjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond, faithful, and\nunalterable affection, whenever you visit your favorite bower, unless,\nindeed, it offends your pride to listen to professions of love from the\nlips of a poor workingman, clad in a blouse and cap.\" A faint cry of\nmingled pleasure and surprise escaped from the lips of Valentine, who\nalmost instantly said, in a saddened tone, as though some envious cloud\ndarkened the joy which illumined her heart, \"Alas, no, Maximilian, this\nmust not be, for many reasons. We should presume too much on our\nown strength, and, like others, perhaps, be led astray by our blind\nconfidence in each other's prudence.\"\n\n\"How can you for an instant entertain so unworthy a thought, dear\nValentine? Have I not, from the first blessed hour of our acquaintance,\nschooled all my words and actions to your sentiments and ideas? And you\nhave, I am sure, the fullest confidence in my honor. When you spoke\nto me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger,\nI placed myself blindly and devotedly at your service, asking no other\nreward than the pleasure of being useful to you; and have I ever since,\nby word or look, given you cause of regret for having selected me from\nthe numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their lives for you?\nYou told me, my dear Valentine, that you were engaged to M. d'Epinay,\nand that your father was resolved upon completing the match, and that\nfrom his will there was no appeal, as M. de Villefort was never known\nto change a determination once formed. I kept in the background, as you\nwished, and waited, not for the decision of your heart or my own, but\nhoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf, and\norder events in our favor. But what cared I for delays or difficulties,\nValentine, as long as you confessed that you loved me, and took pity\non me? If you will only repeat that avowal now and then, I can endure\nanything.\"\n\n\"Ah, Maximilian, that is the very thing that makes you so bold, and\nwhich renders me at once so happy and unhappy, that I frequently\nask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my\nmother-in-law, and her blind preference for her own child, or to be,\nas I now am, insensible to any pleasure save such as I find in these\nmeetings, so fraught with danger to both.\"\n\n\"I will not admit that word,\" returned the young man; \"it is at once\ncruel and unjust. Is it possible to find a more submissive slave than\nmyself? You have permitted me to converse with you from time to\ntime, Valentine, but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or\nelsewhere--have I not obeyed? And since I found means to enter this\nenclosure to exchange a few words with you through this gate--to be\nclose to you without really seeing you--have I ever asked so much as to\ntouch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but\na trifle to one of my youth and strength? Never has a complaint or a\nmurmur escaped me. I have been bound by my promises as rigidly as any\nknight of olden times. Come, come, dearest Valentine, confess that what\nI say is true, lest I be tempted to call you unjust.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Valentine, as she passed the end of her slender\nfingers through a small opening in the planks, and permitted Maximilian\nto press his lips to them, \"and you are a true and faithful friend; but\nstill you acted from motives of self-interest, my dear Maximilian,\nfor you well knew that from the moment in which you had manifested an\nopposite spirit all would have been ended between us. You promised to\nbestow on me the friendly affection of a brother. For I have no friend\nbut yourself upon earth, who am neglected and forgotten by my father,\nharassed and persecuted by my mother-in-law, and left to the sole\ncompanionship of a paralyzed and speechless old man, whose withered hand\ncan no longer press mine, and who can speak to me with the eye alone,\nalthough there still lingers in his heart the warmest tenderness for\nhis poor grandchild. Oh, how bitter a fate is mine, to serve either as\na victim or an enemy to all who are stronger than myself, while my only\nfriend and supporter is a living corpse! Indeed, indeed, Maximilian, I\nam very miserable, and if you love me it must be out of pity.\"\n\n\"Valentine,\" replied the young man, deeply affected, \"I will not say\nyou are all I love in the world, for I dearly prize my sister and\nbrother-in-law; but my affection for them is calm and tranquil, in no\nmanner resembling what I feel for you. When I think of you my heart\nbeats fast, the blood burns in my veins, and I can hardly breathe; but\nI solemnly promise you to restrain all this ardor, this fervor and\nintensity of feeling, until you yourself shall require me to render\nthem available in serving or assisting you. M. Franz is not expected to\nreturn home for a year to come, I am told; in that time many favorable\nand unforeseen chances may befriend us. Let us, then, hope for the best;\nhope is so sweet a comforter. Meanwhile, Valentine, while reproaching me\nwith selfishness, think a little what you have been to me--the beautiful\nbut cold resemblance of a marble Venus. What promise of future\nreward have you made me for all the submission and obedience I have\nevinced?--none whatever. What granted me?--scarcely more. You tell me of\nM. Franz d'Epinay, your betrothed lover, and you shrink from the idea of\nbeing his wife; but tell me, Valentine, is there no other sorrow in your\nheart? You see me devoted to you, body and soul, my life and each warm\ndrop that circles round my heart are consecrated to your service; you\nknow full well that my existence is bound up in yours--that were I to\nlose you I would not outlive the hour of such crushing misery; yet you\nspeak with calmness of the prospect of your being the wife of another!\nOh, Valentine, were I in your place, and did I feel conscious, as you\ndo, of being worshipped, adored, with such a love as mine, a hundred\ntimes at least should I have passed my hand between these iron bars, and\nsaid, 'Take this hand, dearest Maximilian, and believe that, living\nor dead, I am yours--yours only, and forever!'\" The poor girl made no\nreply, but her lover could plainly hear her sobs and tears. A rapid\nchange took place in the young man's feelings. \"Dearest, dearest\nValentine,\" exclaimed he, \"forgive me if I have offended you, and forget\nthe words I spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain.\"\n\n\"No, Maximilian, I am not offended,\" answered she, \"but do you not see\nwhat a poor, helpless being I am, almost a stranger and an outcast in\nmy father's house, where even he is seldom seen; whose will has been\nthwarted, and spirits broken, from the age of ten years, beneath the\niron rod so sternly held over me; oppressed, mortified, and persecuted,\nday by day, hour by hour, minute by minute, no person has cared for,\neven observed my sufferings, nor have I ever breathed one word on the\nsubject save to yourself. Outwardly and in the eyes of the world, I am\nsurrounded by kindness and affection; but the reverse is the case. The\ngeneral remark is, 'Oh, it cannot be expected that one of so stern a\ncharacter as M. Villefort could lavish the tenderness some fathers do\non their daughters. What though she has lost her own mother at a tender\nage, she has had the happiness to find a second mother in Madame de\nVillefort.' The world, however, is mistaken; my father abandons me from\nutter indifference, while my mother-in-law detests me with a hatred so\nmuch the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual smile.\"\n\n\"Hate you, sweet Valentine,\" exclaimed the young man; \"how is it\npossible for any one to do that?\"\n\n\"Alas,\" replied the weeping girl, \"I am obliged to own that my\nmother-in-law's aversion to me arises from a very natural source--her\noverweening love for her own child, my brother Edward.\"\n\n\"But why should it?\"\n\n\"I do not know; but, though unwilling to introduce money matters into\nour present conversation, I will just say this much--that her extreme\ndislike to me has its origin there; and I much fear she envies me the\nfortune I enjoy in right of my mother, and which will be more than\ndoubled at the death of M. and Mme. de Saint-Meran, whose sole heiress\nI am. Madame de Villefort has nothing of her own, and hates me for being\nso richly endowed. Alas, how gladly would I exchange the half of this\nwealth for the happiness of at least sharing my father's love. God\nknows, I would prefer sacrificing the whole, so that it would obtain me\na happy and affectionate home.\"\n\n\"Poor Valentine!\"\n\n\"I seem to myself as though living a life of bondage, yet at the\nsame time am so conscious of my own weakness that I fear to break the\nrestraint in which I am held, lest I fall utterly helpless. Then, too,\nmy father is not a person whose orders may be infringed with impunity;\nprotected as he is by his high position and firmly established\nreputation for talent and unswerving integrity, no one could oppose him;\nhe is all-powerful even with the king; he would crush you at a word.\nDear Maximilian, believe me when I assure you that if I do not attempt\nto resist my father's commands it is more on your account than my own.\"\n\n\"But why, Valentine, do you persist in anticipating the worst,--why\npicture so gloomy a future?\"\n\n\"Because I judge it from the past.\"\n\n\"Still, consider that although I may not be, strictly speaking, what\nis termed an illustrious match for you, I am, for many reasons,\nnot altogether so much beneath your alliance. The days when such\ndistinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in\nFrance, and the first families of the monarchy have intermarried with\nthose of the empire. The aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with\nthe nobility of the cannon. Now I belong to this last-named class; and\ncertainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as\nwell as certain. My fortune, though small, is free and unfettered, and\nthe memory of my late father is respected in our country, Valentine, as\nthat of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city; I say our\ncountry, because you were born not far from Marseilles.\"\n\n\"Don't speak of Marseilles, I beg of you, Maximilian; that one word\nbrings back my mother to my recollection--my angel mother, who died too\nsoon for myself and all who knew her; but who, after watching over her\nchild during the brief period allotted to her in this world, now, I\nfondly hope, watches from her home in heaven. Oh, if my mother were\nstill living, there would be nothing to fear, Maximilian, for I would\ntell her that I loved you, and she would protect us.\"\n\n\"I fear, Valentine,\" replied the lover, \"that were she living I should\nnever have had the happiness of knowing you; you would then have been\ntoo happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a thought on me.\"\n\n\"Now it is you who are unjust, Maximilian,\" cried Valentine; \"but there\nis one thing I wish to know.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\" inquired the young man, perceiving that Valentine\nhesitated.\n\n\"Tell me truly, Maximilian, whether in former days, when our fathers\ndwelt at Marseilles, there was ever any misunderstanding between them?\"\n\n\"Not that I am aware of,\" replied the young man, \"unless, indeed, any\nill-feeling might have arisen from their being of opposite parties--your\nfather was, as you know, a zealous partisan of the Bourbons, while mine\nwas wholly devoted to the emperor; there could not possibly be any other\ndifference between them. But why do you ask?\"\n\n\"I will tell you,\" replied the young girl, \"for it is but right you\nshould know. Well, on the day when your appointment as an officer of the\nLegion of honor was announced in the papers, we were all sitting with my\ngrandfather, M. Noirtier; M. Danglars was there also--you recollect M.\nDanglars, do you not, Maximilian, the banker, whose horses ran away with\nmy mother-in-law and little brother, and very nearly killed them? While\nthe rest of the company were discussing the approaching marriage of\nMademoiselle Danglars, I was reading the paper to my grandfather; but\nwhen I came to the paragraph about you, although I had done nothing else\nbut read it over to myself all the morning (you know you had told me all\nabout it the previous evening), I felt so happy, and yet so nervous, at\nthe idea of speaking your name aloud, and before so many people, that\nI really think I should have passed it over, but for the fear that my\ndoing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my silence; so I\nsummoned up all my courage, and read it as firmly and as steadily as I\ncould.\"\n\n\"Dear Valentine!\"\n\n\"Well, would you believe it? directly my father caught the sound of your\nname he turned round quite hastily, and, like a poor silly thing, I was\nso persuaded that every one must be as much affected as myself by the\nutterance of your name, that I was not surprised to see my father start,\nand almost tremble; but I even thought (though that surely must have\nbeen a mistake) that M. Danglars trembled too.\"\n\n\"'Morrel, Morrel,' cried my father, 'stop a bit;' then knitting his\nbrows into a deep frown, he added, 'surely this cannot be one of the\nMorrel family who lived at Marseilles, and gave us so much trouble from\ntheir violent Bonapartism--I mean about the year 1815.'--'Yes,' replied\nM. Danglars, 'I believe he is the son of the old shipowner.'\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" answered Maximilian; \"and what did your father say then,\nValentine?\"\n\n\"Oh, such a dreadful thing, that I don't dare to tell you.\"\n\n\"Always tell me everything,\" said Maximilian with a smile.\n\n\"'Ah,' continued my father, still frowning, 'their idolized emperor\ntreated these madmen as they deserved; he called them 'food for powder,'\nwhich was precisely all they were good for; and I am delighted to see\nthat the present government have adopted this salutary principle with\nall its pristine vigor; if Algiers were good for nothing but to furnish\nthe means of carrying so admirable an idea into practice, it would be\nan acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain. Though it certainly\ndoes cost France somewhat dear to assert her rights in that uncivilized\ncountry.'\"\n\n\"Brutal politics, I must confess.\" said Maximilian; \"but don't attach\nany serious importance, dear, to what your father said. My father was\nnot a bit behind yours in that sort of talk. 'Why,' said he, 'does\nnot the emperor, who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of\nimproving the art of war, organize a regiment of lawyers, judges and\nlegal practitioners, sending them in the hottest fire the enemy could\nmaintain, and using them to save better men?' You see, my dear, that\nfor picturesque expression and generosity of spirit there is not much\nto choose between the language of either party. But what did M. Danglars\nsay to this outburst on the part of the procureur?\"\n\n\"Oh, he laughed, and in that singular manner so peculiar to\nhimself--half-malicious, half-ferocious; he almost immediately got up\nand took his leave; then, for the first time, I observed the agitation\nof my grandfather, and I must tell you, Maximilian, that I am the only\nperson capable of discerning emotion in his paralyzed frame. And I\nsuspected that the conversation that had been carried on in his presence\n(for they always say and do what they like before the dear old man,\nwithout the smallest regard for his feelings) had made a strong\nimpression on his mind; for, naturally enough, it must have pained him\nto hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that\ndepreciating manner.\"\n\n\"The name of M. Noirtier,\" interposed Maximilian, \"is celebrated\nthroughout Europe; he was a statesman of high standing, and you may\nor may not know, Valentine, that he took a leading part in every\nBonapartist conspiracy set on foot during the restoration of the\nBourbons.\"\n\n\"Oh, I have often heard whispers of things that seem to me most\nstrange--the father a Bonapartist, the son a Royalist; what can have\nbeen the reason of so singular a difference in parties and politics?\nBut to resume my story; I turned towards my grandfather, as though to\nquestion him as to the cause of his emotion; he looked expressively\nat the newspaper I had been reading. 'What is the matter, dear\ngrandfather?' said I, 'are you pleased?' He gave me a sign in the\naffirmative. 'With what my father said just now?' He returned a sign in\nthe negative. 'Perhaps you liked what M. Danglars said?' Another sign in\nthe negative. 'Oh, then, you were glad to hear that M. Morrel (I didn't\ndare to say Maximilian) had been made an officer of the Legion of\nHonor?' He signified assent; only think of the poor old man's being so\npleased to think that you, who were a perfect stranger to him, had been\nmade an officer of the Legion of Honor! Perhaps it was a mere whim on\nhis part, for he is falling, they say, into second childhood, but I love\nhim for showing so much interest in you.\"\n\n\"How singular,\" murmured Maximilian; \"your father hates me, while your\ngrandfather, on the contrary--What strange feelings are aroused by\npolitics.\"\n\n\"Hush,\" cried Valentine, suddenly; \"some one is coming!\" Maximilian\nleaped at one bound into his crop of lucerne, which he began to pull up\nin the most ruthless way, under the pretext of being occupied in weeding\nit.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, mademoiselle!\" exclaimed a voice from behind the trees.\n\"Madame is searching for you everywhere; there is a visitor in the\ndrawing-room.\"\n\n\"A visitor?\" inquired Valentine, much agitated; \"who is it?\"\n\n\"Some grand personage--a prince I believe they said--the Count of Monte\nCristo.\"\n\n\"I will come directly,\" cried Valentine aloud. The name of Monte Cristo\nsent an electric shock through the young man on the other side of the\niron gate, to whom Valentine's \"I am coming\" was the customary signal\nof farewell. \"Now, then,\" said Maximilian, leaning on the handle of his\nspade, \"I would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the\nCount of Monte Cristo is acquainted with M. de Villefort.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 52. Toxicology.\n\nIt was really the Count of Monte Cristo who had just arrived at Madame\nde Villefort's for the purpose of returning the procureur's visit,\nand at his name, as may be easily imagined, the whole house was in\nconfusion. Madame de Villefort, who was alone in her drawing-room when\nthe count was announced, desired that her son might be brought thither\ninstantly to renew his thanks to the count; and Edward, who heard this\ngreat personage talked of for two whole days, made all possible haste to\ncome to him, not from obedience to his mother, or out of any feeling of\ngratitude to the count, but from sheer curiosity, and that some chance\nremark might give him the opportunity for making one of the impertinent\nspeeches which made his mother say,--\"Oh, that naughty child! But I\ncan't be severe with him, he is really so bright.\"\n\nAfter the usual civilities, the count inquired after M. de Villefort.\n\"My husband dines with the chancellor,\" replied the young lady; \"he has\njust gone, and I am sure he'll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the\npleasure of seeing you before he went.\" Two visitors who were there\nwhen the count arrived, having gazed at him with all their eyes, retired\nafter that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity\nrequires. \"What is your sister Valentine doing?\" inquired Madame de\nVillefort of Edward; \"tell some one to bid her come here, that I may\nhave the honor of introducing her to the count.\"\n\n\"You have a daughter, then, madame?\" inquired the count; \"very young, I\npresume?\"\n\n\"The daughter of M. de Villefort by his first marriage,\" replied the\nyoung wife, \"a fine well-grown girl.\"\n\n\"But melancholy,\" interrupted Master Edward, snatching the feathers out\nof the tail of a splendid parroquet that was screaming on its gilded\nperch, in order to make a plume for his hat. Madame de Villefort merely\ncried,--\"Be still, Edward!\" She then added,--\"This young madcap is,\nhowever, very nearly right, and merely re-echoes what he has heard me\nsay with pain a hundred times; for Mademoiselle de Villefort is, in\nspite of all we can do to rouse her, of a melancholy disposition and\ntaciturn habit, which frequently injure the effect of her beauty. But\nwhat detains her? Go, Edward, and see.\"\n\n\"Because they are looking for her where she is not to be found.\"\n\n\"And where are they looking for her?\"\n\n\"With grandpapa Noirtier.\"\n\n\"And do you think she is not there?\"\n\n\"No, no, no, no, no, she is not there,\" replied Edward, singing his\nwords.\n\n\"And where is she, then? If you know, why don't you tell?\"\n\n\"She is under the big chestnut-tree,\" replied the spoiled brat, as he\ngave, in spite of his mother's commands, live flies to the parrot, which\nseemed keenly to relish such fare. Madame de Villefort stretched out her\nhand to ring, intending to direct her waiting-maid to the spot where she\nwould find Valentine, when the young lady herself entered the\napartment. She appeared much dejected; and any person who considered her\nattentively might have observed the traces of recent tears in her eyes.\n\nValentine, whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented\nto our readers without formally introducing her, was a tall and graceful\ngirl of nineteen, with bright chestnut hair, deep blue eyes, and that\nreposeful air of quiet distinction which characterized her mother.\nHer white and slender fingers, her pearly neck, her cheeks tinted with\nvarying hues reminded one of the lovely Englishwomen who have been so\npoetically compared in their manner to the gracefulness of a swan. She\nentered the apartment, and seeing near her stepmother the stranger of\nwhom she had already heard so much, saluted him without any girlish\nawkwardness, or even lowering her eyes, and with an elegance that\nredoubled the count's attention. He rose to return the salutation.\n\"Mademoiselle de Villefort, my daughter-in-law,\" said Madame de\nVillefort to Monte Cristo, leaning back on her sofa and motioning\ntowards Valentine with her hand. \"And M. de Monte Cristo, King of China,\nEmperor of Cochin-China,\" said the young imp, looking slyly towards his\nsister.\n\nMadame de Villefort at this really did turn pale, and was very nearly\nangry with this household plague, who answered to the name of Edward;\nbut the count, on the contrary, smiled, and appeared to look at the boy\ncomplacently, which caused the maternal heart to bound again with joy\nand enthusiasm.\n\n\"But, madame,\" replied the count, continuing the conversation, and\nlooking by turns at Madame de Villefort and Valentine, \"have I not\nalready had the honor of meeting yourself and mademoiselle before? I\ncould not help thinking so just now; the idea came over my mind, and\nas mademoiselle entered the sight of her was an additional ray of light\nthrown on a confused remembrance; excuse the remark.\"\n\n\"I do not think it likely, sir; Mademoiselle de Villefort is not very\nfond of society, and we very seldom go out,\" said the young lady.\n\n\"Then it was not in society that I met with mademoiselle or yourself,\nmadame, or this charming little merry boy. Besides, the Parisian world\nis entirely unknown to me, for, as I believe I told you, I have been in\nParis but very few days. No,--but, perhaps, you will permit me to call\nto mind--stay!\" The Count placed his hand on his brow as if to collect\nhis thoughts. \"No--it was somewhere--away from here--it was--I do not\nknow--but it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely\nsky and some religious fete; mademoiselle was holding flowers in her\nhand, the interesting boy was chasing a beautiful peacock in a garden,\nand you, madame, were under the trellis of some arbor. Pray come to my\naid, madame; do not these circumstances appeal to your memory?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" replied Madame de Villefort; \"and yet it appears to me,\nsir, that if I had met you anywhere, the recollection of you must have\nbeen imprinted on my memory.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the count saw us in Italy,\" said Valentine timidly.\n\n\"Yes, in Italy; it was in Italy most probably,\" replied Monte Cristo;\n\"you have travelled then in Italy, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"Yes; madame and I were there two years ago. The doctors, anxious for\nmy lungs, had prescribed the air of Naples. We went by Bologna, Perugia,\nand Rome.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes--true, mademoiselle,\" exclaimed Monte Cristo as if this simple\nexplanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought. \"It was\nat Perugia on Corpus Christi Day, in the garden of the Hotel des Postes,\nwhen chance brought us together; you, Madame de Villefort, and her son;\nI now remember having had the honor of meeting you.\"\n\n\"I perfectly well remember Perugia, sir, and the Hotel des Postes, and\nthe festival of which you speak,\" said Madame de Villefort, \"but in vain\ndo I tax my memory, of whose treachery I am ashamed, for I really do not\nrecall to mind that I ever had the pleasure of seeing you before.\"\n\n\"It is strange, but neither do I recollect meeting with you,\" observed\nValentine, raising her beautiful eyes to the count.\n\n\"But I remember it perfectly,\" interposed the darling Edward.\n\n\"I will assist your memory, madame,\" continued the count; \"the day had\nbeen burning hot; you were waiting for horses, which were delayed in\nconsequence of the festival. Mademoiselle was walking in the shade of\nthe garden, and your son disappeared in pursuit of the peacock.\"\n\n\"And I caught it, mamma, don't you remember?\" interposed Edward, \"and I\npulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail.\"\n\n\"You, madame, remained under the arbor; do you not remember, that while\nyou were seated on a stone bench, and while, as I told you, Mademoiselle\nde Villefort and your young son were absent, you conversed for a\nconsiderable time with somebody?\"\n\n\"Yes, in truth, yes,\" answered the young lady, turning very red, \"I do\nremember conversing with a person wrapped in a long woollen mantle; he\nwas a medical man, I think.\"\n\n\"Precisely so, madame; this man was myself; for a fortnight I had been\nat that hotel, during which period I had cured my valet de chambre of\na fever, and my landlord of the jaundice, so that I really acquired a\nreputation as a skilful physician. We discoursed a long time, madame, on\ndifferent subjects; of Perugino, of Raffaelle, of manners, customs, of\nthe famous aquatofana, of which they had told you, I think you said,\nthat certain individuals in Perugia had preserved the secret.\"\n\n\"Yes, true,\" replied Madame de Villefort, somewhat uneasily, \"I remember\nnow.\"\n\n\"I do not recollect now all the various subjects of which we discoursed,\nmadame,\" continued the count with perfect calmness; \"but I perfectly\nremember that, falling into the error which others had entertained\nrespecting me, you consulted me as to the health of Mademoiselle de\nVillefort.\"\n\n\"Yes, really, sir, you were in fact a medical man,\" said Madame de\nVillefort, \"since you had cured the sick.\"\n\n\"Moliere or Beaumarchais would reply to you, madame, that it was\nprecisely because I was not, that I had cured my patients; for myself,\nI am content to say to you that I have studied chemistry and the\nnatural sciences somewhat deeply, but still only as an amateur, you\nunderstand.\"--At this moment the clock struck six. \"It is six o'clock,\"\nsaid Madame de Villefort, evidently agitated. \"Valentine, will you not\ngo and see if your grandpapa will have his dinner?\" Valentine rose, and\nsaluting the count, left the apartment without speaking.\n\n\"Oh, madame,\" said the count, when Valentine had left the room, \"was it\non my account that you sent Mademoiselle de Villefort away?\"\n\n\"By no means,\" replied the young lady quickly; \"but this is the hour\nwhen we usually give M. Noirtier the unwelcome meal that sustains his\npitiful existence. You are aware, sir, of the deplorable condition of my\nhusband's father?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame, M. de Villefort spoke of it to me--a paralysis, I think.\"\n\n\"Alas, yes; the poor old gentleman is entirely helpless; the mind alone\nis still active in this human machine, and that is faint and flickering,\nlike the light of a lamp about to expire. But excuse me, sir, for\ntalking of our domestic misfortunes; I interrupted you at the moment\nwhen you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist.\"\n\n\"No, madame, I did not say as much as that,\" replied the count with a\nsmile; \"quite the contrary. I have studied chemistry because, having\ndetermined to live in eastern climates I have been desirous of following\nthe example of King Mithridates.\"\n\n\"Mithridates rex Ponticus,\" said the young scamp, as he tore some\nbeautiful portraits out of a splendid album, \"the individual who took\ncream in his cup of poison every morning at breakfast.\"\n\n\"Edward, you naughty boy,\" exclaimed Madame de Villefort, snatching\nthe mutilated book from the urchin's grasp, \"you are positively past\nbearing; you really disturb the conversation; go, leave us, and join\nyour sister Valentine in dear grandpapa Noirtier's room.\"\n\n\"The album,\" said Edward sulkily.\n\n\"What do you mean?--the album!\"\n\n\"I want the album.\"\n\n\"How dare you tear out the drawings?\"\n\n\"Oh, it amuses me.\"\n\n\"Go--go at once.\"\n\n\"I won't go unless you give me the album,\" said the boy, seating himself\ndoggedly in an arm-chair, according to his habit of never giving way.\n\n\"Take it, then, and pray disturb us no longer,\" said Madame de\nVillefort, giving the album to Edward, who then went towards the door,\nled by his mother. The count followed her with his eyes.\n\n\"Let us see if she shuts the door after him,\" he muttered. Madame de\nVillefort closed the door carefully after the child, the count appearing\nnot to notice her; then casting a scrutinizing glance around the\nchamber, the young wife returned to her chair, in which she seated\nherself. \"Allow me to observe, madame,\" said the count, with that kind\ntone he could assume so well, \"you are really very severe with that dear\nclever child.\"\n\n\"Oh, sometimes severity is quite necessary,\" replied Madame de\nVillefort, with all a mother's real firmness.\n\n\"It was his Cornelius Nepos that Master Edward was repeating when he\nreferred to King Mithridates,\" continued the count, \"and you interrupted\nhim in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no means neglected\nhim, for your son is really advanced for his years.\"\n\n\"The fact is, count,\" answered the mother, agreeably flattered, \"he has\ngreat aptitude, and learns all that is set before him. He has but one\nfault, he is somewhat wilful; but really, on referring for the moment\nto what he said, do you truly believe that Mithridates used these\nprecautions, and that these precautions were efficacious?\"\n\n\"I think so, madame, because I myself have made use of them, that I\nmight not be poisoned at Naples, at Palermo, and at Smyrna--that is to\nsay, on three several occasions when, but for these precautions, I must\nhave lost my life.\"\n\n\"And your precautions were successful?\"\n\n\"Completely so.\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember now your mentioning to me at Perugia something of this\nsort.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said the count with an air of surprise, remarkably well\ncounterfeited; \"I really did not remember.\"\n\n\"I inquired of you if poisons acted equally, and with the same effect,\non men of the North as on men of the South; and you answered me that the\ncold and sluggish habits of the North did not present the same aptitude\nas the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the South.\"\n\n\"And that is the case,\" observed Monte Cristo. \"I have seen Russians\ndevour, without being visibly inconvenienced, vegetable substances which\nwould infallibly have killed a Neapolitan or an Arab.\"\n\n\"And you really believe the result would be still more sure with us\nthan in the East, and in the midst of our fogs and rains a man\nwould habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this\nprogressive absorption of poison?\"\n\n\"Certainly; it being at the same time perfectly understood that he\nshould have been duly fortified against the poison to which he had not\nbeen accustomed.\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand that; and how would you habituate yourself, for\ninstance, or rather, how did you habituate yourself to it?\"\n\n\"Oh, very easily. Suppose you knew beforehand the poison that would\nbe made use of against you; suppose the poison was, for instance,\nbrucine\"--\n\n\"Brucine is extracted from the false angostura [*] is it not?\" inquired\nMadame de Villefort.\n\n\"Precisely, madame,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"but I perceive I have not\nmuch to teach you. Allow me to compliment you on your knowledge; such\nlearning is very rare among ladies.\"\n\n    * Brucoea ferruginea.\n\n\"Oh, I am aware of that,\" said Madame de Villefort; \"but I have a\npassion for the occult sciences, which speak to the imagination like\npoetry, and are reducible to figures, like an algebraic equation; but go\non, I beg of you; what you say interests me to the greatest degree.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Monte Cristo \"suppose, then, that this poison was\nbrucine, and you were to take a milligramme the first day, two\nmilligrammes the second day, and so on. Well, at the end of ten days you\nwould have taken a centigramme, at the end of twenty days, increasing\nanother milligramme, you would have taken three hundred centigrammes;\nthat is to say, a dose which you would support without inconvenience,\nand which would be very dangerous for any other person who had not taken\nthe same precautions as yourself. Well, then, at the end of a month,\nwhen drinking water from the same carafe, you would kill the person\nwho drank with you, without your perceiving, otherwise than from slight\ninconvenience, that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this\nwater.\"\n\n\"Do you know any other counter-poisons?\"\n\n\"I do not.\"\n\n\"I have often read, and read again, the history of Mithridates,\" said\nMadame de Villefort in a tone of reflection, \"and had always considered\nit a fable.\"\n\n\"No, madame, contrary to most history, it is true; but what you tell me,\nmadame, what you inquire of me, is not the result of a chance query, for\ntwo years ago you asked me the same questions, and said then, that for a\nvery long time this history of Mithridates had occupied your mind.\"\n\n\"True, sir. The two favorite studies of my youth were botany and\nmineralogy, and subsequently, when I learned that the use of simples\nfrequently explained the whole history of a people, and the entire life\nof individuals in the East, as flowers betoken and symbolize a love\naffair, I have regretted that I was not a man, that I might have been a\nFlamel, a Fontana, or a Cabanis.\"\n\n\"And the more, madame,\" said Monte Cristo, \"as the Orientals do not\nconfine themselves, as did Mithridates, to make a cuirass of his\npoisons, but they also made them a dagger. Science becomes, in their\nhands, not only a defensive weapon, but still more frequently an\noffensive one; the one serves against all their physical sufferings,\nthe other against all their enemies. With opium, belladonna, brucaea,\nsnake-wood, and the cherry-laurel, they put to sleep all who stand in\ntheir way. There is not one of those women, Egyptian, Turkish, or\nGreek, whom here you call 'good women,' who do not know how, by means of\nchemistry, to stupefy a doctor, and in psychology to amaze a confessor.\"\n\n\"Really,\" said Madame de Villefort, whose eyes sparkled with strange\nfire at this conversation.\n\n\"Oh, yes, indeed, madame,\" continued Monte Cristo, \"the secret dramas\nof the East begin with a love philtre and end with a death potion--begin\nwith paradise and end with--hell. There are as many elixirs of every\nkind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral\nnature of humanity; and I will say further--the art of these chemists\nis capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the\nremedy and the bane to yearnings for love or desires for vengeance.\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" remarked the young woman, \"these Eastern societies, in\nthe midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence, are\nas fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land. A man can\neasily be put out of the way there, then; it is, indeed, the Bagdad and\nBassora of the 'Thousand and One Nights.' The sultans and viziers who\nrule over society there, and who constitute what in France we call the\ngovernment, are really Haroun-al-Raschids and Giaffars, who not only\npardon a poisoner, but even make him a prime minister, if his crime has\nbeen an ingenious one, and who, under such circumstances, have the whole\nstory written in letters of gold, to divert their hours of idleness and\nennui.\"\n\n\"By no means, madame; the fanciful exists no longer in the East. There,\ndisguised under other names, and concealed under other costumes, are\npolice agents, magistrates, attorneys-general, and bailiffs. They\nhang, behead, and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible\nmanner; but some of these, like clever rogues, have contrived to escape\nhuman justice, and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning\nstratagems. Amongst us a simpleton, possessed by the demon of hate or\ncupidity, who has an enemy to destroy, or some near relation to dispose\nof, goes straight to the grocer's or druggist's, gives a false name,\nwhich leads more easily to his detection than his real one, and under\nthe pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping, purchases five or\nsix grammes of arsenic--if he is really a cunning fellow, he goes to\nfive or six different druggists or grocers, and thereby becomes only\nfive or six times more easily traced;--then, when he has acquired his\nspecific, he administers duly to his enemy, or near kinsman, a dose of\narsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst, and which, without\nrhyme or reason, makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire\nneighborhood. Then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables. They\nfetch a doctor, who opens the dead body, and collects from the entrails\nand stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon. Next day a hundred\nnewspapers relate the fact, with the names of the victim and the\nmurderer. The same evening the grocer or grocers, druggist or druggists,\ncome and say, 'It was I who sold the arsenic to the gentleman;' and\nrather than not recognize the guilty purchaser, they will recognize\ntwenty. Then the foolish criminal is taken, imprisoned, interrogated,\nconfronted, confounded, condemned, and cut off by hemp or steel; or if\nshe be a woman of any consideration, they lock her up for life. This\nis the way in which you Northerns understand chemistry, madame. Desrues\nwas, however, I must confess, more skilful.\"\n\n\"What would you have, sir?\" said the lady, laughing; \"we do what we can.\nAll the world has not the secret of the Medicis or the Borgias.\"\n\n\"Now,\" replied the count, shrugging his shoulders, \"shall I tell you the\ncause of all these stupidities? It is because, at your theatres, by what\nat least I could judge by reading the pieces they play, they see persons\nswallow the contents of a phial, or suck the button of a ring, and\nfall dead instantly. Five minutes afterwards the curtain falls, and the\nspectators depart. They are ignorant of the consequences of the murder;\nthey see neither the police commissary with his badge of office, nor the\ncorporal with his four men; and so the poor fools believe that the whole\nthing is as easy as lying. But go a little way from France--go either\nto Aleppo or Cairo, or only to Naples or Rome, and you will see people\npassing by you in the streets--people erect, smiling, and fresh-colored,\nof whom Asmodeus, if you were holding on by the skirt of his mantle,\nwould say, 'That man was poisoned three weeks ago; he will be a dead man\nin a month.'\"\n\n\"Then,\" remarked Madame de Villefort, \"they have again discovered the\nsecret of the famous aquatofana that they said was lost at Perugia.\"\n\n\"Ah, but madame, does mankind ever lose anything? The arts change about\nand make a tour of the world; things take a different name, and the\nvulgar do not follow them--that is all; but there is always the same\nresult. Poisons act particularly on some organ or another--one on the\nstomach, another on the brain, another on the intestines. Well, the\npoison brings on a cough, the cough an inflammation of the lungs, or\nsome other complaint catalogued in the book of science, which, however,\nby no means precludes it from being decidedly mortal; and if it were\nnot, would be sure to become so, thanks to the remedies applied by\nfoolish doctors, who are generally bad chemists, and which will act in\nfavor of or against the malady, as you please; and then there is a human\nbeing killed according to all the rules of art and skill, and of\nwhom justice learns nothing, as was said by a terrible chemist of my\nacquaintance, the worthy Abbe Adelmonte of Taormina, in Sicily, who has\nstudied these national phenomena very profoundly.\"\n\n\"It is quite frightful, but deeply interesting,\" said the young lady,\nmotionless with attention. \"I thought, I must confess, that these tales,\nwere inventions of the Middle Ages.\"\n\n\"Yes, no doubt, but improved upon by ours. What is the use of time,\nrewards of merit, medals, crosses, Monthyon prizes, if they do not lead\nsociety towards more complete perfection? Yet man will never be perfect\nuntil he learns to create and destroy; he does know how to destroy, and\nthat is half the battle.\"\n\n\"So,\" added Madame de Villefort, constantly returning to her object,\n\"the poisons of the Borgias, the Medicis, the Renes, the Ruggieris,\nand later, probably, that of Baron de Trenck, whose story has been so\nmisused by modern drama and romance\"--\n\n\"Were objects of art, madame, and nothing more,\" replied the count. \"Do\nyou suppose that the real savant addresses himself stupidly to the mere\nindividual? By no means. Science loves eccentricities, leaps and bounds,\ntrials of strength, fancies, if I may be allowed so to term them. Thus,\nfor instance, the excellent Abbe Adelmonte, of whom I spoke just now,\nmade in this way some marvellous experiments.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes; I will mention one to you. He had a remarkably fine garden, full\nof vegetables, flowers, and fruit. From amongst these vegetables he\nselected the most simple--a cabbage, for instance. For three days he\nwatered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic; on the third, the\ncabbage began to droop and turn yellow. At that moment he cut it. In the\neyes of everybody it seemed fit for table, and preserved its wholesome\nappearance. It was only poisoned to the Abbe Adelmonte. He then took the\ncabbage to the room where he had rabbits--for the Abbe Adelmonte had\na collection of rabbits, cats, and guinea-pigs, fully as fine as his\ncollection of vegetables, flowers, and fruit. Well, the Abbe Adelmonte\ntook a rabbit, and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage. The rabbit died.\nWhat magistrate would find, or even venture to insinuate, anything\nagainst this? What procureur has ever ventured to draw up an accusation\nagainst M. Magendie or M. Flourens, in consequence of the rabbits, cats,\nand guinea-pigs they have killed?--not one. So, then, the rabbit dies,\nand justice takes no notice. This rabbit dead, the Abbe Adelmonte has\nits entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill; on this\ndunghill is a hen, who, pecking these intestines, is in her turn taken\nill, and dies next day. At the moment when she is struggling in the\nconvulsions of death, a vulture is flying by (there are a good many\nvultures in Adelmonte's country); this bird darts on the dead fowl,\nand carries it away to a rock, where it dines off its prey. Three days\nafterwards, this poor vulture, which has been very much indisposed since\nthat dinner, suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the\nclouds, and falls heavily into a fish-pond. The pike, eels, and carp eat\ngreedily always, as everybody knows--well, they feast on the vulture.\nNow suppose that next day, one of these eels, or pike, or carp, poisoned\nat the fourth remove, is served up at your table. Well, then, your guest\nwill be poisoned at the fifth remove, and die, at the end of eight\nor ten days, of pains in the intestines, sickness, or abscess of the\npylorus. The doctors open the body and say with an air of profound\nlearning, 'The subject has died of a tumor on the liver, or of typhoid\nfever!'\"\n\n\"But,\" remarked Madame de Villefort, \"all these circumstances which\nyou link thus to one another may be broken by the least accident; the\nvulture may not see the fowl, or may fall a hundred yards from the\nfish-pond.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is where the art comes in. To be a great chemist in the\nEast, one must direct chance; and this is to be achieved.\"--Madame de\nVillefort was in deep thought, yet listened attentively. \"But,\"\nshe exclaimed, suddenly, \"arsenic is indelible, indestructible; in\nwhatsoever way it is absorbed, it will be found again in the body of the\nvictim from the moment when it has been taken in sufficient quantity to\ncause death.\"\n\n\"Precisely so,\" cried Monte Cristo--\"precisely so; and this is what I\nsaid to my worthy Adelmonte. He reflected, smiled, and replied to me by\na Sicilian proverb, which I believe is also a French proverb, 'My son,\nthe world was not made in a day--but in seven. Return on Sunday.' On\nthe Sunday following I did return to him. Instead of having watered his\ncabbage with arsenic, he had watered it this time with a solution of\nsalts, having their basis in strychnine, strychnos colubrina, as the\nlearned term it. Now, the cabbage had not the slightest appearance of\ndisease in the world, and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust; yet,\nfive minutes afterwards, the rabbit was dead. The fowl pecked at the\nrabbit, and the next day was a dead hen. This time we were the\nvultures; so we opened the bird, and this time all special symptoms had\ndisappeared, there were only general symptoms. There was no peculiar\nindication in any organ--an excitement of the nervous system--that was\nit; a case of cerebral congestion--nothing more. The fowl had not been\npoisoned--she had died of apoplexy. Apoplexy is a rare disease among\nfowls, I believe, but very common among men.\" Madame de Villefort\nappeared more and more thoughtful.\n\n\"It is very fortunate,\" she observed, \"that such substances could only\nbe prepared by chemists; otherwise, all the world would be poisoning\neach other.\"\n\n\"By chemists and persons who have a taste for chemistry,\" said Monte\nCristo carelessly.\n\n\"And then,\" said Madame de Villefort, endeavoring by a struggle, and\nwith effort, to get away from her thoughts, \"however skilfully it is\nprepared, crime is always crime, and if it avoid human scrutiny, it does\nnot escape the eye of God. The Orientals are stronger than we are in\ncases of conscience, and, very prudently, have no hell--that is the\npoint.\"\n\n\"Really, madame, this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure\nmind like yours, but which would easily yield before sound reasoning.\nThe bad side of human thought will always be defined by the paradox of\nJean Jacques Rousseau,--you remember,--the mandarin who is killed five\nhundred leagues off by raising the tip of the finger. Man's whole\nlife passes in doing these things, and his intellect is exhausted by\nreflecting on them. You will find very few persons who will go and\nbrutally thrust a knife in the heart of a fellow-creature, or will\nadminister to him, in order to remove him from the surface of the globe\non which we move with life and animation, that quantity of arsenic of\nwhich we just now talked. Such a thing is really out of rule--eccentric\nor stupid. To attain such a point, the blood must be heated to\nthirty-six degrees, the pulse be, at least, at ninety, and the\nfeelings excited beyond the ordinary limit. But suppose one pass, as is\npermissible in philology, from the word itself to its softened synonym,\nthen, instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an\n'elimination;' you merely and simply remove from your path the\nindividual who is in your way, and that without shock or violence,\nwithout the display of the sufferings which, in the case of becoming a\npunishment, make a martyr of the victim, and a butcher, in every sense\nof the word, of him who inflicts them. Then there will be no blood, no\ngroans, no convulsions, and above all, no consciousness of that horrid\nand compromising moment of accomplishing the act,--then one escapes the\nclutch of the human law, which says, 'Do not disturb society!' This\nis the mode in which they manage these things, and succeed in Eastern\nclimes, where there are grave and phlegmatic persons who care very\nlittle for the questions of time in conjunctures of importance.\"\n\n\"Yet conscience remains,\" remarked Madame de Villefort in an agitated\nvoice, and with a stifled sigh.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Monte Cristo \"happily, yes, conscience does remain; and\nif it did not, how wretched we should be! After every action requiring\nexertion, it is conscience that saves us, for it supplies us with a\nthousand good excuses, of which we alone are judges; and these reasons,\nhowsoever excellent in producing sleep, would avail us but very little\nbefore a tribunal, when we were tried for our lives. Thus Richard\nIII., for instance, was marvellously served by his conscience after the\nputting away of the two children of Edward IV.; in fact, he could say,\n'These two children of a cruel and persecuting king, who have inherited\nthe vices of their father, which I alone could perceive in their\njuvenile propensities--these two children are impediments in my way of\npromoting the happiness of the English people, whose unhappiness they\n(the children) would infallibly have caused.' Thus was Lady Macbeth\nserved by her conscience, when she sought to give her son, and not her\nhusband (whatever Shakespeare may say), a throne. Ah, maternal love is a\ngreat virtue, a powerful motive--so powerful that it excuses a multitude\nof things, even if, after Duncan's death, Lady Macbeth had been at all\npricked by her conscience.\"\n\nMadame de Villefort listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and\nhorrible paradoxes, delivered by the count with that ironical simplicity\nwhich was peculiar to him. After a moment's silence, the lady inquired,\n\"Do you know, my dear count,\" she said, \"that you are a very terrible\nreasoner, and that you look at the world through a somewhat distempered\nmedium? Have you really measured the world by scrutinies, or through\nalembics and crucibles? For you must indeed be a great chemist, and the\nelixir you administered to my son, which recalled him to life almost\ninstantaneously\"--\n\n\"Oh, do not place any reliance on that, madame; one drop of that elixir\nsufficed to recall life to a dying child, but three drops would have\nimpelled the blood into his lungs in such a way as to have produced\nmost violent palpitations; six would have suspended his respiration, and\ncaused syncope more serious than that in which he was; ten would have\ndestroyed him. You know, madame, how suddenly I snatched him from those\nphials which he so imprudently touched?\"\n\n\"Is it then so terrible a poison?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. In the first place, let us agree that the word poison does\nnot exist, because in medicine use is made of the most violent poisons,\nwhich become, according as they are employed, most salutary remedies.\"\n\n\"What, then, is it?\"\n\n\"A skilful preparation of my friend's the worthy Abbe Adelmonte, who\ntaught me the use of it.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" observed Madame de Villefort, \"it must be an admirable\nanti-spasmodic.\"\n\n\"Perfect, madame, as you have seen,\" replied the count; \"and I\nfrequently make use of it--with all possible prudence though, be it\nobserved,\" he added with a smile of intelligence.\n\n\"Most assuredly,\" responded Madame de Villefort in the same tone. \"As\nfor me, so nervous, and so subject to fainting fits, I should require\na Doctor Adelmonte to invent for me some means of breathing freely and\ntranquillizing my mind, in the fear I have of dying some fine day of\nsuffocation. In the meanwhile, as the thing is difficult to find in\nFrance, and your abbe is not probably disposed to make a journey\nto Paris on my account, I must continue to use Monsieur Planche's\nanti-spasmodics; and mint and Hoffman's drops are among my favorite\nremedies. Here are some lozenges which I have made up on purpose; they\nare compounded doubly strong.\" Monte Cristo opened the tortoise-shell\nbox, which the lady presented to him, and inhaled the odor of the\nlozenges with the air of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their\ncomposition. \"They are indeed exquisite,\" he said; \"but as they are\nnecessarily submitted to the process of deglutition--a function which it\nis frequently impossible for a fainting person to accomplish--I prefer\nmy own specific.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, and so should I prefer it, after the effects I have seen\nproduced; but of course it is a secret, and I am not so indiscreet as to\nask it of you.\"\n\n\"But I,\" said Monte Cristo, rising as he spoke--\"I am gallant enough to\noffer it you.\"\n\n\"How kind you are.\"\n\n\"Only remember one thing--a small dose is a remedy, a large one is\npoison. One drop will restore life, as you have seen; five or six will\ninevitably kill, and in a way the more terrible inasmuch as, poured into\na glass of wine, it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor.\nBut I say no more, madame; it is really as if I were prescribing for\nyou.\" The clock struck half-past six, and a lady was announced, a friend\nof Madame de Villefort, who came to dine with her.\n\n\"If I had had the honor of seeing you for the third or fourth time,\ncount, instead of only for the second,\" said Madame de Villefort; \"if\nI had had the honor of being your friend, instead of only having the\nhappiness of being under an obligation to you, I should insist on\ndetaining you to dinner, and not allow myself to be daunted by a first\nrefusal.\"\n\n\"A thousand thanks, madame,\" replied Monte Cristo \"but I have an\nengagement which I cannot break. I have promised to escort to the\nAcademie a Greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your\ngrand opera, and who relies on me to conduct her thither.\"\n\n\"Adieu, then, sir, and do not forget the prescription.\"\n\n\"Ah, in truth, madame, to do that I must forget the hour's conversation\nI have had with you, which is indeed impossible.\" Monte Cristo bowed,\nand left the house. Madame de Villefort remained immersed in thought.\n\"He is a very strange man,\" she said, \"and in my opinion is himself the\nAdelmonte he talks about.\" As to Monte Cristo the result had surpassed\nhis utmost expectations. \"Good,\" said he, as he went away; \"this is a\nfruitful soil, and I feel certain that the seed sown will not be cast\non barren ground.\" Next morning, faithful to his promise, he sent the\nprescription requested.\n\n\n\nChapter 53. Robert le Diable.\n\nThe pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible, as\nthere chanced to be on that very night a more than ordinary attraction\nat the Academie Royale. Levasseur, who had been suffering under severe\nillness, made his reappearance in the character of Bertrand, and, as\nusual, the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite\ncomposer of the day had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience.\nMorcerf, like most other young men of rank and fortune, had his\norchestra stall, with the certainty of always finding a seat in at least\na dozen of the principal boxes occupied by persons of his acquaintance;\nhe had, moreover, his right of entry into the omnibus box.\nChateau-Renaud rented a stall beside his own, while Beauchamp, as a\njournalist, had unlimited range all over the theatre. It happened that\non this particular night the minister's box was placed at the disposal\nof Lucien Debray, who offered it to the Comte de Morcerf, who again,\nupon his mother's rejection of it, sent it to Danglars, with an\nintimation that he should probably do himself the honor of joining the\nbaroness and her daughter during the evening, in the event of their\naccepting the box in question. The ladies received the offer with too\nmuch pleasure to dream of a refusal. To no class of persons is the\npresentation of a gratuitous opera-box more acceptable than to the\nwealthy millionaire, who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a\nking's ransom in his waistcoat pocket.\n\nDanglars had, however, protested against showing himself in a\nministerial box, declaring that his political principles, and his\nparliamentary position as member of the opposition party would not\npermit him so to commit himself; the baroness had, therefore, despatched\na note to Lucien Debray, bidding him call for them, it being wholly\nimpossible for her to go alone with Eugenie to the opera. There is no\ngainsaying the fact that a very unfavorable construction would have\nbeen put upon the circumstance if the two women had gone without escort,\nwhile the addition of a third, in the person of her mother's admitted\nlover, enabled Mademoiselle Danglars to defy malice and ill-nature. One\nmust take the world as one finds it.\n\nThe curtain rose, as usual, to an almost empty house, it being one of\nthe absurdities of Parisian fashion never to appear at the opera\nuntil after the beginning of the performance, so that the first act is\ngenerally played without the slightest attention being paid to it,\nthat part of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in\nobserving the fresh arrivals, while nothing is heard but the noise of\nopening and shutting doors, and the buzz of conversation. \"Surely,\" said\nAlbert, as the door of a box on the first circle opened, \"that must be\nthe Countess G----.\"\n\n\"And who is the Countess G----?\" inquired Chateau-Renaud.\n\n\"What a question! Now, do you know, baron, I have a great mind to pick a\nquarrel with you for asking it; as if all the world did not know who the\nCountess G---- was.\"\n\n\"Ah, to be sure,\" replied Chateau-Renaud; \"the lovely Venetian, is it\nnot?\"\n\n\"Herself.\" At this moment the countess perceived Albert, and\nreturned his salutation with a smile. \"You know her, it seems?\" said\nChateau-Renaud.\n\n\"Franz introduced me to her at Rome,\" replied Albert.\n\n\"Well, then, will you do as much for me in Paris as Franz did for you in\nRome?\"\n\n\"With pleasure.\"\n\nThere was a cry of \"Shut up!\" from the audience. This manifestation\non the part of the spectators of their wish to be allowed to hear the\nmusic, produced not the slightest effect on the two young men, who\ncontinued their conversation. \"The countess was present at the races in\nthe Champ-de-Mars,\" said Chateau-Renaud.\n\n\"To-day?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Bless me, I quite forgot the races. Did you bet?\"\n\n\"Oh, merely a paltry fifty louis.\"\n\n\"And who was the winner?\"\n\n\"Nautilus. I staked on him.\"\n\n\"But there were three races, were there not?\"\n\n\"Yes; there was the prize given by the Jockey Club--a gold cup, you\nknow--and a very singular circumstance occurred about that race.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up!\" again interposed some of the audience.\n\n\"Why, it was won by a horse and rider utterly unknown on the course.\"\n\n\"Is that possible?\"\n\n\"True as day. The fact was, nobody had observed a horse entered by the\nname of Vampa, or that of a jockey styled Job, when, at the last\nmoment, a splendid roan, mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist,\npresented themselves at the starting-post. They were obliged to stuff at\nleast twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider's pockets, to make\nhim weight; but with all that he outstripped Ariel and Barbare, against\nwhom he ran, by at least three whole lengths.\"\n\n\"And was it not found out at last to whom the horse and jockey\nbelonged?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You say that the horse was entered under the name of Vampa?\"\n\n\"Exactly; that was the title.\"\n\n\"Then,\" answered Albert, \"I am better informed than you are, and know\nwho the owner of that horse was.\"\n\n\"Shut up, there!\" cried the pit in chorus. And this time the tone and\nmanner in which the command was given, betokened such growing hostility\nthat the two young men perceived, for the first time, that the mandate\nwas addressed to them. Leisurely turning round, they calmly scrutinized\nthe various countenances around them, as though demanding some one\nperson who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they\ndeemed excessive impertinence; but as no one responded to the challenge,\nthe friends turned again to the front of the theatre, and affected\nto busy themselves with the stage. At this moment the door of the\nminister's box opened, and Madame Danglars, accompanied by her daughter,\nentered, escorted by Lucien Debray, who assiduously conducted them to\ntheir seats.\n\n\"Ha, ha,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"here comes some friends of yours,\nviscount! What are you looking at there? don't you see they are trying\nto catch your eye?\" Albert turned round, just in time to receive a\ngracious wave of the fan from the baroness; as for Mademoiselle Eugenie,\nshe scarcely vouchsafed to waste the glances of her large black eyes\neven upon the business of the stage. \"I tell you what, my dear fellow,\"\nsaid Chateau-Renaud, \"I cannot imagine what objection you can possibly\nhave to Mademoiselle Danglars--that is, setting aside her want of\nancestry and somewhat inferior rank, which by the way I don't think\nyou care very much about. Now, barring all that, I mean to say she is a\ndeuced fine girl!\"\n\n\"Handsome, certainly,\" replied Albert, \"but not to my taste, which I\nconfess, inclines to something softer, gentler, and more feminine.\"\n\n\"Ah, well,\" exclaimed Chateau-Renaud, who because he had seen his\nthirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a sort of\npaternal air with his more youthful friend, \"you young people are never\nsatisfied; why, what would you have more? your parents have chosen you\na bride built on the model of Diana, the huntress, and yet you are not\ncontent.\"\n\n\"No, for that very resemblance affrights me; I should have liked\nsomething more in the manner of the Venus of Milo or Capua; but this\nchase-loving Diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a sort\nof alarm lest she should some day bring on me the fate of Actaeon.\"\n\nAnd, indeed, it required but one glance at Mademoiselle Danglars to\ncomprehend the justness of Morcerf's remark--she was beautiful, but her\nbeauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious\ntaste; her hair was raven black, but its natural waves seemed somewhat\nrebellious; her eyes, of the same color as her hair, were surmounted by\nwell-arched brows, whose great defect, however, consisted in an almost\nhabitual frown, while her whole physiognomy wore that expression\nof firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler\nattributes of her sex--her nose was precisely what a sculptor would\nhave chosen for a chiselled Juno. Her mouth, which might have been found\nfault with as too large, displayed teeth of pearly whiteness, rendered\nstill more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her lips, contrasting\nvividly with her naturally pale complexion. But that which completed the\nalmost masculine look Morcerf found so little to his taste, was a dark\nmole, of much larger dimensions than these freaks of nature generally\nare, placed just at the corner of her mouth; and the effect tended\nto increase the expression of self-dependence that characterized her\ncountenance. The rest of Mademoiselle Eugenie's person was in perfect\nkeeping with the head just described; she, indeed, reminded one of\nDiana, as Chateau-Renaud observed, but her bearing was more haughty and\nresolute. As regarded her attainments, the only fault to be found with\nthem was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with\nher beauty, that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so\nyoung a person. She was a perfect linguist, a first-rate artist, wrote\npoetry, and composed music; to the study of the latter she professed to\nbe entirely devoted, following it with an indefatigable perseverance,\nassisted by a schoolfellow,--a young woman without fortune whose talent\npromised to develop into remarkable powers as a singer. It was rumored\nthat she was an object of almost paternal interest to one of the\nprincipal composers of the day, who excited her to spare no pains in the\ncultivation of her voice, which might hereafter prove a source of wealth\nand independence. But this counsel effectually decided Mademoiselle\nDanglars never to commit herself by being seen in public with one\ndestined for a theatrical life; and acting upon this principle, the\nbanker's daughter, though perfectly willing to allow Mademoiselle Louise\nd'Armilly (that was the name of the young virtuosa) to practice with\nher through the day, took especial care not to be seen in her company.\nStill, though not actually received at the Hotel Danglars in the light\nof an acknowledged friend, Louise was treated with far more kindness and\nconsideration than is usually bestowed on a governess.\n\nThe curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of Madame\nDanglars into her box, the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed\nhalf-hour's interval allowed between the acts, and the audience were\nleft at liberty to promenade the salon or lobbies, or to pay and receive\nvisits in their respective boxes. Morcerf and Chateau-Renaud were\namongst the first to avail themselves of this permission. For an instant\nthe idea struck Madame Danglars that this eagerness on the part of the\nyoung viscount arose from his impatience to join her party, and she\nwhispered her expectations to her daughter, that Albert was hurrying to\npay his respects to them. Mademoiselle Eugenie, however, merely returned\na dissenting movement of the head, while, with a cold smile, she\ndirected the attention of her mother to an opposite box on the first\ncircle, in which sat the Countess G----, and where Morcerf had just made\nhis appearance. \"So we meet again, my travelling friend, do we?\"\ncried the countess, extending her hand to him with all the warmth and\ncordiality of an old acquaintance; \"it was really very good of you to\nrecognize me so quickly, and still more so to bestow your first visit on\nme.\"\n\n\"Be assured,\" replied Albert, \"that if I had been aware of your arrival\nin Paris, and had known your address, I should have paid my respects\nto you before this. Allow me to introduce my friend, Baron de\nChateau-Renaud, one of the few true gentlemen now to be found in France,\nand from whom I have just learned that you were a spectator of the races\nin the Champ-de-Mars, yesterday.\" Chateau-Renaud bowed to the countess.\n\n\"So you were at the races, baron?\" inquired the countess eagerly.\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" pursued Madame G---- with considerable animation, \"you can\nprobably tell me who won the Jockey Club stakes?\"\n\n\"I am sorry to say I cannot,\" replied the baron; \"and I was just asking\nthe same question of Albert.\"\n\n\"Are you very anxious to know, countess?\" asked Albert.\n\n\"To know what?\"\n\n\"The name of the owner of the winning horse?\"\n\n\"Excessively; only imagine--but do tell me, viscount, whether you really\nare acquainted with it or no?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, madame, but you were about to relate some story,\nwere you not? You said, 'only imagine,'--and then paused. Pray\ncontinue.\"\n\n\"Well, then, listen. You must know I felt so interested in the splendid\nroan horse, with his elegant little rider, so tastefully dressed in\na pink satin jacket and cap, that I could not help praying for their\nsuccess with as much earnestness as though the half of my fortune were\nat stake; and when I saw them outstrip all the others, and come to the\nwinning-post in such gallant style, I actually clapped my hands with\njoy. Imagine my surprise, when, upon returning home, the first object\nI met on the staircase was the identical jockey in the pink jacket! I\nconcluded that, by some singular chance, the owner of the winning horse\nmust live in the same hotel as myself; but, as I entered my apartments,\nI beheld the very gold cup awarded as a prize to the unknown horse and\nrider. Inside the cup was a small piece of paper, on which were written\nthese words--'From Lord Ruthven to Countess G----.'\"\n\n\"Precisely; I was sure of it,\" said Morcerf.\n\n\"Sure of what?\"\n\n\"That the owner of the horse was Lord Ruthven himself.\"\n\n\"What Lord Ruthven do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, our Lord Ruthven--the Vampire of the Salle Argentino!\"\n\n\"Is it possible?\" exclaimed the countess; \"is he here in Paris?\"\n\n\"To be sure,--why not?\"\n\n\"And you visit him?--meet him at your own house and elsewhere?\"\n\n\"I assure you he is my most intimate friend, and M. de Chateau-Renaud\nhas also the honor of his acquaintance.\"\n\n\"But why are you so sure of his being the winner of the Jockey Club\nprize?\"\n\n\"Was not the winning horse entered by the name of Vampa?\"\n\n\"What of that?\"\n\n\"Why, do you not recollect the name of the celebrated bandit by whom I\nwas made prisoner?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"And from whose hands the count extricated me in so wonderful a manner?\"\n\n\"To be sure, I remember it all now.\"\n\n\"He called himself Vampa. You see, it's evident where the count got the\nname.\"\n\n\"But what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me?\"\n\n\"In the first place, because I had spoken much of you to him, as you may\nbelieve; and in the second, because he delighted to see a countrywoman\ntake so lively an interest in his success.\"\n\n\"I trust and hope you never repeated to the count all the foolish\nremarks we used to make about him?\"\n\n\"I should not like to affirm upon oath that I have not. Besides, his\npresenting you the cup under the name of Lord Ruthven\"--\n\n\"Oh, but that is dreadful! Why, the man must owe me a fearful grudge.\"\n\n\"Does his action appear like that of an enemy?\"\n\n\"No; certainly not.\"\n\n\"Well, then\"--\n\n\"And so he is in Paris?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And what effect does he produce?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Albert, \"he was talked about for a week; then the\ncoronation of the queen of England took place, followed by the theft of\nMademoiselle Mars's diamonds; and so people talked of something else.\"\n\n\"My good fellow,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"the count is your friend and\nyou treat him accordingly. Do not believe what Albert is telling you,\ncountess; so far from the sensation excited in the Parisian circles by\nthe appearance of the Count of Monte Cristo having abated, I take upon\nmyself to declare that it is as strong as ever. His first astounding\nact upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of horses, worth\n32,000 francs, to Madame Danglars; his second, the almost miraculous\npreservation of Madame de Villefort's life; now it seems that he has\ncarried off the prize awarded by the Jockey Club. I therefore maintain,\nin spite of Morcerf, that not only is the count the object of interest\nat this present moment, but also that he will continue to be so for a\nmonth longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which,\nafter all, may be his ordinary mode of existence.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" said Morcerf; \"meanwhile, who is in the Russian\nambassador's box?\"\n\n\"Which box do you mean?\" asked the countess.\n\n\"The one between the pillars on the first tier--it seems to have been\nfitted up entirely afresh.\"\n\n\"Did you observe any one during the first act?\" asked Chateau-Renaud.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"In that box.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the countess, \"it was certainly empty during the first\nact;\" then, resuming the subject of their previous conversation, she\nsaid, \"And so you really believe it was your mysterious Count of Monte\nCristo that gained the prize?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"And who afterwards sent the cup to me?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"But I don't know him,\" said the countess; \"I have a great mind to\nreturn it.\"\n\n\"Do no such thing, I beg of you; he would only send you another, formed\nof a magnificent sapphire, or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby. It is\nhis way, and you must take him as you find him.\" At this moment the\nbell rang to announce the drawing up of the curtain for the second act.\nAlbert rose to return to his place. \"Shall I see you again?\" asked the\ncountess. \"At the end of the next act, with your permission, I will come\nand inquire whether there is anything I can do for you in Paris?\"\n\n\"Pray take notice,\" said the countess, \"that my present residence is\n22 Rue de Rivoli, and that I am at home to my friends every Saturday\nevening. So now, you are both forewarned.\" The young men bowed, and\nquitted the box. Upon reaching their stalls, they found the whole of the\naudience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards\nthe box formerly possessed by the Russian ambassador. A man of from\nthirty-five to forty years of age, dressed in deep black, had just\nentered, accompanied by a young woman dressed after the Eastern style.\nThe lady was surpassingly beautiful, while the rich magnificence of her\nattire drew all eyes upon her. \"Hullo,\" said Albert; \"it is Monte Cristo\nand his Greek!\"\n\nThe strangers were, indeed, no other than the count and Haidee. In a few\nmoments the young girl had attracted the attention of the whole house,\nand even the occupants of the boxes leaned forward to scrutinize her\nmagnificent diamonds. The second act passed away during one continued\nbuzz of voices--one deep whisper--intimating that some great and\nuniversally interesting event had occurred; all eyes, all thoughts, were\noccupied with the young and beautiful woman, whose gorgeous apparel and\nsplendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle. Upon this occasion\nan unmistakable sign from Madame Danglars intimated her desire to see\nAlbert in her box directly the curtain fell on the second act, and\nneither the politeness nor good taste of Morcerf would permit his\nneglecting an invitation so unequivocally given. At the close of the act\nhe therefore went to the baroness. Having bowed to the two ladies, he\nextended his hand to Debray. By the baroness he was most graciously\nwelcomed, while Eugenie received him with her accustomed coldness.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Debray, \"you have come in the nick of time.\nThere is madame overwhelming me with questions respecting the count; she\ninsists upon it that I can tell her his birth, education, and parentage,\nwhere he came from, and whither he is going. Being no disciple of\nCagliostro, I was wholly unable to do this; so, by way of getting out\nof the scrape, I said, 'Ask Morcerf; he has got the whole history of\nhis beloved Monte Cristo at his fingers' ends;' whereupon the baroness\nsignified her desire to see you.\"\n\n\"Is it not almost incredible,\" said Madame Danglars, \"that a person\nhaving at least half a million of secret-service money at his command,\nshould possess so little information?\"\n\n\"Let me assure you, madame,\" said Lucien, \"that had I really the sum\nyou mention at my disposal, I would employ it more profitably than in\ntroubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the Count of Monte\nCristo, whose only merit in my eyes consists in his being twice as rich\nas a nabob. However, I have turned the business over to Morcerf, so pray\nsettle it with him as may be most agreeable to you; for my own part, I\ncare nothing about the count or his mysterious doings.\"\n\n\"I am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of horses worth\n32,000 francs, wearing on their heads four diamonds valued at 5,000\nfrancs each.\"\n\n\"He seems to have a mania for diamonds,\" said Morcerf, smiling, \"and I\nverily believe that, like Potemkin, he keeps his pockets filled, for\nthe sake of strewing them along the road, as Tom Thumb did his flint\nstones.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he has discovered some mine,\" said Madame Danglars. \"I suppose\nyou know he has an order for unlimited credit on the baron's banking\nestablishment?\"\n\n\"I was not aware of it,\" replied Albert, \"but I can readily believe it.\"\n\n\"And, further, that he stated to M. Danglars his intention of only\nstaying a year in Paris, during which time he proposed to spend six\nmillions.\n\n\"He must be the Shah of Persia, travelling incog.\"\n\n\"Have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young woman, M. Lucien?\"\ninquired Eugenie.\n\n\"I really never met with one woman so ready to do justice to the charms\nof another as yourself,\" responded Lucien, raising his lorgnette to his\neye. \"A most lovely creature, upon my soul!\" was his verdict.\n\n\"Who is this young person, M. de Morcerf?\" inquired Eugenie; \"does\nanybody know?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said Albert, replying to this direct appeal, \"I can give\nyou very exact information on that subject, as well as on most points\nrelative to the mysterious person of whom we are now conversing--the\nyoung woman is a Greek.\"\n\n\"So I should suppose by her dress; if you know no more than that, every\none here is as well-informed as yourself.\"\n\n\"I am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone,\" replied\nMorcerf, \"but I am reluctantly obliged to confess, I have nothing\nfurther to communicate--yes, stay, I do know one thing more, namely,\nthat she is a musician, for one day when I chanced to be breakfasting\nwith the count, I heard the sound of a guzla--it is impossible that it\ncould have been touched by any other finger than her own.\"\n\n\"Then your count entertains visitors, does he?\" asked Madame Danglars.\n\n\"Indeed he does, and in a most lavish manner, I can assure you.\"\n\n\"I must try and persuade M. Danglars to invite him to a ball or dinner,\nor something of the sort, that he may be compelled to ask us in return.\"\n\n\"What,\" said Debray, laughing; \"do you really mean you would go to his\nhouse?\"\n\n\"Why not? my husband could accompany me.\"\n\n\"But do you know this mysterious count is a bachelor?\"\n\n\"You have ample proof to the contrary, if you look opposite,\" said the\nbaroness, as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful Greek.\n\n\"No, no!\" exclaimed Debray; \"that girl is not his wife: he told us\nhimself she was his slave. Do you not recollect, Morcerf, his telling us\nso at your breakfast?\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said the baroness, \"if slave she be, she has all the air\nand manner of a princess.\"\n\n\"Of the 'Arabian Nights'?\"\n\n\"If you like; but tell me, my dear Lucien, what it is that constitutes a\nprincess. Why, diamonds--and she is covered with them.\"\n\n\"To me she seems overloaded,\" observed Eugenie; \"she would look far\nbetter if she wore fewer, and we should then be able to see her finely\nformed throat and wrists.\"\n\n\"See how the artist peeps out!\" exclaimed Madame Danglars. \"My poor\nEugenie, you must conceal your passion for the fine arts.\"\n\n\"I admire all that is beautiful,\" returned the young lady.\n\n\"What do you think of the count?\" inquired Debray; \"he is not much\namiss, according to my ideas of good looks.\"\n\n\"The count,\" repeated Eugenie, as though it had not occurred to her to\nobserve him sooner; \"the count?--oh, he is so dreadfully pale.\"\n\n\"I quite agree with you,\" said Morcerf; \"and the secret of that very\npallor is what we want to find out. The Countess G---- insists upon it\nthat he is a vampire.\"\n\n\"Then the Countess G---- has returned to Paris, has she?\" inquired the\nbaroness.\n\n\"Is that she, mamma?\" asked Eugenie; \"almost opposite to us, with that\nprofusion of beautiful light hair?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Madame Danglars, \"that is she. Shall I tell you what you\nought to do, Morcerf?\"\n\n\"Command me, madame.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you should go and bring your Count of Monte Cristo to us.\"\n\n\"What for?\" asked Eugenie.\n\n\"What for? Why, to converse with him, of course. Have you really no\ndesire to meet him?\"\n\n\"None whatever,\" replied Eugenie.\n\n\"Strange child,\" murmured the baroness.\n\n\"He will very probably come of his own accord,\" said Morcerf. \"There; do\nyou see, madame, he recognizes you, and bows.\" The baroness returned the\nsalute in the most smiling and graceful manner.\n\n\"Well,\" said Morcerf, \"I may as well be magnanimous, and tear myself\naway to forward your wishes. Adieu; I will go and try if there are any\nmeans of speaking to him.\"\n\n\"Go straight to his box; that will be the simplest plan.\"\n\n\"But I have never been presented.\"\n\n\"Presented to whom?\"\n\n\"To the beautiful Greek.\"\n\n\"You say she is only a slave?\"\n\n\"While you assert that she is a queen, or at least a princess. No; I\nhope that when he sees me leave you, he will come out.\"\n\n\"That is possible--go.\"\n\n\"I am going,\" said Albert, as he made his parting bow. Just as he was\npassing the count's box, the door opened, and Monte Cristo came forth.\nAfter giving some directions to Ali, who stood in the lobby, the count\ntook Albert's arm. Carefully closing the box door, Ali placed himself\nbefore it, while a crowd of spectators assembled round the Nubian.\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Monte Cristo, \"Paris is a strange city, and the\nParisians a very singular people. See that cluster of persons collected\naround poor Ali, who is as much astonished as themselves; really one\nmight suppose he was the only Nubian they had ever beheld. Now I can\npromise you, that a Frenchman might show himself in public, either in\nTunis, Constantinople, Bagdad, or Cairo, without being treated in that\nway.\"\n\n\"That shows that the Eastern nations have too much good sense to waste\ntheir time and attention on objects undeserving of either. However, as\nfar as Ali is concerned, I can assure you, the interest he excites is\nmerely from the circumstance of his being your attendant--you, who are\nat this moment the most celebrated and fashionable person in Paris.\"\n\n\"Really? and what has procured me so fluttering a distinction?\"\n\n\"What? why, yourself, to be sure! You give away horses worth a thousand\nlouis; you save the lives of ladies of high rank and beauty; under the\nname of Major Brack you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not\nlarger than marmots; then, when you have carried off the golden trophy\nof victory, instead of setting any value on it, you give it to the first\nhandsome woman you think of!\"\n\n\"And who has filled your head with all this nonsense?\"\n\n\"Why, in the first place, I heard it from Madame Danglars, who, by the\nby, is dying to see you in her box, or to have you seen there by others;\nsecondly, I learned it from Beauchamp's journal; and thirdly, from my\nown imagination. Why, if you sought concealment, did you call your horse\nVampa?\"\n\n\"That was an oversight, certainly,\" replied the count; \"but tell me,\ndoes the Count of Morcerf never visit the Opera? I have been looking for\nhim, but without success.\"\n\n\"He will be here to-night.\"\n\n\"In what part of the house?\"\n\n\"In the baroness's box, I believe.\"\n\n\"That charming young woman with her is her daughter?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I congratulate you.\" Morcerf smiled. \"We will discuss that subject at\nlength some future time,\" said he. \"But what do you think of the music?\"\n\n\"What music?\"\n\n\"Why, the music you have been listening to.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is well enough as the production of a human composer, sung by\nfeatherless bipeds, to quote the late Diogenes.\"\n\n\"From which it would seem, my dear count, that you can at pleasure enjoy\nthe seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise?\"\n\n\"You are right, in some degree; when I wish to listen to sounds more\nexquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to, I go\nto sleep.\"\n\n\"Then sleep here, my dear count. The conditions are favorable; what else\nwas opera invented for?\"\n\n\"No, thank you. Your orchestra is too noisy. To sleep after the manner\nI speak of, absolute calm and silence are necessary, and then a certain\npreparation\"--\n\n\"I know--the famous hashish!\"\n\n\"Precisely. So, my dear viscount, whenever you wish to be regaled with\nmusic come and sup with me.\"\n\n\"I have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you,\" said\nMorcerf.\n\n\"Do you mean at Rome?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Ah, then, I suppose you heard Haidee's guzla; the poor exile frequently\nbeguiles a weary hour in playing over to me the airs of her native\nland.\" Morcerf did not pursue the subject, and Monte Cristo himself fell\ninto a silent reverie. The bell rang at this moment for the rising of\nthe curtain. \"You will excuse my leaving you,\" said the count, turning\nin the direction of his box.\n\n\"What? Are you going?\"\n\n\"Pray, say everything that is kind to Countess G---- on the part of her\nfriend the Vampire.\"\n\n\"And what message shall I convey to the baroness!\"\n\n\"That, with her permission, I shall do myself the honor of paying my\nrespects in the course of the evening.\"\n\nThe third act had begun; and during its progress the Count of Morcerf,\naccording to his promise, made his appearance in the box of Madame\nDanglars. The Count of Morcerf was not a person to excite either\ninterest or curiosity in a place of public amusement; his presence,\ntherefore, was wholly unnoticed, save by the occupants of the box in\nwhich he had just seated himself. The quick eye of Monte Cristo however,\nmarked his coming; and a slight though meaning smile passed over his\nlips. Haidee, whose soul seemed centred in the business of the stage,\nlike all unsophisticated natures, delighted in whatever addressed itself\nto the eye or ear.\n\nThe third act passed off as usual. Mesdemoiselles Noblet, Julie, and\nLeroux executed the customary pirouettes; Robert duly challenged the\nPrince of Granada; and the royal father of the princess Isabella, taking\nhis daughter by the hand, swept round the stage with majestic strides,\nthe better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle.\nAfter which the curtain again fell, and the spectators poured forth from\nthe theatre into the lobbies and salon. The count left his box, and a\nmoment later was saluting the Baronne Danglars, who could not restrain\na cry of mingled pleasure and surprise. \"You are welcome, count!\" she\nexclaimed, as he entered. \"I have been most anxious to see you, that I\nmight repeat orally the thanks writing can so ill express.\"\n\n\"Surely so trifling a circumstance cannot deserve a place in your\nremembrance. Believe me, madame, I had entirely forgotten it.\"\n\n\"But it is not so easy to forget, monsieur, that the very next day\nafter your princely gift you saved the life of my dear friend, Madame\nde Villefort, which was endangered by the very animals your generosity\nrestored to me.\"\n\n\"This time, at least, I do not deserve your thanks. It was Ali, my\nNubian slave, who rendered this service to Madame de Villefort.\"\n\n\"Was it Ali,\" asked the Count of Morcerf, \"who rescued my son from the\nhands of bandits?\"\n\n\"No, count,\" replied Monte Cristo taking the hand held out to him by the\ngeneral; \"in this instance I may fairly and freely accept your thanks;\nbut you have already tendered them, and fully discharged your debt--if\nindeed there existed one--and I feel almost mortified to find you still\nreverting to the subject. May I beg of you, baroness, to honor me with\nan introduction to your daughter?\"\n\n\"Oh, you are no stranger--at least not by name,\" replied Madame\nDanglars, \"and the last two or three days we have really talked of\nnothing but you. Eugenie,\" continued the baroness, turning towards her\ndaughter, \"this is the Count of Monte Cristo.\" The Count bowed, while\nMademoiselle Danglars bent her head slightly. \"You have a charming young\nperson with you to-night, count,\" said Eugenie. \"Is she your daughter?\"\n\n\"No, mademoiselle,\" said Monte Cristo, astonished at the coolness and\nfreedom of the question. \"She is a poor unfortunate Greek left under my\ncare.\"\n\n\"And what is her name?\"\n\n\"Haidee,\" replied Monte Cristo.\n\n\"A Greek?\" murmured the Count of Morcerf.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, count,\" said Madame Danglars; \"and tell me, did you ever\nsee at the court of Ali Tepelini, whom you so gloriously and valiantly\nserved, a more exquisite beauty or richer costume?\"\n\n\"Did I hear rightly, monsieur,\" said Monte Cristo \"that you served at\nYanina?\"\n\n\"I was inspector-general of the pasha's troops,\" replied Morcerf; \"and\nit is no secret that I owe my fortune, such as it is, to the liberality\nof the illustrious Albanese chief.\"\n\n\"But look!\" exclaimed Madame Danglars.\n\n\"Where?\" stammered Morcerf.\n\n\"There,\" said Monte Cristo placing his arms around the count, and\nleaning with him over the front of the box, just as Haidee, whose\neyes were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian,\nperceived his pale features close to Morcerf's face. It was as if the\nyoung girl beheld the head of Medusa. She bent forwards as though to\nassure herself of the reality of what she saw, then, uttering a faint\ncry, threw herself back in her seat. The sound was heard by the people\nabout Ali, who instantly opened the box-door. \"Why, count,\" exclaimed\nEugenie, \"what has happened to your ward? she seems to have been taken\nsuddenly ill.\"\n\n\"Very probably,\" answered the count. \"But do not be alarmed on her\naccount. Haidee's nervous system is delicately organized, and she is\npeculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers--nay, there are\nsome which cause her to faint if brought into her presence. However,\"\ncontinued Monte Cristo, drawing a small phial from his pocket, \"I have\nan infallible remedy.\" So saying, he bowed to the baroness and her\ndaughter, exchanged a parting shake of the hand with Debray and the\ncount, and left Madame Danglars' box. Upon his return to Haidee he found\nher still very pale. As soon as she saw him she seized his hand; her own\nhands were moist and icy cold. \"Who was it you were talking with over\nthere?\" she asked.\n\n\"With the Count of Morcerf,\" answered Monte Cristo. \"He tells me he\nserved your illustrious father, and that he owes his fortune to him.\"\n\n\"Wretch!\" exclaimed Haidee, her eyes flashing with rage; \"he sold my\nfather to the Turks, and the fortune he boasts of was the price of his\ntreachery! Did not you know that, my dear lord?\"\n\n\"Something of this I heard in Epirus,\" said Monte Cristo; \"but the\nparticulars are still unknown to me. You shall relate them to me, my\nchild. They are, no doubt, both curious and interesting.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; but let us go. I feel as though it would kill me to remain\nlong near that dreadful man.\" So saying, Haidee arose, and wrapping\nherself in her burnoose of white cashmire embroidered with pearls and\ncoral, she hastily quitted the box at the moment when the curtain was\nrising upon the fourth act.\n\n\"Do you observe,\" said the Countess G---- to Albert, who had returned\nto her side, \"that man does nothing like other people; he listens most\ndevoutly to the third act of 'Robert le Diable,' and when the fourth\nbegins, takes his departure.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 54. A Flurry in Stocks.\n\nSome days after this meeting, Albert de Morcerf visited the Count of\nMonte Cristo at his house in the Champs Elysees, which had already\nassumed that palace-like appearance which the count's princely fortune\nenabled him to give even to his most temporary residences. He came to\nrenew the thanks of Madame Danglars which had been already conveyed to\nthe count through the medium of a letter, signed \"Baronne Danglars,\nnee Hermine de Servieux.\" Albert was accompanied by Lucien Debray, who,\njoining in his friend's conversation, added some passing compliments,\nthe source of which the count's talent for finesse easily enabled him to\nguess. He was convinced that Lucien's visit was due to a double feeling\nof curiosity, the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the\nRue de la Chaussee d'Antin. In short, Madame Danglars, not being able\npersonally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household\narrangements of a man who gave away horses worth 30,000 francs and who\nwent to the opera with a Greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a\nmillion of money, had deputed those eyes, by which she was accustomed\nto see, to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this\nincomprehensible person. But the count did not appear to suspect that\nthere could be the slightest connection between Lucien's visit and the\ncuriosity of the baroness.\n\n\"You are in constant communication with the Baron Danglars?\" the count\ninquired of Albert de Morcerf.\n\n\"Yes, count, you know what I told you?\"\n\n\"All remains the same, then, in that quarter?\"\n\n\"It is more than ever a settled thing,\" said Lucien,--and, considering\nthat this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make,\nhe adjusted the glass to his eye, and biting the top of his gold headed\ncane, began to make the tour of the apartment, examining the arms and\nthe pictures.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Monte Cristo \"I did not expect that the affair would be so\npromptly concluded.\"\n\n\"Oh, things take their course without our assistance. While we are\nforgetting them, they are falling into their appointed order; and\nwhen, again, our attention is directed to them, we are surprised at\nthe progress they have made towards the proposed end. My father and M.\nDanglars served together in Spain, my father in the army and M. Danglars\nin the commissariat department. It was there that my father, ruined by\nthe revolution, and M. Danglars, who never had possessed any patrimony,\nboth laid the foundations of their different fortunes.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Monte Cristo \"I think M. Danglars mentioned that in a visit\nwhich I paid him; and,\" continued he, casting a side-glance at Lucien,\nwho was turning over the leaves of an album, \"Mademoiselle Eugenie is\npretty--I think I remember that to be her name.\"\n\n\"Very pretty, or rather, very beautiful,\" replied Albert, \"but of that\nstyle of beauty which I do not appreciate; I am an ungrateful fellow.\"\n\n\"You speak as if you were already her husband.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" returned Albert, in his turn looking around to see what Lucien was\ndoing.\n\n\"Really,\" said Monte Cristo, lowering his voice, \"you do not appear to\nme to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Danglars is too rich for me,\" replied Morcerf, \"and that\nfrightens me.\"\n\n\"Bah,\" exclaimed Monte Cristo, \"that's a fine reason to give. Are you\nnot rich yourself?\"\n\n\"My father's income is about 50,000 francs per annum; and he will give\nme, perhaps, ten or twelve thousand when I marry.\"\n\n\"That, perhaps, might not be considered a large sum, in Paris\nespecially,\" said the count; \"but everything does not depend on wealth,\nand it is a fine thing to have a good name, and to occupy a high station\nin society. Your name is celebrated, your position magnificent; and\nthen the Comte de Morcerf is a soldier, and it is pleasing to see\nthe integrity of a Bayard united to the poverty of a Duguesclin;\ndisinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can\nshine. As for me, I consider the union with Mademoiselle Danglars a most\nsuitable one; she will enrich you, and you will ennoble her.\" Albert\nshook his head, and looked thoughtful. \"There is still something else,\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"I confess,\" observed Monte Cristo, \"that I have some difficulty in\ncomprehending your objection to a young lady who is both rich and\nbeautiful.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Morcerf, \"this repugnance, if repugnance it may be called, is\nnot all on my side.\"\n\n\"Whence can it arise, then? for you told me your father desired the\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"It is my mother who dissents; she has a clear and penetrating judgment,\nand does not smile on the proposed union. I cannot account for it, but\nshe seems to entertain some prejudice against the Danglars.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the count, in a somewhat forced tone, \"that may be easily\nexplained; the Comtesse de Morcerf, who is aristocracy and refinement\nitself, does not relish the idea of being allied by your marriage with\none of ignoble birth; that is natural enough.\"\n\n\"I do not know if that is her reason,\" said Albert, \"but one thing I\ndo know, that if this marriage be consummated, it will render her quite\nmiserable. There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in order\nto talk over and settle the affair; but I had such a sudden attack of\nindisposition\"--\n\n\"Real?\" interrupted the count, smiling.\n\n\"Oh, real enough, from anxiety doubtless,--at any rate they postponed\nthe matter for two months. There is no hurry, you know. I am not yet\ntwenty-one, and Eugenie is only seventeen; but the two months expire\nnext week. It must be done. My dear count, you cannot imagine how my\nmind is harassed. How happy you are in being exempt from all this!\"\n\n\"Well, and why should not you be free, too? What prevents you from being\nso?\"\n\n\"Oh, it will be too great a disappointment to my father if I do not\nmarry Mademoiselle Danglars.\"\n\n\"Marry her then,\" said the count, with a significant shrug of the\nshoulders.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Morcerf, \"but that will plunge my mother into positive\ngrief.\"\n\n\"Then do not marry her,\" said the count.\n\n\"Well, I shall see. I will try and think over what is the best thing\nto be done; you will give me your advice, will you not, and if possible\nextricate me from my unpleasant position? I think, rather than give pain\nto my dear mother, I would run the risk of offending the count.\" Monte\nCristo turned away; he seemed moved by this last remark. \"Ah,\" said he\nto Debray, who had thrown himself into an easy-chair at the farthest\nextremity of the salon, and who held a pencil in his right hand and an\naccount book in his left, \"what are you doing there? Are you making a\nsketch after Poussin?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" was the tranquil response; \"I am too fond of art to attempt\nanything of that sort. I am doing a little sum in arithmetic.\"\n\n\"In arithmetic?\"\n\n\"Yes; I am calculating--by the way, Morcerf, that indirectly concerns\nyou--I am calculating what the house of Danglars must have gained by the\nlast rise in Haiti bonds; from 206 they have risen to 409 in three days,\nand the prudent banker had purchased at 206; therefore he must have made\n300,000 livres.\"\n\n\"That is not his biggest scoop,\" said Morcerf; \"did he not make a\nmillion in Spaniards this last year?\"\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said Lucien, \"here is the Count of Monte Cristo, who\nwill say to you, as the Italians do,--\n\n\"'Danaro e santita, Meta della meta.' [*]\n\n     * \"Money and sanctity, Each in a moiety.\n\n\"When they tell me such things, I only shrug my shoulders and say\nnothing.\"\n\n\"But you were speaking of Haitians?\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Ah, Haitians,--that is quite another thing! Haitians are the ecarte\nof French stock-jobbing. We may like bouillotte, delight in whist, be\nenraptured with boston, and yet grow tired of them all; but we always\ncome back to ecarte--it is not only a game, it is a hors-d'oeuvre! M.\nDanglars sold yesterday at 405, and pockets 300,000 francs. Had he but\nwaited till to-day, the price would have fallen to 205, and instead of\ngaining 300,000 francs, he would have lost 20 or 25,000.\"\n\n\"And what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206?\" asked Monte\nCristo. \"I am profoundly ignorant of all these stock-jobbing intrigues.\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Albert, laughing, \"one piece of news follows another,\nand there is often great dissimilarity between them.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the count, \"I see that M. Danglars is accustomed to play at\ngaining or losing 300,000 francs in a day; he must be enormously rich.\"\n\n\"It is not he who plays!\" exclaimed Lucien; \"it is Madame Danglars: she\nis indeed daring.\"\n\n\"But you who are a reasonable being, Lucien, and who knows how\nlittle dependence is to be placed on the news, since you are at the\nfountain-head, surely you ought to prevent it,\" said Morcerf, with a\nsmile.\n\n\"How can I, if her husband fails in controlling her?\" asked Lucien; \"you\nknow the character of the baroness--no one has any influence with her,\nand she does precisely what she pleases.\"\n\n\"Ah, if I were in your place\"--said Albert.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I would reform her; it would be rendering a service to her future\nson-in-law.\"\n\n\"How would you set about it?\"\n\n\"Ah, that would be easy enough--I would give her a lesson.\"\n\n\"A lesson?\"\n\n\"Yes. Your position as secretary to the minister renders your authority\ngreat on the subject of political news; you never open your mouth but\nthe stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words. Cause her to lose a\nhundred thousand francs, and that would teach her prudence.\"\n\n\"I do not understand,\" stammered Lucien.\n\n\"It is very clear, notwithstanding,\" replied the young man, with an\nartlessness wholly free from affectation; \"tell her some fine morning\nan unheard-of piece of intelligence--some telegraphic despatch, of\nwhich you alone are in possession; for instance, that Henri IV. was\nseen yesterday at Gabrielle's. That would boom the market; she will\nbuy heavily, and she will certainly lose when Beauchamp announces the\nfollowing day, in his gazette, 'The report circulated by some usually\nwell-informed persons that the king was seen yesterday at Gabrielle's\nhouse, is totally without foundation. We can positively assert that his\nmajesty did not quit the Pont-Neuf.'\" Lucien half smiled. Monte\nCristo, although apparently indifferent, had not lost one word of this\nconversation, and his penetrating eye had even read a hidden secret\nin the embarrassed manner of the secretary. This embarrassment had\ncompletely escaped Albert, but it caused Lucien to shorten his visit;\nhe was evidently ill at ease. The count, in taking leave of him, said\nsomething in a low voice, to which he answered, \"Willingly, count; I\naccept.\" The count returned to young Morcerf.\n\n\"Do you not think, on reflection,\" said he to him, \"that you have done\nwrong in thus speaking of your mother-in-law in the presence of M.\nDebray?\"\n\n\"My dear count,\" said Morcerf, \"I beg of you not to apply that title so\nprematurely.\"\n\n\"Now, speaking without any exaggeration, is your mother really so very\nmuch averse to this marriage?\"\n\n\"So much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house, and my\nmother, has not, I think, visited Madame Danglars twice in her whole\nlife.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the count, \"I am emboldened to speak openly to you.\nM. Danglars is my banker; M. de Villefort has overwhelmed me with\npoliteness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune\nenabled me to render him. I predict from all this an avalanche of\ndinners and routs. Now, in order not to presume on this, and also to be\nbeforehand with them, I have, if agreeable to you, thought of\ninviting M. and Madame Danglars, and M. and Madame de Villefort, to\nmy country-house at Auteuil. If I were to invite you and the Count and\nCountess of Morcerf to this dinner, I should give it the appearance of\nbeing a matrimonial meeting, or at least Madame de Morcerf would look\nupon the affair in that light, especially if Baron Danglars did me the\nhonor to bring his daughter. In that case your mother would hold me in\naversion, and I do not at all wish that; on the contrary, I desire to\nstand high in her esteem.\"\n\n\"Indeed, count,\" said Morcerf, \"I thank you sincerely for having used so\nmuch candor towards me, and I gratefully accept the exclusion which you\npropose. You say you desire my mother's good opinion; I assure you it is\nalready yours to a very unusual extent.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said Monte Cristo, with interest.\n\n\"Oh, I am sure of it; we talked of you an hour after you left us the\nother day. But to return to what we were saying. If my mother could know\nof this attention on your part--and I will venture to tell her--I am\nsure that she will be most grateful to you; it is true that my father\nwill be equally angry.\" The count laughed. \"Well,\" said he to Morcerf,\n\"but I think your father will not be the only angry one; M. and Madame\nDanglars will think me a very ill-mannered person. They know that I\nam intimate with you--that you are, in fact; one of the oldest of my\nParisian acquaintances--and they will not find you at my house; they\nwill certainly ask me why I did not invite you. Be sure to provide\nyourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of\nprobability, and communicate the fact to me by a line in writing. You\nknow that with bankers nothing but a written document will be valid.\"\n\n\"I will do better than that,\" said Albert; \"my mother is wishing to go\nto the sea-side--what day is fixed for your dinner?\"\n\n\"Saturday.\"\n\n\"This is Tuesday--well, to-morrow evening we leave, and the day after we\nshall be at Treport. Really, count, you have a delightful way of setting\npeople at their ease.\"\n\n\"Indeed, you give me more credit than I deserve; I only wish to do what\nwill be agreeable to you, that is all.\"\n\n\"When shall you send your invitations?\"\n\n\"This very day.\"\n\n\"Well, I will immediately call on M. Danglars, and tell him that my\nmother and myself must leave Paris to-morrow. I have not seen you,\nconsequently I know nothing of your dinner.\"\n\n\"How foolish you are! Have you forgotten that M. Debray has just seen\nyou at my house?\"\n\n\"Ah, true.\"\n\n\"Fix it this way. I have seen you, and invited you without any ceremony,\nwhen you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to\naccept, as you were going to Treport.\"\n\n\"Well, then, that is settled; but you will come and call on my mother\nbefore to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Before to-morrow?--that will be a difficult matter to arrange, besides,\nI shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure.\"\n\n\"Well, you can do better. You were only a charming man before, but, if\nyou accede to my proposal, you will be adorable.\"\n\n\"What must I do to attain such sublimity?\"\n\n\"You are to-day free as air--come and dine with me; we shall be a\nsmall party--only yourself, my mother, and I. You have scarcely seen my\nmother; you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely.\nShe is a remarkable woman, and I only regret that there does not exist\nanother like her, about twenty years younger; in that case, I assure\nyou, there would very soon be a Countess and Viscountess of Morcerf. As\nto my father, you will not see him; he is officially engaged, and dines\nwith the chief referendary. We will talk over our travels; and you, who\nhave seen the whole world, will relate your adventures--you shall tell\nus the history of the beautiful Greek who was with you the other\nnight at the Opera, and whom you call your slave, and yet treat like a\nprincess. We will talk Italian and Spanish. Come, accept my invitation,\nand my mother will thank you.\"\n\n\"A thousand thanks,\" said the count, \"your invitation is most gracious,\nand I regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to accept it. I am\nnot so much at liberty as you suppose; on the contrary, I have a most\nimportant engagement.\"\n\n\"Ah, take care, you were teaching me just now how, in case of an\ninvitation to dinner, one might creditably make an excuse. I require the\nproof of a pre-engagement. I am not a banker, like M. Danglars, but I am\nquite as incredulous as he is.\"\n\n\"I am going to give you a proof,\" replied the count, and he rang the\nbell.\n\n\"Humph,\" said Morcerf, \"this is the second time you have refused to dine\nwith my mother; it is evident that you wish to avoid her.\" Monte Cristo\nstarted. \"Oh, you do not mean that,\" said he; \"besides, here comes the\nconfirmation of my assertion.\" Baptistin entered, and remained standing\nat the door. \"I had no previous knowledge of your visit, had I?\"\n\n\"Indeed, you are such an extraordinary person, that I would not answer\nfor it.\"\n\n\"At all events, I could not guess that you would invite me to dinner.\"\n\n\"Probably not.\"\n\n\"Well, listen, Baptistin, what did I tell you this morning when I called\nyou into my laboratory?\"\n\n\"To close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck five,\"\nreplied the valet.\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear count,\" said Albert.\n\n\"No, no, I wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have\ngiven me, my dear viscount; it is tiresome to be always acting Manfred.\nI wish my life to be free and open. Go on, Baptistin.\"\n\n\"Then to admit no one except Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and his son.\"\n\n\"You hear--Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti--a man who ranks amongst the most\nancient nobility of Italy, whose name Dante has celebrated in the tenth\ncanto of 'The Inferno,' you remember it, do you not? Then there is his\nson, Andrea, a charming young man, about your own age, viscount,\nbearing the same title as yourself, and who is making his entry into the\nParisian world, aided by his father's millions. The major will bring his\nson with him this evening, the contino, as we say in Italy; he confides\nhim to my care. If he proves himself worthy of it, I will do what I can\nto advance his interests. You will assist me in the work, will you not?\"\n\n\"Most undoubtedly. This Major Cavalcanti is an old friend of yours,\nthen?\"\n\n\"By no means. He is a perfect nobleman, very polite, modest, and\nagreeable, such as may be found constantly in Italy, descendants of very\nancient families. I have met him several times at Florence, Bologna\nand Lucca, and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in\nParis. The acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on\none; they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once\npaid them by chance, as though the civilities of a passing hour were\nlikely to awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose\nsociety you may happen to be thrown in the course of your journey. This\ngood Major Cavalcanti is come to take a second view of Paris, which he\nonly saw in passing through in the time of the Empire, when he was on\nhis way to Moscow. I shall give him a good dinner, he will confide his\nson to my care, I will promise to watch over him, I shall let him follow\nin whatever path his folly may lead him, and then I shall have done my\npart.\"\n\n\"Certainly; I see you are a model Mentor,\" said Albert \"Good-by, we\nshall return on Sunday. By the way, I have received news of Franz.\"\n\n\"Have you? Is he still amusing himself in Italy?\"\n\n\"I believe so; however, he regrets your absence extremely. He says you\nwere the sun of Rome, and that without you all appears dark and cloudy;\nI do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains.\"\n\n\"His opinion of me is altered for the better, then?\"\n\n\"No, he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible\nand mysterious of beings.\"\n\n\"He is a charming young man,\" said Monte Cristo \"and I felt a lively\ninterest in him the very first evening of my introduction, when I met\nhim in search of a supper, and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of\nmine. He is, I think, the son of General d'Epinay?\"\n\n\"He is.\"\n\n\"The same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815?\"\n\n\"By the Bonapartists.\"\n\n\"Yes. Really I like him extremely; is there not also a matrimonial\nengagement contemplated for him?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is to marry Mademoiselle de Villefort.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"And you know I am to marry Mademoiselle Danglars,\" said Albert,\nlaughing.\n\n\"You smile.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why do you do so?\"\n\n\"I smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for\nthe consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own.\nBut really, my dear count, we are talking as much of women as they do of\nus; it is unpardonable.\" Albert rose.\n\n\"Are you going?\"\n\n\"Really, that is a good idea!--two hours have I been boring you to death\nwith my company, and then you, with the greatest politeness, ask me if I\nam going. Indeed, count, you are the most polished man in the world.\nAnd your servants, too, how very well behaved they are; there is quite a\nstyle about them. Monsieur Baptistin especially; I could never get such\na man as that. My servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a\nplay, who, because they have only a word or two to say, aquit themselves\nin the most awkward manner possible. Therefore, if you part with M.\nBaptistin, give me the refusal of him.\"\n\n\"By all means.\"\n\n\"That is not all; give my compliments to your illustrious Luccanese,\nCavalcante of the Cavalcanti; and if by any chance he should be wishing\nto establish his son, find him a wife very rich, very noble on her\nmother's side at least, and a baroness in right of her father, I will\nhelp you in the search.\"\n\n\"Ah, ha; you will do as much as that, will you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, really, nothing is certain in this world.\"\n\n\"Oh, count, what a service you might render me! I should like you a\nhundred times better if, by your intervention, I could manage to remain\na bachelor, even were it only for ten years.\"\n\n\"Nothing is impossible,\" gravely replied Monte Cristo; and taking leave\nof Albert, he returned into the house, and struck the gong three times.\nBertuccio appeared. \"Monsieur Bertuccio, you understand that I intend\nentertaining company on Saturday at Auteuil.\" Bertuccio slightly\nstarted. \"I shall require your services to see that all be properly\narranged. It is a beautiful house, or at all events may be made so.\"\n\n\"There must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title, your\nexcellency, for the tapestried hangings are very old.\"\n\n\"Let them all be taken away and changed, then, with the exception of\nthe sleeping-chamber which is hung with red damask; you will leave\nthat exactly as it is.\" Bertuccio bowed. \"You will not touch the garden\neither; as to the yard, you may do what you please with it; I should\nprefer that being altered beyond all recognition.\"\n\n\"I will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes, your\nexcellency. I should be glad, however, to receive your excellency's\ncommands concerning the dinner.\"\n\n\"Really, my dear M. Bertuccio,\" said the count, \"since you have been\nin Paris, you have become quite nervous, and apparently out of your\nelement; you no longer seem to understand me.\"\n\n\"But surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you are\nexpecting to receive?\"\n\n\"I do not yet know myself, neither is it necessary that you should do\nso. 'Lucullus dines with Lucullus,' that is quite sufficient.\" Bertuccio\nbowed, and left the room.\n\n\n\nChapter 55. Major Cavalcanti.\n\nBoth the count and Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to\nMorcerf the proposed visit of the major, which had served Monte Cristo\nas a pretext for declining Albert's invitation. Seven o'clock had just\nstruck, and M. Bertuccio, according to the command which had been given\nhim, had two hours before left for Auteuil, when a cab stopped at the\ndoor, and after depositing its occupant at the gate, immediately hurried\naway, as if ashamed of its employment. The visitor was about fifty-two\nyears of age, dressed in one of the green surtouts, ornamented with\nblack frogs, which have so long maintained their popularity all over\nEurope. He wore trousers of blue cloth, boots tolerably clean, but not\nof the brightest polish, and a little too thick in the soles, buckskin\ngloves, a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by\nthe gendarmes, and a black cravat striped with white, which, if the\nproprietor had not worn it of his own free will, might have passed for a\nhalter, so much did it resemble one. Such was the picturesque costume of\nthe person who rang at the gate, and demanded if it was not at No. 30 in\nthe Avenue des Champs-Elysees that the Count of Monte Cristo lived, and\nwho, being answered by the porter in the affirmative, entered, closed\nthe gate after him, and began to ascend the steps.\n\nThe small and angular head of this man, his white hair and thick gray\nmustaches, caused him to be easily recognized by Baptistin, who had\nreceived an exact description of the expected visitor, and who was\nawaiting him in the hall. Therefore, scarcely had the stranger time to\npronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival. He was\nushered into a simple and elegant drawing-room, and the count rose to\nmeet him with a smiling air. \"Ah, my dear sir, you are most welcome; I\nwas expecting you.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said the Italian, \"was your excellency then aware of my\nvisit?\"\n\n\"Yes; I had been told that I should see you to-day at seven o'clock.\"\n\n\"Then you have received full information concerning my arrival?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Ah, so much the better, I feared this little precaution might have been\nforgotten.\"\n\n\"What precaution?\"\n\n\"That of informing you beforehand of my coming.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, it has not.\"\n\n\"But you are sure you are not mistaken.\"\n\n\"Very sure.\"\n\n\"It really was I whom your excellency expected at seven o'clock this\nevening?\"\n\n\"I will prove it to you beyond a doubt.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, never mind that,\" said the Italian; \"it is not worth the\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Monte Cristo. His visitor appeared slightly uneasy.\n\"Let me see,\" said the count; \"are you not the Marquis Bartolomeo\nCavalcanti?\"\n\n\"Bartolomeo Cavalcanti,\" joyfully replied the Italian; \"yes, I am really\nhe.\"\n\n\"Ex-major in the Austrian service?\"\n\n\"Was I a major?\" timidly asked the old soldier.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Monte Cristo \"you were a major; that is the title the French\ngive to the post which you filled in Italy.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the major, \"I do not demand more, you understand\"--\n\n\"Your visit here to-day is not of your own suggestion, is it?\" said\nMonte Cristo.\n\n\"No, certainly not.\"\n\n\"You were sent by some other person?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"By the excellent Abbe Busoni?\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" said the delighted major.\n\n\"And you have a letter?\"\n\n\"Yes, there it is.\"\n\n\"Give it me, then;\" and Monte Cristo took the letter, which he opened\nand read. The major looked at the count with his large staring eyes,\nand then took a survey of the apartment, but his gaze almost immediately\nreverted to the proprietor of the room. \"Yes, yes, I see. 'Major\nCavalcanti, a worthy patrician of Lucca, a descendant of the Cavalcanti\nof Florence,'\" continued Monte Cristo, reading aloud, \"'possessing an\nincome of half a million.'\" Monte Cristo raised his eyes from the paper,\nand bowed. \"Half a million,\" said he, \"magnificent!\"\n\n\"Half a million, is it?\" said the major.\n\n\"Yes, in so many words; and it must be so, for the abbe knows correctly\nthe amount of all the largest fortunes in Europe.\"\n\n\"Be it half a million, then; but on my word of honor, I had no idea that\nit was so much.\"\n\n\"Because you are robbed by your steward. You must make some reformation\nin that quarter.\"\n\n\"You have opened my eyes,\" said the Italian gravely; \"I will show the\ngentlemen the door.\" Monte Cristo resumed the perusal of the letter:--\n\n\"'And who only needs one thing more to make him happy.'\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed but one!\" said the major with a sigh.\n\n\"'Which is to recover a lost and adored son.'\"\n\n\"A lost and adored son!\"\n\n\"'Stolen away in his infancy, either by an enemy of his noble family or\nby the gypsies.'\"\n\n\"At the age of five years!\" said the major with a deep sigh, and raising\nhis eye to heaven.\n\n\"Unhappy father,\" said Monte Cristo. The count continued:--\n\n\"'I have given him renewed life and hope, in the assurance that you have\nthe power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for fifteen\nyears.'\" The major looked at the count with an indescribable expression\nof anxiety. \"I have the power of so doing,\" said Monte Cristo. The major\nrecovered his self-possession. \"So, then,\" said he, \"the letter was true\nto the end?\"\n\n\"Did you doubt it, my dear Monsieur Bartolomeo?\"\n\n\"No, indeed; certainly not; a good man, a man holding religious office,\nas does the Abbe Busoni, could not condescend to deceive or play off a\njoke; but your excellency has not read all.\"\n\n\"Ah, true,\" said Monte Cristo \"there is a postscript.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" repeated the major, \"yes--there--is--a--postscript.\"\n\n\"'In order to save Major Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on his\nbanker, I send him a draft for 2,000 francs to defray his travelling\nexpenses, and credit on you for the further sum of 48,000 francs, which\nyou still owe me.'\" The major awaited the conclusion of the postscript,\napparently with great anxiety. \"Very good,\" said the count.\n\n\"He said 'very good,'\" muttered the major, \"then--sir\"--replied he.\n\n\"Then what?\" asked Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Then the postscript\"--\n\n\"Well; what of the postscript?\"\n\n\"Then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of the\nletter?\"\n\n\"Certainly; the Abbe Busoni and myself have a small account open between\nus. I do not remember if it is exactly 48,000. francs, which I am still\nowing him, but I dare say we shall not dispute the difference. You\nattached great importance, then, to this postscript, my dear Monsieur\nCavalcanti?\"\n\n\"I must explain to you,\" said the major, \"that, fully confiding in the\nsignature of the Abbe Busoni, I had not provided myself with any other\nfunds; so that if this resource had failed me, I should have found\nmyself very unpleasantly situated in Paris.\"\n\n\"Is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed\nanywhere?\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Why, really I know no one,\" said the major.\n\n\"But then you yourself are known to others?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am known, so that\"--\n\n\"Proceed, my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti.\"\n\n\"So that you will remit to me these 48,000 francs?\"\n\n\"Certainly, at your first request.\" The major's eyes dilated with\npleasing astonishment. \"But sit down,\" said Monte Cristo; \"really I\ndo not know what I have been thinking of--I have positively kept you\nstanding for the last quarter of an hour.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it.\" The major drew an arm-chair towards him, and\nproceeded to seat himself.\n\n\"Now,\" said the count, \"what will you take--a glass of port, sherry, or\nAlicante?\"\n\n\"Alicante, if you please; it is my favorite wine.\"\n\n\"I have some that is very good. You will take a biscuit with it, will\nyou not?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will take a biscuit, as you are so obliging.\"\n\nMonte Cristo rang; Baptistin appeared. The count advanced to meet him.\n\"Well?\" said he in a low voice. \"The young man is here,\" said the valet\nde chambre in the same tone.\n\n\"Into what room did you take him?\"\n\n\"Into the blue drawing-room, according to your excellency's orders.\"\n\n\"That's right; now bring the Alicante and some biscuits.\"\n\nBaptistin left the room. \"Really,\" said the major, \"I am quite ashamed\nof the trouble I am giving you.\"\n\n\"Pray don't mention such a thing,\" said the count. Baptistin re-entered\nwith glasses, wine, and biscuits. The count filled one glass, but in the\nother he only poured a few drops of the ruby-colored liquid. The bottle\nwas covered with spiders' webs, and all the other signs which indicate\nthe age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a man's face. The major\nmade a wise choice; he took the full glass and a biscuit. The count told\nBaptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest, who began by\nsipping the Alicante with an expression of great satisfaction, and then\ndelicately steeped his biscuit in the wine.\n\n\"So, sir, you lived at Lucca, did you? You were rich, noble, held in\ngreat esteem--had all that could render a man happy?\"\n\n\"All,\" said the major, hastily swallowing his biscuit, \"positively all.\"\n\n\"And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your\nhappiness?\"\n\n\"Only one thing,\" said the Italian.\n\n\"And that one thing, your lost child.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the major, taking a second biscuit, \"that consummation of\nmy happiness was indeed wanting.\" The worthy major raised his eyes to\nheaven and sighed.\n\n\"Let me hear, then,\" said the count, \"who this deeply regretted son was;\nfor I always understood you were a bachelor.\"\n\n\"That was the general opinion, sir,\" said the major, \"and I\"--\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the count, \"and you confirmed the report. A youthful\nindiscretion, I suppose, which you were anxious to conceal from the\nworld at large?\" The major recovered himself, and resumed his usual calm\nmanner, at the same time casting his eyes down, either to give himself\ntime to compose his countenance, or to assist his imagination, all the\nwhile giving an under-look at the count, the protracted smile on whose\nlips still announced the same polite curiosity. \"Yes,\" said the major,\n\"I did wish this fault to be hidden from every eye.\"\n\n\"Not on your own account, surely,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"for a man is\nabove that sort of thing?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, certainly not on my own account,\" said the major with a smile\nand a shake of the head.\n\n\"But for the sake of the mother?\" said the count.\n\n\"Yes, for the mother's sake--his poor mother!\" cried the major, taking a\nthird biscuit.\n\n\"Take some more wine, my dear Cavalcanti,\" said the count, pouring out\nfor him a second glass of Alicante; \"your emotion has quite overcome\nyou.\"\n\n\"His poor mother,\" murmured the major, trying to get the lachrymal gland\nin operation, so as to moisten the corner of his eye with a false tear.\n\n\"She belonged to one of the first families in Italy, I think, did she\nnot?\"\n\n\"She was of a noble family of Fiesole, count.\"\n\n\"And her name was\"--\n\n\"Do you desire to know her name?\"--\n\n\"Oh,\" said Monte Cristo \"it would be quite superfluous for you to tell\nme, for I already know it.\"\n\n\"The count knows everything,\" said the Italian, bowing.\n\n\"Oliva Corsinari, was it not?\"\n\n\"Oliva Corsinari.\"\n\n\"A marchioness?\"\n\n\"A marchioness.\"\n\n\"And you married her at last, notwithstanding the opposition of her\nfamily?\"\n\n\"Yes, that was the way it ended.\"\n\n\"And you have doubtless brought all your papers with you?\" said Monte\nCristo.\n\n\"What papers?\"\n\n\"The certificate of your marriage with Oliva Corsinari, and the register\nof your child's birth.\"\n\n\"The register of my child's birth?\"\n\n\"The register of the birth of Andrea Cavalcanti--of your son; is not his\nname Andrea?\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" said the major.\n\n\"What? You believe so?\"\n\n\"I dare not positively assert it, as he has been lost for so long a\ntime.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Monte Cristo \"you have all the documents with you?\"\n\n\"Your excellency, I regret to say that, not knowing it was necessary to\ncome provided with these papers, I neglected to bring them.\"\n\n\"That is unfortunate,\" returned Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Were they, then, so necessary?\"\n\n\"They were indispensable.\"\n\nThe major passed his hand across his brow. \"Ah, per Bacco,\nindispensable, were they?\"\n\n\"Certainly they were; supposing there were to be doubts raised as to the\nvalidity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child?\"\n\n\"True,\" said the major, \"there might be doubts raised.\"\n\n\"In that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated.\"\n\n\"It would be fatal to his interests.\"\n\n\"It might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance.\"\n\n\"O peccato!\"\n\n\"You must know that in France they are very particular on these points;\nit is not sufficient, as in Italy, to go to the priest and say, 'We love\neach other, and want you to marry us.' Marriage is a civil affair in\nFrance, and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you must have papers\nwhich undeniably establish your identity.\"\n\n\"That is the misfortune! You see I have not these necessary papers.\"\n\n\"Fortunately, I have them, though,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You have them?\"\n\n\"I have them.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed?\" said the major, who, seeing the object of his journey\nfrustrated by the absence of the papers, feared also that his\nforgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48,000\nfrancs--\"ah, indeed, that is a fortunate circumstance; yes, that really\nis lucky, for it never occurred to me to bring them.\"\n\n\"I do not at all wonder at it--one cannot think of everything; but,\nhappily, the Abbe Busoni thought for you.\"\n\n\"He is an excellent person.\"\n\n\"He is extremely prudent and thoughtful.\"\n\n\"He is an admirable man,\" said the major; \"and he sent them to you?\"\n\n\"Here they are.\"\n\nThe major clasped his hands in token of admiration. \"You married Oliva\nCorsinari in the church of San Paolo del Monte-Cattini; here is the\npriest's certificate.\"\n\n\"Yes indeed, there it is truly,\" said the Italian, looking on with\nastonishment.\n\n\"And here is Andrea Cavalcanti's baptismal register, given by the curate\nof Saravezza.\"\n\n\"All quite correct.\"\n\n\"Take these documents, then; they do not concern me. You will give them\nto your son, who will, of course, take great care of them.\"\n\n\"I should think so, indeed! If he were to lose them\"--\n\n\"Well, and if he were to lose them?\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"In that case,\" replied the major, \"it would be necessary to write to\nthe curate for duplicates, and it would be some time before they could\nbe obtained.\"\n\n\"It would be a difficult matter to arrange,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Almost an impossibility,\" replied the major.\n\n\"I am very glad to see that you understand the value of these papers.\"\n\n\"I regard them as invaluable.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Monte Cristo \"as to the mother of the young man\"--\n\n\"As to the mother of the young man\"--repeated the Italian, with anxiety.\n\n\"As regards the Marchesa Corsinari\"--\n\n\"Really,\" said the major, \"difficulties seem to thicken upon us; will\nshe be wanted in any way?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"besides, has she not\"--\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the major, \"she has\"--\n\n\"Paid the last debt of nature?\"\n\n\"Alas, yes,\" returned the Italian.\n\n\"I knew that,\" said Monte Cristo; \"she has been dead these ten years.\"\n\n\"And I am still mourning her loss,\" exclaimed the major, drawing from\nhis pocket a checked handkerchief, and alternately wiping first the left\nand then the right eye.\n\n\"What would you have?\" said Monte Cristo; \"we are all mortal. Now, you\nunderstand, my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti, that it is useless for you to\ntell people in France that you have been separated from your son for\nfifteen years. Stories of gypsies, who steal children, are not at all in\nvogue in this part of the world, and would not be believed. You sent him\nfor his education to a college in one of the provinces, and now you wish\nhim to complete his education in the Parisian world. That is the reason\nwhich has induced you to leave Via Reggio, where you have lived since\nthe death of your wife. That will be sufficient.\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Very well, then.\"\n\n\"If they should hear of the separation\"--\n\n\"Ah, yes; what could I say?\"\n\n\"That an unfaithful tutor, bought over by the enemies of your family\"--\n\n\"By the Corsinari?\"\n\n\"Precisely. Had stolen away this child, in order that your name might\nbecome extinct.\"\n\n\"That is reasonable, since he is an only son.\"\n\n\"Well, now that all is arranged, do not let these newly awakened\nremembrances be forgotten. You have, doubtless, already guessed that I\nwas preparing a surprise for you?\"\n\n\"An agreeable one?\" asked the Italian.\n\n\"Ah, I see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his\nheart.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" said the major.\n\n\"Some one has told you the secret; or, perhaps, you guessed that he was\nhere.\"\n\n\"That who was here?\"\n\n\"Your child--your son--your Andrea!\"\n\n\"I did guess it,\" replied the major with the greatest possible coolness.\n\"Then he is here?\"\n\n\"He is,\" said Monte Cristo; \"when the valet de chambre came in just now,\nhe told me of his arrival.\"\n\n\"Ah, very well, very well,\" said the major, clutching the buttons of his\ncoat at each exclamation.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Monte Cristo, \"I understand your emotion; you must\nhave time to recover yourself. I will, in the meantime, go and prepare\nthe young man for this much-desired interview, for I presume that he is\nnot less impatient for it than yourself.\"\n\n\"I should quite imagine that to be the case,\" said Cavalcanti.\n\n\"Well, in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you.\"\n\n\"You will bring him, then? You carry your goodness so far as even to\npresent him to me yourself?\"\n\n\"No; I do not wish to come between a father and son. Your interview will\nbe private. But do not be uneasy; even if the powerful voice of nature\nshould be silent, you cannot well mistake him; he will enter by this\ndoor. He is a fine young man, of fair complexion--a little too fair,\nperhaps--pleasing in manners; but you will see and judge for yourself.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" said the major, \"you know I have only the 2,000 francs\nwhich the Abbe Busoni sent me; this sum I have expended upon travelling\nexpenses, and\"--\n\n\"And you want money; that is a matter of course, my dear M. Cavalcanti.\nWell, here are 8,000 francs on account.\"\n\nThe major's eyes sparkled brilliantly.\n\n\"It is 40,000 francs which I now owe you,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Does your excellency wish for a receipt?\" said the major, at the same\ntime slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat.\n\n\"For what?\" said the count.\n\n\"I thought you might want it to show the Abbe Busoni.\"\n\n\"Well, when you receive the remaining 40,000, you shall give me a\nreceipt in full. Between honest men such excessive precaution is, I\nthink, quite unnecessary.\"\n\n\"Yes, so it is, between perfectly upright people.\"\n\n\"One word more,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Say on.\"\n\n\"You will permit me to make one remark?\"\n\n\"Certainly; pray do so.\"\n\n\"Then I should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said the major, regarding himself with an air of complete\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"Yes. It may be worn at Via Reggio; but that costume, however elegant in\nitself, has long been out of fashion in Paris.\"\n\n\"That's unfortunate.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you really are attached to your old mode of dress; you can\neasily resume it when you leave Paris.\"\n\n\"But what shall I wear?\"\n\n\"What you find in your trunks.\"\n\n\"In my trunks? I have but one portmanteau.\"\n\n\"I dare say you have nothing else with you. What is the use of boring\none's self with so many things? Besides an old soldier always likes to\nmarch with as little baggage as possible.\"\n\n\"That is just the case--precisely so.\"\n\n\"But you are a man of foresight and prudence, therefore you sent your\nluggage on before you. It has arrived at the Hotel des Princes, Rue de\nRichelieu. It is there you are to take up your quarters.\"\n\n\"Then, in these trunks\"--\n\n\"I presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in all\nyou are likely to need,--your plain clothes and your uniform. On grand\noccasions you must wear your uniform; that will look very well. Do not\nforget your crosses. They still laugh at them in France, and yet always\nwear them, for all that.\"\n\n\"Very well, very well,\" said the major, who was in ecstasy at the\nattention paid him by the count.\n\n\"Now,\" said Monte Cristo, \"that you have fortified yourself against all\npainful excitement, prepare yourself, my dear M. Cavalcanti, to meet\nyour lost Andrea.\" Saying which Monte Cristo bowed, and disappeared\nbehind the tapestry, leaving the major fascinated beyond expression\nwith the delightful reception which he had received at the hands of the\ncount.\n\n\n\nChapter 56. Andrea Cavalcanti.\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo entered the adjoining room, which Baptistin\nhad designated as the drawing-room, and found there a young man, of\ngraceful demeanor and elegant appearance, who had arrived in a cab\nabout half an hour previously. Baptistin had not found any difficulty in\nrecognizing the person who presented himself at the door for admittance.\nHe was certainly the tall young man with light hair, red beard, black\neyes, and brilliant complexion, whom his master had so particularly\ndescribed to him. When the count entered the room the young man was\ncarelessly stretched on a sofa, tapping his boot with the gold-headed\ncane which he held in his hand. On perceiving the count he rose quickly.\n\"The Count of Monte Cristo, I believe?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, sir, and I think I have the honor of addressing Count Andrea\nCavalcanti?\"\n\n\"Count Andrea Cavalcanti,\" repeated the young man, accompanying his\nwords with a bow.\n\n\"You are charged with a letter of introduction addressed to me, are you\nnot?\" said the count.\n\n\"I did not mention that, because the signature seemed to me so strange.\"\n\n\"The letter signed 'Sinbad the Sailor,' is it not?\"\n\n\"Exactly so. Now, as I have never known any Sinbad, with the exception\nof the one celebrated in the 'Thousand and One Nights'\"--\n\n\"Well, it is one of his descendants, and a great friend of mine; he is a\nvery rich Englishman, eccentric almost to insanity, and his real name is\nLord Wilmore.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed? Then that explains everything that is extraordinary,\"\nsaid Andrea. \"He is, then, the same Englishman whom I met--at--ah--yes,\nindeed. Well, monsieur, I am at your service.\"\n\n\"If what you say be true,\" replied the count, smiling, \"perhaps you will\nbe kind enough to give me some account of yourself and your family?\"\n\n\"Certainly, I will do so,\" said the young man, with a quickness which\ngave proof of his ready invention. \"I am (as you have said) the Count\nAndrea Cavalcanti, son of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, a descendant of\nthe Cavalcanti whose names are inscribed in the golden book at Florence.\nOur family, although still rich (for my father's income amounts to half\na million), has experienced many misfortunes, and I myself was, at the\nage of five years, taken away by the treachery of my tutor, so that for\nfifteen years I have not seen the author of my existence. Since I have\narrived at years of discretion and become my own master, I have been\nconstantly seeking him, but all in vain. At length I received this\nletter from your friend, which states that my father is in Paris, and\nauthorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting him.\"\n\n\"Really, all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting,\" said\nMonte Cristo, observing the young man with a gloomy satisfaction; \"and\nyou have done well to conform in everything to the wishes of my friend\nSinbad; for your father is indeed here, and is seeking you.\"\n\nThe count from the moment of first entering the drawing-room, had not\nonce lost sight of the expression of the young man's countenance; he had\nadmired the assurance of his look and the firmness of his voice; but at\nthese words, so natural in themselves, \"Your father is indeed here, and\nis seeking you,\" young Andrea started, and exclaimed, \"My father? Is my\nfather here?\"\n\n\"Most undoubtedly,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"your father, Major Bartolomeo\nCavalcanti.\" The expression of terror which, for the moment, had\noverspread the features of the young man, had now disappeared. \"Ah, yes,\nthat is the name, certainly. Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti. And you really\nmean to say; monsieur, that my dear father is here?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; and I can even add that I have only just left his company.\nThe history which he related to me of his lost son touched me to the\nquick; indeed, his griefs, hopes, and fears on that subject might\nfurnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem. At length, he\none day received a letter, stating that the abductors of his son now\noffered to restore him, or at least to give notice where he might be\nfound, on condition of receiving a large sum of money, by way of ransom.\nYour father did not hesitate an instant, and the sum was sent to the\nfrontier of Piedmont, with a passport signed for Italy. You were in the\nsouth of France, I think?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Andrea, with an embarrassed air, \"I was in the south of\nFrance.\"\n\n\"A carriage was to await you at Nice?\"\n\n\"Precisely so; and it conveyed me from Nice to Genoa, from Genoa to\nTurin, from Turin to Chambery, from Chambery to Pont-de-Beauvoisin, and\nfrom Pont-de-Beauvoisin to Paris.\"\n\n\"Indeed? Then your father ought to have met with you on the road, for it\nis exactly the same route which he himself took, and that is how we have\nbeen able to trace your journey to this place.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Andrea, \"if my father had met me, I doubt if he would have\nrecognized me; I must be somewhat altered since he last saw me.\"\n\n\"Oh, the voice of nature,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"True,\" interrupted the young man, \"I had not looked upon it in that\nlight.\"\n\n\"Now,\" replied Monte Cristo \"there is only one source of uneasiness left\nin your father's mind, which is this--he is anxious to know how you\nhave been employed during your long absence from him, how you have\nbeen treated by your persecutors, and if they have conducted themselves\ntowards you with all the deference due to your rank. Finally, he is\nanxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral\ninfluence to which you have been exposed, and which is infinitely more\nto be dreaded than any physical suffering; he wishes to discover if the\nfine abilities with which nature had endowed you have been weakened by\nwant of culture; and, in short, whether you consider yourself capable of\nresuming and retaining in the world the high position to which your rank\nentitles you.\"\n\n\"Sir!\" exclaimed the young man, quite astounded, \"I hope no false\nreport\"--\n\n\"As for myself, I first heard you spoken of by my friend Wilmore, the\nphilanthropist. I believe he found you in some unpleasant position, but\ndo not know of what nature, for I did not ask, not being inquisitive.\nYour misfortunes engaged his sympathies, so you see you must have\nbeen interesting. He told me that he was anxious to restore you to the\nposition which you had lost, and that he would seek your father until he\nfound him. He did seek, and has found him, apparently, since he is here\nnow; and, finally, my friend apprised me of your coming, and gave me a\nfew other instructions relative to your future fortune. I am quite aware\nthat my friend Wilmore is peculiar, but he is sincere, and as rich as a\ngold-mine, consequently, he may indulge his eccentricities without\nany fear of their ruining him, and I have promised to adhere to his\ninstructions. Now, sir, pray do not be offended at the question I am\nabout to put to you, as it comes in the way of my duty as your patron.\nI would wish to know if the misfortunes which have happened to\nyou--misfortunes entirely beyond your control, and which in no degree\ndiminish my regard for you--I would wish to know if they have not, in\nsome measure, contributed to render you a stranger to the world in which\nyour fortune and your name entitle you to make a conspicuous figure?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" returned the young man, with a reassurance of manner, \"make\nyour mind easy on this score. Those who took me from my father, and\nwho always intended, sooner or later, to sell me again to my original\nproprietor, as they have now done, calculated that, in order to make the\nmost of their bargain, it would be politic to leave me in possession of\nall my personal and hereditary worth, and even to increase the value,\nif possible. I have, therefore, received a very good education, and have\nbeen treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated\nin Asia Minor, whose masters made them grammarians, doctors, and\nphilosophers, in order that they might fetch a higher price in the Roman\nmarket.\" Monte Cristo smiled with satisfaction; it appeared as if he had\nnot expected so much from M. Andrea Cavalcanti. \"Besides,\" continued\nthe young man, \"if there did appear some defect in education, or offence\nagainst the established forms of etiquette, I suppose it would be\nexcused, in consideration of the misfortunes which accompanied my birth,\nand followed me through my youth.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Monte Cristo in an indifferent tone, \"you will do as you\nplease, count, for you are the master of your own actions, and are the\nperson most concerned in the matter, but if I were you, I would not\ndivulge a word of these adventures. Your history is quite a romance,\nand the world, which delights in romances in yellow covers, strangely\nmistrusts those which are bound in living parchment, even though they be\ngilded like yourself. This is the kind of difficulty which I wished\nto represent to you, my dear count. You would hardly have recited your\ntouching history before it would go forth to the world, and be deemed\nunlikely and unnatural. You would be no longer a lost child found,\nbut you would be looked upon as an upstart, who had sprung up like a\nmushroom in the night. You might excite a little curiosity, but it is\nnot every one who likes to be made the centre of observation and the\nsubject of unpleasant remark.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, monsieur,\" said the young man, turning pale, and,\nin spite of himself, trembling beneath the scrutinizing look of his\ncompanion, \"such consequences would be extremely unpleasant.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, you must not exaggerate the evil,\" said Monte Cristo,\n\"for by endeavoring to avoid one fault you will fall into another. You\nmust resolve upon one simple and single line of conduct, and for a man\nof your intelligence, this plan is as easy as it is necessary; you must\nform honorable friendships, and by that means counteract the prejudice\nwhich may attach to the obscurity of your former life.\" Andrea visibly\nchanged countenance. \"I would offer myself as your surety and friendly\nadviser,\" said Monte Cristo, \"did I not possess a moral distrust of my\nbest friends, and a sort of inclination to lead others to doubt them\ntoo; therefore, in departing from this rule, I should (as the actors\nsay) be playing a part quite out of my line, and should, therefore, run\nthe risk of being hissed, which would be an act of folly.\"\n\n\"However, your excellency,\" said Andrea, \"in consideration of Lord\nWilmore, by whom I was recommended to you--\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly,\" interrupted Monte Cristo; \"but Lord Wilmore did not\nomit to inform me, my dear M. Andrea, that the season of your youth was\nrather a stormy one. Ah,\" said the count, watching Andrea's countenance,\n\"I do not demand any confession from you; it is precisely to avoid that\nnecessity that your father was sent for from Lucca. You shall soon\nsee him. He is a little stiff and pompous in his manner, and he is\ndisfigured by his uniform; but when it becomes known that he has been\nfor eighteen years in the Austrian service, all that will be pardoned.\nWe are not generally very severe with the Austrians. In short, you will\nfind your father a very presentable person, I assure you.\"\n\n\"Ah, sir, you have given me confidence; it is so long since we were\nseparated, that I have not the least remembrance of him, and, besides,\nyou know that in the eyes of the world a large fortune covers all\ndefects.\"\n\n\"He is a millionaire--his income is 500,000 francs.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the young man, with anxiety, \"I shall be sure to be placed\nin an agreeable position.\"\n\n\"One of the most agreeable possible, my dear sir; he will allow you an\nincome of 50,000 livres per annum during the whole time of your stay in\nParis.\"\n\n\"Then in that case I shall always choose to remain there.\"\n\n\"You cannot control circumstances, my dear sir; 'man proposes, and God\ndisposes.'\" Andrea sighed. \"But,\" said he, \"so long as I do remain in\nParis, and nothing forces me to quit it, do you mean to tell me that I\nmay rely on receiving the sum you just now mentioned to me?\"\n\n\"You may.\"\n\n\"Shall I receive it from my father?\" asked Andrea, with some uneasiness.\n\n\"Yes, you will receive it from your father personally, but Lord Wilmore\nwill be the security for the money. He has, at the request of your\nfather, opened an account of 6,000. francs a month at M. Danglars',\nwhich is one of the safest banks in Paris.\"\n\n\"And does my father mean to remain long in Paris?\" asked Andrea.\n\n\"Only a few days,\" replied Monte Cristo. \"His service does not allow him\nto absent himself more than two or three weeks together.\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear father!\" exclaimed Andrea, evidently charmed with the idea\nof his speedy departure.\n\n\"Therefore,\" said Monte Cristo feigning to mistake his\nmeaning--\"therefore I will not, for another instant, retard the pleasure\nof your meeting. Are you prepared to embrace your worthy father?\"\n\n\"I hope you do not doubt it.\"\n\n\"Go, then, into the drawing-room, my young friend, where you will find\nyour father awaiting you.\" Andrea made a low bow to the count,\nand entered the adjoining room. Monte Cristo watched him till he\ndisappeared, and then touched a spring in a panel made to look like a\npicture, which, in sliding partly from the frame, discovered to view\na small opening, so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was\npassing in the drawing-room now occupied by Cavalcanti and Andrea. The\nyoung man closed the door behind him, and advanced towards the major,\nwho had risen when he heard steps approaching him. \"Ah, my dear father!\"\nsaid Andrea in a loud voice, in order that the count might hear him in\nthe next room, \"is it really you?\"\n\n\"How do you do, my dear son?\" said the major gravely.\n\n\"After so many years of painful separation,\" said Andrea, in the same\ntone of voice, and glancing towards the door, \"what a happiness it is to\nmeet again!\"\n\n\"Indeed it is, after so long a separation.\"\n\n\"Will you not embrace me, sir?\" said Andrea.\n\n\"If you wish it, my son,\" said the major; and the two men embraced each\nother after the fashion of actors on the stage; that is to say, each\nrested his head on the other's shoulder.\n\n\"Then we are once more reunited?\" said Andrea.\n\n\"Once more,\" replied the major.\n\n\"Never more to be separated?\"\n\n\"Why, as to that--I think, my dear son, you must be by this time so\naccustomed to France as to look upon it almost as a second country.\"\n\n\"The fact is,\" said the young man, \"that I should be exceedingly grieved\nto leave it.\"\n\n\"As for me, you must know I cannot possibly live out of Lucca; therefore\nI shall return to Italy as soon as I can.\"\n\n\"But before you leave France, my dear father, I hope you will put me\nin possession of the documents which will be necessary to prove my\ndescent.\"\n\n\"Certainly; I am come expressly on that account; it has cost me much\ntrouble to find you, but I had resolved on giving them into your hands,\nand if I had to recommence my search, it would occupy all the few\nremaining years of my life.\"\n\n\"Where are these papers, then?\"\n\n\"Here they are.\"\n\nAndrea seized the certificate of his father's marriage and his own\nbaptismal register, and after having opened them with all the eagerness\nwhich might be expected under the circumstances, he read them with a\nfacility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents, and\nwith an expression which plainly denoted an unusual interest in the\ncontents. When he had perused the documents, an indefinable expression\nof pleasure lighted up his countenance, and looking at the major with a\nmost peculiar smile, he said, in very excellent Tuscan,--\"Then there is\nno longer any such thing, in Italy as being condemned to the galleys?\"\nThe major drew himself up to his full height.\n\n\"Why?--what do you mean by that question?\"\n\n\"I mean that if there were, it would be impossible to draw up with\nimpunity two such deeds as these. In France, my dear sir, half such a\npiece of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to\nToulon for five years, for change of air.\"\n\n\"Will you be good enough to explain your meaning?\" said the major,\nendeavoring as much as possible to assume an air of the greatest\nmajesty.\n\n\"My dear M. Cavalcanti,\" said Andrea, taking the major by the arm in a\nconfidential manner, \"how much are you paid for being my father?\" The\nmajor was about to speak, when Andrea continued, in a low voice.\n\n\"Nonsense, I am going to set you an example of confidence, they give me\n50,000 francs a year to be your son; consequently, you can understand\nthat it is not at all likely I shall ever deny my parent.\" The major\nlooked anxiously around him. \"Make yourself easy, we are quite alone,\"\nsaid Andrea; \"besides, we are conversing in Italian.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" replied the major, \"they paid me 50,000 francs down.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Cavalcanti,\" said Andrea, \"do you believe in fairy tales?\"\n\n\"I used not to do so, but I really feel now almost obliged to have faith\nin them.\"\n\n\"You have, then, been induced to alter your opinion; you have had some\nproofs of their truth?\" The major drew from his pocket a handful of\ngold. \"Most palpable proofs,\" said he, \"as you may perceive.\"\n\n\"You think, then, that I may rely on the count's promises?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do.\"\n\n\"You are sure he will keep his word with me?\"\n\n\"To the letter, but at the same time, remember, we must continue to play\nour respective parts. I, as a tender father\"--\n\n\"And I as a dutiful son, as they choose that I shall be descended from\nyou.\"\n\n\"Whom do you mean by they?\"\n\n\"Ma foi, I can hardly tell, but I was alluding to those who wrote the\nletter; you received one, did you not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"From whom?\"\n\n\"From a certain Abbe Busoni.\"\n\n\"Have you any knowledge of him?\"\n\n\"No, I have never seen him.\"\n\n\"What did he say in the letter?\"\n\n\"You will promise not to betray me?\"\n\n\"Rest assured of that; you well know that our interests are the same.\"\n\n\"Then read for yourself;\" and the major gave a letter into the young\nman's hand. Andrea read in a low voice--\n\n\"You are poor; a miserable old age awaits you. Would you like to become\nrich, or at least independent? Set out immediately for Paris, and demand\nof the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des Champs Elysees, No. 30, the son\nwhom you had by the Marchesa Corsinari, and who was taken from you at\nfive years of age. This son is named Andrea Cavalcanti. In order that\nyou may not doubt the kind intention of the writer of this letter, you\nwill find enclosed an order for 2,400 francs, payable in Florence, at\nSignor Gozzi's; also a letter of introduction to the Count of Monte\nCristo, on whom I give you a draft of 48,000 francs. Remember to go to\nthe count on the 26th May at seven o'clock in the evening.\n\n(Signed)\n\n\"Abbe Busoni.\"\n\n\"It is the same.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said the major.\n\n\"I was going to say that I received a letter almost to the same effect.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"From the Abbe Busoni?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"From whom, then?\"\n\n\"From an Englishman, called Lord Wilmore, who takes the name of Sinbad\nthe Sailor.\"\n\n\"And of whom you have no more knowledge than I of the Abbe Busoni?\"\n\n\"You are mistaken; there I am ahead of you.\"\n\n\"You have seen him, then?\"\n\n\"Yes, once.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Ah, that is just what I cannot tell you; if I did, I should make you as\nwise as myself, which it is not my intention to do.\"\n\n\"And what did the letter contain?\"\n\n\"Read it.\"\n\n\"'You are poor, and your future prospects are dark and gloomy. Do you\nwish for a name? should you like to be rich, and your own master?'\"\n\n\"Ma foi,\" said the young man; \"was it possible there could be two\nanswers to such a question?\"\n\n\"Take the post-chaise which you will find waiting at the Porte de Genes,\nas you enter Nice; pass through Turin, Chambery, and Pont-de-Beauvoisin.\nGo to the Count of Monte Cristo, Avenue des Champs Elysees, on the 26th\nof May, at seven o'clock in the evening, and demand of him your father.\nYou are the son of the Marchese Cavalcanti and the Marchesa Oliva\nCorsinari. The marquis will give you some papers which will certify this\nfact, and authorize you to appear under that name in the Parisian world.\nAs to your rank, an annual income of 50,000 livres will enable you to\nsupport it admirably. I enclose a draft for 5,000 livres, payable on M.\nFerrea, banker at Nice, and also a letter of introduction to the Count\nof Monte Cristo, whom I have directed to supply all your wants.\n\n\"Sinbad the Sailor.\"\n\n\"Humph,\" said the major; \"very good. You have seen the count, you say?\"\n\n\"I have only just left him.\"\n\n\"And has he conformed to all that the letter specified?\"\n\n\"He has.\"\n\n\"Do you understand it?\"\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"There is a dupe somewhere.\"\n\n\"At all events, it is neither you nor I.\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Well, then\"--\n\n\"Why, it does not much concern us, do you think it does?\"\n\n\"No; I agree with you there. We must play the game to the end, and\nconsent to be blindfolded.\"\n\n\"Ah, you shall see; I promise you I will sustain my part to admiration.\"\n\n\"I never once doubted your doing so.\" Monte Cristo chose this moment for\nre-entering the drawing-room. On hearing the sound of his footsteps, the\ntwo men threw themselves in each other's arms, and while they were in\nthe midst of this embrace, the count entered. \"Well, marquis,\" said\nMonte Cristo, \"you appear to be in no way disappointed in the son whom\nyour good fortune has restored to you.\"\n\n\"Ah, your excellency, I am overwhelmed with delight.\"\n\n\"And what are your feelings?\" said Monte Cristo, turning to the young\nman.\n\n\"As for me, my heart is overflowing with happiness.\"\n\n\"Happy father, happy son!\" said the count.\n\n\"There is only one thing which grieves me,\" observed the major, \"and\nthat is the necessity for my leaving Paris so soon.\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear M. Cavalcanti, I trust you will not leave before I have had\nthe honor of presenting you to some of my friends.\"\n\n\"I am at your service, sir,\" replied the major.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said Monte Cristo, addressing Andrea, \"make your\nconfession.\"\n\n\"To whom?\"\n\n\"Tell M. Cavalcanti something of the state of your finances.\"\n\n\"Ma foi, monsieur, you have touched upon a tender chord.\"\n\n\"Do you hear what he says, major?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do.\"\n\n\"But do you understand?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Your son says he requires money.\"\n\n\"Well, what would you have me do?\" said the major.\n\n\"You should furnish him with some of course,\" replied Monte Cristo.\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you,\" said the count, at the same time advancing towards Andrea,\nand slipping a packet of bank-notes into the young man's hand.\n\n\"What is this?\"\n\n\"It is from your father.\"\n\n\"From my father?\"\n\n\"Yes; did you not tell him just now that you wanted money? Well, then,\nhe deputes me to give you this.\"\n\n\"Am I to consider this as part of my income on account?\"\n\n\"No, it is for the first expenses of your settling in Paris.\"\n\n\"Ah, how good my dear father is!\"\n\n\"Silence,\" said Monte Cristo; \"he does not wish you to know that it\ncomes from him.\"\n\n\"I fully appreciate his delicacy,\" said Andrea, cramming the notes\nhastily into his pocket.\n\n\"And now, gentlemen, I wish you good-morning,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"And when shall we have the honor of seeing you again, your excellency?\"\nasked Cavalcanti.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Andrea, \"when may we hope for that pleasure?\"\n\n\"On Saturday, if you will--Yes.--Let me see--Saturday--I am to dine at\nmy country house, at Auteuil, on that day, Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28.\nSeveral persons are invited, and among others, M. Danglars, your banker.\nI will introduce you to him, for it will be necessary he should know\nyou, as he is to pay your money.\"\n\n\"Full dress?\" said the major, half aloud.\n\n\"Oh, yes, certainly,\" said the count; \"uniform, cross, knee-breeches.\"\n\n\"And how shall I be dressed?\" demanded Andrea.\n\n\"Oh, very simply; black trousers, patent leather boots, white waistcoat,\neither a black or blue coat, and a long cravat. Go to Blin or Veronique\nfor your clothes. Baptistin will tell you where, if you do not know\ntheir address. The less pretension there is in your attire, the better\nwill be the effect, as you are a rich man. If you mean to buy any\nhorses, get them of Devedeux, and if you purchase a phaeton, go to\nBaptiste for it.\"\n\n\"At what hour shall we come?\" asked the young man.\n\n\"About half-past six.\"\n\n\"We will be with you at that time,\" said the major. The two Cavalcanti\nbowed to the count, and left the house. Monte Cristo went to the window,\nand saw them crossing the street, arm in arm. \"There go two miscreants;\"\nsaid he, \"it is a pity they are not really related!\"--then, after an\ninstant of gloomy reflection, \"Come, I will go to see the Morrels,\" said\nhe; \"I think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 57. In the Lucerne Patch.\n\nOur readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure\nsurrounding M. de Villefort's house, and, behind the gate, half screened\nfrom view by the large chestnut-trees, which on all sides spread their\nluxuriant branches, we shall find some people of our acquaintance. This\ntime Maximilian was the first to arrive. He was intently watching for a\nshadow to appear among the trees, and awaiting with anxiety the sound of\na light step on the gravel walk. At length, the long-desired sound was\nheard, and instead of one figure, as he had expected, he perceived that\ntwo were approaching him. The delay had been occasioned by a visit from\nMadame Danglars and Eugenie, which had been prolonged beyond the time at\nwhich Valentine was expected. That she might not appear to fail in her\npromise to Maximilian, she proposed to Mademoiselle Danglars that they\nshould take a walk in the garden, being anxious to show that the delay,\nwhich was doubtless a cause of vexation to him, was not occasioned by\nany neglect on her part. The young man, with the intuitive perception\nof a lover, quickly understood the circumstances in which she was\ninvoluntarily placed, and he was comforted. Besides, although she\navoided coming within speaking distance, Valentine arranged so that\nMaximilian could see her pass and repass, and each time she went by, she\nmanaged, unperceived by her companion, to cast an expressive look at\nthe young man, which seemed to say, \"Have patience! You see it is not\nmy fault.\" And Maximilian was patient, and employed himself in mentally\ncontrasting the two girls,--one fair, with soft languishing eyes, a\nfigure gracefully bending like a weeping willow; the other a brunette,\nwith a fierce and haughty expression, and as straight as a poplar. It is\nunnecessary to state that, in the eyes of the young man, Valentine did\nnot suffer by the contrast. In about half an hour the girls went away,\nand Maximilian understood that Mademoiselle Danglars' visit had at last\ncome to an end. In a few minutes Valentine re-entered the garden alone.\nFor fear that any one should be observing her return, she walked slowly;\nand instead of immediately directing her steps towards the gate, she\nseated herself on a bench, and, carefully casting her eyes around, to\nconvince herself that she was not watched, she presently arose, and\nproceeded quickly to join Maximilian.\n\n\"Good-evening, Valentine,\" said a well-known voice.\n\n\"Good-evening, Maximilian; I know I have kept you waiting, but you saw\nthe cause of my delay.\"\n\n\"Yes, I recognized Mademoiselle Danglars. I was not aware that you were\nso intimate with her.\"\n\n\"Who told you we were intimate, Maximilian?\"\n\n\"No one, but you appeared to be so. From the manner in which you walked\nand talked together, one would have thought you were two school-girls\ntelling your secrets to each other.\"\n\n\"We were having a confidential conversation,\" returned Valentine; \"she\nwas owning to me her repugnance to the marriage with M. de Morcerf; and\nI, on the other hand, was confessing to her how wretched it made me to\nthink of marrying M. d'Epinay.\"\n\n\"Dear Valentine!\"\n\n\"That will account to you for the unreserved manner which you observed\nbetween me and Eugenie, as in speaking of the man whom I could not love,\nmy thoughts involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were\nfixed.\"\n\n\"Ah, how good you are to say so, Valentine! You possess a quality which\ncan never belong to Mademoiselle Danglars. It is that indefinable charm\nwhich is to a woman what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the\nfruit, for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek.\"\n\n\"It is your love which makes you look upon everything in that light.\"\n\n\"No, Valentine, I assure you such is not the case. I was observing you\nboth when you were walking in the garden, and, on my honor, without at\nall wishing to depreciate the beauty of Mademoiselle Danglars, I cannot\nunderstand how any man can really love her.\"\n\n\"The fact is, Maximilian, that I was there, and my presence had the\neffect of rendering you unjust in your comparison.\"\n\n\"No; but tell me--it is a question of simple curiosity, and which was\nsuggested by certain ideas passing in my mind relative to Mademoiselle\nDanglars\"--\n\n\"I dare say it is something disparaging which you are going to say.\nIt only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex,\"\ninterrupted Valentine.\n\n\"You cannot, at least, deny that you are very harsh judges of each\nother.\"\n\n\"If we are so, it is because we generally judge under the influence of\nexcitement. But return to your question.\"\n\n\"Does Mademoiselle Danglars object to this marriage with M. de Morcerf\non account of loving another?\"\n\n\"I told you I was not on terms of strict intimacy with Eugenie.\"\n\n\"Yes, but girls tell each other secrets without being particularly\nintimate; own, now, that you did question her on the subject. Ah, I see\nyou are smiling.\"\n\n\"If you are already aware of the conversation that passed, the wooden\npartition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight\nsecurity.\"\n\n\"Come, what did she say?\"\n\n\"She told me that she loved no one,\" said Valentine; \"that she disliked\nthe idea of being married; that she would infinitely prefer leading an\nindependent and unfettered life; and that she almost wished her father\nmight lose his fortune, that she might become an artist, like her\nfriend, Mademoiselle Louise d'Armilly.\"\n\n\"Ah, you see\"--\n\n\"Well, what does that prove?\" asked Valentine.\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied Maximilian.\n\n\"Then why did you smile?\"\n\n\"Why, you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself,\nValentine.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to go away?\"\n\n\"Ah, no, no. But do not let us lose time; you are the subject on which I\nwish to speak.\"\n\n\"True, we must be quick, for we have scarcely ten minutes more to pass\ntogether.\"\n\n\"Ma foi,\" said Maximilian, in consternation.\n\n\"Yes, you are right; I am but a poor friend to you. What a life I\ncause you to lead, poor Maximilian, you who are formed for happiness! I\nbitterly reproach myself, I assure you.\"\n\n\"Well, what does it signify, Valentine, so long as I am satisfied, and\nfeel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five\nminutes of your society, or two words from your lips? And I have also\na deep conviction that heaven would not have created two hearts,\nharmonizing as ours do, and almost miraculously brought us together, to\nseparate us at last.\"\n\n\"Those are kind and cheering words. You must hope for us both,\nMaximilian; that will make me at least partly happy.\"\n\n\"But why must you leave me so soon?\"\n\n\"I do not know particulars. I can only tell you that Madame de Villefort\nsent to request my presence, as she had a communication to make on which\na part of my fortune depended. Let them take my fortune, I am already\ntoo rich; and, perhaps, when they have taken it, they will leave me in\npeace and quietness. You would love me as much if I were poor, would you\nnot, Maximilian?\"\n\n\"Oh, I shall always love you. What should I care for either riches or\npoverty, if my Valentine was near me, and I felt certain that no one\ncould deprive me of her? But do you not fear that this communication may\nrelate to your marriage?\"\n\n\"I do not think that is the case.\"\n\n\"However it may be, Valentine, you must not be alarmed. I assure you\nthat, as long as I live, I shall never love any one else!\"\n\n\"You think to reassure me when you say that, Maximilian.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, you are right. I am a brute. But I was going to tell you\nthat I met M. de Morcerf the other day.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Franz is his friend, you know.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Monsieur de Morcerf has received a letter from Franz, announcing his\nimmediate return.\" Valentine turned pale, and leaned her hand against\nthe gate. \"Ah heavens, if it were that! But no, the communication would\nnot come through Madame de Villefort.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because--I scarcely know why--but it has appeared as if Madame de\nVillefort secretly objected to the marriage, although she did not choose\nopenly to oppose it.\"\n\n\"Is it so? Then I feel as if I could adore Madame de Villefort.\"\n\n\"Do not be in such a hurry to do that,\" said Valentine, with a sad\nsmile.\n\n\"If she objects to your marrying M. d'Epinay, she would be all the more\nlikely to listen to any other proposition.\"\n\n\"No, Maximilian, it is not suitors to which Madame de Villefort objects,\nit is marriage itself.\"\n\n\"Marriage? If she dislikes that so much, why did she ever marry\nherself?\"\n\n\"You do not understand me, Maximilian. About a year ago, I talked of\nretiring to a convent. Madame de Villefort, in spite of all the remarks\nwhich she considered it her duty to make, secretly approved of the\nproposition, my father consented to it at her instigation, and it was\nonly on account of my poor grandfather that I finally abandoned the\nproject. You can form no idea of the expression of that old man's eye\nwhen he looks at me, the only person in the world whom he loves, and,\nI had almost said, by whom he is beloved in return. When he learned my\nresolution, I shall never forget the reproachful look which he cast\non me, and the tears of utter despair which chased each other down his\nlifeless cheeks. Ah, Maximilian, I experienced, at that moment,\nsuch remorse for my intention, that, throwing myself at his feet, I\nexclaimed,--'Forgive me, pray forgive me, my dear grandfather; they may\ndo what they will with me, I will never leave you.' When I had ceased\nspeaking, he thankfully raised his eyes to heaven, but without uttering\na word. Ah, Maximilian, I may have much to suffer, but I feel as if my\ngrandfather's look at that moment would more than compensate for all.\"\n\n\"Dear Valentine, you are a perfect angel, and I am sure I do not know\nwhat I--sabring right and left among the Bedouins--can have done to\nmerit your being revealed to me, unless, indeed, heaven took into\nconsideration the fact that the victims of my sword were infidels. But\ntell me what interest Madame de Villefort can have in your remaining\nunmarried?\"\n\n\"Did I not tell you just now that I was rich, Maximilian--too rich? I\npossess nearly 50,000 livres in right of my mother; my grandfather and\nmy grandmother, the Marquis and Marquise de Saint-Meran, will leave\nme as much, and M. Noirtier evidently intends making me his heir. My\nbrother Edward, who inherits nothing from his mother, will, therefore,\nbe poor in comparison with me. Now, if I had taken the veil, all this\nfortune would have descended to my father, and, in reversion, to his\nson.\"\n\n\"Ah, how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful woman should\nbe so avaricious.\"\n\n\"It is not for herself that she is so, but for her son, and what you\nregard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the light of\nmaternal love.\"\n\n\"But could you not compromise matters, and give up a portion of your\nfortune to her son?\"\n\n\"How could I make such a proposition, especially to a woman who always\nprofesses to be so entirely disinterested?\"\n\n\"Valentine, I have always regarded our love in the light of something\nsacred; consequently, I have covered it with the veil of respect, and\nhid it in the innermost recesses of my soul. No human being, not even my\nsister, is aware of its existence. Valentine, will you permit me to make\na confidant of a friend and reveal to him the love I bear you?\"\n\nValentine started. \"A friend, Maximilian; and who is this friend? I\ntremble to give my permission.\"\n\n\"Listen, Valentine. Have you never experienced for any one that sudden\nand irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had\nbeen your old and familiar friend, though, in reality, it was the first\ntime you had ever met? Nay, further, have you never endeavored to recall\nthe time, place, and circumstances of your former intercourse, and\nfailing in this attempt, have almost believed that your spirits must\nhave held converse with each other in some state of being anterior to\nthe present, and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the\npast?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, that is precisely the feeling which I experienced when I first\nsaw that extraordinary man.\"\n\n\"Extraordinary, did you say?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You have known him for some time, then?\"\n\n\"Scarcely longer than eight or ten days.\"\n\n\"And do you call a man your friend whom you have only known for eight\nor ten days? Ah, Maximilian, I had hoped you set a higher value on the\ntitle of friend.\"\n\n\"Your logic is most powerful, Valentine, but say what you will, I can\nnever renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken possession\nof my mind. I feel as if it were ordained that this man should be\nassociated with all the good which the future may have in store for me,\nand sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to\ncome, and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according\nto his own will.\"\n\n\"He must be a prophet, then,\" said Valentine, smiling.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Maximilian, \"I have often been almost tempted to\nattribute to him the gift of prophecy; at all events, he has a wonderful\npower of foretelling any future good.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Valentine in a mournful tone, \"do let me see this man,\nMaximilian; he may tell me whether I shall ever be loved sufficiently to\nmake amends for all I have suffered.\"\n\n\"My poor girl, you know him already.\"\n\n\"I know him?\"\n\n\"Yes; it was he who saved the life of your step-mother and her son.\"\n\n\"The Count of Monte Cristo?\"\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" cried Valentine, \"he is too much the friend of Madame de Villefort\never to be mine.\"\n\n\"The friend of Madame de Villefort! It cannot be; surely, Valentine, you\nare mistaken?\"\n\n\"No, indeed, I am not; for I assure you, his power over our household\nis almost unlimited. Courted by my step-mother, who regards him as the\nepitome of human wisdom; admired by my father, who says he has never\nbefore heard such sublime ideas so eloquently expressed; idolized by\nEdward, who, notwithstanding his fear of the count's large black eyes,\nruns to meet him the moment he arrives, and opens his hand, in which he\nis sure to find some delightful present,--M. de Monte Cristo appears\nto exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the\nmembers of our family.\"\n\n\"If such be the case, my dear Valentine, you must yourself have felt,\nor at all events will soon feel, the effects of his presence. He meets\nAlbert de Morcerf in Italy--it is to rescue him from the hands of the\nbanditti; he introduces himself to Madame Danglars--it is that he may\ngive her a royal present; your step-mother and her son pass before his\ndoor--it is that his Nubian may save them from destruction. This man\nevidently possesses the power of influencing events, both as regards\nmen and things. I never saw more simple tastes united to greater\nmagnificence. His smile is so sweet when he addresses me, that I forget\nit ever can be bitter to others. Ah, Valentine, tell me, if he ever\nlooked on you with one of those sweet smiles? if so, depend on it, you\nwill be happy.\"\n\n\"Me?\" said the young girl, \"he never even glances at me; on the\ncontrary, if I accidentally cross his path, he appears rather to avoid\nme. Ah, he is not generous, neither does he possess that supernatural\npenetration which you attribute to him, for if he did, he would have\nperceived that I was unhappy; and if he had been generous, seeing me\nsad and solitary, he would have used his influence to my advantage, and\nsince, as you say, he resembles the sun, he would have warmed my heart\nwith one of his life-giving rays. You say he loves you, Maximilian; how\ndo you know that he does? All would pay deference to an officer like\nyou, with a fierce mustache and a long sabre, but they think they may\ncrush a poor weeping girl with impunity.\"\n\n\"Ah, Valentine, I assure you you are mistaken.\"\n\n\"If it were otherwise--if he treated me diplomatically--that is to say,\nlike a man who wishes, by some means or other, to obtain a footing in\nthe house, so that he may ultimately gain the power of dictating to its\noccupants--he would, if it had been but once, have honored me with the\nsmile which you extol so loudly; but no, he saw that I was unhappy,\nhe understood that I could be of no use to him, and therefore paid no\nattention to me whatever. Who knows but that, in order to please Madame\nde Villefort and my father, he may not persecute me by every means in\nhis power? It is not just that he should despise me so, without any\nreason. Ah, forgive me,\" said Valentine, perceiving the effect which her\nwords were producing on Maximilian: \"I have done wrong, for I have given\nutterance to thoughts concerning that man which I did not even know\nexisted in my heart. I do not deny the influence of which you speak,\nor that I have not myself experienced it, but with me it has been\nproductive of evil rather than good.\"\n\n\"Well, Valentine,\" said Morrel with a sigh, \"we will not discuss the\nmatter further. I will not make a confidant of him.\"\n\n\"Alas,\" said Valentine, \"I see that I have given you pain. I can only\nsay how sincerely I ask pardon for having griefed you. But, indeed, I am\nnot prejudiced beyond the power of conviction. Tell me what this Count\nof Monte Cristo has done for you.\"\n\n\"I own that your question embarrasses me, Valentine, for I cannot say\nthat the count has rendered me any ostensible service. Still, as I have\nalready told you I have an instinctive affection for him, the source of\nwhich I cannot explain to you. Has the sun done anything for me? No; he\nwarms me with his rays, and it is by his light that I see you--nothing\nmore. Has such and such a perfume done anything for me? No; its odor\ncharms one of my senses--that is all I can say when I am asked why I\npraise it. My friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as\nhis for me. A secret voice seems to whisper to me that there must be\nsomething more than chance in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship.\nIn his most simple actions, as well as in his most secret thoughts, I\nfind a relation to my own. You will perhaps smile at me when I tell you\nthat, ever since I have known this man, I have involuntarily entertained\nthe idea that all the good fortune which has befallen me originated\nfrom him. However, I have managed to live thirty years without this\nprotection, you will say; but I will endeavor a little to illustrate my\nmeaning. He invited me to dine with him on Saturday, which was a very\nnatural thing for him to do. Well, what have I learned since? That your\nmother and M. de Villefort are both coming to this dinner. I shall meet\nthem there, and who knows what future advantages may result from the\ninterview? This may appear to you to be no unusual combination of\ncircumstances; nevertheless, I perceive some hidden plot in the\narrangement--something, in fact, more than is apparent on a casual view\nof the subject. I believe that this singular man, who appears to fathom\nthe motives of every one, has purposely arranged for me to meet M. and\nMadame de Villefort, and sometimes, I confess, I have gone so far as to\ntry to read in his eyes whether he was in possession of the secret of\nour love.\"\n\n\"My good friend,\" said Valentine, \"I should take you for a visionary,\nand should tremble for your reason, if I were always to hear you talk in\na strain similar to this. Is it possible that you can see anything\nmore than the merest chance in this meeting? Pray reflect a little.\nMy father, who never goes out, has several times been on the point\nof refusing this invitation; Madame de Villefort, on the contrary, is\nburning with the desire of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own\nhouse, therefore, she has with great difficulty prevailed on my father\nto accompany her. No, no; it is as I have said, Maximilian,--there is no\none in the world of whom I can ask help but yourself and my grandfather,\nwho is little better than a corpse.\"\n\n\"I see that you are right, logically speaking,\" said Maximilian; \"but\nthe gentle voice which usually has such power over me fails to convince\nme to-day.\"\n\n\"I feel the same as regards yourself.\" said Valentine; \"and I own that,\nif you have no stronger proof to give me\"--\n\n\"I have another,\" replied Maximilian; \"but I fear you will deem it even\nmore absurd than the first.\"\n\n\"So much the worse,\" said Valentine, smiling.\n\n\"It is, nevertheless, conclusive to my mind. My ten years of service\nhave also confirmed my ideas on the subject of sudden inspirations, for\nI have several times owed my life to a mysterious impulse which directed\nme to move at once either to the right or to the left, in order to\nescape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my side, while it\nleft me unharmed.\"\n\n\"Dear Maximilian, why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers\nfor your safety? When you are away, I no longer pray for myself, but for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Yes, since you have known me,\" said Morrel, smiling; \"but that cannot\napply to the time previous to our acquaintance, Valentine.\"\n\n\"You are very provoking, and will not give me credit for anything; but\nlet me hear this second proof, which you yourself own to be absurd.\"\n\n\"Well, look through this opening, and you will see the beautiful new\nhorse which I rode here.\"\n\n\"Ah, what a beautiful creature!\" cried Valentine; \"why did you not bring\nhim close to the gate, so that I could talk to him and pat him?\"\n\n\"He is, as you see, a very valuable animal,\" said Maximilian. \"You know\nthat my means are limited, and that I am what would be designated a man\nof moderate pretensions. Well, I went to a horse dealer's, where I saw\nthis magnificent horse, which I have named Medeah. I asked the price;\nthey told me it was 4,500 francs. I was, therefore, obliged to give it\nup, as you may imagine, but I own I went away with rather a heavy heart,\nfor the horse had looked at me affectionately, had rubbed his head\nagainst me and, when I mounted him, had pranced in the most delightful\nway imaginable, so that I was altogether fascinated with him. The same\nevening some friends of mine visited me,--M. de Chateau-Renaud, M.\nDebray, and five or six other choice spirits, whom you do not know, even\nby name. They proposed a game of bouillotte. I never play, for I am not\nrich enough to afford to lose, or sufficiently poor to desire to gain.\nBut I was at my own house, you understand, so there was nothing to be\ndone but to send for the cards, which I did.\n\n\"Just as they were sitting down to table, M. de Monte Cristo arrived. He\ntook his seat amongst them; they played, and I won. I am almost ashamed\nto say that my gains amounted to 5,000 francs. We separated at midnight.\nI could not defer my pleasure, so I took a cabriolet and drove to the\nhorse dealer's. Feverish and excited, I rang at the door. The person who\nopened it must have taken me for a madman, for I rushed at once to the\nstable. Medeah was standing at the rack, eating his hay. I immediately\nput on the saddle and bridle, to which operation he lent himself with\nthe best grace possible; then, putting the 4,500 francs into the hands\nof the astonished dealer, I proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing\nthe night in riding in the Champs Elysees. As I rode by the count's\nhouse I perceived a light in one of the windows, and fancied I saw the\nshadow of his figure moving behind the curtain. Now, Valentine, I firmly\nbelieve that he knew of my wish to possess this horse, and that he lost\nexpressly to give me the means of procuring him.\"\n\n\"My dear Maximilian, you are really too fanciful; you will not love even\nme long. A man who accustoms himself to live in such a world of poetry\nand imagination must find far too little excitement in a common,\nevery-day sort of attachment such as ours. But they are calling me. Do\nyou hear?\"\n\n\"Ah, Valentine,\" said Maximilian, \"give me but one finger through this\nopening in the grating, one finger, the littlest finger of all, that I\nmay have the happiness of kissing it.\"\n\n\"Maximilian, we said we would be to each other as two voices, two\nshadows.\"\n\n\"As you will, Valentine.\"\n\n\"Shall you be happy if I do what you wish?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" Valentine mounted on a bench, and passed not only her finger\nbut her whole hand through the opening. Maximilian uttered a cry of\ndelight, and, springing forwards, seized the hand extended towards him,\nand imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss. The little hand was\nthen immediately withdrawn, and the young man saw Valentine hurrying\ntowards the house, as though she were almost terrified at her own\nsensations.\n\n\n\nChapter 58. M. Noirtier de Villefort.\n\nWe will now relate what was passing in the house of the king's attorney\nafter the departure of Madame Danglars and her daughter, and during the\ntime of the conversation between Maximilian and Valentine, which we have\njust detailed. M. de Villefort entered his father's room, followed by\nMadame de Villefort. Both of the visitors, after saluting the old man\nand speaking to Barrois, a faithful servant, who had been twenty-five\nyears in his service, took their places on either side of the paralytic.\n\nM. Noirtier was sitting in an arm-chair, which moved upon casters, in\nwhich he was wheeled into the room in the morning, and in the same way\ndrawn out again at night. He was placed before a large glass, which\nreflected the whole apartment, and so, without any attempt to move,\nwhich would have been impossible, he could see all who entered the room\nand everything which was going on around him. M. Noirtier, although\nalmost as immovable as a corpse, looked at the new-comers with a quick\nand intelligent expression, perceiving at once, by their ceremonious\ncourtesy, that they were come on business of an unexpected and official\ncharacter. Sight and hearing were the only senses remaining, and they,\nlike two solitary sparks, remained to animate the miserable body which\nseemed fit for nothing but the grave; it was only, however, by means of\none of these senses that he could reveal the thoughts and feelings that\nstill occupied his mind, and the look by which he gave expression to his\ninner life was like the distant gleam of a candle which a traveller sees\nby night across some desert place, and knows that a living being dwells\nbeyond the silence and obscurity. Noirtier's hair was long and white,\nand flowed over his shoulders; while in his eyes, shaded by thick black\nlashes, was concentrated, as it often happens with an organ which is\nused to the exclusion of the others, all the activity, address, force,\nand intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole body; and\nso although the movement of the arm, the sound of the voice, and the\nagility of the body, were wanting, the speaking eye sufficed for all.\nHe commanded with it; it was the medium through which his thanks were\nconveyed. In short, his whole appearance produced on the mind the\nimpression of a corpse with living eyes, and nothing could be more\nstartling than to observe the expression of anger or joy suddenly\nlighting up these organs, while the rest of the rigid and marble-like\nfeatures were utterly deprived of the power of participation. Three\npersons only could understand this language of the poor paralytic; these\nwere Villefort, Valentine, and the old servant of whom we have already\nspoken. But as Villefort saw his father but seldom, and then only when\nabsolutely obliged, and as he never took any pains to please or gratify\nhim when he was there, all the old man's happiness was centred in his\ngranddaughter. Valentine, by means of her love, her patience, and her\ndevotion, had learned to read in Noirtier's look all the varied feelings\nwhich were passing in his mind. To this dumb language, which was so\nunintelligible to others, she answered by throwing her whole soul\ninto the expression of her countenance, and in this manner were the\nconversations sustained between the blooming girl and the helpless\ninvalid, whose body could scarcely be called a living one, but who,\nnevertheless, possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration, united with\na will as powerful as ever although clogged by a body rendered utterly\nincapable of obeying its impulses. Valentine had solved the problem,\nand was able easily to understand his thoughts, and to convey her own in\nreturn, and, through her untiring and devoted assiduity, it was seldom\nthat, in the ordinary transactions of every-day life, she failed to\nanticipate the wishes of the living, thinking mind, or the wants of the\nalmost inanimate body. As to the servant, he had, as we have said, been\nwith his master for five and twenty years, therefore he knew all his\nhabits, and it was seldom that Noirtier found it necessary to ask for\nanything, so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of\nthe invalid. Villefort did not need the help of either Valentine or the\ndomestic in order to carry on with his father the strange conversation\nwhich he was about to begin. As we have said, he perfectly understood\nthe old man's vocabulary, and if he did not use it more often, it\nwas only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing. He\ntherefore allowed Valentine to go into the garden, sent away Barrois,\nand after having seated himself at his father's right hand, while Madame\nde Villefort placed herself on the left, he addressed him thus:--\n\n\"I trust you will not be displeased, sir, that Valentine has not come\nwith us, or that I dismissed Barrois, for our conference will be one\nwhich could not with propriety be carried on in the presence of either.\nMadame de Villefort and I have a communication to make to you.\"\n\nNoirtier's face remained perfectly passive during this long preamble,\nwhile, on the contrary, Villefort's eye was endeavoring to penetrate\ninto the inmost recesses of the old man's heart.\n\n\"This communication,\" continued the procureur, in that cold and decisive\ntone which seemed at once to preclude all discussion, \"will, we are\nsure, meet with your approbation.\" The eye of the invalid still retained\nthat vacancy of expression which prevented his son from obtaining any\nknowledge of the feelings which were passing in his mind; he listened,\nnothing more. \"Sir,\" resumed Villefort, \"we are thinking of marrying\nValentine.\" Had the old man's face been moulded in wax it could not have\nshown less emotion at this news than was now to be traced there. \"The\nmarriage will take place in less than three months,\" said Villefort.\nNoirtier's eye still retained its inanimate expression.\n\nMadame de Villefort now took her part in the conversation and\nadded,--\"We thought this news would possess an interest for you,\nsir, who have always entertained a great affection for Valentine; it\ntherefore only now remains for us to tell you the name of the young man\nfor whom she is destined. It is one of the most desirable connections\nwhich could possibly be formed; he possesses fortune, a high rank in\nsociety, and every personal qualification likely to render Valentine\nsupremely happy,--his name, moreover, cannot be wholly unknown to you.\nIt is M. Franz de Quesnel, Baron d'Epinay.\"\n\nWhile his wife was speaking, Villefort had narrowly watched the old\nman's countenance. When Madame de Villefort pronounced the name of\nFranz, the pupil of M. Noirtier's eye began to dilate, and his eyelids\ntrembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the lips of an\nindividual about to speak, and he darted a lightning glance at Madame\nde Villefort and his son. The procureur, who knew the political hatred\nwhich had formerly existed between M. Noirtier and the elder d'Epinay,\nwell understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had\nproduced; but, feigning not to perceive either, he immediately resumed\nthe narrative begun by his wife. \"Sir,\" said he, \"you are aware that\nValentine is about to enter her nineteenth year, which renders it\nimportant that she should lose no time in forming a suitable alliance.\nNevertheless, you have not been forgotten in our plans, and we have\nfully ascertained beforehand that Valentine's future husband will\nconsent, not to live in this house, for that might not be pleasant for\nthe young people, but that you should live with them; so that you and\nValentine, who are so attached to each other, would not be separated,\nand you would be able to pursue exactly the same course of life which\nyou have hitherto done, and thus, instead of losing, you will be a\ngainer by the change, as it will secure to you two children instead of\none, to watch over and comfort you.\"\n\nNoirtier's look was furious; it was very evident that something\ndesperate was passing in the old man's mind, for a cry of anger and\ngrief rose in his throat, and not being able to find vent in utterance,\nappeared almost to choke him, for his face and lips turned quite purple\nwith the struggle. Villefort quietly opened a window, saying, \"It is\nvery warm, and the heat affects M. Noirtier.\" He then returned to his\nplace, but did not sit down. \"This marriage,\" added Madame de Villefort,\n\"is quite agreeable to the wishes of M. d'Epinay and his family;\nbesides, he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt, his mother\nhaving died at his birth, and his father having been assassinated\nin 1815, that is to say, when he was but two years old; it naturally\nfollowed that the child was permitted to choose his own pursuits, and he\nhas, therefore, seldom acknowledged any other authority but that of his\nown will.\"\n\n\"That assassination was a mysterious affair,\" said Villefort, \"and the\nperpetrators have hitherto escaped detection, although suspicion has\nfallen on the head of more than one person.\" Noirtier made such an\neffort that his lips expanded into a smile.\n\n\"Now,\" continued Villefort, \"those to whom the guilt really belongs,\nby whom the crime was committed, on whose heads the justice of man may\nprobably descend here, and the certain judgment of God hereafter,\nwould rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such\na peace-offering as Valentine on the son of him whose life they so\nruthlessly destroyed.\" Noirtier had succeeded in mastering his emotion\nmore than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and\nshattered frame. \"Yes, I understand,\" was the reply contained in his\nlook; and this look expressed a feeling of strong indignation, mixed\nwith profound contempt. Villefort fully understood his father's meaning,\nand answered by a slight shrug of his shoulders. He then motioned to his\nwife to take leave. \"Now sir,\" said Madame de Villefort, \"I must bid you\nfarewell. Would you like me to send Edward to you for a short time?\"\n\nIt had been agreed that the old man should express his approbation by\nclosing his eyes, his refusal by winking them several times, and if he\nhad some desire or feeling to express, he raised them to heaven. If\nhe wanted Valentine, he closed his right eye only, and if Barrois, the\nleft. At Madame de Villefort's proposition he instantly winked his eyes.\nProvoked by a complete refusal, she bit her lip and said, \"Then shall\nI send Valentine to you?\" The old man closed his eyes eagerly, thereby\nintimating that such was his wish. M. and Madame de Villefort bowed and\nleft the room, giving orders that Valentine should be summoned to her\ngrandfather's presence, and feeling sure that she would have much to do\nto restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid. Valentine,\nwith a color still heightened by emotion, entered the room just after\nher parents had quitted it. One look was sufficient to tell her that her\ngrandfather was suffering, and that there was much on his mind which he\nwas wishing to communicate to her. \"Dear grandpapa,\" cried she, \"what\nhas happened? They have vexed you, and you are angry?\" The paralytic\nclosed his eyes in token of assent. \"Who has displeased you? Is it my\nfather?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Madame de Villefort?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Me?\" The former sign was repeated. \"Are you displeased with me?\" cried\nValentine in astonishment. M. Noirtier again closed his eyes. \"And what\nhave I done, dear grandpapa, that you should be angry with me?\" cried\nValentine.\n\nThere was no answer, and she continued. \"I have not seen you all day.\nHas any one been speaking to you against me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man's look, with eagerness.\n\n\"Let me think a moment. I do assure you, grandpapa--Ah--M. and Madame de\nVillefort have just left this room, have they not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And it was they who told you something which made you angry? What\nwas it then? May I go and ask them, that I may have the opportunity of\nmaking my peace with you?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Noirtier's look.\n\n\"Ah, you frighten me. What can they have said?\" and she again tried to\nthink what it could be.\n\n\"Ah, I know,\" said she, lowering her voice and going close to the old\nman. \"They have been speaking of my marriage,--have they not?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the angry look.\n\n\"I understand; you are displeased at the silence I have preserved on the\nsubject. The reason of it was, that they had insisted on my keeping the\nmatter a secret, and begged me not to tell you anything of it. They did\nnot even acquaint me with their intentions, and I only discovered them\nby chance, that is why I have been so reserved with you, dear grandpapa.\nPray forgive me.\" But there was no look calculated to reassure her; all\nit seemed to say was, \"It is not only your reserve which afflicts me.\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\" asked the young girl. \"Perhaps you think I shall\nabandon you, dear grandpapa, and that I shall forget you when I am\nmarried?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"They told you, then, that M. d'Epinay consented to our all living\ntogether?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then why are you still vexed and grieved?\" The old man's eyes beamed\nwith an expression of gentle affection. \"Yes, I understand,\" said\nValentine; \"it is because you love me.\" The old man assented. \"And you\nare afraid I shall be unhappy?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You do not like M. Franz?\" The eyes repeated several times, \"No, no,\nno.\"\n\n\"Then you are vexed with the engagement?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, listen,\" said Valentine, throwing herself on her knees, and\nputting her arm round her grandfather's neck, \"I am vexed, too, for I do\nnot love M. Franz d'Epinay.\" An expression of intense joy illumined the\nold man's eyes. \"When I wished to retire into a convent, you remember\nhow angry you were with me?\" A tear trembled in the eye of the invalid.\n\"Well,\" continued Valentine, \"the reason of my proposing it was that\nI might escape this hateful marriage, which drives me to despair.\"\nNoirtier's breathing came thick and short. \"Then the idea of this\nmarriage really grieves you too? Ah, if you could but help me--if we\ncould both together defeat their plan! But you are unable to oppose\nthem,--you, whose mind is so quick, and whose will is so firm are\nnevertheless, as weak and unequal to the contest as I am myself. Alas,\nyou, who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the days\nof your health and strength, can now only sympathize in my joys and\nsorrows, without being able to take any active part in them. However,\nthis is much, and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all\nmy blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness.\"\n\nAt these words there appeared in Noirtier's eye an expression of such\ndeep meaning that the young girl thought she could read these words\nthere: \"You are mistaken; I can still do much for you.\"\n\n\"Do you think you can help me, dear grandpapa?\" said Valentine.\n\n\"Yes.\" Noirtier raised his eyes, it was the sign agreed on between him\nand Valentine when he wanted anything.\n\n\"What is it you want, dear grandpapa?\" said Valentine, and she\nendeavored to recall to mind all the things which he would be likely to\nneed; and as the ideas presented themselves to her mind, she repeated\nthem aloud, then,--finding that all her efforts elicited nothing but a\nconstant \"No,\"--she said, \"Come, since this plan does not answer, I\nwill have recourse to another.\" She then recited all the letters of the\nalphabet from A down to N. When she arrived at that letter the paralytic\nmade her understand that she had spoken the initial letter of the thing\nhe wanted. \"Ah,\" said Valentine, \"the thing you desire begins with the\nletter N; it is with N that we have to do, then. Well, let me see, what\ncan you want that begins with N? Na--Ne--Ni--No\"--\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes,\" said the old man's eye.\n\n\"Ah, it is No, then?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Valentine fetched a dictionary, which she placed on a desk\nbefore Noirtier; she opened it, and, seeing that the odd man's eye was\nthoroughly fixed on its pages, she ran her finger quickly up and down\nthe columns. During the six years which had passed since Noirtier first\nfell into this sad state, Valentine's powers of invention had been too\noften put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients\nfor gaining a knowledge of his wishes, and the constant practice had\nso perfected her in the art that she guessed the old man's meaning as\nquickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted. At\nthe word \"Notary,\" Noirtier made a sign to her to stop. \"Notary,\" said\nshe, \"do you want a notary, dear grandpapa?\" The old man again signified\nthat it was a notary he desired.\n\n\"You would wish a notary to be sent for then?\" said Valentine.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Shall my father be informed of your wish?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you wish the notary to be sent for immediately?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then they shall go for him directly, dear grandpapa. Is that all you\nwant?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Valentine rang the bell, and ordered the servant to tell Monsieur\nor Madame de Villefort that they were requested to come to M. Noirtier's\nroom. \"Are you satisfied now?\" inquired Valentine.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I am sure you are; it is not very difficult to discover that,\"--and the\nyoung girl smiled on her grandfather, as if he had been a child. M. de\nVillefort entered, followed by Barrois. \"What do you want me for, sir?\"\ndemanded he of the paralytic.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Valentine, \"my grandfather wishes for a notary.\" At this\nstrange and unexpected demand M. de Villefort and his father exchanged\nlooks. \"Yes,\" motioned the latter, with a firmness which seemed to\ndeclare that with the help of Valentine and his old servant, who\nboth knew what his wishes were, he was quite prepared to maintain the\ncontest. \"Do you wish for a notary?\" asked Villefort.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What to do?\"\n\nNoirtier made no answer. \"What do you want with a notary?\" again\nrepeated Villefort. The invalid's eye remained fixed, by which\nexpression he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable.\n\"Is it to do us some ill turn? Do you think it is worth while?\" said\nVillefort.\n\n\"Still,\" said Barrois, with the freedom and fidelity of an old servant,\n\"if M. Noirtier asks for a notary, I suppose he really wishes for\na notary; therefore I shall go at once and fetch one.\" Barrois\nacknowledged no master but Noirtier, and never allowed his desires in\nany way to be contradicted.\n\n\"Yes, I do want a notary,\" motioned the old man, shutting his eyes with\na look of defiance, which seemed to say, \"and I should like to see the\nperson who dares to refuse my request.\"\n\n\"You shall have a notary, as you absolutely wish for one, sir,\" said\nVillefort; \"but I shall explain to him your state of health, and make\nexcuses for you, for the scene cannot fail of being a most ridiculous\none.\"\n\n\"Never mind that,\" said Barrois; \"I shall go and fetch a notary,\nnevertheless,\"--and the old servant departed triumphantly on his\nmission.\n\n\n\nChapter 59. The Will.\n\nAs soon as Barrois had left the room, Noirtier looked at Valentine with\na malicious expression that said many things. The young girl perfectly\nunderstood the look, and so did Villefort, for his countenance became\nclouded, and he knitted his eyebrows angrily. He took a seat, and\nquietly awaited the arrival of the notary. Noirtier saw him seat himself\nwith an appearance of perfect indifference, at the same time giving a\nside look at Valentine, which made her understand that she also was to\nremain in the room. Three-quarters of an hour after, Barrois returned,\nbringing the notary with him. \"Sir,\" said Villefort, after the first\nsalutations were over, \"you were sent for by M. Noirtier, whom you see\nhere. All his limbs have become completely paralysed, he has lost his\nvoice also, and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch\nsome fragments of his meaning.\" Noirtier cast an appealing look on\nValentine, which look was at once so earnest and imperative, that\nshe answered immediately. \"Sir,\" said she, \"I perfectly understand my\ngrandfather's meaning at all times.\"\n\n\"That is quite true,\" said Barrois; \"and that is what I told the\ngentleman as we walked along.\"\n\n\"Permit me,\" said the notary, turning first to Villefort and then to\nValentine--\"permit me to state that the case in question is just one\nof those in which a public officer like myself cannot proceed to act\nwithout thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility. The first\nthing necessary to render an act valid is, that the notary should be\nthoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and\nwishes of the person dictating the act. Now I cannot be sure of the\napprobation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak, and as the\nobject of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to\nme, on account of his want of speech, my services here would be quite\nuseless, and cannot be legally exercised.\" The notary then prepared to\nretire. An imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed on the lips of\nthe procureur. Noirtier looked at Valentine with an expression so full\nof grief, that she arrested the departure of the notary. \"Sir,\" said\nshe, \"the language which I speak with my grandfather may be easily\nlearnt, and I can teach you in a few minutes, to understand it almost as\nwell as I can myself. Will you tell me what you require, in order to set\nyour conscience quite at ease on the subject?\"\n\n\"In order to render an act valid, I must be certain of the approbation\nor disapprobation of my client. Illness of body would not affect the\nvalidity of the deed, but sanity of mind is absolutely requisite.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, by the help of two signs, with which I will acquaint you\npresently, you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather\nis still in the full possession of all his mental faculties. M.\nNoirtier, being deprived of voice and motion, is accustomed to convey\nhis meaning by closing his eyes when he wishes to signify 'yes,' and\nto wink when he means 'no.' You now know quite enough to enable you to\nconverse with M. Noirtier;--try.\" Noirtier gave Valentine such a look\nof tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the notary\nhimself. \"You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been\nsaying, sir, have you?\" asked the notary. Noirtier closed his eyes. \"And\nyou approve of what she said--that is to say, you declare that the\nsigns which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are\naccustomed to convey your thoughts?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It was you who sent for me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"To make your will?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original\nintentions?\" The old man winked violently. \"Well, sir,\" said the young\ngirl, \"do you understand now, and is your conscience perfectly at rest\non the subject?\" But before the notary could answer, Villefort had drawn\nhim aside. \"Sir,\" said he, \"do you suppose for a moment that a man can\nsustain a physical shock, such as M. Noirtier has received, without any\ndetriment to his mental faculties?\"\n\n\"It is not exactly that, sir,\" said the notary, \"which makes me uneasy,\nbut the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and intentions, so as\nto be able to get his answers.\"\n\n\"You must see that to be an utter impossibility,\" said Villefort.\nValentine and the old man heard this conversation, and Noirtier fixed\nhis eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to the\nlook.\n\n\"Sir,\" said she, \"that need not make you uneasy, however difficult it\nmay at first sight appear to be. I can discover and explain to you my\ngrandfather's thoughts, so as to put an end to all your doubts and fears\non the subject. I have now been six years with M. Noirtier, and let him\ntell you if ever once, during that time, he has entertained a thought\nwhich he was unable to make me understand.\"\n\n\"No,\" signed the old man.\n\n\"Let us try what we can do, then,\" said the notary. \"You accept this\nyoung lady as your interpreter, M. Noirtier?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, what do you require of me, and what document is it that you\nwish to be drawn up?\" Valentine named all the letters of the alphabet\nuntil she came to W. At this letter the eloquent eye of Noirtier gave\nher notice that she was to stop. \"It is very evident that it is the\nletter W which M. Noirtier wants,\" said the notary. \"Wait,\"\nsaid Valentine; and, turning to her grandfather, she repeated,\n\"Wa--We--Wi\"--The old man stopped her at the last syllable. Valentine\nthen took the dictionary, and the notary watched her while she turned\nover the pages. She passed her finger slowly down the columns, and when\nshe came to the word \"Will,\" M. Noirtier's eye bade her stop. \"Will,\"\nsaid the notary; \"it is very evident that M. Noirtier is desirous of\nmaking his will.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes,\" motioned the invalid.\n\n\"Really, sir, you must allow that this is most extraordinary,\" said\nthe astonished notary, turning to M. de Villefort. \"Yes,\" said the\nprocureur, \"and I think the will promises to be yet more extraordinary,\nfor I cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of\nValentine, and she may, perhaps, be considered as too much interested in\nits contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure\nand ill-defined wishes of her grandfather.\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" replied the eye of the paralytic.\n\n\"What?\" said Villefort, \"do you mean to say that Valentine is not\ninterested in your will?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the notary, whose interest had been greatly excited, and\nwho had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of this\nextraordinary and picturesque scene, \"what appeared so impossible to me\nan hour ago, has now become quite easy and practicable, and this may\nbe a perfectly valid will, provided it be read in the presence of seven\nwitnesses, approved by the testator, and sealed by the notary in the\npresence of the witnesses. As to the time, it will not require very much\nmore than the generality of wills. There are certain forms necessary to\nbe gone through, and which are always the same. As to the details, the\ngreater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in which we\nfind the affairs of the testator, and by yourself, who, having had the\nmanagement of them, can doubtless give full information on the subject.\nBut besides all this, in order that the instrument may not be contested,\nI am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity, therefore,\none of my colleagues will help me, and, contrary to custom, will assist\nin the dictation of the testament. Are you satisfied, sir?\" continued\nthe notary, addressing the old man.\n\n\"Yes,\" looked the invalid, his eye beaming with delight at the ready\ninterpretation of his meaning.\n\n\"What is he going to do?\" thought Villefort, whose position demanded\nmuch reserve, but who was longing to know what his father's intentions\nwere. He left the room to give orders for another notary to be sent, but\nBarrois, who had heard all that passed, had guessed his master's wishes,\nand had already gone to fetch one. The procureur then told his wife to\ncome up. In the course of a quarter of an hour every one had assembled\nin the chamber of the paralytic; the second notary had also arrived. A\nfew words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers\nof the law. They read to Noirtier the formal copy of a will, in order\nto give him an idea of the terms in which such documents are generally\ncouched; then, in order to test the capacity of the testator, the first\nnotary said, turning towards him,--\"When an individual makes his will,\nit is generally in favor or in prejudice of some person.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation; you\nwill stop me when I reach the one representing the amount of your own\npossessions?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" There was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation. Never had\nthe struggle between mind and matter been more apparent than now, and\nif it was not a sublime, it was, at least, a curious spectacle. They had\nformed a circle round the invalid; the second notary was sitting at a\ntable, prepared for writing, and his colleague was standing before the\ntestator in the act of interrogating him on the subject to which we have\nalluded. \"Your fortune exceeds 300,000. francs, does it not?\" asked\nhe. Noirtier made a sign that it did. \"Do you possess 400,000 francs?\"\ninquired the notary. Noirtier's eye remained immovable. \"Five\nhundred thousand?\" The same expression continued. \"Six hundred\nthousand--700,000--800,000--900,000?\" Noirtier stopped him at the\nlast-named sum. \"You are then in possession of 900,000. francs?\" asked\nthe notary. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"In landed property?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"In stock?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The stock is in your own hands?\" The look which M. Noirtier cast on\nBarrois showed that there was something wanting which he knew where to\nfind. The old servant left the room, and presently returned, bringing\nwith him a small casket. \"Do you permit us to open this casket?\" asked\nthe notary. Noirtier gave his assent. They opened it, and found 900,000.\nfrancs in bank scrip. The first notary handed over each note, as he\nexamined it, to his colleague.\n\nThe total amount was found to be as M. Noirtier had stated. \"It is all\nas he has said; it is very evident that the mind still retains its full\nforce and vigor.\" Then, turning towards the paralytic, he said, \"You\npossess, then, 900,000. francs of capital, which, according to the\nmanner in which you have invested it, ought to bring in an income of\nabout 40,000 livres?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"To whom do you desire to leave this fortune?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Madame de Villefort, \"there is not much doubt on that\nsubject. M. Noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter, Mademoiselle de\nVillefort; it is she who has nursed and tended him for six years, and\nhas, by her devoted attention, fully secured the affection, I had almost\nsaid the gratitude, of her grandfather, and it is but just that she\nshould reap the fruit of her devotion.\" The eye of Noirtier clearly\nshowed by its expression that he was not deceived by the false assent\ngiven by Madame de Villefort's words and manner to the motives which she\nsupposed him to entertain. \"Is it, then, to Mademoiselle Valentine de\nVillefort that you leave these 900,000 francs?\" demanded the notary,\nthinking he had only to insert this clause, but waiting first for the\nassent of Noirtier, which it was necessary should be given before all\nthe witnesses of this singular scene. Valentine, when her name was\nmade the subject of discussion, had stepped back, to escape unpleasant\nobservation; her eyes were cast down, and she was crying. The old\nman looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest\ntenderness, then, turning towards the notary, he significantly winked\nhis eye in token of dissent.\n\n\"What,\" said the notary, \"do you not intend making Mademoiselle\nValentine de Villefort your residuary legatee?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You are not making any mistake, are you?\" said the notary; \"you really\nmean to declare that such is not your intention?\"\n\n\"No,\" repeated Noirtier; \"No.\" Valentine raised her head, struck dumb\nwith astonishment. It was not so much the conviction that she was\ndisinherited that caused her grief, but her total inability to account\nfor the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an act. But\nNoirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she\nexclaimed, \"Oh, grandpapa, I see now that it is only your fortune of\nwhich you deprive me; you still leave me the love which I have always\nenjoyed.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, most assuredly,\" said the eyes of the paralytic, for he closed\nthem with an expression which Valentine could not mistake. \"Thank you,\nthank you,\" murmured she. The old man's declaration that Valentine\nwas not the destined inheritor of his fortune had excited the hopes of\nMadame de Villefort; she gradually approached the invalid, and said:\n\"Then, doubtless, dear M. Noirtier, you intend leaving your fortune\nto your grandson, Edward de Villefort?\" The winking of the eyes which\nanswered this speech was most decided and terrible, and expressed a\nfeeling almost amounting to hatred.\n\n\"No?\" said the notary; \"then, perhaps, it is to your son, M. de\nVillefort?\"\n\n\"No.\" The two notaries looked at each other in mute astonishment and\ninquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator. Villefort\nand his wife both grew red, one from shame, the other from anger.\n\n\"What have we all done, then, dear grandpapa?\" said Valentine; \"you no\nlonger seem to love any of us?\" The old man's eyes passed rapidly\nfrom Villefort and his wife, and rested on Valentine with a look of\nunutterable fondness. \"Well,\" said she; \"if you love me, grandpapa, try\nand bring that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment.\nYou know me well enough to be quite sure that I have never thought\nof your fortune; besides, they say I am already rich in right of my\nmother--too rich, even. Explain yourself, then.\" Noirtier fixed his\nintelligent eyes on Valentine's hand. \"My hand?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Her hand!\" exclaimed every one.\n\n\"Oh, gentlemen, you see it is all useless, and that my father's mind is\nreally impaired,\" said Villefort.\n\n\"Ah,\" cried Valentine suddenly, \"I understand. It is my marriage you\nmean, is it not, dear grandpapa?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes,\" signed the paralytic, casting on Valentine a look of\njoyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning.\n\n\"You are angry with us all on account of this marriage, are you not?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Really, this is too absurd,\" said Villefort.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" replied the notary; \"on the contrary, the meaning of\nM. Noirtier is quite evident to me, and I can quite easily connect the\ntrain of ideas passing in his mind.\"\n\n\"You do not wish me to marry M. Franz d'Epinay?\" observed Valentine.\n\n\"I do not wish it,\" said the eye of her grandfather. \"And you disinherit\nyour granddaughter,\" continued the notary, \"because she has contracted\nan engagement contrary to your wishes?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So that, but for this marriage, she would have been your heir?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" There was a profound silence. The two notaries were holding\na consultation as to the best means of proceeding with the affair.\nValentine was looking at her grandfather with a smile of intense\ngratitude, and Villefort was biting his lips with vexation, while Madame\nde Villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward feeling of joy,\nwhich, in spite of herself, appeared in her whole countenance. \"But,\"\nsaid Villefort, who was the first to break the silence, \"I consider that\nI am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in question. I am\nthe only person possessing the right to dispose of my daughter's hand.\nIt is my wish that she should marry M. Franz d'Epinay--and she shall\nmarry him.\" Valentine sank weeping into a chair.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the notary, \"how do you intend disposing of your fortune in\ncase Mademoiselle de Villefort still determines on marrying M. Franz?\"\nThe old man gave no answer. \"You will, of course, dispose of it in some\nway or other?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"In favor of some member of your family?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes, then?\" pursued the\nnotary.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the notary, \"you are aware that the law does not allow a son\nto be entirely deprived of his patrimony?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You only intend, then, to dispose of that part of your fortune which\nthe law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son?\"\nNoirtier made no answer. \"Do you still wish to dispose of all?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But they will contest the will after your death?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"My father knows me,\" replied Villefort; \"he is quite sure that his\nwishes will be held sacred by me; besides, he understands that in my\nposition I cannot plead against the poor.\" The eye of Noirtier beamed\nwith triumph. \"What do you decide on, sir?\" asked the notary of\nVillefort.\n\n\"Nothing, sir; it is a resolution which my father has taken and I know\nhe never alters his mind. I am quite resigned. These 900,000 francs\nwill go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital; but it is\nridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man, and I shall,\ntherefore, act according to my conscience.\" Having said this, Villefort\nquitted the room with his wife, leaving his father at liberty to do as\nhe pleased. The same day the will was made, the witnesses were brought,\nit was approved by the old man, sealed in the presence of all and given\nin charge to M. Deschamps, the family notary.\n\n\n\nChapter 60. The Telegraph.\n\nM. and Madame de Villefort found on their return that the Count of Monte\nCristo, who had come to visit them in their absence, had been ushered\ninto the drawing-room, and was still awaiting them there. Madame de\nVillefort, who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late emotion\nto allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately, retired to her\nbedroom, while the procureur, who could better depend upon himself,\nproceeded at once to the salon. Although M. de Villefort flattered\nhimself that, to all outward view, he had completely masked the feelings\nwhich were passing in his mind, he did not know that the cloud was\nstill lowering on his brow, so much so that the count, whose smile was\nradiant, immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful air. \"Ma foi,\"\nsaid Monte Cristo, after the first compliments were over, \"what is the\nmatter with you, M. de Villefort? Have I arrived at the moment when you\nwere drawing up an indictment for a capital crime?\" Villefort tried to\nsmile. \"No, count,\" he replied, \"I am the only victim in this case. It\nis I who lose my cause, and it is ill-luck, obstinacy, and folly which\nhave caused it to be decided against me.\"\n\n\"To what do you refer?\" said Monte Cristo with well-feigned interest.\n\"Have you really met with some great misfortune?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, monsieur,\" said Villefort with a bitter smile; \"it is only a\nloss of money which I have sustained--nothing worth mentioning, I assure\nyou.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Monte Cristo, \"the loss of a sum of money becomes almost\nimmaterial with a fortune such as you possess, and to one of your\nphilosophic spirit.\"\n\n\"It is not so much the loss of the money that vexes me,\" said Villefort,\n\"though, after all, 900,000 francs are worth regretting; but I am the\nmore annoyed with this fate, chance, or whatever you please to call the\npower which has destroyed my hopes and my fortune, and may blast the\nprospects of my child also, as it is all occasioned by an old man\nrelapsed into second childhood.\"\n\n\"What do you say?\" said the count; \"900,000 francs? It is indeed a sum\nwhich might be regretted even by a philosopher. And who is the cause of\nall this annoyance?\"\n\n\"My father, as I told you.\"\n\n\"M. Noirtier? But I thought you told me he had become entirely\nparalyzed, and that all his faculties were completely destroyed?\"\n\n\"Yes, his bodily faculties, for he can neither move nor speak,\nnevertheless he thinks, acts, and wills in the manner I have described.\nI left him about five minutes ago, and he is now occupied in dictating\nhis will to two notaries.\"\n\n\"But to do this he must have spoken?\"\n\n\"He has done better than that--he has made himself understood.\"\n\n\"How was such a thing possible?\"\n\n\"By the help of his eyes, which are still full of life, and, as you\nperceive, possess the power of inflicting mortal injury.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Madame de Villefort, who had just entered the room,\n\"perhaps you exaggerate the evil.\"\n\n\"Good-morning, madame,\" said the count, bowing. Madame de Villefort\nacknowledged the salutation with one of her most gracious smiles. \"What\nis this that M. de Villefort has been telling me?\" demanded Monte Cristo\n\"and what incomprehensible misfortune\"--\n\n\"Incomprehensible is not the word,\" interrupted the procureur, shrugging\nhis shoulders. \"It is an old man's caprice.\"\n\n\"And is there no means of making him revoke his decision?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Madame de Villefort; \"and it is still entirely in the power\nof my husband to cause the will, which is now in prejudice of Valentine,\nto be altered in her favor.\" The count, who perceived that M. and Madame\nde Villefort were beginning to speak in parables, appeared to pay no\nattention to the conversation, and feigned to be busily engaged in\nwatching Edward, who was mischievously pouring some ink into the bird's\nwater-glass. \"My dear,\" said Villefort, in answer to his wife, \"you know\nI have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my family, nor\nhave I ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by\nmy nod. Nevertheless, it is necessary that my will should be respected\nin my family, and that the folly of an old man and the caprice of\na child should not be allowed to overturn a project which I have\nentertained for so many years. The Baron d'Epinay was my friend, as you\nknow, and an alliance with his son is the most suitable thing that could\npossibly be arranged.\"\n\n\"Do you think,\" said Madame de Villefort, \"that Valentine is in league\nwith him? She has always been opposed to this marriage, and I should not\nbe at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is nothing but\nthe execution of a plan concerted between them.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said Villefort, \"believe me, a fortune of 900,000. francs is\nnot so easily renounced.\"\n\n\"She could, nevertheless, make up her mind to renounce the world, sir,\nsince it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a\nconvent.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" replied Villefort; \"I say that this marriage shall be\nconsummated.\"\n\n\"Notwithstanding your father's wishes to the contrary?\" said Madame de\nVillefort, selecting a new point of attack. \"That is a serious thing.\"\nMonte Cristo, who pretended not to be listening, heard however, every\nword that was said. \"Madame,\" replied Villefort \"I can truly say that\nI have always entertained a high respect for my father, because, to the\nnatural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral\nsuperiority. The name of father is sacred in two senses; he should be\nreverenced as the author of our being and as a master whom we ought to\nobey. But, under the present circumstances, I am justified in doubting\nthe wisdom of an old man who, because he hated the father, vents his\nanger on the son. It would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct\nby such caprices. I shall still continue to preserve the same respect\ntoward M. Noirtier; I will suffer, without complaint, the pecuniary\ndeprivation to which he has subjected me; but I shall remain firm in\nmy determination, and the world shall see which party has reason on\nhis side. Consequently I shall marry my daughter to the Baron Franz\nd'Epinay, because I consider it would be a proper and eligible match\nfor her to make, and, in short, because I choose to bestow my daughter's\nhand on whomever I please.\"\n\n\"What?\" said the count, the approbation of whose eye Villefort had\nfrequently solicited during this speech. \"What? Do you say that M.\nNoirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort because she is going to\nmarry M. le Baron Franz d'Epinay?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, that is the reason,\" said Villefort, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\"The apparent reason, at least,\" said Madame de Villefort.\n\n\"The real reason, madame, I can assure you; I know my father.\"\n\n\"But I want to know in what way M. d'Epinay can have displeased your\nfather more than any other person?\"\n\n\"I believe I know M. Franz d'Epinay,\" said the count; \"is he not the son\nof General de Quesnel, who was created Baron d'Epinay by Charles X.?\"\n\n\"The same,\" said Villefort.\n\n\"Well, but he is a charming young man, according to my ideas.\"\n\n\"He is, which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of M. Noirtier\nto prevent his granddaughter marrying; old men are always so selfish in\ntheir affection,\" said Madame de Villefort.\n\n\"But,\" said Monte Cristo \"do you not know any cause for this hatred?\"\n\n\"Ah, ma foi, who is to know?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is some political difference?\"\n\n\"My father and the Baron d'Epinay lived in the stormy times of which I\nonly saw the ending,\" said Villefort.\n\n\"Was not your father a Bonapartist?\" asked Monte Cristo; \"I think I\nremember that you told me something of that kind.\"\n\n\"My father has been a Jacobin more than anything else,\" said Villefort,\ncarried by his emotion beyond the bounds of prudence; \"and the senator's\nrobe, which Napoleon cast on his shoulders, only served to disguise the\nold man without in any degree changing him. When my father conspired,\nit was not for the emperor, it was against the Bourbons; for M. Noirtier\npossessed this peculiarity, he never projected any Utopian schemes which\ncould never be realized, but strove for possibilities, and he applied\nto the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of The\nMountain,--theories that never shrank from any means that were deemed\nnecessary to bring about the desired result.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Monte Cristo, \"it is just as I thought; it was politics\nwhich brought Noirtier and M. d'Epinay into personal contact. Although\nGeneral d'Epinay served under Napoleon, did he not still retain royalist\nsentiments? And was he not the person who was assassinated one evening\non leaving a Bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the\nsupposition that he favored the cause of the emperor?\" Villefort looked\nat the count almost with terror. \"Am I mistaken, then?\" said Monte\nCristo.\n\n\"No, sir, the facts were precisely what you have stated,\" said Madame\nde Villefort; \"and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that M. de\nVillefort formed the idea of uniting in the bonds of affection the two\nchildren of these inveterate enemies.\"\n\n\"It was a sublime and charitable thought,\" said Monte Cristo, \"and the\nwhole world should applaud it. It would be noble to see Mademoiselle\nNoirtier de Villefort assuming the title of Madame Franz d'Epinay.\"\nVillefort shuddered and looked at Monte Cristo as if he wished to read\nin his countenance the real feelings which had dictated the words he\nhad just uttered. But the count completely baffled the procureur, and\nprevented him from discovering anything beneath the never-varying\nsmile he was so constantly in the habit of assuming. \"Although,\"\nsaid Villefort, \"it will be a serious thing for Valentine to lose\nher grandfather's fortune, I do not think that M. d'Epinay will be\nfrightened at this pecuniary loss. He will, perhaps, hold me in greater\nesteem than the money itself, seeing that I sacrifice everything in\norder to keep my word with him. Besides, he knows that Valentine is rich\nin right of her mother, and that she will, in all probability, inherit\nthe fortune of M. and Madame de Saint-Meran, her mother's parents, who\nboth love her tenderly.\"\n\n\"And who are fully as well worth loving and tending as M. Noirtier,\"\nsaid Madame de Villefort; \"besides, they are to come to Paris in about\na month, and Valentine, after the affront she has received, need not\nconsider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up\nwith M. Noirtier.\" The count listened with satisfaction to this tale\nof wounded self-love and defeated ambition. \"But it seems to me,\" said\nMonte Cristo, \"and I must begin by asking your pardon for what I am\nabout to say, that if M. Noirtier disinherits Mademoiselle de Villefort\nbecause she is going to marry a man whose father he detested, he cannot\nhave the same cause of complaint against this dear Edward.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Madame de Villefort, with an intonation of voice which it\nis impossible to describe; \"is it not unjust--shamefully unjust? Poor\nEdward is as much M. Noirtier's grandchild as Valentine, and yet, if she\nhad not been going to marry M. Franz, M. Noirtier would have left\nher all his money; and supposing Valentine to be disinherited by her\ngrandfather, she will still be three times richer than he.\" The count\nlistened and said no more. \"Count,\" said Villefort, \"we will not\nentertain you any longer with our family misfortunes. It is true that my\npatrimony will go to endow charitable institutions, and my father will\nhave deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any reason for doing\nso, but I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that I have acted like\na man of sense and feeling. M. d'Epinay, to whom I had promised the\ninterest of this sum, shall receive it, even if I endure the most cruel\nprivations.\"\n\n\"However,\" said Madame de Villefort, returning to the one idea which\nincessantly occupied her mind, \"perhaps it would be better to explain\nthis unlucky affair to M. d'Epinay, in order to give him the opportunity\nof himself renouncing his claim to the hand of Mademoiselle de\nVillefort.\"\n\n\"Ah, that would be a great pity,\" said Villefort.\n\n\"A great pity,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Villefort, moderating the tones of his voice, \"a\nmarriage once concerted and then broken off, throws a sort of discredit\non a young lady; then again, the old reports, which I was so anxious to\nput an end to, will instantly gain ground. No, it will all go well; M.\nd'Epinay, if he is an honorable man, will consider himself more than\never pledged to Mademoiselle de Villefort, unless he were actuated by a\ndecided feeling of avarice, but that is impossible.\"\n\n\"I agree with M. de Villefort,\" said Monte Cristo, fixing his eyes on\nMadame de Villefort; \"and if I were sufficiently intimate with him to\nallow of giving my advice, I would persuade him, since I have been told\nM. d'Epinay is coming back, to settle this affair at once beyond all\npossibility of revocation. I will answer for the success of a project\nwhich will reflect so much honor on M. de Villefort.\" The procureur\narose, delighted with the proposition, but his wife slightly changed\ncolor. \"Well, that is all that I wanted, and I will be guided by a\ncounsellor such as you are,\" said he, extending his hand to Monte\nCristo. \"Therefore let every one here look upon what has passed to-day\nas if it had not happened, and as though we had never thought of such a\nthing as a change in our original plans.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the count, \"the world, unjust as it is, will be pleased with\nyour resolution; your friends will be proud of you, and M. d'Epinay,\neven if he took Mademoiselle de Villefort without any dowry, which he\nwill not do, would be delighted with the idea of entering a family\nwhich could make such sacrifices in order to keep a promise and fulfil a\nduty.\" At the conclusion of these words, the count rose to depart. \"Are\nyou going to leave us, count?\" said Madame de Villefort.\n\n\"I am sorry to say I must do so, madame, I only came to remind you of\nyour promise for Saturday.\"\n\n\"Did you fear that we should forget it?\"\n\n\"You are very good, madame, but M. de Villefort has so many important\nand urgent occupations.\"\n\n\"My husband has given me his word, sir,\" said Madame de Villefort; \"you\nhave just seen him resolve to keep it when he has everything to lose,\nand surely there is more reason for his doing so where he has everything\nto gain.\"\n\n\"And,\" said Villefort, \"is it at your house in the Champs-Elysees that\nyou receive your visitors?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Monte Cristo, \"which is precisely the reason which renders\nyour kindness more meritorious,--it is in the country.\"\n\n\"In the country?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where is it, then? Near Paris, is it not?\"\n\n\"Very near, only half a league from the Barriers,--it is at Auteuil.\"\n\n\"At Auteuil?\" said Villefort; \"true, Madame de Villefort told me you\nlived at Auteuil, since it was to your house that she was taken. And in\nwhat part of Auteuil do you reside?\"\n\n\"Rue de la Fontaine.\"\n\n\"Rue de la Fontaine!\" exclaimed Villefort in an agitated tone; \"at what\nnumber?\"\n\n\"No. 28.\"\n\n\"Then,\" cried Villefort, \"was it you who bought M. de Saint-Meran's\nhouse!\"\n\n\"Did it belong to M. de Saint-Meran?\" demanded Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Madame de Villefort; \"and, would you believe it, count\"--\n\n\"Believe what?\"\n\n\"You think this house pretty, do you not?\"\n\n\"I think it charming.\"\n\n\"Well, my husband would never live in it.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" returned Monte Cristo, \"that is a prejudice on your part, M.\nde Villefort, for which I am quite at a loss to account.\"\n\n\"I do not like Auteuil, sir,\" said the procureur, making an evident\neffort to appear calm.\n\n\"But I hope you will not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of\nthe pleasure of your company, sir,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"No, count,--I hope--I assure you I shall do my best,\" stammered\nVillefort.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Monte Cristo, \"I allow of no excuse. On Saturday, at six\no'clock. I shall be expecting you, and if you fail to come, I shall\nthink--for how do I know to the contrary?--that this house, which his\nremained uninhabited for twenty years, must have some gloomy tradition\nor dreadful legend connected with it.\"\n\n\"I will come, count,--I will be sure to come,\" said Villefort eagerly.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Monte Cristo; \"now you must permit me to take my leave\nof you.\"\n\n\"You said before that you were obliged to leave us, monsieur,\" said\nMadame de Villefort, \"and you were about to tell us why when your\nattention was called to some other subject.\"\n\n\"Indeed madame,\" said Monte Cristo: \"I scarcely know if I dare tell you\nwhere I am going.\"\n\n\"Nonsense; say on.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it is to see a thing on which I have sometimes mused for\nhours together.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"A telegraph. So now I have told my secret.\"\n\n\"A telegraph?\" repeated Madame de Villefort.\n\n\"Yes, a telegraph. I had often seen one placed at the end of a road on\na hillock, and in the light of the sun its black arms, bending in every\ndirection, always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle, and I\nassure you it was never without emotion that I gazed on it, for I could\nnot help thinking how wonderful it was that these various signs should\nbe made to cleave the air with such precision as to convey to the\ndistance of three hundred leagues the ideas and wishes of a man sitting\nat a table at one end of the line to another man similarly placed at the\nopposite extremity, and all this effected by a simple act of volition\non the part of the sender of the message. I began to think of genii,\nsylphs, gnomes, in short, of all the ministers of the occult sciences,\nuntil I laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination. Now, it never\noccurred to me to wish for a nearer inspection of these large insects,\nwith their long black claws, for I always feared to find under their\nstone wings some little human genius fagged to death with cabals,\nfactions, and government intrigues. But one fine day I learned that the\nmover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch, hired for twelve hundred\nfrancs a year, and employed all day, not in studying the heavens like\nan astronomer, or in gazing on the water like an angler, or even in\nenjoying the privilege of observing the country around him, but all his\nmonotonous life was passed in watching his white-bellied, black-clawed\nfellow insect, four or five leagues distant from him. At length I felt\na desire to study this living chrysalis more closely, and to endeavor\nto understand the secret part played by these insect-actors when they\noccupy themselves simply with pulling different pieces of string.\"\n\n\"And are you going there?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"What telegraph do you intend visiting? that of the home department, or\nof the observatory?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; I should find there people who would force me to understand\nthings of which I would prefer to remain ignorant, and who would try\nto explain to me, in spite of myself, a mystery which even they do\nnot understand. Ma foi, I should wish to keep my illusions concerning\ninsects unimpaired; it is quite enough to have those dissipated which I\nhad formed of my fellow-creatures. I shall, therefore, not visit either\nof these telegraphs, but one in the open country where I shall find\na good-natured simpleton, who knows no more than the machine he is\nemployed to work.\"\n\n\"You are a singular man,\" said Villefort.\n\n\"What line would you advise me to study?\"\n\n\"The one that is most in use just at this time.\"\n\n\"The Spanish one, you mean, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes; should you like a letter to the minister that they might explain\nto you\"--\n\n\"No,\" said Monte Cristo; \"since, as I told you before, I do not wish to\ncomprehend it. The moment I understand it there will no longer exist a\ntelegraph for me; it will be nothing more than a sign from M. Duchatel,\nor from M. Montalivet, transmitted to the prefect of Bayonne, mystified\nby two Greek words, tele, graphein. It is the insect with black claws,\nand the awful word which I wish to retain in my imagination in all its\npurity and all its importance.\"\n\n\"Go then; for in the course of two hours it will be dark, and you will\nnot be able to see anything.\"\n\n\"Ma foi, you frighten me. Which is the nearest way? Bayonne?\"\n\n\"Yes; the road to Bayonne.\"\n\n\"And afterwards the road to Chatillon?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"By the tower of Montlhery, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Good-by. On Saturday I will tell you my impressions\nconcerning the telegraph.\" At the door the count was met by the two\nnotaries, who had just completed the act which was to disinherit\nValentine, and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a\nthing which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit.\n\n\n\nChapter 61. How a Gardener May Get Rid of the Dormice that Eat His Peaches.\n\nNot on the same night, as he had intended, but the next morning, the\nCount of Monte Cristo went out by the Barrier d'Enfer, taking the\nroad to Orleans. Leaving the village of Linas, without stopping at the\ntelegraph, which flourished its great bony arms as he passed, the count\nreached the tower of Montlhery, situated, as every one knows, upon the\nhighest point of the plain of that name. At the foot of the hill the\ncount dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path, about\neighteen inches wide; when he reached the summit he found himself\nstopped by a hedge, upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and\nwhite flowers.\n\nMonte Cristo looked for the entrance to the enclosure, and was not long\nin finding a little wooden gate, working on willow hinges, and fastened\nwith a nail and string. The count soon mastered the mechanism, the gate\nopened, and he then found himself in a little garden, about twenty feet\nlong by twelve wide, bounded on one side by part of the hedge, which\ncontained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate, and on the\nother by the old tower, covered with ivy and studded with wall-flowers.\nNo one would have thought in looking at this old, weather-beaten,\nfloral-decked tower (which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed\nup to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast) that it would have\nbeen capable of telling strange things, if,--in addition to the menacing\nears which the proverb says all walls are provided with,--it had also a\nvoice. The garden was crossed by a path of red gravel, edged by a border\nof thick box, of many years' growth, and of a tone and color that would\nhave delighted the heart of Delacroix, our modern Rubens. This path was\nformed in the shape of the figure of 8, thus, in its windings, making a\nwalk of sixty feet in a garden of only twenty.\n\nNever had Flora, the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners, been\nhonored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid\nto her in this little enclosure. In fact, of the twenty rose-trees which\nformed the parterre, not one bore the mark of the slug, nor were there\nevidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to\nplants growing in a damp soil. And yet it was not because the damp\nhad been excluded from the garden; the earth, black as soot, the\nthick foliage of the trees betrayed its presence; besides, had natural\nhumidity been wanting, it could have been immediately supplied by\nartificial means, thanks to a tank of water, sunk in one of the corners\nof the garden, and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad, who,\nfrom antipathy, no doubt, always remained on the two opposite sides of\nthe basin. There was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths, or\na weed in the flower-beds; no fine lady ever trained and watered her\ngeraniums, her cacti, and her rhododendrons, with more pains than this\nhitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure. Monte\nCristo stopped after having closed the gate and fastened the string to\nthe nail, and cast a look around.\n\n\"The man at the telegraph,\" said he, \"must either engage a gardener or\ndevote himself passionately to agriculture.\" Suddenly he struck against\nsomething crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves; the\nsomething rose, uttering an exclamation of astonishment, and Monte\nCristo found himself facing a man about fifty years old, who was\nplucking strawberries, which he was placing upon grape leaves. He had\ntwelve leaves and about as many strawberries, which, on rising suddenly,\nhe let fall from his hand. \"You are gathering your crop, sir?\" said\nMonte Cristo, smiling.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" replied the man, raising his hand to his cap; \"I am\nnot up there, I know, but I have only just come down.\"\n\n\"Do not let me interfere with you in anything, my friend,\" said the\ncount; \"gather your strawberries, if, indeed, there are any left.\"\n\n\"I have ten left,\" said the man, \"for here are eleven, and I had\ntwenty-one, five more than last year. But I am not surprised; the spring\nhas been warm this year, and strawberries require heat, sir. This is the\nreason that, instead of the sixteen I had last year, I have this year,\nyou see, eleven, already plucked--twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,\nsixteen, seventeen, eighteen. Ah, I miss three, they were here last\nnight, sir--I am sure they were here--I counted them. It must be the\nMere Simon's son who has stolen them; I saw him strolling about here\nthis morning. Ah, the young rascal--stealing in a garden--he does not\nknow where that may lead him to.\"\n\n\"Certainly, it is wrong,\" said Monte Cristo, \"but you should take into\nconsideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the gardener, \"but that does not make it the less\nunpleasant. But, sir, once more I beg pardon; perhaps you are an officer\nthat I am detaining here.\" And he glanced timidly at the count's blue\ncoat.\n\n\"Calm yourself, my friend,\" said the count, with the smile which he made\nat will either terrible or benevolent, and which now expressed only the\nkindliest feeling; \"I am not an inspector, but a traveller, brought\nhere by a curiosity he half repents of, since he causes you to lose your\ntime.\"\n\n\"Ah, my time is not valuable,\" replied the man with a melancholy smile.\n\"Still it belongs to government, and I ought not to waste it; but,\nhaving received the signal that I might rest for an hour\" (here he\nglanced at the sun-dial, for there was everything in the enclosure of\nMontlhery, even a sun-dial), \"and having ten minutes before me, and my\nstrawberries being ripe, when a day longer--by-the-by, sir, do you think\ndormice eat them?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I should think not,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"dormice are bad\nneighbors for us who do not eat them preserved, as the Romans did.\"\n\n\"What? Did the Romans eat them?\" said the gardener--\"ate dormice?\"\n\n\"I have read so in Petronius,\" said the count.\n\n\"Really? They can't be nice, though they do say 'as fat as a dormouse.'\nIt is not a wonder they are fat, sleeping all day, and only waking to\neat all night. Listen. Last year I had four apricots--they stole one, I\nhad one nectarine, only one--well, sir, they ate half of it on the wall;\na splendid nectarine--I never ate a better.\"\n\n\"You ate it?\"\n\n\"That is to say, the half that was left--you understand; it was\nexquisite, sir. Ah, those gentlemen never choose the worst morsels; like\nMere Simon's son, who has not chosen the worst strawberries. But this\nyear,\" continued the horticulturist, \"I'll take care it shall not\nhappen, even if I should be forced to sit by the whole night to watch\nwhen the strawberries are ripe.\" Monte Cristo had seen enough. Every man\nhas a devouring passion in his heart, as every fruit has its worm;\nthat of the telegraph man was horticulture. He began gathering the\ngrape-leaves which screened the sun from the grapes, and won the heart\nof the gardener. \"Did you come here, sir, to see the telegraph?\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Yes, if it isn't contrary to the rules.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said the gardener; \"not in the least, since there is no danger\nthat anyone can possibly understand what we are saying.\"\n\n\"I have been told,\" said the count, \"that you do not always yourselves\nunderstand the signals you repeat.\"\n\n\"That is true, sir, and that is what I like best,\" said the man,\nsmiling.\n\n\"Why do you like that best?\"\n\n\"Because then I have no responsibility. I am a machine then, and nothing\nelse, and so long as I work, nothing more is required of me.\"\n\n\"Is it possible,\" said Monte Cristo to himself, \"that I can have met\nwith a man that has no ambition? That would spoil my plans.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the gardener, glancing at the sun-dial, \"the ten minutes are\nalmost up; I must return to my post. Will you go up with me?\"\n\n\"I follow you.\" Monte Cristo entered the tower, which was divided into\nthree stories. The tower contained implements, such as spades, rakes,\nwatering-pots, hung against the wall; this was all the furniture. The\nsecond was the man's conventional abode, or rather sleeping-place; it\ncontained a few poor articles of household furniture--a bed, a table,\ntwo chairs, a stone pitcher--and some dry herbs, hung up to the ceiling,\nwhich the count recognized as sweet pease, and of which the good man was\npreserving the seeds; he had labelled them with as much care as if he\nhad been master botanist in the Jardin des Plantes.\n\n\"Does it require much study to learn the art of telegraphing?\" asked\nMonte Cristo.\n\n\"The study does not take long; it was acting as a supernumerary that was\nso tedious.\"\n\n\"And what is the pay?\"\n\n\"A thousand francs, sir.\"\n\n\"It is nothing.\"\n\n\"No; but then we are lodged, as you perceive.\"\n\nMonte Cristo looked at the room. They passed to the third story; it was\nthe telegraph room. Monte Cristo looked in turn at the two iron handles\nby which the machine was worked. \"It is very interesting,\" he said, \"but\nit must be very tedious for a lifetime.\"\n\n\"Yes. At first my neck was cramped with looking at it, but at the end\nof a year I became used to it; and then we have our hours of recreation,\nand our holidays.\"\n\n\"Holidays?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"When we have a fog.\"\n\n\"Ah, to be sure.\"\n\n\"Those are indeed holidays to me; I go into the garden, I plant, I\nprune, I trim, I kill the insects all day long.\"\n\n\"How long have you been here?\"\n\n\"Ten years, and five as a supernumerary make fifteen.\"\n\n\"You are--\"\n\n\"Fifty-five years old.\"\n\n\"How long must you have served to claim the pension?\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, twenty-five years.\"\n\n\"And how much is the pension?\"\n\n\"A hundred crowns.\"\n\n\"Poor humanity!\" murmured Monte Cristo.\n\n\"What did you say, sir?\" asked the man.\n\n\"I was saying it was very interesting.\"\n\n\"What was?\"\n\n\"All you were showing me. And you really understand none of these\nsignals?\"\n\n\"None at all.\"\n\n\"And have you never tried to understand them?\"\n\n\"Never. Why should I?\"\n\n\"But still there are some signals only addressed to you.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And do you understand them?\"\n\n\"They are always the same.\"\n\n\"And they mean--\"\n\n\"Nothing new; You have an hour; or To-morrow.\"\n\n\"This is simple enough,\" said the count; \"but look, is not your\ncorrespondent putting itself in motion?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"And what is it saying--anything you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes; it asks if I am ready.\"\n\n\"And you reply?\"\n\n\"By the same sign, which, at the same time, tells my right-hand\ncorrespondent that I am ready, while it gives notice to my left-hand\ncorrespondent to prepare in his turn.\"\n\n\"It is very ingenious,\" said the count.\n\n\"You will see,\" said the man proudly; \"in five minutes he will speak.\"\n\n\"I have, then, five minutes,\" said Monte Cristo to himself; \"it is\nmore time than I require. My dear sir, will you allow me to ask you a\nquestion?\"\n\n\"What is it, sir?\"\n\n\"You are fond of gardening?\"\n\n\"Passionately.\"\n\n\"And you would be pleased to have, instead of this terrace of twenty\nfeet, an enclosure of two acres?\"\n\n\"Sir, I should make a terrestrial paradise of it.\"\n\n\"You live badly on your thousand francs?\"\n\n\"Badly enough; but yet I do live.\"\n\n\"Yes; but you have a wretchedly small garden.\"\n\n\"True, the garden is not large.\"\n\n\"And, then, such as it is, it is filled with dormice, who eat\neverything.\"\n\n\"Ah, they are my scourges.\"\n\n\"Tell me, should you have the misfortune to turn your head while your\nright-hand correspondent was telegraphing\"--\n\n\"I should not see him.\"\n\n\"Then what would happen?\"\n\n\"I could not repeat the signals.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Not having repeated them, through negligence, I should be fined.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"A hundred francs.\"\n\n\"The tenth of your income--that would be fine work.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the man.\n\n\"Has it ever happened to you?\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Once, sir, when I was grafting a rose-tree.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose you were to alter a signal, and substitute another?\"\n\n\"Ah, that is another case; I should be turned off, and lose my pension.\"\n\n\"Three hundred francs?\"\n\n\"A hundred crowns, yes, sir; so you see that I am not likely to do any\nof these things.\"\n\n\"Not even for fifteen years' wages? Come, it is worth thinking about?\"\n\n\"For fifteen thousand francs?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Sir, you alarm me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"Sir, you are tempting me?\"\n\n\"Just so; fifteen thousand francs, do you understand?\"\n\n\"Sir, let me see my right-hand correspondent.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, do not look at him, but at this.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"What? Do you not know these bits of paper?\"\n\n\"Bank-notes!\"\n\n\"Exactly; there are fifteen of them.\"\n\n\"And whose are they?\"\n\n\"Yours, if you like.\"\n\n\"Mine?\" exclaimed the man, half-suffocated.\n\n\"Yes; yours--your own property.\"\n\n\"Sir, my right-hand correspondent is signalling.\"\n\n\"Let him signal.\"\n\n\"Sir, you have distracted me; I shall be fined.\"\n\n\"That will cost you a hundred francs; you see it is your interest to\ntake my bank-notes.\"\n\n\"Sir, my right-hand correspondent redoubles his signals; he is\nimpatient.\"\n\n\"Never mind--take these;\" and the count placed the packet in the man's\nhands. \"Now this is not all,\" he said; \"you cannot live upon your\nfifteen thousand francs.\"\n\n\"I shall still have my place.\"\n\n\"No, you will lose it, for you are going to alter your correspondent's\nmessage.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, what are you proposing?\"\n\n\"A jest.\"\n\n\"Sir, unless you force me\"--\n\n\"I think I can effectually force you;\" and Monte Cristo drew another\npacket from his pocket. \"Here are ten thousand more francs,\" he said,\n\"with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket, they will make\ntwenty-five thousand. With five thousand you can buy a pretty little\nhouse with two acres of land; the remaining twenty thousand will bring\nyou in a thousand francs a year.\"\n\n\"A garden with two acres of land!\"\n\n\"And a thousand francs a year.\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens!\"\n\n\"Come, take them,\" and Monte Cristo forced the bank-notes into his hand.\n\n\"What am I to do?\"\n\n\"Nothing very difficult.\"\n\n\"But what is it?\"\n\n\"To repeat these signs.\" Monte Cristo took a paper from his pocket,\nupon which were drawn three signs, with numbers to indicate the order in\nwhich they were to be worked.\n\n\"There, you see it will not take long.\"\n\n\"Yes; but\"--\n\n\"Do this, and you will have nectarines and all the rest.\" The shot\ntold; red with fever, while the large drops fell from his brow, the man\nexecuted, one after the other, the three signs given by the count, in\nspite of the frightful contortions of the right-hand correspondent, who,\nnot understanding the change, began to think the gardener had gone mad.\nAs to the left-hand one, he conscientiously repeated the same signals,\nwhich were finally transmitted to the Minister of the Interior. \"Now you\nare rich,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the man, \"but at what a price!\"\n\n\"Listen, friend,\" said Monte Cristo. \"I do not wish to cause you any\nremorse; believe me, then, when I swear to you that you have wronged no\nman, but on the contrary have benefited mankind.\" The man looked at the\nbank-notes, felt them, counted them, turned pale, then red, then rushed\ninto his room to drink a glass of water, but he had no time to reach\nthe water-jug, and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs. Five minutes\nafter the new telegram reached the minister, Debray had the horses put\nto his carriage, and drove to Danglars' house.\n\n\"Has your husband any Spanish bonds?\" he asked of the baroness.\n\n\"I think so, indeed! He has six millions' worth.\"\n\n\"He must sell them at whatever price.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because Don Carlos has fled from Bourges, and has returned to Spain.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" Debray shrugged his shoulders. \"The idea of\nasking how I hear the news,\" he said. The baroness did not wait for\na repetition; she ran to her husband, who immediately hastened to his\nagent, and ordered him to sell at any price. When it was seen that\nDanglars sold, the Spanish funds fell directly. Danglars lost five\nhundred thousand francs; but he rid himself of all his Spanish shares.\nThe same evening the following was read in Le Messager:\n\n\"[By telegraph.] The king, Don Carlos, has escaped the vigilance of\nhis guardians at Bourges, and has returned to Spain by the Catalonian\nfrontier. Barcelona has risen in his favor.\"\n\nAll that evening nothing was spoken of but the foresight of Danglars,\nwho had sold his shares, and of the luck of the stock-jobber, who only\nlost five hundred thousand francs by such a blow. Those who had kept\ntheir shares, or bought those of Danglars, looked upon themselves as\nruined, and passed a very bad night. Next morning Le Moniteur contained\nthe following:\n\n\"It was without any foundation that Le Messager yesterday announced the\nflight of Don Carlos and the revolt of Barcelona. The king (Don Carlos)\nhas not left Bourges, and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of profound\npeace. A telegraphic signal, improperly interpreted, owing to the fog,\nwas the cause of this error.\"\n\nThe funds rose one per cent higher than before they had fallen. This,\nreckoning his loss, and what he had missed gaining, made the difference\nof a million to Danglars. \"Good,\" said Monte Cristo to Morrel, who was\nat his house when the news arrived of the strange reverse of fortune of\nwhich Danglars had been the victim, \"I have just made a discovery for\ntwenty-five thousand francs, for which I would have paid a hundred\nthousand.\"\n\n\"What have you discovered?\" asked Morrel.\n\n\"I have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that\neat his peaches.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 62. Ghosts.\n\nAt first sight, the exterior of the house at Auteuil gave no indications\nof splendor, nothing one would expect from the destined residence of the\nmagnificent Count of Monte Cristo; but this simplicity was according\nto the will of its master, who positively ordered nothing to be altered\noutside. The splendor was within. Indeed, almost before the door\nopened, the scene changed. M. Bertuccio had outdone himself in the taste\ndisplayed in furnishing, and in the rapidity with which it was executed.\nIt is told that the Duc d'Antin removed in a single night a whole avenue\nof trees that annoyed Louis XIV.; in three days M. Bertuccio planted an\nentirely bare court with poplars, large spreading sycamores to shade\nthe different parts of the house, and in the foreground, instead of the\nusual paving-stones, half hidden by the grass, there extended a lawn but\nthat morning laid down, and upon which the water was yet glistening. For\nthe rest, the orders had been issued by the count; he himself had given\na plan to Bertuccio, marking the spot where each tree was to be planted,\nand the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the place of the\npaving-stones. Thus the house had become unrecognizable, and Bertuccio\nhimself declared that he scarcely knew it, encircled as it was by a\nframework of trees. The overseer would not have objected, while he was\nabout it, to have made some improvements in the garden, but the count\nhad positively forbidden it to be touched. Bertuccio made amends,\nhowever, by loading the ante-chambers, staircases, and mantle-pieces\nwith flowers.\n\nWhat, above all, manifested the shrewdness of the steward, and the\nprofound science of the master, the one in carrying out the ideas of the\nother, was that this house which appeared only the night before so sad\nand gloomy, impregnated with that sickly smell one can almost fancy to\nbe the smell of time, had in a single day acquired the aspect of life,\nwas scented with its master's favorite perfumes, and had the very light\nregulated according to his wish. When the count arrived, he had\nunder his touch his books and arms, his eyes rested upon his favorite\npictures; his dogs, whose caresses he loved, welcomed him in the\nante-chamber; the birds, whose songs delighted him, cheered him with\ntheir music; and the house, awakened from its long sleep, like the\nsleeping beauty in the wood, lived, sang, and bloomed like the houses we\nhave long cherished, and in which, when we are forced to leave them,\nwe leave a part of our souls. The servants passed gayly along the fine\ncourt-yard; some, belonging to the kitchens, gliding down the stairs,\nrestored but the previous day, as if they had always inhabited the\nhouse; others filling the coach-houses, where the equipages, encased and\nnumbered, appeared to have been installed for the last fifty years; and\nin the stables the horses replied with neighs to the grooms, who spoke\nto them with much more respect than many servants pay their masters.\n\nThe library was divided into two parts on either side of the wall, and\ncontained upwards of two thousand volumes; one division was entirely\ndevoted to novels, and even the volume which had been published but the\nday before was to be seen in its place in all the dignity of its red and\ngold binding. On the other side of the house, to match with the library,\nwas the conservatory, ornamented with rare flowers, that bloomed in\nchina jars; and in the midst of the greenhouse, marvellous alike to\nsight and smell, was a billiard-table which looked as if it had been\nabandoned during the past hour by players who had left the balls on\nthe cloth. One chamber alone had been respected by the magnificent\nBertuccio. Before this room, to which you could ascend by the grand, and\ngo out by the back staircase, the servants passed with curiosity, and\nBertuccio with terror. At five o'clock precisely, the count arrived\nbefore the house at Auteuil, followed by Ali. Bertuccio was awaiting\nthis arrival with impatience, mingled with uneasiness; he hoped for some\ncompliments, while, at the same time, he feared to have frowns. Monte\nCristo descended into the courtyard, walked all over the house, without\ngiving any sign of approbation or pleasure, until he entered his\nbedroom, situated on the opposite side to the closed room; then he\napproached a little piece of furniture, made of rosewood, which he had\nnoticed at a previous visit. \"That can only be to hold gloves,\" he said.\n\n\"Will your excellency deign to open it?\" said the delighted Bertuccio,\n\"and you will find gloves in it.\" Elsewhere the count found everything\nhe required--smelling-bottles, cigars, knick-knacks.\n\n\"Good,\" he said; and M. Bertuccio left enraptured, so great, so\npowerful, and real was the influence exercised by this man over all who\nsurrounded him. At precisely six o'clock the clatter of horses' hoofs\nwas heard at the entrance door; it was our captain of Spahis, who had\narrived on Medeah. \"I am sure I am the first,\" cried Morrel; \"I did it\non purpose to have you a minute to myself, before every one came. Julie\nand Emmanuel have a thousand things to tell you. Ah, really this is\nmagnificent! But tell me, count, will your people take care of my\nhorse?\"\n\n\"Do not alarm yourself, my dear Maximilian--they understand.\"\n\n\"I mean, because he wants petting. If you had seen at what a pace he\ncame--like the wind!\"\n\n\"I should think so,--a horse that cost 5,000 francs!\" said Monte Cristo,\nin the tone which a father would use towards a son.\n\n\"Do you regret them?\" asked Morrel, with his open laugh.\n\n\"I? Certainly not,\" replied the count. \"No; I should only regret if the\nhorse had not proved good.\"\n\n\"It is so good, that I have distanced M. de Chateau-Renaud, one of the\nbest riders in France, and M. Debray, who both mount the minister's\nArabians; and close on their heels are the horses of Madame Danglars,\nwho always go at six leagues an hour.\"\n\n\"Then they follow you?\" asked Monte Cristo.\n\n\"See, they are here.\" And at the same minute a carriage with smoking\nhorses, accompanied by two mounted gentlemen, arrived at the gate, which\nopened before them. The carriage drove round, and stopped at the steps,\nfollowed by the horsemen. The instant Debray had touched the ground,\nhe was at the carriage-door. He offered his hand to the baroness, who,\ndescending, took it with a peculiarity of manner imperceptible to every\none but Monte Cristo. But nothing escaped the count's notice, and he\nobserved a little note, passed with the facility that indicates frequent\npractice, from the hand of Madame Danglars to that of the minister's\nsecretary. After his wife the banker descended, as pale as though he had\nissued from his tomb instead of his carriage. Madame Danglars threw\na rapid and inquiring glance which could only be interpreted by Monte\nCristo, around the court-yard, over the peristyle, and across the front\nof the house, then, repressing a slight emotion, which must have been\nseen on her countenance if she had not kept her color, she ascended the\nsteps, saying to Morrel, \"Sir, if you were a friend of mine, I should\nask you if you would sell your horse.\"\n\nMorrel smiled with an expression very like a grimace, and then turned\nround to Monte Cristo, as if to ask him to extricate him from his\nembarrassment. The count understood him. \"Ah, madame,\" he said, \"why did\nyou not make that request of me?\"\n\n\"With you, sir,\" replied the baroness, \"one can wish for nothing, one is\nso sure to obtain it. If it were so with M. Morrel\"--\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" replied the count, \"I am witness that M. Morrel cannot\ngive up his horse, his honor being engaged in keeping it.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"He laid a wager he would tame Medeah in the space of six months. You\nunderstand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the\ntime named, he would not only lose his bet, but people would say he was\nafraid; and a brave captain of Spahis cannot risk this, even to\ngratify a pretty woman, which is, in my opinion, one of the most sacred\nobligations in the world.\"\n\n\"You see my position, madame,\" said Morrel, bestowing a grateful smile\non Monte Cristo.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Danglars, in his coarse tone, ill-concealed by a\nforced smile, \"that you have already got horses enough.\" Madame Danglars\nseldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed, but, to the\nsurprise of the young people, she pretended not to hear it, and said\nnothing. Monte Cristo smiled at her unusual humility, and showed her two\nimmense porcelain jars, over which wound marine plants, of a size and\ndelicacy that nature alone could produce. The baroness was astonished.\n\"Why,\" said she, \"you could plant one of the chestnut-trees in the\nTuileries inside! How can such enormous jars have been manufactured?\"\n\n\"Ah, madame,\" replied Monte Cristo, \"you must not ask of us, the\nmanufacturers of fine porcelain, such a question. It is the work of\nanother age, constructed by the genii of earth and water.\"\n\n\"How so?--at what period can that have been?\"\n\n\"I do not know; I have only heard that an emperor of China had an\noven built expressly, and that in this oven twelve jars like this were\nsuccessively baked. Two broke, from the heat of the fire; the other ten\nwere sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the sea. The sea, knowing\nwhat was required of her, threw over them her weeds, encircled them with\ncoral, and encrusted them with shells; the whole was cemented by two\nhundred years beneath these almost impervious depths, for a revolution\ncarried away the emperor who wished to make the trial, and only left the\ndocuments proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the\nsea. At the end of two hundred years the documents were found, and they\nthought of bringing up the jars. Divers descended in machines, made\nexpressly on the discovery, into the bay where they were thrown; but of\nten three only remained, the rest having been broken by the waves. I am\nfond of these jars, upon which, perhaps, misshapen, frightful monsters\nhave fixed their cold, dull eyes, and in which myriads of small fish\nhave slept, seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their enemies.\"\nMeanwhile, Danglars, who had cared little for curiosities, was\nmechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange-tree, one\nafter another. When he had finished with the orange-tree, he began at\nthe cactus; but this, not being so easily plucked as the orange-tree,\npricked him dreadfully. He shuddered, and rubbed his eyes as though\nawaking from a dream.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Monte Cristo to him, \"I do not recommend my pictures to you,\nwho possess such splendid paintings; but, nevertheless, here are two\nby Hobbema, a Paul Potter, a Mieris, two by Gerard Douw, a Raphael, a\nVandyke, a Zurbaran, and two or three by Murillo, worth looking at.\"\n\n\"Stay,\" said Debray; \"I recognize this Hobbema.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed!\"\n\n\"Yes; it was proposed for the Museum.\"\n\n\"Which, I believe, does not contain one?\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"No; and yet they refused to buy it.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Chateau-Renaud.\n\n\"You pretend not to know,--because government was not rich enough.\"\n\n\"Ah, pardon me,\" said Chateau-Renaud; \"I have heard of these things\nevery day during the last eight years, and I cannot understand them\nyet.\"\n\n\"You will, by and by,\" said Debray.\n\n\"I think not,\" replied Chateau-Renaud.\n\n\"Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and Count Andrea Cavalcanti,\" announced\nBaptistin. A black satin stock, fresh from the maker's hands, gray\nmoustaches, a bold eye, a major's uniform, ornamented with three medals\nand five crosses--in fact, the thorough bearing of an old soldier--such\nwas the appearance of Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, that tender father\nwith whom we are already acquainted. Close to him, dressed in entirely\nnew clothes, advanced smilingly Count Andrea Cavalcanti, the dutiful\nson, whom we also know. The three young people were talking together. On\nthe entrance of the new-comers, their eyes glanced from father to\nson, and then, naturally enough, rested on the latter, whom they began\ncriticising. \"Cavalcanti!\" said Debray. \"A fine name,\" said Morrel.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"these Italians are well named and badly\ndressed.\"\n\n\"You are fastidious, Chateau-Renaud,\" replied Debray; \"those clothes are\nwell cut and quite new.\"\n\n\"That is just what I find fault with. That gentleman appears to be well\ndressed for the first time in his life.\"\n\n\"Who are those gentlemen?\" asked Danglars of Monte Cristo.\n\n\"You heard--Cavalcanti.\"\n\n\"That tells me their name, and nothing else.\"\n\n\"Ah, true. You do not know the Italian nobility; the Cavalcanti are all\ndescended from princes.\"\n\n\"Have they any fortune?\"\n\n\"An enormous one.\"\n\n\"What do they do?\"\n\n\"Try to spend it all. They have some business with you, I think, from\nwhat they told me the day before yesterday. I, indeed, invited them here\nto-day on your account. I will introduce you to them.\"\n\n\"But they appear to speak French with a very pure accent,\" said\nDanglars.\n\n\"The son has been educated in a college in the south; I believe near\nMarseilles. You will find him quite enthusiastic.\"\n\n\"Upon what subject?\" asked Madame Danglars.\n\n\"The French ladies, madame. He has made up his mind to take a wife from\nParis.\"\n\n\"A fine idea that of his,\" said Danglars, shrugging his shoulders.\nMadame Danglars looked at her husband with an expression which, at any\nother time, would have indicated a storm, but for the second time she\ncontrolled herself. \"The baron appears thoughtful to-day,\" said Monte\nCristo to her; \"are they going to put him in the ministry?\"\n\n\"Not yet, I think. More likely he has been speculating on the Bourse,\nand has lost money.\"\n\n\"M. and Madame de Villefort,\" cried Baptistin. They entered. M. de\nVillefort, notwithstanding his self-control, was visibly affected, and\nwhen Monte Cristo touched his hand, he felt it tremble. \"Certainly,\nwomen alone know how to dissimulate,\" said Monte Cristo to himself,\nglancing at Madame Danglars, who was smiling on the procureur, and\nembracing his wife. After a short time, the count saw Bertuccio, who,\nuntil then, had been occupied on the other side of the house, glide into\nan adjoining room. He went to him. \"What do you want, M. Bertuccio?\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"Your excellency has not stated the number of guests.\"\n\n\"Ah, true.\"\n\n\"How many covers?\"\n\n\"Count for yourself.\"\n\n\"Is every one here, your excellency?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nBertuccio glanced through the door, which was ajar. The count watched\nhim. \"Good heavens!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" said the count.\n\n\"That woman--that woman!\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"The one with a white dress and so many diamonds--the fair one.\"\n\n\"Madame Danglars?\"\n\n\"I do not know her name; but it is she, sir, it is she!\"\n\n\"Whom do you mean?\"\n\n\"The woman of the garden!--she that was enciente--she who was walking\nwhile she waited for\"--Bertuccio stood at the open door, with his eyes\nstarting and his hair on end.\n\n\"Waiting for whom?\" Bertuccio, without answering, pointed to Villefort\nwith something of the gesture Macbeth uses to point out Banquo. \"Oh,\noh,\" he at length muttered, \"do you see?\"\n\n\"What? Who?\"\n\n\"Him!\"\n\n\"Him!--M. de Villefort, the king's attorney? Certainly I see him.\"\n\n\"Then I did not kill him?\"\n\n\"Really, I think you are going mad, good Bertuccio,\" said the count.\n\n\"Then he is not dead?\"\n\n\"No; you see plainly he is not dead. Instead of striking between the\nsixth and seventh left ribs, as your countrymen do, you must have struck\nhigher or lower, and life is very tenacious in these lawyers, or rather\nthere is no truth in anything you have told me--it was a fright of the\nimagination, a dream of your fancy. You went to sleep full of thoughts\nof vengeance; they weighed heavily upon your stomach; you had the\nnightmare--that's all. Come, calm yourself, and reckon them up--M.\nand Madame de Villefort, two; M. and Madame Danglars, four; M.\nde Chateau-Renaud, M. Debray, M. Morrel, seven; Major Bartolomeo\nCavalcanti, eight.\"\n\n\"Eight!\" repeated Bertuccio.\n\n\"Stop! You are in a shocking hurry to be off--you forget one of my\nguests. Lean a little to the left. Stay! look at M. Andrea Cavalcanti,\nthe young man in a black coat, looking at Murillo's Madonna; now he is\nturning.\" This time Bertuccio would have uttered an exclamation, had\nnot a look from Monte Cristo silenced him. \"Benedetto?\" he muttered;\n\"fatality!\"\n\n\"Half-past six o'clock has just struck, M. Bertuccio,\" said the count\nseverely; \"I ordered dinner at that hour, and I do not like to wait;\"\nand he returned to his guests, while Bertuccio, leaning against the\nwall, succeeded in reaching the dining-room. Five minutes afterwards\nthe doors of the drawing-room were thrown open, and Bertuccio appearing\nsaid, with a violent effort, \"The dinner waits.\"\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo offered his arm to Madame de Villefort. \"M. de\nVillefort,\" he said, \"will you conduct the Baroness Danglars?\"\n\nVillefort complied, and they passed on to the dining-room.\n\n\n\nChapter 63. The Dinner.\n\nIt was evident that one sentiment affected all the guests on entering\nthe dining-room. Each one asked what strange influence had brought them\nto this house, and yet astonished, even uneasy though they were, they\nstill felt that they would not like to be absent. The recent events, the\nsolitary and eccentric position of the count, his enormous, nay, almost\nincredible fortune, should have made men cautious, and have altogether\nprevented ladies visiting a house where there was no one of their own\nsex to receive them; and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them\nto overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum. And all present, even\nincluding Cavalcanti and his son, notwithstanding the stiffness of\nthe one and the carelessness of the other, were thoughtful, on finding\nthemselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man. Madame\nDanglars had started when Villefort, on the count's invitation, offered\nhis arm; and Villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold\nspectacles, when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own.\nNone of this had escaped the count, and even by this mere contact of\nindividuals the scene had already acquired considerable interest for an\nobserver. M. de Villefort had on the right hand Madame Danglars, on\nhis left Morrel. The count was seated between Madame de Villefort and\nDanglars; the other seats were filled by Debray, who was placed between\nthe two Cavalcanti, and by Chateau-Renaud, seated between Madame de\nVillefort and Morrel.\n\nThe repast was magnificent; Monte Cristo had endeavored completely to\noverturn the Parisian ideas, and to feed the curiosity as much as the\nappetite of his guests. It was an Oriental feast that he offered to\nthem, but of such a kind as the Arabian fairies might be supposed to\nprepare. Every delicious fruit that the four quarters of the globe could\nprovide was heaped in vases from China and jars from Japan. Rare birds,\nretaining their most brilliant plumage, enormous fish, spread upon\nmassive silver dishes, together with every wine produced in the\nArchipelago, Asia Minor, or the Cape, sparkling in bottles, whose\ngrotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught,--all\nthese, like one of the displays with which Apicius of old gratified his\nguests, passed in review before the eyes of the astonished Parisians,\nwho understood that it was possible to expend a thousand louis upon a\ndinner for ten persons, but only on the condition of eating pearls, like\nCleopatra, or drinking refined gold, like Lorenzo de' Medici.\n\nMonte Cristo noticed the general astonishment, and began laughing\nand joking about it. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"you will admit that, when\narrived at a certain degree of fortune, the superfluities of life are\nall that can be desired; and the ladies will allow that, after having\nrisen to a certain eminence of position, the ideal alone can be\nmore exalted. Now, to follow out this reasoning, what is the\nmarvellous?--that which we do not understand. What is it that we really\ndesire?--that which we cannot obtain. Now, to see things which I cannot\nunderstand, to procure impossibilities, these are the study of my life.\nI gratify my wishes by two means--my will and my money. I take as\nmuch interest in the pursuit of some whim as you do, M. Danglars, in\npromoting a new railway line; you, M. de Villefort, in condemning a\nculprit to death; you, M. Debray, in pacifying a kingdom; you, M. de\nChateau-Renaud, in pleasing a woman; and you, Morrel, in breaking a\nhorse that no one can ride. For example, you see these two fish; one\nbrought from fifty leagues beyond St. Petersburg, the other five leagues\nfrom Naples. Is it not amusing to see them both on the same table?\"\n\n\"What are the two fish?\" asked Danglars.\n\n\"M. Chateau-Renaud, who has lived in Russia, will tell you the name of\none, and Major Cavalcanti, who is an Italian, will tell you the name of\nthe other.\"\n\n\"This one is, I think, a sterlet,\" said Chateau-Renaud.\n\n\"And that one, if I mistake not, a lamprey.\"\n\n\"Just so. Now, M. Danglars, ask these gentlemen where they are caught.\"\n\n\"Sterlets,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"are only found in the Volga.\"\n\n\"And,\" said Cavalcanti, \"I know that Lake Fusaro alone supplies lampreys\nof that size.\"\n\n\"Exactly; one comes from the Volga, and the other from Lake Fusaro.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried all the guests simultaneously.\n\n\"Well, this is just what amuses me,\" said Monte Cristo. \"I am like\nNero--cupitor impossibilium; and that is what is amusing you at this\nmoment. This fish, which seems so exquisite to you, is very likely no\nbetter than perch or salmon; but it seemed impossible to procure it, and\nhere it is.\"\n\n\"But how could you have these fish brought to France?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing more easy. Each fish was brought over in a cask--one filled\nwith river herbs and weeds, the other with rushes and lake plants; they\nwere placed in a wagon built on purpose, and thus the sterlet lived\ntwelve days, the lamprey eight, and both were alive when my cook seized\nthem, killing one with milk and the other with wine. You do not believe\nme, M. Danglars!\"\n\n\"I cannot help doubting,\" answered Danglars with his stupid smile.\n\n\"Baptistin,\" said the count, \"have the other fish brought in--the\nsterlet and the lamprey which came in the other casks, and which are yet\nalive.\" Danglars opened his bewildered eyes; the company clapped their\nhands. Four servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants,\nand in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the table.\n\n\"But why have two of each sort?\" asked Danglars.\n\n\"Merely because one might have died,\" carelessly answered Monte Cristo.\n\n\"You are certainly an extraordinary man,\" said Danglars; \"and\nphilosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich.\"\n\n\"And to have ideas,\" added Madame Danglars.\n\n\"Oh, do not give me credit for this, madame; it was done by the Romans,\nwho much esteemed them, and Pliny relates that they sent slaves from\nOstia to Rome, who carried on their heads fish which he calls the mulus,\nand which, from the description, must probably be the goldfish. It was\nalso considered a luxury to have them alive, it being an amusing sight\nto see them die, for, when dying, they change color three or four times,\nand like the rainbow when it disappears, pass through all the prismatic\nshades, after which they were sent to the kitchen. Their agony formed\npart of their merit--if they were not seen alive, they were despised\nwhen dead.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Debray, \"but then Ostia is only a few leagues from Rome.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Monte Cristo; \"but what would be the use of living eighteen\nhundred years after Lucullus, if we can do no better than he could?\" The\ntwo Cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes, but had the good sense not\nto say anything. \"All this is very extraordinary,\" said Chateau-Renaud;\n\"still, what I admire the most, I confess, is the marvellous promptitude\nwith which your orders are executed. Is it not true that you only bought\nthis house five or six days ago?\"\n\n\"Certainly not longer.\"\n\n\"Well, I am sure it is quite transformed since last week. If I remember\nrightly, it had another entrance, and the court-yard was paved and\nempty; while to-day we have a splendid lawn, bordered by trees which\nappear to be a hundred years old.\"\n\n\"Why not? I am fond of grass and shade,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Madame de Villefort, \"the door was towards the road before,\nand on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me into the house\nfrom the road, I remember.\"\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" said Monte Cristo; \"but I preferred having an entrance\nwhich would allow me to see the Bois de Boulogne over my gate.\"\n\n\"In four days,\" said Morrel; \"it is extraordinary!\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"it seems quite miraculous to make a new\nhouse out of an old one; for it was very old, and dull too. I recollect\ncoming for my mother to look at it when M. de Saint-Meran advertised it\nfor sale two or three years ago.\"\n\n\"M. de Saint-Meran?\" said Madame de Villefort; \"then this house belonged\nto M. de Saint-Meran before you bought it?\"\n\n\"It appears so,\" replied Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it?\"\n\n\"Quite so; my steward transacts all this business for me.\"\n\n\"It is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied,\" said\nChateau-Renaud, \"and it was quite melancholy to look at it, with the\nblinds closed, the doors locked, and the weeds in the court. Really, if\nthe house had not belonged to the father-in-law of the procureur, one\nmight have thought it some accursed place where a horrible crime had\nbeen committed.\" Villefort, who had hitherto not tasted the three or\nfour glasses of rare wine which were placed before him, here took one,\nand drank it off. Monte Cristo allowed a short time to elapse, and then\nsaid, \"It is singular, baron, but the same idea came across me the first\ntime I came here; it looked so gloomy I should never have bought it\nif my steward had not taken the matter into his own hands. Perhaps the\nfellow had been bribed by the notary.\"\n\n\"It is probable,\" stammered out Villefort, trying to smile; \"but I can\nassure you that I had nothing to do with any such proceeding. This house\nis part of Valentine's marriage-portion, and M. de Saint-Meran wished to\nsell it; for if it had remained another year or two uninhabited it would\nhave fallen to ruin.\" It was Morrel's turn to become pale.\n\n\"There was, above all, one room,\" continued Monte Cristo, \"very plain in\nappearance, hung with red damask, which, I know not why, appeared to me\nquite dramatic.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" said Danglars; \"why dramatic?\"\n\n\"Can we account for instinct?\" said Monte Cristo. \"Are there not some\nplaces where we seem to breathe sadness?--why, we cannot tell. It is a\nchain of recollections--an idea which carries you back to other times,\nto other places--which, very likely, have no connection with the present\ntime and place. And there is something in this room which reminds me\nforcibly of the chamber of the Marquise de Ganges [*] or Desdemona. Stay,\nsince we have finished dinner, I will show it to you, and then we will\ntake coffee in the garden. After dinner, the play.\" Monte Cristo looked\ninquiringly at his guests. Madame de Villefort rose, Monte Cristo did\nthe same, and the rest followed their example. Villefort and Madame\nDanglars remained for a moment, as if rooted to their seats; they\nquestioned each other with vague and stupid glances. \"Did you hear?\"\nsaid Madame Danglars.\n\n     * Elisabeth de Rossan, Marquise de Ganges, was one of the\n     famous women of the court of Louis XIV. where she was known\n     as \"La Belle Provencale.\" She was the widow of the Marquise\n     de Castellane when she married de Ganges, and having the\n     misfortune to excite the enmity of her new brothers-in-law,\n     was forced by them to take poison; and they finished her off\n     with pistol and dagger.--Ed.\n\n\"We must go,\" replied Villefort, offering his arm. The others, attracted\nby curiosity, were already scattered in different parts of the house;\nfor they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room, and\nthat, at the same time, they would obtain a view of the rest of the\nbuilding, of which Monte Cristo had created a palace. Each one went out\nby the open doors. Monte Cristo waited for the two who remained; then,\nwhen they had passed, he brought up the rear, and on his face was a\nsmile, which, if they could have understood it, would have alarmed them\nmuch more than a visit to the room they were about to enter. They began\nby walking through the apartments, many of which were fitted up in\nthe Eastern style, with cushions and divans instead of beds, and pipes\ninstead of furniture. The drawing-rooms were decorated with the rarest\npictures by the old masters, the boudoirs hung with draperies from\nChina, of fanciful colors, fantastic design, and wonderful texture. At\nlength they arrived at the famous room. There was nothing particular\nabout it, excepting that, although daylight had disappeared, it was not\nlighted, and everything in it was old-fashioned, while the rest of the\nrooms had been redecorated. These two causes were enough to give it\na gloomy aspect. \"Oh.\" cried Madame de Villefort, \"it is really\nfrightful.\" Madame Danglars tried to utter a few words, but was not\nheard. Many observations were made, the import of which was a unanimous\nopinion that there was something sinister about the room. \"Is it not\nso?\" asked Monte Cristo. \"Look at that large clumsy bed, hung with such\ngloomy, blood-colored drapery! And those two crayon portraits, that have\nfaded from the dampness; do they not seem to say, with their pale\nlips and staring eyes, 'We have seen'?\" Villefort became livid; Madame\nDanglars fell into a long seat placed near the chimney. \"Oh,\" said\nMadame de Villefort, smiling, \"are you courageous enough to sit down\nupon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was committed?\" Madame\nDanglars rose suddenly.\n\n\"And then,\" said Monte Cristo, \"this is not all.\"\n\n\"What is there more?\" said Debray, who had not failed to notice the\nagitation of Madame Danglars.\n\n\"Ah, what else is there?\" said Danglars; \"for, at present, I cannot\nsay that I have seen anything extraordinary. What do you say, M.\nCavalcanti?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"we have at Pisa, Ugolino's tower; at Ferrara, Tasso's\nprison; at Rimini, the room of Francesca and Paolo.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you have not this little staircase,\" said Monte Cristo,\nopening a door concealed by the drapery. \"Look at it, and tell me what\nyou think of it.\"\n\n\"What a wicked-looking, crooked staircase,\" said Chateau-Renaud with a\nsmile.\n\n\"I do not know whether the wine of Chios produces melancholy, but\ncertainly everything appears to me black in this house,\" said Debray.\n\nEver since Valentine's dowry had been mentioned, Morrel had been silent\nand sad. \"Can you imagine,\" said Monte Cristo, \"some Othello or Abbe de\nGanges, one stormy, dark night, descending these stairs step by step,\ncarrying a load, which he wishes to hide from the sight of man, if not\nfrom God?\" Madame Danglars half fainted on the arm of Villefort, who was\nobliged to support himself against the wall. \"Ah, madame,\" cried Debray,\n\"what is the matter with you? how pale you look!\"\n\n\"It is very evident what is the matter with her,\" said Madame de\nVillefort; \"M. de Monte Cristo is relating horrible stories to us,\ndoubtless intending to frighten us to death.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Villefort, \"really, count, you frighten the ladies.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Debray, in a whisper, of Madame Danglars.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she replied with a violent effort. \"I want air, that is all.\"\n\n\"Will you come into the garden?\" said Debray, advancing towards the back\nstaircase.\n\n\"No, no,\" she answered, \"I would rather remain here.\"\n\n\"Are you really frightened, madame?\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Oh, no, sir,\" said Madame Danglars; \"but you suppose scenes in a manner\nwhich gives them the appearance of reality.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Monte Cristo smiling; \"it is all a matter of\nimagination. Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an honest\nmother? And this bed with red hangings, a bed visited by the goddess\nLucina? And that mysterious staircase, the passage through which, not\nto disturb their sleep, the doctor and nurse pass, or even the father\ncarrying the sleeping child?\" Here Madame Danglars, instead of being\ncalmed by the soft picture, uttered a groan and fainted. \"Madame\nDanglars is ill,\" said Villefort; \"it would be better to take her to her\ncarriage.\"\n\n\"Oh, mon Dieu,\" said Monte Cristo, \"and I have forgotten my\nsmelling-bottle!\"\n\n\"I have mine,\" said Madame de Villefort; and she passed over to\nMonte Cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good\nproperties the count had tested on Edward.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Monte Cristo, taking it from her hand.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"at your advice I have made the trial.\"\n\n\"And have you succeeded?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\nMadame Danglars was carried into the adjoining room; Monte Cristo\ndropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips; she\nreturned to consciousness. \"Ah,\" she cried, \"what a frightful dream!\"\n\nVillefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream. They\nlooked for M. Danglars, but, as he was not especially interested in\npoetical ideas, he had gone into the garden, and was talking with Major\nCavalcanti on the projected railway from Leghorn to Florence. Monte\nCristo seemed in despair. He took the arm of Madame Danglars, and\nconducted her into the garden, where they found Danglars taking coffee\nbetween the Cavalcanti. \"Really, madame,\" he said, \"did I alarm you\nmuch?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, sir,\" she answered; \"but you know, things impress us\ndifferently, according to the mood of our minds.\" Villefort forced\na laugh. \"And then, you know,\" he said, \"an idea, a supposition, is\nsufficient.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Monte Cristo, \"you may believe me if you like, but it is my\nopinion that a crime has been committed in this house.\"\n\n\"Take care,\" said Madame de Villefort, \"the king's attorney is here.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" replied Monte Cristo, \"since that is the case, I will take\nadvantage of his presence to make my declaration.\"\n\n\"Your declaration?\" said Villefort.\n\n\"Yes, before witnesses.\"\n\n\"Oh, this is very interesting,\" said Debray; \"if there really has been a\ncrime, we will investigate it.\"\n\n\"There has been a crime,\" said Monte Cristo. \"Come this way, gentlemen;\ncome, M. Villefort, for a declaration to be available, should be made\nbefore the competent authorities.\" He then took Villefort's arm, and, at\nthe same time, holding that of Madame Danglars under his own, he dragged\nthe procureur to the plantain-tree, where the shade was thickest. All\nthe other guests followed. \"Stay,\" said Monte Cristo, \"here, in this\nvery spot\" (and he stamped upon the ground), \"I had the earth dug up and\nfresh mould put in, to refresh these old trees; well, my man, digging,\nfound a box, or rather, the iron-work of a box, in the midst of which\nwas the skeleton of a newly born infant.\" Monte Cristo felt the arm of\nMadame Danglars stiffen, while that of Villefort trembled. \"A newly born\ninfant,\" repeated Debray; \"this affair becomes serious!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"I was not wrong just now then, when I\nsaid that houses had souls and faces like men, and that their exteriors\ncarried the impress of their characters. This house was gloomy because\nit was remorseful: it was remorseful because it concealed a crime.\"\n\n\"Who said it was a crime?\" asked Villefort, with a last effort.\n\n\"How? is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden?\" cried Monte\nCristo. \"And pray what do you call such an action?\"\n\n\"But who said it was buried alive?\"\n\n\"Why bury it there if it were dead? This garden has never been a\ncemetery.\"\n\n\"What is done to infanticides in this country?\" asked Major Cavalcanti\ninnocently.\n\n\"Oh, their heads are soon cut off,\" said Danglars.\n\n\"Ah, indeed?\" said Cavalcanti.\n\n\"I think so; am I not right, M. de Villefort?\" asked Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Yes, count,\" replied Villefort, in a voice now scarcely human.\n\nMonte Cristo, seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this\nscene could scarcely endure it, and not wishing to carry it too far,\nsaid, \"Come, gentlemen,--some coffee, we seem to have forgotten it,\" and\nhe conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn.\n\n\"Indeed, count,\" said Madame Danglars, \"I am ashamed to own it, but all\nyour frightful stories have so upset me, that I must beg you to let me\nsit down;\" and she fell into a chair. Monte Cristo bowed, and went\nto Madame de Villefort. \"I think Madame Danglars again requires your\nbottle,\" he said. But before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend\nthe procureur had found time to whisper to Madame Danglars, \"I must\nspeak to you.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"To-morrow.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"In my office, or in the court, if you like,--that is the surest place.\"\n\n\"I will be there.\"--At this moment Madame de Villefort approached.\n\"Thanks, my dear friend,\" said Madame Danglars, trying to smile; \"it is\nover now, and I am much better.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 64. The Beggar.\n\nThe evening passed on; Madame de Villefort expressed a desire to return\nto Paris, which Madame Danglars had not dared to do, notwithstanding the\nuneasiness she experienced. On his wife's request, M. de Villefort was\nthe first to give the signal of departure. He offered a seat in his\nlandau to Madame Danglars, that she might be under the care of his wife.\nAs for M. Danglars, absorbed in an interesting conversation with M.\nCavalcanti, he paid no attention to anything that was passing. While\nMonte Cristo had begged the smelling-bottle of Madame de Villefort, he\nhad noticed the approach of Villefort to Madame Danglars, and he soon\nguessed all that had passed between them, though the words had been\nuttered in so low a voice as hardly to be heard by Madame Danglars.\nWithout opposing their arrangements, he allowed Morrel, Chateau-Renaud,\nand Debray to leave on horseback, and the ladies in M. de Villefort's\ncarriage. Danglars, more and more delighted with Major Cavalcanti, had\noffered him a seat in his carriage. Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury\nwaiting at the door; the groom, in every respect a caricature of the\nEnglish fashion, was standing on tiptoe to hold a large iron-gray horse.\n\nAndrea had spoken very little during dinner; he was an intelligent\nlad, and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand people,\namongst whom, with dilating eyes, he saw the king's attorney. Then\nhe had been seized upon by Danglars, who, with a rapid glance at the\nstiff-necked old major and his modest son, and taking into consideration\nthe hospitality of the count, made up his mind that he was in the\nsociety of some nabob come to Paris to finish the worldly education of\nhis heir. He contemplated with unspeakable delight the large diamond\nwhich shone on the major's little finger; for the major, like a\nprudent man, in case of any accident happening to his bank-notes, had\nimmediately converted them into an available asset. Then, after dinner,\non the pretext of business, he questioned the father and son upon their\nmode of living; and the father and son, previously informed that it was\nthrough Danglars the one was to receive his 48,000 francs and the other\n50,000 livres annually, were so full of affability that they would\nhave shaken hands even with the banker's servants, so much did their\ngratitude need an object to expend itself upon. One thing above all the\nrest heightened the respect, nay almost the veneration, of Danglars\nfor Cavalcanti. The latter, faithful to the principle of Horace, nil\nadmirari, had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring\nin what lake the best lampreys were caught. Then he had eaten some\nwithout saying a word more; Danglars, therefore, concluded that such\nluxuries were common at the table of the illustrious descendant of\nthe Cavalcanti, who most likely in Lucca fed upon trout brought from\nSwitzerland, and lobsters sent from England, by the same means used by\nthe count to bring the lampreys from Lake Fusaro, and the sterlet from\nthe Volga. Thus it was with much politeness of manner that he heard\nCavalcanti pronounce these words, \"To-morrow, sir, I shall have the\nhonor of waiting upon you on business.\"\n\n\"And I, sir,\" said Danglars, \"shall be most happy to receive you.\" Upon\nwhich he offered to take Cavalcanti in his carriage to the Hotel des\nPrinces, if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son. To\nthis Cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had\nlived independently of him, that he had his own horses and carriages,\nand that not having come together, it would not be difficult for them\nto leave separately. The major seated himself, therefore, by the side\nof Danglars, who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and\neconomy which ruled this man, and yet who, being able to allow his son\n60,000 francs a year, might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500,000\nor 600,000 livres.\n\nAs for Andrea, he began, by way of showing off, to scold his groom, who,\ninstead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house, had taken it\nto the outer door, thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps\nto reach it. The groom heard him with humility, took the bit of the\nimpatient animal with his left hand, and with the right held out the\nreins to Andrea, who, taking them from him, rested his polished boot\nlightly on the step. At that moment a hand touched his shoulder. The\nyoung man turned round, thinking that Danglars or Monte Cristo had\nforgotten something they wished to tell him, and had returned just as\nthey were starting. But instead of either of these, he saw nothing but a\nstrange face, sunburnt, and encircled by a beard, with eyes brilliant as\ncarbuncles, and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set\nof white teeth, pointed and sharp as the wolf's or jackal's. A red\nhandkerchief encircled his gray head; torn and filthy garments covered\nhis large bony limbs, which seemed as though, like those of a skeleton,\nthey would rattle as he walked; and the hand with which he leaned upon\nthe young man's shoulder, and which was the first thing Andrea saw,\nseemed of gigantic size. Did the young man recognize that face by the\nlight of the lantern in his tilbury, or was he merely struck with the\nhorrible appearance of his interrogator? We cannot say; but only relate\nthe fact that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly. \"What do you want\nof me?\" he asked.\n\n\"Pardon me, my friend, if I disturb you,\" said the man with the red\nhandkerchief, \"but I want to speak to you.\"\n\n\"You have no right to beg at night,\" said the groom, endeavoring to rid\nhis master of the troublesome intruder.\n\n\"I am not begging, my fine fellow,\" said the unknown to the servant,\nwith so ironical an expression of the eye, and so frightful a smile,\nthat he withdrew; \"I only wish to say two or three words to your master,\nwho gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Andrea, with sufficient nerve for his servant not to\nperceive his agitation, \"what do you want? Speak quickly, friend.\"\n\nThe man said, in a low voice: \"I wish--I wish you to spare me the walk\nback to Paris. I am very tired, and as I have not eaten so good a dinner\nas you, I can scarcely stand.\" The young man shuddered at this strange\nfamiliarity. \"Tell me,\" he said--\"tell me what you want?\"\n\n\"Well, then, I want you to take me up in your fine carriage, and carry\nme back.\" Andrea turned pale, but said nothing.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the man, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and looking\nimpudently at the youth; \"I have taken the whim into my head; do you\nunderstand, Master Benedetto?\"\n\nAt this name, no doubt, the young man reflected a little, for he went\ntowards his groom, saying, \"This man is right; I did indeed charge him\nwith a commission, the result of which he must tell me; walk to the\nbarrier, there take a cab, that you may not be too late.\" The surprised\ngroom retired. \"Let me at least reach a shady spot,\" said Andrea.\n\n\"Oh, as for that, I'll take you to a splendid place,\" said the man with\nthe handkerchief; and taking the horse's bit he led the tilbury where\nit was certainly impossible for any one to witness the honor that Andrea\nconferred upon him.\n\n\"Don't think I want the glory of riding in your fine carriage,\" said he;\n\"oh, no, it's only because I am tired, and also because I have a little\nbusiness to talk over with you.\"\n\n\"Come, step in,\" said the young man. It was a pity this scene had not\noccurred in daylight, for it was curious to see this rascal throwing\nhimself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver\nof the tilbury. Andrea drove past the last house in the village without\nsaying a word to his companion, who smiled complacently, as though\nwell-pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle.\nOnce out of Auteuil, Andrea looked around, in order to assure himself\nthat he could neither be seen nor heard, and then, stopping the horse\nand crossing his arms before the man, he asked,--\"Now, tell me why you\ncome to disturb my tranquillity?\"\n\n\"Let me ask you why you deceived me?\"\n\n\"How have I deceived you?\"\n\n\"'How,' do you ask? When we parted at the Pont du Var, you told me you\nwere going to travel through Piedmont and Tuscany; but instead of that,\nyou come to Paris.\"\n\n\"How does that annoy you?\"\n\n\"It does not; on the contrary, I think it will answer my purpose.\"\n\n\"So,\" said Andrea, \"you are speculating upon me?\"\n\n\"What fine words he uses!\"\n\n\"I warn you, Master Caderousse, that you are mistaken.\"\n\n\"Well, well, don't be angry, my boy; you know well enough what it is\nto be unfortunate; and misfortunes make us jealous. I thought you\nwere earning a living in Tuscany or Piedmont by acting as facchino or\ncicerone, and I pitied you sincerely, as I would a child of my own. You\nknow I always did call you my child.\"\n\n\"Come, come, what then?\"\n\n\"Patience--patience!\"\n\n\"I am patient, but go on.\"\n\n\"All at once I see you pass through the barrier with a groom, a tilbury,\nand fine new clothes. You must have discovered a mine, or else become a\nstockbroker.\"\n\n\"So that, as you confess, you are jealous?\"\n\n\"No, I am pleased--so pleased that I wished to congratulate you; but as\nI am not quite properly dressed, I chose my opportunity, that I might\nnot compromise you.\"\n\n\"Yes, and a fine opportunity you have chosen!\" exclaimed Andrea; \"you\nspeak to me before my servant.\"\n\n\"How can I help that, my boy? I speak to you when I can catch you. You\nhave a quick horse, a light tilbury, you are naturally as slippery as an\neel; if I had missed you to-night, I might not have had another chance.\"\n\n\"You see, I do not conceal myself.\"\n\n\"You are lucky; I wish I could say as much, for I do conceal myself;\nand then I was afraid you would not recognize me, but you did,\" added\nCaderousse with his unpleasant smile. \"It was very polite of you.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Andrea, \"what do you want?\"\n\n\"You do not speak affectionately to me, Benedetto, my old friend, that\nis not right--take care, or I may become troublesome.\" This menace\nsmothered the young man's passion. He urged the horse again into a trot.\n\"You should not speak so to an old friend like me, Caderousse, as you\nsaid just now; you are a native of Marseilles, I am\"--\n\n\"Do you know then now what you are?\"\n\n\"No, but I was brought up in Corsica; you are old and obstinate, I\nam young and wilful. Between people like us threats are out of place,\neverything should be amicably arranged. Is it my fault if fortune, which\nhas frowned on you, has been kind to me?\"\n\n\"Fortune has been kind to you, then? Your tilbury, your groom, your\nclothes, are not then hired? Good, so much the better,\" said Caderousse,\nhis eyes sparkling with avarice.\n\n\"Oh, you knew that well enough before speaking to me,\" said Andrea,\nbecoming more and more excited. \"If I had been wearing a handkerchief\nlike yours on my head, rags on my back, and worn-out shoes on my feet,\nyou would not have known me.\"\n\n\"You wrong me, my boy; now I have found you, nothing prevents my being\nas well-dressed as any one, knowing, as I do, the goodness of your\nheart. If you have two coats you will give me one of them. I used to\ndivide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Andrea.\n\n\"What an appetite you used to have! Is it as good now?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied Andrea, laughing.\n\n\"How did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have\njust left?\"\n\n\"He is not a prince; simply a count.\"\n\n\"A count, and a rich one too, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes; but you had better not have anything to say to him, for he is not\na very good-tempered gentleman.\"\n\n\"Oh, be easy! I have no design upon your count, and you shall have\nhim all to yourself. But,\" said Caderousse, again smiling with the\ndisagreeable expression he had before assumed, \"you must pay for it--you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Well, what do you want?\"\n\n\"I think that with a hundred francs a month\"--\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I could live\"--\n\n\"Upon a hundred francs!\"\n\n\"Come--you understand me; but that with\"--\n\n\"With?\"\n\n\"With a hundred and fifty francs I should be quite happy.\"\n\n\"Here are two hundred,\" said Andrea; and he placed ten gold louis in the\nhand of Caderousse.\n\n\"Good!\" said Caderousse.\n\n\"Apply to the steward on the first day of every month, and you will\nreceive the same sum.\"\n\n\"There now, again you degrade me.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"By making me apply to the servants, when I want to transact business\nwith you alone.\"\n\n\"Well, be it so, then. Take it from me then, and so long at least as I\nreceive my income, you shall be paid yours.\"\n\n\"Come, come; I always said you were a fine fellow, and it is a blessing\nwhen good fortune happens to such as you. But tell me all about it?\"\n\n\"Why do you wish to know?\" asked Cavalcanti.\n\n\"What? do you again defy me?\"\n\n\"No; the fact is, I have found my father.\"\n\n\"What? a real father?\"\n\n\"Yes, so long as he pays me\"--\n\n\"You'll honor and believe him--that's right. What is his name?\"\n\n\"Major Cavalcanti.\"\n\n\"Is he pleased with you?\"\n\n\"So far I have appeared to answer his purpose.\"\n\n\"And who found this father for you?\"\n\n\"The Count of Monte Cristo.\"\n\n\"The man whose house you have just left?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I wish you would try and find me a situation with him as grandfather,\nsince he holds the money-chest!\"\n\n\"Well, I will mention you to him. Meanwhile, what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes, you.\"\n\n\"It is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me.\"\n\n\"Since you interest yourself in my affairs, I think it is now my turn to\nask you some questions.\"\n\n\"Ah, true. Well; I shall rent a room in some respectable house, wear\na decent coat, shave every day, and go and read the papers in a cafe.\nThen, in the evening, I shall go to the theatre; I shall look like some\nretired baker. That is what I want.\"\n\n\"Come, if you will only put this scheme into execution, and be steady,\nnothing could be better.\"\n\n\"Do you think so, M. Bossuet? And you--what will you become? A peer of\nFrance?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Andrea, \"who knows?\"\n\n\"Major Cavalcanti is already one, perhaps; but then, hereditary rank is\nabolished.\"\n\n\"No politics, Caderousse. And now that you have all you want, and that\nwe understand each other, jump down from the tilbury and disappear.\"\n\n\"Not at all, my good friend.\"\n\n\"How? Not at all?\"\n\n\"Why, just think for a moment; with this red handkerchief on my head,\nwith scarcely any shoes, no papers, and ten gold napoleons in my pocket,\nwithout reckoning what was there before--making in all about two hundred\nfrancs,--why, I should certainly be arrested at the barriers. Then,\nto justify myself, I should say that you gave me the money; this would\ncause inquiries, it would be found that I left Toulon without giving\ndue notice, and I should then be escorted back to the shores of the\nMediterranean. Then I should become simply No. 106, and good-by to\nmy dream of resembling the retired baker! No, no, my boy; I prefer\nremaining honorably in the capital.\" Andrea scowled. Certainly, as he\nhad himself owned, the reputed son of Major Cavalcanti was a wilful\nfellow. He drew up for a minute, threw a rapid glance around him, and\nthen his hand fell instantly into his pocket, where it began playing\nwith a pistol. But, meanwhile, Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes\noff his companion, passed his hand behind his back, and opened a long\nSpanish knife, which he always carried with him, to be ready in case\nof need. The two friends, as we see, were worthy of and understood one\nanother. Andrea's hand left his pocket inoffensively, and was carried\nup to the red mustache, which it played with for some time. \"Good\nCaderousse,\" he said, \"how happy you will be.\"\n\n\"I will do my best,\" said the inn-keeper of the Pont du Gard, shutting\nup his knife.\n\n\"Well, then, we will go into Paris. But how will you pass through the\nbarrier without exciting suspicion? It seems to me that you are in more\ndanger riding than on foot.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Caderousse, \"we shall see.\" He then took the great-coat\nwith the large collar, which the groom had left behind in the tilbury,\nand put it on his back; then he took off Cavalcanti's hat, which he\nplaced upon his own head, and finally he assumed the careless attitude\nof a servant whose master drives himself.\n\n\"But, tell me,\" said Andrea, \"am I to remain bareheaded?\"\n\n\"Pooh,\" said Caderousse; \"it is so windy that your hat can easily appear\nto have blown off.\"\n\n\"Come, come; enough of this,\" said Cavalcanti.\n\n\"What are you waiting for?\" said Caderousse. \"I hope I am not the\ncause.\"\n\n\"Hush,\" said Andrea. They passed the barrier without accident. At the\nfirst cross street Andrea stopped his horse, and Caderousse leaped out.\n\n\"Well!\" said Andrea,--\"my servant's coat and my hat?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Caderousse, \"you would not like me to risk taking cold?\"\n\n\"But what am I to do?\"\n\n\"You? Oh, you are young while I am beginning to get old. Au revoir,\nBenedetto;\" and running into a court, he disappeared. \"Alas,\" said\nAndrea, sighing, \"one cannot be completely happy in this world!\"\n\n\n\nChapter 65. A Conjugal Scene.\n\nAt the Place Louis XV. the three young people separated--that is to\nsay, Morrel went to the Boulevards, Chateau-Renaud to the Pont de\nla Revolution, and Debray to the Quai. Most probably Morrel and\nChateau-Renaud returned to their \"domestic hearths,\" as they say in the\ngallery of the Chamber in well-turned speeches, and in the theatre of\nthe Rue Richelieu in well-written pieces; but it was not the case with\nDebray. When he reached the wicket of the Louvre, he turned to the left,\ngalloped across the Carrousel, passed through the Rue Saint-Roch, and,\nissuing from the Rue de la Michodiere, he arrived at M. Danglars' door\njust at the same time that Villefort's landau, after having deposited\nhim and his wife at the Faubourg St. Honore, stopped to leave the\nbaroness at her own house. Debray, with the air of a man familiar with\nthe house, entered first into the court, threw his bridle into the hands\nof a footman, and returned to the door to receive Madame Danglars, to\nwhom he offered his arm, to conduct her to her apartments. The gate once\nclosed, and Debray and the baroness alone in the court, he asked,--\"What\nwas the matter with you, Hermine? and why were you so affected at that\nstory, or rather fable, which the count related?\"\n\n\"Because I have been in such shocking spirits all the evening, my\nfriend,\" said the baroness.\n\n\"No, Hermine,\" replied Debray; \"you cannot make me believe that; on the\ncontrary, you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count's.\nM. Danglars was disagreeable, certainly, but I know how much you care\nfor his ill-humor. Some one has vexed you; I will allow no one to annoy\nyou.\"\n\n\"You are deceived, Lucien, I assure you,\" replied Madame Danglars; \"and\nwhat I have told you is really the case, added to the ill-humor you\nremarked, but which I did not think it worth while to allude to.\" It\nwas evident that Madame Danglars was suffering from that nervous\nirritability which women frequently cannot account for even to\nthemselves; or that, as Debray had guessed, she had experienced some\nsecret agitation that she would not acknowledge to any one. Being a\nman who knew that the former of these symptoms was one of the inherent\npenalties of womanhood, he did not then press his inquiries, but waited\nfor a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate\nher, or receive an avowal proprio motu. At the door of her apartment the\nbaroness met Mademoiselle Cornelie, her confidential maid. \"What is my\ndaughter doing?\" asked Madame Danglars.\n\n\"She practiced all the evening, and then went to bed,\" replied\nMademoiselle Cornelie.\n\n\"Yet I think I hear her piano.\"\n\n\"It is Mademoiselle Louise d'Armilly, who is playing while Mademoiselle\nDanglars is in bed.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Madame Danglars, \"come and undress me.\" They entered\nthe bedroom. Debray stretched himself upon a large couch, and Madame\nDanglars passed into her dressing-room with Mademoiselle Cornelie. \"My\ndear M. Lucien,\" said Madame Danglars through the door, \"you are always\ncomplaining that Eugenie will not address a word to you.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said Lucien, playing with a little dog, who, recognizing him\nas a friend of the house, expected to be caressed, \"I am not the only\none who makes similar complaints, I think I heard Morcerf say that he\ncould not extract a word from his betrothed.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Madame Danglars; \"yet I think this will all pass off, and\nthat you will one day see her enter your study.\"\n\n\"My study?\"\n\n\"At least that of the minister.\"\n\n\"Why so!\"\n\n\"To ask for an engagement at the Opera. Really, I never saw such an\ninfatuation for music; it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of\nfashion.\" Debray smiled. \"Well,\" said he, \"let her come, with your\nconsent and that of the baron, and we will try and give her an\nengagement, though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers.\"\n\n\"Go, Cornelie,\" said Madame Danglars, \"I do not require you any longer.\"\n\nCornelie obeyed, and the next minute Madame Danglars left her room in\na charming loose dress, and came and sat down close to Debray. Then she\nbegan thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel. Lucien looked at her\nfor a moment in silence. \"Come, Hermine,\" he said, after a short time,\n\"answer candidly,--something vexes you--is it not so?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" answered the baroness.\n\nAnd yet, as she could scarcely breathe, she rose and went towards\na looking-glass. \"I am frightful to-night,\" she said. Debray rose,\nsmiling, and was about to contradict the baroness upon this latter\npoint, when the door opened suddenly. M. Danglars appeared; Debray\nreseated himself. At the noise of the door Madame Danglars turned round,\nand looked upon her husband with an astonishment she took no trouble\nto conceal. \"Good-evening, madame,\" said the banker; \"good-evening, M.\nDebray.\"\n\nProbably the baroness thought this unexpected visit signified a desire\nto make up for the sharp words he had uttered during the day. Assuming\na dignified air, she turned round to Debray, without answering her\nhusband. \"Read me something, M. Debray,\" she said. Debray, who was\nslightly disturbed at this visit, recovered himself when he saw the\ncalmness of the baroness, and took up a book marked by a mother-of-pearl\nknife inlaid with gold. \"Excuse me,\" said the banker, \"but you will\ntire yourself, baroness, by such late hours, and M. Debray lives some\ndistance from here.\"\n\nDebray was petrified, not only to hear Danglars speak so calmly and\npolitely, but because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness\nthere really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to anything his\nwife might wish to do. The baroness was also surprised, and showed her\nastonishment by a look which would doubtless have had some effect upon\nher husband if he had not been intently occupied with the paper, where\nhe was looking to see the closing stock quotations. The result was, that\nthe proud look entirely failed of its purpose.\n\n\"M. Lucien,\" said the baroness, \"I assure you I have no desire to sleep,\nand that I have a thousand things to tell you this evening, which you\nmust listen to, even though you slept while hearing me.\"\n\n\"I am at your service, madame,\" replied Lucien coldly.\n\n\"My dear M. Debray,\" said the banker, \"do not kill yourself to-night\nlistening to the follies of Madame Danglars, for you can hear them as\nwell to-morrow; but I claim to-night and will devote it, if you will\nallow me, to talk over some serious matters with my wife.\" This time\nthe blow was so well aimed, and hit so directly, that Lucien and the\nbaroness were staggered, and they interrogated each other with their\neyes, as if to seek help against this aggression, but the irresistible\nwill of the master of the house prevailed, and the husband was\nvictorious.\n\n\"Do not think I wish to turn you out, my dear Debray,\" continued\nDanglars; \"oh, no, not at all. An unexpected occurrence forces me to ask\nmy wife to have a little conversation with me; it is so rarely I make\nsuch a request, I am sure you cannot grudge it to me.\" Debray muttered\nsomething, bowed and went out, knocking himself against the edge of the\ndoor, like Nathan in \"Athalie.\"\n\n\"It is extraordinary,\" he said, when the door was closed behind him,\n\"how easily these husbands, whom we ridicule, gain an advantage over\nus.\"\n\nLucien having left, Danglars took his place on the sofa, closed the open\nbook, and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude, he began\nplaying with the dog; but the animal, not liking him as well as Debray,\nand attempting to bite him, Danglars seized him by the skin of his neck\nand threw him upon a couch on the other side of the room. The animal\nuttered a cry during the transit, but, arrived at its destination, it\ncrouched behind the cushions, and stupefied at such unusual treatment\nremained silent and motionless. \"Do you know, sir,\" asked the baroness,\n\"that you are improving? Generally you are only rude, but to-night you\nare brutal.\"\n\n\"It is because I am in a worse humor than usual,\" replied Danglars.\nHermine looked at the banker with supreme disdain. These glances\nfrequently exasperated the pride of Danglars, but this evening he took\nno notice of them.\n\n\"And what have I to do with your ill-humor?\" said the baroness,\nirritated at the impassibility of her husband; \"do these things concern\nme? Keep your ill-humor at home in your money boxes, or, since you have\nclerks whom you pay, vent it upon them.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" replied Danglars; \"your advice is wrong, so I shall not follow\nit. My money boxes are my Pactolus, as, I think, M. Demoustier says, and\nI will not retard its course, or disturb its calm. My clerks are honest\nmen, who earn my fortune, whom I pay much below their deserts, if I may\nvalue them according to what they bring in; therefore I shall not get\ninto a passion with them; those with whom I will be in a passion are\nthose who eat my dinners, mount my horses, and exhaust my fortune.\"\n\n\"And pray who are the persons who exhaust your fortune? Explain yourself\nmore clearly, I beg, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, make yourself easy!--I am not speaking riddles, and you will soon\nknow what I mean. The people who exhaust my fortune are those who draw\nout 700,000 francs in the course of an hour.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you, sir,\" said the baroness, trying to disguise\nthe agitation of her voice and the flush of her face. \"You understand me\nperfectly, on the contrary,\" said Danglars: \"but, if you will persist,\nI will tell you that I have just lost 700,000 francs upon the Spanish\nloan.\"\n\n\"And pray,\" asked the baroness, \"am I responsible for this loss?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Is it my fault you have lost 700,000 francs?\"\n\n\"Certainly it is not mine.\"\n\n\"Once for all, sir,\" replied the baroness sharply, \"I tell you I will\nnot hear cash named; it is a style of language I never heard in the\nhouse of my parents or in that of my first husband.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can well believe that, for neither of them was worth a penny.\"\n\n\"The better reason for my not being conversant with the slang of the\nbank, which is here dinning in my ears from morning to night; that noise\nof jingling crowns, which are constantly being counted and re-counted,\nis odious to me. I only know one thing I dislike more, which is the\nsound of your voice.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Danglars. \"Well, this surprises me, for I thought you\ntook the liveliest interest in all my affairs!\"\n\n\"I? What could put such an idea into your head?\"\n\n\"Yourself.\"\n\n\"Ah?--what next?\"\n\n\"Most assuredly.\"\n\n\"I should like to know upon what occasion?\"\n\n\"Oh, mon Dieu, that is very easily done. Last February you were the\nfirst who told me of the Haitian funds. You had dreamed that a ship had\nentered the harbor at Havre, that this ship brought news that a\npayment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made. I know how\nclear-sighted your dreams are; I therefore purchased immediately as many\nshares as I could of the Haitian debt, and I gained 400,000 francs by\nit, of which 100,000 have been honestly paid to you. You spent it as you\npleased; that was your business. In March there was a question about a\ngrant to a railway. Three companies presented themselves, each offering\nequal securities. You told me that your instinct,--and although you\npretend to know nothing about speculations, I think on the contrary,\nthat your comprehension is very clear upon certain affairs,--well, you\ntold me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given\nto the company called the Southern. I bought two thirds of the shares\nof that company; as you had foreseen, the shares trebled in value, and\nI picked up a million, from which 250,000 francs were paid to you for\npin-money. How have you spent this 250,000 francs?--it is no business of\nmine.\"\n\n\"When are you coming to the point?\" cried the baroness, shivering with\nanger and impatience.\n\n\"Patience, madame, I am coming to it.\"\n\n\"That's fortunate.\"\n\n\"In April you went to dine at the minister's. You heard a private\nconversation respecting Spanish affairs--on the expulsion of Don Carlos.\nI bought some Spanish shares. The expulsion took place and I pocketed\n600,000 francs the day Charles V. repassed the Bidassoa. Of these\n600,000 francs you took 50,000 crowns. They were yours, you disposed of\nthem according to your fancy, and I asked no questions; but it is not\nthe less true that you have this year received 500,000 livres.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, and what then?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, it was just after this that you spoiled everything.\"\n\n\"Really, your manner of speaking\"--\n\n\"It expresses my meaning, and that is all I want. Well, three days after\nthat you talked politics with M. Debray, and you fancied from his words\nthat Don Carlos had returned to Spain. Well, I sold my shares, the news\ngot out, and I no longer sold--I gave them away, next day I find the\nnews was false, and by this false report I have lost 700,000 francs.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, since I gave you a fourth of my gains, I think you owe me a\nfourth of my losses; the fourth of 700,000 francs is 175,000 francs.\"\n\n\"What you say is absurd, and I cannot see why M. Debray's name is mixed\nup in this affair.\"\n\n\"Because if you do not possess the 175,000 francs I reclaim, you must\nhave lent them to your friends, and M. Debray is one of your friends.\"\n\n\"For shame!\" exclaimed the baroness.\n\n\"Oh, let us have no gestures, no screams, no modern drama, or you will\noblige me to tell you that I see Debray leave here, pocketing the whole\nof the 500,000 livres you have handed over to him this year, while\nhe smiles to himself, saying that he has found what the most skilful\nplayers have never discovered--that is, a roulette where he wins without\nplaying, and is no loser when he loses.\" The baroness became enraged.\n\"Wretch!\" she cried, \"will you dare to tell me you did not know what you\nnow reproach me with?\"\n\n\"I do not say that I did know it, and I do not say that I did not know\nit. I merely tell you to look into my conduct during the last four years\nthat we have ceased to be husband and wife, and see whether it has not\nalways been consistent. Some time after our rupture, you wished to\nstudy music, under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful\nappearance at the Theatre Italien; at the same time I felt inclined to\nlearn dancing of the danseuse who acquired such a reputation in London.\nThis cost me, on your account and mine, 100,000 francs. I said nothing,\nfor we must have peace in the house; and 100,000 francs for a lady and\ngentleman to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too\nmuch. Well, you soon become tired of singing, and you take a fancy\nto study diplomacy with the minister's secretary. You understand, it\nsignifies nothing to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your\nown cashbox. But to-day I find you are drawing on mine, and that your\napprenticeship may cost me 700,000 francs per month. Stop there, madame,\nfor this cannot last. Either the diplomatist must give his lessons\ngratis, and I will tolerate him, or he must never set his foot again in\nmy house;--do you understand, madame?\"\n\n\"Oh, this is too much,\" cried Hermine, choking, \"you are worse than\ndespicable.\"\n\n\"But,\" continued Danglars, \"I find you did not even pause there\"--\n\n\"Insults!\"\n\n\"You are right; let us leave these facts alone, and reason coolly. I\nhave never interfered in your affairs excepting for your good; treat me\nin the same way. You say you have nothing to do with my cash-box. Be\nit so. Do as you like with your own, but do not fill or empty mine.\nBesides, how do I know that this was not a political trick, that the\nminister enraged at seeing me in the opposition, and jealous of the\npopular sympathy I excite, has not concerted with M. Debray to ruin me?\"\n\n\"A probable thing!\"\n\n\"Why not? Who ever heard of such an occurrence as this?--a false\ntelegraphic despatch--it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be\nmade as they were in the last two telegrams. It was done on purpose for\nme--I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the baroness humbly, \"are you not aware that the man\nemployed there was dismissed, that they talked of going to law with him,\nthat orders were issued to arrest him and that this order would have\nbeen put into execution if he had not escaped by flight, which proves\nthat he was either mad or guilty? It was a mistake.\"\n\n\"Yes, which made fools laugh, which caused the minister to have a\nsleepless night, which has caused the minister's secretaries to blacken\nseveral sheets of paper, but which has cost me 700,000 francs.\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" said Hermine suddenly, \"if all this is, as you say, caused\nby M. Debray, why, instead of going direct to him, do you come and tell\nme of it? Why, to accuse the man, do you address the woman?\"\n\n\"Do I know M. Debray?--do I wish to know him?--do I wish to know that he\ngives advice?--do I wish to follow it?--do I speculate? No; you do all\nthis, not I.\"\n\n\"Still it seems to me, that as you profit by it--\"\n\nDanglars shrugged his shoulders. \"Foolish creature,\" he exclaimed.\n\"Women fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three\nintrigues without being the talk of Paris! But know that if you had\neven hidden your irregularities from your husband, who has but the\ncommencement of the art--for generally husbands will not see--you would\nthen have been but a faint imitation of most of your friends among the\nwomen of the world. But it has not been so with me,--I see, and always\nhave seen, during the last sixteen years. You may, perhaps, have hidden\na thought; but not a step, not an action, not a fault, has escaped me,\nwhile you flattered yourself upon your address, and firmly believed you\nhad deceived me. What has been the result?--that, thanks to my pretended\nignorance, there is none of your friends, from M. de Villefort to M.\nDebray, who has not trembled before me. There is not one who has not\ntreated me as the master of the house,--the only title I desire with\nrespect to you; there is not one, in fact, who would have dared to speak\nof me as I have spoken of them this day. I will allow you to make me\nhateful, but I will prevent your rendering me ridiculous, and, above\nall, I forbid you to ruin me.\"\n\nThe baroness had been tolerably composed until the name of Villefort had\nbeen pronounced; but then she became pale, and, rising, as if touched by\na spring, she stretched out her hands as though conjuring an apparition;\nshe then took two or three steps towards her husband, as though to tear\nthe secret from him, of which he was ignorant, or which he withheld from\nsome odious calculation,--odious, as all his calculations were. \"M. de\nVillefort!--What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that M. de Nargonne, your first husband, being neither a\nphilosopher nor a banker, or perhaps being both, and seeing there was\nnothing to be got out of a king's attorney, died of grief or anger at\nfinding, after an absence of nine months, that you had been enceinte\nsix. I am brutal,--I not only allow it, but boast of it; it is one\nof the reasons of my success in commercial business. Why did he kill\nhimself instead of you? Because he had no cash to save. My life belongs\nto my cash. M. Debray has made me lose 700,000 francs; let him bear his\nshare of the loss, and we will go on as before; if not, let him become\nbankrupt for the 250,000 livres, and do as all bankrupts do--disappear.\nHe is a charming fellow, I allow, when his news is correct; but when\nit is not, there are fifty others in the world who would do better than\nhe.\"\n\nMadame Danglars was rooted to the spot; she made a violent effort\nto reply to this last attack, but she fell upon a chair thinking of\nVillefort, of the dinner scene, of the strange series of misfortunes\nwhich had taken place in her house during the last few days, and changed\nthe usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate.\nDanglars did not even look at her, though she did her best to faint.\nHe shut the bedroom door after him, without adding another word, and\nreturned to his apartments; and when Madame Danglars recovered from her\nhalf-fainting condition, she could almost believe that she had had a\ndisagreeable dream.\n\n\n\nChapter 66. Matrimonial Projects.\n\nThe day following this scene, at the hour the banker usually chose to\npay a visit to Madame Danglars on his way to his office, his coupe\ndid not appear. At this time, that is, about half-past twelve, Madame\nDanglars ordered her carriage, and went out. Danglars, hidden behind a\ncurtain, watched the departure he had been waiting for. He gave orders\nthat he should be informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared; but at\ntwo o'clock she had not returned. He then called for his horses, drove\nto the Chamber, and inscribed his name to speak against the budget. From\ntwelve to two o'clock Danglars had remained in his study, unsealing his\ndispatches, and becoming more and more sad every minute, heaping\nfigure upon figure, and receiving, among other visits, one from Major\nCavalcanti, who, as stiff and exact as ever, presented himself precisely\nat the hour named the night before, to terminate his business with the\nbanker. On leaving the Chamber, Danglars, who had shown violent marks of\nagitation during the sitting, and been more bitter than ever against the\nministry, re-entered his carriage, and told the coachman to drive to the\nAvenue des Champs-Elysees, No. 30.\n\nMonte Cristo was at home; only he was engaged with some one and begged\nDanglars to wait for a moment in the drawing-room. While the banker was\nwaiting in the anteroom, the door opened, and a man dressed as an abbe\nand doubtless more familiar with the house than he was, came in and\ninstead of waiting, merely bowed, passed on to the farther apartments,\nand disappeared. A minute after the door by which the priest had entered\nreopened, and Monte Cristo appeared. \"Pardon me,\" said he, \"my dear\nbaron, but one of my friends, the Abbe Busoni, whom you perhaps saw pass\nby, has just arrived in Paris; not having seen him for a long time, I\ncould not make up my mind to leave him sooner, so I hope this will be\nsufficient reason for my having made you wait.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Danglars, \"it is my fault; I have chosen my visit at a wrong\ntime, and will retire.\"\n\n\"Not at all; on the contrary, be seated; but what is the matter\nwith you? You look careworn; really, you alarm me. Melancholy in a\ncapitalist, like the appearance of a comet, presages some misfortune to\nthe world.\"\n\n\"I have been in ill-luck for several days,\" said Danglars, \"and I have\nheard nothing but bad news.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed?\" said Monte Cristo. \"Have you had another fall at the\nBourse?\"\n\n\"No; I am safe for a few days at least. I am only annoyed about a\nbankrupt of Trieste.\"\n\n\"Really? Does it happen to be Jacopo Manfredi?\"\n\n\"Exactly so. Imagine a man who has transacted business with me for I\ndon't know how long, to the amount of 800,000 or 900,000 francs during\nthe year. Never a mistake or delay--a fellow who paid like a prince.\nWell, I was a million in advance with him, and now my fine Jacopo\nManfredi suspends payment!\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"It is an unheard-of fatality. I draw upon him for 600,000. francs, my\nbills are returned unpaid, and, more than that, I hold bills of\nexchange signed by him to the value of 400,000. francs, payable at his\ncorrespondent's in Paris at the end of this month. To-day is the 30th.\nI present them; but my correspondent has disappeared. This, with my\nSpanish affairs, made a pretty end to the month.\"\n\n\"Then you really lost by that affair in Spain?\"\n\n\"Yes; only 700,000 francs out of my cash-box--nothing more!\"\n\n\"Why, how could you make such a mistake--such an old stager?\"\n\n\"Oh, it is all my wife's fault. She dreamed Don Carlos had returned to\nSpain; she believes in dreams. It is magnetism, she says, and when she\ndreams a thing it is sure to happen, she assures me. On this conviction\nI allow her to speculate, she having her bank and her stockbroker; she\nspeculated and lost. It is true she speculates with her own money, not\nmine; nevertheless, you can understand that when 700,000 francs leave\nthe wife's pocket, the husband always finds it out. But do you mean to\nsay you have not heard of this? Why, the thing has made a tremendous\nnoise.\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard it spoken of, but I did not know the details, and then no\none can be more ignorant than I am of the affairs in the Bourse.\"\n\n\"Then you do not speculate?\"\n\n\"I?--How could I speculate when I already have so much trouble in\nregulating my income? I should be obliged, besides my steward, to keep\na clerk and a boy. But touching these Spanish affairs, I think that the\nbaroness did not dream the whole of the Don Carlos matter. The papers\nsaid something about it, did they not?\"\n\n\"Then you believe the papers?\"\n\n\"I?--not the least in the world; only I fancied that the honest Messager\nwas an exception to the rule, and that it only announced telegraphic\ndespatches.\"\n\n\"Well, that's what puzzles me,\" replied Danglars; \"the news of the\nreturn of Don Carlos was brought by telegraph.\"\n\n\"So that,\" said Monte Cristo, \"you have lost nearly 1,700,000 francs\nthis month.\"\n\n\"Not nearly, indeed; that is exactly my loss.\"\n\n\"Diable,\" said Monte Cristo compassionately, \"it is a hard blow for a\nthird-rate fortune.\"\n\n\"Third-rate,\" said Danglars, rather humble, \"what do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" continued Monte Cristo, \"I make three assortments in\nfortune--first-rate, second-rate, and third-rate fortunes. I call those\nfirst-rate which are composed of treasures one possesses under one's\nhand, such as mines, lands, and funded property, in such states as\nFrance, Austria, and England, provided these treasures and property form\na total of about a hundred millions; I call those second-rate fortunes,\nthat are gained by manufacturing enterprises, joint-stock companies,\nviceroyalties, and principalities, not drawing more than 1,500,000\nfrancs, the whole forming a capital of about fifty millions; finally,\nI call those third-rate fortunes, which are composed of a fluctuating\ncapital, dependent upon the will of others, or upon chances which\na bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes, such as banks,\nspeculations of the day--in fact, all operations under the influence of\ngreater or less mischances, the whole bringing in a real or fictitious\ncapital of about fifteen millions. I think this is about your position,\nis it not?\"\n\n\"Confound it, yes!\" replied Danglars.\n\n\"The result, then, of six more such months as this would be to reduce\nthe third-rate house to despair.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Danglars, becoming very pale, how you are running on!\"\n\n\"Let us imagine seven such months,\" continued Monte Cristo, in the same\ntone. \"Tell me, have you ever thought that seven times 1,700,000 francs\nmake nearly twelve millions? No, you have not;--well, you are right,\nfor if you indulged in such reflections, you would never risk your\nprincipal, which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized\nman. We have our clothes, some more splendid than others,--this is our\ncredit; but when a man dies he has only his skin; in the same way, on\nretiring from business, you have nothing but your real principal of\nabout five or six millions, at the most; for third-rate fortunes are\nnever more than a fourth of what they appear to be, like the locomotive\non a railway, the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam\nsurrounding it. Well, out of the five or six millions which form your\nreal capital, you have just lost nearly two millions, which must, of\ncourse, in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune;\nto follow out my simile, your skin has been opened by bleeding, and this\nif repeated three or four times will cause death--so pay attention to\nit, my dear Monsieur Danglars. Do you want money? Do you wish me to lend\nyou some?\"\n\n\"What a bad calculator you are!\" exclaimed Danglars, calling to his\nassistance all his philosophy and dissimulation. \"I have made money at\nthe same time by speculations which have succeeded. I have made up\nthe loss of blood by nutrition. I lost a battle in Spain, I have been\ndefeated in Trieste, but my naval army in India will have taken some\ngalleons, and my Mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine.\"\n\n\"Very good, very good! But the wound remains and will reopen at the\nfirst loss.\"\n\n\"No, for I am only embarked in certainties,\" replied Danglars, with\nthe air of a mountebank sounding his own praises; \"to involve me, three\ngovernments must crumble to dust.\"\n\n\"Well, such things have been.\"\n\n\"That there should be a famine!\"\n\n\"Recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine.\"\n\n\"Or, that the sea should become dry, as in the days of Pharaoh, and even\nthen my vessels would become caravans.\"\n\n\"So much the better. I congratulate you, my dear M. Danglars,\" said\nMonte Cristo; \"I see I was deceived, and that you belong to the class of\nsecond-rate fortunes.\"\n\n\"I think I may aspire to that honor,\" said Danglars with a smile, which\nreminded Monte Cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond\nof daubing into their pictures of ruins. \"But, while we are speaking of\nbusiness,\" Danglars added, pleased to find an opportunity of changing\nthe subject, \"tell me what I am to do for M. Cavalcanti.\"\n\n\"Give him money, if he is recommended to you, and the recommendation\nseems good.\"\n\n\"Excellent; he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40,000\nfrancs, payable at sight, on you, signed by Busoni, and returned by you\nto me, with your indorsement--of course, I immediately counted him over\nthe forty bank-notes.\"\n\nMonte Cristo nodded his head in token of assent. \"But that is not all,\"\ncontinued Danglars; \"he has opened an account with my house for his\nson.\"\n\n\"May I ask how much he allows the young man?\"\n\n\"Five thousand francs per month.\"\n\n\"Sixty thousand francs per year. I thought I was right in believing that\nCavalcanti to be a stingy fellow. How can a young man live upon 5,000\nfrancs a month?\"\n\n\"But you understand that if the young man should want a few thousands\nmore\"--\n\n\"Do not advance it; the father will never repay it. You do not know\nthese ultramontane millionaires; they are regular misers. And by whom\nwere they recommended to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, by the house of Fenzi, one of the best in Florence.\"\n\n\"I do not mean to say you will lose, but, nevertheless, mind you hold to\nthe terms of the agreement.\"\n\n\"Would you not trust the Cavalcanti?\"\n\n\"I? oh, I would advance six millions on his signature. I was only\nspeaking in reference to the second-rate fortunes we were mentioning\njust now.\"\n\n\"And with all this, how unassuming he is! I should never have taken him\nfor anything more than a mere major.\"\n\n\"And you would have flattered him, for certainly, as you say, he has\nno manner. The first time I saw him he appeared to me like an old\nlieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets. But all the Italians\nare the same; they are like old Jews when they are not glittering in\nOriental splendor.\"\n\n\"The young man is better,\" said Danglars.\n\n\"Yes; a little nervous, perhaps, but, upon the whole, he appeared\ntolerable. I was uneasy about him.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you met him at my house, just after his introduction into the\nworld, as they told me. He has been travelling with a very severe tutor,\nand had never been to Paris before.\"\n\n\"Ah, I believe noblemen marry amongst themselves, do they not?\" asked\nDanglars carelessly; \"they like to unite their fortunes.\"\n\n\"It is usual, certainly; but Cavalcanti is an original who does nothing\nlike other people. I cannot help thinking that he has brought his son to\nFrance to choose a wife.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"And you have heard his fortune mentioned?\"\n\n\"Nothing else was talked of; only some said he was worth millions, and\nothers that he did not possess a farthing.\"\n\n\"And what is your opinion?\"\n\n\"I ought not to influence you, because it is only my own personal\nimpression.\"\n\n\"Well, and it is that\"--\n\n\"My opinion is, that all these old podestas, these ancient\ncondottieri,--for the Cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed\nprovinces,--my opinion, I say, is, that they have buried their millions\nin corners, the secret of which they have transmitted only to their\neldest sons, who have done the same from generation to generation; and\nthe proof of this is seen in their yellow and dry appearance, like the\nflorins of the republic, which, from being constantly gazed upon, have\nbecome reflected in them.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Danglars, \"and this is further supported by the fact\nof their not possessing an inch of land.\"\n\n\"Very little, at least; I know of none which Cavalcanti possesses,\nexcepting his palace in Lucca.\"\n\n\"Ah, he has a palace?\" said Danglars, laughing; \"come, that is\nsomething.\"\n\n\"Yes; and more than that, he lets it to the Minister of Finance while\nhe lives in a simple house. Oh, as I told you before, I think the old\nfellow is very close.\"\n\n\"Come, you do not flatter him.\"\n\n\"I scarcely know him; I think I have seen him three times in my life;\nall I know relating to him is through Busoni and himself. He was telling\nme this morning that, tired of letting his property lie dormant in\nItaly, which is a dead nation, he wished to find a method, either in\nFrance or England, of multiplying his millions, but remember, that\nthough I place great confidence in Busoni, I am not responsible for\nthis.\"\n\n\"Never mind; accept my thanks for the client you have sent me. It is a\nfine name to inscribe on my ledgers, and my cashier was quite proud of\nit when I explained to him who the Cavalcanti were. By the way, this is\nmerely a simple question, when this sort of people marry their sons, do\nthey give them any fortune?\"\n\n\"Oh, that depends upon circumstances. I know an Italian prince, rich as\na gold mine, one of the noblest families in Tuscany, who, when his sons\nmarried according to his wish, gave them millions; and when they married\nagainst his consent, merely allowed them thirty crowns a month. Should\nAndrea marry according to his father's views, he will, perhaps, give him\none, two, or three millions. For example, supposing it were the daughter\nof a banker, he might take an interest in the house of the father-in-law\nof his son; then again, if he disliked his choice, the major takes the\nkey, double-locks his coffer, and Master Andrea would be obliged to live\nlike the sons of a Parisian family, by shuffling cards or rattling the\ndice.\"\n\n\"Ah, that boy will find out some Bavarian or Peruvian princess; he will\nwant a crown and an immense fortune.\"\n\n\"No; these grand lords on the other side of the Alps frequently marry\ninto plain families; like Jupiter, they like to cross the race. But do\nyou wish to marry Andrea, my dear M. Danglars, that you are asking so\nmany questions?\"\n\n\"Ma foi,\" said Danglars, \"it would not be a bad speculation, I fancy,\nand you know I am a speculator.\"\n\n\"You are not thinking of Mademoiselle Danglars, I hope; you would not\nlike poor Andrea to have his throat cut by Albert?\"\n\n\"Albert,\" repeated Danglars, shrugging his shoulders; \"ah, well; he\nwould care very little about it, I think.\"\n\n\"But he is betrothed to your daughter, I believe?\"\n\n\"Well, M. de Morcerf and I have talked about this marriage, but Madame\nde Morcerf and Albert\"--\n\n\"You do not mean to say that it would not be a good match?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I imagine that Mademoiselle Danglars is as good as M. de\nMorcerf.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Danglars' fortune will be great, no doubt, especially if\nthe telegraph should not make any more mistakes.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do not mean her fortune only; but tell me\"--\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Why did you not invite M. and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner?\"\n\n\"I did so, but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf being\nobliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea air.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Danglars, laughing, \"it would do her a great deal of\ngood.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because it is the air she always breathed in her youth.\" Monte Cristo\ntook no notice of this ill-natured remark.\n\n\"But still, if Albert be not so rich as Mademoiselle Danglars,\" said the\ncount, \"you must allow that he has a fine name?\"\n\n\"So he has; but I like mine as well.\"\n\n\"Certainly; your name is popular, and does honor to the title they have\nadorned it with; but you are too intelligent not to know that according\nto a prejudice, too firmly rooted to be exterminated, a nobility which\ndates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only reckon\ntwenty years.\"\n\n\"And for this very reason,\" said Danglars with a smile, which he\ntried to make sardonic, \"I prefer M. Andrea Cavalcanti to M. Albert de\nMorcerf.\"\n\n\"Still, I should not think the Morcerfs would yield to the Cavalcanti?\"\n\n\"The Morcerfs!--Stay, my dear count,\" said Danglars; \"you are a man of\nthe world, are you not?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"And you understand heraldry?\"\n\n\"A little.\"\n\n\"Well, look at my coat-of-arms, it is worth more than Morcerf's.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because, though I am not a baron by birth, my real name is, at least,\nDanglars.\"\n\n\"Well, what then?\"\n\n\"While his name is not Morcerf.\"\n\n\"How?--not Morcerf?\"\n\n\"Not the least in the world.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"I have been made a baron, so that I actually am one; he made himself a\ncount, so that he is not one at all.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Listen my dear count; M. de Morcerf has been my friend, or rather my\nacquaintance, during the last thirty years. You know I have made the\nmost of my arms, though I never forgot my origin.\"\n\n\"A proof of great humility or great pride,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Well, when I was a clerk, Morcerf was a mere fisherman.\"\n\n\"And then he was called\"--\n\n\"Fernand.\"\n\n\"Only Fernand?\"\n\n\"Fernand Mondego.\"\n\n\"You are sure?\"\n\n\"Pardieu, I have bought enough fish of him to know his name.\"\n\n\"Then, why did you think of giving your daughter to him?\"\n\n\"Because Fernand and Danglars, being both parvenus, both having become\nnoble, both rich, are about equal in worth, excepting that there have\nbeen certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing!\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name of\nFernand Mondego. I have heard that name in Greece.\"\n\n\"In conjunction with the affairs of Ali Pasha?\"\n\n\"Exactly so.\"\n\n\"This is the mystery,\" said Danglars. \"I acknowledge I would have given\nanything to find it out.\"\n\n\"It would be very easy if you much wished it?\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Probably you have some correspondent in Greece?\"\n\n\"I should think so.\"\n\n\"At Yanina?\"\n\n\"Everywhere.\"\n\n\"Well, write to your correspondent in Yanina, and ask him what part was\nplayed by a Frenchman named Fernand Mondego in the catastrophe of Ali\nTepelini.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" exclaimed Danglars, rising quickly, \"I will write\nto-day.\"\n\n\"Do so.\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"And if you should hear of anything very scandalous\"--\n\n\"I will communicate it to you.\"\n\n\"You will oblige me.\" Danglars rushed out of the room, and made but one\nleap into his coupe.\n\n\n\nChapter 67. At the Office of the King's Attorney.\n\nLet us leave the banker driving his horses at their fullest speed, and\nfollow Madame Danglars in her morning excursion. We have said that at\nhalf-past twelve o'clock Madame Danglars had ordered her horses, and had\nleft home in the carriage. She directed her course towards the Faubourg\nSaint Germain, went down the Rue Mazarine, and stopped at the Passage\ndu Pont-Neuf. She descended, and went through the passage. She was very\nplainly dressed, as would be the case with a woman of taste walking in\nthe morning. At the Rue Guenegaud she called a cab, and directed the\ndriver to go to the Rue de Harlay. As soon as she was seated in the\nvehicle, she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil, which she\ntied on to her straw bonnet. She then replaced the bonnet, and saw\nwith pleasure, in a little pocket-mirror, that her white complexion and\nbrilliant eyes were alone visible. The cab crossed the Pont-Neuf and\nentered the Rue de Harlay by the Place Dauphine; the driver was paid as\nthe door opened, and stepping lightly up the stairs Madame Danglars soon\nreached the Salle des Pas-Perdus.\n\nThere was a great deal going on that morning, and many business-like\npersons at the Palais; business-like persons pay very little attention\nto women, and Madame Danglars crossed the hall without exciting any\nmore attention than any other woman calling upon her lawyer. There was\na great press of people in M. de Villefort's ante-chamber, but Madame\nDanglars had no occasion even to pronounce her name. The instant she\nappeared the door-keeper rose, came to her, and asked her whether she\nwas not the person with whom the procureur had made an appointment; and\non her affirmative answer being given, he conducted her by a private\npassage to M. de Villefort's office. The magistrate was seated in an\narm-chair, writing, with his back towards the door; he did not move as\nhe heard it open, and the door-keeper pronounce the words, \"Walk in,\nmadame,\" and then reclose it; but no sooner had the man's footsteps\nceased, than he started up, drew the bolts, closed the curtains, and\nexamined every corner of the room. Then, when he had assured himself\nthat he could neither be seen nor heard, and was consequently relieved\nof doubts, he said,--\"Thanks, madame,--thanks for your punctuality;\" and\nhe offered a chair to Madame Danglars, which she accepted, for her heart\nbeat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated.\n\n\"It is a long time, madame,\" said the procureur, describing a\nhalf-circle with his chair, so as to place himself exactly opposite\nto Madame Danglars,--\"it is a long time since I had the pleasure of\nspeaking alone with you, and I regret that we have only now met to enter\nupon a painful conversation.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, sir, you see I have answered your first appeal, although\ncertainly the conversation must be much more painful for me than for\nyou.\" Villefort smiled bitterly.\n\n\"It is true, then,\" he said, rather uttering his thoughts aloud than\naddressing his companion,--\"it is true, then, that all our actions leave\ntheir traces--some sad, others bright--on our paths; it is true\nthat every step in our lives is like the course of an insect on the\nsands;--it leaves its track! Alas, to many the path is traced by tears.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Madame Danglars, \"you can feel for my emotion, can you not?\nSpare me, then, I beseech you. When I look at this room,--whence so many\nguilty creatures have departed, trembling and ashamed, when I look\nat that chair before which I now sit trembling and ashamed,--oh, it\nrequires all my reason to convince me that I am not a very guilty woman\nand you a menacing judge.\" Villefort dropped his head and sighed. \"And\nI,\" he said, \"I feel that my place is not in the judge's seat, but on\nthe prisoner's stool.\"\n\n\"You?\" said Madame Danglars.\n\n\"Yes, I.\"\n\n\"I think, sir, you exaggerate your situation,\" said Madame Danglars,\nwhose beautiful eyes sparkled for a moment. \"The paths of which you were\njust speaking have been traced by all young men of ardent imaginations.\nBesides the pleasure, there is always remorse from the indulgence of our\npassions, and, after all, what have you men to fear from all this? the\nworld excuses, and notoriety ennobles you.\"\n\n\"Madame,\" replied Villefort, \"you know that I am no hypocrite, or, at\nleast, that I never deceive without a reason. If my brow be severe, it\nis because many misfortunes have clouded it; if my heart be petrified,\nit is that it might sustain the blows it has received. I was not so in\nmy youth, I was not so on the night of the betrothal, when we were all\nseated around a table in the Rue du Cours at Marseilles. But since\nthen everything has changed in and about me; I am accustomed to brave\ndifficulties, and, in the conflict to crush those who, by their own free\nwill, or by chance, voluntarily or involuntarily, interfere with me in\nmy career. It is generally the case that what we most ardently desire\nis as ardently withheld from us by those who wish to obtain it, or from\nwhom we attempt to snatch it. Thus, the greater number of a man's errors\ncome before him disguised under the specious form of necessity; then,\nafter error has been committed in a moment of excitement, of delirium,\nor of fear, we see that we might have avoided and escaped it. The means\nwe might have used, which we in our blindness could not see, then seem\nsimple and easy, and we say, 'Why did I not do this, instead of that?'\nWomen, on the contrary, are rarely tormented with remorse; for the\ndecision does not come from you,--your misfortunes are generally imposed\nupon you, and your faults the results of others' crimes.\"\n\n\"In any case, sir, you will allow,\" replied Madame Danglars, \"that, even\nif the fault were alone mine, I last night received a severe punishment\nfor it.\"\n\n\"Poor thing,\" said Villefort, pressing her hand, \"it was too severe for\nyour strength, for you were twice overwhelmed, and yet\"--\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, I must tell you. Collect all your courage, for you have not yet\nheard all.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" exclaimed Madame Danglars, alarmed, \"what is there more to hear?\"\n\n\"You only look back to the past, and it is, indeed, bad enough. Well,\npicture to yourself a future more gloomy still--certainly frightful,\nperhaps sanguinary.\" The baroness knew how calm Villefort naturally was,\nand his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened\nher mouth to scream, but the sound died in her throat. \"How has this\nterrible past been recalled?\" cried Villefort; \"how is it that it has\nescaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our hearts,\nwhere it was buried, to visit us now, like a phantom, whitening our\ncheeks and flushing our brows with shame?\"\n\n\"Alas,\" said Hermine, \"doubtless it is chance.\"\n\n\"Chance?\" replied Villefort; \"No, no, madame, there is no such thing as\nchance.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; has not a fatal chance revealed all this? Was it not by chance\nthe Count of Monte Cristo bought that house? Was it not by chance he\ncaused the earth to be dug up? Is it not by chance that the unfortunate\nchild was disinterred under the trees?--that poor innocent offspring of\nmine, which I never even kissed, but for whom I wept many, many tears.\nAh, my heart clung to the count when he mentioned the dear spoil found\nbeneath the flowers.\"\n\n\"Well, no, madame,--this is the terrible news I have to tell you,\" said\nVillefort in a hollow voice--\"no, nothing was found beneath the flowers;\nthere was no child disinterred--no. You must not weep, no, you must not\ngroan, you must tremble!\"\n\n\"What can you mean?\" asked Madame Danglars, shuddering.\n\n\"I mean that M. de Monte Cristo, digging underneath these trees, found\nneither skeleton nor chest, because neither of them was there!\"\n\n\"Neither of them there?\" repeated Madame Danglars, her staring,\nwide-open eyes expressing her alarm.\n\n\"Neither of them there!\" she again said, as though striving to impress\nherself with the meaning of the words which escaped her.\n\n\"No,\" said Villefort, burying his face in his hands, \"no, a hundred\ntimes no!\"\n\n\"Then you did not bury the poor child there, sir? Why did you deceive\nme? Where did you place it? tell me--where?\"\n\n\"There! But listen to me--listen--and you will pity me who has for\ntwenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief I am about to reveal,\nwithout casting the least portion upon you.\"\n\n\"Oh, you frighten me! But speak; I will listen.\"\n\n\"You recollect that sad night, when you were half-expiring on that\nbed in the red damask room, while I, scarcely less agitated than you,\nawaited your delivery. The child was born, was given to me--motionless,\nbreathless, voiceless; we thought it dead.\" Madame Danglars moved\nrapidly, as though she would spring from her chair, but Villefort\nstopped, and clasped his hands as if to implore her attention. \"We\nthought it dead,\" he repeated; \"I placed it in the chest, which was to\ntake the place of a coffin; I descended to the garden, I dug a hole, and\nthen flung it down in haste. Scarcely had I covered it with earth, when\nthe arm of the Corsican was stretched towards me; I saw a shadow rise,\nand, at the same time, a flash of light. I felt pain; I wished to cry\nout, but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my voice; I fell\nlifeless, and fancied myself killed. Never shall I forget your sublime\ncourage, when, having returned to consciousness, I dragged myself to the\nfoot of the stairs, and you, almost dying yourself, came to meet me. We\nwere obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe. You had the\nfortitude to regain the house, assisted by your nurse. A duel was\nthe pretext for my wound. Though we scarcely expected it, our secret\nremained in our own keeping alone. I was taken to Versailles; for three\nmonths I struggled with death; at last, as I seemed to cling to life,\nI was ordered to the South. Four men carried me from Paris to Chalons,\nwalking six leagues a day; Madame de Villefort followed the litter in\nher carriage. At Chalons I was put upon the Saone, thence I passed on\nto the Rhone, whence I descended, merely with the current, to Arles;\nat Arles I was again placed on my litter, and continued my journey to\nMarseilles. My recovery lasted six months. I never heard you mentioned,\nand I did not dare inquire for you. When I returned to Paris, I learned\nthat you, the widow of M. de Nargonne, had married M. Danglars.\n\n\"What was the subject of my thoughts from the time consciousness\nreturned to me? Always the same--always the child's corpse, coming every\nnight in my dreams, rising from the earth, and hovering over the grave\nwith menacing look and gesture. I inquired immediately on my return to\nParis; the house had not been inhabited since we left it, but it had\njust been let for nine years. I found the tenant. I pretended that I\ndisliked the idea that a house belonging to my wife's father and mother\nshould pass into the hands of strangers. I offered to pay them for\ncancelling the lease; they demanded 6,000 francs. I would have given\n10,000--I would have given 20,000. I had the money with me; I made the\ntenant sign the deed of resilition, and when I had obtained what I so\nmuch wanted, I galloped to Auteuil.\n\n\"No one had entered the house since I had left it. It was five o'clock\nin the afternoon; I ascended into the red room, and waited for night.\nThere all the thoughts which had disturbed me during my year of constant\nagony came back with double force. The Corsican, who had declared the\nvendetta against me, who had followed me from Nimes to Paris, who had\nhid himself in the garden, who had struck me, had seen me dig the grave,\nhad seen me inter the child,--he might become acquainted with your\nperson,--nay, he might even then have known it. Would he not one day\nmake you pay for keeping this terrible secret? Would it not be a sweet\nrevenge for him when he found that I had not died from the blow of his\ndagger? It was therefore necessary, before everything else, and at all\nrisks, that I should cause all traces of the past to disappear--that\nI should destroy every material vestige; too much reality would always\nremain in my recollection. It was for this I had annulled the lease--it\nwas for this I had come--it was for this I was waiting. Night arrived;\nI allowed it to become quite dark. I was without a light in that room;\nwhen the wind shook all the doors, behind which I continually expected\nto see some spy concealed, I trembled. I seemed everywhere to hear your\nmoans behind me in the bed, and I dared not turn around. My heart beat\nso violently that I feared my wound would open. At length, one by one,\nall the noises in the neighborhood ceased. I understood that I had\nnothing to fear, that I should neither be seen nor heard, so I decided\nupon descending to the garden.\n\n\"Listen, Hermine; I consider myself as brave as most men, but when I\ndrew from my breast the little key of the staircase, which I had found\nin my coat--that little key we both used to cherish so much, which you\nwished to have fastened to a golden ring--when I opened the door, and\nsaw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white light on the spiral\nstaircase like a spectre, I leaned against the wall, and nearly\nshrieked. I seemed to be going mad. At last I mastered my agitation. I\ndescended the staircase step by step; the only thing I could not conquer\nwas a strange trembling in my knees. I grasped the railings; if I had\nrelaxed my hold for a moment, I should have fallen. I reached the lower\ndoor. Outside this door a spade was placed against the wall; I took\nit, and advanced towards the thicket. I had provided myself with a\ndark lantern. In the middle of the lawn I stopped to light it, then I\ncontinued my path.\n\n\"It was the end of November, all the verdure of the garden had\ndisappeared, the trees were nothing more than skeletons with their long\nbony arms, and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my feet. My\nterror overcame me to such a degree as I approached the thicket, that\nI took a pistol from my pocket and armed myself. I fancied continually\nthat I saw the figure of the Corsican between the branches. I examined\nthe thicket with my dark lantern; it was empty. I looked carefully\naround; I was indeed alone,--no noise disturbed the silence but the owl,\nwhose piercing cry seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the night.\nI tied my lantern to a forked branch I had noticed a year before at the\nprecise spot where I stopped to dig the hole.\n\n\"The grass had grown very thickly there during the summer, and when\nautumn arrived no one had been there to mow it. Still one place where\nthe grass was thin attracted my attention; it evidently was there I had\nturned up the ground. I went to work. The hour, then, for which I had\nbeen waiting during the last year had at length arrived. How I worked,\nhow I hoped, how I struck every piece of turf, thinking to find some\nresistance to my spade! But no, I found nothing, though I had made a\nhole twice as large as the first. I thought I had been deceived--had\nmistaken the spot. I turned around, I looked at the trees, I tried to\nrecall the details which had struck me at the time. A cold, sharp wind\nwhistled through the leafless branches, and yet the drops fell from my\nforehead. I recollected that I was stabbed just as I was trampling\nthe ground to fill up the hole; while doing so I had leaned against a\nlaburnum; behind me was an artificial rockery, intended to serve as a\nresting-place for persons walking in the garden; in falling, my hand,\nrelaxing its hold of the laburnum, felt the coldness of the stone. On my\nright I saw the tree, behind me the rock. I stood in the same attitude,\nand threw myself down. I rose, and again began digging and enlarging the\nhole; still I found nothing, nothing--the chest was no longer there!\"\n\n\"The chest no longer there?\" murmured Madame Danglars, choking with\nfear.\n\n\"Think not I contented myself with this one effort,\" continued\nVillefort. \"No; I searched the whole thicket. I thought the assassin,\nhaving discovered the chest, and supposing it to be a treasure, had\nintended carrying it off, but, perceiving his error, had dug another\nhole, and deposited it there; but I could find nothing. Then the idea\nstruck me that he had not taken these precautions, and had simply thrown\nit in a corner. In the last case I must wait for daylight to renew my\nsearch. I remained in the room and waited.\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens!\"\n\nWhen daylight dawned I went down again. My first visit was to the\nthicket. I hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the\ndarkness. I had turned up the earth over a surface of more than twenty\nfeet square, and a depth of two feet. A laborer would not have done in\na day what occupied me an hour. But I could find nothing--absolutely\nnothing. Then I renewed the search. Supposing it had been thrown aside,\nit would probably be on the path which led to the little gate; but this\nexamination was as useless as the first, and with a bursting heart I\nreturned to the thicket, which now contained no hope for me.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" cried Madame Danglars, \"it was enough to drive you mad!\"\n\n\"I hoped for a moment that it might,\" said Villefort; \"but that\nhappiness was denied me. However, recovering my strength and my ideas,\n'Why,' said I, 'should that man have carried away the corpse?'\"\n\n\"But you said,\" replied Madame Danglars, \"he would require it as a\nproof.\"\n\n\"Ah, no, madame, that could not be. Dead bodies are not kept a year;\nthey are shown to a magistrate, and the evidence is taken. Now, nothing\nof the kind has happened.\"\n\n\"What then?\" asked Hermine, trembling violently.\n\n\"Something more terrible, more fatal, more alarming for us--the child\nwas, perhaps, alive, and the assassin may have saved it!\"\n\nMadame Danglars uttered a piercing cry, and, seizing Villefort's hands,\nexclaimed, \"My child was alive?\" said she; \"you buried my child alive?\nYou were not certain my child was dead, and you buried it? Ah\"--\n\nMadame Danglars had risen, and stood before the procureur, whose hands\nshe wrung in her feeble grasp. \"I know not; I merely suppose so, as I\nmight suppose anything else,\" replied Villefort with a look so fixed,\nit indicated that his powerful mind was on the verge of despair and\nmadness. \"Ah, my child, my poor child!\" cried the baroness, falling\non her chair, and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief. Villefort,\nbecoming somewhat reassured, perceived that to avert the maternal storm\ngathering over his head, he must inspire Madame Danglars with the terror\nhe felt. \"You understand, then, that if it were so,\" said he, rising in\nhis turn, and approaching the baroness, to speak to her in a lower tone,\n\"we are lost. This child lives, and some one knows it lives--some one is\nin possession of our secret; and since Monte Cristo speaks before us of\na child disinterred, when that child could not be found, it is he who is\nin possession of our secret.\"\n\n\"Just God, avenging God!\" murmured Madame Danglars.\n\nVillefort's only answer was a stifled groan.\n\n\"But the child--the child, sir?\" repeated the agitated mother.\n\n\"How I have searched for him,\" replied Villefort, wringing his hands;\n\"how I have called him in my long sleepless nights; how I have longed\nfor royal wealth to purchase a million of secrets from a million of men,\nand to find mine among them! At last, one day, when for the hundredth\ntime I took up my spade, I asked myself again and again what the\nCorsican could have done with the child. A child encumbers a fugitive;\nperhaps, on perceiving it was still alive, he had thrown it into the\nriver.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried Madame Danglars: \"a man may murder another out of\nrevenge, but he would not deliberately drown a child.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" continued Villefort, \"he had put it in the foundling\nhospital.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes,\" cried the baroness; \"my child is there!\"\n\n\"I ran to the hospital, and learned that the same night--the night of\nthe 20th of September--a child had been brought there, wrapped in part\nof a fine linen napkin, purposely torn in half. This portion of the\nnapkin was marked with half a baron's crown, and the letter H.\"\n\n\"Truly, truly,\" said Madame Danglars, \"all my linen is marked thus;\nMonsieur de Nargonne was a baronet, and my name is Hermine. Thank God,\nmy child was not then dead!\"\n\n\"No, it was not dead.\"\n\n\"And you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of joy? Where is\nthe child?\" Villefort shrugged his shoulders. \"Do I know?\" said he; \"and\ndo you believe that if I knew I would relate to you all its trials and\nall its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer? Alas, no,\nI know not. A woman, about six months after, came to claim it with the\nother half of the napkin. This woman gave all the requisite particulars,\nand it was intrusted to her.\"\n\n\"But you should have inquired for the woman; you should have traced\nher.\"\n\n\"And what do you think I did? I feigned a criminal process, and employed\nall the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her. They\ntraced her to Chalons, and there they lost her.\"\n\n\"They lost her?\"\n\n\"Yes, forever.\" Madame Danglars had listened to this recital with a\nsigh, a tear, or a shriek for every detail. \"And this is all?\" said she;\n\"and you stopped there?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Villefort; \"I never ceased to search and to inquire.\nHowever, the last two or three years I had allowed myself some respite.\nBut now I will begin with more perseverance and fury than ever, since\nfear urges me, not my conscience.\"\n\n\"But,\" replied Madame Danglars, \"the Count of Monte Cristo can know\nnothing, or he would not seek our society as he does.\"\n\n\"Oh, the wickedness of man is very great,\" said Villefort, \"since it\nsurpasses the goodness of God. Did you observe that man's eyes while he\nwas speaking to us?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But have you ever watched him carefully?\"\n\n\"Doubtless he is capricious, but that is all; one thing alone struck\nme,--of all the exquisite things he placed before us, he touched\nnothing. I might have suspected he was poisoning us.\"\n\n\"And you see you would have been deceived.\"\n\n\"Yes, doubtless.\"\n\n\"But believe me, that man has other projects. For that reason I\nwished to see you, to speak to you, to warn you against every one, but\nespecially against him. Tell me,\" cried Villefort, fixing his eyes more\nsteadfastly on her than he had ever done before, \"did you ever reveal to\nany one our connection?\"\n\n\"Never, to any one.\"\n\n\"You understand me,\" replied Villefort, affectionately; \"when I say any\none,--pardon my urgency,--to any one living I mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I understand very well,\" ejaculated the baroness; \"never, I\nswear to you.\"\n\n\"Were you ever in the habit of writing in the evening what had\ntranspired in the morning? Do you keep a journal?\"\n\n\"No, my life has been passed in frivolity; I wish to forget it myself.\"\n\n\"Do you talk in your sleep?\"\n\n\"I sleep soundly, like a child; do you not remember?\" The color mounted\nto the baroness's face, and Villefort turned awfully pale.\n\n\"It is true,\" said he, in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard.\n\n\"Well?\" said the baroness.\n\n\"Well, I understand what I now have to do,\" replied Villefort. \"In\nless than one week from this time I will ascertain who this M. de Monte\nCristo is, whence he comes, where he goes, and why he speaks in our\npresence of children that have been disinterred in a garden.\" Villefort\npronounced these words with an accent which would have made the\ncount shudder had he heard him. Then he pressed the hand the baroness\nreluctantly gave him, and led her respectfully back to the door. Madame\nDanglars returned in another cab to the passage, on the other side of\nwhich she found her carriage, and her coachman sleeping peacefully on\nhis box while waiting for her.\n\n\n\nChapter 68. A Summer Ball.\n\nThe same day during the interview between Madame Danglars and the\nprocureur, a travelling-carriage entered the Rue du Helder, passed\nthrough the gateway of No. 27, and stopped in the yard. In a moment the\ndoor was opened, and Madame de Morcerf alighted, leaning on her son's\narm. Albert soon left her, ordered his horses, and having arranged his\ntoilet, drove to the Champs Elysees, to the house of Monte Cristo. The\ncount received him with his habitual smile. It was a strange thing that\nno one ever appeared to advance a step in that man's favor. Those who\nwould, as it were, force a passage to his heart, found an impassable\nbarrier. Morcerf, who ran towards him with open arms, was chilled as he\ndrew near, in spite of the friendly smile, and simply held out his hand.\nMonte Cristo shook it coldly, according to his invariable practice.\n\"Here I am, dear count.\"\n\n\"Welcome home again.\"\n\n\"I arrived an hour since.\"\n\n\"From Dieppe?\"\n\n\"No, from Treport.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"And I have come at once to see you.\"\n\n\"That is extremely kind of you,\" said Monte Cristo with a tone of\nperfect indifference.\n\n\"And what is the news?\"\n\n\"You should not ask a stranger, a foreigner, for news.\"\n\n\"I know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything for\nme?\"\n\n\"Had you commissioned me?\" said Monte Cristo, feigning uneasiness.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said Albert, \"do not assume so much indifference. It is\nsaid, sympathy travels rapidly, and when at Treport, I felt the electric\nshock; you have either been working for me or thinking of me.\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" said Monte Cristo, \"I have indeed thought of you, but the\nmagnetic wire I was guiding acted, indeed, without my knowledge.\"\n\n\"Indeed? Pray tell me how it happened?\"\n\n\"Willingly. M. Danglars dined with me.\"\n\n\"I know it; to avoid meeting him, my mother and I left town.\"\n\n\"But he met here M. Andrea Cavalcanti.\"\n\n\"Your Italian prince?\"\n\n\"Not so fast; M. Andrea only calls himself count.\"\n\n\"Calls himself, do you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, calls himself.\"\n\n\"Is he not a count?\"\n\n\"What can I know of him? He calls himself so. I, of course, give him the\nsame title, and every one else does likewise.\"\n\n\"What a strange man you are! What next? You say M. Danglars dined here?\"\n\n\"Yes, with Count Cavalcanti, the marquis his father, Madame Danglars,\nM. and Madame de Villefort,--charming people,--M. Debray, Maximilian\nMorrel, and M. de Chateau-Renaud.\"\n\n\"Did they speak of me?\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"So much the worse.\"\n\n\"Why so? I thought you wished them to forget you?\"\n\n\"If they did not speak of me, I am sure they thought about me, and I am\nin despair.\"\n\n\"How will that affect you, since Mademoiselle Danglars was not among the\nnumber here who thought of you? Truly, she might have thought of you at\nhome.\"\n\n\"I have no fear of that; or, if she did, it was only in the same way in\nwhich I think of her.\"\n\n\"Touching sympathy! So you hate each other?\" said the count.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Morcerf--\"if Mademoiselle Danglars were disposed to take\npity on my supposed martyrdom on her account, and would dispense with\nall matrimonial formalities between our two families, I am ready to\nagree to the arrangement. In a word, Mademoiselle Danglars would make a\ncharming mistress--but a wife--diable!\"\n\n\"And this,\" said Monte Cristo, \"is your opinion of your intended\nspouse?\"\n\n\"Yes; it is rather unkind, I acknowledge, but it is true. But as this\ndream cannot be realized, since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my\nlawful wife, live perpetually with me, sing to me, compose verses and\nmusic within ten paces of me, and that for my whole life, it frightens\nme. One may forsake a mistress, but a wife,--good heavens! There she\nmust always be; and to marry Mademoiselle Danglars would be awful.\"\n\n\"You are difficult to please, viscount.\"\n\n\"Yes, for I often wish for what is impossible.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"To find such a wife as my father found.\" Monte Cristo turned pale, and\nlooked at Albert, while playing with some magnificent pistols.\n\n\"Your father was fortunate, then?\" said he.\n\n\"You know my opinion of my mother, count; look at her,--still beautiful,\nwitty, more charming than ever. For any other son to have stayed with\nhis mother for four days at Treport, it would have been a condescension\nor a martyrdom, while I return, more contented, more peaceful--shall\nI say more poetic!--than if I had taken Queen Mab or Titania as my\ncompanion.\"\n\n\"That is an overwhelming demonstration, and you would make every one vow\nto live a single life.\"\n\n\"Such are my reasons for not liking to marry Mademoiselle Danglars. Have\nyou ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we obtain\npossession of it? The diamond which glittered in the window at Marle's\nor Fossin's shines with more splendor when it is our own; but if we\nare compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another, and still\nmust retain the one that is inferior, do you not know what we have to\nendure?\"\n\n\"Worldling,\" murmured the count.\n\n\"Thus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle Eugenie perceives I am but a\npitiful atom, with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has\nmillions.\" Monte Cristo smiled. \"One plan occurred to me,\" continued\nAlbert; \"Franz likes all that is eccentric; I tried to make him fall in\nlove with Mademoiselle Danglars; but in spite of four letters, written\nin the most alluring style, he invariably answered: 'My eccentricity may\nbe great, but it will not make me break my promise.'\"\n\n\"That is what I call devoted friendship, to recommend to another one\nwhom you would not marry yourself.\" Albert smiled.--\"Apropos,\" continued\nhe, \"Franz is coming soon, but it will not interest you; you dislike\nhim, I think?\"\n\n\"I?\" said Monte Cristo; \"my dear Viscount, how have you discovered that\nI did not like M. Franz! I like every one.\"\n\n\"And you include me in the expression every one--many thanks!\"\n\n\"Let us not mistake,\" said Monte Cristo; \"I love every one as God\ncommands us to love our neighbor, as Christians; but I thoroughly\nhate but a few. Let us return to M. Franz d'Epinay. Did you say he was\ncoming?\"\n\n\"Yes; summoned by M. de Villefort, who is apparently as anxious to get\nMademoiselle Valentine married as M. Danglars is to see Mademoiselle\nEugenie settled. It must be a very irksome office to be the father of\na grown-up daughter; it seems to make one feverish, and to raise one's\npulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done.\"\n\n\"But M. d'Epinay, unlike you, bears his misfortune patiently.\"\n\n\"Still more, he talks seriously about the matter, puts on a white tie,\nand speaks of his family. He entertains a very high opinion of M. and\nMadame de Villefort.\"\n\n\"Which they deserve, do they not?\"\n\n\"I believe they do. M. de Villefort has always passed for a severe but a\njust man.\"\n\n\"There is, then, one,\" said Monte Cristo, \"whom you do not condemn like\npoor Danglars?\"\n\n\"Because I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps,\" replied\nAlbert, laughing.\n\n\"Indeed, my dear sir,\" said Monte Cristo, \"you are revoltingly foppish.\"\n\n\"I foppish? how do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes; pray take a cigar, and cease to defend yourself, and to struggle\nto escape marrying Mademoiselle Danglars. Let things take their course;\nperhaps you may not have to retract.\"\n\n\"Bah,\" said Albert, staring.\n\n\"Doubtless, my dear viscount, you will not be taken by force; and\nseriously, do you wish to break off your engagement?\"\n\n\"I would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so.\"\n\n\"Then make yourself quite easy. M. Danglars would give double that sum\nto attain the same end.\"\n\n\"Am I, indeed, so happy?\" said Albert, who still could not prevent an\nalmost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow. \"But, my dear count,\nhas M. Danglars any reason?\"\n\n\"Ah, there is your proud and selfish nature. You would expose the\nself-love of another with a hatchet, but you shrink if your own is\nattacked with a needle.\"\n\n\"But yet M. Danglars appeared\"--\n\n\"Delighted with you, was he not? Well, he is a man of bad taste, and is\nstill more enchanted with another. I know not whom; look and judge for\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Thank you, I understand. But my mother--no, not my mother; I\nmistake--my father intends giving a ball.\"\n\n\"A ball at this season?\"\n\n\"Summer balls are fashionable.\"\n\n\"If they were not, the countess has only to wish it, and they would\nbecome so.\"\n\n\"You are right; You know they are select affairs; those who remain\nin Paris in July must be true Parisians. Will you take charge of our\ninvitation to Messieurs Cavalcanti?\"\n\n\"When will it take place?\"\n\n\"On Saturday.\"\n\n\"M. Cavalcanti's father will be gone.\"\n\n\"But the son will be here; will you invite young M. Cavalcanti?\"\n\n\"I do not know him, viscount.\"\n\n\"You do not know him?\"\n\n\"No, I never saw him until a few days since, and am not responsible for\nhim.\"\n\n\"But you receive him at your house?\"\n\n\"That is another thing: he was recommended to me by a good abbe, who may\nbe deceived. Give him a direct invitation, but do not ask me to present\nhim. If he were afterwards to marry Mademoiselle Danglars, you would\naccuse me of intrigue, and would be challenging me,--besides, I may not\nbe there myself.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"At your ball.\"\n\n\"Why should you not be there?\"\n\n\"Because you have not yet invited me.\"\n\n\"But I come expressly for that purpose.\"\n\n\"You are very kind, but I may be prevented.\"\n\n\"If I tell you one thing, you will be so amiable as to set aside all\nimpediments.\"\n\n\"Tell me what it is.\"\n\n\"My mother begs you to come.\"\n\n\"The Comtesse de Morcerf?\" said Monte Cristo, starting.\n\n\"Ah, count,\" said Albert, \"I assure you Madame de Morcerf speaks freely\nto me, and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which I\nspoke just now thrill within you, you must be entirely devoid of them,\nfor during the last four days we have spoken of no one else.\"\n\n\"You have talked of me?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is the penalty of being a living puzzle!\"\n\n\"Then I am also a puzzle to your mother? I should have thought her too\nreasonable to be led by imagination.\"\n\n\"A problem, my dear count, for every one--for my mother as well as\nothers; much studied, but not solved, you still remain an enigma, do not\nfear. My mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved. I\nbelieve, while the Countess G---- takes you for Lord Ruthven, my mother\nimagines you to be Cagliostro or the Count Saint-Germain. The first\nopportunity you have, confirm her in her opinion; it will be easy for\nyou, as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other.\"\n\n\"I thank you for the warning,\" said the count; \"I shall endeavor to be\nprepared for all suppositions.\"\n\n\"You will, then, come on Saturday?\"\n\n\"Yes, since Madame de Morcerf invites me.\"\n\n\"You are very kind.\"\n\n\"Will M. Danglars be there?\"\n\n\"He has already been invited by my father. We shall try to persuade the\ngreat d'Aguesseau, [*] M. de Villefort, to come, but have not much hope of\nseeing him.\"\n\n\"'Never despair of anything,' says the proverb.\"\n\n     * Magistrate and orator of great eloquence--chancellor of\n     France under Louis XV.\n\n\"Do you dance, count?\"\n\n\"I dance?\"\n\n\"Yes, you; it would not be astonishing.\"\n\n\"That is very well before one is over forty. No, I do not dance, but I\nlike to see others do so. Does Madame de Morcerf dance?\"\n\n\"Never; you can talk to her, she so delights in your conversation.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"Yes, truly; and I assure you. You are the only man of whom I have\nheard her speak with interest.\" Albert rose and took his hat; the count\nconducted him to the door. \"I have one thing to reproach myself with,\"\nsaid he, stopping Albert on the steps. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"I have spoken to you indiscreetly about Danglars.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, speak to me always in the same strain about him.\"\n\n\"I am glad to be reassured on that point. Apropos, when do you aspect M.\nd'Epinay?\"\n\n\"Five or six days hence at the latest.\"\n\n\"And when is he to be married?\"\n\n\"Immediately on the arrival of M. and Madame de Saint-Meran.\"\n\n\"Bring him to see me. Although you say I do not like him, I assure you I\nshall be happy to see him.\"\n\n\"I will obey your orders, my lord.\"\n\n\"Good-by.\"\n\n\"Until Saturday, when I may expect you, may I not?\"\n\n\"Yes, I promised you.\" The Count watched Albert, waving his hand to\nhim. When he had mounted his phaeton, Monte Cristo turned, and seeing\nBertuccio, \"What news?\" said he. \"She went to the Palais,\" replied the\nsteward.\n\n\"Did she stay long there?\"\n\n\"An hour and a half.\"\n\n\"Did she return home?\"\n\n\"Directly.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear Bertuccio,\" said the count, \"I now advise you to go in\nquest of the little estate I spoke to you of in Normandy.\" Bertuccio\nbowed, and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order he had\nreceived, he started the same evening.\n\n\n\nChapter 69. The Inquiry.\n\nM. de Villefort kept the promise he had made to Madame Danglars, to\nendeavor to find out how the Count of Monte Cristo had discovered the\nhistory of the house at Auteuil. He wrote the same day for the required\ninformation to M. de Boville, who, from having been an inspector of\nprisons, was promoted to a high office in the police; and the latter\nbegged for two days time to ascertain exactly who would be most likely\nto give him full particulars. At the end of the second day M. de\nVillefort received the following note:--\n\n\"The person called the Count of Monte Cristo is an intimate acquaintance\nof Lord Wilmore, a rich foreigner, who is sometimes seen in Paris and\nwho is there at this moment; he is also known to the Abbe Busoni, a\nSicilian priest, of high repute in the East, where he has done much\ngood.\"\n\nM. de Villefort replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be\nmade respecting these two persons; his orders were executed, and the\nfollowing evening he received these details:--\n\n\"The abbe, who was in Paris only for a month, inhabited a small\ntwo-storied house behind Saint-Sulpice; there were two rooms on each\nfloor and he was the only tenant. The two lower rooms consisted of a\ndining-room, with a table, chairs, and side-board of walnut,--and a\nwainscoted parlor, without ornaments, carpet, or timepiece. It was\nevident that the abbe limited himself to objects of strict necessity. He\npreferred to use the sitting-room upstairs, which was more library than\nparlor, and was furnished with theological books and parchments, in\nwhich he delighted to bury himself for months at a time, according to\nhis valet de chambre. His valet looked at the visitors through a sort\nof wicket; and if their faces were unknown to him or displeased him, he\nreplied that the abbe was not in Paris, an answer which satisfied most\npersons, because the abbe was known to be a great traveller. Besides,\nwhether at home or not, whether in Paris or Cairo, the abbe always left\nsomething to give away, which the valet distributed through this wicket\nin his master's name. The other room near the library was a bedroom. A\nbed without curtains, four arm-chairs, and a couch, covered with yellow\nUtrecht velvet, composed, with a prie-Dieu, all its furniture. Lord\nWilmore resided in Rue Fontaine-Saint-George. He was one of those\nEnglish tourists who consume a large fortune in travelling. He hired the\napartment in which he lived furnished, passed only a few hours in the\nday there, and rarely slept there. One of his peculiarities was never to\nspeak a word of French, which he however wrote with great facility.\"\n\nThe day after this important information had been given to the king's\nattorney, a man alighted from a carriage at the corner of the Rue\nFerou, and rapping at an olive-green door, asked if the Abbe Busoni were\nwithin. \"No, he went out early this morning,\" replied the valet.\n\n\"I might not always be content with that answer,\" replied the visitor,\n\"for I come from one to whom everyone must be at home. But have the\nkindness to give the Abbe Busoni\"--\n\n\"I told you he was not at home,\" repeated the valet. \"Then on his return\ngive him that card and this sealed paper. Will he be at home at eight\no'clock this evening?\"\n\n\"Doubtless, unless he is at work, which is the same as if he were out.\"\n\n\"I will come again at that time,\" replied the visitor, who then retired.\n\nAt the appointed hour the same man returned in the same carriage, which,\ninstead of stopping this time at the end of the Rue Ferou, drove up to\nthe green door. He knocked, and it opened immediately to admit him.\nFrom the signs of respect the valet paid him, he saw that his note had\nproduced a good effect. \"Is the abbe at home?\" asked he.\n\n\"Yes; he is at work in his library, but he expects you, sir,\" replied\nthe valet. The stranger ascended a rough staircase, and before a table,\nillumined by a lamp whose light was concentrated by a large shade while\nthe rest of the apartment was in partial darkness, he perceived the abbe\nin a monk's dress, with a cowl on his head such as was used by learned\nmen of the Middle Ages. \"Have I the honor of addressing the Abbe\nBusoni?\" asked the visitor.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the abbe; \"and you are the person whom M. de\nBoville, formerly an inspector of prisons, sends to me from the prefect\nof police?\"\n\n\"Exactly, sir.\"\n\n\"One of the agents appointed to secure the safety of Paris?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir\" replied the stranger with a slight hesitation, and blushing.\n\nThe abbe replaced the large spectacles, which covered not only his eyes\nbut his temples, and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the\nsame. \"I am at your service, sir,\" said the abbe, with a marked Italian\naccent.\n\n\"The mission with which I am charged, sir,\" replied the visitor,\nspeaking with hesitation, \"is a confidential one on the part of him\nwho fulfils it, and him by whom he is employed.\" The abbe bowed. \"Your\nprobity,\" replied the stranger, \"is so well known to the prefect that he\nwishes as a magistrate to ascertain from you some particulars connected\nwith the public safety, to ascertain which I am deputed to see you. It\nis hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration will induce\nyou to conceal the truth.\"\n\n\"Provided, sir, the particulars you wish for do not interfere with\nmy scruples or my conscience. I am a priest, sir, and the secrets\nof confession, for instance, must remain between me and God, and not\nbetween me and human justice.\"\n\n\"Do not alarm yourself, monsieur, we will duly respect your conscience.\"\n\nAt this moment the abbe pressed down his side of the shade and so raised\nit on the other, throwing a bright light on the stranger's face, while\nhis own remained obscured. \"Excuse me, abbe,\" said the envoy of the\nprefect of the police, \"but the light tries my eyes very much.\" The abbe\nlowered the shade. \"Now, sir, I am listening--go on.\"\n\n\"I will come at once to the point. Do you know the Count of Monte\nCristo?\"\n\n\"You mean Monsieur Zaccone, I presume?\"\n\n\"Zaccone?--is not his name Monte Cristo?\"\n\n\"Monte Cristo is the name of an estate, or, rather, of a rock, and not a\nfamily name.\"\n\n\"Well, be it so--let us not dispute about words; and since M. de Monte\nCristo and M. Zaccone are the same\"--\n\n\"Absolutely the same.\"\n\n\"Let us speak of M. Zaccone.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\"\n\n\"I asked you if you knew him?\"\n\n\"Extremely well.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\"\n\n\"The son of a rich shipbuilder in Malta.\"\n\n\"I know that is the report; but, as you are aware, the police does not\ncontent itself with vague reports.\"\n\n\"However,\" replied the abbe, with an affable smile, \"when that report is\nin accordance with the truth, everybody must believe it, the police as\nwell as all the rest.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of what you assert?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that question?\"\n\n\"Understand, sir, I do not in the least suspect your veracity; I ask if\nyou are certain of it?\"\n\n\"I knew his father, M. Zaccone.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed?\"\n\n\"And when a child I often played with the son in the timber-yards.\"\n\n\"But whence does he derive the title of count?\"\n\n\"You are aware that may be bought.\"\n\n\"In Italy?\"\n\n\"Everywhere.\"\n\n\"And his immense riches, whence does he procure them?\"\n\n\"They may not be so very great.\"\n\n\"How much do you suppose he possesses?\"\n\n\"From one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum.\"\n\n\"That is reasonable,\" said the visitor; \"I have heard he had three or\nfour millions.\"\n\n\"Two hundred thousand per annum would make four millions of capital.\"\n\n\"But I was told he had four millions per annum.\"\n\n\"That is not probable.\"\n\n\"Do you know this Island of Monte Cristo?\"\n\n\"Certainly, every one who has come from Palermo, Naples, or Rome to\nFrance by sea must know it, since he has passed close to it and must\nhave seen it.\"\n\n\"I am told it is a delightful place?\"\n\n\"It is a rock.\"\n\n\"And why has the count bought a rock?\"\n\n\"For the sake of being a count. In Italy one must have territorial\npossessions to be a count.\"\n\n\"You have, doubtless, heard the adventures of M. Zaccone's youth?\"\n\n\"The father's?\"\n\n\"No, the son's.\"\n\n\"I know nothing certain; at that period of his life, I lost sight of my\nyoung comrade.\"\n\n\"Was he in the wars?\"\n\n\"I think he entered the service.\"\n\n\"In what branch?\"\n\n\"In the navy.\"\n\n\"Are you not his confessor?\"\n\n\"No, sir; I believe he is a Lutheran.\"\n\n\"A Lutheran?\"\n\n\"I say, I believe such is the case, I do not affirm it; besides, liberty\nof conscience is established in France.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, and we are not now inquiring into his creed, but his\nactions; in the name of the prefect of police, I ask you what you know\nof him.\n\n\"He passes for a very charitable man. Our holy father, the pope, has\nmade him a knight of Jesus Christ for the services he rendered to the\nChristians in the East; he has five or six rings as testimonials from\nEastern monarchs of his services.\"\n\n\"Does he wear them?\"\n\n\"No, but he is proud of them; he is better pleased with rewards given to\nthe benefactors of man than to his destroyers.\"\n\n\"He is a Quaker then?\"\n\n\"Exactly, he is a Quaker, with the exception of the peculiar dress.\"\n\n\"Has he any friends?\"\n\n\"Yes, every one who knows him is his friend.\"\n\n\"But has he any enemies?\"\n\n\"One only.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\"\n\n\"Lord Wilmore.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"He is in Paris just now.\"\n\n\"Can he give me any particulars?\"\n\n\"Important ones; he was in India with Zaccone.\"\n\n\"Do you know his abode?\"\n\n\"It's somewhere in the Chaussee d'Antin; but I know neither the street\nnor the number.\"\n\n\"Are you at variance with the Englishman?\"\n\n\"I love Zaccone, and he hates him; we are consequently not friends.\"\n\n\"Do you think the Count of Monte Cristo had ever been in France before\nhe made this visit to Paris?\"\n\n\"To that question I can answer positively; no, sir, he had not, because\nhe applied to me six months ago for the particulars he required, and\nas I did not know when I might again come to Paris, I recommended M.\nCavalcanti to him.\"\n\n\"Andrea?\"\n\n\"No, Bartolomeo, his father.\"\n\n\"Now, sir, I have but one question more to ask, and I charge you, in the\nname of honor, of humanity, and of religion, to answer me candidly.\"\n\n\"What is it, sir?\"\n\n\"Do you know with what design M. de Monte Cristo purchased a house at\nAuteuil?\"\n\n\"Certainly, for he told me.\"\n\n\"What is it, sir?\"\n\n\"To make a lunatic asylum of it, similar to that founded by the Count of\nPisani at Palermo. Do you know about that institution?\"\n\n\"I have heard of it.\"\n\n\"It is a magnificent charity.\" Having said this, the abbe bowed to\nimply he wished to pursue his studies. The visitor either understood the\nabbe's meaning, or had no more questions to ask; he arose, and the\nabbe accompanied him to the door. \"You are a great almsgiver,\" said the\nvisitor, \"and although you are said to be rich, I will venture to offer\nyou something for your poor people; will you accept my offering?\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir; I am only jealous in one thing, and that is that the\nrelief I give should be entirely from my own resources.\"\n\n\"However\"--\n\n\"My resolution, sir, is unchangeable, but you have only to search for\nyourself and you will find, alas, but too many objects upon whom to\nexercise your benevolence.\" The abbe once more bowed as he opened the\ndoor, the stranger bowed and took his leave, and the carriage conveyed\nhim straight to the house of M. de Villefort. An hour afterwards\nthe carriage was again ordered, and this time it went to the Rue\nFontaine-Saint-George, and stopped at No. 5, where Lord Wilmore lived.\nThe stranger had written to Lord Wilmore, requesting an interview, which\nthe latter had fixed for ten o'clock. As the envoy of the prefect of\npolice arrived ten minutes before ten, he was told that Lord Wilmore,\nwho was precision and punctuality personified, was not yet come in, but\nthat he would be sure to return as the clock struck.\n\nThe visitor was introduced into the drawing-room, which was like all\nother furnished drawing-rooms. A mantle-piece, with two modern Sevres\nvases, a timepiece representing Cupid with his bent bow, a mirror with\nan engraving on each side--one representing Homer carrying his\nguide, the other, Belisarius begging--a grayish paper; red and black\ntapestry--such was the appearance of Lord Wilmore's drawing-room. It was\nilluminated by lamps with ground-glass shades which gave only a feeble\nlight, as if out of consideration for the envoy's weak sight. After ten\nminutes' expectation the clock struck ten; at the fifth stroke the door\nopened and Lord Wilmore appeared. He was rather above the middle height,\nwith thin reddish whiskers, light complexion and light hair, turning\nrather gray. He was dressed with all the English peculiarity, namely, in\na blue coat, with gilt buttons and high collar, in the fashion of 1811,\na white kerseymere waistcoat, and nankeen pantaloons, three inches too\nshort, but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the\nknee. His first remark on entering was,--\"You know, sir, I do not speak\nFrench?\"\n\n\"I know you do not like to converse in our language,\" replied the envoy.\n\"But you may use it,\" replied Lord Wilmore; \"I understand it.\"\n\n\"And I,\" replied the visitor, changing his idiom, \"know enough of\nEnglish to keep up the conversation. Do not put yourself to the\nslightest inconvenience.\"\n\n\"Aw?\" said Lord Wilmore, with that tone which is only known to natives\nof Great Britain.\n\nThe envoy presented his letter of introduction, which the latter read\nwith English coolness, and having finished,--\"I understand,\" said he,\n\"perfectly.\"\n\nThen began the questions, which were similar to those which had been\naddressed to the Abbe Busoni. But as Lord Wilmore, in the character of\nthe count's enemy, was less restrained in his answers, they were more\nnumerous; he described the youth of Monte Cristo, who he said, at ten\nyears of age, entered the service of one of the petty sovereigns of\nIndia who make war on the English. It was there Wilmore had first met\nhim and fought against him; and in that war Zaccone had been taken\nprisoner, sent to England, and consigned to the hulks, whence he had\nescaped by swimming. Then began his travels, his duels, his caprices;\nthen the insurrection in Greece broke out, and he had served in the\nGrecian ranks. While in that service he had discovered a silver mine in\nthe mountains of Thessaly, but he had been careful to conceal it from\nevery one. After the battle of Navarino, when the Greek government was\nconsolidated, he asked of King Otho a mining grant for that district,\nwhich was given him. Hence that immense fortune, which, in Lord\nWilmore's opinion, possibly amounted to one or two millions per\nannum,--a precarious fortune, which might be momentarily lost by the\nfailure of the mine.\n\n\"But,\" asked the visitor, \"do you know why he came to France?\"\n\n\"He is speculating in railways,\" said Lord Wilmore, \"and as he is\nan expert chemist and physicist, he has invented a new system of\ntelegraphy, which he is seeking to bring to perfection.\"\n\n\"How much does he spend yearly?\" asked the prefect.\n\n\"Not more than five or six hundred thousand francs,\" said Lord Wilmore;\n\"he is a miser.\" Hatred evidently inspired the Englishman, who, knowing\nno other reproach to bring on the count, accused him of avarice. \"Do you\nknow his house at Auteuil?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"What do you know respecting it?\"\n\n\"Do you wish to know why he bought it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The count is a speculator, who will certainly ruin himself in\nexperiments. He supposes there is in the neighborhood of the house he\nhas bought a mineral spring equal to those at Bagneres, Luchon, and\nCauterets. He is going to turn his house into a Badhaus, as the Germans\nterm it. He has already dug up all the garden two or three times to find\nthe famous spring, and, being unsuccessful, he will soon purchase all\nthe contiguous houses. Now, as I dislike him, and hope his railway,\nhis electric telegraph, or his search for baths, will ruin him, I am\nwatching for his discomfiture, which must soon take place.\"\n\n\"What was the cause of your quarrel?\"\n\n\"When he was in England he seduced the wife of one of my friends.\"\n\n\"Why do you not seek revenge?\"\n\n\"I have already fought three duels with him,\" said the Englishman, \"the\nfirst with the pistol, the second with the sword, and the third with the\nsabre.\"\n\n\"And what was the result of those duels?\"\n\n\"The first time, he broke my arm; the second, he wounded me in the\nbreast; and the third time, made this large wound.\" The Englishman\nturned down his shirt-collar, and showed a scar, whose redness proved\nit to be a recent one. \"So that, you see, there is a deadly feud between\nus.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the envoy, \"you do not go about it in the right way to kill\nhim, if I understand you correctly.\"\n\n\"Aw?\" said the Englishman, \"I practice shooting every day, and every\nother day Grisier comes to my house.\"\n\nThis was all the visitor wished to ascertain, or, rather, all the\nEnglishman appeared to know. The agent arose, and having bowed to Lord\nWilmore, who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the\nEnglish, he retired. Lord Wilmore, having heard the door close after\nhim, returned to his bedroom, where with one hand he pulled off his\nlight hair, his red whiskers, his false jaw, and his wound, to resume\nthe black hair, dark complexion, and pearly teeth of the Count of Monte\nCristo. It was M. de Villefort, and not the prefect, who returned to the\nhouse of M. de Villefort. The procureur felt more at ease, although he\nhad learned nothing really satisfactory, and, for the first time since\nthe dinner-party at Auteuil, he slept soundly.\n\n\n\nChapter 70. The Ball.\n\nIt was in the warmest days of July, when in due course of time the\nSaturday arrived upon which the ball was to take place at M. de\nMorcerf's. It was ten o'clock at night; the branches of the great trees\nin the garden of the count's house stood out boldly against the azure\ncanopy of heaven, which was studded with golden stars, but where\nthe last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered. From the\napartments on the ground-floor might be heard the sound of music, with\nthe whirl of the waltz and galop, while brilliant streams of light shone\nthrough the openings of the Venetian blinds. At this moment the garden\nwas only occupied by about ten servants, who had just received orders\nfrom their mistress to prepare the supper, the serenity of the weather\ncontinuing to increase. Until now, it had been undecided whether the\nsupper should take place in the dining-room, or under a long tent\nerected on the lawn, but the beautiful blue sky, studded with stars, had\nsettled the question in favor of the lawn. The gardens were illuminated\nwith colored lanterns, according to the Italian custom, and, as is usual\nin countries where the luxuries of the table--the rarest of all luxuries\nin their complete form--are well understood, the supper-table was loaded\nwith wax-lights and flowers.\n\nAt the time the Countess of Morcerf returned to the rooms, after giving\nher orders, many guests were arriving, more attracted by the charming\nhospitality of the countess than by the distinguished position of the\ncount; for, owing to the good taste of Mercedes, one was sure of finding\nsome devices at her entertainment worthy of describing, or even copying\nin case of need. Madame Danglars, in whom the events we have related had\ncaused deep anxiety, had hesitated about going to Madame de Morcerf's,\nwhen during the morning her carriage happened to meet that of Villefort.\nThe latter made a sign, and when the carriages had drawn close together,\nsaid,--\"You are going to Madame de Morcerf's, are you not?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Madame Danglars, \"I am too ill.\"\n\n\"You are wrong,\" replied Villefort, significantly; \"it is important that\nyou should be seen there.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" asked the baroness.\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"In that case I will go.\" And the two carriages passed on towards\ntheir different destinations. Madame Danglars therefore came, not only\nbeautiful in person, but radiant with splendor; she entered by one door\nat the time when Mercedes appeared at the door. The countess took Albert\nto meet Madame Danglars. He approached, paid her some well merited\ncompliments on her toilet, and offered his arm to conduct her to a seat.\nAlbert looked around him. \"You are looking for my daughter?\" said the\nbaroness, smiling.\n\n\"I confess it,\" replied Albert. \"Could you have been so cruel as not to\nbring her?\"\n\n\"Calm yourself. She has met Mademoiselle de Villefort, and has taken\nher arm; see, they are following us, both in white dresses, one with a\nbouquet of camellias, the other with one of myosotis. But tell me\"--\n\n\"Well, what do you wish to know?\"\n\n\"Will not the Count of Monte Cristo be here to-night?\"\n\n\"Seventeen!\" replied Albert.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I only mean that the count seems the rage,\" replied the viscount,\nsmiling, \"and that you are the seventeenth person that has asked me the\nsame question. The count is in fashion; I congratulate him upon it.\"\n\n\"And have you replied to every one as you have to me?\"\n\n\"Ah, to be sure, I have not answered you; be satisfied, we shall have\nthis 'lion;' we are among the privileged ones.\"\n\n\"Were you at the opera yesterday?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"He was there.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed? And did the eccentric person commit any new originality?\"\n\n\"Can he be seen without doing so? Elssler was dancing in the 'Diable\nBoiteux;' the Greek princess was in ecstasies. After the cachucha he\nplaced a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet, and threw it to\nthe charming danseuse, who, in the third act, to do honor to the gift,\nreappeared with it on her finger. And the Greek princess,--will she be\nhere?\"\n\n\"No, you will be deprived of that pleasure; her position in the count's\nestablishment is not sufficiently understood.\"\n\n\"Wait; leave me here, and go and speak to Madame de Villefort, who is\ntrying to attract your attention.\"\n\nAlbert bowed to Madame Danglars, and advanced towards Madame de\nVillefort, whose lips opened as he approached. \"I wager anything,\" said\nAlbert, interrupting her, \"that I know what you were about to say.\"\n\n\"Well, what is it?\"\n\n\"If I guess rightly, will you confess it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"On your honor?\"\n\n\"On my honor.\"\n\n\"You were going to ask me if the Count of Monte Cristo had arrived, or\nwas expected.\"\n\n\"Not at all. It is not of him that I am now thinking. I was going to ask\nyou if you had received any news of Monsieur Franz.\"\n\n\"Yes,--yesterday.\"\n\n\"What did he tell you?\"\n\n\"That he was leaving at the same time as his letter.\"\n\n\"Well, now then, the count?\"\n\n\"The count will come, of that you may be satisfied.\"\n\n\"You know that he has another name besides Monte Cristo?\"\n\n\"No, I did not know it.\"\n\n\"Monte Cristo is the name of an island, and he has a family name.\"\n\n\"I never heard it.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I am better informed than you; his name is Zaccone.\"\n\n\"It is possible.\"\n\n\"He is a Maltese.\"\n\n\"That is also possible.\n\n\"The son of a shipowner.\"\n\n\"Really, you should relate all this aloud, you would have the greatest\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"He served in India, discovered a mine in Thessaly, and comes to Paris\nto establish a mineral water-cure at Auteuil.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sure,\" said Morcerf, \"this is indeed news! Am I allowed to\nrepeat it?\"\n\n\"Yes, but cautiously, tell one thing at a time, and do not say I told\nyou.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because it is a secret just discovered.\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"The police.\"\n\n\"Then the news originated\"--\n\n\"At the prefect's last night. Paris, you can understand, is astonished\nat the sight of such unusual splendor, and the police have made\ninquiries.\"\n\n\"Well, well! Nothing more is wanting than to arrest the count as a\nvagabond, on the pretext of his being too rich.\"\n\n\"Indeed, that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not\nbeen so favorable.\"\n\n\"Poor count! And is he aware of the danger he has been in?\"\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"Then it will be but charitable to inform him. When he arrives, I will\nnot fail to do so.\"\n\nJust then, a handsome young man, with bright eyes, black hair, and\nglossy mustache, respectfully bowed to Madame de Villefort. Albert\nextended his hand. \"Madame,\" said Albert, \"allow me to present to you M.\nMaximilian Morrel, captain of Spahis, one of our best, and, above all,\nof our bravest officers.\"\n\n\"I have already had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman at Auteuil,\nat the house of the Count of Monte Cristo,\" replied Madame de Villefort,\nturning away with marked coldness of manner. This answer, and especially\nthe tone in which it was uttered, chilled the heart of poor Morrel. But\na recompense was in store for him; turning around, he saw near the door\na beautiful fair face, whose large blue eyes were, without any marked\nexpression, fixed upon him, while the bouquet of myosotis was gently\nraised to her lips.\n\nThe salutation was so well understood that Morrel, with the same\nexpression in his eyes, placed his handkerchief to his mouth; and these\ntwo living statues, whose hearts beat so violently under their marble\naspect, separated from each other by the whole length of the room,\nforgot themselves for a moment, or rather forgot the world in their\nmutual contemplation. They might have remained much longer lost in one\nanother, without any one noticing their abstraction. The Count of Monte\nCristo had just entered.\n\nWe have already said that there was something in the count which\nattracted universal attention wherever he appeared. It was not the coat,\nunexceptional in its cut, though simple and unornamented; it was not the\nplain white waistcoat; it was not the trousers, that displayed the foot\nso perfectly formed--it was none of these things that attracted the\nattention,--it was his pale complexion, his waving black hair, his calm\nand serene expression, his dark and melancholy eye, his mouth, chiselled\nwith such marvellous delicacy, which so easily expressed such high\ndisdain,--these were what fixed the attention of all upon him. Many\nmen might have been handsomer, but certainly there could be none\nwhose appearance was more significant, if the expression may be used.\nEverything about the count seemed to have its meaning, for the constant\nhabit of thought which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor\nto the expression of his face, and even to the most trifling gesture,\nscarcely to be understood. Yet the Parisian world is so strange, that\neven all this might not have won attention had there not been connected\nwith it a mysterious story gilded by an immense fortune.\n\nMeanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of guests under a battery\nof curious glances towards Madame de Morcerf, who, standing before\na mantle-piece ornamented with flowers, had seen his entrance in a\nlooking-glass placed opposite the door, and was prepared to receive him.\nShe turned towards him with a serene smile just at the moment he was\nbowing to her. No doubt she fancied the count would speak to her, while\non his side the count thought she was about to address him; but both\nremained silent, and after a mere bow, Monte Cristo directed his steps\nto Albert, who received him cordially. \"Have you seen my mother?\" asked\nAlbert.\n\n\"I have just had the pleasure,\" replied the count; \"but I have not seen\nyour father.\"\n\n\"See, he is down there, talking politics with that little group of great\ngeniuses.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Monte Cristo; \"and so those gentlemen down there are\nmen of great talent. I should not have guessed it. And for what kind of\ntalent are they celebrated? You know there are different sorts.\"\n\n\"That tall, harsh-looking man is very learned, he discovered, in the\nneighborhood of Rome, a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than\nlizards usually have, and he immediately laid his discovery before the\nInstitute. The thing was discussed for a long time, but finally decided\nin his favor. I can assure you the vertebra made a great noise in the\nlearned world, and the gentleman, who was only a knight of the Legion of\nHonor, was made an officer.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Monte Cristo, \"this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded.\nI suppose, had he found another additional vertebra, they would have\nmade him a commander.\"\n\n\"Very likely,\" said Albert.\n\n\"And who can that person be who has taken it into his head to wrap\nhimself up in a blue coat embroidered with green?\"\n\n\"Oh, that coat is not his own idea; it is the Republic's, which deputed\nDavid [*] to devise a uniform for the Academicians.\"\n\n     * Louis David, a famous French painter.\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Monte Cristo; \"so this gentleman is an Academician?\"\n\n\"Within the last week he has been made one of the learned assembly.\"\n\n\"And what is his especial talent?\"\n\n\"His talent? I believe he thrusts pins through the heads of rabbits, he\nmakes fowls eat madder, and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with\nwhalebone.\"\n\n\"And he is made a member of the Academy of Sciences for this?\"\n\n\"No; of the French Academy.\"\n\n\"But what has the French Academy to do with all this?\"\n\n\"I was going to tell you. It seems\"--\n\n\"That his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of\nscience, doubtless?\"\n\n\"No; that his style of writing is very good.\"\n\n\"This must be very flattering to the feelings of the rabbits into whose\nheads he has thrust pins, to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red, and\nto the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out?\"\n\nAlbert laughed.\n\n\"And the other one?\" demanded the count.\n\n\"That one?\"\n\n\"Yes, the third.\"\n\n\"The one in the dark blue coat?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He is a colleague of the count, and one of the most active opponents to\nthe idea of providing the Chamber of Peers with a uniform. He was very\nsuccessful upon that question. He stood badly with the Liberal papers,\nbut his noble opposition to the wishes of the court is now getting him\ninto favor with the journalists. They talk of making him an ambassador.\"\n\n\"And what are his claims to the peerage?\"\n\n\"He has composed two or three comic operas, written four or five\narticles in the Siecle, and voted five or six years on the ministerial\nside.\"\n\n\"Bravo, Viscount,\" said Monte Cristo, smiling; \"you are a delightful\ncicerone. And now you will do me a favor, will you not?\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Do not introduce me to any of these gentlemen; and should they wish it,\nyou will warn me.\" Just then the count felt his arm pressed. He turned\nround; it was Danglars.\n\n\"Ah, is it you, baron?\" said he.\n\n\"Why do you call me baron?\" said Danglars; \"you know that I care nothing\nfor my title. I am not like you, viscount; you like your title, do you\nnot?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied Albert, \"seeing that without my title I should\nbe nothing; while you, sacrificing the baron, would still remain the\nmillionaire.\"\n\n\"Which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of July,\" replied\nDanglars.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" said Monte Cristo, \"one's title to a millionaire does\nnot last for life, like that of baron, peer of France, or Academician;\nfor example, the millionaires Franck & Poulmann, of Frankfort, who have\njust become bankrupts.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Danglars, becoming pale.\n\n\"Yes; I received the news this evening by a courier. I had about a\nmillion in their hands, but, warned in time, I withdrew it a month ago.\"\n\n\"Ah, mon Dieu,\" exclaimed Danglars, \"they have drawn on me for 200,000\nfrancs!\"\n\n\"Well, you can throw out the draft; their signature is worth five per\ncent.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it is too late,\" said Danglars, \"I have honored their bills.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Monte Cristo, \"here are 200,000 francs gone after\"--\n\n\"Hush, do not mention these things,\" said Danglars; then, approaching\nMonte Cristo, he added, \"especially before young M. Cavalcanti;\" after\nwhich he smiled, and turned towards the young man in question. Albert\nhad left the count to speak to his mother, Danglars to converse with\nyoung Cavalcanti; Monte Cristo was for an instant alone. Meanwhile the\nheat became excessive. The footmen were hastening through the rooms with\nwaiters loaded with ices. Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration from his\nforehead, but drew back when the waiter was presented to him; he took no\nrefreshment. Madame de Morcerf did not lose sight of Monte Cristo; she\nsaw that he took nothing, and even noticed his gesture of refusal.\n\n\"Albert,\" she asked, \"did you notice that?\"\n\n\"What, mother?\"\n\n\"That the count has never been willing to partake of food under the roof\nof M. de Morcerf.\"\n\n\"Yes; but then he breakfasted with me--indeed, he made his first\nappearance in the world on that occasion.\"\n\n\"But your house is not M. de Morcerf's,\" murmured Mercedes; \"and since\nhe has been here I have watched him.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, he has taken nothing yet.\"\n\n\"The count is very temperate.\" Mercedes smiled sadly. \"Approach him,\"\nsaid she, \"and when the next waiter passes, insist upon his taking\nsomething.\"\n\n\"But why, mother?\"\n\n\"Just to please me, Albert,\" said Mercedes. Albert kissed his mother's\nhand, and drew near the count. Another salver passed, loaded like the\npreceding ones; she saw Albert attempt to persuade the count, but he\nobstinately refused. Albert rejoined his mother; she was very pale.\n\n\"Well,\" said she, \"you see he refuses?\"\n\n\"Yes; but why need this annoy you?\"\n\n\"You know, Albert, women are singular creatures. I should like to have\nseen the count take something in my house, if only an ice. Perhaps he\ncannot reconcile himself to the French style of living, and might prefer\nsomething else.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; I have seen him eat of everything in Italy; no doubt he does\nnot feel inclined this evening.\"\n\n\"And besides,\" said the countess, \"accustomed as he is to burning\nclimates, possibly he does not feel the heat as we do.\"\n\n\"I do not think that, for he has complained of feeling almost\nsuffocated, and asked why the Venetian blinds were not opened as well as\nthe windows.\"\n\n\"In a word,\" said Mercedes, \"it was a way of assuring me that his\nabstinence was intended.\" And she left the room. A minute afterwards\nthe blinds were thrown open, and through the jessamine and clematis that\noverhung the window one could see the garden ornamented with lanterns,\nand the supper laid under the tent. Dancers, players, talkers, all\nuttered an exclamation of joy--every one inhaled with delight the\nbreeze that floated in. At the same time Mercedes reappeared, paler than\nbefore, but with that imperturbable expression of countenance which\nshe sometimes wore. She went straight to the group of which her husband\nformed the centre. \"Do not detain those gentlemen here, count,\" she\nsaid; \"they would prefer, I should think, to breathe in the garden\nrather than suffocate here, since they are not playing.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said a gallant old general, who, in 1809, had sung \"Partant pour\nla Syrie,\"--\"we will not go alone to the garden.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Mercedes, \"I will lead the way.\" Turning towards Monte\nCristo, she added, \"count, will you oblige me with your arm?\" The\ncount almost staggered at these simple words; then he fixed his eyes on\nMercedes. It was only a momentary glance, but it seemed to the countess\nto have lasted for a century, so much was expressed in that one look. He\noffered his arm to the countess; she took it, or rather just touched it\nwith her little hand, and they together descended the steps, lined with\nrhododendrons and camellias. Behind them, by another outlet, a group of\nabout twenty persons rushed into the garden with loud exclamations of\ndelight.\n\n\n\nChapter 71. Bread and Salt.\n\nMadame de Morcerf entered an archway of trees with her companion. It led\nthrough a grove of lindens to a conservatory.\n\n\"It was too warm in the room, was it not, count?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, madame; and it was an excellent idea of yours to open the doors\nand the blinds.\" As he ceased speaking, the count felt the hand of\nMercedes tremble. \"But you,\" he said, \"with that light dress, and\nwithout anything to cover you but that gauze scarf, perhaps you feel\ncold?\"\n\n\"Do you know where I am leading you?\" said the countess, without\nreplying to the question.\n\n\"No, madame,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"but you see I make no resistance.\"\n\n\"We are going to the greenhouse that you see at the other end of the\ngrove.\"\n\nThe count looked at Mercedes as if to interrogate her, but she continued\nto walk on in silence, and he refrained from speaking. They reached\nthe building, ornamented with magnificent fruits, which ripen at the\nbeginning of July in the artificial temperature which takes the place of\nthe sun, so frequently absent in our climate. The countess left the arm\nof Monte Cristo, and gathered a bunch of Muscatel grapes. \"See, count,\"\nshe said, with a smile so sad in its expression that one could almost\ndetect the tears on her eyelids--\"see, our French grapes are not to be\ncompared, I know, with yours of Sicily and Cyprus, but you will make\nallowance for our northern sun.\" The count bowed, but stepped back.\n\"Do you refuse?\" said Mercedes, in a tremulous voice. \"Pray excuse me,\nmadame,\" replied Monte Cristo, \"but I never eat Muscatel grapes.\"\n\nMercedes let them fall, and sighed. A magnificent peach was hanging\nagainst an adjoining wall, ripened by the same artificial heat. Mercedes\ndrew near, and plucked the fruit. \"Take this peach, then,\" she said. The\ncount again refused. \"What, again?\" she exclaimed, in so plaintive an\naccent that it seemed to stifle a sob; \"really, you pain me.\"\n\nA long silence followed; the peach, like the grapes, fell to the\nground. \"Count,\" added Mercedes with a supplicating glance, \"there is a\nbeautiful Arabian custom, which makes eternal friends of those who have\ntogether eaten bread and salt under the same roof.\"\n\n\"I know it, madame,\" replied the count; \"but we are in France, and not\nin Arabia, and in France eternal friendships are as rare as the custom\nof dividing bread and salt with one another.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the countess, breathlessly, with her eyes fixed on Monte\nCristo, whose arm she convulsively pressed with both hands, \"we are\nfriends, are we not?\"\n\nThe count became pale as death, the blood rushed to his heart, and then\nagain rising, dyed his cheeks with crimson; his eyes swam like those of\na man suddenly dazzled. \"Certainly, we are friends,\" he replied; \"why\nshould we not be?\" The answer was so little like the one Mercedes\ndesired, that she turned away to give vent to a sigh, which sounded more\nlike a groan. \"Thank you,\" she said. And they walked on again. They went\nthe whole length of the garden without uttering a word. \"Sir,\" suddenly\nexclaimed the countess, after their walk had continued ten minutes in\nsilence, \"is it true that you have seen so much, travelled so far, and\nsuffered so deeply?\"\n\n\"I have suffered deeply, madame,\" answered Monte Cristo.\n\n\"But now you are happy?\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" replied the count, \"since no one hears me complain.\"\n\n\"And your present happiness, has it softened your heart?\"\n\n\"My present happiness equals my past misery,\" said the count.\n\n\"Are you not married?\" asked the countess. \"I, married?\" exclaimed Monte\nCristo, shuddering; \"who could have told you so?\"\n\n\"No one told me you were, but you have frequently been seen at the opera\nwith a young and lovely woman.\"\n\n\"She is a slave whom I bought at Constantinople, madame, the daughter of\na prince. I have adopted her as my daughter, having no one else to love\nin the world.\"\n\n\"You live alone, then?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"You have no sister--no son--no father?\"\n\n\"I have no one.\"\n\n\"How can you exist thus without any one to attach you to life?\"\n\n\"It is not my fault, madame. At Malta, I loved a young girl, was on the\npoint of marrying her, when war came and carried me away. I thought she\nloved me well enough to wait for me, and even to remain faithful to my\nmemory. When I returned she was married. This is the history of most men\nwho have passed twenty years of age. Perhaps my heart was weaker than\nthe hearts of most men, and I suffered more than they would have done in\nmy place; that is all.\" The countess stopped for a moment, as if gasping\nfor breath. \"Yes,\" she said, \"and you have still preserved this love in\nyour heart--one can only love once--and did you ever see her again?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Never?\"\n\n\"I never returned to the country where she lived.\"\n\n\"To Malta?\"\n\n\"Yes; Malta.\"\n\n\"She is, then, now at Malta?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"And have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer?\"\n\n\"Her,--yes.\"\n\n\"But only her; do you then still hate those who separated you?\"\n\n\"I hate them? Not at all; why should I?\" The countess placed herself\nbefore Monte Cristo, still holding in her hand a portion of the perfumed\ngrapes. \"Take some,\" she said. \"Madame, I never eat Muscatel grapes,\"\nreplied Monte Cristo, as if the subject had not been mentioned before.\nThe countess dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket, with a gesture\nof despair. \"Inflexible man!\" she murmured. Monte Cristo remained as\nunmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him. Albert at\nthis moment ran in. \"Oh, mother,\" he exclaimed, \"such a misfortune has\nhappened!\"\n\n\"What? What has happened?\" asked the countess, as though awakening from\na sleep to the realities of life; \"did you say a misfortune? Indeed, I\nshould expect misfortunes.\"\n\n\"M. de Villefort is here.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He comes to fetch his wife and daughter.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because Madame de Saint-Meran is just arrived in Paris, bringing the\nnews of M. de Saint-Meran's death, which took place on the first stage\nafter he left Marseilles. Madame de Villefort, who was in very good\nspirits, would neither believe nor think of the misfortune, but\nMademoiselle Valentine, at the first words, guessed the whole truth,\nnotwithstanding all the precautions of her father; the blow struck her\nlike a thunderbolt, and she fell senseless.\"\n\n\"And how was M. de Saint-Meran related to Mademoiselle de Villefort?\"\nsaid the count.\n\n\"He was her grandfather on the mother's side. He was coming here to\nhasten her marriage with Franz.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed?\"\n\n\"So Franz must wait. Why was not M. de Saint-Meran also grandfather to\nMademoiselle Danglars?\"\n\n\"Albert, Albert,\" said Madame de Morcerf, in a tone of mild reproof,\n\"what are you saying? Ah, count, he esteems you so highly, tell him that\nhe has spoken amiss.\" And she took two or three steps forward.\nMonte Cristo watched her with an air so thoughtful, and so full of\naffectionate admiration, that she turned back and grasped his hand; at\nthe same time she seized that of her son, and joined them together.\n\n\"We are friends; are we not?\" she asked.\n\n\"Oh, madame, I do not presume to call myself your friend, but at all\ntimes I am your most respectful servant.\" The countess left with an\nindescribable pang in her heart, and before she had taken ten steps the\ncount saw her raise her handkerchief to her eyes. \"Do not my mother and\nyou agree?\" asked Albert, astonished.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" replied the count, \"did you not hear her declare that\nwe were friends?\" They re-entered the drawing-room, which Valentine and\nMadame de Villefort had just quitted. It is perhaps needless to add that\nMorrel departed almost at the same time.\n\n\n\nChapter 72. Madame de Saint-Meran.\n\nA gloomy scene had indeed just passed at the house of M. de Villefort.\nAfter the ladies had departed for the ball, whither all the entreaties\nof Madame de Villefort had failed in persuading him to accompany them,\nthe procureur had shut himself up in his study, according to his custom,\nwith a heap of papers calculated to alarm any one else, but which\ngenerally scarcely satisfied his inordinate desires. But this time the\npapers were a mere matter of form. Villefort had secluded himself, not\nto study, but to reflect; and with the door locked and orders given that\nhe should not be disturbed excepting for important business, he sat down\nin his arm-chair and began to ponder over the events, the remembrance of\nwhich had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy\nthoughts and bitter recollections. Then, instead of plunging into the\nmass of documents piled before him, he opened the drawer of his desk,\ntouched a spring, and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda, amongst\nwhich he had carefully arranged, in characters only known to himself,\nthe names of all those who, either in his political career, in money\nmatters, at the bar, or in his mysterious love affairs, had become his\nenemies.\n\nTheir number was formidable, now that he had begun to fear, and yet\nthese names, powerful though they were, had often caused him to smile\nwith the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a traveller who from\nthe summit of a mountain beholds at his feet the craggy eminences, the\nalmost impassable paths, and the fearful chasms, through which he has so\nperilously climbed. When he had run over all these names in his memory,\nagain read and studied them, commenting meanwhile upon his lists, he\nshook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he murmured, \"none of my enemies would have waited so patiently\nand laboriously for so long a space of time, that they might now come\nand crush me with this secret. Sometimes, as Hamlet says--\n\n      'Foul deeds will rise,\n      Tho' all the earth o'erwhelm them to men's eyes;'\n\nbut, like a phosphoric light, they rise but to mislead. The story has\nbeen told by the Corsican to some priest, who in his turn has repeated\nit. M. de Monte Cristo may have heard it, and to enlighten himself--but\nwhy should he wish to enlighten himself upon the subject?\" asked\nVillefort, after a moment's reflection, \"what interest can this M. de\nMonte Cristo or M. Zaccone,--son of a shipowner of Malta, discoverer\nof a mine in Thessaly, now visiting Paris for the first time,--what\ninterest, I say, can he take in discovering a gloomy, mysterious, and\nuseless fact like this? However, among all the incoherent details given\nto me by the Abbe Busoni and by Lord Wilmore, by that friend and that\nenemy, one thing appears certain and clear in my opinion--that in\nno period, in no case, in no circumstance, could there have been any\ncontact between him and me.\"\n\nBut Villefort uttered words which even he himself did not believe. He\ndreaded not so much the revelation, for he could reply to or deny its\ntruth;--he cared little for that mene, tekel, upharsin, which appeared\nsuddenly in letters of blood upon the wall;--but what he was really\nanxious for was to discover whose hand had traced them. While he\nwas endeavoring to calm his fears,--and instead of dwelling upon the\npolitical future that had so often been the subject of his ambitious\ndreams, was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home, in\nfear of awakening the enemy that had so long slept,--the noise of a\ncarriage sounded in the yard, then he heard the steps of an aged person\nascending the stairs, followed by tears and lamentations, such as\nservants always give vent to when they wish to appear interested in\ntheir master's grief. He drew back the bolt of his door, and almost\ndirectly an old lady entered, unannounced, carrying her shawl on her\narm, and her bonnet in her hand. The white hair was thrown back from her\nyellow forehead, and her eyes, already sunken by the furrows of age, now\nalmost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with grief. \"Oh, sir,\"\nshe said; \"oh, sir, what a misfortune! I shall die of it; oh, yes, I\nshall certainly die of it!\"\n\nAnd then, falling upon the chair nearest the door, she burst into a\nparoxysm of sobs. The servants, standing in the doorway, not daring to\napproach nearer, were looking at Noirtier's old servant, who had heard\nthe noise from his master's room, and run there also, remaining behind\nthe others. Villefort rose, and ran towards his mother-in-law, for it\nwas she.\n\n\"Why, what can have happened?\" he exclaimed, \"what has thus disturbed\nyou? Is M. de Saint-Meran with you?\"\n\n\"M. de Saint-Meran is dead,\" answered the old marchioness, without\npreface and without expression; she appeared to be stupefied. Villefort\ndrew back, and clasping his hands together, exclaimed--\"Dead!--so\nsuddenly?\"\n\n\"A week ago,\" continued Madame de Saint-Meran, \"we went out together in\nthe carriage after dinner. M. de Saint-Meran had been unwell for some\ndays; still, the idea of seeing our dear Valentine again inspired him\nwith courage, and notwithstanding his illness he would leave. At six\nleagues from Marseilles, after having eaten some of the lozenges he is\naccustomed to take, he fell into such a deep sleep, that it appeared to\nme unnatural; still I hesitated to wake him, although I fancied that\nhis face was flushed, and that the veins of his temples throbbed more\nviolently than usual. However, as it became dark, and I could no longer\nsee, I fell asleep; I was soon aroused by a piercing shriek, as from\na person suffering in his dreams, and he suddenly threw his head back\nviolently. I called the valet, I stopped the postilion, I spoke to M.\nde Saint-Meran, I applied my smelling-salts; but all was over, and I\narrived at Aix by the side of a corpse.\" Villefort stood with his mouth\nhalf open, quite stupefied.\n\n\"Of course you sent for a doctor?\"\n\n\"Immediately; but, as I have told you, it was too late.\"\n\n\"Yes; but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had\ndied.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir, he told me; it appears to have been an apoplectic\nstroke.\"\n\n\"And what did you do then?\"\n\n\"M. de Saint-Meran had always expressed a desire, in case his death\nhappened during his absence from Paris, that his body might be brought\nto the family vault. I had him put into a leaden coffin, and I am\npreceding him by a few days.\"\n\n\"Oh, my poor mother,\" said Villefort, \"to have such duties to perform at\nyour age after such a blow!\"\n\n\"God has supported me through all; and then, my dear marquis, he would\ncertainly have done everything for me that I performed for him. It is\ntrue that since I left him, I seem to have lost my senses. I cannot cry;\nat my age they say that we have no more tears,--still I think that\nwhen one is in trouble one should have the power of weeping. Where\nis Valentine, sir? It is on her account I am here; I wish to see\nValentine.\" Villefort thought it would be terrible to reply that\nValentine was at a ball; so he only said that she had gone out with her\nstep-mother, and that she should be fetched. \"This instant, sir--this\ninstant, I beseech you!\" said the old lady. Villefort placed the arm\nof Madame de Saint-Meran within his own, and conducted her to his\napartment. \"Rest yourself, mother,\" he said.\n\nThe marchioness raised her head at this word, and beholding the man who\nso forcibly reminded her of her deeply-regretted child, who still\nlived for her in Valentine, she felt touched at the name of mother, and\nbursting into tears, she fell on her knees before an arm-chair, where\nshe buried her venerable head. Villefort left her to the care of the\nwomen, while old Barrois ran, half-scared, to his master; for nothing\nfrightens old people so much as when death relaxes its vigilance over\nthem for a moment in order to strike some other old person. Then,\nwhile Madame de Saint-Meran remained on her knees, praying fervently,\nVillefort sent for a cab, and went himself to fetch his wife and\ndaughter from Madame de Morcerf's. He was so pale when he appeared at\nthe door of the ball-room, that Valentine ran to him, saying--\n\n\"Oh, father, some misfortune has happened!\"\n\n\"Your grandmamma has just arrived, Valentine,\" said M. de Villefort.\n\n\"And grandpapa?\" inquired the young girl, trembling with apprehension.\nM. de Villefort only replied by offering his arm to his daughter. It was\njust in time, for Valentine's head swam, and she staggered; Madame de\nVillefort instantly hastened to her assistance, and aided her husband in\ndragging her to the carriage, saying--\"What a singular event! Who could\nhave thought it? Ah, yes, it is indeed strange!\" And the wretched\nfamily departed, leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the rest of\nthe evening. At the foot of the stairs, Valentine found Barrois awaiting\nher.\n\n\"M. Noirtier wishes to see you to-night, he said, in an undertone.\n\n\"Tell him I will come when I leave my dear grandmamma,\" she replied,\nfeeling, with true delicacy, that the person to whom she could be of the\nmost service just then was Madame de Saint-Meran. Valentine found her\ngrandmother in bed; silent caresses, heartwrung sobs, broken sighs,\nburning tears, were all that passed in this sad interview, while Madame\nde Villefort, leaning on her husband's arm, maintained all outward forms\nof respect, at least towards the poor widow. She soon whispered to\nher husband, \"I think it would be better for me to retire, with\nyour permission, for the sight of me appears still to afflict your\nmother-in-law.\" Madame de Saint-Meran heard her. \"Yes, yes,\" she\nsaid softly to Valentine, \"let her leave; but do you stay.\" Madame de\nVillefort left, and Valentine remained alone beside the bed, for the\nprocureur, overcome with astonishment at the unexpected death, had\nfollowed his wife. Meanwhile, Barrois had returned for the first time to\nold Noirtier, who having heard the noise in the house, had, as we have\nsaid, sent his old servant to inquire the cause; on his return, his\nquick intelligent eye interrogated the messenger. \"Alas, sir,\" exclaimed\nBarrois, \"a great misfortune has happened. Madame de Saint-Meran has\narrived, and her husband is dead!\"\n\nM. de Saint-Meran and Noirtier had never been on strict terms of\nfriendship; still, the death of one old man always considerably\naffects another. Noirtier let his head fall upon his chest, apparently\noverwhelmed and thoughtful; then he closed one eye, in token of inquiry.\n\"Mademoiselle Valentine?\" Noirtier nodded his head. \"She is at the\nball, as you know, since she came to say good-by to you in full dress.\"\nNoirtier again closed his left eye. \"Do you wish to see her?\" Noirtier\nagain made an affirmative sign. \"Well, they have gone to fetch her, no\ndoubt, from Madame de Morcerf's; I will await her return, and beg her to\ncome up here. Is that what you wish for?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the invalid.\n\nBarrois, therefore, as we have seen, watched for Valentine, and informed\nher of her grandfather's wish. Consequently, Valentine came up to\nNoirtier, on leaving Madame de Saint-Meran, who in the midst of her\ngrief had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep.\nWithin reach of her hand they placed a small table upon which stood a\nbottle of orangeade, her usual beverage, and a glass. Then, as we have\nsaid, the young girl left the bedside to see M. Noirtier. Valentine\nkissed the old man, who looked at her with such tenderness that her eyes\nagain filled with tears, whose sources he thought must be exhausted.\nThe old gentleman continued to dwell upon her with the same expression.\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Valentine, \"you mean that I have yet a kind grandfather\nleft, do you not.\" The old man intimated that such was his meaning.\n\"Ah, yes, happily I have,\" replied Valentine. \"Without that, what would\nbecome of me?\"\n\nIt was one o'clock in the morning. Barrois, who wished to go to bed\nhimself, observed that after such sad events every one stood in need of\nrest. Noirtier would not say that the only rest he needed was to see\nhis child, but wished her good-night, for grief and fatigue had made her\nappear quite ill. The next morning she found her grandmother in bed;\nthe fever had not abated, on the contrary her eyes glistened and she\nappeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability. \"Oh, dear\ngrandmamma, are you worse?\" exclaimed Valentine, perceiving all these\nsigns of agitation.\n\n\"No, my child, no,\" said Madame de Saint-Meran; \"but I was impatiently\nwaiting for your arrival, that I might send for your father.\"\n\n\"My father?\" inquired Valentine, uneasily.\n\n\"Yes, I wish to speak to him.\" Valentine durst not oppose her\ngrandmother's wish, the cause of which she did not know, and an instant\nafterwards Villefort entered. \"Sir,\" said Madame de Saint-Meran, without\nusing any circumlocution, and as if fearing she had no time to lose,\n\"you wrote to me concerning the marriage of this child?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame,\" replied Villefort, \"it is not only projected but\narranged.\"\n\n\"Your intended son-in-law is named M. Franz d'Epinay?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\n\"Is he not the son of General d'Epinay who was on our side, and who was\nassassinated some days before the usurper returned from the Island of\nElba?\"\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"Does he not dislike the idea of marrying the granddaughter of a\nJacobin?\"\n\n\"Our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished, mother,\" said\nVillefort; \"M. d'Epinay was quite a child when his father died, he knows\nvery little of M. Noirtier, and will meet him, if not with pleasure, at\nleast with indifference.\"\n\n\"Is it a suitable match?\"\n\n\"In every respect.\"\n\n\"And the young man?\"\n\n\"Is regarded with universal esteem.\"\n\n\"You approve of him?\"\n\n\"He is one of the most well-bred young men I know.\" During the whole\nof this conversation Valentine had remained silent. \"Well, sir,\" said\nMadame de Saint-Meran, after a few minutes' reflection, \"I must hasten\nthe marriage, for I have but a short time to live.\"\n\n\"You, madame?\" \"You, dear mamma?\" exclaimed M. de Villefort and\nValentine at the same time.\n\n\"I know what I am saying,\" continued the marchioness; \"I must hurry you,\nso that, as she has no mother, she may at least have a grandmother to\nbless her marriage. I am all that is left to her belonging to my poor\nRenee, whom you have so soon forgotten, sir.\"\n\n\"Ah, madame,\" said Villefort, \"you forget that I was obliged to give a\nmother to my child.\"\n\n\"A stepmother is never a mother, sir. But this is not to the\npurpose,--our business concerns Valentine, let us leave the dead in\npeace.\"\n\nAll this was said with such exceeding rapidity, that there was something\nin the conversation that seemed like the beginning of delirium.\n\n\"It shall be as you wish, madame,\" said Villefort; \"more especially\nsince your wishes coincide with mine, and as soon as M. d'Epinay arrives\nin Paris\"--\n\n\"My dear grandmother,\" interrupted Valentine, \"consider decorum--the\nrecent death. You would not have me marry under such sad auspices?\"\n\n\"My child,\" exclaimed the old lady sharply, \"let us hear none of the\nconventional objections that deter weak minds from preparing for the\nfuture. I also was married at the death-bed of my mother, and certainly\nI have not been less happy on that account.\"\n\n\"Still that idea of death, madame,\" said Villefort.\n\n\"Still?--Always! I tell you I am going to die--do you understand? Well,\nbefore dying, I wish to see my son-in-law. I wish to tell him to make\nmy child happy; I wish to read in his eyes whether he intends to obey\nme;--in fact, I will know him--I will!\" continued the old lady, with a\nfearful expression, \"that I may rise from the depths of my grave to find\nhim, if he should not fulfil his duty!\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said Villefort, \"you must lay aside these exalted ideas, which\nalmost assume the appearance of madness. The dead, once buried in their\ngraves, rise no more.\"\n\n\"And I tell you, sir, that you are mistaken. This night I have had a\nfearful sleep. It seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my\nbody, my eyes, which I tried to open, closed against my will, and what\nwill appear impossible above all to you, sir, I saw, with my eyes shut,\nin the spot where you are now standing, issuing from that corner where\nthere is a door leading into Madame Villefort's dressing-room--I saw, I\ntell you, silently enter, a white figure.\" Valentine screamed. \"It was\nthe fever that disturbed you, madame,\" said Villefort.\n\n\"Doubt, if you please, but I am sure of what I say. I saw a white\nfigure, and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only one\nof my senses, I heard my glass removed--the same which is there now on\nthe table.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear mother, it was a dream.\"\n\n\"So little was it a dream, that I stretched my hand towards the bell;\nbut when I did so, the shade disappeared; my maid then entered with a\nlight.\"\n\n\"But she saw no one?\"\n\n\"Phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them. It was the\nsoul of my husband!--Well, if my husband's soul can come to me, why\nshould not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter? the tie is even\nmore direct, it seems to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, madame,\" said Villefort, deeply affected, in spite of himself, \"do\nnot yield to those gloomy thoughts; you will long live with us, happy,\nloved, and honored, and we will make you forget\"--\n\n\"Never, never, never,\" said the marchioness. \"When does M. d'Epinay\nreturn?\"\n\n\"We expect him every moment.\"\n\n\"It is well. As soon as he arrives inform me. We must be expeditious.\nAnd then I also wish to see a notary, that I may be assured that all our\nproperty returns to Valentine.\"\n\n\"Ah, grandmamma,\" murmured Valentine, pressing her lips on the burning\nbrow, \"do you wish to kill me? Oh, how feverish you are; we must not\nsend for a notary, but for a doctor.\"\n\n\"A doctor?\" said she, shrugging her shoulders, \"I am not ill; I am\nthirsty--that is all.\"\n\n\"What are you drinking, dear grandmamma?\"\n\n\"The same as usual, my dear, my glass is there on the table--give it to\nme, Valentine.\" Valentine poured the orangeade into a glass and gave it\nto her grandmother with a certain degree of dread, for it was the same\nglass she fancied that had been touched by the spectre. The marchioness\ndrained the glass at a single draught, and then turned on her pillow,\nrepeating,--\"The notary, the notary!\"\n\nM. de Villefort left the room, and Valentine seated herself at the\nbedside of her grandmother. The poor child appeared herself to require\nthe doctor she had recommended to her aged relative. A bright spot\nburned in either cheek, her respiration was short and difficult, and her\npulse beat with feverish excitement. She was thinking of the despair\nof Maximilian, when he should be informed that Madame de Saint-Meran,\ninstead of being an ally, was unconsciously acting as his enemy. More\nthan once she thought of revealing all to her grandmother, and she would\nnot have hesitated a moment, if Maximilian Morrel had been named Albert\nde Morcerf or Raoul de Chateau-Renaud; but Morrel was of plebeian\nextraction, and Valentine knew how the haughty Marquise de Saint-Meran\ndespised all who were not noble. Her secret had each time been repressed\nwhen she was about to reveal it, by the sad conviction that it would be\nuseless to do so; for, were it once discovered by her father and mother,\nall would be lost. Two hours passed thus; Madame de Saint-Meran was in\na feverish sleep, and the notary had arrived. Though his coming was\nannounced in a very low tone, Madame de Saint-Meran arose from her\npillow. \"The notary!\" she exclaimed, \"let him come in.\"\n\nThe notary, who was at the door, immediately entered. \"Go, Valentine,\"\nsaid Madame de Saint-Meran, \"and leave me with this gentleman.\"\n\n\"But, grandmamma\"--\n\n\"Leave me--go!\" The young girl kissed her grandmother, and left with her\nhandkerchief to her eyes; at the door she found the valet de chambre,\nwho told her that the doctor was waiting in the dining-room. Valentine\ninstantly ran down. The doctor was a friend of the family, and at\nthe same time one of the cleverest men of the day, and very fond of\nValentine, whose birth he had witnessed. He had himself a daughter about\nher age, but whose life was one continued source of anxiety and fear to\nhim from her mother having been consumptive.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Valentine, \"we have been waiting for you with such\nimpatience, dear M. d'Avrigny. But, first of all, how are Madeleine and\nAntoinette?\" Madeleine was the daughter of M. d'Avrigny, and Antoinette\nhis niece. M. d'Avrigny smiled sadly. \"Antoinette is very well,\" he\nsaid, \"and Madeleine tolerably so. But you sent for me, my dear child.\nIt is not your father or Madame de Villefort who is ill. As for you,\nalthough we doctors cannot divest our patients of nerves, I fancy you\nhave no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your\nimagination to take too wide a field.\" Valentine colored. M. d'Avrigny\ncarried the science of divination almost to a miraculous extent, for\nhe was one of the physicians who always work upon the body through the\nmind. \"No,\" she replied, \"it is for my poor grandmother. You know the\ncalamity that has happened to us, do you not?\"\n\n\"I know nothing.\" said M. d'Avrigny.\n\n\"Alas,\" said Valentine, restraining her tears, \"my grandfather is dead.\"\n\n\"M. de Saint-Meran?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Suddenly?\"\n\n\"From an apoplectic stroke.\"\n\n\"An apoplectic stroke?\" repeated the doctor.\n\n\"Yes, and my poor grandmother fancies that her husband, whom she\nnever left, has called her, and that she must go and join him. Oh, M.\nd'Avrigny, I beseech you, do something for her!\"\n\n\"Where is she?\"\n\n\"In her room with the notary.\"\n\n\"And M. Noirtier?\"\n\n\"Just as he was, his mind perfectly clear, but the same incapability of\nmoving or speaking.\"\n\n\"And the same love for you--eh, my dear child?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Valentine, \"he was very fond of me.\"\n\n\"Who does not love you?\" Valentine smiled sadly. \"What are your\ngrandmother's symptoms?\"\n\n\"An extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep; she\nfancied this morning in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her\nbody, which she at the same time watched. It must have been delirium;\nshe fancies, too, that she saw a phantom enter her chamber and even\nheard the noise it made on touching her glass.\"\n\n\"It is singular,\" said the doctor; \"I was not aware that Madame de\nSaint-Meran was subject to such hallucinations.\"\n\n\"It is the first time I ever saw her in this condition,\" said Valentine;\n\"and this morning she frightened me so that I thought her mad; and my\nfather, who you know is a strong-minded man, himself appeared deeply\nimpressed.\"\n\n\"We will go and see,\" said the doctor; \"what you tell me seems very\nstrange.\" The notary here descended, and Valentine was informed that her\ngrandmother was alone. \"Go upstairs,\" she said to the doctor.\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I dare not--she forbade my sending for you; and, as you say, I am\nmyself agitated, feverish and out of sorts. I will go and take a turn in\nthe garden to recover myself.\" The doctor pressed Valentine's hand, and\nwhile he visited her grandmother, she descended the steps. We need not\nsay which portion of the garden was her favorite walk. After remaining\nfor a short time in the parterre surrounding the house, and gathering\na rose to place in her waist or hair, she turned into the dark avenue\nwhich led to the bench; then from the bench she went to the gate.\nAs usual, Valentine strolled for a short time among her flowers, but\nwithout gathering them. The mourning in her heart forbade her assuming\nthis simple ornament, though she had not yet had time to put on the\noutward semblance of woe. She then turned towards the avenue. As she\nadvanced she fancied she heard a voice speaking her name. She stopped\nastonished, then the voice reached her ear more distinctly, and she\nrecognized it to be that of Maximilian.\n\n\n\nChapter 73. The Promise.\n\nIt was, indeed, Maximilian Morrel, who had passed a wretched existence\nsince the previous day. With the instinct peculiar to lovers he had\nanticipated after the return of Madame de Saint-Meran and the death\nof the marquis, that something would occur at M. de Villefort's in\nconnection with his attachment for Valentine. His presentiments were\nrealized, as we shall see, and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him\npale and trembling to the gate under the chestnut-trees. Valentine was\nignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety, and as it was not his\naccustomed hour for visiting her, she had gone to the spot simply by\naccident or perhaps through sympathy. Morrel called her, and she ran\nto the gate. \"You here at this hour?\" said she. \"Yes, my poor girl,\"\nreplied Morrel; \"I come to bring and to hear bad tidings.\"\n\n\"This is, indeed, a house of mourning,\" said Valentine; \"speak,\nMaximilian, although the cup of sorrow seems already full.\"\n\n\"Dear Valentine,\" said Morrel, endeavoring to conceal his own emotion,\n\"listen, I entreat you; what I am about to say is very serious. When are\nyou to be married?\"\n\n\"I will tell you all,\" said Valentine; \"from you I have nothing\nto conceal. This morning the subject was introduced, and my dear\ngrandmother, on whom I depended as my only support, not only declared\nherself favorable to it, but is so anxious for it, that they only await\nthe arrival of M. d'Epinay, and the following day the contract will\nbe signed.\" A deep sigh escaped the young man, who gazed long and\nmournfully at her he loved. \"Alas,\" replied he, \"it is dreadful thus to\nhear my condemnation from your own lips. The sentence is passed, and, in\na few hours, will be executed; it must be so, and I will not endeavor\nto prevent it. But, since you say nothing remains but for M. d'Epinay to\narrive that the contract may be signed, and the following day you will\nbe his, to-morrow you will be engaged to M. d'Epinay, for he came this\nmorning to Paris.\" Valentine uttered a cry.\n\n\"I was at the house of Monte Cristo an hour since,\" said Morrel; \"we\nwere speaking, he of the sorrow your family had experienced, and I of\nyour grief, when a carriage rolled into the court-yard. Never, till\nthen, had I placed any confidence in presentiments, but now I cannot\nhelp believing them, Valentine. At the sound of that carriage I\nshuddered; soon I heard steps on the staircase, which terrified me as\nmuch as the footsteps of the commander did Don Juan. The door at last\nopened; Albert de Morcerf entered first, and I began to hope my fears\nwere vain, when, after him, another young man advanced, and the count\nexclaimed--'Ah, here is the Baron Franz d'Epinay!' I summoned all my\nstrength and courage to my support. Perhaps I turned pale and trembled,\nbut certainly I smiled; and five minutes after I left, without having\nheard one word that had passed.\"\n\n\"Poor Maximilian!\" murmured Valentine.\n\n\"Valentine, the time has arrived when you must answer me. And remember\nmy life depends on your answer. What do you intend doing?\" Valentine\nheld down her head; she was overwhelmed.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Morrel; \"it is not the first time you have contemplated\nour present position, which is a serious and urgent one; I do not think\nit is a moment to give way to useless sorrow; leave that for those who\nlike to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in secret. There\nare such in the world, and God will doubtless reward them in heaven for\ntheir resignation on earth, but those who mean to contend must not lose\none precious moment, but must return immediately the blow which fortune\nstrikes. Do you intend to struggle against our ill-fortune? Tell me,\nValentine for it is that I came to know.\"\n\nValentine trembled, and looked at him with amazement. The idea of\nresisting her father, her grandmother, and all the family, had never\noccurred to her. \"What do you say, Maximilian?\" asked Valentine. \"What\ndo you mean by a struggle? Oh, it would be a sacrilege. What? I resist\nmy father's order, and my dying grandmother's wish? Impossible!\" Morrel\nstarted. \"You are too noble not to understand me, and you understand me\nso well that you already yield, dear Maximilian. No, no; I shall need\nall my strength to struggle with myself and support my grief in secret,\nas you say. But to grieve my father--to disturb my grandmother's last\nmoments--never!\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said Morrel, calmly.\n\n\"In what a tone you speak!\" cried Valentine.\n\n\"I speak as one who admires you, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" cried Valentine; \"mademoiselle! Oh, selfish man,--he\nsees me in despair, and pretends he cannot understand me!\"\n\n\"You mistake--I understand you perfectly. You will not oppose M.\nVillefort, you will not displease the marchioness, and to-morrow you\nwill sign the contract which will bind you to your husband.\"\n\n\"But, mon Dieu, tell me, how can I do otherwise?\"\n\n\"Do not appeal to me, mademoiselle; I shall be a bad judge in such a\ncase; my selfishness will blind me,\" replied Morrel, whose low voice and\nclinched hands announced his growing desperation.\n\n\"What would you have proposed, Maximilian, had you found me willing to\naccede?\"\n\n\"It is not for me to say.\"\n\n\"You are wrong; you must advise me what to do.\"\n\n\"Do you seriously ask my advice, Valentine?\"\n\n\"Certainly, dear Maximilian, for if it is good, I will follow it; you\nknow my devotion to you.\"\n\n\"Valentine,\" said Morrel pushing aside a loose plank, \"give me your hand\nin token of forgiveness of my anger; my senses are confused, and during\nthe last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through my\nbrain. Oh, if you refuse my advice\"--\n\n\"What do you advise?\" said Valentine, raising her eyes to heaven and\nsighing. \"I am free,\" replied Maximilian, \"and rich enough to support\nyou. I swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have\napproached your forehead.\"\n\n\"You make me tremble!\" said the young girl.\n\n\"Follow me,\" said Morrel; \"I will take you to my sister, who is worthy\nalso to be yours. We will embark for Algiers, for England, for America,\nor, if you prefer it, retire to the country and only return to Paris\nwhen our friends have reconciled your family.\" Valentine shook her head.\n\"I feared it, Maximilian,\" said she; \"it is the counsel of a madman, and\nI should be more mad than you, did I not stop you at once with the word\n'Impossible, impossible!'\"\n\n\"You will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even\nattempting to contend with it?\" said Morrel sorrowfully. \"Yes,--if I\ndie!\"\n\n\"Well, Valentine,\" resumed Maximilian, \"I can only say again that you\nare right. Truly, it is I who am mad, and you prove to me that passion\nblinds the most well-meaning. I appreciate your calm reasoning. It is\nthen understood that to-morrow you will be irrevocably promised to\nM. Franz d'Epinay, not only by that theatrical formality invented to\nheighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the contract,\nbut your own will?\"\n\n\"Again you drive me to despair, Maximilian,\" said Valentine, \"again you\nplunge the dagger into the wound! What would you do, tell me, if your\nsister listened to such a proposition?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" replied Morrel with a bitter smile, \"I am selfish--you\nhave already said so--and as a selfish man I think not of what others\nwould do in my situation, but of what I intend doing myself. I think\nonly that I have known you not a whole year. From the day I first saw\nyou, all my hopes of happiness have been in securing your affection. One\nday you acknowledged that you loved me, and since that day my hope of\nfuture happiness has rested on obtaining you, for to gain you would be\nlife to me. Now, I think no more; I say only that fortune has turned\nagainst me--I had thought to gain heaven, and now I have lost it. It is\nan every-day occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses\nbut also what he has not.\" Morrel pronounced these words with perfect\ncalmness; Valentine looked at him a moment with her large, scrutinizing\neyes, endeavoring not to let Morrel discover the grief which struggled\nin her heart. \"But, in a word, what are you going to do?\" asked she.\n\n\"I am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you, mademoiselle,\nsolemnly assuring you that I wish your life may be so calm, so happy,\nand so fully occupied, that there may be no place for me even in your\nmemory.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" murmured Valentine.\n\n\"Adieu, Valentine, adieu!\" said Morrel, bowing.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" cried the young girl, extending her hand through\nthe opening, and seizing Maximilian by his coat, for she understood from\nher own agitated feelings that her lover's calmness could not be real;\n\"where are you going?\"\n\n\"I am going, that I may not bring fresh trouble into your family: and to\nset an example which every honest and devoted man, situated as I am, may\nfollow.\"\n\n\"Before you leave me, tell me what you are going to do, Maximilian.\" The\nyoung man smiled sorrowfully. \"Speak, speak!\" said Valentine; \"I entreat\nyou.\"\n\n\"Has your resolution changed, Valentine?\"\n\n\"It cannot change, unhappy man; you know it must not!\" cried the young\ngirl. \"Then adieu, Valentine!\" Valentine shook the gate with a strength\nof which she could not have been supposed to be possessed, as Morrel was\ngoing away, and passing both her hands through the opening, she clasped\nand wrung them. \"I must know what you mean to do!\" said she. \"Where are\nyou going?\"\n\n\"Oh, fear not,\" said Maximilian, stopping at a short distance, \"I do not\nintend to render another man responsible for the rigorous fate reserved\nfor me. Another might threaten to seek M. Franz, to provoke him, and to\nfight with him; all that would be folly. What has M. Franz to do with\nit? He saw me this morning for the first time, and has already forgotten\nhe has seen me. He did not even know I existed when it was arranged by\nyour two families that you should be united. I have no enmity against M.\nFranz, and promise you the punishment shall not fall on him.\"\n\n\"On whom, then!--on me?\"\n\n\"On you? Valentine! Oh, heaven forbid! Woman is sacred; the woman one\nloves is holy.\"\n\n\"On yourself, then, unhappy man; on yourself?\"\n\n\"I am the only guilty person, am I not?\" said Maximilian.\n\n\"Maximilian!\" said Valentine, \"Maximilian, come back, I entreat you!\" He\ndrew near with his sweet smile, and but for his paleness one might\nhave thought him in his usual happy mood. \"Listen, my dear, my adored\nValentine,\" said he in his melodious and grave tone; \"those who, like\nus, have never had a thought for which we need blush before the world,\nsuch may read each other's hearts. I never was romantic, and am no\nmelancholy hero. I imitate neither Manfred nor Anthony; but without\nwords, protestations, or vows, my life has entwined itself with yours;\nyou leave me, and you are right in doing so,--I repeat it, you are\nright; but in losing you, I lose my life.\n\n\"The moment you leave me, Valentine, I am alone in the world. My sister\nis happily married; her husband is only my brother-in-law, that is, a\nman whom the ties of social life alone attach to me; no one then longer\nneeds my useless life. This is what I shall do; I will wait until the\nvery moment you are married, for I will not lose the shadow of one of\nthose unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us, since M.\nFranz may, after all, die before that time, a thunderbolt may fall even\non the altar as you approach it,--nothing appears impossible to one\ncondemned to die, and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape\nfrom death is concerned. I will, then, wait until the last moment,\nand when my misery is certain, irremediable, hopeless, I will write\na confidential letter to my brother-in-law, another to the prefect of\npolice, to acquaint them with my intention, and at the corner of some\nwood, on the brink of some abyss, on the bank of some river, I will put\nan end to my existence, as certainly as I am the son of the most honest\nman who ever lived in France.\"\n\nValentine trembled convulsively; she loosened her hold of the gate, her\narms fell by her side, and two large tears rolled down her cheeks. The\nyoung man stood before her, sorrowful and resolute. \"Oh, for pity's\nsake,\" said she, \"you will live, will you not?\"\n\n\"No, on my honor,\" said Maximilian; \"but that will not affect you. You\nhave done your duty, and your conscience will be at rest.\" Valentine\nfell on her knees, and pressed her almost bursting heart. \"Maximilian,\"\nsaid she, \"Maximilian, my friend, my brother on earth, my true husband\nin heaven, I entreat you, do as I do, live in suffering; perhaps we may\none day be united.\"\n\n\"Adieu, Valentine,\" repeated Morrel.\n\n\"My God,\" said Valentine, raising both her hands to heaven with a\nsublime expression, \"I have done my utmost to remain a submissive\ndaughter; I have begged, entreated, implored; he has regarded neither\nmy prayers, my entreaties, nor my tears. It is done,\" cried she, willing\naway her tears, and resuming her firmness, \"I am resolved not to die of\nremorse, but rather of shame. Live, Maximilian, and I will be yours. Say\nwhen shall it be? Speak, command, I will obey.\" Morrel, who had already\ngone some few steps away, again returned, and pale with joy extended\nboth hands towards Valentine through the opening. \"Valentine,\" said he,\n\"dear Valentine, you must not speak thus--rather let me die. Why\nshould I obtain you by violence, if our love is mutual? Is it from mere\nhumanity you bid me live? I would then rather die.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" murmured Valentine, \"who on this earth cares for me, if he does\nnot? Who has consoled me in my sorrow but he? On whom do my hopes rest?\nOn whom does my bleeding heart repose? On him, on him, always on him!\nYes, you are right, Maximilian, I will follow you. I will leave the\npaternal home, I will give up all. Oh, ungrateful girl that I am,\" cried\nValentine, sobbing, \"I will give up all, even my dear old grandfather,\nwhom I had nearly forgotten.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Maximilian, \"you shall not leave him. M. Noirtier has\nevinced, you say, a kind feeling towards me. Well, before you leave,\ntell him all; his consent would be your justification in God's sight. As\nsoon as we are married, he shall come and live with us, instead of one\nchild, he shall have two. You have told me how you talk to him and\nhow he answers you; I shall very soon learn that language by signs,\nValentine, and I promise you solemnly, that instead of despair, it is\nhappiness that awaits us.\"\n\n\"Oh, see, Maximilian, see the power you have over me, you almost make\nme believe you; and yet, what you tell me is madness, for my father will\ncurse me--he is inflexible--he will never pardon me. Now listen to me,\nMaximilian; if by artifice, by entreaty, by accident--in short, if by\nany means I can delay this marriage, will you wait?\"\n\n\"Yes, I promise you, as faithfully as you have promised me that this\nhorrible marriage shall not take place, and that if you are dragged\nbefore a magistrate or a priest, you will refuse.\"\n\n\"I promise you by all that is most sacred to me in the world, namely, by\nmy mother.\"\n\n\"We will wait, then,\" said Morrel.\n\n\"Yes, we will wait,\" replied Valentine, who revived at these words;\n\"there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such as we are.\"\n\n\"I rely on you, Valentine,\" said Morrel; \"all you do will be well\ndone; only if they disregard your prayers, if your father and Madame de\nSaint-Meran insist that M. d'Epinay should be called to-morrow to sign\nthe contract\"--\n\n\"Then you have my promise, Maximilian.\"\n\n\"Instead of signing\"--\n\n\"I will go to you, and we will fly; but from this moment until then, let\nus not tempt providence, let us not see each other. It is a miracle, it\nis a providence that we have not been discovered. If we were surprised,\nif it were known that we met thus, we should have no further resource.\"\n\n\"You are right, Valentine; but how shall I ascertain?\"\n\n\"From the notary, M. Deschamps.\"\n\n\"I know him.\"\n\n\"And for myself--I will write to you, depend on me. I dread this\nmarriage, Maximilian, as much as you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my adored Valentine, thank you; that is enough. When once I\nknow the hour, I will hasten to this spot, you can easily get over this\nfence with my assistance, a carriage will await us at the gate, in which\nyou will accompany me to my sister's; there living, retired or mingling\nin society, as you wish, we shall be enabled to use our power to resist\noppression, and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like sheep,\nwhich only defend themselves by sighs.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Valentine, \"I will now acknowledge you are right,\nMaximilian; and now are you satisfied with your betrothal?\" said the\nyoung girl sorrowfully.\n\n\"My adored Valentine, words cannot express one half of my satisfaction.\"\nValentine had approached, or rather, had placed her lips so near the\nfence, that they nearly touched those of Morrel, which were pressed\nagainst the other side of the cold and inexorable barrier. \"Adieu, then,\ntill we meet again,\" said Valentine, tearing herself away. \"I shall hear\nfrom you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Thanks, thanks, dear love, adieu!\" The sound of a kiss was heard, and\nValentine fled through the avenue. Morrel listened to catch the last\nsound of her dress brushing the branches, and of her footstep on the\ngravel, then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of thankfulness to\nheaven for being permitted to be thus loved, and then also disappeared.\nThe young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the next\nday without getting any message. It was only on the following day,\nat about ten o'clock in the morning, as he was starting to call on M.\nDeschamps, the notary, that he received from the postman a small billet,\nwhich he knew to be from Valentine, although he had not before seen her\nwriting. It was to this effect:--\n\nTears, entreaties, prayers, have availed me nothing. Yesterday, for\ntwo hours, I was at the church of Saint-Phillippe du Roule, and for two\nhours I prayed most fervently. Heaven is as inflexible as man, and the\nsignature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine o'clock. I\nhave but one promise and but one heart to give; that promise is pledged\nto you, that heart is also yours. This evening, then, at a quarter to\nnine at the gate.\n\nYour betrothed,\n\nValentine de Villefort.\n\nP.S.--My poor grandmother gets worse and worse; yesterday her fever\namounted to delirium; to-day her delirium is almost madness. You will\nbe very kind to me, will you not, Morrel, to make me forget my sorrow in\nleaving her thus? I think it is kept a secret from grandpapa Noirtier,\nthat the contract is to be signed this evening.\n\nMorrel went also to the notary, who confirmed the news that the contract\nwas to be signed that evening. Then he went to call on Monte Cristo and\nheard still more. Franz had been to announce the ceremony, and Madame de\nVillefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting\nhim; the death of M. de Saint-Meran and the dangerous illness of his\nwidow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should\nbe shared by the count whom she wished every happiness. The day before\nFranz had been presented to Madame de Saint-Meran, who had left her bed\nto receive him, but had been obliged to return to it immediately after.\nIt is easy to suppose that Morrel's agitation would not escape the\ncount's penetrating eye. Monte Cristo was more affectionate than\never,--indeed, his manner was so kind that several times Morrel was on\nthe point of telling him all. But he recalled the promise he had made to\nValentine, and kept his secret.\n\nThe young man read Valentine's letter twenty times in the course of the\nday. It was her first, and on what an occasion! Each time he read it he\nrenewed his vow to make her happy. How great is the power of a woman who\nhas made so courageous a resolution! What devotion does she deserve from\nhim for whom she has sacrificed everything! How ought she really to\nbe supremely loved! She becomes at once a queen and a wife, and it is\nimpossible to thank and love her sufficiently. Morrel longed intensely\nfor the moment when he should hear Valentine say, \"Here I am,\nMaximilian; come and help me.\" He had arranged everything for her\nescape; two ladders were hidden in the clover-field; a cabriolet was\nordered for Maximilian alone, without a servant, without lights; at the\nturning of the first street they would light the lamps, as it would be\nfoolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions.\nOccasionally he shuddered; he thought of the moment when, from the\ntop of that wall, he should protect the descent of his dear Valentine,\npressing in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only\nkissed the delicate hand.\n\nWhen the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near,\nhe wished for solitude, his agitation was extreme; a simple question\nfrom a friend would have irritated him. He shut himself in his room, and\ntried to read, but his eye glanced over the page without understanding\na word, and he threw away the book, and for the second time sat down\nto sketch his plan, the ladders and the fence. At length the hour\ndrew near. Never did a man deeply in love allow the clocks to go on\npeacefully. Morrel tormented his so effectually that they struck eight\nat half-past six. He then said, \"It is time to start; the signature was\nindeed fixed to take place at nine o'clock, but perhaps Valentine will\nnot wait for that.\" Consequently, Morrel, having left the Rue Meslay\nat half-past eight by his timepiece, entered the clover-field while\nthe clock of Saint-Phillippe du Roule was striking eight. The horse and\ncabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin, where Morrel had often\nwaited.\n\nThe night gradually drew on, and the foliage in the garden assumed a\ndeeper hue. Then Morrel came out from his hiding-place with a beating\nheart, and looked through the small opening in the gate; there was yet\nno one to be seen. The clock struck half-past eight, and still another\nhalf-hour was passed in waiting, while Morrel walked to and fro, and\ngazed more and more frequently through the opening. The garden became\ndarker still, but in the darkness he looked in vain for the white dress,\nand in the silence he vainly listened for the sound of footsteps. The\nhouse, which was discernible through the trees, remained in darkness,\nand gave no indication that so important an event as the signature of a\nmarriage-contract was going on. Morrel looked at his watch, which wanted\na quarter to ten; but soon the same clock he had already heard strike\ntwo or three times rectified the error by striking half-past nine.\n\nThis was already half an hour past the time Valentine had fixed. It\nwas a terrible moment for the young man. The slightest rustling of the\nfoliage, the least whistling of the wind, attracted his attention, and\ndrew the perspiration to his brow; then he tremblingly fixed his ladder,\nand, not to lose a moment, placed his foot on the first step. Amidst\nall these alternations of hope and fear, the clock struck ten. \"It is\nimpossible,\" said Maximilian, \"that the signing of a contract should\noccupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions. I have weighed\nall the chances, calculated the time required for all the forms;\nsomething must have happened.\" And then he walked rapidly to and fro,\nand pressed his burning forehead against the fence. Had Valentine\nfainted? or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight? These\nwere the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man.\n\nThe idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape,\nand that she had fainted in one of the paths, was the one that most\nimpressed itself upon his mind. \"In that case,\" said he, \"I should lose\nher, and by my own fault.\" He dwelt on this idea for a moment, then it\nappeared reality. He even thought he could perceive something on the\nground at a distance; he ventured to call, and it seemed to him that\nthe wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh. At last the half-hour\nstruck. It was impossible to wait longer, his temples throbbed\nviolently, his eyes were growing dim; he passed one leg over the wall,\nand in a moment leaped down on the other side. He was on Villefort's\npremises--had arrived there by scaling the wall. What might be the\nconsequences? However, he had not ventured thus far to draw back. He\nfollowed a short distance close under the wall, then crossed a path, hid\nentered a clump of trees. In a moment he had passed through them, and\ncould see the house distinctly. Then Morrel saw that he had been right\nin believing that the house was not illuminated. Instead of lights at\nevery window, as is customary on days of ceremony, he saw only a gray\nmass, which was veiled also by a cloud, which at that moment obscured\nthe moon's feeble light. A light moved rapidly from time to time past\nthree windows of the second floor. These three windows were in Madame de\nSaint-Meran's room. Another remained motionless behind some red curtains\nwhich were in Madame de Villefort's bedroom. Morrel guessed all this. So\nmany times, in order to follow Valentine in thought at every hour in the\nday, had he made her describe the whole house, that without having seen\nit he knew it all.\n\nThis darkness and silence alarmed Morrel still more than Valentine's\nabsence had done. Almost mad with grief, and determined to venture\neverything in order to see Valentine once more, and be certain of the\nmisfortune he feared, Morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees, and\nwas going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower-garden, when\nthe sound of a voice, still at some distance, but which was borne upon\nthe wind, reached him.\n\nAt this sound, as he was already partially exposed to view, he stepped\nback and concealed himself completely, remaining perfectly motionless.\nHe had formed his resolution. If it was Valentine alone, he would speak\nas she passed; if she was accompanied, and he could not speak, still he\nshould see her, and know that she was safe; if they were strangers, he\nwould listen to their conversation, and might understand something of\nthis hitherto incomprehensible mystery. The moon had just then escaped\nfrom behind the cloud which had concealed it, and Morrel saw Villefort\ncome out upon the steps, followed by a gentleman in black. They\ndescended, and advanced towards the clump of trees, and Morrel soon\nrecognized the other gentleman as Doctor d'Avrigny.\n\nThe young man, seeing them approach, drew back mechanically, until he\nfound himself stopped by a sycamore-tree in the centre of the clump;\nthere he was compelled to remain. Soon the two gentlemen stopped also.\n\n\"Ah, my dear doctor,\" said the procureur, \"heaven declares itself\nagainst my house! What a dreadful death--what a blow! Seek not to\nconsole me; alas, nothing can alleviate so great a sorrow--the wound is\ntoo deep and too fresh! Dead, dead!\" The cold sweat sprang to the young\nman's brow, and his teeth chattered. Who could be dead in that house,\nwhich Villefort himself had called accursed? \"My dear M. de Villefort,\"\nreplied the doctor, with a tone which redoubled the terror of the young\nman, \"I have not led you here to console you; on the contrary\"--\n\n\"What can you mean?\" asked the procureur, alarmed.\n\n\"I mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you, there\nis another, perhaps, still greater.\"\n\n\"Can it be possible?\" murmured Villefort, clasping his hands. \"What are\nyou going to tell me?\"\n\n\"Are we quite alone, my friend?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite; but why all these precautions?\"\n\n\"Because I have a terrible secret to communicate to you,\" said the\ndoctor. \"Let us sit down.\"\n\nVillefort fell, rather than seated himself. The doctor stood before him,\nwith one hand placed on his shoulder. Morrel, horrified, supported\nhis head with one hand, and with the other pressed his heart, lest its\nbeatings should be heard. \"Dead, dead!\" repeated he within himself; and\nhe felt as if he were also dying.\n\n\"Speak, doctor--I am listening,\" said Villefort; \"strike--I am prepared\nfor everything!\"\n\n\"Madame de Saint-Meran was, doubtless, advancing in years, but she\nenjoyed excellent health.\" Morrel began again to breathe freely, which\nhe had not done during the last ten minutes.\n\n\"Grief has consumed her,\" said Villefort--\"yes, grief, doctor! After\nliving forty years with the marquis\"--\n\n\"It is not grief, my dear Villefort,\" said the doctor; \"grief may kill,\nalthough it rarely does, and never in a day, never in an hour, never\nin ten minutes.\" Villefort answered nothing, he simply raised his\nhead, which had been cast down before, and looked at the doctor with\namazement.\n\n\"Were you present during the last struggle?\" asked M. d'Avrigny.\n\n\"I was,\" replied the procureur; \"you begged me not to leave.\"\n\n\"Did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which Madame de\nSaint-Meran has fallen a victim?\"\n\n\"I did. Madame de Saint-Meran had three successive attacks, at intervals\nof some minutes, each one more serious than the former. When you\narrived, Madame de Saint-Meran had already been panting for breath some\nminutes; she then had a fit, which I took to be simply a nervous attack,\nand it was only when I saw her raise herself in the bed, and her\nlimbs and neck appear stiffened, that I became really alarmed. Then\nI understood from your countenance there was more to fear than I had\nthought. This crisis past, I endeavored to catch your eye, but could\nnot. You held her hand--you were feeling her pulse--and the second fit\ncame on before you had turned towards me. This was more terrible than\nthe first; the same nervous movements were repeated, and the mouth\ncontracted and turned purple.\"\n\n\"And at the third she expired.\"\n\n\"At the end of the first attack I discovered symptoms of tetanus; you\nconfirmed my opinion.\"\n\n\"Yes, before others,\" replied the doctor; \"but now we are alone\"--\n\n\"What are you going to say? Oh, spare me!\"\n\n\"That the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are\nthe same.\" M. de Villefort started from his seat, then in a moment fell\ndown again, silent and motionless. Morrel knew not if he were dreaming\nor awake. \"Listen,\" said the doctor; \"I know the full importance of the\nstatement I have just made, and the disposition of the man to whom I\nhave made it.\"\n\n\"Do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend?\" asked Villefort.\n\n\"As a friend, and only as a friend, at this moment. The similarity in\nthe symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so\ngreat, that were I obliged to affirm by oath what I have now stated, I\nshould hesitate; I therefore repeat to you, I speak not to a magistrate,\nbut to a friend. And to that friend I say. 'During the three-quarters of\nan hour that the struggle continued, I watched the convulsions and the\ndeath of Madame de Saint-Meran, and am thoroughly convinced that not\nonly did her death proceed from poison, but I could also specify the\npoison.'\"\n\n\"Can it be possible?\"\n\n\"The symptoms are marked, do you see?--sleep broken by nervous spasms,\nexcitation of the brain, torpor of the nerve centres. Madame de\nSaint-Meran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine,\nwhich by some mistake, perhaps, has been given to her.\" Villefort seized\nthe doctor's hand. \"Oh, it is impossible,\" said he, \"I must be dreaming!\nIt is frightful to hear such things from such a man as you! Tell me, I\nentreat you, my dear doctor, that you may be deceived.\"\n\n\"Doubtless I may, but\"--\n\n\"But?\"\n\n\"But I do not think so.\"\n\n\"Have pity on me doctor! So many dreadful things have happened to me\nlately that I am on the verge of madness.\"\n\n\"Has any one besides me seen Madame de Saint-Meran?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Has anything been sent for from a chemist's that I have not examined?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Had Madame de Saint-Meran any enemies?\"\n\n\"Not to my knowledge.\"\n\n\"Would her death affect any one's interest?\"\n\n\"It could not indeed, my daughter is her only heiress--Valentine alone.\nOh, if such a thought could present itself, I would stab myself to\npunish my heart for having for one instant harbored it.\"\n\n\"Indeed, my dear friend,\" said M. d'Avrigny, \"I would not accuse any\none; I speak only of an accident, you understand,--of a mistake,--but\nwhether accident or mistake, the fact is there; it is on my conscience\nand compels me to speak aloud to you. Make inquiry.\"\n\n\"Of whom?--how?--of what?\"\n\n\"May not Barrois, the old servant, have made a mistake, and have given\nMadame de Saint-Meran a dose prepared for his master?\"\n\n\"For my father?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But how could a dose prepared for M. Noirtier poison Madame de\nSaint-Meran?\"\n\n\"Nothing is more simple. You know poisons become remedies in certain\ndiseases, of which paralysis is one. For instance, having tried every\nother remedy to restore movement and speech to M. Noirtier, I resolved\nto try one last means, and for three months I have been giving him\nbrucine; so that in the last dose I ordered for him there were six\ngrains. This quantity, which is perfectly safe to administer to the\nparalyzed frame of M. Noirtier, which has become gradually accustomed to\nit, would be sufficient to kill another person.\"\n\n\"My dear doctor, there is no communication between M. Noirtier's\napartment and that of Madame de Saint-Meran, and Barrois never entered\nmy mother-in-law's room. In short, doctor although I know you to be the\nmost conscientious man in the world, and although I place the utmost\nreliance in you, I want, notwithstanding my conviction, to believe this\naxiom, errare humanum est.\"\n\n\"Is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with\nmyself?\"\n\n\"Why do you ask me that?--what do you wish?\"\n\n\"Send for him; I will tell him what I have seen, and we will consult\ntogether, and examine the body.\"\n\n\"And you will find traces of poison?\"\n\n\"No, I did not say of poison, but we can prove what was the state of the\nbody; we shall discover the cause of her sudden death, and we shall say,\n'Dear Villefort, if this thing has been caused by negligence, watch over\nyour servants; if from hatred, watch your enemies.'\"\n\n\"What do you propose to me, d'Avrigny?\" said Villefort in despair; \"so\nsoon as another is admitted into our secret, an inquest will become\nnecessary; and an inquest in my house--impossible! Still,\" continued the\nprocureur, looking at the doctor with uneasiness, \"if you wish it--if\nyou demand it, why then it shall be done. But, doctor, you see me\nalready so grieved--how can I introduce into my house so much scandal,\nafter so much sorrow? My wife and my daughter would die of it! And I,\ndoctor--you know a man does not arrive at the post I occupy--one has\nnot been king's attorney twenty-five years without having amassed a\ntolerable number of enemies; mine are numerous. Let this affair be\ntalked of, it will be a triumph for them, which will make them rejoice,\nand cover me with shame. Pardon me, doctor, these worldly ideas; were\nyou a priest I should not dare tell you that, but you are a man, and\nyou know mankind. Doctor, pray recall your words; you have said nothing,\nhave you?\"\n\n\"My dear M. de Villefort,\" replied the doctor, \"my first duty is to\nhumanity. I would have saved Madame de Saint-Meran, if science could\nhave done it; but she is dead and my duty regards the living. Let us\nbury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts; I am\nwilling, if any one should suspect this, that my silence on the subject\nshould be imputed to my ignorance. Meanwhile, sir, watch always--watch\ncarefully, for perhaps the evil may not stop here. And when you have\nfound the culprit, if you find him, I will say to you, 'You are a\nmagistrate, do as you will!'\"\n\n\"I thank you, doctor,\" said Villefort with indescribable joy; \"I never\nhad a better friend than you.\" And, as if he feared Doctor d'Avrigny\nwould recall his promise, he hurried him towards the house.\n\nWhen they were gone, Morrel ventured out from under the trees, and the\nmoon shone upon his face, which was so pale it might have been taken\nfor that of a ghost. \"I am manifestly protected in a most wonderful, but\nmost terrible manner,\" said he; \"but Valentine, poor girl, how will she\nbear so much sorrow?\"\n\nAs he thought thus, he looked alternately at the window with red\ncurtains and the three windows with white curtains. The light had almost\ndisappeared from the former; doubtless Madame de Villefort had just put\nout her lamp, and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the\nwindow. At the extremity of the building, on the contrary, he saw one\nof the three windows open. A wax-light placed on the mantle-piece threw\nsome of its pale rays without, and a shadow was seen for one moment on\nthe balcony. Morrel shuddered; he thought he heard a sob.\n\nIt cannot be wondered at that his mind, generally so courageous, but\nnow disturbed by the two strongest human passions, love and fear, was\nweakened even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts. Although\nit was impossible that Valentine should see him, hidden as he was, he\nthought he heard the shadow at the window call him; his disturbed mind\ntold him so. This double error became an irresistible reality, and by\none of the incomprehensible transports of youth, he bounded from his\nhiding-place, and with two strides, at the risk of being seen, at the\nrisk of alarming Valentine, at the risk of being discovered by\nsome exclamation which might escape the young girl, he crossed the\nflower-garden, which by the light of the moon resembled a large white\nlake, and having passed the rows of orange-trees which extended in front\nof the house, he reached the step, ran quickly up and pushed the door,\nwhich opened without offering any resistance. Valentine had not seen\nhim. Her eyes, raised towards heaven, were watching a silvery cloud\ngliding over the azure, its form that of a shadow mounting towards\nheaven. Her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her\ngrandmother.\n\nMeanwhile, Morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase,\nwhich, being carpeted, prevented his approach being heard, and he had\nregained that degree of confidence that the presence of M. de Villefort\neven would not have alarmed him. He was quite prepared for any such\nencounter. He would at once approach Valentine's father and acknowledge\nall, begging Villefort to pardon and sanction the love which united two\nfond and loving hearts. Morrel was mad. Happily he did not meet any one.\nNow, especially, did he find the description Valentine had given of the\ninterior of the house useful to him; he arrived safely at the top of\nthe staircase, and while he was feeling his way, a sob indicated the\ndirection he was to take. He turned back, a door partly open enabled him\nto see his road, and to hear the voice of one in sorrow. He pushed the\ndoor open and entered. At the other end of the room, under a white sheet\nwhich covered it, lay the corpse, still more alarming to Morrel since\nthe account he had so unexpectedly overheard. By its side, on her knees,\nand with her head buried in the cushion of an easy-chair, was Valentine,\ntrembling and sobbing, her hands extended above her head, clasped and\nstiff. She had turned from the window, which remained open, and was\npraying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling; her\nwords were rapid, incoherent, unintelligible, for the burning weight of\ngrief almost stopped her utterance. The moon shining through the open\nblinds made the lamp appear to burn paler, and cast a sepulchral hue\nover the whole scene. Morrel could not resist this; he was not exemplary\nfor piety, he was not easily impressed, but Valentine suffering,\nweeping, wringing her hands before him, was more than he could bear in\nsilence. He sighed, and whispered a name, and the head bathed in tears\nand pressed on the velvet cushion of the chair--a head like that of\na Magdalen by Correggio--was raised and turned towards him. Valentine\nperceived him without betraying the least surprise. A heart overwhelmed\nwith one great grief is insensible to minor emotions. Morrel held out\nhis hand to her. Valentine, as her only apology for not having met him,\npointed to the corpse under the sheet, and began to sob again. Neither\ndared for some time to speak in that room. They hesitated to break the\nsilence which death seemed to impose; at length Valentine ventured.\n\n\"My friend,\" said she, \"how came you here? Alas, I would say you are\nwelcome, had not death opened the way for you into this house.\"\n\n\"Valentine,\" said Morrel with a trembling voice, \"I had waited since\nhalf-past eight, and did not see you come; I became uneasy, leaped the\nwall, found my way through the garden, when voices conversing about the\nfatal event\"--\n\n\"What voices?\" asked Valentine. Morrel shuddered as he thought of the\nconversation of the doctor and M. de Villefort, and he thought he could\nsee through the sheet the extended hands, the stiff neck, and the purple\nlips.\n\n\"Your servants,\" said he, \"who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful\nstory; from them I learned it all.\"\n\n\"But it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here, love.\"\n\n\"Forgive me,\" replied Morrel; \"I will go away.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Valentine, \"you might meet some one; stay.\"\n\n\"But if any one should come here\"--\n\nThe young girl shook her head. \"No one will come,\" said she; \"do not\nfear, there is our safeguard,\" pointing to the bed.\n\n\"But what has become of M. d'Epinay?\" replied Morrel.\n\n\"M. Franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother was\ndying.\"\n\n\"Alas,\" said Morrel with a feeling of selfish joy; for he thought this\ndeath would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely. \"But what\nredoubles my sorrow,\" continued the young girl, as if this feeling was\nto receive its immediate punishment, \"is that the poor old lady, on\nher death-bed, requested that the marriage might take place as soon as\npossible; she also, thinking to protect me, was acting against me.\"\n\n\"Hark!\" said Morrel. They both listened; steps were distinctly heard in\nthe corridor and on the stairs.\n\n\"It is my father, who has just left his study.\"\n\n\"To accompany the doctor to the door,\" added Morrel.\n\n\"How do you know it is the doctor?\" asked Valentine, astonished.\n\n\"I imagined it must be,\" said Morrel. Valentine looked at the young man;\nthey heard the street door close, then M. de Villefort locked the garden\ndoor, and returned up-stairs. He stopped a moment in the anteroom, as\nif hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into Madame\nde Saint-Meran's; Morrel concealed himself behind a door; Valentine\nremained motionless, grief seeming to deprive her of all fear. M. de\nVillefort passed on to his own room. \"Now,\" said Valentine, \"you can\nneither go out by the front door nor by the garden.\" Morrel looked at\nher with astonishment. \"There is but one way left you that is safe,\"\nsaid she; \"it is through my grandfather's room.\" She rose, \"Come,\" she\nadded.--\"Where?\" asked Maximilian.\n\n\"To my grandfather's room.\"\n\n\"I in M. Noirtier's apartment?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Can you mean it, Valentine?\"\n\n\"I have long wished it; he is my only remaining friend and we both need\nhis help,--come.\"\n\n\"Be careful, Valentine,\" said Morrel, hesitating to comply with the\nyoung girl's wishes; \"I now see my error--I acted like a madman in\ncoming in here. Are you sure you are more reasonable?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Valentine; \"and I have but one scruple,--that of leaving my\ndear grandmother's remains, which I had undertaken to watch.\"\n\n\"Valentine,\" said Morrel, \"death is in itself sacred.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Valentine; \"besides, it will not be for long.\" She then\ncrossed the corridor, and led the way down a narrow staircase to M.\nNoirtier's room; Morrel followed her on tiptoe; at the door they found\nthe old servant. \"Barrois,\" said Valentine, \"shut the door, and let\nno one come in.\" She passed first. Noirtier, seated in his chair, and\nlistening to every sound, was watching the door; he saw Valentine, and\nhis eye brightened. There was something grave and solemn in the approach\nof the young girl which struck the old man, and immediately his bright\neye began to interrogate. \"Dear grandfather.\" said she hurriedly, \"you\nknow poor grandmamma died an hour since, and now I have no friend in the\nworld but you.\" His expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness. \"To\nyou alone, then, may I confide my sorrows and my hopes?\" The paralytic\nmotioned \"Yes.\" Valentine took Maximilian's hand. \"Look attentively,\nthen, at this gentleman.\" The old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with\nslight astonishment on Morrel. \"It is M. Maximilian Morrel,\" said\nshe; \"the son of that good merchant of Marseilles, whom you doubtless\nrecollect.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man. \"He brings an irreproachable name, which\nMaximilian is likely to render glorious, since at thirty years of age he\nis a captain, an officer of the Legion of Honor.\" The old man signified\nthat he recollected him. \"Well, grandpapa,\" said Valentine, kneeling\nbefore him, and pointing to Maximilian, \"I love him, and will be only\nhis; were I compelled to marry another, I would destroy myself.\"\n\nThe eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts.\n\"You like M. Maximilian Morrel, do you not, grandpapa?\" asked Valentine.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you will protect us, who are your children, against the will of my\nfather?\"--Noirtier cast an intelligent glance at Morrel, as if to say,\n\"perhaps I may.\" Maximilian understood him.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said he, \"you have a sacred duty to fulfil in your\ndeceased grandmother's room, will you allow me the honor of a few\nminutes' conversation with M. Noirtier?\"\n\n\"That is it,\" said the old man's eye. Then he looked anxiously at\nValentine.\n\n\"Do you fear he will not understand?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh, we have so often spoken of you, that he knows exactly how I talk\nto you.\" Then turning to Maximilian, with an adorable smile; although\nshaded by sorrow,--\"He knows everything I know,\" said she.\n\nValentine arose, placed a chair for Morrel, requested Barrois not\nto admit any one, and having tenderly embraced her grandfather, and\nsorrowfully taken leave of Morrel, she went away. To prove to Noirtier\nthat he was in Valentine's confidence and knew all their secrets, Morrel\ntook the dictionary, a pen, and some paper, and placed them all on a\ntable where there was a light.\n\n\"But first,\" said Morrel, \"allow me, sir, to tell you who I am, how much\nI love Mademoiselle Valentine, and what are my designs respecting her.\"\nNoirtier made a sign that he would listen.\n\nIt was an imposing sight to witness this old man, apparently a mere\nuseless burden, becoming the sole protector, support, and adviser of the\nlovers who were both young, beautiful, and strong. His remarkably\nnoble and austere expression struck Morrel, who began his story with\ntrembling. He related the manner in which he had become acquainted with\nValentine, and how he had loved her, and that Valentine, in her solitude\nand her misfortune, had accepted the offer of his devotion. He told\nhim his birth, his position, his fortune, and more than once, when he\nconsulted the look of the paralytic, that look answered, \"That is good,\nproceed.\"\n\n\"And now,\" said Morrel, when he had finished the first part of his\nrecital, \"now I have told you of my love and my hopes, may I inform you\nof my intentions?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" signified the old man.\n\n\"This was our resolution; a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate, in\nwhich I intended to carry off Valentine to my sister's house, to marry\nher, and to wait respectfully M. de Villefort's pardon.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Noirtier.\n\n\"We must not do so?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You do not sanction our project?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"There is another way,\" said Morrel. The old man's interrogative eye\nsaid, \"What?\"\n\n\"I will go,\" continued Maximilian, \"I will seek M. Franz d'Epinay--I\nam happy to be able to mention this in Mademoiselle de Villefort's\nabsence--and will conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to\nchallenge me.\" Noirtier's look continued to interrogate. \"You wish to\nknow what I will do?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I will find him, as I told you. I will tell him the ties which bind me\nto Mademoiselle Valentine; if he be a sensible man, he will prove it by\nrenouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed, and will secure\nmy friendship, and love until death; if he refuse, either through\ninterest or ridiculous pride, after I have proved to him that he would\nbe forcing my wife from me, that Valentine loves me, and will have no\nother, I will fight with him, give him every advantage, and I shall\nkill him, or he will kill me; if I am victorious, he will not marry\nValentine, and if I die, I am very sure Valentine will not marry him.\"\nNoirtier watched, with indescribable pleasure, this noble and sincere\ncountenance, on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted,\nadding by the expression of his fine features all that coloring adds to\na sound and faithful drawing. Still, when Morrel had finished, he shut\nhis eyes several times, which was his manner of saying \"No.\"\n\n\"No?\" said Morrel; \"you disapprove of this second project, as you did of\nthe first?\"\n\n\"I do,\" signified the old man.\n\n\"But what then must be done?\" asked Morrel. \"Madame de Saint-Meran's\nlast request was, that the marriage might not be delayed; must I let\nthings take their course?\" Noirtier did not move. \"I understand,\" said\nMorrel; \"I am to wait.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But delay may ruin our plan, sir,\" replied the young man. \"Alone,\nValentine has no power; she will be compelled to submit. I am here\nalmost miraculously, and can scarcely hope for so good an opportunity to\noccur again. Believe me, there are only the two plans I have proposed to\nyou; forgive my vanity, and tell me which you prefer. Do you authorize\nMademoiselle Valentine to intrust herself to my honor?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you prefer I should seek M. d'Epinay?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Whence then will come the help we need--from chance?\" resumed Morrel.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"From you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You thoroughly understand me, sir? Pardon my eagerness, for my life\ndepends on your answer. Will our help come from you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You are sure of it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" There was so much firmness in the look which gave this answer,\nno one could, at any rate, doubt his will, if they did his power. \"Oh,\nthank you a thousand times! But how, unless a miracle should restore\nyour speech, your gesture, your movement, how can you, chained to that\narm-chair, dumb and motionless, oppose this marriage?\" A smile lit up\nthe old man's face, a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face.\n\"Then I must wait?\" asked the young man.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But the contract?\" The same smile returned. \"Will you assure me it\nshall not be signed?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Noirtier.\n\n\"The contract shall not be signed!\" cried Morrel. \"Oh, pardon me, sir; I\ncan scarcely realize so great a happiness. Will they not sign it?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the paralytic. Notwithstanding that assurance, Morrel still\nhesitated. This promise of an impotent old man was so strange that,\ninstead of being the result of the power of his will, it might emanate\nfrom enfeebled organs. Is it not natural that the madman, ignorant of\nhis folly, should attempt things beyond his power? The weak man talks of\nburdens he can raise, the timid of giants he can confront, the poor\nof treasures he spends, the most humble peasant, in the height of his\npride, calls himself Jupiter. Whether Noirtier understood the young\nman's indecision, or whether he had not full confidence in his docility,\nhe looked uneasily at him. \"What do you wish, sir?\" asked Morrel;\n\"that I should renew my promise of remaining tranquil?\" Noirtier's eye\nremained fixed and firm, as if to imply that a promise did not suffice;\nthen it passed from his face to his hands.\n\n\"Shall I swear to you, sir?\" asked Maximilian.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the paralytic with the same solemnity. Morrel understood\nthat the old man attached great importance to an oath. He extended his\nhand.\n\n\"I swear to you, on my honor,\" said he, \"to await your decision\nrespecting the course I am to pursue with M. d'Epinay.\"\n\n\"That is right,\" said the old man.\n\n\"Now,\" said Morrel, \"do you wish me to retire?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Without seeing Mademoiselle Valentine?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nMorrel made a sign that he was ready to obey. \"But,\" said he, \"first\nallow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now.\" Noirtier's\nexpression could not be understood. The young man pressed his lips on\nthe same spot, on the old man's forehead, where Valentine's had been.\nThen he bowed a second time and retired. He found outside the door\nthe old servant, to whom Valentine had given directions. Morrel was\nconducted along a dark passage, which led to a little door opening\non the garden, soon found the spot where he had entered, with the\nassistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall, and by his ladder\nwas in an instant in the clover-field where his cabriolet was still\nwaiting for him. He got in it, and thoroughly wearied by so many\nemotions, arrived about midnight in the Rue Meslay, threw himself on his\nbed and slept soundly.\n\n\n\nChapter 74. The Villefort Family Vault.\n\nTwo days after, a considerable crowd was assembled, towards ten o'clock\nin the morning, around the door of M. de Villefort's house, and a\nlong file of mourning-coaches and private carriages extended along the\nFaubourg Saint-Honore and the Rue de la Pepiniere. Among them was one\nof a very singular form, which appeared to have come from a distance. It\nwas a kind of covered wagon, painted black, and was one of the first\nto arrive. Inquiry was made, and it was ascertained that, by a strange\ncoincidence, this carriage contained the corpse of the Marquis de\nSaint-Meran, and that those who had come thinking to attend one funeral\nwould follow two. Their number was great. The Marquis de Saint-Meran,\none of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of Louis XVIII. and\nKing Charles X., had preserved a great number of friends, and these,\nadded to the personages whom the usages of society gave Villefort a\nclaim on, formed a considerable body.\n\nDue information was given to the authorities, and permission obtained\nthat the two funerals should take place at the same time. A second\nhearse, decked with the same funereal pomp, was brought to M. de\nVillefort's door, and the coffin removed into it from the post-wagon.\nThe two bodies were to be interred in the cemetery of Pere-la-Chaise,\nwhere M. de Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the\nreception of his family. The remains of poor Renee were already\ndeposited there, and now, after ten years of separation, her father\nand mother were to be reunited with her. The Parisians, always curious,\nalways affected by funereal display, looked on with religious silence\nwhile the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the\nnumber of the old aristocracy--the greatest protectors of commerce and\nsincere devotees to their principles. In one of the mourning-coaches\nBeauchamp, Debray, and Chateau-Renaud were talking of the very sudden\ndeath of the marchioness. \"I saw Madame de Saint-Meran only last year at\nMarseilles, when I was coming back from Algiers,\" said Chateau-Renaud;\n\"she looked like a woman destined to live to be a hundred years old,\nfrom her apparent sound health and great activity of mind and body. How\nold was she?\"\n\n\"Franz assured me,\" replied Albert, \"that she was sixty-six years old.\nBut she has not died of old age, but of grief; it appears that since\nthe death of the marquis, which affected her very deeply, she has not\ncompletely recovered her reason.\"\n\n\"But of what disease, then, did she die?\" asked Debray.\n\n\"It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy, which\nis the same thing, is it not?\"\n\n\"Nearly.\"\n\n\"It is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy,\" said Beauchamp.\n\"Madame de Saint-Meran, whom I once saw, was short, of slender form,\nand of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament; grief could\nhardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of Madame de\nSaint-Meran.\"\n\n\"At any rate,\" said Albert, \"whatever disease or doctor may have killed\nher, M. de Villefort, or rather, Mademoiselle Valentine,--or, still\nrather, our friend Franz, inherits a magnificent fortune, amounting, I\nbelieve, to 80,000 livres per annum.\"\n\n\"And this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old Jacobin,\nNoirtier.\"\n\n\"That is a tenacious old grandfather,\" said Beauchamp. \"Tenacem\npropositi virum. I think he must have made an agreement with death to\noutlive all his heirs, and he appears likely to succeed. He resembles\nthe old Conventionalist of '93, who said to Napoleon, in 1814, 'You bend\nbecause your empire is a young stem, weakened by rapid growth. Take\nthe Republic for a tutor; let us return with renewed strength to the\nbattle-field, and I promise you 500,000 soldiers, another Marengo, and\na second Austerlitz. Ideas do not become extinct, sire; they slumber\nsometimes, but only revive the stronger before they sleep entirely.'\nIdeas and men appeared the same to him. One thing only puzzles me,\nnamely, how Franz d'Epinay will like a grandfather who cannot be\nseparated from his wife. But where is Franz?\"\n\n\"In the first carriage, with M. de Villefort, who considers him already\nas one of the family.\"\n\nSuch was the conversation in almost all the carriages; these two sudden\ndeaths, so quickly following each other, astonished every one, but no\none suspected the terrible secret which M. d'Avrigny had communicated,\nin his nocturnal walk to M. de Villefort. They arrived in about an hour\nat the cemetery; the weather was mild, but dull, and in harmony with\nthe funeral ceremony. Among the groups which flocked towards the\nfamily vault, Chateau-Renaud recognized Morrel, who had come alone in a\ncabriolet, and walked silently along the path bordered with yew-trees.\n\"You here?\" said Chateau-Renaud, passing his arms through the young\ncaptain's; \"are you a friend of Villefort's? How is it that I have never\nmet you at his house?\"\n\n\"I am no acquaintance of M. de Villefort's.\" answered Morrel, \"but I was\nof Madame de Saint-Meran.\" Albert came up to them at this moment with\nFranz.\n\n\"The time and place are but ill-suited for an introduction.\" said\nAlbert; \"but we are not superstitious. M. Morrel, allow me to present\nto you M. Franz d'Epinay, a delightful travelling companion, with whom\nI made the tour of Italy. My dear Franz, M. Maximilian Morrel, an\nexcellent friend I have acquired in your absence, and whose name you\nwill hear me mention every time I make any allusion to affection, wit,\nor amiability.\" Morrel hesitated for a moment; he feared it would be\nhypocritical to accost in a friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly\nopposing, but his oath and the gravity of the circumstances recurred\nto his memory; he struggled to conceal his emotion and bowed to Franz.\n\"Mademoiselle de Villefort is in deep sorrow, is she not?\" said Debray\nto Franz.\n\n\"Extremely,\" replied he; \"she looked so pale this morning, I scarcely\nknew her.\" These apparently simple words pierced Morrel to the\nheart. This man had seen Valentine, and spoken to her! The young and\nhigh-spirited officer required all his strength of mind to resist\nbreaking his oath. He took the arm of Chateau-Renaud, and turned towards\nthe vault, where the attendants had already placed the two coffins.\n\"This is a magnificent habitation,\" said Beauchamp, looking towards the\nmausoleum; \"a summer and winter palace. You will, in turn, enter it, my\ndear d'Epinay, for you will soon be numbered as one of the family. I, as\na philosopher, should like a little country-house, a cottage down there\nunder the trees, without so many free-stones over my poor body. In\ndying, I will say to those around me what Voltaire wrote to Piron: 'Eo\nrus, and all will be over.' But come, Franz, take courage, your wife is\nan heiress.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Beauchamp, you are unbearable. Politics has made you laugh at\neverything, and political men have made you disbelieve everything.\nBut when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men, and the\npleasure of leaving politics for a moment, try to find your affectionate\nheart, which you leave with your stick when you go to the Chamber.\"\n\n\"But tell me,\" said Beauchamp, \"what is life? Is it not a hall in\nDeath's anteroom?\"\n\n\"I am prejudiced against Beauchamp,\" said Albert, drawing Franz away,\nand leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with\nDebray. The Villefort vault formed a square of white stones, about\ntwenty feet high; an interior partition separated the two families, and\neach apartment had its entrance door. Here were not, as in other tombs,\nignoble drawers, one above another, where thrift bestows its dead and\nlabels them like specimens in a museum; all that was visible within the\nbronze gates was a gloomy-looking room, separated by a wall from the\nvault itself. The two doors before mentioned were in the middle of this\nwall, and enclosed the Villefort and Saint-Meran coffins. There grief\nmight freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling\nloungers who came from a picnic party to visit Pere-la-Chaise, or by\nlovers who make it their rendezvous.\n\nThe two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their\nreception in the right-hand crypt belonging to the Saint-Meran family.\nVillefort, Franz, and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary.\n\nAs the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door, and\nthere was no address given, the party all separated; Chateau-Renaud,\nAlbert, and Morrel, went one way, and Debray and Beauchamp the other.\nFranz remained with M. de Villefort; at the gate of the cemetery, Morrel\nmade an excuse to wait; he saw Franz and M. de Villefort get into the\nsame mourning coach, and thought this meeting forboded evil. He then\nreturned to Paris, and although in the same carriage with Chateau-Renaud\nand Albert, he did not hear one word of their conversation. As Franz was\nabout to take leave of M. de Villefort, \"When shall I see you again?\"\nsaid the latter.\n\n\"At what time you please, sir,\" replied Franz.\n\n\"As soon as possible.\"\n\n\"I am at your command, sir; shall we return together?\"\n\n\"If not unpleasant to you.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I shall feel much pleasure.\" Thus, the future father\nand son-in-law stepped into the same carriage, and Morrel, seeing\nthem pass, became uneasy. Villefort and Franz returned to the Faubourg\nSaint-Honore. The procureur, without going to see either his wife or\nhis daughter, went at once to his study, and, offering the young man\na chair,--\"M. d'Epinay,\" said he, \"allow me to remind you at this\nmoment,--which is perhaps not so ill-chosen as at first sight may\nappear, for obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first\noffering which should be made at their tomb,--allow me then to remind\nyou of the wish expressed by Madame de Saint-Meran on her death-bed,\nthat Valentine's wedding might not be deferred. You know the affairs of\nthe deceased are in perfect order, and her will bequeaths to Valentine\nthe entire property of the Saint-Meran family; the notary showed me\nthe documents yesterday, which will enable us to draw up the contract\nimmediately. You may call on the notary, M. Deschamps, Place Beauveau,\nFaubourg Saint-Honore, and you have my authority to inspect those\ndeeds.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied M. d'Epinay, \"it is not, perhaps, the moment for\nMademoiselle Valentine, who is in deep distress, to think of a husband;\nindeed, I fear\"--\n\n\"Valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her\ngrandmother's last injunctions; there will be no obstacle from that\nquarter, I assure you.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" replied Franz, \"as I shall raise none, you may make\narrangements when you please; I have pledged my word, and shall feel\npleasure and happiness in adhering to it.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Villefort, \"nothing further is required. The contract was\nto have been signed three days since; we shall find it all ready, and\ncan sign it to-day.\"\n\n\"But the mourning?\" said Franz, hesitating.\n\n\"Don't be uneasy on that score,\" replied Villefort; \"no ceremony will be\nneglected in my house. Mademoiselle de Villefort may retire during the\nprescribed three months to her estate of Saint-Meran; I say hers, for\nshe inherits it to-day. There, after a few days, if you like, the\ncivil marriage shall be celebrated without pomp or ceremony. Madame de\nSaint-Meran wished her daughter should be married there. When that is\nover, you, sir, can return to Paris, while your wife passes the time of\nher mourning with her mother-in-law.\"\n\n\"As you please, sir,\" said Franz.\n\n\"Then,\" replied M. de Villefort, \"have the kindness to wait half an\nhour; Valentine shall come down into the drawing-room. I will send for\nM. Deschamps; we will read and sign the contract before we separate,\nand this evening Madame de Villefort shall accompany Valentine to her\nestate, where we will rejoin them in a week.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Franz, \"I have one request to make.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I wish Albert de Morcerf and Raoul de Chateau-Renaud to be present at\nthis signature; you know they are my witnesses.\"\n\n\"Half an hour will suffice to apprise them; will you go for them\nyourself, or shall you send?\"\n\n\"I prefer going, sir.\"\n\n\"I shall expect you, then, in half an hour, baron, and Valentine will\nbe ready.\" Franz bowed and left the room. Scarcely had the door\nclosed, when M. de Villefort sent to tell Valentine to be ready in the\ndrawing-room in half an hour, as he expected the notary and M. d'Epinay\nand his witnesses. The news caused a great sensation throughout the\nhouse; Madame de Villefort would not believe it, and Valentine was\nthunderstruck. She looked around for help, and would have gone down to\nher grandfather's room, but on the stairs she met M. de Villefort,\nwho took her arm and led her into the drawing-room. In the anteroom,\nValentine met Barrois, and looked despairingly at the old servant. A\nmoment later, Madame de Villefort entered the drawing-room with her\nlittle Edward. It was evident that she had shared the grief of the\nfamily, for she was pale and looked fatigued. She sat down, took Edward\non her knees, and from time to time pressed this child, on whom her\naffections appeared centred, almost convulsively to her bosom. Two\ncarriages were soon heard to enter the court yard. One was the notary's;\nthe other, that of Franz and his friends. In a moment the whole party\nwas assembled. Valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins\nfrom her temples, round her eyes and down her cheeks. Franz was deeply\naffected. Chateau-Renaud and Albert looked at each other with amazement;\nthe ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful\nthan did that which was about to begin. Madame de Villefort had placed\nherself in the shadow behind a velvet curtain, and as she constantly\nbent over her child, it was difficult to read the expression of her\nface. M. de Villefort was, as usual, unmoved.\n\nThe notary, after having according to the customary method arranged\nthe papers on the table, taken his place in an armchair, and raised his\nspectacles, turned towards Franz:\n\n\"Are you M. Franz de Quesnel, baron d'Epinay?\" asked he, although he\nknew it perfectly.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Franz. The notary bowed. \"I have, then, to inform\nyou, sir, at the request of M. de Villefort, that your projected\nmarriage with Mademoiselle de Villefort has changed the feeling of M.\nNoirtier towards his grandchild, and that he disinherits her entirely of\nthe fortune he would have left her. Let me hasten to add,\" continued\nhe, \"that the testator, having only the right to alienate a part of his\nfortune, and having alienated it all, the will will not bear scrutiny,\nand is declared null and void.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" said Villefort; \"but I warn M. d'Epinay, that during my life-time\nmy father's will shall never be questioned, my position forbidding any\ndoubt to be entertained.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Franz, \"I regret much that such a question has been raised\nin the presence of Mademoiselle Valentine; I have never inquired the\namount of her fortune, which, however limited it may be, exceeds\nmine. My family has sought consideration in this alliance with M. de\nVillefort; all I seek is happiness.\" Valentine imperceptibly thanked\nhim, while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks. \"Besides, sir,\" said\nVillefort, addressing himself to his future son-in-law, \"excepting\nthe loss of a portion of your hopes, this unexpected will need not\npersonally wound you; M. Noirtier's weakness of mind sufficiently\nexplains it. It is not because Mademoiselle Valentine is going to marry\nyou that he is angry, but because she will marry, a union with any other\nwould have caused him the same sorrow. Old age is selfish, sir, and\nMademoiselle de Villefort has been a faithful companion to M. Noirtier,\nwhich she cannot be when she becomes the Baroness d'Epinay. My father's\nmelancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any subjects, which the\nweakness of his mind would incapacitate him from understanding, and I\nam perfectly convinced that at the present time, although, he knows that\nhis granddaughter is going to be married, M. Noirtier has even forgotten\nthe name of his intended grandson.\" M. de Villefort had scarcely said\nthis, when the door opened, and Barrois appeared.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, in a tone strangely firm for a servant speaking to\nhis masters under such solemn circumstances,--\"gentlemen, M. Noirtier\nde Villefort wishes to speak immediately to M. Franz de Quesnel, baron\nd'Epinay;\" he, as well as the notary, that there might be no mistake in\nthe person, gave all his titles to the bride-groom elect.\n\nVillefort started, Madame de Villefort let her son slip from her knees,\nValentine rose, pale and dumb as a statue. Albert and Chateau-Renaud\nexchanged a second look, more full of amazement than the first. The\nnotary looked at Villefort. \"It is impossible,\" said the procureur. \"M.\nd'Epinay cannot leave the drawing-room at present.\"\n\n\"It is at this moment,\" replied Barrois with the same firmness, \"that M.\nNoirtier, my master, wishes to speak on important subjects to M. Franz\nd'Epinay.\"\n\n\"Grandpapa Noirtier can speak now, then,\" said Edward, with his habitual\nquickness. However, his remark did not make Madame de Villefort even\nsmile, so much was every mind engaged, and so solemn was the situation.\nAstonishment was at its height. Something like a smile was perceptible\non Madame de Villefort's countenance. Valentine instinctively raised her\neyes, as if to thank heaven.\n\n\"Pray go, Valentine,\" said; M. de Villefort, \"and see what this new\nfancy of your grandfather's is.\" Valentine rose quickly, and was\nhastening joyfully towards the door, when M. de Villefort altered his\nintention.\n\n\"Stop,\" said he; \"I will go with you.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said Franz, \"since M. Noirtier sent for me, I am ready\nto attend to his wish; besides, I shall be happy to pay my respects to\nhim, not having yet had the honor of doing so.\"\n\n\"Pray, sir,\" said Villefort with marked uneasiness, \"do not disturb\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, sir,\" said Franz in a resolute tone. \"I would not lose this\nopportunity of proving to M. Noirtier how wrong it would be of him to\nencourage feelings of dislike to me, which I am determined to conquer,\nwhatever they may be, by my devotion.\" And without listening to\nVillefort he arose, and followed Valentine, who was running down-stairs\nwith the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock to cling to. M.\nde Villefort followed them. Chateau-Renaud and Morcerf exchanged a third\nlook of still increasing wonder.\n\n\n\nChapter 75. A Signed Statement.\n\nNoirtier was prepared to receive them, dressed in black, and installed\nin his arm-chair. When the three persons he expected had entered, he\nlooked at the door, which his valet immediately closed.\n\n\"Listen,\" whispered Villefort to Valentine, who could not conceal her\njoy; \"if M. Noirtier wishes to communicate anything which would delay\nyour marriage, I forbid you to understand him.\" Valentine blushed,\nbut did not answer. Villefort, approaching Noirtier--\"Here is M. Franz\nd'Epinay,\" said he; \"you requested to see him. We have all wished for\nthis interview, and I trust it will convince you how ill-formed are your\nobjections to Valentine's marriage.\"\n\nNoirtier answered only by a look which made Villefort's blood run cold.\nHe motioned to Valentine to approach. In a moment, thanks to her habit\nof conversing with her grandfather, she understood that he asked for a\nkey. Then his eye was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the\nwindows. She opened the drawer, and found a key; and, understanding that\nwas what he wanted, again watched his eyes, which turned toward an old\nsecretary which had been neglected for many years and was supposed to\ncontain nothing but useless documents. \"Shall I open the secretary?\"\nasked Valentine.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man.\n\n\"And the drawers?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Those at the side?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"The middle one?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Valentine opened it and drew out a bundle of papers. \"Is that\nwhat you wish for?\" asked she.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nShe took successively all the other papers out till the drawer was\nempty. \"But there are no more,\" said she. Noirtier's eye was fixed on\nthe dictionary. \"Yes, I understand, grandfather,\" said the young girl.\n\nHe pointed to each letter of the alphabet. At the letter S the old man\nstopped her. She opened, and found the word \"secret.\"\n\n\"Ah, is there a secret spring?\" said Valentine.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Noirtier.\n\n\"And who knows it?\" Noirtier looked at the door where the servant had\ngone out. \"Barrois?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Shall I call him?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nValentine went to the door, and called Barrois. Villefort's impatience\nduring this scene made the perspiration roll from his forehead, and\nFranz was stupefied. The old servant came. \"Barrois,\" said Valentine,\n\"my grandfather has told me to open that drawer in the secretary, but\nthere is a secret spring in it, which you know--will you open it?\"\n\nBarrois looked at the old man. \"Obey,\" said Noirtier's intelligent eye.\nBarrois touched a spring, the false bottom came out, and they saw a\nbundle of papers tied with a black string.\n\n\"Is that what you wish for?\" said Barrois.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Shall I give these papers to M. de Villefort?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"To Mademoiselle Valentine?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"To M. Franz d'Epinay?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nFranz, astonished, advanced a step. \"To me, sir?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes.\" Franz took them from Barrois and casting a glance at the cover,\nread:--\n\n\"'To be given, after my death, to General Durand, who shall bequeath the\npacket to his son, with an injunction to preserve it as containing an\nimportant document.'\n\n\"Well, sir,\" asked Franz, \"what do you wish me to do with this paper?\"\n\n\"To preserve it, sealed up as it is, doubtless,\" said the procureur.\n\n\"No,\" replied Noirtier eagerly.\n\n\"Do you wish him to read it?\" said Valentine.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the old man. \"You understand, baron, my grandfather\nwishes you to read this paper,\" said Valentine.\n\n\"Then let us sit down,\" said Villefort impatiently, \"for it will take\nsome time.\"\n\n\"Sit down,\" said the old man. Villefort took a chair, but Valentine\nremained standing by her father's side, and Franz before him, holding\nthe mysterious paper in his hand. \"Read,\" said the old man. Franz untied\nit, and in the midst of the most profound silence read:\n\n\"'Extract from the Report of a meeting of the Bonapartist Club in the\nRue Saint-Jacques, held February 5th, 1815.'\"\n\nFranz stopped. \"February 5th, 1815!\" said he; \"it is the day my father\nwas murdered.\" Valentine and Villefort were dumb; the eye of the old man\nalone seemed to say clearly, \"Go on.\"\n\n\"But it was on leaving this club,\" said he, \"my father disappeared.\"\nNoirtier's eye continued to say, \"Read.\" He resumed:--\n\n\"'The undersigned Louis Jacques Beaurepaire, lieutenant-colonel of\nartillery, Etienne Duchampy, general of brigade, and Claude Lecharpal,\nkeeper of woods and forests, Declare, that on the 4th of February, a\nletter arrived from the Island of Elba, recommending to the kindness and\nthe confidence of the Bonapartist Club, General Flavien de Quesnel, who\nhaving served the emperor from 1804. to 1814 was supposed to be devoted\nto the interests of the Napoleon dynasty, notwithstanding the title\nof baron which Louis XVIII. had just granted to him with his estate of\nEpinay.\n\n\"'A note was in consequence addressed to General de Quesnel, begging\nhim to be present at the meeting next day, the 5th. The note indicated\nneither the street nor the number of the house where the meeting was to\nbe held; it bore no signature, but it announced to the general that\nsome one would call for him if he would be ready at nine o'clock. The\nmeetings were always held from that time till midnight. At nine o'clock\nthe president of the club presented himself; the general was ready, the\npresident informed him that one of the conditions of his introduction\nwas that he should be eternally ignorant of the place of meeting, and\nthat he would allow his eyes to be bandaged, swearing that he would\nnot endeavor to take off the bandage. General de Quesnel accepted the\ncondition, and promised on his honor not to seek to discover the road\nthey took. The general's carriage was ready, but the president told him\nit was impossible for him to use it, since it was useless to blindfold\nthe master if the coachman knew through what streets he went. \"What must\nbe done then?\" asked the general.--\"I have my carriage here,\" said the\npresident.\n\n\"'\"Have you, then, so much confidence in your servant that you can\nintrust him with a secret you will not allow me to know?\"\n\n\"'\"Our coachman is a member of the club,\" said the president; \"we shall\nbe driven by a State-Councillor.\"\n\n\"'\"Then we run another risk,\" said the general, laughing, \"that of being\nupset.\" We insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the\nleast compelled to attend the meeting, but that he came willingly. When\nthey were seated in the carriage the president reminded the general\nof his promise to allow his eyes to be bandaged, to which he made no\nopposition. On the road the president thought he saw the general make an\nattempt to remove the handkerchief, and reminded him of his oath. \"Sure\nenough,\" said the general. The carriage stopped at an alley leading out\nof the Rue Saint-Jacques. The general alighted, leaning on the arm of\nthe president, of whose dignity he was not aware, considering him simply\nas a member of the club; they went through the alley, mounted a flight\nof stairs, and entered the assembly-room.\n\n\"'The deliberations had already begun. The members, apprised of the\nsort of presentation which was to be made that evening, were all in\nattendance. When in the middle of the room the general was invited to\nremove his bandage, he did so immediately, and was surprised to see so\nmany well-known faces in a society of whose existence he had till\nthen been ignorant. They questioned him as to his sentiments, but he\ncontented himself with answering, that the letters from the Island of\nElba ought to have informed them'\"--\n\nFranz interrupted himself by saying, \"My father was a royalist; they\nneed not have asked his sentiments, which were well known.\"\n\n\"And hence,\" said Villefort, \"arose my affection for your father, my\ndear M. Franz. Opinions held in common are a ready bond of union.\"\n\n\"Read again,\" said the old man. Franz continued:--\n\n\"'The president then sought to make him speak more explicitly, but M. de\nQuesnel replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him.\nHe was then informed of the contents of the letter from the Island of\nElba, in which he was recommended to the club as a man who would be\nlikely to advance the interests of their party. One paragraph spoke of\nthe return of Bonaparte and promised another letter and further details,\non the arrival of the Pharaon belonging to the shipbuilder Morrel, of\nMarseilles, whose captain was entirely devoted to the emperor. During\nall this time, the general, on whom they thought to have relied as on a\nbrother, manifested evidently signs of discontent and repugnance. When\nthe reading was finished, he remained silent, with knitted brows.\n\n\"'\"Well,\" asked the president, \"what do you say to this letter,\ngeneral?\"\n\n\"'\"I say that it is too soon after declaring myself for Louis XVIII. to\nbreak my vow in behalf of the ex-emperor.\" This answer was too clear\nto permit of any mistake as to his sentiments. \"General,\" said the\npresident, \"we acknowledge no King Louis XVIII., or an ex-emperor,\nbut his majesty the emperor and king, driven from France, which is his\nkingdom, by violence and treason.\"\n\n\"'\"Excuse me, gentlemen,\" said the general; \"you may not acknowledge\nLouis XVIII., but I do, as he has made me a baron and a field-marshal,\nand I shall never forget that for these two titles I am indebted to his\nhappy return to France.\"\n\n\"'\"Sir,\" said the president, rising with gravity, \"be careful what you\nsay; your words clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you\nin the Island of Elba, and have deceived us! The communication has been\nmade to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you, and which\ndoes you honor. Now we discover our error; a title and promotion attach\nyou to the government we wish to overturn. We will not constrain you to\nhelp us; we enroll no one against his conscience, but we will compel you\nto act generously, even if you are not disposed to do so.\"\n\n\"'\"You would call acting generously, knowing your conspiracy and\nnot informing against you, that is what I should call becoming your\naccomplice. You see I am more candid than you.\"'\"\n\n\"Ah, my father!\" said Franz, interrupting himself. \"I understand now why\nthey murdered him.\" Valentine could not help casting one glance towards\nthe young man, whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold.\nVillefort walked to and fro behind them. Noirtier watched the expression\nof each one, and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude. Franz\nreturned to the manuscript, and continued:--\n\n\"'\"Sir,\" said the president, \"you have been invited to join this\nassembly--you were not forced here; it was proposed to you to come\nblindfolded--you accepted. When you complied with this twofold request\nyou well knew we did not wish to secure the throne of Louis XVIII., or\nwe should not take so much care to avoid the vigilance of the police. It\nwould be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you\nin the discovery of our secret, and then to remove it that you may\nruin those who have confided in you. No, no, you must first say if\nyou declare yourself for the king of a day who now reigns, or for his\nmajesty the emperor.\"\n\n\"'\"I am a royalist,\" replied the general; \"I have taken the oath of\nallegiance to Louis XVIII., and I will adhere to it.\" These words were\nfollowed by a general murmur, and it was evident that several of the\nmembers were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of\nhis rashness.\n\n\"'The president again arose, and having imposed silence, said,--\"Sir,\nyou are too serious and too sensible a man not to understand the\nconsequences of our present situation, and your candor has already\ndictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you.\" The\ngeneral, putting his hand on his sword, exclaimed,--\"If you talk of\nhonor, do not begin by disavowing its laws, and impose nothing by\nviolence.\"\n\n\"'\"And you, sir,\" continued the president, with a calmness still more\nterrible than the general's anger, \"I advise you not to touch your\nsword.\" The general looked around him with slight uneasiness; however\nhe did not yield, but calling up all his fortitude, said,--\"I will not\nswear.\"\n\n\"'\"Then you must die,\" replied the president calmly. M. d'Epinay became\nvery pale; he looked round him a second time, several members of the\nclub were whispering, and getting their arms from under their cloaks.\n\"General,\" said the president, \"do not alarm yourself; you are among men\nof honor who will use every means to convince you before resorting to\nthe last extremity, but as you have said, you are among conspirators,\nyou are in possession of our secret, and you must restore it to us.\"\nA significant silence followed these words, and as the general did not\nreply,--\"Close the doors,\" said the president to the door-keeper.\n\n\"'The same deadly silence succeeded these words. Then the general\nadvanced, and making a violent effort to control his feelings,--\"I have\na son,\" said he, \"and I ought to think of him, finding myself among\nassassins.\"\n\n\"'\"General,\" said the chief of the assembly, \"one man may insult\nfifty--it is the privilege of weakness. But he does wrong to use his\nprivilege. Follow my advice, swear, and do not insult.\" The general,\nagain daunted by the superiority of the chief, hesitated a moment; then\nadvancing to the president's desk,--\"What is the form, said he.\n\n\"'\"It is this:--'I swear by my honor not to reveal to any one what I\nhave seen and heard on the 5th of February, 1815, between nine and\nten o'clock in the evening; and I plead guilty of death should I ever\nviolate this oath.'\" The general appeared to be affected by a nervous\ntremor, which prevented his answering for some moments; then, overcoming\nhis manifest repugnance, he pronounced the required oath, but in so low\na tone as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members, who\ninsisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly, which he did.\n\n\"'\"Now am I at liberty to retire?\" said the general. The president rose,\nappointed three members to accompany him, and got into the carriage with\nthe general after bandaging his eyes. One of those three members was\nthe coachman who had driven them there. The other members\nsilently dispersed. \"Where do you wish to be taken?\" asked the\npresident.--\"Anywhere out of your presence,\" replied M. d'Epinay.\n\"Beware, sir,\" replied the president, \"you are no longer in the\nassembly, and have only to do with individuals; do not insult them\nunless you wish to be held responsible.\" But instead of listening, M.\nd'Epinay went on,--\"You are still as brave in your carriage as in your\nassembly because you are still four against one.\" The president stopped\nthe coach. They were at that part of the Quai des Ormes where the steps\nlead down to the river. \"Why do you stop here?\" asked d'Epinay.\n\n\"'\"Because, sir,\" said the president, \"you have insulted a man, and\nthat man will not go one step farther without demanding honorable\nreparation.\"\n\n\"'\"Another method of assassination?\" said the general, shrugging his\nshoulders.\n\n\"'\"Make no noise, sir, unless you wish me to consider you as one of the\nmen of whom you spoke just now as cowards, who take their weakness for\na shield. You are alone, one alone shall answer you; you have a sword\nby your side, I have one in my cane; you have no witness, one of these\ngentlemen will serve you. Now, if you please, remove your bandage.\"\nThe general tore the handkerchief from his eyes. \"At last,\" said he, \"I\nshall know with whom I have to do.\" They opened the door and the four\nmen alighted.'\"\n\nFranz again interrupted himself, and wiped the cold drops from his brow;\nthere was something awful in hearing the son read aloud in trembling\npallor these details of his father's death, which had hitherto been a\nmystery. Valentine clasped her hands as if in prayer. Noirtier looked at\nVillefort with an almost sublime expression of contempt and pride. Franz\ncontinued:--\n\n\"'It was, as we said, the fifth of February. For three days the mercury\nhad been five or six degrees below freezing and the steps were covered\nwith ice. The general was stout and tall, the president offered him the\nside of the railing to assist him in getting down. The two witnesses\nfollowed. It was a dark night. The ground from the steps to the river\nwas covered with snow and hoarfrost, the water of the river looked black\nand deep. One of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal-barge near,\nand by its light they examined the weapons. The president's sword, which\nwas simply, as he had said, one he carried in his cane, was five inches\nshorter than the general's, and had no guard. The general proposed to\ncast lots for the swords, but the president said it was he who had given\nthe provocation, and when he had given it he had supposed each would use\nhis own arms. The witnesses endeavored to insist, but the president\nbade them be silent. The lantern was placed on the ground, the two\nadversaries took their stations, and the duel began. The light made the\ntwo swords appear like flashes of lightning; as for the men, they were\nscarcely perceptible, the darkness was so great.\n\n\"'General d'Epinay passed for one of the best swordsmen in the army, but\nhe was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell.\nThe witnesses thought he was dead, but his adversary, who knew he had\nnot struck him, offered him the assistance of his hand to rise. The\ncircumstance irritated instead of calming the general, and he rushed on\nhis adversary. But his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken.\nHe received him on his sword and three times the general drew back on\nfinding himself too closely engaged, and then returned to the charge. At\nthe third he fell again. They thought he slipped, as at first, and the\nwitnesses, seeing he did not move, approached and endeavored to raise\nhim, but the one who passed his arm around the body found it was\nmoistened with blood. The general, who had almost fainted, revived.\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"they have sent some fencing-master to fight with me.\"\nThe president, without answering, approached the witness who held the\nlantern, and raising his sleeve, showed him two wounds he had received\nin his arm; then opening his coat, and unbuttoning his waistcoat,\ndisplayed his side, pierced with a third wound. Still he had not even\nuttered a sigh. General d'Epinay died five minutes after.'\"\n\nFranz read these last words in a voice so choked that they were hardly\naudible, and then stopped, passing his hand over his eyes as if to\ndispel a cloud; but after a moment's silence, he continued:--\n\n\"'The president went up the steps, after pushing his sword into his\ncane; a track of blood on the snow marked his course. He had scarcely\narrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the water--it was the\ngeneral's body, which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after\nascertaining that he was dead. The general fell, then, in a loyal duel,\nand not in ambush as it might have been reported. In proof of this we\nhave signed this paper to establish the truth of the facts, lest the\nmoment should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible scene\nshould be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the laws\nof honor.\n\n\"'Signed, Beaurepaire, Deschamps, and Lecharpal.'\"\n\nWhen Franz had finished reading this account, so dreadful for a\nson; when Valentine, pale with emotion, had wiped away a tear; when\nVillefort, trembling, and crouched in a corner, had endeavored to lessen\nthe storm by supplicating glances at the implacable old man,--\"Sir,\"\nsaid d'Epinay to Noirtier, \"since you are well acquainted with all these\ndetails, which are attested by honorable signatures,--since you appear\nto take some interest in me, although you have only manifested\nit hitherto by causing me sorrow, refuse me not one final\nsatisfaction--tell me the name of the president of the club, that I may\nat least know who killed my father.\" Villefort mechanically felt for\nthe handle of the door; Valentine, who understood sooner than anyone her\ngrandfather's answer, and who had often seen two scars upon his right\narm, drew back a few steps. \"Mademoiselle,\" said Franz, turning towards\nValentine, \"unite your efforts with mine to find out the name of the man\nwho made me an orphan at two years of age.\" Valentine remained dumb and\nmotionless.\n\n\"Hold, sir,\" said Villefort, \"do not prolong this dreadful scene. The\nnames have been purposely concealed; my father himself does not know who\nthis president was, and if he knows, he cannot tell you; proper names\nare not in the dictionary.\"\n\n\"Oh, misery,\" cried Franz: \"the only hope which sustained me and enabled\nme to read to the end was that of knowing, at least, the name of him who\nkilled my father! Sir, sir,\" cried he, turning to Noirtier, \"do what you\ncan--make me understand in some way!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Noirtier.\n\n\"Oh, mademoiselle,--mademoiselle!\" cried Franz, \"your grandfather says\nhe can indicate the person. Help me,--lend me your assistance!\" Noirtier\nlooked at the dictionary. Franz took it with a nervous trembling, and\nrepeated the letters of the alphabet successively, until he came to M.\nAt that letter the old man signified \"Yes.\"\n\n\"M,\" repeated Franz. The young man's finger, glided over the words, but\nat each one Noirtier answered by a negative sign. Valentine hid her head\nbetween her hands. At length, Franz arrived at the word MYSELF.\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"You?\" cried Franz, whose hair stood on end; \"you, M. Noirtier--you\nkilled my father?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" replied Noirtier, fixing a majestic look on the young man. Franz\nfell powerless on a chair; Villefort opened the door and escaped, for\nthe idea had entered his mind to stifle the little remaining life in the\nheart of this terrible old man.\n\n\n\nChapter 76. Progress of Cavalcanti the Younger.\n\nMeanwhile M. Cavalcanti the elder had returned to his service, not in\nthe army of his majesty the Emperor of Austria, but at the gaming-table\nof the baths of Lucca, of which he was one of the most assiduous\ncourtiers. He had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his\njourney as a reward for the majestic and solemn manner in which he had\nmaintained his assumed character of father. M. Andrea at his departure\ninherited all the papers which proved that he had indeed the honor\nof being the son of the Marquis Bartolomeo and the Marchioness Oliva\nCorsinari. He was now fairly launched in that Parisian society which\ngives such ready access to foreigners, and treats them, not as they\nreally are, but as they wish to be considered. Besides, what is required\nof a young man in Paris? To speak its language tolerably, to make a\ngood appearance, to be a good gamester, and to pay in cash. They are\ncertainly less particular with a foreigner than with a Frenchman. Andrea\nhad, then, in a fortnight, attained a very fair position. He was called\ncount, he was said to possess 50,000 livres per annum; and his father's\nimmense riches, buried in the quarries of Saravezza, were a constant\ntheme. A learned man, before whom the last circumstance was mentioned as\na fact, declared he had seen the quarries in question, which gave great\nweight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful, but which now assumed\nthe garb of reality.\n\nSuch was the state of society in Paris at the period we bring before our\nreaders, when Monte Cristo went one evening to pay M. Danglars a visit.\nM. Danglars was out, but the count was asked to go and see the baroness,\nand he accepted the invitation. It was never without a nervous shudder,\nsince the dinner at Auteuil, and the events which followed it, that\nMadame Danglars heard Monte Cristo's name announced. If he did not\ncome, the painful sensation became most intense; if, on the contrary, he\nappeared, his noble countenance, his brilliant eyes, his amiability,\nhis polite attention even towards Madame Danglars, soon dispelled every\nimpression of fear. It appeared impossible to the baroness that a man of\nsuch delightfully pleasing manners should entertain evil designs against\nher; besides, the most corrupt minds only suspect evil when it would\nanswer some interested end--useless injury is repugnant to every mind.\nWhen Monte Cristo entered the boudoir,--to which we have already once\nintroduced our readers, and where the baroness was examining some\ndrawings, which her daughter passed to her after having looked at them\nwith M. Cavalcanti,--his presence soon produced its usual effect, and it\nwas with smiles that the baroness received the count, although she had\nbeen a little disconcerted at the announcement of his name. The latter\ntook in the whole scene at a glance.\n\nThe baroness was partially reclining on a sofa, Eugenie sat near her,\nand Cavalcanti was standing. Cavalcanti, dressed in black, like one\nof Goethe's heroes, with varnished shoes and white silk open-worked\nstockings, passed a white and tolerably nice-looking hand through his\nlight hair, and so displayed a sparkling diamond, that in spite of Monte\nCristo's advice the vain young man had been unable to resist putting on\nhis little finger. This movement was accompanied by killing glances\nat Mademoiselle Danglars, and by sighs launched in the same direction.\nMademoiselle Danglars was still the same--cold, beautiful, and\nsatirical. Not one of these glances, nor one sigh, was lost on her;\nthey might have been said to fall on the shield of Minerva, which some\nphilosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of Sappho. Eugenie\nbowed coldly to the count, and availed herself of the first moment when\nthe conversation became earnest to escape to her study, whence very soon\ntwo cheerful and noisy voices being heard in connection with occasional\nnotes of the piano assured Monte Cristo that Mademoiselle Danglars\npreferred to his society and to that of M. Cavalcanti the company of\nMademoiselle Louise d'Armilly, her singing teacher.\n\nIt was then, especially while conversing with Madame Danglars, and\napparently absorbed by the charm of the conversation, that the count\nnoticed M. Andrea Cavalcanti's solicitude, his manner of listening\nto the music at the door he dared not pass, and of manifesting his\nadmiration. The banker soon returned. His first look was certainly\ndirected towards Monte Cristo, but the second was for Andrea. As for his\nwife, he bowed to her, as some husbands do to their wives, but in a way\nthat bachelors will never comprehend, until a very extensive code is\npublished on conjugal life.\n\n\"Have not the ladies invited you to join them at the piano?\" said\nDanglars to Andrea. \"Alas, no, sir,\" replied Andrea with a sigh, still\nmore remarkable than the former ones. Danglars immediately advanced\ntowards the door and opened it.\n\nThe two young ladies were seen seated on the same chair, at the piano,\naccompanying themselves, each with one hand, a fancy to which they had\naccustomed themselves, and performed admirably. Mademoiselle d'Armilly,\nwhom they then perceived through the open doorway, formed with Eugenie\none of the tableaux vivants of which the Germans are so fond. She was\nsomewhat beautiful, and exquisitely formed--a little fairy-like figure,\nwith large curls falling on her neck, which was rather too long, as\nPerugino sometimes makes his Virgins, and her eyes dull from fatigue.\nShe was said to have a weak chest, and like Antonia in the \"Cremona\nViolin,\" she would die one day while singing. Monte Cristo cast one\nrapid and curious glance round this sanctum; it was the first time he\nhad ever seen Mademoiselle d'Armilly, of whom he had heard much. \"Well,\"\nsaid the banker to his daughter, \"are we then all to be excluded?\" He\nthen led the young man into the study, and either by chance or manoeuvre\nthe door was partially closed after Andrea, so that from the place where\nthey sat neither the Count nor the baroness could see anything; but as\nthe banker had accompanied Andrea, Madame Danglars appeared to take no\nnotice of it.\n\nThe count soon heard Andrea's voice, singing a Corsican song,\naccompanied by the piano. While the count smiled at hearing this song,\nwhich made him lose sight of Andrea in the recollection of Benedetto,\nMadame Danglars was boasting to Monte Cristo of her husband's strength\nof mind, who that very morning had lost three or four hundred thousand\nfrancs by a failure at Milan. The praise was well deserved, for had not\nthe count heard it from the baroness, or by one of those means by which\nhe knew everything, the baron's countenance would not have led him\nto suspect it. \"Hem,\" thought Monte Cristo, \"he begins to conceal his\nlosses; a month since he boasted of them.\" Then aloud,--\"Oh, madame, M.\nDanglars is so skilful, he will soon regain at the Bourse what he loses\nelsewhere.\"\n\n\"I see that you participate in a prevalent error,\" said Madame Danglars.\n\"What is it?\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"That M. Danglars speculates, whereas he never does.\"\n\n\"Truly, madame, I recollect M. Debray told me--apropos, what is become\nof him? I have seen nothing of him the last three or four days.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" said Madame Danglars; \"but you began a sentence, sir, and did\nnot finish.\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"M. Debray had told you\"--\n\n\"Ah, yes; he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of\nspeculation.\"\n\n\"I was once very fond of it, but I do not indulge now.\"\n\n\"Then you are wrong, madame. Fortune is precarious; and if I were\na woman and fate had made me a banker's wife, whatever might be my\nconfidence in my husband's good fortune, still in speculation you\nknow there is great risk. Well, I would secure for myself a fortune\nindependent of him, even if I acquired it by placing my interests in\nhands unknown to him.\" Madame Danglars blushed, in spite of all her\nefforts. \"Stay,\" said Monte Cristo, as though he had not observed her\nconfusion, \"I have heard of a lucky hit that was made yesterday on the\nNeapolitan bonds.\"\n\n\"I have none--nor have I ever possessed any; but really we have talked\nlong enough of money, count, we are like two stockbrokers; have you\nheard how fate is persecuting the poor Villeforts?\"\n\n\"What has happened?\" said the count, simulating total ignorance.\n\n\"You know the Marquis of Saint-Meran died a few days after he had set\nout on his journey to Paris, and the marchioness a few days after her\narrival?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Monte Cristo, \"I have heard that; but, as Claudius said to\nHamlet, 'it is a law of nature; their fathers died before them, and they\nmourned their loss; they will die before their children, who will, in\ntheir turn, grieve for them.'\"\n\n\"But that is not all.\"\n\n\"Not all!\"\n\n\"No; they were going to marry their daughter\"--\n\n\"To M. Franz d'Epinay. Is it broken off?\"\n\n\"Yesterday morning, it appears, Franz declined the honor.\"\n\n\"Indeed? And is the reason known?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"How extraordinary! And how does M. de Villefort bear it?\"\n\n\"As usual. Like a philosopher.\" Danglars returned at this moment\nalone. \"Well,\" said the baroness, \"do you leave M. Cavalcanti with your\ndaughter?\"\n\n\"And Mademoiselle d'Armilly,\" said the banker; \"do you consider her no\none?\" Then, turning to Monte Cristo, he said, \"Prince Cavalcanti is a\ncharming young man, is he not? But is he really a prince?\"\n\n\"I will not answer for it,\" said Monte Cristo. \"His father was\nintroduced to me as a marquis, so he ought to be a count; but I do not\nthink he has much claim to that title.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said the banker. \"If he is a prince, he is wrong not to maintain\nhis rank; I do not like any one to deny his origin.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are a thorough democrat,\" said Monte Cristo, smiling.\n\n\"But do you see to what you are exposing yourself?\" said the baroness.\n\"If, perchance, M. de Morcerf came, he would find M. Cavalcanti in that\nroom, where he, the betrothed of Eugenie, has never been admitted.\"\n\n\"You may well say, perchance,\" replied the banker; \"for he comes so\nseldom, it would seem only chance that brings him.\"\n\n\"But should he come and find that young man with your daughter, he might\nbe displeased.\"\n\n\"He? You are mistaken. M. Albert would not do us the honor to be\njealous; he does not like Eugenie sufficiently. Besides, I care not for\nhis displeasure.\"\n\n\"Still, situated as we are\"--\n\n\"Yes, do you know how we are situated? At his mother's ball he danced\nonce with Eugenie, and M. Cavalcanti three times, and he took no notice\nof it.\" The valet announced the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf. The baroness\nrose hastily, and was going into the study, when Danglars stopped her.\n\"Let her alone,\" said he. She looked at him in amazement. Monte Cristo\nappeared to be unconscious of what passed. Albert entered, looking\nvery handsome and in high spirits. He bowed politely to the baroness,\nfamiliarly to Danglars, and affectionately to Monte Cristo. Then turning\nto the baroness: \"May I ask how Mademoiselle Danglars is?\" said he.\n\n\"She is quite well,\" replied Danglars quickly; \"she is at the piano\nwith M. Cavalcanti.\" Albert retained his calm and indifferent manner; he\nmight feel perhaps annoyed, but he knew Monte Cristo's eye was on him.\n\"M. Cavalcanti has a fine tenor voice,\" said he, \"and Mademoiselle\nEugenie a splendid soprano, and then she plays the piano like Thalberg.\nThe concert must be a delightful one.\"\n\n\"They suit each other remarkably well,\" said Danglars. Albert appeared\nnot to notice this remark, which was, however, so rude that Madame\nDanglars blushed.\n\n\"I, too,\" said the young man, \"am a musician--at least, my masters used\nto tell me so; but it is strange that my voice never would suit any\nother, and a soprano less than any.\" Danglars smiled, and seemed to say,\n\"It is of no consequence.\" Then, hoping doubtless to effect his\npurpose, he said,--\"The prince and my daughter were universally admired\nyesterday. You were not of the party, M. de Morcerf?\"\n\n\"What prince?\" asked Albert. \"Prince Cavalcanti,\" said Danglars, who\npersisted in giving the young man that title.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said Albert, \"I was not aware that he was a prince. And\nPrince Cavalcanti sang with Mademoiselle Eugenie yesterday? It must have\nbeen charming, indeed. I regret not having heard them. But I was unable\nto accept your invitation, having promised to accompany my mother to\na German concert given by the Baroness of Chateau-Renaud.\" This was\nfollowed by rather an awkward silence. \"May I also be allowed,\" said\nMorcerf, \"to pay my respects to Mademoiselle Danglars?\" \"Wait a moment,\"\nsaid the banker, stopping the young man; \"do you hear that delightful\ncavatina? Ta, ta, ta, ti, ta, ti, ta, ta; it is charming, let them\nfinish--one moment. Bravo, bravi, brava!\" The banker was enthusiastic in\nhis applause.\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Albert, \"it is exquisite; it is impossible to understand\nthe music of his country better than Prince Cavalcanti does. You said\nprince, did you not? But he can easily become one, if he is not\nalready; it is no uncommon thing in Italy. But to return to the charming\nmusicians--you should give us a treat, Danglars, without telling them\nthere is a stranger. Ask them to sing one more song; it is so delightful\nto hear music in the distance, when the musicians are unrestrained by\nobservation.\"\n\nDanglars was quite annoyed by the young man's indifference. He took\nMonte Cristo aside. \"What do you think of our lover?\" said he.\n\n\"He appears cool. But, then your word is given.\"\n\n\"Yes, doubtless I have promised to give my daughter to a man who loves\nher, but not to one who does not. See him there, cold as marble and\nproud like his father. If he were rich, if he had Cavalcanti's fortune,\nthat might be pardoned. Ma foi, I haven't consulted my daughter; but if\nshe has good taste\"--\n\n\"Oh,\" said Monte Cristo, \"my fondness may blind me, but I assure you\nI consider Morcerf a charming young man who will render your daughter\nhappy and will sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction,\nand his father's position is good.\"\n\n\"Hem,\" said Danglars.\n\n\"Why do you doubt?\"\n\n\"The past--that obscurity on the past.\"\n\n\"But that does not affect the son.\"\n\n\"Very true.\"\n\n\"Now, I beg of you, don't go off your head. It's a month now that you\nhave been thinking of this marriage, and you must see that it throws\nsome responsibility on me, for it was at my house you met this young\nCavalcanti, whom I do not really know at all.\"\n\n\"But I do.\"\n\n\"Have you made inquiry?\"\n\n\"Is there any need of that! Does not his appearance speak for him? And\nhe is very rich.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that.\"\n\n\"And yet you said he had money.\"\n\n\"Fifty thousand livres--a mere trifle.\"\n\n\"He is well educated.\"\n\n\"Hem,\" said Monte Cristo in his turn.\n\n\"He is a musician.\"\n\n\"So are all Italians.\"\n\n\"Come, count, you do not do that young man justice.\"\n\n\"Well, I acknowledge it annoys me, knowing your connection with the\nMorcerf family, to see him throw himself in the way.\" Danglars burst out\nlaughing. \"What a Puritan you are!\" said he; \"that happens every day.\"\n\n\"But you cannot break it off in this way; the Morcerfs are depending on\nthis union.\"\n\n\"Indeed.\"\n\n\"Positively.\"\n\n\"Then let them explain themselves; you should give the father a hint,\nyou are so intimate with the family.\"\n\n\"I?--where the devil did you find out that?\"\n\n\"At their ball; it was apparent enough. Why, did not the countess, the\nproud Mercedes, the disdainful Catalane, who will scarcely open her lips\nto her oldest acquaintances, take your arm, lead you into the garden,\ninto the private walks, and remain there for half an hour?\"\n\n\"Ah, baron, baron,\" said Albert, \"you are not listening--what barbarism\nin a megalomaniac like you!\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about me, Sir Mocker,\" said Danglars; then turning to\nthe count he said, \"but will you undertake to speak to the father?\"\n\n\"Willingly, if you wish it.\"\n\n\"But let it be done explicitly and positively. If he demands my daughter\nlet him fix the day--declare his conditions; in short, let us either\nunderstand each other, or quarrel. You understand--no more delay.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I will give my attention to the subject.\"\n\n\"I do not say that I await with pleasure his decision, but I do await\nit. A banker must, you know, be a slave to his promise.\" And Danglars\nsighed as M. Cavalcanti had done half an hour before. \"Bravi, bravo,\nbrava!\" cried Morcerf, parodying the banker, as the selection came to an\nend. Danglars began to look suspiciously at Morcerf, when some one came\nand whispered a few words to him. \"I shall soon return,\" said the banker\nto Monte Cristo; \"wait for me. I shall, perhaps, have something to say\nto you.\" And he went out.\n\nThe baroness took advantage of her husband's absence to push open the\ndoor of her daughter's study, and M. Andrea, who was sitting before\nthe piano with Mademoiselle Eugenie, started up like a jack-in-the-box.\nAlbert bowed with a smile to Mademoiselle Danglars, who did not appear\nin the least disturbed, and returned his bow with her usual coolness.\nCavalcanti was evidently embarrassed; he bowed to Morcerf, who replied\nwith the most impertinent look possible. Then Albert launched out in\npraise of Mademoiselle Danglars' voice, and on his regret, after what\nhe had just heard, that he had been unable to be present the previous\nevening. Cavalcanti, being left alone, turned to Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Come,\" said Madame Danglars, \"leave music and compliments, and let us\ngo and take tea.\"\n\n\"Come, Louise,\" said Mademoiselle Danglars to her friend. They passed\ninto the next drawing-room, where tea was prepared. Just as they were\nbeginning, in the English fashion, to leave the spoons in their cups,\nthe door again opened and Danglars entered, visibly agitated. Monte\nCristo observed it particularly, and by a look asked the banker for\nan explanation. \"I have just received my courier from Greece,\" said\nDanglars.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said the count; \"that was the reason of your running away\nfrom us.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How is King Otho getting on?\" asked Albert in the most sprightly tone.\nDanglars cast another suspicious look towards him without answering, and\nMonte Cristo turned away to conceal the expression of pity which\npassed over his features, but which was gone in a moment. \"We shall go\ntogether, shall we not?\" said Albert to the count.\n\n\"If you like,\" replied the latter. Albert could not understand\nthe banker's look, and turning to Monte Cristo, who understood it\nperfectly,--\"Did you see,\" said he, \"how he looked at me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the count; \"but did you think there was anything particular\nin his look?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I did; and what does he mean by his news from Greece?\"\n\n\"How can I tell you?\"\n\n\"Because I imagine you have correspondents in that country.\" Monte\nCristo smiled significantly.\n\n\"Stop,\" said Albert, \"here he comes. I shall compliment Mademoiselle\nDanglars on her cameo, while the father talks to you.\"\n\n\"If you compliment her at all, let it be on her voice, at least,\" said\nMonte Cristo.\n\n\"No, every one would do that.\"\n\n\"My dear viscount, you are dreadfully impertinent.\" Albert advanced\ntowards Eugenie, smiling. Meanwhile, Danglars, stooping to Monte\nCristo's ear, \"Your advice was excellent,\" said he; \"there is a whole\nhistory connected with the names Fernand and Yanina.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Yes, I will tell you all; but take away the young man; I cannot endure\nhis presence.\"\n\n\"He is going with me. Shall I send the father to you?\"\n\n\"Immediately.\"\n\n\"Very well.\" The count made a sign to Albert and they bowed to\nthe ladies, and took their leave, Albert perfectly indifferent to\nMademoiselle Danglars' contempt, Monte Cristo reiterating his advice\nto Madame Danglars on the prudence a banker's wife should exercise in\nproviding for the future. M. Cavalcanti remained master of the field.\n\n\n\nChapter 77. Haidee.\n\nScarcely had the count's horses cleared the angle of the boulevard,\nthan Albert, turning towards the count, burst into a loud fit of\nlaughter--much too loud in fact not to give the idea of its being rather\nforced and unnatural. \"Well,\" said he, \"I will ask you the same question\nwhich Charles IX. put to Catherine de Medicis, after the massacre of\nSaint Bartholomew, 'How have I played my little part?'\"\n\n\"To what do you allude?\" asked Monte Cristo.\n\n\"To the installation of my rival at M. Danglars'.\"\n\n\"What rival?\"\n\n\"Ma foi, what rival? Why, your protege, M. Andrea Cavalcanti!\"\n\n\"Ah, no joking, viscount, if you please; I do not patronize M.\nAndrea--at least, not as concerns M. Danglars.\"\n\n\"And you would be to blame for not assisting him, if the young man\nreally needed your help in that quarter, but, happily for me, he can\ndispense with it.\"\n\n\"What, do you think he is paying his addresses?\"\n\n\"I am certain of it; his languishing looks and modulated tones when\naddressing Mademoiselle Danglars fully proclaim his intentions. He\naspires to the hand of the proud Eugenie.\"\n\n\"What does that signify, so long as they favor your suit?\"\n\n\"But it is not the case, my dear count: on the contrary. I am repulsed\non all sides.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"It is so indeed; Mademoiselle Eugenie scarcely answers me, and\nMademoiselle d'Armilly, her confidant, does not speak to me at all.\"\n\n\"But the father has the greatest regard possible for you,\" said Monte\nCristo.\n\n\"He? Oh, no, he has plunged a thousand daggers into my heart,\ntragedy-weapons, I own, which instead of wounding sheathe their points\nin their own handles, but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be\nreal and deadly.\"\n\n\"Jealousy indicates affection.\"\n\n\"True; but I am not jealous.\"\n\n\"He is.\"\n\n\"Of whom?--of Debray?\"\n\n\"No, of you.\"\n\n\"Of me? I will engage to say that before a week is past the door will be\nclosed against me.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, my dear viscount.\"\n\n\"Prove it to me.\"\n\n\"Do you wish me to do so?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, I am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the\nComte de Morcerf to make some definite arrangement with the baron.\"\n\n\"By whom are you charged?\"\n\n\"By the baron himself.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Albert with all the cajolery of which he was capable. \"You\nsurely will not do that, my dear count?\"\n\n\"Certainly I shall, Albert, as I have promised to do it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Albert, with a sigh, \"it seems you are determined to marry\nme.\"\n\n\"I am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody, at all\nevents,\" said Monte Cristo. \"But apropos of Debray, how is it that I\nhave not seen him lately at the baron's house?\"\n\n\"There has been a misunderstanding.\"\n\n\"What, with the baroness?\"\n\n\"No, with the baron.\"\n\n\"Has he perceived anything?\"\n\n\"Ah, that is a good joke!\"\n\n\"Do you think he suspects?\" said Monte Cristo with charming artlessness.\n\n\"Where have you come from, my dear count?\" said Albert.\n\n\"From Congo, if you will.\"\n\n\"It must be farther off than even that.\"\n\n\"But what do I know of your Parisian husbands?\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear count, husbands are pretty much the same everywhere; an\nindividual husband of any country is a pretty fair specimen of the whole\nrace.\"\n\n\"But then, what can have led to the quarrel between Danglars and Debray?\nThey seemed to understand each other so well,\" said Monte Cristo with\nrenewed energy.\n\n\"Ah, now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of Isis, in\nwhich I am not initiated. When M. Andrea Cavalcanti has become one of\nthe family, you can ask him that question.\" The carriage stopped. \"Here\nwe are,\" said Monte Cristo; \"it is only half-past ten o'clock, come in.\"\n\n\"Certainly I will.\"\n\n\"My carriage shall take you back.\"\n\n\"No, thank you; I gave orders for my coupe to follow me.\"\n\n\"There it is, then,\" said Monte Cristo, as he stepped out of the\ncarriage. They both went into the house; the drawing-room was lighted\nup--they went in there. \"You will make tea for us, Baptistin,\" said the\ncount. Baptistin left the room without waiting to answer, and in\ntwo seconds reappeared, bringing on a waiter all that his master had\nordered, ready prepared, and appearing to have sprung from the ground,\nlike the repasts which we read of in fairy tales. \"Really, my dear\ncount,\" said Morcerf, \"what I admire in you is, not so much your riches,\nfor perhaps there are people even wealthier than yourself, nor is it\nonly your wit, for Beaumarchais might have possessed as much,--but it\nis your manner of being served, without any questions, in a moment, in\na second; it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your manner of\nringing, and made a point of keeping everything you can possibly desire\nin constant readiness.\"\n\n\"What you say is perhaps true; they know my habits. For instance, you\nshall see; how do you wish to occupy yourself during tea-time?\"\n\n\"Ma foi, I should like to smoke.\"\n\nMonte Cristo took the gong and struck it once. In about the space of a\nsecond a private door opened, and Ali appeared, bringing two chibouques\nfilled with excellent latakia. \"It is quite wonderful,\" said Albert.\n\n\"Oh no, it is as simple as possible,\" replied Monte Cristo. \"Ali knows I\ngenerally smoke while I am taking my tea or coffee; he has heard that I\nordered tea, and he also knows that I brought you home with me; when I\nsummoned him he naturally guessed the reason of my doing so, and as he\ncomes from a country where hospitality is especially manifested through\nthe medium of smoking, he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in\ncompany, and therefore brings two chibouques instead of one--and now the\nmystery is solved.\"\n\n\"Certainly you give a most commonplace air to your explanation, but\nit is not the less true that you--Ah, but what do I hear?\" and Morcerf\ninclined his head towards the door, through which sounds seemed to issue\nresembling those of a guitar.\n\n\"Ma foi, my dear viscount, you are fated to hear music this evening; you\nhave only escaped from Mademoiselle Danglars' piano, to be attacked by\nHaidee's guzla.\"\n\n\"Haidee--what an adorable name! Are there, then, really women who bear\nthe name of Haidee anywhere but in Byron's poems?\"\n\n\"Certainly there are. Haidee is a very uncommon name in France, but is\ncommon enough in Albania and Epirus; it is as if you said, for example,\nChastity, Modesty, Innocence,--it is a kind of baptismal name, as you\nParisians call it.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is charming,\" said Albert, \"how I should like to hear my\ncountrywomen called Mademoiselle Goodness, Mademoiselle Silence,\nMademoiselle Christian Charity! Only think, then, if Mademoiselle\nDanglars, instead of being called Claire-Marie-Eugenie, had been named\nMademoiselle Chastity-Modesty-Innocence Danglars; what a fine effect\nthat would have produced on the announcement of her marriage!\"\n\n\"Hush,\" said the count, \"do not joke in so loud a tone; Haidee may hear\nyou, perhaps.\"\n\n\"And you think she would be angry?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not,\" said the count with a haughty expression.\n\n\"She is very amiable, then, is she not?\" said Albert.\n\n\"It is not to be called amiability, it is her duty; a slave does not\ndictate to a master.\"\n\n\"Come; you are joking yourself now. Are there any more slaves to be had\nwho bear this beautiful name?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"Really, count, you do nothing, and have nothing like other people.\nThe slave of the Count of Monte Cristo! Why, it is a rank of itself in\nFrance, and from the way in which you lavish money, it is a place that\nmust be worth a hundred thousand francs a year.\"\n\n\"A hundred thousand francs! The poor girl originally possessed much\nmore than that; she was born to treasures in comparison with which those\nrecorded in the 'Thousand and One Nights' would seem but poverty.\"\n\n\"She must be a princess then.\"\n\n\"You are right; and she is one of the greatest in her country too.\"\n\n\"I thought so. But how did it happen that such a great princess became a\nslave?\"\n\n\"How was it that Dionysius the Tyrant became a schoolmaster? The fortune\nof war, my dear viscount,--the caprice of fortune; that is the way in\nwhich these things are to be accounted for.\"\n\n\"And is her name a secret?\"\n\n\"As regards the generality of mankind it is; but not for you, my dear\nviscount, who are one of my most intimate friends, and on whose silence\nI feel I may rely, if I consider it necessary to enjoin it--may I not do\nso?\"\n\n\"Certainly; on my word of honor.\"\n\n\"You know the history of the Pasha  of Yanina, do you not?\"\n\n\"Of Ali Tepelini? [*] Oh, yes; it was in his service that my father made\nhis fortune.\"\n\n\"True, I had forgotten that.\"\n\n     * Ali Pasha, \"The Lion,\" was born at Tepelini, an Albanian\n     village at the foot of the Klissoura Mountains, in 1741. By\n     diplomacy and success in arms he became almost supreme ruler\n     of Albania, Epirus, and adjacent territory. Having aroused\n     the enmity of the Sultan, he was proscribed and put to death\n     by treachery in 1822, at the age of eighty.--Ed.\n\n\"Well, what is Haidee to Ali Tepelini?\"\n\n\"Merely his daughter.\"\n\n\"What? the daughter of Ali Pasha?\"\n\n\"Of Ali Pasha and the beautiful Vasiliki.\"\n\n\"And your slave?\"\n\n\"Ma foi, yes.\"\n\n\"But how did she become so?\"\n\n\"Why, simply from the circumstance of my having bought her one day, as I\nwas passing through the market at Constantinople.\"\n\n\"Wonderful! Really, my dear count, you seem to throw a sort of magic\ninfluence over all in which you are concerned; when I listen to you,\nexistence no longer seems reality, but a waking dream. Now, I am perhaps\ngoing to make an imprudent and thoughtless request, but\"--\n\n\"Say on.\"\n\n\"But, since you go out with Haidee, and sometimes even take her to the\nopera\"--\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I think I may venture to ask you this favor.\"\n\n\"You may venture to ask me anything.\"\n\n\"Well then, my dear count, present me to your princess.\"\n\n\"I will do so; but on two conditions.\"\n\n\"I accept them at once.\"\n\n\"The first is, that you will never tell any one that I have granted the\ninterview.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Albert, extending his hand; \"I swear I will not.\"\n\n\"The second is, that you will not tell her that your father ever served\nhers.\"\n\n\"I give you my oath that I will not.\"\n\n\"Enough, viscount; you will remember those two vows, will you not? But\nI know you to be a man of honor.\" The count again struck the gong. Ali\nreappeared. \"Tell Haidee,\" said he, \"that I will take coffee with her,\nand give her to understand that I desire permission to present one of my\nfriends to her.\" Ali bowed and left the room. \"Now, understand me,\" said\nthe count, \"no direct questions, my dear Morcerf; if you wish to know\nanything, tell me, and I will ask her.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\" Ali reappeared for the third time, and drew back the\ntapestried hanging which concealed the door, to signify to his master\nand Albert that they were at liberty to pass on. \"Let us go in,\" said\nMonte Cristo.\n\nAlbert passed his hand through his hair, and curled his mustache, then,\nhaving satisfied himself as to his personal appearance, followed the\ncount into the room, the latter having previously resumed his hat and\ngloves. Ali was stationed as a kind of advanced guard, and the door was\nkept by the three French attendants, commanded by Myrtho. Haidee was\nawaiting her visitors in the first room of her apartments, which was the\ndrawing-room. Her large eyes were dilated with surprise and expectation,\nfor it was the first time that any man, except Monte Cristo, had been\naccorded an entrance into her presence. She was sitting on a sofa placed\nin an angle of the room, with her legs crossed under her in the Eastern\nfashion, and seemed to have made for herself, as it were, a kind of\nnest in the rich Indian silks which enveloped her. Near her was\nthe instrument on which she had just been playing; it was elegantly\nfashioned, and worthy of its mistress. On perceiving Monte Cristo, she\narose and welcomed him with a smile peculiar to herself, expressive at\nonce of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest love. Monte\nCristo advanced towards her and extended his hand, which she as usual\nraised to her lips.\n\nAlbert had proceeded no farther than the door, where he remained rooted\nto the spot, being completely fascinated by the sight of such surpassing\nbeauty, beheld as it was for the first time, and of which an inhabitant\nof more northern climes could form no adequate idea.\n\n\"Whom do you bring?\" asked the young girl in Romaic, of Monte Cristo;\n\"is it a friend, a brother, a simple acquaintance, or an enemy.\"\n\n\"A friend,\" said Monte Cristo in the same language.\n\n\"What is his name?\"\n\n\"Count Albert; it is the same man whom I rescued from the hands of the\nbanditti at Rome.\"\n\n\"In what language would you like me to converse with him?\"\n\nMonte Cristo turned to Albert. \"Do you know modern Greek,\" asked he.\n\n\"Alas, no,\" said Albert; \"nor even ancient Greek, my dear count; never\nhad Homer or Plato a more unworthy scholar than myself.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Haidee, proving by her remark that she had quite understood\nMonte Cristo's question and Albert's answer, \"then I will speak either\nin French or Italian, if my lord so wills it.\"\n\nMonte Cristo reflected one instant. \"You will speak in Italian,\" said\nhe. Then, turning towards Albert,--\"It is a pity you do not understand\neither ancient or modern Greek, both of which Haidee speaks so fluently;\nthe poor child will be obliged to talk to you in Italian, which will\ngive you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation.\" The\ncount made a sign to Haidee to address his visitor. \"Sir,\" she said to\nMorcerf, \"you are most welcome as the friend of my lord and master.\"\nThis was said in excellent Tuscan, and with that soft Roman accent which\nmakes the language of Dante as sonorous as that of Homer. Then, turning\nto Ali, she directed him to bring coffee and pipes, and when he had left\nthe room to execute the orders of his young mistress she beckoned Albert\nto approach nearer to her. Monte Cristo and Morcerf drew their seats\ntowards a small table, on which were arranged music, drawings, and vases\nof flowers. Ali then entered bringing coffee and chibouques; as to M.\nBaptistin, this portion of the building was interdicted to him. Albert\nrefused the pipe which the Nubian offered him. \"Oh, take it--take it,\"\nsaid the count; \"Haidee is almost as civilized as a Parisian; the smell\nof an Havana is disagreeable to her, but the tobacco of the East is a\nmost delicious perfume, you know.\"\n\nAli left the room. The cups of coffee were all prepared, with the\naddition of sugar, which had been brought for Albert. Monte Cristo and\nHaidee took the beverage in the original Arabian manner, that is to\nsay, without sugar. Haidee took the porcelain cup in her little slender\nfingers and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness\nof a child when eating or drinking something which it likes. At this\nmoment two women entered, bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet,\nwhich they placed on two small tables appropriated to that purpose.\n\"My dear host, and you, signora,\" said Albert, in Italian, \"excuse my\napparent stupidity. I am quite bewildered, and it is natural that it\nshould be so. Here I am in the heart of Paris; but a moment ago I heard\nthe rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the\nlemonade-sellers, and now I feel as if I were suddenly transported to\nthe East; not such as I have seen it, but such as my dreams have painted\nit. Oh, signora, if I could but speak Greek, your conversation, added\nto the fairy-scene which surrounds me, would furnish an evening of such\ndelight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget.\"\n\n\"I speak sufficient Italian to enable me to converse with you, sir,\"\nsaid Haidee quietly; \"and if you like what is Eastern, I will do my best\nto secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here.\"\n\n\"On what subject shall I converse with her?\" said Albert, in a low tone\nto Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Just what you please; you may speak of her country and of her youthful\nreminiscences, or if you like it better you can talk of Rome, Naples, or\nFlorence.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Albert, \"it is of no use to be in the company of a Greek if\none converses just in the same style as with a Parisian; let me speak to\nher of the East.\"\n\n\"Do so then, for of all themes which you could choose that will be the\nmost agreeable to her taste.\" Albert turned towards Haidee. \"At what age\ndid you leave Greece, signora?\" asked he.\n\n\"I left it when I was but five years old,\" replied Haidee.\n\n\"And have you any recollection of your country?\"\n\n\"When I shut my eyes and think, I seem to see it all again. The mind can\nsee as well as the body. The body forgets sometimes--but the mind never\nforgets.\"\n\n\"And how far back into the past do your recollections extend?\"\n\n\"I could scarcely walk when my mother, who was called Vasiliki, which\nmeans royal,\" said the young girl, tossing her head proudly, \"took me by\nthe hand, and after putting in our purse all the money we possessed, we\nwent out, both covered with veils, to solicit alms for the prisoners,\nsaying, 'He who giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord.' Then when our\npurse was full we returned to the palace, and without saying a word to\nmy father, we sent it to the convent, where it was divided amongst the\nprisoners.\"\n\n\"And how old were you at that time?\"\n\n\"I was three years old,\" said Haidee.\n\n\"Then you remember everything that went on about you from the time when\nyou were three years old?\" said Albert.\n\n\"Everything.\"\n\n\"Count,\" said Albert, in a low tone to Monte Cristo, \"do allow\nthe signora to tell me something of her history. You prohibited my\nmentioning my father's name to her, but perhaps she will allude to him\nof her own accord in the course of the recital, and you have no idea\nhow delighted I should be to hear our name pronounced by such beautiful\nlips.\" Monte Cristo turned to Haidee, and with an expression of\ncountenance which commanded her to pay the most implicit attention to\nhis words, he said in Greek,--\"Tell us the fate of your father; but\nneither the name of the traitor nor the treason.\" Haidee sighed deeply,\nand a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful brow.\n\n\"What are you saying to her?\" said Morcerf in an undertone.\n\n\"I again reminded her that you were a friend, and that she need not\nconceal anything from you.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Albert, \"this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the prisoners\nwas your first remembrance; what is the next?\"\n\n\"Oh, then I remember as if it were but yesterday sitting under the shade\nof some sycamore-trees, on the borders of a lake, in the waters of which\nthe trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror. Under the oldest and\nthickest of these trees, reclining on cushions, sat my father; my mother\nwas at his feet, and I, childlike, amused myself by playing with his\nlong white beard which descended to his girdle, or with the diamond-hilt\nof the scimitar attached to his girdle. Then from time to time there\ncame to him an Albanian who said something to which I paid no attention,\nbut which he always answered in the same tone of voice, either 'Kill,'\nor 'Pardon.'\"\n\n\"It is very strange,\" said Albert, \"to hear such words proceed from the\nmouth of any one but an actress on the stage, and one needs constantly\nto be saying to one's self, 'This is no fiction, it is all reality,' in\norder to believe it. And how does France appear in your eyes, accustomed\nas they have been to gaze on such enchanted scenes?\"\n\n\"I think it is a fine country,\" said Haidee, \"but I see France as it\nreally is, because I look on it with the eyes of a woman; whereas my own\ncountry, which I can only judge of from the impression produced on my\nchildish mind, always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere, which is\nluminous or otherwise, according as my remembrances of it are sad or\njoyous.\"\n\n\"So young,\" said Albert, forgetting at the moment the Count's command\nthat he should ask no questions of the slave herself, \"is it possible\nthat you can have known what suffering is except by name?\"\n\nHaidee turned her eyes towards Monte Cristo, who, making at the same\ntime some imperceptible sign, murmured,--\"Go on.\"\n\n\"Nothing is ever so firmly impressed on the mind as the memory of our\nearly childhood, and with the exception of the two scenes I have just\ndescribed to you, all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest\nsadness.\"\n\n\"Speak, speak, signora,\" said Albert, \"I am listening with the most\nintense delight and interest to all you say.\"\n\nHaidee answered his remark with a melancholy smile. \"You wish me, then,\nto relate the history of my past sorrows?\" said she.\n\n\"I beg you to do so,\" replied Albert.\n\n\"Well, I was but four years old when one night I was suddenly awakened\nby my mother. We were in the palace of Yanina; she snatched me from\nthe cushions on which I was sleeping, and on opening my eyes I saw hers\nfilled with tears. She took me away without speaking. When I saw her\nweeping I began to cry too. 'Hush, child!' said she. At other times in\nspite of maternal endearments or threats, I had with a child's caprice\nbeen accustomed to indulge my feelings of sorrow or anger by crying as\nmuch as I felt inclined; but on this occasion there was an intonation\nof such extreme terror in my mother's voice when she enjoined me to\nsilence, that I ceased crying as soon as her command was given. She bore\nme rapidly away.\n\n\"I saw then that we were descending a large staircase; around us were\nall my mother's servants carrying trunks, bags, ornaments, jewels,\npurses of gold, with which they were hurrying away in the greatest\ndistraction.\n\n\"Behind the women came a guard of twenty men armed with long guns and\npistols, and dressed in the costume which the Greeks have assumed since\nthey have again become a nation. You may imagine there was something\nstartling and ominous,\" said Haidee, shaking her head and turning pale\nat the mere remembrance of the scene, \"in this long file of slaves and\nwomen only half-aroused from sleep, or at least so they appeared to\nme, who was myself scarcely awake. Here and there on the walls of\nthe staircase, were reflected gigantic shadows, which trembled in the\nflickering light of the pine-torches till they seemed to reach to the\nvaulted roof above.\n\n\"'Quick!' said a voice at the end of the gallery. This voice made every\none bow before it, resembling in its effect the wind passing over a\nfield of wheat, by its superior strength forcing every ear to yield\nobeisance. As for me, it made me tremble. This voice was that of my\nfather. He came last, clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his\nhand the carbine which your emperor presented him. He was leaning on\nthe shoulder of his favorite Selim, and he drove us all before him, as\na shepherd would his straggling flock. My father,\" said Haidee, raising\nher head, \"was that illustrious man known in Europe under the name of\nAli Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and before whom Turkey trembled.\"\n\nAlbert, without knowing why, started on hearing these words pronounced\nwith such a haughty and dignified accent; it appeared to him as if there\nwas something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression which\ngleamed from the brilliant eyes of Haidee at this moment; she appeared\nlike a Pythoness evoking a spectre, as she recalled to his mind the\nremembrance of the fearful death of this man, to the news of which all\nEurope had listened with horror. \"Soon,\" said Haidee, \"we halted on our\nmarch, and found ourselves on the borders of a lake. My mother pressed\nme to her throbbing heart, and at the distance of a few paces I saw my\nfather, who was glancing anxiously around. Four marble steps led down to\nthe water's edge, and below them was a boat floating on the tide.\n\n\"From where we stood I could see in the middle of the lake a large blank\nmass; it was the kiosk to which we were going. This kiosk appeared to me\nto be at a considerable distance, perhaps on account of the darkness\nof the night, which prevented any object from being more than partially\ndiscerned. We stepped into the boat. I remember well that the oars\nmade no noise whatever in striking the water, and when I leaned over to\nascertain the cause I saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our\nPalikares. [*] Besides the rowers, the boat contained only the women, my\nfather, mother, Selim, and myself. The Palikares had remained on the\nshore of the lake, ready to cover our retreat; they were kneeling on the\nlowest of the marble steps, and in that manner intended making a rampart\nof the three others, in case of pursuit. Our bark flew before the wind.\n'Why does the boat go so fast?' asked I of my mother.\n\n     * Greek militiamen in the war for independence.--Ed.\n\n\"'Silence, child! Hush, we are flying!' I did not understand. Why\nshould my father fly?--he, the all-powerful--he, before whom others were\naccustomed to fly--he, who had taken for his device, 'They hate me; then\nthey fear me!' It was, indeed, a flight which my father was trying\nto effect. I have been told since that the garrison of the castle of\nYanina, fatigued with long service\"--\n\nHere Haidee cast a significant glance at Monte Cristo, whose eyes\nhad been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her\nnarrative. The young girl then continued, speaking slowly, like a person\nwho is either inventing or suppressing some feature of the history which\nhe is relating. \"You were saying, signora,\" said Albert, who was paying\nthe most implicit attention to the recital, \"that the garrison of\nYanina, fatigued with long service\"--\n\n\"Had treated with the Serasker [*] Koorshid, who had been sent by the\nsultan to gain possession of the person of my father; it was then that\nAli Tepelini--after having sent to the sultan a French officer in whom\nhe reposed great confidence--resolved to retire to the asylum which he\nhad long before prepared for himself, and which he called kataphygion,\nor the refuge.\"\n\n\"And this officer,\" asked Albert, \"do you remember his name, signora?\"\nMonte Cristo exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl, which was\nquite unperceived by Albert. \"No,\" said she, \"I do not remember it just\nat this moment; but if it should occur to me presently, I will tell\nyou.\" Albert was on the point of pronouncing his father's name, when\nMonte Cristo gently held up his finger in token of reproach; the young\nman recollected his promise, and was silent.\n\n     * A Turkish pasha in command of the troops of a province.--\n     Ed.\n\n\"It was towards this kiosk that we were rowing. A ground-floor,\nornamented with arabesques, bathing its terraces in the water, and\nanother floor, looking on the lake, was all which was visible to the\neye. But beneath the ground-floor, stretching out into the island, was\na large subterranean cavern, to which my mother, myself, and the women\nwere conducted. In this place were together 60,000. pouches and 200\nbarrels; the pouches contained 25,000,000 of money in gold, and the\nbarrels were filled with 30,000. pounds of gunpowder.\n\n\"Near the barrels stood Selim, my father's favorite, whom I mentioned to\nyou just now. He stood watch day and night with a lance provided with\na lighted slowmatch in his hand, and he had orders to blow up\neverything--kiosk, guards, women, gold, and Ali Tepelini himself--at\nthe first signal given by my father. I remember well that the slaves,\nconvinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their lives,\npassed whole days and nights in praying, crying, and groaning. As for\nme, I can never forget the pale complexion and black eyes of the young\nsoldier, and whenever the angel of death summons me to another world,\nI am quite sure I shall recognize Selim. I cannot tell you how long we\nremained in this state; at that period I did not even know what time\nmeant. Sometimes, but very rarely, my father summoned me and my mother\nto the terrace of the palace; these were hours of recreation for me, as\nI never saw anything in the dismal cavern but the gloomy countenances of\nthe slaves and Selim's fiery lance. My father was endeavoring to pierce\nwith his eager looks the remotest verge of the horizon, examining\nattentively every black speck which appeared on the lake, while my\nmother, reclining by his side, rested her head on his shoulder, and I\nplayed at his feet, admiring everything I saw with that unsophisticated\ninnocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant\nin themselves, but which in its eyes are invested with the greatest\nimportance. The heights of Pindus towered above us; the castle of Yanina\nrose white and angular from the blue waters of the lake, and the immense\nmasses of black vegetation which, viewed in the distance, gave the idea\nof lichens clinging to the rocks, were in reality gigantic fir-trees and\nmyrtles.\n\n\"One morning my father sent for us; my mother had been crying all the\nnight, and was very wretched; we found the pasha calm, but paler than\nusual. 'Take courage, Vasiliki,' said he; 'to-day arrives the firman of\nthe master, and my fate will be decided. If my pardon be complete, we\nshall return triumphant to Yanina; if the news be inauspicious, we must\nfly this night.'--'But supposing our enemy should not allow us to do\nso?' said my mother. 'Oh, make yourself easy on that head,' said Ali,\nsmiling; 'Selim and his flaming lance will settle that matter. They\nwould be glad to see me dead, but they would not like themselves to die\nwith me.'\n\n\"My mother only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not\ncome from my father's heart. She prepared the iced water which he was in\nthe habit of constantly drinking,--for since his sojourn at the kiosk\nhe had been parched by the most violent fever,--after which she anointed\nhis white beard with perfumed oil, and lighted his chibouque, which he\nsometimes smoked for hours together, quietly watching the wreaths of\nvapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the\nsurrounding atmosphere. Presently he made such a sudden movement that I\nwas paralyzed with fear. Then, without taking his eyes from the object\nwhich had first attracted his attention, he asked for his telescope.\nMy mother gave it him, and as she did so, looked whiter than the\nmarble against which she leaned. I saw my father's hand tremble. 'A\nboat!--two!--three!' murmured my, father;--'four!' He then arose,\nseizing his arms and priming his pistols. 'Vasiliki,' said he to my\nmother, trembling perceptibly, 'the instant approaches which will decide\neverything. In the space of half an hour we shall know the emperor's\nanswer. Go into the cavern with Haidee.'--'I will not quit you,' said\nVasiliki; 'if you die, my lord, I will die with you.'--'Go to Selim!'\ncried my father. 'Adieu, my lord,' murmured my mother, determining\nquietly to await the approach of death. 'Take away Vasiliki!' said my\nfather to his Palikares.\n\n\"As for me, I had been forgotten in the general confusion; I ran toward\nAli Tepelini; he saw me hold out my arms to him, and he stooped down and\npressed my forehead with his lips. Oh, how distinctly I remember that\nkiss!--it was the last he ever gave me, and I feel as if it were still\nwarm on my forehead. On descending, we saw through the lattice-work\nseveral boats which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view.\nAt first they appeared like black specks, and now they looked like birds\nskimming the surface of the waves. During this time, in the kiosk at my\nfather's feet, were seated twenty Palikares, concealed from view by an\nangle of the wall and watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats.\nThey were armed with their long guns inlaid with mother-of-pearl and\nsilver, and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the\nfloor. My father looked at his watch, and paced up and down with a\ncountenance expressive of the greatest anguish. This was the scene which\npresented itself to my view as I quitted my father after that last kiss.\nMy mother and I traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern.\nSelim was still at his post, and smiled sadly on us as we entered. We\nfetched our cushions from the other end of the cavern, and sat down by\nSelim. In great dangers the devoted ones cling to each other; and, young\nas I was, I quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over\nour heads.\"\n\nAlbert had often heard--not from his father, for he never spoke on the\nsubject, but from strangers--the description of the last moments of the\nvizier of Yanina; he had read different accounts of his death, but the\nstory seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the voice and expression of\nthe young girl, and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy expression\nof her countenance at once charmed and horrified him. As to Haidee,\nthese terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a\nmoment, for she ceased speaking, her head leaning on her hand like a\nbeautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm; and her eyes\ngazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the\ngreen summit of the Pindus and the blue waters of the lake of Yanina,\nwhich, like a magic mirror, seemed to reflect the sombre picture\nwhich she sketched. Monte Cristo looked at her with an indescribable\nexpression of interest and pity.\n\n\"Go on,\" said the count in the Romaic language.\n\nHaidee looked up abruptly, as if the sonorous tones of Monte Cristo's\nvoice had awakened her from a dream; and she resumed her narrative.\n\"It was about four o'clock in the afternoon, and although the day was\nbrilliant out-of-doors, we were enveloped in the gloomy darkness of the\ncavern. One single, solitary light was burning there, and it appeared\nlike a star set in a heaven of blackness; it was Selim's flaming lance.\nMy mother was a Christian, and she prayed. Selim repeated from time to\ntime the sacred words: 'God is great!' However, my mother had still\nsome hope. As she was coming down, she thought she recognized the French\nofficer who had been sent to Constantinople, and in whom my father\nplaced so much confidence; for he knew that all the soldiers of the\nFrench emperor were naturally noble and generous. She advanced some\nsteps towards the staircase, and listened. 'They are approaching,' said\nshe; 'perhaps they bring us peace and liberty!'--'What do you fear,\nVasiliki?' said Selim, in a voice at once so gentle and yet so proud.\n'If they do not bring us peace, we will give them war; if they do not\nbring life, we will give them death.' And he renewed the flame of his\nlance with a gesture which made one think of Dionysus of Crete. [*] But\nI, being only a little child, was terrified by this undaunted courage,\nwhich appeared to me both ferocious and senseless, and I recoiled with\nhorror from the idea of the frightful death amidst fire and flames which\nprobably awaited us.\n\n     * The god of fruitfulness in Grecian mythology. In Crete he\n     was supposed to be slain in winter with the decay of\n     vegetation and to revive in the spring. Haidee's learned\n     reference is to the behavior of an actor in the Dionysian\n     festivals.--Ed.\n\n\"My mother experienced the same sensations, for I felt her tremble.\n'Mamma, mamma,' said I, 'are we really to be killed?' And at the\nsound of my voice the slaves redoubled their cries and prayers and\nlamentations. 'My child,' said Vasiliki, 'may God preserve you from ever\nwishing for that death which to-day you so much dread!' Then, whispering\nto Selim, she asked what were her master's orders. 'If he send me\nhis poniard, it will signify that the emperor's intentions are not\nfavorable, and I am to set fire to the powder; if, on the contrary, he\nsend me his ring, it will be a sign that the emperor pardons him, and\nI am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched.'--'My\nfriend,' said my mother, 'when your master's orders arrive, if it is the\nponiard which he sends, instead of despatching us by that horrible death\nwhich we both so much dread, you will mercifully kill us with this same\nponiard, will you not?'--'Yes, Vasiliki,' replied Selim tranquilly.\n\n\"Suddenly we heard loud cries; and, listening, discerned that they\nwere cries of joy. The name of the French officer who had been sent\nto Constantinople resounded on all sides amongst our Palikares; it\nwas evident that he brought the answer of the emperor, and that it was\nfavorable.\"\n\n\"And do you not remember the Frenchman's name?\" said Morcerf, quite\nready to aid the memory of the narrator. Monte Cristo made a sign to him\nto be silent.\n\n\"I do not recollect it,\" said Haidee.\n\n\"The noise increased; steps were heard approaching nearer and nearer:\nthey were descending the steps leading to the cavern. Selim made ready\nhis lance. Soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance\nof the cave, formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which\nhad found their way into this gloomy retreat. 'Who are you?' cried\nSelim. 'But whoever you may be, I charge you not to advance another\nstep.'--'Long live the emperor!' said the figure. 'He grants a full\npardon to the Vizier Ali, and not only gives him his life, but restores\nto him his fortune and his possessions.' My mother uttered a cry of joy,\nand clasped me to her bosom. 'Stop,' said Selim, seeing that she was\nabout to go out; 'you see I have not yet received the ring,'--'True,'\nsaid my mother. And she fell on her knees, at the same time holding me\nup towards heaven, as if she desired, while praying to God in my behalf,\nto raise me actually to his presence.\"\n\nAnd for the second time Haidee stopped, overcome by such violent emotion\nthat the perspiration stood upon her pale brow, and her stifled voice\nseemed hardly able to find utterance, so parched and dry were her throat\nand lips. Monte Cristo poured a little iced water into a glass, and\npresented it to her, saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of\ncommand,--\"Courage.\"\n\nHaidee dried her eyes, and continued: \"By this time our eyes, habituated\nto the darkness, had recognized the messenger of the pasha,--it was\na friend. Selim had also recognized him, but the brave young man only\nacknowledged one duty, which was to obey. 'In whose name do you come?'\nsaid he to him. 'I come in the name of our master, Ali Tepelini.'--'If\nyou come from Ali himself,' said Selim, 'you know what you were charged\nto remit to me?'--'Yes,' said the messenger, 'and I bring you his ring.'\nAt these words he raised his hand above his head, to show the token;\nbut it was too far off, and there was not light enough to enable Selim,\nwhere he was standing, to distinguish and recognize the object presented\nto his view. 'I do not see what you have in your hand,' said Selim.\n'Approach then,' said the messenger, 'or I will come nearer to you, if\nyou prefer it.'--'I will agree to neither one nor the other,' replied\nthe young soldier; 'place the object which I desire to see in the ray of\nlight which shines there, and retire while I examine it.'--'Be it so,'\nsaid the envoy; and he retired, after having first deposited the token\nagreed on in the place pointed out to him by Selim.\n\n\"Oh, how our hearts palpitated; for it did, indeed, seem to be a ring\nwhich was placed there. But was it my father's ring? that was the\nquestion. Selim, still holding in his hand the lighted match, walked\ntowards the opening in the cavern, and, aided by the faint light which\nstreamed in through the mouth of the cave, picked up the token.\n\n\"'It is well,' said he, kissing it; 'it is my master's ring!' And\nthrowing the match on the ground, he trampled on it and extinguished it.\nThe messenger uttered a cry of joy and clapped his hands. At this signal\nfour soldiers of the Serasker Koorshid suddenly appeared, and Selim\nfell, pierced by five blows. Each man had stabbed him separately, and,\nintoxicated by their crime, though still pale with fear, they sought all\nover the cavern to discover if there was any fear of fire, after which\nthey amused themselves by rolling on the bags of gold. At this moment\nmy mother seized me in her arms, and hurrying noiselessly along numerous\nturnings and windings known only to ourselves, she arrived at a private\nstaircase of the kiosk, where was a scene of frightful tumult and\nconfusion. The lower rooms were entirely filled with Koorshid's troops;\nthat is to say, with our enemies. Just as my mother was on the point of\npushing open a small door, we heard the voice of the pasha sounding in\na loud and threatening tone. My mother applied her eye to the crack\nbetween the boards; I luckily found a small opening which afforded me a\nview of the apartment and what was passing within. 'What do you want?'\nsaid my father to some people who were holding a paper inscribed with\ncharacters of gold. 'What we want,' replied one, 'is to communicate to\nyou the will of his highness. Do you see this firman?'--'I do,' said my\nfather. 'Well, read it; he demands your head.'\n\n\"My father answered with a loud laugh, which was more frightful than\neven threats would have been, and he had not ceased when two reports of\na pistol were heard; he had fired them himself, and had killed two men.\nThe Palikares, who were prostrated at my father's feet, now sprang up\nand fired, and the room was filled with fire and smoke. At the same\ninstant the firing began on the other side, and the balls penetrated the\nboards all round us. Oh, how noble did the grand vizier my father look\nat that moment, in the midst of the flying bullets, his scimitar in his\nhand, and his face blackened with the powder of his enemies! and how he\nterrified them, even then, and made them fly before him! 'Selim, Selim!'\ncried he, 'guardian of the fire, do your duty!'--'Selim is dead,'\nreplied a voice which seemed to come from the depths of the earth, 'and\nyou are lost, Ali!' At the same moment an explosion was heard, and the\nflooring of the room in which my father was sitting was suddenly torn up\nand shivered to atoms--the troops were firing from underneath. Three or\nfour Palikares fell with their bodies literally ploughed with wounds.\n\n\"My father howled aloud, plunged his fingers into the holes which the\nballs had made, and tore up one of the planks entire. But immediately\nthrough this opening twenty more shots were fired, and the flame,\nrushing up like fire from the crater of a volcano, soon reached the\ntapestry, which it quickly devoured. In the midst of all this frightful\ntumult and these terrific cries, two reports, fearfully distinct,\nfollowed by two shrieks more heartrending than all, froze me with\nterror. These two shots had mortally wounded my father, and it was he\nwho had given utterance to these frightful cries. However, he remained\nstanding, clinging to a window. My mother tried to force the door, that\nshe might go and die with him, but it was fastened on the inside. All\naround him were lying the Palikares, writhing in convulsive agonies,\nwhile two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to\nescape by springing from the windows. At this crisis the whole flooring\nsuddenly gave way, my father fell on one knee, and at the same moment\ntwenty hands were thrust forth, armed with sabres, pistols, and\nponiards--twenty blows were instantaneously directed against one man,\nand my father disappeared in a whirlwind of fire and smoke kindled by\nthese demons, and which seemed like hell itself opening beneath his\nfeet. I felt myself fall to the ground, my mother had fainted.\"\n\nHaidee's arms fell by her side, and she uttered a deep groan, at the\nsame time looking towards the count as if to ask if he were satisfied\nwith her obedience to his commands. Monte Cristo arose and approached\nher, took her hand, and said to her in Romaic, \"Calm yourself, my dear\nchild, and take courage in remembering that there is a God who will\npunish traitors.\"\n\n\"It is a frightful story, count,\" said Albert, terrified at the paleness\nof Haidee's countenance, \"and I reproach myself now for having been so\ncruel and thoughtless in my request.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is nothing,\" said Monte Cristo. Then, patting the young girl on\nthe head, he continued, \"Haidee is very courageous, and she sometimes\neven finds consolation in the recital of her misfortunes.\"\n\n\"Because, my lord,\" said Haidee eagerly, \"my miseries recall to me the\nremembrance of your goodness.\"\n\nAlbert looked at her with curiosity, for she had not yet related what he\nmost desired to know,--how she had become the slave of the count. Haidee\nsaw at a glance the same expression pervading the countenances of her\ntwo auditors; she exclaimed, 'When my mother recovered her senses we\nwere before the serasker. 'Kill,' said she, 'but spare the honor of the\nwidow of Ali.'--'It is not to me to whom you must address yourself,'\nsaid Koorshid.\n\n\"'To whom, then?'--'To your new master.'\n\n\"'Who and where is he?'--'He is here.'\n\n\"And Koorshid pointed out one who had more than any contributed to the\ndeath of my father,\" said Haidee, in a tone of chastened anger. \"Then,\"\nsaid Albert, \"you became the property of this man?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Haidee, \"he did not dare to keep us, so we were sold to\nsome slave-merchants who were going to Constantinople. We traversed\nGreece, and arrived half dead at the imperial gates. They were\nsurrounded by a crowd of people, who opened a way for us to pass,\nwhen suddenly my mother, having looked closely at an object which was\nattracting their attention, uttered a piercing cry and fell to the\nground, pointing as she did so to a head which was placed over the\ngates, and beneath which were inscribed these words:\n\n\"'This is the head of Ali Tepelini Pasha of Yanina.' I cried bitterly,\nand tried to raise my mother from the earth, but she was dead! I was\ntaken to the slave-market, and was purchased by a rich Armenian. He\ncaused me to be instructed, gave me masters, and when I was thirteen\nyears of age he sold me to the Sultan Mahmood.\"\n\n\"Of whom I bought her,\" said Monte Cristo, \"as I told you, Albert, with\nthe emerald which formed a match to the one I had made into a box for\nthe purpose of holding my hashish pills.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are good, you are great, my lord!\" said Haidee, kissing the\ncount's hand, \"and I am very fortunate in belonging to such a master!\"\nAlbert remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard.\n\"Come, finish your cup of coffee,\" said Monte Cristo; \"the history is\nended.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 78. We hear From Yanina.\n\nIf Valentine could have seen the trembling step and agitated countenance\nof Franz when he quitted the chamber of M. Noirtier, even she would have\nbeen constrained to pity him. Villefort had only just given utterance\nto a few incoherent sentences, and then retired to his study, where he\nreceived about two hours afterwards the following letter:--\n\n\"After all the disclosures which were made this morning, M. Noirtier de\nVillefort must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed\nbetween his family and that of M. Franz d'Epinay. M. d'Epinay must say\nthat he is shocked and astonished that M. de Villefort, who appeared to\nbe aware of all the circumstances detailed this morning, should not have\nanticipated him in this announcement.\"\n\nNo one who had seen the magistrate at this moment, so thoroughly\nunnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of circumstances, would\nhave supposed for an instant that he had anticipated the annoyance;\nalthough it certainly never had occurred to him that his father would\ncarry candor, or rather rudeness, so far as to relate such a history.\nAnd in justice to Villefort, it must be understood that M. Noirtier,\nwho never cared for the opinion of his son on any subject, had always\nomitted to explain the affair to Villefort, so that he had all his life\nentertained the belief that General de Quesnel, or the Baron d'Epinay,\nas he was alternately styled, according as the speaker wished to\nidentify him by his own family name, or by the title which had been\nconferred on him, fell the victim of assassination, and not that he was\nkilled fairly in a duel. This harsh letter, coming as it did from a man\ngenerally so polite and respectful, struck a mortal blow at the pride\nof Villefort. Hardly had he read the letter, when his wife entered. The\nsudden departure of Franz, after being summoned by M. Noirtier, had so\nmuch astonished every one, that the position of Madame de Villefort,\nleft alone with the notary and the witnesses, became every moment more\nembarrassing. Determined to bear it no longer, she arose and left the\nroom; saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his\nsudden disappearance.\n\nM. de Villefort's communications on the subject were very limited and\nconcise; he told her, in fact, that an explanation had taken place\nbetween M. Noirtier, M. d'Epinay, and himself, and that the marriage\nof Valentine and Franz would consequently be broken off. This was\nan awkward and unpleasant thing to have to report to those who were\nawaiting her return in the chamber of her father-in-law. She\ntherefore contented herself with saying that M. Noirtier having at the\ncommencement of the discussion been attacked by a sort of apoplectic\nfit, the affair would necessarily be deferred for some days longer. This\nnews, false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two\nsimilar misfortunes which had so recently occurred, evidently astonished\nthe auditors, and they retired without a word. During this time\nValentine, at once terrified and happy, after having embraced and\nthanked the feeble old man for thus breaking with a single blow the\nchain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable, asked\nleave to retire to her own room, in order to recover her composure.\nNoirtier looked the permission which she solicited. But instead of going\nto her own room, Valentine, having once gained her liberty, entered the\ngallery, and, opening a small door at the end of it, found herself at\nonce in the garden.\n\nIn the midst of all the strange events which had crowded one on the\nother, an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken possession of\nValentine's mind. She expected every moment that she should see Morrel\nappear, pale and trembling, to forbid the signing of the contract, like\nthe Laird of Ravenswood in \"The Bride of Lammermoor.\" It was high time\nfor her to make her appearance at the gate, for Maximilian had long\nawaited her coming. He had half guessed what was going on when he saw\nFranz quit the cemetery with M. de Villefort. He followed M. d'Epinay,\nsaw him enter, afterwards go out, and then re-enter with Albert and\nChateau-Renaud. He had no longer any doubts as to the nature of the\nconference; he therefore quickly went to the gate in the clover-patch,\nprepared to hear the result of the proceedings, and very certain that\nValentine would hasten to him the first moment she should be set at\nliberty. He was not mistaken; peering through the crevices of the wooden\npartition, he soon discovered the young girl, who cast aside all her\nusual precautions and walked at once to the barrier. The first glance\nwhich Maximilian directed towards her entirely reassured him, and the\nfirst words she spoke made his heart bound with delight.\n\n\"We are saved!\" said Valentine. \"Saved?\" repeated Morrel, not being able\nto conceive such intense happiness; \"by whom?\"\n\n\"By my grandfather. Oh, Morrel, pray love him for all his goodness to\nus!\" Morrel swore to love him with all his soul; and at that moment he\ncould safely promise to do so, for he felt as though it were not enough\nto love him merely as a friend or even as a father. \"But tell me,\nValentine, how has it all been effected? What strange means has he used\nto compass this blessed end?\"\n\nValentine was on the point of relating all that had passed, but she\nsuddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible secret\nwhich concerned others as well as her grandfather, and she said, \"At\nsome future time I will tell you all about it.\"\n\n\"But when will that be?\"\n\n\"When I am your wife.\"\n\nThe conversation had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to Morrel,\nthat he was ready to accede to anything that Valentine thought fit to\npropose, and he likewise felt that a piece of intelligence such as he\njust heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for one day.\nHowever, he would not leave without the promise of seeing Valentine\nagain the next night. Valentine promised all that Morrel required of\nher, and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she\nshould marry Maximilian than it was an hour ago to assure herself that\nshe should not marry Franz.\n\nDuring the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed, Madame\nde Villefort had gone to visit M. Noirtier. The old man looked at her\nwith that stern and forbidding expression with which he was accustomed\nto receive her.\n\n\"Sir,\" said she, \"it is superfluous for me to tell you that Valentine's\nmarriage is broken off, since it was here that the affair was\nconcluded.\" Noirtier's countenance remained immovable. \"But one thing\nI can tell you, of which I do not think you are aware; that is, that\nI have always been opposed to this marriage, and that the contract\nwas entered into entirely without my consent or approbation.\" Noirtier\nregarded his daughter-in-law with the look of a man desiring an\nexplanation. \"Now that this marriage, which I know you so much disliked,\nis done away with, I come to you on an errand which neither M. de\nVillefort nor Valentine could consistently undertake.\" Noirtier's\neyes demanded the nature of her mission. \"I come to entreat you, sir,\"\ncontinued Madame de Villefort, \"as the only one who has the right of\ndoing so, inasmuch as I am the only one who will receive no personal\nbenefit from the transaction,--I come to entreat you to restore, not\nyour love, for that she has always possessed, but to restore your\nfortune to your granddaughter.\"\n\nThere was a doubtful expression in Noirtier's eyes; he was evidently\ntrying to discover the motive of this proceeding, and he could not\nsucceed in doing so. \"May I hope, sir,\" said Madame de Villefort, \"that\nyour intentions accord with my request?\" Noirtier made a sign that they\ndid. \"In that case, sir,\" rejoined Madame de Villefort, \"I will leave\nyou overwhelmed with gratitude and happiness at your prompt acquiescence\nto my wishes.\" She then bowed to M. Noirtier and retired.\n\nThe next day M. Noirtier sent for the notary; the first will was torn\nup and a second made, in which he left the whole of his fortune to\nValentine, on condition that she should never be separated from him. It\nwas then generally reported that Mademoiselle de Villefort, the heiress\nof the marquis and marchioness of Saint-Meran, had regained the\ngood graces of her grandfather, and that she would ultimately be in\npossession of an income of 300,000 livres.\n\nWhile all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the\nmarriage-contract were being carried on at the house of M. de Villefort,\nMonte Cristo had paid his visit to the Count of Morcerf, who, in order\nto lose no time in responding to M. Danglars' wishes, and at the same\ntime to pay all due deference to his position in society, donned his\nuniform of lieutenant-general, which he ornamented with all his crosses,\nand thus attired, ordered his finest horses and drove to the Rue de la\nChausse d'Antin.\n\nDanglars was balancing his monthly accounts, and it was perhaps not the\nmost favorable moment for finding him in his best humor. At the first\nsight of his old friend, Danglars assumed his majestic air, and settled\nhimself in his easy-chair. Morcerf, usually so stiff and formal,\naccosted the banker in an affable and smiling manner, and, feeling sure\nthat the overture he was about to make would be well received, he did not\nconsider it necessary to adopt any manoeuvres in order to gain his end,\nbut went at once straight to the point.\n\n\"Well, baron,\" said he, \"here I am at last; some time has elapsed since\nour plans were formed, and they are not yet executed.\" Morcerf paused at\nthese words, quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which\nhad gathered on the brow of Danglars, and which he attributed to his\nsilence; but, on the contrary, to his great surprise, it grew darker and\ndarker. \"To what do you allude, monsieur?\" said Danglars; as if he were\ntrying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the general's words.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Morcerf, \"I see you are a stickler for forms, my dear sir,\nand you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted.\nMa foi, I beg your pardon, but as I have but one son, and it is the\nfirst time I have ever thought of marrying him, I am still serving\nmy apprenticeship, you know; come, I will reform.\" And Morcerf with a\nforced smile arose, and, making a low bow to M. Danglars, said: \"Baron,\nI have the honor of asking of you the hand of Mademoiselle Eugenie\nDanglars for my son, the Vicomte Albert de Morcerf.\"\n\nBut Danglars, instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner\nwhich Morcerf had expected, knit his brow, and without inviting the\ncount, who was still standing, to take a seat, he said: \"Monsieur, it\nwill be necessary to reflect before I give you an answer.\"\n\n\"To reflect?\" said Morcerf, more and more astonished; \"have you not had\nenough time for reflection during the eight years which have elapsed\nsince this marriage was first discussed between us?\"\n\n\"Count,\" said the banker, \"things are constantly occurring in the world\nto induce us to lay aside our most established opinions, or at\nall events to cause us to remodel them according to the change of\ncircumstances, which may have placed affairs in a totally different\nlight to that in which we at first viewed them.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you, baron,\" said Morcerf.\n\n\"What I mean to say is this, sir,--that during the last fortnight\nunforeseen circumstances have occurred\"--\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said Morcerf, \"but is it a play we are acting?\"\n\n\"A play?\"\n\n\"Yes, for it is like one; pray let us come more to the point, and\nendeavor thoroughly to understand each other.\"\n\n\"That is quite my desire.\"\n\n\"You have seen M. de Monte Cristo have you not?\"\n\n\"I see him very often,\" said Danglars, drawing himself up; \"he is a\nparticular friend of mine.\"\n\n\"Well, in one of your late conversations with him, you said that I\nappeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this marriage, did\nyou not?\"\n\n\"I did say so.\"\n\n\"Well, here I am, proving at once that I am really neither the one nor\nthe other, by entreating you to keep your promise on that score.\"\n\nDanglars did not answer. \"Have you so soon changed your mind,\" added\nMorcerf, \"or have you only provoked my request that you may have the\npleasure of seeing me humbled?\" Danglars, seeing that if he continued\nthe conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it, the whole\nthing might turn out to his own disadvantage, turned to Morcerf, and\nsaid: \"Count, you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve, and I\nassure you it costs me much to act in such a manner towards you; but,\nbelieve me when I say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful\ntask upon me.\"\n\n\"These are all so many empty words, my dear sir,\" said Morcerf: \"they\nmight satisfy a new acquaintance, but the Comte de Morcerf does not rank\nin that list; and when a man like him comes to another, recalls to him\nhis plighted word, and this man fails to redeem the pledge, he has at\nleast a right to exact from him a good reason for so doing.\" Danglars\nwas a coward, but did not wish to appear so; he was piqued at the tone\nwhich Morcerf had just assumed. \"I am not without a good reason for my\nconduct,\" replied the banker.\n\n\"What do you mean to say?\"\n\n\"I mean to say that I have a good reason, but that it is difficult to\nexplain.\"\n\n\"You must be aware, at all events, that it is impossible for me to\nunderstand motives before they are explained to me; but one thing at\nleast is clear, which is, that you decline allying yourself with my\nfamily.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Danglars; \"I merely suspend my decision, that is all.\"\n\n\"And do you really flatter yourself that I shall yield to all your\ncaprices, and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received\ninto your good graces?\"\n\n\"Then, count, if you will not wait, we must look upon these projects\nas if they had never been entertained.\" The count bit his lips till the\nblood almost started, to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud\nand irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain; understanding,\nhowever, that in the present state of things the laugh would decidedly\nbe against him, he turned from the door, towards which he had been\ndirecting his steps, and again confronted the banker. A cloud settled\non his brow, evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness, instead of the\nexpression of offended pride which had lately reigned there. \"My dear\nDanglars,\" said Morcerf, \"we have been acquainted for many years, and\nconsequently we ought to make some allowance for each other's failings.\nYou owe me an explanation, and really it is but fair that I should know\nwhat circumstance has occurred to deprive my son of your favor.\"\n\n\"It is from no personal ill-feeling towards the viscount, that is all I\ncan say, sir,\" replied Danglars, who resumed his insolent manner as soon\nas he perceived that Morcerf was a little softened and calmed down. \"And\ntowards whom do you bear this personal ill-feeling, then?\" said Morcerf,\nturning pale with anger. The expression of the count's face had not\nremained unperceived by the banker; he fixed on him a look of greater\nassurance than before, and said: \"You may, perhaps, be better satisfied\nthat I should not go farther into particulars.\"\n\nA tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the count, and\nmaking a violent effort over himself, he said: \"I have a right to\ninsist on your giving me an explanation. Is it Madame de Morcerf who\nhas displeased you? Is it my fortune which you find insufficient? Is it\nbecause my opinions differ from yours?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the kind, sir,\" replied Danglars: \"if such had been the\ncase, I only should have been to blame, inasmuch as I was aware of all\nthese things when I made the engagement. No, do not seek any longer to\ndiscover the reason. I really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of\nyour undergoing such severe self-examination; let us drop the subject,\nand adopt the middle course of delay, which implies neither a rupture\nnor an engagement. Ma foi, there is no hurry. My daughter is only\nseventeen years old, and your son twenty-one. While we wait, time will\nbe progressing, events will succeed each other; things which in the\nevening look dark and obscure, appear but too clearly in the light of\nmorning, and sometimes the utterance of one word, or the lapse of a\nsingle day, will reveal the most cruel calumnies.\"\n\n\"Calumnies, did you say, sir?\" cried Morcerf, turning livid with rage.\n\"Does any one dare to slander me?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, I told you that I considered it best to avoid all\nexplanation.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, I am patiently to submit to your refusal?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, although I assure you the refusal is as painful for me to\ngive as it is for you to receive, for I had reckoned on the honor\nof your alliance, and the breaking off of a marriage contract always\ninjures the lady more than the gentleman.\"\n\n\"Enough, sir,\" said Morcerf, \"we will speak no more on the subject.\" And\nclutching his gloves in anger, he left the apartment. Danglars observed\nthat during the whole conversation Morcerf had never once dared to\nask if it was on his own account that Danglars recalled his word.\nThat evening he had a long conference with several friends; and M.\nCavalcanti, who had remained in the drawing-room with the ladies, was\nthe last to leave the banker's house.\n\nThe next morning, as soon as he awoke, Danglars asked for the\nnewspapers; they were brought to him; he laid aside three or four, and\nat last fixed on the Impartial, the paper of which Beauchamp was the\nchief editor. He hastily tore off the cover, opened the journal with\nnervous precipitation, passed contemptuously over the Paris jottings,\nand arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence, stopped with a malicious\nsmile, at a paragraph headed \"We hear from Yanina.\" \"Very good,\"\nobserved Danglars, after having read the paragraph; \"here is a little\narticle on Colonel Fernand, which, if I am not mistaken, would render\nthe explanation which the Comte de Morcerf required of me perfectly\nunnecessary.\"\n\nAt the same moment, that is, at nine o'clock in the morning, Albert de\nMorcerf, dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin, might have\nbeen seen walking with a quick and agitated step in the direction of\nMonte Cristo's house in the Champs Elysees. When he presented himself at\nthe gate the porter informed him that the Count had gone out about half\nan hour previously. \"Did he take Baptistin with him?\"\n\n\"No, my lord.\"\n\n\"Call him, then; I wish to speak to him.\" The concierge went to seek the\nvalet de chambre, and returned with him in an instant.\n\n\"My good friend,\" said Albert, \"I beg pardon for my intrusion, but I\nwas anxious to know from your own mouth if your master was really out or\nnot.\"\n\n\"He is really out, sir,\" replied Baptistin.\n\n\"Out, even to me?\"\n\n\"I know how happy my master always is to receive the vicomte,\" said\nBaptistin; \"and I should therefore never think of including him in any\ngeneral order.\"\n\n\"You are right; and now I wish to see him on an affair of great\nimportance. Do you think it will be long before he comes in?\"\n\n\"No, I think not, for he ordered his breakfast at ten o'clock.\"\n\n\"Well, I will go and take a turn in the Champs Elysees, and at ten\no'clock I will return here; meanwhile, if the count should come in, will\nyou beg him not to go out again without seeing me?\"\n\n\"You may depend on my doing so, sir,\" said Baptistin.\n\nAlbert left the cab in which he had come at the count's door, intending\nto take a turn on foot. As he was passing the Allee des Veuves, he\nthought he saw the count's horses standing at Gosset's shooting-gallery;\nhe approached, and soon recognized the coachman. \"Is the count shooting\nin the gallery?\" said Morcerf.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the coachman. While he was speaking, Albert had\nheard the report of two or three pistol-shots. He entered, and on his\nway met the waiter. \"Excuse me, my lord,\" said the lad; \"but will you\nhave the kindness to wait a moment?\"\n\n\"What for, Philip?\" asked Albert, who, being a constant visitor there,\ndid not understand this opposition to his entrance.\n\n\"Because the person who is now in the gallery prefers being alone, and\nnever practices in the presence of any one.\"\n\n\"Not even before you, Philip? Then who loads his pistol?\"\n\n\"His servant.\"\n\n\"A Nubian?\"\n\n\"A negro.\"\n\n\"It is he, then.\"\n\n\"Do you know this gentleman?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I am come to look for him; he is a friend of mine.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is quite another thing, then. I will go immediately and inform\nhim of your arrival.\" And Philip, urged by his own curiosity, entered\nthe gallery; a second afterwards, Monte Cristo appeared on the\nthreshold. \"I ask your pardon, my dear count,\" said Albert, \"for\nfollowing you here, and I must first tell you that it was not the\nfault of your servants that I did so; I alone am to blame for the\nindiscretion. I went to your house, and they told me you were out, but\nthat they expected you home at ten o'clock to breakfast. I was walking\nabout in order to pass away the time till ten o'clock, when I caught\nsight of your carriage and horses.\"\n\n\"What you have just said induces me to hope that you intend breakfasting\nwith me.\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I am thinking of other things besides breakfast\njust now; perhaps we may take that meal at a later hour and in worse\ncompany.\"\n\n\"What on earth are you talking of?\"\n\n\"I am to fight to-day.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"I am going to fight\"--\n\n\"Yes, I understand that, but what is the quarrel? People fight for all\nsorts of reasons, you know.\"\n\n\"I fight in the cause of honor.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is something serious.\"\n\n\"So serious, that I come to beg you to render me a service.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"To be my second.\"\n\n\"That is a serious matter, and we will not discuss it here; let us speak\nof nothing till we get home. Ali, bring me some water.\" The count turned\nup his sleeves, and passed into the little vestibule where the gentlemen\nwere accustomed to wash their hands after shooting. \"Come in, my lord,\"\nsaid Philip in a low tone, \"and I will show you something droll.\"\nMorcerf entered, and in place of the usual target, he saw some\nplaying-cards fixed against the wall. At a distance Albert thought it\nwas a complete suit, for he counted from the ace to the ten. \"Ah, ha,\"\nsaid Albert, \"I see you were preparing for a game of cards.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the count, \"I was making a suit.\"\n\n\"How?\" said Albert.\n\n\"Those are really aces and twos which you see, but my shots have turned\nthem into threes, fives, sevens, eights, nines, and tens.\" Albert\napproached. In fact, the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the\nexact places which the painted signs would otherwise have occupied, the\nlines and distances being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled\nwith pencil. \"Diable,\" said Morcerf.\n\n\"What would you have, my dear viscount?\" said Monte Cristo, wiping his\nhands on the towel which Ali had brought him; \"I must occupy my leisure\nmoments in some way or other. But come, I am waiting for you.\" Both men\nentered Monte Cristo's carriage, which in the course of a few minutes\ndeposited them safely at No. 30. Monte Cristo took Albert into his\nstudy, and pointing to a seat, placed another for himself. \"Now let us\ntalk the matter over quietly,\" said the count.\n\n\"You see I am perfectly composed,\" said Albert.\n\n\"With whom are you going to fight?\"\n\n\"With Beauchamp.\"\n\n\"One of your friends!\"\n\n\"Of course; it is always with friends that one fights.\"\n\n\"I suppose you have some cause of quarrel?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"What has he done to you?\"\n\n\"There appeared in his journal last night--but wait, and read for\nyourself.\" And Albert handed over the paper to the count, who read as\nfollows:--\n\n\"A correspondent at Yanina informs us of a fact of which until now we\nhad remained in ignorance. The castle which formed the protection of\nthe town was given up to the Turks by a French officer named Fernand,\nin whom the grand vizier, Ali Tepelini, had reposed the greatest\nconfidence.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Monte Cristo, \"what do you see in that to annoy you?\"\n\n\"What do I see in it?\"\n\n\"Yes; what does it signify to you if the castle of Yanina was given up\nby a French officer?\"\n\n\"It signifies to my father, the Count of Morcerf, whose Christian name\nis Fernand!\"\n\n\"Did your father serve under Ali Pasha?\"\n\n\"Yes; that is to say, he fought for the independence of the Greeks, and\nhence arises the calumny.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear viscount, do talk reason!\"\n\n\"I do not desire to do otherwise.\"\n\n\"Now, just tell me who the devil should know in France that the officer\nFernand and the Count of Morcerf are one and the same person? and who\ncares now about Yanina, which was taken as long ago as the year 1822 or\n1823?\"\n\n\"That just shows the meanness of this slander. They have allowed all\nthis time to elapse, and then all of a sudden rake up events which have\nbeen forgotten to furnish materials for scandal, in order to tarnish the\nlustre of our high position. I inherit my father's name, and I do not\nchoose that the shadow of disgrace should darken it. I am going to\nBeauchamp, in whose journal this paragraph appears, and I shall insist\non his retracting the assertion before two witnesses.\"\n\n\"Beauchamp will never retract.\"\n\n\"Then he must fight.\"\n\n\"No he will not, for he will tell you, what is very true, that perhaps\nthere were fifty officers in the Greek army bearing the same name.\"\n\n\"We will fight, nevertheless. I will efface that blot on my father's\ncharacter. My father, who was such a brave soldier, whose career was so\nbrilliant\"--\n\n\"Oh, well, he will add, 'We are warranted in believing that this\nFernand is not the illustrious Count of Morcerf, who also bears the same\nChristian name.'\"\n\n\"I am determined not to be content with anything short of an entire\nretractation.\"\n\n\"And you intend to make him do it in the presence of two witnesses, do\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You do wrong.\"\n\n\"Which means, I suppose, that you refuse the service which I asked of\nyou?\"\n\n\"You know my theory regarding duels; I told you my opinion on that\nsubject, if you remember, when we were at Rome.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, my dear count, I found you this morning engaged in\nan occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to\nentertain.\"\n\n\"Because, my dear fellow, you understand one must never be eccentric. If\none's lot is cast among fools, it is necessary to study folly. I shall\nperhaps find myself one day called out by some harebrained scamp, who\nhas no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with Beauchamp;\nhe may take me to task for some foolish trifle or other, he will bring\nhis witnesses, or will insult me in some public place, and I am expected\nto kill him for all that.\"\n\n\"You admit that you would fight, then? Well, if so, why do you object to\nmy doing so?\"\n\n\"I do not say that you ought not to fight, I only say that a duel is a\nserious thing, and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection.\"\n\n\"Did he reflect before he insulted my father?\"\n\n\"If he spoke hastily, and owns that he did so, you ought to be\nsatisfied.\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear count, you are far too indulgent.\"\n\n\"And you are far too exacting. Supposing, for instance, and do not be\nangry at what I am going to say\"--\n\n\"Well.\"\n\n\"Supposing the assertion to be really true?\"\n\n\"A son ought not to submit to such a stain on his father's honor.\"\n\n\"Ma foi, we live in times when there is much to which we must submit.\"\n\n\"That is precisely the fault of the age.\"\n\n\"And do you undertake to reform it?\"\n\n\"Yes, as far as I am personally concerned.\"\n\n\"Well, you are indeed exacting, my dear fellow!\"\n\n\"Yes, I own it.\"\n\n\"Are you quite impervious to good advice?\"\n\n\"Not when it comes from a friend.\"\n\n\"And do you account me that title?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do.\"\n\n\"Well, then, before going to Beauchamp with your witnesses, seek further\ninformation on the subject.\"\n\n\"From whom?\"\n\n\"From Haidee.\"\n\n\"Why, what can be the use of mixing a woman up in the affair?--what can\nshe do in it?\"\n\n\"She can declare to you, for example, that your father had no hand\nwhatever in the defeat and death of the vizier; or if by chance he had,\nindeed, the misfortune to\"--\n\n\"I have told you, my dear count, that I would not for one moment admit\nof such a proposition.\"\n\n\"You reject this means of information, then?\"\n\n\"I do--most decidedly.\"\n\n\"Then let me offer one more word of advice.\"\n\n\"Do so, then, but let it be the last.\"\n\n\"You do not wish to hear it, perhaps?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I request it.\"\n\n\"Do not take any witnesses with you when you go to Beauchamp--visit him\nalone.\"\n\n\"That would be contrary to all custom.\"\n\n\"Your case is not an ordinary one.\"\n\n\"And what is your reason for advising me to go alone?\"\n\n\"Because then the affair will rest between you and Beauchamp.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself.\"\n\n\"I will do so. If Beauchamp be disposed to retract, you ought at least\nto give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free will,--the\nsatisfaction to you will be the same. If, on the contrary, he refuses\nto do so, it will then be quite time enough to admit two strangers into\nyour secret.\"\n\n\"They will not be strangers, they will be friends.\"\n\n\"Ah, but the friends of to-day are the enemies of to-morrow; Beauchamp,\nfor instance.\"\n\n\"So you recommend\"--\n\n\"I recommend you to be prudent.\"\n\n\"Then you advise me to go alone to Beauchamp?\"\n\n\"I do, and I will tell you why. When you wish to obtain some concession\nfrom a man's self-love, you must avoid even the appearance of wishing to\nwound it.\"\n\n\"I believe you are right.\"\n\n\"I am glad of it.\"\n\n\"Then I will go alone.\"\n\n\"Go; but you would do better still by not going at all.\"\n\n\"That is impossible.\"\n\n\"Do so, then; it will be a wiser plan than the first which you\nproposed.\"\n\n\"But if, in spite of all my precautions, I am at last obliged to fight,\nwill you not be my second?\"\n\n\"My dear viscount,\" said Monte Cristo gravely, \"you must have seen\nbefore to-day that at all times and in all places I have been at your\ndisposal, but the service which you have just demanded of me is one\nwhich it is out of my power to render you.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Perhaps you may know at some future period, and in the mean time\nI request you to excuse my declining to put you in possession of my\nreasons.\"\n\n\"Well, I will have Franz and Chateau-Renaud; they will be the very men\nfor it.\"\n\n\"Do so, then.\"\n\n\"But if I do fight, you will surely not object to giving me a lesson or\ntwo in shooting and fencing?\"\n\n\"That, too, is impossible.\"\n\n\"What a singular being you are!--you will not interfere in anything.\"\n\n\"You are right--that is the principle on which I wish to act.\"\n\n\"We will say no more about it, then. Good-by, count.\" Morcerf took his\nhat, and left the room. He found his carriage at the door, and doing his\nutmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find Beauchamp, who\nwas in his office. It was a gloomy, dusty-looking apartment, such as\njournalists' offices have always been from time immemorial. The servant\nannounced M. Albert de Morcerf. Beauchamp repeated the name to himself,\nas though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright, and then\ngave orders for him to be admitted. Albert entered. Beauchamp uttered an\nexclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under\nfoot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room. \"This way,\nthis way, my dear Albert!\" said he, holding out his hand to the young\nman. \"Are you out of your senses, or do you come peaceably to take\nbreakfast with me? Try and find a seat--there is one by that geranium,\nwhich is the only thing in the room to remind me that there are other\nleaves in the world besides leaves of paper.\"\n\n\"Beauchamp,\" said Albert, \"it is of your journal that I come to speak.\"\n\n\"Indeed? What do you wish to say about it?\"\n\n\"I desire that a statement contained in it should be rectified.\"\n\n\"To what do you refer? But pray sit down.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Albert, with a cold and formal bow.\n\n\"Will you now have the kindness to explain the nature of the statement\nwhich has displeased you?\"\n\n\"An announcement has been made which implicates the honor of a member of\nmy family.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" said Beauchamp, much surprised; \"surely you must be\nmistaken.\"\n\n\"The story sent you from Yanina.\"\n\n\"Yanina?\"\n\n\"Yes; really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings\nme here.\"\n\n\"Such is really the case, I assure you, upon my honor! Baptiste, give me\nyesterday's paper,\" cried Beauchamp.\n\n\"Here, I have brought mine with me,\" replied Albert.\n\nBeauchamp took the paper, and read the article to which Albert pointed\nin an undertone. \"You see it is a serious annoyance,\" said Morcerf, when\nBeauchamp had finished the perusal of the paragraph. \"Is the officer\nreferred to a relation of yours, then?\" demanded the journalist.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Albert, blushing.\n\n\"Well, what do you wish me to do for you?\" said Beauchamp mildly.\n\n\"My dear Beauchamp, I wish you to contradict this statement.\" Beauchamp\nlooked at Albert with a benevolent expression.\n\n\"Come,\" said he, \"this matter will want a good deal of talking over; a\nretractation is always a serious thing, you know. Sit down, and I will\nread it again.\" Albert resumed his seat, and Beauchamp read, with more\nattention than at first, the lines denounced by his friend. \"Well,\" said\nAlbert in a determined tone, \"you see that your paper his insulted a\nmember of my family, and I insist on a retractation being made.\"\n\n\"You insist?\"\n\n\"Yes, I insist.\"\n\n\"Permit me to remind you that you are not in the Chamber, my dear\nViscount.\"\n\n\"Nor do I wish to be there,\" replied the young man, rising. \"I repeat\nthat I am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted.\nYou have known me long enough,\" continued Albert, biting his lips\nconvulsively, for he saw that Beauchamp's anger was beginning to\nrise,--\"you have been my friend, and therefore sufficiently intimate\nwith me to be aware that I am likely to maintain my resolution on this\npoint.\"\n\n\"If I have been your friend, Morcerf, your present manner of speaking\nwould almost lead me to forget that I ever bore that title. But wait a\nmoment, do not let us get angry, or at least not yet. You are irritated\nand vexed--tell me how this Fernand is related to you?\"\n\n\"He is merely my father,\" said Albert--\"M. Fernand Mondego, Count of\nMorcerf, an old soldier who has fought in twenty battles and whose\nhonorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace.\"\n\n\"Is it your father?\" said Beauchamp; \"that is quite another thing. Then I\ncan well understand your indignation, my dear Albert. I will look at it\nagain;\" and he read the paragraph for the third time, laying a stress\non each word as he proceeded. \"But the paper nowhere identifies this\nFernand with your father.\"\n\n\"No; but the connection will be seen by others, and therefore I will\nhave the article contradicted.\" At the words \"I will,\" Beauchamp\nsteadily raised his eyes to Albert's countenance, and then as gradually\nlowering them, he remained thoughtful for a few moments. \"You will\nretract this assertion, will you not, Beauchamp?\" said Albert with\nincreased though stifled anger.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Beauchamp.\n\n\"Immediately?\" said Albert.\n\n\"When I am convinced that the statement is false.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The thing is worth looking into, and I will take pains to investigate\nthe matter thoroughly.\"\n\n\"But what is there to investigate, sir?\" said Albert, enraged beyond\nmeasure at Beauchamp's last remark. \"If you do not believe that it is my\nfather, say so immediately; and if, on the contrary, you believe it to\nbe him, state your reasons for doing so.\" Beauchamp looked at Albert\nwith the smile which was so peculiar to him, and which in its numerous\nmodifications served to express every varied emotion of his mind. \"Sir,\"\nreplied he, \"if you came to me with the idea of demanding satisfaction,\nyou should have gone at once to the point, and not have entertained me\nwith the idle conversation to which I have been patiently listening for\nthe last half hour. Am I to put this construction on your visit?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you will not consent to retract that infamous calumny.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment--no threats, if you please, M. Fernand Mondego, Vicomte\nde Morcerf; I never allow them from my enemies, and therefore shall not\nput up with them from my friends. You insist on my contradicting the\narticle relating to General Fernand, an article with which, I assure you\non my word of honor, I had nothing whatever to do?\"\n\n\"Yes, I insist on it,\" said Albert, whose mind was beginning to get\nbewildered with the excitement of his feelings.\n\n\"And if I refuse to retract, you wish to fight, do you?\" said Beauchamp\nin a calm tone.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Albert, raising his voice.\n\n\"Well,\" said Beauchamp, \"here is my answer, my dear sir. The article\nwas not inserted by me--I was not even aware of it; but you have, by the\nstep you have taken, called my attention to the paragraph in question,\nand it will remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by\nsome one who has a right to do so.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Albert, rising, \"I will do myself the honor of sending my\nseconds to you, and you will be kind enough to arrange with them the\nplace of meeting and the weapons.\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear sir.\"\n\n\"And this evening, if you please, or to-morrow at the latest, we will\nmeet.\"\n\n\"No, no, I will be on the ground at the proper time; but in my opinion\n(and I have a right to dictate the preliminaries, as it is I who have\nreceived the provocation)--in my opinion the time ought not to be yet.\nI know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword, while I am\nonly moderately so; I know, too, that you are a good marksman--there we\nare about equal. I know that a duel between us two would be a serious\naffair, because you are brave, and I am brave also. I do not therefore\nwish either to kill you, or to be killed myself without a cause. Now, I\nam going to put a question to you, and one very much to the purpose too.\nDo you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if I do not make\nit, although I have repeated more than once, and affirmed on my honor,\nthat I was ignorant of the thing with which you charge me, and although\nI still declare that it is impossible for any one but you to recognize\nthe Count of Morcerf under the name of Fernand?\"\n\n\"I maintain my original resolution.\"\n\n\"Very well, my dear sir; then I consent to cut throats with you. But I\nrequire three weeks' preparation; at the end of that time I shall come\nand say to you, 'The assertion is false, and I retract it,' or 'The\nassertion is true,' when I shall immediately draw the sword from its\nsheath, or the pistols from the case, whichever you please.\"\n\n\"Three weeks!\" cried Albert; \"they will pass as slowly as three\ncenturies when I am all the time suffering dishonor.\"\n\n\"Had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me, I should have\nsaid, 'Patience, my friend;' but you have constituted yourself my enemy,\ntherefore I say, 'What does that signify to me, sir?'\"\n\n\"Well, let it be three weeks then,\" said Morcerf; \"but remember, at the\nexpiration of that time no delay or subterfuge will justify you in\"--\n\n\"M. Albert de Morcerf,\" said Beauchamp, rising in his turn, \"I cannot\nthrow you out of window for three weeks--that is to say, for twenty-four\ndays to come--nor have you any right to split my skull open till that\ntime has elapsed. To-day is the 29th of August; the 21st of September\nwill, therefore, be the conclusion of the term agreed on, and till that\ntime arrives--and it is the advice of a gentleman which I am about to\ngive you--till then we will refrain from growling and barking like two\ndogs chained within sight of each other.\" When he had concluded his\nspeech, Beauchamp bowed coldly to Albert, turned his back upon him, and\nwent to the press-room.\n\nAlbert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers, which he sent flying\nall over the office by switching them violently with his stick; after\nwhich ebullition he departed--not, however, without walking several\ntimes to the door of the press-room, as if he had half a mind to enter.\nWhile Albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner\nthat he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his\ndiscomfiture, as he was crossing the barrier he perceived Morrel, who\nwas walking with a quick step and a bright eye. He was passing the\nChinese Baths, and appeared to have come from the direction of the Porte\nSaint-Martin, and to be going towards the Madeleine. \"Ah,\" said Morcerf,\n\"there goes a happy man!\" And it so happened Albert was not mistaken in\nhis opinion.\n\n\n\nChapter 79. The Lemonade.\n\nMorrel was, in fact, very happy. M. Noirtier had just sent for him, and\nhe was in such haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not\nstopped to take a cab, placing infinitely more dependence on his own two\nlegs than on the four legs of a cab-horse. He had therefore set off at\na furious rate from the Rue Meslay, and was hastening with rapid strides\nin the direction of the Faubourg Saint-Honore. Morrel advanced with\na firm, manly tread, and poor Barrois followed him as he best might.\nMorrel was only thirty-one, Barrois was sixty years of age; Morrel was\ndeeply in love, and Barrois was dying with heat and exertion. These\ntwo men, thus opposed in age and interests, resembled two parts of\na triangle, presenting the extremes of separation, yet nevertheless\npossessing their point of union. This point of union was Noirtier, and\nit was he who had just sent for Morrel, with the request that the latter\nwould lose no time in coming to him--a command which Morrel obeyed to\nthe letter, to the great discomfiture of Barrois. On arriving at the\nhouse, Morrel was not even out of breath, for love lends wings to our\ndesires; but Barrois, who had long forgotten what it was to love, was\nsorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use.\n\nThe old servant introduced Morrel by a private entrance, closed the door\nof the study, and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of\nValentine. She looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress,\nand Morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he\nfelt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her\ngrandfather. But the easy-chair of the old man was heard rolling\nalong the floor, and he soon made his appearance in the room. Noirtier\nacknowledged by a look of extreme kindness and benevolence the thanks\nwhich Morrel lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf\nof Valentine and himself--an intervention which had saved them from\ndespair. Morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as to the\nnew favor which he designed to bestow on him. Valentine was sitting at\na little distance from them, timidly awaiting the moment when she should\nbe obliged to speak. Noirtier fixed his eyes on her. \"Am I to say what\nyou told me?\" asked Valentine. Noirtier made a sign that she was to do\nso.\n\n\"Monsieur Morrel,\" said Valentine to the young man, who was regarding\nher with the most intense interest, \"my grandfather, M. Noirtier, had a\nthousand things to say, which he told me three days ago; and now, he has\nsent for you, that I may repeat them to you. I will repeat them, then;\nand since he has chosen me as his interpreter, I will be faithful to the\ntrust, and will not alter a word of his intentions.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am listening with the greatest impatience,\" replied the young\nman; \"speak, I beg of you.\" Valentine cast down her eyes; this was a\ngood omen for Morrel, for he knew that nothing but happiness could have\nthe power of thus overcoming Valentine. \"My grandfather intends leaving\nthis house,\" said she, \"and Barrois is looking out suitable apartments\nfor him in another.\"\n\n\"But you, Mademoiselle de Villefort,--you, who are necessary to M.\nNoirtier's happiness\"--\n\n\"I?\" interrupted Valentine; \"I shall not leave my grandfather,--that is\nan understood thing between us. My apartment will be close to his.\nNow, M. de Villefort must either give his consent to this plan or his\nrefusal; in the first case, I shall leave directly, and in the second,\nI shall wait till I am of age, which will be in about ten months. Then I\nshall be free, I shall have an independent fortune, and\"--\n\n\"And what?\" demanded Morrel.\n\n\"And with my grandfather's consent I shall fulfil the promise which I\nhave made you.\" Valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low\ntone, that nothing but Morrel's intense interest in what she was saying\ncould have enabled him to hear them. \"Have I not explained your wishes,\ngrandpapa?\" said Valentine, addressing Noirtier. \"Yes,\" looked the old\nman.--\"Once under my grandfather's roof, M. Morrel can visit me in the\npresence of my good and worthy protector, if we still feel that the\nunion we contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and\nhappiness; in that case I shall expect M. Morrel to come and claim me\nat my own hands. But, alas, I have heard it said that hearts inflamed\nby obstacles to their desire grew cold in time of security; I trust we\nshall never find it so in our experience!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" cried Morrel, almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before\nNoirtier and Valentine, and to adore them as two superior beings, \"what\nhave I ever done in my life to merit such unbounded happiness?\"\n\n\"Until that time,\" continued the young girl in a calm and self-possessed\ntone of voice, \"we will conform to circumstances, and be guided by the\nwishes of our friends, so long as those wishes do not tend finally to\nseparate us; in a word, and I repeat it, because it expresses all I wish\nto convey,--we will wait.\"\n\n\"And I swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes, sir,\"\nsaid Morrel, \"not only with resignation, but with cheerfulness.\"\n\n\"Therefore,\" continued Valentine, looking playfully at Maximilian, \"no\nmore inconsiderate actions--no more rash projects; for you surely\nwould not wish to compromise one who from this day regards herself as\ndestined, honorably and happily, to bear your name?\"\n\nMorrel looked obedience to her commands. Noirtier regarded the lovers\nwith a look of ineffable tenderness, while Barrois, who had remained in\nthe room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that\npassed, smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from\nhis bald forehead. \"How hot you look, my good Barrois,\" said Valentine.\n\n\"Ah, I have been running very fast, mademoiselle, but I must do M.\nMorrel the justice to say that he ran still faster.\" Noirtier directed\ntheir attention to a waiter, on which was placed a decanter containing\nlemonade and a glass. The decanter was nearly full, with the exception\nof a little, which had been already drunk by M. Noirtier.\n\n\"Come, Barrois,\" said the young girl, \"take some of this lemonade; I see\nyou are coveting a good draught of it.\"\n\n\"The fact is, mademoiselle,\" said Barrois, \"I am dying with thirst, and\nsince you are so kind as to offer it me, I cannot say I should at all\nobject to drinking your health in a glass of it.\"\n\n\"Take some, then, and come back immediately.\" Barrois took away the\nwaiter, and hardly was he outside the door, which in his haste he forgot\nto shut, than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the very\ndregs the glass which Valentine had filled. Valentine and Morrel were\nexchanging their adieux in the presence of Noirtier when a ring was\nheard at the door-bell. It was the signal of a visit. Valentine looked\nat her watch.\n\n\"It is past noon,\" said she, \"and to-day is Saturday; I dare say it\nis the doctor, grandpapa.\" Noirtier looked his conviction that she\nwas right in her supposition. \"He will come in here, and M. Morrel had\nbetter go,--do you not think so, grandpapa?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" signed the old man.\n\n\"Barrois,\" cried Valentine, \"Barrois!\"\n\n\"I am coming, mademoiselle,\" replied he. \"Barrois will open the door for\nyou,\" said Valentine, addressing Morrel. \"And now remember one thing,\nMonsieur Officer, that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash\nor ill-advised step which would be likely to compromise our happiness.\"\n\n\"I promised him to wait,\" replied Morrel; \"and I will wait.\"\n\nAt this moment Barrois entered. \"Who rang?\" asked Valentine.\n\n\"Doctor d'Avrigny,\" said Barrois, staggering as if he would fall.\n\n\"What is the matter, Barrois?\" said Valentine. The old man did not\nanswer, but looked at his master with wild staring eyes, while with\nhis cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand\nupright. \"He is going to fall!\" cried Morrel. The rigors which had\nattacked Barrois gradually increased, the features of the face became\nquite altered, and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to\nindicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder. Noirtier,\nseeing Barrois in this pitiable condition, showed by his looks all the\nvarious emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of\nman. Barrois made some steps towards his master.\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" said he, \"tell me what is the matter with me. I am\nsuffering--I cannot see. A thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain.\nAh, don't touch me, pray don't.\" By this time his haggard eyes had the\nappearance of being ready to start from their sockets; his head fell\nback, and the lower extremities of the body began to stiffen. Valentine\nuttered a cry of horror; Morrel took her in his arms, as if to defend\nher from some unknown danger. \"M. d'Avrigny, M. d'Avrigny,\" cried she,\nin a stifled voice. \"Help, help!\" Barrois turned round and with a great\neffort stumbled a few steps, then fell at the feet of Noirtier, and\nresting his hand on the knee of the invalid, exclaimed, \"My master, my\ngood master!\" At this moment M. de Villefort, attracted by the noise,\nappeared on the threshold. Morrel relaxed his hold of Valentine, and\nretreating to a distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind\na curtain. Pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent, he fixed his\nterrified eye on the agonized sufferer.\n\nNoirtier, burning with impatience and terror, was in despair at his\nutter inability to help his old domestic, whom he regarded more in the\nlight of a friend than a servant. One might by the fearful swelling of\nthe veins of his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the\neye, trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living\nenergetic mind and the inanimate and helpless body. Barrois, his\nfeatures convulsed, his eyes suffused with blood, and his head thrown\nback, was lying at full length, beating the floor with his hands, while\nhis legs had become so stiff, that they looked as if they would break\nrather than bend. A slight appearance of foam was visible around the\nmouth, and he breathed painfully, and with extreme difficulty.\n\nVillefort seemed stupefied with astonishment, and remained gazing\nintently on the scene before him without uttering a word. He had not\nseen Morrel. After a moment of dumb contemplation, during which his face\nbecame pale and his hair seemed to stand on end, he sprang towards the\ndoor, crying out, \"Doctor, doctor! come instantly, pray come!\"\n\n\"Madame, madame!\" cried Valentine, calling her step-mother, and running\nup-stairs to meet her; \"come quick, quick!--and bring your bottle of\nsmelling-salts with you.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" said Madame de Villefort in a harsh and\nconstrained tone.\n\n\"Oh, come, come!\"\n\n\"But where is the doctor?\" exclaimed Villefort; \"where is he?\" Madame de\nVillefort now deliberately descended the staircase. In one hand she held\nher handkerchief, with which she appeared to be wiping her face, and in\nthe other a bottle of English smelling-salts. Her first look on entering\nthe room was at Noirtier, whose face, independent of the emotion which\nsuch a scene could not fail of producing, proclaimed him to be in\npossession of his usual health; her second glance was at the dying man.\nShe turned pale, and her eye passed quickly from the servant and rested\non the master.\n\n\"In the name of heaven, madame,\" said Villefort, \"where is the doctor?\nHe was with you just now. You see this is a fit of apoplexy, and he\nmight be saved if he could but be bled!\"\n\n\"Has he eaten anything lately?\" asked Madame de Villefort, eluding\nher husband's question. \"Madame,\" replied Valentine, \"he has not even\nbreakfasted. He has been running very fast on an errand with which my\ngrandfather charged him, and when he returned, took nothing but a glass\nof lemonade.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Madame de Villefort, \"why did he not take wine? Lemonade was\na very bad thing for him.\"\n\n\"Grandpapa's bottle of lemonade was standing just by his side; poor\nBarrois was very thirsty, and was thankful to drink anything he could\nfind.\" Madame de Villefort started. Noirtier looked at her with a glance\nof the most profound scrutiny. \"He has such a short neck,\" said she.\n\"Madame,\" said Villefort, \"I ask where is M. d'Avrigny? In God's name\nanswer me!\"\n\n\"He is with Edward, who is not quite well,\" replied Madame de Villefort,\nno longer being able to avoid answering.\n\nVillefort rushed up-stairs to fetch him. \"Take this,\" said Madame de\nVillefort, giving her smelling-bottle to Valentine. \"They will, no\ndoubt, bleed him; therefore I will retire, for I cannot endure the sight\nof blood;\" and she followed her husband up-stairs. Morrel now emerged\nfrom his hiding-place, where he had remained quite unperceived, so\ngreat had been the general confusion. \"Go away as quick as you can,\nMaximilian,\" said Valentine, \"and stay till I send for you. Go.\"\n\nMorrel looked towards Noirtier for permission to retire. The old man,\nwho had preserved all his usual coolness, made a sign to him to do so.\nThe young man pressed Valentine's hand to his lips, and then left the\nhouse by a back staircase. At the same moment that he quitted the room,\nVillefort and the doctor entered by an opposite door. Barrois was now\nshowing signs of returning consciousness. The crisis seemed past, a\nlow moaning was heard, and he raised himself on one knee. D'Avrigny and\nVillefort laid him on a couch. \"What do you prescribe, doctor?\" demanded\nVillefort. \"Give me some water and ether. You have some in the house,\nhave you not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic.\"\n\nVillefort immediately despatched a messenger. \"And now let every one\nretire.\"\n\n\"Must I go too?\" asked Valentine timidly.\n\n\"Yes, mademoiselle, you especially,\" replied the doctor abruptly.\n\nValentine looked at M. d'Avrigny with astonishment, kissed her\ngrandfather on the forehead, and left the room. The doctor closed the\ndoor after her with a gloomy air. \"Look, look, doctor,\" said Villefort,\n\"he is quite coming round again; I really do not think, after all, it is\nanything of consequence.\" M. d'Avrigny answered by a melancholy smile.\n\"How do you feel, Barrois?\" asked he. \"A little better, sir.\"\n\n\"Will you drink some of this ether and water?\"\n\n\"I will try; but don't touch me.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because I feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your\nfinger the fit would return.\"\n\n\"Drink.\"\n\nBarrois took the glass, and, raising it to his purple lips, took about\nhalf of the liquid offered him. \"Where do you suffer?\" asked the doctor.\n\n\"Everywhere. I feel cramps over my whole body.\"\n\n\"Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Any noise in the ears?\"\n\n\"Frightful.\"\n\n\"When did you first feel that?\"\n\n\"Just now.\"\n\n\"Suddenly?\"\n\n\"Yes, like a clap of thunder.\"\n\n\"Did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"No drowsiness?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"What have you eaten to-day?\"\n\n\"I have eaten nothing; I only drank a glass of my master's\nlemonade--that's all;\" and Barrois turned towards Noirtier, who,\nimmovably fixed in his arm-chair, was contemplating this terrible scene\nwithout allowing a word or a movement to escape him.\n\n\"Where is this lemonade?\" asked the doctor eagerly.\n\n\"Down-stairs in the decanter.\"\n\n\"Whereabouts downstairs?\"\n\n\"In the kitchen.\"\n\n\"Shall I go and fetch it, doctor?\" inquired Villefort.\n\n\"No, stay here and try to make Barrois drink the rest of this glass of\nether and water. I will go myself and fetch the lemonade.\" D'Avrigny\nbounded towards the door, flew down the back staircase, and almost\nknocked down Madame de Villefort, in his haste, who was herself going\ndown to the kitchen. She cried out, but d'Avrigny paid no attention to\nher; possessed with but one idea, he cleared the last four steps with\na bound, and rushed into the kitchen, where he saw the decanter about\nthree parts empty still standing on the waiter, where it had been left.\nHe darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey. Panting with\nloss of breath, he returned to the room he had just left. Madame de\nVillefort was slowly ascending the steps which led to her room. \"Is this\nthe decanter you spoke of?\" asked d'Avrigny.\n\n\"Yes, doctor.\"\n\n\"Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?\"\n\n\"I believe so.\"\n\n\"What did it taste like?\"\n\n\"It had a bitter taste.\"\n\nThe doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand,\nput his lips to it, and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when\nhe is tasting wine, he spat the liquor into the fireplace.\n\n\"It is no doubt the same,\" said he. \"Did you drink some too, M.\nNoirtier?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And did you also discover a bitter taste?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh, doctor,\" cried Barrois, \"the fit is coming on again. Oh, do\nsomething for me.\" The doctor flew to his patient. \"That emetic,\nVillefort--see if it is coming.\" Villefort sprang into the passage,\nexclaiming, \"The emetic! the emetic!--is it come yet?\" No one answered.\nThe most profound terror reigned throughout the house. \"If I had\nanything by means of which I could inflate the lungs,\" said d'Avrigny,\nlooking around him, \"perhaps I might prevent suffocation. But there is\nnothing which would do--nothing!\" \"Oh, sir,\" cried Barrois, \"are you\ngoing to let me die without help? Oh, I am dying! Oh, save me!\"\n\n\"A pen, a pen!\" said the doctor. There was one lying on the table; he\nendeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient, who, in the\nmidst of his convulsions, was making vain attempts to vomit; but the\njaws were so clinched that the pen could not pass them. This second\nattack was much more violent than the first, and he had slipped from the\ncouch to the ground, where he was writhing in agony. The doctor left him\nin this paroxysm, knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it, and,\ngoing up to Noirtier, said abruptly, \"How do you find yourself?--well?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have you any weight on the chest; or does your stomach feel light and\ncomfortable--eh?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the\ndose which I am accustomed to give you every Sunday?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did Barrois make your lemonade?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Was it you who asked him to drink some of it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Was it M. de Villefort?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Madame?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"It was your granddaughter, then, was it not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" A groan from Barrois, accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack\nthe very jawbones, attracted the attention of M. d'Avrigny; he left M.\nNoirtier, and returned to the sick man. \"Barrois,\" said the doctor, \"can\nyou speak?\" Barrois muttered a few unintelligible words. \"Try and make\nan effort to do so, my good man.\" said d'Avrigny. Barrois reopened his\nbloodshot eyes. \"Who made the lemonade?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Did you bring it to your master directly it was made?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You left it somewhere, then, in the meantime?\"\n\n\"Yes; I left it in the pantry, because I was called away.\"\n\n\"Who brought it into this room, then?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Valentine.\" D'Avrigny struck his forehead with his hand.\n\"Gracious heaven,\" exclaimed he. \"Doctor, doctor!\" cried Barrois, who\nfelt another fit coming.\n\n\"Will they never bring that emetic?\" asked the doctor.\n\n\"Here is a glass with one already prepared,\" said Villefort, entering\nthe room.\n\n\"Who prepared it?\"\n\n\"The chemist who came here with me.\"\n\n\"Drink it,\" said the doctor to Barrois. \"Impossible, doctor; it is\ntoo late; my throat is closing up. I am choking! Oh, my heart! Ah, my\nhead!--Oh, what agony!--Shall I suffer like this long?\"\n\n\"No, no, friend,\" replied the doctor, \"you will soon cease to suffer.\"\n\n\"Ah, I understand you,\" said the unhappy man. \"My God, have mercy upon\nme!\" and, uttering a fearful cry, Barrois fell back as if he had been\nstruck by lightning. D'Avrigny put his hand to his heart, and placed a\nglass before his lips.\n\n\"Well?\" said Villefort. \"Go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of\nviolets.\" Villefort went immediately. \"Do not be alarmed, M. Noirtier,\"\nsaid d'Avrigny; \"I am going to take my patient into the next room to\nbleed him; this sort of attack is very frightful to witness.\"\n\nAnd taking Barrois under the arms, he dragged him into an adjoining\nroom; but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade. Noirtier\nclosed his right eye. \"You want Valentine, do you not? I will tell them\nto send her to you.\" Villefort returned, and d'Avrigny met him in\nthe passage. \"Well, how is he now?\" asked he. \"Come in here,\" said\nd'Avrigny, and he took him into the chamber where the sick man lay. \"Is\nhe still in a fit?\" said the procureur.\n\n\"He is dead.\"\n\nVillefort drew back a few steps, and, clasping his hands, exclaimed,\nwith real amazement and sympathy, \"Dead?--and so soon too!\"\n\n\"Yes, it is very soon,\" said the doctor, looking at the corpse before\nhim; \"but that ought not to astonish you; Monsieur and Madame de\nSaint-Meran died as soon. People die very suddenly in your house, M. de\nVillefort.\"\n\n\"What?\" cried the magistrate, with an accent of horror and\nconsternation, \"are you still harping on that terrible idea?\"\n\n\"Still, sir; and I shall always do so,\" replied d'Avrigny, \"for it has\nnever for one instant ceased to retain possession of my mind; and that\nyou may be quite sure I am not mistaken this time, listen well to what I\nam going to say, M. de Villefort.\" The magistrate trembled convulsively.\n\"There is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any\nperceptible traces. I know it well; I have studied it in all its forms\nand in the effects which it produces. I recognized the presence of\nthis poison in the case of poor Barrois as well as in that of Madame de\nSaint-Meran. There is a way of detecting its presence. It restores the\nblue color of litmus-paper reddened by an acid, and it turns syrup of\nviolets green. We have no litmus-paper, but, see, here they come with\nthe syrup of violets.\"\n\nThe doctor was right; steps were heard in the passage. M. d'Avrigny\nopened the door, and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which\ncontained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup, he then carefully closed\nthe door. \"Look,\" said he to the procureur, whose heart beat so loudly\nthat it might almost be heard, \"here is in this cup some syrup of\nviolets, and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of\nwhich M. Noirtier and Barrois partook. If the lemonade be pure and\ninoffensive, the syrup will retain its color; if, on the contrary,\nthe lemonade be drugged with poison, the syrup will become green. Look\nclosely!\"\n\nThe doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the\ndecanter into the cup, and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began\nto form at the bottom of the cup; this sediment first took a blue shade,\nthen from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal, and from opal\nto emerald. Arrived at this last hue, it changed no more. The result of\nthe experiment left no doubt whatever on the mind.\n\n\"The unfortunate Barrois has been poisoned,\" said d'Avrigny, \"and I will\nmaintain this assertion before God and man.\" Villefort said nothing, but\nhe clasped his hands, opened his haggard eyes, and, overcome with his\nemotion, sank into a chair.\n\n\n\nChapter 80. The Accusation.\n\nM. D'Avrigny soon restored the magistrate to consciousness, who had\nlooked like a second corpse in that chamber of death. \"Oh, death is in\nmy house!\" cried Villefort.\n\n\"Say, rather, crime!\" replied the doctor.\n\n\"M. d'Avrigny,\" cried Villefort, \"I cannot tell you all I feel at this\nmoment,--terror, grief, madness.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said M. d'Avrigny, with an imposing calmness, \"but I think it is\nnow time to act. I think it is time to stop this torrent of mortality. I\ncan no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets without the hope\nof seeing the victims and society generally revenged.\" Villefort cast a\ngloomy look around him. \"In my house,\" murmured he, \"in my house!\"\n\n\"Come, magistrate,\" said M. d'Avrigny, \"show yourself a man; as an\ninterpreter of the law, do honor to your profession by sacrificing your\nselfish interests to it.\"\n\n\"You make me shudder, doctor. Do you talk of a sacrifice?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Do you then suspect any one?\"\n\n\"I suspect no one; death raps at your door--it enters--it goes, not\nblindfolded, but circumspectly, from room to room. Well, I follow its\ncourse, I track its passage; I adopt the wisdom of the ancients, and\nfeel my way, for my friendship for your family and my respect for you\nare as a twofold bandage over my eyes; well\"--\n\n\"Oh, speak, speak, doctor; I shall have courage.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, you have in your establishment, or in your family, perhaps,\none of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces only\none. Locusta and Agrippina, living at the same time, were an exception,\nand proved the determination of providence to effect the entire ruin of\nthe Roman empire, sullied by so many crimes. Brunehilde and Fredegonde\nwere the results of the painful struggle of civilization in its infancy,\nwhen man was learning to control mind, were it even by an emissary from\nthe realms of darkness. All these women had been, or were, beautiful.\nThe same flower of innocence had flourished, or was still flourishing,\non their brow, that is seen on the brow of the culprit in your house.\"\nVillefort shrieked, clasped his hands, and looked at the doctor with a\nsupplicating air. But the latter went on without pity:--\n\n\"'Seek whom the crime will profit,' says an axiom of jurisprudence.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" cried Villefort, \"alas, doctor, how often has man's justice\nbeen deceived by those fatal words. I know not why, but I feel that this\ncrime\"--\n\n\"You acknowledge, then, the existence of the crime?\"\n\n\"Yes, I see too plainly that it does exist. But it seems that it is\nintended to affect me personally. I fear an attack myself, after all\nthese disasters.\"\n\n\"Oh, man,\" murmured d'Avrigny, \"the most selfish of all animals, the\nmost personal of all creatures, who believes the earth turns, the sun\nshines, and death strikes for him alone,--an ant cursing God from the\ntop of a blade of grass! And have those who have lost their lives lost\nnothing?--M. de Saint-Meran, Madame de Saint-Meran, M. Noirtier\"--\n\n\"How? M. Noirtier?\"\n\n\"Yes; think you it was the poor servant's life was coveted? No, no;\nlike Shakespeare's 'Polonius,' he died for another. It was Noirtier the\nlemonade was intended for--it is Noirtier, logically speaking, who drank\nit. The other drank it only by accident, and, although Barrois is dead,\nit was Noirtier whose death was wished for.\"\n\n\"But why did it not kill my father?\"\n\n\"I told you one evening in the garden after Madame de Saint-Meran's\ndeath--because his system is accustomed to that very poison, and the\ndose was trifling to him, which would be fatal to another; because no\none knows, not even the assassin, that, for the last twelve months, I\nhave given M. Noirtier brucine for his paralytic affection, while the\nassassin is not ignorant, for he has proved that brucine is a violent\npoison.\"\n\n\"Oh, have pity--have pity!\" murmured Villefort, wringing his hands.\n\n\"Follow the culprit's steps; he first kills M. de Saint-Meran\"--\n\n\"O doctor!\"\n\n\"I would swear to it; what I heard of his symptoms agrees too well with\nwhat I have seen in the other cases.\" Villefort ceased to contend; he\nonly groaned. \"He first kills M. de Saint-Meran,\" repeated the doctor,\n\"then Madame de Saint-Meran,--a double fortune to inherit.\" Villefort\nwiped the perspiration from his forehead. \"Listen attentively.\"\n\n\"Alas,\" stammered Villefort, \"I do not lose a single word.\"\n\n\"M. Noirtier,\" resumed M. d'Avrigny in the same pitiless tone,--\"M.\nNoirtier had once made a will against you--against your family--in favor\nof the poor, in fact; M. Noirtier is spared, because nothing is expected\nfrom him. But he has no sooner destroyed his first will and made a\nsecond, than, for fear he should make a third, he is struck down. The\nwill was made the day before yesterday, I believe; you see there has\nbeen no time lost.\"\n\n\"Oh, mercy, M. d'Avrigny!\"\n\n\"No mercy, sir! The physician has a sacred mission on earth; and\nto fulfil it he begins at the source of life, and goes down to the\nmysterious darkness of the tomb. When crime has been committed, and\nGod, doubtless in anger, turns away his face, it is for the physician to\nbring the culprit to justice.\"\n\n\"Have mercy on my child, sir,\" murmured Villefort.\n\n\"You see it is yourself who have first named her--you, her father.\"\n\n\"Have pity on Valentine! Listen--it is impossible! I would as willingly\naccuse myself! Valentine, whose heart is pure as a diamond or a lily.\"\n\n\"No pity, procureur; the crime is fragrant. Mademoiselle herself packed\nall the medicines which were sent to M. de Saint-Meran; and M. de\nSaint-Meran is dead. Mademoiselle de Villefort prepared all the cooling\ndraughts which Madame de Saint-Meran took, and Madame de Saint-Meran is\ndead. Mademoiselle de Villefort took from the hands of Barrois, who was\nsent out, the lemonade which M. Noirtier had every morning, and he has\nescaped by a miracle. Mademoiselle de Villefort is the culprit--she is\nthe poisoner! To you, as the king's attorney, I denounce Mademoiselle de\nVillefort, do your duty.\"\n\n\"Doctor, I resist no longer--I can no longer defend myself--I believe\nyou; but, for pity's sake, spare my life, my honor!\"\n\n\"M. de Villefort,\" replied the doctor, with increased vehemence, \"there\nare occasions when I dispense with all foolish human circumspection.\nIf your daughter had committed only one crime, and I saw her meditating\nanother, I would say 'Warn her, punish her, let her pass the remainder\nof her life in a convent, weeping and praying.' If she had committed\ntwo crimes, I would say, 'Here, M. de Villefort, is a poison that the\nprisoner is not acquainted with,--one that has no known antidote, quick\nas thought, rapid as lightning, mortal as the thunderbolt; give her that\npoison, recommending her soul to God, and save your honor and your life,\nfor it is yours she aims at; and I can picture her approaching your\npillow with her hypocritical smiles and her sweet exhortations. Woe to\nyou, M. de Villefort, if you do not strike first!' This is what I would\nsay had she only killed two persons but she has seen three deaths,--has\ncontemplated three murdered persons,--has knelt by three corpses! To the\nscaffold with the poisoner--to the scaffold! Do you talk of your honor?\nDo what I tell you, and immortality awaits you!\"\n\nVillefort fell on his knees. \"Listen,\" said he; \"I have not the strength\nof mind you have, or rather that which you would not have, if instead\nof my daughter Valentine your daughter Madeleine were concerned.\" The\ndoctor turned pale. \"Doctor, every son of woman is born to suffer and to\ndie; I am content to suffer and to await death.\"\n\n\"Beware,\" said M. d'Avrigny, \"it may come slowly; you will see it\napproach after having struck your father, your wife, perhaps your son.\"\n\nVillefort, suffocating, pressed the doctor's arm. \"Listen,\" cried he;\n\"pity me--help me! No, my daughter is not guilty. If you drag us\nboth before a tribunal I will still say, 'No, my daughter is not\nguilty;--there is no crime in my house. I will not acknowledge a crime\nin my house; for when crime enters a dwelling, it is like death--it does\nnot come alone.' Listen. What does it signify to you if I am murdered?\nAre you my friend? Are you a man? Have you a heart? No, you are a\nphysician! Well, I tell you I will not drag my daughter before a\ntribunal, and give her up to the executioner! The bare idea would\nkill me--would drive me like a madman to dig my heart out with my\nfinger-nails! And if you were mistaken, doctor--if it were not my\ndaughter--if I should come one day, pale as a spectre, and say to you,\n'Assassin, you have killed my child!'--hold--if that should happen,\nalthough I am a Christian, M. d'Avrigny, I should kill myself.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the doctor, after a moment's silence, \"I will wait.\"\nVillefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words. \"Only,\"\ncontinued M. d'Avrigny, with a slow and solemn tone, \"if any one falls\nill in your house, if you feel yourself attacked, do not send for me,\nfor I will come no more. I will consent to share this dreadful secret\nwith you, but I will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in\nmy conscience, as crime and misery will in your house.\"\n\n\"Then you abandon me, doctor?\"\n\n\"Yes, for I can follow you no farther, and I only stop at the foot of\nthe scaffold. Some further discovery will be made, which will bring this\ndreadful tragedy to a close. Adieu.\"\n\n\"I entreat you, doctor!\"\n\n\"All the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and\nfatal. Adieu, sir.\"\n\n\"One word--one single word more, doctor! You go, leaving me in all the\nhorror of my situation, after increasing it by what you have revealed\nto me. But what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor old\nservant?\"\n\n\"True,\" said M. d'Avrigny; \"we will return.\" The doctor went out first,\nfollowed by M. de Villefort. The terrified servants were on the stairs\nand in the passage where the doctor would pass. \"Sir,\" said d'Avrigny\nto Villefort, so loud that all might hear, \"poor Barrois has led too\nsedentary a life of late; accustomed formerly to ride on horseback,\nor in the carriage, to the four corners of Europe, the monotonous walk\naround that arm-chair has killed him--his blood has thickened. He was\nstout, had a short, thick neck; he was attacked with apoplexy, and I was\ncalled in too late. By the way,\" added he in a low tone, \"take care to\nthrow away that cup of syrup of violets in the ashes.\"\n\nThe doctor, without shaking hands with Villefort, without adding a word\nto what he had said, went out, amid the tears and lamentations of the\nwhole household. The same evening all Villefort's servants, who had\nassembled in the kitchen, and had a long consultation, came to\ntell Madame de Villefort that they wished to leave. No entreaty, no\nproposition of increased wages, could induce them to remain; to every\nargument they replied, \"We must go, for death is in this house.\" They\nall left, in spite of prayers and entreaties, testifying their regret\nat leaving so good a master and mistress, and especially Mademoiselle\nValentine, so good, so kind, and so gentle. Villefort looked at\nValentine as they said this. She was in tears, and, strange as it was,\nin spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears, he looked\nalso at Madame de Villefort, and it appeared to him as if a slight\ngloomy smile had passed over her thin lips, like a meteor seen passing\ninauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky.\n\n\n\nChapter 81. The Room of the Retired Baker.\n\nThe evening of the day on which the Count of Morcerf had left Danglars'\nhouse with feelings of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected\nalliance, M. Andrea Cavalcanti, with curled hair, mustaches in perfect\norder, and white gloves which fitted admirably, had entered the\ncourtyard of the banker's house in La Chaussee d'Antin. He had not been\nmore than ten minutes in the drawing-room before he drew Danglars aside\ninto the recess of a bow-window, and, after an ingenious preamble,\nrelated to him all his anxieties and cares since his noble father's\ndeparture. He acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown\nhim by the banker's family, in which he had been received as a son, and\nwhere, besides, his warmest affections had found an object on which\nto centre in Mademoiselle Danglars. Danglars listened with the most\nprofound attention; he had expected this declaration for the last two or\nthree days, and when at last it came his eyes glistened as much as\nthey had lowered on listening to Morcerf. He would not, however, yield\nimmediately to the young man's request, but made a few conscientious\nobjections. \"Are you not rather young, M. Andrea, to think of marrying?\"\n\n\"I think not, sir,\" replied M. Cavalcanti; \"in Italy the nobility\ngenerally marry young. Life is so uncertain, that we ought to secure\nhappiness while it is within our reach.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Danglars, \"in case your proposals, which do me honor,\nare accepted by my wife and daughter, by whom shall the preliminary\narrangements be settled? So important a negotiation should, I think, be\nconducted by the respective fathers of the young people.\"\n\n\"Sir, my father is a man of great foresight and prudence. Thinking that\nI might wish to settle in France, he left me at his departure, together\nwith the papers establishing my identity, a letter promising, if he\napproved of my choice, 150,000 livres per annum from the day I was\nmarried. So far as I can judge, I suppose this to be a quarter of my\nfather's revenue.\"\n\n\"I,\" said Danglars, \"have always intended giving my daughter 500,000\nfrancs as her dowry; she is, besides, my sole heiress.\"\n\n\"All would then be easily arranged if the baroness and her daughter\nare willing. We should command an annuity of 175,000 livres. Supposing,\nalso, I should persuade the marquis to give me my capital, which is\nnot likely, but still is possible, we would place these two or three\nmillions in your hands, whose talent might make it realize ten per\ncent.\"\n\n\"I never give more than four per cent, and generally only three and a\nhalf; but to my son-in-law I would give five, and we would share the\nprofit.\"\n\n\"Very good, father-in-law,\" said Cavalcanti, yielding to his low-born\nnature, which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss with\nwhich he sought to conceal it. Correcting himself immediately, he said,\n\"Excuse me, sir; hope alone makes me almost mad,--what will not reality\ndo?\"\n\n\"But,\" said Danglars,--who, on his part, did not perceive how soon\nthe conversation, which was at first disinterested, was turning to a\nbusiness transaction,--\"there is, doubtless, a part of your fortune your\nfather could not refuse you?\"\n\n\"Which?\" asked the young man.\n\n\"That you inherit from your mother.\"\n\n\"Truly, from my mother, Leonora Corsinari.\"\n\n\"How much may it amount to?\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir,\" said Andrea, \"I assure you I have never given the subject\na thought, but I suppose it must have been at least two millions.\"\nDanglars felt as much overcome with joy as the miser who finds a lost\ntreasure, or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid\nground instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Andrea, bowing to the banker respectfully, \"may I\nhope?\"\n\n\"You may not only hope,\" said Danglars, \"but consider it a settled\nthing, if no obstacle arises on your part.\"\n\n\"I am, indeed, rejoiced,\" said Andrea.\n\n\"But,\" said Danglars thoughtfully, \"how is it that your patron, M.\nde Monte Cristo, did not make his proposal for you?\" Andrea blushed\nimperceptibly. \"I have just left the count, sir,\" said he; \"he is,\ndoubtless, a delightful man but inconceivably peculiar in his ideas. He\nesteems me highly. He even told me he had not the slightest doubt\nthat my father would give me the capital instead of the interest of my\nproperty. He has promised to use his influence to obtain it for me; but\nhe also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility\nof making proposals for another, and he never would. I must, however, do\nhim the justice to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the\nrepugnance he felt to such a step it was on this occasion, because he\nthought the projected union would be a happy and suitable one. Besides,\nif he will do nothing officially, he will answer any questions you\npropose to him. And now,\" continued he, with one of his most charming\nsmiles, \"having finished talking to the father-in-law, I must address\nmyself to the banker.\"\n\n\"And what may you have to say to him?\" said Danglars, laughing in his\nturn.\n\n\"That the day after to-morrow I shall have to draw upon you for about\nfour thousand francs; but the count, expecting my bachelor's revenue\ncould not suffice for the coming month's outlay, has offered me a draft\nfor twenty thousand francs. It bears his signature, as you see, which is\nall-sufficient.\"\n\n\"Bring me a million such as that,\" said Danglars, \"I shall be well\npleased,\" putting the draft in his pocket. \"Fix your own hour for\nto-morrow, and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty\nthousand francs.\"\n\n\"At ten o'clock then, if you please; I should like it early, as I am\ngoing into the country to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Very well, at ten o'clock; you are still at the Hotel des Princes?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe following morning, with the banker's usual punctuality, the eighty\nthousand francs were placed in the young man's hands as he was on the\npoint of starting, after having left two hundred francs for Caderousse.\nHe went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy, and returned as\nlate as possible in the evening. But scarcely had he stepped out of his\ncarriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand. \"Sir,\" said\nhe, \"that man has been here.\"\n\n\"What man?\" said Andrea carelessly, apparently forgetting him whom he\nbut too well recollected.\n\n\"Him to whom your excellency pays that little annuity.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Andrea, \"my father's old servant. Well, you gave him the two\nhundred francs I had left for him?\"\n\n\"Yes, your excellency.\" Andrea had expressed a wish to be thus\naddressed. \"But,\" continued the porter, \"he would not take them.\" Andrea\nturned pale, but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible. \"What?\nhe would not take them?\" said he with slight emotion.\n\n\"No, he wished to speak to your excellency; I told him you were gone\nout, and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this letter,\nwhich he had brought with him already sealed.\"\n\n\"Give it me,\" said Andrea, and he read by the light of his\ncarriage-lamp,--\"You know where I live; I expect you tomorrow morning at\nnine o'clock.\"\n\nAndrea examined it carefully, to ascertain if the letter had been\nopened, or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents; but it was\nso carefully folded, that no one could have read it, and the seal was\nperfect. \"Very well,\" said he. \"Poor man, he is a worthy creature.\"\nHe left the porter to ponder on these words, not knowing which most to\nadmire, the master or the servant. \"Take out the horses quickly, and\ncome up to me,\" said Andrea to his groom. In two seconds the young man\nhad reached his room and burnt Caderousse's letter. The servant entered\njust as he had finished. \"You are about my height, Pierre,\" said he.\n\n\"I have that honor, your excellency.\"\n\n\"You had a new livery yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening, and do\nnot wish to be known; lend me your livery till to-morrow. I may sleep,\nperhaps, at an inn.\" Pierre obeyed. Five minutes after, Andrea left the\nhotel, completely disguised, took a cabriolet, and ordered the driver to\ntake him to the Cheval Rouge, at Picpus. The next morning he left that\ninn as he had left the Hotel des Princes, without being noticed, walked\ndown the Faubourg St. Antoine, along the boulevard to Rue Menilmontant,\nand stopping at the door of the third house on the left looked for some\none of whom to make inquiry in the porter's absence. \"For whom are you\nlooking, my fine fellow?\" asked the fruiteress on the opposite side.\n\n\"Monsieur Pailletin, if you please, my good woman,\" replied Andrea.\n\n\"A retired baker?\" asked the fruiteress.\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"He lives at the end of the yard, on the left, on the third story.\"\nAndrea went as she directed him, and on the third floor he found a\nhare's paw, which, by the hasty ringing of the bell, it was evident he\npulled with considerable ill-temper. A moment after Caderousse's face\nappeared at the grating in the door. \"Ah, you are punctual,\" said he, as\nhe drew back the door.\n\n\"Confound you and your punctuality!\" said Andrea, throwing himself into\na chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at\nthe head of his host.\n\n\"Come, come, my little fellow, don't be angry. See, I have thought about\nyou--look at the good breakfast we are going to have; nothing but what\nyou are fond of.\" Andrea, indeed, inhaled the scent of something cooking\nwhich was not unwelcome to him, hungry as he was; it was that mixture\nof fat and garlic peculiar to provincial kitchens of an inferior order,\nadded to that of dried fish, and above all, the pungent smell of musk\nand cloves. These odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered\nand placed on a stove, and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot.\nIn an adjoining room Andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared\nfor two, two bottles of wine sealed, the one with green, the other with\nyellow, a supply of brandy in a decanter, and a measure of fruit in a\ncabbage-leaf, cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate.\n\n\"What do you think of it, my little fellow?\" said Caderousse. \"Ay, that\nsmells good! You know I used to be a famous cook; do you recollect how\nyou used to lick your fingers? You were among the first who tasted any\nof my dishes, and I think you relished them tolerably.\" While speaking,\nCaderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions.\n\n\"But,\" said Andrea, ill-temperedly, \"by my faith, if it was only to\nbreakfast with you, that you disturbed me, I wish the devil had taken\nyou!\"\n\n\"My boy,\" said Caderousse sententiously, \"one can talk while eating. And\nthen, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see an old friend?\nI am weeping with joy.\" He was truly crying, but it would have been\ndifficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect\non the lachrymal glands of the old inn-keeper of the Pont-du-Gard. \"Hold\nyour tongue, hypocrite,\" said Andrea; \"you love me!\"\n\n\"Yes, I do, or may the devil take me. I know it is a weakness,\" said\nCaderousse, \"but it overpowers me.\"\n\n\"And yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some\ntrick.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Caderousse, wiping his large knife on his apron, \"if I did\nnot like you, do you think I should endure the wretched life you\nlead me? Think for a moment. You have your servant's clothes on--you\ntherefore keep a servant; I have none, and am obliged to prepare my own\nmeals. You abuse my cookery because you dine at the table d'hote of\nthe Hotel des Princes, or the Cafe de Paris. Well, I too could keep a\nservant; I too could have a tilbury; I too could dine where I like; but\nwhy do I not? Because I would not annoy my little Benedetto. Come, just\nacknowledge that I could, eh?\" This address was accompanied by a look\nwhich was by no means difficult to understand. \"Well,\" said Andrea,\n\"admitting your love, why do you want me to breakfast with you?\"\n\n\"That I may have the pleasure of seeing you, my little fellow.\"\n\n\"What is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements?\"\n\n\"Eh, dear friend,\" said Caderousse, \"are wills ever made without\ncodicils? But you first came to breakfast, did you not? Well, sit down,\nand let us begin with these pilchards, and this fresh butter; which I\nhave put on some vine-leaves to please you, wicked one. Ah, yes; you\nlook at my room, my four straw chairs, my images, three francs each. But\nwhat do you expect? This is not the Hotel des Princes.\"\n\n\"Come, you are growing discontented, you are no longer happy; you, who\nonly wish to live like a retired baker.\" Caderousse sighed. \"Well, what\nhave you to say? you have seen your dream realized.\"\n\n\"I can still say it is a dream; a retired baker, my poor Benedetto, is\nrich--he has an annuity.\"\n\n\"Well, you have an annuity.\"\n\n\"I have?\"\n\n\"Yes, since I bring you your two hundred francs.\" Caderousse shrugged\nhis shoulders. \"It is humiliating,\" said he, \"thus to receive money\ngiven grudgingly,--an uncertain supply which may soon fail. You see I\nam obliged to economize, in case your prosperity should cease. Well, my\nfriend, fortune is inconstant, as the chaplain of the regiment said. I\nknow your prosperity is great, you rascal; you are to marry the daughter\nof Danglars.\"\n\n\"What? of Danglars?\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure; must I say Baron Danglars? I might as well say Count\nBenedetto. He was an old friend of mine and if he had not so bad a\nmemory he ought to invite me to your wedding, seeing he came to mine.\nYes, yes, to mine; gad, he was not so proud then,--he was an under-clerk\nto the good M. Morrel. I have dined many times with him and the Count of\nMorcerf, so you see I have some high connections and were I to cultivate\nthem a little, we might meet in the same drawing-rooms.\"\n\n\"Come, your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light.\"\n\n\"That is all very fine, Benedetto mio, but I know what I am saying.\nPerhaps I may one day put on my best coat, and presenting myself at\nthe great gate, introduce myself. Meanwhile let us sit down and\neat.\" Caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good\nappetite, praising each dish he set before his visitor. The latter\nseemed to have resigned himself; he drew the corks, and partook largely\nof the fish with the garlic and fat. \"Ah, mate,\" said Caderousse, \"you\nare getting on better terms with your old landlord!\"\n\n\"Faith, yes,\" replied Andrea, whose hunger prevailed over every other\nfeeling.\n\n\"So you like it, you rogue?\"\n\n\"So much that I wonder how a man who can cook thus can complain of hard\nliving.\"\n\n\"Do you see,\" said Caderousse, \"all my happiness is marred by one\nthought?\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"That I am dependent on another, I who have always gained my own\nlivelihood honestly.\"\n\n\"Do not let that disturb you, I have enough for two.\"\n\n\"No, truly; you may believe me if you will; at the end of every month I\nam tormented by remorse.\"\n\n\"Good Caderousse!\"\n\n\"So much so, that yesterday I would not take the two hundred francs.\"\n\n\"Yes, you wished to speak to me; but was it indeed remorse, tell me?\"\n\n\"True remorse; and, besides, an idea had struck me.\" Andrea shuddered;\nhe always did so at Caderousse's ideas. \"It is miserable--do you\nsee?--always to wait till the end of the month.\"--\"Oh,\" said Andrea\nphilosophically, determined to watch his companion narrowly, \"does not\nlife pass in waiting? Do I, for instance, fare better? Well, I wait\npatiently, do I not?\"\n\n\"Yes; because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs, you\nexpect five or six thousand, perhaps ten, perhaps even twelve, for you\ntake care not to let any one know the utmost. Down there, you always had\nlittle presents and Christmas-boxes which you tried to hide from your\npoor friend Caderousse. Fortunately he is a cunning fellow, that friend\nCaderousse.\"\n\n\"There you are beginning again to ramble, to talk again and again of the\npast! But what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again?\"\n\n\"Ah, you are only one and twenty, and can forget the past; I am fifty,\nand am obliged to recollect it. But let us return to business.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I was going to say, if I were in your place\"--\n\n\"Well.\"\n\n\"I would realize\"--\n\n\"How would you realize?\"\n\n\"I would ask for six months' in advance, under pretence of being able to\npurchase a farm, then with my six months I would decamp.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Andrea, \"that isn't a bad idea.\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said Caderousse, \"eat of my bread, and take my advice;\nyou will be none the worse off, physically or morally.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Andrea, \"why do you not act on the advice you gave me? Why\ndo you not realize a six months', a year's advance even, and retire\nto Brussels? Instead of living the retired baker, you might live as a\nbankrupt, using his privileges; that would be very good.\"\n\n\"But how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs?\"\n\n\"Ah, Caderousse,\" said Andrea, \"how covetous you are! Two months ago you\nwere dying with hunger.\"\n\n\"The appetite grows by what it feeds on,\" said Caderousse, grinning and\nshowing his teeth, like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling. \"And,\"\nadded he, biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of\nbread, \"I have formed a plan.\" Caderousse's plans alarmed Andrea still\nmore than his ideas; ideas were but the germ, the plan was reality. \"Let\nme see your plan; I dare say it is a pretty one.\"\n\n\"Why not? Who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of\nM----! eh? was it not I? and it was no bad one I believe, since here we\nare!\"\n\n\"I do not say,\" replied Andrea, \"that you never make a good one; but let\nus see your plan.\"\n\n\"Well,\" pursued Caderousse, \"can you without expending one sou, put me\nin the way of getting fifteen thousand francs? No, fifteen thousand are\nnot enough,--I cannot again become an honest man with less than thirty\nthousand francs.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Andrea, dryly, \"no, I cannot.\"\n\n\"I do not think you understand me,\" replied Caderousse, calmly; \"I said\nwithout your laying out a sou.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to commit a robbery, to spoil all my good fortune--and\nyours with mine--and both of us to be dragged down there again?\"\n\n\"It would make very little difference to me,\" said Caderousse, \"if I\nwere retaken, I am a poor creature to live alone, and sometimes pine\nfor my old comrades; not like you, heartless creature, who would be glad\nnever to see them again.\" Andrea did more than tremble this time, he\nturned pale.\n\n\"Come, Caderousse, no nonsense!\" said he.\n\n\"Don't alarm yourself, my little Benedetto, but just point out to\nme some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your\nassistance, and I will contrive it.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll see--I'll try to contrive some way,\" said Andrea.\n\n\"Meanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs,\nmy little fellow? I have a fancy, and mean to get a housekeeper.\"\n\n\"Well, you shall have your five hundred francs,\" said Andrea; \"but it is\nvery hard for me, my poor Caderousse--you take advantage\"--\n\n\"Bah,\" said Caderousse, \"when you have access to countless stores.\" One\nwould have said Andrea anticipated his companion's words, so did his eye\nflash like lightning, but it was but for a moment. \"True,\" he replied,\n\"and my protector is very kind.\"\n\n\"That dear protector,\" said Caderousse; \"and how much does he give you\nmonthly?\"\n\n\"Five thousand francs.\"\n\n\"As many thousands as you give me hundreds! Truly, it is only bastards\nwho are thus fortunate. Five thousand francs per month! What the devil\ncan you do with all that?\"\n\n\"Oh, it is no trouble to spend that; and I am like you, I want capital.\"\n\n\"Capital?--yes--I understand--every one would like capital.\"\n\n\"Well, and I shall get it.\"\n\n\"Who will give it to you--your prince?\"\n\n\"Yes, my prince. But unfortunately I must wait.\"\n\n\"You must wait for what?\" asked Caderousse.\n\n\"For his death.\"\n\n\"The death of your prince?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Because he has made his will in my favor.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"On my honor.\"\n\n\"For how much?\"\n\n\"For five hundred thousand.\"\n\n\"Only that? It's little enough.\"\n\n\"But so it is.\"\n\n\"No it cannot be!\"\n\n\"Are you my friend, Caderousse?\"\n\n\"Yes, in life or death.\"\n\n\"Well, I will tell you a secret.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"But remember\"--\n\n\"Ah, pardieu, mute as a carp.\"\n\n\"Well, I think\"--Andrea stopped and looked around.\n\n\"You think? Do not fear; pardieu, we are alone.\"\n\n\"I think I have discovered my father.\"\n\n\"Your true father?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Not old Cavalcanti?\"\n\n\"No, for he has gone again; the true one, as you say.\"\n\n\"And that father is\"--\n\n\"Well, Caderousse, it is Monte Cristo.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"Yes, you understand, that explains all. He cannot acknowledge me\nopenly, it appears, but he does it through M. Cavalcanti, and gives him\nfifty thousand francs for it.\"\n\n\"Fifty thousand francs for being your father? I would have done it for\nhalf that, for twenty thousand, for fifteen thousand; why did you not\nthink of me, ungrateful man?\"\n\n\"Did I know anything about it, when it was all done when I was down\nthere?\"\n\n\"Ah, truly? And you say that by his will\"--\n\n\"He leaves me five hundred thousand livres.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of it?\"\n\n\"He showed it me; but that is not all--there is a codicil, as I said\njust now.\"\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\"And in that codicil he acknowledges me.\"\n\n\"Oh, the good father, the brave father, the very honest father!\" said\nCaderousse, twirling a plate in the air between his two hands.\n\n\"Now say if I conceal anything from you?\"\n\n\"No, and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion; and your\nprincely father, is he rich, very rich?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is that; he does not himself know the amount of his fortune.\"\n\n\"Is it possible?\"\n\n\"It is evident enough to me, who am always at his house. The other day\na banker's clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about\nthe size of your plate; yesterday his banker brought him a hundred\nthousand francs in gold.\" Caderousse was filled with wonder; the young\nman's words sounded to him like metal, and he thought he could hear the\nrushing of cascades of louis. \"And you go into that house?\" cried he\nbriskly.\n\n\"When I like.\"\n\nCaderousse was thoughtful for a moment. It was easy to perceive he was\nrevolving some unfortunate idea in his mind. Then suddenly,--\"How I\nshould like to see all that,\" cried he; \"how beautiful it must be!\"\n\n\"It is, in fact, magnificent,\" said Andrea.\n\n\"And does he not live in the Champs-Elysees?\"\n\n\"Yes, No. 30.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Caderousse, \"No. 30.\"\n\n\"Yes, a fine house standing alone, between a court-yard and a\ngarden,--you must know it.\"\n\n\"Possibly; but it is not the exterior I care for, it is the interior.\nWhat beautiful furniture there must be in it!\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen the Tuileries?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, it surpasses that.\"\n\n\"It must be worth one's while to stoop, Andrea, when that good M. Monte\nCristo lets fall his purse.\"\n\n\"It is not worth while to wait for that,\" said Andrea; \"money is as\nplentiful in that house as fruit in an orchard.\"\n\n\"But you should take me there one day with you.\"\n\n\"How can I? On what plea?\"\n\n\"You are right; but you have made my mouth water. I must absolutely see\nit; I shall find a way.\"\n\n\"No nonsense, Caderousse!\"\n\n\"I will offer myself as floor-polisher.\"\n\n\"The rooms are all carpeted.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I must be contented to imagine it.\"\n\n\"That is the best plan, believe me.\"\n\n\"Try, at least, to give me an idea of what it is.\"\n\n\"How can I?\"\n\n\"Nothing is easier. Is it large?\"\n\n\"Middling.\"\n\n\"How is it arranged?\"\n\n\"Faith, I should require pen, ink, and paper to make a plan.\"\n\n\"They are all here,\" said Caderousse, briskly. He fetched from an\nold secretary a sheet of white paper and pen and ink. \"Here,\" said\nCaderousse, \"draw me all that on the paper, my boy.\" Andrea took the pen\nwith an imperceptible smile and began. \"The house, as I said, is between\nthe court and the garden; in this way, do you see?\" Andrea drew the\ngarden, the court and the house.\n\n\"High walls?\"\n\n\"Not more than eight or ten feet.\"\n\n\"That is not prudent,\" said Caderousse.\n\n\"In the court are orange-trees in pots, turf, and clumps of flowers.\"\n\n\"And no steel-traps?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"The stables?\"\n\n\"Are on either side of the gate, which you see there.\" And Andrea\ncontinued his plan.\n\n\"Let us see the ground floor,\" said Caderousse.\n\n\"On the ground-floor, dining-room, two drawing-rooms, billiard-room,\nstaircase in the hall, and a little back staircase.\"\n\n\"Windows?\"\n\n\"Magnificent windows, so beautiful, so large, that I believe a man of\nyour size should pass through each frame.\"\n\n\"Why the devil have they any stairs with such windows?\"\n\n\"Luxury has everything.\"\n\n\"But shutters?\"\n\n\"Yes, but they are never used. That Count of Monte Cristo is an\noriginal, who loves to look at the sky even at night.\"\n\n\"And where do the servants sleep?\"\n\n\"Oh, they have a house to themselves. Picture to yourself a pretty\ncoach-house at the right-hand side where the ladders are kept. Well,\nover that coach-house are the servants' rooms, with bells corresponding\nwith the different apartments.\"\n\n\"Ah, diable--bells did you say?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing! I only say they cost a load of money to hang, and what is\nthe use of them, I should like to know?\"\n\n\"There used to be a dog let loose in the yard at night, but it has been\ntaken to the house at Auteuil, to that you went to, you know.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I was saying to him only yesterday, 'You are imprudent, Monsieur Count;\nfor when you go to Auteuil and take your servants the house is left\nunprotected.' 'Well,' said he, 'what next?' 'Well, next, some day you\nwill be robbed.'\"\n\n\"What did he answer?\"\n\n\"He quietly said, 'What do I care if I am?'\"\n\n\"Andrea, he has some secretary with a spring.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Yes, which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune. I was told\nthere were such at the last exhibition.\"\n\n\"He has simply a mahogany secretary, in which the key is always kept.\"\n\n\"And he is not robbed?\"\n\n\"No; his servants are all devoted to him.\"\n\n\"There ought to be some money in that secretary?\"\n\n\"There may be. No one knows what there is.\"\n\n\"And where is it?\"\n\n\"On the first floor.\"\n\n\"Sketch me the plan of that floor, as you have done of the ground floor,\nmy boy.\"\n\n\"That is very simple.\" Andrea took the pen. \"On the first story, do you\nsee, there is the anteroom and the drawing-room; to the right of the\ndrawing-room, a library and a study; to the left, a bedroom and a\ndressing-room. The famous secretary is in the dressing-room.\"\n\n\"Is there a window in the dressing-room?\"\n\n\"Two,--one here and one there.\" Andrea sketched two windows in the room,\nwhich formed an angle on the plan, and appeared as a small square added\nto the rectangle of the bedroom. Caderousse became thoughtful. \"Does he\noften go to Auteuil?\" added he.\n\n\"Two or three times a week. To-morrow, for instance, he is going to\nspend the day and night there.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of it?\"\n\n\"He has invited me to dine there.\"\n\n\"There's a life for you,\" said Caderousse; \"a town house and a country\nhouse.\"\n\n\"That is what it is to be rich.\"\n\n\"And shall you dine there?\"\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\"When you dine there, do you sleep there?\"\n\n\"If I like; I am at home there.\" Caderousse looked at the young man, as\nif to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart. But Andrea drew\na cigar-case from his pocket, took a Havana, quietly lit it, and began\nsmoking. \"When do you want your twelve hundred francs?\" said he to\nCaderousse.\n\n\"Now, if you have them.\" Andrea took five and twenty louis from his\npocket.\n\n\"Yellow boys?\" said Caderousse; \"no, I thank you.\"\n\n\"Oh, you despise them.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I esteem them, but will not have them.\"\n\n\"You can change them, idiot; gold is worth five sous.\"\n\n\"Exactly; and he who changes them will follow friend Caderousse, lay\nhands on him, and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold. No\nnonsense, my good fellow; silver simply, round coins with the head of\nsome monarch or other on them. Anybody may possess a five-franc piece.\"\n\n\"But do you suppose I carry five hundred francs about with me? I should\nwant a porter.\"\n\n\"Well, leave them with your porter; he is to be trusted. I will call for\nthem.\"\n\n\"To-day?\"\n\n\"No, to-morrow; I shall not have time to day.\"\n\n\"Well, to-morrow I will leave them when I go to Auteuil.\"\n\n\"May I depend on it?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Because I shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it.\"\n\n\"Now see here, will that be all? Eh? And will you not torment me any\nmore?\"\n\n\"Never.\" Caderousse had become so gloomy that Andrea feared he should be\nobliged to notice the change. He redoubled his gayety and carelessness.\n\"How sprightly you are,\" said Caderousse; \"One would say you were\nalready in possession of your property.\"\n\n\"No, unfortunately; but when I do obtain it\"--\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I shall remember old friends, I can tell you that.\"\n\n\"Yes, since you have such a good memory.\"\n\n\"What do you want? It looks as if you were trying to fleece me?\"\n\n\"I? What an idea! I, who am going to give you another piece of good\nadvice.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"To leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger. We shall both\nget into trouble. You will ruin both yourself and me by your folly.\"\n\n\"How so?\" said Andrea.\n\n\"How? You put on a livery, you disguise yourself as a servant, and yet\nkeep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs.\"\n\n\"You guess well.\"\n\n\"I know something of diamonds; I have had some.\"\n\n\"You do well to boast of it,\" said Andrea, who, without becoming angry,\nas Caderousse feared, at this new extortion, quietly resigned the ring.\nCaderousse looked so closely at it that Andrea well knew that he was\nexamining to see if all the edges were perfect.\n\n\"It is a false diamond,\" said Caderousse.\n\n\"You are joking now,\" replied Andrea.\n\n\"Do not be angry, we can try it.\" Caderousse went to the window, touched\nthe glass with it, and found it would cut.\n\n\"Confiteor,\" said Caderousse, putting the diamond on his little finger;\n\"I was mistaken; but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it\nis no longer worth while to rob a jeweller's shop--it is another branch\nof industry paralyzed.\"\n\n\"Have you finished?\" said Andrea,--\"do you want anything more?--will you\nhave my waistcoat or my hat? Make free, now you have begun.\"\n\n\"No; you are, after all, a good companion; I will not detain you, and\nwill try to cure myself of my ambition.\"\n\n\"But take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the\ndiamond you feared with the gold.\"\n\n\"I shall not sell it--do not fear.\"\n\n\"Not at least till the day after to-morrow,\" thought the young man.\n\n\"Happy rogue,\" said Caderousse; \"you are going to find your servants,\nyour horses, your carriage, and your betrothed!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Andrea.\n\n\"Well, I hope you will make a handsome wedding-present the day you marry\nMademoiselle Danglars.\"\n\n\"I have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head.\"\n\n\"What fortune has she?\"\n\n\"But I tell you\"--\n\n\"A million?\" Andrea shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Let it be a million,\" said Caderousse; \"you can never have so much as I\nwish you.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the young man.\n\n\"Oh, I wish it you with all my heart!\" added Caderousse with his hoarse\nlaugh. \"Stop, let me show you the way.\"\n\n\"It is not worth while.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because there is a little secret, a precaution I thought it desirable\nto take, one of Huret & Fitchet's locks, revised and improved by\nGaspard Caderousse; I will manufacture you a similar one when you are a\ncapitalist.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Andrea; \"I will let you know a week beforehand.\" They\nparted. Caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen\nAndrea go down the three stories, but also cross the court. Then he\nreturned hastily, shut his door carefully, and began to study, like a\nclever architect, the plan Andrea had left him.\n\n\"Dear Benedetto,\" said he, \"I think he will not be sorry to inherit his\nfortune, and he who hastens the day when he can touch his five hundred\nthousand will not be his worst friend.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 82. The Burglary.\n\nThe day following that on which the conversation we have related took\nplace, the Count of Monte Cristo set out for Auteuil, accompanied by\nAli and several attendants, and also taking with him some horses whose\nqualities he was desirous of ascertaining. He was induced to undertake\nthis journey, of which the day before he had not even thought and which\nhad not occurred to Andrea either, by the arrival of Bertuccio from\nNormandy with intelligence respecting the house and sloop. The house was\nready, and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a\nsmall creek with her crew of six men, who had observed all the requisite\nformalities and were ready again to put to sea.\n\nThe count praised Bertuccio's zeal, and ordered him to prepare for a\nspeedy departure, as his stay in France would not be prolonged more than\na month. \"Now,\" said he, \"I may require to go in one night from Paris to\nTreport; let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road, which will\nenable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours.\"\n\n\"Your highness had already expressed that wish,\" said Bertuccio, \"and\nthe horses are ready. I have bought them, and stationed them myself at\nthe most desirable posts, that is, in villages, where no one generally\nstops.\"\n\n\"That's well,\" said Monte Cristo; \"I remain here a day or two--arrange\naccordingly.\" As Bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite\norders, Baptistin opened the door: he held a letter on a silver waiter.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked the count, seeing him covered with\ndust; \"I did not send for you, I think?\"\n\nBaptistin, without answering, approached the count, and presented the\nletter. \"Important and urgent,\" said he. The count opened the letter,\nand read:--\n\n\"M. de Monte Cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his\nhouse in the Champs-Elysees with the intention of carrying off some\npapers supposed to be in the secretary in the dressing-room. The count's\nwell-known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police, whose\ninterference might seriously affect him who sends this advice. The\ncount, by any opening from the bedroom, or by concealing himself in\nthe dressing-room, would be able to defend his property himself. Many\nattendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from\nthe attempt, and M. de Monte Cristo would lose the opportunity of\ndiscovering an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this\nwarning to the count,--a warning he might not be able to send another\ntime, if this first attempt should fail and another be made.\"\n\nThe count's first idea was that this was an artifice--a gross deception,\nto draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose him to a\ngreater. He was on the point of sending the letter to the commissary of\npolice, notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend, or perhaps\nbecause of that advice, when suddenly the idea occurred to him that it\nmight be some personal enemy, whom he alone should recognize and over\nwhom, if such were the case, he alone would gain any advantage, as\nFiesco [*] had done over the Moor who would have killed him. We know the\nCount's vigorous and daring mind, denying anything to be impossible,\nwith that energy which marks the great man. From his past life, from\nhis resolution to shrink from nothing, the count had acquired an\ninconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged, sometimes\nagainst nature, that is to say, against God, and sometimes against the\nworld, that is, against the devil.\n\n     * The Genoese conspirator.\n\n\"They do not want my papers,\" said Monte Cristo, \"they want to kill\nme; they are no robbers, but assassins. I will not allow the prefect of\npolice to interfere with my private affairs. I am rich enough, forsooth,\nto distribute his authority on this occasion.\" The count recalled\nBaptistin, who had left the room after delivering the letter. \"Return to\nParis,\" said he; \"assemble the servants who remain there. I want all my\nhousehold at Auteuil.\"\n\n\"But will no one remain in the house, my lord?\" asked Baptistin.\n\n\"Yes, the porter.\"\n\n\"My lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the house.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"The house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise.\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"By thieves.\"\n\n\"You are a fool, M. Baptistin. Thieves might strip the house--it would\nannoy me less than to be disobeyed.\" Baptistin bowed.\n\n\"You understand me?\" said the count. \"Bring your comrades here, one and\nall; but let everything remain as usual, only close the shutters of the\nground floor.\"\n\n\"And those of the second floor?\"\n\n\"You know they are never closed. Go!\"\n\nThe count signified his intention of dining alone, and that no one but\nAli should attend him. Having dined with his usual tranquillity and\nmoderation, the count, making a signal to Ali to follow him, went out\nby the side-gate and on reaching the Bois de Boulogne turned, apparently\nwithout design towards Paris and at twilight; found himself opposite his\nhouse in the Champs-Elysees. All was dark; one solitary, feeble light\nwas burning in the porter's lodge, about forty paces distant from the\nhouse, as Baptistin had said. Monte Cristo leaned against a tree, and\nwith that scrutinizing glance which was so rarely deceived, looked up\nand down the avenue, examined the passers-by, and carefully looked down\nthe neighboring streets, to see that no one was concealed. Ten minutes\npassed thus, and he was convinced that no one was watching him. He\nhastened to the side-door with Ali, entered hurriedly, and by the\nservants' staircase, of which he had the key, gained his bedroom without\nopening or disarranging a single curtain, without even the porter\nhaving the slightest suspicion that the house, which he supposed empty,\ncontained its chief occupant.\n\nArrived in his bedroom, the count motioned to Ali to stop; then he\npassed into the dressing-room, which he examined. Everything appeared\nas usual--the precious secretary in its place, and the key in the\nsecretary. He double locked it, took the key, returned to the bedroom\ndoor, removed the double staple of the bolt, and went in. Meanwhile Ali\nhad procured the arms the count required--namely, a short carbine and\na pair of double-barrelled pistols, with which as sure an aim might be\ntaken as with a single-barrelled one. Thus armed, the count held the\nlives of five men in his hands. It was about half-past nine. The count\nand Ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of Spanish wine;\nthen Monte Cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels, which enabled\nhim to see into the adjoining room. He had within his reach his pistols\nand carbine, and Ali, standing near him, held one of the small Arabian\nhatchets, whose form has not varied since the Crusades. Through one of\nthe windows of the bedroom, on a line with that in the dressing-room,\nthe count could see into the street.\n\nTwo hours passed thus. It was intensely dark; still Ali, thanks to his\nwild nature, and the count, thanks doubtless to his long confinement,\ncould distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees.\nThe little light in the lodge had long been extinct. It might be\nexpected that the attack, if indeed an attack was projected, would be\nmade from the staircase of the ground floor, and not from a window; in\nMonte Cristo's opinion, the villains sought his life, not his money. It\nwould be his bedroom they would attack, and they must reach it by the\nback staircase, or by the window in the dressing-room. The clock of\nthe Invalides struck a quarter to twelve; the west wind bore on its\nmoistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes.\n\nAs the last stroke died away, the count thought he heard a slight noise\nin the dressing-room; this first sound, or rather this first grinding,\nwas followed by a second, then a third; at the fourth, the count knew\nwhat to expect. A firm and well-practised hand was engaged in cutting\nthe four sides of a pane of glass with a diamond. The count felt his\nheart beat more rapidly. Inured as men may be to danger, forewarned as\nthey may be of peril, they understand, by the fluttering of the heart\nand the shuddering of the frame, the enormous difference between a dream\nand a reality, between the project and the execution. However, Monte\nCristo only made a sign to apprise Ali, who, understanding that danger\nwas approaching from the other side, drew nearer to his master. Monte\nCristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies.\n\nThe window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which\nthe count could see into the dressing-room. He fixed his eyes on that\nwindow--he distinguished a shadow in the darkness; then one of the panes\nbecame quite opaque, as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the outside,\nthen the square cracked without falling. Through the opening an arm was\npassed to find the fastening, then a second; the window turned on its\nhinges, and a man entered. He was alone.\n\n\"That's a daring rascal,\" whispered the count.\n\nAt that moment Ali touched him slightly on the shoulder. He turned; Ali\npointed to the window of the room in which they were, facing the street.\n\"I see!\" said he, \"there are two of them; one does the work while the\nother stands guard.\" He made a sign to Ali not to lose sight of the man\nin the street, and turned to the one in the dressing-room.\n\nThe glass-cutter had entered, and was feeling his way, his arms\nstretched out before him. At last he appeared to have made himself\nfamiliar with his surroundings. There were two doors; he bolted them\nboth.\n\nWhen he drew near to the bedroom door, Monte Cristo expected that he was\ncoming in, and raised one of his pistols; but he simply heard the sound\nof the bolts sliding in their copper rings. It was only a precaution.\nThe nocturnal visitor, ignorant of the fact that the count had removed\nthe staples, might now think himself at home, and pursue his purpose\nwith full security. Alone and free to act as he wished, the man then\ndrew from his pocket something which the count could not discern, placed\nit on a stand, then went straight to the secretary, felt the lock, and\ncontrary to his expectation found that the key was missing. But the\nglass-cutter was a prudent man who had provided for all emergencies. The\ncount soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys, such as the\nlocksmith brings when called to force a lock, and which thieves call\nnightingales, doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they\ngrind against the bolt. \"Ah, ha,\" whispered Monte Cristo with a smile of\ndisappointment, \"he is only a thief.\"\n\nBut the man in the dark could not find the right key. He reached the\ninstrument he had placed on the stand, touched a spring, and immediately\na pale light, just bright enough to render objects distinct, was\nreflected on his hands and countenance. \"By heavens,\" exclaimed Monte\nCristo, starting back, \"it is\"--\n\nAli raised his hatchet. \"Don't stir,\" whispered Monte Cristo, \"and put\ndown your hatchet; we shall require no arms.\" Then he added some words\nin a low tone, for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the\ncount, faint as it had been, had startled the man who remained in the\npose of the old knife-grinder. It was an order the count had just given,\nfor immediately Ali went noiselessly, and returned, bearing a black\ndress and a three-cornered hat. Meanwhile Monte Cristo had rapidly taken\noff his great-coat, waistcoat, and shirt, and one might distinguish by\nthe glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of\nsteel mail, of which the last in France, where daggers are no longer\ndreaded, was worn by King Louis XVI., who feared the dagger at his\nbreast, and whose head was cleft with a hatchet. The tunic soon\ndisappeared under a long cassock, as did his hair under a priest's wig;\nthe three-cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count into\nan abbe.\n\nThe man, hearing nothing more, stood erect, and while Monte Cristo was\ncompleting his disguise had advanced straight to the secretary, whose\nlock was beginning to crack under his nightingale.\n\n\"Try again,\" whispered the count, who depended on the secret spring,\nwhich was unknown to the picklock, clever as he might be--\"try again,\nyou have a few minutes' work there.\" And he advanced to the window.\nThe man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down, and was still\npacing the street; but, strange as it appeared, he cared not for those\nwho might pass from the avenue of the Champs-Elysees or by the Faubourg\nSt. Honore; his attention was engrossed with what was passing at the\ncount's, and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in\nthe dressing-room.\n\nMonte Cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile\npassed over his lips; then drawing near to Ali, he whispered,--\n\n\"Remain here, concealed in the dark, and whatever noise you hear,\nwhatever passes, only come in or show yourself if I call you.\" Ali bowed\nin token of strict obedience. Monte Cristo then drew a lighted taper\nfrom a closet, and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock,\nsilently opened the door, taking care that the light should shine\ndirectly on his face. The door opened so quietly that the thief heard no\nsound; but, to his astonishment, the room was suddenly illuminated. He\nturned.\n\n\"Ah, good-evening, my dear M. Caderousse,\" said Monte Cristo; \"what are\nyou doing here, at such an hour?\"\n\n\"The Abbe Busoni!\" exclaimed Caderousse; and, not knowing how this\nstrange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors, he\nlet fall his bunch of keys, and remained motionless and stupefied. The\ncount placed himself between Caderousse and the window, thus cutting off\nfrom the thief his only chance of retreat. \"The Abbe Busoni!\" repeated\nCaderousse, fixing his haggard gaze on the count.\n\n\"Yes, undoubtedly, the Abbe Busoni himself,\" replied Monte Cristo. \"And\nI am very glad you recognize me, dear M. Caderousse; it proves you have\na good memory, for it must be about ten years since we last met.\" This\ncalmness of Busoni, combined with his irony and boldness, staggered\nCaderousse.\n\n\"The abbe, the abbe!\" murmured he, clinching his fists, and his teeth\nchattering.\n\n\"So you would rob the Count of Monte Cristo?\" continued the false abbe.\n\n\"Reverend sir,\" murmured Caderousse, seeking to regain the window, which\nthe count pitilessly blocked--\"reverend sir, I don't know--believe me--I\ntake my oath\"--\n\n\"A pane of glass out,\" continued the count, \"a dark lantern, a bunch of\nfalse keys, a secretary half forced--it is tolerably evident\"--\n\nCaderousse was choking; he looked around for some corner to hide in,\nsome way of escape.\n\n\"Come, come,\" continued the count, \"I see you are still the same,--an\nassassin.\"\n\n\"Reverend sir, since you know everything, you know it was not I--it was\nLa Carconte; that was proved at the trial, since I was only condemned to\nthe galleys.\"\n\n\"Is your time, then, expired, since I find you in a fair way to return\nthere?\"\n\n\"No, reverend sir; I have been liberated by some one.\"\n\n\"That some one has done society a great kindness.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Caderousse, \"I had promised\"--\n\n\"And you are breaking your promise!\" interrupted Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Alas, yes!\" said Caderousse very uneasily.\n\n\"A bad relapse, that will lead you, if I mistake not, to the Place de\nGreve. So much the worse, so much the worse--diavolo, as they say in my\ncountry.\"\n\n\"Reverend sir, I am impelled\"--\n\n\"Every criminal says the same thing.\"\n\n\"Poverty\"--\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said Busoni disdainfully; \"poverty may make a man beg, steal a\nloaf of bread at a baker's door, but not cause him to open a secretary\nin a house supposed to be inhabited. And when the jeweller Johannes had\njust paid you 40,000. francs for the diamond I had given you, and\nyou killed him to get the diamond and the money both, was that also\npoverty?\"\n\n\"Pardon, reverend sir,\" said Caderousse; \"you have saved my life once,\nsave me again!\"\n\n\"That is but poor encouragement.\"\n\n\"Are you alone, reverend sir, or have you there soldiers ready to seize\nme?\"\n\n\"I am alone,\" said the abbe, \"and I will again have pity on you, and\nwill let you escape, at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may\nlead to, if you tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"Ah, reverend sir,\" cried Caderousse, clasping his hands, and drawing\nnearer to Monte Cristo, \"I may indeed say you are my deliverer!\"\n\n\"You mean to say you have been freed from confinement?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is true, reverend sir.\"\n\n\"Who was your liberator?\"\n\n\"An Englishman.\"\n\n\"What was his name?\"\n\n\"Lord Wilmore.\"\n\n\"I know him; I shall know if you lie.\"\n\n\"Ah, reverend sir, I tell you the simple truth.\"\n\n\"Was this Englishman protecting you?\"\n\n\"No, not me, but a young Corsican, my companion.\"\n\n\"What was this young Corsican's name?\"\n\n\"Benedetto.\"\n\n\"Is that his Christian name?\"\n\n\"He had no other; he was a foundling.\"\n\n\"Then this young man escaped with you?\"\n\n\"He did.\"\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"We were working at St. Mandrier, near Toulon. Do you know St.\nMandrier?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"In the hour of rest, between noon and one o'clock\"--\n\n\"Galley-slaves having a nap after dinner! We may well pity the poor\nfellows!\" said the abbe.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Caderousse, \"one can't always work--one is not a dog.\"\n\n\"So much the better for the dogs,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"While the rest slept, then, we went away a short distance; we severed\nour fetters with a file the Englishman had given us, and swam away.\"\n\n\"And what is become of this Benedetto?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"You ought to know.\"\n\n\"No, in truth; we parted at Hyeres.\" And, to give more weight to his\nprotestation, Caderousse advanced another step towards the abbe, who\nremained motionless in his place, as calm as ever, and pursuing\nhis interrogation. \"You lie,\" said the Abbe Busoni, with a tone of\nirresistible authority.\n\n\"Reverend sir!\"\n\n\"You lie! This man is still your friend, and you, perhaps, make use of\nhim as your accomplice.\"\n\n\"Oh, reverend sir!\"\n\n\"Since you left Toulon what have you lived on? Answer me!\"\n\n\"On what I could get.\"\n\n\"You lie,\" repeated the abbe a third time, with a still more imperative\ntone. Caderousse, terrified, looked at the count. \"You have lived on the\nmoney he has given you.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Caderousse; \"Benedetto has become the son of a great lord.\"\n\n\"How can he be the son of a great lord?\"\n\n\"A natural son.\"\n\n\"And what is that great lord's name?\"\n\n\"The Count of Monte Cristo, the very same in whose house we are.\"\n\n\"Benedetto the count's son?\" replied Monte Cristo, astonished in his\nturn.\n\n\"Well, I should think so, since the count has found him a false\nfather--since the count gives him four thousand francs a month, and\nleaves him 500,000 francs in his will.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said the factitious abbe, who began to understand; \"and what\nname does the young man bear meanwhile?\"\n\n\"Andrea Cavalcanti.\"\n\n\"Is it, then, that young man whom my friend the Count of Monte Cristo\nhas received into his house, and who is going to marry Mademoiselle\nDanglars?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"And you suffer that, you wretch--you, who know his life and his crime?\"\n\n\"Why should I stand in a comrade's way?\" said Caderousse.\n\n\"You are right; it is not you who should apprise M. Danglars, it is I.\"\n\n\"Do not do so, reverend sir.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because you would bring us to ruin.\"\n\n\"And you think that to save such villains as you I will become an\nabettor of their plot, an accomplice in their crimes?\"\n\n\"Reverend sir,\" said Caderousse, drawing still nearer.\n\n\"I will expose all.\"\n\n\"To whom?\"\n\n\"To M. Danglars.\"\n\n\"By heaven!\" cried Caderousse, drawing from his waistcoat an open knife,\nand striking the count in the breast, \"you shall disclose nothing,\nreverend sir!\" To Caderousse's great astonishment, the knife, instead of\npiercing the count's breast, flew back blunted. At the same moment the\ncount seized with his left hand the assassin's wrist, and wrung it\nwith such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers, and\nCaderousse uttered a cry of pain. But the count, disregarding his cry,\ncontinued to wring the bandit's wrist, until, his arm being dislocated,\nhe fell first on his knees, then flat on the floor. The count then\nplaced his foot on his head, saying, \"I know not what restrains me from\ncrushing thy skull, rascal.\"\n\n\"Ah, mercy--mercy!\" cried Caderousse. The count withdrew his foot.\n\"Rise!\" said he. Caderousse rose.\n\n\"What a wrist you have, reverend sir!\" said Caderousse, stroking his\narm, all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it; \"what a\nwrist!\"\n\n\"Silence! God gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you; in\nthe name of that God I act,--remember that, wretch,--and to spare thee\nat this moment is still serving him.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Caderousse, groaning with pain.\n\n\"Take this pen and paper, and write what I dictate.\"\n\n\"I don't know how to write, reverend sir.\"\n\n\"You lie! Take this pen, and write!\" Caderousse, awed by the superior\npower of the abbe, sat down and wrote:--\n\nSir,--The man whom you are receiving at your house, and to whom you\nintend to marry your daughter, is a felon who escaped with me from\nconfinement at Toulon. He was No. 59, and I No. 58. He was called\nBenedetto, but he is ignorant of his real name, having never known his\nparents.\n\n\"Sign it!\" continued the count.\n\n\"But would you ruin me?\"\n\n\"If I sought your ruin, fool, I should drag you to the first\nguard-house; besides, when that note is delivered, in all probability\nyou will have no more to fear. Sign it, then!\"\n\nCaderousse signed it. \"The address, 'To monsieur the Baron Danglars,\nbanker, Rue de la Chaussee d'Antin.'\" Caderousse wrote the address. The\nabbe took the note. \"Now,\" said he, \"that suffices--begone!\"\n\n\"Which way?\"\n\n\"The way you came.\"\n\n\"You wish me to get out at that window?\"\n\n\"You got in very well.\"\n\n\"Oh, you have some design against me, reverend sir.\"\n\n\"Idiot! what design can I have?\"\n\n\"Why, then, not let me out by the door?\"\n\n\"What would be the advantage of waking the porter?\"--\n\n\"Ah, reverend sir, tell me, do you wish me dead?\"\n\n\"I wish what God wills.\"\n\n\"But swear that you will not strike me as I go down.\"\n\n\"Cowardly fool!\"\n\n\"What do you intend doing with me?\"\n\n\"I ask you what can I do? I have tried to make you a happy man, and you\nhave turned out a murderer.\"\n\n\"Oh, monsieur,\" said Caderousse, \"make one more attempt--try me once\nmore!\"\n\n\"I will,\" said the count. \"Listen--you know if I may be relied on.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Caderousse.\n\n\"If you arrive safely at home\"--\n\n\"What have I to fear, except from you?\"\n\n\"If you reach your home safely, leave Paris, leave France, and wherever\nyou may be, so long as you conduct yourself well, I will send you a\nsmall annuity; for, if you return home safely, then\"--\n\n\"Then?\" asked Caderousse, shuddering.\n\n\"Then I shall believe God has forgiven you, and I will forgive you too.\"\n\n\"As true as I am a Christian,\" stammered Caderousse, \"you will make me\ndie of fright!\"\n\n\"Now begone,\" said the count, pointing to the window.\n\nCaderousse, scarcely yet relying on this promise, put his legs out\nof the window and stood on the ladder. \"Now go down,\" said the abbe,\nfolding his arms. Understanding he had nothing more to fear from him,\nCaderousse began to go down. Then the count brought the taper to the\nwindow, that it might be seen in the Champs-Elysees that a man was\ngetting out of the window while another held a light.\n\n\"What are you doing, reverend sir? Suppose a watchman should pass?\" And\nhe blew out the light. He then descended, but it was only when he felt\nhis foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety.\n\nMonte Cristo returned to his bedroom, and, glancing rapidly from the\ngarden to the street, he saw first Caderousse, who after walking to the\nend of the garden, fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part\nfrom where he came in. The count then looking over into the street, saw\nthe man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction, and place\nhimself against the angle of the wall where Caderousse would come over.\nCaderousse climbed the ladder slowly, and looked over the coping to see\nif the street was quiet. No one could be seen or heard. The clock of\nthe Invalides struck one. Then Caderousse sat astride the coping, and\ndrawing up his ladder passed it over the wall; then he began to descend,\nor rather to slide down by the two stanchions, which he did with an ease\nwhich proved how accustomed he was to the exercise. But, once started,\nhe could not stop. In vain did he see a man start from the shadow when\nhe was halfway down--in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the\nground. Before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently\nin the back that he let go the ladder, crying, \"Help!\" A second blow\nstruck him almost immediately in the side, and he fell, calling, \"Help,\nmurder!\" Then, as he rolled on the ground, his adversary seized him by\nthe hair, and struck him a third blow in the chest. This time Caderousse\nendeavored to call again, but he could only utter a groan, and he\nshuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds. The assassin,\nfinding that he no longer cried out, lifted his head up by the hair; his\neyes were closed, and the mouth was distorted. The murderer, supposing\nhim dead, let fall his head and disappeared. Then Caderousse, feeling\nthat he was leaving him, raised himself on his elbow, and with a dying\nvoice cried with great effort, \"Murder! I am dying! Help, reverend\nsir,--help!\"\n\nThis mournful appeal pierced the darkness. The door of the\nback-staircase opened, then the side-gate of the garden, and Ali and his\nmaster were on the spot with lights.\n\n\n\nChapter 83. The Hand of God.\n\nCaderousse continued to call piteously, \"Help, reverend sir, help!\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Help,\" cried Caderousse; \"I am murdered!\"\n\n\"We are here;--take courage.\"\n\n\"Ah, it's all over! You are come too late--you are come to see me die.\nWhat blows, what blood!\" He fainted. Ali and his master conveyed the\nwounded man into a room. Monte Cristo motioned to Ali to undress him,\nand he then examined his dreadful wounds. \"My God!\" he exclaimed, \"thy\nvengeance is sometimes delayed, but only that it may fall the more\neffectually.\" Ali looked at his master for further instructions. \"Bring\nhere immediately the king's attorney, M. de Villefort, who lives in the\nFaubourg St. Honore. As you pass the lodge, wake the porter, and send\nhim for a surgeon.\" Ali obeyed, leaving the abbe alone with Caderousse,\nwho had not yet revived.\n\nWhen the wretched man again opened his eyes, the count looked at him\nwith a mournful expression of pity, and his lips moved as if in prayer.\n\"A surgeon, reverend sir--a surgeon!\" said Caderousse.\n\n\"I have sent for one,\" replied the abbe.\n\n\"I know he cannot save my life, but he may strengthen me to give my\nevidence.\"\n\n\"Against whom?\"\n\n\"Against my murderer.\"\n\n\"Did you recognize him?\"\n\n\"Yes; it was Benedetto.\"\n\n\"The young Corsican?\"\n\n\"Himself.\"\n\n\"Your comrade?\"\n\n\"Yes. After giving me the plan of this house, doubtless hoping I should\nkill the count and he thus become his heir, or that the count would kill\nme and I should be out of his way, he waylaid me, and has murdered me.\"\n\n\"I have also sent for the procureur.\"\n\n\"He will not come in time; I feel my life fast ebbing.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" said Monte Cristo. He left the room, and returned\nin five minutes with a phial. The dying man's eyes were all the time\nriveted on the door, through which he hoped succor would arrive.\n\"Hasten, reverend sir, hasten! I shall faint again!\" Monte Cristo\napproached, and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the\ncontents of the phial. Caderousse drew a deep breath. \"Oh,\" said he,\n\"that is life to me; more, more!\"\n\n\"Two drops more would kill you,\" replied the abbe.\n\n\"Oh, send for some one to whom I can denounce the wretch!\"\n\n\"Shall I write your deposition? You can sign it.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Caderousse; and his eyes glistened at the thought of\nthis posthumous revenge. Monte Cristo wrote:--\n\n\"I die, murdered by the Corsican Benedetto, my comrade in the galleys at\nToulouse, No. 59.\"\n\n\"Quick, quick!\" said Caderousse, \"or I shall be unable to sign it.\"\n\nMonte Cristo gave the pen to Caderousse, who collected all his strength,\nsigned it, and fell back on his bed, saying: \"You will relate all the\nrest, reverend sir; you will say he calls himself Andrea Cavalcanti. He\nlodges at the Hotel des Princes. Oh, I am dying!\" He again fainted. The\nabbe made him smell the contents of the phial, and he again opened his\neyes. His desire for revenge had not forsaken him.\n\n\"Ah, you will tell all I have said, will you not, reverend sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, and much more.\"\n\n\"What more will you say?\"\n\n\"I will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house, in the\nhope the count would kill you. I will say, likewise, he had apprised the\ncount, by a note, of your intention, and, the count being absent, I read\nthe note and sat up to await you.\"\n\n\"And he will be guillotined, will be not?\" said Caderousse. \"Promise me\nthat, and I will die with that hope.\"\n\n\"I will say,\" continued the count, \"that he followed and watched you the\nwhole time, and when he saw you leave the house, ran to the angle of the\nwall to conceal himself.\"\n\n\"Did you see all that?\"\n\n\"Remember my words: 'If you return home safely, I shall believe God has\nforgiven you, and I will forgive you also.'\"\n\n\"And you did not warn me!\" cried Caderousse, raising himself on his\nelbows. \"You knew I should be killed on leaving this house, and did not\nwarn me!\"\n\n\"No; for I saw God's justice placed in the hands of Benedetto, and\nshould have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence.\"\n\n\"God's justice! Speak not of it, reverend sir. If God were just, you\nknow how many would be punished who now escape.\"\n\n\"Patience,\" said the abbe, in a tone which made the dying man shudder;\n\"have patience!\" Caderousse looked at him with amazement. \"Besides,\"\nsaid the abbe, \"God is merciful to all, as he has been to you; he is\nfirst a father, then a judge.\"\n\n\"Do you then believe in God?\" said Caderousse.\n\n\"Had I been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now,\" said Monte\nCristo, \"I must believe on seeing you.\" Caderousse raised his clinched\nhands towards heaven.\n\n\"Listen,\" said the abbe, extending his hand over the wounded man, as\nif to command him to believe; \"this is what the God in whom, on your\ndeath-bed, you refuse to believe, has done for you--he gave you health,\nstrength, regular employment, even friends--a life, in fact, which a man\nmight enjoy with a calm conscience. Instead of improving these gifts,\nrarely granted so abundantly, this has been your course--you have given\nyourself up to sloth and drunkenness, and in a fit of intoxication have\nruined your best friend.\"\n\n\"Help!\" cried Caderousse; \"I require a surgeon, not a priest; perhaps\nI am not mortally wounded--I may not die; perhaps they can yet save my\nlife.\"\n\n\"Your wounds are so far mortal that, without the three drops I gave you,\nyou would now be dead. Listen, then.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" murmured Caderousse, \"what a strange priest you are; you drive the\ndying to despair, instead of consoling them.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" continued the abbe. \"When you had betrayed your friend God\nbegan not to strike, but to warn you. Poverty overtook you. You had\nalready passed half your life in coveting that which you might have\nhonorably acquired; and already you contemplated crime under the excuse\nof want, when God worked a miracle in your behalf, sending you, by my\nhands, a fortune--brilliant, indeed, for you, who had never possessed\nany. But this unexpected, unhoped-for, unheard-of fortune sufficed\nyou no longer when you once possessed it; you wished to double it, and\nhow?--by a murder! You succeeded, and then God snatched it from you, and\nbrought you to justice.\"\n\n\"It was not I who wished to kill the Jew,\" said Caderousse; \"it was La\nCarconte.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Monte Cristo, \"and God,--I cannot say in justice, for his\njustice would have slain you,--but God, in his mercy, spared your life.\"\n\n\"Pardieu, to transport me for life, how merciful!\"\n\n\"You thought it a mercy then, miserable wretch! The coward who feared\ndeath rejoiced at perpetual disgrace; for like all galley-slaves, you\nsaid, 'I may escape from prison, I cannot from the grave.' And you said\ntruly; the way was opened for you unexpectedly. An Englishman visited\nToulon, who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy, and his choice\nfell on you and your companion. You received a second fortune, money and\ntranquillity were restored to you, and you, who had been condemned to a\nfelon's life, might live as other men. Then, wretched creature, then you\ntempted God a third time. 'I have not enough,' you said, when you had\nmore than you before possessed, and you committed a third crime, without\nreason, without excuse. God is wearied; he has punished you.\" Caderousse\nwas fast sinking. \"Give me drink,\" said he: \"I thirst--I burn!\" Monte\nCristo gave him a glass of water. \"And yet that villain, Benedetto, will\nescape!\"\n\n\"No one, I tell you, will escape; Benedetto will be punished.\"\n\n\"Then, you, too, will be punished, for you did not do your duty as a\npriest--you should have prevented Benedetto from killing me.\"\n\n\"I?\" said the count, with a smile which petrified the dying man, \"when\nyou had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected\nmy breast! Yet perhaps if I had found you humble and penitent, I might\nhave prevented Benedetto from killing you; but I found you proud and\nblood-thirsty, and I left you in the hands of God.\"\n\n\"I do not believe there is a God,\" howled Caderousse; \"you do not\nbelieve it; you lie--you lie!\"\n\n\"Silence,\" said the abbe; \"you will force the last drop of blood from\nyour veins. What! you do not believe in God when he is striking you\ndead? you will not believe in him, who requires but a prayer, a word, a\ntear, and he will forgive? God, who might have directed the assassin's\ndagger so as to end your career in a moment, has given you this quarter\nof an hour for repentance. Reflect, then, wretched man, and repent.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Caderousse, \"no; I will not repent. There is no God; there is\nno providence--all comes by chance.\"--\n\n\"There is a providence; there is a God,\" said Monte Cristo, \"of whom you\nare a striking proof, as you lie in utter despair, denying him, while I\nstand before you, rich, happy, safe and entreating that God in whom you\nendeavor not to believe, while in your heart you still believe in him.\"\n\n\"But who are you, then?\" asked Caderousse, fixing his dying eyes on the\ncount. \"Look well at me!\" said Monte Cristo, putting the light near his\nface. \"Well, the abbe--the Abbe Busoni.\" Monte Cristo took off the wig\nwhich disfigured him, and let fall his black hair, which added so\nmuch to the beauty of his pallid features. \"Oh?\" said Caderousse,\nthunderstruck, \"but for that black hair, I should say you were the\nEnglishman, Lord Wilmore.\"\n\n\"I am neither the Abbe Busoni nor Lord Wilmore,\" said Monte Cristo;\n\"think again,--do you not recollect me?\" Those was a magic effect in\nthe count's words, which once more revived the exhausted powers of the\nmiserable man. \"Yes, indeed,\" said he; \"I think I have seen you and\nknown you formerly.\"\n\n\"Yes, Caderousse, you have seen me; you knew me once.\"\n\n\"Who, then, are you? and why, if you knew me, do you let me die?\"\n\n\"Because nothing can save you; your wounds are mortal. Had it been\npossible to save you, I should have considered it another proof of God's\nmercy, and I would again have endeavored to restore you, I swear by my\nfather's tomb.\"\n\n\"By your father's tomb!\" said Caderousse, supported by a supernatural\npower, and half-raising himself to see more distinctly the man who had\njust taken the oath which all men hold sacred; \"who, then, are you?\"\nThe count had watched the approach of death. He knew this was the last\nstruggle. He approached the dying man, and, leaning over him with a calm\nand melancholy look, he whispered, \"I am--I am\"--And his almost closed\nlips uttered a name so low that the count himself appeared afraid to\nhear it. Caderousse, who had raised himself on his knees, and stretched\nout his arm, tried to draw back, then clasping his hands, and raising\nthem with a desperate effort, \"O my God, my God!\" said he, \"pardon me\nfor having denied thee; thou dost exist, thou art indeed man's father\nin heaven, and his judge on earth. My God, my Lord, I have long despised\nthee! Pardon me, my God; receive me, O my Lord!\" Caderousse sighed\ndeeply, and fell back with a groan. The blood no longer flowed from his\nwounds. He was dead.\n\n\"One!\" said the count mysteriously, his eyes fixed on the corpse,\ndisfigured by so awful a death. Ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and\nthe procureur arrived, the one accompanied by the porter, the other by\nAli, and were received by the Abbe Busoni, who was praying by the side\nof the corpse.\n\n\n\nChapter 84. Beauchamp.\n\nThe daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation\nthroughout Paris for the next fortnight. The dying man had signed a\ndeposition declaring Benedetto to be the assassin. The police had orders\nto make the strictest search for the murderer. Caderousse's knife, dark\nlantern, bunch of keys, and clothing, excepting the waistcoat, which\ncould not be found, were deposited at the registry; the corpse was\nconveyed to the morgue. The count told every one that this adventure had\nhappened during his absence at Auteuil, and that he only knew what\nwas related by the Abbe Busoni, who that evening, by mere chance, had\nrequested to pass the night in his house, to examine some valuable books\nin his library. Bertuccio alone turned pale whenever Benedetto's name\nwas mentioned in his presence, but there was no reason why any one\nshould notice his doing so. Villefort, being called on to prove\nthe crime, was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was\naccustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal cases.\n\nBut three weeks had already passed, and the most diligent search had\nbeen unsuccessful; the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber\nby his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching\nmarriage of Mademoiselle Danglars to the Count Andrea Cavalcanti. It was\nexpected that this wedding would shortly take place, as the young\nman was received at the banker's as the betrothed. Letters had been\ndespatched to M. Cavalcanti, as the count's father, who highly approved\nof the union, regretted his inability to leave Parma at that time, and\npromised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres. It\nwas agreed that the three millions should be intrusted to Danglars to\ninvest; some persons had warned the young man of the circumstances of\nhis future father-in-law, who had of late sustained repeated losses; but\nwith sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young man refused\nto listen, or to express a single doubt to the baron. The baron adored\nCount Andrea Cavalcanti: not so Mademoiselle Eugenie Danglars. With an\ninstinctive hatred of matrimony, she suffered Andrea's attentions\nin order to get rid of Morcerf; but when Andrea urged his suit, she\nbetrayed an entire dislike to him. The baron might possibly have\nperceived it, but, attributing it to a caprice, feigned ignorance.\n\nThe delay demanded by Beauchamp had nearly expired. Morcerf appreciated\nthe advice of Monte Cristo to let things die away of their own accord.\nNo one had taken up the remark about the general, and no one had\nrecognized in the officer who betrayed the castle of Yanina the noble\ncount in the House of Peers. Albert, however felt no less insulted; the\nfew lines which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult.\nBesides, the manner in which Beauchamp had closed the conference left a\nbitter recollection in his heart. He cherished the thought of the duel,\nhoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds. Beauchamp had\nnot been seen since the day he visited Albert, and those of whom the\nlatter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would\ndetain him some days. Where he was no one knew.\n\nOne morning Albert was awakened by his valet de chambre, who announced\nBeauchamp. Albert rubbed his eyes, ordered his servant to introduce\nhim into the small smoking-room on the ground-floor, dressed himself\nquickly, and went down. He found Beauchamp pacing the room; on\nperceiving him Beauchamp stopped. \"Your arrival here, without waiting my\nvisit at your house to-day, looks well, sir,\" said Albert. \"Tell me, may\nI shake hands with you, saying, 'Beauchamp, acknowledge you have injured\nme, and retain my friendship,' or must I simply propose to you a choice\nof arms?\"\n\n\"Albert,\" said Beauchamp, with a look of sorrow which stupefied the\nyoung man, \"let us first sit down and talk.\"\n\n\"Rather, sir, before we sit down, I must demand your answer.\"\n\n\"Albert,\" said the journalist, \"these are questions which it is\ndifficult to answer.\"\n\n\"I will facilitate it by repeating the question, 'Will you, or will you\nnot, retract?'\"\n\n\"Morcerf, it is not enough to answer 'yes' or 'no' to questions which\nconcern the honor, the social interest, and the life of such a man as\nLieutenant-general the Count of Morcerf, peer of France.\"\n\n\"What must then be done?\"\n\n\"What I have done, Albert. I reasoned thus--money, time, and fatigue are\nnothing compared with the reputation and interests of a whole family;\nprobabilities will not suffice, only facts will justify a deadly combat\nwith a friend. If I strike with the sword, or discharge the contents\nof a pistol at man with whom, for three years, I have been on terms of\nintimacy, I must, at least, know why I do so; I must meet him with a\nheart at ease, and that quiet conscience which a man needs when his own\narm must save his life.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Morcerf, impatiently, \"what does all this mean?\"\n\n\"It means that I have just returned from Yanina.\"\n\n\"From Yanina?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Here is my passport; examine the visa--Geneva, Milan, Venice, Trieste,\nDelvino, Yanina. Will you believe the government of a republic, a\nkingdom, and an empire?\" Albert cast his eyes on the passport, then\nraised them in astonishment to Beauchamp. \"You have been to Yanina?\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"Albert, had you been a stranger, a foreigner, a simple lord, like that\nEnglishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four months since,\nand whom I killed to get rid of, I should not have taken this trouble;\nbut I thought this mark of consideration due to you. I took a week to\ngo, another to return, four days of quarantine, and forty-eight hours\nto stay there; that makes three weeks. I returned last night, and here I\nam.\"\n\n\"What circumlocution! How long you are before you tell me what I most\nwish to know?\"\n\n\"Because, in truth, Albert\"--\n\n\"You hesitate?\"\n\n\"Yes,--I fear.\"\n\n\"You fear to acknowledge that your correspondent his deceived you? Oh,\nno self-love, Beauchamp. Acknowledge it, Beauchamp; your courage cannot\nbe doubted.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" murmured the journalist; \"on the contrary\"--\n\nAlbert turned frightfully pale; he endeavored to speak, but the words\ndied on his lips. \"My friend,\" said Beauchamp, in the most affectionate\ntone, \"I should gladly make an apology; but, alas,\"--\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"The paragraph was correct, my friend.\"\n\n\"What? That French officer\"--\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Fernand?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The traitor who surrendered the castle of the man in whose service he\nwas\"--\n\n\"Pardon me, my friend, that man was your father!\" Albert advanced\nfuriously towards Beauchamp, but the latter restrained him more by a\nmild look than by his extended hand.\n\n\"My friend,\" said he, \"here is a proof of it.\"\n\nAlbert opened the paper, it was an attestation of four notable\ninhabitants of Yanina, proving that Colonel Fernand Mondego, in the\nservice of Ali Tepelini, had surrendered the castle for two million\ncrowns. The signatures were perfectly legal. Albert tottered and fell\noverpowered in a chair. It could no longer be doubted; the family\nname was fully given. After a moment's mournful silence, his heart\noverflowed, and he gave way to a flood of tears. Beauchamp, who had\nwatched with sincere pity the young man's paroxysm of grief, approached\nhim. \"Now, Albert,\" said he, \"you understand me--do you not? I wished to\nsee all, and to judge of everything for myself, hoping the explanation\nwould be in your father's favor, and that I might do him justice. But,\non the contrary, the particulars which are given prove that Fernand\nMondego, raised by Ali Pasha to the rank of governor-general, is no\nother than Count Fernand of Morcerf; then, recollecting the honor you\nhad done me, in admitting me to your friendship, I hastened to you.\"\n\nAlbert, still extended on the chair, covered his face with both hands,\nas if to prevent the light from reaching him. \"I hastened to you,\"\ncontinued Beauchamp, \"to tell you, Albert, that in this changing age,\nthe faults of a father cannot revert upon his children. Few have passed\nthrough this revolutionary period, in the midst of which we were\nborn, without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the\nsoldier, or the gown of the magistrate. Now I have these proofs, Albert,\nand I am in your confidence, no human power can force me to a duel which\nyour own conscience would reproach you with as criminal, but I come to\noffer you what you can no longer demand of me. Do you wish these proofs,\nthese attestations, which I alone possess, to be destroyed? Do you wish\nthis frightful secret to remain with us? Confided to me, it shall never\nescape my lips; say, Albert, my friend, do you wish it?\"\n\nAlbert threw himself on Beauchamp's neck. \"Ah, noble fellow!\" cried he.\n\n\"Take these,\" said Beauchamp, presenting the papers to Albert.\n\nAlbert seized them with a convulsive hand, tore them in pieces, and\ntrembling lest the least vestige should escape and one day appear to\nconfront him, he approached the wax-light, always kept burning for\ncigars, and burned every fragment. \"Dear, excellent friend,\" murmured\nAlbert, still burning the papers.\n\n\"Let all be forgotten as a sorrowful dream,\" said Beauchamp; \"let it\nvanish as the last sparks from the blackened paper, and disappear as the\nsmoke from those silent ashes.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Albert, \"and may there remain only the eternal\nfriendship which I promised to my deliverer, which shall be transmitted\nto our children's children, and shall always remind me that I owe my\nlife and the honor of my name to you,--for had this been known, oh,\nBeauchamp, I should have destroyed myself; or,--no, my poor mother! I\ncould not have killed her by the same blow,--I should have fled from my\ncountry.\"\n\n\"Dear Albert,\" said Beauchamp. But this sudden and factitious joy soon\nforsook the young man, and was succeeded by a still greater grief.\n\n\"Well,\" said Beauchamp, \"what still oppresses you, my friend?\"\n\n\"I am broken-hearted,\" said Albert. \"Listen, Beauchamp! I cannot thus,\nin a moment relinquish the respect, the confidence, and pride with which\na father's untarnished name inspires a son. Oh, Beauchamp, Beauchamp,\nhow shall I now approach mine? Shall I draw back my forehead from his\nembrace, or withhold my hand from his? I am the most wretched of men.\nAh, my mother, my poor mother!\" said Albert, gazing through his tears at\nhis mother's portrait; \"if you know this, how much must you suffer!\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Beauchamp, taking both his hands, \"take courage, my\nfriend.\"\n\n\"But how came that first note to be inserted in your journal? Some\nunknown enemy--an invisible foe--has done this.\"\n\n\"The more must you fortify yourself, Albert. Let no trace of emotion be\nvisible on your countenance, bear your grief as the cloud bears within\nit ruin and death--a fatal secret, known only when the storm bursts.\nGo, my friend, reserve your strength for the moment when the crash shall\ncome.\"\n\n\"You think, then, all is not over yet?\" said Albert, horror-stricken.\n\n\"I think nothing, my friend; but all things are possible. By the way\"--\n\n\"What?\" said Albert, seeing that Beauchamp hesitated.\n\n\"Are you going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars?\"\n\n\"Why do you ask me now?\"\n\n\"Because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with\nthe person of whom we were speaking.\"\n\n\"How?\" said Albert, whose brow reddened; \"you think M. Danglars\"--\n\n\"I ask you only how your engagement stands? Pray put no construction\non my words I do not mean they should convey, and give them no undue\nweight.\"\n\n\"No.\" said Albert, \"the engagement is broken off.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Beauchamp. Then, seeing the young man was about to relapse\ninto melancholy, \"Let us go out, Albert,\" said he; \"a ride in the wood\nin the phaeton, or on horseback, will refresh you; we will then return\nto breakfast, and you shall attend to your affairs, and I to mine.\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" said Albert; \"but let us walk. I think a little exertion\nwould do me good.\" The two friends walked out on the fortress. When\narrived at the Madeleine,--\"Since we are out,\" said Beauchamp, \"let\nus call on M. de Monte Cristo; he is admirably adapted to revive one's\nspirits, because he never interrogates, and in my opinion those who ask\nno questions are the best comforters.\"\n\n\"Gladly,\" said Albert; \"I love him--let us call.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 85. The Journey.\n\nMonte Cristo uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young men\ntogether. \"Ah, ha!\" said he, \"I hope all is over, explained and\nsettled.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Beauchamp; \"the absurd reports have died away, and should\nthey be renewed, I would be the first to oppose them; so let us speak no\nmore of it.\"\n\n\"Albert will tell you,\" replied the count \"that I gave him the same\nadvice. Look,\" added he. \"I am finishing the most execrable morning's\nwork.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" said Albert; \"arranging your papers, apparently.\"\n\n\"My papers, thank God, no,--my papers are all in capital order, because\nI have none; but M. Cavalcanti's.\"\n\n\"M. Cavalcanti's?\" asked Beauchamp.\n\n\"Yes; do you not know that this is a young man whom the count is\nintroducing?\" said Morcerf.\n\n\"Let us not misunderstand each other,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"I\nintroduce no one, and certainly not M. Cavalcanti.\"\n\n\"And who,\" said Albert with a forced smile, \"is to marry Mademoiselle\nDanglars instead of me, which grieves me cruelly.\"\n\n\"What? Cavalcanti is going to marry Mademoiselle Danglars?\" asked\nBeauchamp.\n\n\"Certainly; do you come from the end of the world?\" said Monte Cristo;\n\"you, a journalist, the husband of renown? It is the talk of all Paris.\"\n\n\"And you, count, have made this match?\" asked Beauchamp.\n\n\"I? Silence, purveyor of gossip, do not spread that report. I make a\nmatch? No, you do not know me; I have done all in my power to oppose\nit.\"\n\n\"Ah, I understand,\" said Beauchamp, \"on our friend Albert's account.\"\n\n\"On my account?\" said the young man; \"oh, no, indeed, the count will do\nme the justice to assert that I have, on the contrary, always entreated\nhim to break off my engagement, and happily it is ended. The count\npretends I have not him to thank;--so be it--I will erect an altar Deo\nignoto.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said Monte Cristo; \"I have had little to do with it, for I am\nat variance both with the father-in-law and the young man; there is only\nMademoiselle Eugenie, who appears but little charmed with the thoughts\nof matrimony, and who, seeing how little I was disposed to persuade her\nto renounce her dear liberty, retains any affection for me.\"\n\n\"And do you say this wedding is at hand?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, in spite of all I could say. I do not know the young man;\nhe is said to be of good family and rich, but I never trust to vague\nassertions. I have warned M. Danglars of it till I am tired, but he\nis fascinated with his Luccanese. I have even informed him of a\ncircumstance I consider very serious; the young man was either charmed\nby his nurse, stolen by gypsies, or lost by his tutor, I scarcely know\nwhich. But I do know his father lost sight of him for more than ten\nyears; what he did during these ten years, God only knows. Well, all\nthat was useless. They have commissioned me to write to the major to\ndemand papers, and here they are. I send them, but like Pilate--washing\nmy hands.\"\n\n\"And what does Mademoiselle d'Armilly say to you for robbing her of her\npupil?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, I don't know; but I understand that she is going to\nItaly. Madame Danglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the\nimpresari; I gave her a few lines for the director of the Valle Theatre,\nwho is under some obligation to me. But what is the matter, Albert? you\nlook dull; are you, after all, unconsciously in love with Mademoiselle\nEugenie?\"\n\n\"I am not aware of it,\" said Albert, smiling sorrowfully. Beauchamp\nturned to look at some paintings. \"But,\" continued Monte Cristo, \"you\nare not in your usual spirits?\"\n\n\"I have a dreadful headache,\" said Albert.\n\n\"Well, my dear viscount,\" said Monte Cristo, \"I have an infallible\nremedy to propose to you.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked the young man.\n\n\"A change.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Albert.\n\n\"Yes; and as I am just now excessively annoyed, I shall go from home.\nShall we go together?\"\n\n\"You annoyed, count?\" said Beauchamp; \"and by what?\"\n\n\"Ah, you think very lightly of it; I should like to see you with a brief\npreparing in your house.\"\n\n\"What brief?\"\n\n\"The one M. de Villefort is preparing against my amiable assassin--some\nbrigand escaped from the gallows apparently.\"\n\n\"True,\" said Beauchamp; \"I saw it in the paper. Who is this Caderousse?\"\n\n\"Some provincial, it appears. M. de Villefort heard of him at\nMarseilles, and M. Danglars recollects having seen him. Consequently,\nthe procureur is very active in the affair, and the prefect of police\nvery much interested; and, thanks to that interest, for which I am very\ngrateful, they send me all the robbers of Paris and the neighborhood,\nunder pretence of their being Caderousse's murderers, so that in three\nmonths, if this continues, every robber and assassin in France will have\nthe plan of my house at his fingers' end. I am resolved to desert them\nand go to some remote corner of the earth, and shall be happy if you\nwill accompany me, viscount.\"\n\n\"Willingly.\"\n\n\"Then it is settled?\"\n\n\"Yes, but where?\"\n\n\"I have told you, where the air is pure, where every sound soothes,\nwhere one is sure to be humbled, however proud may be his nature. I love\nthat humiliation, I, who am master of the universe, as was Augustus.\"\n\n\"But where are you really going?\"\n\n\"To sea, viscount; you know I am a sailor. I was rocked when an infant\nin the arms of old ocean, and on the bosom of the beautiful Amphitrite;\nI have sported with the green mantle of the one and the azure robe of\nthe other; I love the sea as a mistress, and pine if I do not often see\nher.\"\n\n\"Let us go, count.\"\n\n\"To sea?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You accept my proposal?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Well, Viscount, there will be in my court-yard this evening a good\ntravelling britzka, with four post-horses, in which one may rest as in a\nbed. M. Beauchamp, it holds four very well, will you accompany us?\"\n\n\"Thank you, I have just returned from sea.\"\n\n\"What? you have been to sea?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have just made a little excursion to the Borromean Islands.\" [*]\n\n     * Lake Maggiore.\n\n\"What of that? come with us,\" said Albert.\n\n\"No, dear Morcerf; you know I only refuse when the thing is impossible.\nBesides, it is important,\" added he in a low tone, \"that I should remain\nin Paris just now to watch the paper.\"\n\n\"Ah, you are a good and an excellent friend,\" said Albert; \"yes, you are\nright; watch, watch, Beauchamp, and try to discover the enemy who made\nthis disclosure.\" Albert and Beauchamp parted, the last pressure of\ntheir hands expressing what their tongues could not before a stranger.\n\n\"Beauchamp is a worthy fellow,\" said Monte Cristo, when the journalist\nwas gone; \"is he not, Albert?\"\n\n\"Yes, and a sincere friend; I love him devotedly. But now we are\nalone,--although it is immaterial to me,--where are we going?\"\n\n\"Into Normandy, if you like.\"\n\n\"Delightful; shall we be quite retired? have no society, no neighbors?\"\n\n\"Our companions will be riding-horses, dogs to hunt with, and a\nfishing-boat.\"\n\n\"Exactly what I wish for; I will apprise my mother of my intention, and\nreturn to you.\"\n\n\"But shall you be allowed to go into Normandy?\"\n\n\"I may go where I please.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am aware you may go alone, since I once met you in Italy--but to\naccompany the mysterious Monte Cristo?\"\n\n\"You forget, count, that I have often told you of the deep interest my\nmother takes in you.\"\n\n\"'Woman is fickle.' said Francis I.; 'woman is like a wave of the sea,'\nsaid Shakespeare; both the great king and the great poet ought to have\nknown woman's nature well.\"\n\n\"Woman's, yes; my mother is not woman, but a woman.\"\n\n\"As I am only a humble foreigner, you must pardon me if I do not\nunderstand all the subtle refinements of your language.\"\n\n\"What I mean to say is, that my mother is not quick to give her\nconfidence, but when she does she never changes.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, indeed,\" said Monte Cristo with a sigh; \"and do you think she\nis in the least interested in me?\"\n\n\"I repeat it, you must really be a very strange and superior man, for my\nmother is so absorbed by the interest you have excited, that when I am\nwith her she speaks of no one else.\"\n\n\"And does she try to make you dislike me?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, she often says, 'Morcerf, I believe the count has a\nnoble nature; try to gain his esteem.'\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Monte Cristo, sighing.\n\n\"You see, then,\" said Albert, \"that instead of opposing, she will\nencourage me.\"\n\n\"Adieu, then, until five o'clock; be punctual, and we shall arrive at\ntwelve or one.\"\n\n\"At Treport?\"\n\n\"Yes; or in the neighborhood.\"\n\n\"But can we travel forty-eight leagues in eight hours?\"\n\n\"Easily,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"You are certainly a prodigy; you will soon not only surpass the\nrailway, which would not be very difficult in France, but even the\ntelegraph.\"\n\n\"But, viscount, since we cannot perform the journey in less than seven\nor eight hours, do not keep me waiting.\"\n\n\"Do not fear, I have little to prepare.\" Monte Cristo smiled as he\nnodded to Albert, then remained a moment absorbed in deep meditation.\nBut passing his hand across his forehead as if to dispel his revery,\nhe rang the bell twice and Bertuccio entered. \"Bertuccio,\" said he, \"I\nintend going this evening to Normandy, instead of to-morrow or the\nnext day. You will have sufficient time before five o'clock; despatch a\nmessenger to apprise the grooms at the first station. M. de Morcerf will\naccompany me.\" Bertuccio obeyed and despatched a courier to Pontoise to\nsay the travelling-carriage would arrive at six o'clock. From Pontoise\nanother express was sent to the next stage, and in six hours all the\nhorses stationed on the road were ready. Before his departure, the\ncount went to Haidee's apartments, told her his intention, and resigned\neverything to her care. Albert was punctual. The journey soon became\ninteresting from its rapidity, of which Morcerf had formed no previous\nidea. \"Truly,\" said Monte Cristo, \"with your posthorses going at the\nrate of two leagues an hour, and that absurd law that one traveller\nshall not pass another without permission, so that an invalid or\nill-tempered traveller may detain those who are well and active, it is\nimpossible to move; I escape this annoyance by travelling with my own\npostilion and horses; do I not, Ali?\"\n\nThe count put his head out of the window and whistled, and the horses\nappeared to fly. The carriage rolled with a thundering noise over the\npavement, and every one turned to notice the dazzling meteor. Ali,\nsmiling, repeated the sound, grasped the reins with a firm hand, and\nspurred his horses, whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze. This\nchild of the desert was in his element, and with his black face and\nsparkling eyes appeared, in the cloud of dust he raised, like the genius\nof the simoom and the god of the hurricane. \"I never knew till now the\ndelight of speed,\" said Morcerf, and the last cloud disappeared from\nhis brow; \"but where the devil do you get such horses? Are they made to\norder?\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" said the count; \"six years since I bought a horse in\nHungary remarkable for its swiftness. The thirty-two that we shall\nuse to-night are its progeny; they are all entirely black, with the\nexception of a star upon the forehead.\"\n\n\"That is perfectly admirable; but what do you do, count, with all these\nhorses?\"\n\n\"You see, I travel with them.\"\n\n\"But you are not always travelling.\"\n\n\"When I no longer require them, Bertuccio will sell them, and he expects\nto realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale.\"\n\n\"But no monarch in Europe will be wealthy enough to purchase them.\"\n\n\"Then he will sell them to some Eastern vizier, who will empty his\ncoffers to purchase them, and refill them by applying the bastinado to\nhis subjects.\"\n\n\"Count, may I suggest one idea to you?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"It is that, next to you, Bertuccio must be the richest gentleman in\nEurope.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, viscount; I believe he has not a franc in his\npossession.\"\n\n\"Then he must be a wonder. My dear count, if you tell me many more\nmarvellous things, I warn you I shall not believe them.\"\n\n\"I countenance nothing that is marvellous, M. Albert. Tell me, why does\na steward rob his master?\"\n\n\"Because, I suppose, it is his nature to do so, for the love of\nrobbing.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken; it is because he has a wife and family, and ambitious\ndesires for himself and them. Also because he is not sure of always\nretaining his situation, and wishes to provide for the future. Now, M.\nBertuccio is alone in the world; he uses my property without accounting\nfor the use he makes of it; he is sure never to leave my service.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I should never get a better.\"\n\n\"Probabilities are deceptive.\"\n\n\"But I deal in certainties; he is the best servant over whom one has the\npower of life and death.\"\n\n\"Do you possess that right over Bertuccio?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThere are words which close a conversation with an iron door; such was\nthe count's \"yes.\" The whole journey was performed with equal rapidity;\nthe thirty-two horses, dispersed over seven stages, brought them to\ntheir destination in eight hours. At midnight they arrived at the gate\nof a beautiful park. The porter was in attendance; he had been apprised\nby the groom of the last stage of the count's approach. At half past two\nin the morning Morcerf was conducted to his apartments, where a bath and\nsupper were prepared. The servant who had travelled at the back of\nthe carriage waited on him; Baptistin, who rode in front, attended the\ncount. Albert bathed, took his supper, and went to bed. All night he was\nlulled by the melancholy noise of the surf. On rising, he went to his\nwindow, which opened on a terrace, having the sea in front, and at the\nback a pretty park bounded by a small forest. In a creek lay a little\nsloop, with a narrow keel and high masts, bearing on its flag the Monte\nCristo arms which were a mountain on a sea azure, with a cross gules\non the shield. Around the schooner lay a number of small fishing-boats\nbelonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village, like humble\nsubjects awaiting orders from their queen. There, as in every spot where\nMonte Cristo stopped, if but for two days, luxury abounded and life went\non with the utmost ease.\n\nAlbert found in his anteroom two guns, with all the accoutrements for\nhunting; a lofty room on the ground-floor containing all the ingenious\ninstruments the English--eminent in piscatory pursuits, since they\nare patient and sluggish--have invented for fishing. The day passed in\npursuing those exercises in which Monte Cristo excelled. They killed\na dozen pheasants in the park, as many trout in the stream, dined in a\nsummer-house overlooking the ocean, and took tea in the library.\n\nTowards the evening of the third day. Albert, completely exhausted\nwith the exercise which invigorated Monte Cristo, was sleeping in\nan arm-chair near the window, while the count was designing with his\narchitect the plan of a conservatory in his house, when the sound of\na horse at full speed on the high road made Albert look up. He was\ndisagreeably surprised to see his own valet de chambre, whom he had not\nbrought, that he might not inconvenience Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Florentin here!\" cried he, starting up; \"is my mother ill?\" And he\nhastened to the door. Monte Cristo watched and saw him approach the\nvalet, who drew a small sealed parcel from his pocket, containing a\nnewspaper and a letter. \"From whom is this?\" said he eagerly. \"From M.\nBeauchamp,\" replied Florentin.\n\n\"Did he send you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; he sent for me to his house, gave me money for my journey,\nprocured a horse, and made me promise not to stop till I had reached\nyou, I have come in fifteen hours.\"\n\nAlbert opened the letter with fear, uttered a shriek on reading the\nfirst line, and seized the paper. His sight was dimmed, his legs sank\nunder him, and he would have fallen had not Florentin supported him.\n\n\"Poor young man,\" said Monte Cristo in a low voice; \"it is then true\nthat the sin of the father shall fall on the children to the third and\nfourth generation.\" Meanwhile Albert had revived, and, continuing to\nread, he threw back his head, saying, \"Florentin, is your horse fit to\nreturn immediately?\"\n\n\"It is a poor lame post-horse.\"\n\n\"In what state was the house when you left?\"\n\n\"All was quiet, but on returning from M. Beauchamp's, I found madame in\ntears: she had sent for me to know when you would return. I told her my\norders from M. Beauchamp; she first extended her arms to prevent me, but\nafter a moment's reflection, 'Yes, go, Florentin,' said she, 'and may he\ncome quickly.'\"\n\n\"Yes, my mother,\" said Albert, \"I will return, and woe to the infamous\nwretch! But first of all I must get there.\"\n\nHe went back to the room where he had left Monte Cristo. Five minutes\nhad sufficed to make a complete transformation in his appearance. His\nvoice had become rough and hoarse; his face was furrowed with wrinkles;\nhis eyes burned under the blue-veined lids, and he tottered like a\ndrunken man. \"Count,\" said he, \"I thank you for your hospitality, which\nI would gladly have enjoyed longer; but I must return to Paris.\"\n\n\"What has happened?\"\n\n\"A great misfortune, more important to me than life. Don't question me,\nI beg of you, but lend me a horse.\"\n\n\"My stables are at your command, viscount; but you will kill yourself by\nriding on horseback. Take a post-chaise or a carriage.\"\n\n\"No, it would delay me, and I need the fatigue you warn me of; it will\ndo me good.\" Albert reeled as if he had been shot, and fell on a chair\nnear the door. Monte Cristo did not see this second manifestation of\nphysical exhaustion; he was at the window, calling, \"Ali, a horse for\nM. de Morcerf--quick! he is in a hurry!\" These words restored Albert;\nhe darted from the room, followed by the count. \"Thank you!\" cried he,\nthrowing himself on his horse. \"Return as soon as you can, Florentin.\nMust I use any password to procure a horse?\"\n\n\"Only dismount; another will be immediately saddled.\" Albert hesitated a\nmoment. \"You may think my departure strange and foolish,\" said the young\nman; \"you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate one.\nRead that,\" said he, \"when I am gone, that you may not be witness of my\nanger.\"\n\nWhile the count picked up the paper he put spurs to his horse, which\nleaped in astonishment at such an unusual stimulus, and shot away\nwith the rapidity of an arrow. The count watched him with a feeling of\ncompassion, and when he had completely disappeared, read as follows:--\n\n\"The French officer in the service of Ali Pasha of Yanina alluded to\nthree weeks since in the Impartial, who not only surrendered the castle\nof Yanina, but sold his benefactor to the Turks, styled himself truly at\nthat time Fernand, as our esteemed contemporary states; but he has since\nadded to his Christian name a title of nobility and a family name. He\nnow calls himself the Count of Morcerf, and ranks among the peers.\"\n\nThus the terrible secret, which Beauchamp had so generously destroyed,\nappeared again like an armed phantom; and another paper, deriving its\ninformation from some malicious source, had published two days after\nAlbert's departure for Normandy the few lines which had rendered the\nunfortunate young man almost crazy.\n\n\n\nChapter 86. The Trial.\n\nAt eight o'clock in the morning Albert had arrived at Beauchamp's\ndoor. The valet de chambre had received orders to usher him in at once.\nBeauchamp was in his bath. \"Here I am,\" said Albert.\n\n\"Well, my poor friend,\" replied Beauchamp, \"I expected you.\"\n\n\"I need not say I think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken\nof that painful circumstance. Your having sent for me is another proof\nof your affection. So, without losing time, tell me, have you the\nslightest idea whence this terrible blow proceeds?\"\n\n\"I think I have some clew.\"\n\n\"But first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot.\" Beauchamp\nproceeded to relate to the young man, who was overwhelmed with shame\nand grief, the following facts. Two days previously, the article had\nappeared in another paper besides the Impartial, and, what was more\nserious, one that was well known as a government paper. Beauchamp was\nbreakfasting when he read the paragraph. He sent immediately for a\ncabriolet, and hastened to the publisher's office. Although professing\ndiametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the other\npaper, Beauchamp--as it sometimes, we may say often, happens--was\nhis intimate friend. The editor was reading, with apparent delight, a\nleading article in the same paper on beet-sugar, probably a composition\nof his own.\n\n\"Ah, pardieu,\" said Beauchamp, \"with the paper in your hand, my friend,\nI need not tell you the cause of my visit.\"\n\n\"Are you interested in the sugar question?\" asked the editor of the\nministerial paper.\n\n\"No,\" replied Beauchamp, \"I have not considered the question; a totally\ndifferent subject interests me.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"The article relative to Morcerf.\"\n\n\"Indeed? Is it not a curious affair?\"\n\n\"So curious, that I think you are running a great risk of a prosecution\nfor defamation of character.\"\n\n\"Not at all; we have received with the information all the requisite\nproofs, and we are quite sure M. de Morcerf will not raise his voice\nagainst us; besides, it is rendering a service to one's country to\ndenounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the honor bestowed\non them.\" Beauchamp was thunderstruck. \"Who, then, has so correctly\ninformed you?\" asked he; \"for my paper, which gave the first information\non the subject, has been obliged to stop for want of proof; and yet we\nare more interested than you in exposing M. de Morcerf, as he is a peer\nof France, and we are of the opposition.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is very simple; we have not sought to scandalize. This news\nwas brought to us. A man arrived yesterday from Yanina, bringing a\nformidable array of documents; and when we hesitated to publish the\naccusatory article, he told us it should be inserted in some other\npaper.\"\n\nBeauchamp understood that nothing remained but to submit, and left the\noffice to despatch a courier to Morcerf. But he had been unable to send\nto Albert the following particulars, as the events had transpired after\nthe messenger's departure; namely, that the same day a great agitation\nwas manifest in the House of Peers among the usually calm members of\nthat dignified assembly. Every one had arrived almost before the usual\nhour, and was conversing on the melancholy event which was to attract\nthe attention of the public towards one of their most illustrious\ncolleagues. Some were perusing the article, others making comments and\nrecalling circumstances which substantiated the charges still more. The\nCount of Morcerf was no favorite with his colleagues. Like all upstarts,\nhe had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his\nposition. The true nobility laughed at him, the talented repelled him,\nand the honorable instinctively despised him. He was, in fact, in the\nunhappy position of the victim marked for sacrifice; the finger of God\nonce pointed at him, every one was prepared to raise the hue and cry.\n\nThe Count of Morcerf alone was ignorant of the news. He did not take in\nthe paper containing the defamatory article, and had passed the morning\nin writing letters and in trying a horse. He arrived at his usual hour,\nwith a proud look and insolent demeanor; he alighted, passed through the\ncorridors, and entered the house without observing the hesitation of\nthe door-keepers or the coolness of his colleagues. Business had already\nbeen going on for half an hour when he entered. Every one held the\naccusing paper, but, as usual, no one liked to take upon himself the\nresponsibility of the attack. At length an honorable peer, Morcerf's\nacknowledged enemy, ascended the tribune with that solemnity which\nannounced that the expected moment had arrived. There was an impressive\nsilence; Morcerf alone knew not why such profound attention was given to\nan orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency. The\ncount did not notice the introduction, in which the speaker announced\nthat his communication would be of that vital importance that it\ndemanded the undivided attention of the House; but at the mention of\nYanina and Colonel Fernand, he turned so frightfully pale that every\nmember shuddered and fixed his eyes upon him. Moral wounds have this\npeculiarity,--they may be hidden, but they never close; always painful,\nalways ready to bleed when touched, they remain fresh and open in the\nheart.\n\nThe article having been read during the painful hush that followed, a\nuniversal shudder pervaded the assembly, and immediately the closest\nattention was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks. He stated\nhis scruples and the difficulties of the case; it was the honor of M.\nde Morcerf, and that of the whole House, he proposed to defend, by\nprovoking a debate on personal questions, which are always such painful\nthemes of discussion. He concluded by calling for an investigation,\nwhich might dispose of the calumnious report before it had time to\nspread, and restore M. de Morcerf to the position he had long held in\npublic opinion. Morcerf was so completely overwhelmed by this great and\nunexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few words as he\nlooked around on the assembly. This timidity, which might proceed from\nthe astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of guilt, conciliated\nsome in his favor; for men who are truly generous are always ready to\ncompassionate when the misfortune of their enemy surpasses the limits of\ntheir hatred.\n\nThe president put it to the vote, and it was decided that the\ninvestigation should take place. The count was asked what time he\nrequired to prepare his defence. Morcerf's courage had revived when he\nfound himself alive after this horrible blow. \"My lords,\" answered\nhe, \"it is not by time I could repel the attack made on me by enemies\nunknown to me, and, doubtless, hidden in obscurity; it is immediately,\nand by a thunderbolt, that I must repel the flash of lightning which,\nfor a moment, startled me. Oh, that I could, instead of taking up this\ndefence, shed my last drop of blood to prove to my noble colleagues that\nI am their equal in worth.\" These words made a favorable impression on\nbehalf of the accused. \"I demand, then, that the examination shall\ntake place as soon as possible, and I will furnish the house with all\nnecessary information.\"\n\n\"What day do you fix?\" asked the president.\n\n\"To-day I am at your service,\" replied the count. The president rang\nthe bell. \"Does the House approve that the examination should take place\nto-day?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" was the unanimous answer.\n\nA committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs brought\nforward by Morcerf. The investigation would begin at eight o'clock that\nevening in the committee-room, and if postponement were necessary, the\nproceedings would be resumed each evening at the same hour. Morcerf\nasked leave to retire; he had to collect the documents he had long been\npreparing against this storm, which his sagacity had foreseen.\n\nAlbert listened, trembling now with hope, then with anger, and then\nagain with shame, for from Beauchamp's confidence he knew his father was\nguilty, and he asked himself how, since he was guilty, he could prove\nhis innocence. Beauchamp hesitated to continue his narrative. \"What\nnext?\" asked Albert.\n\n\"What next? My friend, you impose a painful task on me. Must you know\nall?\"\n\n\"Absolutely; and rather from your lips than another's.\"\n\n\"Muster up all your courage, then, for never have you required it more.\"\nAlbert passed his hand over his forehead, as if to try his strength, as\na man who is preparing to defend his life proves his shield and bends\nhis sword. He thought himself strong enough, for he mistook fever for\nenergy. \"Go on,\" said he.\n\n\"The evening arrived; all Paris was in expectation. Many said your\nfather had only to show himself to crush the charge against him; many\nothers said he would not appear; while some asserted that they had seen\nhim start for Brussels; and others went to the police-office to inquire\nif he had taken out a passport. I used all my influence with one of the\ncommittee, a young peer of my acquaintance, to get admission to one of\nthe galleries. He called for me at seven o'clock, and, before any one\nhad arrived, asked one of the door-keepers to place me in a box. I was\nconcealed by a column, and might witness the whole of the terrible\nscene which was about to take place. At eight o'clock all were in their\nplaces, and M. de Morcerf entered at the last stroke. He held some\npapers in his hand; his countenance was calm, and his step firm, and he\nwas dressed with great care in his military uniform, which was buttoned\ncompletely up to the chin. His presence produced a good effect. The\ncommittee was made up of Liberals, several of whom came forward to shake\nhands with him.\"\n\nAlbert felt his heart bursting at these particulars, but gratitude\nmingled with his sorrow: he would gladly have embraced those who had\ngiven his father this proof of esteem at a moment when his honor was so\npowerfully attacked. \"At this moment one of the door-keepers brought\nin a letter for the president. 'You are at liberty to speak, M. de\nMorcerf,' said the president, as he unsealed the letter; and the count\nbegan his defence, I assure you, Albert, in a most eloquent and skilful\nmanner. He produced documents proving that the Vizier of Yanina had up\nto the last moment honored him with his entire confidence, since he had\ninterested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor. He\nproduced the ring, his mark of authority, with which Ali Pasha generally\nsealed his letters, and which the latter had given him, that he might,\non his return at any hour of the day or night, gain access to the\npresence, even in the harem. Unfortunately, the negotiation failed, and\nwhen he returned to defend his benefactor, he was dead. 'But,' said the\ncount, 'so great was Ali Pasha's confidence, that on his death-bed he\nresigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care.'\" Albert\nstarted on hearing these words; the history of Haidee recurred to him,\nand he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring, and\nthe manner in which she had been sold and made a slave. \"And what effect\ndid this discourse produce?\" anxiously inquired Albert. \"I acknowledge\nit affected me, and, indeed, all the committee also,\" said Beauchamp.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the president carelessly opened the letter which had been\nbrought to him; but the first lines aroused his attention; he read them\nagain and again, and fixing his eyes on M. de Morcerf, 'Count,' said he,\n'you have said that the Vizier of Yanina confided his wife and daughter\nto your care?'--'Yes, sir,' replied Morcerf; 'but in that, like all the\nrest, misfortune pursued me. On my return, Vasiliki and her daughter\nHaidee had disappeared.'--'Did you know them?'--'My intimacy with the\npasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to\nthem, and I had seen them above twenty times.'\n\n\"'Have you any idea what became of them?'--'Yes, sir; I heard they had\nfallen victims to their sorrow, and, perhaps, to their poverty. I was\nnot rich; my life was in constant danger; I could not seek them, to my\ngreat regret.' The president frowned imperceptibly. 'Gentlemen,' said\nhe, 'you have heard the Comte de Morcerf's defence. Can you, sir,\nproduce any witnesses to the truth of what you have asserted?'--'Alas,\nno, monsieur,' replied the count; 'all those who surrounded the vizier,\nor who knew me at his court, are either dead or gone away, I know not\nwhere. I believe that I alone, of all my countrymen, survived that\ndreadful war. I have only the letters of Ali Tepelini, which I have\nplaced before you; the ring, a token of his good-will, which is here;\nand, lastly, the most convincing proof I can offer, after an anonymous\nattack, and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and\nthe purity of my military life.' A murmur of approbation ran through the\nassembly; and at this moment, Albert, had nothing more transpired, your\nfather's cause had been gained. It only remained to put it to the vote,\nwhen the president resumed: 'Gentlemen and you, monsieur,--you will\nnot be displeased, I presume, to listen to one who calls himself a very\nimportant witness, and who has just presented himself. He is, doubtless,\ncome to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague. Here is a letter\nI have just received on the subject; shall it be read, or shall it\nbe passed over? and shall we take no notice of this incident?' M. de\nMorcerf turned pale, and clinched his hands on the papers he held.\nThe committee decided to hear the letter; the count was thoughtful and\nsilent. The president read:--\n\n\"'Mr. President,--I can furnish the committee of inquiry into the\nconduct of the Lieutenant-General the Count of Morcerf in Epirus and in\nMacedonia with important particulars.'\n\n\"The president paused, and the count turned pale. The president looked\nat his auditors. 'Proceed,' was heard on all sides. The president\nresumed:--\n\n\"'I was on the spot at the death of Ali Pasha. I was present during his\nlast moments. I know what is become of Vasiliki and Haidee. I am at the\ncommand of the committee, and even claim the honor of being heard. I\nshall be in the lobby when this note is delivered to you.'\n\n\"'And who is this witness, or rather this enemy?' asked the count, in\na tone in which there was a visible alteration. 'We shall know,\nsir,' replied the president. 'Is the committee willing to hear this\nwitness?'--'Yes, yes,' they all said at once. The door-keeper was\ncalled. 'Is there any one in the lobby?' said the president.\n\n\"'Yes, sir.'--'Who is it?'--'A woman, accompanied by a servant.' Every\none looked at his neighbor. 'Bring her in,' said the president. Five\nminutes after the door-keeper again appeared; all eyes were fixed on\nthe door, and I,\" said Beauchamp, \"shared the general expectation and\nanxiety. Behind the door-keeper walked a woman enveloped in a large\nveil, which completely concealed her. It was evident, from her figure\nand the perfumes she had about her, that she was young and fastidious in\nher tastes, but that was all. The president requested her to throw\naside her veil, and it was then seen that she was dressed in the Grecian\ncostume, and was remarkably beautiful.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Albert, \"it was she.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Haidee.\"\n\n\"Who told you that?\"\n\n\"Alas, I guess it. But go on, Beauchamp. You see I am calm and strong.\nAnd yet we must be drawing near the disclosure.\"\n\n\"M. de Morcerf,\" continued Beauchamp, \"looked at this woman with\nsurprise and terror. Her lips were about to pass his sentence of life or\ndeath. To the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious,\nthat the interest they had felt for the count's safety became now quite\na secondary matter. The president himself advanced to place a seat for\nthe young lady; but she declined availing herself of it. As for the\ncount, he had fallen on his chair; it was evident that his legs refused\nto support him.\n\n\"'Madame,' said the president, 'you have engaged to furnish the\ncommittee with some important particulars respecting the affair\nat Yanina, and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the\nevent.'--'I was, indeed,' said the stranger, with a tone of sweet\nmelancholy, and with the sonorous voice peculiar to the East.\n\n\"'But allow me to say that you must have been very young then.'--'I was\nfour years old; but as those events deeply concerned me, not a single\ndetail has escaped my memory.'--'In what manner could these events\nconcern you? and who are you, that they should have made so deep an\nimpression on you?'--'On them depended my father's life,' replied she.\n'I am Haidee, the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of\nVasiliki, his beloved wife.'\n\n\"The blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the\ncheeks of the young woman, the brilliancy of her eye, and her highly\nimportant communication, produced an indescribable effect on the\nassembly. As for the count, he could not have been more overwhelmed if\na thunderbolt had fallen at his feet and opened an immense gulf before\nhim. 'Madame,' replied the president, bowing with profound respect,\n'allow me to ask one question; it shall be the last: Can you prove the\nauthenticity of what you have now stated?'--'I can, sir,' said Haidee,\ndrawing from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed; 'for here\nis the register of my birth, signed by my father and his principal\nofficers, and that of my baptism, my father having consented to my being\nbrought up in my mother's faith,--this latter has been sealed by the\ngrand primate of Macedonia and Epirus; and lastly (and perhaps the most\nimportant), the record of the sale of my person and that of my mother\nto the Armenian merchant El-Kobbir, by the French officer, who, in his\ninfamous bargain with the Porte, had reserved as his part of the booty\nthe wife and daughter of his benefactor, whom he sold for the sum of\nfour hundred thousand francs.' A greenish pallor spread over the count's\ncheeks, and his eyes became bloodshot at these terrible imputations,\nwhich were listened to by the assembly with ominous silence.\n\n\"Haidee, still calm, but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of\nanother would have been, handed to the president the record of her sale,\nwritten in Arabic. It had been supposed some of the papers might be in\nthe Arabian, Romaic, or Turkish language, and the interpreter of the\nHouse was in attendance. One of the noble peers, who was familiar\nwith the Arabic language, having studied it during the famous Egyptian\ncampaign, followed with his eye as the translator read aloud:--\n\n\"'I, El-Kobbir, a slave-merchant, and purveyor of the harem of his\nhighness, acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime\nemperor, from the French lord, the Count of Monte Cristo, an emerald\nvalued at eight hundred thousand francs; as the ransom of a young\nChristian slave of eleven years of age, named Haidee, the acknowledged\ndaughter of the late lord Ali Tepelini, pasha of Yanina, and of\nVasiliki, his favorite; she having been sold to me seven years\npreviously, with her mother, who had died on arriving at Constantinople,\nby a French colonel in the service of the Vizier Ali Tepelini, named\nFernand Mondego. The above-mentioned purchase was made on his highness's\naccount, whose mandate I had, for the sum of four hundred thousand\nfrancs.\n\n\"'Given at Constantinople, by authority of his highness, in the year\n1247 of the Hegira.\n\n\"'Signed El-Kobbir.'\n\n\"'That this record should have all due authority, it shall bear the\nimperial seal, which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it.'\n\n\"Near the merchant's signature there was, indeed, the seal of the\nsublime emperor. A dreadful silence followed the reading of this\ndocument; the count could only stare, and his gaze, fixed as if\nunconsciously on Haidee, seemed one of fire and blood. 'Madame,' said\nthe president, 'may reference be made to the Count of Monte Cristo,\nwho is now, I believe, in Paris?'--'Sir,' replied Haidee, 'the Count\nof Monte Cristo, my foster-father, has been in Normandy the last three\ndays.'\n\n\"'Who, then, has counselled you to take this step, one for which\nthe court is deeply indebted to you, and which is perfectly natural,\nconsidering your birth and your misfortunes?'--'Sir,' replied Haidee,\n'I have been led to take this step from a feeling of respect and grief.\nAlthough a Christian, may God forgive me, I have always sought to\nrevenge my illustrious father. Since I set my foot in France, and knew\nthe traitor lived in Paris, I have watched carefully. I live retired\nin the house of my noble protector, but I do it from choice. I love\nretirement and silence, because I can live with my thoughts and\nrecollections of past days. But the Count of Monte Cristo surrounds me\nwith every paternal care, and I am ignorant of nothing which passes in\nthe world. I learn all in the silence of my apartments,--for instance, I\nsee all the newspapers, every periodical, as well as every new piece of\nmusic; and by thus watching the course of the life of others, I learned\nwhat had transpired this morning in the House of Peers, and what was to\ntake place this evening; then I wrote.'\n\n\"'Then,' remarked the president, 'the Count of Monte Cristo knows\nnothing of your present proceedings?'--'He is quite unaware of them, and\nI have but one fear, which is that he should disapprove of what I\nhave done. But it is a glorious day for me,' continued the young girl,\nraising her ardent gaze to heaven, 'that on which I find at last an\nopportunity of avenging my father!'\n\n\"The count had not uttered one word the whole of this time. His\ncolleagues looked at him, and doubtless pitied his prospects, blighted\nunder the perfumed breath of a woman. His misery was depicted in\nsinister lines on his countenance. 'M. de Morcerf,' said the president,\n'do you recognize this lady as the daughter of Ali Tepelini, pasha of\nYanina?'--'No,' said Morcerf, attempting to rise, 'it is a base plot,\ncontrived by my enemies.' Haidee, whose eyes had been fixed on the\ndoor, as if expecting some one, turned hastily, and, seeing the count\nstanding, shrieked, 'You do not know me?' said she. 'Well, I fortunately\nrecognize you! You are Fernand Mondego, the French officer who led\nthe troops of my noble father! It is you who surrendered the castle of\nYanina! It is you who, sent by him to Constantinople, to treat with the\nemperor for the life or death of your benefactor, brought back a false\nmandate granting full pardon! It is you who, with that mandate, obtained\nthe pasha's ring, which gave you authority over Selim, the fire-keeper!\nIt is you who stabbed Selim. It is you who sold us, my mother and me, to\nthe merchant, El-Kobbir! Assassin, assassin, assassin, you have still on\nyour brow your master's blood! Look, gentlemen, all!'\n\n\"These words had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident truth,\nthat every eye was fixed on the count's forehead, and he himself passed\nhis hand across it, as if he felt Ali's blood still lingering there.\n'You positively recognize M. de Morcerf as the officer, Fernand\nMondego?'--'Indeed I do!' cried Haidee. 'Oh, my mother, it was you who\nsaid, \"You were free, you had a beloved father, you were destined to be\nalmost a queen. Look well at that man; it is he who raised your father's\nhead on the point of a spear; it is he who sold us; it is he who forsook\nus! Look well at his right hand, on which he has a large wound; if you\nforgot his features, you would know him by that hand, into which fell,\none by one, the gold pieces of the merchant El-Kobbir!\" I know him!\nAh, let him say now if he does not recognize me!' Each word fell like a\ndagger on Morcerf, and deprived him of a portion of his energy; as she\nuttered the last, he hid his mutilated hand hastily in his bosom, and\nfell back on his seat, overwhelmed by wretchedness and despair. This\nscene completely changed the opinion of the assembly respecting the\naccused count.\n\n\"'Count of Morcerf,' said the president, 'do not allow yourself to be\ncast down; answer. The justice of the court is supreme and impartial as\nthat of God; it will not suffer you to be trampled on by your enemies\nwithout giving you an opportunity of defending yourself. Shall further\ninquiries be made? Shall two members of the House be sent to Yanina?\nSpeak!' Morcerf did not reply. Then all the members looked at each other\nwith terror. They knew the count's energetic and violent temper; it must\nbe, indeed, a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend\nhimself. They expected that his stupefied silence would be followed by a\nfiery outburst. 'Well,' asked the president, 'what is your decision?'\n\n\"'I have no reply to make,' said the count in a low tone.\n\n\"'Has the daughter of Ali Tepelini spoken the truth?' said the\npresident. 'Is she, then, the terrible witness to whose charge you dare\nnot plead \"Not guilty\"? Have you really committed the crimes of which\nyou are accused?' The count looked around him with an expression which\nmight have softened tigers, but which could not disarm his judges. Then\nhe raised his eyes towards the ceiling, but withdrew then, immediately,\nas if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view\nthat second tribunal called heaven, and that other judge named God.\nThen, with a hasty movement, he tore open his coat, which seemed to\nstifle him, and flew from the room like a madman; his footstep was heard\none moment in the corridor, then the rattling of his carriage-wheels\nas he was driven rapidly away. 'Gentlemen,' said the president, when\nsilence was restored, 'is the Count of Morcerf convicted of felony,\ntreason, and conduct unbecoming a member of this House?'--'Yes,' replied\nall the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous voice.\n\n\"Haidee had remained until the close of the meeting. She heard the\ncount's sentence pronounced without betraying an expression of joy or\npity; then drawing her veil over her face she bowed majestically to the\ncouncillors, and left with that dignified step which Virgil attributes\nto his goddesses.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 87. The Challenge.\n\n\"Then,\" continued Beauchamp, \"I took advantage of the silence and\nthe darkness to leave the house without being seen. The usher who\nhad introduced me was waiting for me at the door, and he conducted me\nthrough the corridors to a private entrance opening into the Rue de\nVaugirard. I left with mingled feelings of sorrow and delight. Excuse\nme, Albert,--sorrow on your account, and delight with that noble girl,\nthus pursuing paternal vengeance. Yes, Albert, from whatever source the\nblow may have proceeded--it may be from an enemy, but that enemy is only\nthe agent of providence.\" Albert held his head between his hands;\nhe raised his face, red with shame and bathed in tears, and seizing\nBeauchamp's arm, \"My friend,\" said he, \"my life is ended. I cannot\ncalmly say with you, 'Providence has struck the blow;' but I must\ndiscover who pursues me with this hatred, and when I have found him I\nshall kill him, or he will kill me. I rely on your friendship to assist\nme, Beauchamp, if contempt has not banished it from your heart.\"\n\n\"Contempt, my friend? How does this misfortune affect you? No, happily\nthat unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the son responsible for\nthe father's actions. Review your life, Albert; although it is only just\nbeginning, did a lovely summer's day ever dawn with greater purity than\nhas marked the commencement of your career? No, Albert, take my advice.\nYou are young and rich--leave Paris--all is soon forgotten in this great\nBabylon of excitement and changing tastes. You will return after three\nor four years with a Russian princess for a bride, and no one will think\nmore of what occurred yesterday than if it had happened sixteen years\nago.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my dear Beauchamp, thank you for the excellent feeling\nwhich prompts your advice; but it cannot be. I have told you my wish, or\nrather my determination. You understand that, interested as I am in this\naffair, I cannot see it in the same light as you do. What appears to you\nto emanate from a celestial source, seems to me to proceed from one far\nless pure. Providence appears to me to have no share in this affair; and\nhappily so, for instead of the invisible, impalpable agent of celestial\nrewards and punishments, I shall find one both palpable and visible,\non whom I shall revenge myself, I assure you, for all I have suffered\nduring the last month. Now, I repeat, Beauchamp, I wish to return\nto human and material existence, and if you are still the friend you\nprofess to be, help me to discover the hand that struck the blow.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" said Beauchamp; \"if you must have me descend to earth, I\nsubmit; and if you will seek your enemy, I will assist you, and I\nwill engage to find him, my honor being almost as deeply interested as\nyours.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you understand, Beauchamp, that we begin our search\nimmediately. Each moment's delay is an eternity for me. The calumniator\nis not yet punished, and he may hope that he will not be; but, on my\nhonor, if he thinks so, he deceives himself.\"\n\n\"Well, listen, Morcerf.\"\n\n\"Ah, Beauchamp, I see you know something already; you will restore me to\nlife.\"\n\n\"I do not say there is any truth in what I am going to tell you, but it\nis, at least, a ray of light in a dark night; by following it we may,\nperhaps, discover something more certain.\"\n\n\"Tell me; satisfy my impatience.\"\n\n\"Well, I will tell you what I did not like to mention on my return from\nYanina.\"\n\n\"Say on.\"\n\n\"I went, of course, to the chief banker of the town to make inquiries.\nAt the first word, before I had even mentioned your father's name\"--\n\n\"'Ah,' said he. 'I guess what brings you here.'\n\n\"'How, and why?'\n\n\"'Because a fortnight since I was questioned on the same subject.'\n\n\"'By whom?'--'By a Paris banker, my correspondent.'\n\n\"'Whose name is'--\n\n\"'Danglars.'\"\n\n\"He!\" cried Albert; \"yes, it is indeed he who has so long pursued my\nfather with jealous hatred. He, the man who would be popular, cannot\nforgive the Count of Morcerf for being created a peer; and this marriage\nbroken off without a reason being assigned--yes, it is all from the same\ncause.\"\n\n\"Make inquiries, Albert, but do not be angry without reason; make\ninquiries, and if it be true\"--\n\n\"Oh, yes, if it be true,\" cried the young man, \"he shall pay me all I\nhave suffered.\"\n\n\"Beware, Morcerf, he is already an old man.\"\n\n\"I will respect his age as he has respected the honor of my family; if\nmy father had offended him, why did he not attack him personally? Oh,\nno, he was afraid to encounter him face to face.\"\n\n\"I do not condemn you, Albert; I only restrain you. Act prudently.\"\n\n\"Oh, do not fear; besides, you will accompany me. Beauchamp, solemn\ntransactions should be sanctioned by a witness. Before this day closes,\nif M. Danglars is guilty, he shall cease to live, or I shall die.\nPardieu, Beauchamp, mine shall be a splendid funeral!\"\n\n\"When such resolutions are made, Albert, they should be promptly\nexecuted. Do you wish to go to M. Danglars? Let us go immediately.\" They\nsent for a cabriolet. On entering the banker's mansion, they perceived\nthe phaeton and servant of M. Andrea Cavalcanti. \"Ah, parbleu, that's\ngood,\" said Albert, with a gloomy tone. \"If M. Danglars will not fight\nwith me, I will kill his son-in-law; Cavalcanti will certainly fight.\"\nThe servant announced the young man; but the banker, recollecting\nwhat had transpired the day before, did not wish him admitted. It was,\nhowever, too late; Albert had followed the footman, and, hearing the\norder given, forced the door open, and followed by Beauchamp found\nhimself in the banker's study. \"Sir,\" cried the latter, \"am I no longer\nat liberty to receive whom I choose in my house? You appear to forget\nyourself sadly.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Albert, coldly; \"there are circumstances in which one\ncannot, except through cowardice,--I offer you that refuge,--refuse to\nadmit certain persons at least.\"\n\n\"What is your errand, then, with me, sir?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" said Albert, drawing near, and without apparently noticing\nCavalcanti, who stood with his back towards the fireplace--\"I mean to\npropose a meeting in some retired corner where no one will interrupt us\nfor ten minutes; that will be sufficient--where two men having met, one\nof them will remain on the ground.\" Danglars turned pale; Cavalcanti\nmoved a step forward, and Albert turned towards him. \"And you, too,\"\nsaid he, \"come, if you like, monsieur; you have a claim, being almost\none of the family, and I will give as many rendezvous of that kind as I\ncan find persons willing to accept them.\" Cavalcanti looked at Danglars\nwith a stupefied air, and the latter, making an effort, arose and\nstepped between the two young men. Albert's attack on Andrea had placed\nhim on a different footing, and he hoped this visit had another cause\nthan that he had at first supposed.\n\n\"Indeed, sir,\" said he to Albert, \"if you are come to quarrel with this\ngentleman because I have preferred him to you, I shall resign the case\nto the king's attorney.\"\n\n\"You mistake, sir,\" said Morcerf with a gloomy smile; \"I am not\nreferring in the least to matrimony, and I only addressed myself to M.\nCavalcanti because he appeared disposed to interfere between us. In one\nrespect you are right, for I am ready to quarrel with every one to-day;\nbut you have the first claim, M. Danglars.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Danglars, pale with anger and fear, \"I warn you, when\nI have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog, I kill it; and far from\nthinking myself guilty of a crime, I believe I do society a kindness.\nNow, if you are mad and try to bite me, I will kill you without pity. Is\nit my fault that your father has dishonored himself?\"\n\n\"Yes, miserable wretch!\" cried Morcerf, \"it is your fault.\" Danglars\nretreated a few steps. \"My fault?\" said he; \"you must be mad! What do\nI know of the Grecian affair? Have I travelled in that country? Did I\nadvise your father to sell the castle of Yanina--to betray\"--\n\n\"Silence!\" said Albert, with a thundering voice. \"No; it is not you who\nhave directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us, but you\nhypocritically provoked it.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes; you! How came it known?\"\n\n\"I suppose you read it in the paper in the account from Yanina?\"\n\n\"Who wrote to Yanina?\"\n\n\"To Yanina?\"\n\n\"Yes. Who wrote for particulars concerning my father?\"\n\n\"I imagine any one may write to Yanina.\"\n\n\"But one person only wrote!\"\n\n\"One only?\"\n\n\"Yes; and that was you!\"\n\n\"I, doubtless, wrote. It appears to me that when about to marry your\ndaughter to a young man, it is right to make some inquiries respecting\nhis family; it is not only a right, but a duty.\"\n\n\"You wrote, sir, knowing what answer you would receive.\"\n\n\"I, indeed? I assure you,\" cried Danglars, with a confidence and\nsecurity proceeding less from fear than from the interest he really felt\nfor the young man, \"I solemnly declare to you, that I should never\nhave thought of writing to Yanina, did I know anything of Ali Pasha's\nmisfortunes.\"\n\n\"Who, then, urged you to write? Tell me.\"\n\n\"Pardieu, it was the most simple thing in the world. I was speaking of\nyour father's past history. I said the origin of his fortune remained\nobscure. The person to whom I addressed my scruples asked me where your\nfather had acquired his property? I answered, 'In Greece.'--'Then,' said\nhe, 'write to Yanina.'\"\n\n\"And who thus advised you?\"\n\n\"No other than your friend, Monte Cristo.\"\n\n\"The Count of Monte Cristo told you to write to Yanina?\"\n\n\"Yes; and I wrote, and will show you my correspondence, if you like.\"\nAlbert and Beauchamp looked at each other. \"Sir,\" said Beauchamp, who\nhad not yet spoken, \"you appear to accuse the count, who is absent from\nParis at this moment, and cannot justify himself.\"\n\n\"I accuse no one, sir,\" said Danglars; \"I relate, and I will repeat\nbefore the count what I have said to you.\"\n\n\"Does the count know what answer you received?\"\n\n\"Yes; I showed it to him.\"\n\n\"Did he know my father's Christian name was Fernand, and his family name\nMondego?\"\n\n\"Yes, I had told him that long since, and I did only what any other\nwould have done in my circumstances, and perhaps less. When, the day\nafter the arrival of this answer, your father came by the advice of\nMonte Cristo to ask my daughter's hand for you, I decidedly refused him,\nbut without any explanation or exposure. In short, why should I have\nany more to do with the affair? How did the honor or disgrace of M. de\nMorcerf affect me? It neither increased nor decreased my income.\"\n\nAlbert felt the blood mounting to his brow; there was no doubt upon the\nsubject. Danglars defended himself with the baseness, but at the same\ntime with the assurance, of a man who speaks the truth, at least\nin part, if not wholly--not for conscience' sake, but through fear.\nBesides, what was Morcerf seeking? It was not whether Danglars or Monte\nCristo was more or less guilty; it was a man who would answer for the\noffence, whether trifling or serious; it was a man who would fight,\nand it was evident Danglars would not fight. And, in addition to this,\neverything forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to\nhis recollection. Monte Cristo knew everything, as he had bought the\ndaughter of Ali Pasha; and, knowing everything, he had advised Danglars\nto write to Yanina. The answer known, he had yielded to Albert's wish\nto be introduced to Haidee, and allowed the conversation to turn on\nthe death of Ali, and had not opposed Haidee's recital (but having,\ndoubtless, warned the young girl, in the few Romaic words he spoke to\nher, not to implicate Morcerf's father). Besides, had he not begged of\nMorcerf not to mention his father's name before Haidee? Lastly, he had\ntaken Albert to Normandy when he knew the final blow was near. There\ncould be no doubt that all had been calculated and previously arranged;\nMonte Cristo then was in league with his father's enemies. Albert took\nBeauchamp aside, and communicated these ideas to him.\n\n\"You are right,\" said the latter; \"M. Danglars has only been a secondary\nagent in this sad affair, and it is of M. de Monte Cristo that you\nmust demand an explanation.\" Albert turned. \"Sir,\" said he to Danglars,\n\"understand that I do not take a final leave of you; I must ascertain if\nyour insinuations are just, and am going now to inquire of the Count\nof Monte Cristo.\" He bowed to the banker, and went out with Beauchamp,\nwithout appearing to notice Cavalcanti. Danglars accompanied him to the\ndoor, where he again assured Albert that no motive of personal hatred\nhad influenced him against the Count of Morcerf.\n\n\n\nChapter 88. The Insult.\n\nAt the banker's door Beauchamp stopped Morcerf. \"Listen,\" said he;\n\"just now I told you it was of M. de Monte Cristo you must demand an\nexplanation.\"\n\n\"Yes; and we are going to his house.\"\n\n\"Reflect, Morcerf, one moment before you go.\"\n\n\"On what shall I reflect?\"\n\n\"On the importance of the step you are taking.\"\n\n\"Is it more serious than going to M. Danglars?\"\n\n\"Yes; M. Danglars is a money-lover, and those who love money, you know,\nthink too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel.\nThe other is, on the contrary, to all appearance a true nobleman; but do\nyou not fear to find him a bully?\"\n\n\"I only fear one thing; namely, to find a man who will not fight.\"\n\n\"Do not be alarmed,\" said Beauchamp; \"he will meet you. My only fear is\nthat he will be too strong for you.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Morcerf, with a sweet smile, \"that is what I wish. The\nhappiest thing that could occur to me, would be to die in my father's\nstead; that would save us all.\"\n\n\"Your mother would die of grief.\"\n\n\"My poor mother!\" said Albert, passing his hand across his eyes, \"I know\nshe would; but better so than die of shame.\"\n\n\"Are you quite decided, Albert?\"\n\n\"Yes; let us go.\"\n\n\"But do you think we shall find the count at home?\"\n\n\"He intended returning some hours after me, and doubtless he is now at\nhome.\" They ordered the driver to take them to No. 30 Champs-Elysees.\nBeauchamp wished to go in alone, but Albert observed that as this was\nan unusual circumstance he might be allowed to deviate from the usual\netiquette in affairs of honor. The cause which the young man espoused\nwas one so sacred that Beauchamp had only to comply with all his wishes;\nhe yielded and contented himself with following Morcerf. Albert sprang\nfrom the porter's lodge to the steps. He was received by Baptistin.\nThe count had, indeed, just arrived, but he was in his bath, and had\nforbidden that any one should be admitted. \"But after his bath?\" asked\nMorcerf.\n\n\"My master will go to dinner.\"\n\n\"And after dinner?\"\n\n\"He will sleep an hour.\"\n\n\"Then?\"\n\n\"He is going to the opera.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of it?\" asked Albert.\n\n\"Quite, sir; my master has ordered his horses at eight o'clock\nprecisely.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" replied Albert; \"that is all I wished to know.\" Then,\nturning towards Beauchamp, \"If you have anything to attend to,\nBeauchamp, do it directly; if you have any appointment for this evening,\ndefer it till tomorrow. I depend on you to accompany me to the opera;\nand if you can, bring Chateau-Renaud with you.\"\n\nBeauchamp availed himself of Albert's permission, and left him,\npromising to call for him at a quarter before eight. On his return home,\nAlbert expressed his wish to Franz Debray, and Morrel, to see them at\nthe opera that evening. Then he went to see his mother, who since the\nevents of the day before had refused to see any one, and had kept\nher room. He found her in bed, overwhelmed with grief at this public\nhumiliation. The sight of Albert produced the effect which might\nnaturally be expected on Mercedes; she pressed her son's hand and sobbed\naloud, but her tears relieved her. Albert stood one moment speechless by\nthe side of his mother's bed. It was evident from his pale face and knit\nbrows that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker. \"My\ndear mother,\" said he, \"do you know if M. de Morcerf has any enemy?\"\nMercedes started; she noticed that the young man did not say \"my\nfather.\" \"My son,\" she said, \"persons in the count's situation have many\nsecret enemies. Those who are known are not the most dangerous.\"\n\n\"I know it, and appeal to your penetration. You are of so superior a\nmind, nothing escapes you.\"\n\n\"Why do you say so?\"\n\n\"Because, for instance, you noticed on the evening of the ball we gave,\nthat M. de Monte Cristo would eat nothing in our house.\" Mercedes raised\nherself on her feverish arm. \"M. de Monte Cristo!\" she exclaimed; \"and\nhow is he connected with the question you asked me?\"\n\n\"You know, mother, M. de Monte Cristo is almost an Oriental, and it is\ncustomary with the Orientals to secure full liberty for revenge by not\neating or drinking in the houses of their enemies.\"\n\n\"Do you say M. de Monte Cristo is our enemy?\" replied Mercedes, becoming\npaler than the sheet which covered her. \"Who told you so? Why, you are\nmad, Albert! M. de Monte Cristo has only shown us kindness. M. de Monte\nCristo saved your life; you yourself presented him to us. Oh, I entreat\nyou, my son, if you had entertained such an idea, dispel it; and my\ncounsel to you--nay, my prayer--is to retain his friendship.\"\n\n\"Mother,\" replied the young man, \"you have especial reasons for telling\nme to conciliate that man.\"\n\n\"I?\" said Mercedes, blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale, and\nagain becoming paler than ever.\n\n\"Yes, doubtless; and is it not that he may never do us any harm?\"\nMercedes shuddered, and, fixing on her son a scrutinizing gaze, \"You\nspeak strangely,\" said she to Albert, \"and you appear to have some\nsingular prejudices. What has the count done? Three days since you were\nwith him in Normandy; only three days since we looked on him as our best\nfriend.\"\n\nAn ironical smile passed over Albert's lips. Mercedes saw it and with\nthe double instinct of woman and mother guessed all; but as she was\nprudent and strong-minded she concealed both her sorrows and her fears.\nAlbert was silent; an instant after, the countess resumed: \"You came to\ninquire after my health; I will candidly acknowledge that I am not well.\nYou should install yourself here, and cheer my solitude. I do not wish\nto be left alone.\"\n\n\"Mother,\" said the young man, \"you know how gladly I would obey your\nwish, but an urgent and important affair obliges me to leave you for the\nwhole evening.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Mercedes, sighing, \"go, Albert; I will not make you a\nslave to your filial piety.\" Albert pretended he did not hear, bowed\nto his mother, and quitted her. Scarcely had he shut her door, when\nMercedes called a confidential servant, and ordered him to follow Albert\nwherever he should go that evening, and to come and tell her immediately\nwhat he observed. Then she rang for her lady's maid, and, weak as she\nwas, she dressed, in order to be ready for whatever might happen. The\nfootman's mission was an easy one. Albert went to his room, and dressed\nwith unusual care. At ten minutes to eight Beauchamp arrived; he had\nseen Chateau-Renaud, who had promised to be in the orchestra before the\ncurtain was raised. Both got into Albert's coupe; and, as the young man\nhad no reason to conceal where he was going, he called aloud, \"To\nthe opera.\" In his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the\nperformance.\n\nChateau-Renaud was at his post; apprised by Beauchamp of the\ncircumstances, he required no explanation from Albert. The conduct\nof the son in seeking to avenge his father was so natural that\nChateau-Renaud did not seek to dissuade him, and was content with\nrenewing his assurances of devotion. Debray was not yet come, but Albert\nknew that he seldom lost a scene at the opera. Albert wandered about\nthe theatre until the curtain was drawn up. He hoped to meet with M. de\nMonte Cristo either in the lobby or on the stairs. The bell summoned\nhim to his seat, and he entered the orchestra with Chateau-Renaud and\nBeauchamp. But his eyes scarcely quitted the box between the columns,\nwhich remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act. At\nlast, as Albert was looking at his watch for about the hundredth time,\nat the beginning of the second act the door opened, and Monte Cristo\nentered, dressed in black, and, leaning over the front of the box,\nlooked around the pit. Morrel followed him, and looked also for his\nsister and brother in-law; he soon discovered them in another box, and\nkissed his hand to them.\n\nThe count, in his survey of the pit, encountered a pale face and\nthreatening eyes, which evidently sought to gain his attention. He\nrecognized Albert, but thought it better not to notice him, as he looked\nso angry and discomposed. Without communicating his thoughts to his\ncompanion, he sat down, drew out his opera-glass, and looked another\nway. Although apparently not noticing Albert, he did not, however, lose\nsight of him, and when the curtain fell at the end of the second act, he\nsaw him leave the orchestra with his two friends. Then his head was\nseen passing at the back of the boxes, and the count knew that the\napproaching storm was intended to fall on him. He was at the moment\nconversing cheerfully with Morrel, but he was well prepared for what\nmight happen. The door opened, and Monte Cristo, turning round, saw\nAlbert, pale and trembling, followed by Beauchamp and Chateau-Renaud.\n\n\"Well,\" cried he, with that benevolent politeness which distinguished\nhis salutation from the common civilities of the world, \"my cavalier has\nattained his object. Good-evening, M. de Morcerf.\" The countenance of\nthis man, who possessed such extraordinary control over his feelings,\nexpressed the most perfect cordiality. Morrel only then recollected the\nletter he had received from the viscount, in which, without assigning\nany reason, he begged him to go to the opera, but he understood that\nsomething terrible was brooding.\n\n\"We are not come here, sir, to exchange hypocritical expressions of\npoliteness, or false professions of friendship,\" said Albert, \"but to\ndemand an explanation.\" The young man's trembling voice was scarcely\naudible. \"An explanation at the opera?\" said the count, with that calm\ntone and penetrating eye which characterize the man who knows his cause\nis good. \"Little acquainted as I am with the habits of Parisians, I\nshould not have thought this the place for such a demand.\"\n\n\"Still, if people will shut themselves up,\" said Albert, \"and cannot\nbe seen because they are bathing, dining, or asleep, we must avail\nourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen.\"\n\n\"I am not difficult of access, sir; for yesterday, if my memory does not\ndeceive me, you were at my house.\"\n\n\"Yesterday I was at your house, sir,\" said the young man; \"because then\nI knew not who you were.\" In pronouncing these words Albert had raised\nhis voice so as to be heard by those in the adjoining boxes and in the\nlobby. Thus the attention of many was attracted by this altercation.\n\"Where are you come from, sir? You do not appear to be in the possession\nof your senses.\"\n\n\"Provided I understand your perfidy, sir, and succeed in making you\nunderstand that I will be revenged, I shall be reasonable enough,\" said\nAlbert furiously.\n\n\"I do not understand you, sir,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"and if I did,\nyour tone is too high. I am at home here, and I alone have a right\nto raise my voice above another's. Leave the box, sir!\" Monte Cristo\npointed towards the door with the most commanding dignity. \"Ah, I shall\nknow how to make you leave your home!\" replied Albert, clasping in his\nconvulsed grasp the glove, which Monte Cristo did not lose sight of.\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Monte Cristo quietly, \"I see you wish to quarrel with\nme; but I would give you one piece of advice, which you will do well\nto keep in mind. It is in poor taste to make a display of a challenge.\nDisplay is not becoming to every one, M. de Morcerf.\"\n\nAt this name a murmur of astonishment passed around the group of\nspectators of this scene. They had talked of no one but Morcerf the\nwhole day. Albert understood the allusion in a moment, and was about\nto throw his glove at the count, when Morrel seized his hand, while\nBeauchamp and Chateau-Renaud, fearing the scene would surpass the limits\nof a challenge, held him back. But Monte Cristo, without rising, and\nleaning forward in his chair, merely stretched out his arm and, taking\nthe damp, crushed glove from the clinched hand of the young man, \"Sir,\"\nsaid he in a solemn tone, \"I consider your glove thrown, and will return\nit to you wrapped around a bullet. Now leave me or I will summon my\nservants to throw you out at the door.\"\n\nWild, almost unconscious, and with eyes inflamed, Albert stepped back,\nand Morrel closed the door. Monte Cristo took up his glass again as if\nnothing had happened; his face was like marble, and his heart was like\nbronze. Morrel whispered, \"What have you done to him?\"\n\n\"I? Nothing--at least personally,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"But there must be some cause for this strange scene.\"\n\n\"The Count of Morcerf's adventure exasperates the young man.\"\n\n\"Have you anything to do with it?\"\n\n\"It was through Haidee that the Chamber was informed of his father's\ntreason.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Morrel. \"I had been told, but would not credit it, that\nthe Grecian slave I have seen with you here in this very box was the\ndaughter of Ali Pasha.\"\n\n\"It is true, nevertheless.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Morrel, \"I understand it all, and this scene was\npremeditated.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Yes. Albert wrote to request me to come to the opera, doubtless that I\nmight be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" said Monte Cristo with his imperturbable tranquillity.\n\n\"But what shall you do with him?\"\n\n\"With whom?\"\n\n\"With Albert.\"\n\n\"What shall I do with Albert? As certainly, Maximilian, as I now press\nyour hand, I shall kill him before ten o'clock to-morrow morning.\"\nMorrel, in his turn, took Monte Cristo's hand in both of his, and he\nshuddered to feel how cold and steady it was.\n\n\"Ah, Count,\" said he, \"his father loves him so much!\"\n\n\"Do not speak to me of that,\" said Monte Cristo, with the first movement\nof anger he had betrayed; \"I will make him suffer.\" Morrel, amazed, let\nfall Monte Cristo's hand. \"Count, count!\" said he.\n\n\"Dear Maximilian,\" interrupted the count, \"listen how adorably Duprez is\nsinging that line,--\n\n     'O Mathilde! idole de mon ame!'\n\n\"I was the first to discover Duprez at Naples, and the first to\napplaud him. Bravo, bravo!\" Morrel saw it was useless to say more, and\nrefrained. The curtain, which had risen at the close of the scene with\nAlbert, again fell, and a rap was heard at the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" said Monte Cristo with a voice that betrayed not the\nleast emotion; and immediately Beauchamp appeared. \"Good-evening, M.\nBeauchamp,\" said Monte Cristo, as if this was the first time he had seen\nthe journalist that evening; \"be seated.\"\n\nBeauchamp bowed, and, sitting down, \"Sir,\" said he, \"I just now\naccompanied M. de Morcerf, as you saw.\"\n\n\"And that means,\" replied Monte Cristo, laughing, \"that you had,\nprobably, just dined together. I am happy to see, M. Beauchamp, that you\nare more sober than he was.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said M. Beauchamp, \"Albert was wrong, I acknowledge, to betray\nso much anger, and I come, on my own account, to apologize for him. And\nhaving done so, entirely on my own account, be it understood, I would\nadd that I believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some\nexplanation concerning your connection with Yanina. Then I will add\ntwo words about the young Greek girl.\" Monte Cristo motioned him to be\nsilent. \"Come,\" said he, laughing, \"there are all my hopes about to be\ndestroyed.\"\n\n\"How so?\" asked Beauchamp.\n\n\"Doubtless you wish to make me appear a very eccentric character. I am,\nin your opinion, a Lara, a Manfred, a Lord Ruthven; then, just as I am\narriving at the climax, you defeat your own end, and seek to make an\nordinary man of me. You bring me down to your own level, and demand\nexplanations! Indeed, M. Beauchamp, it is quite laughable.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" replied Beauchamp haughtily, \"there are occasions when probity\ncommands\"--\n\n\"M. Beauchamp,\" interposed this strange man, \"the Count of Monte Cristo\nbows to none but the Count of Monte Cristo himself. Say no more, I\nentreat you. I do what I please, M. Beauchamp, and it is always well\ndone.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied the young man, \"honest men are not to be paid with such\ncoin. I require honorable guaranties.\"\n\n\"I am, sir, a living guaranty,\" replied Monte Cristo, motionless, but\nwith a threatening look; \"we have both blood in our veins which we wish\nto shed--that is our mutual guaranty. Tell the viscount so, and that\nto-morrow, before ten o'clock, I shall see what color his is.\"\n\n\"Then I have only to make arrangements for the duel,\" said Beauchamp.\n\n\"It is quite immaterial to me,\" said Monte Cristo, \"and it was very\nunnecessary to disturb me at the opera for such a trifle. In France\npeople fight with the sword or pistol, in the colonies with the carbine,\nin Arabia with the dagger. Tell your client that, although I am the\ninsulted party, in order to carry out my eccentricity, I leave him the\nchoice of arms, and will accept without discussion, without dispute,\nanything, even combat by drawing lots, which is always stupid, but with\nme different from other people, as I am sure to gain.\"\n\n\"Sure to gain!\" repeated Beauchamp, looking with amazement at the count.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Monte Cristo, slightly shrugging his shoulders;\n\"otherwise I would not fight with M. de Morcerf. I shall kill him--I\ncannot help it. Only by a single line this evening at my house let me\nknow the arms and the hour; I do not like to be kept waiting.\"\n\n\"Pistols, then, at eight o'clock, in the Bois de Vincennes,\" said\nBeauchamp, quite disconcerted, not knowing if he was dealing with an\narrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being.\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" said Monte Cristo. \"Now all that is settled, do let\nme see the performance, and tell your friend Albert not to come any more\nthis evening; he will hurt himself with all his ill-chosen barbarisms:\nlet him go home and go to sleep.\" Beauchamp left the box, perfectly\namazed. \"Now,\" said Monte Cristo, turning towards Morrel, \"I may depend\nupon you, may I not?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Morrel, \"I am at your service, count; still\"--\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It is desirable I should know the real cause.\"\n\n\"That is to say, you would rather not?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"The young man himself is acting blindfolded, and knows not the true\ncause, which is known only to God and to me; but I give you my word,\nMorrel, that God, who does know it, will be on our side.\"\n\n\"Enough,\" said Morrel; \"who is your second witness?\"\n\n\"I know no one in Paris, Morrel, on whom I could confer that honor\nbesides you and your brother Emmanuel. Do you think Emmanuel would\noblige me?\"\n\n\"I will answer for him, count.\"\n\n\"Well? that is all I require. To-morrow morning, at seven o'clock, you\nwill be with me, will you not?\"\n\n\"We will.\"\n\n\"Hush, the curtain is rising. Listen! I never lose a note of this opera\nif I can avoid it; the music of William Tell is so sweet.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 89. A Nocturnal Interview.\n\nMonte Cristo waited, according to his usual custom, until Duprez had\nsung his famous \"Suivez-moi;\" then he rose and went out. Morrel took\nleave of him at the door, renewing his promise to be with him the next\nmorning at seven o'clock, and to bring Emmanuel. Then he stepped into\nhis coupe, calm and smiling, and was at home in five minutes. No one who\nknew the count could mistake his expression when, on entering, he said,\n\"Ali, bring me my pistols with the ivory cross.\"\n\nAli brought the box to his master, who examined the weapons with a\nsolicitude very natural to a man who is about to intrust his life to a\nlittle powder and shot. These were pistols of an especial pattern, which\nMonte Cristo had had made for target practice in his own room. A cap was\nsufficient to drive out the bullet, and from the adjoining room no one\nwould have suspected that the count was, as sportsmen would say, keeping\nhis hand in. He was just taking one up and looking for the point to aim\nat on a little iron plate which served him as a target, when his study\ndoor opened, and Baptistin entered. Before he had spoken a word, the\ncount saw in the next room a veiled woman, who had followed closely\nafter Baptistin, and now, seeing the count with a pistol in his hand and\nswords on the table, rushed in. Baptistin looked at his master, who made\na sign to him, and he went out, closing the door after him. \"Who are\nyou, madame?\" said the count to the veiled woman.\n\nThe stranger cast one look around her, to be certain that they were\nquite alone; then bending as if she would have knelt, and joining her\nhands, she said with an accent of despair, \"Edmond, you will not kill my\nson?\" The count retreated a step, uttered a slight exclamation, and let\nfall the pistol he held. \"What name did you pronounce then, Madame de\nMorcerf?\" said he. \"Yours!\" cried she, throwing back her veil,--\"yours,\nwhich I alone, perhaps, have not forgotten. Edmond, it is not Madame de\nMorcerf who is come to you, it is Mercedes.\"\n\n\"Mercedes is dead, madame,\" said Monte Cristo; \"I know no one now of\nthat name.\"\n\n\"Mercedes lives, sir, and she remembers, for she alone recognized\nyou when she saw you, and even before she saw you, by your voice,\nEdmond,--by the simple sound of your voice; and from that moment she\nhas followed your steps, watched you, feared you, and she needs not to\ninquire what hand has dealt the blow which now strikes M. de Morcerf.\"\n\n\"Fernand, do you mean?\" replied Monte Cristo, with bitter irony; \"since\nwe are recalling names, let us remember them all.\" Monte Cristo had\npronounced the name of Fernand with such an expression of hatred that\nMercedes felt a thrill of horror run through every vein. \"You see,\nEdmond, I am not mistaken, and have cause to say, 'Spare my son!'\"\n\n\"And who told you, madame, that I have any hostile intentions against\nyour son?\"\n\n\"No one, in truth; but a mother has twofold sight. I guessed all; I\nfollowed him this evening to the opera, and, concealed in a parquet box,\nhave seen all.\"\n\n\"If you have seen all, madame, you know that the son of Fernand has\npublicly insulted me,\" said Monte Cristo with awful calmness.\n\n\"Oh, for pity's sake!\"\n\n\"You have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my face if Morrel,\none of my friends, had not stopped him.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, my son has also guessed who you are,--he attributes his\nfather's misfortunes to you.\"\n\n\"Madame, you are mistaken, they are not misfortunes,--it is a\npunishment. It is not I who strike M. de Morcerf; it is providence which\npunishes him.\"\n\n\"And why do you represent providence?\" cried Mercedes. \"Why do you\nremember when it forgets? What are Yanina and its vizier to you, Edmond?\nWhat injury his Fernand Mondego done you in betraying Ali Tepelini?\"\n\n\"Ah, madame,\" replied Monte Cristo, \"all this is an affair between the\nFrench captain and the daughter of Vasiliki. It does not concern me,\nyou are right; and if I have sworn to revenge myself, it is not on the\nFrench captain, or the Count of Morcerf, but on the fisherman Fernand,\nthe husband of Mercedes the Catalane.\"\n\n\"Ah, sir!\" cried the countess, \"how terrible a vengeance for a fault\nwhich fatality made me commit!--for I am the only culprit, Edmond, and\nif you owe revenge to any one, it is to me, who had not fortitude to\nbear your absence and my solitude.\"\n\n\"But,\" exclaimed Monte Cristo, \"why was I absent? And why were you\nalone?\"\n\n\"Because you had been arrested, Edmond, and were a prisoner.\"\n\n\"And why was I arrested? Why was I a prisoner?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said Mercedes. \"You do not, madame; at least, I hope\nnot. But I will tell you. I was arrested and became a prisoner because,\nunder the arbor of La Reserve, the day before I was to marry you, a man\nnamed Danglars wrote this letter, which the fisherman Fernand himself\nposted.\" Monte Cristo went to a secretary, opened a drawer by a spring,\nfrom which he took a paper which had lost its original color, and the\nink of which had become of a rusty hue--this he placed in the hands\nof Mercedes. It was Danglars' letter to the king's attorney, which the\nCount of Monte Cristo, disguised as a clerk from the house of Thomson &\nFrench, had taken from the file against Edmond Dantes, on the day he\nhad paid the two hundred thousand francs to M. de Boville. Mercedes read\nwith terror the following lines:--\n\n\"The king's attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and religion\nthat one Edmond Dantes, second in command on board the Pharaon, this day\narrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo,\nis the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and of another\nletter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample\ncorroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the\nabove-mentioned Edmond Dantes, who either carries the letter for Paris\nabout with him, or has it at his father's abode. Should it not be\nfound in possession of either father or son, then it will assuredly\nbe discovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dantes on board the\nPharaon.\"\n\n\"How dreadful!\" said Mercedes, passing her hand across her brow, moist\nwith perspiration; \"and that letter\"--\n\n\"I bought it for two hundred thousand francs, madame,\" said Monte\nCristo; \"but that is a trifle, since it enables me to justify myself to\nyou.\"\n\n\"And the result of that letter\"--\n\n\"You well know, madame, was my arrest; but you do not know how long that\narrest lasted. You do not know that I remained for fourteen years within\na quarter of a league of you, in a dungeon in the Chateau d'If. You do\nnot know that every day of those fourteen years I renewed the vow of\nvengeance which I had made the first day; and yet I was not aware that\nyou had married Fernand, my calumniator, and that my father had died of\nhunger!\"\n\n\"Can it be?\" cried Mercedes, shuddering.\n\n\"That is what I heard on leaving my prison fourteen years after I had\nentered it; and that is why, on account of the living Mercedes and my\ndeceased father, I have sworn to revenge myself on Fernand, and--I have\nrevenged myself.\"\n\n\"And you are sure the unhappy Fernand did that?\"\n\n\"I am satisfied, madame, that he did what I have told you; besides, that\nis not much more odious than that a Frenchman by adoption should pass\nover to the English; that a Spaniard by birth should have fought against\nthe Spaniards; that a stipendiary of Ali should have betrayed and\nmurdered Ali. Compared with such things, what is the letter you have\njust read?--a lover's deception, which the woman who has married that\nman ought certainly to forgive; but not so the lover who was to have\nmarried her. Well, the French did not avenge themselves on the traitor,\nthe Spaniards did not shoot the traitor, Ali in his tomb left the\ntraitor unpunished; but I, betrayed, sacrificed, buried, have risen from\nmy tomb, by the grace of God, to punish that man. He sends me for that\npurpose, and here I am.\" The poor woman's head and arms fell; her legs\nbent under her, and she fell on her knees. \"Forgive, Edmond, forgive for\nmy sake, who love you still!\"\n\nThe dignity of the wife checked the fervor of the lover and the mother.\nHer forehead almost touched the carpet, when the count sprang forward\nand raised her. Then seated on a chair, she looked at the manly\ncountenance of Monte Cristo, on which grief and hatred still impressed\na threatening expression. \"Not crush that accursed race?\" murmured he;\n\"abandon my purpose at the moment of its accomplishment? Impossible,\nmadame, impossible!\"\n\n\"Edmond,\" said the poor mother, who tried every means, \"when I call you\nEdmond, why do you not call me Mercedes?\"\n\n\"Mercedes!\" repeated Monte Cristo; \"Mercedes! Well yes, you are right;\nthat name has still its charms, and this is the first time for a long\nperiod that I have pronounced it so distinctly. Oh, Mercedes, I have\nuttered your name with the sigh of melancholy, with the groan of sorrow,\nwith the last effort of despair; I have uttered it when frozen with\ncold, crouched on the straw in my dungeon; I have uttered it, consumed\nwith heat, rolling on the stone floor of my prison. Mercedes, I must\nrevenge myself, for I suffered fourteen years,--fourteen years I wept, I\ncursed; now I tell you, Mercedes, I must revenge myself.\"\n\nThe count, fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently\nloved, called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred. \"Revenge\nyourself, then, Edmond,\" cried the poor mother; \"but let your vengeance\nfall on the culprits,--on him, on me, but not on my son!\"\n\n\"It is written in the good book,\" said Monte Cristo, \"that the sins\nof the fathers shall fall upon their children to the third and fourth\ngeneration. Since God himself dictated those words to his prophet, why\nshould I seek to make myself better than God?\"\n\n\"Edmond,\" continued Mercedes, with her arms extended towards the count,\n\"since I first knew you, I have adored your name, have respected your\nmemory. Edmond, my friend, do not compel me to tarnish that noble and\npure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my heart. Edmond, if\nyou knew all the prayers I have addressed to God for you while I thought\nyou were living and since I have thought you must be dead! Yes, dead,\nalas! I imagined your dead body buried at the foot of some gloomy tower,\nor cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful jailers, and I wept! What\ncould I do for you, Edmond, besides pray and weep? Listen; for ten\nyears I dreamed each night the same dream. I had been told that you had\nendeavored to escape; that you had taken the place of another prisoner;\nthat you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead body; that you had\nbeen thrown alive from the top of the Chateau d'If, and that the cry you\nuttered as you dashed upon the rocks first revealed to your jailers that\nthey were your murderers. Well, Edmond, I swear to you, by the head\nof that son for whom I entreat your pity,--Edmond, for ten years I saw\nevery night every detail of that frightful tragedy, and for ten years\nI heard every night the cry which awoke me, shuddering and cold. And\nI, too, Edmond--oh! believe me--guilty as I was--oh, yes, I, too, have\nsuffered much!\"\n\n\"Have you known what it is to have your father starve to death in your\nabsence?\" cried Monte Cristo, thrusting his hands into his hair; \"have\nyou seen the woman you loved giving her hand to your rival, while you\nwere perishing at the bottom of a dungeon?\"\n\n\"No,\" interrupted Mercedes, \"but I have seen him whom I loved on the\npoint of murdering my son.\" Mercedes uttered these words with such deep\nanguish, with an accent of such intense despair, that Monte Cristo could\nnot restrain a sob. The lion was daunted; the avenger was conquered.\n\"What do you ask of me?\" said he,--\"your son's life? Well, he shall\nlive!\" Mercedes uttered a cry which made the tears start from Monte\nCristo's eyes; but these tears disappeared almost instantaneously, for,\ndoubtless, God had sent some angel to collect them--far more precious\nwere they in his eyes than the richest pearls of Guzerat and Ophir.\n\n\"Oh,\" said she, seizing the count's hand and raising it to her lips;\n\"oh, thank you, thank you, Edmond! Now you are exactly what I dreamt you\nwere,--the man I always loved. Oh, now I may say so!\"\n\n\"So much the better,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"as that poor Edmond will\nnot have long to be loved by you. Death is about to return to the tomb,\nthe phantom to retire in darkness.\"\n\n\"What do you say, Edmond?\"\n\n\"I say, since you command me, Mercedes, I must die.\"\n\n\"Die? and why so? Who talks of dying? Whence have you these ideas of\ndeath?\"\n\n\"You do not suppose that, publicly outraged in the face of a\nwhole theatre, in the presence of your friends and those of your\nson--challenged by a boy who will glory in my forgiveness as if it were\na victory--you do not suppose that I can for one moment wish to live.\nWhat I most loved after you, Mercedes, was myself, my dignity, and that\nstrength which rendered me superior to other men; that strength was my\nlife. With one word you have crushed it, and I die.\"\n\n\"But the duel will not take place, Edmond, since you forgive?\"\n\n\"It will take place,\" said Monte Cristo, in a most solemn tone; \"but\ninstead of your son's blood to stain the ground, mine will flow.\"\nMercedes shrieked, and sprang towards Monte Cristo, but, suddenly\nstopping, \"Edmond,\" said she, \"there is a God above us, since you live\nand since I have seen you again; I trust to him from my heart. While\nwaiting his assistance I trust to your word; you have said that my son\nshould live, have you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, madame, he shall live,\" said Monte Cristo, surprised that without\nmore emotion Mercedes had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her.\nMercedes extended her hand to the count.\n\n\"Edmond,\" said she, and her eyes were wet with tears while looking at\nhim to whom she spoke, \"how noble it is of you, how great the action you\nhave just performed, how sublime to have taken pity on a poor woman who\nappealed to you with every chance against her, Alas, I am grown old with\ngrief more than with years, and cannot now remind my Edmond by a smile,\nor by a look, of that Mercedes whom he once spent so many hours in\ncontemplating. Ah, believe me, Edmond, as I told you, I too have\nsuffered much; I repeat, it is melancholy to pass one's life without\nhaving one joy to recall, without preserving a single hope; but that\nproves that all is not yet over. No, it is not finished; I feel it by\nwhat remains in my heart. Oh, I repeat it, Edmond; what you have just\ndone is beautiful--it is grand; it is sublime.\"\n\n\"Do you say so now, Mercedes?--then what would you say if you knew the\nextent of the sacrifice I make to you? Suppose that the Supreme Being,\nafter having created the world and fertilized chaos, had paused in the\nwork to spare an angel the tears that might one day flow for mortal sins\nfrom her immortal eyes; suppose that when everything was in readiness\nand the moment had come for God to look upon his work and see that it\nwas good--suppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the world back\ninto eternal night--then--even then, Mercedes, you could not imagine\nwhat I lose in sacrificing my life at this moment.\" Mercedes looked at\nthe count in a way which expressed at the same time her astonishment,\nher admiration, and her gratitude. Monte Cristo pressed his forehead on\nhis burning hands, as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight\nof its thoughts. \"Edmond,\" said Mercedes, \"I have but one word more to\nsay to you.\" The count smiled bitterly. \"Edmond,\" continued she, \"you\nwill see that if my face is pale, if my eyes are dull, if my beauty is\ngone; if Mercedes, in short, no longer resembles her former self in her\nfeatures, you will see that her heart is still the same. Adieu, then,\nEdmond; I have nothing more to ask of heaven--I have seen you again,\nand have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were. Adieu,\nEdmond, adieu, and thank you.\"\n\nBut the count did not answer. Mercedes opened the door of the study and\nhad disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound\nrevery into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him. The clock\nof the Invalides struck one when the carriage which conveyed Madame\nde Morcerf away rolled on the pavement of the Champs-Elysees, and made\nMonte Cristo raise his head. \"What a fool I was,\" said he, \"not to tear\nmy heart out on the day when I resolved to avenge myself!\"\n\n\n\nChapter 90. The Meeting.\n\nAfter Mercedes had left Monte Cristo, he fell into profound gloom.\nAround him and within him the flight of thought seemed to have stopped;\nhis energetic mind slumbered, as the body does after extreme fatigue.\n\"What?\" said he to himself, while the lamp and the wax lights were\nnearly burnt out, and the servants were waiting impatiently in the\nanteroom; \"what? this edifice which I have been so long preparing, which\nI have reared with so much care and toil, is to be crushed by a single\ntouch, a word, a breath! Yes, this self, of whom I thought so much, of\nwhom I was so proud, who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of\nthe Chateau d'If, and whom I had succeeded in making so great, will be\nbut a lump of clay to-morrow. Alas, it is not the death of the body I\nregret; for is not the destruction of the vital principle, the repose to\nwhich everything is tending, to which every unhappy being aspires,--is\nnot this the repose of matter after which I so long sighed, and which\nI was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when Faria\nappeared in my dungeon? What is death for me? One step farther into\nrest,--two, perhaps, into silence.\n\n\"No, it is not existence, then, that I regret, but the ruin of projects\nso slowly carried out, so laboriously framed. Providence is now opposed\nto them, when I most thought it would be propitious. It is not God's\nwill that they should be accomplished. This burden, almost as heavy as a\nworld, which I had raised, and I had thought to bear to the end, was too\ngreat for my strength, and I was compelled to lay it down in the middle\nof my career. Oh, shall I then, again become a fatalist, whom fourteen\nyears of despair and ten of hope had rendered a believer in providence?\nAnd all this--all this, because my heart, which I thought dead, was only\nsleeping; because it has awakened and has begun to beat again, because\nI have yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a\nwoman's voice. Yet,\" continued the count, becoming each moment more\nabsorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow,\nwhich Mercedes had accepted, \"yet, it is impossible that so noble-minded\na woman should thus through selfishness consent to my death when I am in\nthe prime of life and strength; it is impossible that she can carry to\nsuch a point maternal love, or rather delirium. There are virtues which\nbecome crimes by exaggeration. No, she must have conceived some pathetic\nscene; she will come and throw herself between us; and what would be\nsublime here will there appear ridiculous.\" The blush of pride mounted\nto the count's forehead as this thought passed through his mind.\n\"Ridiculous?\" repeated he; \"and the ridicule will fall on me. I\nridiculous? No, I would rather die.\"\n\nBy thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill-fortune of the\nnext day, to which he had condemned himself by promising Mercedes to\nspare her son, the count at last exclaimed, \"Folly, folly, folly!--to\ncarry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young man\nto aim at. He will never believe that my death was suicide; and yet it\nis important for the honor of my memory,--and this surely is not vanity,\nbut a justifiable pride,--it is important the world should know that\nI have consented, by my free will, to stop my arm, already raised to\nstrike, and that with the arm which has been so powerful against others\nI have struck myself. It must be; it shall be.\"\n\nSeizing a pen, he drew a paper from a secret drawer in his desk, and\nwrote at the bottom of the document (which was no other than his will,\nmade since his arrival in Paris) a sort of codicil, clearly explaining\nthe nature of his death. \"I do this, O my God,\" said he, with his eyes\nraised to heaven, \"as much for thy honor as for mine. I have during ten\nyears considered myself the agent of thy vengeance, and other wretches,\nlike Morcerf, Danglars, Villefort, even Morcerf himself, must not\nimagine that chance has freed them from their enemy. Let them know,\non the contrary, that their punishment, which had been decreed by\nprovidence, is only delayed by my present determination, and although\nthey escape it in this world, it awaits them in another, and that they\nare only exchanging time for eternity.\"\n\nWhile he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties,--wretched waking\ndreams of grief,--the first rays of morning pierced his windows, and\nshone upon the pale blue paper on which he had just inscribed his\njustification of providence. It was just five o'clock in the morning\nwhen a slight noise like a stifled sigh reached his ear. He turned his\nhead, looked around him, and saw no one; but the sound was repeated\ndistinctly enough to convince him of its reality.\n\nHe arose, and quietly opening the door of the drawing-room, saw Haidee,\nwho had fallen on a chair, with her arms hanging down and her beautiful\nhead thrown back. She had been standing at the door, to prevent his\ngoing out without seeing her, until sleep, which the young cannot\nresist, had overpowered her frame, wearied as she was with watching. The\nnoise of the door did not awaken her, and Monte Cristo gazed at her with\naffectionate regret. \"She remembered that she had a son,\" said he; \"and\nI forgot I had a daughter.\" Then, shaking his head sorrowfully, \"Poor\nHaidee,\" said he; \"she wished to see me, to speak to me; she has feared\nor guessed something. Oh, I cannot go without taking leave of her; I\ncannot die without confiding her to some one.\" He quietly regained his\nseat, and wrote under the other lines:--\n\n\"I bequeath to Maximilian Morrel, captain of Spahis,--and son of my\nformer patron, Pierre Morrel, shipowner at Marseilles,--the sum of\ntwenty millions, a part of which may be offered to his sister Julia and\nbrother-in-law Emmanuel, if he does not fear this increase of fortune\nmay mar their happiness. These twenty millions are concealed in my\ngrotto at Monte Cristo, of which Bertuccio knows the secret. If his\nheart is free, and he will marry Haidee, the daughter of Ali Pasha of\nYanina, whom I have brought up with the love of a father, and who\nhas shown the love and tenderness of a daughter for me, he will thus\naccomplish my last wish. This will has already constituted Haidee\nheiress of the rest of my fortune, consisting of lands, funds in\nEngland, Austria, and Holland, furniture in my different palaces and\nhouses, and which without the twenty millions and the legacies to my\nservants, may still amount to sixty millions.\"\n\nHe was finishing the last line when a cry behind him made him start, and\nthe pen fell from his hand. \"Haidee,\" said he, \"did you read it?\"\n\n\"Oh, my lord,\" said she, \"why are you writing thus at such an hour? Why\nare you bequeathing all your fortune to me? Are you going to leave me?\"\n\n\"I am going on a journey, dear child,\" said Monte Cristo, with an\nexpression of infinite tenderness and melancholy; \"and if any misfortune\nshould happen to me.\"\n\nThe count stopped. \"Well?\" asked the young girl, with an authoritative\ntone the count had never observed before, and which startled him.\n\"Well, if any misfortune happen to me,\" replied Monte Cristo, \"I wish\nmy daughter to be happy.\" Haidee smiled sorrowfully, and shook her head.\n\"Do you think of dying, my lord?\" said she.\n\n\"The wise man, my child, has said, 'It is good to think of death.'\"\n\n\"Well, if you die,\" said she, \"bequeath your fortune to others, for if\nyou die I shall require nothing;\" and, taking the paper, she tore it in\nfour pieces, and threw it into the middle of the room. Then, the effort\nhaving exhausted her strength, she fell not asleep this time, but\nfainting on the floor. The count leaned over her and raised her in his\narms; and seeing that sweet pale face, those lovely eyes closed, that\nbeautiful form motionless and to all appearance lifeless, the idea\noccurred to him for the first time, that perhaps she loved him otherwise\nthan as a daughter loves a father.\n\n\"Alas,\" murmured he, with intense suffering, \"I might, then, have been\nhappy yet.\" Then he carried Haidee to her room, resigned her to the care\nof her attendants, and returning to his study, which he shut quickly\nthis time, he again copied the destroyed will. As he was finishing,\nthe sound of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard. Monte Cristo\napproached the window, and saw Maximilian and Emmanuel alight. \"Good,\"\nsaid he; \"it was time,\"--and he sealed his will with three seals. A\nmoment afterwards he heard a noise in the drawing-room, and went to open\nthe door himself. Morrel was there; he had come twenty minutes before\nthe time appointed. \"I am perhaps come too soon, count,\" said he, \"but\nI frankly acknowledge that I have not closed my eyes all night, nor\nhas any one in my house. I need to see you strong in your courageous\nassurance, to recover myself.\" Monte Cristo could not resist this proof\nof affection; he not only extended his hand to the young man, but flew\nto him with open arms. \"Morrel,\" said he, \"it is a happy day for me, to\nfeel that I am beloved by such a man as you. Good-morning, Emmanuel; you\nwill come with me then, Maximilian?\"\n\n\"Did you doubt it?\" said the young captain.\n\n\"But if I were wrong\"--\n\n\"I watched you during the whole scene of that challenge yesterday; I\nhave been thinking of your firmness all night, and I said to myself that\njustice must be on your side, or man's countenance is no longer to be\nrelied on.\"\n\n\"But, Morrel, Albert is your friend?\"\n\n\"Simply an acquaintance, sir.\"\n\n\"You met on the same day you first saw me?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is true; but I should not have recollected it if you had not\nreminded me.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Morrel.\" Then ringing the bell once, \"Look.\" said he to Ali,\nwho came immediately, \"take that to my solicitor. It is my will, Morrel.\nWhen I am dead, you will go and examine it.\"\n\n\"What?\" said Morrel, \"you dead?\"\n\n\"Yes; must I not be prepared for everything, dear friend? But what did\nyou do yesterday after you left me?\"\n\n\"I went to Tortoni's, where, as I expected, I found Beauchamp and\nChateau-Renaud. I own I was seeking them.\"\n\n\"Why, when all was arranged?\"\n\n\"Listen, count; the affair is serious and unavoidable.\"\n\n\"Did you doubt it!\"\n\n\"No; the offence was public, and every one is already talking of it.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, I hoped to get an exchange of arms,--to substitute the sword for\nthe pistol; the pistol is blind.\"\n\n\"Have you succeeded?\" asked Monte Cristo quickly, with an imperceptible\ngleam of hope.\n\n\"No; for your skill with the sword is so well known.\"\n\n\"Ah?--who has betrayed me?\"\n\n\"The skilful swordsman whom you have conquered.\"\n\n\"And you failed?\"\n\n\"They positively refused.\"\n\n\"Morrel,\" said the count, \"have you ever seen me fire a pistol?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Well, we have time; look.\" Monte Cristo took the pistols he held in his\nhand when Mercedes entered, and fixing an ace of clubs against the iron\nplate, with four shots he successively shot off the four sides of the\nclub. At each shot Morrel turned pale. He examined the bullets with\nwhich Monte Cristo performed this dexterous feat, and saw that they were\nno larger than buckshot. \"It is astonishing,\" said he. \"Look, Emmanuel.\"\nThen turning towards Monte Cristo, \"Count,\" said he, \"in the name of\nall that is dear to you, I entreat you not to kill Albert!--the unhappy\nyouth has a mother.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said Monte Cristo; \"and I have none.\" These words\nwere uttered in a tone which made Morrel shudder. \"You are the offended\nparty, count.\"\n\n\"Doubtless; what does that imply?\"\n\n\"That you will fire first.\"\n\n\"I fire first?\"\n\n\"Oh, I obtained, or rather claimed that; we had conceded enough for them\nto yield us that.\"\n\n\"And at what distance?\"\n\n\"Twenty paces.\" A smile of terrible import passed over the count's lips.\n\"Morrel,\" said he, \"do not forget what you have just seen.\"\n\n\"The only chance for Albert's safety, then, will arise from your\nemotion.\"\n\n\"I suffer from emotion?\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Or from your generosity, my friend; to so good a marksman as you are, I\nmay say what would appear absurd to another.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Break his arm--wound him--but do not kill him.\"\n\n\"I will tell you, Morrel,\" said the count, \"that I do not need\nentreating to spare the life of M. de Morcerf; he shall be so well\nspared, that he will return quietly with his two friends, while I\"--\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"That will be another thing; I shall be brought home.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" cried Maximilian, quite unable to restrain his feelings.\n\n\"As I told you, my dear Morrel, M. de Morcerf will kill me.\" Morrel\nlooked at him in utter amazement. \"But what has happened, then, since\nlast evening, count?\"\n\n\"The same thing that happened to Brutus the night before the battle of\nPhilippi; I have seen a ghost.\"\n\n\"And that ghost\"--\n\n\"Told me, Morrel, that I had lived long enough.\" Maximilian and Emmanuel\nlooked at each other. Monte Cristo drew out his watch. \"Let us go,\" said\nhe; \"it is five minutes past seven, and the appointment was for eight\no'clock.\" A carriage was in readiness at the door. Monte Cristo stepped\ninto it with his two friends. He had stopped a moment in the passage\nto listen at a door, and Maximilian and Emmanuel, who had considerately\npassed forward a few steps, thought they heard him answer by a sigh to a\nsob from within. As the clock struck eight they drove up to the place of\nmeeting. \"We are first,\" said Morrel, looking out of the window. \"Excuse\nme, sir,\" said Baptistin, who had followed his master with indescribable\nterror, \"but I think I see a carriage down there under the trees.\"\n\nMonte Cristo sprang lightly from the carriage, and offered his hand to\nassist Emmanuel and Maximilian. The latter retained the count's hand\nbetween his. \"I like,\" said he, \"to feel a hand like this, when its\nowner relies on the goodness of his cause.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Emmanuel, \"that I see two young men down there,\nwho are evidently, waiting.\" Monte Cristo drew Morrel a step or two\nbehind his brother-in-law. \"Maximilian,\" said he, \"are your affections\ndisengaged?\" Morrel looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment. \"I do not\nseek your confidence, my dear friend. I only ask you a simple question;\nanswer it;--that is all I require.\"\n\n\"I love a young girl, count.\"\n\n\"Do you love her much?\"\n\n\"More than my life.\"\n\n\"Another hope defeated!\" said the count. Then, with a sigh, \"Poor\nHaidee!\" murmured he.\n\n\"To tell the truth, count, if I knew less of you, I should think that\nyou were less brave than you are.\"\n\n\"Because I sigh when thinking of some one I am leaving? Come, Morrel, it\nis not like a soldier to be so bad a judge of courage. Do I regret life?\nWhat is it to me, who have passed twenty years between life and death?\nMoreover, do not alarm yourself, Morrel; this weakness, if it is such,\nis betrayed to you alone. I know the world is a drawing-room, from which\nwe must retire politely and honestly; that is, with a bow, and our debts\nof honor paid.\"\n\n\"That is to the purpose. Have you brought your arms?\"\n\n\"I?--what for? I hope these gentlemen have theirs.\"\n\n\"I will inquire,\" said Morrel.\n\n\"Do; but make no treaty--you understand me?\"\n\n\"You need not fear.\" Morrel advanced towards Beauchamp and\nChateau-Renaud, who, seeing his intention, came to meet him. The three\nyoung men bowed to each other courteously, if not affably.\n\n\"Excuse me, gentlemen,\" said Morrel, \"but I do not see M. de Morcerf.\"\n\n\"He sent us word this morning,\" replied Chateau-Renaud, \"that he would\nmeet us on the ground.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Morrel. Beauchamp pulled out his watch. \"It is only five\nminutes past eight,\" said he to Morrel; \"there is not much time lost\nyet.\"\n\n\"Oh, I made no allusion of that kind,\" replied Morrel.\n\n\"There is a carriage coming,\" said Chateau-Renaud. It advanced rapidly\nalong one of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were\nassembled. \"You are doubtless provided with pistols, gentlemen? M. de\nMonte Cristo yields his right of using his.\"\n\n\"We had anticipated this kindness on the part of the count,\" said\nBeauchamp, \"and I have brought some weapons which I bought eight or ten\ndays since, thinking to want them on a similar occasion. They are quite\nnew, and have not yet been used. Will you examine them.\"\n\n\"Oh, M. Beauchamp, if you assure me that M. de Morcerf does not know\nthese pistols, you may readily believe that your word will be quite\nsufficient.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"it is not Morcerf coming in that\ncarriage;--faith, it is Franz and Debray!\" The two young men he\nannounced were indeed approaching. \"What chance brings you here,\ngentlemen?\" said Chateau-Renaud, shaking hands with each of them.\n\"Because,\" said Debray, \"Albert sent this morning to request us to\ncome.\" Beauchamp and Chateau-Renaud exchanged looks of astonishment. \"I\nthink I understand his reason,\" said Morrel.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Yesterday afternoon I received a letter from M. de Morcerf, begging me\nto attend the opera.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Debray.\n\n\"And I also,\" said Franz.\n\n\"And we, too,\" added Beauchamp and Chateau-Renaud.\n\n\"Having wished you all to witness the challenge, he now wishes you to be\npresent at the combat.\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" said the young men; \"you have probably guessed right.\"\n\n\"But, after all these arrangements, he does not come himself,\" said\nChateau-Renaud. \"Albert is ten minutes after time.\"\n\n\"There he comes,\" said Beauchamp, \"on horseback, at full gallop,\nfollowed by a servant.\"\n\n\"How imprudent,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"to come on horseback to fight a\nduel with pistols, after all the instructions I had given him.\"\n\n\"And besides,\" said Beauchamp, \"with a collar above his cravat, an\nopen coat and white waistcoat! Why has he not painted a spot upon his\nheart?--it would have been more simple.\" Meanwhile Albert had arrived\nwithin ten paces of the group formed by the five young men. He jumped\nfrom his horse, threw the bridle on his servant's arms, and joined them.\nHe was pale, and his eyes were red and swollen; it was evident that he\nhad not slept. A shade of melancholy gravity overspread his countenance,\nwhich was not natural to him. \"I thank you, gentlemen,\" said he, \"for\nhaving complied with my request; I feel extremely grateful for this\nmark of friendship.\" Morrel had stepped back as Morcerf approached, and\nremained at a short distance. \"And to you also, M. Morrel, my thanks are\ndue. Come, there cannot be too many.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Maximilian, \"you are not perhaps aware that I am M. de Monte\nCristo's friend?\"\n\n\"I was not sure, but I thought it might be so. So much the better; the\nmore honorable men there are here the better I shall be satisfied.\"\n\n\"M. Morrel,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"will you apprise the Count of Monte\nCristo that M. de Morcerf is arrived, and we are at his disposal?\"\nMorrel was preparing to fulfil his commission. Beauchamp had meanwhile\ndrawn the box of pistols from the carriage. \"Stop, gentlemen,\" said\nAlbert; \"I have two words to say to the Count of Monte Cristo.\"\n\n\"In private?\" asked Morrel.\n\n\"No, sir; before all who are here.\"\n\nAlbert's witnesses looked at each other. Franz and Debray exchanged some\nwords in a whisper, and Morrel, rejoiced at this unexpected incident,\nwent to fetch the count, who was walking in a retired path with\nEmmanuel. \"What does he want with me?\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"I do not know, but he wishes to speak to you.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" said Monte Cristo, \"I trust he is not going to tempt me by some\nfresh insult!\"\n\n\"I do not think that such is his intention,\" said Morrel.\n\nThe count advanced, accompanied by Maximilian and Emmanuel. His calm and\nserene look formed a singular contrast to Albert's grief-stricken face,\nwho approached also, followed by the other four young men. When at three\npaces distant from each other, Albert and the count stopped.\n\n\"Approach, gentlemen,\" said Albert; \"I wish you not to lose one word\nof what I am about to have the honor of saying to the Count of Monte\nCristo, for it must be repeated by you to all who will listen to it,\nstrange as it may appear to you.\"\n\n\"Proceed, sir,\" said the count.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Albert, at first with a tremulous voice, but which gradually\nbecame firmer, \"I reproached you with exposing the conduct of M. de\nMorcerf in Epirus, for guilty as I knew he was, I thought you had no\nright to punish him; but I have since learned that you had that right.\nIt is not Fernand Mondego's treachery towards Ali Pasha which induces\nme so readily to excuse you, but the treachery of the fisherman\nFernand towards you, and the almost unheard-of miseries which were\nits consequences; and I say, and proclaim it publicly, that you were\njustified in revenging yourself on my father, and I, his son, thank you\nfor not using greater severity.\"\n\nHad a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this\nunexpected scene, it would not have surprised them more than did\nAlbert's declaration. As for Monte Cristo, his eyes slowly rose towards\nheaven with an expression of infinite gratitude. He could not understand\nhow Albert's fiery nature, of which he had seen so much among the Roman\nbandits, had suddenly stooped to this humiliation. He recognized the\ninfluence of Mercedes, and saw why her noble heart had not opposed the\nsacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless. \"Now, sir,\" said Albert,\n\"if you think my apology sufficient, pray give me your hand. Next to\nthe merit of infallibility which you appear to possess, I rank that of\ncandidly acknowledging a fault. But this confession concerns me only. I\nacted well as a man, but you have acted better than man. An angel alone\ncould have saved one of us from death--that angel came from heaven, if\nnot to make us friends (which, alas, fatality renders impossible), at\nleast to make us esteem each other.\"\n\nMonte Cristo, with moistened eye, heaving breast, and lips half open,\nextended to Albert a hand which the latter pressed with a sentiment\nresembling respectful fear. \"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"M. de Monte Cristo\nreceives my apology. I had acted hastily towards him. Hasty actions are\ngenerally bad ones. Now my fault is repaired. I hope the world will not\ncall me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated. But if any one\nshould entertain a false opinion of me,\" added he, drawing himself up\nas if he would challenge both friends and enemies, \"I shall endeavor to\ncorrect his mistake.\"\n\n\"What happened during the night?\" asked Beauchamp of Chateau-Renaud; \"we\nappear to make a very sorry figure here.\"\n\n\"In truth, what Albert has just done is either very despicable or very\nnoble,\" replied the baron.\n\n\"What can it mean?\" said Debray to Franz. \"The Count of Monte Cristo\nacts dishonorably to M. de Morcerf, and is justified by his son! Had I\nten Yaninas in my family, I should only consider myself the more bound\nto fight ten times.\" As for Monte Cristo, his head was bent down, his\narms were powerless. Bowing under the weight of twenty-four\nyears' reminiscences, he thought not of Albert, of Beauchamp, of\nChateau-Renaud, or of any of that group; but he thought of that\ncourageous woman who had come to plead for her son's life, to whom\nhe had offered his, and who had now saved it by the revelation of a\ndreadful family secret, capable of destroying forever in that young\nman's heart every feeling of filial piety.\n\n\"Providence still,\" murmured he; \"now only am I fully convinced of being\nthe emissary of God!\"\n\n\n\nChapter 91. Mother and Son.\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo bowed to the five young men with a melancholy\nand dignified smile, and got into his carriage with Maximilian and\nEmmanuel. Albert, Beauchamp, and Chateau-Renaud remained alone. Albert\nlooked at his two friends, not timidly, but in a way that appeared to\nask their opinion of what he had just done.\n\n\"Indeed, my dear friend,\" said Beauchamp first, who had either the most\nfeeling or the least dissimulation, \"allow me to congratulate you; this\nis a very unhoped-for conclusion of a very disagreeable affair.\"\n\nAlbert remained silent and wrapped in thought. Chateau-Renaud contented\nhimself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane. \"Are we not\ngoing?\" said he, after this embarrassing silence. \"When you please,\"\nreplied Beauchamp; \"allow me only to compliment M. de Morcerf, who has\ngiven proof to-day of rare chivalric generosity.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Chateau-Renaud.\n\n\"It is magnificent,\" continued Beauchamp, \"to be able to exercise so\nmuch self-control!\"\n\n\"Assuredly; as for me, I should have been incapable of it,\" said\nChateau-Renaud, with most significant coolness.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" interrupted Albert, \"I think you did not understand\nthat something very serious had passed between M. de Monte Cristo and\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Possibly, possibly,\" said Beauchamp immediately; \"but every simpleton\nwould not be able to understand your heroism, and sooner or later you\nwill find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically\nthan would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your\nlife. May I give you a friendly counsel? Set out for Naples, the Hague,\nor St. Petersburg--calm countries, where the point of honor is better\nunderstood than among our hot-headed Parisians. Seek quietude and\noblivion, so that you may return peaceably to France after a few years.\nAm I not right, M. de Chateau-Renaud?\"\n\n\"That is quite my opinion,\" said the gentleman; \"nothing induces serious\nduels so much as a duel forsworn.\"\n\n\"Thank you, gentlemen,\" replied Albert, with a smile of indifference;\n\"I shall follow your advice--not because you give it, but because I had\nbefore intended to quit France. I thank you equally for the service you\nhave rendered me in being my seconds. It is deeply engraved on my\nheart, and, after what you have just said, I remember that only.\"\nChateau-Renaud and Beauchamp looked at each other; the impression\nwas the same on both of them, and the tone in which Morcerf had just\nexpressed his thanks was so determined that the position would have\nbecome embarrassing for all if the conversation had continued.\n\n\"Good-by, Albert,\" said Beauchamp suddenly, carelessly extending his\nhand to the young man. The latter did not appear to arouse from his\nlethargy; in fact, he did not notice the offered hand. \"Good-by,\" said\nChateau-Renaud in his turn, keeping his little cane in his left hand,\nand saluting with his right. Albert's lips scarcely whispered \"Good-by,\"\nbut his look was more explicit; it expressed a whole poem of restrained\nanger, proud disdain, and generous indignation. He preserved his\nmelancholy and motionless position for some time after his two friends\nhad regained their carriage; then suddenly unfastening his horse\nfrom the little tree to which his servant had tied it, he mounted and\ngalloped off in the direction of Paris.\n\nIn a quarter of an hour he was entering the house in the Rue du Helder.\nAs he alighted, he thought he saw his father's pale face behind the\ncurtain of the count's bedroom. Albert turned away his head with a sigh,\nand went to his own apartments. He cast one lingering look on all the\nluxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy since his\ninfancy; he looked at the pictures, whose faces seemed to smile, and the\nlandscapes, which appeared painted in brighter colors. Then he took away\nhis mother's portrait, with its oaken frame, leaving the gilt frame from\nwhich he took it black and empty. Then he arranged all his beautiful\nTurkish arms, his fine English guns, his Japanese china, his cups\nmounted in silver, his artistic bronzes by Feucheres and Barye; examined\nthe cupboards, and placed the key in each; threw into a drawer of his\nsecretary, which he left open, all the pocket-money he had about\nhim, and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his\njewel-boxes; then he made an exact inventory of everything, and placed\nit in the most conspicuous part of the table, after putting aside the\nbooks and papers which had collected there.\n\nAt the beginning of this work, his servant, notwithstanding orders to\nthe contrary, came to his room. \"What do you want?\" asked he, with a\nmore sorrowful than angry tone. \"Pardon me, sir,\" replied the valet;\n\"you had forbidden me to disturb you, but the Count of Morcerf has\ncalled me.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Albert.\n\n\"I did not like to go to him without first seeing you.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because the count is doubtless aware that I accompanied you to the\nmeeting this morning.\"\n\n\"It is probable,\" said Albert.\n\n\"And since he has sent for me, it is doubtless to question me on what\nhappened there. What must I answer?\"\n\n\"The truth.\"\n\n\"Then I shall say the duel did not take place?\"\n\n\"You will say I apologized to the Count of Monte Cristo. Go.\"\n\nThe valet bowed and retired, and Albert returned to his inventory. As he\nwas finishing this work, the sound of horses prancing in the yard, and\nthe wheels of a carriage shaking his window, attracted his attention. He\napproached the window, and saw his father get into it, and drive away.\nThe door was scarcely closed when Albert bent his steps to his mother's\nroom; and, no one being there to announce him, he advanced to her\nbed-chamber, and distressed by what he saw and guessed, stopped for one\nmoment at the door. As if the same idea had animated these two beings,\nMercedes was doing the same in her apartments that he had just done in\nhis. Everything was in order,--laces, dresses, jewels, linen, money, all\nwere arranged in the drawers, and the countess was carefully collecting\nthe keys. Albert saw all these preparations and understood them, and\nexclaiming, \"My mother!\" he threw his arms around her neck.\n\nThe artist who could have depicted the expression of these two\ncountenances would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture. All\nthese proofs of an energetic resolution, which Albert did not fear on\nhis own account, alarmed him for his mother. \"What are you doing?\" asked\nhe.\n\n\"What were you doing?\" replied she.\n\n\"Oh, my mother!\" exclaimed Albert, so overcome he could scarcely speak;\n\"it is not the same with you and me--you cannot have made the same\nresolution I have, for I have come to warn you that I bid adieu to your\nhouse, and--and to you.\"\n\n\"I also,\" replied Mercedes, \"am going, and I acknowledge I had depended\non your accompanying me; have I deceived myself?\"\n\n\"Mother,\" said Albert with firmness. \"I cannot make you share the fate\nI have planned for myself. I must live henceforth without rank and\nfortune, and to begin this hard apprenticeship I must borrow from a\nfriend the loaf I shall eat until I have earned one. So, my dear mother,\nI am going at once to ask Franz to lend me the small sum I shall require\nto supply my present wants.\"\n\n\"You, my poor child, suffer poverty and hunger? Oh, do not say so; it\nwill break my resolutions.\"\n\n\"But not mine, mother,\" replied Albert. \"I am young and strong; I\nbelieve I am courageous, and since yesterday I have learned the power\nof will. Alas, my dear mother, some have suffered so much, and yet\nlive, and have raised a new fortune on the ruin of all the promises of\nhappiness which heaven had made them--on the fragments of all the hope\nwhich God had given them! I have seen that, mother; I know that from the\ngulf in which their enemies have plunged them they have risen with so\nmuch vigor and glory that in their turn they have ruled their former\nconquerors, and have punished them. No, mother; from this moment I have\ndone with the past, and accept nothing from it--not even a name, because\nyou can understand that your son cannot bear the name of a man who ought\nto blush for it before another.\"\n\n\"Albert, my child,\" said Mercedes, \"if I had a stronger heart, that is\nthe counsel I would have given you; your conscience has spoken when my\nvoice became too weak; listen to its dictates. You had friends, Albert;\nbreak off their acquaintance. But do not despair; you have life before\nyou, my dear Albert, for you are yet scarcely twenty-two years old; and\nas a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name, take my father's--it\nwas Herrera. I am sure, my dear Albert, whatever may be your career,\nyou will soon render that name illustrious. Then, my son, return to the\nworld still more brilliant because of your former sorrows; and if I am\nwrong, still let me cherish these hopes, for I have no future to look\nforward to. For me the grave opens when I pass the threshold of this\nhouse.\"\n\n\"I will fulfil all your wishes, my dear mother,\" said the young man.\n\"Yes, I share your hopes; the anger of heaven will not pursue us, since\nyou are pure and I am innocent. But, since our resolution is formed,\nlet us act promptly. M. de Morcerf went out about half an hour ago; the\nopportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation.\"\n\n\"I am ready, my son,\" said Mercedes. Albert ran to fetch a carriage. He\nrecollected that there was a small furnished house to let in the Rue de\nSaints Peres, where his mother would find a humble but decent lodging,\nand thither he intended conducting the countess. As the carriage stopped\nat the door, and Albert was alighting, a man approached and gave him a\nletter. Albert recognized the bearer. \"From the count,\" said Bertuccio.\nAlbert took the letter, opened, and read it, then looked round for\nBertuccio, but he was gone. He returned to Mercedes with tears in his\neyes and heaving breast, and without uttering a word he gave her the\nletter. Mercedes read:--\n\nAlbert,--While showing you that I have discovered your plans, I hope\nalso to convince you of my delicacy. You are free, you leave the count's\nhouse, and you take your mother to your home; but reflect, Albert, you\nowe her more than your poor noble heart can pay her. Keep the struggle\nfor yourself, bear all the suffering, but spare her the trial of poverty\nwhich must accompany your first efforts; for she deserves not even\nthe shadow of the misfortune which has this day fallen on her, and\nprovidence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the\nguilty. I know you are going to leave the Rue du Helder without taking\nanything with you. Do not seek to know how I discovered it; I know\nit--that is sufficient.\n\nNow, listen, Albert. Twenty-four years ago I returned, proud and joyful,\nto my country. I had a betrothed, Albert, a lovely girl whom I adored,\nand I was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty louis, painfully\namassed by ceaseless toil. This money was for her; I destined it for\nher, and, knowing the treachery of the sea I buried our treasure in\nthe little garden of the house my father lived in at Marseilles, on the\nAllees de Meillan. Your mother, Albert, knows that poor house well. A\nshort time since I passed through Marseilles, and went to see the old\nplace, which revived so many painful recollections; and in the evening\nI took a spade and dug in the corner of the garden where I had concealed\nmy treasure. The iron box was there--no one had touched it--under a\nbeautiful fig-tree my father had planted the day I was born, which\novershadowed the spot. Well, Albert, this money, which was formerly\ndesigned to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the woman I adored,\nmay now, through strange and painful circumstances, be devoted to the\nsame purpose. Oh, feel for me, who could offer millions to that poor\nwoman, but who return her only the piece of black bread forgotten\nunder my poor roof since the day I was torn from her I loved. You are\na generous man, Albert, but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or\nresentment; if you refuse me, if you ask another for what I have a right\nto offer you, I will say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the life\nof your mother at the hands of a man whose father was allowed by your\nfather to die in all the horrors of poverty and despair.\n\nAlbert stood pale and motionless to hear what his mother would decide\nafter she had finished reading this letter. Mercedes turned her eyes\nwith an ineffable look towards heaven. \"I accept it,\" said she; \"he has\na right to pay the dowry, which I shall take with me to some convent!\"\nPutting the letter in her bosom, she took her son's arm, and with a\nfirmer step than she even herself expected she went down-stairs.\n\n\n\nChapter 92. The Suicide.\n\nMeanwhile Monte Cristo had also returned to town with Emmanuel and\nMaximilian. Their return was cheerful. Emmanuel did not conceal his\njoy at the peaceful termination of the affair, and was loud in his\nexpressions of delight. Morrel, in a corner of the carriage, allowed his\nbrother-in-law's gayety to expend itself in words, while he felt equal\ninward joy, which, however, betrayed itself only in his countenance.\nAt the Barriere du Trone they met Bertuccio, who was waiting there,\nmotionless as a sentinel at his post. Monte Cristo put his head out\nof the window, exchanged a few words with him in a low tone, and the\nsteward disappeared. \"Count,\" said Emmanuel, when they were at the end\nof the Place Royale, \"put me down at my door, that my wife may not have\na single moment of needless anxiety on my account or yours.\"\n\n\"If it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph, I would\ninvite the count to our house; besides that, he doubtless has some\ntrembling heart to comfort. So we will take leave of our friend, and let\nhim hasten home.\"\n\n\"Stop a moment,\" said Monte Cristo; \"do not let me lose both my\ncompanions. Return, Emmanuel, to your charming wife, and present my\nbest compliments to her; and do you, Morrel, accompany me to the Champs\nElysees.\"\n\n\"Willingly,\" said Maximilian; \"particularly as I have business in that\nquarter.\"\n\n\"Shall we wait breakfast for you?\" asked Emmanuel.\n\n\"No,\" replied the young man. The door was closed, and the carriage\nproceeded. \"See what good fortune I brought you!\" said Morrel, when he\nwas alone with the count. \"Have you not thought so?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Monte Cristo; \"for that reason I wished to keep you near\nme.\"\n\n\"It is miraculous!\" continued Morrel, answering his own thoughts.\n\n\"What?\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"What has just happened.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Count, \"you are right--it is miraculous.\"\n\n\"For Albert is brave,\" resumed Morrel.\n\n\"Very brave,\" said Monte Cristo; \"I have seen him sleep with a sword\nsuspended over his head.\"\n\n\"And I know he has fought two duels,\" said Morrel. \"How can you\nreconcile that with his conduct this morning?\"\n\n\"All owing to your influence,\" replied Monte Cristo, smiling.\n\n\"It is well for Albert he is not in the army,\" said Morrel.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"An apology on the ground!\" said the young captain, shaking his head.\n\n\"Come,\" said the count mildly, \"do not entertain the prejudices of\nordinary men, Morrel! Acknowledge, that if Albert is brave, he cannot\nbe a coward; he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this\nmorning, and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, doubtless,\" said Morrel; \"but I shall say, like the\nSpaniard, 'He has not been so brave to-day as he was yesterday.'\"\n\n\"You will breakfast with me, will you not, Morrel?\" said the count, to\nturn the conversation.\n\n\"No; I must leave you at ten o'clock.\"\n\n\"Your engagement was for breakfast, then?\" said the count.\n\nMorrel smiled, and shook his head. \"Still you must breakfast somewhere.\"\n\n\"But if I am not hungry?\" said the young man.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the count, \"I only know two things which destroy the\nappetite,--grief--and as I am happy to see you very cheerful, it is not\nthat--and love. Now after what you told me this morning of your heart, I\nmay believe\"--\n\n\"Well, count,\" replied Morrel gayly, \"I will not dispute it.\"\n\n\"But you will not make me your confidant, Maximilian?\" said the count,\nin a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the\nsecret.\n\n\"I showed you this morning that I had a heart, did I not, count?\" Monte\nCristo only answered by extending his hand to the young man. \"Well,\"\ncontinued the latter, \"since that heart is no longer with you in the\nBois de Vincennes, it is elsewhere, and I must go and find it.\"\n\n\"Go,\" said the count deliberately; \"go, dear friend, but promise me if\nyou meet with any obstacle to remember that I have some power in this\nworld, that I am happy to use that power in the behalf of those I love,\nand that I love you, Morrel.\"\n\n\"I will remember it,\" said the young man, \"as selfish children recollect\ntheir parents when they want their aid. When I need your assistance, and\nthe moment arrives, I will come to you, count.\"\n\n\"Well, I rely upon your promise. Good-by, then.\"\n\n\"Good-by, till we meet again.\" They had arrived in the Champs Elysees.\nMonte Cristo opened the carriage-door, Morrel sprang out on the\npavement, Bertuccio was waiting on the steps. Morrel disappeared down\nthe Avenue de Marigny, and Monte Cristo hastened to join Bertuccio.\n\n\"Well?\" asked he.\n\n\"She is going to leave her house,\" said the steward.\n\n\"And her son?\"\n\n\"Florentin, his valet, thinks he is going to do the same.\"\n\n\"Come this way.\" Monte Cristo took Bertuccio into his study, wrote the\nletter we have seen, and gave it to the steward. \"Go,\" said he quickly.\n\"But first, let Haidee be informed that I have returned.\"\n\n\"Here I am,\" said the young girl, who at the sound of the carriage had\nrun down-stairs and whose face was radiant with joy at seeing the count\nreturn safely. Bertuccio left. Every transport of a daughter finding a\nfather, all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover, were felt\nby Haidee during the first moments of this meeting, which she had so\neagerly expected. Doubtless, although less evident, Monte Cristo's joy\nwas not less intense. Joy to hearts which have suffered long is like the\ndew on the ground after a long drought; both the heart and the ground\nabsorb that beneficent moisture falling on them, and nothing is\noutwardly apparent.\n\nMonte Cristo was beginning to think, what he had not for a long time\ndared to believe, that there were two Mercedes in the world, and he\nmight yet be happy. His eye, elate with happiness, was reading eagerly\nthe tearful gaze of Haidee, when suddenly the door opened. The count\nknit his brow. \"M. de Morcerf!\" said Baptistin, as if that name sufficed\nfor his excuse. In fact, the count's face brightened.\n\n\"Which,\" asked he, \"the viscount or the count?\"\n\n\"The count.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed Haidee, \"is it not yet over?\"\n\n\"I know not if it is finished, my beloved child,\" said Monte Cristo,\ntaking the young girl's hands; \"but I do know you have nothing more to\nfear.\"\n\n\"But it is the wretched\"--\n\n\"That man cannot injure me, Haidee,\" said Monte Cristo; \"it was his son\nalone that there was cause to fear.\"\n\n\"And what I have suffered,\" said the young girl, \"you shall never know,\nmy lord.\" Monte Cristo smiled. \"By my father's tomb,\" said he, extending\nhis hand over the head of the young girl, \"I swear to you, Haidee, that\nif any misfortune happens, it will not be to me.\"\n\n\"I believe you, my lord, as implicitly as if God had spoken to me,\" said\nthe young girl, presenting her forehead to him. Monte Cristo pressed on\nthat pure beautiful forehead a kiss which made two hearts throb at once,\nthe one violently, the other heavily. \"Oh,\" murmured the count, \"shall\nI then be permitted to love again? Ask M. de Morcerf into the\ndrawing-room,\" said he to Baptistin, while he led the beautiful Greek\ngirl to a private staircase.\n\nWe must explain this visit, which although expected by Monte Cristo, is\nunexpected to our readers. While Mercedes, as we have said, was making\na similar inventory of her property to Albert's, while she was arranging\nher jewels, shutting her drawers, collecting her keys, to leave\neverything in perfect order, she did not perceive a pale and sinister\nface at a glass door which threw light into the passage, from which\neverything could be both seen and heard. He who was thus looking,\nwithout being heard or seen, probably heard and saw all that passed in\nMadame de Morcerf's apartments. From that glass door the pale-faced\nman went to the count's bedroom and raised with a constricted hand the\ncurtain of a window overlooking the court-yard. He remained there ten\nminutes, motionless and dumb, listening to the beating of his own heart.\nFor him those ten minutes were very long. It was then Albert, returning\nfrom his meeting with the count, perceived his father watching for his\narrival behind a curtain, and turned aside. The count's eye expanded; he\nknew Albert had insulted the count dreadfully, and that in every country\nin the world such an insult would lead to a deadly duel. Albert returned\nsafely--then the count was revenged.\n\nAn indescribable ray of joy illumined that wretched countenance like the\nlast ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear\nthe aspect, not of a downy couch, but of a tomb. But as we have said, he\nwaited in vain for his son to come to his apartment with the account of\nhis triumph. He easily understood why his son did not come to see him\nbefore he went to avenge his father's honor; but when that was done, why\ndid not his son come and throw himself into his arms?\n\nIt was then, when the count could not see Albert, that he sent for his\nservant, who he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from him.\nTen minutes afterwards, General Morcerf was seen on the steps in a black\ncoat with a military collar, black pantaloons, and black gloves. He had\napparently given previous orders, for as he reached the bottom step his\ncarriage came from the coach-house ready for him. The valet threw into\nthe carriage his military cloak, in which two swords were wrapped, and,\nshutting the door, he took his seat by the side of the coachman. The\ncoachman stooped down for his orders.\n\n\"To the Champs Elysees,\" said the general; \"the Count of Monte Cristo's.\nHurry!\" The horses bounded beneath the whip; and in five minutes they\nstopped before the count's door. M. de Morcerf opened the door himself,\nand as the carriage rolled away he passed up the walk, rang, and entered\nthe open door with his servant.\n\nA moment afterwards, Baptistin announced the Count of Morcerf to Monte\nCristo, and the latter, leading Haidee aside, ordered that Morcerf be\nasked into the drawing-room. The general was pacing the room the third\ntime when, in turning, he perceived Monte Cristo at the door. \"Ah, it\nis M. de Morcerf,\" said Monte Cristo quietly; \"I thought I had not heard\naright.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is I,\" said the count, whom a frightful contraction of the lips\nprevented from articulating freely.\n\n\"May I know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing M. de\nMorcerf so early?\"\n\n\"Had you not a meeting with my son this morning?\" asked the general.\n\n\"I had,\" replied the count.\n\n\"And I know my son had good reasons to wish to fight with you, and to\nendeavor to kill you.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, he had very good ones; but you see that in spite of them he\nhas not killed me, and did not even fight.\"\n\n\"Yet he considered you the cause of his father's dishonor, the cause of\nthe fearful ruin which has fallen on my house.\"\n\n\"It is true, sir,\" said Monte Cristo with his dreadful calmness; \"a\nsecondary cause, but not the principal.\"\n\n\"Doubtless you made, then, some apology or explanation?\"\n\n\"I explained nothing, and it is he who apologized to me.\"\n\n\"But to what do you attribute this conduct?\"\n\n\"To the conviction, probably, that there was one more guilty than I.\"\n\n\"And who was that?\"\n\n\"His father.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" said the count, turning pale; \"but you know the guilty do\nnot like to find themselves convicted.\"\n\n\"I know it, and I expected this result.\"\n\n\"You expected my son would be a coward?\" cried the count.\n\n\"M. Albert de Morcerf is no coward!\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"A man who holds a sword in his hand, and sees a mortal enemy within\nreach of that sword, and does not fight, is a coward! Why is he not here\nthat I may tell him so?\"\n\n\"Sir.\" replied Monte Cristo coldly, \"I did not expect that you had come\nhere to relate to me your little family affairs. Go and tell M. Albert\nthat, and he may know what to answer you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no,\" said the general, smiling faintly, \"I did not come for\nthat purpose; you are right. I came to tell you that I also look upon\nyou as my enemy. I came to tell you that I hate you instinctively; that\nit seems as if I had always known you, and always hated you; and, in\nshort, since the young people of the present day will not fight, it\nremains for us to do so. Do you think so, sir?\"\n\n\"Certainly. And when I told you I had foreseen the result, it is the\nhonor of your visit I alluded to.\"\n\n\"So much the better. Are you prepared?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You know that we shall fight till one of us is dead,\" said the general,\nwhose teeth were clinched with rage. \"Until one of us dies,\" repeated\nMonte Cristo, moving his head slightly up and down.\n\n\"Let us start, then; we need no witnesses.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said Monte Cristo; \"it is unnecessary, we know each other\nso well!\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said the count, \"we know so little of each other.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Monte Cristo, with the same indomitable coolness; \"let\nus see. Are you not the soldier Fernand who deserted on the eve of the\nbattle of Waterloo? Are you not the Lieutenant Fernand who served as\nguide and spy to the French army in Spain? Are you not the Captain\nFernand who betrayed, sold, and murdered his benefactor, Ali? And have\nnot all these Fernands, united, made Lieutenant-General, the Count of\nMorcerf, peer of France?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" cried the general, as if branded with a hot iron, \"wretch,--to\nreproach me with my shame when about, perhaps, to kill me! No, I did\nnot say I was a stranger to you. I know well, demon, that you have\npenetrated into the darkness of the past, and that you have read, by the\nlight of what torch I know not, every page of my life; but perhaps I\nmay be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous coverings.\nNo--no, I am aware you know me; but I know you only as an adventurer\nsewn up in gold and jewellery. You call yourself in Paris the Count of\nMonte Cristo; in Italy, Sinbad the Sailor; in Malta, I forget what. But\nit is your real name I want to know, in the midst of your hundred names,\nthat I may pronounce it when we meet to fight, at the moment when I\nplunge my sword through your heart.\"\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo turned dreadfully pale; his eye seemed to\nburn with a devouring fire. He leaped towards a dressing-room near his\nbedroom, and in less than a moment, tearing off his cravat, his coat\nand waistcoat, he put on a sailor's jacket and hat, from beneath which\nrolled his long black hair. He returned thus, formidable and implacable,\nadvancing with his arms crossed on his breast, towards the general,\nwho could not understand why he had disappeared, but who on seeing him\nagain, and feeling his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him, drew\nback, and only stopped when he found a table to support his clinched\nhand. \"Fernand,\" cried he, \"of my hundred names I need only tell you\none, to overwhelm you! But you guess it now, do you not?--or, rather,\nyou remember it? For, notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures,\nI show you to-day a face which the happiness of revenge makes young\nagain--a face you must often have seen in your dreams since your\nmarriage with Mercedes, my betrothed!\"\n\nThe general, with his head thrown back, hands extended, gaze fixed,\nlooked silently at this dreadful apparition; then seeking the wall to\nsupport him, he glided along close to it until he reached the door,\nthrough which he went out backwards, uttering this single mournful,\nlamentable, distressing cry,--\"Edmond Dantes!\" Then, with sighs which\nwere unlike any human sound, he dragged himself to the door, reeled\nacross the court-yard, and falling into the arms of his valet, he said\nin a voice scarcely intelligible,--\"Home, home.\" The fresh air and the\nshame he felt at having exposed himself before his servants, partly\nrecalled his senses, but the ride was short, and as he drew near his\nhouse all his wretchedness revived. He stopped at a short distance from\nthe house and alighted.\n\nThe door was wide open, a hackney-coach was standing in the middle of\nthe yard--a strange sight before so noble a mansion; the count looked\nat it with terror, but without daring to inquire its meaning, he rushed\ntowards his apartment. Two persons were coming down the stairs; he had\nonly time to creep into an alcove to avoid them. It was Mercedes leaning\non her son's arm and leaving the house. They passed close by the unhappy\nbeing, who, concealed behind the damask curtain, almost felt Mercedes\ndress brush past him, and his son's warm breath, pronouncing these\nwords,--\"Courage, mother! Come, this is no longer our home!\" The words\ndied away, the steps were lost in the distance. The general drew himself\nup, clinging to the curtain; he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever\nescaped from the bosom of a father abandoned at the same time by\nhis wife and son. He soon heard the clatter of the iron step of the\nhackney-coach, then the coachman's voice, and then the rolling of the\nheavy vehicle shook the windows. He darted to his bedroom to see once\nmore all he had loved in the world; but the hackney-coach drove on and\nthe head of neither Mercedes nor her son appeared at the window to take\na last look at the house or the deserted father and husband. And at the\nvery moment when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report\nwas heard, and a thick smoke escaped through one of the panes of the\nwindow, which was broken by the explosion.\n\n\n\nChapter 93. Valentine.\n\nWe may easily conceive where Morrel's appointment was. On leaving Monte\nCristo he walked slowly towards Villefort's; we say slowly, for Morrel\nhad more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps, but he\nhad hastened to take leave of Monte Cristo because he wished to be alone\nwith his thoughts. He knew his time well--the hour when Valentine was\ngiving Noirtier his breakfast, and was sure not to be disturbed in the\nperformance of this pious duty. Noirtier and Valentine had given him\nleave to go twice a week, and he was now availing himself of that\npermission. He had arrived; Valentine was expecting him. Uneasy and\nalmost crazed, she seized his hand and led him to her grandfather. This\nuneasiness, amounting almost to frenzy, arose from the report Morcerf's\nadventure had made in the world, for the affair at the opera was\ngenerally known. No one at Villefort's doubted that a duel would ensue\nfrom it. Valentine, with her woman's instinct, guessed that Morrel would\nbe Monte Cristo's second, and from the young man's well-known courage\nand his great affection for the count, she feared that he would not\ncontent himself with the passive part assigned to him. We may easily\nunderstand how eagerly the particulars were asked for, given, and\nreceived; and Morrel could read an indescribable joy in the eyes of his\nbeloved, when she knew that the termination of this affair was as happy\nas it was unexpected.\n\n\"Now,\" said Valentine, motioning to Morrel to sit down near her\ngrandfather, while she took her seat on his footstool,--\"now let us talk\nabout our own affairs. You know, Maximilian, grandpapa once thought\nof leaving this house, and taking an apartment away from M. de\nVillefort's.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Maximilian, \"I recollect the project, of which I highly\napproved.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Valentine, \"you may approve again, for grandpapa is again\nthinking of it.\"\n\n\"Bravo,\" said Maximilian.\n\n\"And do you know,\" said Valentine, \"what reason grandpapa gives for\nleaving this house.\" Noirtier looked at Valentine to impose silence,\nbut she did not notice him; her looks, her eyes, her smile, were all for\nMorrel.\n\n\"Oh, whatever may be M. Noirtier's reason,\" answered Morrel, \"I can\nreadily believe it to be a good one.\"\n\n\"An excellent one,\" said Valentine. \"He pretends the air of the Faubourg\nSt. Honore is not good for me.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Morrel; \"in that M. Noirtier may be right; you have not\nseemed to be well for the last fortnight.\"\n\n\"Not very,\" said Valentine. \"And grandpapa has become my physician, and\nI have the greatest confidence in him, because he knows everything.\"\n\n\"Do you then really suffer?\" asked Morrel quickly.\n\n\"Oh, it must not be called suffering; I feel a general uneasiness, that\nis all. I have lost my appetite, and my stomach feels as if it were\nstruggling to get accustomed to something.\" Noirtier did not lose a\nword of what Valentine said. \"And what treatment do you adopt for this\nsingular complaint?\"\n\n\"A very simple one,\" said Valentine. \"I swallow every morning a spoonful\nof the mixture prepared for my grandfather. When I say one spoonful,\nI began by one--now I take four. Grandpapa says it is a panacea.\"\nValentine smiled, but it was evident that she suffered.\n\nMaximilian, in his devotedness, gazed silently at her. She was very\nbeautiful, but her usual pallor had increased; her eyes were more\nbrilliant than ever, and her hands, which were generally white like\nmother-of-pearl, now more resembled wax, to which time was adding a\nyellowish hue. From Valentine the young man looked towards Noirtier. The\nlatter watched with strange and deep interest the young girl, absorbed\nby her affection, and he also, like Morrel, followed those traces of\ninward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer\nthat they escaped the notice of every one but the grandfather and the\nlover.\n\n\"But,\" said Morrel, \"I thought this mixture, of which you now take four\nspoonfuls, was prepared for M. Noirtier?\"\n\n\"I know it is very bitter,\" said Valentine; \"so bitter, that all I drink\nafterwards appears to have the same taste.\" Noirtier looked inquiringly\nat his granddaughter. \"Yes, grandpapa,\" said Valentine; \"it is so. Just\nnow, before I came down to you, I drank a glass of sugared water; I left\nhalf, because it seemed so bitter.\" Noirtier turned pale, and made a\nsign that he wished to speak. Valentine rose to fetch the dictionary.\nNoirtier watched her with evident anguish. In fact, the blood was\nrushing to the young girl's head already, her cheeks were becoming\nred. \"Oh,\" cried she, without losing any of her cheerfulness, \"this is\nsingular! I can't see! Did the sun shine in my eyes?\" And she leaned\nagainst the window.\n\n\"The sun is not shining,\" said Morrel, more alarmed by Noirtier's\nexpression than by Valentine's indisposition. He ran towards her. The\nyoung girl smiled. \"Cheer up,\" said she to Noirtier. \"Do not be alarmed,\nMaximilian; it is nothing, and has already passed away. But listen! Do I\nnot hear a carriage in the court-yard?\" She opened Noirtier's door, ran\nto a window in the passage, and returned hastily. \"Yes,\" said she,\n\"it is Madame Danglars and her daughter, who have come to call on us.\nGood-by;--I must run away, for they would send here for me, or, rather,\nfarewell till I see you again. Stay with grandpapa, Maximilian; I\npromise you not to persuade them to stay.\"\n\nMorrel watched her as she left the room; he heard her ascend the little\nstaircase which led both to Madame de Villefort's apartments and to\nhers. As soon as she was gone, Noirtier made a sign to Morrel to take\nthe dictionary. Morrel obeyed; guided by Valentine, he had learned how\nto understand the old man quickly. Accustomed, however, as he was to the\nwork, he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find\nevery word in the dictionary, so that it was ten minutes before the\nthought of the old man was translated by these words, \"Fetch the glass\nof water and the decanter from Valentine's room.\"\n\nMorrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barrois's\nsituation, and in Noirtier's name gave that order. The servant soon\nreturned. The decanter and the glass were completely empty. Noirtier\nmade a sign that he wished to speak. \"Why are the glass and decanter\nempty?\" asked he; \"Valentine said she only drank half the glassful.\" The\ntranslation of this new question occupied another five minutes. \"I\ndo not know,\" said the servant, \"but the housemaid is in Mademoiselle\nValentine's room: perhaps she has emptied them.\"\n\n\"Ask her,\" said Morrel, translating Noirtier's thought this time by\nhis look. The servant went out, but returned almost immediately.\n\"Mademoiselle Valentine passed through the room to go to Madame de\nVillefort's,\" said he; \"and in passing, as she was thirsty, she drank\nwhat remained in the glass; as for the decanter, Master Edward had\nemptied that to make a pond for his ducks.\" Noirtier raised his eyes to\nheaven, as a gambler does who stakes his all on one stroke. From that\nmoment the old man's eyes were fixed on the door, and did not quit it.\n\nIt was indeed Madame Danglars and her daughter whom Valentine had seen;\nthey had been ushered into Madame de Villefort's room, who had said she\nwould receive them there. That is why Valentine passed through her room,\nwhich was on a level with Valentine's, and only separated from it by\nEdward's. The two ladies entered the drawing-room with that sort of\nofficial stiffness which preludes a formal communication. Among worldly\npeople manner is contagious. Madame de Villefort received them with\nequal solemnity. Valentine entered at this moment, and the formalities\nwere resumed. \"My dear friend,\" said the baroness, while the two young\npeople were shaking hands, \"I and Eugenie are come to be the first to\nannounce to you the approaching marriage of my daughter with Prince\nCavalcanti.\" Danglars kept up the title of prince. The popular banker\nfound that it answered better than count. \"Allow me to present you\nmy sincere congratulations,\" replied Madame de Villefort. \"Prince\nCavalcanti appears to be a young man of rare qualities.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said the baroness, smiling; \"speaking to you as a friend I can\nsay that the prince does not yet appear all he will be. He has about him\na little of that foreign manner by which French persons recognize, at\nfirst sight, the Italian or German nobleman. Besides, he gives evidence\nof great kindness of disposition, much keenness of wit, and as to\nsuitability, M. Danglars assures me that his fortune is majestic--that\nis his word.\"\n\n\"And then,\" said Eugenie, while turning over the leaves of Madame de\nVillefort's album, \"add that you have taken a great fancy to the young\nman.\"\n\n\"And,\" said Madame de Villefort, \"I need not ask you if you share that\nfancy.\"\n\n\"I?\" replied Eugenie with her usual candor. \"Oh, not the least in the\nworld, madame! My wish was not to confine myself to domestic cares, or\nthe caprices of any man, but to be an artist, and consequently free in\nheart, in person, and in thought.\" Eugenie pronounced these words with\nso firm a tone that the color mounted to Valentine's cheeks. The timid\ngirl could not understand that vigorous nature which appeared to have\nnone of the timidities of woman.\n\n\"At any rate,\" said she, \"since I am to be married whether I will or\nnot, I ought to be thankful to providence for having released me from my\nengagement with M. Albert de Morcerf, or I should this day have been the\nwife of a dishonored man.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said the baroness, with that strange simplicity sometimes\nmet with among fashionable ladies, and of which plebeian intercourse can\nnever entirely deprive them,--\"it is very true that had not the Morcerfs\nhesitated, my daughter would have married Monsieur Albert. The general\ndepended much on it; he even came to force M. Danglars. We have had a\nnarrow escape.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Valentine, timidly, \"does all the father's shame revert upon\nthe son? Monsieur Albert appears to me quite innocent of the treason\ncharged against the general.\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said the implacable young girl, \"Monsieur Albert claims and\nwell deserves his share. It appears that after having challenged M.\nde Monte Cristo at the Opera yesterday, he apologized on the ground\nto-day.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" said Madame de Villefort.\n\n\"Ah, my dear friend,\" said Madame Danglars, with the same simplicity\nwe before noticed, \"it is a fact. I heard it from M. Debray, who was\npresent at the explanation.\" Valentine also knew the truth, but she did\nnot answer. A single word had reminded her that Morrel was expecting\nher in M. Noirtier's room. Deeply engaged with a sort of inward\ncontemplation, Valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the\nconversation. She would, indeed, have found it impossible to repeat what\nhad been said the last few minutes, when suddenly Madame Danglars' hand,\npressed on her arm, aroused her from her lethargy.\n\n\"What is it?\" said she, starting at Madame Danglars' touch as she would\nhave done from an electric shock. \"It is, my dear Valentine,\" said the\nbaroness, \"that you are, doubtless, suffering.\"\n\n\"I?\" said the young girl, passing her hand across her burning forehead.\n\n\"Yes, look at yourself in that glass; you have turned pale and then red\nsuccessively, three or four times in one minute.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" cried Eugenie, \"you are very pale!\"\n\n\"Oh, do not be alarmed; I have been so for many days.\" Artless as she\nwas, the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave,\nand besides, Madame de Villefort came to her assistance. \"Retire,\nValentine,\" said she; \"you are really suffering, and these ladies will\nexcuse you; drink a glass of pure water, it will restore you.\" Valentine\nkissed Eugenie, bowed to Madame Danglars, who had already risen to take\nher leave, and went out. \"That poor child,\" said Madame de Villefort\nwhen Valentine was gone, \"she makes me very uneasy, and I should not be\nastonished if she had some serious illness.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Valentine, in a sort of excitement which she could not quite\nunderstand, had crossed Edward's room without noticing some trick of\nthe child, and through her own had reached the little staircase. She was\nwithin three steps of the bottom; she already heard Morrel's voice, when\nsuddenly a cloud passed over her eyes, her stiffened foot missed the\nstep, her hands had no power to hold the baluster, and falling against\nthe wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor. Morrel\nbounded to the door, opened it, and found Valentine stretched out at the\nbottom of the stairs. Quick as a flash, he raised her in his arms and\nplaced her in a chair. Valentine opened her eyes.\n\n\"Oh, what a clumsy thing I am,\" said she with feverish volubility;\n\"I don't know my way. I forgot there were three more steps before the\nlanding.\"\n\n\"You have hurt yourself, perhaps,\" said Morrel. \"What can I do for you,\nValentine?\" Valentine looked around her; she saw the deepest terror\ndepicted in Noirtier's eyes. \"Don't worry, dear grandpapa,\" said she,\nendeavoring to smile; \"it is nothing--it is nothing; I was giddy, that\nis all.\"\n\n\"Another attack of giddiness,\" said Morrel, clasping his hands. \"Oh,\nattend to it, Valentine, I entreat you.\"\n\n\"But no,\" said Valentine,--\"no, I tell you it is all past, and it was\nnothing. Now, let me tell you some news; Eugenie is to be married in\na week, and in three days there is to be a grand feast, a betrothal\nfestival. We are all invited, my father, Madame de Villefort, and I--at\nleast, I understood it so.\"\n\n\"When will it be our turn to think of these things? Oh, Valentine,\nyou who have so much influence over your grandpapa, try to make him\nanswer--Soon.\"\n\n\"And do you,\" said Valentine, \"depend on me to stimulate the tardiness\nand arouse the memory of grandpapa?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried Morrel, \"make haste. So long as you are not mine,\nValentine, I shall always think I may lose you.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" replied Valentine with a convulsive movement, \"oh, indeed,\nMaximilian, you are too timid for an officer, for a soldier who,\nthey say, never knows fear. Ah, ha, ha!\" she burst into a forced and\nmelancholy laugh, her arms stiffened and twisted, her head fell back\non her chair, and she remained motionless. The cry of terror which\nwas stopped on Noirtier's lips, seemed to start from his eyes. Morrel\nunderstood it; he knew he must call assistance. The young man rang the\nbell violently; the housemaid who had been in Mademoiselle Valentine's\nroom, and the servant who had replaced Barrois, ran in at the same\nmoment. Valentine was so pale, so cold, so inanimate that without\nlistening to what was said to them they were seized with the fear which\npervaded that house, and they flew into the passage crying for help.\nMadame Danglars and Eugenie were going out at that moment; they heard\nthe cause of the disturbance. \"I told you so!\" exclaimed Madame de\nVillefort. \"Poor child!\"\n\n\n\nChapter 94. Maximilian's Avowal.\n\nAt the same moment M. de Villefort's voice was heard calling from his\nstudy, \"What is the matter?\" Morrel looked at Noirtier who had recovered\nhis self-command, and with a glance indicated the closet where once\nbefore under somewhat similar circumstances, he had taken refuge. He had\nonly time to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet\nwhen the procureur's footstep was heard in the passage. Villefort sprang\ninto the room, ran to Valentine, and took her in his arms. \"A physician,\na physician,--M. d'Avrigny!\" cried Villefort; \"or rather I will go for\nhim myself.\" He flew from the apartment, and Morrel at the same moment\ndarted out at the other door. He had been struck to the heart by a\nfrightful recollection--the conversation he had heard between the doctor\nand Villefort the night of Madame de Saint-Meran's death, recurred to\nhim; these symptoms, to a less alarming extent, were the same which had\npreceded the death of Barrois. At the same time Monte Cristo's voice\nseemed to resound in his ear with the words he had heard only two hours\nbefore, \"Whatever you want, Morrel, come to me; I have great power.\"\nMore rapidly than thought, he darted down the Rue Matignon, and thence\nto the Avenue des Champs Elysees.\n\nMeanwhile M. de Villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at M. d'Avrigny's\ndoor. He rang so violently that the porter was alarmed. Villefort ran\nup-stairs without saying a word. The porter knew him, and let him pass,\nonly calling to him, \"In his study, Monsieur Procureur--in his study!\"\nVillefort pushed, or rather forced, the door open. \"Ah,\" said the\ndoctor, \"is it you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Villefort, closing the door after him, \"it is I, who am\ncome in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone. Doctor, my house is\naccursed!\"\n\n\"What?\" said the latter with apparent coolness, but with deep emotion,\n\"have you another invalid?\"\n\n\"Yes, doctor,\" cried Villefort, clutching his hair, \"yes!\"\n\nD'Avrigny's look implied, \"I told you it would be so.\" Then he slowly\nuttered these words, \"Who is now dying in your house? What new victim is\ngoing to accuse you of weakness before God?\" A mournful sob burst\nfrom Villefort's heart; he approached the doctor, and seizing his\narm,--\"Valentine,\" said he, \"it is Valentine's turn!\"\n\n\"Your daughter?\" cried d'Avrigny with grief and surprise.\n\n\"You see you were deceived,\" murmured the magistrate; \"come and see her,\nand on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her.\"\n\n\"Each time you have applied to me,\" said the doctor, \"it has been too\nlate; still I will go. But let us make haste, sir; with the enemies you\nhave to do with there is no time to be lost.\"\n\n\"Oh, this time, doctor, you shall not have to reproach me with weakness.\nThis time I will know the assassin, and will pursue him.\"\n\n\"Let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her,\"\nsaid d'Avrigny. \"Come.\" The same cabriolet which had brought Villefort\ntook them back at full speed, and at this moment Morrel rapped at Monte\nCristo's door. The count was in his study and was reading with an angry\nlook something which Bertuccio had brought in haste. Hearing the name\nof Morrel, who had left him only two hours before, the count raised his\nhead, arose, and sprang to meet him. \"What is the matter, Maximilian?\"\nasked he; \"you are pale, and the perspiration rolls from your forehead.\"\nMorrel fell into a chair. \"Yes,\" said he, \"I came quickly; I wanted to\nspeak to you.\"\n\n\"Are all your family well?\" asked the count, with an affectionate\nbenevolence, whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt.\n\n\"Thank you, count--thank you,\" said the young man, evidently embarrassed\nhow to begin the conversation; \"yes, every one in my family is well.\"\n\n\"So much the better; yet you have something to tell me?\" replied the\ncount with increased anxiety.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Morrel, \"it is true; I have but now left a house where death\nhas just entered, to run to you.\"\n\n\"Are you then come from M. de Morcerf's?\" asked Monte Cristo.\n\n\"No,\" said Morrel; \"is some one dead in his house?\"\n\n\"The general has just blown his brains out,\" replied Monte Cristo with\ngreat coolness.\n\n\"Oh, what a dreadful event!\" cried Maximilian.\n\n\"Not for the countess, or for Albert,\" said Monte Cristo; \"a dead father\nor husband is better than a dishonored one,--blood washes out shame.\"\n\n\"Poor countess,\" said Maximilian, \"I pity her very much; she is so noble\na woman!\"\n\n\"Pity Albert also, Maximilian; for believe me he is the worthy son\nof the countess. But let us return to yourself. You have hastened to\nme--can I have the happiness of being useful to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I need your help: that is I thought like a madman that you could\nlend me your assistance in a case where God alone can succor me.\"\n\n\"Tell me what it is,\" replied Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Morrel, \"I know not, indeed, if I may reveal this secret\nto mortal ears, but fatality impels me, necessity constrains me,\ncount\"--Morrel hesitated. \"Do you think I love you?\" said Monte Cristo,\ntaking the young man's hand affectionately in his.\n\n\"Oh, you encourage me, and something tells me there,\" placing his hand\non his heart, \"that I ought to have no secret from you.\"\n\n\"You are right, Morrel; God is speaking to your heart, and your heart\nspeaks to you. Tell me what it says.\"\n\n\"Count, will you allow me to send Baptistin to inquire after some one\nyou know?\"\n\n\"I am at your service, and still more my servants.\"\n\n\"Oh, I cannot live if she is not better.\"\n\n\"Shall I ring for Baptistin?\"\n\n\"No, I will go and speak to him myself.\" Morrel went out, called\nBaptistin, and whispered a few words to him. The valet ran directly.\n\"Well, have you sent?\" asked Monte Cristo, seeing Morrel return.\n\n\"Yes, and now I shall be more calm.\"\n\n\"You know I am waiting,\" said Monte Cristo, smiling.\n\n\"Yes, and I will tell you. One evening I was in a garden; a clump of\ntrees concealed me; no one suspected I was there. Two persons passed\nnear me--allow me to conceal their names for the present; they were\nspeaking in an undertone, and yet I was so interested in what they said\nthat I did not lose a single word.\"\n\n\"This is a gloomy introduction, if I may judge from your pallor and\nshuddering, Morrel.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, very gloomy, my friend. Some one had just died in the house\nto which that garden belonged. One of the persons whose conversation\nI overheard was the master of the house; the other, the physician. The\nformer was confiding to the latter his grief and fear, for it was the\nsecond time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly\nentered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some\nexterminating angel, as an object of God's anger.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed?\" said Monte Cristo, looking earnestly at the young man, and\nby an imperceptible movement turning his chair, so that he remained\nin the shade while the light fell full on Maximilian's face. \"Yes,\"\ncontinued Morrel, \"death had entered that house twice within one month.\"\n\n\"And what did the doctor answer?\" asked Monte Cristo.\n\n\"He replied--he replied, that the death was not a natural one, and must\nbe attributed\"--\n\n\"To what?\"\n\n\"To poison.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Monte Cristo with a slight cough which in moments of\nextreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush, or his pallor, or the\nintense interest with which he listened; \"indeed, Maximilian, did you\nhear that?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear count, I heard it; and the doctor added that if another\ndeath occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice.\" Monte Cristo\nlistened, or appeared to do so, with the greatest calmness. \"Well,\"\nsaid Maximilian, \"death came a third time, and neither the master of\nthe house nor the doctor said a word. Death is now, perhaps, striking a\nfourth blow. Count, what am I bound to do, being in possession of this\nsecret?\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" said Monte Cristo, \"you appear to be relating an\nadventure which we all know by heart. I know the house where you heard\nit, or one very similar to it; a house with a garden, a master, a\nphysician, and where there have been three unexpected and sudden deaths.\nWell, I have not intercepted your confidence, and yet I know all that\nas well as you, and I have no conscientious scruples. No, it does not\nconcern me. You say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that\nhouse to God's anger--well, who says your supposition is not reality?\nDo not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass\nover. If it is God's justice, instead of his anger, which is walking\nthrough that house, Maximilian, turn away your face and let his justice\naccomplish its purpose.\" Morrel shuddered. There was something mournful,\nsolemn, and terrible in the count's manner. \"Besides,\" continued he, in\nso changed a tone that no one would have supposed it was the same person\nspeaking--\"besides, who says that it will begin again?\"\n\n\"It has returned, count,\" exclaimed Morrel; \"that is why I hastened to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you wish me to do? Do you wish me, for instance, to give\ninformation to the procureur?\" Monte Cristo uttered the last words with\nso much meaning that Morrel, starting up, cried out, \"You know of whom I\nspeak, count, do you not?\"\n\n\"Perfectly well, my good friend; and I will prove it to you by putting\nthe dots to the 'i,' or rather by naming the persons. You were walking\none evening in M. de Villefort's garden; from what you relate, I suppose\nit to have been the evening of Madame de Saint-Meran's death. You\nheard M. de Villefort talking to M. d'Avrigny about the death of M. de\nSaint-Meran, and that no less surprising, of the countess. M. d'Avrigny\nsaid he believed they both proceeded from poison; and you, honest man,\nhave ever since been asking your heart and sounding your conscience to\nknow if you ought to expose or conceal this secret. Why do you torment\nthem? 'Conscience, what hast thou to do with me?' as Sterne said. My\ndear fellow, let them sleep on, if they are asleep; let them grow pale\nin their drowsiness, if they are disposed to do so, and pray do you\nremain in peace, who have no remorse to disturb you.\" Deep grief was\ndepicted on Morrel's features; he seized Monte Cristo's hand. \"But it is\nbeginning again, I say!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Count, astonished at his perseverance, which he could\nnot understand, and looking still more earnestly at Maximilian, \"let it\nbegin again,--it is like the house of the Atreidae; [*] God has condemned\nthem, and they must submit to their punishment. They will all disappear,\nlike the fabrics children build with cards, and which fall, one by one,\nunder the breath of their builder, even if there are two hundred of\nthem. Three months since it was M. de Saint-Meran; Madame de Saint-Meran\ntwo months since; the other day it was Barrois; to-day, the old\nNoirtier, or young Valentine.\"\n\n     * In the old Greek legend the Atreidae, or children of\n     Atreus, were doomed to punishment because of the abominable\n     crime of their father. The Agamemnon of Aeschylus is based\n     on this legend.\n\n\"You knew it?\" cried Morrel, in such a paroxysm of terror that Monte\nCristo started,--he whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved;\n\"you knew it, and said nothing?\"\n\n\"And what is it to me?\" replied Monte Cristo, shrugging his shoulders;\n\"do I know those people? and must I lose the one to save the other?\nFaith, no, for between the culprit and the victim I have no choice.\"\n\n\"But I,\" cried Morrel, groaning with sorrow, \"I love her!\"\n\n\"You love?--whom?\" cried Monte Cristo, starting to his feet, and seizing\nthe two hands which Morrel was raising towards heaven.\n\n\"I love most fondly--I love madly--I love as a man who would give his\nlife-blood to spare her a tear--I love Valentine de Villefort, who is\nbeing murdered at this moment! Do you understand me? I love her; and I\nask God and you how I can save her?\" Monte Cristo uttered a cry which\nthose only can conceive who have heard the roar of a wounded lion.\n\"Unhappy man,\" cried he, wringing his hands in his turn; \"you love\nValentine,--that daughter of an accursed race!\" Never had Morrel\nwitnessed such an expression--never had so terrible an eye flashed\nbefore his face--never had the genius of terror he had so often seen,\neither on the battle-field or in the murderous nights of Algeria, shaken\naround him more dreadful fire. He drew back terrified.\n\nAs for Monte Cristo, after this ebullition he closed his eyes as\nif dazzled by internal light. In a moment he restrained himself so\npowerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided, as\nturbulent and foaming waves yield to the sun's genial influence when the\ncloud has passed. This silence, self-control, and struggle lasted about\ntwenty seconds, then the count raised his pallid face. \"See,\" said he,\n\"my dear friend, how God punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling men\nfor their indifference, by presenting dreadful scenes to their view. I,\nwho was looking on, an eager and curious spectator,--I, who was watching\nthe working of this mournful tragedy,--I, who like a wicked angel was\nlaughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy (a secret is\neasily kept by the rich and powerful), I am in my turn bitten by the\nserpent whose tortuous course I was watching, and bitten to the heart!\"\n\nMorrel groaned. \"Come, come,\" continued the count, \"complaints are\nunavailing, be a man, be strong, be full of hope, for I am here and will\nwatch over you.\" Morrel shook his head sorrowfully. \"I tell you to\nhope. Do you understand me?\" cried Monte Cristo. \"Remember that I\nnever uttered a falsehood and am never deceived. It is twelve o'clock,\nMaximilian; thank heaven that you came at noon rather than in the\nevening, or to-morrow morning. Listen, Morrel--it is noon; if Valentine\nis not now dead, she will not die.\"\n\n\"How so?\" cried Morrel, \"when I left her dying?\" Monte Cristo pressed\nhis hands to his forehead. What was passing in that brain, so loaded\nwith dreadful secrets? What does the angel of light or the angel of\ndarkness say to that mind, at once implacable and generous? God only\nknows.\n\nMonte Cristo raised his head once more, and this time he was calm as\na child awaking from its sleep. \"Maximilian,\" said he, \"return home. I\ncommand you not to stir--attempt nothing, not to let your countenance\nbetray a thought, and I will send you tidings. Go.\"\n\n\"Oh, count, you overwhelm me with that coolness. Have you, then, power\nagainst death? Are you superhuman? Are you an angel?\" And the young\nman, who had never shrunk from danger, shrank before Monte Cristo with\nindescribable terror. But Monte Cristo looked at him with so melancholy\nand sweet a smile, that Maximilian felt the tears filling his eyes.\n\"I can do much for you, my friend,\" replied the count. \"Go; I must be\nalone.\" Morrel, subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy Monte Cristo\nexercised over everything around him, did not endeavor to resist it. He\npressed the count's hand and left. He stopped one moment at the door for\nBaptistin, whom he saw in the Rue Matignon, and who was running.\n\nMeanwhile, Villefort and d'Avrigny had made all possible haste,\nValentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival, and\nthe doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances\ndemanded, and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret\nintensified twofold. Villefort, closely watching his countenance and his\nlips, awaited the result of the examination. Noirtier, paler than even\nthe young girl, more eager than Villefort for the decision, was watching\nalso intently and affectionately. At last d'Avrigny slowly uttered these\nwords:--\"she is still alive!\"\n\n\"Still?\" cried Villefort; \"oh, doctor, what a dreadful word is that.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the physician, \"I repeat it; she is still alive, and I am\nastonished at it.\"\n\n\"But is she safe?\" asked the father.\n\n\"Yes, since she lives.\" At that moment d'Avrigny's glance met Noirtier's\neye. It glistened with such extraordinary joy, so rich and full of\nthought, that the physician was struck. He placed the young girl again\non the chair,--her lips were scarcely discernible, they were so pale and\nwhite, as well as her whole face,--and remained motionless, looking at\nNoirtier, who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did. \"Sir,\"\nsaid d'Avrigny to Villefort, \"call Mademoiselle Valentine's maid, if you\nplease.\" Villefort went himself to find her; and d'Avrigny approached\nNoirtier. \"Have you something to tell me?\" asked he. The old man\nwinked his eyes expressively, which we may remember was his only way of\nexpressing his approval.\n\n\"Privately?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, I will remain with you.\" At this moment Villefort returned,\nfollowed by the lady's maid; and after her came Madame de Villefort.\n\n\"What is the matter, then, with this dear child? she has just left me,\nand she complained of being indisposed, but I did not think seriously of\nit.\" The young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection\nof a true mother, approached Valentine and took her hand. D'Avrigny\ncontinued to look at Noirtier; he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and\nbecome round, his cheeks turn pale and tremble; the perspiration stood\nin drops upon his forehead. \"Ah,\" said he, involuntarily following\nNoirtier's eyes, which were fixed on Madame de Villefort, who\nrepeated,--\"This poor child would be better in bed. Come, Fanny, we\nwill put her to bed.\" M. d'Avrigny, who saw that would be a means of\nhis remaining alone with Noirtier, expressed his opinion that it was the\nbest thing that could be done; but he forbade that anything should be\ngiven to her except what he ordered.\n\nThey carried Valentine away; she had revived, but could scarcely move\nor speak, so shaken was her frame by the attack. She had, however, just\npower to give one parting look to her grandfather, who in losing her\nseemed to be resigning his very soul. D'Avrigny followed the invalid,\nwrote a prescription, ordered Villefort to take a cabriolet, go in\nperson to a chemist's to get the prescribed medicine, bring it himself,\nand wait for him in his daughter's room. Then, having renewed his\ninjunction not to give Valentine anything, he went down again to\nNoirtier, shut the doors carefully, and after convincing himself that\nno one was listening,--\"Do you,\" said he, \"know anything of this young\nlady's illness?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man.\n\n\"We have no time to lose; I will question, and do you answer me.\"\nNoirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer. \"Did you anticipate\nthe accident which has happened to your granddaughter?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" D'Avrigny reflected a moment; then approaching Noirtier,--\"Pardon\nwhat I am going to say,\" added he, \"but no indication should be\nneglected in this terrible situation. Did you see poor Barrois die?\"\nNoirtier raised his eyes to heaven. \"Do you know of what he died!\" asked\nd'Avrigny, placing his hand on Noirtier's shoulder.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the old man.\n\n\"Do you think he died a natural death?\" A sort of smile was discernible\non the motionless lips of Noirtier.\n\n\"Then you have thought that Barrois was poisoned?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck Barrois has now\nattacked Valentine?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then will she die too?\" asked d'Avrigny, fixing his penetrating gaze on\nNoirtier. He watched the effect of this question on the old man. \"No,\"\nreplied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the most\nclever diviner. \"Then you hope?\" said d'Avrigny, with surprise.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What do you hope?\" The old man made him understand with his eyes that\nhe could not answer. \"Ah, yes, it is true,\" murmured d'Avrigny. Then,\nturning to Noirtier,--\"Do you hope the assassin will be tried?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then you hope the poison will take no effect on Valentine?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It is no news to you,\" added d'Avrigny, \"to tell you that an\nattempt has been made to poison her?\" The old man made a sign that he\nentertained no doubt upon the subject. \"Then how do you hope Valentine\nwill escape?\" Noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same\nspot. D'Avrigny followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a\nbottle containing the mixture which he took every morning. \"Ah, indeed?\"\nsaid d'Avrigny, struck with a sudden thought, \"has it occurred to\nyou\"--Noirtier did not let him finish. \"Yes,\" said he. \"To prepare her\nsystem to resist poison?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"By accustoming her by degrees\"--\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes,\" said Noirtier, delighted to be understood.\n\n\"Of course. I had told you that there was brucine in the mixture I give\nyou.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And by accustoming her to that poison, you have endeavored to\nneutralize the effect of a similar poison?\" Noirtier's joy continued.\n\"And you have succeeded,\" exclaimed d'Avrigny. \"Without that precaution\nValentine would have died before assistance could have been procured.\nThe dose has been excessive, but she has only been shaken by it; and\nthis time, at any rate, Valentine will not die.\" A superhuman joy\nexpanded the old man's eyes, which were raised towards heaven with an\nexpression of infinite gratitude. At this moment Villefort returned.\n\"Here, doctor,\" said he, \"is what you sent me for.\"\n\n\"Was this prepared in your presence?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the procureur.\n\n\"Have you not let it go out of your hands?\"\n\n\"No.\" D'Avrigny took the bottle, poured some drops of the mixture it\ncontained in the hollow of his hand, and swallowed them. \"Well,\" said\nhe, \"let us go to Valentine; I will give instructions to every one, and\nyou, M. de Villefort, will yourself see that no one deviates from them.\"\n\nAt the moment when d'Avrigny was returning to Valentine's room,\naccompanied by Villefort, an Italian priest, of serious demeanor and\ncalm and firm tone, hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of\nM. de Villefort. No one knew how the three former tenants of that house\nleft it. About two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be\nunsafe; but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing\nhimself there with his modest furniture the same day at five o'clock.\nThe lease was drawn up for three, six, or nine years by the new tenant,\nwho, according to the rule of the proprietor, paid six months in\nadvance. This new tenant, who, as we have said, was an Italian, was\ncalled Il Signor Giacomo Busoni. Workmen were immediately called in,\nand that same night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with\nsurprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower\npart of the tottering house.\n\n\n\nChapter 95. Father and Daughter.\n\nWe saw in a preceding chapter how Madame Danglars went formally to\nannounce to Madame de Villefort the approaching marriage of Eugenie\nDanglars and M. Andrea Cavalcanti. This announcement, which implied or\nappeared to imply, the approval of all the persons concerned in this\nmomentous affair, had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must\nbe admitted. We beg them to take one step backward, and to transport\nthemselves, the morning of that day of great catastrophes, into the\nshowy, gilded salon we have before shown them, and which was the pride\nof its owner, Baron Danglars. In this room, at about ten o'clock in the\nmorning, the banker himself had been walking to and fro for some\nminutes thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness, watching both doors, and\nlistening to every sound. When his patience was exhausted, he called his\nvalet. \"Etienne,\" said he, \"see why Mademoiselle Eugenie has asked me to\nmeet her in the drawing-room, and why she makes me wait so long.\"\n\nHaving given this vent to his ill-humor, the baron became more calm;\nMademoiselle Danglars had that morning requested an interview with\nher father, and had fixed on the gilded drawing-room as the spot. The\nsingularity of this step, and above all its formality, had not a\nlittle surprised the banker, who had immediately obeyed his daughter\nby repairing first to the drawing-room. Etienne soon returned from his\nerrand. \"Mademoiselle's lady's maid says, sir, that mademoiselle is\nfinishing her toilette, and will be here shortly.\"\n\nDanglars nodded, to signify that he was satisfied. To the world and to\nhis servants Danglars assumed the character of the good-natured man and\nthe indulgent father. This was one of his parts in the popular comedy he\nwas performing,--a make-up he had adopted and which suited him about as\nwell as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors, who seen\nfrom one side, were the image of geniality, and from the other showed\nlips drawn down in chronic ill-temper. Let us hasten to say that in\nprivate the genial side descended to the level of the other, so that\ngenerally the indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal\nhusband and domineering father. \"Why the devil does that foolish girl,\nwho pretends to wish to speak to me, not come into my study? and why on\nearth does she want to speak to me at all?\"\n\nHe was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time,\nwhen the door opened and Eugenie appeared, attired in a figured black\nsatin dress, her hair dressed and gloves on, as if she were going to the\nItalian Opera. \"Well, Eugenie, what is it you want with me? and why in\nthis solemn drawing-room when the study is so comfortable?\"\n\n\"I quite understand why you ask, sir,\" said Eugenie, making a sign that\nher father might be seated, \"and in fact your two questions suggest\nfully the theme of our conversation. I will answer them both, and\ncontrary to the usual method, the last first, because it is the least\ndifficult. I have chosen the drawing-room, sir, as our place of meeting,\nin order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a\nbanker's study. Those gilded cashbooks, drawers locked like gates of\nfortresses, heaps of bank-bills, come from I know not where, and the\nquantities of letters from England, Holland, Spain, India, China, and\nPeru, have generally a strange influence on a father's mind, and make\nhim forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more\nsacred than the good opinion of his correspondents. I have, therefore,\nchosen this drawing-room, where you see, smiling and happy in their\nmagnificent frames, your portrait, mine, my mother's, and all sorts\nof rural landscapes and touching pastorals. I rely much on external\nimpressions; perhaps, with regard to you, they are immaterial, but I\nshould be no artist if I had not some fancies.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied M. Danglars, who had listened to all this preamble\nwith imperturbable coolness, but without understanding a word, since\nlike every man burdened with thoughts of the past, he was occupied with\nseeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker.\n\n\"There is, then, the second point cleared up, or nearly so,\" said\nEugenie, without the least confusion, and with that masculine\npointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language; \"and you\nappear satisfied with the explanation. Now, let us return to the first.\nYou ask me why I have requested this interview; I will tell you in two\nwords, sir; I will not marry count Andrea Cavalcanti.\"\n\nDanglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards\nheaven.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, sir,\" continued Eugenie, still quite calm; \"you are\nastonished, I see; for since this little affair began, I have not\nmanifested the slightest opposition, and yet I am always sure, when the\nopportunity arrives, to oppose a determined and absolute will to people\nwho have not consulted me, and things which displease me. However, this\ntime, my tranquillity, or passiveness as philosophers say, proceeded\nfrom another source; it proceeded from a wish, like a submissive and\ndevoted daughter\" (a slight smile was observable on the purple lips of\nthe young girl), \"to practice obedience.\"\n\n\"Well?\" asked Danglars.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" replied Eugenie, \"I have tried to the very last and now\nthat the moment has come, I feel in spite of all my efforts that it is\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Danglars, whose weak mind was at first quite overwhelmed\nwith the weight of this pitiless logic, marking evident premeditation\nand force of will, \"what is your reason for this refusal, Eugenie? what\nreason do you assign?\"\n\n\"My reason?\" replied the young girl. \"Well, it is not that the man is\nmore ugly, more foolish, or more disagreeable than any other; no,\nM. Andrea Cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men's faces and\nfigures as a very good specimen of his kind. It is not, either, that\nmy heart is less touched by him than any other; that would be a\nschoolgirl's reason, which I consider quite beneath me. I actually love\nno one, sir; you know it, do you not? I do not then see why, without\nreal necessity, I should encumber my life with a perpetual companion.\nHas not some sage said, 'Nothing too much'? and another, 'I carry all my\neffects with me'? I have been taught these two aphorisms in Latin and in\nGreek; one is, I believe, from Phaedrus, and the other from Bias.\nWell, my dear father, in the shipwreck of life--for life is an eternal\nshipwreck of our hopes--I cast into the sea my useless encumbrance, that\nis all, and I remain with my own will, disposed to live perfectly alone,\nand consequently perfectly free.\"\n\n\"Unhappy girl, unhappy girl!\" murmured Danglars, turning pale, for\nhe knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so\nsuddenly encountered.\n\n\"Unhappy girl,\" replied Eugenie, \"unhappy girl, do you say, sir? No,\nindeed; the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected. Happy, on\nthe contrary, for what am I in want of! The world calls me beautiful.\nIt is something to be well received. I like a favorable reception; it\nexpands the countenance, and those around me do not then appear so ugly.\nI possess a share of wit, and a certain relative sensibility, which\nenables me to draw from life in general, for the support of mine, all I\nmeet with that is good, like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its\ncontents. I am rich, for you have one of the first fortunes in France. I\nam your only daughter, and you are not so exacting as the fathers of the\nPorte Saint-Martin and Gaiete, who disinherit their daughters for not\ngiving them grandchildren. Besides, the provident law has deprived you\nof the power to disinherit me, at least entirely, as it has also of\nthe power to compel me to marry Monsieur This or Monsieur That. And\nso--being, beautiful, witty, somewhat talented, as the comic operas say,\nand rich--and that is happiness, sir--why do you call me unhappy?\"\n\nDanglars, seeing his daughter smiling, and proud even to insolence,\ncould not entirely repress his brutal feelings, but they betrayed\nthemselves only by an exclamation. Under the fixed and inquiring gaze\nlevelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows, he prudently\nturned away, and calmed himself immediately, daunted by the power of a\nresolute mind. \"Truly, my daughter,\" replied he with a smile, \"you are\nall you boast of being, excepting one thing; I will not too hastily tell\nyou which, but would rather leave you to guess it.\" Eugenie looked at\nDanglars, much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride, with\nwhich she had so superbly decked herself, should be disputed. \"My\ndaughter,\" continued the banker, \"you have perfectly explained to me the\nsentiments which influence a girl like you, who is determined she will\nnot marry; now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a father\nlike me, who has decided that his daughter shall marry.\" Eugenie\nbowed, not as a submissive daughter, but as an adversary prepared for a\ndiscussion.\n\n\"My daughter,\" continued Danglars, \"when a father asks his daughter to\nchoose a husband, he has always some reason for wishing her to marry.\nSome are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now, that of\nliving again in their grandchildren. This is not my weakness, I tell you\nat once; family joys have no charm for me. I may acknowledge this to\na daughter whom I know to be philosophical enough to understand my\nindifference, and not to impute it to me as a crime.\"\n\n\"This is not to the purpose,\" said Eugenie; \"let us speak candidly, sir;\nI admire candor.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Danglars, \"I can, when circumstances render it desirable,\nadopt your system, although it may not be my general practice. I will\ntherefore proceed. I have proposed to you to marry, not for your sake,\nfor indeed I did not think of you in the least at the moment (you admire\ncandor, and will now be satisfied, I hope); but because it suited me\nto marry you as soon as possible, on account of certain commercial\nspeculations I am desirous of entering into.\" Eugenie became uneasy.\n\n\"It is just as I tell you, I assure you, and you must not be angry with\nme, for you have sought this disclosure. I do not willingly enter into\narithmetical explanations with an artist like you, who fears to enter my\nstudy lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti-poetic impressions and\nsensations. But in that same banker's study, where you very willingly\npresented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs I give you\nmonthly for pocket-money, you must know, my dear young lady, that many\nthings may be learned, useful even to a girl who will not marry.\nThere one may learn, for instance, what, out of regard to your nervous\nsusceptibility, I will inform you of in the drawing-room, namely, that\nthe credit of a banker is his physical and moral life; that credit\nsustains him as breath animates the body; and M. de Monte Cristo once\ngave me a lecture on that subject, which I have never forgotten. There\nwe may learn that as credit sinks, the body becomes a corpse, and this\nis what must happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good\na logician as you for his daughter.\" But Eugenie, instead of stooping,\ndrew herself up under the blow. \"Ruined?\" said she.\n\n\"Exactly, my daughter; that is precisely what I mean,\" said Danglars,\nalmost digging his nails into his breast, while he preserved on\nhis harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man;\n\"ruined--yes, that is it.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Eugenie.\n\n\"Yes, ruined! Now it is revealed, this secret so full of horror, as\nthe tragic poet says. Now, my daughter, learn from my lips how you may\nalleviate this misfortune, so far as it will affect you.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" cried Eugenie, \"you are a bad physiognomist, if you imagine\nI deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn me. I\nruined? and what will that signify to me? Have I not my talent left? Can\nI not, like Pasta, Malibran, Grisi, acquire for myself what you would\nnever have given me, whatever might have been your fortune, a hundred\nor a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum, for which I shall be\nindebted to no one but myself; and which, instead of being given as\nyou gave me those poor twelve thousand francs, with sour looks and\nreproaches for my prodigality, will be accompanied with acclamations,\nwith bravos, and with flowers? And if I do not possess that talent,\nwhich your smiles prove to me you doubt, should I not still have that\nardent love of independence, which will be a substitute for wealth, and\nwhich in my mind supersedes even the instinct of self-preservation?\nNo, I grieve not on my own account, I shall always find a resource; my\nbooks, my pencils, my piano, all the things which cost but little, and\nwhich I shall be able to procure, will remain my own.\n\n\"Do you think that I sorrow for Madame Danglars? Undeceive yourself\nagain; either I am greatly mistaken, or she has provided against the\ncatastrophe which threatens you, and, which will pass over without\naffecting her. She has taken care for herself,--at least I hope so,--for\nher attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over\nme. She has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love\nfor liberty. Oh, no, sir; from my childhood I have seen too much, and\nunderstood too much, of what has passed around me, for misfortune to\nhave an undue power over me. From my earliest recollections, I have been\nbeloved by no one--so much the worse; that has naturally led me to love\nno one--so much the better--now you have my profession of faith.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Danglars, pale with anger, which was not at all due to\noffended paternal love,--\"then, mademoiselle, you persist in your\ndetermination to accelerate my ruin?\"\n\n\"Your ruin? I accelerate your ruin? What do you mean? I do not\nunderstand you.\"\n\n\"So much the better, I have a ray of hope left; listen.\"\n\n\"I am all attention,\" said Eugenie, looking so earnestly at her father\nthat it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze.\n\n\"M. Cavalcanti,\" continued Danglars, \"is about to marry you, and will\nplace in my hands his fortune, amounting to three million livres.\"\n\n\"That is admirable!\" said Eugenie with sovereign contempt, smoothing her\ngloves out one upon the other.\n\n\"You think I shall deprive you of those three millions,\" said Danglars;\n\"but do not fear it. They are destined to produce at least ten. I and a\nbrother banker have obtained a grant of a railway, the only industrial\nenterprise which in these days promises to make good the fabulous\nprospects that Law once held out to the eternally deluded Parisians, in\nthe fantastic Mississippi scheme. As I look at it, a millionth part of a\nrailway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks\nof the Ohio. We make in our case a deposit, on a mortgage, which is an\nadvance, as you see, since we gain at least ten, fifteen, twenty, or a\nhundred livres' worth of iron in exchange for our money. Well, within\na week I am to deposit four millions for my share; the four millions, I\npromise you, will produce ten or twelve.\"\n\n\"But during my visit to you the day before yesterday, sir, which you\nappear to recollect so well,\" replied Eugenie, \"I saw you arranging a\ndeposit--is not that the term?--of five millions and a half; you\neven pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury, and you\nwere astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like\nlightning.\"\n\n\"Yes, but those five millions and a half are not mine, and are only a\nproof of the great confidence placed in me; my title of popular banker\nhas gained me the confidence of charitable institutions, and the five\nmillions and a half belong to them; at any other time I should not have\nhesitated to make use of them, but the great losses I have recently\nsustained are well known, and, as I told you, my credit is rather\nshaken. That deposit may be at any moment withdrawn, and if I had\nemployed it for another purpose, I should bring on me a disgraceful\nbankruptcy. I do not despise bankruptcies, believe me, but they must\nbe those which enrich, not those which ruin. Now, if you marry M.\nCavalcanti, and I get the three millions, or even if it is thought I am\ngoing to get them, my credit will be restored, and my fortune, which\nfor the last month or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have\nbeen opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality, will revive. Do you\nunderstand me?\"\n\n\"Perfectly; you pledge me for three millions, do you not?\"\n\n\"The greater the amount, the more flattering it is to you; it gives you\nan idea of your value.\"\n\n\"Thank you. One word more, sir; do you promise me to make what use\nyou can of the report of the fortune M. Cavalcanti will bring without\ntouching the money? This is no act of selfishness, but of delicacy. I am\nwilling to help rebuild your fortune, but I will not be an accomplice in\nthe ruin of others.\"\n\n\"But since I tell you,\" cried Danglars, \"that with these three\nmillion\"--\n\n\"Do you expect to recover your position, sir, without touching those\nthree million?\"\n\n\"I hope so, if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit.\"\n\n\"Shall you be able to pay M. Cavalcanti the five hundred thousand francs\nyou promise for my dowry?\"\n\n\"He shall receive them on returning from the mayor's.\" [*]\n\n     * The performance of the civil marriage.\n\n\"Very well!\"\n\n\"What next? what more do you want?\"\n\n\"I wish to know if, in demanding my signature, you leave me entirely\nfree in my person?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"Then, as I said before, sir,--very well; I am ready to marry M.\nCavalcanti.\"\n\n\"But what are you up to?\"\n\n\"Ah, that is my affair. What advantage should I have over you, if\nknowing your secret I were to tell you mine?\" Danglars bit his lips.\n\"Then,\" said he, \"you are ready to pay the official visits, which are\nabsolutely indispensable?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Eugenie.\n\n\"And to sign the contract in three days?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then, in my turn, I also say, very well!\" Danglars pressed his\ndaughter's hand in his. But, extraordinary to relate, the father did not\nsay, \"Thank you, my child,\" nor did the daughter smile at her father.\n\"Is the conference ended?\" asked Eugenie, rising. Danglars motioned that\nhe had nothing more to say. Five minutes afterwards the piano resounded\nto the touch of Mademoiselle d'Armilly's fingers, and Mademoiselle\nDanglars was singing Brabantio's malediction on Desdemona. At the end of\nthe piece Etienne entered, and announced to Eugenie that the horses were\nin the carriage, and that the baroness was waiting for her to pay her\nvisits. We have seen them at Villefort's; they proceeded then on their\ncourse.\n\n\n\nChapter 96. The Contract.\n\nThree days after the scene we have just described, namely towards five\no'clock in the afternoon of the day fixed for the signature of\nthe contract between Mademoiselle Eugenie Danglars and Andrea\nCavalcanti,--whom the banker persisted in calling prince,--a fresh\nbreeze was stirring the leaves in the little garden in front of the\nCount of Monte Cristo's house, and the count was preparing to go out.\nWhile his horses were impatiently pawing the ground,--held in by the\ncoachman, who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box,--the\nelegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of\nthe entrance-gate, and cast out on the doorsteps M. Andrea Cavalcanti,\nas decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a princess. He\ninquired after the count with his usual familiarity, and ascending\nlightly to the second story met him at the top of the stairs. The count\nstopped on seeing the young man. As for Andrea, he was launched, and\nwhen he was once launched nothing stopped him. \"Ah, good morning,\nmy dear count,\" said he. \"Ah, M. Andrea,\" said the latter, with his\nhalf-jesting tone; \"how do you do.\"\n\n\"Charmingly, as you see. I am come to talk to you about a thousand\nthings; but, first tell me, were you going out or just returned?\"\n\n\"I was going out, sir.\"\n\n\"Then, in order not to hinder you, I will get up with you if you please\nin your carriage, and Tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the count, with an imperceptible smile of contempt, for\nhe had no wish to be seen in the young man's society,--\"no; I prefer\nlistening to you here, my dear M. Andrea; we can chat better in-doors,\nand there is no coachman to overhear our conversation.\" The count\nreturned to a small drawing-room on the first floor, sat down, and\ncrossing his legs motioned to the young man to take a seat also. Andrea\nassumed his gayest manner. \"You know, my dear count,\" said he, \"the\nceremony is to take place this evening. At nine o'clock the contract is\nto be signed at my father-in-law's.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed?\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"What; is it news to you? Has not M. Danglars informed you of the\nceremony?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the count; \"I received a letter from him yesterday, but\nI do not think the hour was mentioned.\"\n\n\"Possibly my father-in-law trusted to its general notoriety.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Monte Cristo, \"you are fortunate, M. Cavalcanti; it is a\nmost suitable alliance you are contracting, and Mademoiselle Danglars is\na handsome girl.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed she is,\" replied Cavalcanti, in a very modest tone.\n\n\"Above all, she is very rich,--at least, I believe so,\" said Monte\nCristo.\n\n\"Very rich, do you think?\" replied the young man.\n\n\"Doubtless; it is said M. Danglars conceals at least half of his\nfortune.\"\n\n\"And he acknowledges fifteen or twenty millions,\" said Andrea with a\nlook sparkling with joy.\n\n\"Without reckoning,\" added Monte Cristo, \"that he is on the eve of\nentering into a sort of speculation already in vogue in the United\nStates and in England, but quite novel in France.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know what you mean,--the railway, of which he has obtained\nthe grant, is it not?\"\n\n\"Precisely; it is generally believed he will gain ten millions by that\naffair.\"\n\n\"Ten millions! Do you think so? It is magnificent!\" said Cavalcanti,\nwho was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words.\n\"Without reckoning,\" replied Monte Cristo, \"that all his fortune will\ncome to you, and justly too, since Mademoiselle Danglars is an only\ndaughter. Besides, your own fortune, as your father assured me, is\nalmost equal to that of your betrothed. But enough of money matters.\nDo you know, M. Andrea, I think you have managed this affair rather\nskilfully?\"\n\n\"Not badly, by any means,\" said the young man; \"I was born for a\ndiplomatist.\"\n\n\"Well, you must become a diplomatist; diplomacy, you know, is something\nthat is not to be acquired; it is instinctive. Have you lost your\nheart?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I fear it,\" replied Andrea, in the tone in which he had heard\nDorante or Valere reply to Alceste [*] at the Theatre Francais.\n\n\"Is your love returned?\"\n\n     * In Moliere's comedy, Le Misanthrope.\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Andrea with a triumphant smile, \"since I am\naccepted. But I must not forget one grand point.\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"That I have been singularly assisted.\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"I have, indeed.\"\n\n\"By circumstances?\"\n\n\"No; by you.\"\n\n\"By me? Not at all, prince,\" said Monte Cristo laying a marked stress\non the title, \"what have I done for you? Are not your name, your social\nposition, and your merit sufficient?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Andrea,--\"no; it is useless for you to say so, count. I\nmaintain that the position of a man like you has done more than my name,\nmy social position, and my merit.\"\n\n\"You are completely mistaken, sir,\" said Monte Cristo coldly, who felt\nthe perfidious manoeuvre of the young man, and understood the bearing\nof his words; \"you only acquired my protection after the influence\nand fortune of your father had been ascertained; for, after all, who\nprocured for me, who had never seen either you or your illustrious\nfather, the pleasure of your acquaintance?--two of my good friends,\nLord Wilmore and the Abbe Busoni. What encouraged me not to become your\nsurety, but to patronize you?--your father's name, so well known in\nItaly and so highly honored. Personally, I do not know you.\" This calm\ntone and perfect ease made Andrea feel that he was, for the moment,\nrestrained by a more muscular hand than his own, and that the restraint\ncould not be easily broken through.\n\n\"Oh, then my father has really a very large fortune, count?\"\n\n\"It appears so, sir,\" replied Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Do you know if the marriage settlement he promised me has come?\"\n\n\"I have been advised of it.\"\n\n\"But the three millions?\"\n\n\"The three millions are probably on the road.\"\n\n\"Then I shall really have them?\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said the count, \"I do not think you have yet known the want\nof money.\" Andrea was so surprised that he pondered the matter for a\nmoment. Then, arousing from his revery,--\"Now, sir, I have one request\nto make to you, which you will understand, even if it should be\ndisagreeable to you.\"\n\n\"Proceed,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"I have formed an acquaintance, thanks to my good fortune, with many\nnoted persons, and have, at least for the moment, a crowd of friends.\nBut marrying, as I am about to do, before all Paris, I ought to be\nsupported by an illustrious name, and in the absence of the paternal\nhand some powerful one ought to lead me to the altar; now, my father is\nnot coming to Paris, is he? He is old, covered with wounds, and suffers\ndreadfully, he says, in travelling.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"Well, I am come to ask a favor of you.\"\n\n\"Of me?\"\n\n\"Yes, of you.\"\n\n\"And pray what may it be?\"\n\n\"Well, to take his part.\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear sir! What?--after the varied relations I have had the\nhappiness to sustain towards you, can it be that you know me so little\nas to ask such a thing? Ask me to lend you half a million and, although\nsuch a loan is somewhat rare, on my honor, you would annoy me less!\nKnow, then, what I thought I had already told you, that in participation\nin this world's affairs, more especially in their moral aspects, the\nCount of Monte Cristo has never ceased to entertain the scruples and\neven the superstitions of the East. I, who have a seraglio at Cairo, one\nat Smyrna, and one at Constantinople, preside at a wedding?--never!\"\n\n\"Then you refuse me?\"\n\n\"Decidedly; and were you my son or my brother I would refuse you in the\nsame way.\"\n\n\"But what must be done?\" said Andrea, disappointed.\n\n\"You said just now that you had a hundred friends.\"\n\n\"Very true, but you introduced me at M. Danglars'.\"\n\n\"Not at all! Let us recall the exact facts. You met him at a dinner\nparty at my house, and you introduced yourself at his house; that is a\ntotally different affair.\"\n\n\"Yes, but, by my marriage, you have forwarded that.\"\n\n\"I?--not in the least, I beg you to believe. Recollect what I told you\nwhen you asked me to propose you. 'Oh, I never make matches, my dear\nprince, it is my settled principle.'\" Andrea bit his lips.\n\n\"But, at least, you will be there?\"\n\n\"Will all Paris be there?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly.\"\n\n\"Well, like all Paris, I shall be there too,\" said the count.\n\n\"And will you sign the contract?\"\n\n\"I see no objection to that; my scruples do not go thus far.\"\n\n\"Well, since you will grant me no more, I must be content with what you\ngive me. But one word more, count.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Advice.\"\n\n\"Be careful; advice is worse than a service.\"\n\n\"Oh, you can give me this without compromising yourself.\"\n\n\"Tell me what it is.\"\n\n\"Is my wife's fortune five hundred thousand livres?\"\n\n\"That is the sum M. Danglars himself announced.\"\n\n\"Must I receive it, or leave it in the hands of the notary?\"\n\n\"This is the way such affairs are generally arranged when it is wished\nto do them stylishly: Your two solicitors appoint a meeting, when\nthe contract is signed, for the next or the following day; then they\nexchange the two portions, for which they each give a receipt; then,\nwhen the marriage is celebrated, they place the amount at your disposal\nas the chief member of the alliance.\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Andrea, with a certain ill-concealed uneasiness, \"I\nthought I heard my father-in-law say that he intended embarking our\nproperty in that famous railway affair of which you spoke just now.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Monte Cristo, \"it will be the way, everybody says, of\ntrebling your fortune in twelve months. Baron Danglars is a good father,\nand knows how to calculate.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Andrea, \"everything is all right, excepting your\nrefusal, which quite grieves me.\"\n\n\"You must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Andrea, \"let it be as you wish. This evening, then, at nine\no'clock.\"\n\n\"Adieu till then.\" Notwithstanding a slight resistance on the part of\nMonte Cristo, whose lips turned pale, but who preserved his ceremonious\nsmile, Andrea seized the count's hand, pressed it, jumped into his\nphaeton, and disappeared.\n\nThe four or five remaining hours before nine o'clock arrived, Andrea\nemployed in riding, paying visits,--designed to induce those of whom\nhe had spoken to appear at the banker's in their gayest\nequipages,--dazzling them by promises of shares in schemes which have\nsince turned every brain, and in which Danglars was just taking the\ninitiative. In fact, at half-past eight in the evening the grand salon,\nthe gallery adjoining, and the three other drawing-rooms on the same\nfloor, were filled with a perfumed crowd, who sympathized but little\nin the event, but who all participated in that love of being present\nwherever there is anything fresh to be seen. An Academician would say\nthat the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of\nflowers which attract inconstant butterflies, famished bees, and buzzing\ndrones.\n\nNo one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated; the light\nstreamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings; and all the\nbad taste of decorations, which had only their richness to boast of,\nshone in its splendor. Mademoiselle Eugenie was dressed with elegant\nsimplicity in a figured white silk dress, and a white rose half\nconcealed in her jet black hair was her only ornament, unaccompanied\nby a single jewel. Her eyes, however, betrayed that perfect confidence\nwhich contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire. Madame\nDanglars was chatting at a short distance with Debray, Beauchamp, and\nChateau-Renaud.\n\nDebray was admitted to the house for this grand ceremony, but on the\nsame plane with every one else, and without any particular privilege. M.\nDanglars, surrounded by deputies and men connected with the revenue, was\nexplaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when\nthe course of events had compelled the government to call him into the\nministry. Andrea, on whose arm hung one of the most consummate dandies\nof the opera, was explaining to him rather cleverly, since he was\nobliged to be bold to appear at ease, his future projects, and the new\nluxuries he meant to introduce to Parisian fashions with his hundred and\nseventy-five thousand livres per annum.\n\nThe crowd moved to and fro in the rooms like an ebb and flow of\nturquoises, rubies, emeralds, opals, and diamonds. As usual, the oldest\nwomen were the most decorated, and the ugliest the most conspicuous. If\nthere was a beautiful lily, or a sweet rose, you had to search for it,\nconcealed in some corner behind a mother with a turban, or an aunt with\na bird of paradise.\n\nAt each moment, in the midst of the crowd, the buzzing, and the\nlaughter, the door-keeper's voice was heard announcing some name well\nknown in the financial department, respected in the army, or illustrious\nin the literary world, and which was acknowledged by a slight movement\nin the different groups. But for one whose privilege it was to agitate\nthat ocean of human waves, how many were received with a look of\nindifference or a sneer of disdain! At the moment when the hand of the\nmassive time-piece, representing Endymion asleep, pointed to nine on its\ngolden face, and the hammer, the faithful type of mechanical thought,\nstruck nine times, the name of the Count of Monte Cristo resounded in\nits turn, and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards\nthe door.\n\nThe count was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity; his\nwhite waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black\nstock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly\npaleness of his face. His only jewellery was a chain, so fine that the\nslender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat. A\ncircle was immediately formed around the door. The count perceived at\none glance Madame Danglars at one end of the drawing-room, M. Danglars\nat the other, and Eugenie in front of him. He first advanced towards the\nbaroness, who was chatting with Madame de Villefort, who had come alone,\nValentine being still an invalid; and without turning aside, so clear\nwas the road left for him, he passed from the baroness to Eugenie, whom\nhe complimented in such rapid and measured terms, that the proud artist\nwas quite struck. Near her was Mademoiselle Louise d'Armilly, who\nthanked the count for the letters of introduction he had so kindly given\nher for Italy, which she intended immediately to make use of. On leaving\nthese ladies he found himself with Danglars, who had advanced to meet\nhim.\n\nHaving accomplished these three social duties, Monte Cristo stopped,\nlooking around him with that expression peculiar to a certain class,\nwhich seems to say, \"I have done my duty, now let others do theirs.\"\nAndrea, who was in an adjoining room, had shared in the sensation caused\nby the arrival of Monte Cristo, and now came forward to pay his respects\nto the count. He found him completely surrounded; all were eager to\nspeak to him, as is always the case with those whose words are few\nand weighty. The solicitors arrived at this moment and arranged their\nscrawled papers on the velvet cloth embroidered with gold which covered\nthe table prepared for the signature; it was a gilt table supported on\nlions' claws. One of the notaries sat down, the other remained standing.\nThey were about to proceed to the reading of the contract, which half\nParis assembled was to sign. All took their places, or rather the ladies\nformed a circle, while the gentlemen (more indifferent to the restraints\nof what Boileau calls the \"energetic style\") commented on the feverish\nagitation of Andrea, on M. Danglars' riveted attention, Eugenie's\ncomposure, and the light and sprightly manner in which the baroness\ntreated this important affair.\n\nThe contract was read during a profound silence. But as soon as it was\nfinished, the buzz was redoubled through all the drawing-rooms; the\nbrilliant sums, the rolling millions which were to be at the command\nof the two young people, and which crowned the display of the wedding\npresents and the young lady's diamonds, which had been made in a room\nentirely appropriated for that purpose, had exercised to the full their\ndelusions over the envious assembly. Mademoiselle Danglars' charms were\nheightened in the opinion of the young men, and for the moment seemed\nto outvie the sun in splendor. As for the ladies, it is needless to say\nthat while they coveted the millions, they thought they did not need\nthem for themselves, as they were beautiful enough without them. Andrea,\nsurrounded by his friends, complimented, flattered, beginning to believe\nin the reality of his dream, was almost bewildered. The notary solemnly\ntook the pen, flourished it above his head, and said, \"Gentlemen, we are\nabout to sign the contract.\"\n\nThe baron was to sign first, then the representative of M. Cavalcanti,\nsenior, then the baroness, afterwards the \"future couple,\" as they are\nstyled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents. The baron took\nthe pen and signed, then the representative. The baroness approached,\nleaning on Madame de Villefort's arm. \"My dear,\" said she, as she took\nthe pen, \"is it not vexatious? An unexpected incident, in the affair of\nmurder and theft at the Count of Monte Cristo's, in which he nearly fell\na victim, deprives us of the pleasure of seeing M. de Villefort.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said M. Danglars, in the same tone in which he would have\nsaid, \"Oh, well, what do I care?\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact,\" said Monte Cristo, approaching, \"I am much afraid\nthat I am the involuntary cause of his absence.\"\n\n\"What, you, count?\" said Madame Danglars, signing; \"if you are, take\ncare, for I shall never forgive you.\" Andrea pricked up his ears.\n\n\"But it is not my fault, as I shall endeavor to prove.\" Every one\nlistened eagerly; Monte Cristo who so rarely opened his lips, was about\nto speak. \"You remember,\" said the count, during the most profound\nsilence, \"that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my house;\nthe supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice, on attempting\nto leave it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Danglars.\n\n\"In order that his wounds might be examined he was undressed, and his\nclothes were thrown into a corner, where the police picked them up, with\nthe exception of the waistcoat, which they overlooked.\" Andrea turned\npale, and drew towards the door; he saw a cloud rising in the horizon,\nwhich appeared to forebode a coming storm.\n\n\"Well, this waistcoat was discovered to-day, covered with blood, and\nwith a hole over the heart.\" The ladies screamed, and two or three\nprepared to faint. \"It was brought to me. No one could guess what the\ndirty rag could be; I alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the\nmurdered man. My valet, in examining this mournful relic, felt a paper\nin the pocket and drew it out; it was a letter addressed to you, baron.\"\n\n\"To me?\" cried Danglars.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, to you; I succeeded in deciphering your name under the\nblood with which the letter was stained,\" replied Monte Cristo, amid the\ngeneral outburst of amazement.\n\n\"But,\" asked Madame Danglars, looking at her husband with uneasiness,\n\"how could that prevent M. de Villefort\"--\n\n\"In this simple way, madame,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"the waistcoat and\nthe letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence; I therefore\nsent them to the king's attorney. You understand, my dear baron, that\nlegal methods are the safest in criminal cases; it was, perhaps,\nsome plot against you.\" Andrea looked steadily at Monte Cristo and\ndisappeared in the second drawing-room.\n\n\"Possibly,\" said Danglars; \"was not this murdered man an old\ngalley-slave?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the count; \"a felon named Caderousse.\" Danglars\nturned slightly pale; Andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little\ndrawing-room.\n\n\"But go on signing,\" said Monte Cristo; \"I perceive that my story has\ncaused a general emotion, and I beg to apologize to you, baroness, and\nto Mademoiselle Danglars.\" The baroness, who had signed, returned\nthe pen to the notary. \"Prince Cavalcanti,\" said the latter; \"Prince\nCavalcanti, where are you?\"\n\n\"Andrea, Andrea,\" repeated several young people, who were already on\nsufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his Christian name.\n\n\"Call the prince; inform him that it is his turn to sign,\" cried\nDanglars to one of the floorkeepers.\n\nBut at the same instant the crowd of guests rushed in alarm into the\nprincipal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the apartments,\nquaerens quem devoret. There was, indeed, reason to retreat, to be\nalarmed, and to scream. An officer was placing two soldiers at the door\nof each drawing-room, and was advancing towards Danglars, preceded by a\ncommissary of police, girded with his scarf. Madame Danglars uttered a\nscream and fainted. Danglars, who thought himself threatened (certain\nconsciences are never calm),--Danglars even before his guests showed a\ncountenance of abject terror.\n\n\"What is the matter, sir?\" asked Monte Cristo, advancing to meet the\ncommissioner.\n\n\"Which of you gentlemen,\" asked the magistrate, without replying to the\ncount, \"answers to the name of Andrea Cavalcanti?\" A cry of astonishment\nwas heard from all parts of the room. They searched; they questioned.\n\"But who then is Andrea Cavalcanti?\" asked Danglars in amazement.\n\n\"A galley-slave, escaped from confinement at Toulon.\"\n\n\"And what crime has he committed?\"\n\n\"He is accused,\" said the commissary with his inflexible voice, \"of\nhaving assassinated the man named Caderousse, his former companion in\nprison, at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the\nCount of Monte Cristo.\" Monte Cristo cast a rapid glance around him.\nAndrea was gone.\n\n\n\nChapter 97. The Departure for Belgium.\n\nA few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of M.\nDanglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers, and by\nthe disclosure which had followed, the mansion was deserted with as\nmuch rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out\namong the guests. In a few minutes, through all the doors, down all the\nstaircases, by every exit, every one hastened to retire, or rather to\nfly; for it was a situation where the ordinary condolences,--which even\nthe best friends are so eager to offer in great catastrophes,--were\nseen to be utterly futile. There remained in the banker's house only\nDanglars, closeted in his study, and making his statement to the officer\nof gendarmes; Madame Danglars, terrified, in the boudoir with which we\nare acquainted; and Eugenie, who with haughty air and disdainful lip had\nretired to her room with her inseparable companion, Mademoiselle Louise\nd'Armilly. As for the numerous servants (more numerous that evening than\nusual, for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the Cafe\nde Paris), venting on their employers their anger at what they termed\nthe insult to which they had been subjected, they collected in groups\nin the hall, in the kitchens, or in their rooms, thinking very little of\ntheir duty, which was thus naturally interrupted. Of all this household,\nonly two persons deserve our notice; these are Mademoiselle Eugenie\nDanglars and Mademoiselle Louise d'Armilly.\n\nThe betrothed had retired, as we said, with haughty air, disdainful lip,\nand the demeanor of an outraged queen, followed by her companion, who\nwas paler and more disturbed than herself. On reaching her room Eugenie\nlocked her door, while Louise fell on a chair. \"Ah, what a dreadful\nthing,\" said the young musician; \"who would have suspected it? M. Andrea\nCavalcanti a murderer--a galley-slave escaped--a convict!\" An ironical\nsmile curled the lip of Eugenie. \"In truth I was fated,\" said she. \"I\nescaped the Morcerf only to fall into the Cavalcanti.\"\n\n\"Oh, do not confound the two, Eugenie.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue! The men are all infamous, and I am happy to be able\nnow to do more than detest them--I despise them.\"\n\n\"What shall we do?\" asked Louise.\n\n\"What shall we do?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why, the same we had intended doing three days since--set off.\"\n\n\"What?--although you are not now going to be married, you intend\nstill\"--\n\n\"Listen, Louise. I hate this life of the fashionable world, always\nordered, measured, ruled, like our music-paper. What I have always\nwished for, desired, and coveted, is the life of an artist, free and\nindependent, relying only on my own resources, and accountable only to\nmyself. Remain here? What for?--that they may try, a month hence,\nto marry me again; and to whom?--M. Debray, perhaps, as it was once\nproposed. No, Louise, no! This evening's adventure will serve for my\nexcuse. I did not seek one, I did not ask for one. God sends me this,\nand I hail it joyfully!\"\n\n\"How strong and courageous you are!\" said the fair, frail girl to her\nbrunette companion.\n\n\"Did you not yet know me? Come, Louise, let us talk of our affairs. The\npost-chaise\"--\n\n\"Was happily bought three days since.\"\n\n\"Have you had it sent where we are to go for it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Our passport?\"\n\n\"Here it is.\"\n\nAnd Eugenie, with her usual precision, opened a printed paper, and\nread,--\n\n\"M. Leon d'Armilly, twenty years of age; profession, artist; hair black,\neyes black; travelling with his sister.\"\n\n\"Capital! How did you get this passport?\"\n\n\"When I went to ask M. de Monte Cristo for letters to the directors of\nthe theatres at Rome and Naples, I expressed my fears of travelling as\na woman; he perfectly understood them, and undertook to procure for me\na man's passport, and two days after I received this, to which I have\nadded with my own hand, 'travelling with his sister.'\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Eugenie cheerfully, \"we have then only to pack up our\ntrunks; we shall start the evening of the signing of the contract,\ninstead of the evening of the wedding--that is all.\"\n\n\"But consider the matter seriously, Eugenie!\"\n\n\"Oh, I am done with considering! I am tired of hearing only of market\nreports, of the end of the month, of the rise and fall of Spanish funds,\nof Haitian bonds. Instead of that, Louise--do you understand?--air,\nliberty, melody of birds, plains of Lombardy, Venetian canals, Roman\npalaces, the Bay of Naples. How much have we, Louise?\" The young girl to\nwhom this question was addressed drew from an inlaid secretary a small\nportfolio with a lock, in which she counted twenty-three bank-notes.\n\n\"Twenty-three thousand francs,\" said she.\n\n\"And as much, at least, in pearls, diamonds, and jewels,\" said\nEugenie. \"We are rich. With forty-five thousand francs we can live\nlike princesses for two years, and comfortably for four; but before six\nmonths--you with your music, and I with my voice--we shall double our\ncapital. Come, you shall take charge of the money, I of the jewel-box;\nso that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure, the other\nwould still have hers left. Now, the portmanteau--let us make haste--the\nportmanteau!\"\n\n\"Stop!\" said Louise, going to listen at Madame Danglars' door.\n\n\"What do you fear?\"\n\n\"That we may be discovered.\"\n\n\"The door is locked.\"\n\n\"They may tell us to open it.\"\n\n\"They may if they like, but we will not.\"\n\n\"You are a perfect Amazon, Eugenie!\" And the two young girls began\nto heap into a trunk all the things they thought they should require.\n\"There now,\" said Eugenie, \"while I change my costume do you lock the\nportmanteau.\" Louise pressed with all the strength of her little hands\non the top of the portmanteau. \"But I cannot,\" said she; \"I am not\nstrong enough; do you shut it.\"\n\n\"Ah, you do well to ask,\" said Eugenie, laughing; \"I forgot that I was\nHercules, and you only the pale Omphale!\" And the young girl, kneeling\non the top, pressed the two parts of the portmanteau together, and\nMademoiselle d'Armilly passed the bolt of the padlock through. When this\nwas done, Eugenie opened a drawer, of which she kept the key, and took\nfrom it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak. \"Here,\" said she, \"you\nsee I have thought of everything; with this cloak you will not be cold.\"\n\n\"But you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am never cold, you know! Besides, with these men's clothes\"--\n\n\"Will you dress here?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Shall you have time?\"\n\n\"Do not be uneasy, you little coward! All our servants are busy,\ndiscussing the grand affair. Besides, what is there astonishing, when\nyou think of the grief I ought to be in, that I shut myself up?--tell\nme!\"\n\n\"No, truly--you comfort me.\"\n\n\"Come and help me.\"\n\nFrom the same drawer she took a man's complete costume, from the\nboots to the coat, and a provision of linen, where there was nothing\nsuperfluous, but every requisite. Then, with a promptitude which\nindicated that this was not the first time she had amused herself by\nadopting the garb of the opposite sex, Eugenie drew on the boots and\npantaloons, tied her cravat, buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat,\nand put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure. \"Oh, that\nis very good--indeed, it is very good!\" said Louise, looking at her with\nadmiration; \"but that beautiful black hair, those magnificent braids,\nwhich made all the ladies sigh with envy,--will they go under a man's\nhat like the one I see down there?\"\n\n\"You shall see,\" said Eugenie. And with her left hand seizing the thick\nmass, which her long fingers could scarcely grasp, she took in her right\nhand a pair of long scissors, and soon the steel met through the rich\nand splendid hair, which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned\nback to keep it from her coat. Then she grasped the front hair, which\nshe also cut off, without expressing the least regret; on the contrary,\nher eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony\neyebrows. \"Oh, the magnificent hair!\" said Louise, with regret.\n\n\"And am I not a hundred times better thus?\" cried Eugenie, smoothing the\nscattered curls of her hair, which had now quite a masculine appearance;\n\"and do you not think me handsomer so?\"\n\n\"Oh, you are beautiful--always beautiful!\" cried Louise. \"Now, where are\nyou going?\"\n\n\"To Brussels, if you like; it is the nearest frontier. We can go to\nBrussels, Liege, Aix-la-Chapelle; then up the Rhine to Strasburg. We\nwill cross Switzerland, and go down into Italy by the Saint-Gothard.\nWill that do?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What are you looking at?\"\n\n\"I am looking at you; indeed you are adorable like that! One would say\nyou were carrying me off.\"\n\n\"And they would be right, pardieu!\"\n\n\"Oh, I think you swore, Eugenie.\" And the two young girls, whom every\none might have thought plunged in grief, the one on her own account, the\nother from interest in her friend, burst out laughing, as they cleared\naway every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied\nthe preparations for their escape. Then, having blown out the lights,\nthe two fugitives, looking and listening eagerly, with outstretched\nnecks, opened the door of a dressing-room which led by a side staircase\ndown to the yard,--Eugenie going first, and holding with one arm\nthe portmanteau, which by the opposite handle Mademoiselle d'Armilly\nscarcely raised with both hands. The yard was empty; the clock was\nstriking twelve. The porter was not yet gone to bed. Eugenie approached\nsoftly, and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an arm-chair in his\nlodge. She returned to Louise, took up the portmanteau, which she had\nplaced for a moment on the ground, and they reached the archway under\nthe shadow of the wall.\n\nEugenie concealed Louise in an angle of the gateway, so that if the\nporter chanced to awake he might see but one person. Then placing\nherself in the full light of the lamp which lit the yard,--\"Gate!\" cried\nshe, with her finest contralto voice, and rapping at the window.\n\nThe porter got up as Eugenie expected, and even advanced some steps to\nrecognize the person who was going out, but seeing a young man striking\nhis boot impatiently with his riding-whip, he opened it immediately.\nLouise slid through the half-open gate like a snake, and bounded lightly\nforward. Eugenie, apparently calm, although in all probability her heart\nbeat somewhat faster than usual, went out in her turn. A porter was\npassing and they gave him the portmanteau; then the two young girls,\nhaving told him to take it to No. 36, Rue de la Victoire, walked behind\nthis man, whose presence comforted Louise. As for Eugenie, she was as\nstrong as a Judith or a Delilah. They arrived at the appointed spot.\nEugenie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau, gave him some\npieces of money, and having rapped at the shutter sent him away. The\nshutter where Eugenie had rapped was that of a little laundress, who\nhad been previously warned, and was not yet gone to bed. She opened the\ndoor.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said Eugenie, \"let the porter get the post-chaise from\nthe coach-house, and fetch some post-horses from the hotel. Here are\nfive francs for his trouble.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Louise, \"I admire you, and I could almost say respect\nyou.\" The laundress looked on in astonishment, but as she had been\npromised twenty louis, she made no remark.\n\nIn a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post-boy and horses,\nwhich were harnessed, and put in the post-chaise in a minute, while the\nporter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and\nstrap. \"Here is the passport,\" said the postilion, \"which way are we\ngoing, young gentleman?\"\n\n\"To Fontainebleau,\" replied Eugenie with an almost masculine voice.\n\n\"What do you say?\" said Louise.\n\n\"I am giving them the slip,\" said Eugenie; \"this woman to whom we have\ngiven twenty louis may betray us for forty; we will soon alter our\ndirection.\" And the young girl jumped into the britzska, which was\nadmirably arranged for sleeping in, without scarcely touching the step.\n\"You are always right,\" said the music teacher, seating herself by the\nside of her friend.\n\nA quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion, having been put in the\nright road, passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the\nBarriere Saint-Martin. \"Ah,\" said Louise, breathing freely, \"here we are\nout of Paris.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, the abduction is an accomplished fact,\" replied Eugenie.\n\"Yes, and without violence,\" said Louise.\n\n\"I shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance,\" replied\nEugenie. These words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in\nrolling over the pavement of La Villette. M. Danglars no longer had a\ndaughter.\n\n\n\nChapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern.\n\nAnd now let us leave Mademoiselle Danglars and her friend pursuing their\nway to Brussels, and return to poor Andrea Cavalcanti, so inopportunely\ninterrupted in his rise to fortune. Notwithstanding his youth, Master\nAndrea was a very skilful and intelligent boy. We have seen that on\nthe first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the\ndoor, and crossing two or three rooms at last disappeared. But we have\nforgotten to mention one circumstance, which nevertheless ought not\nto be omitted; in one of the rooms he crossed, the trousseau of the\nbride-elect was on exhibition. There were caskets of diamonds, cashmere\nshawls, Valenciennes lace, English veilings, and in fact all the\ntempting things, the bare mention of which makes the hearts of young\ngirls bound with joy, and which is called the \"corbeille.\" [*] Now, in\npassing through this room, Andrea proved himself not only to be clever\nand intelligent, but also provident, for he helped himself to the most\nvaluable of the ornaments before him.\n\n     * Literally, \"the basket,\" because wedding gifts were\n     originally brought in such a receptacle.\n\nFurnished with this plunder, Andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the\nwindow, intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes. Tall and\nwell proportioned as an ancient gladiator, and muscular as a Spartan,\nhe walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his\nsteps, actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if\nhe lingered he knew that he would surely be taken. Having passed through\nthe Rue Mont Blanc, guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to\ntake the safest path, he found himself at the end of the Rue Lafayette.\nThere he stopped, breathless and panting. He was quite alone; on one\nside was the vast wilderness of the Saint-Lazare, on the other, Paris\nenshrouded in darkness. \"Am I to be captured?\" he cried; \"no, not if I\ncan use more activity than my enemies. My safety is now a mere question\nof speed.\" At this moment he saw a cab at the top of the Faubourg\nPoissonniere. The dull driver, smoking his pipe, was plodding along\ntoward the limits of the Faubourg Saint-Denis, where no doubt he\nordinarily had his station. \"Ho, friend!\" said Benedetto.\n\n\"What do you want, sir?\" asked the driver.\n\n\"Is your horse tired?\"\n\n\"Tired? oh, yes, tired enough--he has done nothing the whole of this\nblessed day! Four wretched fares, and twenty sous over, making in all\nseven francs, are all that I have earned, and I ought to take ten to the\nowner.\"\n\n\"Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have?\"\n\n\"With pleasure, sir; twenty francs are not to be despised. Tell me what\nI am to do for this.\"\n\n\"A very easy thing, if your horse isn't tired.\"\n\n\"I tell you he'll go like the wind,--only tell me which way to drive.\"\n\n\"Towards the Louvres.\"\n\n\"Ah, I know the way--you get good sweetened rum over there.\"\n\n\"Exactly so; I merely wish to overtake one of my friends, with whom I am\ngoing to hunt to-morrow at Chapelle-en-Serval. He should have waited for\nme here with a cabriolet till half-past eleven; it is twelve, and, tired\nof waiting, he must have gone on.\"\n\n\"It is likely.\"\n\n\"Well, will you try and overtake him?\"\n\n\"Nothing I should like better.\"\n\n\"If you do not overtake him before we reach Bourget you shall have\ntwenty francs; if not before Louvres, thirty.\"\n\n\"And if we do overtake him?\"\n\n\"Forty,\" said Andrea, after a moment's hesitation, at the end of which\nhe remembered that he might safely promise. \"That's all right,\" said the\nman; \"hop in, and we're off! Who-o-o-p, la!\"\n\nAndrea got into the cab, which passed rapidly through the Faubourg\nSaint-Denis, along the Faubourg Saint-Martin, crossed the barrier, and\nthreaded its way through the interminable Villette. They never overtook\nthe chimerical friend, yet Andrea frequently inquired of people on foot\nwhom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed, for a green\ncabriolet and bay horse; and as there are a great many cabriolets to be\nseen on the road to the Low Countries, and as nine-tenths of them are\ngreen, the inquiries increased at every step. Every one had just seen\nit pass; it was only five hundred, two hundred, one hundred steps in\nadvance; at length they reached it, but it was not the friend. Once\nthe cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two\npost-horses. \"Ah,\" said Cavalcanti to himself, \"if I only had that\nbritzska, those two good post-horses, and above all the passport\nthat carries them on!\" And he sighed deeply. The calash contained\nMademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle d'Armilly. \"Hurry, hurry!\" said\nAndrea, \"we must overtake him soon.\" And the poor horse resumed the\ndesperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier, and arrived\nsteaming at Louvres.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Andrea, \"I shall not overtake my friend, but I shall\nkill your horse, therefore I had better stop. Here are thirty francs; I\nwill sleep at the Red Horse, and will secure a place in the first coach.\nGood-night, friend.\" And Andrea, after placing six pieces of five francs\neach in the man's hand, leaped lightly on to the pathway. The cabman\njoyfully pocketed the sum, and turned back on his road to Paris. Andrea\npretended to go towards the Red Horse inn, but after leaning an instant\nagainst the door, and hearing the last sound of the cab, which was\ndisappearing from view, he went on his road, and with a lusty stride\nsoon traversed the space of two leagues. Then he rested; he must be near\nChapelle-en-Serval, where he pretended to be going. It was not fatigue\nthat stayed Andrea here; it was that he might form some resolution,\nadopt some plan. It would be impossible to make use of a diligence,\nequally so to engage post-horses; to travel either way a passport was\nnecessary. It was still more impossible to remain in the department of\nthe Oise, one of the most open and strictly guarded in France; this was\nquite out of the question, especially to a man like Andrea, perfectly\nconversant with criminal matters.\n\nHe sat down by the side of the moat, buried his face in his hands and\nreflected. Ten minutes after he raised his head; his resolution was\nmade. He threw some dust over the topcoat, which he had found time to\nunhook from the ante-chamber and button over his ball costume, and going\nto Chapelle-en-Serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in\nthe place. The host opened. \"My friend,\" said Andrea, \"I was coming from\nMontefontaine to Senlis, when my horse, which is a troublesome creature,\nstumbled and threw me. I must reach Compiegne to-night, or I shall cause\ndeep anxiety to my family. Could you let me hire a horse of you?\"\n\nAn inn-keeper has always a horse to let, whether it be good or bad. The\nhost called the stable-boy, and ordered him to saddle \"Whitey,\" then he\nawoke his son, a child of seven years, whom he ordered to ride before\nthe gentleman and bring back the horse. Andrea gave the inn-keeper\ntwenty francs, and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting\ncard. This belonged to one of his friends at the Cafe de Paris, so that\nthe innkeeper, picking it up after Andrea had left, was convinced that\nhe had let his horse to the Count of Mauleon, 25 Rue Saint-Dominique,\nthat being the name and address on the card. \"Whitey\" was not a fast\nanimal, but he kept up an easy, steady pace; in three hours and a\nhalf Andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from\nCompiegne, and four o'clock struck as he reached the place where the\ncoaches stop. There is an excellent tavern at Compiegne, well remembered\nby those who have ever been there. Andrea, who had often stayed there\nin his rides about Paris, recollected the Bell and Bottle inn; he\nturned around, saw the sign by the light of a reflected lamp, and having\ndismissed the child, giving him all the small coin he had about him, he\nbegan knocking at the door, very reasonably concluding that having now\nthree or four hours before him he had best fortify himself against the\nfatigues of the morrow by a sound sleep and a good supper. A waiter\nopened the door.\n\n\"My friend,\" said Andrea, \"I have been dining at Saint-Jean-au-Bois, and\nexpected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight, but like a fool\nI have lost my way, and have been walking for the last four hours in the\nforest. Show me into one of those pretty little rooms which overlook the\ncourt, and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of Bordeaux.\" The waiter\nhad no suspicions; Andrea spoke with perfect composure, he had a cigar\nin his mouth, and his hands in the pocket of his top coat; his clothes\nwere fashionably made, his chin smooth, his boots irreproachable; he\nlooked merely as if he had stayed out very late, that was all. While\nthe waiter was preparing his room, the hostess arose; Andrea assumed\nhis most charming smile, and asked if he could have No. 3, which he had\noccupied on his last stay at Compiegne. Unfortunately, No. 3 was engaged\nby a young man who was travelling with his sister. Andrea appeared in\ndespair, but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that No. 7,\nprepared for him, was situated precisely the same as No. 3, and while\nwarming his feet and chatting about the last races at Chantilly, he\nwaited until they announced his room to be ready.\n\nAndrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon\nthe court of the Bell Tavern, which with its triple galleries like those\nof a theatre, with the jessamine and clematis twining round the light\ncolumns, forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you\ncan imagine. The fowl was tender, the wine old, the fire clear and\nsparkling, and Andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good\nan appetite as though nothing had happened. Then he went to bed and\nalmost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men\nof twenty years of age, even when they are torn with remorse. Now, here\nwe are obliged to own that Andrea ought to have felt remorse, but that\nhe did not. This was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the\nbest chance of his security. Before daybreak he would awake, leave the\ninn after rigorously paying his bill, and reaching the forest, he would,\nunder pretence of making studies in painting, test the hospitality of\nsome peasants, procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet,\ncasting off the lion's skin to assume that of the woodman; then, with\nhis hands covered with dirt, his hair darkened by means of a leaden\ncomb, his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which one of his\nold comrades had given him the recipe, he intended, by following the\nwooded districts, to reach the nearest frontier, walking by night and\nsleeping in the day in the forests and quarries, and only entering\ninhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to time.\n\nOnce past the frontier, Andrea proposed making money of his diamonds;\nand by uniting the proceeds to ten bank-notes he always carried about\nwith him in case of accident, he would then find himself possessor of\nabout 50,000 livres, which he philosophically considered as no very\ndeplorable condition after all. Moreover, he reckoned much on\nthe interest of the Danglars to hush up the rumor of their own\nmisadventures. These were the reasons which, added to the fatigue,\ncaused Andrea to sleep so soundly. In order that he might awaken early\nhe did not close the shutters, but contented himself with bolting the\ndoor and placing on the table an unclasped and long-pointed knife, whose\ntemper he well knew, and which was never absent from him. About seven in\nthe morning Andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight, which played,\nwarm and brilliant, upon his face. In all well-organized brains, the\npredominating idea--and there always is one--is sure to be the last\nthought before sleeping, and the first upon waking in the morning.\nAndrea had scarcely opened his eyes when his predominating idea\npresented itself, and whispered in his ear that he had slept too long.\nHe jumped out of bed and ran to the window. A gendarme was crossing the\ncourt. A gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the world, even\nto a man void of uneasiness; but for one who has a timid conscience, and\nwith good cause too, the yellow, blue, and white uniform is really very\nalarming.\n\n\"Why is that gendarme there?\" asked Andrea of himself. Then, all at\nonce, he replied, with that logic which the reader has, doubtless,\nremarked in him, \"There is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme at\nan inn; instead of being astonished, let me dress myself.\" And the youth\ndressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed to rob\nhim of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in Paris.\n\"Now then,\" said Andrea, while dressing himself, \"I'll wait till he\nleaves, and then I'll slip away.\" And, saying this, Andrea, who had now\nput on his boots and cravat, stole gently to the window, and a second\ntime lifted up the muslin curtain. Not only was the first gendarme still\nthere, but the young man now perceived a second yellow, blue, and white\nuniform at the foot of the staircase, the only one by which he could\ndescend, while a third, on horseback, holding a musket in his fist, was\nposted as a sentinel at the great street door which alone afforded the\nmeans of egress.\n\nThe appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter, for a crowd\nof curious loungers was extended before him, effectually blocking the\nentrance to the hotel. \"They're after me!\" was Andrea's first thought.\n\"The devil!\" A pallor overspread the young man's forehead, and he looked\naround him with anxiety. His room, like all those on the same floor, had\nbut one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody. \"I am lost!\"\nwas his second thought; and, indeed, for a man in Andrea's situation,\nan arrest meant the assizes, trial, and death,--death without mercy or\ndelay. For a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands,\nand during that brief period he became nearly mad with terror; but soon\na ray of hope glimmered in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered\nhis mind, and a faint smile played upon his white lips and pallid\ncheeks. He looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the\nchimney-piece; they were a pen, ink, and paper. With forced composure he\ndipped the pen in the ink, and wrote the following lines upon a sheet of\npaper:--\n\n\"I have no money to pay my bill, but I am not a dishonest man; I leave\nbehind me as a pledge this pin, worth ten times the amount. I shall be\nexcused for leaving at daybreak, for I was ashamed.\"\n\nHe then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper. This\ndone, instead of leaving the door fastened, he drew back the bolts and\neven placed the door ajar, as though he had left the room, forgetting\nto close it, and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that\nkind of gymnastic exercise, having effaced the marks of his feet upon\nthe floor, he commenced climbing the only opening which afforded him\nthe means of escape. At this precise time, the first gendarme Andrea\nhad noticed walked up-stairs, preceded by the commissary of police,\nand supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was\nhimself re-enforced by the one stationed at the door.\n\nAndrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances. At\ndaybreak, the telegraphs were set at work in all directions, and almost\nimmediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost\nendeavors to arrest the murderer of Caderousse. Compiegne, that royal\nresidence and fortified town, is well furnished with authorities,\ngendarmes, and commissaries of police; they therefore began operations\nas soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived, and the Bell and Bottle\nbeing the best-known hotel in the town, they had naturally directed\ntheir first inquiries there.\n\nNow, besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the Hotel de Ville,\nwhich is next door to the Bell and Bottle, it had been stated by others\nthat a number of travellers had arrived during the night. The sentinel\nwho was relieved at six o'clock in the morning, remembered perfectly\nthat just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four a young\nman arrived on horseback, with a little boy before him. The young man,\nhaving dismissed the boy and horse, knocked at the door of the hotel,\nwhich was opened, and again closed after his entrance. This late arrival\nhad attracted much suspicion, and the young man being no other than\nAndrea, the commissary and gendarme, who was a brigadier, directed their\nsteps towards his room.\n\nThey found the door ajar. \"Oh, ho,\" said the brigadier, who thoroughly\nunderstood the trick; \"a bad sign to find the door open! I would rather\nfind it triply bolted.\" And, indeed, the little note and pin upon the\ntable confirmed, or rather corroborated, the sad truth. Andrea had fled.\nWe say corroborated, because the brigadier was too experienced to be\nconvinced by a single proof. He glanced around, looked in the bed, shook\nthe curtains, opened the closets, and finally stopped at the chimney.\nAndrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in the\nashes, but still it was an outlet, and in this light was not to be\npassed over without serious investigation.\n\nThe brigadier sent for some sticks and straw, and having filled the\nchimney with them, set a light to it. The fire crackled, and the smoke\nascended like the dull vapor from a volcano; but still no prisoner fell\ndown, as they expected. The fact was, that Andrea, at war with society\never since his youth, was quite as deep as a gendarme, even though he\nwere advanced to the rank of brigadier, and quite prepared for the\nfire, he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against\nthe chimney-pots. At one time he thought he was saved, for he heard\nthe brigadier exclaim in a loud voice, to the two gendarmes, \"He is not\nhere!\" But venturing to peep, he perceived that the latter, instead of\nretiring, as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement,\nwere watching with increased attention.\n\nIt was now his turn to look about him; the Hotel de Ville, a massive\nsixteenth century building, was on his right; any one could descend from\nthe openings in the tower, and examine every corner of the roof below,\nand Andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at\none of these openings. If once discovered, he knew he would be lost, for\nthe roof afforded no chance of escape; he therefore resolved to descend,\nnot through the same chimney by which he had come up, but by a similar\none conducting to another room. He looked around for a chimney from\nwhich no smoke issued, and having reached it, he disappeared through the\norifice without being seen by any one. At the same minute, one of the\nlittle windows of the Hotel de Ville was thrown open, and the head of a\ngendarme appeared. For an instant it remained motionless as one of\nthe stone decorations of the building, then after a long sigh of\ndisappointment the head disappeared. The brigadier, calm and dignified\nas the law he represented, passed through the crowd, without answering\nthe thousand questions addressed to him, and re-entered the hotel.\n\n\"Well?\" asked the two gendarmes.\n\n\"Well, my boys,\" said the brigadier, \"the brigand must really have\nescaped early this morning; but we will send to the Villers-Coterets and\nNoyon roads, and search the forest, when we shall catch him, no doubt.\"\nThe honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus, in that\nintonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie, when a\nloud scream, accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell, resounded\nthrough the court of the hotel. \"Ah, what is that?\" cried the brigadier.\n\n\"Some traveller seems impatient,\" said the host. \"What number was it\nthat rang?\"\n\n\"Number 3.\"\n\n\"Run, waiter!\" At this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled.\n\"Ah,\" said the brigadier, stopping the servant, \"the person who is\nringing appears to want something more than a waiter; we will attend\nupon him with a gendarme. Who occupies Number 3?\"\n\n\"The little fellow who arrived last night in a post-chaise with his\nsister, and who asked for an apartment with two beds.\" The bell here\nrang for the third time, with another shriek of anguish.\n\n\"Follow me, Mr. Commissary!\" said the brigadier; \"tread in my steps.\"\n\n\"Wait an instant,\" said the host; \"Number 3 has two staircases,--inside\nand outside.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said the brigadier. \"I will take charge of the inside one. Are\nthe carbines loaded?\"\n\n\"Yes, brigadier.\"\n\n\"Well, you guard the exterior, and if he attempts to fly, fire upon him;\nhe must be a great criminal, from what the telegraph says.\"\n\nThe brigadier, followed by the commissary, disappeared by the inside\nstaircase, accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting\nAndrea had excited in the crowd. This is what had happened. Andrea had\nvery cleverly managed to descend two-thirds of the chimney, but then his\nfoot slipped, and notwithstanding his endeavors, he came into the room\nwith more speed and noise than he intended. It would have signified\nlittle had the room been empty, but unfortunately it was occupied. Two\nladies, sleeping in one bed, were awakened by the noise, and fixing\ntheir eyes upon the spot whence the sound proceeded, they saw a man.\nOne of these ladies, the fair one, uttered those terrible shrieks which\nresounded through the house, while the other, rushing to the bell-rope,\nrang with all her strength. Andrea, as we can see, was surrounded by\nmisfortune.\n\n\"For pity's sake,\" he cried, pale and bewildered, without seeing whom\nhe was addressing,--\"for pity's sake do not call assistance! Save me!--I\nwill not harm you.\"\n\n\"Andrea, the murderer!\" cried one of the ladies.\n\n\"Eugenie! Mademoiselle Danglars!\" exclaimed Andrea, stupefied.\n\n\"Help, help!\" cried Mademoiselle d'Armilly, taking the bell from her\ncompanion's hand, and ringing it yet more violently. \"Save me, I am\npursued!\" said Andrea, clasping his hands. \"For pity, for mercy's sake\ndo not deliver me up!\"\n\n\"It is too late, they are coming,\" said Eugenie.\n\n\"Well, conceal me somewhere; you can say you were needlessly alarmed;\nyou can turn their suspicions and save my life!\"\n\nThe two ladies, pressing closely to one another, and drawing the\nbedclothes tightly around them, remained silent to this supplicating\nvoice, repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds.\n\n\"Well, be it so,\" at length said Eugenie; \"return by the same road you\ncame, and we will say nothing about you, unhappy wretch.\"\n\n\"Here he is, here he is!\" cried a voice from the landing; \"here he is!\nI see him!\" The brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole, and had\ndiscovered Andrea in a posture of entreaty. A violent blow from the butt\nend of the musket burst open the lock, two more forced out the bolts,\nand the broken door fell in. Andrea ran to the other door, leading to\nthe gallery, ready to rush out; but he was stopped short, and he stood\nwith his body a little thrown back, pale, and with the useless knife in\nhis clinched hand.\n\n\"Fly, then!\" cried Mademoiselle d'Armilly, whose pity returned as her\nfears diminished; \"fly!\"\n\n\"Or kill yourself!\" said Eugenie (in a tone which a Vestal in the\namphitheatre would have used, when urging the victorious gladiator to\nfinish his vanquished adversary). Andrea shuddered, and looked on the\nyoung girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such\nferocious honor. \"Kill myself?\" he cried, throwing down his knife; \"why\nshould I do so?\"\n\n\"Why, you said,\" answered Mademoiselle Danglars, \"that you would be\ncondemned to die like the worst criminals.\"\n\n\"Bah,\" said Cavalcanti, crossing his arms, \"one has friends.\"\n\nThe brigadier advanced to him, sword in hand. \"Come, come,\" said Andrea,\n\"sheathe your sword, my fine fellow; there is no occasion to make such a\nfuss, since I give myself up;\" and he held out his hands to be manacled.\nThe girls looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis, the man\nof the world shaking off his covering and appearing as a galley-slave.\nAndrea turned towards them, and with an impertinent smile asked,--\"Have\nyou any message for your father, Mademoiselle Danglars, for in all\nprobability I shall return to Paris?\"\n\nEugenie covered her face with her hands. \"Oh, ho!\" said Andrea, \"you\nneed not be ashamed, even though you did post after me. Was I not nearly\nyour husband?\"\n\nAnd with this raillery Andrea went out, leaving the two girls a prey to\ntheir own feelings of shame, and to the comments of the crowd. An hour\nafter they stepped into their calash, both dressed in feminine attire.\nThe gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight, but\nthey were forced, when the door was open, to pass through a throng of\ncurious glances and whispering voices. Eugenie closed her eyes; but\nthough she could not see, she could hear, and the sneers of the crowd\nreached her in the carriage. \"Oh, why is not the world a wilderness?\"\nshe exclaimed, throwing herself into the arms of Mademoiselle d'Armilly,\nher eyes sparkling with the same kind of rage which made Nero wish that\nthe Roman world had but one neck, that he might sever it at a single\nblow. The next day they stopped at the Hotel de Flandre, at Brussels.\nThe same evening Andrea was incarcerated in the Conciergerie.\n\n\n\nChapter 99. The Law.\n\nWe have seen how quietly Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle\nd'Armilly accomplished their transformation and flight; the fact being\nthat every one was too much occupied in his or her own affairs to think\nof theirs. We will leave the banker contemplating the enormous magnitude\nof his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy, and follow the baroness,\nwho after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which\nhad struck her, had gone to seek her usual adviser, Lucien Debray. The\nbaroness had looked forward to this marriage as a means of ridding her\nof a guardianship which, over a girl of Eugenie's character, could not\nfail to be rather a troublesome undertaking; for in the tacit relations\nwhich maintain the bond of family union, the mother, to maintain her\nascendancy over her daughter, must never fail to be a model of wisdom\nand a type of perfection.\n\nNow, Madame Danglars feared Eugenie's sagacity and the influence of\nMademoiselle d'Armilly; she had frequently observed the contemptuous\nexpression with which her daughter looked upon Debray,--an expression\nwhich seemed to imply that she understood all her mother's amorous and\npecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary; moreover, she\nsaw that Eugenie detested Debray,--not only because he was a source of\ndissension and scandal under the paternal roof, but because she had at\nonce classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom Plato endeavors to\nwithdraw from the appellation of men, and whom Diogenes designated as\nanimals upon two legs without feathers.\n\nUnfortunately, in this world of ours, each person views things through\na certain medium, and so is prevented from seeing in the same light as\nothers, and Madame Danglars, therefore, very much regretted that the\nmarriage of Eugenie had not taken place, not only because the match was\ngood, and likely to insure the happiness of her child, but because it\nwould also set her at liberty. She ran therefore to Debray, who, after\nhaving like the rest of Paris witnessed the contract scene and the\nscandal attending it, had retired in haste to his club, where he was\nchatting with some friends upon the events which served as a subject of\nconversation for three-fourths of that city known as the capital of the\nworld.\n\nAt the precise time when Madame Danglars, dressed in black and\nconcealed in a long veil, was ascending the stairs leading to Debray's\napartments,--notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that\nthe young man was not at home,--Debray was occupied in repelling the\ninsinuations of a friend, who tried to persuade him that after the\nterrible scene which had just taken place he ought, as a friend of the\nfamily, to marry Mademoiselle Danglars and her two millions. Debray did\nnot defend himself very warmly, for the idea had sometimes crossed\nhis mind; still, when he recollected the independent, proud spirit of\nEugenie, he positively rejected it as utterly impossible, though the\nsame thought again continually recurred and found a resting-place in\nhis heart. Tea, play, and the conversation, which had become interesting\nduring the discussion of such serious affairs, lasted till one o'clock\nin the morning.\n\nMeanwhile Madame Danglars, veiled and uneasy, awaited the return of\nDebray in the little green room, seated between two baskets of flowers,\nwhich she had that morning sent, and which, it must be confessed, Debray\nhad himself arranged and watered with so much care that his absence was\nhalf excused in the eyes of the poor woman.\n\nAt twenty minutes of twelve, Madame Danglars, tired of waiting, returned\nhome. Women of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in one\nrespect, they seldom return home after twelve o'clock. The baroness\nreturned to the hotel with as much caution as Eugenie used in leaving\nit; she ran lightly up-stairs, and with an aching heart entered her\napartment, contiguous, as we know, to that of Eugenie. She was fearful\nof exciting any remark, and believed firmly in her daughter's innocence\nand fidelity to the paternal roof. She listened at Eugenie's door, and\nhearing no sound tried to enter, but the bolts were in place. Madame\nDanglars then concluded that the young girl had been overcome with the\nterrible excitement of the evening, and had gone to bed and to sleep.\nShe called the maid and questioned her.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Eugenie,\" said the maid, \"retired to her apartment with\nMademoiselle d'Armilly; they then took tea together, after which they\ndesired me to leave, saying that they needed me no longer.\" Since then\nthe maid had been below, and like every one else she thought the young\nladies were in their own room; Madame Danglars, therefore, went to bed\nwithout a shadow of suspicion, and began to muse over the recent events.\nIn proportion as her memory became clearer, the occurrences of the\nevening were revealed in their true light; what she had taken for\nconfusion was a tumult; what she had regarded as something distressing,\nwas in reality a disgrace. And then the baroness remembered that she had\nfelt no pity for poor Mercedes, who had been afflicted with as severe a\nblow through her husband and son.\n\n\"Eugenie,\" she said to herself, \"is lost, and so are we. The affair, as\nit will be reported, will cover us with shame; for in a society such as\nours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound. How fortunate that\nEugenie is possessed of that strange character which has so often\nmade me tremble!\" And her glance was turned towards heaven, where a\nmysterious providence disposes all things, and out of a fault, nay, even\na vice, sometimes produces a blessing. And then her thoughts, cleaving\nthrough space like a bird in the air, rested on Cavalcanti. This Andrea\nwas a wretch, a robber, an assassin, and yet his manners showed the\neffects of a sort of education, if not a complete one; he had been\npresented to the world with the appearance of an immense fortune,\nsupported by an honorable name. How could she extricate herself from\nthis labyrinth? To whom would she apply to help her out of this painful\nsituation? Debray, to whom she had run, with the first instinct of a\nwoman towards the man she loves, and who yet betrays her,--Debray could\nbut give her advice, she must apply to some one more powerful than he.\n\nThe baroness then thought of M. de Villefort. It was M. de Villefort who\nhad remorselessly brought misfortune into her family, as though they\nhad been strangers. But, no; on reflection, the procureur was not a\nmerciless man; and it was not the magistrate, slave to his duties, but\nthe friend, the loyal friend, who roughly but firmly cut into the very\ncore of the corruption; it was not the executioner, but the surgeon, who\nwished to withdraw the honor of Danglars from ignominious association\nwith the disgraced young man they had presented to the world as their\nson-in-law. And since Villefort, the friend of Danglars, had acted in\nthis way, no one could suppose that he had been previously acquainted\nwith, or had lent himself to, any of Andrea's intrigues. Villefort's\nconduct, therefore, upon reflection, appeared to the baroness as\nif shaped for their mutual advantage. But the inflexibility of the\nprocureur should stop there; she would see him the next day, and if she\ncould not make him fail in his duties as a magistrate, she would, at\nleast, obtain all the indulgence he could allow. She would invoke\nthe past, recall old recollections; she would supplicate him by the\nremembrance of guilty, yet happy days. M. de Villefort would stifle the\naffair; he had only to turn his eyes on one side, and allow Andrea to\nfly, and follow up the crime under that shadow of guilt called contempt\nof court. And after this reasoning she slept easily.\n\nAt nine o'clock next morning she arose, and without ringing for her maid\nor giving the least sign of her activity, she dressed herself in the\nsame simple style as on the previous night; then running down-stairs,\nshe left the hotel, walked to the Rue de Provence, called a cab, and\ndrove to M. de Villefort's house. For the last month this wretched house\nhad presented the gloomy appearance of a lazaretto infected with the\nplague. Some of the apartments were closed within and without; the\nshutters were only opened to admit a minute's air, showing the scared\nface of a footman, and immediately afterwards the window would be\nclosed, like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre, and the neighbors\nwould say to each other in a low voice, \"Will there be another funeral\nto-day at the procureur's house?\" Madame Danglars involuntarily\nshuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion; descending from the\ncab, she approached the door with trembling knees, and rang the bell.\nThree times did the bell ring with a dull, heavy sound, seeming to\nparticipate, in the general sadness, before the concierge appeared and\npeeped through the door, which he opened just wide enough to allow his\nwords to be heard. He saw a lady, a fashionable, elegantly dressed lady,\nand yet the door remained almost closed.\n\n\"Do you intend opening the door?\" said the baroness.\n\n\"First, madame, who are you?\"\n\n\"Who am I? You know me well enough.\"\n\n\"We no longer know any one, madame.\"\n\n\"You must be mad, my friend,\" said the baroness.\n\n\"Where do you come from?\"\n\n\"Oh, this is too much!\"\n\n\"Madame, these are my orders; excuse me. Your name?\"\n\n\"The baroness Danglars; you have seen me twenty times.\"\n\n\"Possibly, madame. And now, what do you want?\"\n\n\"Oh, how extraordinary! I shall complain to M. de Villefort of the\nimpertinence of his servants.\"\n\n\"Madame, this is precaution, not impertinence; no one enters here\nwithout an order from M. d'Avrigny, or without speaking to the\nprocureur.\"\n\n\"Well, I have business with the procureur.\"\n\n\"Is it pressing business?\"\n\n\"You can imagine so, since I have not even brought my carriage out yet.\nBut enough of this--here is my card, take it to your master.\"\n\n\"Madame will await my return?\"\n\n\"Yes; go.\" The concierge closed the door, leaving Madame Danglars in\nthe street. She had not long to wait; directly afterwards the door was\nopened wide enough to admit her, and when she had passed through, it was\nagain shut. Without losing sight of her for an instant, the concierge\ntook a whistle from his pocket as soon as they entered the court, and\nblew it. The valet de chambre appeared on the door-steps. \"You will\nexcuse this poor fellow, madame,\" he said, as he preceded the baroness,\n\"but his orders are precise, and M. de Villefort begged me to tell you\nthat he could not act otherwise.\"\n\nIn the court showing his merchandise, was a tradesman who had been\nadmitted with the same precautions. The baroness ascended the steps; she\nfelt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify\nher own, and still guided by the valet de chambre, who never lost sight\nof her for an instant, she was introduced to the magistrate's study.\nPreoccupied as Madame Danglars had been with the object of her visit,\nthe treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so\ninsulting, that she began by complaining of it. But Villefort, raising\nhis head, bowed down by grief, looked up at her with so sad a smile that\nher complaints died upon her lips. \"Forgive my servants,\" he said, \"for\na terror I cannot blame them for; from being suspected they have become\nsuspicious.\"\n\nMadame Danglars had often heard of the terror to which the magistrate\nalluded, but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never\nhave believed that the sentiment had been carried so far. \"You too,\nthen, are unhappy?\" she said. \"Yes, madame,\" replied the magistrate.\n\n\"Then you pity me!\"\n\n\"Sincerely, madame.\"\n\n\"And you understand what brings me here?\"\n\n\"You wish to speak to me about the circumstance which has just\nhappened?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,--a fearful misfortune.\"\n\n\"You mean a mischance.\"\n\n\"A mischance?\" repeated the baroness.\n\n\"Alas, madame,\" said the procureur with his imperturbable calmness of\nmanner, \"I consider those alone misfortunes which are irreparable.\"\n\n\"And do you suppose this will be forgotten?\"\n\n\"Everything will be forgotten, madame,\" said Villefort. \"Your daughter\nwill be married to-morrow, if not to-day--in a week, if not to-morrow;\nand I do not think you can regret the intended husband of your\ndaughter.\"\n\nMadame Danglars gazed on Villefort, stupefied to find him so almost\ninsultingly calm. \"Am I come to a friend?\" she asked in a tone full of\nmournful dignity. \"You know that you are, madame,\" said Villefort, whose\npale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance. And\ntruly this assurance carried him back to different events from those now\noccupying the baroness and him. \"Well, then, be more affectionate, my\ndear Villefort,\" said the baroness. \"Speak to me not as a magistrate,\nbut as a friend; and when I am in bitter anguish of spirit, do not tell\nme that I ought to be gay.\" Villefort bowed. \"When I hear misfortunes\nnamed, madame,\" he said, \"I have within the last few months contracted\nthe bad habit of thinking of my own, and then I cannot help drawing up\nan egotistical parallel in my mind. That is the reason that by the side\nof my misfortunes yours appear to me mere mischances; that is why my\ndreadful position makes yours appear enviable. But this annoys you; let\nus change the subject. You were saying, madame\"--\n\n\"I came to ask you, my friend,\" said the baroness, \"what will be done\nwith this impostor?\"\n\n\"Impostor,\" repeated Villefort; \"certainly, madame, you appear to\nextenuate some cases, and exaggerate others. Impostor, indeed!--M.\nAndrea Cavalcanti, or rather M. Benedetto, is nothing more nor less than\nan assassin!\"\n\n\"Sir, I do not deny the justice of your correction, but the more\nseverely you arm yourself against that unfortunate man, the more deeply\nwill you strike our family. Come, forget him for a moment, and instead\nof pursuing him let him go.\"\n\n\"You are too late, madame; the orders are issued.\"\n\n\"Well, should he be arrested--do they think they will arrest him?\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\n\"If they should arrest him (I know that sometimes prisoners afford means\nof escape), will you leave him in prison?\"--The procureur shook his\nhead. \"At least keep him there till my daughter be married.\"\n\n\"Impossible, madame; justice has its formalities.\"\n\n\"What, even for me?\" said the baroness, half jesting, half in earnest.\n\"For all, even for myself among the rest,\" replied Villefort.\n\n\"Ah,\" exclaimed the baroness, without expressing the ideas which the\nexclamation betrayed. Villefort looked at her with that piercing glance\nwhich reads the secrets of the heart. \"Yes, I know what you mean,\" he\nsaid; \"you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the world, that\nthe deaths which have kept me in mourning for the last three months, and\nfrom which Valentine has only escaped by a miracle, have not happened by\nnatural means.\"\n\n\"I was not thinking of that,\" replied Madame Danglars quickly. \"Yes, you\nwere thinking of it, and with justice. You could not help thinking of\nit, and saying to yourself, 'you, who pursue crime so vindictively,\nanswer now, why are there unpunished crimes in your dwelling?'\" The\nbaroness became pale. \"You were saying this, were you not?\"\n\n\"Well, I own it.\"\n\n\"I will answer you.\"\n\nVillefort drew his armchair nearer to Madame Danglars; then resting both\nhands upon his desk he said in a voice more hollow than usual: \"There\nare crimes which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown,\nand we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty; but when the\nculprits are discovered\" (Villefort here extended his hand toward a\nlarge crucifix placed opposite to his desk)--\"when they are discovered,\nI swear to you, by all I hold most sacred, that whoever they may be they\nshall die. Now, after the oath I have just taken, and which I will keep,\nmadame, dare you ask for mercy for that wretch!\"\n\n\"But, sir, are you sure he is as guilty as they say?\"\n\n\"Listen; this is his description: 'Benedetto, condemned, at the age of\nsixteen, for five years to the galleys for forgery.' He promised well,\nas you see--first a runaway, then an assassin.\"\n\n\"And who is this wretch?\"\n\n\"Who can tell?--a vagabond, a Corsican.\"\n\n\"Has no one owned him?\"\n\n\"No one; his parents are unknown.\"\n\n\"But who was the man who brought him from Lucca?\"\n\n\"Another rascal like himself, perhaps his accomplice.\" The baroness\nclasped her hands. \"Villefort,\" she exclaimed in her softest and most\ncaptivating manner.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, madame,\" said Villefort, with a firmness of\nexpression not altogether free from harshness--\"for heaven's sake, do\nnot ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch! What am I?--the law. Has the\nlaw any eyes to witness your grief? Has the law ears to be melted by\nyour sweet voice? Has the law a memory for all those soft recollections\nyou endeavor to recall? No, madame; the law has commanded, and when it\ncommands it strikes. You will tell me that I am a living being, and not\na code--a man, and not a volume. Look at me, madame--look around me.\nHave mankind treated me as a brother? Have they loved me? Have they\nspared me? Has any one shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my\nhands? No, madame, they struck me, always struck me!\n\n\"Woman, siren that you are, do you persist in fixing on me that\nfascinating eye, which reminds me that I ought to blush? Well, be it so;\nlet me blush for the faults you know, and perhaps--perhaps for even\nmore than those! But having sinned myself,--it may be more deeply\nthan others,--I never rest till I have torn the disguises from my\nfellow-creatures, and found out their weaknesses. I have always found\nthem; and more,--I repeat it with joy, with triumph,--I have always\nfound some proof of human perversity or error. Every criminal I condemn\nseems to me living evidence that I am not a hideous exception to the\nrest. Alas, alas, alas; all the world is wicked; let us therefore strike\nat wickedness!\"\n\nVillefort pronounced these last words with a feverish rage, which gave a\nferocious eloquence to his words.\n\n\"But\"' said Madame Danglars, resolving to make a last effort, \"this\nyoung man, though a murderer, is an orphan, abandoned by everybody.\"\n\n\"So much the worse, or rather, so much the better; it has been so\nordained that he may have none to weep his fate.\"\n\n\"But this is trampling on the weak, sir.\"\n\n\"The weakness of a murderer!\"\n\n\"His dishonor reflects upon us.\"\n\n\"Is not death in my house?\"\n\n\"Oh, sir,\" exclaimed the baroness, \"you are without pity for others,\nwell, then, I tell you they will have no mercy on you!\"\n\n\"Be it so!\" said Villefort, raising his arms to heaven.\n\n\"At least, delay the trial till the next assizes; we shall then have six\nmonths before us.\"\n\n\"No, madame,\" said Villefort; \"instructions have been given. There are\nyet five days left; five days are more than I require. Do you not think\nthat I also long for forgetfulness? While working night and day, I\nsometimes lose all recollection of the past, and then I experience the\nsame sort of happiness I can imagine the dead feel; still, it is better\nthan suffering.\"\n\n\"But, sir, he has fled; let him escape--inaction is a pardonable\noffence.\"\n\n\"I tell you it is too late; early this morning the telegraph was\nemployed, and at this very minute\"--\n\n\"Sir,\" said the valet de chambre, entering the room, \"a dragoon has\nbrought this despatch from the minister of the interior.\" Villefort\nseized the letter, and hastily broke the seal. Madame Danglars trembled\nwith fear; Villefort started with joy. \"Arrested!\" he exclaimed; \"he\nwas taken at Compiegne, and all is over.\" Madame Danglars rose from her\nseat, pale and cold. \"Adieu, sir,\" she said. \"Adieu, madame,\" replied\nthe king's attorney, as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to\nthe door. Then, turning to his desk, he said, striking the letter with\nthe back of his right hand, \"Come, I had a forgery, three robberies, and\ntwo cases of arson, I only wanted a murder, and here it is. It will be a\nsplendid session!\"\n\n\n\nChapter 100. The Apparition.\n\nAs the procureur had told Madame Danglars, Valentine was not yet\nrecovered. Bowed down with fatigue, she was indeed confined to her bed;\nand it was in her own room, and from the lips of Madame de Villefort,\nthat she heard all the strange events we have related,--we mean the\nflight of Eugenie and the arrest of Andrea Cavalcanti, or rather\nBenedetto, together with the accusation of murder pronounced against\nhim. But Valentine was so weak that this recital scarcely produced\nthe same effect it would have done had she been in her usual state of\nhealth. Indeed, her brain was only the seat of vague ideas, and confused\nforms, mingled with strange fancies, alone presented themselves before\nher eyes.\n\nDuring the daytime Valentine's perceptions remained tolerably clear,\nowing to the constant presence of M. Noirtier, who caused himself to be\ncarried to his granddaughter's room, and watched her with his paternal\ntenderness; Villefort also, on his return from the law courts,\nfrequently passed an hour or two with his father and child. At six\no'clock Villefort retired to his study, at eight M. d'Avrigny himself\narrived, bringing the night draught prepared for the young girl, and\nthen M. Noirtier was carried away. A nurse of the doctor's choice\nsucceeded them, and never left till about ten or eleven o'clock, when\nValentine was asleep. As she went down-stairs she gave the keys of\nValentine's room to M. de Villefort, so that no one could reach the\nsick-room excepting through that of Madame de Villefort and little\nEdward.\n\nEvery morning Morrel called on Noirtier to receive news of Valentine,\nand, extraordinary as it seemed, each day found him less uneasy.\nCertainly, though Valentine still labored under dreadful nervous\nexcitement, she was better; and moreover, Monte Cristo had told him\nwhen, half distracted, he had rushed to the count's house, that if\nshe were not dead in two hours she would be saved. Now four days had\nelapsed, and Valentine still lived.\n\nThe nervous excitement of which we speak pursued Valentine even in her\nsleep, or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking\nhours; it was then, in the silence of night, in the dim light shed from\nthe alabaster lamp on the chimney-piece, that she saw the shadows pass\nand repass which hover over the bed of sickness, and fan the fever\nwith their trembling wings. First she fancied she saw her stepmother\nthreatening her, then Morrel stretched his arms towards her; sometimes\nmere strangers, like the Count of Monte Cristo came to visit her; even\nthe very furniture, in these moments of delirium, seemed to move, and\nthis state lasted till about three o'clock in the morning, when a deep,\nheavy slumber overcame the young girl, from which she did not awake till\ndaylight. On the evening of the day on which Valentine had learned of\nthe flight of Eugenie and the arrest of Benedetto,--Villefort having\nretired as well as Noirtier and d'Avrigny,--her thoughts wandered in a\nconfused maze, alternately reviewing her own situation and the events\nshe had just heard.\n\nEleven o'clock had struck. The nurse, having placed the beverage\nprepared by the doctor within reach of the patient, and locked the\ndoor, was listening with terror to the comments of the servants in the\nkitchen, and storing her memory with all the horrible stories which had\nfor some months past amused the occupants of the ante-chambers in the\nhouse of the king's attorney. Meanwhile an unexpected scene was passing\nin the room which had been so carefully locked. Ten minutes had elapsed\nsince the nurse had left; Valentine, who for the last hour had\nbeen suffering from the fever which returned nightly, incapable of\ncontrolling her ideas, was forced to yield to the excitement which\nexhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and\nrecurrence of the same fancies and images. The night-lamp threw out\ncountless rays, each resolving itself into some strange form to her\ndisordered imagination, when suddenly by its flickering light Valentine\nthought she saw the door of her library, which was in the recess by the\nchimney-piece, open slowly, though she in vain listened for the sound of\nthe hinges on which it turned.\n\nAt any other time Valentine would have seized the silken bell-pull\nand summoned assistance, but nothing astonished her in her present\nsituation. Her reason told her that all the visions she beheld were but\nthe children of her imagination, and the conviction was strengthened\nby the fact that in the morning no traces remained of the nocturnal\nphantoms, who disappeared with the coming of daylight. From behind the\ndoor a human figure appeared, but the girl was too familiar with\nsuch apparitions to be alarmed, and therefore only stared, hoping to\nrecognize Morrel. The figure advanced towards the bed and appeared to\nlisten with profound attention. At this moment a ray of light glanced\nacross the face of the midnight visitor.\n\n\"It is not he,\" she murmured, and waited, in the assurance that this was\nbut a dream, for the man to disappear or assume some other form. Still,\nshe felt her pulse, and finding it throb violently she remembered that\nthe best method of dispelling such illusions was to drink, for a draught\nof the beverage prepared by the doctor to allay her fever seemed to\ncause a reaction of the brain, and for a short time she suffered less.\nValentine therefore reached her hand towards the glass, but as soon\nas her trembling arm left the bed the apparition advanced more quickly\ntowards her, and approached the young girl so closely that she fancied\nshe heard his breath, and felt the pressure of his hand.\n\nThis time the illusion, or rather the reality, surpassed anything\nValentine had before experienced; she began to believe herself really\nalive and awake, and the belief that her reason was this time not\ndeceived made her shudder. The pressure she felt was evidently intended\nto arrest her arm, and she slowly withdrew it. Then the figure, from\nwhom she could not detach her eyes, and who appeared more protecting\nthan menacing, took the glass, and walking towards the night-light held\nit up, as if to test its transparency. This did not seem sufficient;\nthe man, or rather the ghost--for he trod so softly that no sound was\nheard--then poured out about a spoonful into the glass, and drank it.\nValentine witnessed this scene with a sentiment of stupefaction. Every\nminute she had expected that it would vanish and give place to another\nvision; but the man, instead of dissolving like a shadow, again\napproached her, and said in an agitated voice, \"Now you may drink.\"\n\nValentine shuddered. It was the first time one of these visions had\never addressed her in a living voice, and she was about to utter an\nexclamation. The man placed his finger on her lips. \"The Count of Monte\nCristo!\" she murmured.\n\nIt was easy to see that no doubt now remained in the young girl's mind\nas to the reality of the scene; her eyes started with terror, her hands\ntrembled, and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her. Still, the\npresence of Monte Cristo at such an hour, his mysterious, fanciful, and\nextraordinary entrance into her room through the wall, might well seem\nimpossibilities to her shattered reason. \"Do not call any one--do not be\nalarmed,\" said the Count; \"do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness\nremain in your breast; the man standing before you, Valentine (for this\ntime it is no ghost), is nothing more than the tenderest father and the\nmost respectful friend you could dream of.\"\n\nValentine could not reply; the voice which indicated the real presence\nof a being in the room, alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a\nsyllable; still the expression of her eyes seemed to inquire, \"If your\nintentions are pure, why are you here?\" The count's marvellous sagacity\nunderstood all that was passing in the young girl's mind.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" he said, \"or, rather, look upon me; look at my face,\npaler even than usual, and my eyes, red with weariness--for four days\nI have not closed them, for I have been constantly watching you, to\nprotect and preserve you for Maximilian.\" The blood mounted rapidly\nto the cheeks of Valentine, for the name just announced by the count\ndispelled all the fear with which his presence had inspired her.\n\"Maximilian!\" she exclaimed, and so sweet did the sound appear to her,\nthat she repeated it--\"Maximilian!--has he then owned all to you?\"\n\n\"Everything. He told me your life was his, and I have promised him that\nyou shall live.\"\n\n\"You have promised him that I shall live?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But, sir, you spoke of vigilance and protection. Are you a doctor?\"\n\n\"Yes; the best you could have at the present time, believe me.\"\n\n\"But you say you have watched?\" said Valentine uneasily; \"where have\nyou been?--I have not seen you.\" The count extended his hand towards the\nlibrary. \"I was hidden behind that door,\" he said, \"which leads into the\nnext house, which I have rented.\" Valentine turned her eyes away, and,\nwith an indignant expression of pride and modest fear, exclaimed: \"Sir,\nI think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion, and that what\nyou call protection is more like an insult.\"\n\n\"Valentine,\" he answered, \"during my long watch over you, all I\nhave observed has been what people visited you, what nourishment was\nprepared, and what beverage was served; then, when the latter appeared\ndangerous to me, I entered, as I have now done, and substituted, in the\nplace of the poison, a healthful draught; which, instead of producing\nthe death intended, caused life to circulate in your veins.\"\n\n\"Poison--death!\" exclaimed Valentine, half believing herself under the\ninfluence of some feverish hallucination; \"what are you saying, sir?\"\n\n\"Hush, my child,\" said Monte Cristo, again placing his finger upon her\nlips, \"I did say poison and death. But drink some of this;\" and the\ncount took a bottle from his pocket, containing a red liquid, of which\nhe poured a few drops into the glass. \"Drink this, and then take nothing\nmore to-night.\" Valentine stretched out her hand, but scarcely had she\ntouched the glass when she drew back in fear. Monte Cristo took the\nglass, drank half its contents, and then presented it to Valentine, who\nsmiled and swallowed the rest. \"Oh, yes,\" she exclaimed, \"I recognize\nthe flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much, and\nseemed to ease my aching brain. Thank you, sir, thank you!\"\n\n\"This is how you have lived during the last four nights, Valentine,\"\nsaid the count. \"But, oh, how I passed that time! Oh, the wretched hours\nI have endured--the torture to which I have submitted when I saw the\ndeadly poison poured into your glass, and how I trembled lest you should\ndrink it before I could find time to throw it away!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Valentine, at the height of her terror, \"you say you endured\ntortures when you saw the deadly poison poured into my glass; but if you\nsaw this, you must also have seen the person who poured it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Valentine raised herself in bed, and drew over her chest, which\nappeared whiter than snow, the embroidered cambric, still moist with the\ncold dews of delirium, to which were now added those of terror. \"You saw\nthe person?\" repeated the young girl. \"Yes,\" repeated the count.\n\n\"What you tell me is horrible, sir. You wish to make me believe\nsomething too dreadful. What?--attempt to murder me in my father's\nhouse, in my room, on my bed of sickness? Oh, leave me, sir; you\nare tempting me--you make me doubt the goodness of providence--it is\nimpossible, it cannot be!\"\n\n\"Are you the first that this hand has stricken? Have you not seen\nM. de Saint-Meran, Madame de Saint-Meran, Barrois, all fall? Would not\nM. Noirtier also have fallen a victim, had not the treatment he has\nbeen pursuing for the last three years neutralized the effects of the\npoison?\"\n\n\"Oh, heaven,\" said Valentine; \"is this the reason why grandpapa has made\nme share all his beverages during the last month?\"\n\n\"And have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor, like that of\ndried orange-peel?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes!\"\n\n\"Then that explains all,\" said Monte Cristo. \"Your grandfather knows,\nthen, that a poisoner lives here; perhaps he even suspects the person.\nHe has been fortifying you, his beloved child, against the fatal\neffects of the poison, which has failed because your system was already\nimpregnated with it. But even this would have availed little against a\nmore deadly medium of death employed four days ago, which is generally\nbut too fatal.\"\n\n\"But who, then, is this assassin, this murderer?\"\n\n\"Let me also ask you a question. Have you never seen any one enter your\nroom at night?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I have frequently seen shadows pass close to me, approach,\nand disappear; but I took them for visions raised by my feverish\nimagination, and indeed when you entered I thought I was under the\ninfluence of delirium.\"\n\n\"Then you do not know who it is that attempts your life?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Valentine; \"who could desire my death?\"\n\n\"You shall know it now, then,\" said Monte Cristo, listening.\n\n\"How do you mean?\" said Valentine, looking anxiously around.\n\n\"Because you are not feverish or delirious to-night, but thoroughly\nawake; midnight is striking, which is the hour murderers choose.\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens,\" exclaimed Valentine, wiping off the drops which ran down\nher forehead. Midnight struck slowly and sadly; every hour seemed to\nstrike with leaden weight upon the heart of the poor girl. \"Valentine,\"\nsaid the count, \"summon up all your courage; still the beatings of your\nheart; do not let a sound escape you, and feign to be asleep; then you\nwill see.\" Valentine seized the count's hand. \"I think I hear a noise,\"\nshe said; \"leave me.\"\n\n\"Good-by, for the present,\" replied the count, walking upon tiptoe\ntowards the library door, and smiling with an expression so sad and\npaternal that the young girl's heart was filled with gratitude.\nBefore closing the door he turned around once more, and said, \"Not a\nmovement--not a word; let them think you asleep, or perhaps you may be\nkilled before I have the power of helping you.\" And with this fearful\ninjunction the count disappeared through the door, which noiselessly\nclosed after him.\n\n\n\nChapter 101. Locusta.\n\nValentine was alone; two other clocks, slower than that of\nSaint-Philippe du Roule, struck the hour of midnight from different\ndirections, and excepting the rumbling of a few carriages all was\nsilent. Then Valentine's attention was engrossed by the clock in her\nroom, which marked the seconds. She began counting them, remarking that\nthey were much slower than the beatings of her heart; and still she\ndoubted,--the inoffensive Valentine could not imagine that any one\nshould desire her death. Why should they? To what end? What had she\ndone to excite the malice of an enemy? There was no fear of her falling\nasleep. One terrible idea pressed upon her mind,--that some one existed\nin the world who had attempted to assassinate her, and who was about\nto endeavor to do so again. Supposing this person, wearied at the\ninefficacy of the poison, should, as Monte Cristo intimated, have\nrecourse to steel!--What if the count should have no time to run to her\nrescue!--What if her last moments were approaching, and she should never\nagain see Morrel! When this terrible chain of ideas presented itself,\nValentine was nearly persuaded to ring the bell, and call for help. But\nthrough the door she fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count--that\neye which lived in her memory, and the recollection overwhelmed her with\nso much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude\ncould ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship.\n\nTwenty minutes, twenty tedious minutes, passed thus, then ten more,\nand at last the clock struck the half-hour. Just then the sound of\nfinger-nails slightly grating against the door of the library informed\nValentine that the count was still watching, and recommended her to\ndo the same; at the same time, on the opposite side, that is towards\nEdward's room, Valentine fancied that she heard the creaking of the\nfloor; she listened attentively, holding her breath till she was nearly\nsuffocated; the lock turned, and the door slowly opened. Valentine had\nraised herself upon her elbow, and had scarcely time to throw herself\ndown on the bed and shade her eyes with her arm; then, trembling,\nagitated, and her heart beating with indescribable terror, she awaited\nthe event.\n\nSome one approached the bed and drew back the curtains. Valentine\nsummoned every effort, and breathed with that regular respiration which\nannounces tranquil sleep. \"Valentine!\" said a low voice. Still silent:\nValentine had promised not to awake. Then everything was still,\nexcepting that Valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid\nbeing poured into the glass she had just emptied. Then she ventured to\nopen her eyelids, and glance over her extended arm. She saw a woman in a\nwhite dressing-gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass. During\nthis short time Valentine must have held her breath, or moved in some\nslight degree, for the woman, disturbed, stopped and leaned over the\nbed, in order the better to ascertain whether Valentine slept--it was\nMadame de Villefort.\n\nOn recognizing her step-mother, Valentine could not repress a shudder,\nwhich caused a vibration in the bed. Madame de Villefort instantly\nstepped back close to the wall, and there, shaded by the bed-curtains,\nshe silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of\nValentine. The latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo;\nshe fancied that the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp\nknife. Then collecting all her remaining strength, she forced herself to\nclose her eyes; but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs\nof our frame, generally so easy to accomplish, became almost impossible\nat this moment, so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid\nopen and learn the truth. Madame de Villefort, however, reassured by\nthe silence, which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of\nValentine, again extended her hand, and half hidden by the curtains\nsucceeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the glass. Then she\nretired so gently that Valentine did not know she had left the room. She\nonly witnessed the withdrawal of the arm--the fair round arm of a woman\nbut twenty-five years old, and who yet spread death around her.\n\nIt is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by Valentine\nduring the minute and a half Madame de Villefort remained in the room.\nThe grating against the library-door aroused the young girl from\nthe stupor in which she was plunged, and which almost amounted to\ninsensibility. She raised her head with an effort. The noiseless door\nagain turned on its hinges, and the Count of Monte Cristo reappeared.\n\"Well,\" said he, \"do you still doubt?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" murmured the young girl.\n\n\"Have you seen?\"\n\n\"Alas!\"\n\n\"Did you recognize?\" Valentine groaned. \"Oh, yes;\" she said, \"I saw, but\nI cannot believe!\"\n\n\"Would you rather die, then, and cause Maximilian's death?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" repeated the young girl, almost bewildered, \"can I not leave the\nhouse?--can I not escape?\"\n\n\"Valentine, the hand which now threatens you will pursue you everywhere;\nyour servants will be seduced with gold, and death will be offered to\nyou disguised in every shape. You will find it in the water you drink\nfrom the spring, in the fruit you pluck from the tree.\"\n\n\"But did you not say that my kind grandfather's precaution had\nneutralized the poison?\"\n\n\"Yes, but not against a strong dose; the poison will be changed, and the\nquantity increased.\" He took the glass and raised it to his lips. \"It\nis already done,\" he said; \"brucine is no longer employed, but a simple\nnarcotic! I can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it has been\ndissolved. If you had taken what Madame de Villefort has poured into\nyour glass, Valentine--Valentine--you would have been doomed!\"\n\n\"But,\" exclaimed the young girl, \"why am I thus pursued?\"\n\n\"Why?--are you so kind--so good--so unsuspicious of ill, that you cannot\nunderstand, Valentine?\"\n\n\"No, I have never injured her.\"\n\n\"But you are rich, Valentine; you have 200,000 livres a year, and you\nprevent her son from enjoying these 200,000. livres.\"\n\n\"How so? The fortune is not her gift, but is inherited from my\nrelations.\"\n\n\"Certainly; and that is why M. and Madame de Saint-Meran have died; that\nis why M. Noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir; that\nis why you, in your turn, are to die--it is because your father would\ninherit your property, and your brother, his only son, succeed to his.\"\n\n\"Edward? Poor child! Are all these crimes committed on his account?\"\n\n\"Ah, then you at length understand?\"\n\n\"Heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him!\"\n\n\"Valentine, you are an angel!\"\n\n\"But why is my grandfather allowed to live?\"\n\n\"It was considered, that you dead, the fortune would naturally revert\nto your brother, unless he were disinherited; and besides, the crime\nappearing useless, it would be folly to commit it.\"\n\n\"And is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has been\ninvented by a woman?\"\n\n\"Do you recollect in the arbor of the Hotel des Postes, at Perugia,\nseeing a man in a brown cloak, whom your stepmother was questioning\nupon aqua tofana? Well, ever since then, the infernal project has been\nripening in her brain.\"\n\n\"Ah, then, indeed, sir,\" said the sweet girl, bathed in tears, \"I see\nthat I am condemned to die!\"\n\n\"No, Valentine, for I have foreseen all their plots; no, your enemy is\nconquered since we know her, and you will live, Valentine--live to\nbe happy yourself, and to confer happiness upon a noble heart; but to\ninsure this you must rely on me.\"\n\n\"Command me, sir--what am I to do?\"\n\n\"You must blindly take what I give you.\"\n\n\"Alas, were it only for my own sake, I should prefer to die!\"\n\n\"You must not confide in any one--not even in your father.\"\n\n\"My father is not engaged in this fearful plot, is he, sir?\" asked\nValentine, clasping her hands.\n\n\"No; and yet your father, a man accustomed to judicial accusations,\nought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally;\nit is he who should have watched over you--he should have occupied my\nplace--he should have emptied that glass--he should have risen against\nthe assassin. Spectre against spectre!\" he murmured in a low voice, as\nhe concluded his sentence.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Valentine, \"I will do all I can to live, for there are\ntwo beings whose existence depends upon mine--my grandfather and\nMaximilian.\"\n\n\"I will watch over them as I have over you.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, do as you will with me;\" and then she added, in a low voice,\n\"oh, heavens, what will befall me?\"\n\n\"Whatever may happen, Valentine, do not be alarmed; though you suffer;\nthough you lose sight, hearing, consciousness, fear nothing; though\nyou should awake and be ignorant where you are, still do not fear;\neven though you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin.\nReassure yourself, then, and say to yourself: 'At this moment, a friend,\na father, who lives for my happiness and that of Maximilian, watches\nover me!'\"\n\n\"Alas, alas, what a fearful extremity!\"\n\n\"Valentine, would you rather denounce your stepmother?\"\n\n\"I would rather die a hundred times--oh, yes, die!\"\n\n\"No, you will not die; but will you promise me, whatever happens, that\nyou will not complain, but hope?\"\n\n\"I will think of Maximilian!\"\n\n\"You are my own darling child, Valentine! I alone can save you, and I\nwill.\" Valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands,--for\nshe felt that the moment had arrived to ask for courage,--and began to\npray, and while uttering little more than incoherent words, she forgot\nthat her white shoulders had no other covering than her long hair, and\nthat the pulsations of her heart could be seen through the lace of her\nnightdress. Monte Cristo gently laid his hand on the young girl's arm,\ndrew the velvet coverlet close to her throat, and said with a paternal\nsmile,--\"My child, believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the\ngoodness of providence and the love of Maximilian.\"\n\nThen he drew from his waistcoat-pocket the little emerald box, raised\nthe golden lid, and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea,\nwhich he placed in her hand. She took it, and looked attentively on the\ncount; there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector\nwhich commanded her veneration. She evidently interrogated him by her\nlook. \"Yes,\" said he. Valentine carried the pastille to her mouth, and\nswallowed it. \"And now, my dear child, adieu for the present. I will try\nand gain a little sleep, for you are saved.\"\n\n\"Go,\" said Valentine, \"whatever happens, I promise you not to fear.\"\n\nMonte Cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl, who\ngradually fell asleep, yielding to the effects of the narcotic the\ncount had given her. Then he took the glass, emptied three parts of the\ncontents in the fireplace, that it might be supposed Valentine had taken\nit, and replaced it on the table; then he disappeared, after throwing\na farewell glance on Valentine, who slept with the confidence and\ninnocence of an angel.\n\n\n\nChapter 102. Valentine.\n\nThe night-light continued to burn on the chimney-piece, exhausting the\nlast drops of oil which floated on the surface of the water. The globe\nof the lamp appeared of a reddish hue, and the flame, brightening before\nit expired, threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object\nhave been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in\nits final agonies. A dull and dismal light was shed over the bedclothes\nand curtains surrounding the young girl. All noise in the streets had\nceased, and the silence was frightful. It was then that the door of\nEdward's room opened, and a head we have before noticed appeared in\nthe glass opposite; it was Madame de Villefort, who came to witness\nthe effects of the drink she had prepared. She stopped in the doorway,\nlistened for a moment to the flickering of the lamp, the only sound in\nthat deserted room, and then advanced to the table to see if Valentine's\nglass were empty. It was still about a quarter full, as we before\nstated. Madame de Villefort emptied the contents into the ashes, which\nshe disturbed that they might the more readily absorb the liquid; then\nshe carefully rinsed the glass, and wiping it with her handkerchief\nreplaced it on the table.\n\nIf any one could have looked into the room just then he would have\nnoticed the hesitation with which Madame de Villefort approached the bed\nand looked fixedly on Valentine. The dim light, the profound silence,\nand the gloomy thoughts inspired by the hour, and still more by her own\nconscience, all combined to produce a sensation of fear; the poisoner\nwas terrified at the contemplation of her own work. At length she\nrallied, drew aside the curtain, and leaning over the pillow gazed\nintently on Valentine. The young girl no longer breathed, no breath\nissued through the half-closed teeth; the white lips no longer\nquivered--the eyes were suffused with a bluish vapor, and the long black\nlashes rested on a cheek white as wax. Madame de Villefort gazed upon\nthe face so expressive even in its stillness; then she ventured to raise\nthe coverlet and press her hand upon the young girl's heart. It was\ncold and motionless. She only felt the pulsation in her own fingers, and\nwithdrew her hand with a shudder. One arm was hanging out of the bed;\nfrom shoulder to elbow it was moulded after the arms of Germain\nPillon's \"Graces,\" [*] but the fore-arm seemed to be slightly distorted\nby convulsion, and the hand, so delicately formed, was resting with\nstiff outstretched fingers on the framework of the bed. The nails, too,\nwere turning blue.\n\n     * Germain Pillon was a famous French sculptor (1535-1598).\n     His best known work is \"The Three Graces,\" now in the\n     Louvre.\n\nMadame de Villefort had no longer any doubt; all was over--she had\nconsummated the last terrible work she had to accomplish. There was no\nmore to do in the room, so the poisoner retired stealthily, as though\nfearing to hear the sound of her own footsteps; but as she withdrew she\nstill held aside the curtain, absorbed in the irresistible attraction\nalways exerted by the picture of death, so long as it is merely\nmysterious and does not excite disgust. Just then the lamp again\nflickered; the noise startled Madame de Villefort, who shuddered and\ndropped the curtain. Immediately afterwards the light expired, and the\nroom was plunged in frightful obscurity, while the clock at that\nminute struck half-past four. Overpowered with agitation, the poisoner\nsucceeded in groping her way to the door, and reached her room in an\nagony of fear.\n\nThe darkness lasted two hours longer; then by degrees a cold light crept\nthrough the Venetian blinds, until at length it revealed the objects in\nthe room. About this time the nurse's cough was heard on the stairs and\nthe woman entered the room with a cup in her hand. To the tender eye\nof a father or a lover, the first glance would have sufficed to reveal\nValentine's condition; but to this hireling, Valentine only appeared to\nsleep. \"Good,\" she exclaimed, approaching the table, \"she has taken part\nof her draught; the glass is three-quarters empty.\"\n\nThen she went to the fireplace and lit the fire, and although she\nhad just left her bed, she could not resist the temptation offered by\nValentine's sleep, so she threw herself into an arm-chair to snatch a\nlittle more rest. The clock striking eight awoke her. Astonished at the\nprolonged slumber of the patient, and frightened to see that the arm was\nstill hanging out of the bed, she advanced towards Valentine, and for\nthe first time noticed the white lips. She tried to replace the arm, but\nit moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick-nurse.\nShe screamed aloud; then running to the door exclaimed,--\"Help, help!\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked M. d'Avrigny, at the foot of the stairs, it\nbeing the hour he usually visited her.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Villefort, rushing from his room. \"Doctor, do you\nhear them call for help?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; let us hasten up; it was in Valentine's room.\" But before the\ndoctor and the father could reach the room, the servants who were on the\nsame floor had entered, and seeing Valentine pale and motionless on her\nbed, they lifted up their hands towards heaven and stood transfixed, as\nthough struck by lightening. \"Call Madame de Villefort!--Wake Madame\nde Villefort!\" cried the procureur from the door of his chamber, which\napparently he scarcely dared to leave. But instead of obeying him, the\nservants stood watching M. d'Avrigny, who ran to Valentine, and raised\nher in his arms. \"What?--this one, too?\" he exclaimed. \"Oh, where will\nbe the end?\" Villefort rushed into the room. \"What are you saying,\ndoctor?\" he exclaimed, raising his hands to heaven.\n\n\"I say that Valentine is dead!\" replied d'Avrigny, in a voice terrible\nin its solemn calm.\n\nM. de Villefort staggered and buried his head in the bed. On the\nexclamation of the doctor and the cry of the father, the servants all\nfled with muttered imprecations; they were heard running down the stairs\nand through the long passages, then there was a rush in the court,\nafterwards all was still; they had, one and all, deserted the accursed\nhouse. Just then, Madame de Villefort, in the act of slipping on\nher dressing-gown, threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood\nmotionless, as though interrogating the occupants of the room, while she\nendeavored to call up some rebellious tears. On a sudden she stepped,\nor rather bounded, with outstretched arms, towards the table. She saw\nd'Avrigny curiously examining the glass, which she felt certain of\nhaving emptied during the night. It was now a third full, just as it\nwas when she threw the contents into the ashes. The spectre of Valentine\nrising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less. It was, indeed,\nthe same color as the draught she had poured into the glass, and which\nValentine had drunk}; it was indeed the poison, which could not deceive\nM. d'Avrigny, which he now examined so closely; it was doubtless a\nmiracle from heaven, that, notwithstanding her precautions, there should\nbe some trace, some proof remaining to reveal the crime. While Madame\nde Villefort remained rooted to the spot like a statue of terror, and\nVillefort, with his head hidden in the bedclothes, saw nothing around\nhim, d'Avrigny approached the window, that he might the better examine\nthe contents of the glass, and dipping the tip of his finger in, tasted\nit. \"Ah,\" he exclaimed, \"it is no longer brucine that is used; let me\nsee what it is!\"\n\nThen he ran to one of the cupboards in Valentine's room, which had been\ntransformed into a medicine closet, and taking from its silver case a\nsmall bottle of nitric acid, dropped a little of it into the liquor,\nwhich immediately changed to a blood-red color. \"Ah,\" exclaimed\nd'Avrigny, in a voice in which the horror of a judge unveiling the truth\nwas mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery. Madame\nde Villefort was overpowered, her eyes first flashed and then swam,\nshe staggered towards the door and disappeared. Directly afterwards the\ndistant sound of a heavy weight falling on the ground was heard, but\nno one paid any attention to it; the nurse was engaged in watching\nthe chemical analysis, and Villefort was still absorbed in grief. M.\nd'Avrigny alone had followed Madame de Villefort with his eyes, and\nwatched her hurried retreat. He lifted up the drapery over the entrance\nto Edward's room, and his eye reaching as far as Madame de Villefort's\napartment, he beheld her extended lifeless on the floor. \"Go to the\nassistance of Madame de Villefort,\" he said to the nurse. \"Madame de\nVillefort is ill.\"\n\n\"But Mademoiselle de Villefort\"--stammered the nurse.\n\n\"Mademoiselle de Villefort no longer requires help,\" said d'Avrigny,\n\"since she is dead.\"\n\n\"Dead,--dead!\" groaned forth Villefort, in a paroxysm of grief, which\nwas the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the iron\nheart of that man.\n\n\"Dead!\" repeated a third voice. \"Who said Valentine was dead?\"\n\nThe two men turned round, and saw Morrel standing at the door, pale and\nterror-stricken. This is what had happened. At the usual time, Morrel\nhad presented himself at the little door leading to Noirtier's room.\nContrary to custom, the door was open, and having no occasion to ring he\nentered. He waited for a moment in the hall and called for a servant to\nconduct him to M. Noirtier; but no one answered, the servants having,\nas we know, deserted the house. Morrel had no particular reason for\nuneasiness; Monte Cristo had promised him that Valentine should live,\nand so far he had always fulfilled his word. Every night the count had\ngiven him news, which was the next morning confirmed by Noirtier. Still\nthis extraordinary silence appeared strange to him, and he called a\nsecond and third time; still no answer. Then he determined to go up.\nNoirtier's room was opened, like all the rest. The first thing he saw\nwas the old man sitting in his arm-chair in his usual place, but his\neyes expressed alarm, which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread\nhis features.\n\n\"How are you, sir?\" asked Morrel, with a sickness of heart.\n\n\"Well,\" answered the old man, by closing his eyes; but his appearance\nmanifested increasing uneasiness.\n\n\"You are thoughtful, sir,\" continued Morrel; \"you want something; shall\nI call one of the servants?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Noirtier.\n\nMorrel pulled the bell, but though he nearly broke the cord no one\nanswered. He turned towards Noirtier; the pallor and anguish expressed\non his countenance momentarily increased.\n\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed Morrel, \"why do they not come? Is any one ill in the\nhouse?\" The eyes of Noirtier seemed as though they would start from\ntheir sockets. \"What is the matter? You alarm me. Valentine? Valentine?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" signed Noirtier. Maximilian tried to speak, but he could\narticulate nothing; he staggered, and supported himself against the\nwainscot. Then he pointed to the door.\n\n\"Yes, yes, yes!\" continued the old man. Maximilian rushed up the little\nstaircase, while Noirtier's eyes seemed to say,--\"Quicker, quicker!\"\n\nIn a minute the young man darted through several rooms, till at length\nhe reached Valentine's. There was no occasion to push the door, it was\nwide open. A sob was the only sound he heard. He saw as though in a\nmist, a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white\ndrapery. A terrible fear transfixed him. It was then he heard a voice\nexclaim \"Valentine is dead!\" and another voice which, like an echo\nrepeated,--\"Dead,--dead!\"\n\n\n\nChapter 103. Maximilian.\n\nVillefort rose, half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm\nof grief. The terrible office he had held for twenty-five years had\nsucceeded in making him more or less than man. His glance, at first\nwandering, fixed itself upon Morrel. \"Who are you, sir,\" he asked, \"that\nforget that this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death?\nGo, sir, go!\" But Morrel remained motionless; he could not detach his\neyes from that disordered bed, and the pale corpse of the young girl\nwho was lying on it. \"Go!--do you hear?\" said Villefort, while d'Avrigny\nadvanced to lead Morrel out. Maximilian stared for a moment at the\ncorpse, gazed all around the room, then upon the two men; he opened\nhis mouth to speak, but finding it impossible to give utterance to the\ninnumerable ideas that occupied his brain, he went out, thrusting his\nhands through his hair in such a manner that Villefort and d'Avrigny,\nfor a moment diverted from the engrossing topic, exchanged glances,\nwhich seemed to say,--\"He is mad!\"\n\nBut in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an\nextraordinary weight. Morrel was seen carrying, with superhuman\nstrength, the arm-chair containing Noirtier up-stairs. When he reached\nthe landing he placed the arm-chair on the floor and rapidly rolled it\ninto Valentine's room. This could only have been accomplished by means\nof unnatural strength supplied by powerful excitement. But the most\nfearful spectacle was Noirtier being pushed towards the bed, his face\nexpressing all his meaning, and his eyes supplying the want of every\nother faculty. That pale face and flaming glance appeared to Villefort\nlike a frightful apparition. Each time he had been brought into contact\nwith his father, something terrible had happened. \"See what they have\ndone!\" cried Morrel, with one hand leaning on the back of the chair, and\nthe other extended towards Valentine. \"See, my father, see!\"\n\nVillefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man, who,\nalmost a stranger to him, called Noirtier his father. At this moment\nthe whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became\nbloodshot; the veins of the throat swelled; his cheeks and temples\nbecame purple, as though he was struck with epilepsy; nothing was\nwanting to complete this but the utterance of a cry. And the cry issued\nfrom his pores, if we may thus speak--a cry frightful in its silence.\nD'Avrigny rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful\nrestorative.\n\n\"Sir,\" cried Morrel, seizing the moist hand of the paralytic, \"they ask\nme who I am, and what right I have to be here. Oh, you know it, tell\nthem, tell them!\" And the young man's voice was choked by sobs. As for\nthe old man, his chest heaved with his panting respiration. One could\nhave thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death. At\nlength, happier than the young man, who sobbed without weeping, tears\nglistened in the eyes of Noirtier. \"Tell them,\" said Morrel in a hoarse\nvoice, \"tell them that I am her betrothed. Tell them she was my beloved,\nmy noble girl, my only blessing in the world. Tell them--oh, tell them,\nthat corpse belongs to me!\"\n\nThe young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish, fell heavily\non his knees before the bed, which his fingers grasped with convulsive\nenergy. D'Avrigny, unable to bear the sight of this touching emotion,\nturned away; and Villefort, without seeking any further explanation,\nand attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us\ntowards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn, extended his\nhand towards the young man. But Morrel saw nothing; he had grasped the\nhand of Valentine, and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as\nhe bit the sheets. For some time nothing was heard in that chamber but\nsobs, exclamations, and prayers. At length Villefort, the most composed\nof all, spoke: \"Sir,\" said he to Maximilian, \"you say you loved\nValentine, that you were betrothed to her. I knew nothing of this\nengagement, of this love, yet I, her father, forgive you, for I see that\nyour grief is real and deep; and besides my own sorrow is too great for\nanger to find a place in my heart. But you see that the angel whom\nyou hoped for has left this earth--she has nothing more to do with the\nadoration of men. Take a last farewell, sir, of her sad remains; take\nthe hand you expected to possess once more within your own, and then\nseparate yourself from her forever. Valentine now requires only the\nministrations of the priest.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, sir,\" exclaimed Morrel, raising himself on one knee,\nhis heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet felt--\"you\nare mistaken; Valentine, dying as she has, not only requires a priest,\nbut an avenger. You, M. de Villefort, send for the priest; I will be the\navenger.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, sir?\" asked Villefort, trembling at the new idea\ninspired by the delirium of Morrel.\n\n\"I tell you, sir, that two persons exist in you; the father has mourned\nsufficiently, now let the procureur fulfil his office.\"\n\nThe eyes of Noirtier glistened, and d'Avrigny approached.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Morrel, reading all that passed through the minds of\nthe witnesses to the scene, \"I know what I am saying, and you know as\nwell as I do what I am about to say--Valentine has been assassinated!\"\nVillefort hung his head, d'Avrigny approached nearer, and Noirtier said\n\"Yes\" with his eyes. \"Now, sir,\" continued Morrel, \"in these days no one\ncan disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to\nthe cause of her disappearance, even were she not a young, beautiful,\nand adorable creature like Valentine. Mr. Procureur,\" said Morrel with\nincreasing vehemence, \"no mercy is allowed; I denounce the crime; it\nis your place to seek the assassin.\" The young man's implacable eyes\ninterrogated Villefort, who, on his side, glanced from Noirtier to\nd'Avrigny. But instead of finding sympathy in the eyes of the doctor\nand his father, he only saw an expression as inflexible as that of\nMaximilian. \"Yes,\" indicated the old man.\n\n\"Assuredly,\" said d'Avrigny.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Villefort, striving to struggle against this triple force\nand his own emotion,--\"sir, you are deceived; no one commits crimes\nhere. I am stricken by fate. It is horrible, indeed, but no one\nassassinates.\"\n\nThe eyes of Noirtier lighted up with rage, and d'Avrigny prepared to\nspeak. Morrel, however, extended his arm, and commanded silence. \"And I\nsay that murders are committed here,\" said Morrel, whose voice, though\nlower in tone, lost none of its terrible distinctness: \"I tell you\nthat this is the fourth victim within the last four months. I tell\nyou, Valentine's life was attempted by poison four days ago, though she\nescaped, owing to the precautions of M. Noirtier. I tell you that the\ndose has been double, the poison changed, and that this time it has\nsucceeded. I tell you that you know these things as well as I do, since\nthis gentleman has forewarned you, both as a doctor and as a friend.\"\n\n\"Oh, you rave, sir,\" exclaimed Villefort, in vain endeavoring to escape\nthe net in which he was taken.\n\n\"I rave?\" said Morrel; \"well, then, I appeal to M. d'Avrigny himself.\nAsk him, sir, if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden of\nthis house on the night of Madame de Saint-Meran's death. You thought\nyourselves alone, and talked about that tragical death, and the\nfatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder\nof Valentine.\" Villefort and d'Avrigny exchanged looks. \"Yes, yes,\"\ncontinued Morrel; \"recall the scene, for the words you thought were\nonly given to silence and solitude fell into my ears. Certainly, after\nwitnessing the culpable indolence manifested by M. de Villefort towards\nhis own relations, I ought to have denounced him to the authorities;\nthen I should not have been an accomplice to thy death, as I now am,\nsweet, beloved Valentine; but the accomplice shall become the avenger.\nThis fourth murder is apparent to all, and if thy father abandon thee,\nValentine, it is I, and I swear it, that shall pursue the assassin.\"\nAnd this time, as though nature had at least taken compassion on the\nvigorous frame, nearly bursting with its own strength, the words of\nMorrel were stifled in his throat; his breast heaved; the tears, so long\nrebellious, gushed from his eyes; and he threw himself weeping on his\nknees by the side of the bed.\n\nThen d'Avrigny spoke. \"And I, too,\" he exclaimed in a low voice, \"I\nunite with M. Morrel in demanding justice for crime; my blood boils at\nthe idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession.\"\n\n\"Oh, merciful heavens!\" murmured Villefort. Morrel raised his head,\nand reading the eyes of the old man, which gleamed with unnatural\nlustre,--\"Stay,\" he said, \"M. Noirtier wishes to speak.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" indicated Noirtier, with an expression the more terrible, from\nall his faculties being centred in his glance.\n\n\"Do you know the assassin?\" asked Morrel.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Noirtier.\n\n\"And will you direct us?\" exclaimed the young man. \"Listen, M.\nd'Avrigny, listen!\" Noirtier looked upon Morrel with one of those\nmelancholy smiles which had so often made Valentine happy, and thus\nfixed his attention. Then, having riveted the eyes of his interlocutor\non his own, he glanced towards the door.\n\n\"Do you wish me to leave?\" said Morrel, sadly.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Noirtier.\n\n\"Alas, alas, sir, have pity on me!\"\n\nThe old man's eyes remained fixed on the door.\n\n\"May I, at least, return?\" asked Morrel.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Must I leave alone?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Whom am I to take with me? The procureur?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"The doctor?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You wish to remain alone with M. de Villefort?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But can he understand you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Villefort, inexpressibly delighted to think that the\ninquiries were to be made by him alone,--\"oh, be satisfied, I can\nunderstand my father.\" D'Avrigny took the young man's arm, and led\nhim out of the room. A more than deathlike silence then reigned in\nthe house. At the end of a quarter of an hour a faltering footstep\nwas heard, and Villefort appeared at the door of the apartment where\nd'Avrigny and Morrel had been staying, one absorbed in meditation, the\nother in grief. \"You can come,\" he said, and led them back to Noirtier.\nMorrel looked attentively on Villefort. His face was livid, large drops\nrolled down his face, and in his fingers he held the fragments of a\nquill pen which he had torn to atoms.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said in a hoarse voice, \"give me your word of honor that\nthis horrible secret shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves!\" The\ntwo men drew back.\n\n\"I entreat you.\"--continued Villefort.\n\n\"But,\" said Morrel, \"the culprit--the murderer--the assassin.\"\n\n\"Do not alarm yourself, sir; justice will be done,\" said Villefort. \"My\nfather has revealed the culprit's name; my father thirsts for revenge as\nmuch as you do, yet even he conjures you as I do to keep this secret. Do\nyou not, father?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" resolutely replied Noirtier. Morrel suffered an exclamation of\nhorror and surprise to escape him. \"Oh, sir,\" said Villefort, arresting\nMaximilian by the arm, \"if my father, the inflexible man, makes this\nrequest, it is because he knows, be assured, that Valentine will be\nterribly revenged. Is it not so, father?\" The old man made a sign in the\naffirmative. Villefort continued: \"He knows me, and I have pledged my\nword to him. Rest assured, gentlemen, that within three days, in a less\ntime than justice would demand, the revenge I shall have taken for the\nmurder of my child will be such as to make the boldest heart tremble;\"\nand as he spoke these words he ground his teeth, and grasped the old\nman's senseless hand.\n\n\"Will this promise be fulfilled, M. Noirtier?\" asked Morrel, while\nd'Avrigny looked inquiringly.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister joy.\n\n\"Swear, then,\" said Villefort, joining the hands of Morrel and\nd'Avrigny, \"swear that you will spare the honor of my house, and leave\nme to avenge my child.\" D'Avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble\n\"Yes,\" but Morrel, disengaging his hand, rushed to the bed, and after\nhaving pressed the cold lips of Valentine with his own, hurriedly left,\nuttering a long, deep groan of despair and anguish. We have before\nstated that all the servants had fled. M. de Villefort was therefore\nobliged to request M. d'Avrigny to superintend all the arrangements\nconsequent upon a death in a large city, more especially a death under\nsuch suspicious circumstances.\n\nIt was something terrible to witness the silent agony, the mute despair\nof Noirtier, whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks. Villefort\nretired to his study, and d'Avrigny left to summon the doctor of the\nmayoralty, whose office it is to examine bodies after decease, and who\nis expressly named \"the doctor of the dead.\" M. Noirtier could not be\npersuaded to quit his grandchild. At the end of a quarter of an hour M.\nd'Avrigny returned with his associate; they found the outer gate closed,\nand not a servant remaining in the house; Villefort himself was obliged\nto open to them. But he stopped on the landing; he had not the courage\nto again visit the death chamber. The two doctors, therefore, entered\nthe room alone. Noirtier was near the bed, pale, motionless, and silent\nas the corpse. The district doctor approached with the indifference of\na man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead; he then lifted\nthe sheet which was placed over the face, and just unclosed the lips.\n\n\"Alas,\" said d'Avrigny, \"she is indeed dead, poor child!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the doctor laconically, dropping the sheet he had\nraised. Noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse, rattling sound; the old man's\neyes sparkled, and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold\nhis child. He therefore approached the bed, and while his companion was\ndipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in\nchloride of lime, he uncovered the calm and pale face, which looked like\nthat of a sleeping angel. A tear, which appeared in the old man's eye,\nexpressed his thanks to the doctor. The doctor of the dead then laid his\npermit on the corner of the table, and having fulfilled his duty, was\nconducted out by d'Avrigny. Villefort met them at the door of his\nstudy; having in a few words thanked the district doctor, he turned to\nd'Avrigny, and said,--\"And now the priest.\"\n\n\"Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine?\" asked\nd'Avrigny.\n\n\"No.\" said Villefort; \"fetch the nearest.\"\n\n\"The nearest,\" said the district doctor, \"is a good Italian abbe, who\nlives next door to you. Shall I call on him as I pass?\"\n\n\"D'Avrigny,\" said Villefort, \"be so kind, I beseech you, as to accompany\nthis gentleman. Here is the key of the door, so that you can go in and\nout as you please; you will bring the priest with you, and will oblige\nme by introducing him into my child's room.\"\n\n\"Do you wish to see him?\"\n\n\"I only wish to be alone. You will excuse me, will you not? A priest\ncan understand a father's grief.\" And M. de Villefort, giving the key to\nd'Avrigny, again bade farewell to the strange doctor, and retired to his\nstudy, where he began to work. For some temperaments work is a remedy\nfor all afflictions. As the doctors entered the street, they saw a man\nin a cassock standing on the threshold of the next door. \"This is the\nabbe of whom I spoke,\" said the doctor to d'Avrigny. D'Avrigny accosted\nthe priest. \"Sir,\" he said, \"are you disposed to confer a great\nobligation on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter? I mean\nM. de Villefort, the king's attorney.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the priest, in a marked Italian accent; \"yes, I have heard\nthat death is in that house.\"\n\n\"Then I need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you.\"\n\n\"I was about to offer myself, sir,\" said the priest; \"it is our mission\nto forestall our duties.\"\n\n\"It is a young girl.\"\n\n\"I know it, sir; the servants who fled from the house informed me. I\nalso know that her name is Valentine, and I have already prayed for\nher.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said d'Avrigny; \"since you have commenced your sacred\noffice, deign to continue it. Come and watch by the dead, and all the\nwretched family will be grateful to you.\"\n\n\"I am going, sir; and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will be\nmore fervent than mine.\" D'Avrigny took the priest's hand, and\nwithout meeting Villefort, who was engaged in his study, they reached\nValentine's room, which on the following night was to be occupied by\nthe undertakers. On entering the room, Noirtier's eyes met those of the\nabbe, and no doubt he read some particular expression in them, for he\nremained in the room. D'Avrigny recommended the attention of the priest\nto the living as well as to the dead, and the abbe promised to devote\nhis prayers to Valentine and his attentions to Noirtier. In order,\ndoubtless, that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred\nmission, the priest rose as soon as d'Avrigny departed, and not only\nbolted the door through which the doctor had just left, but also that\nleading to Madame de Villefort's room.\n\n\n\nChapter 104. Danglars Signature.\n\nThe next morning dawned dull and cloudy. During the night the\nundertakers had executed their melancholy office, and wrapped the corpse\nin the winding-sheet, which, whatever may be said about the equality of\ndeath, is at least a last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life. This\nwinding-sheet was nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric, which\nthe young girl had bought a fortnight before. During the evening two\nmen, engaged for the purpose, had carried Noirtier from Valentine's room\ninto his own, and contrary to all expectation there was no difficulty\nin withdrawing him from his child. The Abbe Busoni had watched till\ndaylight, and then left without calling any one. D'Avrigny returned\nabout eight o'clock in the morning; he met Villefort on his way to\nNoirtier's room, and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept.\nThey found him in the large arm-chair, which served him for a bed,\nenjoying a calm, nay, almost a smiling sleep. They both stood in\namazement at the door.\n\n\"See,\" said d'Avrigny to Villefort, \"nature knows how to alleviate the\ndeepest sorrow. No one can say that M. Noirtier did not love his child,\nand yet he sleeps.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are right,\" replied Villefort, surprised; \"he sleeps, indeed!\nAnd this is the more strange, since the least contradiction keeps him\nawake all night.\"\n\n\"Grief has stunned him,\" replied d'Avrigny; and they both returned\nthoughtfully to the procureur's study.\n\n\"See, I have not slept,\" said Villefort, showing his undisturbed bed;\n\"grief does not stun me. I have not been in bed for two nights; but\nthen look at my desk; see what I have written during these two days and\nnights. I have filled those papers, and have made out the accusation\nagainst the assassin Benedetto. Oh, work, work,--my passion, my joy, my\ndelight,--it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows!\" and he convulsively\ngrasped the hand of d'Avrigny.\n\n\"Do you require my services now?\" asked d'Avrigny.\n\n\"No,\" said Villefort; \"only return again at eleven o'clock; at twelve\nthe--the--oh, heavens, my poor, poor child!\" and the procureur again\nbecoming a man, lifted up his eyes and groaned.\n\n\"Shall you be present in the reception room?\"\n\n\"No; I have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office. I shall work,\ndoctor--when I work I forget everything.\" And, indeed, no sooner had\nthe doctor left the room, than he was again absorbed in study. On the\ndoorsteps d'Avrigny met the cousin whom Villefort had mentioned, a\npersonage as insignificant in our story as in the world he occupied--one\nof those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to\nothers. He was punctual, dressed in black, with crape around his hat,\nand presented himself at his cousin's with a face made up for the\noccasion, and which he could alter as might be required. At twelve\no'clock the mourning-coaches rolled into the paved court, and the Rue du\nFaubourg Saint-Honore was filled with a crowd of idlers, equally pleased\nto witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich, and who rush\nwith the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the marriage of a\nduchess.\n\nGradually the reception-room filled, and some of our old friends\nmade their appearance--we mean Debray, Chateau-Renaud, and Beauchamp,\naccompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar, in literature,\nor the army, for M. de Villefort moved in the first Parisian circles,\nless owing to his social position than to his personal merit. The cousin\nstanding at the door ushered in the guests, and it was rather a relief\nto the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves, and who did\nnot exact a mournful face or force tears, as would have been the case\nwith a father, a brother, or a lover. Those who were acquainted\nsoon formed into little groups. One of them was made of Debray,\nChateau-Renaud, and Beauchamp.\n\n\"Poor girl,\" said Debray, like the rest, paying an involuntary tribute\nto the sad event,--\"poor girl, so young, so rich, so beautiful! Could\nyou have imagined this scene, Chateau-Renaud, when we saw her, at the\nmost three weeks ago, about to sign that contract?\"\n\n\"Indeed, no,\" said Chateau-Renaud--\"Did you know her?\"\n\n\"I spoke to her once or twice at Madame de Morcerf's, among the rest;\nshe appeared to me charming, though rather melancholy. Where is her\nstepmother? Do you know?\"\n\n\"She is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who is\nreceiving us.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\"\n\n\"Whom do you mean?\"\n\n\"The gentleman who receives us? Is he a deputy?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. I am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day,\" said\nBeauchamp; \"but he is perfectly unknown to me.\"\n\n\"Have you mentioned this death in your paper?\"\n\n\"It has been mentioned, but the article is not mine; indeed, I doubt if\nit will please M. Villefort, for it says that if four successive deaths\nhad happened anywhere else than in the house of the king's attorney, he\nwould have interested himself somewhat more about it.\"\n\n\"Still,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"Dr. d'Avrigny, who attends my mother,\ndeclares he is in despair about it. But whom are you seeking, Debray?\"\n\n\"I am seeking the Count of Monte Cristo\" said the young man.\n\n\"I met him on the boulevard, on my way here,\" said Beauchamp. \"I think\nhe is about to leave Paris; he was going to his banker.\"\n\n\"His banker? Danglars is his banker, is he not?\" asked Chateau-Renaud of\nDebray.\n\n\"I believe so,\" replied the secretary with slight uneasiness. \"But Monte\nCristo is not the only one I miss here; I do not see Morrel.\"\n\n\"Morrel? Do they know him?\" asked Chateau-Renaud. \"I think he has only\nbeen introduced to Madame de Villefort.\"\n\n\"Still, he ought to have been here,\" said Debray; \"I wonder what will\nbe talked about to-night; this funeral is the news of the day. But hush,\nhere comes our minister of justice; he will feel obliged to make some\nlittle speech to the cousin,\" and the three young men drew near to\nlisten. Beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the\nfuneral he had met Monte Cristo, who was directing his steps towards the\nRue de la Chausse d'Antin, to M. Danglars'.\n\nThe banker saw the carriage of the count enter the court yard, and\nadvanced to meet him with a sad, though affable smile. \"Well,\" said\nhe, extending his hand to Monte Cristo, \"I suppose you have come to\nsympathize with me, for indeed misfortune has taken possession of my\nhouse. When I perceived you, I was just asking myself whether I had not\nwished harm towards those poor Morcerfs, which would have justified the\nproverb of 'He who wishes misfortunes to happen to others experiences\nthem himself.' Well, on my word of honor, I answered, 'No!' I wished\nno ill to Morcerf; he was a little proud, perhaps, for a man who like\nmyself has risen from nothing; but we all have our faults. Do you know,\ncount, that persons of our time of life--not that you belong to the\nclass, you are still a young man,--but as I was saying, persons of our\ntime of life have been very unfortunate this year. For example, look at\nthe puritanical procureur, who has just lost his daughter, and in fact\nnearly all his family, in so singular a manner; Morcerf dishonored\nand dead; and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of\nBenedetto; besides\"--\n\n\"Besides what?\" asked the Count.\n\n\"Alas, do you not know?\"\n\n\"What new calamity?\"\n\n\"My daughter\"--\n\n\"Mademoiselle Danglars?\"\n\n\"Eugenie has left us!\"\n\n\"Good heavens, what are you telling me?\"\n\n\"The truth, my dear count. Oh, how happy you must be in not having\neither wife or children!\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do.\"\n\n\"And so Mademoiselle Danglars\"--\n\n\"She could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch, so she\nasked permission to travel.\"\n\n\"And is she gone?\"\n\n\"The other night she left.\"\n\n\"With Madame Danglars?\"\n\n\"No, with a relation. But still, we have quite lost our dear Eugenie;\nfor I doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to France.\"\n\n\"Still, baron,\" said Monte Cristo, \"family griefs, or indeed any other\naffliction which would crush a man whose child was his only treasure,\nare endurable to a millionaire. Philosophers may well say, and practical\nmen will always support the opinion, that money mitigates many trials;\nand if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm, you ought to\nbe very easily consoled--you, the king of finance, the focus of\nimmeasurable power.\"\n\nDanglars looked at him askance, as though to ascertain whether he spoke\nseriously. \"Yes,\" he answered, \"if a fortune brings consolation, I ought\nto be consoled; I am rich.\"\n\n\"So rich, dear sir, that your fortune resembles the pyramids; if you\nwished to demolish them you could not, and if it were possible, you\nwould not dare!\" Danglars smiled at the good-natured pleasantry of the\ncount. \"That reminds me,\" he said, \"that when you entered I was on the\npoint of signing five little bonds; I have already signed two: will you\nallow me to do the same to the others?\"\n\n\"Pray do so.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence, during which the noise of the banker's pen\nwas alone heard, while Monte Cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the\nceiling. \"Are they Spanish, Haitian, or Neapolitan bonds?\" said Monte\nCristo. \"No,\" said Danglars, smiling, \"they are bonds on the bank of\nFrance, payable to bearer. Stay, count,\" he added, \"you, who may be\ncalled the emperor, if I claim the title of king of finance, have you\nmany pieces of paper of this size, each worth a million?\" The count took\ninto his hands the papers, which Danglars had so proudly presented to\nhim, and read:--\n\n\"To the Governor of the Bank. Please pay to my order, from the fund\ndeposited by me, the sum of a million, and charge the same to my\naccount.\n\n\"Baron Danglars.\"\n\n\"One, two, three, four, five,\" said Monte Cristo; \"five millions--why\nwhat a Croesus you are!\"\n\n\"This is how I transact business,\" said Danglars.\n\n\"It is really wonderful,\" said the count; \"above all, if, as I suppose,\nit is payable at sight.\"\n\n\"It is, indeed, said Danglars.\n\n\"It is a fine thing to have such credit; really, it is only in France\nthese things are done. Five millions on five little scraps of paper!--it\nmust be seen to be believed.\"\n\n\"You do not doubt it?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"You say so with an accent--stay, you shall be convinced; take my clerk\nto the bank, and you will see him leave it with an order on the Treasury\nfor the same sum.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Monte Cristo folding the five notes, \"most decidedly not; the\nthing is so curious, I will make the experiment myself. I am credited\non you for six millions. I have drawn nine hundred thousand francs, you\ntherefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand francs. I\nwill take the five scraps of paper that I now hold as bonds, with your\nsignature alone, and here is a receipt in full for the six millions\nbetween us. I had prepared it beforehand, for I am much in want of money\nto-day.\" And Monte Cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one\nhand, while with the other he held out the receipt to Danglars. If\na thunderbolt had fallen at the banker's feet, he could not have\nexperienced greater terror.\n\n\"What,\" he stammered, \"do you mean to keep that money? Excuse me,\nexcuse me, but I owe this money to the charity fund,--a deposit which I\npromised to pay this morning.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, then,\" said Monte Cristo, \"I am not particular about these\nfive notes, pay me in a different form; I wished, from curiosity, to\ntake these, that I might be able to say that without any advice or\npreparation the house of Danglars had paid me five millions without a\nminute's delay; it would have been remarkable. But here are your bonds;\npay me differently;\" and he held the bonds towards Danglars, who seized\nthem like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is\nbeing wrested from its grasp. Suddenly he rallied, made a violent effort\nto restrain himself, and then a smile gradually widened the features of\nhis disturbed countenance.\n\n\"Certainly,\" he said, \"your receipt is money.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, yes; and if you were at Rome, the house of Thomson & French\nwould make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt than\nyou have just done.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, count, pardon me.\"\n\n\"Then I may keep this money?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Danglars, while the perspiration started from the roots of\nhis hair. \"Yes, keep it--keep it.\"\n\nMonte Cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable\nexpression which seemed to say, \"Come, reflect; if you repent there is\nstill time.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Danglars, \"no, decidedly no; keep my signatures. But you know\nnone are so formal as bankers in transacting business; I intended this\nmoney for the charity fund, and I seemed to be robbing them if I did not\npay them with these precise bonds. How absurd--as if one crown were\nnot as good as another. Excuse me;\" and he began to laugh loudly, but\nnervously.\n\n\"Certainly, I excuse you,\" said Monte Cristo graciously, \"and pocket\nthem.\" And he placed the bonds in his pocket-book.\n\n\"But,\" said Danglars, \"there is still a sum of one hundred thousand\nfrancs?\"\n\n\"Oh, a mere nothing,\" said Monte Cristo. \"The balance would come to\nabout that sum; but keep it, and we shall be quits.\"\n\n\"Count,\" said Danglars, \"are you speaking seriously?\"\n\n\"I never joke with bankers,\" said Monte Cristo in a freezing manner,\nwhich repelled impertinence; and he turned to the door, just as the\nvalet de chambre announced,--\"M. de Boville, receiver-general of the\ncharities.\"\n\n\"Ma foi,\" said Monte Cristo; \"I think I arrived just in time to obtain\nyour signatures, or they would have been disputed with me.\"\n\nDanglars again became pale, and hastened to conduct the count out. Monte\nCristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with M. de Boville, who was standing\nin the waiting-room, and who was introduced into Danglars' room as soon\nas the count had left. The count's sad face was illumined by a faint\nsmile, as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver-general held in\nhis hand. At the door he found his carriage, and was immediately driven\nto the bank. Meanwhile Danglars, repressing all emotion, advanced to\nmeet the receiver-general. We need not say that a smile of condescension\nwas stamped upon his lips. \"Good-morning, creditor,\" said he; \"for I\nwager anything it is the creditor who visits me.\"\n\n\"You are right, baron,\" answered M. de Boville; \"the charities present\nthemselves to you through me: the widows and orphans depute me to\nreceive alms to the amount of five millions from you.\"\n\n\"And yet they say orphans are to be pitied,\" said Danglars, wishing to\nprolong the jest. \"Poor things!\"\n\n\"Here I am in their name,\" said M. de Boville; \"but did you receive my\nletter yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I have brought my receipt.\"\n\n\"My dear M. de Boville, your widows and orphans must oblige me by\nwaiting twenty-four hours, since M. de Monte Cristo whom you just saw\nleaving here--you did see him, I think?\"\n\n\"Yes; well?\"\n\n\"Well, M. de Monte Cristo has just carried off their five millions.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"The count has an unlimited credit upon me; a credit opened by Thomson\n& French, of Rome; he came to demand five millions at once, which I paid\nhim with checks on the bank. My funds are deposited there, and you\ncan understand that if I draw out ten millions on the same day it will\nappear rather strange to the governor. Two days will be a different\nthing,\" said Danglars, smiling.\n\n\"Come,\" said Boville, with a tone of entire incredulity, \"five millions\nto that gentleman who just left, and who bowed to me as though he knew\nme?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he knows you, though you do not know him; M. de Monte Cristo\nknows everybody.\"\n\n\"Five millions!\"\n\n\"Here is his receipt. Believe your own eyes.\" M. de Boville took the\npaper Danglars presented him, and read:--\n\n\"Received of Baron Danglars the sum of five million one hundred thousand\nfrancs, to be repaid on demand by the house of Thomson & French of\nRome.\"\n\n\"It is really true,\" said M. de Boville.\n\n\"Do you know the house of Thomson & French?\"\n\n\"Yes, I once had business to transact with it to the amount of 200,000\nfrancs; but since then I have not heard it mentioned.\"\n\n\"It is one of the best houses in Europe,\" said Danglars, carelessly\nthrowing down the receipt on his desk.\n\n\"And he had five millions in your hands alone! Why, this Count of Monte\nCristo must be a nabob?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do not know what he is; he has three unlimited credits--one\non me, one on Rothschild, one on Lafitte; and, you see,\" he added\ncarelessly, \"he has given me the preference, by leaving a balance\nof 100,000 francs.\" M. de Boville manifested signs of extraordinary\nadmiration. \"I must visit him,\" he said, \"and obtain some pious grant\nfrom him.\"\n\n\"Oh, you may make sure of him; his charities alone amount to 20,000\nfrancs a month.\"\n\n\"It is magnificent! I will set before him the example of Madame de\nMorcerf and her son.\"\n\n\"What example?\"\n\n\"They gave all their fortune to the hospitals.\"\n\n\"What fortune?\"\n\n\"Their own--M. de Morcerf's, who is deceased.\"\n\n\"For what reason?\"\n\n\"Because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired.\"\n\n\"And what are they to live upon?\"\n\n\"The mother retires into the country, and the son enters the army.\"\n\n\"Well, I must confess, these are scruples.\"\n\n\"I registered their deed of gift yesterday.\"\n\n\"And how much did they possess?\"\n\n\"Oh, not much--from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs. But to\nreturn to our millions.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Danglars, in the most natural tone in the world. \"Are\nyou then pressed for this money?\"\n\n\"Yes; for the examination of our cash takes place to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow? Why did you not tell me so before? Why, it is as good as a\ncentury! At what hour does the examination take place?\"\n\n\"At two o'clock.\"\n\n\"Send at twelve,\" said Danglars, smiling. M. de Boville said nothing,\nbut nodded his head, and took up the portfolio. \"Now I think of it, you\ncan do better,\" said Danglars.\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"The receipt of M. de Monte Cristo is as good as money; take it to\nRothschild's or Lafitte's, and they will take it off your hands at\nonce.\"\n\n\"What, though payable at Rome?\"\n\n\"Certainly; it will only cost you a discount of 5,000 or 6,000 francs.\"\nThe receiver started back. \"Ma foi,\" he said, \"I prefer waiting till\nto-morrow. What a proposition!\"\n\n\"I thought, perhaps,\" said Danglars with supreme impertinence, \"that you\nhad a deficiency to make up?\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said the receiver.\n\n\"And if that were the case it would be worth while to make some\nsacrifice.\"\n\n\"Thank you, no, sir.\"\n\n\"Then it will be to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Yes; but without fail.\"\n\n\"Ah, you are laughing at me; send to-morrow at twelve, and the bank\nshall be notified.\"\n\n\"I will come myself.\"\n\n\"Better still, since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you.\" They\nshook hands. \"By the way,\" said M. de Boville, \"are you not going to the\nfuneral of poor Mademoiselle de Villefort, which I met on my road here?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the banker; \"I have appeared rather ridiculous since that\naffair of Benedetto, so I remain in the background.\"\n\n\"Bah, you are wrong. How were you to blame in that affair?\"\n\n\"Listen--when one bears an irreproachable name, as I do, one is rather\nsensitive.\"\n\n\"Everybody pities you, sir; and, above all, Mademoiselle Danglars!\"\n\n\"Poor Eugenie!\" said Danglars; \"do you know she is going to embrace a\nreligious life?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Alas, it is unhappily but too true. The day after the event, she\ndecided on leaving Paris with a nun of her acquaintance; they are gone\nto seek a very strict convent in Italy or Spain.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is terrible!\" and M. de Boville retired with this exclamation,\nafter expressing acute sympathy with the father. But he had scarcely\nleft before Danglars, with an energy of action those can alone\nunderstand who have seen Robert Macaire represented by Frederic, [*]\nexclaimed,--\"Fool!\" Then enclosing Monte Cristo's receipt in a little\npocket-book, he added:--\"Yes, come at twelve o'clock; I shall then be\nfar away.\" Then he double-locked his door, emptied all his drawers,\ncollected about fifty thousand francs in bank-notes, burned several\npapers, left others exposed to view, and then commenced writing a letter\nwhich he addressed:\n\n\"To Madame la Baronne Danglars.\"\n\n     * Frederic Lemaitre--French actor (1800-1876). Robert\n     Macaire is the hero of two favorite melodramas--\"Chien de\n     Montargis\" and \"Chien d'Aubry\"--and the name is applied to\n     bold criminals as a term of derision.\n\n\"I will place it on her table myself to-night,\" he murmured. Then taking\na passport from his drawer he said,--\"Good, it is available for two\nmonths longer.\"\n\n\n\nChapter 105. The Cemetery of Pere-la-Chaise.\n\nM. de Boville had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking\nValentine to her last home on earth. The weather was dull and stormy, a\ncold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the\ntrees, and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards.\nM. de Villefort, a true Parisian, considered the cemetery of\nPere-la-Chaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a\nParisian family; there alone the corpses belonging to him would be\nsurrounded by worthy associates. He had therefore purchased a vault,\nwhich was quickly occupied by members of his family. On the front of the\nmonument was inscribed: \"The families of Saint-Meran and Villefort,\" for\nsuch had been the last wish expressed by poor Renee, Valentine's mother.\nThe pompous procession therefore wended its way towards Pere-la-Chaise\nfrom the Faubourg Saint-Honore. Having crossed Paris, it passed through\nthe Faubourg du Temple, then leaving the exterior boulevards, it reached\nthe cemetery. More than fifty private carriages followed the twenty\nmourning-coaches, and behind them more than five hundred persons joined\nin the procession on foot.\n\nThese last consisted of all the young people whom Valentine's death had\nstruck like a thunderbolt, and who, notwithstanding the raw chilliness\nof the season, could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the\nmemory of the beautiful, chaste, and adorable girl, thus cut off in the\nflower of her youth. As they left Paris, an equipage with four horses,\nat full speed, was seen to draw up suddenly; it contained Monte Cristo.\nThe count left the carriage and mingled in the crowd who followed on\nfoot. Chateau-Renaud perceived him and immediately alighting from his\ncoupe, joined him.\n\nThe count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd; he was\nevidently watching for some one, but his search ended in disappointment.\n\"Where is Morrel?\" he asked; \"do either of these gentlemen know where he\nis?\"\n\n\"We have already asked that question,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"for none\nof us has seen him.\" The count was silent, but continued to gaze around\nhim. At length they arrived at the cemetery. The piercing eye of Monte\nCristo glanced through clusters of bushes and trees, and was soon\nrelieved from all anxiety, for seeing a shadow glide between the\nyew-trees, Monte Cristo recognized him whom he sought. One funeral is\ngenerally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis. Black\nfigures are seen scattered over the long white avenues; the silence\nof earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling\nbranches of hedges planted around the monuments; then follows the\nmelancholy chant of the priests, mingled now and then with a sob of\nanguish, escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers.\n\nThe shadow Monte Cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of\nAbelard and Heloise, placed itself close to the heads of the horses\nbelonging to the hearse, and following the undertaker's men, arrived\nwith them at the spot appointed for the burial. Each person's attention\nwas occupied. Monte Cristo saw nothing but the shadow, which no one else\nobserved. Twice the count left the ranks to see whether the object of\nhis interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes. When the\nprocession stopped, this shadow was recognized as Morrel, who, with\nhis coat buttoned up to his throat, his face livid, and convulsively\ncrushing his hat between his fingers, leaned against a tree, situated\non an elevation commanding the mausoleum, so that none of the funeral\ndetails could escape his observation. Everything was conducted in\nthe usual manner. A few men, the least impressed of all by the scene,\npronounced a discourse, some deploring this premature death, others\nexpatiating on the grief of the father, and one very ingenious person\nquoting the fact that Valentine had solicited pardon of her father for\ncriminals on whom the arm of justice was ready to fall--until at length\nthey exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches.\n\nMonte Cristo heard and saw nothing, or rather he only saw Morrel, whose\ncalmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in\nhis heart. \"See,\" said Beauchamp, pointing out Morrel to Debray. \"What\nis he doing up there?\" And they called Chateau-Renaud's attention to\nhim.\n\n\"How pale he is!\" said Chateau-Renaud, shuddering.\n\n\"He is cold,\" said Debray.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Chateau-Renaud, slowly; \"I think he is violently\nagitated. He is very susceptible.\"\n\n\"Bah,\" said Debray; \"he scarcely knew Mademoiselle de Villefort; you\nsaid so yourself.\"\n\n\"True. Still I remember he danced three times with her at Madame de\nMorcerf's. Do you recollect that ball, count, where you produced such an\neffect?\"\n\n\"No, I do not,\" replied Monte Cristo, without even knowing of what or\nto whom he was speaking, so much was he occupied in watching Morrel, who\nwas holding his breath with emotion. \"The discourse is over; farewell,\ngentlemen,\" said the count. And he disappeared without anyone seeing\nwhither he went. The funeral being over, the guests returned to Paris.\nChateau-Renaud looked for a moment for Morrel; but while they were\nwatching the departure of the count, Morrel had quitted his post, and\nChateau-Renaud, failing in his search, joined Debray and Beauchamp.\n\nMonte Cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the\narrival of Morrel, who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned\nby spectators and workmen. Morrel threw a glance around, but before it\nreached the spot occupied by Monte Cristo the latter had advanced yet\nnearer, still unperceived. The young man knelt down. The count, with\noutstretched neck and glaring eyes, stood in an attitude ready to\npounce upon Morrel upon the first occasion. Morrel bent his head till\nit touched the stone, then clutching the grating with both hands,\nhe murmured,--\"Oh, Valentine!\" The count's heart was pierced by the\nutterance of these two words; he stepped forward, and touching the young\nman's shoulder, said,--\"I was looking for you, my friend.\" Monte Cristo\nexpected a burst of passion, but he was deceived, for Morrel turning\nround, said calmly,--\n\n\"You see I was praying.\" The scrutinizing glance of the count searched\nthe young man from head to foot. He then seemed more easy.\n\n\"Shall I drive you back to Paris?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, thank you.\"\n\n\"Do you wish anything?\"\n\n\"Leave me to pray.\" The count withdrew without opposition, but it was\nonly to place himself in a situation where he could watch every movement\nof Morrel, who at length arose, brushed the dust from his knees, and\nturned towards Paris, without once looking back. He walked slowly down\nthe Rue de la Roquette. The count, dismissing his carriage, followed him\nabout a hundred paces behind. Maximilian crossed the canal and entered\nthe Rue Meslay by the boulevards. Five minutes after the door had been\nclosed on Morrel's entrance, it was again opened for the count. Julie\nwas at the entrance of the garden, where she was attentively watching\nPenelon, who, entering with zeal into his profession of gardener, was\nvery busy grafting some Bengal roses. \"Ah, count,\" she exclaimed, with\nthe delight manifested by every member of the family whenever he visited\nthe Rue Meslay.\n\n\"Maximilian has just returned, has he not, madame?\" asked the count.\n\n\"Yes, I think I saw him pass; but pray, call Emmanuel.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, madame, but I must go up to Maximilian's room this instant,\"\nreplied Monte Cristo, \"I have something of the greatest importance to\ntell him.\"\n\n\"Go, then,\" she said with a charming smile, which accompanied him until\nhe had disappeared. Monte Cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting\nfrom the ground-floor to Maximilian's room; when he reached the landing\nhe listened attentively, but all was still. Like many old houses\noccupied by a single family, the room door was panelled with glass; but\nit was locked, Maximilian was shut in, and it was impossible to see\nwhat was passing in the room, because a red curtain was drawn before the\nglass. The count's anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom\nappeared on the face of that imperturbable man.\n\n\"What shall I do!\" he uttered, and reflected for a moment; \"shall I\nring? No, the sound of a bell, announcing a visitor, will but accelerate\nthe resolution of one in Maximilian's situation, and then the bell would\nbe followed by a louder noise.\" Monte Cristo trembled from head to\nfoot and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of\nlightning, he struck one of the panes of glass with his elbow; the glass\nwas shivered to atoms, then withdrawing the curtain he saw Morrel, who\nhad been writing at his desk, bound from his seat at the noise of the\nbroken window.\n\n\"I beg a thousand pardons,\" said the count, \"there is nothing the\nmatter, but I slipped down and broke one of your panes of glass with\nmy elbow. Since it is opened, I will take advantage of it to enter your\nroom; do not disturb yourself--do not disturb yourself!\" And passing\nhis hand through the broken glass, the count opened the door. Morrel,\nevidently discomposed, came to meet Monte Cristo less with the intention\nof receiving him than to exclude his entry. \"Ma foi,\" said Monte Cristo,\nrubbing his elbow, \"it's all your servant's fault; your stairs are so\npolished, it is like walking on glass.\"\n\n\"Are you hurt, sir?\" coldly asked Morrel.\n\n\"I believe not. But what are you about there? You were writing.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Your fingers are stained with ink.\"\n\n\"Ah, true, I was writing. I do sometimes, soldier though I am.\"\n\nMonte Cristo advanced into the room; Maximilian was obliged to let him\npass, but he followed him. \"You were writing?\" said Monte Cristo with a\nsearching look.\n\n\"I have already had the honor of telling you I was,\" said Morrel.\n\nThe count looked around him. \"Your pistols are beside your desk,\" said\nMonte Cristo, pointing with his finger to the pistols on the table.\n\n\"I am on the point of starting on a journey,\" replied Morrel\ndisdainfully.\n\n\"My friend,\" exclaimed Monte Cristo in a tone of exquisite sweetness.\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"My friend, my dear Maximilian, do not make a hasty resolution, I\nentreat you.\"\n\n\"I make a hasty resolution?\" said Morrel, shrugging his shoulders; \"is\nthere anything extraordinary in a journey?\"\n\n\"Maximilian,\" said the count, \"let us both lay aside the mask we have\nassumed. You no more deceive me with that false calmness than I impose\nupon you with my frivolous solicitude. You can understand, can you not,\nthat to have acted as I have done, to have broken that glass, to have\nintruded on the solitude of a friend--you can understand that, to have\ndone all this, I must have been actuated by real uneasiness, or rather\nby a terrible conviction. Morrel, you are going to destroy yourself!\"\n\n\"Indeed, count,\" said Morrel, shuddering; \"what has put this into your\nhead?\"\n\n\"I tell you that you are about to destroy yourself,\" continued the\ncount, \"and here is proof of what I say;\" and, approaching the desk, he\nremoved the sheet of paper which Morrel had placed over the letter he\nhad begun, and took the latter in his hands.\n\nMorrel rushed forward to tear it from him, but Monte Cristo perceiving\nhis intention, seized his wrist with his iron grasp. \"You wish to\ndestroy yourself,\" said the count; \"you have written it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Morrel, changing his expression of calmness for one of\nviolence--\"well, and if I do intend to turn this pistol against myself,\nwho shall prevent me--who will dare prevent me? All my hopes are\nblighted, my heart is broken, my life a burden, everything around me is\nsad and mournful; earth has become distasteful to me, and human voices\ndistract me. It is a mercy to let me die, for if I live I shall lose\nmy reason and become mad. When, sir, I tell you all this with tears of\nheartfelt anguish, can you reply that I am wrong, can you prevent my\nputting an end to my miserable existence? Tell me, sir, could you have\nthe courage to do so?\"\n\n\"Yes, Morrel,\" said Monte Cristo, with a calmness which contrasted\nstrangely with the young man's excitement; \"yes, I would do so.\"\n\n\"You?\" exclaimed Morrel, with increasing anger and reproach--\"you, who\nhave deceived me with false hopes, who have cheered and soothed me with\nvain promises, when I might, if not have saved her, at least have seen\nher die in my arms! You, who pretend to understand everything, even the\nhidden sources of knowledge,--and who enact the part of a guardian angel\nupon earth, and could not even find an antidote to a poison administered\nto a young girl! Ah, sir, indeed you would inspire me with pity, were\nyou not hateful in my eyes.\"\n\n\"Morrel\"--\n\n\"Yes; you tell me to lay aside the mask, and I will do so, be satisfied!\nWhen you spoke to me at the cemetery, I answered you--my heart was\nsoftened; when you arrived here, I allowed you to enter. But since\nyou abuse my confidence, since you have devised a new torture after\nI thought I had exhausted them all, then, Count of Monte Cristo my\npretended benefactor--then, Count of Monte Cristo, the universal\nguardian, be satisfied, you shall witness the death of your friend;\" and\nMorrel, with a maniacal laugh, again rushed towards the pistols.\n\n\"And I again repeat, you shall not commit suicide.\"\n\n\"Prevent me, then!\" replied Morrel, with another struggle, which, like\nthe first, failed in releasing him from the count's iron grasp.\n\n\"I will prevent you.\"\n\n\"And who are you, then, that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical right\nover free and rational beings?\"\n\n\"Who am I?\" repeated Monte Cristo. \"Listen; I am the only man in the\nworld having the right to say to you, 'Morrel, your father's son shall\nnot die to-day;'\" and Monte Cristo, with an expression of majesty\nand sublimity, advanced with arms folded toward the young man, who,\ninvoluntarily overcome by the commanding manner of this man, recoiled a\nstep.\n\n\"Why do you mention my father?\" stammered he; \"why do you mingle a\nrecollection of him with the affairs of today?\"\n\n\"Because I am he who saved your father's life when he wished to destroy\nhimself, as you do to-day--because I am the man who sent the purse\nto your young sister, and the Pharaon to old Morrel--because I am the\nEdmond Dantes who nursed you, a child, on my knees.\" Morrel made another\nstep back, staggering, breathless, crushed; then all his strength\ngive way, and he fell prostrate at the feet of Monte Cristo. Then his\nadmirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion; he arose,\nrushed out of the room and to the stairs, exclaiming energetically,\n\"Julie, Julie--Emmanuel, Emmanuel!\"\n\nMonte Cristo endeavored also to leave, but Maximilian would have died\nrather than relax his hold of the handle of the door, which he closed\nupon the count. Julie, Emmanuel, and some of the servants, ran up in\nalarm on hearing the cries of Maximilian. Morrel seized their hands,\nand opening the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs, \"On your\nknees--on your knees--he is our benefactor--the saviour of our father!\nHe is\"--\n\nHe would have added \"Edmond Dantes,\" but the count seized his arm and\nprevented him. Julie threw herself into the arms of the count; Emmanuel\nembraced him as a guardian angel; Morrel again fell on his knees, and\nstruck the ground with his forehead. Then the iron-hearted man felt his\nheart swell in his breast; a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his\neyes, he bent his head and wept. For a while nothing was heard in the\nroom but a succession of sobs, while the incense from their grateful\nhearts mounted to heaven. Julie had scarcely recovered from her deep\nemotion when she rushed out of the room, descended to the next floor,\nran into the drawing-room with childlike joy and raised the crystal\nglobe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the Allees de\nMeillan. Meanwhile, Emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count,\n\"Oh, count, how could you, hearing us so often speak of our unknown\nbenefactor, seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his\nmemory,--how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to\nus? Oh, it was cruel to us, and--dare I say it?--to you also.\"\n\n\"Listen, my friends,\" said the count--\"I may call you so since we have\nreally been friends for the last eleven years--the discovery of this\nsecret has been occasioned by a great event which you must never know.\nI wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom, but your brother\nMaximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now, I am\nsure.\" Then turning around, and seeing that Morrel, still on his knees,\nhad thrown himself into an arm-chair, he added in a low voice, pressing\nEmmanuel's hand significantly, \"Watch over him.\"\n\n\"Why so?\" asked the young man, surprised.\n\n\"I cannot explain myself; but watch over him.\" Emmanuel looked around\nthe room and caught sight of the pistols; his eyes rested on the\nweapons, and he pointed to them. Monte Cristo bent his head. Emmanuel\nwent towards the pistols. \"Leave them,\" said Monte Cristo. Then walking\ntowards Morrel, he took his hand; the tumultuous agitation of the young\nman was succeeded by a profound stupor. Julie returned, holding the\nsilken purse in her hands, while tears of joy rolled down her cheeks,\nlike dewdrops on the rose.\n\n\"Here is the relic,\" she said; \"do not think it will be less dear to us\nnow we are acquainted with our benefactor!\"\n\n\"My child,\" said Monte Cristo, coloring, \"allow me to take back that\npurse? Since you now know my face, I wish to be remembered alone through\nthe affection I hope you will grant me.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Julie, pressing the purse to her heart, \"no, no, I beseech\nyou do not take it, for some unhappy day you will leave us, will you\nnot?\"\n\n\"You have guessed rightly, madame,\" replied Monte Cristo, smiling; \"in a\nweek I shall have left this country, where so many persons who merit the\nvengeance of heaven lived happily, while my father perished of hunger\nand grief.\" While announcing his departure, the count fixed his eyes on\nMorrel, and remarked that the words, \"I shall have left this country,\"\nhad failed to rouse him from his lethargy. He then saw that he must make\nanother struggle against the grief of his friend, and taking the hands\nof Emmanuel and Julie, which he pressed within his own, he said with\nthe mild authority of a father, \"My kind friends, leave me alone with\nMaximilian.\" Julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious\nrelic, which Monte Cristo had forgotten. She drew her husband to the\ndoor. \"Let us leave them,\" she said. The count was alone with Morrel,\nwho remained motionless as a statue.\n\n\"Come,\" said Monte-Cristo, touching his shoulder with his finger, \"are\nyou a man again, Maximilian?\"\n\n\"Yes; for I begin to suffer again.\"\n\nThe count frowned, apparently in gloomy hesitation.\n\n\"Maximilian, Maximilian,\" he said, \"the ideas you yield to are unworthy\nof a Christian.\"\n\n\"Oh, do not fear, my friend,\" said Morrel, raising his head, and smiling\nwith a sweet expression on the count; \"I shall no longer attempt my\nlife.\"\n\n\"Then we are to have no more pistols--no more despair?\"\n\n\"No; I have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet or a\nknife.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow, what is it?\"\n\n\"My grief will kill me of itself.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Monte Cristo, with an expression of melancholy equal\nto his own, \"listen to me. One day, in a moment of despair like yours,\nsince it led to a similar resolution, I also wished to kill myself; one\nday your father, equally desperate, wished to kill himself too. If any\none had said to your father, at the moment he raised the pistol to his\nhead--if any one had told me, when in my prison I pushed back the food I\nhad not tasted for three days--if anyone had said to either of us\nthen, 'Live--the day will come when you will be happy, and will bless\nlife!'--no matter whose voice had spoken, we should have heard him with\nthe smile of doubt, or the anguish of incredulity,--and yet how many\ntimes has your father blessed life while embracing you--how often have I\nmyself\"--\n\n\"Ah,\" exclaimed Morrel, interrupting the count, \"you had only lost\nyour liberty, my father had only lost his fortune, but I have lost\nValentine.\"\n\n\"Look at me,\" said Monte Cristo, with that expression which sometimes\nmade him so eloquent and persuasive--\"look at me. There are no tears\nin my eyes, nor is there fever in my veins, yet I see you suffer--you,\nMaximilian, whom I love as my own son. Well, does not this tell you\nthat in grief, as in life, there is always something to look forward to\nbeyond? Now, if I entreat, if I order you to live, Morrel, it is in\nthe conviction that one day you will thank me for having preserved your\nlife.\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens,\" said the young man, \"oh, heavens--what are you saying,\ncount? Take care. But perhaps you have never loved!\"\n\n\"Child!\" replied the count.\n\n\"I mean, as I love. You see, I have been a soldier ever since I attained\nmanhood. I reached the age of twenty-nine without loving, for none of\nthe feelings I before then experienced merit the appellation of love.\nWell, at twenty-nine I saw Valentine; for two years I have loved her,\nfor two years I have seen written in her heart, as in a book, all the\nvirtues of a daughter and wife. Count, to possess Valentine would have\nbeen a happiness too infinite, too ecstatic, too complete, too divine\nfor this world, since it has been denied me; but without Valentine the\nearth is desolate.\"\n\n\"I have told you to hope,\" said the count.\n\n\"Then have a care, I repeat, for you seek to persuade me, and if you\nsucceed I should lose my reason, for I should hope that I could again\nbehold Valentine.\" The count smiled. \"My friend, my father,\" said Morrel\nwith excitement, \"have a care, I again repeat, for the power you wield\nover me alarms me. Weigh your words before you speak, for my eyes have\nalready become brighter, and my heart beats strongly; be cautious, or\nyou will make me believe in supernatural agencies. I must obey you,\nthough you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the water.\"\n\n\"Hope, my friend,\" repeated the count.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Morrel, falling from the height of excitement to the abyss\nof despair--\"ah, you are playing with me, like those good, or rather\nselfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed words, because\ntheir screams annoy them. No, my friend, I was wrong to caution you; do\nnot fear, I will bury my grief so deep in my heart, I will disguise\nit so, that you shall not even care to sympathize with me. Adieu, my\nfriend, adieu!\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said the count, \"after this time you must live with\nme--you must not leave me, and in a week we shall have left France\nbehind us.\"\n\n\"And you still bid me hope?\"\n\n\"I tell you to hope, because I have a method of curing you.\"\n\n\"Count, you render me sadder than before, if it be possible. You think\nthe result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief, and\nyou would cure it by an ordinary remedy--change of scene.\" And Morrel\ndropped his head with disdainful incredulity. \"What can I say more?\"\nasked Monte Cristo. \"I have confidence in the remedy I propose, and only\nask you to permit me to assure you of its efficacy.\"\n\n\"Count, you prolong my agony.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the count, \"your feeble spirit will not even grant me the\ntrial I request? Come--do you know of what the Count of Monte Cristo is\ncapable? do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control?\nnay, that he can almost work a miracle? Well, wait for the miracle I\nhope to accomplish, or\"--\n\n\"Or?\" repeated Morrel.\n\n\"Or, take care, Morrel, lest I call you ungrateful.\"\n\n\"Have pity on me, count!\"\n\n\"I feel so much pity towards you, Maximilian, that--listen to me\nattentively--if I do not cure you in a month, to the day, to the very\nhour, mark my words, Morrel, I will place loaded pistols before you,\nand a cup of the deadliest Italian poison--a poison more sure and prompt\nthan that which has killed Valentine.\"\n\n\"Will you promise me?\"\n\n\"Yes; for I am a man, and have suffered like yourself, and also\ncontemplated suicide; indeed, often since misfortune has left me I have\nlonged for the delights of an eternal sleep.\"\n\n\"But you are sure you will promise me this?\" said Morrel, intoxicated.\n\"I not only promise, but swear it!\" said Monte Cristo extending his\nhand.\n\n\"In a month, then, on your honor, if I am not consoled, you will let\nme take my life into my own hands, and whatever may happen you will not\ncall me ungrateful?\"\n\n\"In a month, to the day, the very hour and the date are sacred,\nMaximilian. I do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of\nSeptember; it is ten years to-day since I saved your father's life, who\nwished to die.\" Morrel seized the count's hand and kissed it; the count\nallowed him to pay the homage he felt due to him. \"In a month you will\nfind on the table, at which we shall be then sitting, good pistols and\na delicious draught; but, on the other hand, you must promise me not to\nattempt your life before that time.\"\n\n\"Oh, I also swear it!\" Monte Cristo drew the young man towards him,\nand pressed him for some time to his heart. \"And now,\" he said,\n\"after to-day, you will come and live with me; you can occupy Haidee's\napartment, and my daughter will at least be replaced by my son.\"\n\n\"Haidee?\" said Morrel, \"what has become of her?\"\n\n\"She departed last night.\"\n\n\"To leave you?\"\n\n\"To wait for me. Hold yourself ready then to join me at the Champs\nElysees, and lead me out of this house without any one seeing my\ndeparture.\" Maximilian hung his head, and obeyed with childlike\nreverence.\n\n\n\nChapter 106. Dividing the Proceeds.\n\nThe apartment on the second floor of the house in the Rue\nSaint-Germain-des-Pres, where Albert de Morcerf had selected a home for\nhis mother, was let to a very mysterious person. This was a man whose\nface the concierge himself had never seen, for in the winter his chin\nwas buried in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen's\ncoachmen on a cold night, and in the summer he made a point of always\nblowing his nose just as he approached the door. Contrary to custom,\nthis gentleman had not been watched, for as the report ran that he was\na person of high rank, and one who would allow no impertinent\ninterference, his incognito was strictly respected.\n\nHis visits were tolerably regular, though occasionally he appeared\na little before or after his time, but generally, both in summer and\nwinter, he took possession of his apartment about four o'clock, though\nhe never spent the night there. At half-past three in the winter the\nfire was lighted by the discreet servant, who had the superintendence of\nthe little apartment, and in the summer ices were placed on the table\nat the same hour. At four o'clock, as we have already stated, the\nmysterious personage arrived. Twenty minutes afterwards a carriage\nstopped at the house, a lady alighted in a black or dark blue dress, and\nalways thickly veiled; she passed like a shadow through the lodge, and\nran up-stairs without a sound escaping under the touch of her light\nfoot. No one ever asked her where she was going. Her face, therefore,\nlike that of the gentleman, was perfectly unknown to the two concierges,\nwho were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion.\nWe need not say she stopped at the second floor. Then she tapped in a\npeculiar manner at a door, which after being opened to admit her was\nagain fastened, and curiosity penetrated no farther. They used the same\nprecautions in leaving as in entering the house. The lady always left\nfirst, and as soon as she had stepped into her carriage, it drove away,\nsometimes towards the right hand, sometimes to the left; then about\ntwenty minutes afterwards the gentleman would also leave, buried in his\ncravat or concealed by his handkerchief.\n\nThe day after Monte Cristo had called upon Danglars, the mysterious\nlodger entered at ten o'clock in the morning instead of four in the\nafternoon. Almost directly afterwards, without the usual interval of\ntime, a cab arrived, and the veiled lady ran hastily up-stairs. The\ndoor opened, but before it could be closed, the lady exclaimed: \"Oh,\nLucien--oh, my friend!\" The concierge therefore heard for the first time\nthat the lodger's name was Lucien; still, as he was the very perfection\nof a door-keeper, he made up his mind not to tell his wife. \"Well,\nwhat is the matter, my dear?\" asked the gentleman whose name the lady's\nagitation revealed; \"tell me what is the matter.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lucien, can I confide in you?\"\n\n\"Of course, you know you can do so. But what can be the matter?\nYour note of this morning has completely bewildered me. This\nprecipitation--this unusual appointment. Come, ease me of my anxiety, or\nelse frighten me at once.\"\n\n\"Lucien, a great event has happened!\" said the lady, glancing\ninquiringly at Lucien,--\"M. Danglars left last night!\"\n\n\"Left?--M. Danglars left? Where has he gone?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? Has he gone intending not to return?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly;--at ten o'clock at night his horses took him to the\nbarrier of Charenton; there a post-chaise was waiting for him--he\nentered it with his valet de chambre, saying that he was going to\nFontainebleau.\"\n\n\"Then what did you mean\"--\n\n\"Stay--he left a letter for me.\"\n\n\"A letter?\"\n\n\"Yes; read it.\" And the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she\ngave to Debray. Debray paused a moment before reading, as if trying\nto guess its contents, or perhaps while making up his mind how to act,\nwhatever it might contain. No doubt his ideas were arranged in a few\nminutes, for he began reading the letter which caused so much uneasiness\nin the heart of the baroness, and which ran as follows:--\n\n\"Madame and most faithful wife.\"\n\nDebray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness, whose face\nbecame covered with blushes. \"Read,\" she said.\n\nDebray continued:--\n\n\"When you receive this, you will no longer have a husband. Oh, you\nneed not be alarmed, you will only have lost him as you have lost your\ndaughter; I mean that I shall be travelling on one of the thirty or\nforty roads leading out of France. I owe you some explanations for my\nconduct, and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me, I will\ngive them. Listen, then. I received this morning five millions which I\npaid away; almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum\nwas presented to me; I put this creditor off till to-morrow and I intend\nleaving to-day, to escape that to-morrow, which would be rather too\nunpleasant for me to endure. You understand this, do you not, my most\nprecious wife? I say you understand this, because you are as conversant\nwith my affairs as I am; indeed, I think you understand them better,\nsince I am ignorant of what has become of a considerable portion of my\nfortune, once very tolerable, while I am sure, madame, that you know\nperfectly well. For women have infallible instincts; they can even\nexplain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented;\nbut I, who only understand my own figures, know nothing more than that\none day these figures deceived me. Have you admired the rapidity of my\nfall? Have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots?\nI confess I have seen nothing but the fire; let us hope you have found\nsome gold among the ashes. With this consoling idea, I leave you,\nmadame, and most prudent wife, without any conscientious reproach for\nabandoning you; you have friends left, and the ashes I have already\nmentioned, and above all the liberty I hasten to restore to you. And\nhere, madame, I must add another word of explanation. So long as I hoped\nyou were working for the good of our house and for the fortune of our\ndaughter, I philosophically closed my eyes; but as you have transformed\nthat house into a vast ruin I will not be the foundation of another\nman's fortune. You were rich when I married you, but little respected.\nExcuse me for speaking so very candidly, but as this is intended\nonly for ourselves, I do not see why I should weigh my words. I have\naugmented our fortune, and it has continued to increase during the\nlast fifteen years, till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes\nhave suddenly overturned it,--without any fault of mine, I can honestly\ndeclare. You, madame, have only sought to increase your own, and I am\nconvinced that you have succeeded. I leave you, therefore, as I took\nyou,--rich, but little respected. Adieu! I also intend from this time\nto work on my own account. Accept my acknowledgments for the example you\nhave set me, and which I intend following.\n\n\"Your very devoted husband,\n\n\"Baron Danglars.\"\n\nThe baroness had watched Debray while he read this long and painful\nletter, and saw him, notwithstanding his self-control, change color\nonce or twice. When he had ended the perusal, he folded the letter and\nresumed his pensive attitude. \"Well?\" asked Madame Danglars, with an\nanxiety easy to be understood.\n\n\"Well, madame?\" unhesitatingly repeated Debray.\n\n\"With what ideas does that letter inspire you?\"\n\n\"Oh, it is simple enough, madame; it inspires me with the idea that M.\nDanglars has left suspiciously.\"\n\n\"Certainly; but is this all you have to say to me?\"\n\n\"I do not understand you,\" said Debray with freezing coldness.\n\n\"He is gone! Gone, never to return!\"\n\n\"Oh, madame, do not think that!\"\n\n\"I tell you he will never return. I know his character; he is inflexible\nin any resolutions formed for his own interests. If he could have made\nany use of me, he would have taken me with him; he leaves me in Paris,\nas our separation will conduce to his benefit;--therefore he has gone,\nand I am free forever,\" added Madame Danglars, in the same supplicating\ntone. Debray, instead of answering, allowed her to remain in an attitude\nof nervous inquiry. \"Well?\" she said at length, \"do you not answer me?\"\n\n\"I have but one question to ask you,--what do you intend to do?\"\n\n\"I was going to ask you,\" replied the baroness with a beating heart.\n\n\"Ah, then, you wish to ask advice of me?\"\n\n\"Yes; I do wish to ask your advice,\" said Madame Danglars with anxious\nexpectation.\n\n\"Then if you wish to take my advice,\" said the young man coldly, \"I\nwould recommend you to travel.\"\n\n\"To travel!\" she murmured.\n\n\"Certainly; as M. Danglars says, you are rich, and perfectly free. In\nmy opinion, a withdrawal from Paris is absolutely necessary after the\ndouble catastrophe of Mademoiselle Danglars' broken contract and M.\nDanglars' disappearance. The world will think you abandoned and poor,\nfor the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven, were she to keep up\nan appearance of opulence. You have only to remain in Paris for about a\nfortnight, telling the world you are abandoned, and relating the details\nof this desertion to your best friends, who will soon spread the report.\nThen you can quit your house, leaving your jewels and giving up your\njointure, and every one's mouth will be filled with praises of your\ndisinterestedness. They will know you are deserted, and think you also\npoor, for I alone know your real financial position, and am quite ready\nto give up my accounts as an honest partner.\" The dread with which the\npale and motionless baroness listened to this, was equalled by the calm\nindifference with which Debray had spoken. \"Deserted?\" she repeated;\n\"ah, yes, I am, indeed, deserted! You are right, sir, and no one can\ndoubt my position.\" These were the only words that this proud and\nviolently enamoured woman could utter in response to Debray.\n\n\"But then you are rich,--very rich, indeed,\" continued Debray, taking\nout some papers from his pocket-book, which he spread upon the table.\nMadame Danglars did not see them; she was engaged in stilling the\nbeatings of her heart, and restraining the tears which were ready to\ngush forth. At length a sense of dignity prevailed, and if she did not\nentirely master her agitation, she at least succeeded in preventing the\nfall of a single tear. \"Madame,\" said Debray, \"it is nearly six months\nsince we have been associated. You furnished a principal of 100,000\nfrancs. Our partnership began in the month of April. In May we commenced\noperations, and in the course of the month gained 450,000 francs.\nIn June the profit amounted to 900,000. In July we added 1,700,000\nfrancs,--it was, you know, the month of the Spanish bonds. In August we\nlost 300,000 francs at the beginning of the month, but on the 13th we\nmade up for it, and we now find that our accounts, reckoning from the\nfirst day of partnership up to yesterday, when I closed them, showed\na capital of 2,400,000 francs, that is, 1,200,000 for each of us. Now,\nmadame,\" said Debray, delivering up his accounts in the methodical\nmanner of a stockbroker, \"there are still 80,000 francs, the interest of\nthis money, in my hands.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the baroness, \"I thought you never put the money out to\ninterest.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, madame,\" said Debray coldly, \"I had your permission to do\nso, and I have made use of it. There are, then, 40,000 francs for your\nshare, besides the 100,000 you furnished me to begin with, making in all\n1,340,000 francs for your portion. Now, madame, I took the precaution of\ndrawing out your money the day before yesterday; it is not long ago, you\nsee, and I was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up\nmy accounts. There is your money,--half in bank-notes, the other half\nin checks payable to bearer. I say there, for as I did not consider\nmy house safe enough, or lawyers sufficiently discreet, and as landed\nproperty carries evidence with it, and moreover since you have no right\nto possess anything independent of your husband, I have kept this sum,\nnow your whole fortune, in a chest concealed under that closet, and for\ngreater security I myself concealed it there.\n\n\"Now, madame,\" continued Debray, first opening the closet, then\nthe chest;--\"now, madame, here are 800 notes of 1,000. francs each,\nresembling, as you see, a large book bound in iron; to this I add a\ncertificate in the funds of 25,000. francs; then, for the odd cash,\nmaking I think about 110,000. francs, here is a check upon my banker,\nwho, not being M. Danglars, will pay you the amount, you may rest\nassured.\" Madame Danglars mechanically took the check, the bond, and the\nheap of bank-notes. This enormous fortune made no great appearance on\nthe table. Madame Danglars, with tearless eyes, but with her breast\nheaving with concealed emotion, placed the bank-notes in her bag, put\nthe certificate and check into her pocket-book, and then, standing pale\nand mute, awaited one kind word of consolation. But she waited in vain.\n\n\"Now, madame,\" said Debray, \"you have a splendid fortune, an income of\nabout 60,000 livres a year, which is enormous for a woman who cannot\nkeep an establishment here for a year, at least. You will be able\nto indulge all your fancies; besides, should you find your income\ninsufficient, you can, for the sake of the past, madame, make use of\nmine; and I am ready to offer you all I possess, on loan.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir--thank you,\" replied the baroness; \"you forget that\nwhat you have just paid me is much more than a poor woman requires, who\nintends for some time, at least, to retire from the world.\"\n\nDebray was, for a moment, surprised, but immediately recovering himself,\nhe bowed with an air which seemed to say, \"As you please, madame.\"\n\nMadame Danglars had until then, perhaps, hoped for something; but when\nshe saw the careless bow of Debray, and the glance by which it was\naccompanied, together with his significant silence, she raised her head,\nand without passion or violence or even hesitation, ran down-stairs,\ndisdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from\nher. \"Bah,\" said Debray, when she had left, \"these are fine projects!\nShe will remain at home, read novels, and speculate at cards, since she\ncan no longer do so on the Bourse.\" Then taking up his account book, he\ncancelled with the greatest care all the entries of the amounts he had\njust paid away. \"I have 1,060,000 francs remaining,\" he said. \"What a\npity Mademoiselle de Villefort is dead! She suited me in every respect,\nand I would have married her.\" And he calmly waited until the twenty\nminutes had elapsed after Madame Danglars' departure before he left the\nhouse. During this time he occupied himself in making figures, with his\nwatch by his side.\n\nAsmodeus--that diabolical personage, who would have been created by\nevery fertile imagination if Le Sage had not acquired the priority in\nhis great masterpiece--would have enjoyed a singular spectacle, if\nhe had lifted up the roof of the little house in the Rue\nSaint-Germain-des-Pres, while Debray was casting up his figures. Above\nthe room in which Debray had been dividing two millions and a half with\nMadame Danglars was another, inhabited by persons who have played too\nprominent a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance\nnot to create some interest. Mercedes and Albert were in that room.\nMercedes was much changed within the last few days; not that even in her\ndays of fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which\nmakes us no longer able to recognize a woman when she appears in a\nplain and simple attire; nor indeed, had she fallen into that state of\ndepression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery; no,\nthe change in Mercedes was that her eye no longer sparkled, her lips\nno longer smiled, and there was now a hesitation in uttering the words\nwhich formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit.\n\nIt was not poverty which had broken her spirit; it was not a want\nof courage which rendered her poverty burdensome. Mercedes, although\ndeposed from the exalted position she had occupied, lost in the sphere\nshe had now chosen, like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted\ninto utter darkness, appeared like a queen, fallen from her palace to\na hovel, and who, reduced to strict necessity, could neither become\nreconciled to the earthen vessels she was herself forced to place\nupon the table, nor to the humble pallet which had become her bed. The\nbeautiful Catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and\ncharming smile, because she saw nothing but misery around her; the walls\nwere hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose\nas not likely to show the dirt; the floor was uncarpeted; the furniture\nattracted the attention to the poor attempt at luxury; indeed,\neverything offended eyes accustomed to refinement and elegance.\n\nMadame de Morcerf had lived there since leaving her house; the continual\nsilence of the spot oppressed her; still, seeing that Albert continually\nwatched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings, she\nconstrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone,\nwhich, contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually\nshone from her eyes, seemed like \"moonlight on a statue,\"--yielding\nlight without warmth. Albert, too, was ill at ease; the remains of\nluxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position. If he wished\nto go out without gloves, his hands appeared too white; if he wished to\nwalk through the town, his boots seemed too highly polished. Yet these\ntwo noble and intelligent creatures, united by the indissoluble ties\nof maternal and filial love, had succeeded in tacitly understanding one\nanother, and economizing their stores, and Albert had been able to tell\nhis mother without extorting a change of countenance,--\"Mother, we have\nno more money.\"\n\nMercedes had never known misery; she had often, in her youth, spoken of\npoverty, but between want and necessity, those synonymous words, there\nis a wide difference. Amongst the Catalans, Mercedes wished for a\nthousand things, but still she never really wanted any. So long as the\nnets were good, they caught fish; and so long as they sold their fish,\nthey were able to buy twine for new nets. And then, shut out from\nfriendship, having but one affection, which could not be mixed up with\nher ordinary pursuits, she thought of herself--of no one but herself.\nUpon the little she earned she lived as well as she could; now there\nwere two to be supported, and nothing to live upon.\n\nWinter approached. Mercedes had no fire in that cold and naked\nroom--she, who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from\nthe hall to the boudoir; she had not even one little flower--she whose\napartment had been a conservatory of costly exotics. But she had her\nson. Hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them.\nExcitement, like enthusiasm, sometimes renders us unconscious to the\nthings of earth. But the excitement had calmed down, and they felt\nthemselves obliged to descend from dreams to reality; after having\nexhausted the ideal, they found they must talk of the actual.\n\n\"Mother,\" exclaimed Albert, just as Madame Danglars was descending the\nstairs, \"let us reckon our riches, if you please; I want capital to\nbuild my plans upon.\"\n\n\"Capital--nothing!\" replied Mercedes with a mournful smile.\n\n\"No, mother,--capital 3,000 francs. And I have an idea of our leading a\ndelightful life upon this 3,000 francs.\"\n\n\"Child!\" sighed Mercedes.\n\n\"Alas, dear mother,\" said the young man, \"I have unhappily spent too\nmuch of your money not to know the value of it. These 3,000 francs\nare enormous, and I intend building upon this foundation a miraculous\ncertainty for the future.\"\n\n\"You say this, my dear boy; but do you think we ought to accept these\n3,000 francs?\" said Mercedes, coloring.\n\n\"I think so,\" answered Albert in a firm tone. \"We will accept them the\nmore readily, since we have them not here; you know they are buried in\nthe garden of the little house in the Allees de Meillan, at Marseilles.\nWith 200 francs we can reach Marseilles.\"\n\n\"With 200 francs?--are you sure, Albert?\"\n\n\"Oh, as for that, I have made inquiries respecting the diligences and\nsteamboats, and my calculations are made. You will take your place\nin the coupe to Chalons. You see, mother, I treat you handsomely for\nthirty-five francs.\" Albert then took a pen, and wrote:--\n\n                                                         Frs.\n  Coupe, thirty-five francs.............................. 35.\n  From Chalons to Lyons you will go on by the steamboat..  6.\n  From Lyons to Avignon (still by steamboat)............. 16.\n  From Avignon to Marseilles, seven francs...............  7.\n  Expenses on the road, about fifty francs............... 50.\n  Total................................................. 114 frs.\n\n\"Let us put down 120,\" added Albert, smiling. \"You see I am generous, am\nI not, mother?\"\n\n\"But you, my poor child?\"\n\n\"I? do you not see that I reserve eighty francs for myself? A young man\ndoes not require luxuries; besides, I know what travelling is.\"\n\n\"With a post-chaise and valet de chambre?\"\n\n\"Any way, mother.\"\n\n\"Well, be it so. But these 200 francs?\"\n\n\"Here they are, and 200 more besides. See, I have sold my watch for\n100 francs, and the guard and seals for 300. How fortunate that the\nornaments were worth more than the watch. Still the same story of\nsuperfluities! Now I think we are rich, since instead of the 114 francs\nwe require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of 250.\"\n\n\"But we owe something in this house?\"\n\n\"Thirty francs; but I pay that out of my 150 francs,--that is\nunderstood,--and as I require only eighty francs for my journey, you see\nI am overwhelmed with luxury. But that is not all. What do you say to\nthis, mother?\"\n\nAnd Albert took out of a little pocket-book with golden clasps, a\nremnant of his old fancies, or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of\nthe mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little\ndoor,--Albert took out of this pocket-book a note of 1,000 francs.\n\n\"What is this?\" asked Mercedes.\n\n\"A thousand francs.\"\n\n\"But whence have you obtained them?\"\n\n\"Listen to me, mother, and do not yield too much to agitation.\" And\nAlbert, rising, kissed his mother on both cheeks, then stood looking at\nher. \"You cannot imagine, mother, how beautiful I think you!\" said the\nyoung man, impressed with a profound feeling of filial love. \"You are,\nindeed, the most beautiful and most noble woman I ever saw!\"\n\n\"Dear child!\" said Mercedes, endeavoring in vain to restrain a tear\nwhich glistened in the corner of her eye. \"Indeed, you only wanted\nmisfortune to change my love for you to admiration. I am not unhappy\nwhile I possess my son!\"\n\n\"Ah, just so,\" said Albert; \"here begins the trial. Do you know the\ndecision we have come to, mother?\"\n\n\"Have we come to any?\"\n\n\"Yes; it is decided that you are to live at Marseilles, and that I am to\nleave for Africa, where I will earn for myself the right to use the name\nI now bear, instead of the one I have thrown aside.\" Mercedes sighed.\n\"Well, mother, I yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the Spahis,\"\n[*] added the young man, lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of\nshame, for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his self-\nabasement. \"I thought my body was my own, and that I might sell it. I\nyesterday took the place of another. I sold myself for more than I\nthought I was worth,\" he added, attempting to smile; \"I fetched 2,000\nfrancs.\"\n\n     * The Spahis are French cavalry reserved for service in\n     Africa.\n\n\"Then these 1,000 francs\"--said Mercedes, shuddering--\n\n\"Are the half of the sum, mother; the other will be paid in a year.\"\n\nMercedes raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be\nimpossible to describe, and tears, which had hitherto been restrained,\nnow yielded to her emotion, and ran down her cheeks.\n\n\"The price of his blood!\" she murmured.\n\n\"Yes, if I am killed,\" said Albert, laughing. \"But I assure you, mother,\nI have a strong intention of defending my person, and I never felt half\nso strong an inclination to live as I do now.\"\n\n\"Merciful heavens!\"\n\n\"Besides, mother, why should you make up your mind that I am to be\nkilled? Has Lamoriciere, that Ney of the South, been killed? Has\nChangarnier been killed? Has Bedeau been killed? Has Morrel, whom we\nknow, been killed? Think of your joy, mother, when you see me return\nwith an embroidered uniform! I declare, I expect to look magnificent\nin it, and chose that regiment only from vanity.\" Mercedes sighed while\nendeavoring to smile; the devoted mother felt that she ought not to\nallow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her son. \"Well,\nnow you understand, mother!\" continued Albert; \"here are more than 4,000\nfrancs settled on you; upon these you can live at least two years.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said Mercedes. These words were uttered in so\nmournful a tone that their real meaning did not escape Albert; he felt\nhis heart beat, and taking his mother's hand within his own he said,\ntenderly,--\n\n\"Yes, you will live!\"\n\n\"I shall live!--then you will not leave me, Albert?\"\n\n\"Mother, I must go,\" said Albert in a firm, calm voice; \"you love me\ntoo well to wish me to remain useless and idle with you; besides, I have\nsigned.\"\n\n\"You will obey your own wish and the will of heaven!\"\n\n\"Not my own wish, mother, but reason--necessity. Are we not two\ndespairing creatures? What is life to you?--Nothing. What is life to\nme?--Very little without you, mother; for believe me, but for you I\nshould have ceased to live on the day I doubted my father and renounced\nhis name. Well, I will live, if you promise me still to hope; and if\nyou grant me the care of your future prospects, you will redouble my\nstrength. Then I will go to the governor of Algeria; he has a royal\nheart, and is essentially a soldier; I will tell him my gloomy story.\nI will beg him to turn his eyes now and then towards me, and if he\nkeep his word and interest himself for me, in six months I shall be an\nofficer, or dead. If I am an officer, your fortune is certain, for I\nshall have money enough for both, and, moreover, a name we shall both\nbe proud of, since it will be our own. If I am killed--well then mother,\nyou can also die, and there will be an end of our misfortunes.\"\n\n\"It is well,\" replied Mercedes, with her eloquent glance; \"you are\nright, my love; let us prove to those who are watching our actions that\nwe are worthy of compassion.\"\n\n\"But let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions,\" said the young man; \"I\nassure you we are, or rather we shall be, very happy. You are a woman at\nonce full of spirit and resignation; I have become simple in my tastes,\nand am without passion, I hope. Once in service, I shall be rich--once\nin M. Dantes' house, you will be at rest. Let us strive, I beseech\nyou,--let us strive to be cheerful.\"\n\n\"Yes, let us strive, for you ought to live, and to be happy, Albert.\"\n\n\"And so our division is made, mother,\" said the young man, affecting\nease of mind. \"We can now part; come, I shall engage your passage.\"\n\n\"And you, my dear boy?\"\n\n\"I shall stay here for a few days longer; we must accustom ourselves to\nparting. I want recommendations and some information relative to Africa.\nI will join you again at Marseilles.\"\n\n\"Well, be it so--let us part,\" said Mercedes, folding around her\nshoulders the only shawl she had taken away, and which accidentally\nhappened to be a valuable black cashmere. Albert gathered up his papers\nhastily, rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the landlord,\nand offering his arm to his mother, they descended the stairs. Some one\nwas walking down before them, and this person, hearing the rustling of a\nsilk dress, turned around. \"Debray!\" muttered Albert.\n\n\"You, Morcerf?\" replied the secretary, resting on the stairs. Curiosity\nhad vanquished the desire of preserving his incognito, and he was\nrecognized. It was, indeed, strange in this unknown spot to find the\nyoung man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in Paris.\n\n\"Morcerf!\" repeated Debray. Then noticing in the dim light the still\nyouthful and veiled figure of Madame de Morcerf:--\"Pardon me,\" he added\nwith a smile, \"I leave you, Albert.\" Albert understood his thoughts.\n\"Mother,\" he said, turning towards Mercedes, \"this is M. Debray,\nsecretary of the minister for the interior, once a friend of mine.\"\n\n\"How once?\" stammered Debray; \"what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I say so, M. Debray, because I have no friends now, and I ought not\nto have any. I thank you for having recognized me, sir.\" Debray stepped\nforward, and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor. \"Believe\nme, dear Albert,\" he said, with all the emotion he was capable of\nfeeling,--\"believe me, I feel deeply for your misfortunes, and if in any\nway I can serve you, I am yours.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Albert, smiling. \"In the midst of our\nmisfortunes, we are still rich enough not to require assistance from any\none. We are leaving Paris, and when our journey is paid, we shall have\n5,000 francs left.\" The blood mounted to the temples of Debray, who held\na million in his pocket-book, and unimaginative as he was he could not\nhelp reflecting that the same house had contained two women, one of\nwhom, justly dishonored, had left it poor with 1,500,000. francs under\nher cloak, while the other, unjustly stricken, but sublime in her\nmisfortune, was yet rich with a few deniers. This parallel disturbed his\nusual politeness, the philosophy he witnessed appalled him, he muttered\na few words of general civility and ran down-stairs.\n\nThat day the minister's clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to\nput up with from his ill-humor. But that same night, he found himself\nthe possessor of a fine house, situated on the Boulevard de la\nMadeleine, and an income of 50,000 livres. The next day, just as Debray\nwas signing the deed, that is about five o'clock in the afternoon,\nMadame de Morcerf, after having affectionately embraced her son, entered\nthe coupe of the diligence, which closed upon her. A man was hidden in\nLafitte's banking-house, behind one of the little arched windows which\nare placed above each desk; he saw Mercedes enter the diligence, and he\nalso saw Albert withdraw. Then he passed his hand across his forehead,\nwhich was clouded with doubt. \"Alas,\" he exclaimed, \"how can I restore\nthe happiness I have taken away from these poor innocent creatures? God\nhelp me!\"\n\n\n\nChapter 107. The Lions' Den.\n\nOne division of La Force, in which the most dangerous and desperate\nprisoners are confined, is called the court of Saint-Bernard. The\nprisoners, in their expressive language, have named it the \"Lions' Den,\"\nprobably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the\nbars, and sometimes the keepers also. It is a prison within a prison;\nthe walls are double the thickness of the rest. The gratings are every\nday carefully examined by jailers, whose herculean proportions and cold\npitiless expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their\nsubjects for their superior activity and intelligence. The court-yard of\nthis quarter is enclosed by enormous walls, over which the sun glances\nobliquely, when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf of moral and\nphysical deformity. On this paved yard are to be seen,--pacing to and\nfro from morning till night, pale, careworn, and haggard, like so\nmany shadows,--the men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is\nsharpening. There, crouched against the side of the wall which attracts\nand retains the most heat, they may be seen sometimes talking to one\nanother, but more frequently alone, watching the door, which sometimes\nopens to call forth one from the gloomy assemblage, or to throw in\nanother outcast from society.\n\nThe court of Saint-Bernard has its own particular apartment for the\nreception of guests; it is a long rectangle, divided by two upright\ngratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent\na visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the prisoners.\nIt is a wretched, damp, nay, even horrible spot, more especially when we\nconsider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between those\niron bars. And yet, frightful though this spot may be, it is looked upon\nas a kind of paradise by the men whose days are numbered; it is so rare\nfor them to leave the Lions' Den for any other place than the barrier\nSaint-Jacques or the galleys!\n\nIn the court which we have attempted to describe, and from which a damp\nvapor was rising, a young man with his hands in his pockets, who had\nexcited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the \"Den,\" might be seen\nwalking. The cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant\nman, if those clothes had not been torn to shreds; still they did not\nshow signs of wear, and the fine cloth, beneath the careful hands of\nthe prisoner, soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still\nperfect, for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the appearance\nof a new coat. He bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of\na shirt, which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into\nthe prison, and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of a\nhandkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a coronet. Some\nof the inmates of the \"Lions' Den\" were watching the operations of\nthe prisoner's toilet with considerable interest. \"See, the prince is\npluming himself,\" said one of the thieves. \"He's a fine looking fellow,\"\nsaid another; \"if he had only a comb and hair-grease, he'd take the\nshine off the gentlemen in white kids.\"\n\n\"His coat looks almost new, and his boots shine like a nigger's face.\nIt's pleasant to have such well-dressed comrades; but didn't those\ngendarmes behave shameful?--must 'a been jealous, to tear such clothes!\"\n\n\"He looks like a big-bug,\" said another; \"dresses in fine style. And,\nthen, to be here so young! Oh, what larks!\" Meanwhile the object of\nthis hideous admiration approached the wicket, against which one of the\nkeepers was leaning. \"Come, sir,\" he said, \"lend me twenty francs; you\nwill soon be paid; you run no risks with me. Remember, I have relations\nwho possess more millions than you have deniers. Come, I beseech\nyou, lend me twenty francs, so that I may buy a dressing-gown; it is\nintolerable always to be in a coat and boots! And what a coat, sir, for\na prince of the Cavalcanti!\" The keeper turned his back, and shrugged\nhis shoulders; he did not even laugh at what would have caused any one\nelse to do so; he had heard so many utter the same things,--indeed, he\nheard nothing else.\n\n\"Come,\" said Andrea, \"you are a man void of compassion; I'll have you\nturned out.\" This made the keeper turn around, and he burst into a loud\nlaugh. The prisoners then approached and formed a circle. \"I tell you\nthat with that wretched sum,\" continued Andrea, \"I could obtain a\ncoat, and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor I am daily\nexpecting.\"\n\n\"Of course--of course,\" said the prisoners;--\"any one can see he's a\ngentleman!\"\n\n\"Well, then, lend him the twenty francs,\" said the keeper, leaning on\nthe other shoulder; \"surely you will not refuse a comrade!\"\n\n\"I am no comrade of these people,\" said the young man, proudly, \"you\nhave no right to insult me thus.\"\n\nThe thieves looked at one another with low murmurs, and a storm gathered\nover the head of the aristocratic prisoner, raised less by his own\nwords than by the manner of the keeper. The latter, sure of quelling\nthe tempest when the waves became too violent, allowed them to rise to\na certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate Andrea,\nand besides it would afford him some recreation during the long day. The\nthieves had already approached Andrea, some screaming, \"La savate--La\nsavate!\" [*] a cruel operation, which consists in cuffing a comrade who\nmay have fallen into disgrace, not with an old shoe, but with an\niron-heeled one. Others proposed the \"anguille,\" another kind of\nrecreation, in which a handkerchief is filled with sand, pebbles, and\ntwo-sous pieces, when they have them, which the wretches beat like a\nflail over the head and shoulders of the unhappy sufferer. \"Let us\nhorsewhip the fine gentleman!\" said others.\n\n     * Savate: an old shoe.\n\nBut Andrea, turning towards them, winked his eyes, rolled his tongue\naround his cheeks, and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a\nhundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent. It was a\nMasonic sign Caderousse had taught him. He was immediately recognized as\none of them; the handkerchief was thrown down, and the iron-heeled shoe\nreplaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged. Some voices were\nheard to say that the gentleman was right; that he intended to be\ncivil, in his way, and that they would set the example of liberty of\nconscience,--and the mob retired. The keeper was so stupefied at this\nscene that he took Andrea by the hands and began examining his person,\nattributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the Lions' Den\nto something more substantial than mere fascination. Andrea made no\nresistance, although he protested against it. Suddenly a voice was heard\nat the wicket. \"Benedetto!\" exclaimed an inspector. The keeper relaxed\nhis hold. \"I am called,\" said Andrea. \"To the visitors' room!\" said the\nsame voice.\n\n\"You see some one pays me a visit. Ah, my dear sir, you will see whether\na Cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person!\" And Andrea, gliding\nthrough the court like a black shadow, rushed out through the wicket,\nleaving his comrades, and even the keeper, lost in wonder. Certainly\na call to the visitors' room had scarcely astonished Andrea less than\nthemselves, for the wily youth, instead of making use of his privilege\nof waiting to be claimed on his entry into La Force, had maintained\na rigid silence. \"Everything,\" he said, \"proves me to be under the\nprotection of some powerful person,--this sudden fortune, the facility\nwith which I have overcome all obstacles, an unexpected family and an\nillustrious name awarded to me, gold showered down upon me, and the most\nsplendid alliances about to be entered into. An unhappy lapse of fortune\nand the absence of my protector have cast me down, certainly, but\nnot forever. The hand which has retreated for a while will be again\nstretched forth to save me at the very moment when I shall think myself\nsinking into the abyss. Why should I risk an imprudent step? It might\nalienate my protector. He has two means of extricating me from this\ndilemma,--the one by a mysterious escape, managed through bribery; the\nother by buying off my judges with gold. I will say and do nothing until\nI am convinced that he has quite abandoned me, and then\"--\n\nAndrea had formed a plan which was tolerably clever. The unfortunate\nyouth was intrepid in the attack, and rude in the defence. He had borne\nwith the public prison, and with privations of all sorts; still, by\ndegrees nature, or rather custom, had prevailed, and he suffered from\nbeing naked, dirty, and hungry. It was at this moment of discomfort that\nthe inspector's voice called him to the visiting-room. Andrea felt his\nheart leap with joy. It was too soon for a visit from the examining\nmagistrate, and too late for one from the director of the prison, or the\ndoctor; it must, then, be the visitor he hoped for. Behind the grating\nof the room into which Andrea had been led, he saw, while his eyes\ndilated with surprise, the dark and intelligent face of M. Bertuccio,\nwho was also gazing with sad astonishment upon the iron bars, the bolted\ndoors, and the shadow which moved behind the other grating.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Andrea, deeply affected.\n\n\"Good morning, Benedetto,\" said Bertuccio, with his deep, hollow voice.\n\n\"You--you?\" said the young man, looking fearfully around him.\n\n\"Do you not recognize me, unhappy child?\"\n\n\"Silence,--be silent!\" said Andrea, who knew the delicate sense of\nhearing possessed by the walls; \"for heaven's sake, do not speak so\nloud!\"\n\n\"You wish to speak with me alone, do you not?\" said Bertuccio.\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"That is well.\" And Bertuccio, feeling in his pocket, signed to a keeper\nwhom he saw through the window of the wicket.\n\n\"Read?\" he said.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Andrea.\n\n\"An order to conduct you to a room, and to leave you there to talk to\nme.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" cried Andrea, leaping with joy. Then he mentally added,--\"Still my\nunknown protector! I am not forgotten. They wish for secrecy, since we\nare to converse in a private room. I understand, Bertuccio has been sent\nby my protector.\"\n\nThe keeper spoke for a moment with an official, then opened the iron\ngates and conducted Andrea to a room on the first floor. The room was\nwhitewashed, as is the custom in prisons, but it looked quite brilliant\nto a prisoner, though a stove, a bed, a chair, and a table formed the\nwhole of its sumptuous furniture. Bertuccio sat down upon the chair,\nAndrea threw himself upon the bed; the keeper retired.\n\n\"Now,\" said the steward, \"what have you to tell me?\"\n\n\"And you?\" said Andrea.\n\n\"You speak first.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. You must have much to tell me, since you have come to seek me.\"\n\n\"Well, be it so. You have continued your course of villany; you have\nrobbed--you have assassinated.\"\n\n\"Well, I should say! If you had me taken to a private room only to tell\nme this, you might have saved yourself the trouble. I know all these\nthings. But there are some with which, on the contrary, I am not\nacquainted. Let us talk of those, if you please. Who sent you?\"\n\n\"Come, come, you are going on quickly, M. Benedetto!\"\n\n\"Yes, and to the point. Let us dispense with useless words. Who sends\nyou?\"\n\n\"No one.\"\n\n\"How did you know I was in prison?\"\n\n\"I recognized you, some time since, as the insolent dandy who so\ngracefully mounted his horse in the Champs Elysees.\"\n\n\"Oh, the Champs Elysees? Ah, yes; we burn, as they say at the game\nof pincette. The Champs Elysees? Come, let us talk a little about my\nfather.\"\n\n\"Who, then, am I?\"\n\n\"You, sir?--you are my adopted father. But it was not you, I presume,\nwho placed at my disposal 100,000 francs, which I spent in four or five\nmonths; it was not you who manufactured an Italian gentleman for my\nfather; it was not you who introduced me into the world, and had me\ninvited to a certain dinner at Auteuil, which I fancy I am eating\nat this moment, in company with the most distinguished people in\nParis--amongst the rest with a certain procureur, whose acquaintance I\ndid very wrong not to cultivate, for he would have been very useful\nto me just now;--it was not you, in fact, who bailed me for one or two\nmillions, when the fatal discovery of my little secret took place. Come,\nspeak, my worthy Corsican, speak!\"\n\n\"What do you wish me to say?\"\n\n\"I will help you. You were speaking of the Champs Elysees just now,\nworthy foster-father.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, in the Champs Elysees there resides a very rich gentleman.\"\n\n\"At whose house you robbed and murdered, did you not?\"\n\n\"I believe I did.\"\n\n\"The Count of Monte Cristo?\"\n\n\"'Tis you who have named him, as M. Racine says. Well, am I to rush into\nhis arms, and strain him to my heart, crying, 'My father, my father!'\nlike Monsieur Pixerecourt.\" [*]\n\n\"Do not let us jest,\" gravely replied Bertuccio, \"and dare not to utter\nthat name again as you have pronounced it.\"\n\n     * Guilbert de Pixerecourt, French dramatist\n     (1775-1844).\n\n\"Bah,\" said Andrea, a little overcome, by the solemnity of Bertuccio's\nmanner, \"why not?\"\n\n\"Because the person who bears it is too highly favored by heaven to be\nthe father of such a wretch as you.\"\n\n\"Oh, these are fine words.\"\n\n\"And there will be fine doings, if you do not take care.\"\n\n\"Menaces--I do not fear them. I will say\"--\n\n\"Do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself?\" said\nBertuccio, in so calm a tone, and with so steadfast a look, that\nAndrea was moved to the very soul. \"Do you think you have to do with\ngalley-slaves, or novices in the world? Benedetto, you are fallen into\nterrible hands; they are ready to open for you--make use of them. Do not\nplay with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment, but which\nthey can take up again instantly, if you attempt to intercept their\nmovements.\"\n\n\"My father--I will know who my father is,\" said the obstinate youth; \"I\nwill perish if I must, but I will know it. What does scandal signify\nto me? What possessions, what reputation, what 'pull,' as Beauchamp\nsays,--have I? You great people always lose something by scandal,\nnotwithstanding your millions. Come, who is my father?\"\n\n\"I came to tell you.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" cried Benedetto, his eyes sparkling with joy. Just then the door\nopened, and the jailer, addressing himself to Bertuccio, said,--\"Excuse\nme, sir, but the examining magistrate is waiting for the prisoner.\"\n\n\"And so closes our interview,\" said Andrea to the worthy steward; \"I\nwish the troublesome fellow were at the devil!\"\n\n\"I will return to-morrow,\" said Bertuccio.\n\n\"Good! Gendarmes, I am at your service. Ah, sir, do leave a few crowns\nfor me at the gate that I may have some things I am in need of!\"\n\n\"It shall be done,\" replied Bertuccio. Andrea extended his hand;\nBertuccio kept his own in his pocket, and merely jingled a few pieces\nof money. \"That's what I mean,\" said Andrea, endeavoring to smile, quite\novercome by the strange tranquillity of Bertuccio. \"Can I be deceived?\"\nhe murmured, as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they\ncall \"the salad basket.\" \"Never mind, we shall see! To-morrow, then!\" he\nadded, turning towards Bertuccio.\n\n\"To-morrow!\" replied the steward.\n\n\n\nChapter 108. The Judge.\n\nWe remember that the Abbe Busoni remained alone with Noirtier in the\nchamber of death, and that the old man and the priest were the sole\nguardians of the young girl's body. Perhaps it was the Christian\nexhortations of the abbe, perhaps his kind charity, perhaps his\npersuasive words, which had restored the courage of Noirtier, for ever\nsince he had conversed with the priest his violent despair had yielded\nto a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive\naffection for Valentine. M. de Villefort had not seen his father since\nthe morning of the death. The whole establishment had been changed;\nanother valet was engaged for himself, a new servant for Noirtier, two\nwomen had entered Madame de Villefort's service,--in fact, everywhere,\nto the concierge and coachmen, new faces were presented to the different\nmasters of the house, thus widening the division which had always\nexisted between the members of the same family.\n\nThe assizes, also, were about to begin, and Villefort, shut up in his\nroom, exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case\nagainst the murderer of Caderousse. This affair, like all those in which\nthe Count of Monte Cristo had interfered, caused a great sensation in\nParis. The proofs were certainly not convincing, since they rested upon\na few words written by an escaped galley-slave on his death-bed, and who\nmight have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion.\nBut the mind of the procureur was made up; he felt assured that\nBenedetto was guilty, and he hoped by his skill in conducting this\naggravated case to flatter his self-love, which was about the only\nvulnerable point left in his frozen heart.\n\nThe case was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of\nVillefort, who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming\nassizes. He had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever, to evade\nthe enormous number of applications presented to him for the purpose\nof obtaining tickets of admission to the court on the day of trial. And\nthen so short a time had elapsed since the death of poor Valentine,\nand the gloom which overshadowed the house was so recent, that no one\nwondered to see the father so absorbed in his professional duties, which\nwere the only means he had of dissipating his grief.\n\nOnce only had Villefort seen his father; it was the day after that upon\nwhich Bertuccio had paid his second visit to Benedetto, when the latter\nwas to learn his father's name. The magistrate, harassed and fatigued,\nhad descended to the garden of his house, and in a gloomy mood, similar\nto that in which Tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies, he began\nknocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the\nrose-trees, which, placed along the avenue, seemed like the spectres of\nthe brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season. More than\nonce he had reached that part of the garden where the famous boarded\ngate stood overlooking the deserted enclosure, always returning by the\nsame path, to begin his walk again, at the same pace and with the same\ngesture, when he accidentally turned his eyes towards the house, whence\nhe heard the noisy play of his son, who had returned from school to\nspend the Sunday and Monday with his mother. While doing so, he observed\nM. Noirtier at one of the open windows, where the old man had been\nplaced that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded\nsome heat, and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of\nthe creeper which twined around the balcony.\n\nThe eye of the old man was riveted upon a spot which Villefort could\nscarcely distinguish. His glance was so full of hate, of ferocity, and\nsavage impatience, that Villefort turned out of the path he had been\npursuing, to see upon what person this dark look was directed. Then he\nsaw beneath a thick clump of linden-trees, which were nearly divested\nof foliage, Madame de Villefort sitting with a book in her hand, the\nperusal of which she frequently interrupted to smile upon her son, or\nto throw back his elastic ball, which he obstinately threw from the\ndrawing-room into the garden. Villefort became pale; he understood the\nold man's meaning. Noirtier continued to look at the same object, but\nsuddenly his glance was transferred from the wife to the husband, and\nVillefort himself had to submit to the searching investigation of eyes,\nwhich, while changing their direction and even their language, had lost\nnone of their menacing expression. Madame de Villefort, unconscious of\nthe passions that exhausted their fire over her head, at that moment\nheld her son's ball, and was making signs to him to reclaim it with a\nkiss. Edward begged for a long while, the maternal kiss probably not\noffering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain\nit; however at length he decided, leaped out of the window into a\ncluster of heliotropes and daisies, and ran to his mother, his forehead\nstreaming with perspiration. Madame de Villefort wiped his forehead,\npressed her lips upon it, and sent him back with the ball in one hand\nand some bonbons in the other.\n\nVillefort, drawn by an irresistible attraction, like that of the bird to\nthe serpent, walked towards the house. As he approached it, Noirtier's\ngaze followed him, and his eyes appeared of such a fiery brightness that\nVillefort felt them pierce to the depths of his heart. In that earnest\nlook might be read a deep reproach, as well as a terrible menace. Then\nNoirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as though to remind his son of a\nforgotten oath. \"It is well, sir,\" replied Villefort from below,--\"it\nis well; have patience but one day longer; what I have said I will do.\"\nNoirtier seemed to be calmed by these words, and turned his eyes with\nindifference to the other side. Villefort violently unbuttoned his\ngreat-coat, which seemed to strangle him, and passing his livid hand\nacross his forehead, entered his study.\n\nThe night was cold and still; the family had all retired to rest but\nVillefort, who alone remained up, and worked till five o'clock in the\nmorning, reviewing the last interrogatories made the night before by the\nexamining magistrates, compiling the depositions of the witnesses, and\nputting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation, which was one of\nthe most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet delivered.\n\nThe next day, Monday, was the first sitting of the assizes. The morning\ndawned dull and gloomy, and Villefort saw the dim gray light shine upon\nthe lines he had traced in red ink. The magistrate had slept for a short\ntime while the lamp sent forth its final struggles; its flickerings\nawoke him, and he found his fingers as damp and purple as though they\nhad been dipped in blood. He opened the window; a bright yellow streak\ncrossed the sky, and seemed to divide in half the poplars, which stood\nout in black relief on the horizon. In the clover-fields beyond the\nchestnut-trees, a lark was mounting up to heaven, while pouring out her\nclear morning song. The damps of the dew bathed the head of Villefort,\nand refreshed his memory. \"To-day,\" he said with an effort,--\"to-day the\nman who holds the blade of justice must strike wherever there is guilt.\"\nInvoluntarily his eyes wandered towards the window of Noirtier's room,\nwhere he had seen him the preceding night. The curtain was drawn, and\nyet the image of his father was so vivid to his mind that he addressed\nthe closed window as though it had been open, and as if through the\nopening he had beheld the menacing old man. \"Yes,\" he murmured,--\"yes,\nbe satisfied.\"\n\nHis head dropped upon his chest, and in this position he paced his\nstudy; then he threw himself, dressed as he was, upon a sofa, less to\nsleep than to rest his limbs, cramped with cold and study. By degrees\nevery one awoke. Villefort, from his study, heard the successive noises\nwhich accompany the life of a house,--the opening and shutting of doors,\nthe ringing of Madame de Villefort's bell, to summon the waiting-maid,\nmingled with the first shouts of the child, who rose full of the\nenjoyment of his age. Villefort also rang; his new valet brought him the\npapers, and with them a cup of chocolate.\n\n\"What are you bringing me?\" said he.\n\n\"A cup of chocolate.\"\n\n\"I did not ask for it. Who has paid me this attention?\"\n\n\"My mistress, sir. She said you would have to speak a great deal in\nthe murder case, and that you should take something to keep up your\nstrength;\" and the valet placed the cup on the table nearest to the\nsofa, which was, like all the rest, covered with papers. The valet then\nleft the room. Villefort looked for an instant with a gloomy expression,\nthen, suddenly, taking it up with a nervous motion, he swallowed its\ncontents at one draught. It might have been thought that he hoped the\nbeverage would be mortal, and that he sought for death to deliver him\nfrom a duty which he would rather die than fulfil. He then rose, and\npaced his room with a smile it would have been terrible to witness.\nThe chocolate was inoffensive, for M. de Villefort felt no effects. The\nbreakfast-hour arrived, but M. de Villefort was not at table. The valet\nre-entered.\n\n\"Madame de Villefort wishes to remind you, sir,\" he said, \"that eleven\no'clock has just struck, and that the trial commences at twelve.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Villefort, \"what then?\"\n\n\"Madame de Villefort is dressed; she is quite ready, and wishes to know\nif she is to accompany you, sir?\"\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\n\"To the Palais.\"\n\n\"What to do?\"\n\n\"My mistress wishes much to be present at the trial.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Villefort, with a startling accent; \"does she wish\nthat?\"--The man drew back and said, \"If you wish to go alone, sir, I\nwill go and tell my mistress.\" Villefort remained silent for a moment,\nand dented his pale cheeks with his nails. \"Tell your mistress,\" he at\nlength answered, \"that I wish to speak to her, and I beg she will wait\nfor me in her own room.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Then come to dress and shave me.\"\n\n\"Directly, sir.\" The valet re-appeared almost instantly, and, having\nshaved his master, assisted him to dress entirely in black. When he had\nfinished, he said,--\n\n\"My mistress said she should expect you, sir, as soon as you had\nfinished dressing.\"\n\n\"I am going to her.\" And Villefort, with his papers under his arm and\nhat in hand, directed his steps toward the apartment of his wife. At the\ndoor he paused for a moment to wipe his damp, pale brow. He then entered\nthe room. Madame de Villefort was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently\nturning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young\nEdward, by way of amusing himself, was tearing to pieces before his\nmother could finish reading them. She was dressed to go out, her bonnet\nwas placed beside her on a chair, and her gloves were on her hands.\n\n\"Ah, here you are, monsieur,\" she said in her naturally calm voice; \"but\nhow pale you are! Have you been working all night? Why did you not come\ndown to breakfast? Well, will you take me, or shall I take Edward?\"\nMadame de Villefort had multiplied her questions in order to gain one\nanswer, but to all her inquiries M. de Villefort remained mute and cold\nas a statue. \"Edward,\" said Villefort, fixing an imperious glance on\nthe child, \"go and play in the drawing-room, my dear; I wish to speak\nto your mamma.\" Madame de Villefort shuddered at the sight of that cold\ncountenance, that resolute tone, and the awfully strange preliminaries.\nEdward raised his head, looked at his mother, and then, finding that\nshe did not confirm the order, began cutting off the heads of his leaden\nsoldiers.\n\n\"Edward,\" cried M. de Villefort, so harshly that the child started up\nfrom the floor, \"do you hear me?--Go!\" The child, unaccustomed to such\ntreatment, arose, pale and trembling; it would be difficult to say\nwhether his emotion were caused by fear or passion. His father went up\nto him, took him in his arms, and kissed his forehead. \"Go,\" he said:\n\"go, my child.\" Edward ran out. M. de Villefort went to the door, which\nhe closed behind the child, and bolted. \"Dear me!\" said the young woman,\nendeavoring to read her husband's inmost thoughts, while a smile passed\nover her countenance which froze the impassibility of Villefort; \"what\nis the matter?\"\n\n\"Madame, where do you keep the poison you generally use?\" said the\nmagistrate, without any introduction, placing himself between his wife\nand the door.\n\nMadame de Villefort must have experienced something of the sensation of\na bird which, looking up, sees the murderous trap closing over its head.\nA hoarse, broken tone, which was neither a cry nor a sigh, escaped from\nher, while she became deadly pale. \"Monsieur,\" she said, \"I--I do not\nunderstand you.\" And, in her first paroxysm of terror, she had raised\nherself from the sofa, in the next, stronger very likely than the other,\nshe fell down again on the cushions. \"I asked you,\" continued Villefort,\nin a perfectly calm tone, \"where you conceal the poison by the aid\nof which you have killed my father-in-law, M. de Saint-Meran, my\nmother-in-law, Madame de Saint-Meran, Barrois, and my daughter\nValentine.\"\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" exclaimed Madame de Villefort, clasping her hands, \"what do\nyou say?\"\n\n\"It is not for you to interrogate, but to answer.\"\n\n\"Is it to the judge or to the husband?\" stammered Madame de Villefort.\n\"To the judge--to the judge, madame!\" It was terrible to behold the\nfrightful pallor of that woman, the anguish of her look, the trembling\nof her whole frame. \"Ah, sir,\" she muttered, \"ah, sir,\" and this was\nall.\n\n\"You do not answer, madame!\" exclaimed the terrible interrogator. Then\nhe added, with a smile yet more terrible than his anger, \"It is true,\nthen; you do not deny it!\" She moved forward. \"And you cannot deny it!\"\nadded Villefort, extending his hand toward her, as though to seize her\nin the name of justice. \"You have accomplished these different crimes\nwith impudent address, but which could only deceive those whose\naffections for you blinded them. Since the death of Madame de\nSaint-Meran, I have known that a poisoner lived in my house. M.\nd'Avrigny warned me of it. After the death of Barrois my suspicions were\ndirected towards an angel,--those suspicions which, even when there\nis no crime, are always alive in my heart; but after the death of\nValentine, there has been no doubt in my mind, madame, and not only in\nmine, but in those of others; thus your crime, known by two persons,\nsuspected by many, will soon become public, and, as I told you just now,\nyou no longer speak to the husband, but to the judge.\"\n\nThe young woman hid her face in her hands. \"Oh, sir,\" she stammered, \"I\nbeseech you, do not believe appearances.\"\n\n\"Are you, then, a coward?\" cried Villefort, in a contemptuous voice.\n\"But I have always observed that poisoners were cowards. Can you be a\ncoward,--you who have had the courage to witness the death of two old\nmen and a young girl murdered by you?\"\n\n\"Sir! sir!\"\n\n\"Can you be a coward?\" continued Villefort, with increasing excitement,\n\"you, who could count, one by one, the minutes of four death agonies?\nYou, who have arranged your infernal plans, and removed the beverages\nwith a talent and precision almost miraculous? Have you, then, who have\ncalculated everything with such nicety, have you forgotten to calculate\none thing--I mean where the revelation of your crimes will lead you to?\nOh, it is impossible--you must have saved some surer, more subtle and\ndeadly poison than any other, that you might escape the punishment\nthat you deserve. You have done this--I hope so, at least.\" Madame de\nVillefort stretched out her hands, and fell on her knees.\n\n\"I understand,\" he said, \"you confess; but a confession made to the\njudges, a confession made at the last moment, extorted when the crime\ncannot be denied, diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the\nguilty!\"\n\n\"The punishment?\" exclaimed Madame de Villefort, \"the punishment,\nmonsieur? Twice you have pronounced that word!\"\n\n\"Certainly. Did you hope to escape it because you were four times\nguilty? Did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are\nthe wife of him who pronounces it?--No, madame, no; the scaffold awaits\nthe poisoner, whoever she may be, unless, as I just said, the poisoner\nhas taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her\ndeadliest potion.\" Madame de Villefort uttered a wild cry, and a hideous\nand uncontrollable terror spread over her distorted features. \"Oh,\ndo not fear the scaffold, madame,\" said the magistrate; \"I will not\ndishonor you, since that would be dishonor to myself; no, if you have\nheard me distinctly, you will understand that you are not to die on the\nscaffold.\"\n\n\"No, I do not understand; what do you mean?\" stammered the unhappy\nwoman, completely overwhelmed. \"I mean that the wife of the first\nmagistrate in the capital shall not, by her infamy, soil an unblemished\nname; that she shall not, with one blow, dishonor her husband and her\nchild.\"\n\n\"No, no--oh, no!\"\n\n\"Well, madame, it will be a laudable action on your part, and I will\nthank you for it!\"\n\n\"You will thank me--for what?\"\n\n\"For what you have just said.\"\n\n\"What did I say? Oh, my brain whirls; I no longer understand anything.\nOh, my God, my God!\" And she rose, with her hair dishevelled, and her\nlips foaming.\n\n\"Have you answered the question I put to you on entering the\nroom?--where do you keep the poison you generally use, madame?\" Madame\nde Villefort raised her arms to heaven, and convulsively struck one\nhand against the other. \"No, no,\" she vociferated, \"no, you cannot wish\nthat!\"\n\n\"What I do not wish, madame, is that you should perish on the scaffold.\nDo you understand?\" asked Villefort.\n\n\"Oh, mercy, mercy, monsieur!\"\n\n\"What I require is, that justice be done. I am on the earth to punish,\nmadame,\" he added, with a flaming glance; \"any other woman, were it the\nqueen herself, I would send to the executioner; but to you I shall be\nmerciful. To you I will say, 'Have you not, madame, put aside some of\nthe surest, deadliest, most speedy poison?'\"\n\n\"Oh, pardon me, sir; let me live!\"\n\n\"She is cowardly,\" said Villefort.\n\n\"Reflect that I am your wife!\"\n\n\"You are a poisoner.\"\n\n\"In the name of heaven!\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"In the name of the love you once bore me!\"\n\n\"No, no!\"\n\n\"In the name of our child! Ah, for the sake of our child, let me live!\"\n\n\"No, no, no, I tell you; one day, if I allow you to live, you will\nperhaps kill him, as you have the others!\"\n\n\"I?--I kill my boy?\" cried the distracted mother, rushing toward\nVillefort; \"I kill my son? Ha, ha, ha!\" and a frightful, demoniac laugh\nfinished the sentence, which was lost in a hoarse rattle. Madame de\nVillefort fell at her husband's feet. He approached her. \"Think of it,\nmadame,\" he said; \"if, on my return, justice his not been satisfied, I\nwill denounce you with my own mouth, and arrest you with my own hands!\"\nShe listened, panting, overwhelmed, crushed; her eye alone lived, and\nglared horribly. \"Do you understand me?\" he said. \"I am going down there\nto pronounce the sentence of death against a murderer. If I find you\nalive on my return, you shall sleep to-night in the conciergerie.\"\nMadame de Villefort sighed; her nerves gave way, and she sunk on the\ncarpet. The king's attorney seemed to experience a sensation of pity;\nhe looked upon her less severely, and, bowing to her, said slowly,\n\"Farewell, madame, farewell!\" That farewell struck Madame de Villefort\nlike the executioner's knife. She fainted. The procureur went out, after\nhaving double-locked the door.\n\n\n\nChapter 109. The Assizes.\n\nThe Benedetto affair, as it was called at the Palais, and by people in\ngeneral, had produced a tremendous sensation. Frequenting the Cafe de\nParis, the Boulevard de Gand, and the Bois de Boulogne, during his\nbrief career of splendor, the false Cavalcanti had formed a host of\nacquaintances. The papers had related his various adventures, both as\nthe man of fashion and the galley-slave; and as every one who had been\npersonally acquainted with Prince Andrea Cavalcanti experienced a\nlively curiosity in his fate, they all determined to spare no trouble in\nendeavoring to witness the trial of M. Benedetto for the murder of his\ncomrade in chains. In the eyes of many, Benedetto appeared, if not\na victim to, at least an instance of, the fallibility of the law. M.\nCavalcanti, his father, had been seen in Paris, and it was expected that\nhe would re-appear to claim the illustrious outcast. Many, also, who\nwere not aware of the circumstances attending his withdrawal from Paris,\nwere struck with the worthy appearance, the gentlemanly bearing, and\nthe knowledge of the world displayed by the old patrician, who certainly\nplayed the nobleman very well, so long as he said nothing, and made no\narithmetical calculations. As for the accused himself, many remembered\nhim as being so amiable, so handsome, and so liberal, that they chose\nto think him the victim of some conspiracy, since in this world large\nfortunes frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown\nenemy. Every one, therefore, ran to the court; some to witness the\nsight, others to comment upon it. From seven o'clock in the morning\na crowd was stationed at the iron gates, and an hour before the trial\ncommenced the hall was full of the privileged. Before the entrance of\nthe magistrates, and indeed frequently afterwards, a court of justice,\non days when some especial trial is to take place, resembles a\ndrawing-room where many persons recognize each other and converse if\nthey can do so without losing their seats; or, if they are separated by\ntoo great a number of lawyers, communicate by signs.\n\nIt was one of the magnificent autumn days which make amends for a short\nsummer; the clouds which M. de Villefort had perceived at sunrise\nhad all disappeared as if by magic, and one of the softest and most\nbrilliant days of September shone forth in all its splendor.\n\nBeauchamp, one of the kings of the press, and therefore claiming the\nright of a throne everywhere, was eying everybody through his monocle.\nHe perceived Chateau-Renaud and Debray, who had just gained the good\ngraces of a sergeant-at-arms, and who had persuaded the latter to let\nthem stand before, instead of behind him, as they ought to have done.\nThe worthy sergeant had recognized the minister's secretary and the\nmillionnaire, and, by way of paying extra attention to his noble\nneighbors, promised to keep their places while they paid a visit to\nBeauchamp.\n\n\"Well,\" said Beauchamp, \"we shall see our friend!\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed!\" replied Debray. \"That worthy prince. Deuce take those\nItalian princes!\"\n\n\"A man, too, who could boast of Dante for a genealogist, and could\nreckon back to the 'Divine Comedy.'\"\n\n\"A nobility of the rope!\" said Chateau-Renaud phlegmatically.\n\n\"He will be condemned, will he not?\" asked Debray of Beauchamp.\n\n\"My dear fellow, I think we should ask you that question; you know such\nnews much better than we do. Did you see the president at the minister's\nlast night?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"Something which will surprise you.\"\n\n\"Oh, make haste and tell me, then; it is a long time since that has\nhappened.\"\n\n\"Well, he told me that Benedetto, who is considered a serpent of\nsubtlety and a giant of cunning, is really but a very commonplace, silly\nrascal, and altogether unworthy of the experiments that will be made on\nhis phrenological organs after his death.\"\n\n\"Bah,\" said Beauchamp, \"he played the prince very well.\"\n\n\"Yes, for you who detest those unhappy princes, Beauchamp, and are\nalways delighted to find fault with them; but not for me, who discover\na gentleman by instinct, and who scent out an aristocratic family like a\nvery bloodhound of heraldry.\"\n\n\"Then you never believed in the principality?\"\n\n\"Yes.--in the principality, but not in the prince.\"\n\n\"Not so bad,\" said Beauchamp; \"still, I assure you, he passed very well\nwith many people; I saw him at the ministers' houses.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Chateau-Renaud. \"The idea of thinking ministers\nunderstand anything about princes!\"\n\n\"There is something in what you have just said,\" said Beauchamp,\nlaughing.\n\n\"But,\" said Debray to Beauchamp, \"if I spoke to the president, you must\nhave been with the procureur.\"\n\n\"It was an impossibility; for the last week M. de Villefort has\nsecluded himself. It is natural enough; this strange chain of domestic\nafflictions, followed by the no less strange death of his daughter\"--\n\n\"Strange? What do you mean, Beauchamp?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the\nminister's?\" said Beauchamp, placing his eye-glass in his eye, where he\ntried to make it remain.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"allow me to tell you that you do\nnot understand that manoeuvre with the eye-glass half so well as Debray.\nGive him a lesson, Debray.\"\n\n\"Stay,\" said Beauchamp, \"surely I am not deceived.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"It is she!\"\n\n\"Whom do you mean?\"\n\n\"They said she had left.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Eugenie?\" said Chateau-Renaud; \"has she returned?\"\n\n\"No, but her mother.\"\n\n\"Madame Danglars? Nonsense! Impossible!\" said Chateau-Renaud; \"only\nten days after the flight of her daughter, and three days from the\nbankruptcy of her husband?\"\n\nDebray colored slightly, and followed with his eyes the direction of\nBeauchamp's glance. \"Come,\" he said, \"it is only a veiled lady, some\nforeign princess, perhaps the mother of Cavalcanti. But you were just\nspeaking on a very interesting topic, Beauchamp.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes; you were telling us about the extraordinary death of Valentine.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, so I was. But how is it that Madame de Villefort is not here?\"\n\n\"Poor, dear woman,\" said Debray, \"she is no doubt occupied in distilling\nbalm for the hospitals, or in making cosmetics for herself or friends.\nDo you know she spends two or three thousand crowns a year in this\namusement? But I wonder she is not here. I should have been pleased to\nsee her, for I like her very much.\"\n\n\"And I hate her,\" said Chateau-Renaud.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I do not know. Why do we love? Why do we hate? I detest her, from\nantipathy.\"\n\n\"Or, rather, by instinct.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so. But to return to what you were saying, Beauchamp.\"\n\n\"Well, do you know why they die so multitudinously at M. de\nVillefort's?\"\n\n\"'Multitudinously' is good,\" said Chateau-Renaud.\n\n\"My good fellow, you'll find the word in Saint-Simon.\"\n\n\"But the thing itself is at M. de Villefort's; but let's get back to the\nsubject.\"\n\n\"Talking of that,\" said Debray, \"Madame was making inquiries about that\nhouse, which for the last three months has been hung with black.\"\n\n\"Who is Madame?\" asked Chateau-Renaud.\n\n\"The minister's wife, pardieu!\"\n\n\"Oh, your pardon! I never visit ministers; I leave that to the princes.\"\n\n\"Really, You were only before sparkling, but now you are brilliant; take\ncompassion on us, or, like Jupiter, you will wither us up.\"\n\n\"I will not speak again,\" said Chateau-Renaud; \"pray have compassion\nupon me, and do not take up every word I say.\"\n\n\"Come, let us endeavor to get to the end of our story, Beauchamp; I\ntold you that yesterday Madame made inquiries of me upon the subject;\nenlighten me, and I will then communicate my information to her.\"\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, the reason people die so multitudinously (I like the\nword) at M. de Villefort's is that there is an assassin in the house!\"\nThe two young men shuddered, for the same idea had more than once\noccurred to them. \"And who is the assassin;\" they asked together.\n\n\"Young Edward!\" A burst of laughter from the auditors did not in the\nleast disconcert the speaker, who continued,--\"Yes, gentlemen; Edward,\nthe infant phenomenon, who is quite an adept in the art of killing.\"\n\n\"You are jesting.\"\n\n\"Not at all. I yesterday engaged a servant, who had just left M.\nde Villefort--I intend sending him away to-morrow, for he eats so\nenormously, to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his terror in\nthat house. Well, now listen.\"\n\n\"We are listening.\"\n\n\"It appears the dear child has obtained possession of a bottle\ncontaining some drug, which he every now and then uses against those who\nhave displeased him. First, M. and Madame de Saint-Meran incurred his\ndispleasure, so he poured out three drops of his elixir--three drops\nwere sufficient; then followed Barrois, the old servant of M. Noirtier,\nwho sometimes rebuffed this little wretch--he therefore received the\nsame quantity of the elixir; the same happened to Valentine, of whom he\nwas jealous; he gave her the same dose as the others, and all was over\nfor her as well as the rest.\"\n\n\"Why, what nonsense are you telling us?\" said Chateau-Renaud.\n\n\"Yes, it is an extraordinary story,\" said Beauchamp; \"is it not?\"\n\n\"It is absurd,\" said Debray.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Beauchamp, \"you doubt me? Well, you can ask my servant, or\nrather him who will no longer be my servant to-morrow, it was the talk\nof the house.\"\n\n\"And this elixir, where is it? what is it?\"\n\n\"The child conceals it.\"\n\n\"But where did he find it?\"\n\n\"In his mother's laboratory.\"\n\n\"Does his mother then, keep poisons in her laboratory?\"\n\n\"How can I tell? You are questioning me like a king's attorney. I only\nrepeat what I have been told, and like my informant I can do no more.\nThe poor devil would eat nothing, from fear.\"\n\n\"It is incredible!\"\n\n\"No, my dear fellow, it is not at all incredible. You saw the child pass\nthrough the Rue Richelieu last year, who amused himself with killing his\nbrothers and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while they slept.\nThe generation who follow us are very precocious.\"\n\n\"Come, Beauchamp,\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"I will bet anything you do not\nbelieve a word of all you have been telling us.\"\n\n\"I do not see the Count of Monte Cristo here.\"\n\n\"He is worn out,\" said Debray; \"besides, he could not well appear in\npublic, since he has been the dupe of the Cavalcanti, who, it appears,\npresented themselves to him with false letters of credit, and cheated\nhim out of 100,000. francs upon the hypothesis of this principality.\"\n\n\"By the way, M. de Chateau-Renaud,\" asked Beauchamp, \"how is Morrel?\"\n\n\"Ma foi, I have called three times without once seeing him. Still, his\nsister did not seem uneasy, and told me that though she had not seen him\nfor two or three days, she was sure he was well.\"\n\n\"Ah, now I think of it, the Count of Monte Cristo cannot appear in the\nhall,\" said Beauchamp.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because he is an actor in the drama.\"\n\n\"Has he assassinated any one, then?\"\n\n\"No, on the contrary, they wished to assassinate him. You know that\nit was in leaving his house that M. de Caderousse was murdered by his\nfriend Benedetto. You know that the famous waistcoat was found in\nhis house, containing the letter which stopped the signature of\nthe marriage-contract. Do you see the waistcoat? There it is, all\nblood-stained, on the desk, as a testimony of the crime.\"\n\n\"Ah, very good.\"\n\n\"Hush, gentlemen, here is the court; let us go back to our places.\" A\nnoise was heard in the hall; the sergeant called his two patrons with\nan energetic \"hem!\" and the door-keeper appearing, called out with that\nshrill voice peculiar to his order, ever since the days of Beaumarchais,\n\"The court, gentlemen!\"\n\n\n\nChapter 110. The Indictment.\n\nThe judges took their places in the midst of the most profound silence;\nthe jury took their seats; M. de Villefort, the object of unusual\nattention, and we had almost said of general admiration, sat in the\narm-chair and cast a tranquil glance around him. Every one looked\nwith astonishment on that grave and severe face, whose calm expression\npersonal griefs had been unable to disturb, and the aspect of a man who\nwas a stranger to all human emotions excited something very like terror.\n\n\"Gendarmes,\" said the president, \"lead in the accused.\"\n\nAt these words the public attention became more intense, and all eyes\nwere turned towards the door through which Benedetto was to enter.\nThe door soon opened and the accused appeared. The same impression was\nexperienced by all present, and no one was deceived by the expression\nof his countenance. His features bore no sign of that deep emotion\nwhich stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek. His hands,\ngracefully placed, one upon his hat, the other in the opening of his\nwhite waistcoat, were not at all tremulous; his eye was calm and even\nbrilliant. Scarcely had he entered the hall when he glanced at the\nwhole body of magistrates and assistants; his eye rested longer on the\npresident, and still more so on the king's attorney. By the side of\nAndrea was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his defence, and\nwho had been appointed by the court, for Andrea disdained to pay\nany attention to those details, to which he appeared to attach no\nimportance. The lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face\nexpressed a hundred times more emotion than that which characterized the\nprisoner.\n\nThe president called for the indictment, revised as we know, by the\nclever and implacable pen of Villefort. During the reading of this,\nwhich was long, the public attention was continually drawn towards\nAndrea, who bore the inspection with Spartan unconcern. Villefort had\nnever been so concise and eloquent. The crime was depicted in the most\nvivid colors; the former life of the prisoner, his transformation, a\nreview of his life from the earliest period, were set forth with all the\ntalent that a knowledge of human life could furnish to a mind like that\nof the procureur. Benedetto was thus forever condemned in public opinion\nbefore the sentence of the law could be pronounced. Andrea paid no\nattention to the successive charges which were brought against him. M.\nde Villefort, who examined him attentively, and who no doubt practiced\nupon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed to use, in vain\nendeavored to make him lower his eyes, notwithstanding the depth and\nprofundity of his gaze. At length the reading of the indictment was\nended.\n\n\"Accused,\" said the president, \"your name and surname?\" Andrea arose.\n\"Excuse me, Mr. President,\" he said, in a clear voice, \"but I see you\nare going to adopt a course of questions through which I cannot follow\nyou. I have an idea, which I will explain by and by, of making an\nexception to the usual form of accusation. Allow me, then, if you\nplease, to answer in different order, or I will not do so at all.\"\nThe astonished president looked at the jury, who in turn looked at\nVillefort. The whole assembly manifested great surprise, but Andrea\nappeared quite unmoved. \"Your age?\" said the president; \"will you answer\nthat question?\"\n\n\"I will answer that question, as well as the rest, Mr. President, but in\nits turn.\"\n\n\"Your age?\" repeated the president.\n\n\"I am twenty-one years old, or rather I shall be in a few days, as I was\nborn the night of the 27th of September, 1817.\" M. de Villefort, who\nwas busy taking down some notes, raised his head at the mention of this\ndate. \"Where were you born?\" continued the president.\n\n\"At Auteuil, near Paris.\" M. de Villefort a second time raised his head,\nlooked at Benedetto as if he had been gazing at the head of Medusa, and\nbecame livid. As for Benedetto, he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine\ncambric pocket-handkerchief. \"Your profession?\"\n\n\"First I was a forger,\" answered Andrea, as calmly as possible; \"then I\nbecame a thief, and lately have become an assassin.\" A murmur, or rather\nstorm, of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly. The judges\nthemselves appeared to be stupefied, and the jury manifested tokens of\ndisgust for cynicism so unexpected in a man of fashion. M. de Villefort\npressed his hand upon his brow, which, at first pale, had become red and\nburning; then he suddenly arose and looked around as though he had lost\nhis senses--he wanted air.\n\n\"Are you looking for anything, Mr. Procureur?\" asked Benedetto, with his\nmost ingratiating smile. M. de Villefort answered nothing, but sat, or\nrather threw himself down again upon his chair. \"And now, prisoner,\nwill you consent to tell your name?\" said the president. \"The brutal\naffectation with which you have enumerated and classified your crimes\ncalls for a severe reprimand on the part of the court, both in the name\nof morality, and for the respect due to humanity. You appear to consider\nthis a point of honor, and it may be for this reason, that you have\ndelayed acknowledging your name. You wished it to be preceded by all\nthese titles.\"\n\n\"It is quite wonderful, Mr. President, how entirely you have read my\nthoughts,\" said Benedetto, in his softest voice and most polite manner.\n\"This is, indeed, the reason why I begged you to alter the order of the\nquestions.\" The public astonishment had reached its height. There was no\nlonger any deceit or bravado in the manner of the accused. The audience\nfelt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude.\n\n\"Well,\" said the president; \"your name?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you my name, since I do not know it; but I know my\nfather's, and can tell it to you.\"\n\nA painful giddiness overwhelmed Villefort; great drops of acrid sweat\nfell from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand.\n\n\"Repeat your father's name,\" said the president. Not a whisper, not a\nbreath, was heard in that vast assembly; every one waited anxiously.\n\n\"My father is king's attorney,\" replied Andrea calmly.\n\n\"King's attorney?\" said the president, stupefied, and without noticing\nthe agitation which spread over the face of M. de Villefort; \"king's\nattorney?\"\n\n\"Yes; and if you wish to know his name, I will tell it,--he is named\nVillefort.\" The explosion, which had been so long restrained from a\nfeeling of respect to the court of justice, now burst forth like thunder\nfrom the breasts of all present; the court itself did not seek to\nrestrain the feelings of the audience. The exclamations, the insults\naddressed to Benedetto, who remained perfectly unconcerned, the\nenergetic gestures, the movement of the gendarmes, the sneers of the\nscum of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in case of any\ndisturbance--all this lasted five minutes, before the door-keepers and\nmagistrates were able to restore silence. In the midst of this tumult\nthe voice of the president was heard to exclaim,--\"Are you playing with\njustice, accused, and do you dare set your fellow-citizens an example of\ndisorder which even in these times has never been equalled?\"\n\nSeveral persons hurried up to M. de Villefort, who sat half bowed over\nin his chair, offering him consolation, encouragement, and protestations\nof zeal and sympathy. Order was re-established in the hall, except that\na few people still moved about and whispered to one another. A lady,\nit was said, had just fainted; they had supplied her with a\nsmelling-bottle, and she had recovered. During the scene of tumult,\nAndrea had turned his smiling face towards the assembly; then, leaning\nwith one hand on the oaken rail of the dock, in the most graceful\nattitude possible, he said: \"Gentlemen, I assure you I had no idea of\ninsulting the court, or of making a useless disturbance in the presence\nof this honorable assembly. They ask my age; I tell it. They ask where I\nwas born; I answer. They ask my name, I cannot give it, since my parents\nabandoned me. But though I cannot give my own name, not possessing one,\nI can tell them my father's. Now I repeat, my father is named M. de\nVillefort, and I am ready to prove it.\"\n\nThere was an energy, a conviction, and a sincerity in the manner of the\nyoung man, which silenced the tumult. All eyes were turned for a moment\ntowards the procureur, who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had\nchanged him into a corpse. \"Gentlemen,\" said Andrea, commanding silence\nby his voice and manner; \"I owe you the proofs and explanations of what\nI have said.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the irritated president, \"you called yourself Benedetto,\ndeclared yourself an orphan, and claimed Corsica as your country.\"\n\n\"I said anything I pleased, in order that the solemn declaration I have\njust made should not be withheld, which otherwise would certainly have\nbeen the case. I now repeat that I was born at Auteuil on the night of\nthe 27th of September, 1817, and that I am the son of the procureur, M.\nde Villefort. Do you wish for any further details? I will give them. I\nwas born in No. 28, Rue de la Fontaine, in a room hung with red damask;\nmy father took me in his arms, telling my mother I was dead, wrapped\nme in a napkin marked with an H and an N, and carried me into a garden,\nwhere he buried me alive.\"\n\nA shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of\nthe prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of M. de Villefort.\n\"But how have you become acquainted with all these details?\" asked the\npresident.\n\n\"I will tell you, Mr. President. A man who had sworn vengeance against\nmy father, and had long watched his opportunity to kill him, had\nintroduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried\nme. He was concealed in a thicket; he saw my father bury something in\nthe ground, and stabbed him; then thinking the deposit might contain\nsome treasure he turned up the ground, and found me still living. The\nman carried me to the foundling asylum, where I was registered under the\nnumber 37. Three months afterwards, a woman travelled from Rogliano to\nParis to fetch me, and having claimed me as her son, carried me away.\nThus, you see, though born in Paris, I was brought up in Corsica.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence, during which one could have fancied\nthe hall empty, so profound was the stillness. \"Proceed,\" said the\npresident.\n\n\"Certainly, I might have lived happily amongst those good people, who\nadored me, but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which\nmy adopted mother endeavored to instil into my heart. I increased in\nwickedness till I committed crime. One day when I cursed Providence for\nmaking me so wicked, and ordaining me to such a fate, my adopted father\nsaid to me, 'Do not blaspheme, unhappy child, the crime is that of your\nfather, not yours,--of your father, who consigned you to hell if you\ndied, and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive.' After that I\nceased to blaspheme, but I cursed my father. That is why I have uttered\nthe words for which you blame me; that is why I have filled this whole\nassembly with horror. If I have committed an additional crime, punish\nme, but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my fate\nhas been sad, bitter, and lamentable, then pity me.\"\n\n\"But your mother?\" asked the president.\n\n\"My mother thought me dead; she is not guilty. I did not even wish to\nknow her name, nor do I know it.\" Just then a piercing cry, ending in a\nsob, burst from the centre of the crowd, who encircled the lady who had\nbefore fainted, and who now fell into a violent fit of hysterics. She\nwas carried out of the hall, the thick veil which concealed her face\ndropped off, and Madame Danglars was recognized. Notwithstanding his\nshattered nerves, the ringing sensation in his ears, and the madness\nwhich turned his brain, Villefort rose as he perceived her. \"The proofs,\nthe proofs!\" said the president; \"remember this tissue of horrors must\nbe supported by the clearest proofs.\"\n\n\"The proofs?\" said Benedetto, laughing; \"do you want proofs?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, then, look at M. de Villefort, and then ask me for proofs.\"\n\nEvery one turned towards the procureur, who, unable to bear the\nuniversal gaze now riveted on him alone, advanced staggering into the\nmidst of the tribunal, with his hair dishevelled and his face indented\nwith the mark of his nails. The whole assembly uttered a long murmur of\nastonishment. \"Father,\" said Benedetto, \"I am asked for proofs, do you\nwish me to give them?\"\n\n\"No, no, it is useless,\" stammered M. de Villefort in a hoarse voice;\n\"no, it is useless!\"\n\n\"How useless?\" cried the president, \"what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that I feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight\nwhich crushes me. Gentlemen, I know I am in the hands of an avenging\nGod! We need no proofs; everything relating to this young man is true.\"\nA dull, gloomy silence, like that which precedes some awful phenomenon\nof nature, pervaded the assembly, who shuddered in dismay. \"What, M.\nde Villefort,\" cried the president, \"do you yield to an hallucination?\nWhat, are you no longer in possession of your senses? This strange,\nunexpected, terrible accusation has disordered your reason. Come,\nrecover.\"\n\nThe procureur dropped his head; his teeth chattered like those of a man\nunder a violent attack of fever, and yet he was deadly pale.\n\n\"I am in possession of all my senses, sir,\" he said; \"my body alone\nsuffers, as you may suppose. I acknowledge myself guilty of all the\nyoung man has brought against me, and from this hour hold myself under\nthe authority of the procureur who will succeed me.\"\n\nAnd as he spoke these words with a hoarse, choking voice, he staggered\ntowards the door, which was mechanically opened by a door-keeper.\nThe whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and\nconfession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which\nhad been expected during the last fortnight by the Parisian world.\n\n\"Well,\" said Beauchamp, \"let them now say that drama is unnatural!\"\n\n\"Ma foi!\" said Chateau-Renaud, \"I would rather end my career like M.\nde Morcerf; a pistol-shot seems quite delightful compared with this\ncatastrophe.\"\n\n\"And moreover, it kills,\" said Beauchamp.\n\n\"And to think that I had an idea of marrying his daughter,\" said Debray.\n\"She did well to die, poor girl!\"\n\n\"The sitting is adjourned, gentlemen,\" said the president; \"fresh\ninquiries will be made, and the case will be tried next session by\nanother magistrate.\" As for Andrea, who was calm and more interesting\nthan ever, he left the hall, escorted by gendarmes, who involuntarily\npaid him some attention. \"Well, what do you think of this, my fine\nfellow?\" asked Debray of the sergeant-at-arms, slipping a louis into his\nhand. \"There will be extenuating circumstances,\" he replied.\n\n\n\nChapter 111. Expiation.\n\nNotwithstanding the density of the crowd, M. de Villefort saw it open\nbefore him. There is something so awe-inspiring in great afflictions\nthat even in the worst times the first emotion of a crowd has generally\nbeen to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe. Many people\nhave been assassinated in a tumult, but even criminals have rarely\nbeen insulted during trial. Thus Villefort passed through the mass\nof spectators and officers of the Palais, and withdrew. Though he had\nacknowledged his guilt, he was protected by his grief. There are\nsome situations which men understand by instinct, but which reason is\npowerless to explain; in such cases the greatest poet is he who gives\nutterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow. Those\nwho hear the bitter cry are as much impressed as if they listened to\nan entire poem, and when the sufferer is sincere they are right in\nregarding his outburst as sublime.\n\nIt would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which Villefort\nleft the Palais. Every pulse beat with feverish excitement, every nerve\nwas strained, every vein swollen, and every part of his body seemed\nto suffer distinctly from the rest, thus multiplying his agony a\nthousand-fold. He made his way along the corridors through force of\nhabit; he threw aside his magisterial robe, not out of deference to\netiquette, but because it was an unbearable burden, a veritable garb\nof Nessus, insatiate in torture. Having staggered as far as the Rue\nDauphine, he perceived his carriage, awoke his sleeping coachman by\nopening the door himself, threw himself on the cushions, and pointed\ntowards the Faubourg Saint-Honore; the carriage drove on. The weight of\nhis fallen fortunes seemed suddenly to crush him; he could not\nforesee the consequences; he could not contemplate the future with the\nindifference of the hardened criminal who merely faces a contingency\nalready familiar. God was still in his heart. \"God,\" he murmured, not\nknowing what he said,--\"God--God!\" Behind the event that had overwhelmed\nhim he saw the hand of God. The carriage rolled rapidly onward.\nVillefort, while turning restlessly on the cushions, felt something\npress against him. He put out his hand to remove the object; it was\na fan which Madame de Villefort had left in the carriage; this fan\nawakened a recollection which darted through his mind like lightning. He\nthought of his wife.\n\n\"Oh!\" he exclaimed, as though a redhot iron were piercing his heart.\nDuring the last hour his own crime had alone been presented to his mind;\nnow another object, not less terrible, suddenly presented itself. His\nwife! He had just acted the inexorable judge with her, he had condemned\nher to death, and she, crushed by remorse, struck with terror,\ncovered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of his irreproachable\nvirtue,--she, a poor, weak woman, without help or the power of defending\nherself against his absolute and supreme will,--she might at that very\nmoment, perhaps, be preparing to die! An hour had elapsed since her\ncondemnation; at that moment, doubtless, she was recalling all her\ncrimes to her memory; she was asking pardon for her sins; perhaps\nshe was even writing a letter imploring forgiveness from her virtuous\nhusband--a forgiveness she was purchasing with her death! Villefort\nagain groaned with anguish and despair. \"Ah,\" he exclaimed, \"that woman\nbecame criminal only from associating with me! I carried the infection\nof crime with me, and she has caught it as she would the typhus fever,\nthe cholera, the plague! And yet I have punished her--I have dared to\ntell her--I have--'Repent and die!' But no, she must not die; she shall\nlive, and with me. We will flee from Paris and go as far as the earth\nreaches. I told her of the scaffold; oh, heavens, I forgot that it\nawaits me also! How could I pronounce that word? Yes, we will fly;\nI will confess all to her,--I will tell her daily that I also have\ncommitted a crime!--Oh, what an alliance--the tiger and the serpent;\nworthy wife of such as I am! She must live that my infamy may diminish\nhers.\" And Villefort dashed open the window in front of the carriage.\n\n\"Faster, faster!\" he cried, in a tone which electrified the coachman.\nThe horses, impelled by fear, flew towards the house.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" repeated Villefort, as he approached his home--\"yes, that\nwoman must live; she must repent, and educate my son, the sole survivor,\nwith the exception of the indestructible old man, of the wreck of\nmy house. She loves him; it was for his sake she has committed these\ncrimes. We ought never to despair of softening the heart of a mother who\nloves her child. She will repent, and no one will know that she has been\nguilty. The events which have taken place in my house, though they now\noccupy the public mind, will be forgotten in time, or if, indeed, a few\nenemies should persist in remembering them, why then I will add them to\nmy list of crimes. What will it signify if one, two, or three more are\nadded? My wife and child shall escape from this gulf, carrying treasures\nwith them; she will live and may yet be happy, since her child, in whom\nall her love is centred, will be with her. I shall have performed a good\naction, and my heart will be lighter.\" And the procureur breathed more\nfreely than he had done for some time.\n\nThe carriage stopped at the door of the house. Villefort leaped out\nof the carriage, and saw that his servants were surprised at his early\nreturn; he could read no other expression on their features. Neither of\nthem spoke to him; they merely stood aside to let him pass by, as usual,\nnothing more. As he passed by M. Noirtier's room, he perceived two\nfigures through the half-open door; but he experienced no curiosity to\nknow who was visiting his father: anxiety carried him on further.\n\n\"Come,\" he said, as he ascended the stairs leading to his wife's room,\n\"nothing is changed here.\" He then closed the door of the landing.\n\"No one must disturb us,\" he said; \"I must speak freely to her, accuse\nmyself, and say\"--he approached the door, touched the crystal handle,\nwhich yielded to his hand. \"Not locked,\" he cried; \"that is well.\" And\nhe entered the little room in which Edward slept; for though the child\nwent to school during the day, his mother could not allow him to be\nseparated from her at night. With a single glance Villefort's eye\nran through the room. \"Not here,\" he said; \"doubtless she is in her\nbedroom.\" He rushed towards the door, found it bolted, and stopped,\nshuddering. \"Heloise!\" he cried. He fancied he heard the sound of a\npiece of furniture being removed. \"Heloise!\" he repeated.\n\n\"Who is there?\" answered the voice of her he sought. He thought that\nvoice more feeble than usual.\n\n\"Open the door!\" cried Villefort. \"Open; it is I.\" But notwithstanding\nthis request, notwithstanding the tone of anguish in which it was\nuttered, the door remained closed. Villefort burst it open with a\nviolent blow. At the entrance of the room which led to her boudoir,\nMadame de Villefort was standing erect, pale, her features contracted,\nand her eyes glaring horribly. \"Heloise, Heloise!\" he said, \"what is the\nmatter? Speak!\" The young woman extended her stiff white hands towards\nhim. \"It is done, monsieur,\" she said with a rattling noise which seemed\nto tear her throat. \"What more do you want?\" and she fell full length on\nthe floor. Villefort ran to her and seized her hand, which convulsively\nclasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper. Madame de Villefort was\ndead. Villefort, maddened with horror, stepped back to the threshhold\nof the door, fixing his eyes on the corpse: \"My son!\" he exclaimed\nsuddenly, \"where is my son?--Edward, Edward!\" and he rushed out of the\nroom, still crying, \"Edward, Edward!\" The name was pronounced in such a\ntone of anguish that the servants ran up.\n\n\"Where is my son?\" asked Villefort; \"let him be removed from the house,\nthat he may not see\"--\n\n\"Master Edward is not down-stairs, sir,\" replied the valet.\n\n\"Then he must be playing in the garden; go and see.\"\n\n\"No, sir; Madame de Villefort sent for him half an hour ago; he went\ninto her room, and has not been down-stairs since.\" A cold perspiration\nburst out on Villefort's brow; his legs trembled, and his thoughts flew\nabout madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch. \"In\nMadame de Villefort's room?\" he murmured and slowly returned, with one\nhand wiping his forehead, and with the other supporting himself\nagainst the wall. To enter the room he must again see the body of his\nunfortunate wife. To call Edward he must reawaken the echo of that room\nwhich now appeared like a sepulchre; to speak seemed like violating the\nsilence of the tomb. His tongue was paralyzed in his mouth.\n\n\"Edward!\" he stammered--\"Edward!\" The child did not answer. Where, then,\ncould he be, if he had entered his mother's room and not since returned?\nHe stepped forward. The corpse of Madame de Villefort was stretched\nacross the doorway leading to the room in which Edward must be; those\nglaring eyes seemed to watch over the threshold, and the lips bore the\nstamp of a terrible and mysterious irony. Through the open door was\nvisible a portion of the boudoir, containing an upright piano and a blue\nsatin couch. Villefort stepped forward two or three paces, and beheld\nhis child lying--no doubt asleep--on the sofa. The unhappy man uttered\nan exclamation of joy; a ray of light seemed to penetrate the abyss of\ndespair and darkness. He had only to step over the corpse, enter the\nboudoir, take the child in his arms, and flee far, far away.\n\nVillefort was no longer the civilized man; he was a tiger hurt unto\ndeath, gnashing his teeth in his wound. He no longer feared realities,\nbut phantoms. He leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning\nbrazier. He took the child in his arms, embraced him, shook him, called\nhim, but the child made no response. He pressed his burning lips to the\ncheeks, but they were icy cold and pale; he felt the stiffened limbs; he\npressed his hand upon the heart, but it no longer beat,--the child\nwas dead. A folded paper fell from Edward's breast. Villefort,\nthunderstruck, fell upon his knees; the child dropped from his arms, and\nrolled on the floor by the side of its mother. He picked up the paper,\nand, recognizing his wife's writing, ran his eyes rapidly over its\ncontents; it ran as follows:--\n\n\"You know that I was a good mother, since it was for my son's sake I\nbecame criminal. A good mother cannot depart without her son.\"\n\nVillefort could not believe his eyes,--he could not believe his reason;\nhe dragged himself towards the child's body, and examined it as a\nlioness contemplates its dead cub. Then a piercing cry escaped from his\nbreast, and he cried, \"Still the hand of God.\" The presence of the\ntwo victims alarmed him; he could not bear solitude shared only by two\ncorpses. Until then he had been sustained by rage, by his strength of\nmind, by despair, by the supreme agony which led the Titans to scale the\nheavens, and Ajax to defy the gods. He now arose, his head bowed beneath\nthe weight of grief, and, shaking his damp, dishevelled hair, he who had\nnever felt compassion for any one determined to seek his father, that he\nmight have some one to whom he could relate his misfortunes,--some one\nby whose side he might weep. He descended the little staircase with\nwhich we are acquainted, and entered Noirtier's room. The old man\nappeared to be listening attentively and as affectionately as his\ninfirmities would allow to the Abbe Busoni, who looked cold and calm, as\nusual. Villefort, perceiving the abbe, passed his hand across his\nbrow. He recollected the call he had made upon him after the dinner at\nAuteuil, and then the visit the abbe had himself paid to his house on\nthe day of Valentine's death. \"You here, sir!\" he exclaimed; \"do you,\nthen, never appear but to act as an escort to death?\"\n\nBusoni turned around, and, perceiving the excitement depicted on the\nmagistrate's face, the savage lustre of his eyes, he understood that\nthe revelation had been made at the assizes; but beyond this he was\nignorant. \"I came to pray over the body of your daughter.\"\n\n\"And now why are you here?\"\n\n\"I come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt, and\nthat from this moment I will pray to God to forgive you, as I do.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" exclaimed Villefort, stepping back fearfully, \"surely\nthat is not the voice of the Abbe Busoni!\"\n\n\"No!\" The abbe threw off his wig, shook his head, and his hair, no\nlonger confined, fell in black masses around his manly face.\n\n\"It is the face of the Count of Monte Cristo!\" exclaimed the procureur,\nwith a haggard expression.\n\n\"You are not exactly right, M. Procureur; you must go farther back.\"\n\n\"That voice, that voice!--where did I first hear it?\"\n\n\"You heard it for the first time at Marseilles, twenty-three years ago,\nthe day of your marriage with Mademoiselle de Saint-Meran. Refer to your\npapers.\"\n\n\"You are not Busoni?--you are not Monte Cristo? Oh, heavens--you are,\nthen, some secret, implacable, and mortal enemy! I must have wronged you\nin some way at Marseilles. Oh, woe to me!\"\n\n\"Yes; you are now on the right path,\" said the count, crossing his arms\nover his broad chest; \"search--search!\"\n\n\"But what have I done to you?\" exclaimed Villefort, whose mind was\nbalancing between reason and insanity, in that cloud which is neither a\ndream nor reality; \"what have I done to you? Tell me, then! Speak!\"\n\n\"You condemned me to a horrible, tedious death; you killed my father;\nyou deprived me of liberty, of love, and happiness.\"\n\n\"Who are you, then? Who are you?\"\n\n\"I am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the Chateau\nd'If. God gave that spectre the form of the Count of Monte Cristo when\nhe at length issued from his tomb, enriched him with gold and diamonds,\nand led him to you!\"\n\n\"Ah, I recognize you--I recognize you!\" exclaimed the king's attorney;\n\"you are\"--\n\n\"I am Edmond Dantes!\"\n\n\"You are Edmond Dantes,\" cried Villefort, seizing the count by the\nwrist; \"then come here!\" And up the stairs he dragged Monte Cristo; who,\nignorant of what had happened, followed him in astonishment, foreseeing\nsome new catastrophe. \"There, Edmond Dantes!\" he said, pointing to the\nbodies of his wife and child, \"see, are you well avenged?\" Monte Cristo\nbecame pale at this horrible sight; he felt that he had passed beyond\nthe bounds of vengeance, and that he could no longer say, \"God is for\nand with me.\" With an expression of indescribable anguish he threw\nhimself upon the body of the child, reopened its eyes, felt its\npulse, and then rushed with him into Valentine's room, of which he\ndouble-locked the door. \"My child,\" cried Villefort, \"he carries away\nthe body of my child! Oh, curses, woe, death to you!\" and he tried to\nfollow Monte Cristo; but as though in a dream he was transfixed to the\nspot,--his eyes glared as though they were starting through the sockets;\nhe griped the flesh on his chest until his nails were stained with\nblood; the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as though they would\nburst their narrow boundary, and deluge his brain with living fire.\nThis lasted several minutes, until the frightful overturn of reason was\naccomplished; then uttering a loud cry followed by a burst of laughter,\nhe rushed down the stairs.\n\nA quarter of an hour afterwards the door of Valentine's room opened, and\nMonte Cristo reappeared. Pale, with a dull eye and heavy heart, all the\nnoble features of that face, usually so calm and serene, were overcast\nby grief. In his arms he held the child, whom no skill had been able to\nrecall to life. Bending on one knee, he placed it reverently by the side\nof its mother, with its head upon her breast. Then, rising, he went\nout, and meeting a servant on the stairs, he asked, \"Where is M. de\nVillefort?\"\n\nThe servant, instead of answering, pointed to the garden. Monte Cristo\nran down the steps, and advancing towards the spot designated beheld\nVillefort, encircled by his servants, with a spade in his hand, and\ndigging the earth with fury. \"It is not here!\" he cried. \"It is not\nhere!\" And then he moved farther on, and began again to dig.\n\nMonte Cristo approached him, and said in a low voice, with an expression\nalmost humble, \"Sir, you have indeed lost a son; but\"--\n\nVillefort interrupted him; he had neither listened nor heard. \"Oh, I\nwill find it,\" he cried; \"you may pretend he is not here, but I will\nfind him, though I dig forever!\" Monte Cristo drew back in horror. \"Oh,\"\nhe said, \"he is mad!\" And as though he feared that the walls of the\naccursed house would crumble around him, he rushed into the street, for\nthe first time doubting whether he had the right to do as he had done.\n\"Oh, enough of this,--enough of this,\" he cried; \"let me save the last.\"\nOn entering his house, he met Morrel, who wandered about like a ghost\nawaiting the heavenly mandate for return to the tomb. \"Prepare yourself,\nMaximilian,\" he said with a smile; \"we leave Paris to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Have you nothing more to do there?\" asked Morrel.\n\n\"No,\" replied Monte Cristo; \"God grant I may not have done too much\nalready.\"\n\nThe next day they indeed left, accompanied only by Baptistin. Haidee had\ntaken away Ali, and Bertuccio remained with Noirtier.\n\n\n\nChapter 112. The Departure.\n\nThe recent event formed the theme of conversation throughout all Paris.\nEmmanuel and his wife conversed with natural astonishment in their\nlittle apartment in the Rue Meslay upon the three successive, sudden,\nand most unexpected catastrophes of Morcerf, Danglars, and Villefort.\nMaximilian, who was paying them a visit, listened to their conversation,\nor rather was present at it, plunged in his accustomed state of apathy.\n\"Indeed,\" said Julie, \"might we not almost fancy, Emmanuel, that\nthose people, so rich, so happy but yesterday, had forgotten in their\nprosperity that an evil genius--like the wicked fairies in Perrault's\nstories who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptism--hovered\nover them, and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal\nneglect?\"\n\n\"What a dire misfortune!\" said Emmanuel, thinking of Morcerf and\nDanglars.\n\n\"What dreadful sufferings!\" said Julie, remembering Valentine, but whom,\nwith a delicacy natural to women, she did not name before her brother.\n\n\"If the Supreme Being has directed the fatal blow,\" said Emmanuel, \"it\nmust be that he in his great goodness has perceived nothing in the past\nlives of these people to merit mitigation of their awful punishment.\"\n\n\"Do you not form a very rash judgment, Emmanuel?\" said Julie. \"When my\nfather, with a pistol in his hand, was once on the point of committing\nsuicide, had any one then said, 'This man deserves his misery,' would\nnot that person have been deceived?\"\n\n\"Yes; but your father was not allowed to fall. A being was commissioned\nto arrest the fatal hand of death about to descend on him.\"\n\nEmmanuel had scarcely uttered these words when the sound of the bell\nwas heard, the well-known signal given by the porter that a visitor had\narrived. Nearly at the same instant the door was opened and the Count of\nMonte Cristo appeared on the threshold. The young people uttered a\ncry of joy, while Maximilian raised his head, but let it fall again\nimmediately. \"Maximilian,\" said the count, without appearing to notice\nthe different impressions which his presence produced on the little\ncircle, \"I come to seek you.\"\n\n\"To seek me?\" repeated Morrel, as if awakening from a dream.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Monte Cristo; \"has it not been agreed that I should take you\nwith me, and did I not tell you yesterday to prepare for departure?\"\n\n\"I am ready,\" said Maximilian; \"I came expressly to wish them farewell.\"\n\n\"Whither are you going, count?\" asked Julie.\n\n\"In the first instance to Marseilles, madame.\"\n\n\"To Marseilles!\" exclaimed the young couple.\n\n\"Yes, and I take your brother with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, count.\" said Julie, \"will you restore him to us cured of his\nmelancholy?\"--Morrel turned away to conceal the confusion of his\ncountenance.\n\n\"You perceive, then, that he is not happy?\" said the count. \"Yes,\"\nreplied the young woman; \"and fear much that he finds our home but a\ndull one.\"\n\n\"I will undertake to divert him,\" replied the count.\n\n\"I am ready to accompany you, sir,\" said Maximilian. \"Adieu, my kind\nfriends! Emmanuel--Julie--farewell!\"\n\n\"How farewell?\" exclaimed Julie; \"do you leave us thus, so suddenly,\nwithout any preparations for your journey, without even a passport?\"\n\n\"Needless delays but increase the grief of parting,\" said Monte\nCristo, \"and Maximilian has doubtless provided himself with everything\nrequisite; at least, I advised him to do so.\"\n\n\"I have a passport, and my clothes are ready packed,\" said Morrel in his\ntranquil but mournful manner.\n\n\"Good,\" said Monte Cristo, smiling; \"in these prompt arrangements we\nrecognize the order of a well-disciplined soldier.\"\n\n\"And you leave us,\" said Julie, \"at a moment's warning? you do not give\nus a day--no, not even an hour before your departure?\"\n\n\"My carriage is at the door, madame, and I must be in Rome in five\ndays.\"\n\n\"But does Maximilian go to Rome?\" exclaimed Emmanuel.\n\n\"I am going wherever it may please the count to take me,\" said Morrel,\nwith a smile full of grief; \"I am under his orders for the next month.\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens, how strangely he expresses himself, count!\" said Julie.\n\n\"Maximilian goes with me,\" said the count, in his kindest and most\npersuasive manner; \"therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your\nbrother's account.\"\n\n\"Once more farewell, my dear sister; Emmanuel, adieu!\" Morrel repeated.\n\n\"His carelessness and indifference touch me to the heart,\" said Julie.\n\"Oh, Maximilian, Maximilian, you are certainly concealing something from\nus.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said Monte Cristo, \"you will see him return to you gay,\nsmiling, and joyful.\"\n\nMaximilian cast a look of disdain, almost of anger, on the count.\n\n\"We must leave you,\" said Monte Cristo.\n\n\"Before you quit us, count,\" said Julie, \"will you permit us to express\nto you all that the other day\"--\n\n\"Madame,\" interrupted the count, taking her two hands in his, \"all that\nyou could say in words would never express what I read in your eyes; the\nthoughts of your heart are fully understood by mine. Like benefactors\nin romances, I should have left you without seeing you again, but that\nwould have been a virtue beyond my strength, because I am a weak\nand vain man, fond of the tender, kind, and thankful glances of my\nfellow-creatures. On the eve of departure I carry my egotism so far as\nto say, 'Do not forget me, my kind friends, for probably you will never\nsee me again.'\"\n\n\"Never see you again?\" exclaimed Emmanuel, while two large tears rolled\ndown Julie's cheeks, \"never behold you again? It is not a man, then, but\nsome angel that leaves us, and this angel is on the point of returning\nto heaven after having appeared on earth to do good.\"\n\n\"Say not so,\" quickly returned Monte Cristo--\"say not so, my friends;\nangels never err, celestial beings remain where they wish to be. Fate is\nnot more powerful than they; it is they who, on the contrary, overcome\nfate. No, Emmanuel, I am but a man, and your admiration is as unmerited\nas your words are sacrilegious.\" And pressing his lips on the hand of\nJulie, who rushed into his arms, he extended his other hand to Emmanuel;\nthen tearing himself from this abode of peace and happiness, he made a\nsign to Maximilian, who followed him passively, with the indifference\nwhich had been perceptible in him ever since the death of Valentine had\nso stunned him. \"Restore my brother to peace and happiness,\" whispered\nJulie to Monte Cristo. And the count pressed her hand in reply, as he\nhad done eleven years before on the staircase leading to Morrel's study.\n\n\"You still confide, then, in Sinbad the Sailor?\" asked he, smiling.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" was the ready answer.\n\n\"Well, then, sleep in peace, and put your trust in heaven.\" As we have\nbefore said, the postchaise was waiting; four powerful horses were\nalready pawing the ground with impatience, while Ali, apparently just\narrived from a long walk, was standing at the foot of the steps, his\nface bathed in perspiration. \"Well,\" asked the count in Arabic, \"have\nyou been to see the old man?\" Ali made a sign in the affirmative.\n\n\"And have you placed the letter before him, as I ordered you to do?\"\n\nThe slave respectfully signalized that he had. \"And what did he say, or\nrather do?\" Ali placed himself in the light, so that his master might\nsee him distinctly, and then imitating in his intelligent manner the\ncountenance of the old man, he closed his eyes, as Noirtier was in the\ncustom of doing when saying \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good; he accepts,\" said Monte Cristo. \"Now let us go.\"\n\nThese words had scarcely escaped him, when the carriage was on its way,\nand the feet of the horses struck a shower of sparks from the pavement.\nMaximilian settled himself in his corner without uttering a word. Half\nan hour had passed when the carriage stopped suddenly; the count had\njust pulled the silken check-string, which was fastened to Ali's finger.\nThe Nubian immediately descended and opened the carriage door. It was\na lovely starlight night--they had just reached the top of the hill\nVillejuif, from whence Paris appears like a sombre sea tossing its\nmillions of phosphoric waves into light--waves indeed more noisy, more\npassionate, more changeable, more furious, more greedy, than those\nof the tempestuous ocean,--waves which never rest as those of the sea\nsometimes do,--waves ever dashing, ever foaming, ever ingulfing what\nfalls within their grasp. The count stood alone, and at a sign from his\nhand, the carriage went on for a short distance. With folded arms, he\ngazed for some time upon the great city. When he had fixed his piercing\nlook on this modern Babylon, which equally engages the contemplation\nof the religious enthusiast, the materialist, and the scoffer,--\"Great\ncity,\" murmured he, inclining his head, and joining his hands as if in\nprayer, \"less than six months have elapsed since first I entered thy\ngates. I believe that the Spirit of God led my steps to thee and that he\nalso enables me to quit thee in triumph; the secret cause of my presence\nwithin thy walls I have confided alone to him who only has had the power\nto read my heart. God only knows that I retire from thee without pride\nor hatred, but not without many regrets; he only knows that the power\nconfided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to\nany useless cause. Oh, great city, it is in thy palpitating bosom that\nI have found that which I sought; like a patient miner, I have dug\ndeep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence. Now my work is\naccomplished, my mission is terminated, now thou canst neither afford me\npain nor pleasure. Adieu, Paris, adieu!\"\n\nHis look wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the\nnight; he passed his hand over his brow, got into the carriage, the door\nwas closed on him, and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the other\nside of the hill in a whirlwind of noise and dust.\n\nTen leagues were passed and not a single word was uttered.\n\nMorrel was dreaming, and Monte Cristo was looking at the dreamer.\n\n\"Morrel,\" said the count to him at length, \"do you repent having\nfollowed me?\"\n\n\"No, count; but to leave Paris\"--\n\n\"If I thought happiness might await you in Paris, Morrel, I would have\nleft you there.\"\n\n\"Valentine reposes within the walls of Paris, and to leave Paris is like\nlosing her a second time.\"\n\n\"Maximilian,\" said the count, \"the friends that we have lost do not\nrepose in the bosom of the earth, but are buried deep in our hearts, and\nit has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them. I\nhave two friends, who in this way never depart from me; the one who gave\nme being, and the other who conferred knowledge and intelligence on me.\nTheir spirits live in me. I consult them when doubtful, and if I ever do\nany good, it is due to their beneficent counsels. Listen to the voice\nof your heart, Morrel, and ask it whether you ought to preserve this\nmelancholy exterior towards me.\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Maximilian, \"the voice of my heart is very sorrowful,\nand promises me nothing but misfortune.\"\n\n\"It is the way of weakened minds to see everything through a black\ncloud. The soul forms its own horizons; your soul is darkened, and\nconsequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising.\"\n\n\"That may possibly be true,\" said Maximilian, and he again subsided into\nhis thoughtful mood.\n\nThe journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the\nunlimited power of the count ever commanded. Towns fled from them like\nshadows on their path, and trees shaken by the first winds of autumn\nseemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them, and retreating\nas rapidly when once reached. The following morning they arrived at\nChalons, where the count's steamboat waited for them. Without the loss\nof an instant, the carriage was placed on board and the two travellers\nembarked without delay. The boat was built for speed; her two\npaddle-wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the water like\na bird. Morrel was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is\ngenerally experienced in passing rapidly through the air, and the wind\nwhich occasionally raised the hair from his forehead seemed on the point\nof dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there.\n\nAs the distance increased between the travellers and Paris, almost\nsuperhuman serenity appeared to surround the count; he might have been\ntaken for an exile about to revisit his native land. Ere long Marseilles\npresented herself to view,--Marseilles, white, fervid, full of life\nand energy,--Marseilles, the younger sister of Tyre and Carthage, the\nsuccessor to them in the empire of the Mediterranean,--Marseilles, old,\nyet always young. Powerful memories were stirred within them by the\nsight of the round tower, Fort Saint-Nicolas, the City Hall designed\nby Puget, [*] the port with its brick quays, where they had both played\nin childhood, and it was with one accord that they stopped on the\nCannebiere. A vessel was setting sail for Algiers, on board of which the\nbustle usually attending departure prevailed. The passengers and their\nrelations crowded on the deck, friends taking a tender but sorrowful\nleave of each other, some weeping, others noisy in their grief, the\nwhole forming a spectacle that might be exciting even to those who\nwitnessed similar sights daily, but which had no power to disturb the\ncurrent of thought that had taken possession of the mind of Maximilian\nfrom the moment he had set foot on the broad pavement of the quay.\n\n     * Pierre Puget, the sculptor-architect, was born at\n     Marseilles in 1622.\n\n\"Here,\" said he, leaning heavily on the arm of Monte Cristo,--\"here is\nthe spot where my father stopped, when the Pharaon entered the port; it\nwas here that the good old man, whom you saved from death and dishonor,\nthrew himself into my arms. I yet feel his warm tears on my face, and\nhis were not the only tears shed, for many who witnessed our meeting\nwept also.\" Monte Cristo gently smiled and said,--\"I was there;\" at the\nsame time pointing to the corner of a street. As he spoke, and in the\nvery direction he indicated, a groan, expressive of bitter grief, was\nheard, and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the\nvessel about to sail. Monte Cristo looked at her with an emotion that\nmust have been remarked by Morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the\nvessel.\n\n\"Oh, heavens!\" exclaimed Morrel, \"I do not deceive myself--that young\nman who is waving his hat, that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant, is\nAlbert de Morcerf!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Monte Cristo, \"I recognized him.\"\n\n\"How so?--you were looking the other way.\" the Count smiled, as he was\nin the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply, and he\nagain turned towards the veiled woman, who soon disappeared at the\ncorner of the street. Turning to his friend,--\"Dear Maximilian,\" said\nthe count, \"have you nothing to do in this land?\"\n\n\"I have to weep over the grave of my father,\" replied Morrel in a broken\nvoice.\n\n\"Well, then, go,--wait for me there, and I will soon join you.\"\n\n\"You leave me, then?\"\n\n\"Yes; I also have a pious visit to pay.\"\n\nMorrel allowed his hand to fall into that which the count extended to\nhim; then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the head he\nquitted the count and bent his steps to the east of the city. Monte\nCristo remained on the same spot until Maximilian was out of sight; he\nthen walked slowly towards the Allees de Meillan to seek out a small\nhouse with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this\nstory. It yet stood, under the shade of the fine avenue of lime-trees,\nwhich forms one of the most frequent walks of the idlers of Marseilles,\ncovered by an immense vine, which spreads its aged and blackened\nbranches over the stone front, burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the\nsouth. Two stone steps worn away by the friction of many feet led to the\ndoor, which was made of three planks; the door had never been painted or\nvarnished, so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to\nclose again when the rains came on. The house, with all its crumbling\nantiquity and apparent misery, was yet cheerful and picturesque, and was\nthe same that old Dantes formerly inhabited--the only difference being\nthat the old man occupied merely the garret, while the whole house was\nnow placed at the command of Mercedes by the count.\n\nThe woman whom the count had seen leave the ship with so much regret\nentered this house; she had scarcely closed the door after her when\nMonte Cristo appeared at the corner of a street, so that he found and\nlost her again almost at the same instant. The worn out steps were old\nacquaintances of his; he knew better than any one else how to open that\nweather-beaten door with the large headed nail which served to raise\nthe latch within. He entered without knocking, or giving any other\nintimation of his presence, as if he had been a friend or the master\nof the place. At the end of a passage paved with bricks, was a little\ngarden, bathed in sunshine, and rich in warmth and light. In this garden\nMercedes had found, at the place indicated by the count, the sum of\nmoney which he, through a sense of delicacy, had described as having\nbeen placed there twenty-four years previously. The trees of the garden\nwere easily seen from the steps of the street-door. Monte Cristo, on\nstepping into the house, heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob; he\nlooked in the direction whence it came, and there under an arbor of\nVirginia jessamine, [*] with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple\nflowers, he saw Mercedes seated, with her head bowed, and weeping\nbitterly. She had raised her veil, and with her face hidden by her hands\nwas giving free scope to the sighs and tears which had been so long\nrestrained by the presence of her son. Monte Cristo advanced a few\nsteps, which were heard on the gravel. Mercedes raised her head, and\nuttered a cry of terror on beholding a man before her.\n\n     * The Carolina--not Virginia--jessamine, gelsemium\n     sempervirens (properly speaking not a jessamine at all) has\n     yellow blossoms. The reference is no doubt to the Wistaria\n     frutescens.--Ed.\n\n\"Madame,\" said the count, \"it is no longer in my power to restore you to\nhappiness, but I offer you consolation; will you deign to accept it as\ncoming from a friend?\"\n\n\"I am, indeed, most wretched,\" replied Mercedes. \"Alone in the world, I\nhad but my son, and he has left me!\"\n\n\"He possesses a noble heart, madame,\" replied the count, \"and he has\nacted rightly. He feels that every man owes a tribute to his country;\nsome contribute their talents, others their industry; these devote their\nblood, those their nightly labors, to the same cause. Had he remained\nwith you, his life must have become a hateful burden, nor would he have\nparticipated in your griefs. He will increase in strength and honor by\nstruggling with adversity, which he will convert into prosperity.\nLeave him to build up the future for you, and I venture to say you will\nconfide it to safe hands.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" replied the wretched woman, mournfully shaking her head, \"the\nprosperity of which you speak, and which, from the bottom of my heart, I\npray God in his mercy to grant him, I can never enjoy. The bitter cup of\nadversity has been drained by me to the very dregs, and I feel that the\ngrave is not far distant. You have acted kindly, count, in bringing me\nback to the place where I have enjoyed so much bliss. I ought to meet\ndeath on the same spot where happiness was once all my own.\"\n\n\"Alas,\" said Monte Cristo, \"your words sear and embitter my heart, the\nmore so as you have every reason to hate me. I have been the cause of\nall your misfortunes; but why do you pity, instead of blaming me? You\nrender me still more unhappy\"--\n\n\"Hate you, blame you--you, Edmond! Hate, reproach, the man that has\nspared my son's life! For was it not your fatal and sanguinary intention\nto destroy that son of whom M. de Morcerf was so proud? Oh, look at me\nclosely, and discover if you can even the semblance of a reproach in\nme.\" The count looked up and fixed his eyes on Mercedes, who arose\npartly from her seat and extended both her hands towards him. \"Oh, look\nat me,\" continued she, with a feeling of profound melancholy, \"my eyes\nno longer dazzle by their brilliancy, for the time has long fled since I\nused to smile on Edmond Dantes, who anxiously looked out for me from\nthe window of yonder garret, then inhabited by his old father. Years\nof grief have created an abyss between those days and the present. I\nneither reproach you nor hate you, my friend. Oh, no, Edmond, it is\nmyself that I blame, myself that I hate! Oh, miserable creature that I\nam!\" cried she, clasping her hands, and raising her eyes to heaven. \"I\nonce possessed piety, innocence, and love, the three ingredients of the\nhappiness of angels, and now what am I?\" Monte Cristo approached her,\nand silently took her hand. \"No,\" said she, withdrawing it gently--\"no,\nmy friend, touch me not. You have spared me, yet of all those who have\nfallen under your vengeance I was the most guilty. They were influenced\nby hatred, by avarice, and by self-love; but I was base, and for want\nof courage acted against my judgment. Nay, do not press my hand, Edmond;\nyou are thinking, I am sure, of some kind speech to console me, but do\nnot utter it to me, reserve it for others more worthy of your kindness.\nSee\" (and she exposed her face completely to view)--\"see, misfortune\nhas silvered my hair, my eyes have shed so many tears that they are\nencircled by a rim of purple, and my brow is wrinkled. You, Edmond, on\nthe contrary,--you are still young, handsome, dignified; it is because\nyou have had faith; because you have had strength, because you have had\ntrust in God, and God has sustained you. But as for me, I have been a\ncoward; I have denied God and he has abandoned me.\"\n\nMercedes burst into tears; her woman's heart was breaking under its load\nof memories. Monte Cristo took her hand and imprinted a kiss on it; but\nshe herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than he would\nhave bestowed on the hand of some marble statue of a saint. \"It often\nhappens,\" continued she, \"that a first fault destroys the prospects of a\nwhole life. I believed you dead; why did I survive you? What good has\nit done me to mourn for you eternally in the secret recesses of my\nheart?--only to make a woman of thirty-nine look like a woman of fifty.\nWhy, having recognized you, and I the only one to do so--why was I able\nto save my son alone? Ought I not also to have rescued the man that I\nhad accepted for a husband, guilty though he were? Yet I let him die!\nWhat do I say? Oh, merciful heavens, was I not accessory to his death by\nmy supine insensibility, by my contempt for him, not remembering, or not\nwilling to remember, that it was for my sake he had become a traitor and\na perjurer? In what am I benefited by accompanying my son so far, since\nI now abandon him, and allow him to depart alone to the baneful climate\nof Africa? Oh, I have been base, cowardly, I tell you; I have abjured\nmy affections, and like all renegades I am of evil omen to those who\nsurround me!\"\n\n\"No, Mercedes,\" said Monte Cristo, \"no; you judge yourself with too\nmuch severity. You are a noble-minded woman, and it was your grief\nthat disarmed me. Still I was but an agent, led on by an invisible and\noffended Deity, who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that I was\ndestined to hurl. I take that God to witness, at whose feet I have\nprostrated myself daily for the last ten years, that I would have\nsacrificed my life to you, and with my life the projects that were\nindissolubly linked with it. But--and I say it with some pride,\nMercedes--God needed me, and I lived. Examine the past and the present,\nand endeavor to dive into futurity, and then say whether I am not a\ndivine instrument. The most dreadful misfortunes, the most frightful\nsufferings, the abandonment of all those who loved me, the persecution\nof those who did not know me, formed the trials of my youth; when\nsuddenly, from captivity, solitude, misery, I was restored to light\nand liberty, and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant,\nso unbounded, so unheard-of, that I must have been blind not to be\nconscious that God had endowed me with it to work out his own great\ndesigns. From that time I looked upon this fortune as something confided\nto me for an especial purpose. Not a thought was given to a life which\nyou once, Mercedes, had the power to render blissful; not one hour\nof peaceful calm was mine; but I felt myself driven on like an\nexterminating angel. Like adventurous captains about to embark on some\nenterprise full of danger, I laid in my provisions, I loaded my weapons,\nI collected every means of attack and defence; I inured my body to the\nmost violent exercises, my soul to the bitterest trials; I taught my\narm to slay, my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings, and my mouth\nto smile at the most horrid spectacles. Good-natured, confiding, and\nforgiving as I had been, I became revengeful, cunning, and wicked, or\nrather, immovable as fate. Then I launched out into the path that was\nopened to me. I overcame every obstacle, and reached the goal; but woe\nto those who stood in my pathway!\"\n\n\"Enough,\" said Mercedes; \"enough, Edmond! Believe me, that she who alone\nrecognized you has been the only one to comprehend you; and had she\ncrossed your path, and you had crushed her like glass, still, Edmond,\nstill she must have admired you! Like the gulf between me and the past,\nthere is an abyss between you, Edmond, and the rest of mankind; and I\ntell you freely that the comparison I draw between you and other men\nwill ever be one of my greatest tortures. No, there is nothing in the\nworld to resemble you in worth and goodness! But we must say farewell,\nEdmond, and let us part.\"\n\n\"Before I leave you, Mercedes, have you no request to make?\" said the\ncount.\n\n\"I desire but one thing in this world, Edmond,--the happiness of my\nson.\"\n\n\"Pray to the Almighty to spare his life, and I will take upon myself to\npromote his happiness.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Edmond.\"\n\n\"But have you no request to make for yourself, Mercedes?\"\n\n\"For myself I want nothing. I live, as it were, between two graves. One\nis that of Edmond Dantes, lost to me long, long since. He had my love!\nThat word ill becomes my faded lip now, but it is a memory dear to my\nheart, and one that I would not lose for all that the world contains.\nThe other grave is that of the man who met his death from the hand of\nEdmond Dantes. I approve of the deed, but I must pray for the dead.\"\n\n\"Your son shall be happy, Mercedes,\" repeated the count.\n\n\"Then I shall enjoy as much happiness as this world can possibly\nconfer.\"\n\n\"But what are your intentions?\"\n\n\"To say that I shall live here, like the Mercedes of other times,\ngaining my bread by labor, would not be true, nor would you believe me.\nI have no longer the strength to do anything but to spend my days in\nprayer. However, I shall have no occasion to work, for the little sum of\nmoney buried by you, and which I found in the place you mentioned, will\nbe sufficient to maintain me. Rumor will probably be busy respecting me,\nmy occupations, my manner of living--that will signify but little.\"\n\n\"Mercedes,\" said the count, \"I do not say it to blame you, but you\nmade an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the fortune\namassed by M. de Morcerf; half of it at least by right belonged to you,\nin virtue of your vigilance and economy.\"\n\n\"I perceive what you are intending to propose to me; but I cannot accept\nit, Edmond--my son would not permit it.\"\n\n\"Nothing shall be done without the full approbation of Albert de\nMorcerf. I will make myself acquainted with his intentions and will\nsubmit to them. But if he be willing to accept my offers, will you\noppose them?\"\n\n\"You well know, Edmond, that I am no longer a reasoning creature; I\nhave no will, unless it be the will never to decide. I have been so\noverwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my head, that I\nam become passive in the hands of the Almighty, like a sparrow in the\ntalons of an eagle. I live, because it is not ordained for me to die. If\nsuccor be sent to me, I will accept it.\"\n\n\"Ah, madame,\" said Monte Cristo, \"you should not talk thus! It is not so\nwe should evince our resignation to the will of heaven; on the contrary,\nwe are all free agents.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" exclaimed Mercedes, \"if it were so, if I possessed free-will,\nbut without the power to render that will efficacious, it would drive me\nto despair.\" Monte Cristo dropped his head and shrank from the vehemence\nof her grief. \"Will you not even say you will see me again?\" he asked.\n\n\"On the contrary, we shall meet again,\" said Mercedes, pointing to\nheaven with solemnity. \"I tell you so to prove to you that I still\nhope.\" And after pressing her own trembling hand upon that of the count,\nMercedes rushed up the stairs and disappeared. Monte Cristo slowly left\nthe house and turned towards the quay. But Mercedes did not witness\nhis departure, although she was seated at the little window of the room\nwhich had been occupied by old Dantes. Her eyes were straining to see\nthe ship which was carrying her son over the vast sea; but still her\nvoice involuntarily murmured softly, \"Edmond, Edmond, Edmond!\"\n\n\n\nChapter 113. The Past.\n\nThe count departed with a sad heart from the house in which he had left\nMercedes, probably never to behold her again. Since the death of little\nEdward a great change had taken place in Monte Cristo. Having reached\nthe summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path, he saw an abyss\nof doubt yawning before him. More than this, the conversation which\nhad just taken place between Mercedes and himself had awakened so many\nrecollections in his heart that he felt it necessary to combat with\nthem. A man of the count's temperament could not long indulge in that\nmelancholy which can exist in common minds, but which destroys superior\nones. He thought he must have made an error in his calculations if he\nnow found cause to blame himself.\n\n\"I cannot have deceived myself,\" he said; \"I must look upon the past in\na false light. What!\" he continued, \"can I have been following a false\npath?--can the end which I proposed be a mistaken end?--can one hour\nhave sufficed to prove to an architect that the work upon which\nhe founded all his hopes was an impossible, if not a sacrilegious,\nundertaking? I cannot reconcile myself to this idea--it would madden\nme. The reason why I am now dissatisfied is that I have not a clear\nappreciation of the past. The past, like the country through which we\nwalk, becomes indistinct as we advance. My position is like that of\na person wounded in a dream; he feels the wound, though he cannot\nrecollect when he received it. Come, then, thou regenerate man,\nthou extravagant prodigal, thou awakened sleeper, thou all-powerful\nvisionary, thou invincible millionaire,--once again review thy past\nlife of starvation and wretchedness, revisit the scenes where fate\nand misfortune conducted, and where despair received thee. Too many\ndiamonds, too much gold and splendor, are now reflected by the mirror in\nwhich Monte Cristo seeks to behold Dantes. Hide thy diamonds, bury thy\ngold, shroud thy splendor, exchange riches for poverty, liberty for a\nprison, a living body for a corpse!\" As he thus reasoned, Monte Cristo\nwalked down the Rue de la Caisserie. It was the same through which,\ntwenty-four years ago, he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal\nguard; the houses, to-day so smiling and animated, were on that night\ndark, mute, and closed. \"And yet they were the same,\" murmured Monte\nCristo, \"only now it is broad daylight instead of night; it is the sun\nwhich brightens the place, and makes it appear so cheerful.\"\n\nHe proceeded towards the quay by the Rue Saint-Laurent, and advanced to\nthe Consigne; it was the point where he had embarked. A pleasure-boat\nwith striped awning was going by. Monte Cristo called the owner, who\nimmediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a\ngood fare. The weather was magnificent, and the excursion a treat.\n\nThe sun, red and flaming, was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming\nocean. The sea, smooth as crystal, was now and then disturbed by the\nleaping of fish, which were pursued by some unseen enemy and sought for\nsafety in another element; while on the extreme verge of the horizon\nmight be seen the fishermen's boats, white and graceful as the sea-gull,\nor the merchant vessels bound for Corsica or Spain.\n\nBut notwithstanding the serene sky, the gracefully formed boats, and\nthe golden light in which the whole scene was bathed, the Count of Monte\nCristo, wrapped in his cloak, could think only of this terrible voyage,\nthe details of which were one by one recalled to his memory. The\nsolitary light burning at the Catalans; that first sight of the Chateau\nd'If, which told him whither they were leading him; the struggle with\nthe gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard; his despair\nwhen he found himself vanquished, and the sensation when the muzzle of\nthe carbine touched his forehead--all these were brought before him\nin vivid and frightful reality. Like the streams which the heat of the\nsummer has dried up, and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin\noozing drop by drop, so did the count feel his heart gradually fill with\nthe bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed Edmond Dantes. Clear\nsky, swift-flitting boats, and brilliant sunshine disappeared; the\nheavens were hung with black, and the gigantic structure of the Chateau\nd'If seemed like the phantom of a mortal enemy. As they reached the\nshore, the count instinctively shrunk to the extreme end of the boat,\nand the owner was obliged to call out, in his sweetest tone of voice,\n\"Sir, we are at the landing.\"\n\nMonte Cristo remembered that on that very spot, on the same rock, he had\nbeen violently dragged by the guards, who forced him to ascend the slope\nat the points of their bayonets. The journey had seemed very long to\nDantes, but Monte Cristo found it equally short. Each stroke of the oar\nseemed to awaken a new throng of ideas, which sprang up with the flying\nspray of the sea.\n\nThere had been no prisoners confined in the Chateau d'If since the\nrevolution of July; it was only inhabited by a guard, kept there for the\nprevention of smuggling. A concierge waited at the door to exhibit to\nvisitors this monument of curiosity, once a scene of terror. The count\ninquired whether any of the ancient jailers were still there; but they\nhad all been pensioned, or had passed on to some other employment. The\nconcierge who attended him had only been there since 1830. He visited\nhis own dungeon. He again beheld the dull light vainly endeavoring to\npenetrate the narrow opening. His eyes rested upon the spot where had\nstood his bed, since then removed, and behind the bed the new stones\nindicated where the breach made by the Abbe Faria had been. Monte Cristo\nfelt his limbs tremble; he seated himself upon a log of wood.\n\n\"Are there any stories connected with this prison besides the one\nrelating to the poisoning of Mirabeau?\" asked the count; \"are there any\ntraditions respecting these dismal abodes,--in which it is difficult to\nbelieve men can ever have imprisoned their fellow-creatures?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; indeed, the jailer Antoine told me one connected with this\nvery dungeon.\"\n\nMonte Cristo shuddered; Antoine had been his jailer. He had almost\nforgotten his name and face, but at the mention of the name he recalled\nhis person as he used to see it, the face encircled by a beard, wearing\nthe brown jacket, the bunch of keys, the jingling of which he still\nseemed to hear. The count turned around, and fancied he saw him in the\ncorridor, rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge.\n\"Would you like to hear the story, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes; relate it,\" said Monte Cristo, pressing his hand to his heart to\nstill its violent beatings; he felt afraid of hearing his own history.\n\n\"This dungeon,\" said the concierge, \"was, it appears, some time ago\noccupied by a very dangerous prisoner, the more so since he was full of\nindustry. Another person was confined in the Chateau at the same time,\nbut he was not wicked, he was only a poor mad priest.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed?--mad!\" repeated Monte Cristo; \"and what was his mania?\"\n\n\"He offered millions to any one who would set him at liberty.\"\n\nMonte Cristo raised his eyes, but he could not see the heavens; there\nwas a stone veil between him and the firmament. He thought that there\nhad been no less thick a veil before the eyes of those to whom Faria\noffered the treasures. \"Could the prisoners see each other?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, no, sir, it was expressly forbidden; but they eluded the vigilance\nof the guards, and made a passage from one dungeon to the other.\"\n\n\"And which of them made this passage?\"\n\n\"Oh, it must have been the young man, certainly, for he was strong and\nindustrious, while the abbe was aged and weak; besides, his mind was too\nvacillating to allow him to carry out an idea.\"\n\n\"Blind fools!\" murmured the count.\n\n\"However, be that as it may, the young man made a tunnel, how or by\nwhat means no one knows; but he made it, and there is the evidence yet\nremaining of his work. Do you see it?\" and the man held the torch to the\nwall.\n\n\"Ah, yes; I see,\" said the count, in a voice hoarse from emotion.\n\n\"The result was that the two men communicated with one another; how long\nthey did so, nobody knows. One day the old man fell ill and died. Now\nguess what the young one did?\"\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\n\"He carried off the corpse, which he placed in his own bed with its face\nto the wall; then he entered the empty dungeon, closed the entrance, and\nslipped into the sack which had contained the dead body. Did you ever\nhear of such an idea?\" Monte Cristo closed his eyes, and seemed again\nto experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas,\nyet moist with the cold dews of death, had touched his face. The jailer\ncontinued: \"Now this was his project. He fancied that they buried the\ndead at the Chateau d'If, and imagining they would not expend much labor\non the grave of a prisoner, he calculated on raising the earth with\nhis shoulders, but unfortunately their arrangements at the Chateau\nfrustrated his projects. They never buried the dead; they merely\nattached a heavy cannon-ball to the feet, and then threw them into the\nsea. This is what was done. The young man was thrown from the top of the\nrock; the corpse was found on the bed next day, and the whole truth was\nguessed, for the men who performed the office then mentioned what they\nhad not dared to speak of before, that at the moment the corpse was\nthrown into the deep, they heard a shriek, which was almost immediately\nstifled by the water in which it disappeared.\" The count breathed with\ndifficulty; the cold drops ran down his forehead, and his heart was full\nof anguish.\n\n\"No,\" he muttered, \"the doubt I felt was but the commencement of\nforgetfulness; but here the wound reopens, and the heart again thirsts\nfor vengeance. And the prisoner,\" he continued aloud, \"was he ever heard\nof afterwards?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; of course not. You can understand that one of two things must\nhave happened; he must either have fallen flat, in which case the blow,\nfrom a height of ninety feet, must have killed him instantly, or he must\nhave fallen upright, and then the weight would have dragged him to the\nbottom, where he remained--poor fellow!\"\n\n\"Then you pity him?\" said the count.\n\n\"Ma foi, yes; though he was in his own element.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"The report was that he had been a naval officer, who had been confined\nfor plotting with the Bonapartists.\"\n\n\"Great is truth,\" muttered the count, \"fire cannot burn, nor water drown\nit! Thus the poor sailor lives in the recollection of those who narrate\nhis history; his terrible story is recited in the chimney-corner, and a\nshudder is felt at the description of his transit through the air to be\nswallowed by the deep.\" Then, the count added aloud, \"Was his name ever\nknown?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; but only as No. 34.\"\n\n\"Oh, Villefort, Villefort,\" murmured the count, \"this scene must often\nhave haunted thy sleepless hours!\"\n\n\"Do you wish to see anything more, sir?\" said the concierge.\n\n\"Yes, especially if you will show me the poor abbe's room.\"\n\n\"Ah--No. 27.\"\n\n\"Yes; No. 27.\" repeated the count, who seemed to hear the voice of the\nabbe answering him in those very words through the wall when asked his\nname.\n\n\"Come, sir.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Monte Cristo, \"I wish to take one final glance around this\nroom.\"\n\n\"This is fortunate,\" said the guide; \"I have forgotten the other key.\"\n\n\"Go and fetch it.\"\n\n\"I will leave you the torch, sir.\"\n\n\"No, take it away; I can see in the dark.\"\n\n\"Why, you are like No. 34. They said he was so accustomed to darkness\nthat he could see a pin in the darkest corner of his dungeon.\"\n\n\"He spent fourteen years to arrive at that,\" muttered the count.\n\nThe guide carried away the torch. The count had spoken correctly.\nScarcely had a few seconds elapsed, ere he saw everything as distinctly\nas by daylight. Then he looked around him, and really recognized his\ndungeon.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"there is the stone upon which I used to sit; there is\nthe impression made by my shoulders on the wall; there is the mark of\nmy blood made when one day I dashed my head against the wall. Oh, those\nfigures, how well I remember them! I made them one day to calculate\nthe age of my father, that I might know whether I should find him still\nliving, and that of Mercedes, to know if I should find her still free.\nAfter finishing that calculation, I had a minute's hope. I did not\nreckon upon hunger and infidelity!\" and a bitter laugh escaped the\ncount. He saw in fancy the burial of his father, and the marriage of\nMercedes. On the other side of the dungeon he perceived an inscription,\nthe white letters of which were still visible on the green wall. \"'O\nGod,'\" he read, \"'preserve my memory!' Oh, yes,\" he cried, \"that was\nmy only prayer at last; I no longer begged for liberty, but memory;\nI dreaded to become mad and forgetful. O God, thou hast preserved my\nmemory; I thank thee, I thank thee!\" At this moment the light of the\ntorch was reflected on the wall; the guide was coming; Monte Cristo went\nto meet him.\n\n\"Follow me, sir;\" and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted\nhim by a subterraneous passage to another entrance. There, again, Monte\nCristo was assailed by a multitude of thoughts. The first thing that\nmet his eye was the meridian, drawn by the abbe on the wall, by which\nhe calculated the time; then he saw the remains of the bed on which\nthe poor prisoner had died. The sight of this, instead of exciting the\nanguish experienced by the count in the dungeon, filled his heart with a\nsoft and grateful sentiment, and tears fell from his eyes.\n\n\"This is where the mad abbe was kept, sir, and that is where the young\nman entered;\" and the guide pointed to the opening, which had remained\nunclosed. \"From the appearance of the stone,\" he continued, \"a learned\ngentleman discovered that the prisoners might have communicated together\nfor ten years. Poor things! Those must have been ten weary years.\"\n\nDantes took some louis from his pocket, and gave them to the man who\nhad twice unconsciously pitied him. The guide took them, thinking them\nmerely a few pieces of little value; but the light of the torch revealed\ntheir true worth. \"Sir,\" he said, \"you have made a mistake; you have\ngiven me gold.\"\n\n\"I know it.\" The concierge looked upon the count with surprise. \"Sir,\"\nhe cried, scarcely able to believe his good fortune--\"sir, I cannot\nunderstand your generosity!\"\n\n\"Oh, it is very simple, my good fellow; I have been a sailor, and your\nstory touched me more than it would others.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, since you are so liberal, I ought to offer you something.\"\n\n\"What have you to offer to me, my friend? Shells? Straw-work? Thank\nyou!\"\n\n\"No, sir, neither of those; something connected with this story.\"\n\n\"Really? What is it?\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said the guide; \"I said to myself, 'Something is always left\nin a cell inhabited by one prisoner for fifteen years,' so I began to\nsound the wall.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" cried Monte Cristo, remembering the abbe's two hiding-places.\n\n\"After some search, I found that the floor gave a hollow sound near the\nhead of the bed, and at the hearth.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the count, \"yes.\"\n\n\"I raised the stones, and found\"--\n\n\"A rope-ladder and some tools?\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" asked the guide in astonishment.\n\n\"I do not know--I only guess it, because that sort of thing is generally\nfound in prisoners' cells.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, a rope-ladder and tools.\"\n\n\"And have you them yet?\"\n\n\"No, sir; I sold them to visitors, who considered them great\ncuriosities; but I have still something left.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the count, impatiently.\n\n\"A sort of book, written upon strips of cloth.\"\n\n\"Go and fetch it, my good fellow; and if it be what I hope, you will do\nwell.\"\n\n\"I will run for it, sir;\" and the guide went out. Then the count knelt\ndown by the side of the bed, which death had converted into an altar.\n\"Oh, second father,\" he exclaimed, \"thou who hast given me liberty,\nknowledge, riches; thou who, like beings of a superior order to\nourselves, couldst understand the science of good and evil; if in the\ndepths of the tomb there still remain something within us which can\nrespond to the voice of those who are left on earth; if after death the\nsoul ever revisit the places where we have lived and suffered,--then,\nnoble heart, sublime soul, then I conjure thee by the paternal love thou\ndidst bear me, by the filial obedience I vowed to thee, grant me some\nsign, some revelation! Remove from me the remains of doubt, which, if\nit change not to conviction, must become remorse!\" The count bowed his\nhead, and clasped his hands together.\n\n\"Here, sir,\" said a voice behind him.\n\nMonte Cristo shuddered, and arose. The concierge held out the strips of\ncloth upon which the Abbe Faria had spread the riches of his mind. The\nmanuscript was the great work by the Abbe Faria upon the kingdoms of\nItaly. The count seized it hastily, his eyes immediately fell upon the\nepigraph, and he read, \"'Thou shalt tear out the dragons' teeth, and\nshall trample the lions under foot, saith the Lord.'\"\n\n\"Ah,\" he exclaimed, \"here is my answer. Thanks, father, thanks.\"\nAnd feeling in his pocket, he took thence a small pocket-book, which\ncontained ten bank-notes, each of 1,000. francs.\n\n\"Here,\" he said, \"take this pocket-book.\"\n\n\"Do you give it to me?\"\n\n\"Yes; but only on condition that you will not open it till I am gone;\"\nand placing in his breast the treasure he had just found, which was more\nvaluable to him than the richest jewel, he rushed out of the corridor,\nand reaching his boat, cried, \"To Marseilles!\" Then, as he departed, he\nfixed his eyes upon the gloomy prison. \"Woe,\" he cried, \"to those who\nconfined me in that wretched prison; and woe to those who forgot that\nI was there!\" As he repassed the Catalans, the count turned around and\nburying his head in his cloak murmured the name of a woman. The victory\nwas complete; twice he had overcome his doubts. The name he pronounced,\nin a voice of tenderness, amounting almost to love, was that of Haidee.\n\nOn landing, the count turned towards the cemetery, where he felt sure of\nfinding Morrel. He, too, ten years ago, had piously sought out a tomb,\nand sought it vainly. He, who returned to France with millions, had been\nunable to find the grave of his father, who had perished from hunger.\nMorrel had indeed placed a cross over the spot, but it had fallen down\nand the grave-digger had burnt it, as he did all the old wood in the\nchurchyard. The worthy merchant had been more fortunate. Dying in the\narms of his children, he had been by them laid by the side of his\nwife, who had preceded him in eternity by two years. Two large slabs of\nmarble, on which were inscribed their names, were placed on either side\nof a little enclosure, railed in, and shaded by four cypress-trees.\nMorrel was leaning against one of these, mechanically fixing his eyes\non the graves. His grief was so profound that he was nearly unconscious.\n\"Maximilian,\" said the count, \"you should not look on the graves, but\nthere;\" and he pointed upwards.\n\n\"The dead are everywhere,\" said Morrel; \"did you not yourself tell me so\nas we left Paris?\"\n\n\"Maximilian,\" said the count, \"you asked me during the journey to allow\nyou to remain some days at Marseilles. Do you still wish to do so?\"\n\n\"I have no wishes, count; only I fancy I could pass the time less\npainfully here than anywhere else.\"\n\n\"So much the better, for I must leave you; but I carry your word with\nme, do I not?\"\n\n\"Ah, count, I shall forget it.\"\n\n\"No, you will not forget it, because you are a man of honor, Morrel,\nbecause you have taken an oath, and are about to do so again.\"\n\n\"Oh, count, have pity upon me. I am so unhappy.\"\n\n\"I have known a man much more unfortunate than you, Morrel.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Alas,\" said Monte Cristo, \"it is the infirmity of our nature always to\nbelieve ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our sides!\"\n\n\"What can be more wretched than the man who has lost all he loved and\ndesired in the world?\"\n\n\"Listen, Morrel, and pay attention to what I am about to tell you. I\nknew a man who like you had fixed all his hopes of happiness upon a\nwoman. He was young, he had an old father whom he loved, a betrothed\nbride whom he adored. He was about to marry her, when one of the\ncaprices of fate,--which would almost make us doubt the goodness of\nprovidence, if that providence did not afterwards reveal itself by\nproving that all is but a means of conducting to an end,--one of those\ncaprices deprived him of his mistress, of the future of which he had\ndreamed (for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the present),\nand cast him into a dungeon.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Morrel, \"one quits a dungeon in a week, a month, or a year.\"\n\n\"He remained there fourteen years, Morrel,\" said the count, placing his\nhand on the young man's shoulder. Maximilian shuddered.\n\n\"Fourteen years!\" he muttered--\"Fourteen years!\" repeated the count.\n\"During that time he had many moments of despair. He also, Morrel, like\nyou, considered himself the unhappiest of men.\"\n\n\"Well?\" asked Morrel.\n\n\"Well, at the height of his despair God assisted him through human\nmeans. At first, perhaps, he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the\nLord, but at last he took patience and waited. One day he miraculously\nleft the prison, transformed, rich, powerful. His first cry was for his\nfather; but that father was dead.\"\n\n\"My father, too, is dead,\" said Morrel.\n\n\"Yes; but your father died in your arms, happy, respected, rich, and\nfull of years; his father died poor, despairing, almost doubtful of\nprovidence; and when his son sought his grave ten years afterwards, his\ntomb had disappeared, and no one could say, 'There sleeps the father you\nso well loved.'\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Morrel.\n\n\"He was, then, a more unhappy son than you, Morrel, for he could not\neven find his father's grave.\"\n\n\"But then he had the woman he loved still remaining?\"\n\n\"You are deceived, Morrel, that woman\"--\n\n\"She was dead?\"\n\n\"Worse than that, she was faithless, and had married one of the\npersecutors of her betrothed. You see, then, Morrel, that he was a more\nunhappy lover than you.\"\n\n\"And has he found consolation?\"\n\n\"He has at least found peace.\"\n\n\"And does he ever expect to be happy?\"\n\n\"He hopes so, Maximilian.\" The young man's head fell on his breast.\n\n\"You have my promise,\" he said, after a minute's pause, extending his\nhand to Monte Cristo. \"Only remember\"--\n\n\"On the 5th of October, Morrel, I shall expect you at the Island of\nMonte Cristo. On the 4th a yacht will wait for you in the port of\nBastia, it will be called the Eurus. You will give your name to the\ncaptain, who will bring you to me. It is understood--is it not?\"\n\n\"But, count, do you remember that the 5th of October\"--\n\n\"Child,\" replied the count, \"not to know the value of a man's word! I\nhave told you twenty times that if you wish to die on that day, I will\nassist you. Morrel, farewell!\"\n\n\"Do you leave me?\"\n\n\"Yes; I have business in Italy. I leave you alone with your misfortunes,\nand with hope, Maximilian.\"\n\n\"When do you leave?\"\n\n\"Immediately; the steamer waits, and in an hour I shall be far from you.\nWill you accompany me to the harbor, Maximilian?\"\n\n\"I am entirely yours, count.\" Morrel accompanied the count to the\nharbor. The white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the\nblack chimney. The steamer soon disappeared, and in an hour afterwards,\nas the count had said, was scarcely distinguishable in the horizon\namidst the fogs of the night.\n\n\n\nChapter 114. Peppino.\n\nAt the same time that the steamer disappeared behind Cape Morgion, a man\ntravelling post on the road from Florence to Rome had just passed the\nlittle town of Aquapendente. He was travelling fast enough to cover a\ngreat deal of ground without exciting suspicion. This man was dressed\nin a greatcoat, or rather a surtout, a little worse for the journey,\nbut which exhibited the ribbon of the Legion of Honor still fresh and\nbrilliant, a decoration which also ornamented the under coat. He might\nbe recognized, not only by these signs, but also from the accent with\nwhich he spoke to the postilion, as a Frenchman. Another proof that he\nwas a native of the universal country was apparent in the fact of his\nknowing no other Italian words than the terms used in music, and\nwhich like the \"goddam\" of Figaro, served all possible linguistic\nrequirements. \"Allegro!\" he called out to the postilions at every\nascent. \"Moderato!\" he cried as they descended. And heaven knows there\nare hills enough between Rome and Florence by the way of Aquapendente!\nThese two words greatly amused the men to whom they were addressed. On\nreaching La Storta, the point from whence Rome is first visible, the\ntraveller evinced none of the enthusiastic curiosity which usually leads\nstrangers to stand up and endeavor to catch sight of the dome of\nSt. Peter's, which may be seen long before any other object is\ndistinguishable. No, he merely drew a pocketbook from his pocket, and\ntook from it a paper folded in four, and after having examined it in a\nmanner almost reverential, he said--\"Good! I have it still!\"\n\nThe carriage entered by the Porto del Popolo, turned to the left, and\nstopped at the Hotel d'Espagne. Old Pastrini, our former acquaintance,\nreceived the traveller at the door, hat in hand. The traveller alighted,\nordered a good dinner, and inquired the address of the house of Thomson\n& French, which was immediately given to him, as it was one of the most\ncelebrated in Rome. It was situated in the Via dei Banchi, near St.\nPeter's. In Rome, as everywhere else, the arrival of a post-chaise is an\nevent. Ten young descendants of Marius and the Gracchi, barefooted and\nout at elbows, with one hand resting on the hip and the other gracefully\ncurved above the head, stared at the traveller, the post-chaise, and the\nhorses; to these were added about fifty little vagabonds from the Papal\nStates, who earned a pittance by diving into the Tiber at high water\nfrom the bridge of St. Angelo. Now, as these street Arabs of Rome,\nmore fortunate than those of Paris, understand every language, more\nespecially the French, they heard the traveller order an apartment, a\ndinner, and finally inquire the way to the house of Thomson & French.\nThe result was that when the new-comer left the hotel with the cicerone,\na man detached himself from the rest of the idlers, and without having\nbeen seen by the traveller, and appearing to excite no attention from\nthe guide, followed the stranger with as much skill as a Parisian police\nagent would have used.\n\nThe Frenchman had been so impatient to reach the house of Thomson &\nFrench that he would not wait for the horses to be harnessed, but left\nword for the carriage to overtake him on the road, or to wait for him\nat the bankers' door. He reached it before the carriage arrived. The\nFrenchman entered, leaving in the anteroom his guide, who immediately\nentered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers\nwho are always to be found in Rome at the doors of banking-houses,\nchurches, museums, or theatres. With the Frenchman, the man who had\nfollowed him entered too; the Frenchman knocked at the inner door, and\nentered the first room; his shadow did the same.\n\n\"Messrs. Thomson & French?\" inquired the stranger.\n\nAn attendant arose at a sign from a confidential clerk at the first\ndesk. \"Whom shall I announce?\" said the attendant.\n\n\"Baron Danglars.\"\n\n\"Follow me,\" said the man. A door opened, through which the attendant\nand the baron disappeared. The man who had followed Danglars sat down on\na bench. The clerk continued to write for the next five minutes; the man\npreserved profound silence, and remained perfectly motionless. Then the\npen of the clerk ceased to move over the paper; he raised his head, and\nappearing to be perfectly sure of privacy,--\"Ah, ha,\" he said, \"here you\nare, Peppino!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" was the laconic reply. \"You have found out that there is\nsomething worth having about this large gentleman?\"\n\n\"There is no great merit due to me, for we were informed of it.\"\n\n\"You know his business here, then.\"\n\n\"Pardieu, he has come to draw, but I don't know how much!\"\n\n\"You will know presently, my friend.\"\n\n\"Very well, only do not give me false information as you did the other\nday.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?--of whom do you speak? Was it the Englishman who\ncarried off 3,000 crowns from here the other day?\"\n\n\"No; he really had 3,000 crowns, and we found them. I mean the Russian\nprince, who you said had 30,000 livres, and we only found 22,000.\"\n\n\"You must have searched badly.\"\n\n\"Luigi Vampa himself searched.\"\n\n\"Indeed? But you must let me make my observations, or the Frenchman will\ntransact his business without my knowing the sum.\" Peppino nodded, and\ntaking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while\nthe clerk disappeared through the same door by which Danglars and the\nattendant had gone out. At the expiration of ten minutes the clerk\nreturned with a beaming countenance. \"Well?\" asked Peppino of his\nfriend.\n\n\"Joy, joy--the sum is large!\"\n\n\"Five or six millions, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, you know the amount.\"\n\n\"On the receipt of the Count of Monte Cristo?\"\n\n\"Why, how came you to be so well acquainted with all this?\"\n\n\"I told you we were informed beforehand.\"\n\n\"Then why do you apply to me?\"\n\n\"That I may be sure I have the right man.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is indeed he. Five millions--a pretty sum, eh, Peppino?\"\n\n\"Hush--here is our man!\" The clerk seized his pen, and Peppino his\nbeads; one was writing and the other praying when the door opened.\nDanglars looked radiant with joy; the banker accompanied him to the\ndoor. Peppino followed Danglars.\n\nAccording to the arrangements, the carriage was waiting at the door. The\nguide held the door open. Guides are useful people, who will turn their\nhands to anything. Danglars leaped into the carriage like a young man of\ntwenty. The cicerone reclosed the door, and sprang up by the side of the\ncoachman. Peppino mounted the seat behind.\n\n\"Will your excellency visit St. Peter's?\" asked the cicerone.\n\n\"I did not come to Rome to see,\" said Danglars aloud; then he added\nsoftly, with an avaricious smile, \"I came to touch!\" and he rapped his\npocket-book, in which he had just placed a letter.\n\n\"Then your excellency is going\"--\n\n\"To the hotel.\"\n\n\"Casa Pastrini!\" said the cicerone to the coachman, and the carriage\ndrove rapidly on. Ten minutes afterwards the baron entered his\napartment, and Peppino stationed himself on the bench outside the door\nof the hotel, after having whispered something in the ear of one of the\ndescendants of Marius and the Gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning\nof the chapter, who immediately ran down the road leading to the Capitol\nat his fullest speed. Danglars was tired and sleepy; he therefore went\nto bed, placing his pocketbook under his pillow. Peppino had a little\nspare time, so he had a game of mora with the facchini, lost three\ncrowns, and then to console himself drank a bottle of Orvieto.\n\nThe next morning Danglars awoke late, though he went to bed so early; he\nhad not slept well for five or six nights, even if he had slept at all.\nHe breakfasted heartily, and caring little, as he said, for the beauties\nof the Eternal City, ordered post-horses at noon. But Danglars had not\nreckoned upon the formalities of the police and the idleness of the\nposting-master. The horses only arrived at two o'clock, and the cicerone\ndid not bring the passport till three. All these preparations had\ncollected a number of idlers round the door of Signor Pastrini's; the\ndescendants of Marius and the Gracchi were also not wanting. The baron\nwalked triumphantly through the crowd, who for the sake of gain styled\nhim \"your excellency.\" As Danglars had hitherto contented himself\nwith being called a baron, he felt rather flattered at the title of\nexcellency, and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars, who\nwere ready, for twelve more, to call him \"your highness.\"\n\n\"Which road?\" asked the postilion in Italian. \"The Ancona road,\" replied\nthe baron. Signor Pastrini interpreted the question and answer, and the\nhorses galloped off. Danglars intended travelling to Venice, where he\nwould receive one part of his fortune, and then proceeding to Vienna,\nwhere he would find the rest, he meant to take up his residence in the\nlatter town, which he had been told was a city of pleasure.\n\nHe had scarcely advanced three leagues out of Rome when daylight began\nto disappear. Danglars had not intended starting so late, or he would\nhave remained; he put his head out and asked the postilion how long\nit would be before they reached the next town. \"Non capisco\" (do not\nunderstand), was the reply. Danglars bent his head, which he meant to\nimply, \"Very well.\" The carriage again moved on. \"I will stop at the\nfirst posting-house,\" said Danglars to himself.\n\nHe still felt the same self-satisfaction which he had experienced the\nprevious evening, and which had procured him so good a night's rest. He\nwas luxuriously stretched in a good English calash, with double springs;\nhe was drawn by four good horses, at full gallop; he knew the relay\nto be at a distance of seven leagues. What subject of meditation could\npresent itself to the banker, so fortunately become bankrupt?\n\nDanglars thought for ten minutes about his wife in Paris; another ten\nminutes about his daughter travelling with Mademoiselle d'Armilly;\nthe same period was given to his creditors, and the manner in which\nhe intended spending their money; and then, having no subject left for\ncontemplation, he shut his eyes, and fell asleep. Now and then a jolt\nmore violent than the rest caused him to open his eyes; then he felt\nthat he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same\ncountry, thickly strewn with broken aqueducts, which looked like granite\ngiants petrified while running a race. But the night was cold, dull, and\nrainy, and it was much more pleasant for a traveller to remain in the\nwarm carriage than to put his head out of the window to make inquiries\nof a postilion whose only answer was \"Non capisco.\"\n\nDanglars therefore continued to sleep, saying to himself that he would\nbe sure to awake at the posting-house. The carriage stopped. Danglars\nfancied that they had reached the long-desired point; he opened his eyes\nand looked through the window, expecting to find himself in the midst\nof some town, or at least village; but he saw nothing except what\nseemed like a ruin, where three or four men went and came like shadows.\nDanglars waited a moment, expecting the postilion to come and demand\npayment with the termination of his stage. He intended taking advantage\nof the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor; but the\nhorses were unharnessed, and others put in their places, without any\none claiming money from the traveller. Danglars, astonished, opened the\ndoor; but a strong hand pushed him back, and the carriage rolled on. The\nbaron was completely roused. \"Eh?\" he said to the postilion, \"eh, mio\ncaro?\"\n\nThis was another little piece of Italian the baron had learned from\nhearing his daughter sing Italian duets with Cavalcanti. But mio caro\ndid not reply. Danglars then opened the window.\n\n\"Come, my friend,\" he said, thrusting his hand through the opening,\n\"where are we going?\"\n\n\"Dentro la testa!\" answered a solemn and imperious voice, accompanied by\na menacing gesture. Danglars thought dentro la testa meant, \"Put in your\nhead!\" He was making rapid progress in Italian. He obeyed, not without\nsome uneasiness, which, momentarily increasing, caused his mind, instead\nof being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey, to fill with\nideas which were very likely to keep a traveller awake, more especially\none in such a situation as Danglars. His eyes acquired that quality\nwhich in the first moment of strong emotion enables them to see\ndistinctly, and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed. Before\nwe are alarmed, we see correctly; when we are alarmed, we see double;\nand when we have been alarmed, we see nothing but trouble. Danglars\nobserved a man in a cloak galloping at the right hand of the carriage.\n\n\"Some gendarme!\" he exclaimed. \"Can I have been intercepted by French\ntelegrams to the pontifical authorities?\" He resolved to end his\nanxiety. \"Where are you taking me?\" he asked. \"Dentro la testa,\" replied\nthe same voice, with the same menacing accent.\n\nDanglars turned to the left; another man on horseback was galloping\non that side. \"Decidedly,\" said Danglars, with the perspiration on his\nforehead, \"I must be under arrest.\" And he threw himself back in the\ncalash, not this time to sleep, but to think. Directly afterwards the\nmoon rose. He then saw the great aqueducts, those stone phantoms which\nhe had before remarked, only then they were on the right hand, now they\nwere on the left. He understood that they had described a circle, and\nwere bringing him back to Rome. \"Oh, unfortunate!\" he cried, \"they\nmust have obtained my arrest.\" The carriage continued to roll on with\nfrightful speed. An hour of terror elapsed, for every spot they passed\nshowed that they were on the road back. At length he saw a dark mass,\nagainst which it seemed as if the carriage was about to dash; but the\nvehicle turned to one side, leaving the barrier behind and Danglars saw\nthat it was one of the ramparts encircling Rome.\n\n\"Mon dieu!\" cried Danglars, \"we are not returning to Rome; then it\nis not justice which is pursuing me! Gracious heavens; another idea\npresents itself--what if they should be\"--\n\nHis hair stood on end. He remembered those interesting stories, so\nlittle believed in Paris, respecting Roman bandits; he remembered the\nadventures that Albert de Morcerf had related when it was intended that\nhe should marry Mademoiselle Eugenie. \"They are robbers, perhaps,\" he\nmuttered. Just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel\nroad. Danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road, and perceived\nmonuments of a singular form, and his mind now recalled all the details\nMorcerf had related, and comparing them with his own situation, he\nfelt sure that he must be on the Appian Way. On the left, in a sort of\nvalley, he perceived a circular excavation. It was Caracalla's circus.\nOn a word from the man who rode at the side of the carriage, it stopped.\nAt the same time the door was opened. \"Scendi!\" exclaimed a commanding\nvoice. Danglars instantly descended; although he did not yet speak\nItalian, he understood it very well. More dead than alive, he looked\naround him. Four men surrounded him, besides the postilion.\n\n\"Di qua,\" said one of the men, descending a little path leading out of\nthe Appian Way. Danglars followed his guide without opposition, and\nhad no occasion to turn around to see whether the three others were\nfollowing him. Still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal\ndistances from one another, like sentinels. After walking for about ten\nminutes, during which Danglars did not exchange a single word with his\nguide, he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds;\nthree men, standing silent, formed a triangle, of which he was the\ncentre. He wished to speak, but his tongue refused to move. \"Avanti!\"\nsaid the same sharp and imperative voice.\n\nThis time Danglars had double reason to understand, for if the word\nand gesture had not explained the speaker's meaning, it was clearly\nexpressed by the man walking behind him, who pushed him so rudely that\nhe struck against the guide. This guide was our friend Peppino, who\ndashed into the thicket of high weeds, through a path which none but\nlizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open road. Peppino\nstopped before a pit overhung by thick hedges; the pit, half open,\nafforded a passage to the young man, who disappeared like the evil\nspirits in the fairy tales. The voice and gesture of the man who\nfollowed Danglars ordered him to do the same. There was no longer\nany doubt, the bankrupt was in the hands of Roman banditti. Danglars\nacquitted himself like a man placed between two dangerous positions,\nand who is rendered brave by fear. Notwithstanding his large stomach,\ncertainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the Campagna, he\nslid down like Peppino, and closing his eyes fell upon his feet. As he\ntouched the ground, he opened his eyes. The path was wide, but dark.\nPeppino, who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his\nown territories, struck a light and lit a torch. Two other men descended\nafter Danglars forming the rearguard, and pushing Danglars whenever he\nhappened to stop, they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of\ntwo corridors. The walls were hollowed out in sepulchres, one above the\nother, and which seemed in contrast with the white stones to open their\nlarge dark eyes, like those which we see on the faces of the dead. A\nsentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left hand. \"Who\ncomes there?\" he cried.\n\n\"A friend, a friend!\" said Peppino; \"but where is the captain?\"\n\n\"There,\" said the sentinel, pointing over his shoulder to a spacious\ncrypt, hollowed out of the rock, the lights from which shone into the\npassage through the large arched openings. \"Fine spoil, captain, fine\nspoil!\" said Peppino in Italian, and taking Danglars by the collar of\nhis coat he dragged him to an opening resembling a door, through which\nthey entered the apartment which the captain appeared to have made his\ndwelling-place.\n\n\"Is this the man?\" asked the captain, who was attentively reading\nPlutarch's \"Life of Alexander.\"\n\n\"Himself, captain--himself.\"\n\n\"Very well, show him to me.\" At this rather impertinent order, Peppino\nraised his torch to the face of Danglars, who hastily withdrew that he\nmight not have his eyelashes burnt. His agitated features presented\nthe appearance of pale and hideous terror. \"The man is tired,\" said the\ncaptain, \"conduct him to his bed.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" murmured Danglars, \"that bed is probably one of the coffins\nhollowed in the wall, and the sleep I shall enjoy will be death from one\nof the poniards I see glistening in the darkness.\"\n\nFrom their beds of dried leaves or wolf-skins at the back of the chamber\nnow arose the companions of the man who had been found by Albert de\nMorcerf reading \"Caesar's Commentaries,\" and by Danglars studying the\n\"Life of Alexander.\" The banker uttered a groan and followed his guide;\nhe neither supplicated nor exclaimed. He no longer possessed strength,\nwill, power, or feeling; he followed where they led him. At length he\nfound himself at the foot of a staircase, and he mechanically lifted\nhis foot five or six times. Then a low door was opened before him, and\nbending his head to avoid striking his forehead he entered a small room\ncut out of the rock. The cell was clean, though empty, and dry, though\nsituated at an immeasurable distance under the earth. A bed of dried\ngrass covered with goat-skins was placed in one corner. Danglars\nbrightened up on beholding it, fancying that it gave some promise of\nsafety. \"Oh, God be praised,\" he said; \"it is a real bed!\"\n\n\"Ecco!\" said the guide, and pushing Danglars into the cell, he closed\nthe door upon him. A bolt grated and Danglars was a prisoner. If there\nhad been no bolt, it would have been impossible for him to pass through\nthe midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of St. Sebastian,\nencamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the\nfamous Luigi Vampa. Danglars, too, had recognized the bandit, whose\nexistence he would not believe when Albert de Morcerf mentioned him in\nParis; and not only did he recognize him, but the cell in which Albert\nhad been confined, and which was probably kept for the accommodation\nof strangers. These recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure\nby Danglars, and restored him to some degree of tranquillity. Since the\nbandits had not despatched him at once, he felt that they would not kill\nhim at all. They had arrested him for the purpose of robbery, and as he\nhad only a few louis about him, he doubted not he would be ransomed.\nHe remembered that Morcerf had been taxed at 4,000 crowns, and as he\nconsidered himself of much greater importance than Morcerf he fixed\nhis own price at 8,000 crowns. Eight thousand crowns amounted to 48,000\nlivres; he would then have about 5,050,000 francs left. With this sum he\ncould manage to keep out of difficulties. Therefore, tolerably secure in\nbeing able to extricate himself from his position, provided he were not\nrated at the unreasonable sum of 5,050,000 francs, he stretched himself\non his bed, and after turning over two or three times, fell asleep with\nthe tranquillity of the hero whose life Luigi Vampa was studying.\n\n\n\nChapter 115. Luigi Vampa's Bill of Fare.\n\nWe awake from every sleep except the one dreaded by Danglars. He awoke.\nTo a Parisian accustomed to silken curtains, walls hung with velvet\ndrapery, and the soft perfume of burning wood, the white smoke of which\ndiffuses itself in graceful curves around the room, the appearance of\nthe whitewashed cell which greeted his eyes on awakening seemed like\nthe continuation of some disagreeable dream. But in such a situation\na single moment suffices to change the strongest doubt into certainty.\n\"Yes, yes,\" he murmured, \"I am in the hands of the brigands of whom\nAlbert de Morcerf spoke.\" His first idea was to breathe, that he might\nknow whether he was wounded. He borrowed this from \"Don Quixote,\" the\nonly book he had ever read, but which he still slightly remembered.\n\n\"No,\" he cried, \"they have not wounded, but perhaps they have robbed\nme!\" and he thrust his hands into his pockets. They were untouched; the\nhundred louis he had reserved for his journey from Rome to Venice were\nin his trousers pocket, and in that of his great-coat he found the\nlittle note-case containing his letter of credit for 5,050,000 francs.\n\"Singular bandits!\" he exclaimed; \"they have left me my purse and\npocket-book. As I was saying last night, they intend me to be ransomed.\nHallo, here is my watch! Let me see what time it is.\" Danglars' watch,\none of Breguet's repeaters, which he had carefully wound up on the\nprevious night, struck half past five. Without this, Danglars would have\nbeen quite ignorant of the time, for daylight did not reach his cell.\nShould he demand an explanation from the bandits, or should he wait\npatiently for them to propose it? The last alternative seemed the most\nprudent, so he waited until twelve o'clock. During all this time a\nsentinel, who had been relieved at eight o'clock, had been watching his\ndoor. Danglars suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the person who\nkept watch over him. He had noticed that a few rays, not of daylight,\nbut from a lamp, penetrated through the ill-joined planks of the door;\nhe approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful\nof brandy, which, owing to the leathern bottle containing it, sent\nforth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to Danglars. \"Faugh!\" he\nexclaimed, retreating to the farther corner of his cell.\n\nAt twelve this man was replaced by another functionary, and Danglars,\nwishing to catch sight of his new guardian, approached the door again.\nHe was an athletic, gigantic bandit, with large eyes, thick lips, and\na flat nose; his red hair fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around\nhis shoulders. \"Ah, ha,\" cried Danglars, \"this fellow is more like an\nogre than anything else; however, I am rather too old and tough to be\nvery good eating!\" We see that Danglars was collected enough to jest; at\nthe same time, as though to disprove the ogreish propensities, the man\ntook some black bread, cheese, and onions from his wallet, which he\nbegan devouring voraciously. \"May I be hanged,\" said Danglars, glancing\nat the bandit's dinner through the crevices of the door,--\"may I be\nhanged if I can understand how people can eat such filth!\" and he\nwithdrew to seat himself upon his goat-skin, which reminded him of the\nsmell of the brandy.\n\nBut the mysteries of nature are incomprehensible, and there are certain\ninvitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very\nirresistibly to a fasting stomach. Danglars felt his own not to be very\nwell supplied just then, and gradually the man appeared less ugly, the\nbread less black, and the cheese more fresh, while those dreadful vulgar\nonions recalled to his mind certain sauces and side-dishes, which his\ncook prepared in a very superior manner whenever he said, \"Monsieur\nDeniseau, let me have a nice little fricassee to-day.\" He got up and\nknocked on the door; the bandit raised his head. Danglars knew that\nhe was heard, so he redoubled his blows. \"Che cosa?\" asked the bandit.\n\"Come, come,\" said Danglars, tapping his fingers against the door, \"I\nthink it is quite time to think of giving me something to eat!\" But\nwhether he did not understand him, or whether he had received no orders\nrespecting the nourishment of Danglars, the giant, without answering,\nwent on with his dinner. Danglars' feelings were hurt, and not wishing\nto put himself under obligations to the brute, the banker threw himself\ndown again on his goat-skin and did not breathe another word.\n\nFour hours passed by and the giant was replaced by another bandit.\nDanglars, who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the stomach,\narose softly, again applied his eye to the crack of the door, and\nrecognized the intelligent countenance of his guide. It was, indeed,\nPeppino who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by\nseating himself opposite to the door, and placing between his legs an\nearthen pan, containing chick-pease stewed with bacon. Near the pan he\nalso placed a pretty little basket of Villetri grapes and a flask\nof Orvieto. Peppino was decidedly an epicure. Danglars watched these\npreparations and his mouth watered. \"Come,\" he said to himself, \"let me\ntry if he will be more tractable than the other;\" and he tapped gently\nat the door. \"On y va,\" (coming) exclaimed Peppino, who from frequenting\nthe house of Signor Pastrini understood French perfectly in all its\nidioms.\n\nDanglars immediately recognized him as the man who had called out in\nsuch a furious manner, \"Put in your head!\" But this was not the time for\nrecrimination, so he assumed his most agreeable manner and said with a\ngracious smile,--\"Excuse me, sir, but are they not going to give me any\ndinner?\"\n\n\"Does your excellency happen to be hungry?\"\n\n\"Happen to be hungry,--that's pretty good, when I haven't eaten for\ntwenty-four hours!\" muttered Danglars. Then he added aloud, \"Yes, sir, I\nam hungry--very hungry.\"\n\n\"What would your excellency like?\" and Peppino placed his pan on the\nground, so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of Danglars.\n\"Give your orders.\"\n\n\"Have you kitchens here?\"\n\n\"Kitchens?--of course--complete ones.\"\n\n\"And cooks?\"\n\n\"Excellent!\"\n\n\"Well, a fowl, fish, game,--it signifies little, so that I eat.\"\n\n\"As your excellency pleases. You mentioned a fowl, I think?\"\n\n\"Yes, a fowl.\" Peppino, turning around, shouted, \"A fowl for his\nexcellency!\" His voice yet echoed in the archway when a handsome,\ngraceful, and half-naked young man appeared, bearing a fowl in a silver\ndish on his head, without the assistance of his hands. \"I could almost\nbelieve myself at the Cafe de Paris,\" murmured Danglars.\n\n\"Here, your excellency,\" said Peppino, taking the fowl from the young\nbandit and placing it on the worm-eaten table, which with the stool\nand the goat-skin bed formed the entire furniture of the cell. Danglars\nasked for a knife and fork. \"Here, excellency,\" said Peppino, offering\nhim a little blunt knife and a boxwood fork. Danglars took the knife in\none hand and the fork in the other, and was about to cut up the fowl.\n\"Pardon me, excellency,\" said Peppino, placing his hand on the banker's\nshoulder; \"people pay here before they eat. They might not be satisfied,\nand\"--\n\n\"Ah, ha,\" thought Danglars, \"this is not so much like Paris, except that\nI shall probably be skinned! Never mind, I'll fix that all right. I have\nalways heard how cheap poultry is in Italy; I should think a fowl is\nworth about twelve sous at Rome.--There,\" he said, throwing a louis\ndown. Peppino picked up the louis, and Danglars again prepared to carve\nthe fowl. \"Stay a moment, your excellency,\" said Peppino, rising; \"you\nstill owe me something.\"\n\n\"I said they would skin me,\" thought Danglars; but resolving to resist\nthe extortion, he said, \"Come, how much do I owe you for this fowl?\"\n\n\"Your excellency has given me a louis on account.\"\n\n\"A louis on account for a fowl?\"\n\n\"Certainly; and your excellency now owes me 4,999 louis.\" Danglars\nopened his enormous eyes on hearing this gigantic joke. \"Come, come,\nthis is very droll--very amusing--I allow; but, as I am very hungry,\npray allow me to eat. Stay, here is another louis for you.\"\n\n\"Then that will make only 4,998 louis more,\" said Peppino with the same\nindifference. \"I shall get them all in time.\"\n\n\"Oh, as for that,\" said Danglars, angry at this prolongation of the\njest,--\"as for that you won't get them at all. Go to the devil! You do\nnot know with whom you have to deal!\" Peppino made a sign, and the youth\nhastily removed the fowl. Danglars threw himself upon his goat-skin,\nand Peppino, reclosing the door, again began eating his pease and bacon.\nThough Danglars could not see Peppino, the noise of his teeth allowed\nno doubt as to his occupation. He was certainly eating, and noisily too,\nlike an ill-bred man. \"Brute!\" said Danglars. Peppino pretended not to\nhear him, and without even turning his head continued to eat slowly.\nDanglars' stomach felt so empty, that it seemed as if it would be\nimpossible ever to fill it again; still he had patience for another\nhalf-hour, which appeared to him like a century. He again arose and went\nto the door. \"Come, sir, do not keep me starving here any longer, but\ntell me what they want.\"\n\n\"Nay, your excellency, it is you who should tell us what you want. Give\nyour orders, and we will execute them.\"\n\n\"Then open the door directly.\" Peppino obeyed. \"Now look here, I want\nsomething to eat! To eat--do you hear?\"\n\n\"Are you hungry?\"\n\n\"Come, you understand me.\"\n\n\"What would your excellency like to eat?\"\n\n\"A piece of dry bread, since the fowls are beyond all price in this\naccursed place.\"\n\n\"Bread? Very well. Hallo, there, some bread!\" he called. The youth\nbrought a small loaf. \"How much?\" asked Danglars.\n\n\"Four thousand nine hundred and ninety-eight louis,\" said Peppino; \"You\nhave paid two louis in advance.\"\n\n\"What? One hundred thousand francs for a loaf?\"\n\n\"One hundred thousand francs,\" repeated Peppino.\n\n\"But you only asked 100,000 francs for a fowl!\"\n\n\"We have a fixed price for all our provisions. It signifies nothing\nwhether you eat much or little--whether you have ten dishes or one--it\nis always the same price.\"\n\n\"What, still keeping up this silly jest? My dear fellow, it is perfectly\nridiculous--stupid! You had better tell me at once that you intend\nstarving me to death.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no, your excellency, unless you intend to commit suicide. Pay\nand eat.\"\n\n\"And what am I to pay with, brute?\" said Danglars, enraged. \"Do you\nsuppose I carry 100,000 francs in my pocket?\"\n\n\"Your excellency has 5,050,000 francs in your pocket; that will be fifty\nfowls at 100,000 francs apiece, and half a fowl for the 50,000.\"\n\nDanglars shuddered. The bandage fell from his eyes, and he understood\nthe joke, which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just\nbefore. \"Come,\" he said, \"if I pay you the 100,000 francs, will you be\nsatisfied, and allow me to eat at my ease?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Peppino.\n\n\"But how can I pay them?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing easier; you have an account open with Messrs. Thomson &\nFrench, Via dei Banchi, Rome; give me a draft for 4,998 louis on these\ngentlemen, and our banker shall take it.\" Danglars thought it as well\nto comply with a good grace, so he took the pen, ink, and paper Peppino\noffered him, wrote the draft, and signed it. \"Here,\" he said, \"here is a\ndraft at sight.\"\n\n\"And here is your fowl.\" Danglars sighed while he carved the fowl;\nit appeared very thin for the price it had cost. As for Peppino, he\nexamined the paper attentively, put it into his pocket, and continued\neating his pease.\n\n\n\nChapter 116. The Pardon.\n\nThe next day Danglars was again hungry; certainly the air of that\ndungeon was very provocative of appetite. The prisoner expected that\nhe would be at no expense that day, for like an economical man he had\nconcealed half of his fowl and a piece of the bread in the corner of his\ncell. But he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty; he had forgotten\nthat. He struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the\nroof of his mouth; then, no longer able to resist, he called out. The\nsentinel opened the door; it was a new face. He thought it would be\nbetter to transact business with his old acquaintance, so he sent for\nPeppino. \"Here I am, your excellency,\" said Peppino, with an eagerness\nwhich Danglars thought favorable to him. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Something to drink.\"\n\n\"Your excellency knows that wine is beyond all price near Rome.\"\n\n\"Then give me water,\" cried Danglars, endeavoring to parry the blow.\n\n\"Oh, water is even more scarce than wine, your excellency,--there has\nbeen such a drought.\"\n\n\"Come,\" thought Danglars, \"it is the same old story.\" And while he\nsmiled as he attempted to regard the affair as a joke, he felt his\ntemples get moist with perspiration.\n\n\"Come, my friend,\" said Danglars, seeing that he made no impression on\nPeppino, \"you will not refuse me a glass of wine?\"\n\n\"I have already told you that we do not sell at retail.\"\n\n\"Well, then, let me have a bottle of the least expensive.\"\n\n\"They are all the same price.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"Twenty-five thousand francs a bottle.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" cried Danglars, in a tone whose bitterness Harpagon [*] alone\nhas been capable of revealing--\"tell me that you wish to despoil me of\nall; it will be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal.\"\n\n     * The miser in Moliere's comedy of \"L'Avare.\"--Ed.\n\n\"It is possible such may be the master's intention.\"\n\n\"The master?--who is he?\"\n\n\"The person to whom you were conducted yesterday.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"Here.\"\n\n\"Let me see him.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\" And the next moment Luigi Vampa appeared before Danglars.\n\n\"You sent for me?\" he said to the prisoner.\n\n\"Are you, sir, the chief of the people who brought me here?\"\n\n\"Yes, your excellency. What then?\"\n\n\"How much do you require for my ransom?\"\n\n\"Merely the 5,000,000 you have about you.\" Danglars felt a dreadful\nspasm dart through his heart. \"But this is all I have left in the\nworld,\" he said, \"out of an immense fortune. If you deprive me of that,\ntake away my life also.\"\n\n\"We are forbidden to shed your blood.\"\n\n\"And by whom are you forbidden?\"\n\n\"By him we obey.\"\n\n\"You do, then, obey some one?\"\n\n\"Yes, a chief.\"\n\n\"I thought you said you were the chief?\"\n\n\"So I am of these men; but there is another over me.\"\n\n\"And did your superior order you to treat me in this way?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But my purse will be exhausted.\"\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Danglars, \"will you take a million?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Two millions?--three?--four? Come, four? I will give them to you on\ncondition that you let me go.\"\n\n\"Why do you offer me 4,000,000 for what is worth 5,000,000? This is a\nkind of usury, banker, that I do not understand.\"\n\n\"Take all, then--take all, I tell you, and kill me!\"\n\n\"Come, come, calm yourself. You will excite your blood, and that would\nproduce an appetite it would require a million a day to satisfy. Be more\neconomical.\"\n\n\"But when I have no more money left to pay you?\" asked the infuriated\nDanglars.\n\n\"Then you must suffer hunger.\"\n\n\"Suffer hunger?\" said Danglars, becoming pale.\n\n\"Most likely,\" replied Vampa coolly.\n\n\"But you say you do not wish to kill me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And yet you will let me perish with hunger?\"\n\n\"Ah, that is a different thing.\"\n\n\"Well, then, wretches,\" cried Danglars, \"I will defy your infamous\ncalculations--I would rather die at once! You may torture, torment, kill\nme, but you shall not have my signature again!\"\n\n\"As your excellency pleases,\" said Vampa, as he left the cell. Danglars,\nraving, threw himself on the goat-skin. Who could these men be? Who was\nthe invisible chief? What could be his intentions towards him? And why,\nwhen every one else was allowed to be ransomed, might he not also be?\nOh, yes; certainly a speedy, violent death would be a fine means of\ndeceiving these remorseless enemies, who appeared to pursue him with\nsuch incomprehensible vengeance. But to die? For the first time in his\nlife, Danglars contemplated death with a mixture of dread and desire;\nthe time had come when the implacable spectre, which exists in the mind\nof every human creature, arrested his attention and called out with\nevery pulsation of his heart, \"Thou shalt die!\"\n\nDanglars resembled a timid animal excited in the chase; first it flies,\nthen despairs, and at last, by the very force of desperation, sometimes\nsucceeds in eluding its pursuers. Danglars meditated an escape; but the\nwalls were solid rock, a man was sitting reading at the only outlet to\nthe cell, and behind that man shapes armed with guns continually passed.\nHis resolution not to sign lasted two days, after which he offered a\nmillion for some food. They sent him a magnificent supper, and took his\nmillion.\n\nFrom this time the prisoner resolved to suffer no longer, but to have\neverything he wanted. At the end of twelve days, after having made a\nsplendid dinner, he reckoned his accounts, and found that he had only\n50,000 francs left. Then a strange reaction took place; he who had just\nabandoned 5,000,000 endeavored to save the 50,000 francs he had left,\nand sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a life of\nprivation--he was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of\nmadness. He who for so long a time had forgotten God, began to\nthink that miracles were possible--that the accursed cavern might be\ndiscovered by the officers of the Papal States, who would release him;\nthat then he would have 50,000 remaining, which would be sufficient to\nsave him from starvation; and finally he prayed that this sum might\nbe preserved to him, and as he prayed he wept. Three days passed thus,\nduring which his prayers were frequent, if not heartfelt. Sometimes he\nwas delirious, and fancied he saw an old man stretched on a pallet; he,\nalso, was dying of hunger.\n\nOn the fourth, he was no longer a man, but a living corpse. He had\npicked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals, and was\nbeginning to eat the matting which covered the floor of his cell. Then\nhe entreated Peppino, as he would a guardian angel, to give him food;\nhe offered him 1,000 francs for a mouthful of bread. But Peppino did not\nanswer. On the fifth day he dragged himself to the door of the cell.\n\n\"Are you not a Christian?\" he said, falling on his knees. \"Do you wish\nto assassinate a man who, in the eyes of heaven, is a brother? Oh, my\nformer friends, my former friends!\" he murmured, and fell with his face\nto the ground. Then rising in despair, he exclaimed, \"The chief, the\nchief!\"\n\n\"Here I am,\" said Vampa, instantly appearing; \"what do you want?\"\n\n\"Take my last gold,\" muttered Danglars, holding out his pocket-book,\n\"and let me live here; I ask no more for liberty--I only ask to live!\"\n\n\"Then you suffer a great deal?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes, cruelly!\"\n\n\"Still, there have been men who suffered more than you.\"\n\n\"I do not think so.\"\n\n\"Yes; those who have died of hunger.\"\n\nDanglars thought of the old man whom, in his hours of delirium, he\nhad seen groaning on his bed. He struck his forehead on the ground and\ngroaned. \"Yes,\" he said, \"there have been some who have suffered more\nthan I have, but then they must have been martyrs at least.\"\n\n\"Do you repent?\" asked a deep, solemn voice, which caused Danglars' hair\nto stand on end. His feeble eyes endeavored to distinguish objects, and\nbehind the bandit he saw a man enveloped in a cloak, half lost in the\nshadow of a stone column.\n\n\"Of what must I repent?\" stammered Danglars.\n\n\"Of the evil you have done,\" said the voice.\n\n\"Oh, yes; oh, yes, I do indeed repent.\" And he struck his breast with\nhis emaciated fist.\n\n\"Then I forgive you,\" said the man, dropping his cloak, and advancing to\nthe light.\n\n\"The Count of Monte Cristo!\" said Danglars, more pale from terror than\nhe had been just before from hunger and misery.\n\n\"You are mistaken--I am not the Count of Monte Cristo.\"\n\n\"Then who are you?\"\n\n\"I am he whom you sold and dishonored--I am he whose betrothed you\nprostituted--I am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise\nyourself to fortune--I am he whose father you condemned to die of\nhunger--I am he whom you also condemned to starvation, and who yet\nforgives you, because he hopes to be forgiven--I am Edmond Dantes!\"\nDanglars uttered a cry, and fell prostrate. \"Rise,\" said the count,\n\"your life is safe; the same good fortune has not happened to your\naccomplices--one is mad, the other dead. Keep the 50,000 francs you have\nleft--I give them to you. The 5,000,000 you stole from the hospitals has\nbeen restored to them by an unknown hand. And now eat and drink; I will\nentertain you to-night. Vampa, when this man is satisfied, let him be\nfree.\" Danglars remained prostrate while the count withdrew; when he\nraised his head he saw disappearing down the passage nothing but\na shadow, before which the bandits bowed. According to the count's\ndirections, Danglars was waited on by Vampa, who brought him the best\nwine and fruits of Italy; then, having conducted him to the road, and\npointed to the post-chaise, left him leaning against a tree. He remained\nthere all night, not knowing where he was. When daylight dawned he saw\nthat he was near a stream; he was thirsty, and dragged himself towards\nit. As he stooped down to drink, he saw that his hair had become\nentirely white.\n\n\n\nChapter 117. The Fifth of October.\n\nIt was about six o'clock in the evening; an opal-colored light, through\nwhich an autumnal sun shed its golden rays, descended on the blue ocean.\nThe heat of the day had gradually decreased, and a light breeze arose,\nseeming like the respiration of nature on awakening from the burning\nsiesta of the south. A delicious zephyr played along the coasts of\nthe Mediterranean, and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume of\nplants, mingled with the fresh smell of the sea.\n\nA light yacht, chaste and elegant in its form, was gliding amidst the\nfirst dews of night over the immense lake, extending from Gibraltar to\nthe Dardanelles, and from Tunis to Venice. The vessel resembled a\nswan with its wings opened towards the wind, gliding on the water. It\nadvanced swiftly and gracefully, leaving behind it a glittering stretch\nof foam. By degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon; but\nas though to prove the truth of the fanciful ideas in heathen mythology,\nits indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave, as if the\ngod of fire had just sunk upon the bosom of Amphitrite, who in vain\nendeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle. The yacht moved\nrapidly on, though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to ruffle\nthe curls on the head of a young girl. Standing on the prow was a tall\nman, of a dark complexion, who saw with dilating eyes that they were\napproaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone, which rose\nfrom the midst of the waves like the hat of a Catalan. \"Is that Monte\nCristo?\" asked the traveller, to whose orders the yacht was for the time\nsubmitted, in a melancholy voice.\n\n\"Yes, your excellency,\" said the captain, \"we have reached it.\"\n\n\"We have reached it!\" repeated the traveller in an accent of\nindescribable sadness. Then he added, in a low tone, \"Yes; that is the\nhaven.\" And then he again plunged into a train of thought, the character\nof which was better revealed by a sad smile, than it would have been by\ntears. A few minutes afterwards a flash of light, which was extinguished\ninstantly, was seen on the land, and the sound of firearms reached the\nyacht.\n\n\"Your excellency,\" said the captain, \"that was the land signal, will you\nanswer yourself?\"\n\n\"What signal?\" The captain pointed towards the island, up the side of\nwhich ascended a volume of smoke, increasing as it rose. \"Ah, yes,\" he\nsaid, as if awaking from a dream. \"Give it to me.\"\n\nThe captain gave him a loaded carbine; the traveller slowly raised it,\nand fired in the air. Ten minutes afterwards, the sails were furled, and\nthey cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little harbor. The\ngig was already lowered, and in it were four oarsmen and a coxswain.\nThe traveller descended, and instead of sitting down at the stern of the\nboat, which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation,\nstood up with his arms crossed. The rowers waited, their oars half\nlifted out of the water, like birds drying their wings.\n\n\"Give way,\" said the traveller. The eight oars fell into the sea\nsimultaneously without splashing a drop of water, and the boat, yielding\nto the impulsion, glided forward. In an instant they found themselves\nin a little harbor, formed in a natural creek; the boat grounded on the\nfine sand.\n\n\"Will your excellency be so good as to mount the shoulders of two of our\nmen, they will carry you ashore?\" The young man answered this invitation\nwith a gesture of indifference, and stepped out of the boat; the sea\nimmediately rose to his waist. \"Ah, your excellency,\" murmured the\npilot, \"you should not have done so; our master will scold us for it.\"\nThe young man continued to advance, following the sailors, who chose\na firm footing. Thirty strides brought them to dry land; the young man\nstamped on the ground to shake off the wet, and looked around for some\none to show him his road, for it was quite dark. Just as he turned,\na hand rested on his shoulder, and a voice which made him shudder\nexclaimed,--\"Good-evening, Maximilian; you are punctual, thank you!\"\n\n\"Ah, is it you, count?\" said the young man, in an almost joyful accent,\npressing Monte Cristo's hand with both his own.\n\n\"Yes; you see I am as exact as you are. But you are dripping, my dear\nfellow; you must change your clothes, as Calypso said to Telemachus.\nCome, I have a habitation prepared for you in which you will soon forget\nfatigue and cold.\" Monte Cristo perceived that the young man had turned\naround; indeed, Morrel saw with surprise that the men who had brought\nhim had left without being paid, or uttering a word. Already the sound\nof their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the count, \"you are looking for the sailors.\"\n\n\"Yes, I paid them nothing, and yet they are gone.\"\n\n\"Never mind that, Maximilian,\" said Monte Cristo, smiling. \"I have made\nan agreement with the navy, that the access to my island shall be free\nof all charge. I have made a bargain.\" Morrel looked at the count with\nsurprise. \"Count,\" he said, \"you are not the same here as in Paris.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Here you laugh.\" The count's brow became clouded. \"You are right to\nrecall me to myself, Maximilian,\" he said; \"I was delighted to see you\nagain, and forgot for the moment that all happiness is fleeting.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, count,\" cried Maximilian, seizing the count's hands, \"pray\nlaugh; be happy, and prove to me, by your indifference, that life is\nendurable to sufferers. Oh, how charitable, kind, and good you are; you\naffect this gayety to inspire me with courage.\"\n\n\"You are wrong, Morrel; I was really happy.\"\n\n\"Then you forget me, so much the better.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Yes; for as the gladiator said to the emperor, when he entered the\narena, 'He who is about to die salutes you.'\"\n\n\"Then you are not consoled?\" asked the count, surprised.\n\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed Morrel, with a glance full of bitter reproach, \"do you\nthink it possible that I could be?\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said the count. \"Do you understand the meaning of my words?\nYou cannot take me for a commonplace man, a mere rattle, emitting a\nvague and senseless noise. When I ask you if you are consoled, I speak\nto you as a man for whom the human heart has no secrets. Well, Morrel,\nlet us both examine the depths of your heart. Do you still feel the same\nfeverish impatience of grief which made you start like a wounded lion?\nHave you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased in the\ngrave? Are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to\nthe pursuit of death; or are you only suffering from the prostration\nof fatigue and the weariness of hope deferred? Has the loss of memory\nrendered it impossible for you to weep? Oh, my dear friend, if this be\nthe case,--if you can no longer weep, if your frozen heart be dead, if\nyou put all your trust in God, then, Maximilian, you are consoled--do\nnot complain.\"\n\n\"Count,\" said Morrel, in a firm and at the same time soft voice, \"listen\nto me, as to a man whose thoughts are raised to heaven, though he\nremains on earth; I come to die in the arms of a friend. Certainly,\nthere are people whom I love. I love my sister Julie,--I love her\nhusband Emmanuel; but I require a strong mind to smile on my last\nmoments. My sister would be bathed in tears and fainting; I could not\nbear to see her suffer. Emmanuel would tear the weapon from my hand, and\nalarm the house with his cries. You, count, who are more than mortal,\nwill, I am sure, lead me to death by a pleasant path, will you not?\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said the count, \"I have still one doubt,--are you weak\nenough to pride yourself upon your sufferings?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,--I am calm,\" said Morrel, giving his hand to the count; \"my\npulse does not beat slower or faster than usual. No, I feel that I have\nreached the goal, and I will go no farther. You told me to wait and\nhope; do you know what you did, unfortunate adviser? I waited a month,\nor rather I suffered for a month! I did hope (man is a poor wretched\ncreature), I did hope. What I cannot tell,--something wonderful, an\nabsurdity, a miracle,--of what nature he alone can tell who has mingled\nwith our reason that folly we call hope. Yes, I did wait--yes, I did\nhope, count, and during this quarter of an hour we have been talking\ntogether, you have unconsciously wounded, tortured my heart, for every\nword you have uttered proved that there was no hope for me. Oh, count,\nI shall sleep calmly, deliciously in the arms of death.\" Morrel uttered\nthese words with an energy which made the count shudder. \"My friend,\"\ncontinued Morrel, \"you named the fifth of October as the end of the\nperiod of waiting,--to-day is the fifth of October,\" he took out his\nwatch, \"it is now nine o'clock,--I have yet three hours to live.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" said the count, \"come.\" Morrel mechanically followed the\ncount, and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it. He felt\na carpet under his feet, a door opened, perfumes surrounded him, and\na brilliant light dazzled his eyes. Morrel hesitated to advance; he\ndreaded the enervating effect of all that he saw. Monte Cristo drew him\nin gently. \"Why should we not spend the last three hours remaining to\nus of life, like those ancient Romans, who when condemned by Nero, their\nemperor and heir, sat down at a table covered with flowers, and gently\nglided into death, amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses?\" Morrel\nsmiled. \"As you please,\" he said; \"death is always death,--that is\nforgetfulness, repose, exclusion from life, and therefore from grief.\"\nHe sat down, and Monte Cristo placed himself opposite to him. They were\nin the marvellous dining-room before described, where the statues had\nbaskets on their heads always filled with fruits and flowers. Morrel had\nlooked carelessly around, and had probably noticed nothing.\n\n\"Let us talk like men,\" he said, looking at the count.\n\n\"Go on!\"\n\n\"Count,\" said Morrel, \"you are the epitome of all human knowledge, and\nyou seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced world\nthan ours.\"\n\n\"There is something true in what you say,\" said the count, with that\nsmile which made him so handsome; \"I have descended from a planet called\ngrief.\"\n\n\"I believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning; for\ninstance, you told me to live, and I did live; you told me to hope,\nand I almost did so. I am almost inclined to ask you, as though you had\nexperienced death, 'is it painful to die?'\"\n\nMonte Cristo looked upon Morrel with indescribable tenderness. \"Yes,\"\nhe said, \"yes, doubtless it is painful, if you violently break the outer\ncovering which obstinately begs for life. If you plunge a dagger into\nyour flesh, if you insinuate a bullet into your brain, which the least\nshock disorders,--then certainly, you will suffer pain, and you will\nrepent quitting a life for a repose you have bought at so dear a price.\"\n\n\"Yes; I know that there is a secret of luxury and pain in death, as well\nas in life; the only thing is to understand it.\"\n\n\"You have spoken truly, Maximilian; according to the care we bestow upon\nit, death is either a friend who rocks us gently as a nurse, or an enemy\nwho violently drags the soul from the body. Some day, when the world\nis much older, and when mankind will be masters of all the destructive\npowers in nature, to serve for the general good of humanity; when\nmankind, as you were just saying, have discovered the secrets of death,\nthen that death will become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the\narms of your beloved.\"\n\n\"And if you wished to die, you would choose this death, count?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nMorrel extended his hand. \"Now I understand,\" he said, \"why you had me\nbrought here to this desolate spot, in the midst of the ocean, to this\nsubterranean palace; it was because you loved me, was it not, count? It\nwas because you loved me well enough to give me one of those sweet means\nof death of which we were speaking; a death without agony, a death which\nallows me to fade away while pronouncing Valentine's name and pressing\nyour hand.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have guessed rightly, Morrel,\" said the count, \"that is what I\nintended.\"\n\n\"Thanks; the idea that tomorrow I shall no longer suffer, is sweet to my\nheart.\"\n\n\"Do you then regret nothing?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Morrel.\n\n\"Not even me?\" asked the count with deep emotion. Morrel's clear eye was\nfor the moment clouded, then it shone with unusual lustre, and a large\ntear rolled down his cheek.\n\n\"What,\" said the count, \"do you still regret anything in the world, and\nyet die?\"\n\n\"Oh, I entreat you,\" exclaimed Morrel in a low voice, \"do not speak\nanother word, count; do not prolong my punishment.\" The count fancied\nthat he was yielding, and this belief revived the horrible doubt that\nhad overwhelmed him at the Chateau d'If. \"I am endeavoring,\" he thought,\n\"to make this man happy; I look upon this restitution as a weight thrown\ninto the scale to balance the evil I have wrought. Now, supposing I\nam deceived, supposing this man has not been unhappy enough to merit\nhappiness. Alas, what would become of me who can only atone for evil by\ndoing good?\" Then he said aloud: \"Listen, Morrel, I see your grief\nis great, but still you do not like to risk your soul.\" Morrel smiled\nsadly. \"Count,\" he said, \"I swear to you my soul is no longer my own.\"\n\n\"Maximilian, you know I have no relation in the world. I have accustomed\nmyself to regard you as my son: well, then, to save my son, I will\nsacrifice my life, nay, even my fortune.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, that you wish to quit life because you do not understand\nall the enjoyments which are the fruits of a large fortune. Morrel, I\npossess nearly a hundred millions and I give them to you; with such a\nfortune you can attain every wish. Are you ambitious? Every career is\nopen to you. Overturn the world, change its character, yield to mad\nideas, be even criminal--but live.\"\n\n\"Count, I have your word,\" said Morrel coldly; then taking out his\nwatch, he added, \"It is half-past eleven.\"\n\n\"Morrel, can you intend it in my house, under my very eyes?\"\n\n\"Then let me go,\" said Maximilian, \"or I shall think you did not love me\nfor my own sake, but for yours;\" and he arose.\n\n\"It is well,\" said Monte Cristo whose countenance brightened at these\nwords; \"you wish--you are inflexible. Yes, as you said, you are indeed\nwretched and a miracle alone can cure you. Sit down, Morrel, and wait.\"\n\nMorrel obeyed; the count arose, and unlocking a closet with a key\nsuspended from his gold chain, took from it a little silver casket,\nbeautifully carved and chased, the corners of which represented four\nbending figures, similar to the Caryatides, the forms of women, symbols\nof the angels aspiring to heaven. He placed the casket on the table;\nthen opening it took out a little golden box, the top of which flew\nopen when touched by a secret spring. This box contained an unctuous\nsubstance partly solid, of which it was impossible to discover the\ncolor, owing to the reflection of the polished gold, sapphires, rubies,\nemeralds, which ornamented the box. It was a mixed mass of blue, red,\nand gold. The count took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon,\nand offered it to Morrel, fixing a long steadfast glance upon him. It\nwas then observable that the substance was greenish.\n\n\"This is what you asked for,\" he said, \"and what I promised to give\nyou.\"\n\n\"I thank you from the depths of my heart,\" said the young man, taking\nthe spoon from the hands of Monte Cristo. The count took another spoon,\nand again dipped it into the golden box. \"What are you going to do, my\nfriend?\" asked Morrel, arresting his hand.\n\n\"Well, the fact is, Morrel, I was thinking that I too am weary of life,\nand since an opportunity presents itself\"--\n\n\"Stay!\" said the young man. \"You who love, and are beloved; you, who\nhave faith and hope,--oh, do not follow my example. In your case it\nwould be a crime. Adieu, my noble and generous friend, adieu; I will\ngo and tell Valentine what you have done for me.\" And slowly, though\nwithout any hesitation, only waiting to press the count's hand\nfervently, he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by Monte\nCristo. Then they were both silent. Ali, mute and attentive, brought the\npipes and coffee, and disappeared. By degrees, the light of the lamps\ngradually faded in the hands of the marble statues which held them, and\nthe perfumes appeared less powerful to Morrel. Seated opposite to him,\nMonte Cristo watched him in the shadow, and Morrel saw nothing but the\nbright eyes of the count. An overpowering sadness took possession of\nthe young man, his hands relaxed their hold, the objects in the room\ngradually lost their form and color, and his disturbed vision seemed to\nperceive doors and curtains open in the walls.\n\n\"Friend,\" he cried, \"I feel that I am dying; thanks!\" He made a last\neffort to extend his hand, but it fell powerless beside him. Then it\nappeared to him that Monte Cristo smiled, not with the strange and\nfearful expression which had sometimes revealed to him the secrets of\nhis heart, but with the benevolent kindness of a father for a child.\nAt the same time the count appeared to increase in stature, his form,\nnearly double its usual height, stood out in relief against the red\ntapestry, his black hair was thrown back, and he stood in the attitude\nof an avenging angel. Morrel, overpowered, turned around in the\narm-chair; a delicious torpor permeated every vein. A change of\nideas presented themselves to his brain, like a new design on\nthe kaleidoscope. Enervated, prostrate, and breathless, he became\nunconscious of outward objects; he seemed to be entering that vague\ndelirium preceding death. He wished once again to press the count's\nhand, but his own was immovable. He wished to articulate a last\nfarewell, but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat, like\na stone at the mouth of a sepulchre. Involuntarily his languid eyes\nclosed, and still through his eyelashes a well-known form seemed to move\namid the obscurity with which he thought himself enveloped.\n\nThe count had just opened a door. Immediately a brilliant light from the\nnext room, or rather from the palace adjoining, shone upon the room in\nwhich he was gently gliding into his last sleep. Then he saw a woman of\nmarvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the door separating the\ntwo rooms. Pale, and sweetly smiling, she looked like an angel of mercy\nconjuring the angel of vengeance. \"Is it heaven that opens before me?\"\nthought the dying man; \"that angel resembles the one I have lost.\" Monte\nCristo pointed out Morrel to the young woman, who advanced towards him\nwith clasped hands and a smile upon her lips.\n\n\"Valentine, Valentine!\" he mentally ejaculated; but his lips uttered\nno sound, and as though all his strength were centred in that internal\nemotion, he sighed and closed his eyes. Valentine rushed towards him;\nhis lips again moved.\n\n\"He is calling you,\" said the count; \"he to whom you have confided your\ndestiny--he from whom death would have separated you, calls you to him.\nHappily, I vanquished death. Henceforth, Valentine, you will never\nagain be separated on earth, since he has rushed into death to find you.\nWithout me, you would both have died. May God accept my atonement in the\npreservation of these two existences!\"\n\nValentine seized the count's hand, and in her irresistible impulse of\njoy carried it to her lips.\n\n\"Oh, thank me again!\" said the count; \"tell me till you are weary, that\nI have restored you to happiness; you do not know how much I require\nthis assurance.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes, I thank you with all my heart,\" said Valentine; \"and if\nyou doubt the sincerity of my gratitude, oh, then, ask Haidee! ask my\nbeloved sister Haidee, who ever since our departure from France, has\ncaused me to wait patiently for this happy day, while talking to me of\nyou.\"\n\n\"You then love Haidee?\" asked Monte Cristo with an emotion he in vain\nendeavored to dissimulate.\n\n\"Oh, yes, with all my soul.\"\n\n\"Well, then, listen, Valentine,\" said the count; \"I have a favor to ask\nof you.\"\n\n\"Of me? Oh, am I happy enough for that?\"\n\n\"Yes; you have called Haidee your sister,--let her become so indeed,\nValentine; render her all the gratitude you fancy that you owe to me;\nprotect her, for\" (the count's voice was thick with emotion) \"henceforth\nshe will be alone in the world.\"\n\n\"Alone in the world!\" repeated a voice behind the count, \"and why?\"\n\nMonte Cristo turned around; Haidee was standing pale, motionless,\nlooking at the count with an expression of fearful amazement.\n\n\"Because to-morrow, Haidee, you will be free; you will then assume\nyour proper position in society, for I will not allow my destiny to\novershadow yours. Daughter of a prince, I restore to you the riches and\nname of your father.\"\n\nHaidee became pale, and lifting her transparent hands to heaven,\nexclaimed in a voice stifled with tears, \"Then you leave me, my lord?\"\n\n\"Haidee, Haidee, you are young and beautiful; forget even my name, and\nbe happy.\"\n\n\"It is well,\" said Haidee; \"your order shall be executed, my lord;\nI will forget even your name, and be happy.\" And she stepped back to\nretire.\n\n\"Oh, heavens,\" exclaimed Valentine, who was supporting the head of\nMorrel on her shoulder, \"do you not see how pale she is? Do you not see\nhow she suffers?\"\n\nHaidee answered with a heartrending expression, \"Why should he\nunderstand this, my sister? He is my master, and I am his slave; he has\nthe right to notice nothing.\"\n\nThe count shuddered at the tones of a voice which penetrated the inmost\nrecesses of his heart; his eyes met those of the young girl and he could\nnot bear their brilliancy. \"Oh, heavens,\" exclaimed Monte Cristo, \"can\nmy suspicions be correct? Haidee, would it please you not to leave me?\"\n\n\"I am young,\" gently replied Haidee; \"I love the life you have made so\nsweet to me, and I should be sorry to die.\"\n\n\"You mean, then, that if I leave you, Haidee\"--\n\n\"I should die; yes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Do you then love me?\"\n\n\"Oh, Valentine, he asks if I love him. Valentine, tell him if you love\nMaximilian.\" The count felt his heart dilate and throb; he opened his\narms, and Haidee, uttering a cry, sprang into them. \"Oh, yes,\" she\ncried, \"I do love you! I love you as one loves a father, brother,\nhusband! I love you as my life, for you are the best, the noblest of\ncreated beings!\"\n\n\"Let it be, then, as you wish, sweet angel; God has sustained me in my\nstruggle with my enemies, and has given me this reward; he will not let\nme end my triumph in suffering; I wished to punish myself, but he has\npardoned me. Love me then, Haidee! Who knows? perhaps your love will\nmake me forget all that I do not wish to remember.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, my lord?\"\n\n\"I mean that one word from you has enlightened me more than twenty years\nof slow experience; I have but you in the world, Haidee; through you\nI again take hold on life, through you I shall suffer, through you\nrejoice.\"\n\n\"Do you hear him, Valentine?\" exclaimed Haidee; \"he says that through me\nhe will suffer--through me, who would yield my life for his.\" The count\nwithdrew for a moment. \"Have I discovered the truth?\" he said; \"but\nwhether it be for recompense or punishment, I accept my fate. Come,\nHaidee, come!\" and throwing his arm around the young girl's waist, he\npressed the hand of Valentine, and disappeared.\n\nAn hour had nearly passed, during which Valentine, breathless and\nmotionless, watched steadfastly over Morrel. At length she felt his\nheart beat, a faint breath played upon his lips, a slight shudder,\nannouncing the return of life, passed through the young man's frame. At\nlength his eyes opened, but they were at first fixed and expressionless;\nthen sight returned, and with it feeling and grief. \"Oh,\" he cried, in\nan accent of despair, \"the count has deceived me; I am yet living;\" and\nextending his hand towards the table, he seized a knife.\n\n\"Dearest,\" exclaimed Valentine, with her adorable smile, \"awake, and\nlook at me!\" Morrel uttered a loud exclamation, and frantic, doubtful,\ndazzled, as though by a celestial vision, he fell upon his knees.\n\nThe next morning at daybreak, Valentine and Morrel were walking\narm-in-arm on the sea-shore, Valentine relating how Monte Cristo had\nappeared in her room, explained everything, revealed the crime, and,\nfinally, how he had saved her life by enabling her to simulate death.\nThey had found the door of the grotto opened, and gone forth; on the\nazure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars. Morrel soon\nperceived a man standing among the rocks, apparently awaiting a sign\nfrom them to advance, and pointed him out to Valentine. \"Ah, it is\nJacopo,\" she said, \"the captain of the yacht;\" and she beckoned him\ntowards them.\n\n\"Do you wish to speak to us?\" asked Morrel.\n\n\"I have a letter to give you from the count.\"\n\n\"From the count!\" murmured the two young people.\n\n\"Yes; read it.\" Morrel opened the letter, and read:--\n\n\"My Dear Maximilian,--\n\n\"There is a felucca for you at anchor. Jacopo will carry you to Leghorn,\nwhere Monsieur Noirtier awaits his granddaughter, whom he wishes to\nbless before you lead her to the altar. All that is in this grotto, my\nfriend, my house in the Champs Elysees, and my chateau at Treport, are\nthe marriage gifts bestowed by Edmond Dantes upon the son of his old\nmaster, Morrel. Mademoiselle de Villefort will share them with you; for\nI entreat her to give to the poor the immense fortune reverting to her\nfrom her father, now a madman, and her brother who died last September\nwith his mother. Tell the angel who will watch over your future destiny,\nMorrel, to pray sometimes for a man, who like Satan thought himself\nfor an instant equal to God, but who now acknowledges with Christian\nhumility that God alone possesses supreme power and infinite wisdom.\nPerhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his heart. As\nfor you, Morrel, this is the secret of my conduct towards you. There is\nneither happiness nor misery in the world; there is only the comparison\nof one state with another, nothing more. He who has felt the deepest\ngrief is best able to experience supreme happiness. We must have felt\nwhat it is to die, Morrel, that we may appreciate the enjoyments of\nliving.\n\n\"Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never\nforget that until the day when God shall deign to reveal the future\nto man, all human wisdom is summed up in these two words,--'_Wait and\nhope_.'--Your friend,\n\n\"Edmond Dantes, Count of Monte Cristo.\"\n\nDuring the perusal of this letter, which informed Valentine for the\nfirst time of the madness of her father and the death of her brother,\nshe became pale, a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom, and tears, not\nthe less painful because they were silent, ran down her cheeks; her\nhappiness cost her very dear. Morrel looked around uneasily. \"But,\" he\nsaid, \"the count's generosity is too overwhelming; Valentine will be\nsatisfied with my humble fortune. Where is the count, friend? Lead me\nto him.\" Jacopo pointed towards the horizon. \"What do you mean?\" asked\nValentine. \"Where is the count?--where is Haidee?\"\n\n\"Look!\" said Jacopo.\n\nThe eyes of both were fixed upon the spot indicated by the sailor, and\non the blue line separating the sky from the Mediterranean Sea, they\nperceived a large white sail. \"Gone,\" said Morrel; \"gone!--adieu, my\nfriend--adieu, my father!\"\n\n\"Gone,\" murmured Valentine; \"adieu, my sweet Haidee--adieu, my sister!\"\n\n\"Who can say whether we shall ever see them again?\" said Morrel with\ntearful eyes.\n\n\"Darling,\" replied Valentine, \"has not the count just told us that all\nhuman wisdom is summed up in two words?--'_Wait and hope_.'\"", "title": "The Count of Monte Cristo, Illustrated"}

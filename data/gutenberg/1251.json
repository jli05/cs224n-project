{"summary": "\nArthur is born to Uther Pendragon and Igraine and then taken by Sir Ector to be fostered in the country. He later becomes the king of a leaderless England when he removes the fated sword from the stone. Arthur goes on to win many battles due to his military prowess and Merlin’s counsel. He then consolidates his kingdom.\nThis first book also tells “The Tale of Balyn and Balan”, which ends in accidental fratricide, and the begetting of Mordred, Arthur’s incestuous son by his half-sister, Morgause (though Arthur did not know her as his half-sister). On Merlin's advice, and reminiscent of Herod's killing of the innocents in scripture, Arthur takes every newborn boy in his kingdom and sends them to sea in a boat. The boat crashes and all but Mordred, who later kills his father, perish. This is mentioned matter-of-factly, with no apparent moral overtone. Arthur marries Guinevere, and inherits the Round Table from her father Leodegrance. At Pentecost, Arthur gathers his knights at Camelot and establishes the Round Table company. All swear to the Pentecostal Oath as a guide for knightly conduct.\nIn this first book, Malory addresses 15th century preoccupations with legitimacy and societal unrest, which will appear throughout the rest of the work. As Malorian scholar Helen Cooper states in Sir Thomas Malory: Le Morte D'arthur - The Winchester Manuscript, the prose style (as opposed to verse), which mimics historical documents of the time, lends an air of authority to the whole work. She goes on to state that this allowed contemporaries to read the book as a history rather than as a work of fiction, therefore making it a model of order for Malory's violent and chaotic times during the War of the Roses. Malory's concern with legitimacy reflects the concerns of 15th century England, where many were claiming their rights to power through violence and bloodshed. Genealogy was a way to legitimize power in a less arbitrary manner, and Malory calls this into question.\n\nThis book, detailing Arthur's march on Rome, is heavily based on the Middle English Alliterative Morte Arthure, which in turn is heavily based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae. The opening of Book V finds Arthur and his kingdom without an enemy. His throne is secure, his knights have proven themselves through a series of quests, Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristan have arrived and the court is feasting. When envoys from Emperor Lucius of Rome arrive and accuse Arthur of refusing tribute, “contrary to the statutes and decrees made by the noble and worthy Julius Caesar”, Arthur and his knights are stirring for a fight. They are “many days rested” and excited, “for now shall we have warre and worshype.” Arthur invokes the lineage of Ser Belyne and Sir Bryne, legendary British conquerors of Rome, and through their blood lineage demands tribute from Lucius under the argument that Britain conquered Rome first. Lucius, apprised of the situation by his envoys, raises a heathen army of the East, composed of Spaniards and Saracens, as well as other enemies of the Christian world. Rome is supposed to be the seat of Christianity, but it is more foreign and corrupt than the courts of Arthur and his allies. Departing from Geoffrey of Monmouth's history in which Mordred is left in charge, Malory's Arthur leaves his court in the hands of Sir Constantine of Cornwall and an advisor. Arthur sails to Normandy to meet his cousin Hoel, but he finds a giant terrorizing the people from the holy island of Mont St. Michel. This giant is the embodiment of senseless violence and chaos, a monster who eats men and rapes women to death. He uses sex as a violent act of control and appetite, divorced from sensuality or reason. Arthur battles him alone, an act of public relations intended to inspire his knights. The fight is closely documented by Malory, a blow-by-blow description of blood and gore. The giant dies after Arthur “swappis his genytrottys in sondir” and “kut his baly in sundir, that oute wente the gore”. When Arthur does fight Lucius and his armies it is almost anticlimactic, when compared to his struggles with the giant. Arthur and his armies defeat the Romans, Arthur is crowned Emperor, a proxy government is arranged for the Roman Empire and Arthur returns to London where his queen welcomes him royally.\n\nIn this tale, Malory establishes Lancelot as King Arthur's most revered knight. Among Lancelot's numerous episodic adventures include being enchanted into a deep sleep by the sorceress Morgan le Fay and having to escape her castle, proving victorious in a tournament fighting on behalf of King Bagdemagus, slaying the mighty Sir Turquine who had been holding several of Arthur's knights prisoner, and also overcoming the betrayal of a damsel to defend himself unarmed against Sir Phelot.\nThese adventures address several major issues developed throughout Le Morte d'Arthur. Among the most important is the fact Lancelot always adheres to the Pentecostal Oath. Throughout this tale he assists dancing ladies in distress and provides mercy for knights he has defeated in battle. However, the world Lancelot lives in is too complicated for simple mandates. This can be seen when a damsel betrays Lancelot, and he must fight Sir Phelot unarmed. Although Lancelot aspires to live by an ethical code, the actions of others make it difficult for the Pentecostal Oath to fully establish a social order.\nAnother major issue this text addresses is demonstrated when Morgan le Fay enchants Lancelot. This action reflects a feminization of magic along with a clear indication that Merlin’s role within the text has been diminished. The tournament fighting in this tale indicates a shift away from war towards a more mediated and virtuous form of violence.\nOn courtly love, Malory attempts to shift the focus of courtly love from adultery to service by having Lancelot admit to doing everything he does for Guinevere, but never admit to having an adulterous relationship with her. However, a close parsing of his words can perhaps allow Lancelot to retain his honorable word, for he never says that he has not lain with the queen, but rather that if anyone makes such a claim, he will fight them (the assumption being that God will cause the liar to lose). Further, since Lancelot – who in all of the book never breaks his word or lies – claims that the queen was never untrue to her lord, then it seems to be the case that he must consider his love of the queen to be somehow pure or special, not an act of unfaithfulness to the king he loves and serves.\n\nThe tale of Sir Gareth begins with his arrival at court as le bel inconnu, or the fair unknown. He comes without a name and therefore without a past. Sir Kay mockingly calls the unknown young man “Beaumains” and treats him with contempt and condescension. An unknown woman, later revealed to be the Dame Lynette, eventually comes to court asking for assistance against the Red Knight of the Red Lands, and Gareth takes up the quest. On his quest, he encounters the Black, Green, Red, and Blue knights and the Red knight of the Red Lands. He kills the Black Knight, incorporates the others into Arthur’s court, and rescues Lynette's sister Lyonesse. Lustily in love with Lyonesse, Gareth conspires to consummate their relationship before marrying. Only by the magical intervention of Lynette is their tryst unsuccessful, thus preserving Gareth's virginity and, presumably, his standing with God. Gareth later counsels Lyonesse to report to King Arthur and pretend she doesn’t know where he is; instead, he tells her to announce a tournament of his knights against the Round Table. This allows Gareth to disguise himself and win honor by defeating his brother knights. The heralds eventually acknowledge that he is Sir Gareth right as he strikes down Sir Gawain, his brother. The book ends with Gareth rejoining his fellow knights and marrying Lyonesse.\nIn Book IV, there are only two knights that have ever held against Sir Lancelot in tournament: Tristram and Gareth. This was always under conditions where one or both parties were unknown by the other, for these knights loved each other “passingly well.” Gareth was knighted by Lancelot himself when he took upon him the adventure on behalf of Dame Lynette. Much later, Gareth is accidentally slain by his beloved Lancelot when Guinevere is rescued from being burnt at the stake by King Arthur.\n\nIn “The Fyrste and the Secunde Boke of Syr Trystrams de Lyones,” Malory tells the tales of Sir Tristan (Trystram), Sir Dinadan, Sir Palamedes, Sir La Cote De Male Tayle, Sir Alexander, and a variety of other knights. Based on the French Prose Tristan, or a lost English adaptation of it, Malory's Tristan section is the literal centerpiece of Le Morte D’Arthur as well as the longest of the eight books.\nThe book displays a very realistic and jaded view of the world of chivalry. It is rife with adultery, characterized most visibly in Sir Tristan and the Belle Isolde. However, it should be noted that Sir Tristan had met and fallen in love with Isolde earlier, and that his uncle, King Mark, jealous of Tristan and seeking to undermine him, appears to seek marriage to Isolde for just such a hateful purpose, going so far as to ask Tristan to go and seek her hand on his behalf (which Tristan, understanding that to be his knightly duty, does). Sir Tristan is the namesake of the book and his adulterous relationship with Isolde, his uncle Mark’s wife, is one of the focuses of the section. The knights, Tristan included, operate on very personal or political concerns rather than just the standard provided by the world of Pentecostal Oath as we have seen it so far. One knight, Sir Dinidan, takes this so far as to run away or refuse to fight if he sees any risk. However, it should be understood that Sir Dinidan is a playful, humorous knight who, in later chapters, shows himself to be brave and noble. It is unclear whether his refusals to fight are part of his comic character or otherwise. Other knights, even knights of the Round Table, make requests that show the dark side of the world of chivalry. In one episode, Sir Bleoberys, one of Lancelot’s cousins, claims another knight’s wife for his own and rides away with her until stopped by Sir Tristan. In another, when Tristan defeats Sir Blamore, another knight of the Round Table, Blamore asks Tristan to kill him because he would rather die than have his reputation tarnished by the defeat.\nOf all the knights, Tristan most resembles Lancelot. He loves a queen, the wife of another. Tristan is even considered to be as strong and able a knight as Lancelot, although they become beloved friends. Because of King Mark's treacherous behavior, Tristran takes Isolde from him and lives with her for some time, but he then returns Isolde to him. Nonetheless, Mark kills Tristran while he is “harping” (Tristran is noted in the book as one of the greatest of musicians and falconers).\n\nMalory’s primary source for “The Noble Tale of the Sangreal” is the French Vulgate Cycle’s La Queste Del Saint Graal. Malory's version chronicles the adventures of numerous knights in their quest to achieve the Holy Grail. The Grail first appears in the hall of King Arthur “coverde with whyght samyte”, and it miraculously produces meat and drink for the knights. Gawain is the first to declare that he “shall laboure in the Queste of the Sankgreall”. He embarks on the quest in order to see the Grail “more opynly than hit hath bene shewed” before, and to gain more “metys and drynkes”. Likewise, Lancelot, Percival, Bors, and Galahad undergo the quest. Their exploits are intermingled with encounters with maidens and hermits who offer advice and interpret dreams along the way.\nAfter the confusion of the secular moral code as manifested in the Pentecostal Oath within \"The Fyrst and the Secunde Boke of Syr Trystrams de Lyones\", Malory attempts to construct a new mode of chivalry by placing an emphasis on religion and Christianity in \"The Sankgreal\". However, the role of the Catholic Church is drastically subverted within the text, illustrating 15th-century England’s movement away from the Church establishment and toward mysticism. Within the text the Church offers a venue through which the Pentecostal Oath can be upheld, whereas the strict moral code imposed by religion foreshadows almost certain failure on the part of the knights. For example, Gawain is often dubbed a secular knight, as he refuses to do penance for his sins, claiming the tribulations that coexist with knighthood as a sort of secular penance. Likewise, Lancelot, for all his sincerity, is unable to completely escape his adulterous love of Guinevere, and is thus destined to fail where Galahad will succeed. This coincides with the personification of perfection in the form of Galahad. Because Galahad is the only knight who lives entirely without sin, this leaves both the audience and the other knights with a model of perfection that seemingly cannot be emulated either through chivalry or religion.\n\nAt the beginning of the book “Sir Launcelot and Queene Gwenyvere”, Malory tells his readers that the pair started behaving carelessly in public, stating that “Launcelot began to resort unto the Queene Guinevere again and forget the promise and the perfection that he made in the Quest… and so they loved together more hotter than they did beforehand”(Cooper, 402). They indulged in “privy draughts together” and behaved in such a way that “many in the court spoke of it” (Cooper, 402).\nThis book also includes the \"knight of the cart\" episode, where Maleagant kidnapped Guinevere and her unarmed knights and held them prisoner in his castle. After Maleagant's archers killed his horse, Launcelot had to ride to the castle in a cart in order to save the queen. Knowing Lancelot was on his way, Maleagant pleaded to Guinevere for mercy, which she granted and then forced Lancelot to stifle his rage against Maleagant.\nIn this same book Malory mentions Lancelot and Guinevere's adultery. Malory says, \"So, to passe upon this tale, Sir Launcelot wente to bedde with the Quene and toke no force of his hurte honed, but toke his plesaunce and hys lyknge untyll hit was the dawning of the day\" (633). Sir Maleagant, upon finding blood in Guinevere's bed, was so convinced of her unfaithfulness to Arthur that he was willing to fight in an attempt to prove it to others. After Guinevere made it known that she wanted Maleagant dead, Launcelot killed him even though Maleagant begged for mercy (but only after Maleagant agreed to continue fighting with Lancelot's helmet removed, his left side body armor removed, and his left hand tied behind his back—Lancelot felt it necessary to finish the bout, but would not slay Maleagant unless Maleagant agreed to continue fighting). The book ends with Lancelot's healing of Sir Urry of Hungary, where Malory notes that Lancelot is the only knight out of hundreds to succeed in this endeavor. He has committed treason to King Arthur (because of his adultery with Guinevere) and yet is the only knight virtuous enough to heal Sir Urry. After healing Sir Urry, Lancelot wept as a \"chylde that had bene beatyn\" (644).\n\n\nMordred and Agravaine have been scheming to uncover Lancelot and Guinevere's adultery for quite some time. When they find an opportune moment to finally and concretely reveal the adulterous relationship, Lancelot kills Agravaine and several others and escapes. Arthur is forced to sentence Guinevere to burn at the stake, and orders his surviving nephews, Gawain, Mordred, Gareth, and Gaheris, to guard the scene, knowing Lancelot will attempt a rescue. Gawain flatly refuses to be part of any act that will treat the queen shamefully. His younger brothers, Gaheris and Gareth, unable to deny the king's request that they escort Guinevere to the stake to be burnt, advise that they will do so at his command, but they will not arm themselves. When Lancelot's party raids the execution, many knights are killed, including, by accident, Gareth and Gaheris. Gawain, bent on revenge for their deaths, prompts Arthur into a war with Lancelot, first at his castle in northern England. At this point the Pope steps in and issues a bull to end the violence between Arthur's and Lancelot's factions. Shortly thereafter, Arthur pursues Lancelot to his home in France to continue the fight. Gawain challenges Lancelot to a duel, but loses and asks Lancelot to kill him; Lancelot refuses and grants him mercy before leaving. This event plays out twice, each time Lancelot delaying due to Gawain's enchantment/blessing to grow stronger between 9 a.m. and noon, then striking down Gawain, but sparing his life.\nArthur receives a message that Mordred, whom he had left in charge back in Britain, has usurped his throne, and he leads his forces back home. In the invasion Gawain is mortally injured, and writes to Lancelot, asking for his help against Mordred, and for forgiveness for separating the Round Table. In a dream, the departed Gawain tells Arthur to wait thirty days for Lancelot to return to England before fighting Mordred, and Arthur sends Lucan and Bedivere to make a temporary peace treaty. At the exchange, an unnamed knight draws his sword to kill an adder. The other knights construe this as treachery and a declaration of war. Seeing no other recourse, at the Battle of Camlann, Arthur charges Mordred and impales him with a spear. But with the last of his strength, Mordred impales himself even further, so as to come within striking distance of King Arthur, then gives a mortal blow to Arthur’s head.\nAs he is dying, Arthur commands Bedivere to cast Excalibur into the lake. Bedivere initially does not throw the sword in the lake, but instead hides it behind a tree. He confesses his reluctance to Arthur, then returns to the lake and throws in his own sword instead of Excalibur. Bedivere once again relays his disobedience to Arthur, who requests the sword be returned to the lake for a third time. When Bedivere finally throws Excalibur back in the lake, it is retrieved by the hand of the Lady of the Lake. The hand shakes the sword three times and then vanishes back into the water. A barge appears, carrying ladies in black hoods (one being Morgan le Fay), who take Arthur to the Isle of Avalon.\nAfter the passing of King Arthur, Malory provides a denouement, mostly following the lives (and deaths) of Guinevere, Lancelot, and Lancelot's kinsmen.\nWhen Lancelot returns to Dover, he mourns the deaths of his comrades. Lancelot travels to Almesbury to see Guinevere. During the civil war, Guinevere is portrayed as a scapegoat for violence without developing her perspective or motivation. However, after Arthur's death, Guinevere retires to a convent in penitence for her infidelity. Her contrition is sincere and permanent; Lancelot is unable to sway her to come away with him. Instead, Lancelot becomes a monk, and is joined in monastic life by his kinsmen. Arthur's successor is appointed (Constantine, son of King Carados of Scotland), and the realm that Arthur created is significantly changed. After the deaths of Guinevere and Lancelot, Sirs Bors, Hector, Blamore, and Bleoberis head to the Holy Land to crusade against the Turks, where they die on Good Friday.\n\n", "full_text": "LE MORTE D'ARTHUR\n\nBy Sir Thomas Malory\n\n\nKing Arthur and of his Noble Knights of the Round Table\n\n\nIN TWO VOLS.--VOL.

It is thus, fitly enough, the last important English book written\nbefore the introduction of printing into this country, and since no\nmanuscript of it has come down to us it is also the first English\nclassic for our knowledge of which we are entirely dependent on a\nprinted text. Caxton's story of how the book was brought to him and he\nwas induced to print it may be read farther on in his own preface. From\nthis we learn also that he was not only the printer of the book, but\nto some extent its editor also, dividing Malory's work into twenty-one\nbooks, splitting up the books into chapters, by no means skilfully,\nand supplying the \"Rubrish\" or chapter-headings. It may be added that\nCaxton's preface contains, moreover, a brief criticism which, on the\npoints on which it touches, is still the soundest and most sympathetic\nthat has been written.\n\nCaxton finished his edition the last day of July 1485, some fifteen\nor sixteen years after Malory wrote his epilogue. It is clear that the\nauthor was then dead, or the printer would not have acted as a clumsy\neditor to the book, and recent discoveries (if bibliography may, for the\nmoment, enlarge its bounds to mention such matters) have revealed with\ntolerable certainty when Malory died and who he was. In letters to The\nAthenaeum in July 1896 Mr. T. Williams pointed out that the name of\na Sir Thomas Malorie occurred among those of a number of other\nLancastrians excluded from a general pardon granted by Edward IV.\nin 1468, and that a William Mallerye was mentioned in the same year\nas taking part in a Lancastrian rising. In September 1897, again, in\nanother letter to the same paper, Mr. A. T. Martin reported the\nfinding of the will of a Thomas Malory of Papworth, a hundred partly\nin Cambridgeshire, partly in Hunts. This will was made on September 16,\n1469, and as it was proved the 27th of the next month the testator\nmust have been in immediate expectation of death. It contains the most\ncareful provision for the education and starting in life of a family of\nthree daughters and seven sons, of whom the youngest seems to have been\nstill an infant. We cannot say with certainty that this Thomas Malory,\nwhose last thoughts were so busy for his children, was our author, or\nthat the Lancastrian knight discovered by Mr. Williams was identical\nwith either or both, but such evidence as the Morte D'Arthur offers\nfavours such a belief. There is not only the epilogue with its petition,\n\"pray for me while I am alive that God send me good deliverance and\nwhen I am dead pray you all for my soul,\" but this very request is\nforeshadowed at the end of chap. 37 of Book ix. in the touching passage,\nsurely inspired by personal experience, as to the sickness \"that is\nthe greatest pain a prisoner may have\"; and the reflections on English\nfickleness in the first chapter of Book xxi., though the Wars of the\nRoses might have inspired them in any one, come most naturally from an\nauthor who was a Lancastrian knight.\n\nIf the Morte D'Arthur was really written in prison and by a prisoner\ndistressed by ill-health as well as by lack of liberty, surely no task\nwas ever better devised to while away weary hours. Leaving abundant\nscope for originality in selection, modification, and arrangement, as a\ncompilation and translation it had in it that mechanical element which\nadds the touch of restfulness to literary work. No original, it is said,\nhas yet been found for Book vii., and it is possible that none will ever\nbe forthcoming for chap. 20 of Book xviii., which describes the arrival\nof the body of the Fair Maiden of Astolat at Arthur's court, or vii for\nchap. 25 of the same book, with its discourse on true love; but the\ngreat bulk of the work has been traced chapter by chapter to the\n\"Merlin\" of Robert de Borron and his successors (Bks. i.-iv.), the\nEnglish metrical romance La Morte Arthur of the Thornton manuscript (Bk.\nv.), the French romances of Tristan (Bks. viii.-x.) and of Launcelot\n(Bks. vi., xi.-xix.), and lastly to the English prose Morte Arthur of\nHarley MS. 2252 (Bks. xviii., xx., xxi.). As to Malory's choice of his\nauthorities critics have not failed to point out that now and again he\ngives a worse version where a better has come down to us, and if he\nhad been able to order a complete set of Arthurian manuscripts from his\nbookseller, no doubt he would have done even better than he did! But of\nthe skill, approaching to original genius, with which he used the books\nfrom which he worked there is little dispute.\n\nMalory died leaving his work obviously unrevised, and in this condition\nit was brought to Caxton, who prepared it for the press with his usual\nenthusiasm in the cause of good literature, and also, it must be added,\nwith his usual carelessness. New chapters are sometimes made to begin in\nthe middle of a sentence, and in addition to simple misprints there are\nnumerous passages in which it is impossible to believe that we have the\ntext as Malory intended it to stand. After Caxton's edition Malory's\nmanuscript must have disappeared, and subsequent editions are\ndifferentiated only by the degree of closeness with which they follow\nthe first. Editions appeared printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1498 and\n1529, by William Copland in 1559, by Thomas East about 1585, and by\nThomas Stansby in 1634, each printer apparently taking the text of his\nimmediate predecessor and reproducing it with modifications. Stansby's\nedition served for reprints in 1816 and 1856 (the latter edited by\nThomas Wright); but in 1817 an edition supervised by Robert Southey went\nback to Caxton's text, though to a copy (only two are extant, and\nonly one perfect!) in which eleven leaves were supplied from Wynkyn\nde Worde's reprint. In 1868 Sir Edward Strachey produced for the\npresent publishers a reprint of Southey's text in modern spelling,\nwith the substitution of current words for those now obsolete, and the\nsoftening of a handful of passages likely, he thought, to prevent the\nbook being placed in the hands of boys. In 1889 a boon was conferred\non scholars by the publication of Dr. H. Oskar Sommer's page-for-page\nreprint of Caxton's text, with an elaborate discussion of Malory's\nsources. Dr. Sommer's edition was used by Sir E. Strachey to revise his\nGlobe text, and in 1897 Mr. Israel Gollancz produced for the \"Temple\nClassics\" a very pretty edition in which Sir Edward Strachey's\nprinciples of modernisation in spelling and punctuation were adopted,\nbut with the restoration of obsolete words and omitted phrases. As to\nthe present edition, Sir Edward Strachey altered with so sparing a hand\nthat on many pages differences between his version and that here printed\nwill be looked for in vain; but the most anxious care has been taken to\nproduce a text modernised as to its spelling, but in other respects in\naccurate accordance with Caxton's text, as represented by Dr Sommer's\nreprint. Obvious misprints have been silently corrected, but in a few\ncases notes show where emendations have been introduced from Wynkyn de\nWorde--not that Wynkyn had any more right to emend Caxton than we, but\nbecause even a printer's conjecture gains a little sanctity after four\ncenturies. The restoration of obsolete words has necessitated a much\nfuller glossary, and the index of names has therefore been separated\nfrom it and enlarged. In its present form the index is the work of Mr.\nHenry Littlehales.\n\n    A. W. POLLARD.\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE OF WILLIAM CAXTON\n\nAFTER that I had accomplished and finished divers histories, as well of\ncontemplation as of other historial and worldly acts of great conquerors\nand princes, and also certain books of ensamples and doctrine, many\nnoble and divers gentlemen of this realm of England came and demanded\nme many and oft times, wherefore that I have not do made and imprint\nthe noble history of the Saint Greal, and of the most renowned Christian\nking, first and chief of the three best Christian, and worthy, King\nArthur, which ought most to be remembered among us Englishmen to-fore\nall other Christian kings; for it is notoyrly known through the\nuniversal world, that there be nine worthy and the best that ever were,\nthat is to wit, three Paynims, three Jews, and three Christian men. As\nfor the Paynims, they were to-fore the Incarnation of Christ, which were\nnamed, the first Hector of Troy, of whom the history is comen both in\nballad and in prose, the second Alexander the Great, and the third\nJulius Caesar, Emperor of Rome, of whom the histories be well known and\nhad. And as for the three Jews, which also were to-fore the incarnation\nof our Lord, of whom the first was duke Joshua which brought the\nchildren of Israel into the land of behest, the second David king of\nJerusalem, and the third Judas Machabeus, of these three the Bible\nrehearseth all their noble histories and acts. And since the said\nIncarnation have been three noble Christian men, stalled and admitted\nthrough the universal world into the number of the nine best and worthy.\nOf whom was first the noble Arthur, whose noble acts I purpose to write\nin this present book here following. The second was Charlemain, or\nCharles the Great, of whom the history is had in many places, both in\nFrench and in English. And the third and last was Godfrey of Boloine, of\nwhose acts and life I made a book unto the excellent prince and king of\nnoble memory, King Edward the Fourth.\n\nThe said noble gentlemen instantly required me to imprint the history of\nthe said noble king and conqueror King Arthur, and of his knights, with\nthe history of the Saint Greal, and of the death and ending of the said\nArthur; affirming that I ought rather to imprint his acts and\nnoble feats, than of Godfrey of Boloine, or any of the other eight,\nconsidering that he was a man born within this realm, and king and\nemperor of the same: and that there be in French divers and many noble\nvolumes of his acts, and also of his knights. To whom I answered that\ndivers men hold opinion that there was no such Arthur, and that all\nsuch books as been made of him be feigned and fables, because that some\nchronicles make of him no mention, nor remember him nothing, nor of his\nknights. Whereto they answered, and one in special said, that in him\nthat should say or think that there was never such a king called Arthur\nmight well be aretted great folly and blindness. For he said that there\nwere many evidences of the contrary. First ye may see his sepulchre in\nthe monastery of Glastonbury. And also in Policronicon, in the fifth\nbook the sixth chapter, and in the seventh book the twenty-third\nchapter, where his body was buried, and after found, and translated into\nthe said monastery. Ye shall see also in the history of Bochas, in his\nbook De Casu Principum, part of his noble acts, and also of his fall.\nAlso Galfridus in his British book recounteth his life: and in divers\nplaces of England many remembrances be yet of him, and shall remain\nperpetually, and also of his knights. First in the abbey of Westminster,\nat St. Edward's shrine, remaineth the print of his seal in red wax\nclosed in beryl, in which is written, Patricius Arthurus Britannie,\nGallie, Germanie, Dacie, Imperator. Item in the castle of Dover ye may\nsee Gawaine's skull, and Cradok's mantle: at Winchester the Round Table:\nin other places Launcelot's sword and many other things. Then all these\nthings considered, there can no man reasonably gainsay but there was\na king of this land named Arthur. For in all places, Christian and\nheathen, he is reputed and taken for one of the nine worthy, and the\nfirst of the three Christian men. And also, he is more spoken of beyond\nthe sea, more books made of his noble acts, than there be in England, as\nwell in Dutch, Italian, Spanish, and Greekish, as in French. And yet of\nrecord remain in witness of him in Wales, in the town of Camelot, the\ngreat stones and the marvellous works of iron lying under the ground,\nand royal vaults, which divers now living have seen. Wherefore it is\na marvel why he is no more renowned in his own country, save only it\naccordeth to the Word of God, which saith that no man is accepted for a\nprophet in his own country.\n\nThen all these things aforesaid alleged, I could not well deny but that\nthere was such a noble king named Arthur, and reputed one of the nine\nworthy, and first and chief of the Christian men. And many noble volumes\nbe made of him and of his noble knights in French, which I have seen\nand read beyond the sea, which be not had in our maternal tongue. But in\nWelsh be many and also in French, and some in English but nowhere nigh\nall. Wherefore, such as have late been drawn out briefly into English\nI have after the simple conning that God hath sent to me, under the\nfavour and correction of all noble lords and gentlemen, enprised to\nimprint a book of the noble histories of the said King Arthur, and of\ncertain of his knights, after a copy unto me delivered, which copy Sir\nThomas Malorye did take out of certain books of French, and reduced it\ninto English. And I, according to my copy, have done set it in imprint,\nto the intent that noble men may see and learn the noble acts of\nchivalry, the gentle and virtuous deeds that some knights used in those\ndays, by which they came to honour, and how they that were vicious were\npunished and oft put to shame and rebuke; humbly beseeching all noble\nlords and ladies, with all other estates of what estate or degree they\nbeen of, that shall see and read in this said book and work, that they\ntake the good and honest acts in their remembrance, and to follow the\nsame. Wherein they shall find many joyous and pleasant histories, and\nnoble and renowned acts of humanity, gentleness, and chivalry.

How Uther Pendragon sent for the duke of Cornwall and Igraine\nhis wife, and of their departing suddenly again.\n\nIT befell in the days of Uther Pendragon, when he was king of all\nEngland, and so reigned, that there was a mighty duke in Cornwall that\nheld war against him long time. And the duke was called the Duke of\nTintagil. And so by means King Uther sent for this duke, charging him to\nbring his wife with him, for she was called a fair lady, and a passing\nwise, and her name was called Igraine.\n\nSo when the duke and his wife were come unto the king, by the means of\ngreat lords they were accorded both. The king liked and loved this lady\nwell, and he made them great cheer out of measure, and desired to have\nlain by her. But she was a passing good woman, and would not assent unto\nthe king. And then she told the duke her husband, and said, I suppose\nthat we were sent for that I should be dishonoured; wherefore, husband,\nI counsel you, that we depart from hence suddenly, that we may ride\nall night unto our own castle. And in like wise as she said so they\ndeparted, that neither the king nor none of his council were ware of\ntheir departing. All so soon as King Uther knew of their departing\nso suddenly, he was wonderly wroth. Then he called to him his privy\ncouncil, and told them of the sudden departing of the duke and his wife.\n\n\nThen they advised the king to send for the duke and his wife by a great\ncharge; and if he will not come at your summons, then may ye do your\nbest, then have ye cause to make mighty war upon him. So that was done,\nand the messengers had their answers; and that was this shortly, that\nneither he nor his wife would not come at him.\n\nThen was the king wonderly wroth. And then the king sent him plain word\nagain, and bade him be ready and stuff him and garnish him, for within\nforty days he would fetch him out of the biggest castle that he hath.\n\nWhen the duke had this warning, anon he went and furnished and garnished\ntwo strong castles of his, of the which the one hight Tintagil, and\nthe other castle hight Terrabil. So his wife Dame Igraine he put in the\ncastle of Tintagil, and himself he put in the castle of Terrabil, the\nwhich had many issues and posterns out. Then in all haste came Uther\nwith a great host, and laid a siege about the castle of Terrabil. And\nthere he pight many pavilions, and there was great war made on both\nparties, and much people slain. Then for pure anger and for great love\nof fair Igraine the king Uther fell sick. So came to the king Uther Sir\nUlfius, a noble knight, and asked the king why he was sick. I shall tell\nthee, said the king, I am sick for anger and for love of fair Igraine,\nthat I may not be whole. Well, my lord, said Sir Ulfius, I shall seek\nMerlin, and he shall do you remedy, that your heart shall be pleased. So\nUlfius departed, and by adventure he met Merlin in a beggar's array, and\nthere Merlin asked Ulfius whom he sought. And he said he had little\nado to tell him. Well, said Merlin, I know whom thou seekest, for thou\nseekest Merlin; therefore seek no farther, for I am he; and if King\nUther will well reward me, and be sworn unto me to fulfil my desire,\nthat shall be his honour and profit more than mine; for I shall cause\nhim to have all his desire. All this will I undertake, said Ulfius, that\nthere shall be nothing reasonable but thou shalt have thy desire. Well,\nsaid Merlin, he shall have his intent and desire. And therefore, said\nMerlin, ride on your way, for I will not be long behind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How Uther Pendragon made war on the duke of Cornwall, and\nhow by the mean of Merlin he lay by the duchess and gat Arthur.\n\nTHEN Ulfius was glad, and rode on more than a pace till that he came to\nKing Uther Pendragon, and told him he had met with Merlin. Where is he?\nsaid the king. Sir, said Ulfius, he will not dwell long. Therewithal\nUlfius was ware where Merlin stood at the porch of the pavilion's door.\nAnd then Merlin was bound to come to the king. When King Uther saw him,\nhe said he was welcome. Sir, said Merlin, I know all your heart every\ndeal; so ye will be sworn unto me as ye be a true king anointed, to\nfulfil my desire, ye shall have your desire. Then the king was sworn\nupon the Four Evangelists. Sir, said Merlin, this is my desire: the\nfirst night that ye shall lie by Igraine ye shall get a child on her,\nand when that is born, that it shall be delivered to me for to nourish\nthere as I will have it; for it shall be your worship, and the child's\navail, as mickle as the child is worth. I will well, said the king, as\nthou wilt have it. Now make you ready, said Merlin, this night ye shall\nlie with Igraine in the castle of Tintagil; and ye shall be like the\nduke her husband, Ulfius shall be like Sir Brastias, a knight of the\nduke's, and I will be like a knight that hight Sir Jordanus, a knight\nof the duke's. But wait ye make not many questions with her nor her men,\nbut say ye are diseased, and so hie you to bed, and rise not on the morn\ntill I come to you, for the castle of Tintagil is but ten miles hence;\nso this was done as they devised. But the duke of Tintagil espied how\nthe king rode from the siege of Terrabil, and therefore that night he\nissued out of the castle at a postern for to have distressed the king's\nhost. And so, through his own issue, the duke himself was slain or ever\nthe king came at the castle of Tintagil.\n\n\nSo after the death of the duke, King Uther lay with Igraine more than\nthree hours after his death, and begat on her that night Arthur, and\non day came Merlin to the king, and bade him make him ready, and so he\nkissed the lady Igraine and departed in all haste. But when the lady\nheard tell of the duke her husband, and by all record he was dead or\never King Uther came to her, then she marvelled who that might be that\nlay with her in likeness of her lord; so she mourned privily and held\nher peace. Then all the barons by one assent prayed the king of accord\nbetwixt the lady Igraine and him; the king gave them leave, for fain\nwould he have been accorded with her. So the king put all the trust in\nUlfius to entreat between them, so by the entreaty at the last the king\nand she met together. Now will we do well, said Ulfius, our king is a\nlusty knight and wifeless, and my lady Igraine is a passing fair lady;\nit were great joy unto us all, an it might please the king to make her\nhis queen. Unto that they all well accorded and moved it to the king.\nAnd anon, like a lusty knight, he assented thereto with good will, and\nso in all haste they were married in a morning with great mirth and joy.\n\nAnd King Lot of Lothian and of Orkney then wedded Margawse that was\nGawaine's mother, and King Nentres of the land of Garlot wedded Elaine.\nAll this was done at the request of King Uther. And the third sister\nMorgan le Fay was put to school in a nunnery, and there she learned so\nmuch that she was a great clerk of necromancy. And after she was\nwedded to King Uriens of the land of Gore, that was Sir Ewain's le\nBlanchemain's father.\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Of the birth of King Arthur and of his nurture.\n\nTHEN Queen Igraine waxed daily greater and greater, so it befell after\nwithin half a year, as King Uther lay by his queen, he asked her, by the\nfaith she owed to him, whose was the body; then she sore abashed to give\nanswer. Dismay you not, said the king, but tell me the truth, and I\nshall love you the better, by the faith of my body. Sir, said she, I\nshall tell you the truth. The same night that my lord was dead, the hour\nof his death, as his knights record, there came into my castle of\nTintagil a man like my lord in speech and in countenance, and two\nknights with him in likeness of his two knights Brastias and Jordanus,\nand so I went unto bed with him as I ought to do with my lord, and the\nsame night, as I shall answer unto God, this child was begotten upon me.\nThat is truth, said the king, as ye say; for it was I myself that came\nin the likeness, and therefore dismay you not, for I am father of the\nchild; and there he told her all the cause, how it was by Merlin's\ncounsel. Then the queen made great joy when she knew who was the father\nof her child.\n\nSoon came Merlin unto the king, and said, Sir, ye must purvey you for\nthe nourishing of your child. As thou wilt, said the king, be it. Well,\nsaid Merlin, I know a lord of yours in this land, that is a passing true\nman and a faithful, and he shall have the nourishing of your child, and\nhis name is Sir Ector, and he is a lord of fair livelihood in many parts\nin England and Wales; and this lord, Sir Ector, let him be sent for, for\nto come and speak with you, and desire him yourself, as he loveth you,\nthat he will put his own child to nourishing to another woman, and that\nhis wife nourish yours. And when the child is born let it be delivered\nto me at yonder privy postern unchristened. So like as Merlin devised it\nwas done. And when Sir Ector was come he made fiaunce to the king for to\nnourish the child like as the king desired; and there the king granted\nSir Ector great rewards. Then when the lady was delivered, the king\ncommanded two knights and two ladies to take the child, bound in a cloth\nof gold, and that ye deliver him to what poor man ye meet at the postern\ngate of the castle. So the child was delivered unto Merlin, and so he\nbare it forth unto Sir Ector, and made an holy man to christen him, and\nnamed him Arthur; and so Sir Ector's wife nourished him with her own\npap.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. Of the death of King Uther Pendragon.\n\nTHEN within two years King Uther fell sick of a great malady. And in the\nmeanwhile his enemies usurped upon him, and did a great battle upon his\nmen, and slew many of his people. Sir, said Merlin, ye may not lie so as\nye do, for ye must to the field though ye ride on an horse-litter: for\nye shall never have the better of your enemies but if your person be\nthere, and then shall ye have the victory. So it was done as Merlin had\ndevised, and they carried the king forth in an horse-litter with a great\nhost towards his enemies. And at St. Albans there met with the king a\ngreat host of the North. And that day Sir Ulfius and Sir Brastias did\ngreat deeds of arms, and King Uther's men overcame the Northern battle\nand slew many people, and put the remnant to flight. And then the king\nreturned unto London, and made great joy of his victory. And then he\nfell passing sore sick, so that three days and three nights he was\nspeechless: wherefore all the barons made great sorrow, and asked Merlin\nwhat counsel were best. There is none other remedy, said Merlin, but God\nwill have his will. But look ye all barons be before King Uther to-morn,\nand God and I shall make him to speak. So on the morn all the barons\nwith Merlin came to-fore the king; then Merlin said aloud unto King\nUther, Sir, shall your son Arthur be king after your days, of this realm\nwith all the appurtenance? Then Uther Pendragon turned him, and said\nin hearing of them all, I give him God's blessing and mine, and bid him\npray for my soul, and righteously and worshipfully that he claim the\ncrown, upon forfeiture of my blessing; and therewith he yielded up\nthe ghost, and then was he interred as longed to a king. Wherefore the\nqueen, fair Igraine, made great sorrow, and all the barons.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How Arthur was chosen king, and of wonders and marvels of a\nsword taken out of a stone by the said Arthur.\n\nTHEN stood the realm in great jeopardy long while, for every lord that\nwas mighty of men made him strong, and many weened to have been king.\nThen Merlin went to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and counselled him for\nto send for all the lords of the realm, and all the gentlemen of arms,\nthat they should to London come by Christmas, upon pain of cursing; and\nfor this cause, that Jesus, that was born on that night, that he would\nof his great mercy show some miracle, as he was come to be king of\nmankind, for to show some miracle who should be rightwise king of this\nrealm. So the Archbishop, by the advice of Merlin, sent for all the\nlords and gentlemen of arms that they should come by Christmas even\nunto London. And many of them made them clean of their life, that their\nprayer might be the more acceptable unto God. So in the greatest church\nof London, whether it were Paul's or not the French book maketh no\nmention, all the estates were long or day in the church for to pray.\nAnd when matins and the first mass was done, there was seen in the\nchurchyard, against the high altar, a great stone four square, like unto\na marble stone; and in midst thereof was like an anvil of steel a foot\non high, and therein stuck a fair sword naked by the point, and letters\nthere were written in gold about the sword that said thus:--Whoso\npulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is rightwise king\nborn of all England. Then the people marvelled, and told it to the\nArchbishop. I command, said the Archbishop, that ye keep you within your\nchurch and pray unto God still, that no man touch the sword till the\nhigh mass be all done. So when all masses were done all the lords went\nto behold the stone and the sword. And when they saw the scripture some\nassayed, such as would have been king. But none might stir the sword\nnor move it. He is not here, said the Archbishop, that shall achieve the\nsword, but doubt not God will make him known. But this is my counsel,\nsaid the Archbishop, that we let purvey ten knights, men of good fame,\nand they to keep this sword. So it was ordained, and then there was made\na cry, that every man should assay that would, for to win the sword. And\nupon New Year's Day the barons let make a jousts and a tournament, that\nall knights that would joust or tourney there might play, and all this\nwas ordained for to keep the lords together and the commons, for the\nArchbishop trusted that God would make him known that should win the\nsword.\n\nSo upon New Year's Day, when the service was done, the barons rode unto\nthe field, some to joust and some to tourney, and so it happened that\nSir Ector, that had great livelihood about London, rode unto the\njousts, and with him rode Sir Kay his son, and young Arthur that was his\nnourished brother; and Sir Kay was made knight at All Hallowmass afore.\nSo as they rode to the jousts-ward, Sir Kay lost his sword, for he had\nleft it at his father's lodging, and so he prayed young Arthur for to\nride for his sword. I will well, said Arthur, and rode fast after the\nsword, and when he came home, the lady and all were out to see the\njousting. Then was Arthur wroth, and said to himself, I will ride to the\nchurchyard, and take the sword with me that sticketh in the stone, for\nmy brother Sir Kay shall not be without a sword this day. So when he\ncame to the churchyard, Sir Arthur alighted and tied his horse to the\nstile, and so he went to the tent, and found no knights there, for they\nwere at the jousting. And so he handled the sword by the handles, and\nlightly and fiercely pulled it out of the stone, and took his horse and\nrode his way until he came to his brother Sir Kay, and delivered him\nthe sword. And as soon as Sir Kay saw the sword, he wist well it was the\nsword of the stone, and so he rode to his father Sir Ector, and said:\nSir, lo here is the sword of the stone, wherefore I must be king of this\nland. When Sir Ector beheld the sword, he returned again and came to the\nchurch, and there they alighted all three, and went into the church. And\nanon he made Sir Kay swear upon a book how he came to that sword. Sir,\nsaid Sir Kay, by my brother Arthur, for he brought it to me. How gat ye\nthis sword? said Sir Ector to Arthur. Sir, I will tell you. When I came\nhome for my brother's sword, I found nobody at home to deliver me his\nsword; and so I thought my brother Sir Kay should not be swordless, and\nso I came hither eagerly and pulled it out of the stone without any\npain. Found ye any knights about this sword? said Sir Ector. Nay, said\nArthur. Now, said Sir Ector to Arthur, I understand ye must be king of\nthis land. Wherefore I, said Arthur, and for what cause? Sir, said\nEctor, for God will have it so; for there should never man have drawn\nout this sword, but he that shall be rightwise king of this land. Now\nlet me see whether ye can put the sword there as it was, and pull it out\nagain. That is no mastery, said Arthur, and so he put it in the stone;\nwherewithal Sir Ector assayed to pull out the sword and failed.\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How King Arthur pulled out the sword divers times.\n\nNow assay, said Sir Ector unto Sir Kay. And anon he pulled at the sword\nwith all his might; but it would not be. Now shall ye assay, said Sir\nEctor to Arthur. I will well, said Arthur, and pulled it out easily. And\ntherewithal Sir Ector knelt down to the earth, and Sir Kay. Alas, said\nArthur, my own dear father and brother, why kneel ye to me? Nay, nay,\nmy lord Arthur, it is not so; I was never your father nor of your blood,\nbut I wot well ye are of an higher blood than I weened ye were. And then\nSir Ector told him all, how he was betaken him for to nourish him, and\nby whose commandment, and by Merlin's deliverance.\n\n\nThen Arthur made great dole when he understood that Sir Ector was not\nhis father. Sir, said Ector unto Arthur, will ye be my good and gracious\nlord when ye are king? Else were I to blame, said Arthur, for ye are the\nman in the world that I am most beholden to, and my good lady and mother\nyour wife, that as well as her own hath fostered me and kept. And if\never it be God's will that I be king as ye say, ye shall desire of me\nwhat I may do, and I shall not fail you; God forbid I should fail you\nSir, said Sir Ector, I will ask no more of you, but that ye will make\nmy son, your foster brother, Sir Kay, seneschal of all your lands. That\nshall be done, said Arthur, and more, by the faith of my body, that\nnever man shall have that office but he, while he and I live Therewithal\nthey went unto the Archbishop, and told him how the sword was achieved,\nand by whom; and on Twelfth-day all the barons came thither, and to\nassay to take the sword, who that would assay. But there afore them all,\nthere might none take it out but Arthur; wherefore there were many lords\nwroth, and said it was great shame unto them all and the realm, to be\novergoverned with a boy of no high blood born. And so they fell out at\nthat time that it was put off till Candlemas and then all the barons\nshould meet there again; but always the ten knights were ordained to\nwatch the sword day and night, and so they set a pavilion over the stone\nand the sword, and five always watched. So at Candlemas many more great\nlords came thither for to have won the sword, but there might none\nprevail. And right as Arthur did at Christmas, he did at Candlemas, and\npulled out the sword easily, whereof the barons were sore aggrieved and\nput it off in delay till the high feast of Easter. And as Arthur sped\nbefore, so did he at Easter; yet there were some of the great lords had\nindignation that Arthur should be king, and put it off in a delay till\nthe feast of Pentecost.\n\nThen the Archbishop of Canterbury by Merlin's providence let purvey\nthen of the best knights that they might get, and such knights as Uther\nPendragon loved best and most trusted in his days. And such knights were\nput about Arthur as Sir Baudwin of Britain, Sir Kay, Sir Ulfius, Sir\nBrastias. All these, with many other, were always about Arthur, day and\nnight, till the feast of Pentecost.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. How King Arthur was crowned, and how he made officers.\n\nAND at the feast of Pentecost all manner of men assayed to pull at the\nsword that would assay; but none might prevail but Arthur, and pulled it\nout afore all the lords and commons that were there, wherefore all the\ncommons cried at once, We will have Arthur unto our king, we will put\nhim no more in delay, for we all see that it is God's will that he shall\nbe our king, and who that holdeth against it, we will slay him. And\ntherewithal they kneeled at once, both rich and poor, and cried Arthur\nmercy because they had delayed him so long, and Arthur forgave them,\nand took the sword between both his hands, and offered it upon the altar\nwhere the Archbishop was, and so was he made knight of the best man that\nwas there. And so anon was the coronation made. And there was he sworn\nunto his lords and the commons for to be a true king, to stand with true\njustice from thenceforth the days of this life. Also then he made all\nlords that held of the crown to come in, and to do service as they ought\nto do. And many complaints were made unto Sir Arthur of great wrongs\nthat were done since the death of King Uther, of many lands that were\nbereaved lords, knights, ladies, and gentlemen. Wherefore King Arthur\nmade the lands to be given again unto them that owned them.\n\nWhen this was done, that the king had stablished all the countries about\nLondon, then he let make Sir Kay seneschal of England; and Sir Baudwin\nof Britain was made constable; and Sir Ulfius was made chamberlain; and\nSir Brastias was made warden to wait upon the north from Trent forwards,\nfor it was that time the most party the king's enemies. But within few\nyears after Arthur won all the north, Scotland, and all that were under\ntheir obeissance. Also Wales, a part of it, held against Arthur, but he\novercame them all, as he did the remnant, through the noble prowess of\nhimself and his knights of the Round Table.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How King Arthur held in Wales, at a Pentecost, a great\nfeast, and what kings and lords came to his feast.\n\nTHEN the king removed into Wales, and let cry a great feast that it\nshould be holden at Pentecost after the incoronation of him at the city\nof Carlion. Unto the feast came King Lot of Lothian and of Orkney, with\nfive hundred knights with him. Also there came to the feast King Uriens\nof Gore with four hundred knights with him. Also there came to that\nfeast King Nentres of Garlot, with seven hundred knights with him. Also\nthere came to the feast the king of Scotland with six hundred knights\nwith him, and he was but a young man. Also there came to the feast a\nking that was called the King with the Hundred Knights, but he and his\nmen were passing well beseen at all points. Also there came the king\nof Carados with five hundred knights. And King Arthur was glad of their\ncoming, for he weened that all the kings and knights had come for great\nlove, and to have done him worship at his feast; wherefore the king made\ngreat joy, and sent the kings and knights great presents. But the kings\nwould none receive, but rebuked the messengers shamefully, and said they\nhad no joy to receive no gifts of a beardless boy that was come of low\nblood, and sent him word they would none of his gifts, but that they\nwere come to give him gifts with hard swords betwixt the neck and\nthe shoulders: and therefore they came thither, so they told to the\nmessengers plainly, for it was great shame to all them to see such a boy\nto have a rule of so noble a realm as this land was. With this answer\nthe messengers departed and told to King Arthur this answer. Wherefore,\nby the advice of his barons, he took him to a strong tower with five\nhundred good men with him. And all the kings aforesaid in a manner laid\na siege to-fore him, but King Arthur was well victualed. And within\nfifteen days there came Merlin among them into the city of Carlion. Then\nall the kings were passing glad of Merlin, and asked him, For what cause\nis that boy Arthur made your king? Sirs, said Merlin, I shall tell you\nthe cause, for he is King Uther Pendragon's son, born in wedlock, gotten\non Igraine, the duke's wife of Tintagil. Then is he a bastard, they said\nall. Nay, said Merlin, after the death of the duke, more than three\nhours, was Arthur begotten, and thirteen days after King Uther wedded\nIgraine; and therefore I prove him he is no bastard. And who saith nay,\nhe shall be king and overcome all his enemies; and, or he die, he shall\nbe long king of all England, and have under his obeissance Wales,\nIreland, and Scotland, and more realms than I will now rehearse. Some of\nthe kings had marvel of Merlin's words, and deemed well that it should\nbe as he said; and some of them laughed him to scorn, as King Lot; and\nmore other called him a witch. But then were they accorded with Merlin,\nthat King Arthur should come out and speak with the kings, and to come\nsafe and to go safe, such surance there was made. So Merlin went unto\nKing Arthur, and told him how he had done, and bade him fear not, but\ncome out boldly and speak with them, and spare them not, but answer them\nas their king and chieftain; for ye shall overcome them all, whether\nthey will or nill.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. Of the first war that King Arthur had, and how he won the\nfield.\n\nTHEN King Arthur came out of his tower, and had under his gown a\njesseraunt of double mail, and there went with him the Archbishop of\nCanterbury, and Sir Baudwin of Britain, and Sir Kay, and Sir Brastias:\nthese were the men of most worship that were with him. And when they\nwere met there was no meekness, but stout words on both sides; but\nalways King Arthur answered them, and said he would make them to bow an\nhe lived. Wherefore they departed with wrath, and King Arthur bade keep\nthem well, and they bade the king keep him well. So the king returned\nhim to the tower again and armed him and all his knights. What will ye\ndo? said Merlin to the kings; ye were better for to stint, for ye shall\nnot here prevail though ye were ten times so many. Be we well advised to\nbe afeared of a dream-reader? said King Lot. With that Merlin vanished\naway, and came to King Arthur, and bade him set on them fiercely; and in\nthe meanwhile there were three hundred good men, of the best that were\nwith the kings, that went straight unto King Arthur, and that comforted\nhim greatly. Sir, said Merlin to Arthur, fight not with the sword that\nye had by miracle, till that ye see ye go unto the worse, then draw it\nout and do your best. So forthwithal King Arthur set upon them in their\nlodging. And Sir Baudwin, Sir Kay, and Sir Brastias slew on the right\nhand and on the left hand that it was marvel; and always King Arthur on\nhorseback laid on with a sword, and did marvellous deeds of arms, that\nmany of the kings had great joy of his deeds and hardiness.\n\nThen King Lot brake out on the back side, and the King with the Hundred\nKnights, and King Carados, and set on Arthur fiercely behind him. With\nthat Sir Arthur turned with his knights, and smote behind and before,\nand ever Sir Arthur was in the foremost press till his horse was slain\nunderneath him. And therewith King Lot smote down King Arthur. With that\nhis four knights received him and set him on horseback. Then he drew his\nsword Excalibur, but it was so bright in his enemies' eyes, that it gave\nlight like thirty torches. And therewith he put them a-back, and slew\nmuch people. And then the commons of Carlion arose with clubs and staves\nand slew many knights; but all the kings held them together with their\nknights that were left alive, and so fled and departed. And Merlin came\nunto Arthur, and counselled him to follow them no further.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How Merlin counselled King Arthur to send for King Ban and\nKing Bors, and of their counsel taken for the war.\n\nSO after the feast and journey, King Arthur drew him unto London, and so\nby the counsel of Merlin, the king let call his barons to council, for\nMerlin had told the king that the six kings that made war upon him would\nin all haste be awroke on him and on his lands. Wherefore the king asked\ncounsel at them all. They could no counsel give, but said they were big\nenough. Ye say well, said Arthur; I thank you for your good courage, but\nwill ye all that loveth me speak with Merlin? ye know well that he hath\ndone much for me, and he knoweth many things, and when he is afore you,\nI would that ye prayed him heartily of his best advice. All the barons\nsaid they would pray him and desire him. So Merlin was sent for, and\nfair desired of all the barons to give them best counsel. I shall say\nyou, said Merlin, I warn you all, your enemies are passing strong for\nyou, and they are good men of arms as be alive, and by this time they\nhave gotten to them four kings more, and a mighty duke; and unless that\nour king have more chivalry with him than he may make within the bounds\nof his own realm, an he fight with them in battle, he shall be overcome\nand slain. What were best to do in this cause? said all the barons. I\nshall tell you, said Merlin, mine advice; there are two brethren beyond\nthe sea, and they be kings both, and marvellous good men of their hands;\nand that one hight King Ban of Benwick, and that other hight King Bors\nof Gaul, that is France. And on these two kings warreth a mighty man of\nmen, the King Claudas, and striveth with them for a castle, and great\nwar is betwixt them. But this Claudas is so mighty of goods whereof he\ngetteth good knights, that he putteth these two kings most part to the\nworse; wherefore this is my counsel, that our king and sovereign lord\nsend unto the kings Ban and Bors by two trusty knights with letters well\ndevised, that an they will come and see King Arthur and his court, and\nso help him in his wars, that he will be sworn unto them to help them\nin their wars against King Claudas. Now, what say ye unto this counsel?\nsaid Merlin. This is well counselled, said the king and all the barons.\n\nRight so in all haste there were ordained to go two knights on the\nmessage unto the two kings. So were there made letters in the pleasant\nwise according unto King Arthur's desire. Ulfius and Brastias were made\nthe messengers, and so rode forth well horsed and well armed and as the\nguise was that time, and so passed the sea and rode toward the city of\nBenwick. And there besides were eight knights that espied them, and at\na strait passage they met with Ulfius and Brastias, and would have taken\nthem prisoners; so they prayed them that they might pass, for they were\nmessengers unto King Ban and Bors sent from King Arthur. Therefore, said\nthe eight knights, ye shall die or be prisoners, for we be knights of\nKing Claudas. And therewith two of them dressed their spears, and Ulfius\nand Brastias dressed their spears, and ran together with great raundom.\nAnd Claudas' knights brake their spears, and theirs to-held and bare the\ntwo knights out of their saddles to the earth, and so left them lying,\nand rode their ways. And the other six knights rode afore to a passage\nto meet with them again, and so Ulfius and Brastias smote other two\ndown, and so passed on their ways. And at the fourth passage there met\ntwo for two, and both were laid unto the earth; so there was none of\nthe eight knights but he was sore hurt or bruised. And when they come to\nBenwick it fortuned there were both kings, Ban and Bors.\n\n\nAnd when it was told the kings that there were come messengers, there\nwere sent unto them two knights of worship, the one hight Lionses, lord\nof the country of Payarne, and Sir Phariance a worshipful knight. Anon\nthey asked from whence they came, and they said from King Arthur, king\nof England; so they took them in their arms and made great joy each of\nother. But anon, as the two kings wist they were messengers of Arthur's,\nthere was made no tarrying, but forthwith they spake with the knights,\nand welcomed them in the faithfullest wise, and said they were most\nwelcome unto them before all the kings living; and therewith they kissed\nthe letters and delivered them. And when Ban and Bors understood the\nletters, then they were more welcome than they were before. And after\nthe haste of the letters they gave them this answer, that they would\nfulfil the desire of King Arthur's writing, and Ulfius and Brastias,\ntarry there as long as they would, they should have such cheer as might\nbe made them in those marches. Then Ulfius and Brastias told the kings\nof the adventure at their passages of the eight knights. Ha! ah! said\nBan and Bors, they were my good friends. I would I had wist of them;\nthey should not have escaped so. So Ulfius and Brastias had good cheer\nand great gifts, as much as they might bear away; and had their answer\nby mouth and by writing, that those two kings would come unto Arthur\nin all the haste that they might. So the two knights rode on afore, and\npassed the sea, and came to their lord, and told him how they had sped,\nwhereof King Arthur was passing glad. At what time suppose ye the two\nkings will be here? Sir, said they, afore All Hallowmass. Then the king\nlet purvey for a great feast, and let cry a great jousts. And by All\nHallowmass the two kings were come over the sea with three hundred\nknights well arrayed both for the peace and for the war. And King Arthur\nmet with them ten mile out of London, and there was great joy as could\nbe thought or made. And on All Hallowmass at the great feast, sat in the\nhall the three kings, and Sir Kay seneschal served in the hall, and Sir\nLucas the butler, that was Duke Corneus' son, and Sir Griflet, that was\nthe son of Cardol, these three knights had the rule of all the service\nthat served the kings. And anon, as they had washen and risen, all\nknights that would joust made them ready; by then they were ready on\nhorseback there were seven hundred knights. And Arthur, Ban, and Bors,\nwith the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Sir Ector, Kay's father, they\nwere in a place covered with cloth of gold like an hall, with ladies and\ngentlewomen, for to behold who did best, and thereon to give judgment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. Of a great tourney made by King Arthur and the two kings Ban\nand Bors, and how they went over the sea.\n\nAND King Arthur and the two kings let depart the seven hundred knights\nin two parties. And there were three hundred knights of the realm of\nBenwick and of Gaul turned on the other side. Then they dressed their\nshields, and began to couch their spears many good knights. So Griflet\nwas the first that met with a knight, one Ladinas, and they met so\neagerly that all men had wonder; and they so fought that their shields\nfell to pieces, and horse and man fell to the earth; and both the French\nknight and the English knight lay so long that all men weened they had\nbeen dead. When Lucas the butler saw Griflet so lie, he horsed him again\nanon, and they two did marvellous deeds of arms with many bachelors.\nAlso Sir Kay came out of an ambushment with five knights with him, and\nthey six smote other six down. But Sir Kay did that day marvellous deeds\nof arms, that there was none did so well as he that day. Then there came\nLadinas and Gracian, two knights of France, and did passing well, that\nall men praised them.\n\nThen came there Sir Placidas, a good knight, and met with Sir Kay, and\nsmote him down horse and man, where fore Sir Griflet was wroth, and met\nwith Sir Placidas so hard, that horse and man fell to the earth. But\nwhen the five knights wist that Sir Kay had a fall, they were wroth out\nof wit, and therewith each of them five bare down a knight. When King\nArthur and the two kings saw them begin to wax wroth on both parties,\nthey leapt on small hackneys, and let cry that all men should depart\nunto their lodging. And so they went home and unarmed them, and so to\nevensong and supper. And after, the three kings went into a garden, and\ngave the prize unto Sir Kay, and to Lucas the butler, and unto Sir\nGriflet. And then they went unto council, and with them Gwenbaus, the\nbrother unto Sir Ban and Bors, a wise clerk, and thither went Ulfius and\nBrastias, and Merlin. And after they had been in council, they went unto\nbed. And on the morn they heard mass, and to dinner, and so to their\ncouncil, and made many arguments what were best to do. At the last they\nwere concluded, that Merlin should go with a token of King Ban, and that\nwas a ring, unto his men and King Bors'; and Gracian and Placidas should\ngo again and keep their castles and their countries, as for [dread of\nKing Claudas] King Ban of Benwick, and King Bors of Gaul had ordained\nthem, and so passed the sea and came to Benwick. And when the people saw\nKing Ban's ring, and Gracian and Placidas, they were glad, and asked how\nthe kings fared, and made great joy of their welfare and cording, and\naccording unto the sovereign lords desire, the men of war made them\nready in all haste possible, so that they were fifteen thousand on horse\nand foot, and they had great plenty of victual with them, by Merlin's\nprovision. But Gracian and Placidas were left to furnish and garnish the\ncastles, for dread of King Claudas. Right so Merlin passed the sea, well\nvictualled both by water and by land. And when he came to the sea he\nsent home the footmen again, and took no more with him but ten thousand\nmen on horseback, the most part men of arms, and so shipped and passed\nthe sea into England, and landed at Dover; and through the wit of\nMerlin, he had the host northward, the priviest way that could be\nthought, unto the forest of Bedegraine, and there in a valley he lodged\nthem secretly.\n\nThen rode Merlin unto Arthur and the two kings, and told them how he had\nsped; whereof they had great marvel, that man on earth might speed so\nsoon, and go and come. So Merlin told them ten thousand were in the\nforest of Bedegraine, well armed at all points. Then was there no more\nto say, but to horseback went all the host as Arthur had afore purveyed.\nSo with twenty thousand he passed by night and day, but there was made\nsuch an ordinance afore by Merlin, that there should no man of war ride\nnor go in no country on this side Trent water, but if he had a token\nfrom King Arthur, where through the king's enemies durst not ride as\nthey did to-fore to espy.\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How eleven kings gathered a great host against King Arthur.\n\n\nAND SO within a little space the three kings came unto the castle of\nBedegraine, and found there a passing fair fellowship, and well beseen,\nwhereof they had great joy, and victual they wanted none. This was the\ncause of the northern host: that they were reared for the despite and\nrebuke the six kings had at Carlion. And those six kings by their means,\ngat unto them five other kings; and thus they began to gather their\npeople.\n\nAnd now they sware that for weal nor woe, they should not leave other,\ntill they had destroyed Arthur. And then they made an oath. The first\nthat began the oath was the Duke of Cambenet, that he would bring with\nhim five thousand men of arms, the which were ready on horseback. Then\nsware King Brandegoris of Stranggore that he would bring five thousand\nmen of arms on horseback. Then sware King Clariance of Northumberland he\nwould bring three thousand men of arms. Then sware the King of the\nHundred Knights, that was a passing good man and a young, that he would\nbring four thousand men of arms on horseback. Then there swore King Lot,\na passing good knight, and Sir Gawain's father, that he would bring five\nthousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King Urience, that\nwas Sir Uwain's father, of the land of Gore, and he would bring six\nthousand men of arms on horseback. Also there swore King Idres of\nCornwall, that he would bring five thousand men of arms on horseback.\nAlso there swore King Cradelmas to bring five thousand men on horseback.\nAlso there swore King Agwisance of Ireland to bring five thousand men of\narms on horseback. Also there swore King Nentres to bring five thousand\nmen of arms on horseback. Also there swore King Carados to bring five\nthousand men of arms on horseback. So their whole host was of clean men\nof arms on horseback fifty thousand, and a-foot ten thousand of good\nmen's bodies. Then were they soon ready, and mounted upon horse and sent\nforth their fore-riders, for these eleven kings in their ways laid a\nsiege unto the castle of Bedegraine; and so they departed and drew\ntoward Arthur, and left few to abide at the siege, for the castle of\nBedegraine was holden of King Arthur, and the men that were therein were\nArthur's.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. Of a dream of the King with the Hundred Knights.\n\nSo by Merlin's advice there were sent fore-riders to skim the country,\nand they met with the fore-riders of the north, and made them to tell\nwhich way the host came, and then they told it to Arthur, and by King\nBan and Bors' council they let burn and destroy all the country afore\nthem, there they should ride.\n\nThe King with the Hundred Knights met a wonder dream two nights afore\nthe battle, that there blew a great wind, and blew down their castles\nand their towns, and after that came a water and bare it all away. All\nthat heard of the sweven said it was a token of great battle. Then by\ncounsel of Merlin, when they wist which way the eleven kings would ride\nand lodge that night, at midnight they set upon them, as they were in\ntheir pavilions. But the scout-watch by their host cried, Lords! at\narms! for here be your enemies at your hand!\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How the eleven kings with their host fought against Arthur\nand his host, and many great feats of the war.\n\nTHEN King Arthur and King Ban and King Bors, with their good and trusty\nknights, set on them so fiercely that they made them overthrow their\npavilions on their heads, but the eleven kings, by manly prowess of\narms, took a fair champaign, but there was slain that morrowtide ten\nthousand good men's bodies. And so they had afore them a strong passage,\nyet were they fifty thousand of hardy men. Then it drew toward day. Now\nshall ye do by mine advice, said Merlin unto the three kings: I would\nthat King Ban and King Bors, with their fellowship of ten thousand men,\nwere put in a wood here beside, in an ambushment, and keep them privy,\nand that they be laid or the light of the day come, and that they stir\nnot till ye and your knights have fought with them long. And when it is\ndaylight, dress your battle even afore them and the passage, that they\nmay see all your host, for then will they be the more hardy, when they\nsee you but about twenty thousand men, and cause them to be the gladder\nto suffer you and your host to come over the passage. All the three\nkings and the whole barons said that Merlin said passingly well, and it\nwas done anon as Merlin had devised. So on the morn, when either host\nsaw other, the host of the north was well comforted. Then to Ulfius and\nBrastias were delivered three thousand men of arms, and they set on them\nfiercely in the passage, and slew on the right hand and on the left hand\nthat it was wonder to tell.\n\nWhen that the eleven kings saw that there was so few a fellowship did\nsuch deeds of arms, they were ashamed and set on them again fiercely;\nand there was Sir Ulfius's horse slain under him, but he did\nmarvellously well on foot. But the Duke Eustace of Cambenet and King\nClariance of Northumberland, were alway grievous on Ulfius. Then\nBrastias saw his fellow fared so withal he smote the duke with a spear,\nthat horse and man fell down. That saw King Clariance and returned\nunto Brastias, and either smote other so that horse and man went to the\nearth, and so they lay long astonied, and their horses' knees brast to\nthe hard bone. Then came Sir Kay the seneschal with six fellows with\nhim, and did passing well. With that came the eleven kings, and there\nwas Griflet put to the earth, horse and man, and Lucas the butler, horse\nand man, by King Brandegoris, and King Idres, and King Agwisance. Then\nwaxed the medley passing hard on both parties. When Sir Kay saw Griflet\non foot, he rode on King Nentres and smote him down, and led his horse\nunto Sir Griflet, and horsed him again. Also Sir Kay with the same spear\nsmote down King Lot, and hurt him passing sore. That saw the King with\nthe Hundred Knights, and ran unto Sir Kay and smote him down, and took\nhis horse, and gave him King Lot, whereof he said gramercy. When Sir\nGriflet saw Sir Kay and Lucas the butler on foot, he took a sharp spear,\ngreat and square, and rode to Pinel, a good man of arms, and smote horse\nand man down, and then he took his horse, and gave him unto Sir Kay.\nThen King Lot saw King Nentres on foot, he ran unto Melot de la Roche,\nand smote him down, horse and man, and gave King Nentres the horse, and\nhorsed him again. Also the King of the Hundred Knights saw King Idres on\nfoot; then he ran unto Gwiniart de Bloi, and smote him down, horse and\nman, and gave King Idres the horse, and horsed him again; and King Lot\nsmote down Clariance de la Forest Savage, and gave the horse unto Duke\nEustace. And so when they had horsed the kings again they drew them, all\neleven kings, together, and said they would be revenged of the damage\nthat they had taken that day. The meanwhile came in Sir Ector with an\neager countenance, and found Ulfius and Brastias on foot, in great peril\nof death, that were foul defoiled under horse-feet.\n\nThen Arthur as a lion, ran unto King Cradelment of North Wales, and\nsmote him through the left side, that the horse and the king fell down;\nand then he took the horse by the rein, and led him unto Ulfius, and\nsaid, Have this horse, mine old friend, for great need hast thou of\nhorse. Gramercy, said Ulfius. Then Sir Arthur did so marvellously in\narms, that all men had wonder. When the King with the Hundred Knights\nsaw King Cradelment on foot, he ran unto Sir Ector, that was well\nhorsed, Sir Kay's father, and smote horse and man down, and gave the\nhorse unto the king, and horsed him again. And when King Arthur saw the\nking ride on Sir Ector's horse, he was wroth and with his sword he smote\nthe king on the helm, that a quarter of the helm and shield fell down,\nand so the sword carved down unto the horse's neck, and so the king and\nthe horse fell down to the ground. Then Sir Kay came unto Sir Morganore,\nseneschal with the King of the Hundred Knights, and smote him down,\nhorse and man, and led the horse unto his father, Sir Ector; then Sir\nEctor ran unto a knight, hight Lardans, and smote horse and man down,\nand led the horse unto Sir Brastias, that great need had of an horse,\nand was greatly defoiled. When Brastias beheld Lucas the butler, that\nlay like a dead man under the horses' feet, and ever Sir Griflet did\nmarvellously for to rescue him, and there were always fourteen knights\non Sir Lucas; then Brastias smote one of them on the helm, that it went\nto the teeth, and he rode to another and smote him, that the arm flew\ninto the field. Then he went to the third and smote him on the shoulder,\nthat shoulder and arm flew in the field. And when Griflet saw rescues,\nhe smote a knight on the temples, that head and helm went to the earth,\nand Griflet took the horse of that knight, and led him unto Sir Lucas,\nand bade him mount upon the horse and revenge his hurts. For Brastias\nhad slain a knight to-fore and horsed Griflet.\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. Yet of the same battle.\n\nTHEN Lucas saw King Agwisance, that late had slain Moris de la Roche,\nand Lucas ran to him with a short spear that was great, that he gave\nhim such a fall, that the horse fell down to the earth. Also Lucas found\nthere on foot, Bloias de La Flandres, and Sir Gwinas, two hardy knights,\nand in that woodness that Lucas was in, he slew two bachelors and horsed\nthem again. Then waxed the battle passing hard on both parties, but\nArthur was glad that his knights were horsed again, and then they fought\ntogether, that the noise and sound rang by the water and the wood.\nWherefore King Ban and King Bors made them ready, and dressed their\nshields and harness, and they were so courageous that many knights shook\nand bevered for eagerness. All this while Lucas, and Gwinas, and Briant,\nand Bellias of Flanders, held strong medley against six kings, that was\nKing Lot, King Nentres, King Brandegoris, King Idres, King Uriens, and\nKing Agwisance. So with the help of Sir Kay and of Sir Griflet they held\nthese six kings hard, that unnethe they had any power to defend them.\nBut when Sir Arthur saw the battle would not be ended by no manner, he\nfared wood as a lion, and steered his horse here and there, on the right\nhand, and on the left hand, that he stinted not till he had slain twenty\nknights. Also he wounded King Lot sore on the shoulder, and made him to\nleave that ground, for Sir Kay and Griflet did with King Arthur\nthere great deeds of arms. Then Ulfius, and Brastias, and Sir Ector\nencountered against the Duke Eustace, and King Cradelment, and King\nClariance of Northumberland, and King Carados, and against the King with\nthe Hundred Knights. So these knights encountered with these kings, that\nthey made them to avoid the ground. Then King Lot made great dole for\nhis damages and his fellows, and said unto the ten kings, But if ye will\ndo as I devise we shall be slain and destroyed; let me have the King\nwith the Hundred Knights, and King Agwisance, and King Idres, and the\nDuke of Cambenet, and we five kings will have fifteen thousand men of\narms with us, and we will go apart while ye six kings hold medley with\ntwelve thousand; an we see that ye have foughten with them long, then\nwill we come on fiercely, and else shall we never match them, said King\nLot, but by this mean. So they departed as they here devised, and six\nkings made their party strong against Arthur, and made great war long.\n\nIn the meanwhile brake the ambushment of King Ban and King Bors, and\nLionses and Phariance had the vanguard, and they two knights met\nwith King Idres and his fellowship, and there began a great medley\nof breaking of spears, and smiting of swords, with slaying of men and\nhorses, and King Idres was near at discomforture.\n\nThat saw Agwisance the king, and put Lionses and Phariance in point of\ndeath; for the Duke of Cambenet came on withal with a great fellowship.\nSo these two knights were in great danger of their lives that they were\nfain to return, but always they rescued themselves and their fellowship\nmarvellously When King Bors saw those knights put aback, it grieved him\nsore; then he came on so fast that his fellowship seemed as black as\nInde. When King Lot had espied King Bors, he knew him well, then he\nsaid, O Jesu, defend us from death and horrible maims! for I see well\nwe be in great peril of death; for I see yonder a king, one of the most\nworshipfullest men and one of the best knights of the world, is inclined\nunto his fellowship. What is he? said the King with the Hundred Knights.\nIt is, said King Lot, King Bors of Gaul; I marvel how they came into\nthis country without witting of us all. It was by Merlin's advice, said\nthe knight. As for him, said King Carados, I will encounter with King\nBors, an ye will rescue me when myster is. Go on, said they all, we will\ndo all that we may. Then King Carados and his host rode on a soft pace,\ntill that they came as nigh King Bors as bow-draught; then either battle\nlet their horse run as fast as they might. And Bleoberis, that was\ngodson unto King Bors, he bare his chief standard, that was a passing\ngood knight. Now shall we see, said King Bors, how these northern\nBritons can bear the arms: and King Bors encountered with a knight, and\nsmote him throughout with a spear that he fell dead unto the earth; and\nafter drew his sword and did marvellous deeds of arms, that all parties\nhad great wonder thereof; and his knights failed not, but did their\npart, and King Carados was smitten to the earth. With that came the King\nwith the Hundred Knights and rescued King Carados mightily by force of\narms, for he was a passing good knight of a king, and but a young man.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. Yet more of the same battle.\n\nBY then came into the field King Ban as fierce as a lion, with bands of\ngreen and thereupon gold. Ha! a! said King Lot, we must be discomfited,\nfor yonder I see the most valiant knight of the world, and the man of\nthe most renown, for such two brethren as is King Ban and King Bors are\nnot living, wherefore we must needs void or die; and but if we avoid\nmanly and wisely there is but death. When King Ban came into the battle,\nhe came in so fiercely that the strokes redounded again from the wood\nand the water; wherefore King Lot wept for pity and dole that he saw so\nmany good knights take their end. But through the great force of King\nBan they made both the northern battles that were departed hurtled\ntogether for great dread; and the three kings and their knights slew on\never, that it was pity on to behold that multitude of the people that\nfled. But King Lot, and King of the Hundred Knights, and King Morganore\ngathered the people together passing knightly, and did great prowess of\narms, and held the battle all that day, like hard.\n\nWhen the King of the Hundred Knights beheld the great damage that King\nBan did, he thrust unto him with his horse, and smote him on high upon\nthe helm, a great stroke, and astonied him sore. Then King Ban was wroth\nwith him, and followed on him fiercely; the other saw that, and cast up\nhis shield, and spurred his horse forward, but the stroke of King Ban\nfell down and carved a cantel off the shield, and the sword slid down by\nthe hauberk behind his back, and cut through the trapping of steel and\nthe horse even in two pieces, that the sword felt the earth. Then the\nKing of the Hundred Knights voided the horse lightly, and with his sword\nhe broached the horse of King Ban through and through. With that King\nBan voided lightly from the dead horse, and then King Ban smote at the\nother so eagerly, and smote him on the helm that he fell to the earth.\nAlso in that ire he felled King Morganore, and there was great slaughter\nof good knights and much people. By then came into the press King\nArthur, and found King Ban standing among dead men and dead horses,\nfighting on foot as a wood lion, that there came none nigh him, as\nfar as he might reach with his sword, but he caught a grievous buffet;\nwhereof King Arthur had great pity. And Arthur was so bloody, that by\nhis shield there might no man know him, for all was blood and brains\non his sword. And as Arthur looked by him he saw a knight that was\npassingly well horsed, and therewith Sir Arthur ran to him, and smote\nhim on the helm, that his sword went unto his teeth, and the knight sank\ndown to the earth dead, and anon Arthur took the horse by the rein, and\nled him unto King Ban, and said, Fair brother, have this horse, for he\nhave great myster thereof, and me repenteth sore of your great damage.\nIt shall be soon revenged, said King Ban, for I trust in God mine ure\nis not such but some of them may sore repent this. I will well, said\nArthur, for I see your deeds full actual; nevertheless, I might not come\nat you at that time.\n\nBut when King Ban was mounted on horseback, then there began new battle,\nthe which was sore and hard, and passing great slaughter. And so through\ngreat force King Arthur, King Ban, and King Bors made their knights a\nlittle to withdraw them. But alway the eleven kings with their chivalry\nnever turned back; and so withdrew them to a little wood, and so over\na little river, and there they rested them, for on the night they might\nhave no rest on the field. And then the eleven kings and knights put\nthem on a heap all together, as men adread and out of all comfort. But\nthere was no man might pass them, they held them so hard together both\nbehind and before, that King Arthur had marvel of their deeds of arms,\nand was passing wroth. Ah, Sir Arthur, said King Ban and King Bors,\nblame them not, for they do as good men ought to do. For by my faith,\nsaid King Ban, they are the best fighting men, and knights of most\nprowess, that ever I saw or heard speak of, and those eleven kings are\nmen of great worship; and if they were longing unto you there were no\nking under the heaven had such eleven knights, and of such worship. I\nmay not love them, said Arthur, they would destroy me. That wot we well,\nsaid King Ban and King Bors, for they are your mortal enemies, and that\nhath been proved aforehand; and this day they have done their part, and\nthat is great pity of their wilfulness.\n\nThen all the eleven kings drew them together, and then said King Lot,\nLords, ye must other ways than ye do, or else the great loss is behind;\nye may see what people we have lost, and what good men we lose, because\nwe wait always on these foot-men, and ever in saving of one of the\nfoot-men we lose ten horsemen for him; therefore this is mine advice,\nlet us put our foot-men from us, for it is near night, for the noble\nArthur will not tarry on the footmen, for they may save themselves, the\nwood is near hand. And when we horsemen be together, look every each of\nyou kings let make such ordinance that none break upon pain of death.\nAnd who that seeth any man dress him to flee, lightly that he be slain,\nfor it is better that we slay a coward, than through a coward all we to\nbe slain. How say ye? said King Lot, answer me all ye kings. It is well\nsaid, quoth King Nentres; so said the King of the Hundred Knights; the\nsame said the King Carados, and King Uriens; so did King Idres and King\nBrandegoris; and so did King Cradelment, and the Duke of Cambenet; the\nsame said King Clariance and King Agwisance, and sware they would never\nfail other, neither for life nor for death. And whoso that fled, but\ndid as they did, should be slain. Then they amended their harness, and\nrighted their shields, and took new spears and set them on their thighs,\nand stood still as it had been a plump of wood.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. Yet more of the same battle, and how it was ended by\nMerlin.\n\nWHEN Sir Arthur and King Ban and Bors beheld them and all their knights,\nthey praised them much for their noble cheer of chivalry, for the\nhardiest fighters that ever they heard or saw. With that, there dressed\nthem a forty noble knights, and said unto the three kings, they would\nbreak their battle; these were their names: Lionses, Phariance, Ulfius,\nBrastias, Ector, Kay, Lucas the butler, Griflet le Fise de Dieu, Mariet\nde la Roche, Guinas de Bloi, Briant de la Forest Savage, Bellaus,\nMorians of the Castle [of] Maidens, Flannedrius of the Castle of Ladies,\nAnnecians that was King Bors' godson, a noble knight, Ladinas de la\nRouse, Emerause, Caulas, Graciens le Castlein, one Blois de la Case, and\nSir Colgrevaunce de Gorre; all these knights rode on afore with spears\non their thighs, and spurred their horses mightily as the horses might\nrun. And the eleven kings with part of their knights rushed with their\nhorses as fast as they might with their spears, and there they did on\nboth parties marvellous deeds of arms. So came into the thick of the\npress, Arthur, Ban, and Bors, and slew down right on both hands, that\ntheir horses went in blood up to the fetlocks. But ever the eleven kings\nand their host was ever in the visage of Arthur. Wherefore Ban and Bors\nhad great marvel, considering the great slaughter that there was, but\nat the last they were driven aback over a little river. With that came\nMerlin on a great black horse, and said unto Arthur, Thou hast never\ndone! Hast thou not done enough? of three score thousand this day hast\nthou left alive but fifteen thousand, and it is time to say Ho! For God\nis wroth with thee, that thou wilt never have done; for yonder eleven\nkings at this time will not be overthrown, but an thou tarry on them\nany longer, thy fortune will turn and they shall increase. And therefore\nwithdraw you unto your lodging, and rest you as soon as ye may, and\nreward your good knights with gold and with silver, for they have well\ndeserved it; there may no riches be too dear for them, for of so few men\nas ye have, there were never men did more of prowess than they have done\ntoday, for ye have matched this day with the best fighters of the world.\nThat is truth, said King Ban and Bors. Also said Merlin, withdraw you\nwhere ye list, for this three year I dare undertake they shall not dere\nyou; and by then ye shall hear new tidings. And then Merlin said unto\nArthur, These eleven kings have more on hand than they are ware of, for\nthe Saracens are landed in their countries, more than forty thousand,\nthat burn and slay, and have laid siege at the castle Wandesborow, and\nmake great destruction; therefore dread you not this three year. Also,\nsir, all the goods that be gotten at this battle, let it be searched,\nand when ye have it in your hands, let it be given freely unto these two\nkings, Ban and Bors, that they may reward their knights withal; and that\nshall cause strangers to be of better will to do you service at\nneed. Also you be able to reward your own knights of your own goods\nwhensomever it liketh you. It is well said, quoth Arthur, and as thou\nhast devised, so shall it be done. When it was delivered to Ban and\nBors, they gave the goods as freely to their knights as freely as it\nwas given to them. Then Merlin took his leave of Arthur and of the\ntwo kings, for to go and see his master Bleise, that dwelt in\nNorthumberland; and so he departed and came to his master, that was\npassing glad of his coming; and there he told how Arthur and the two\nkings had sped at the great battle, and how it was ended, and told the\nnames of every king and knight of worship that was there. And so Bleise\nwrote the battle word by word, as Merlin told him, how it began, and by\nwhom, and in likewise how it was ended, and who had the worse. All the\nbattles that were done in Arthur's days Merlin did his master Bleise do\nwrite; also he did do write all the battles that every worthy knight did\nof Arthur's court.\n\nAfter this Merlin departed from his master and came to King Arthur, that\nwas in the castle of Bedegraine, that was one of the castles that stand\nin the forest of Sherwood. And Merlin was so disguised that King Arthur\nknew him not, for he was all befurred in black sheep-skins, and a great\npair of boots, and a bow and arrows, in a russet gown, and brought wild\ngeese in his hand, and it was on the morn after Candlemas day; but King\nArthur knew him not. Sir, said Merlin unto the king, will ye give me\na gift? Wherefore, said King Arthur, should I give thee a gift, churl?\nSir, said Merlin, ye were better to give me a gift that is not in your\nhand than to lose great riches, for here in the same place where the\ngreat battle was, is great treasure hid in the earth. Who told thee so,\nchurl? said Arthur. Merlin told me so, said he. Then Ulfius and Brastias\nknew him well enough, and smiled. Sir, said these two knights, it is\nMerlin that so speaketh unto you. Then King Arthur was greatly abashed,\nand had marvel of Merlin, and so had King Ban and King Bors, and so they\nhad great disport at him. So in the meanwhile there came a damosel that\nwas an earl's daughter: his name was Sanam, and her name was Lionors, a\npassing fair damosel; and so she came thither for to do homage, as other\nlords did after the great battle. And King Arthur set his love greatly\nupon her, and so did she upon him, and the king had ado with her, and\ngat on her a child: his name was Borre, that was after a good knight,\nand of the Table Round. Then there came word that the King Rience of\nNorth Wales made great war on King Leodegrance of Cameliard, for the\nwhich thing Arthur was wroth, for he loved him well, and hated King\nRience, for he was alway against him. So by ordinance of the three kings\nthat were sent home unto Benwick, all they would depart for dread of\nKing Claudas; and Phariance, and Antemes, and Gratian, and Lionses [of]\nPayarne, with the leaders of those that should keep the kings' lands.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. How King Arthur, King Ban, and King Bors rescued King\nLeodegrance, and other incidents.\n\nAND then King Arthur, and King Ban, and King Bors departed with their\nfellowship, a twenty thousand, and came within six days into the country\nof Cameliard, and there rescued King Leodegrance, and slew there much\npeople of King Rience, unto the number of ten thousand men, and put\nhim to flight. And then had these three kings great cheer of King\nLeodegrance, that thanked them of their great goodness, that they would\nrevenge him of his enemies; and there had Arthur the first sight of\nGuenever, the king's daughter of Cameliard, and ever after he loved her.\nAfter they were wedded, as it telleth in the book. So, briefly to make\nan end, they took their leave to go into their own countries, for King\nClaudas did great destruction on their lands. Then said Arthur, I will\ngo with you. Nay, said the kings, ye shall not at this time, for ye have\nmuch to do yet in these lands, therefore we will depart, and with the\ngreat goods that we have gotten in these lands by your gifts, we shall\nwage good knights and withstand the King Claudas' malice, for by the\ngrace of God, an we have need we will send to you for your succour; and\nif ye have need, send for us, and we will not tarry, by the faith of our\nbodies. It shall not, said Merlin, need that these two kings come again\nin the way of war, but I know well King Arthur may not be long from you,\nfor within a year or two ye shall have great need, and then shall he\nrevenge you on your enemies, as ye have done on his. For these eleven\nkings shall die all in a day, by the great might and prowess of arms\nof two valiant knights (as it telleth after); their names be Balin le\nSavage, and Balan, his brother, that be marvellous good knights as be\nany living.\n\nNow turn we to the eleven kings that returned unto a city that hight\nSorhaute, the which city was within King Uriens', and there they\nrefreshed them as well as they might, and made leeches search their\nwounds, and sorrowed greatly for the death of their people. With that\nthere came a messenger and told how there was come into their lands\npeople that were lawless as well as Saracens, a forty thousand, and have\nburnt and slain all the people that they may come by, without mercy,\nand have laid siege on the castle of Wandesborow. Alas, said the eleven\nkings, here is sorrow upon sorrow, and if we had not warred against\nArthur as we have done, he would soon revenge us. As for King\nLeodegrance, he loveth Arthur better than us, and as for King Rience, he\nhath enough to do with Leodegrance, for he hath laid siege unto him. So\nthey consented together to keep all the marches of Cornwall, of Wales,\nand of the North. So first, they put King Idres in the City of Nauntes\nin Britain, with four thousand men of arms, to watch both the water and\nthe land. Also they put in the city of Windesan, King Nentres of Garlot,\nwith four thousand knights to watch both on water and on land. Also they\nhad of other men of war more than eight thousand, for to fortify all the\nfortresses in the marches of Cornwall. Also they put more knights in all\nthe marches of Wales and Scotland, with many good men of arms, and so\nthey kept them together the space of three year, and ever allied them\nwith mighty kings and dukes and lords. And to them fell King Rience of\nNorth Wales, the which and Nero that was a mighty man of men. And all\nthis while they furnished them and garnished them of good men of arms,\nand victual, and of all manner of habiliment that pretendeth to the war,\nto avenge them for the battle of Bedegraine, as it telleth in the book\nof adventures following.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. How King Arthur rode to Carlion, and of his dream, and how\nhe saw the questing beast.\n\nTHEN after the departing of King Ban and of King Bors, King Arthur rode\ninto Carlion. And thither came to him, King Lot's wife, of Orkney, in\nmanner of a message, but she was sent thither to espy the court of\nKing Arthur; and she came richly beseen, with her four sons, Gawaine,\nGaheris, Agravine, and Gareth, with many other knights and ladies. For\nshe was a passing fair lady, therefore the king cast great love unto\nher, and desired to lie by her; so they were agreed, and he begat upon\nher Mordred, and she was his sister, on his mother's side, Igraine. So\nthere she rested her a month, and at the last departed. Then the king\ndreamed a marvellous dream whereof he was sore adread. But all this time\nKing Arthur knew not that King Lot's wife was his sister. Thus was the\ndream of Arthur: Him thought there was come into this land griffins\nand serpents, and him thought they burnt and slew all the people in the\nland, and then him thought he fought with them, and they did him passing\ngreat harm, and wounded him full sore, but at the last he slew them.\nWhen the king awaked, he was passing heavy of his dream, and so to\nput it out of thoughts, he made him ready with many knights to ride\na-hunting. As soon as he was in the forest the king saw a great hart\nafore him. This hart will I chase, said King Arthur, and so he spurred\nthe horse, and rode after long, and so by fine force oft he was like\nto have smitten the hart; whereas the king had chased the hart so\nlong, that his horse lost his breath, and fell down dead. Then a yeoman\nfetched the king another horse.\n\nSo the king saw the hart enbushed, and his horse dead, he set him down\nby a fountain, and there he fell in great thoughts. And as he sat so,\nhim thought he heard a noise of hounds, to the sum of thirty. And with\nthat the king saw coming toward him the strangest beast that ever he saw\nor heard of; so the beast went to the well and drank, and the noise was\nin the beast's belly like unto the questing of thirty couple hounds; but\nall the while the beast drank there was no noise in the beast's belly:\nand there with the beast departed with a great noise, whereof the king\nhad great marvel. And so he was in a great thought, and therewith he\nfell asleep. Right so there came a knight afoot unto Arthur and said,\nKnight full of thought and sleepy, tell me if thou sawest a strange\nbeast pass this way. Such one saw I, said King Arthur, that is past two\nmile; what would ye with the beast? said Arthur. Sir, I have followed\nthat beast long time, and killed mine horse, so would God I had another\nto follow my quest. Right so came one with the king's horse, and when\nthe knight saw the horse, he prayed the king to give him the horse: for\nI have followed this quest this twelvemonth, and either I shall achieve\nhim, or bleed of the best blood of my body. Pellinore, that time king,\nfollowed the Questing Beast, and after his death Sir Palamides followed\nit.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. How King Pellinore took Arthur's horse and followed the\nQuesting Beast, and how Merlin met with Arthur.\n\nSIR knight, said the king, leave that quest, and suffer me to have it,\nand I will follow it another twelvemonth. Ah, fool, said the knight unto\nArthur, it is in vain thy desire, for it shall never be achieved but\nby me, or my next kin. Therewith he started unto the king's horse and\nmounted into the saddle, and said, Gramercy, this horse is my own. Well,\nsaid the king, thou mayst take my horse by force, but an I might prove\nthee whether thou were better on horseback or I.--Well, said the knight,\nseek me here when thou wilt, and here nigh this well thou shalt find me,\nand so passed on his way. Then the king sat in a study, and bade his men\nfetch his horse as fast as ever they might. Right so came by him Merlin\nlike a child of fourteen year of age, and saluted the king, and asked\nhim why he was so pensive. I may well be pensive, said the king, for I\nhave seen the marvellest sight that ever I saw. That know I well, said\nMerlin, as well as thyself, and of all thy thoughts, but thou art but a\nfool to take thought, for it will not amend thee. Also I know what thou\nart, and who was thy father, and of whom thou wert begotten; King Uther\nPendragon was thy father, and begat thee on Igraine. That is false,\nsaid King Arthur, how shouldest thou know it, for thou art not so old of\nyears to know my father? Yes, said Merlin, I know it better than ye or\nany man living. I will not believe thee, said Arthur, and was wroth with\nthe child. So departed Merlin, and came again in the likeness of an old\nman of fourscore year of age, whereof the king was right glad, for he\nseemed to be right wise.\n\nThen said the old man, Why are ye so sad? I may well be heavy, said\nArthur, for many things. Also here was a child, and told me many things\nthat meseemeth he should not know, for he was not of age to know my\nfather. Yes, said the old man, the child told you truth, and more would\nhe have told you an ye would have suffered him. But ye have done a thing\nlate that God is displeased with you, for ye have lain by your sister,\nand on her ye have gotten a child that shall destroy you and all the\nknights of your realm. What are ye, said Arthur, that tell me these\ntidings? I am Merlin, and I was he in the child's likeness. Ah, said\nKing Arthur, ye are a marvellous man, but I marvel much of thy words\nthat I must die in battle. Marvel not, said Merlin, for it is God's will\nyour body to be punished for your foul deeds; but I may well be sorry,\nsaid Merlin, for I shall die a shameful death, to be put in the earth\nquick, and ye shall die a worshipful death. And as they talked this,\ncame one with the king's horse, and so the king mounted on his horse,\nand Merlin on another, and so rode unto Carlion. And anon the king asked\nEctor and Ulfius how he was begotten, and they told him Uther Pendragon\nwas his father and Queen Igraine his mother. Then he said to Merlin, I\nwill that my mother be sent for that I may speak with her; and if she\nsay so herself then will I believe it. In all haste, the queen was sent\nfor, and she came and brought with her Morgan le Fay, her daughter, that\nwas as fair a lady as any might be, and the king welcomed Igraine in the\nbest manner.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. How Ulfius impeached Queen Igraine, Arthur's mother, of\ntreason; and how a knight came and desired to have the death of his\nmaster revenged.\n\nRIGHT SO came Ulfius, and said openly, that the king and all might hear\nthat were feasted that day, Ye are the falsest lady of the world, and\nthe most traitress unto the king's person. Beware, said Arthur, what\nthou sayest; thou speakest a great word. I am well ware, said Ulfius,\nwhat I speak, and here is my glove to prove it upon any man that will\nsay the contrary, that this Queen Igraine is causer of your great\ndamage, and of your great war. For, an she would have uttered it in\nthe life of King Uther Pendragon, of the birth of you, and how ye were\nbegotten ye had never had the mortal wars that ye have had; for the most\npart of your barons of your realm knew never whose son ye were, nor of\nwhom ye were begotten; and she that bare you of her body should have\nmade it known openly in excusing of her worship and yours, and in like\nwise to all the realm, wherefore I prove her false to God and to you and\nto all your realm, and who will say the contrary I will prove it on his\nbody.\n\nThen spake Igraine and said, I am a woman and I may not fight, but\nrather than I should be dishonoured, there would some good man take my\nquarrel. More, she said, Merlin knoweth well, and ye Sir Ulfius, how\nKing Uther came to me in the Castle of Tintagil in the likeness of my\nlord, that was dead three hours to-fore, and thereby gat a child that\nnight upon me. And after the thirteenth day King Uther wedded me, and by\nhis commandment when the child was born it was delivered unto Merlin and\nnourished by him, and so I saw the child never after, nor wot not what\nis his name, for I knew him never yet. And there, Ulfius said to the\nqueen, Merlin is more to blame than ye. Well I wot, said the queen, I\nbare a child by my lord King Uther, but I wot not where he is become.\nThen Merlin took the king by the hand, saying, This is your mother.\nAnd therewith Sir Ector bare witness how he nourished him by Uther's\ncommandment. And therewith King Arthur took his mother, Queen Igraine,\nin his arms and kissed her, and either wept upon other. And then the\nking let make a feast that lasted eight days.\n\nThen on a day there came in the court a squire on horseback, leading\na knight before him wounded to the death, and told him how there was a\nknight in the forest had reared up a pavilion by a well, and hath slain\nmy master, a good knight, his name was Miles; wherefore I beseech\nyou that my master may be buried, and that some knight may revenge my\nmaster's death. Then the noise was great of that knight's death in the\ncourt, and every man said his advice. Then came Griflet that was but\na squire, and he was but young, of the age of the king Arthur, so he\nbesought the king for all his service that he had done him to give the\norder of knighthood.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. How Griflet was made knight, and jousted with a knight\n\nTHOU art full young and tender of age, said Arthur, for to take so high\nan order on thee. Sir, said Griflet, I beseech you make me knight.\nSir, said Merlin, it were great pity to lose Griflet, for he will be\na passing good man when he is of age, abiding with you the term of his\nlife. And if he adventure his body with yonder knight at the fountain,\nit is in great peril if ever he come again, for he is one of the best\nknights of the world, and the strongest man of arms. Well, said Arthur.\nSo at the desire of Griflet the king made him knight. Now, said Arthur\nunto Sir Griflet, sith I have made you knight thou must give me a gift.\nWhat ye will, said Griflet. Thou shalt promise me by the faith of thy\nbody, when thou hast jousted with the knight at the fountain, whether\nit fall ye be on foot or on horseback, that right so ye shall come\nagain unto me without making any more debate. I will promise you, said\nGriflet, as you desire. Then took Griflet his horse in great haste, and\ndressed his shield and took a spear in his hand, and so he rode a great\nwallop till he came to the fountain, and thereby he saw a rich pavilion,\nand thereby under a cloth stood a fair horse well saddled and bridled,\nand on a tree a shield of divers colours and a great spear. Then Griflet\nsmote on the shield with the butt of his spear, that the shield fell\ndown to the ground. With that the knight came out of the pavilion, and\nsaid, Fair knight, why smote ye down my shield? For I will joust with\nyou, said Griflet. It is better ye do not, said the knight, for ye are\nbut young, and late made knight, and your might is nothing to mine. As\nfor that, said Griflet, I will joust with you. That is me loath, said\nthe knight, but sith I must needs, I will dress me thereto. Of whence be\nye? said the knight. Sir, I am of Arthur's court. So the two knights ran\ntogether that Griflet's spear all to-shivered; and there withal he smote\nGriflet through the shield and the left side, and brake the spear that\nthe truncheon stuck in his body, that horse and knight fell down.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. How twelve knights came from Rome and asked truage for\nthis land of Arthur, and how Arthur fought with a knight.\n\nWHEN the knight saw him lie so on the ground, he alighted, and was\npassing heavy, for he weened he had slain him, and then he unlaced\nhis helm and gat him wind, and so with the truncheon he set him on his\nhorse, and so betook him to God, and said he had a mighty heart, and if\nhe might live he would prove a passing good knight. And so Sir Griflet\nrode to the court, where great dole was made for him. But through good\nleeches he was healed and saved. Right so came into the court twelve\nknights, and were aged men, and they came from the Emperor of Rome, and\nthey asked of Arthur truage for this realm, other else the emperor would\ndestroy him and his land. Well, said King Arthur, ye are messengers,\ntherefore ye may say what ye will, other else ye should die therefore.\nBut this is mine answer: I owe the emperor no truage, nor none will I\nhold him, but on a fair field I shall give him my truage that shall be\nwith a sharp spear, or else with a sharp sword, and that shall not be\nlong, by my father's soul, Uther Pendragon. And therewith the messengers\ndeparted passingly wroth, and King Arthur as wroth, for in evil time\ncame they then; for the king was passingly wroth for the hurt of Sir\nGriflet. And so he commanded a privy man of his chamber that or it be\nday his best horse and armour, with all that longeth unto his person, be\nwithout the city or to-morrow day. Right so or to-morrow day he met with\nhis man and his horse, and so mounted up and dressed his shield and took\nhis spear, and bade his chamberlain tarry there till he came again.\nAnd so Arthur rode a soft pace till it was day, and then was he ware\nof three churls chasing Merlin, and would have slain him. Then the king\nrode unto them, and bade them: Flee, churls! then were they afeard when\nthey saw a knight, and fled. O Merlin, said Arthur, here hadst thou been\nslain for all thy crafts had I not been. Nay, said Merlin, not so, for\nI could save myself an I would; and thou art more near thy death than I\nam, for thou goest to the deathward, an God be not thy friend.\n\nSo as they went thus talking they came to the fountain, and the rich\npavilion there by it. Then King Arthur was ware where sat a knight armed\nin a chair. Sir knight, said Arthur, for what cause abidest thou here,\nthat there may no knight ride this way but if he joust with thee? said\nthe king. I rede thee leave that custom, said Arthur. This custom, said\nthe knight, have I used and will use maugre who saith nay, and who is\ngrieved with my custom let him amend it that will. I will amend it, said\nArthur. I shall defend thee, said the knight. Anon he took his horse\nand dressed his shield and took a spear, and they met so hard either\nin other's shields, that all to-shivered their spears. Therewith anon\nArthur pulled out his sword. Nay, not so, said the knight; it is fairer,\nsaid the knight, that we twain run more together with sharp spears. I\nwill well, said Arthur, an I had any more spears. I have enow, said the\nknight; so there came a squire and brought two good spears, and Arthur\nchose one and he another; so they spurred their horses and came together\nwith all their mights, that either brake their spears to their hands.\nThen Arthur set hand on his sword. Nay, said the knight, ye shall do\nbetter, ye are a passing good jouster as ever I met withal, and once\nfor the love of the high order of knighthood let us joust once again.\nI assent me, said Arthur. Anon there were brought two great spears, and\nevery knight gat a spear, and therewith they ran together that Arthur's\nspear all to-shivered. But the other knight hit him so hard in midst of\nthe shield, that horse and man fell to the earth, and therewith Arthur\nwas eager, and pulled out his sword, and said, I will assay thee, sir\nknight, on foot, for I have lost the honour on horseback. I will be\non horseback, said the knight. Then was Arthur wroth, and dressed his\nshield toward him with his sword drawn. When the knight saw that, he\nalighted, for him thought no worship to have a knight at such avail, he\nto be on horseback and he on foot, and so he alighted and dressed his\nshield unto Arthur. And there began a strong battle with many great\nstrokes, and so hewed with their swords that the cantels flew in the\nfields, and much blood they bled both, that all the place there as they\nfought was overbled with blood, and thus they fought long and rested\nthem, and then they went to the battle again, and so hurtled together\nlike two rams that either fell to the earth. So at the last they smote\ntogether that both their swords met even together. But the sword of the\nknight smote King Arthur's sword in two pieces, wherefore he was heavy.\nThen said the knight unto Arthur, Thou art in my daunger whether me\nlist to save thee or slay thee, and but thou yield thee as overcome and\nrecreant, thou shalt die. As for death, said King Arthur, welcome be it\nwhen it cometh, but to yield me unto thee as recreant I had liefer die\nthan to be so shamed. And therewithal the king leapt unto Pellinore, and\ntook him by the middle and threw him down, and raced off his helm. When\nthe knight felt that he was adread, for he was a passing big man of\nmight, and anon he brought Arthur under him, and raced off his helm and\nwould have smitten off his head.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. How Merlin saved Arthur's life, and threw an enchantment\non King Pellinore and made him to sleep.\n\nTHEREWITHAL came Merlin and said, Knight, hold thy hand, for an thou\nslay that knight thou puttest this realm in the greatest damage that\never was realm: for this knight is a man of more worship than thou\nwotest of. Why, who is he? said the knight. It is King Arthur. Then\nwould he have slain him for dread of his wrath, and heaved up his sword,\nand therewith Merlin cast an enchantment to the knight, that he fell to\nthe earth in a great sleep. Then Merlin took up King Arthur, and rode\nforth on the knight's horse. Alas! said Arthur, what hast thou done,\nMerlin? hast thou slain this good knight by thy crafts? There liveth not\nso worshipful a knight as he was; I had liefer than the stint of my land\na year that he were alive. Care ye not, said Merlin, for he is wholer\nthan ye; for he is but asleep, and will awake within three hours. I told\nyou, said Merlin, what a knight he was; here had ye been slain had I not\nbeen. Also there liveth not a bigger knight than he is one, and he shall\nhereafter do you right good service; and his name is Pellinore, and he\nshall have two sons that shall be passing good men; save one they shall\nhave no fellow of prowess and of good living, and their names shall be\nPercivale of Wales and Lamerake of Wales, and he shall tell you the name\nof your own son, begotten of your sister, that shall be the destruction\nof all this realm.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. How Arthur by the mean of Merlin gat Excalibur his sword of\nthe Lady of the Lake.\n\nRIGHT SO the king and he departed, and went unto an hermit that was a\ngood man and a great leech. So the hermit searched all his wounds and\ngave him good salves; so the king was there three days, and then were\nhis wounds well amended that he might ride and go, and so departed.\nAnd as they rode, Arthur said, I have no sword. No force, said Merlin,\nhereby is a sword that shall be yours, an I may. So they rode till they\ncame to a lake, the which was a fair water and broad, and in the midst\nof the lake Arthur was ware of an arm clothed in white samite, that held\na fair sword in that hand. Lo! said Merlin, yonder is that sword that I\nspake of. With that they saw a damosel going upon the lake. What damosel\nis that? said Arthur. That is the Lady of the Lake, said Merlin; and\nwithin that lake is a rock, and therein is as fair a place as any on\nearth, and richly beseen; and this damosel will come to you anon, and\nthen speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword. Anon\nwithal came the damosel unto Arthur, and saluted him, and he her again.\nDamosel, said Arthur, what sword is that, that yonder the arm holdeth\nabove the water? I would it were mine, for I have no sword. Sir Arthur,\nking, said the damosel, that sword is mine, and if ye will give me a\ngift when I ask it you, ye shall have it. By my faith, said Arthur, I\nwill give you what gift ye will ask. Well! said the damosel, go ye\ninto yonder barge, and row yourself to the sword, and take it and the\nscabbard with you, and I will ask my gift when I see my time. So Sir\nArthur and Merlin alighted and tied their horses to two trees, and so\nthey went into the ship, and when they came to the sword that the hand\nheld, Sir Arthur took it up by the handles, and took it with him, and\nthe arm and the hand went under the water. And so [they] came unto\nthe land and rode forth, and then Sir Arthur saw a rich pavilion. What\nsignifieth yonder pavilion? It is the knight's pavilion, said Merlin,\nthat ye fought with last, Sir Pellinore; but he is out, he is not there.\nHe hath ado with a knight of yours that hight Egglame, and they have\nfoughten together, but at the last Egglame fled, and else he had been\ndead, and he hath chased him even to Carlion, and we shall meet with him\nanon in the highway. That is well said, said Arthur, now have I a sword,\nnow will I wage battle with him, and be avenged on him. Sir, you shall\nnot so, said Merlin, for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing, so\nthat ye shall have no worship to have ado with him; also he will not be\nlightly matched of one knight living, and therefore it is my counsel,\nlet him pass, for he shall do you good service in short time, and his\nsons after his days. Also ye shall see that day in short space, you\nshall be right glad to give him your sister to wed. When I see him, I\nwill do as ye advise, said Arthur.\n\nThen Sir Arthur looked on the sword, and liked it passing well. Whether\nliketh you better, said Merlin, the sword or the scabbard? Me liketh\nbetter the sword, said Arthur. Ye are more unwise, said Merlin, for the\nscabbard is worth ten of the swords, for whiles ye have the scabbard\nupon you, ye shall never lose no blood, be ye never so sore wounded;\ntherefore keep well the scabbard always with you. So they rode unto\nCarlion, and by the way they met with Sir Pellinore; but Merlin had done\nsuch a craft, that Pellinore saw not Arthur, and he passed by without\nany words. I marvel, said Arthur, that the knight would not speak. Sir,\nsaid Merlin, he saw you not, for an he had seen you, ye had not lightly\ndeparted. So they came unto Carlion, whereof his knights were passing\nglad. And when they heard of his adventures, they marvelled that he\nwould jeopard his person so, alone. But all men of worship said it\nwas merry to be under such a chieftain, that would put his person in\nadventure as other poor knights did.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. How tidings came to Arthur that King Rience had overcome\neleven kings, and how he desired Arthur's beard to trim his mantle.\n\nTHIS meanwhile came a messenger from King Rience of North Wales, and\nking he was of all Ireland, and of many isles. And this was his message,\ngreeting well King Arthur in this manner wise, saying that King Rience\nhad discomfited and overcome eleven kings, and everych of them did him\nhomage, and that was this, they gave him their beards clean flayed off,\nas much as there was; wherefore the messenger came for King Arthur's\nbeard. For King Rience had purfled a mantle with kings' beards, and\nthere lacked one place of the mantle; wherefore he sent for his beard,\nor else he would enter into his lands, and burn and slay, and never\nleave till he have the head and the beard. Well, said Arthur, thou hast\nsaid thy message, the which is the most villainous and lewdest message\nthat ever man heard sent unto a king; also thou mayest see my beard is\nfull young yet to make a purfle of it. But tell thou thy king this: I\nowe him none homage, nor none of mine elders; but or it be long to, he\nshall do me homage on both his knees, or else he shall lose his head, by\nthe faith of my body, for this is the most shamefulest message that ever\nI heard speak of. I have espied thy king met never yet with worshipful\nman, but tell him, I will have his head without he do me homage. Then\nthe messenger departed.\n\nNow is there any here, said Arthur, that knoweth King Rience? Then\nanswered a knight that hight Naram, Sir, I know the king well; he is a\npassing good man of his body, as few be living, and a passing proud man,\nand Sir, doubt ye not he will make war on you with a mighty puissance.\nWell, said Arthur, I shall ordain for him in short time.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. How all the children were sent for that were born on\nMay-day, and how Mordred was saved.\n\nTHEN King Arthur let send for all the children born on May-day, begotten\nof lords and born of ladies; for Merlin told King Arthur that he that\nshould destroy him should be born on May-day, wherefore he sent for them\nall, upon pain of death; and so there were found many lords' sons, and\nall were sent unto the king, and so was Mordred sent by King Lot's wife,\nand all were put in a ship to the sea, and some were four weeks old, and\nsome less. And so by fortune the ship drave unto a castle, and was all\nto-riven, and destroyed the most part, save that Mordred was cast up,\nand a good man found him, and nourished him till he was fourteen year\nold, and then he brought him to the court, as it rehearseth afterward,\ntoward the end of the Death of Arthur. So many lords and barons of this\nrealm were displeased, for their children were so lost, and many put the\nwite on Merlin more than on Arthur; so what for dread and for love, they\nheld their peace. But when the messenger came to King Rience, then\nwas he wood out of measure, and purveyed him for a great host, as it\nrehearseth after in the book of Balin le Savage, that followeth next\nafter, how by adventure Balin gat the sword.\n\nExplicit liber primus. Incipit liber secundus\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Of a damosel which came girt with a sword for to find a man\nof such virtue to draw it out of the scabbard.\n\nAFTER the death of Uther Pendragon reigned Arthur his son, the which had\ngreat war in his days for to get all England into his hand. For there\nwere many kings within the realm of England, and in Wales, Scotland, and\nCornwall. So it befell on a time when King Arthur was at London, there\ncame a knight and told the king tidings how that the King Rience of\nNorth Wales had reared a great number of people, and were entered into\nthe land, and burnt and slew the king's true liege people. If this be\ntrue, said Arthur, it were great shame unto mine estate but that he were\nmightily withstood. It is truth, said the knight, for I saw the host\nmyself. Well, said the king, let make a cry, that all the lords,\nknights, and gentlemen of arms, should draw unto a castle called Camelot\nin those days, and there the king would let make a council-general and a\ngreat jousts.\n\nSo when the king was come thither with all his baronage, and lodged as\nthey seemed best, there was come a damosel the which was sent on message\nfrom the great lady Lile of Avelion. And when she came before King\nArthur, she told from whom she came, and how she was sent on message\nunto him for these causes. Then she let her mantle fall that was richly\nfurred; and then was she girt with a noble sword whereof the king had\nmarvel, and said, Damosel, for what cause are ye girt with that sword?\nit beseemeth you not. Now shall I tell you, said the damosel; this sword\nthat I am girt withal doth me great sorrow and cumbrance, for I may not\nbe delivered of this sword but by a knight, but he must be a passing\ngood man of his hands and of his deeds, and without villainy or\ntreachery, and without treason. And if I may find such a knight that\nhath all these virtues, he may draw out this sword out of the sheath,\nfor I have been at King Rience's it was told me there were passing good\nknights, and he and all his knights have assayed it and none can speed.\nThis is a great marvel, said Arthur, if this be sooth; I will myself\nassay to draw out the sword, not presuming upon myself that I am the\nbest knight, but that I will begin to draw at your sword in giving\nexample to all the barons that they shall assay everych one after other\nwhen I have assayed it. Then Arthur took the sword by the sheath and by\nthe girdle and pulled at it eagerly, but the sword would not out.\n\nSir, said the damosel, you need not to pull half so hard, for he that\nshall pull it out shall do it with little might. Ye say well, said\nArthur; now assay ye all my barons; but beware ye be not defiled with\nshame, treachery, nor guile. Then it will not avail, said the damosel,\nfor he must be a clean knight without villainy, and of a gentle strain\nof father side and mother side. Most of all the barons of the Round\nTable that were there at that time assayed all by row, but there might\nnone speed; wherefore the damosel made great sorrow out of measure, and\nsaid, Alas! I weened in this court had been the best knights without\ntreachery or treason. By my faith, said Arthur, here are good knights,\nas I deem, as any be in the world, but their grace is not to help you,\nwherefore I am displeased.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How Balin, arrayed like a poor knight, pulled out the sword,\nwhich afterward was the cause of his death.\n\nTHEN fell it so that time there was a poor knight with King Arthur, that\nhad been prisoner with him half a year and more for slaying of a knight,\nthe which was cousin unto King Arthur. The name of this knight was\ncalled Balin, and by good means of the barons he was delivered out of\nprison, for he was a good man named of his body, and he was born in\nNorthumberland. And so he went privily into the court, and saw this\nadventure, whereof it raised his heart, and he would assay it as other\nknights did, but for he was poor and poorly arrayed he put him not far\nin press. But in his heart he was fully assured to do as well, if his\ngrace happed him, as any knight that there was. And as the damosel took\nher leave of Arthur and of all the barons, so departing, this knight\nBalin called unto her, and said, Damosel, I pray you of your courtesy,\nsuffer me as well to assay as these lords; though that I be so poorly\nclothed, in my heart meseemeth I am fully assured as some of these\nothers, and meseemeth in my heart to speed right well. The damosel\nbeheld the poor knight, and saw he was a likely man, but for his poor\narrayment she thought he should be of no worship without villainy or\ntreachery. And then she said unto the knight, Sir, it needeth not to\nput me to more pain or labour, for it seemeth not you to speed there as\nother have failed. Ah! fair damosel, said Balin, worthiness, and good\ntatches, and good deeds, are not only in arrayment, but manhood and\nworship is hid within man's person, and many a worshipful knight is not\nknown unto all people, and therefore worship and hardiness is not in\narrayment. By God, said the damosel, ye say sooth; therefore ye shall\nassay to do what ye may. Then Balin took the sword by the girdle and\nsheath, and drew it out easily; and when he looked on the sword it\npleased him much. Then had the king and all the barons great marvel that\nBalin had done that adventure, and many knights had great despite of\nBalin. Certes, said the damosel, this is a passing good knight, and the\nbest that ever I found, and most of worship without treason, treachery,\nor villainy, and many marvels shall he do. Now, gentle and courteous\nknight, give me the sword again. Nay, said Balin, for this sword will I\nkeep, but it be taken from me with force. Well, said the damosel, ye are\nnot wise to keep the sword from me, for ye shall slay with the sword the\nbest friend that ye have, and the man that ye most love in the world,\nand the sword shall be your destruction. I shall take the adventure,\nsaid Balin, that God will ordain me, but the sword ye shall not have\nat this time, by the faith of my body. Ye shall repent it within short\ntime, said the damosel, for I would have the sword more for your avail\nthan for mine, for I am passing heavy for your sake; for ye will not\nbelieve that sword shall be your destruction, and that is great pity.\nWith that the damosel departed, making great sorrow.\n\nAnon after, Balin sent for his horse and armour, and so would depart\nfrom the court, and took his leave of King Arthur. Nay, said the king, I\nsuppose ye will not depart so lightly from this fellowship, I suppose ye\nare displeased that I have shewed you unkindness; blame me the less,\nfor I was misinformed against you, but I weened ye had not been such a\nknight as ye are, of worship and prowess, and if ye will abide in\nthis court among my fellowship, I shall so advance you as ye shall be\npleased. God thank your highness, said Balin, your bounty and highness\nmay no man praise half to the value; but at this time I must needs\ndepart, beseeching you alway of your good grace. Truly, said the king,\nI am right wroth for your departing; I pray you, fair knight, that ye\ntarry not long, and ye shall be right welcome to me, and to my barons,\nand I shall amend all miss that I have done against you; God thank your\ngreat lordship, said Balin, and therewith made him ready to depart. Then\nthe most part of the knights of the Round Table said that Balin did not\nthis adventure all only by might, but by witchcraft.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How the Lady of the Lake demanded the knight's head that\nhad won the sword, or the maiden's head.\n\nTHE meanwhile, that this knight was making him ready to depart, there\ncame into the court a lady that hight the Lady of the Lake. And she came\non horseback, richly beseen, and saluted King Arthur, and there asked\nhim a gift that he promised her when she gave him the sword. That is\nsooth, said Arthur, a gift I promised you, but I have forgotten the\nname of my sword that ye gave me. The name of it, said the lady, is\nExcalibur, that is as much to say as Cut-steel. Ye say well, said the\nking; ask what ye will and ye shall have it, an it lie in my power to\ngive it. Well, said the lady, I ask the head of the knight that hath won\nthe sword, or else the damosel's head that brought it; I take no force\nthough I have both their heads, for he slew my brother, a good knight\nand a true, and that gentlewoman was causer of my father's death.\nTruly, said King Arthur, I may not grant neither of their heads with\nmy worship, therefore ask what ye will else, and I shall fulfil your\ndesire. I will ask none other thing, said the lady. When Balin was ready\nto depart, he saw the Lady of the Lake, that by her means had slain\nBalin's mother, and he had sought her three years; and when it was told\nhim that she asked his head of King Arthur, he went to her straight and\nsaid, Evil be you found; ye would have my head, and therefore ye shall\nlose yours, and with his sword lightly he smote off her head before\nKing Arthur. Alas, for shame! said Arthur, why have ye done so? ye have\nshamed me and all my court, for this was a lady that I was beholden to,\nand hither she came under my safe-conduct; I shall never forgive you\nthat trespass. Sir, said Balin, me forthinketh of your displeasure,\nfor this same lady was the untruest lady living, and by enchantment and\nsorcery she hath been the destroyer of many good knights, and she was\ncauser that my mother was burnt, through her falsehood and treachery.\nWhat cause soever ye had, said Arthur, ye should have forborne her in\nmy presence; therefore, think not the contrary, ye shall repent it, for\nsuch another despite had I never in my court; therefore withdraw you out\nof my court in all haste ye may.\n\nThen Balin took up the head of the lady, and bare it with him to his\nhostelry, and there he met with his squire, that was sorry he had\ndispleased King Arthur and so they rode forth out of the town. Now, said\nBalin, we must depart, take thou this head and bear it to my friends,\nand tell them how I have sped, and tell my friends in Northumberland\nthat my most foe is dead. Also tell them how I am out of prison, and\nwhat adventure befell me at the getting of this sword. Alas! said the\nsquire, ye are greatly to blame for to displease King Arthur. As for\nthat, said Balin, I will hie me, in all the haste that I may, to meet\nwith King Rience and destroy him, either else to die therefore; and if\nit may hap me to win him, then will King Arthur be my good and gracious\nlord. Where shall I meet with you? said the squire. In King Arthur's\ncourt, said Balin. So his squire and he departed at that time. Then King\nArthur and all the court made great dole and had shame of the death of\nthe Lady of the Lake. Then the king buried her richly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How Merlin told the adventure of this damosel.\n\nAT that time there was a knight, the which was the king's son of\nIreland, and his name was Lanceor, the which was an orgulous knight, and\ncounted himself one of the best of the court; and he had great despite\nat Balin for the achieving of the sword, that any should be accounted\nmore hardy, or more of prowess; and he asked King Arthur if he would\ngive him leave to ride after Balin and to revenge the despite that he\nhad done. Do your best, said Arthur, I am right wroth with Balin; I\nwould he were quit of the despite that he hath done to me and to my\ncourt. Then this Lanceor went to his hostelry to make him ready. In the\nmeanwhile came Merlin unto the court of King Arthur, and there was told\nhim the adventure of the sword, and the death of the Lady of the Lake.\nNow shall I say you, said Merlin; this same damosel that here standeth,\nthat brought the sword unto your court, I shall tell you the cause of\nher coming: she was the falsest damosel that liveth. Say not so, said\nthey. She hath a brother, a passing good knight of prowess and a\nfull true man; and this damosel loved another knight that held her to\nparamour, and this good knight her brother met with the knight that held\nher to paramour, and slew him by force of his hands. When this false\ndamosel understood this, she went to the Lady Lile of Avelion, and\nbesought her of help, to be avenged on her own brother.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How Balin was pursued by Sir Lanceor, knight of Ireland, and\nhow he jousted and slew him.\n\nAND so this Lady Lile of Avelion took her this sword that she brought\nwith her, and told there should no man pull it out of the sheath but if\nhe be one of the best knights of this realm, and he should be hard and\nfull of prowess, and with that sword he should slay her brother. This\nwas the cause that the damosel came into this court. I know it as well\nas ye. Would God she had not come into this court, but she came never in\nfellowship of worship to do good, but always great harm; and that knight\nthat hath achieved the sword shall be destroyed by that sword, for\nthe which will be great damage, for there liveth not a knight of more\nprowess than he is, and he shall do unto you, my Lord Arthur, great\nhonour and kindness; and it is great pity he shall not endure but a\nwhile, for of his strength and hardiness I know not his match living.\n\nSo the knight of Ireland armed him at all points, and dressed his shield\non his shoulder, and mounted upon horseback, and took his spear in his\nhand, and rode after a great pace, as much as his horse might go; and\nwithin a little space on a mountain he had a sight of Balin, and with a\nloud voice he cried, Abide, knight, for ye shall abide whether ye will\nor nill, and the shield that is to-fore you shall not help. When Balin\nheard the noise, he turned his horse fiercely, and said, Fair knight,\nwhat will ye with me, will ye joust with me? Yea, said the Irish knight,\ntherefore come I after you. Peradventure, said Balin, it had been better\nto have holden you at home, for many a man weeneth to put his enemy to\na rebuke, and oft it falleth to himself. Of what court be ye sent from?\nsaid Balin. I am come from the court of King Arthur, said the knight of\nIreland, that come hither for to revenge the despite ye did this day to\nKing Arthur and to his court. Well, said Balin, I see well I must have\nado with you, that me forthinketh for to grieve King Arthur, or any of\nhis court; and your quarrel is full simple, said Balin, unto me, for the\nlady that is dead, did me great damage, and else would I have been loath\nas any knight that liveth for to slay a lady. Make you ready, said the\nknight Lanceor, and dress you unto me, for that one shall abide in the\nfield. Then they took their spears, and came together as much as their\nhorses might drive, and the Irish knight smote Balin on the shield, that\nall went shivers off his spear, and Balin hit him through the shield,\nand the hauberk perished, and so pierced through his body and the\nhorse's croup, and anon turned his horse fiercely, and drew out his\nsword, and wist not that he had slain him; and then he saw him lie as a\ndead corpse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How a damosel, which was love to Lanceor, slew herself for\nlove, and how Balin met with his brother Balan.\n\nTHEN he looked by him, and was ware of a damosel that came riding full\nfast as the horse might ride, on a fair palfrey. And when she espied\nthat Lanceor was slain, she made sorrow out of measure, and said, O\nBalin, two bodies thou hast slain and one heart, and two hearts in one\nbody, and two souls thou hast lost. And therewith she took the sword\nfrom her love that lay dead, and fell to the ground in a swoon. And when\nshe arose she made great dole out of measure, the which sorrow grieved\nBalin passingly sore, and he went unto her for to have taken the sword\nout of her hand, but she held it so fast he might not take it out of her\nhand unless he should have hurt her, and suddenly she set the pommel\nto the ground, and rove herself through the body. When Balin espied her\ndeeds, he was passing heavy in his heart, and ashamed that so fair a\ndamosel had destroyed herself for the love of his death. Alas, said\nBalin, me repenteth sore the death of this knight, for the love of this\ndamosel, for there was much true love betwixt them both, and for sorrow\nmight not longer behold him, but turned his horse and looked toward a\ngreat forest, and there he was ware, by the arms, of his brother Balan.\nAnd when they were met they put off their helms and kissed together, and\nwept for joy and pity. Then Balan said, I little weened to have met with\nyou at this sudden adventure; I am right glad of your deliverance out\nof your dolorous prisonment, for a man told me, in the castle of Four\nStones, that ye were delivered, and that man had seen you in the court\nof King Arthur, and therefore I came hither into this country, for here\nI supposed to find you. Anon the knight Balin told his brother of his\nadventure of the sword, and of the death of the Lady of the Lake, and\nhow King Arthur was displeased with him. Wherefore he sent this knight\nafter me, that lieth here dead, and the death of this damosel grieveth\nme sore. So doth it me, said Balan, but ye must take the adventure that\nGod will ordain you. Truly, said Balin, I am right heavy that my Lord\nArthur is displeased with me, for he is the most worshipful knight that\nreigneth now on earth, and his love will I get or else will I put my\nlife in adventure. For the King Rience lieth at a siege at the Castle\nTerrabil, and thither will we draw in all haste, to prove our worship\nand prowess upon him. I will well, said Balan, that we do, and we will\nhelp each other as brethren ought to do.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. How a dwarf reproved Balin for the death of Lanceor, and\nhow King Mark of Cornwall found them, and made a tomb over them.\n\nNow go we hence, said Balin, and well be we met. The meanwhile as they\ntalked, there came a dwarf from the city of Camelot on horseback, as\nmuch as he might; and found the dead bodies, wherefore he made great\ndole, and pulled out his hair for sorrow, and said, Which of you knights\nhave done this deed? Whereby askest thou it? said Balan. For I would wit\nit, said the dwarf. It was I, said Balin, that slew this knight in my\ndefence, for hither he came to chase me, and either I must slay him or\nhe me; and this damosel slew herself for his love, which repenteth me,\nand for her sake I shall owe all women the better love. Alas, said the\ndwarf, thou hast done great damage unto thyself, for this knight that is\nhere dead was one of the most valiantest men that lived, and trust well,\nBalin, the kin of this knight will chase you through the world till they\nhave slain you. As for that, said Balin, I fear not greatly, but I am\nright heavy that I have displeased my lord King Arthur, for the death of\nthis knight. So as they talked together, there came a king of Cornwall\nriding, the which hight King Mark. And when he saw these two bodies\ndead, and understood how they were dead, by the two knights above said,\nthen made the king great sorrow for the true love that was betwixt them,\nand said, I will not depart till I have on this earth made a tomb, and\nthere he pight his pavilions and sought through all the country to find\na tomb, and in a church they found one was fair and rich, and then the\nking let put them both in the earth, and put the tomb upon them, and\nwrote the names of them both on the tomb. How here lieth Lanceor the\nking's son of Ireland, that at his own request was slain by the hands\nof Balin; and how his lady, Colombe, and paramour, slew herself with her\nlove's sword for dole and sorrow.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How Merlin prophesied that two the best knights of the\nworld should fight there, which were Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristram.\n\nTHE meanwhile as this was a-doing, in came Merlin to King Mark, and\nseeing all his doing, said, Here shall be in this same place the\ngreatest battle betwixt two knights that was or ever shall be, and the\ntruest lovers, and yet none of them shall slay other. And there Merlin\nwrote their names upon the tomb with letters of gold that should fight\nin that place, whose names were Launcelot de Lake, and Tristram. Thou\nart a marvellous man, said King Mark unto Merlin, that speakest of such\nmarvels, thou art a boistous man and an unlikely to tell of such deeds.\nWhat is thy name? said King Mark. At this time, said Merlin, I will not\ntell, but at that time when Sir Tristram is taken with his sovereign\nlady, then ye shall hear and know my name, and at that time ye shall\nhear tidings that shall not please you. Then said Merlin to Balin, Thou\nhast done thyself great hurt, because that thou savest not this lady\nthat slew herself, that might have saved her an thou wouldest. By the\nfaith of my body, said Balin, I might not save her, for she slew herself\nsuddenly. Me repenteth, said Merlin; because of the death of that lady\nthou shalt strike a stroke most dolorous that ever man struck, except\nthe stroke of our Lord, for thou shalt hurt the truest knight and the\nman of most worship that now liveth, and through that stroke three\nkingdoms shall be in great poverty, misery and wretchedness twelve\nyears, and the knight shall not be whole of that wound for many years.\nThen Merlin took his leave of Balin. And Balin said, If I wist it were\nsooth that ye say I should do such a perilous deed as that, I would slay\nmyself to make thee a liar. Therewith Merlin vanished away suddenly. And\nthen Balan and his brother took their leave of King Mark. First, said\nthe king, tell me your name. Sir, said Balan, ye may see he beareth two\nswords, thereby ye may call him the Knight with the Two Swords. And so\ndeparted King Mark unto Camelot to King Arthur, and Balin took the\nway toward King Rience; and as they rode together they met with Merlin\ndisguised, but they knew him not. Whither ride you? said Merlin. We have\nlittle to do, said the two knights, to tell thee. But what is thy name?\nsaid Balin. At this time, said Merlin, I will not tell it thee. It is\nevil seen, said the knights, that thou art a true man that thou wilt not\ntell thy name. As for that, said Merlin, be it as it be may, I can tell\nyou wherefore ye ride this way, for to meet King Rience; but it will not\navail you without ye have my counsel. Ah! said Balin, ye are Merlin; we\nwill be ruled by your counsel. Come on, said Merlin, ye shall have great\nworship, and look that ye do knightly, for ye shall have great need. As\nfor that, said Balin, dread you not, we will do what we may.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How Balin and his brother, by the counsel of Merlin, took\nKing Rience and brought him to King Arthur.\n\nTHEN Merlin lodged them in a wood among leaves beside the highway, and\ntook off the bridles of their horses and put them to grass and laid them\ndown to rest them till it was nigh midnight. Then Merlin bade them rise,\nand make them ready, for the king was nigh them, that was stolen away\nfrom his host with a three score horses of his best knights, and twenty\nof them rode to-fore to warn the Lady de Vance that the king was coming;\nfor that night King Rience should have lain with her. Which is the king?\nsaid Balin. Abide, said Merlin, here in a strait way ye shall meet with\nhim; and therewith he showed Balin and his brother where he rode.\n\nAnon Balin and his brother met with the king, and smote him down, and\nwounded him fiercely, and laid him to the ground; and there they slew on\nthe right hand and the left hand, and slew more than forty of his men,\nand the remnant fled. Then went they again to King Rience and would have\nslain him had he not yielded him unto their grace. Then said he thus:\nKnights full of prowess, slay me not, for by my life ye may win, and by\nmy death ye shall win nothing. Then said these two knights, Ye say\nsooth and truth, and so laid him on a horse-litter. With that Merlin was\nvanished, and came to King Arthur aforehand, and told him how his most\nenemy was taken and discomfited. By whom? said King Arthur. By two\nknights, said Merlin, that would please your lordship, and to-morrow ye\nshall know what knights they are. Anon after came the Knight with the\nTwo Swords and Balan his brother, and brought with them King Rience of\nNorth Wales, and there delivered him to the porters, and charged them\nwith him; and so they two returned again in the dawning of the day. King\nArthur came then to King Rience, and said, Sir king, ye are welcome: by\nwhat adventure come ye hither? Sir, said King Rience, I came hither by\nan hard adventure. Who won you? said King Arthur. Sir, said the king,\nthe Knight with the Two Swords and his brother, which are two marvellous\nknights of prowess. I know them not, said Arthur, but much I am beholden\nto them. Ah, said Merlin, I shall tell you: it is Balin that achieved\nthe sword, and his brother Balan, a good knight, there liveth not a\nbetter of prowess and of worthiness, and it shall be the greatest dole\nof him that ever I knew of knight, for he shall not long endure. Alas,\nsaid King Arthur, that is great pity; for I am much beholden unto him,\nand I have ill deserved it unto him for his kindness. Nay, said Merlin,\nhe shall do much more for you, and that shall ye know in haste. But,\nsir, are ye purveyed, said Merlin, for to-morn the host of Nero,\nKing Rience's brother, will set on you or noon with a great host, and\ntherefore make you ready, for I will depart from you.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How King Arthur had a battle against Nero and King Lot of\nOrkney, and how King Lot was deceived by Merlin, and how twelve kings\nwere slain.\n\nTHEN King Arthur made ready his host in ten battles and Nero was ready\nin the field afore the Castle Terrabil with a great host, and he had\nten battles, with many more people than Arthur had. Then Nero had the\nvanguard with the most part of his people, and Merlin came to King Lot\nof the Isle of Orkney, and held him with a tale of prophecy, till Nero\nand his people were destroyed. And there Sir Kay the seneschal did\npassingly well, that the days of his life the worship went never from\nhim; and Sir Hervis de Revel did marvellous deeds with King Arthur, and\nKing Arthur slew that day twenty knights and maimed forty. At that time\ncame in the Knight with the Two Swords and his brother Balan, but they\ntwo did so marvellously that the king and all the knights marvelled of\nthem, and all they that beheld them said they were sent from heaven as\nangels, or devils from hell; and King Arthur said himself they were the\nbest knights that ever he saw, for they gave such strokes that all men\nhad wonder of them.\n\nIn the meanwhile came one to King Lot, and told him while he tarried\nthere Nero was destroyed and slain with all his people. Alas, said King\nLot, I am ashamed, for by my default there is many a worshipful man\nslain, for an we had been together there had been none host under the\nheaven that had been able for to have matched with us; this faiter with\nhis prophecy hath mocked me. All that did Merlin, for he knew well\nthat an King Lot had been with his body there at the first battle, King\nArthur had been slain, and all his people destroyed; and well Merlin\nknew that one of the kings should be dead that day, and loath was Merlin\nthat any of them both should be slain; but of the twain, he had liefer\nKing Lot had been slain than King Arthur. Now what is best to do? said\nKing Lot of Orkney; whether is me better to treat with King Arthur or to\nfight, for the greater part of our people are slain and destroyed? Sir,\nsaid a knight, set on Arthur for they are weary and forfoughten and we\nbe fresh. As for me, said King Lot, I would every knight would do\nhis part as I would do mine. And then they advanced banners and smote\ntogether and all to-shivered their spears; and Arthur's knights, with\nthe help of the Knight with the Two Swords and his brother Balan put\nKing Lot and his host to the worse. But always King Lot held him in the\nforemost front, and did marvellous deeds of arms, for all his host\nwas borne up by his hands, for he abode all knights. Alas he might not\nendure, the which was great pity, that so worthy a knight as he was one\nshould be overmatched, that of late time afore had been a knight of King\nArthur's, and wedded the sister of King Arthur; and for King Arthur\nlay by King Lot's wife, the which was Arthur's sister, and gat on her\nMordred, therefore King Lot held against Arthur. So there was a knight\nthat was called the Knight with the Strange Beast, and at that time his\nright name was called Pellinore, the which was a good man of prowess,\nand he smote a mighty stroke at King Lot as he fought with all his\nenemies, and he failed of his stroke, and smote the horse's neck, that\nhe fell to the ground with King Lot. And therewith anon Pellinore smote\nhim a great stroke through the helm and head unto the brows. And then\nall the host of Orkney fled for the death of King Lot, and there were\nslain many mothers' sons. But King Pellinore bare the wite of the death\nof King Lot, wherefore Sir Gawaine revenged the death of his father the\ntenth year after he was made knight, and slew King Pellinore with his\nown hands. Also there were slain at that battle twelve kings on the\nside of King Lot with Nero, and all were buried in the Church of Saint\nStephen's in Camelot, and the remnant of knights and of others were\nburied in a great rock.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. Of the interment of twelve kings, and of the prophecy of\nMerlin, and how Balin should give the dolorous stroke.\n\nSO at the interment came King Lot's wife Margawse with her four sons,\nGawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris, and Gareth. Also there came thither King\nUriens, Sir Ewaine's father, and Morgan le Fay his wife that was King\nArthur's sister. All these came to the interment. But of all these\ntwelve kings King Arthur let make the tomb of King Lot passing richly,\nand made his tomb by his own; and then Arthur let make twelve images\nof latten and copper, and over-gilt it with gold, in the sign of twelve\nkings, and each one of them held a taper of wax that burnt day and\nnight; and King Arthur was made in sign of a figure standing above\nthem with a sword drawn in his hand, and all the twelve figures had\ncountenance like unto men that were overcome. All this made Merlin\nby his subtle craft, and there he told the king, When I am dead these\ntapers shall burn no longer, and soon after the adventures of the\nSangreal shall come among you and be achieved. Also he told Arthur how\nBalin the worshipful knight shall give the dolorous stroke, whereof\nshall fall great vengeance. Oh, where is Balin and Balan and Pellinore?\nsaid King Arthur. As for Pellinore, said Merlin, he will meet with\nyou soon; and as for Balin he will not be long from you; but the other\nbrother will depart, ye shall see him no more. By my faith, said Arthur,\nthey are two marvellous knights, and namely Balin passeth of prowess of\nany knight that ever I found, for much beholden am I unto him; would God\nhe would abide with me. Sir, said Merlin, look ye keep well the scabbard\nof Excalibur, for ye shall lose no blood while ye have the scabbard upon\nyou, though ye have as many wounds upon you as ye may have. So after,\nfor great trust, Arthur betook the scabbard to Morgan le Fay his sister,\nand she loved another knight better than her husband King Uriens or King\nArthur, and she would have had Arthur her brother slain, and therefore\nshe let make another scabbard like it by enchantment, and gave the\nscabbard Excalibur to her love; and the knight's name was called\nAccolon, that after had near slain King Arthur. After this Merlin told\nunto King Arthur of the prophecy that there should be a great battle\nbeside Salisbury, and Mordred his own son should be against him. Also he\ntold him that Bagdemegus was his cousin, and germain unto King Uriens.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How a sorrowful knight came before Arthur, and how Balin\nfetched him, and how that knight was slain by a knight invisible.\n\nWITHIN a day or two King Arthur was somewhat sick, and he let pitch his\npavilion in a meadow, and there he laid him down on a pallet to sleep,\nbut he might have no rest. Right so he heard a great noise of an horse,\nand therewith the king looked out at the porch of the pavilion, and saw\na knight coming even by him, making great dole. Abide, fair sir, said\nArthur, and tell me wherefore thou makest this sorrow. Ye may little\namend me, said the knight, and so passed forth to the castle of Meliot.\nAnon after there came Balin, and when he saw King Arthur he alighted off\nhis horse, and came to the King on foot, and saluted him. By my head,\nsaid Arthur, ye be welcome. Sir, right now came riding this way a knight\nmaking great mourn, for what cause I cannot tell; wherefore I would\ndesire of you of your courtesy and of your gentleness to fetch again\nthat knight either by force or else by his good will. I will do more for\nyour lordship than that, said Balin; and so he rode more than a pace,\nand found the knight with a damosel in a forest, and said, Sir knight,\nye must come with me unto King Arthur, for to tell him of your sorrow.\nThat will I not, said the knight, for it will scathe me greatly, and do\nyou none avail. Sir, said Balin, I pray you make you ready, for ye must\ngo with me, or else I must fight with you and bring you by force, and\nthat were me loath to do. Will ye be my warrant, said the knight, an I\ngo with you? Yea, said Balin, or else I will die therefore. And so he\nmade him ready to go with Balin, and left the damosel still. And as they\nwere even afore King Arthur's pavilion, there came one invisible, and\nsmote this knight that went with Balin throughout the body with a spear.\nAlas, said the knight, I am slain under your conduct with a knight\ncalled Garlon; therefore take my horse that is better than yours, and\nride to the damosel, and follow the quest that I was in as she will lead\nyou, and revenge my death when ye may. That shall I do, said Balin, and\nthat I make vow unto knighthood; and so he departed from this knight\nwith great sorrow. So King Arthur let bury this knight richly, and made\na mention on his tomb, how there was slain Herlews le Berbeus, and by\nwhom the treachery was done, the knight Garlon. But ever the damosel\nbare the truncheon of the spear with her that Sir Herlews was slain\nwithal.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. How Balin and the damosel met with a knight which was in\nlikewise slain, and how the damosel bled for the custom of a castle.\n\nSo Balin and the damosel rode into a forest, and there met with a knight\nthat had been a-hunting, and that knight asked Balin for what cause he\nmade so great sorrow. Me list not to tell you, said Balin. Now, said\nthe knight, an I were armed as ye be I would fight with you. That should\nlittle need, said Balin, I am not afeard to tell you, and told him all\nthe cause how it was. Ah, said the knight, is this all? here I ensure\nyou by the faith of my body never to depart from you while my life\nlasteth. And so they went to the hostelry and armed them, and so rode\nforth with Balin. And as they came by an hermitage even by a churchyard,\nthere came the knight Garlon invisible, and smote this knight, Perin de\nMountbeliard, through the body with a spear. Alas, said the knight, I am\nslain by this traitor knight that rideth invisible. Alas, said Balin, it\nis not the first despite he hath done me; and there the hermit and Balin\nburied the knight under a rich stone and a tomb royal. And on the morn\nthey found letters of gold written, how Sir Gawaine shall revenge his\nfather's death, King Lot, on the King Pellinore. Anon after this\nBalin and the damosel rode till they came to a castle, and there Balin\nalighted, and he and the damosel went to go into the castle, and anon\nas Balin came within the castle's gate the portcullis fell down at his\nback, and there fell many men about the damosel, and would have slain\nher. When Balin saw that, he was sore aggrieved, for he might not help\nthe damosel. Then he went up into the tower, and leapt over walls into\nthe ditch, and hurt him not; and anon he pulled out his sword and would\nhave foughten with them. And they all said nay, they would not fight\nwith him, for they did nothing but the old custom of the castle; and\ntold him how their lady was sick, and had lain many years, and she might\nnot be whole but if she had a dish of silver full of blood of a clean\nmaid and a king's daughter; and therefore the custom of this castle is,\nthere shall no damosel pass this way but she shall bleed of her blood in\na silver dish full. Well, said Balin, she shall bleed as much as she may\nbleed, but I will not lose the life of her whiles my life lasteth. And\nso Balin made her to bleed by her good will, but her blood helped not\nthe lady. And so he and she rested there all night, and had there right\ngood cheer, and on the morn they passed on their ways. And as it telleth\nafter in the Sangreal, that Sir Percivale's sister helped that lady with\nher blood, whereof she was dead.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How Balin met with that knight named Garlon at a feast, and\nthere he slew him, to have his blood to heal therewith the son of his\nhost.\n\nTHEN they rode three or four days and never met with adventure, and by\nhap they were lodged with a gentle man that was a rich man and well\nat ease. And as they sat at their supper Balin overheard one complain\ngrievously by him in a chair. What is this noise? said Balin. Forsooth,\nsaid his host, I will tell you. I was but late at a jousting, and there\nI jousted with a knight that is brother unto King Pellam, and twice\nsmote I him down, and then he promised to quit me on my best friend; and\nso he wounded my son, that cannot be whole till I have of that knight's\nblood, and he rideth alway invisible; but I know not his name. Ah! said\nBalin, I know that knight, his name is Garlon, he hath slain two knights\nof mine in the same manner, therefore I had liefer meet with that knight\nthan all the gold in this realm, for the despite he hath done me. Well,\nsaid his host, I shall tell you, King Pellam of Listeneise hath made do\ncry in all this country a great feast that shall be within these twenty\ndays, and no knight may come there but if he bring his wife with him,\nor his paramour; and that knight, your enemy and mine, ye shall see that\nday. Then I behote you, said Balin, part of his blood to heal your son\nwithal. We will be forward to-morn, said his host. So on the morn they\nrode all three toward Pellam, and they had fifteen days' journey or\nthey came thither; and that same day began the great feast. And so they\nalighted and stabled their horses, and went into the castle; but Balin's\nhost might not be let in because he had no lady. Then Balin was well\nreceived and brought unto a chamber and unarmed him; and there were\nbrought him robes to his pleasure, and would have had Balin leave his\nsword behind him. Nay, said Balin, that do I not, for it is the custom\nof my country a knight always to keep his weapon with him, and that\ncustom will I keep, or else I will depart as I came. Then they gave him\nleave to wear his sword, and so he went unto the castle, and was set\namong knights of worship, and his lady afore him.\n\nSoon Balin asked a knight, Is there not a knight in this court whose\nname is Garlon? Yonder he goeth, said a knight, he with the black face;\nhe is the marvellest knight that is now living, for he destroyeth many\ngood knights, for he goeth invisible. Ah well, said Balin, is that he?\nThen Balin advised him long: If I slay him here I shall not escape, and\nif I leave him now, peradventure I shall never meet with him again\nat such a steven, and much harm he will do an he live. Therewith this\nGarlon espied that this Balin beheld him, and then he came and smote\nBalin on the face with the back of his hand, and said, Knight, why\nbeholdest me so? for shame therefore, eat thy meat and do that thou came\nfor. Thou sayest sooth, said Balin, this is not the first despite that\nthou hast done me, and therefore I will do what I came for, and rose\nup fiercely and clave his head to the shoulders. Give me the truncheon,\nsaid Balin to his lady, wherewith he slew your knight. Anon she gave\nit him, for alway she bare the truncheon with her. And therewith Balin\nsmote him through the body, and said openly, With that truncheon thou\nhast slain a good knight, and now it sticketh in thy body. And then\nBalin called unto him his host, saying, Now may ye fetch blood enough to\nheal your son withal.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. How Balin fought with King Pellam, and how his sword brake,\nand how he gat a spear wherewith he smote the dolorous stroke.\n\nANON all the knights arose from the table for to set on Balin, and King\nPellam himself arose up fiercely, and said, Knight, hast thou slain my\nbrother? thou shalt die therefore or thou depart. Well, said Balin, do\nit yourself. Yes, said King Pellam, there shall no man have ado with\nthee but myself, for the love of my brother. Then King Pellam caught\nin his hand a grim weapon and smote eagerly at Balin; but Balin put the\nsword betwixt his head and the stroke, and therewith his sword burst in\nsunder. And when Balin was weaponless he ran into a chamber for to seek\nsome weapon, and so from chamber to chamber, and no weapon he could\nfind, and always King Pellam after him. And at the last he entered into\na chamber that was marvellously well dight and richly, and a bed arrayed\nwith cloth of gold, the richest that might be thought, and one lying\ntherein, and thereby stood a table of clean gold with four pillars of\nsilver that bare up the table, and upon the table stood a marvellous\nspear strangely wrought. And when Balin saw that spear, he gat it in his\nhand and turned him to King Pellam, and smote him passingly sore with\nthat spear, that King Pellam fell down in a swoon, and therewith the\ncastle roof and walls brake and fell to the earth, and Balin fell down\nso that he might not stir foot nor hand. And so the most part of the\ncastle, that was fallen down through that dolorous stroke, lay upon\nPellam and Balin three days.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. How Balin was delivered by Merlin, and saved a knight that\nwould have slain himself for love.\n\nTHEN Merlin came thither and took up Balin, and gat him a good horse,\nfor his was dead, and bade him ride out of that country. I would have\nmy damosel, said Balin. Lo, said Merlin, where she lieth dead. And King\nPellam lay so, many years sore wounded, and might never be whole till\nGalahad the haut prince healed him in the quest of the Sangreal, for in\nthat place was part of the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, that Joseph\nof Arimathea brought into this land, and there himself lay in that rich\nbed. And that was the same spear that Longius smote our Lord to the\nheart; and King Pellam was nigh of Joseph's kin, and that was the most\nworshipful man that lived in those days, and great pity it was of his\nhurt, for through that stroke, turned to great dole, tray and tene. Then\ndeparted Balin from Merlin, and said, In this world we meet never no\nmore. So he rode forth through the fair countries and cities, and found\nthe people dead, slain on every side. And all that were alive cried,\nO Balin, thou hast caused great damage in these countries; for the\ndolorous stroke thou gavest unto King Pellam three countries are\ndestroyed, and doubt not but the vengeance will fall on thee at the\nlast. When Balin was past those countries he was passing fain.\n\nSo he rode eight days or he met with adventure. And at the last he\ncame into a fair forest in a valley, and was ware of a tower, and there\nbeside he saw a great horse of war, tied to a tree, and there beside sat\na fair knight on the ground and made great mourning, and he was a likely\nman, and a well made. Balin said, God save you, why be ye so heavy?\ntell me and I will amend it, an I may, to my power. Sir knight, said he\nagain, thou dost me great grief, for I was in merry thoughts, and now\nthou puttest me to more pain. Balin went a little from him, and looked\non his horse; then heard Balin him say thus: Ah, fair lady, why have ye\nbroken my promise, for thou promisest me to meet me here by noon, and\nI may curse thee that ever ye gave me this sword, for with this sword I\nslay myself, and pulled it out. And therewith Balin stert unto him and\ntook him by the hand. Let go my hand, said the knight, or else I shall\nslay thee. That shall not need, said Balin, for I shall promise you my\nhelp to get you your lady, an ye will tell me where she is. What is your\nname? said the knight. My name is Balin le Savage. Ah, sir, I know you\nwell enough, ye are the Knight with the Two Swords, and the man of most\nprowess of your hands living. What is your name? said Balin. My name is\nGarnish of the Mount, a poor man's son, but by my prowess and hardiness\na duke hath made me knight, and gave me lands; his name is Duke Hermel,\nand his daughter is she that I love, and she me as I deemed. How far is\nshe hence? said Balin. But six mile, said the knight. Now ride we hence,\nsaid these two knights. So they rode more than a pace, till that they\ncame to a fair castle well walled and ditched. I will into the castle,\nsaid Balin, and look if she be there. So he went in and searched from\nchamber to chamber, and found her bed, but she was not there. Then Balin\nlooked into a fair little garden, and under a laurel tree he saw her\nlie upon a quilt of green samite and a knight in her arms, fast halsing\neither other, and under their heads grass and herbs. When Balin saw her\nlie so with the foulest knight that ever he saw, and she a fair lady,\nthen Balin went through all the chambers again, and told the knight\nhow he found her as she had slept fast, and so brought him in the place\nthere she lay fast sleeping.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. How that knight slew his love and a knight lying by her,\nand after, how he slew himself with his own sword, and how Balin rode\ntoward a castle where he lost his life.\n\nAND when Garnish beheld her so lying, for pure sorrow his mouth and nose\nburst out a-bleeding, and with his sword he smote off both their heads,\nand then he made sorrow out of measure, and said, O Balin, much sorrow\nhast thou brought unto me, for hadst thou not shewed me that sight I\nshould have passed my sorrow. Forsooth, said Balin, I did it to this\nintent that it should better thy courage, and that ye might see and\nknow her falsehood, and to cause you to leave love of such a lady;\nGod knoweth I did none other but as I would ye did to me. Alas, said\nGarnish, now is my sorrow double that I may not endure, now have I slain\nthat I most loved in all my life; and therewith suddenly he rove himself\non his own sword unto the hilts. When Balin saw that, he dressed him\nthenceward, lest folk would say he had slain them; and so he rode forth,\nand within three days he came by a cross, and thereon were letters of\ngold written, that said, It is not for no knight alone to ride toward\nthis castle. Then saw he an old hoar gentleman coming toward him,\nthat said, Balin le Savage, thou passest thy bounds to come this way,\ntherefore turn again and it will avail thee. And he vanished away anon;\nand so he heard an horn blow as it had been the death of a beast. That\nblast, said Balin, is blown for me, for I am the prize and yet am I\nnot dead. Anon withal he saw an hundred ladies and many knights, that\nwelcomed him with fair semblant, and made him passing good cheer unto\nhis sight, and led him into the castle, and there was dancing and\nminstrelsy and all manner of joy. Then the chief lady of the castle\nsaid, Knight with the Two Swords, ye must have ado and joust with a\nknight hereby that keepeth an island, for there may no man pass this\nway but he must joust or he pass. That is an unhappy custom, said Balin,\nthat a knight may not pass this way but if he joust. Ye shall not have\nado but with one knight, said the lady.\n\nWell, said Balin, since I shall thereto I am ready, but travelling men\nare oft weary and their horses too, but though my horse be weary my\nheart is not weary, I would be fain there my death should be. Sir, said\na knight to Balin, methinketh your shield is not good, I will lend you\na bigger. Thereof I pray you. And so he took the shield that was unknown\nand left his own, and so rode unto the island, and put him and his\nhorse in a great boat; and when he came on the other side he met with a\ndamosel, and she said, O knight Balin, why have ye left your own shield?\nalas ye have put yourself in great danger, for by your shield ye should\nhave been known; it is great pity of you as ever was of knight, for of\nthy prowess and hardiness thou hast no fellow living. Me repenteth,\nsaid Balin, that ever I came within this country, but I may not turn\nnow again for shame, and what adventure shall fall to me, be it life\nor death, I will take the adventure that shall come to me. And then he\nlooked on his armour, and understood he was well armed, and therewith\nblessed him and mounted upon his horse.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. How Balin met with his brother Balan, and how each of\nthem slew other unknown, till they were wounded to death.\n\nTHEN afore him he saw come riding out of a castle a knight, and his\nhorse trapped all red, and himself in the same colour. When this knight\nin the red beheld Balin, him thought it should be his brother Balin by\ncause of his two swords, but by cause he knew not his shield he deemed\nit was not he. And so they aventryd their spears and came marvellously\nfast together, and they smote each other in the shields, but their\nspears and their course were so big that it bare down horse and man,\nthat they lay both in a swoon. But Balin was bruised sore with the fall\nof his horse, for he was weary of travel. And Balan was the first that\nrose on foot and drew his sword, and went toward Balin, and he arose and\nwent against him; but Balan smote Balin first, and he put up his shield\nand smote him through the shield and tamed his helm. Then Balin smote\nhim again with that unhappy sword, and well-nigh had felled his brother\nBalan, and so they fought there together till their breaths failed. Then\nBalin looked up to the castle and saw the towers stand full of ladies.\nSo they went unto battle again, and wounded everych other dolefully, and\nthen they breathed ofttimes, and so went unto battle that all the place\nthere as they fought was blood red. And at that time there was none of\nthem both but they had either smitten other seven great wounds, so that\nthe least of them might have been the death of the mightiest giant in\nthis world.\n\nThen they went to battle again so marvellously that doubt it was to hear\nof that battle for the great blood-shedding, and their hauberks unnailed\nthat naked they were on every side. At last Balan the younger brother\nwithdrew him a little and laid him down. Then said Balin le Savage, What\nknight art thou? for or now I found never no knight that matched me. My\nname is, said he, Balan, brother unto the good knight, Balin. Alas, said\nBalin, that ever I should see this day, and therewith he fell backward\nin a swoon. Then Balan yede on all four feet and hands, and put off the\nhelm off his brother, and might not know him by the visage it was so ful\nhewn and bled; but when he awoke he said, O Balan, my brother, thou\nhast slain me and I thee, wherefore all the wide world shall speak of us\nboth. Alas, said Balan, that ever I saw this day, that through mishap I\nmight not know you, for I espied well your two swords, but by cause\nye had another shield I deemed ye had been another knight. Alas, said\nBalin, all that made an unhappy knight in the castle, for he caused me\nto leave my own shield to our both's destruction, and if I might live\nI would destroy that castle for ill customs. That were well done, said\nBalan, for I had never grace to depart from them since that I came\nhither, for here it happed me to slay a knight that kept this island,\nand since might I never depart, and no more should ye, brother, an ye\nmight have slain me as ye have, and escaped yourself with the life.\n\nRight so came the lady of the tower with four knights and six ladies\nand six yeomen unto them, and there she heard how they made their moan\neither to other, and said, We came both out of one tomb, that is to say\none mother's belly, and so shall we lie both in one pit. So Balan prayed\nthe lady of her gentleness, for his true service, that she would bury\nthem both in that same place there the battle was done. And she granted\nthem, with weeping, it should be done richly in the best manner. Now,\nwill ye send for a priest, that we may receive our sacrament, and\nreceive the blessed body of our Lord Jesus Christ? Yea, said the lady,\nit shall be done; and so she sent for a priest and gave them their\nrights. Now, said Balin, when we are buried in one tomb, and the mention\nmade over us how two brethren slew each other, there will never good\nknight, nor good man, see our tomb but they will pray for our souls. And\nso all the ladies and gentlewomen wept for pity. Then anon Balan died,\nbut Balin died not till the midnight after, and so were they buried\nboth, and the lady let make a mention of Balan how he was there slain by\nhis brother's hands, but she knew not Balin's name.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. How Merlin buried them both in one tomb, and of Balin's\nsword.\n\nIN the morn came Merlin and let write Balin's name on the tomb with\nletters of gold, that Here lieth Balin le Savage that was the Knight\nwith the Two Swords, and he that smote the Dolorous Stroke. Also Merlin\nlet make there a bed, that there should never man lie therein but he\nwent out of his wit, yet Launcelot de Lake fordid that bed through his\nnoblesse. And anon after Balin was dead, Merlin took his sword, and took\noff the pommel and set on another pommel. So Merlin bade a knight that\nstood afore him handle that sword, and he assayed, and he might not\nhandle it. Then Merlin laughed. Why laugh ye? said the knight. This is\nthe cause, said Merlin: there shall never man handle this sword but\nthe best knight of the world, and that shall be Sir Launcelot or else\nGalahad his son, and Launcelot with this sword shall slay the man that\nin the world he loved best, that shall be Sir Gawaine. All this he let\nwrite in the pommel of the sword. Then Merlin let make a bridge of iron\nand of steel into that island, and it was but half a foot broad, and\nthere shall never man pass that bridge, nor have hardiness to go over,\nbut if he were a passing good man and a good knight without treachery or\nvillainy. Also the scabbard of Balin's sword Merlin left it on this side\nthe island, that Galahad should find it. Also Merlin let make by his\nsubtilty that Balin's sword was put in a marble stone standing upright\nas great as a mill stone, and the stone hoved always above the water and\ndid many years, and so by adventure it swam down the stream to the City\nof Camelot, that is in English Winchester. And that same day Galahad the\nhaut prince came with King Arthur, and so Galahad brought with him\nthe scabbard and achieved the sword that was there in the marble stone\nhoving upon the water. And on Whitsunday he achieved the sword as it is\nrehearsed in the book of Sangreal.\n\nSoon after this was done Merlin came to King Arthur and told him of the\ndolorous stroke that Balin gave to King Pellam, and how Balin and Balan\nfought together the marvellest battle that ever was heard of, and how\nthey were buried both in one tomb. Alas, said King Arthur, this is the\ngreatest pity that ever I heard tell of two knights, for in the world I\nknow not such two knights. Thus endeth the tale of Balin and of Balan,\ntwo brethren born in Northumberland, good knights.\n\nSequitur iii liber.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How King Arthur took a wife, and wedded Guenever, daughter to\nLeodegrance, King of the Land of Cameliard, with whom he had the Round\nTable.\n\nIN the beginning of Arthur, after he was chosen king by adventure and\nby grace; for the most part of the barons knew not that he was Uther\nPendragon's son, but as Merlin made it openly known. But yet many kings\nand lords held great war against him for that cause, but well Arthur\novercame them all, for the most part the days of his life he was ruled\nmuch by the counsel of Merlin. So it fell on a time King Arthur said\nunto Merlin, My barons will let me have no rest, but needs I must take a\nwife, and I will none take but by thy counsel and by thine advice. It\nis well done, said Merlin, that ye take a wife, for a man of your bounty\nand noblesse should not be without a wife. Now is there any that ye love\nmore than another? Yea, said King Arthur, I love Guenever the king's\ndaughter, Leodegrance of the land of Cameliard, the which holdeth in his\nhouse the Table Round that ye told he had of my father Uther. And this\ndamosel is the most valiant and fairest lady that I know living, or yet\nthat ever I could find. Sir, said Merlin, as of her beauty and fairness\nshe is one of the fairest alive, but, an ye loved her not so well as ye\ndo, I should find you a damosel of beauty and of goodness that should\nlike you and please you, an your heart were not set; but there as a\nman's heart is set, he will be loath to return. That is truth, said\nKing Arthur. But Merlin warned the king covertly that Guenever was not\nwholesome for him to take to wife, for he warned him that Launcelot\nshould love her, and she him again; and so he turned his tale to the\nadventures of Sangreal.\n\nThen Merlin desired of the king for to have men with him that should\nenquire of Guenever, and so the king granted him, and Merlin went forth\nunto King Leodegrance of Cameliard, and told him of the desires of the\nking that he would have unto his wife Guenever his daughter. That is to\nme, said King Leodegrance, the best tidings that ever I heard, that so\nworthy a king of prowess and noblesse will wed my daughter. And as for\nmy lands, I will give him, wist I it might please him, but he hath lands\nenow, him needeth none; but I shall send him a gift shall please\nhim much more, for I shall give him the Table Round, the which Uther\nPendragon gave me, and when it is full complete, there is an hundred\nknights and fifty. And as for an hundred good knights I have myself,\nbut I faute fifty, for so many have been slain in my days. And so\nLeodegrance delivered his daughter Guenever unto Merlin, and the Table\nRound with the hundred knights, and so they rode freshly, with great\nroyalty, what by water and what by land, till that they came nigh unto\nLondon.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How the Knights of the Round Table were ordained and their\nsieges blessed by the Bishop of Canterbury.\n\nWHEN King Arthur heard of the coming of Guenever and the hundred knights\nwith the Table Round, then King Arthur made great joy for her coming,\nand that rich present, and said openly, This fair lady is passing\nwelcome unto me, for I have loved her long, and therefore there is\nnothing so lief to me. And these knights with the Round Table please me\nmore than right great riches. And in all haste the king let ordain for\nthe marriage and the coronation in the most honourable wise that could\nbe devised. Now, Merlin, said King Arthur, go thou and espy me in all\nthis land fifty knights which be of most prowess and worship. Within\nshort time Merlin had found such knights that should fulfil twenty and\neight knights, but no more he could find. Then the Bishop of Canterbury\nwas fetched, and he blessed the sieges with great royalty and devotion,\nand there set the eight and twenty knights in their sieges. And when\nthis was done Merlin said, Fair sirs, ye must all arise and come to King\nArthur for to do him homage; he will have the better will to maintain\nyou. And so they arose and did their homage, and when they were gone\nMerlin found in every sieges letters of gold that told the knights'\nnames that had sitten therein. But two sieges were void. And so anon\ncame young Gawaine and asked the king a gift. Ask, said the king, and I\nshall grant it you. Sir, I ask that ye will make me knight that same\nday ye shall wed fair Guenever. I will do it with a good will, said King\nArthur, and do unto you all the worship that I may, for I must by reason\nye are my nephew, my sister's son.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How a poor man riding upon a lean mare desired King Arthur\nto make his son knight.\n\nFORTHWITHAL there came a poor man into the court, and brought with him a\nfair young man of eighteen years of age riding upon a lean mare; and\nthe poor man asked all men that he met, Where shall I find King Arthur?\nYonder he is, said the knights, wilt thou anything with him? Yea, said\nthe poor man, therefore I came hither. Anon as he came before the king,\nhe saluted him and said: O King Arthur, the flower of all knights and\nkings, I beseech Jesu save thee. Sir, it was told me that at this time\nof your marriage ye would give any man the gift that he would ask, out\nexcept that were unreasonable. That is truth, said the king, such cries\nI let make, and that will I hold, so it apair not my realm nor mine\nestate. Ye say well and graciously, said the poor man; Sir, I ask\nnothing else but that ye will make my son here a knight. It is a great\nthing thou askest of me, said the king. What is thy name? said the king\nto the poor man. Sir, my name is Aries the cowherd. Whether cometh this\nof thee or of thy son? said the king. Nay, sir, said Aries, this desire\ncometh of my son and not of me, for I shall tell you I have thirteen\nsons, and all they will fall to what labour I put them, and will be\nright glad to do labour, but this child will not labour for me, for\nanything that my wife or I may do, but always he will be shooting or\ncasting darts, and glad for to see battles and to behold knights, and\nalways day and night he desireth of me to be made a knight. What is thy\nname? said the king unto the young man. Sir, my name is Tor. The king\nbeheld him fast, and saw he was passingly well-visaged and passingly\nwell made of his years. Well, said King Arthur unto Aries the cowherd,\nfetch all thy sons afore me that I may see them. And so the poor man\ndid, and all were shaped much like the poor man. But Tor was not like\nnone of them all in shape nor in countenance, for he was much more than\nany of them. Now, said King Arthur unto the cow herd, where is the sword\nhe shall be made knight withal? It is here, said Tor. Take it out of the\nsheath, said the king, and require me to make you a knight.\n\nThen Tor alighted off his mare and pulled out his sword, kneeling, and\nrequiring the king that he would make him knight, and that he might be\na knight of the Table Round. As for a knight I will make you, and\ntherewith smote him in the neck with the sword, saying, Be ye a good\nknight, and so I pray to God so ye may be, and if ye be of prowess and\nof worthiness ye shall be a knight of the Table Round. Now Merlin, said\nArthur, say whether this Tor shall be a good knight or no. Yea, sir,\nhe ought to be a good knight, for he is come of as good a man as any\nis alive, and of kings' blood. How so, sir? said the king. I shall tell\nyou, said Merlin: This poor man, Aries the cowherd, is not his father;\nhe is nothing sib to him, for King Pellinore is his father. I suppose\nnay, said the cowherd. Fetch thy wife afore me, said Merlin, and\nshe shall not say nay. Anon the wife was fetched, which was a fair\nhousewife, and there she answered Merlin full womanly, and there she\ntold the king and Merlin that when she was a maid, and went to milk\nkine, there met with her a stern knight, and half by force he had my\nmaidenhead, and at that time he begat my son Tor, and he took away from\nme my greyhound that I had that time with me, and said that he would\nkeep the greyhound for my love. Ah, said the cowherd, I weened not this,\nbut I may believe it well, for he had never no tatches of me. Sir, said\nTor unto Merlin, dishonour not my mother. Sir, said Merlin, it is more\nfor your worship than hurt, for your father is a good man and a king,\nand he may right well advance you and your mother, for ye were begotten\nor ever she was wedded. That is truth, said the wife. It is the less\ngrief unto me, said the cowherd.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How Sir Tor was known for son of King Pellinore, and how\nGawaine was made knight.\n\nSO on the morn King Pellinore came to the court of King Arthur, which\nhad great joy of him, and told him of Tor, how he was his son, and how\nhe had made him knight at the request of the cowherd. When Pellinore\nbeheld Tor, he pleased him much. So the king made Gawaine knight, but\nTor was the first he made at the feast. What is the cause, said King\nArthur, that there be two places void in the sieges? Sir, said Merlin,\nthere shall no man sit in those places but they that shall be of most\nworship. But in the Siege Perilous there shall no man sit therein but\none, and if there be any so hardy to do it he shall be destroyed, and\nhe that shall sit there shall have no fellow. And therewith Merlin took\nKing Pellinore by the hand, and in the one hand next the two sieges and\nthe Siege Perilous he said, in open audience, This is your place and\nbest ye are worthy to sit therein of any that is here. Thereat sat Sir\nGawaine in great envy and told Gaheris his brother, yonder knight is\nput to great worship, the which grieveth me sore, for he slew our father\nKing Lot, therefore I will slay him, said Gawaine, with a sword that\nwas sent me that is passing trenchant. Ye shall not so, said Gaheris, at\nthis time, for at this time I am but a squire, and when I am made knight\nI will be avenged on him, and therefore, brother, it is best ye suffer\ntill another time, that we may have him out of the court, for an we did\nso we should trouble this high feast. I will well, said Gawaine, as ye\nwill.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How at feast of the wedding of King Arthur to Guenever,\na white hart came into the hall, and thirty couple hounds, and how a\nbrachet pinched the hart which was taken away.\n\nTHEN was the high feast made ready, and the king was wedded at Camelot\nunto Dame Guenever in the church of Saint Stephen's, with great\nsolemnity. And as every man was set after his degree, Merlin went to all\nthe knights of the Round Table, and bade them sit still, that none of\nthem remove. For ye shall see a strange and a marvellous adventure.\nRight so as they sat there came running in a white hart into the hall,\nand a white brachet next him, and thirty couple of black running hounds\ncame after with a great cry, and the hart went about the Table Round as\nhe went by other boards. The white brachet bit him by the buttock\nand pulled out a piece, wherethrough the hart leapt a great leap and\noverthrew a knight that sat at the board side; and therewith the knight\narose and took up the brachet, and so went forth out of the hall, and\ntook his horse and rode his way with the brachet. Right so anon came in\na lady on a white palfrey, and cried aloud to King Arthur, Sir, suffer\nme not to have this despite, for the brachet was mine that the knight\nled away. I may not do therewith, said the king.\n\nWith this there came a knight riding all armed on a great horse, and\ntook the lady away with him with force, and ever she cried and made\ngreat dole. When she was gone the king was glad, for she made such a\nnoise. Nay, said Merlin, ye may not leave these adventures so lightly;\nfor these adventures must be brought again or else it would be\ndisworship to you and to your feast. I will, said the king, that all\nbe done by your advice. Then, said Merlin, let call Sir Gawaine, for he\nmust bring again the white hart. Also, sir, ye must let call Sir Tor,\nfor he must bring again the brachet and the knight, or else slay him.\nAlso let call King Pellinore, for he must bring again the lady and the\nknight, or else slay him. And these three knights shall do marvellous\nadventures or they come again. Then were they called all three as it\nrehearseth afore, and each of them took his charge, and armed them\nsurely. But Sir Gawaine had the first request, and therefore we will\nbegin at him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How Sir Gawaine rode for to fetch again the hart, and how\ntwo brethren fought each against other for the hart.\n\nSIR GAWAINE rode more than a pace, and Gaheris his brother that rode\nwith him instead of a squire to do him service. So as they rode they\nsaw two knights fight on horseback passing sore, so Sir Gawaine and his\nbrother rode betwixt them, and asked them for what cause they fought so.\nThe one knight answered and said, We fight for a simple matter, for we\ntwo be two brethren born and begotten of one man and of one woman. Alas,\nsaid Sir Gawaine, why do ye so? Sir, said the elder, there came a white\nhart this way this day, and many hounds chased him, and a white brachet\nwas alway next him, and we understood it was adventure made for the high\nfeast of King Arthur, and therefore I would have gone after to have won\nme worship; and here my younger brother said he would go after the hart,\nfor he was better knight than I: and for this cause we fell at debate,\nand so we thought to prove which of us both was better knight. This is a\nsimple cause, said Sir Gawaine; uncouth men ye should debate withal, and\nnot brother with brother; therefore but if you will do by my counsel I\nwill have ado with you, that is ye shall yield you unto me, and that ye\ngo unto King Arthur and yield you unto his grace. Sir knight, said the\ntwo brethren, we are forfoughten and much blood have we lost through our\nwilfulness, and therefore we would be loath to have ado with you. Then\ndo as I will have you, said Sir Gawaine. We will agree to fulfil your\nwill; but by whom shall we say that we be thither sent? Ye may say, By\nthe knight that followeth the quest of the hart that was white. Now what\nis your name? said Gawaine. Sorlouse of the Forest, said the elder. And\nmy name is, said the younger, Brian of the Forest. And so they departed\nand went to the king's court, and Sir Gawaine on his quest.\n\nAnd as Gawaine followed the hart by the cry of the hounds, even afore\nhim there was a great river, and the hart swam over; and as Sir Gawaine\nwould follow after, there stood a knight over the other side, and said,\nSir knight, come not over after this hart but if thou wilt joust with\nme. I will not fail as for that, said Sir Gawaine, to follow the quest\nthat I am in, and so made his horse to swim over the water. And anon\nthey gat their spears and ran together full hard; but Sir Gawaine smote\nhim off his horse, and then he turned his horse and bade him yield\nhim. Nay, said the knight, not so, though thou have the better of me\non horseback. I pray thee, valiant knight, alight afoot, and match we\ntogether with swords. What is your name? said Sir Gawaine. Allardin of\nthe Isles, said the other. Then either dressed their shields and smote\ntogether, but Sir Gawaine smote him so hard through the helm that it\nwent to the brains, and the knight fell down dead. Ah! said Gaheris,\nthat was a mighty stroke of a young knight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII How the hart was chased into a castle and there slain, and\nhow Sir Gawaine slew a lady.\n\nTHEN Gawaine and Gaheris rode more than a pace after the white hart, and\nlet slip at the hart three couple of greyhounds, and so they chased the\nhart into a castle, and in the chief place of the castle they slew the\nhart; Sir Gawaine and Gaheris followed after. Right so there came a\nknight out of a chamber with a sword drawn in his hand and slew two of\nthe greyhounds, even in the sight of Sir Gawaine, and the remnant he\nchased them with his sword out of the castle. And when he came again, he\nsaid, O my white hart, me repenteth that thou art dead, for my sovereign\nlady gave thee to me, and evil have I kept thee, and thy death shall be\ndear bought an I live. And anon he went into his chamber and armed him,\nand came out fiercely, and there met he with Sir Gawaine. Why have ye\nslain my hounds? said Sir Gawaine, for they did but their kind, and\nliefer I had ye had wroken your anger upon me than upon a dumb beast.\nThou sayest truth, said the knight, I have avenged me on thy hounds,\nand so I will on thee or thou go. Then Sir Gawaine alighted afoot\nand dressed his shield, and struck together mightily, and clave their\nshields, and stoned their helms, and brake their hauberks that the blood\nran down to their feet.\n\nAt the last Sir Gawaine smote the knight so hard that he fell to the\nearth, and then he cried mercy, and yielded him, and besought him as he\nwas a knight and gentleman, to save his life. Thou shalt die, said Sir\nGawaine, for slaying of my hounds. I will make amends, said the knight,\nunto my power. Sir Gawaine would no mercy have, but unlaced his helm to\nhave stricken off his head. Right so came his lady out of a chamber and\nfell over him, and so he smote off her head by misadventure. Alas, said\nGaheris, that is foully and shamefully done, that shame shall never from\nyou; also ye should give mercy unto them that ask mercy, for a knight\nwithout mercy is without worship. Sir Gawaine was so stonied of the\ndeath of this fair lady that he wist not what he did, and said unto the\nknight, Arise, I will give thee mercy. Nay, nay, said the knight, I take\nno force of mercy now, for thou hast slain my love and my lady that\nI loved best of all earthly things. Me sore repenteth it, said Sir\nGawaine, for I thought to strike unto thee; but now thou shalt go unto\nKing Arthur and tell him of thine adventures, and how thou art overcome\nby the knight that went in the quest of the white hart. I take no force,\nsaid the knight, whether I live or I die; but so for dread of death\nhe swore to go unto King Arthur, and he made him to bear one greyhound\nbefore him on his horse, and another behind him. What is your name? said\nSir Gawaine, or we depart. My name is, said the knight, Ablamar of the\nMarsh. So he departed toward Camelot.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How four knights fought against Gawaine and Gaheris, and\nhow they were overcome, and their lives saved at request of four ladies.\n\nAND Sir Gawaine went into the castle, and made him ready to lie there\nall night, and would have unarmed him. What will ye do, said Gaheris,\nwill ye unarm you in this country? Ye may think ye have many enemies\nhere. They had not sooner said that word but there came four knights\nwell armed, and assailed Sir Gawaine hard, and said unto him, Thou\nnew-made knight, thou hast shamed thy knighthood, for a knight without\nmercy is dishonoured. Also thou hast slain a fair lady to thy great\nshame to the world's end, and doubt thou not thou shalt have great need\nof mercy or thou depart from us. And therewith one of them smote Sir\nGawaine a great stroke that nigh he fell to the earth, and Gaheris smote\nhim again sore, and so they were on the one side and on the other, that\nSir Gawaine and Gaheris were in jeopardy of their lives; and one with\na bow, an archer, smote Sir Gawaine through the arm that it grieved him\nwonderly sore. And as they should have been slain, there came four fair\nladies, and besought the knights of grace for Sir Gawaine; and goodly at\nrequest of the ladies they gave Sir Gawaine and Gaheris their lives,\nand made them to yield them as prisoners. Then Gawaine and Gaheris made\ngreat dole. Alas! said Sir Gawaine, mine arm grieveth me sore, I am like\nto be maimed; and so made his complaint piteously.\n\nEarly on the morrow there came to Sir Gawaine one of the four ladies\nthat had heard all his complaint, and said, Sir knight, what cheer? Not\ngood, said he. It is your own default, said the lady, for ye have done\na passing foul deed in the slaying of the lady, the which will be great\nvillainy unto you. But be ye not of King Arthur's kin? said the lady.\nYes truly, said Sir Gawaine. What is your name? said the lady, ye must\ntell it me or ye pass. My name is Gawaine, the King Lot of Orkney's son,\nand my mother is King Arthur's sister. Ah! then are ye nephew unto King\nArthur, said the lady, and I shall so speak for you that ye shall have\nconduct to go to King Arthur for his love. And so she departed and told\nthe four knights how their prisoner was King Arthur's nephew, and his\nname is Sir Gawaine, King Lot's son of Orkney. And they gave him the\nhart's head because it was in his quest. Then anon they delivered Sir\nGawaine under this promise, that he should bear the dead lady with him\nin this manner; the head of her was hanged about his neck, and the whole\nbody of her lay before him on his horse's mane. Right so rode he forth\nunto Camelot. And anon as he was come, Merlin desired of King Arthur\nthat Sir Gawaine should be sworn to tell of all his adventures, and\nhow he slew the lady, and how he would give no mercy unto the knight,\nwherethrough the lady was slain. Then the king and the queen were\ngreatly displeased with Sir Gawaine for the slaying of the lady. And\nthere by ordinance of the queen there was set a quest of ladies on Sir\nGawaine, and they judged him for ever while he lived to be with all\nladies, and to fight for their quarrels; and that ever he should be\ncourteous, and never to refuse mercy to him that asketh mercy. Thus was\nGawaine sworn upon the Four Evangelists that he should never be against\nlady nor gentlewoman, but if he fought for a lady and his adversary\nfought for another. And thus endeth the adventure of Sir Gawaine that he\ndid at the marriage of King Arthur. Amen.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How Sir Tor rode after the knight with the brachet, and of\nhis adventure by the way.\n\nWHEN Sir Tor was ready, he mounted upon his horseback, and rode after\nthe knight with the brachet. So as he rode he met with a dwarf suddenly\nthat smote his horse on the head with a staff, that he went backward his\nspear length. Why dost thou so? said Sir Tor. For thou shalt not pass\nthis way, but if thou joust with yonder knights of the pavilions. Then\nwas Tor ware where two pavilions were, and great spears stood out, and\ntwo shields hung on trees by the pavilions. I may not tarry, said Sir\nTor, for I am in a quest that I must needs follow. Thou shalt not pass,\nsaid the dwarf, and therewithal he blew his horn. Then there came one\narmed on horseback, and dressed his shield, and came fast toward Tor,\nand he dressed him against him, and so ran together that Tor bare him\nfrom his horse. And anon the knight yielded him to his mercy. But, sir,\nI have a fellow in yonder pavilion that will have ado with you anon.\nHe shall be welcome, said Sir Tor. Then was he ware of another knight\ncoming with great raundon, and each of them dressed to other, that\nmarvel it was to see; but the knight smote Sir Tor a great stroke in\nmidst of the shield that his spear all to-shivered. And Sir Tor smote\nhim through the shield below of the shield that it went through the\ncost of the knight, but the stroke slew him not. And therewith Sir Tor\nalighted and smote him on the helm a great stroke, and therewith the\nknight yielded him and besought him of mercy. I will well, said Sir\nTor, but thou and thy fellow must go unto King Arthur, and yield you\nprisoners unto him. By whom shall we say are we thither sent? Ye shall\nsay by the knight that went in the quest of the knight that went with\nthe brachet. Now, what be your two names? said Sir Tor. My name is,\nsaid the one, Sir Felot of Langduk; and my name is, said the other, Sir\nPetipase of Winchelsea. Now go ye forth, said Sir Tor, and God speed you\nand me. Then came the dwarf and said unto Sir Tor, I pray you give me a\ngift. I will well, said Sir Tor, ask. I ask no more, said the dwarf,\nbut that ye will suffer me to do you service, for I will serve no more\nrecreant knights. Take an horse, said Sir Tor, and ride on with me. I\nwot ye ride after the knight with the white brachet, and I shall bring\nyou where he is, said the dwarf. And so they rode throughout a forest,\nand at the last they were ware of two pavilions, even by a priory, with\ntwo shields, and the one shield was enewed with white, and the other\nshield was red.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How Sir Tor found the brachet with a lady, and how a knight\nassailed him for the said brachet.\n\nTHEREWITH Sir Tor alighted and took the dwarf his glaive, and so he came\nto the white pavilion, and saw three damosels lie in it, on one pallet,\nsleeping, and so he went to the other pavilion, and found a lady lying\nsleeping therein, but there was the white brachet that bayed at her\nfast, and therewith the lady yede out of the pavilion and all her\ndamosels. But anon as Sir Tor espied the white brachet, he took her by\nforce and took her to the dwarf. What, will ye so, said the lady, take\nmy brachet from me? Yea, said Sir Tor, this brachet have I sought from\nKing Arthur's court hither. Well, said the lady, knight, ye shall not go\nfar with her, but that ye shall be met and grieved. I shall abide what\nadventure that cometh by the grace of God, and so mounted upon his\nhorse, and passed on his way toward Camelot; but it was so near night he\nmight not pass but little further. Know ye any lodging? said Tor. I know\nnone, said the dwarf, but here beside is an hermitage, and there ye must\ntake lodging as ye find. And within a while they came to the hermitage\nand took lodging; and was there grass, oats and bread for their horses;\nsoon it was sped, and full hard was their supper; but there they rested\nthem all night till on the morn, and heard a mass devoutly, and took\ntheir leave of the hermit, and Sir Tor prayed the hermit to pray for\nhim. He said he would, and betook him to God. And so mounted upon\nhorseback and rode towards Camelot a long while.\n\nWith that they heard a knight call loud that came after them, and he\nsaid, Knight, abide and yield my brachet that thou took from my lady.\nSir Tor returned again, and beheld him how he was a seemly knight and\nwell horsed, and well armed at all points; then Sir Tor dressed his\nshield, and took his spear in his hands, and the other came fiercely\nupon him, and smote both horse and man to the earth. Anon they arose\nlightly and drew their swords as eagerly as lions, and put their shields\nafore them, and smote through the shields, that the cantels fell off\nboth parties. Also they tamed their helms that the hot blood ran out,\nand the thick mails of their hauberks they carved and rove in sunder\nthat the hot blood ran to the earth, and both they had many wounds and\nwere passing weary. But Sir Tor espied that the other knight fainted,\nand then he sued fast upon him, and doubled his strokes, and gart him go\nto the earth on the one side. Then Sir Tor bade him yield him. That will\nI not, said Abelleus, while my life lasteth and the soul is within my\nbody, unless that thou wilt give me the brachet. That will I not do,\nsaid Sir Tor, for it was my quest to bring again thy brachet, thee, or\nboth.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How Sir Tor overcame the knight, and how he lost his head at\nthe request of a lady.\n\nWITH that came a damosel riding on a palfrey as fast as she might drive,\nand cried with a loud voice unto Sir Tor. What will ye with me? said Sir\nTor. I beseech thee, said the damosel, for King Arthur's love, give me a\ngift; I require thee, gentle knight, as thou art a gentleman. Now, said\nTor, ask a gift and I will give it you. Gramercy, said the damosel;\nnow I ask the head of the false knight Abelleus, for he is the most\noutrageous knight that liveth, and the greatest murderer. I am loath,\nsaid Sir Tor, of that gift I have given you; let him make amends in that\nhe hath trespassed unto you. Now, said the damosel, he may not, for he\nslew mine own brother before mine own eyes, that was a better knight\nthan he, an he had had grace; and I kneeled half an hour afore him in\nthe mire for to save my brother's life, that had done him no damage, but\nfought with him by adventure of arms, and so for all that I could do\nhe struck off his head; wherefore I require thee, as thou art a true\nknight, to give me my gift, or else I shall shame thee in all the\ncourt of King Arthur; for he is the falsest knight living, and a great\ndestroyer of good knights. Then when Abelleus heard this, he was more\nafeard, and yielded him and asked mercy. I may not now, said Sir Tor,\nbut if I should be found false of my promise; for while I would have\ntaken you to mercy ye would none ask, but if ye had the brachet again,\nthat was my quest. And therewith he took off his helm, and he arose and\nfled, and Sir Tor after him, and smote off his head quite.\n\nNow sir, said the damosel, it is near night; I pray you come and lodge\nwith me here at my place, it is here fast by. I will well, said Sir Tor,\nfor his horse and he had fared evil since they departed from Camelot,\nand so he rode with her, and had passing good cheer with her; and she\nhad a passing fair old knight to her husband that made him passing good\ncheer, and well eased both his horse and him. And on the morn he heard\nhis mass, and brake his fast, and took his leave of the knight and of\nthe lady, that besought him to tell them his name. Truly, he said, my\nname is Sir Tor that was late made knight, and this was the first quest\nof arms that ever I did, to bring again that this knight Abelleus took\naway from King Arthur's court. O fair knight, said the lady and her\nhusband, an ye come here in our marches, come and see our poor lodging,\nand it shall be always at your commandment. So Sir Tor departed and came\nto Camelot on the third day by noon, and the king and the queen and all\nthe court was passing fain of his coming, and made great joy that he was\ncome again; for he went from the court with little succour, but as King\nPellinore his father gave him an old courser, and King Arthur gave him\narmour and a sword, and else had he none other succour, but rode so\nforth himself alone. And then the king and the queen by Merlin's advice\nmade him to swear to tell of his adventures, and so he told and made\nproofs of his deeds as it is afore rehearsed, wherefore the king and the\nqueen made great joy. Nay, nay, said Merlin, these be but japes to that\nhe shall do; for he shall prove a noble knight of prowess, as good\nas any is living, and gentle and courteous, and of good tatches, and\npassing true of his promise, and never shall outrage. Wherethrough\nMerlin's words King Arthur gave him an earldom of lands that fell unto\nhim. And here endeth the quest of Sir Tor, King Pellinore's son.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How King Pellinore rode after the lady and the knight that\nled her away, and how a lady desired help of him, and how he fought with\ntwo knights for that lady, of whom he slew the one at the first stroke.\n\nTHEN King Pellinore armed him and mounted upon his horse, and rode more\nthan a pace after the lady that the knight led away. And as he rode in a\nforest, he saw in a valley a damosel sit by a well, and a wounded knight\nin her arms, and Pellinore saluted her. And when she was ware of him,\nshe cried overloud, Help me, knight; for Christ's sake, King Pellinore.\nAnd he would not tarry, he was so eager in his quest, and ever she cried\nan hundred times after help. When she saw he would not abide, she prayed\nunto God to send him as much need of help as she had, and that he might\nfeel it or he died. So, as the book telleth, the knight there died that\nthere was wounded, wherefore the lady for pure sorrow slew herself with\nhis sword. As King Pellinore rode in that valley he met with a poor man,\na labourer. Sawest thou not, said Pellinore, a knight riding and leading\naway a lady? Yea, said the man, I saw that knight, and the lady that\nmade great dole; and yonder beneath in a valley there shall ye see two\npavilions, and one of the knights of the pavilions challenged that lady\nof that knight, and said she was his cousin near, wherefore he should\nlead her no farther. And so they waged battle in that quarrel, the one\nsaid he would have her by force, and the other said he would have the\nrule of her, by cause he was her kinsman, and would lead her to her kin.\nFor this quarrel he left them fighting. And if ye will ride a pace ye\nshall find them fighting, and the lady was beleft with the two squires\nin the pavilions. God thank thee, said King Pellinore.\n\nThen he rode a wallop till he had a sight of the two pavilions, and the\ntwo knights fighting. Anon he rode unto the pavilions, and saw the lady\nthat was his quest, and said, Fair lady, ye must go with me unto the\ncourt of King Arthur. Sir knight, said the two squires that were with\nher, yonder are two knights that fight for this lady, go thither and\ndepart them, and be agreed with them, and then may ye have her at your\npleasure. Ye say well, said King Pellinore. And anon he rode betwixt\nthem, and departed them, and asked them the causes why that they fought?\nSir knight, said the one, I shall tell you, this lady is my kinswoman\nnigh, mine aunt's daughter, and when I heard her complain that she was\nwith him maugre her head, I waged battle to fight with him. Sir knight,\nsaid the other, whose name was Hontzlake of Wentland, and this lady I\ngat by my prowess of arms this day at Arthur's court. That is untruly\nsaid, said King Pellinore, for ye came in suddenly there as we were at\nthe high feast, and took away this lady or any man might make him ready;\nand therefore it was my quest to bring her again and you both, or else\nthe one of us to abide in the field; therefore the lady shall go with\nme, or I will die for it, for I have promised it King Arthur. And\ntherefore fight ye no more, for none of you shall have no part of her\nat this time; and if ye list to fight for her, fight with me, and I will\ndefend her. Well, said the knights, make you ready, and we shall assail\nyou with all our power. And as King Pellinore would have put his horse\nfrom them, Sir Hontzlake rove his horse through with a sword, and said:\nNow art thou on foot as well as we are. When King Pellinore espied that\nhis horse was slain, lightly he leapt from his horse and pulled out his\nsword, and put his shield afore him, and said, Knight, keep well thy\nhead, for thou shalt have a buffet for the slaying of my horse. So King\nPellinore gave him such a stroke upon the helm that he clave the head\ndown to the chin, that he fell to the earth dead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. How King Pellinore gat the lady and brought her to Camelot\nto the court of King Arthur.\n\nAND then he turned him to the other knight, that was sore wounded. But\nwhen he saw the other's buffet, he would not fight, but kneeled down and\nsaid, Take my cousin the lady with you at your request, and I require\nyou, as ye be a true knight, put her to no shame nor villainy. What,\nsaid King Pellinore, will ye not fight for her? No, sir, said the\nknight, I will not fight with such a knight of prowess as ye be. Well,\nsaid Pellinore, ye say well; I promise you she shall have no villainy\nby me, as I am true knight; but now me lacketh an horse, said Pellinore,\nbut I will have Hontzlake's horse. Ye shall not need, said the knight,\nfor I shall give you such an horse as shall please you, so that you will\nlodge with me, for it is near night. I will well, said King Pellinore,\nabide with you all night. And there he had with him right good cheer,\nand fared of the best with passing good wine, and had merry rest that\nnight. And on the morn he heard a mass and dined; and then was brought\nhim a fair bay courser, and King Pellinore's saddle set upon him. Now,\nwhat shall I call you? said the knight, inasmuch as ye have my cousin\nat your desire of your quest. Sir, I shall tell you, my name is King\nPellinore of the Isles and knight of the Table Round. Now I am glad,\nsaid the knight, that such a noble man shall have the rule of my cousin.\nNow, what is your name? said Pellinore, I pray you tell me. Sir, my name\nis Sir Meliot of Logurs, and this lady my cousin hight Nimue, and the\nknight that was in the other pavilion is my sworn brother, a passing\ngood knight, and his name is Brian of the Isles, and he is full loath to\ndo wrong, and full loath to fight with any man, but if he be sore sought\non, so that for shame he may not leave it. It is marvel, said Pellinore,\nthat he will not have ado with me. Sir, he will not have ado with no man\nbut if it be at his request. Bring him to the court, said Pellinore, one\nof these days. Sir, we will come together. And ye shall be welcome, said\nPellinore, to the court of King Arthur, and greatly allowed for your\ncoming. And so he departed with the lady, and brought her to Camelot.\n\nSo as they rode in a valley it was full of stones, and there the lady's\nhorse stumbled and threw her down, that her arm was sore bruised and\nnear she swooned for pain. Alas! sir, said the lady, mine arm is out\nof lithe, wherethrough I must needs rest me. Ye shall well, said King\nPellinore. And so he alighted under a fair tree where was fair grass,\nand he put his horse thereto, and so laid him under the tree and slept\ntill it was nigh night. And when he awoke he would have ridden. Sir,\nsaid the lady, it is so dark that ye may as well ride backward as\nforward. So they abode still and made there their lodging. Then Sir\nPellinore put off his armour; then a little afore midnight they heard\nthe trotting of an horse. Be ye still, said King Pellinore, for we shall\nhear of some adventure.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How on the way he heard two knights, as he lay by night in\na valley, and of their adventures.\n\nAND therewith he armed him. So right even afore him there met two\nknights, the one came froward Camelot, and the other from the north, and\neither saluted other. What tidings at Camelot? said the one. By my head,\nsaid the other, there have I been and espied the court of King Arthur,\nand there is such a fellowship they may never be broken, and well-nigh\nall the world holdeth with Arthur, for there is the flower of chivalry.\nNow for this cause I am riding into the north, to tell our chieftains\nof the fellowship that is withholden with King Arthur. As for that, said\nthe other knight, I have brought a remedy with me, that is the greatest\npoison that ever ye heard speak of, and to Camelot will I with it, for\nwe have a friend right nigh King Arthur, and well cherished, that shall\npoison King Arthur; for so he hath promised our chieftains, and received\ngreat gifts for to do it. Beware, said the other knight, of Merlin, for\nhe knoweth all things by the devil's craft. Therefore will I not let it,\nsaid the knight. And so they departed asunder. Anon after Pellinore made\nhim ready, and his lady, [and] rode toward Camelot; and as they came by\nthe well there as the wounded knight was and the lady, there he found\nthe knight, and the lady eaten with lions or wild beasts, all save the\nhead, wherefore he made great sorrow, and wept passing sore, and said,\nAlas! her life might I have saved; but I was so fierce in my quest,\ntherefore I would not abide. Wherefore make ye such dole? said the lady.\nI wot not, said Pellinore, but my heart mourneth sore of the death of\nher, for she was a passing fair lady and a young. Now, will ye do by\nmine advice? said the lady, take this knight and let him be buried in\nan hermitage, and then take the lady's head and bear it with you unto\nArthur. So King Pellinore took this dead knight on his shoulders, and\nbrought him to the hermitage, and charged the hermit with the corpse,\nthat service should be done for the soul; and take his harness for your\npain. It shall be done, said the hermit, as I will answer unto God.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. How when he was come to Camelot he was sworn upon a book to\ntell the truth of his quest.\n\nAND therewith they departed, and came there as the head of the lady lay\nwith a fair yellow hair that grieved King Pellinore passingly sore when\nhe looked on it, for much he cast his heart on the visage. And so by\nnoon they came to Camelot; and the king and the queen were passing fain\nof his coming to the court. And there he was made to swear upon the Four\nEvangelists, to tell the truth of his quest from the one to the other.\nAh! Sir Pellinore, said Queen Guenever, ye were greatly to blame that\nye saved not this lady's life. Madam, said Pellinore, ye were greatly\nto blame an ye would not save your own life an ye might, but, save your\npleasure, I was so furious in my quest that I would not abide, and that\nrepenteth me, and shall the days of my life. Truly, said Merlin, ye\nought sore to repent it, for that lady was your own daughter begotten\non the lady of the Rule, and that knight that was dead was her love, and\nshould have wedded her, and he was a right good knight of a young man,\nand would have proved a good man, and to this court was he coming, and\nhis name was Sir Miles of the Launds, and a knight came behind him and\nslew him with a spear, and his name is Loraine le Savage, a false knight\nand a coward; and she for great sorrow and dole slew herself with his\nsword, and her name was Eleine. And because ye would not abide and help\nher, ye shall see your best friend fail you when ye be in the greatest\ndistress that ever ye were or shall be. And that penance God hath\nordained you for that deed, that he that ye shall most trust to of any\nman alive, he shall leave you there ye shall be slain. Me forthinketh,\nsaid King Pellinore, that this shall me betide, but God may fordo well\ndestiny.\n\nThus, when the quest was done of the white hart, the which followed Sir\nGawaine; and the quest of the brachet, followed of Sir Tor, Pellinore's\nson; and the quest of the lady that the knight took away, the which\nKing Pellinore at that time followed; then the king stablished all his\nknights, and them that were of lands not rich he gave them lands, and\ncharged them never to do outrageousity nor murder, and always to flee\ntreason; also, by no means to be cruel, but to give mercy unto him that\nasketh mercy, upon pain of forfeiture of their worship and lordship\nof King Arthur for evermore; and always to do ladies, damosels, and\ngentlewomen succour, upon pain of death. Also, that no man take no\nbattles in a wrongful quarrel for no law, nor for no world's goods. Unto\nthis were all the knights sworn of the Table Round, both old and young.\nAnd every year were they sworn at the high feast of Pentecost.\n\nExplicit the Wedding of King Arthur. Sequitur quartus liber.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IV.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How Merlin was assotted and doted on one of the ladies of the\nlake, and how he was shut in a rock under a stone and there died.\n\nSO after these quests of Sir Gawaine, Sir Tor, and King Pellinore, it\nfell so that Merlin fell in a dotage on the damosel that King Pellinore\nbrought to court, and she was one of the damosels of the lake, that\nhight Nimue. But Merlin would let her have no rest, but always he would\nbe with her. And ever she made Merlin good cheer till she had learned\nof him all manner thing that she desired; and he was assotted upon her,\nthat he might not be from her. So on a time he told King Arthur that\nhe should not dure long, but for all his crafts he should be put in the\nearth quick. And so he told the king many things that should befall, but\nalways he warned the king to keep well his sword and the scabbard, for\nhe told him how the sword and the scabbard should be stolen by a woman\nfrom him that he most trusted. Also he told King Arthur that he should\nmiss him,--Yet had ye liefer than all your lands to have me again. Ah,\nsaid the king, since ye know of your adventure, purvey for it, and put\naway by your crafts that misadventure. Nay, said Merlin, it will not be;\nso he departed from the king. And within a while the Damosel of the Lake\ndeparted, and Merlin went with her evermore wheresomever she went. And\nofttimes Merlin would have had her privily away by his subtle crafts;\nthen she made him to swear that he should never do none enchantment upon\nher if he would have his will. And so he sware; so she and Merlin went\nover the sea unto the land of Benwick, whereas King Ban was king that\nhad great war against King Claudas, and there Merlin spake with King\nBan's wife, a fair lady and a good, and her name was Elaine, and there\nhe saw young Launcelot. There the queen made great sorrow for the mortal\nwar that King Claudas made on her lord and on her lands. Take none\nheaviness, said Merlin, for this same child within this twenty year\nshall revenge you on King Claudas, that all Christendom shall speak of\nit; and this same child shall be the most man of worship of the world,\nand his first name is Galahad, that know I well, said Merlin, and since\nye have confirmed him Launcelot. That is truth, said the queen, his\nfirst name was Galahad. O Merlin, said the queen, shall I live to see my\nson such a man of prowess? Yea, lady, on my peril ye shall see it, and\nlive many winters after.\n\nAnd so, soon after, the lady and Merlin departed, and by the way Merlin\nshowed her many wonders, and came into Cornwall. And always Merlin lay\nabout the lady to have her maidenhood, and she was ever passing weary\nof him, and fain would have been delivered of him, for she was afeard\nof him because he was a devil's son, and she could not beskift him by\nno mean. And so on a time it happed that Merlin showed to her in a rock\nwhereas was a great wonder, and wrought by enchantment, that went under\na great stone. So by her subtle working she made Merlin to go under that\nstone to let her wit of the marvels there; but she wrought so there for\nhim that he came never out for all the craft he could do. And so she\ndeparted and left Merlin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How five kings came into this land to war against King\nArthur, and what counsel Arthur had against them.\n\nAND as King Arthur rode to Camelot, and held there a great feast with\nmirth and joy, so soon after he returned unto Cardoile, and there\ncame unto Arthur new tidings that the king of Denmark, and the king of\nIreland that was his brother, and the king of the Vale, and the king\nof Soleise, and the king of the Isle of Longtains, all these five kings\nwith a great host were entered into the land of King Arthur, and burnt\nand slew clean afore them, both cities and castles, that it was pity\nto hear. Alas, said Arthur, yet had I never rest one month since I was\ncrowned king of this land. Now shall I never rest till I meet with those\nkings in a fair field, that I make mine avow; for my true liege people\nshall not be destroyed in my default, go with me who will, and abide who\nthat will. Then the king let write unto King Pellinore, and prayed him\nin all haste to make him ready with such people as he might lightliest\nrear and hie him after in all haste. All the barons were privily wroth\nthat the king would depart so suddenly; but the king by no mean would\nabide, but made writing unto them that were not there, and bade them\nhie after him, such as were not at that time in the court. Then the king\ncame to Queen Guenever, and said, Lady, make you ready, for ye shall go\nwith me, for I may not long miss you; ye shall cause me to be the more\nhardy, what adventure so befall me; I will not wit my lady to be in no\njeopardy. Sir, said she, I am at your commandment, and shall be ready\nwhat time so ye be ready. So on the morn the king and the queen departed\nwith such fellowship as they had, and came into the north, into a forest\nbeside Humber, and there lodged them. When the word and tiding came unto\nthe five kings above said, that Arthur was beside Humber in a forest,\nthere was a knight, brother unto one of the five kings, that gave them\nthis counsel: Ye know well that Sir Arthur hath the flower of chivalry\nof the world with him, as it is proved by the great battle he did with\nthe eleven kings; and therefore hie unto him night and day till that we\nbe nigh him, for the longer he tarrieth the bigger he is, and we ever\nthe weaker; and he is so courageous of himself that he is come to the\nfield with little people, and therefore let us set upon him or day and\nwe shall slay down; of his knights there shall none escape.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How King Arthur had ado with them and overthrew them, and\nslew the five kings and made the remnant to flee.\n\nUNTO this counsel these five kings assented, and so they passed forth\nwith their host through North Wales, and came upon Arthur by night, and\nset upon his host as the king and his knights were in their pavilions.\nKing Arthur was unarmed, and had laid him to rest with his Queen\nGuenever. Sir, said Sir Kay, it is not good we be unarmed. We shall have\nno need, said Sir Gawaine and Sir Griflet, that lay in a little pavilion\nby the king. With that they heard a great noise, and many cried,\nTreason, treason! Alas, said King Arthur, we be betrayed! Unto arms,\nfellows, then he cried. So they were armed anon at all points. Then came\nthere a wounded knight unto the king, and said, Sir, save yourself and\nmy lady the queen, for our host is destroyed, and much people of ours\nslain. So anon the king and the queen and the three knights took their\nhorses, and rode toward Humber to pass over it, and the water was so\nrough that they were afraid to pass over. Now may ye choose, said King\nArthur, whether ye will abide and take the adventure on this side, for\nan ye be taken they will slay you. It were me liefer, said the queen, to\ndie in the water than to fall in your enemies' hands and there be slain.\n\n\nAnd as they stood so talking, Sir Kay saw the five kings coming on\nhorseback by themselves alone, with their spears in their hands even\ntoward them. Lo, said Sir Kay, yonder be the five kings; let us go to\nthem and match them. That were folly, said Sir Gawaine, for we are but\nthree and they be five. That is truth, said Sir Griflet. No force,\nsaid Sir Kay, I will undertake for two of them, and then may ye three\nundertake for the other three. And therewithal, Sir Kay let his horse\nrun as fast as he might, and struck one of them through the shield and\nthe body a fathom, that the king fell to the earth stark dead. That saw\nSir Gawaine, and ran unto another king so hard that he smote him through\nthe body. And therewithal King Arthur ran to another, and smote him\nthrough the body with a spear, that he fell to the earth dead Then Sir\nGriflet ran unto the fourth king, and gave him such a fall that his neck\nbrake. Anon Sir Kay ran unto the fifth king, and smote him so hard on\nthe helm that the stroke clave the helm and the head to the earth. That\nwas well stricken, said King Arthur, and worshipfully hast thou holden\nthy promise, therefore I shall honour thee while that I live. And\ntherewithal they set the queen in a barge into Humber; but always Queen\nGuenever praised Sir Kay for his deeds, and said, What lady that ye\nlove, and she love you not again she were greatly to blame; and among\nladies, said the queen, I shall bear your noble fame, for ye spake\na great word, and fulfilled it worshipfully. And therewith the queen\ndeparted.\n\nThen the king and the three knights rode into the forest, for there they\nsupposed to hear of them that were escaped; and there he found the most\npart of his people, and told them all how the five kings were dead. And\ntherefore let us hold us together till it be day, and when their host\nhave espied that their chieftains be slain, they will make such dole\nthat they shall no more help themselves. And right so as the king said,\nso it was; for when they found the five kings dead, they made such dole\nthat they fell from their horses. Therewithal came King Arthur but with\na few people, and slew on the left hand and on the right hand, that\nwell-nigh there escaped no man, but all were slain to the number thirty\nthousand. And when the battle was all ended, the king kneeled down and\nthanked God meekly. And then he sent for the queen, and soon she was\ncome, and she made great joy of the overcoming of that battle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How the battle was finished or he came, and how King Arthur\nfounded an abbey where the battle was.\n\nTHEREWITHAL came one to King Arthur, and told him that King Pellinore\nwas within three mile with a great host; and he said, Go unto him, and\nlet him understand how we have sped. So within a while King Pellinore\ncame with a great host, and saluted the people and the king, and there\nwas great joy made on every side. Then the king let search how much\npeople of his party there was slain; and there were found but little\npast two hundred men slain and eight knights of the Table Round in their\npavilions. Then the king let rear and devise in the same place whereat\nthe battle was done a fair abbey, and endowed it with great livelihood,\nand let it call the Abbey of La Beale Adventure. But when some of them\ncame into their countries, whereof the five kings were kings, and\ntold them how they were slain, there was made great dole. And all King\nArthur's enemies, as the King of North Wales, and the kings of the\nNorth, [when they] wist of the battle, they were passing heavy. And so\nthe king returned unto Camelot in haste.\n\nAnd when he was come to Camelot he called King Pellinore unto him, and\nsaid, Ye understand well that we have lost eight knights of the best of\nthe Table Round, and by your advice we will choose eight again of the\nbest we may find in this court. Sir, said Pellinore, I shall counsel you\nafter my conceit the best: there are in your court full noble knights\nboth of old and young; and therefore by mine advice ye shall choose half\nof the old and half of the young. Which be the old? said King Arthur.\nSir, said King Pellinore, meseemeth that King Uriens that hath wedded\nyour sister Morgan le Fay, and the King of the Lake, and Sir Hervise\nde Revel, a noble knight, and Sir Galagars, the fourth. This is well\ndevised, said King Arthur, and right so shall it be. Now, which are the\nfour young knights? said Arthur. Sir, said Pellinore, the first is Sir\nGawaine, your nephew, that is as good a knight of his time as any is in\nthis land; and the second as meseemeth best is Sir Griflet le Fise de\nDieu, that is a good knight and full desirous in arms, and who may see\nhim live he shall prove a good knight; and the third as meseemeth is\nwell to be one of the knights of the Round Table, Sir Kay the Seneschal,\nfor many times he hath done full worshipfully, and now at your last\nbattle he did full honourably for to undertake to slay two kings. By my\nhead, said Arthur, he is best worth to be a knight of the Round Table of\nany that ye have rehearsed, an he had done no more prowess in his life\ndays.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How Sir Tor was made knight of the Round Table, and how\nBagdemagus was displeased.\n\nNOW, said King Pellinore, I shall put to you two knights, and ye shall\nchoose which is most worthy, that is Sir Bagdemagus, and Sir Tor, my\nson. But because Sir Tor is my son I may not praise him, but else, an he\nwere not my son, I durst say that of his age there is not in this land\na better knight than he is, nor of better conditions and loath to do\nany wrong, and loath to take any wrong. By my head, said Arthur, he is\na passing good knight as any ye spake of this day, that wot I well, said\nthe king; for I have seen him proved, but he saith little and he doth\nmuch more, for I know none in all this court an he were as well born on\nhis mother's side as he is on your side, that is like him of prowess\nand of might: and therefore I will have him at this time, and leave Sir\nBagdemagus till another time. So when they were so chosen by the assent\nof all the barons, so were there found in their sieges every knights'\nnames that here are rehearsed, and so were they set in their sieges;\nwhereof Sir Bagdemagus was wonderly wroth, that Sir Tor was advanced\nafore him, and therefore suddenly he departed from the court, and took\nhis squire with him, and rode long in a forest till they came to a\ncross, and there alighted and said his prayers devoutly. The meanwhile\nhis squire found written upon the cross, that Bagdemagus should never\nreturn unto the court again, till he had won a knight's body of the\nRound Table, body for body. So, sir, said the squire, here I find\nwriting of you, therefore I rede you return again to the court. That\nshall I never, said Bagdemagus, till men speak of me great worship,\nand that I be worthy to be a knight of the Round Table. And so he rode\nforth, and there by the way he found a branch of an holy herb that was\nthe sign of the Sangreal, and no knight found such tokens but he were a\ngood liver.\n\nSo, as Sir Bagdemagus rode to see many adventures, it happed him to come\nto the rock whereas the Lady of the Lake had put Merlin under the stone,\nand there he heard him make great dole; whereof Sir Bagdemagus would\nhave holpen him, and went unto the great stone, and it was so heavy that\nan hundred men might not lift it up. When Merlin wist he was there, he\nbade leave his labour, for all was in vain, for he might never be holpen\nbut by her that put him there. And so Bagdemagus departed and did many\nadventures, and proved after a full good knight, and came again to the\ncourt and was made knight of the Round Table. So on the morn there fell\nnew tidings and other adventures.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How King Arthur, King Uriens, and Sir Accolon of Gaul,\nchased an hart, and of their marvellous adventures.\n\nTHEN it befell that Arthur and many of his knights rode a-hunting into a\ngreat forest, and it happed King Arthur, King Uriens, and Sir Accolon\nof Gaul, followed a great hart, for they three were well horsed, and so\nthey chased so fast that within a while they three were then ten mile\nfrom their fellowship. And at the last they chased so sore that they\nslew their horses underneath them. Then were they all three on foot, and\never they saw the hart afore them passing weary and enbushed. What will\nwe do? said King Arthur, we are hard bestead. Let us go on foot, said\nKing Uriens, till we may meet with some lodging. Then were they ware\nof the hart that lay on a great water bank, and a brachet biting on\nhis throat, and more other hounds came after. Then King Arthur blew the\nprise and dight the hart.\n\nThen the king looked about the world, and saw afore him in a great water\na little ship, all apparelled with silk down to the water, and the ship\ncame right unto them and landed on the sands. Then Arthur went to the\nbank and looked in, and saw none earthly creature therein. Sirs, said\nthe king, come thence, and let us see what is in this ship. So they went\nin all three, and found it richly behanged with cloth of silk. By then\nit was dark night, and there suddenly were about them an hundred torches\nset upon all the sides of the ship boards, and it gave great light; and\ntherewithal there came out twelve fair damosels and saluted King Arthur\non their knees, and called him by his name, and said he was right\nwelcome, and such cheer as they had he should have of the best. The king\nthanked them fair. Therewithal they led the king and his two fellows\ninto a fair chamber, and there was a cloth laid, richly beseen of all\nthat longed unto a table, and there were they served of all wines and\nmeats that they could think; of that the king had great marvel, for he\nfared never better in his life as for one supper. And so when they had\nsupped at their leisure, King Arthur was led into a chamber, a richer\nbeseen chamber saw he never none, and so was King Uriens served, and\nled into such another chamber, and Sir Accolon was led into the third\nchamber passing richly and well beseen; and so they were laid in their\nbeds easily. And anon they fell asleep, and slept marvellously sore\nall the night. And on the morrow King Uriens was in Camelot abed in his\nwife's arms, Morgan le Fay. And when he awoke he had great marvel,\nhow he came there, for on the even afore he was two days' journey from\nCamelot. And when King Arthur awoke he found himself in a dark prison,\nhearing about him many complaints of woful knights.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. How Arthur took upon him to fight to be delivered out of\nprison, and also for to deliver twenty knights that were in prison.\n\nWHAT are ye that so complain? said King Arthur. We be here twenty\nknights, prisoners, said they, and some of us have lain here seven year,\nand some more and some less. For what cause? said Arthur. We shall tell\nyou, said the knights; this lord of this castle, his name is Sir Damas,\nand he is the falsest knight that liveth, and full of treason, and a\nvery coward as any liveth, and he hath a younger brother, a good knight\nof prowess, his name is Sir Ontzlake; and this traitor Damas, the elder\nbrother will give him no part of his livelihood, but as Sir Ontzlake\nkeepeth thorough prowess of his hands, and so he keepeth from him a full\nfair manor and a rich, and therein Sir Ontzlake dwelleth worshipfully,\nand is well beloved of all people. And this Sir Damas, our master is as\nevil beloved, for he is without mercy, and he is a coward, and great war\nhath been betwixt them both, but Ontzlake hath ever the better, and ever\nhe proffereth Sir Damas to fight for the livelihood, body for body, but\nhe will not do; other-else to find a knight to fight for him. Unto that\nSir Damas had granted to find a knight, but he is so evil beloved and\nhated, that there is never a knight will fight for him. And when Damas\nsaw this, that there was never a knight would fight for him, he hath\ndaily lain await with many knights with him, and taken all the knights\nin this country to see and espy their adventures, he hath taken them by\nforce and brought them to his prison. And so he took us separately as we\nrode on our adventures, and many good knights have died in this prison\nfor hunger, to the number of eighteen knights; and if any of us all that\nhere is, or hath been, would have foughten with his brother Ontzlake, he\nwould have delivered us, but for because this Damas is so false and so\nfull of treason we would never fight for him to die for it. And we be so\nlean for hunger that unnethe we may stand on our feet. God deliver you,\nfor his mercy, said Arthur.\n\nAnon, therewithal there came a damosel unto Arthur, and asked him, What\ncheer? I cannot say, said he. Sir, said she, an ye will fight for my\nlord, ye shall be delivered out of prison, and else ye escape never the\nlife. Now, said Arthur, that is hard, yet had I liefer to fight with a\nknight than to die in prison; with this, said Arthur, I may be delivered\nand all these prisoners, I will do the battle. Yes, said the damosel.\nI am ready, said Arthur, an I had horse and armour. Ye shall lack none,\nsaid the damosel. Meseemeth, damosel, I should have seen you in the\ncourt of Arthur. Nay said the damosel, I came never there, I am the\nlord's daughter of this castle. Yet was she false, for she was one of\nthe damosels of Morgan le Fay.\n\nAnon she went unto Sir Damas, and told him how he would do battle for\nhim, and so he sent for Arthur. And when he came he was well coloured,\nand well made of his limbs, that all knights that saw him said it were\npity that such a knight should die in prison. So Sir Damas and he were\nagreed that he should fight for him upon this covenant, that all other\nknights should be delivered; and unto that was Sir Damas sworn unto\nArthur, and also to do the battle to the uttermost. And with that all\nthe twenty knights were brought out of the dark prison into the hall,\nand delivered, and so they all abode to see the battle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How Accolon found himself by a well, and he took upon him\nto do battle against Arthur.\n\nNOW turn we unto Accolon of Gaul, that when he awoke he found himself by\na deep well-side, within half a foot, in great peril of death. And there\ncame out of that fountain a pipe of silver, and out of that pipe ran\nwater all on high in a stone of marble. When Sir Accolon saw this, he\nblessed him and said, Jesus save my lord King Arthur, and King Uriens,\nfor these damosels in this ship have betrayed us, they were devils and\nno women; and if I may escape this misadventure, I shall destroy all\nwhere I may find these false damosels that use enchantments. Right with\nthat there came a dwarf with a great mouth and a flat nose, and saluted\nSir Accolon, and said how he came from Queen Morgan le Fay, and she\ngreeteth you well, and biddeth you be of strong heart, for ye shall\nfight to morrow with a knight at the hour of prime, and therefore she\nhath sent you here Excalibur, Arthur's sword, and the scabbard, and\nshe biddeth you as ye love her, that ye do the battle to the uttermost,\nwithout any mercy, like as ye had promised her when ye spake together in\nprivity; and what damosel that bringeth her the knight's head, which\nye shall fight withal, she will make her a queen. Now I understand you\nwell, said Accolon, I shall hold that I have promised her now I have\nthe sword: when saw ye my lady Queen Morgan le Fay? Right late, said the\ndwarf. Then Accolon took him in his arms and said, Recommend me unto my\nlady queen, and tell her all shall be done that I have promised her, and\nelse I will die for it. Now I suppose, said Accolon, she hath made all\nthese crafts and enchantments for this battle. Ye may well believe\nit, said the dwarf. Right so there came a knight and a lady with six\nsquires, and saluted Accolon, and prayed him for to arise, and come and\nrest him at his manor. And so Accolon mounted upon a void horse, and\nwent with the knight unto a fair manor by a priory, and there he had\npassing good cheer.\n\nThen Sir Damas sent unto his brother Sir Ontzlake, and bade make him\nready by to-morn at the hour of prime, and to be in the field to fight\nwith a good knight, for he had found a good knight that was ready to\ndo battle at all points. When this word came unto Sir Ontzlake he was\npassing heavy, for he was wounded a little to-fore through both his\nthighs with a spear, and made great dole; but as he was wounded, he\nwould have taken the battle on hand. So it happed at that time, by the\nmeans of Morgan le Fay, Accolon was with Sir Ontzlake lodged; and when\nhe heard of that battle, and how Ontzlake was wounded, he said that he\nwould fight for him. Because Morgan le Fay had sent him Excalibur and\nthe sheath for to fight with the knight on the morn: this was the cause\nSir Accolon took the battle on hand. Then Sir Ontzlake was passing glad,\nand thanked Sir Accolon with all his heart that he would do so much for\nhim. And therewithal Sir Ontzlake sent word unto his brother Sir Damas,\nthat he had a knight that for him should be ready in the field by the\nhour of prime.\n\nSo on the morn Sir Arthur was armed and well horsed, and asked Sir\nDamas, When shall we to the field? Sir, said Sir Damas, ye shall hear\nmass. And so Arthur heard a mass, and when mass was done there came a\nsquire on a great horse, and asked Sir Damas if his knight were ready,\nfor our knight is ready in the field. Then Sir Arthur mounted upon\nhorseback, and there were all the knights and commons of that country;\nand so by all advices there were chosen twelve good men of the country\nfor to wait upon the two knights. And right as Arthur was on horseback\nthere came a damosel from Morgan le Fay, and brought unto Sir Arthur\na sword like unto Excalibur, and the scabbard, and said unto Arthur,\nMorgan le Fay sendeth here your sword for great love. And he thanked\nher, and weened it had been so, but she was false, for the sword and the\nscabbard was counterfeit, and brittle, and false.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. Of the battle between King Arthur and Accolon.\n\nAND then they dressed them on both parties of the field, and let their\nhorses run so fast that either smote other in the midst of the shield\nwith their spear-heads, that both horse and man went to the earth; and\nthen they started up both, and pulled out their swords. The meanwhile\nthat they were thus at the battle, came the Damosel of the Lake into the\nfield, that put Merlin under the stone; and she came thither for love\nof King Arthur, for she knew how Morgan le Fay had so ordained that King\nArthur should have been slain that day, and therefore she came to save\nhis life. And so they went eagerly to the battle, and gave many great\nstrokes, but always Arthur's sword bit not like Accolon's sword; but for\nthe most part, every stroke that Accolon gave he wounded sore Arthur,\nthat it was marvel he stood, and always his blood fell from him fast.\n\nWhen Arthur beheld the ground so sore be-bled he was dismayed, and then\nhe deemed treason that his sword was changed; for his sword bit not\nsteel as it was wont to do, therefore he dreaded him sore to be dead,\nfor ever him seemed that the sword in Accolon's hand was Excalibur,\nfor at every stroke that Accolon struck he drew blood on Arthur. Now,\nknight, said Accolon unto Arthur, keep thee well from me; but Arthur\nanswered not again, and gave him such a buffet on the helm that it made\nhim to stoop, nigh falling down to the earth. Then Sir Accolon withdrew\nhim a little, and came on with Excalibur on high, and smote Sir Arthur\nsuch a buffet that he fell nigh to the earth. Then were they wroth both,\nand gave each other many sore strokes, but always Sir Arthur lost so\nmuch blood that it was marvel he stood on his feet, but he was so full\nof knighthood that knightly he endured the pain. And Sir Accolon lost\nnot a deal of blood, therefore he waxed passing light, and Sir Arthur\nwas passing feeble, and weened verily to have died; but for all that he\nmade countenance as though he might endure, and held Accolon as short\nas he might. But Accolon was so bold because of Excalibur that he waxed\npassing hardy. But all men that beheld him said they saw never knight\nfight so well as Arthur did considering the blood that he bled. So was\nall the people sorry for him, but the two brethren would not accord.\nThen always they fought together as fierce knights, and Sir Arthur\nwithdrew him a little for to rest him, and Sir Accolon called him\nto battle and said, It is no time for me to suffer thee to rest. And\ntherewith he came fiercely upon Arthur, and Sir Arthur was wroth for\nthe blood that he had lost, and smote Accolon on high upon the helm,\nso mightily, that he made him nigh to fall to the earth; and therewith\nArthur's sword brast at the cross, and fell in the grass among the\nblood, and the pommel and the sure handles he held in his hands. When\nSir Arthur saw that, he was in great fear to die, but always he held up\nhis shield and lost no ground, nor bated no cheer.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How King Arthur's sword that he fought with brake, and how he\nrecovered of Accolon his own sword Excalibur, and overcame his enemy.\n\nTHEN Sir Accolon began with words of treason, and said, Knight, thou art\novercome, and mayst not endure, and also thou art weaponless, and thou\nhast lost much of thy blood, and I am full loath to slay thee, therefore\nyield thee to me as recreant. Nay, said Sir Arthur, I may not so, for I\nhave promised to do the battle to the uttermost by the faith of my body,\nwhile me lasteth the life, and therefore I had liefer to die with\nhonour than to live with shame; and if it were possible for me to die\nan hundred times, I had liefer to die so oft than yield me to thee;\nfor though I lack weapon, I shall lack no worship, and if thou slay me\nweaponless that shall be thy shame. Well, said Accolon, as for the shame\nI will not spare, now keep thee from me, for thou art but a dead man.\nAnd therewith Accolon gave him such a stroke that he fell nigh to the\nearth, and would have had Arthur to have cried him mercy. But Sir Arthur\npressed unto Accolon with his shield, and gave him with the pommel in\nhis hand such a buffet that he went three strides aback.\n\nWhen the Damosel of the Lake beheld Arthur, how full of prowess his\nbody was, and the false treason that was wrought for him to have had\nhim slain, she had great pity that so good a knight and such a man\nof worship should so be destroyed. And at the next stroke Sir Accolon\nstruck him such a stroke that by the damosel's enchantment the sword\nExcalibur fell out of Accolon's hand to the earth. And therewithal Sir\nArthur lightly leapt to it, and gat it in his hand, and forthwithal he\nknew that it was his sword Excalibur, and said, Thou hast been from me\nall too long, and much damage hast thou done me; and therewith he espied\nthe scabbard hanging by his side, and suddenly he sterte to him and\npulled the scabbard from him, and threw it from him as far as he might\nthrow it. O knight, said Arthur, this day hast thou done me great\ndamage with this sword; now are ye come unto your death, for I shall not\nwarrant you but ye shall as well be rewarded with this sword, or ever\nwe depart, as thou hast rewarded me; for much pain have ye made me to\nendure, and much blood have I lost. And therewith Sir Arthur rushed on\nhim with all his might and pulled him to the earth, and then rushed off\nhis helm, and gave him such a buffet on the head that the blood came out\nat his ears, his nose, and his mouth. Now will I slay thee, said Arthur.\nSlay me ye may well, said Accolon, an it please you, for ye are the best\nknight that ever I found, and I see well that God is with you. But for I\npromised to do this battle, said Accolon, to the uttermost, and never\nto be recreant while I lived, therefore shall I never yield me with my\nmouth, but God do with my body what he will. Then Sir Arthur remembered\nhim, and thought he should have seen this knight. Now tell me, said\nArthur, or I will slay thee, of what country art thou, and of what\ncourt? Sir Knight, said Sir Accolon, I am of the court of King Arthur,\nand my name is Accolon of Gaul. Then was Arthur more dismayed than he\nwas beforehand; for then he remembered him of his sister Morgan le Fay,\nand of the enchantment of the ship. O sir knight, said he, I pray you\ntell me who gave you this sword, and by whom ye had it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How Accolon confessed the treason of Morgan le Fay, King\nArthur's sister, and how she would have done slay him.\n\nTHEN Sir Accolon bethought him, and said, Woe worth this sword, for by\nit have I got my death. It may well be, said the king. Now, sir, said\nAccolon, I will tell you; this sword hath been in my keeping the most\npart of this twelvemonth; and Morgan le Fay, King Uriens' wife, sent it\nme yesterday by a dwarf, to this intent, that I should slay King Arthur,\nher brother. For ye shall understand King Arthur is the man in the world\nthat she most hateth, because he is most of worship and of prowess of\nany of her blood; also she loveth me out of measure as paramour, and I\nher again; and if she might bring about to slay Arthur by her crafts,\nshe would slay her husband King Uriens lightly, and then had she me\ndevised to be king in this land, and so to reign, and she to be my\nqueen; but that is now done, said Accolon, for I am sure of my death.\nWell, said Sir Arthur, I feel by you ye would have been king in this\nland. It had been great damage to have destroyed your lord, said Arthur.\nIt is truth, said Accolon, but now I have told you truth, wherefore I\npray you tell me of whence ye are, and of what court? O Accolon, said\nKing Arthur, now I let thee wit that I am King Arthur, to whom thou hast\ndone great damage. When Accolon heard that he cried aloud, Fair, sweet\nlord, have mercy on me, for I knew not you. O Sir Accolon, said King\nArthur, mercy shalt thou have, because I feel by thy words at this time\nthou knewest not my person; but I understand well by thy words that thou\nhast agreed to the death of my person, and therefore thou art a traitor;\nbut I wite thee the less, for my sister Morgan le Fay by her false\ncrafts made thee to agree and consent to her false lusts, but I shall be\nsore avenged upon her an I live, that all Christendom shall speak of it;\nGod knoweth I have honoured her and worshipped her more than all my kin,\nand more have I trusted her than mine own wife and all my kin after.\n\nThen Sir Arthur called the keepers of the field, and said, Sirs, come\nhither, for here are we two knights that have fought unto a great damage\nunto us both, and like each one of us to have slain other, if it had\nhapped so; and had any of us known other, here had been no battle, nor\nstroke stricken. Then all aloud cried Accolon unto all the knights and\nmen that were then there gathered together, and said to them in this\nmanner, O lords, this noble knight that I have fought withal, the\nwhich me sore repenteth, is the most man of prowess, of manhood, and of\nworship in the world, for it is himself King Arthur, our alther liege\nlord, and with mishap and with misadventure have I done this battle with\nthe king and lord that I am holden withal.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How Arthur accorded the two brethren, and delivered the\ntwenty knights, and how Sir Accolon died.\n\nTHEN all the people fell down on their knees and cried King Arthur\nmercy. Mercy shall ye have, said Arthur: here may ye see what adventures\nbefall ofttime of errant knights, how that I have fought with a knight\nof mine own unto my great damage and his both. But, sirs, because I am\nsore hurt, and he both, and I had great need of a little rest, ye shall\nunderstand the opinion betwixt you two brethren: As to thee, Sir Damas,\nfor whom I have been champion and won the field of this knight, yet will\nI judge because ye, Sir Damas, are called an orgulous knight, and full\nof villainy, and not worth of prowess your deeds, therefore I will that\nye give unto your brother all the whole manor with the appurtenance,\nunder this form, that Sir Ontzlake hold the manor of you, and yearly to\ngive you a palfrey to ride upon, for that will become you better to\nride on than upon a courser. Also I charge thee, Sir Damas, upon pain\nof death, that thou never distress no knights errant that ride on their\nadventure. And also that thou restore these twenty knights that thou\nhast long kept prisoners, of all their harness, that they be content\nfor; and if any of them come to my court and complain of thee, by my\nhead thou shalt die therefore. Also, Sir Ontzlake, as to you, because ye\nare named a good knight, and full of prowess, and true and gentle in\nall your deeds, this shall be your charge I will give you, that in all\ngoodly haste ye come unto me and my court, and ye shall be a knight\nof mine, and if your deeds be thereafter I shall so prefer you, by the\ngrace of God, that ye shall in short time be in ease for to live as\nworshipfully as your brother Sir Damas. God thank your largeness of your\ngoodness and of your bounty, I shall be from henceforward at all times\nat your commandment; for, sir, said Sir Ontzlake, as God would, as I was\nhurt but late with an adventurous knight through both my thighs, that\ngrieved me sore, and else had I done this battle with you. God would,\nsaid Arthur, it had been so, for then had not I been hurt as I am. I\nshall tell you the cause why: for I had not been hurt as I am, had it\nnot been mine own sword, that was stolen from me by treason; and this\nbattle was ordained aforehand to have slain me, and so it was brought to\nthe purpose by false treason, and by false enchantment. Alas, said Sir\nOntzlake, that is great pity that ever so noble a man as ye are of your\ndeeds and prowess, that any man or woman might find in their hearts to\nwork any treason against you. I shall reward them, said Arthur, in short\ntime, by the grace of God. Now, tell me, said Arthur, how far am I from\nCamelot? Sir, ye are two days' journey therefrom. I would fain be at\nsome place of worship, said Sir Arthur, that I might rest me. Sir, said\nSir Ontzlake, hereby is a rich abbey of your elders' foundation, of\nnuns, but three miles hence. So the king took his leave of all the\npeople, and mounted upon horseback, and Sir Accolon with him. And when\nthey were come to the abbey, he let fetch leeches and search his wounds\nand Accolon's both; but Sir Accolon died within four days, for he had\nbled so much blood that he might not live, but King Arthur was well\nrecovered. So when Accolon was dead he let send him on an horse-bier\nwith six knights unto Camelot, and said: Bear him to my sister Morgan\nle Fay, and say that I send her him to a present, and tell her I have my\nsword Excalibur and the scabbard; so they departed with the body.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. How Morgan would have slain Sir Uriens her husband, and\nhow Sir Uwaine her son saved him.\n\nTHE meanwhile Morgan le Fay had weened King Arthur had been dead. So on\na day she espied King Uriens lay in his bed sleeping. Then she called\nunto her a maiden of her counsel, and said, Go fetch me my lord's sword,\nfor I saw never better time to slay him than now. O madam, said the\ndamosel, an ye slay my lord ye can never escape. Care not you, said\nMorgan le Fay, for now I see my time in the which it is best to do it,\nand therefore hie thee fast and fetch me the sword. Then the damosel\ndeparted, and found Sir Uwaine sleeping upon a bed in another chamber,\nso she went unto Sir Uwaine, and awaked him, and bade him, Arise, and\nwait on my lady your mother, for she will slay the king your father\nsleeping in his bed, for I go to fetch his sword. Well, said Sir Uwaine,\ngo on your way, and let me deal. Anon the damosel brought Morgan the\nsword with quaking hands, and she lightly took the sword, and pulled it\nout, and went boldly unto the bed's side, and awaited how and where she\nmight slay him best. And as she lifted up the sword to smite, Sir Uwaine\nleapt unto his mother, and caught her by the hand, and said, Ah, fiend,\nwhat wilt thou do? An thou wert not my mother, with this sword I should\nsmite off thy head. Ah, said Sir Uwaine, men saith that Merlin was\nbegotten of a devil, but I may say an earthly devil bare me. O fair son,\nUwaine, have mercy upon me, I was tempted with a devil, wherefore I cry\nthee mercy; I will never more do so; and save my worship and discover\nme not. On this covenant, said Sir Uwaine, I will forgive it you, so\nye will never be about to do such deeds. Nay, son, said she, and that I\nmake you assurance.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How Queen Morgan le Fay made great sorrow for the death of\nAccolon, and how she stole away the scabbard from Arthur.\n\nTHEN came tidings unto Morgan le Fay that Accolon was dead, and his body\nbrought unto the church, and how King Arthur had his sword again. But\nwhen Queen Morgan wist that Accolon was dead, she was so sorrowful\nthat near her heart to-brast. But because she would not it were known,\noutward she kept her countenance, and made no semblant of sorrow. But\nwell she wist an she abode till her brother Arthur came thither, there\nshould no gold go for her life.\n\nThen she went unto Queen Guenever, and asked her leave to ride into the\ncountry. Ye may abide, said Queen Guenever, till your brother the king\ncome home. I may not, said Morgan le Fay, for I have such hasty tidings,\nthat I may not tarry. Well, said Guenever, ye may depart when ye will.\nSo early on the morn, or it was day, she took her horse and rode all\nthat day and most part of the night, and on the morn by noon she came to\nthe same abbey of nuns whereas lay King Arthur; and she knowing he was\nthere, she asked where he was. And they answered how he had laid him\nin his bed to sleep, for he had had but little rest these three nights.\nWell, said she, I charge you that none of you awake him till I do, and\nthen she alighted off her horse, and thought for to steal away Excalibur\nhis sword, and so she went straight unto his chamber, and no man durst\ndisobey her commandment, and there she found Arthur asleep in his bed,\nand Excalibur in his right hand naked. When she saw that she was passing\nheavy that she might not come by the sword without she had awaked him,\nand then she wist well she had been dead. Then she took the scabbard and\nwent her way on horseback. When the king awoke and missed his scabbard,\nhe was wroth, and he asked who had been there, and they said his sister,\nQueen Morgan had been there, and had put the scabbard under her mantle\nand was gone. Alas, said Arthur, falsely ye have watched me. Sir, said\nthey all, we durst not disobey your sister's commandment. Ah, said the\nking, let fetch the best horse may be found, and bid Sir Ontzlake arm\nhim in all haste, and take another good horse and ride with me. So anon\nthe king and Ontzlake were well armed, and rode after this lady, and so\nthey came by a cross and found a cowherd, and they asked the poor man if\nthere came any lady riding that way. Sir, said this poor man, right late\ncame a lady riding with a forty horses, and to yonder forest she rode.\nThen they spurred their horses, and followed fast, and within a while\nArthur had a sight of Morgan le Fay; then he chased as fast as he might.\nWhen she espied him following her, she rode a greater pace through the\nforest till she came to a plain, and when she saw she might not escape,\nshe rode unto a lake thereby, and said, Whatsoever come of me, my\nbrother shall not have this scabbard. And then she let throw the\nscabbard in the deepest of the water so it sank, for it was heavy of\ngold and precious stones.\n\nThen she rode into a valley where many great stones were, and when\nshe saw she must be overtaken, she shaped herself, horse and man, by\nenchantment unto a great marble stone. Anon withal came Sir Arthur and\nSir Ontzlake whereas the king might know his sister and her men, and one\nknight from another. Ah, said the king, here may ye see the vengeance of\nGod, and now am I sorry that this misadventure is befallen. And then he\nlooked for the scabbard, but it would not be found, so he returned to\nthe abbey where he came from. So when Arthur was gone she turned all\ninto the likeliness as she and they were before, and said, Sirs, now may\nwe go where we will.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. How Morgan le Fay saved a knight that should have been\ndrowned, and how King Arthur returned home again.\n\nTHEN said Morgan, Saw ye Arthur, my brother? Yea, said her knights,\nright well, and that ye should have found an we might have stirred from\none stead, for by his armyvestal countenance he would have caused us to\nhave fled. I believe you, said Morgan. Anon after as she rode she met\na knight leading another knight on his horse before him, bound hand and\nfoot, blindfold, to have drowned him in a fountain. When she saw this\nknight so bound, she asked him, What will ye do with that knight? Lady,\nsaid he, I will drown him. For what cause? she asked. For I found him\nwith my wife, and she shall have the same death anon. That were pity,\nsaid Morgan le Fay. Now, what say ye, knight, is it truth that he saith\nof you? she said to the knight that should be drowned. Nay truly, madam,\nhe saith not right on me. Of whence be ye, said Morgan le Fay, and of\nwhat country? I am of the court of King Arthur, and my name is Manassen,\ncousin unto Accolon of Gaul. Ye say well, said she, and for the love of\nhim ye shall be delivered, and ye shall have your adversary in the same\ncase ye be in. So Manassen was loosed and the other knight bound. And\nanon Manassen unarmed him, and armed himself in his harness, and so\nmounted on horseback, and the knight afore him, and so threw him into\nthe fountain and drowned him. And then he rode unto Morgan again, and\nasked if she would anything unto King Arthur. Tell him that I rescued\nthee, not for the love of him but for the love of Accolon, and tell him\nI fear him not while I can make me and them that be with me in likeness\nof stones; and let him wit I can do much more when I see my time. And\nso she departed into the country of Gore, and there was she richly\nreceived, and made her castles and towns passing strong, for always she\ndreaded much King Arthur.\n\nWhen the king had well rested him at the abbey, he rode unto Camelot,\nand found his queen and his barons right glad of his coming. And when\nthey heard of his strange adventures as is afore rehearsed, then all had\nmarvel of the falsehood of Morgan le Fay; many knights wished her burnt.\nThen came Manassen to court and told the king of his adventure. Well,\nsaid the king, she is a kind sister; I shall so be avenged on her an I\nlive, that all Christendom shall speak of it. So on the morn there came\na damosel from Morgan to the king, and she brought with her the richest\nmantle that ever was seen in that court, for it was set as full of\nprecious stones as one might stand by another, and there were the\nrichest stones that ever the king saw. And the damosel said, Your sister\nsendeth you this mantle, and desireth that ye should take this gift of\nher; and in what thing she hath offended you, she will amend it at your\nown pleasure. When the king beheld this mantle it pleased him much, but\nhe said but little.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. How the Damosel of the Lake saved King Arthur from mantle\nthat should have burnt him.\n\nWITH that came the Damosel of the Lake unto the king, and said, Sir,\nI must speak with you in privity. Say on, said the king, what ye will.\nSir, said the damosel, put not on you this mantle till ye have seen\nmore, and in no wise let it not come on you, nor on no knight of yours,\ntill ye command the bringer thereof to put it upon her. Well, said King\nArthur, it shall be done as ye counsel me. And then he said unto the\ndamosel that came from his sister, Damosel, this mantle that ye have\nbrought me, I will see it upon you. Sir, she said, It will not beseem me\nto wear a king's garment. By my head, said Arthur, ye shall wear it or\nit come on my back, or any man's that here is. And so the king made it\nto be put upon her, and forth withal she fell down dead, and never more\nspake word after and burnt to coals. Then was the king wonderly wroth,\nmore than he was to-forehand, and said unto King Uriens, My sister,\nyour wife, is alway about to betray me, and well I wot either ye, or my\nnephew, your son, is of counsel with her to have me destroyed; but as\nfor you, said the king to King Uriens, I deem not greatly that ye be\nof her counsel, for Accolon confessed to me by his own mouth, that she\nwould have destroyed you as well as me, therefore I hold you excused;\nbut as for your son, Sir Uwaine, I hold him suspect, therefore I charge\nyou put him out of my court. So Sir Uwaine was discharged. And when Sir\nGawaine wist that, he made him ready to go with him; and said, Whoso\nbanisheth my cousin-germain shall banish me. So they two departed, and\nrode into a great forest, and so they came to an abbey of monks, and\nthere were well lodged. But when the king wist that Sir Gawaine was\ndeparted from the court, there was made great sorrow among all the\nestates. Now, said Gaheris, Gawaine's brother, we have lost two good\nknights for the love of one. So on the morn they heard their masses in\nthe abbey, and so they rode forth till that they came to a great forest.\nThen was Sir Gawaine ware in a valley by a turret [of] twelve fair\ndamosels, and two knights armed on great horses, and the damosels went\nto and fro by a tree. And then was Sir Gawaine ware how there hung a\nwhite shield on that tree, and ever as the damosels came by it they spit\nupon it, and some threw mire upon the shield.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. How Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine met with twelve fair\ndamosels, and how they complained on Sir Marhaus.\n\nTHEN Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine went and saluted them, and asked why\nthey did that despite to the shield. Sir, said the damosels, we shall\ntell you. There is a knight in this country that owneth this white\nshield, and he is a passing good man of his hands, but he hateth all\nladies and gentlewomen, and therefore we do all this despite to the\nshield. I shall say you, said Sir Gawaine, it beseemeth evil a good\nknight to despise all ladies and gentlewomen, and peradventure though he\nhate you he hath some certain cause, and peradventure he loveth in some\nother places ladies and gentlewomen, and to be loved again, an he be\nsuch a man of prowess as ye speak of. Now, what is his name? Sir, said\nthey, his name is Marhaus, the king's son of Ireland. I know him well,\nsaid Sir Uwaine, he is a passing good knight as any is alive, for I saw\nhim once proved at a jousts where many knights were gathered, and that\ntime there might no man withstand him. Ah! said Sir Gawaine, damosels,\nmethinketh ye are to blame, for it is to suppose, he that hung that\nshield there, he will not be long therefrom, and then may those knights\nmatch him on horseback, and that is more your worship than thus; for I\nwill abide no longer to see a knight's shield dishonoured. And therewith\nSir Uwaine and Gawaine departed a little from them, and then were they\nware where Sir Marhaus came riding on a great horse straight toward\nthem. And when the twelve damosels saw Sir Marhaus they fled into the\nturret as they were wild, so that some of them fell by the way. Then the\none of the knights of the tower dressed his shield, and said on high,\nSir Marhaus, defend thee. And so they ran together that the knight brake\nhis spear on Marhaus, and Marhaus smote him so hard that he brake his\nneck and the horse's back. That saw the other knight of the turret, and\ndressed him toward Marhaus, and they met so eagerly together that the\nknight of the turret was soon smitten down, horse and man, stark dead.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Marhaus jousted with Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine,\nand overthrew them both.\n\nAND then Sir Marhaus rode unto his shield, and saw how it was defouled,\nand said, Of this despite I am a part avenged, but for her love that\ngave me this white shield I shall wear thee, and hang mine where thou\nwast; and so he hanged it about his neck. Then he rode straight unto\nSir Gawaine and to Sir Uwaine, and asked them what they did there? They\nanswered him that they came from King Arthur's court to see adventures.\nWell, said Sir Marhaus, here am I ready, an adventurous knight that will\nfulfil any adventure that ye will desire; and so departed from them, to\nfetch his range. Let him go, said Sir Uwaine unto Sir Gawaine, for he is\na passing good knight as any is living; I would not by my will that\nany of us were matched with him. Nay, said Sir Gawaine, not so, it were\nshame to us were he not assayed, were he never so good a knight. Well,\nsaid Sir Uwaine, I will assay him afore you, for I am more weaker than\nye, and if he smite me down then may ye revenge me. So these two knights\ncame together with great raundon, that Sir Uwaine smote Sir Marhaus that\nhis spear brast in pieces on the shield, and Sir Marhaus smote him so\nsore that horse and man he bare to the earth, and hurt Sir Uwaine on the\nleft side.\n\nThen Sir Marhaus turned his horse and rode toward Gawaine with his\nspear, and when Sir Gawaine saw that he dressed his shield, and they\naventred their spears, and they came together with all the might of\ntheir horses, that either knight smote other so hard in midst of their\nshields, but Sir Gawaine's spear brake, but Sir Marhaus' spear held;\nand therewith Sir Gawaine and his horse rushed down to the earth. And\nlightly Sir Gawaine rose on his feet, and pulled out his sword, and\ndressed him toward Sir Marhaus on foot, and Sir Marhaus saw that, and\npulled out his sword and began to come to Sir Gawaine on horseback. Sir\nknight, said Sir Gawaine, alight on foot, or else I will slay thy horse.\nGramercy, said Sir Marhaus, of your gentleness ye teach me courtesy, for\nit is not for one knight to be on foot, and the other on horseback. And\ntherewith Sir Marhaus set his spear against a tree and alighted and tied\nhis horse to a tree, and dressed his shield, and either came unto other\neagerly, and smote together with their swords that their shields flew\nin cantels, and they bruised their helms and their hauberks, and wounded\neither other. But Sir Gawaine from it passed nine of the clock waxed\never stronger and stronger, for then it came to the hour of noon, and\nthrice his might was increased. All this espied Sir Marhaus and had\ngreat wonder how his might increased, and so they wounded other passing\nsore. And then when it was past noon, and when it drew toward evensong,\nSir Gawaine's strength feebled, and waxed passing faint that unnethes he\nmight dure any longer, and Sir Marhaus was then bigger and bigger. Sir\nknight, said Sir Marhaus, I have well felt that ye are a passing good\nknight and a marvellous man of might as ever I felt any, while it\nlasteth, and our quarrels are not great, and therefore it were pity to\ndo you hurt, for I feel ye are passing feeble. Ah, said Sir Gawaine,\ngentle knight, ye say the word that I should say. And therewith they\ntook off their helms, and either kissed other, and there they swore\ntogether either to love other as brethren. And Sir Marhaus prayed Sir\nGawaine to lodge with him that night. And so they took their horses, and\nrode toward Sir Marhaus' house. And as they rode by the way, Sir knight,\nsaid Sir Gawaine, I have marvel that so valiant a man as ye be love\nno ladies nor damosels. Sir, said Sir Marhaus, they name me wrongfully\nthose that give me that name, but well I wot it be the damosels of the\nturret that so name me, and other such as they be. Now shall I tell you\nfor what cause I hate them: for they be sorceresses and enchanters many\nof them, and be a knight never so good of his body and full of prowess\nas man may be, they will make him a stark coward to have the better of\nhim, and this is the principal cause that I hate them; and to all good\nladies and gentlewomen I owe my service as a knight ought to do.\n\nAs the book rehearseth in French, there were many knights that\novermatched Sir Gawaine, for all the thrice might that he had: Sir\nLauncelot de Lake, Sir Tristram, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Percivale,\nSir Pelleas, and Sir Marhaus, these six knights had the better of Sir\nGawaine. Then within a little while they came to Sir Marhaus' place,\nwhich was in a little priory, and there they alighted, and ladies and\ndamosels unarmed them, and hastily looked to their hurts, for they were\nall three hurt. And so they had all three good lodging with Sir Marhaus,\nand good cheer; for when he wist that they were King Arthur's sister's\nsons he made them all the cheer that lay in his power, and so they\nsojourned there a sennight, and were well eased of their wounds, and at\nthe last departed. Now, said Sir Marhaus, we will not depart so lightly,\nfor I will bring you through the forest; and rode day by day well a\nseven days or they found any adventure. At the last they came into a\ngreat forest, that was named the country and forest of Arroy, and the\ncountry of strange adventures. In this country, said Sir Marhaus, came\nnever knight since it was christened but he found strange adventures;\nand so they rode, and came into a deep valley full of stones, and\nthereby they saw a fair stream of water; above thereby was the head of\nthe stream a fair fountain, and three damosels sitting thereby. And\nthen they rode to them, and either saluted other, and the eldest had a\ngarland of gold about her head, and she was three score winter of age or\nmore, and her hair was white under the garland. The second damosel was\nof thirty winter of age, with a circlet of gold about her head. The\nthird damosel was but fifteen year of age, and a garland of flowers\nabout her head. When these knights had so beheld them, they asked them\nthe cause why they sat at that fountain? We be here, said the damosels,\nfor this cause: if we may see any errant knights, to teach them unto\nstrange adventures; and ye be three knights that seek adventures, and we\nbe three damosels, and therefore each one of you must choose one of us;\nand when ye have done so we will lead you unto three highways, and there\neach of you shall choose a way and his damosel with him. And this day\ntwelvemonth ye must meet here again, and God send you your lives, and\nthereto ye must plight your troth. This is well said, said Sir Marhaus.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. How Sir Marhaus, Sir Gawaine, and Sir Uwaine met three damosels, and\neach of them took one.[*1]\n\n[*1] Misnumbered xx. by Caxton.\n\n\nNOW shall everych of us choose a damosel. I shall tell you, said Sir\nUwaine, I am the youngest and most weakest of you both, therefore I will\nhave the eldest damosel, for she hath seen much, and can best help me\nwhen I have need, for I have most need of help of you both. Now, said\nSir Marhaus, I will have the damosel of thirty winter age, for she\nfalleth best to me. Well, said Sir Gawaine, I thank you, for ye have\nleft me the youngest and the fairest, and she is most liefest to me.\nThen every damosel took her knight by the reins of his bridle, and\nbrought him to the three ways, and there was their oath made to meet\nat the fountain that day twelvemonth an they were living, and so they\nkissed and departed, and each knight set his lady behind him. And Sir\nUwaine took the way that lay west, and Sir Marhaus took the way that lay\nsouth, and Sir Gawaine took the way that lay north. Now will we begin\nat Sir Gawaine, that held that way till that he came unto a fair manor,\nwhere dwelled an old knight and a good householder, and there Sir\nGawaine asked the knight if he knew any adventures in that country. I\nshall show you some to-morn, said the old knight, and that marvellous.\nSo, on the morn they rode into the forest of adventures to a laund, and\nthereby they found a cross, and as they stood and hoved there came by\nthem the fairest knight and the seemliest man that ever they saw,\nmaking the greatest dole that ever man made. And then he was ware of Sir\nGawaine, and saluted him, and prayed God to send him much worship. As\nto that, said Sir Gawaine, gramercy; also I pray to God that he send\nyou honour and worship. Ah, said the knight, I may lay that aside, for\nsorrow and shame cometh to me after worship.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. How a knight and a dwarf strove for a lady.\n\nAND therewith he passed unto the one side of the laund; and on the other\nside saw Sir Gawaine ten knights that hoved still and made them ready\nwith their shields and spears against that one knight that came by Sir\nGawaine.\n\nThen this one knight aventred a great spear, and one of the ten knights\nencountered with him, but this woful knight smote him so hard that he\nfell over his horse's tail. So this same dolorous knight served them\nall, that at the leastway he smote down horse and man, and all he did\nwith one spear; and so when they were all ten on foot, they went to that\none knight, and he stood stone still, and suffered them to pull him\ndown off his horse, and bound him hand and foot, and tied him under the\nhorse's belly, and so led him with them. O Jesu! said Sir Gawaine, this\nis a doleful sight, to see the yonder knight so to be entreated, and\nit seemeth by the knight that he suffereth them to bind him so, for he\nmaketh no resistance. No, said his host, that is truth, for an he would\nthey all were too weak so to do him. Sir, said the damosel unto Sir\nGawaine, meseemeth it were your worship to help that dolorous knight,\nfor methinketh he is one of the best knights that ever I saw. I would\ndo for him, said Sir Gawaine, but it seemeth he will have no help. Then,\nsaid the damosel, methinketh ye have no lust to help him.\n\nThus as they talked they saw a knight on the other side of the laund\nall armed save the head. And on the other side there came a dwarf on\nhorseback all armed save the head, with a great mouth and a short nose;\nand when the dwarf came nigh he said, Where is the lady should meet\nus here? and therewithal she came forth out of the wood. And then they\nbegan to strive for the lady; for the knight said he would have her,\nand the dwarf said he would have her. Will we do well? said the dwarf;\nyonder is a knight at the cross, let us put it both upon him, and as he\ndeemeth so shall it be. I will well, said the knight, and so they went\nall three unto Sir Gawaine and told him wherefore they strove. Well,\nsirs, said he, will ye put the matter in my hand? Yea, they said both.\nNow damosel, said Sir Gawaine, ye shall stand betwixt them both, and\nwhether ye list better to go to, he shall have you. And when she was set\nbetween them both, she left the knight and went to the dwarf, and the\ndwarf took her and went his way singing, and the knight went his way\nwith great mourning.\n\n\nThen came there two knights all armed, and cried on high, Sir Gawaine!\nknight of King Arthur's, make thee ready in all haste and joust with me.\nSo they ran together, that either fell down, and then on foot they drew\ntheir swords, and did full actually. The meanwhile the other knight went\nto the damosel, and asked her why she abode with that knight, and if ye\nwould abide with me, I will be your faithful knight. And with you will I\nbe, said the damosel, for with Sir Gawaine I may not find in mine heart\nto be with him; for now here was one knight discomfited ten knights, and\nat the last he was cowardly led away; and therefore let us two go whilst\nthey fight. And Sir Gawaine fought with that other knight long, but at\nthe last they accorded both. And then the knight prayed Sir Gawaine to\nlodge with him that night. So as Sir Gawaine went with this knight he\nasked him, What knight is he in this country that smote down the ten\nknights? For when he had done so manfully he suffered them to bind him\nhand and foot, and so led him away. Ah, said the knight, that is the\nbest knight I trow in the world, and the most man of prowess, and he\nhath been served so as he was even more than ten times, and his name\nhight Sir Pelleas, and he loveth a great lady in this country and her\nname is Ettard. And so when he loved her there was cried in this country\na great jousts three days, and all the knights of this country were\nthere and gentlewomen, and who that proved him the best knight should\nhave a passing good sword and a circlet of gold, and the circlet the\nknight should give it to the fairest lady that was at the jousts. And\nthis knight Sir Pelleas was the best knight that was there, and there\nwere five hundred knights, but there was never man that ever Sir Pelleas\nmet withal but he struck him down, or else from his horse; and every day\nof three days he struck down twenty knights, therefore they gave him the\nprize, and forthwithal he went thereas the Lady Ettard was, and gave her\nthe circlet, and said openly she was the fairest lady that there was,\nand that would he prove upon any knight that would say nay.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. How King Pelleas suffered himself to be taken prisoner\nbecause he would have a sight of his lady, and how Sir Gawaine promised\nhim to get to him the love of his lady.\n\nAND so he chose her for his sovereign lady, and never to love other but\nher, but she was so proud that she had scorn of him, and said that she\nwould never love him though he would die for her. Wherefore all ladies\nand gentlewomen had scorn of her that she was so proud, for there were\nfairer than she, and there was none that was there but an Sir Pelleas\nwould have proffered them love, they would have loved him for his noble\nprowess. And so this knight promised the Lady Ettard to follow her into\nthis country, and never to leave her till she loved him. And thus he is\nhere the most part nigh her, and lodged by a priory, and every week\nshe sendeth knights to fight with him. And when he hath put them to the\nworse, then will he suffer them wilfully to take him prisoner, because\nhe would have a sight of this lady. And always she doth him great\ndespite, for sometime she maketh her knights to tie him to his horse's\ntail, and some to bind him under the horse's belly; thus in the most\nshamefullest ways that she can think he is brought to her. And all she\ndoth it for to cause him to leave this country, and to leave his loving;\nbut all this cannot make him to leave, for an he would have fought on\nfoot he might have had the better of the ten knights as well on foot as\non horseback. Alas, said Sir Gawaine, it is great pity of him; and after\nthis night I will seek him to-morrow, in this forest, to do him all the\nhelp I can. So on the morn Sir Gawaine took his leave of his host Sir\nCarados, and rode into the forest; and at the last he met with Sir\nPelleas, making great moan out of measure, so each of them saluted\nother, and asked him why he made such sorrow. And as it is above\nrehearsed, Sir Pelleas told Sir Gawaine: But always I suffer her knights\nto fare so with me as ye saw yesterday, in trust at the last to win her\nlove, for she knoweth well all her knights should not lightly win me,\nan me list to fight with them to the uttermost. Wherefore an I loved her\nnot so sore, I had liefer die an hundred times, an I might die so oft,\nrather than I would suffer that despite; but I trust she will have pity\nupon me at the last, for love causeth many a good knight to suffer to\nhave his entent, but alas I am unfortunate. And therewith he made so\ngreat dole and sorrow that unnethe he might hold him on horseback.\n\nNow, said Sir Gawaine, leave your mourning and I shall promise you by\nthe faith of my body to do all that lieth in my power to get you the\nlove of your lady, and thereto I will plight you my troth. Ah, said Sir\nPelleas, of what court are ye? tell me, I pray you, my good friend.\nAnd then Sir Gawaine said, I am of the court of King Arthur, and his\nsister's son, and King Lot of Orkney was my father, and my name is Sir\nGawaine. And then he said, My name is Sir Pelleas, born in the Isles,\nand of many isles I am lord, and never have I loved lady nor damosel\ntill now in an unhappy time; and, sir knight, since ye are so nigh\ncousin unto King Arthur, and a king's son, therefore betray me not but\nhelp me, for I may never come by her but by some good knight, for she\nis in a strong castle here, fast by within this four mile, and over all\nthis country she is lady of. And so I may never come to her presence,\nbut as I suffer her knights to take me, and but if I did so that I might\nhave a sight of her, I had been dead long or this time; and yet fair\nword had I never of her, but when I am brought to-fore her she rebuketh\nme in the foulest manner. And then they take my horse and harness and\nput me out of the gates, and she will not suffer me to eat nor drink;\nand always I offer me to be her prisoner, but that she will not suffer\nme, for I would desire no more, what pains so ever I had, so that I\nmight have a sight of her daily. Well, said Sir Gawaine, all this shall\nI amend an ye will do as I shall devise: I will have your horse and\nyour armour, and so will I ride unto her castle and tell her that I have\nslain you, and so shall I come within her to cause her to cherish me,\nand then shall I do my true part that ye shall not fail to have the love\nof her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. How Sir Gawaine came to the Lady Ettard, and how Sir\nPelleas found them sleeping.\n\nAND therewith Sir Gawaine plight his troth unto Sir Pelleas to be true\nand faithful unto him; so each one plight their troth to other, and so\nthey changed horses and harness, and Sir Gawaine departed, and came to\nthe castle whereas stood the pavilions of this lady without the gate.\nAnd as soon as Ettard had espied Sir Gawaine she fled in toward the\ncastle. Sir Gawaine spake on high, and bade her abide, for he was not\nSir Pelleas; I am another knight that have slain Sir Pelleas. Do off\nyour helm, said the Lady Ettard, that I may see your visage. And so when\nshe saw that it was not Sir Pelleas, she bade him alight and led him\nunto her castle, and asked him faithfully whether he had slain Sir\nPelleas. And he said her yea, and told her his name was Sir Gawaine of\nthe court of King Arthur, and his sister's son. Truly, said she, that is\ngreat pity, for he was a passing good knight of his body, but of all\nmen alive I hated him most, for I could never be quit of him; and for\nye have slain him I shall be your woman, and to do anything that might\nplease you. So she made Sir Gawaine good cheer. Then Sir Gawaine said\nthat he loved a lady and by no means she would love him. She is to\nblame, said Ettard, an she will not love you, for ye that be so well\nborn a man, and such a man of prowess, there is no lady in the world too\ngood for you. Will ye, said Sir Gawaine, promise me to do all that ye\nmay, by the faith of your body, to get me the love of my lady? Yea, sir,\nsaid she, and that I promise you by the faith of my body. Now, said Sir\nGawaine, it is yourself that I love so well, therefore I pray you hold\nyour promise. I may not choose, said the Lady Ettard, but if I should be\nforsworn; and so she granted him to fulfil all his desire.\n\nSo it was then in the month of May that she and Sir Gawaine went out of\nthe castle and supped in a pavilion, and there was made a bed, and there\nSir Gawaine and the Lady Ettard went to bed together, and in another\npavilion she laid her damosels, and in the third pavilion she laid part\nof her knights, for then she had no dread of Sir Pelleas. And there Sir\nGawaine lay with her in that pavilion two days and two nights. And on\nthe third day, in the morning early, Sir Pelleas armed him, for he had\nnever slept since Sir Gawaine departed from him; for Sir Gawaine had\npromised him by the faith of his body, to come to him unto his pavilion\nby that priory within the space of a day and a night.\n\nThen Sir Pelleas mounted upon horseback, and came to the pavilions that\nstood without the castle, and found in the first pavilion three knights\nin three beds, and three squires lying at their feet. Then went he to\nthe second pavilion and found four gentlewomen lying in four beds. And\nthen he yede to the third pavilion and found Sir Gawaine lying in bed\nwith his Lady Ettard, and either clipping other in arms, and when he saw\nthat his heart well-nigh brast for sorrow, and said: Alas! that ever a\nknight should be found so false; and then he took his horse and might\nnot abide no longer for pure sorrow. And when he had ridden nigh half a\nmile he turned again and thought to slay them both; and when he saw them\nboth so lie sleeping fast, unnethe he might hold him on horseback for\nsorrow, and said thus to himself, Though this knight be never so false,\nI will never slay him sleeping, for I will never destroy the high order\nof knighthood; and therewith he departed again. And or he had ridden\nhalf a mile he returned again, and thought then to slay them both,\nmaking the greatest sorrow that ever man made. And when he came to the\npavilions, he tied his horse unto a tree, and pulled out his sword naked\nin his hand, and went to them thereas they lay, and yet he thought it\nwere shame to slay them sleeping, and laid the naked sword overthwart\nboth their throats, and so took his horse and rode his way.\n\nAnd when Sir Pelleas came to his pavilions he told his knights and his\nsquires how he had sped, and said thus to them, For your true and good\nservice ye have done me I shall give you all my goods, for I will go\nunto my bed and never arise until I am dead. And when that I am dead I\ncharge you that ye take the heart out of my body and bear it her betwixt\ntwo silver dishes, and tell her how I saw her lie with the false knight\nSir Gawaine. Right so Sir Pelleas unarmed himself, and went unto his bed\nmaking marvellous dole and sorrow.\n\nWhen Sir Gawaine and Ettard awoke of their sleep, and found the naked\nsword overthwart their throats, then she knew well it was Sir Pelleas'\nsword. Alas! said she to Sir Gawaine, ye have betrayed me and Sir\nPelleas both, for ye told me ye had slain him, and now I know well it is\nnot so, he is alive. And if Sir Pelleas had been as uncourteous to you\nas ye have been to him ye had been a dead knight; but ye have deceived\nme and betrayed me falsely, that all ladies and damosels may beware by\nyou and me. And therewith Sir Gawaine made him ready, and went into the\nforest. So it happed then that the Damosel of the Lake, Nimue, met with\na knight of Sir Pelleas, that went on his foot in the forest making\ngreat dole, and she asked him the cause. And so the woful knight told\nher how his master and lord was betrayed through a knight and lady, and\nhow he will never arise out of his bed till he be dead. Bring me to him,\nsaid she anon, and I will warrant his life he shall not die for love,\nand she that hath caused him so to love, she shall be in as evil plight\nas he is or it be long to, for it is no joy of such a proud lady that\nwill have no mercy of such a valiant knight. Anon that knight brought\nher unto him, and when she saw him lie in his bed, she thought she saw\nnever so likely a knight; and therewith she threw an enchantment upon\nhim, and he fell asleep. And therewhile she rode unto the Lady Ettard,\nand charged no man to awake him till she came again. So within two hours\nshe brought the Lady Ettard thither, and both ladies found him asleep:\nLo, said the Damosel of the Lake, ye ought to be ashamed for to murder\nsuch a knight. And therewith she threw such an enchantment upon her that\nshe loved him sore, that well-nigh she was out of her mind. O Lord Jesu,\nsaid the Lady Ettard, how is it befallen unto me that I love now him\nthat I have most hated of any man alive? That is the righteous judgment\nof God, said the damosel. And then anon Sir Pelleas awaked and looked\nupon Ettard; and when he saw her he knew her, and then he hated her more\nthan any woman alive, and said: Away, traitress, come never in my sight.\nAnd when she heard him say so, she wept and made great sorrow out of\nmeasure.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Pelleas loved no more Ettard by means of the\nDamosel of the Lake, whom he loved ever after.\n\nSIR KNIGHT PELLEAS, said the Damosel of the Lake, take your horse and\ncome forth with me out of this country, and ye shall love a lady that\nshall love you. I will well, said Sir Pelleas, for this Lady Ettard hath\ndone me great despite and shame, and there he told her the beginning and\nending, and how he had purposed never to have arisen till that he had\nbeen dead. And now such grace God hath sent me, that I hate her as\nmuch as ever I loved her, thanked be our Lord Jesus! Thank me, said the\nDamosel of the Lake. Anon Sir Pelleas armed him, and took his horse, and\ncommanded his men to bring after his pavilions and his stuff where the\nDamosel of the Lake would assign. So the Lady Ettard died for sorrow,\nand the Damosel of the Lake rejoiced Sir Pelleas, and loved together\nduring their life days.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Marhaus rode with the damosel, and how he came to\nthe Duke of the South Marches.\n\nNOW turn we unto Sir Marhaus, that rode with the damosel of thirty\nwinter of age, southward. And so they came into a deep forest, and by\nfortune they were nighted, and rode long in a deep way, and at the last\nthey came unto a courtelage, and there they asked harbour. But the man\nof the courtelage would not lodge them for no treatise that they could\ntreat, but thus much the good man said, An ye will take the adventure of\nyour lodging, I shall bring you where ye shall be lodged. What adventure\nis that that I shall have for my lodging? said Sir Marhaus. Ye shall\nwit when ye come there, said the good man. Sir, what adventure so it\nbe, bring me thither I pray thee, said Sir Marhaus; for I am weary, my\ndamosel, and my horse. So the good man went and opened the gate, and\nwithin an hour he brought him unto a fair castle, and then the poor man\ncalled the porter, and anon he was let into the castle, and so he told\nthe lord how he brought him a knight errant and a damosel that would\nbe lodged with him. Let him in, said the lord, it may happen he shall\nrepent that they took their lodging here.\n\nSo Sir Marhaus was let in with torchlight, and there was a goodly sight\nof young men that welcomed him. And then his horse was led into the\nstable, and he and the damosel were brought into the hall, and there\nstood a mighty duke and many goodly men about him. Then this lord asked\nhim what he hight, and from whence he came, and with whom he dwelt. Sir,\nhe said, I am a knight of King Arthur's and knight of the Table Round,\nand my name is Sir Marhaus, and born I am in Ireland. And then said the\nduke to him, That me sore repenteth: the cause is this, for I love not\nthy lord nor none of thy fellows of the Table Round; and therefore ease\nthyself this night as well as thou mayest, for as to-morn I and my six\nsons shall match with you. Is there no remedy but that I must have ado\nwith you and your six sons at once? said Sir Marhaus. No, said the duke,\nfor this cause I made mine avow, for Sir Gawaine slew my seven sons in a\nrecounter, therefore I made mine avow, there should never knight of King\nArthur's court lodge with me, or come thereas I might have ado with him,\nbut that I would have a revenging of my sons' death. What is your name?\nsaid Sir Marhaus; I require you tell me, an it please you. Wit thou well\nI am the Duke of South Marches. Ah, said Sir Marhaus, I have heard say\nthat ye have been long time a great foe unto my lord Arthur and to his\nknights. That shall ye feel to-morn, said the duke. Shall I have ado\nwith you? said Sir Marhaus. Yea, said the duke, thereof shalt thou not\nchoose, and therefore take you to your chamber, and ye shall have all\nthat to you longeth. So Sir Marhaus departed and was led to a chamber,\nand his damosel was led unto her chamber. And on the morn the duke sent\nunto Sir Marhaus and bade make him ready. And so Sir Marhaus arose and\narmed him, and then there was a mass sung afore him, and brake his fast,\nand so mounted on horseback in the court of the castle where they should\ndo the battle. So there was the duke all ready on horseback, clean\narmed, and his six sons by him, and everych had a spear in his hand,\nand so they encountered, whereas the duke and his two sons brake their\nspears upon him, but Sir Marhaus held up his spear and touched none of\nthem.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. How Sir Marhaus fought with the duke and his four sons and\nmade them to yield them.\n\nTHEN came the four sons by couple, and two of them brake their spears,\nand so did the other two. And all this while Sir Marhaus touched them\nnot. Then Sir Marhaus ran to the duke, and smote him with his spear that\nhorse and man fell to the earth, and so he served his sons; and then Sir\nMarhaus alighted down and bade the duke yield him or else he would slay\nhim. And then some of his sons recovered, and would have set upon Sir\nMarhaus; then Sir Marhaus said to the duke, Cease thy sons, or else I\nwill do the uttermost to you all. Then the duke saw he might not escape\nthe death, he cried to his sons, and charged them to yield them to Sir\nMarhaus; and they kneeled all down and put the pommels of their swords\nto the knight, and so he received them. And then they helped up their\nfather, and so by their cominal assent promised to Sir Marhaus never to\nbe foes unto King Arthur, and thereupon at Whitsuntide after to come, he\nand his sons, and put them in the king's grace.\n\nThen Sir Marhaus departed, and within two days his damosel brought him\nwhereas was a great tournament that the Lady de Vawse had cried. And\nwho that did best should have a rich circlet of gold worth a thousand\nbesants. And there Sir Marhaus did so nobly that he was renowned, and\nhad sometime down forty knights, and so the circlet of gold was rewarded\nhim. Then he departed from them with great worship; and so within seven\nnights his damosel brought him to an earl's place, his name was the Earl\nFergus, that after was Sir Tristram's knight; and this earl was but a\nyoung man, and late come into his lands, and there was a giant fast\nby him that hight Taulurd, and he had another brother in Cornwall that\nhight Taulas, that Sir Tristram slew when he was out of his mind. So\nthis earl made his complaint unto Sir Marhaus, that there was a giant by\nhim that destroyed all his lands, and how he durst nowhere ride nor go\nfor him. Sir, said the knight, whether useth he to fight on horseback or\non foot? Nay, said the earl, there may no horse bear him. Well, said Sir\nMarhaus, then will I fight with him on foot; so on the morn Sir Marhaus\nprayed the earl that one of his men might bring him whereas the giant\nwas; and so he was, for he saw him sit under a tree of holly, and many\nclubs of iron and gisarms about him. So this knight dressed him to the\ngiant, putting his shield afore him, and the giant took an iron club in\nhis hand, and at the first stroke he clave Sir Marhaus' shield in\ntwo pieces. And there he was in great peril, for the giant was a wily\nfighter, but at last Sir Marhaus smote off his right arm above the\nelbow.\n\nThen the giant fled and the knight after him, and so he drove him into\na water, but the giant was so high that he might not wade after him. And\nthen Sir Marhaus made the Earl Fergus' man to fetch him stones, and with\nthose stones the knight gave the giant many sore knocks, till at the\nlast he made him fall down into the water, and so was he there dead.\nThen Sir Marhaus went unto the giant's castle, and there he delivered\ntwenty-four ladies and twelve knights out of the giant's prison, and\nthere he had great riches without number, so that the days of his life\nhe was never poor man. Then he returned to the Earl Fergus, the which\nthanked him greatly, and would have given him half his lands, but he\nwould none take. So Sir Marhaus dwelled with the earl nigh half a year,\nfor he was sore bruised with the giant, and at the last he took his\nleave. And as he rode by the way, he met with Sir Gawaine and Sir\nUwaine, and so by adventure he met with four knights of Arthur's court,\nthe first was Sir Sagramore le Desirous, Sir Osanna, Sir Dodinas le\nSavage, and Sir Felot of Listinoise; and there Sir Marhaus with one\nspear smote down these four knights, and hurt them sore. So he departed\nto meet at his day aforeset.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. How Sir Uwaine rode with the damosel of sixty year of age,\nand how he gat the prize at tourneying.\n\nNOW turn we unto Sir Uwaine, that rode westward with his damosel of\nthree score winter of age, and she brought him thereas was a tournament\nnigh the march of Wales. And at that tournament Sir Uwaine smote down\nthirty knights, therefore was given him the prize, and that was a\ngerfalcon, and a white steed trapped with cloth of gold. So then Sir\nUwaine did many strange adventures by the means of the old damosel, and\nso she brought him to a lady that was called the Lady of the Rock, the\nwhich was much courteous. So there were in the country two knights that\nwere brethren, and they were called two perilous knights, the one knight\nhight Sir Edward of the Red Castle, and the other Sir Hue of the Red\nCastle; and these two brethren had disherited the Lady of the Rock of a\nbarony of lands by their extortion. And as this knight was lodged with\nthis lady she made her complaint to him of these two knights.\n\nMadam, said Sir Uwaine, they are to blame, for they do against the high\norder of knighthood, and the oath that they made; and if it like you I\nwill speak with them, because I am a knight of King Arthur's, and I will\nentreat them with fairness; and if they will not, I shall do battle\nwith them, and in the defence of your right. Gramercy said the lady, and\nthereas I may not acquit you, God shall. So on the morn the two knights\nwere sent for, that they should come thither to speak with the Lady of\nthe Rock, and wit ye well they failed not, for they came with an hundred\nhorse. But when this lady saw them in this manner so big, she would\nnot suffer Sir Uwaine to go out to them upon no surety nor for no fair\nlanguage, but she made him speak with them over a tower, but finally\nthese two brethren would not be entreated, and answered that they would\nkeep that they had. Well, said Sir Uwaine, then will I fight with one of\nyou, and prove that ye do this lady wrong. That will we not, said they,\nfor an we do battle, we two will fight with one knight at once, and\ntherefore if ye will fight so, we will be ready at what hour ye will\nassign. And if ye win us in battle the lady shall have her lands again.\nYe say well, said Sir Uwaine, therefore make you ready so that ye be\nhere to-morn in the defence of the lady's right.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. How Sir Uwaine fought with two knights and overcame them.\n\nSO was there sikerness made on both parties that no treason should be\nwrought on neither party; so then the knights departed and made them\nready, and that night Sir Uwaine had great cheer. And on the morn he\narose early and heard mass, and brake his fast, and so he rode unto the\nplain without the gates, where hoved the two brethren abiding him. So\nthey rode together passing sore, that Sir Edward and Sir Hue brake their\nspears upon Sir Uwaine. And Sir Uwaine smote Sir Edward that he fell\nover his horse and yet his spear brast not. And then he spurred his\nhorse and came upon Sir Hue and overthrew him, but they soon recovered\nand dressed their shields and drew their swords and bade Sir Uwaine\nalight and do his battle to the uttermost. Then Sir Uwaine devoided his\nhorse suddenly, and put his shield afore him and drew his sword, and\nso they dressed together, and either gave other such strokes, and there\nthese two brethren wounded Sir Uwaine passing grievously that the Lady\nof the Rock weened he should have died. And thus they fought together\nfive hours as men raged out of reason. And at the last Sir Uwaine smote\nSir Edward upon the helm such a stroke that his sword carved unto his\ncanel bone, and then Sir Hue abated his courage, but Sir Uwaine pressed\nfast to have slain him. That saw Sir Hue: he kneeled down and yielded\nhim to Sir Uwaine. And he of his gentleness received his sword, and took\nhim by the hand, and went into the castle together. Then the Lady of the\nRock was passing glad, and the other brother made great sorrow for his\nbrother's death. Then the lady was restored of all her lands, and Sir\nHue was commanded to be at the court of King Arthur at the next feast\nof Pentecost. So Sir Uwaine dwelt with the lady nigh half a year, for\nit was long or he might be whole of his great hurts. And so when it drew\nnigh the term-day that Sir Gawaine, Sir Marhaus, and Sir Uwaine should\nmeet at the cross-way, then every knight drew him thither to hold his\npromise that they had made; and Sir Marhaus and Sir Uwaine brought their\ndamosels with them, but Sir Gawaine had lost his damosel, as it is afore\nrehearsed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. How at the year's end all three knights with their three\ndamosels met at the fountain.\n\nRIGHT so at the twelvemonths' end they met all three knights at the\nfountain and their damosels, but the damosel that Sir Gawaine had could\nsay but little worship of him so they departed from the damosels and\nrode through a great forest, and there they met with a messenger that\ncame from King Arthur, that had sought them well-nigh a twelvemonth\nthroughout all England, Wales, and Scotland, and charged if ever he\nmight find Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine to bring them to the court again.\nAnd then were they all glad, and so prayed they Sir Marhaus to ride\nwith them to the king's court. And so within twelve days they came to\nCamelot, and the king was passing glad of their coming, and so was all\nthe court. Then the king made them to swear upon a book to tell him all\ntheir adventures that had befallen them that twelvemonth, and so they\ndid. And there was Sir Marhaus well known, for there were knights that\nhe had matched aforetime, and he was named one of the best knights\nliving.\n\nAgainst the feast of Pentecost came the Damosel of the Lake and brought\nwith her Sir Pelleas; and at that high feast there was great jousting\nof knights, and of all knights that were at that jousts, Sir Pelleas had\nthe prize, and Sir Marhaus was named the next; but Sir Pelleas was so\nstrong there might but few knights sit him a buffet with a spear. And\nat that next feast Sir Pelleas and Sir Marhaus were made knights of the\nTable Round, for there were two sieges void, for two knights were slain\nthat twelvemonth, and great joy had King Arthur of Sir Pelleas and of\nSir Marhaus. But Pelleas loved never after Sir Gawaine, but as he spared\nhim for the love of King Arthur; but ofttimes at jousts and tournaments\nSir Pelleas quit Sir Gawaine, for so it rehearseth in the book of\nFrench. So Sir Tristram many days after fought with Sir Marhaus in an\nisland, and there they did a great battle, but at the last Sir Tristram\nslew him, so Sir Tristram was wounded that unnethe he might recover, and\nlay at a nunnery half a year. And Sir Pelleas was a worshipful knight,\nand was one of the four that achieved the Sangreal, and the Damosel of\nthe Lake made by her means that never he had ado with Sir Launcelot de\nLake, for where Sir Launcelot was at any jousts or any tournament, she\nwould not suffer him be there that day, but if it were on the side of\nSir Launcelot.\n\nExplicit liber quartus. Incipit liber quintus.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK V.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How twelve aged ambassadors of Rome came to King Arthur to\ndemand truage for Britain.\n\nWHEN King Arthur had after long war rested, and held a royal feast and\nTable Round with his allies of kings, princes, and noble knights all\nof the Round Table, there came into his hall, he sitting in his throne\nroyal, twelve ancient men, bearing each of them a branch of olive, in\ntoken that they came as ambassadors and messengers from the Emperor\nLucius, which was called at that time, Dictator or Procuror of the\nPublic Weal of Rome. Which said messengers, after their entering and\ncoming into the presence of King Arthur, did to him their obeisance\nin making to him reverence, and said to him in this wise: The high\nand mighty Emperor Lucius sendeth to the King of Britain greeting,\ncommanding thee to acknowledge him for thy lord, and to send him the\ntruage due of this realm unto the Empire, which thy father and other\nto-fore thy precessors have paid as is of record, and thou as rebel not\nknowing him as thy sovereign, withholdest and retainest contrary to\nthe statutes and decrees made by the noble and worthy Julius Cesar,\nconqueror of this realm, and first Emperor of Rome. And if thou refuse\nhis demand and commandment know thou for certain that he shall make\nstrong war against thee, thy realms and lands, and shall chastise thee\nand thy subjects, that it shall be ensample perpetual unto all kings and\nprinces, for to deny their truage unto that noble empire which domineth\nupon the universal world. Then when they had showed the effect of their\nmessage, the king commanded them to withdraw them, and said he should\ntake advice of council and give to them an answer. Then some of the\nyoung knights, hearing this their message, would have run on them to\nhave slain them, saying that it was a rebuke to all the knights there\nbeing present to suffer them to say so to the king. And anon the king\ncommanded that none of them, upon pain of death, to missay them nor do\nthem any harm, and commanded a knight to bring them to their lodging,\nand see that they have all that is necessary and requisite for them,\nwith the best cheer, and that no dainty be spared, for the Romans be\ngreat lords, and though their message please me not nor my court, yet I\nmust remember mine honour.\n\nAfter this the king let call all his lords and knights of the Round\nTable to counsel upon this matter, and desired them to say their advice.\nThen Sir Cador of Cornwall spake first and said, Sir, this message\nliketh me well, for we have many days rested us and have been idle, and\nnow I hope ye shall make sharp war on the Romans, where I doubt not we\nshall get honour. I believe well, said Arthur, that this matter pleaseth\nthee well, but these answers may not be answered, for the demand\ngrieveth me sore, for truly I will never pay truage to Rome, wherefore\nI pray you to counsel me. I have understood that Belinus and Brenius,\nkings of Britain, have had the empire in their hands many days, and also\nConstantine the son of Heleine, which is an open evidence that we owe no\ntribute to Rome but of right we that be descended of them have right to\nclaim the title of the empire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How the kings and lords promised to King Arthur aid and help\nagainst the Romans.\n\nTHEN answered King Anguish of Scotland, Sir, ye ought of right to\nbe above all other kings, for unto you is none like nor pareil in\nChristendom, of knighthood nor of dignity, and I counsel you never to\nobey the Romans, for when they reigned on us they distressed our elders,\nand put this land to great extortions and tallies, wherefore I make here\nmine avow to avenge me on them; and for to strengthen your quarrel\nI shall furnish twenty thousand good men of war, and wage them on my\ncosts, which shall await on you with myself when it shall please you.\nAnd the king of Little Britain granted him to the same thirty thousand;\nwherefore King Arthur thanked them. And then every man agreed to make\nwar, and to aid after their power; that is to wit, the lord of West\nWales promised to bring thirty thousand men, and Sir Uwaine, Sir Ider\nhis son, with their cousins, promised to bring thirty thousand. Then\nSir Launcelot with all other promised in likewise every man a great\nmultitude.\n\nAnd when King Arthur understood their courages and good wills he thanked\nthem heartily, and after let call the ambassadors to hear their answer.\nAnd in presence of all his lords and knights he said to them in this\nwise: I will that ye return unto your lord and Procuror of the Common\nWeal for the Romans, and say ye to him, Of his demand and commandment I\nset nothing, and that I know of no truage nor tribute that I owe to him,\nnor to none earthly prince, Christian nor heathen; but I pretend to have\nand occupy the sovereignty of the empire, wherein I am entitled by the\nright of my predecessors, sometime kings of this land; and say to him\nthat I am delibered and fully concluded, to go with mine army with\nstrength and power unto Rome, by the grace of God, to take possession\nin the empire and subdue them that be rebel. Wherefore I command him and\nall them of Rome, that incontinent they make to me their homage, and\nto acknowledge me for their Emperor and Governor, upon pain that shall\nensue. And then he commanded his treasurer to give to them great and\nlarge gifts, and to pay all their dispenses, and assigned Sir Cador to\nconvey them out of the land. And so they took their leave and departed,\nand took their shipping at Sandwich, and passed forth by Flanders,\nAlmaine, the mountains, and all Italy, until they came unto Lucius. And\nafter the reverence made, they made relation of their answer, like as ye\nto-fore have heard.\n\nWhen the Emperor Lucius had well understood their credence, he was sore\nmoved as he had been all araged, and said, I had supposed that Arthur\nwould have obeyed to my commandment, and have served you himself, as him\nwell beseemed or any other king to do. O Sir, said one of the senators,\nlet be such vain words, for we let you wit that I and my fellows were\nfull sore afeard to behold his countenance; I fear me ye have made a rod\nfor yourself, for he intendeth to be lord of this empire, which sore is\nto be doubted if he come, for he is all another man than ye ween, and\nholdeth the most noble court of the world, all other kings nor princes\nmay not compare unto his noble maintenance. On New Year's Day we saw\nhim in his estate, which was the royalest that ever we saw, for he was\nserved at his table with nine kings, and the noblest fellowship of\nother princes, lords, and knights that be in the world, and every knight\napproved and like a lord, and holdeth Table Round: and in his person the\nmost manly man that liveth, and is like to conquer all the world, for\nunto his courage it is too little: wherefore I advise you to keep well\nyour marches and straits in the mountains; for certainly he is a lord\nto be doubted. Well, said Lucius, before Easter I suppose to pass the\nmountains, and so forth into France, and there bereave him his lands\nwith Genoese and other mighty warriors of Tuscany and Lombardy. And I\nshall send for them all that be subjects and allied to the empire of\nRome to come to mine aid. And forthwith sent old wise knights unto\nthese countries following: first to Ambage and Arrage, to Alexandria, to\nIndia, to Armenia, whereas the river of Euphrates runneth into Asia, to\nAfrica, and Europe the Large, to Ertayne and Elamye, to Araby, Egypt,\nand to Damascus, to Damietta and Cayer, to Cappadocia, to Tarsus,\nTurkey, Pontus and Pamphylia, to Syria and Galatia. And all these were\nsubject to Rome and many more, as Greece, Cyprus, Macedonia, Calabria,\nCateland, Portugal, with many thousands of Spaniards. Thus all these\nkings, dukes, and admirals, assembled about Rome, with sixteen kings at\nonce, with great multitude of people. When the emperor understood their\ncoming he made ready his Romans and all the people between him and\nFlanders.\n\nAlso he had gotten with him fifty giants which had been engendered of\nfiends; and they were ordained to guard his person, and to break the\nfront of the battle of King Arthur. And thus departed from Rome,\nand came down the mountains for to destroy the lands that Arthur had\nconquered, and came unto Cologne, and besieged a castle thereby, and won\nit soon, and stuffed it with two hundred Saracens or Infidels, and after\ndestroyed many fair countries which Arthur had won of King Claudas. And\nthus Lucius came with all his host, which were disperplyd sixty mile\nin breadth, and commanded them to meet with him in Burgoyne, for he\npurposed to destroy the realm of Little Britain.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How King Arthur held a parliament at York, and how he\nordained the realm should be governed in his absence.\n\nNOW leave we of Lucius the Emperor and speak we of King Arthur, that\ncommanded all them of his retinue to be ready at the utas of Hilary for\nto hold a parliament at York. And at that parliament was concluded to\narrest all the navy of the land, and to be ready within fifteen days at\nSandwich, and there he showed to his army how he purposed to conquer\nthe empire which he ought to have of right. And there he ordained two\ngovernors of this realm, that is to say, Sir Baudwin of Britain, for to\ncounsel to the best, and Sir Constantine, son to Sir Cador of Cornwall,\nwhich after the death of Arthur was king of this realm. And in the\npresence of all his lords he resigned the rule of the realm and Guenever\nhis queen to them, wherefore Sir Launcelot was wroth, for he left Sir\nTristram with King Mark for the love of Beale Isould. Then the Queen\nGuenever made great sorrow for the departing of her lord and other, and\nswooned in such wise that the ladies bare her into her chamber. Thus the\nking with his great army departed, leaving the queen and realm in the\ngovernance of Sir Baudwin and Constantine. And when he was on his horse\nhe said with an high voice, If I die in this journey I will that Sir\nConstantine be mine heir and king crowned of this realm as next of my\nblood. And after departed and entered into the sea at Sandwich with all\nhis army, with a great multitude of ships, galleys, cogs, and dromounds,\nsailing on the sea.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How King Arthur being shipped and lying in his cabin had a\nmarvellous dream and of the exposition thereof.\n\nAND as the king lay in his cabin in the ship, he fell in a slumbering\nand dreamed a marvellous dream: him seemed that a dreadful dragon did\ndrown much of his people, and he came flying out of the west, and his\nhead was enamelled with azure, and his shoulders shone as gold, his\nbelly like mails of a marvellous hue, his tail full of tatters, his feet\nfull of fine sable, and his claws like fine gold; and an hideous flame\nof fire flew out of his mouth, like as the land and water had flamed all\nof fire. After, him seemed there came out of the orient, a grimly boar\nall black in a cloud, and his paws as big as a post; he was rugged\nlooking roughly, he was the foulest beast that ever man saw, he roared\nand romed so hideously that it were marvel to hear. Then the dreadful\ndragon advanced him and came in the wind like a falcon giving great\nstrokes on the boar, and the boar hit him again with his grizzly tusks\nthat his breast was all bloody, and that the hot blood made all the sea\nred of his blood. Then the dragon flew away all on an height, and came\ndown with such a swough, and smote the boar on the ridge, which was ten\nfoot large from the head to the tail, and smote the boar all to powder\nboth flesh and bones, that it flittered all abroad on the sea.\n\nAnd therewith the king awoke anon, and was sore abashed of this dream,\nand sent anon for a wise philosopher, commanding to tell him the\nsignification of his dream. Sir, said the philosopher, the dragon that\nthou dreamedst of betokeneth thine own person that sailest here, and\nthe colours of his wings be thy realms that thou hast won, and his\ntail which is all to-tattered signifieth the noble knights of the\nRound Table; and the boar that the dragon slew coming from the clouds\nbetokeneth some tyrant that tormenteth the people, or else thou art like\nto fight with some giant thyself, being horrible and abominable, whose\npeer ye saw never in your days, wherefore of this dreadful dream doubt\nthee nothing, but as a conqueror come forth thyself.\n\nThen after this soon they had sight of land, and sailed till they\narrived at Barflete in Flanders, and when they were there he found many\nof his great lords ready, as they had been commanded to wait upon him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How a man of the country told to him of a marvellous giant,\nand how he fought and conquered him.\n\nTHEN came to him an husbandman of the country, and told him how there\nwas in the country of Constantine beside Brittany, a great giant which\nhad slain, murdered and devoured much people of the country, and had\nbeen sustained seven year with the children of the commons of that land,\ninsomuch that all the children be all slain and destroyed; and now late\nhe hath taken the Duchess of Brittany as she rode with her meiny, and\nhath led her to his lodging which is in a mountain, for to ravish and\nlie by her to her life's end, and many people followed her, more than\nfive hundred, but all they might not rescue her, but they left her\nshrieking and crying lamentably, wherefore I suppose that he hath slain\nher in fulfilling his foul lust of lechery. She was wife unto thy cousin\nSir Howell, whom we call full nigh of thy blood. Now, as thou art a\nrightful king, have pity on this lady, and revenge us all as thou art a\nnoble conqueror. Alas, said King Arthur, this is a great mischief, I\nhad liefer than the best realm that I have that I had been a furlong\nway to-fore him for to have rescued that lady. Now, fellow, said King\nArthur, canst thou bring me thereas this giant haunteth? Yea, Sir, said\nthe good man, look yonder whereas thou seest those two great fires,\nthere shalt thou find him, and more treasure than I suppose is in all\nFrance. When the king had understood this piteous case, he returned into\nhis tent.\n\nThen he called to him Sir Kay and Sir Bedivere, and commanded them\nsecretly to make ready horse and harness for himself and them twain; for\nafter evensong he would ride on pilgrimage with them two only unto Saint\nMichael's mount. And then anon he made him ready, and armed him at all\npoints, and took his horse and his shield. And so they three departed\nthence and rode forth as fast as ever they might till that they came\nto the foreland of that mount. And there they alighted, and the king\ncommanded them to tarry there, for he would himself go up into that\nmount. And so he ascended up into that hill till he came to a great\nfire, and there he found a careful widow wringing her hands and making\ngreat sorrow, sitting by a grave new made. And then King Arthur saluted\nher, and demanded of her wherefore she made such lamentation, to whom\nshe answered and said, Sir knight, speak soft, for yonder is a devil, if\nhe hear thee speak he will come and destroy thee; I hold thee unhappy;\nwhat dost thou here in this mountain? for if ye were such fifty as ye\nbe, ye were not able to make resistance against this devil: here lieth\na duchess dead, the which was the fairest of all the world, wife to Sir\nHowell, Duke of Brittany, he hath murdered her in forcing her, and hath\nslit her unto the navel.\n\nDame, said the king, I come from the noble conqueror King Arthur, for to\ntreat with that tyrant for his liege people. Fie on such treaties, said\nshe, he setteth not by the king nor by no man else; but an if thou have\nbrought Arthur's wife, dame Guenever, he shall be gladder than thou\nhadst given to him half France. Beware, approach him not too nigh,\nfor he hath vanquished fifteen kings, and hath made him a coat full of\nprecious stones embroidered with their beards, which they sent him to\nhave his love for salvation of their people at this last Christmas. And\nif thou wilt, speak with him at yonder great fire at supper. Well, said\nArthur, I will accomplish my message for all your fearful words; and\nwent forth by the crest of that hill, and saw where he sat at supper\ngnawing on a limb of a man, baking his broad limbs by the fire, and\nbreechless, and three fair damosels turning three broaches whereon were\nbroached twelve young children late born, like young birds.\n\nWhen King Arthur beheld that piteous sight he had great compassion on\nthem, so that his heart bled for sorrow, and hailed him, saying in this\nwise: He that all the world wieldeth give thee short life and shameful\ndeath; and the devil have thy soul; why hast thou murdered these young\ninnocent children, and murdered this duchess? Therefore, arise and dress\nthee, thou glutton, for this day shalt thou die of my hand. Then the\nglutton anon started up, and took a great club in his hand, and smote at\nthe king that his coronal fell to the earth. And the king hit him again\nthat he carved his belly and cut off his genitours, that his guts and\nhis entrails fell down to the ground. Then the giant threw away his\nclub, and caught the king in his arms that he crushed his ribs. Then the\nthree maidens kneeled down and called to Christ for help and comfort\nof Arthur. And then Arthur weltered and wrung, that he was other while\nunder and another time above. And so weltering and wallowing they\nrolled down the hill till they came to the sea mark, and ever as they so\nweltered Arthur smote him with his dagger.\n\nAnd it fortuned they came to the place whereas the two knights were and\nkept Arthur's horse; then when they saw the king fast in the giant's\narms they came and loosed him. And then the king commanded Sir Kay to\nsmite off the giant's head, and to set it upon a truncheon of a spear,\nand bear it to Sir Howell, and tell him that his enemy was slain; and\nafter let this head be bound to a barbican that all the people may see\nand behold it; and go ye two up to the mountain, and fetch me my shield,\nmy sword, and the club of iron; and as for the treasure, take ye it, for\nye shall find there goods out of number; so I have the kirtle and the\nclub I desire no more. This was the fiercest giant that ever I met with,\nsave one in the mount of Araby, which I overcame, but this was greater\nand fiercer. Then the knights fetched the club and the kirtle, and some\nof the treasure they took to themselves, and returned again to the host.\nAnd anon this was known through all the country, wherefore the people\ncame and thanked the king. And he said again, Give the thanks to God,\nand depart the goods among you.\n\nAnd after that King Arthur said and commanded his cousin Howell, that he\nshould ordain for a church to be builded on the same hill in the worship\nof Saint Michael. And on the morn the king removed with his great\nbattle, and came into Champayne and in a valley, and there they pight\ntheir tents; and the king being set at his dinner, there came in two\nmessengers, of whom that one was Marshal of France, and said to the\nking that the emperor was entered into France, and had destroyed a great\npart, and was in Burgoyne, and had destroyed and made great slaughter\nof people, and burnt towns and boroughs; wherefore, if thou come not\nhastily, they must yield up their bodies and goods.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How King Arthur sent Sir Gawaine and other to Lucius, and\nhow they were assailed and escaped with worship.\n\nTHEN the king did do call Sir Gawaine, Sir Bors, Sir Lionel, and Sir\nBedivere, and commanded them to go straight to Sir Lucius, and say ye to\nhim that hastily he remove out of my land; and if he will not, bid him\nmake him ready to battle and not distress the poor people. Then anon\nthese noble knights dressed them to horseback, and when they came to the\ngreen wood, they saw many pavilions set in a meadow, of silk of divers\ncolours, beside a river, and the emperor's pavilion was in the middle\nwith an eagle displayed above. To the which tent our knights rode\ntoward, and ordained Sir Gawaine and Sir Bors to do the message, and\nleft in a bushment Sir Lionel and Sir Bedivere. And then Sir Gawaine and\nSir Bors did their message, and commanded Lucius, in Arthur's name to\navoid his land, or shortly to address him to battle. To whom Lucius\nanswered and said, Ye shall return to your lord, and say ye to him that\nI shall subdue him and all his lands. Then Sir Gawaine was wroth and\nsaid, I had liefer than all France fight against thee; and so had I,\nsaid Sir Bors, liefer than all Brittany or Burgoyne.\n\n\nThen a knight named Sir Gainus, nigh cousin to the emperor, said, Lo,\nhow these Britons be full of pride and boast, and they brag as though\nthey bare up all the world. Then Sir Gawaine was sore grieved with these\nwords, and pulled out his sword and smote off his head. And therewith\nturned their horses and rode over waters and through woods till they\ncame to their bushment, whereas Sir Lionel and Sir Bedivere were\nhoving. The Romans followed fast after, on horseback and on foot, over\na champaign unto a wood; then Sir Bors turned his horse and saw a knight\ncome fast on, whom he smote through the body with a spear that he fell\ndead down to the earth; then came Caliburn one of the strongest of\nPavie, and smote down many of Arthur's knights. And when Sir Bors saw\nhim do so much harm, he addressed toward him, and smote him through the\nbreast, that he fell down dead to the earth. Then Sir Feldenak thought\nto revenge the death of Gainus upon Sir Gawaine, but Sir Gawaine was\nware thereof, and smote him on the head, which stroke stinted not till\nit came to his breast. And then he returned and came to his fellows in\nthe bushment. And there was a recounter, for the bushment brake on the\nRomans, and slew and hew down the Romans, and forced the Romans to flee\nand return, whom the noble knights chased unto their tents.\n\nThen the Romans gathered more people, and also footmen came on, and\nthere was a new battle, and so much people that Sir Bors and Sir Berel\nwere taken. But when Sir Gawaine saw that, he took with him Sir Idrus\nthe good knight, and said he would never see King Arthur but if he\nrescued them, and pulled out Galatine his good sword, and followed them\nthat led those two knights away; and he smote him that led Sir Bors, and\ntook Sir Bors from him and delivered him to his fellows. And Sir Idrus\nin likewise rescued Sir Berel. Then began the battle to be great, that\nour knights were in great jeopardy, wherefore Sir Gawaine sent to King\nArthur for succour, and that he hie him, for I am sore wounded, and that\nour prisoners may pay goods out of number. And the messenger came to\nthe king and told him his message. And anon the king did do assemble his\narmy, but anon, or he departed the prisoners were come, and Sir Gawaine\nand his fellows gat the field and put the Romans to flight, and after\nreturned and came with their fellowship in such wise that no man of\nworship was lost of them, save that Sir Gawaine was sore hurt. Then\nthe king did do ransack his wounds and comforted him. And thus was the\nbeginning of the first journey of the Britons and Romans, and there were\nslain of the Romans more than ten thousand, and great joy and mirth was\nmade that night in the host of King Arthur. And on the morn he sent all\nthe prisoners into Paris under the guard of Sir Launcelot, with many\nknights, and of Sir Cador.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. How Lucius sent certain spies in a bushment for to have\ntaken his knights being prisoners, and how they were letted.\n\nNOW turn we to the Emperor of Rome, which espied that these prisoners\nshould be sent to Paris, and anon he sent to lie in a bushment certain\nknights and princes with sixty thousand men, for to rescue his knights\nand lords that were prisoners. And so on the morn as Launcelot and Sir\nCador, chieftains and governors of all them that conveyed the prisoners,\nas they should pass through a wood, Sir Launcelot sent certain knights\nto espy if any were in the woods to let them. And when the said knights\ncame into the wood, anon they espied and saw the great embushment, and\nreturned and told Sir Launcelot that there lay in await for them three\nscore thousand Romans. And then Sir Launcelot with such knights as he\nhad, and men of war to the number of ten thousand, put them in array,\nand met with them and fought with them manly, and slew and detrenched\nmany of the Romans, and slew many knights and admirals of the party\nof the Romans and Saracens; there was slain the king of Lyly and three\ngreat lords, Aladuke, Herawd, and Heringdale. But Sir Launcelot fought\nso nobly that no man might endure a stroke of his hand, but where he\ncame he showed his prowess and might, for he slew down right on every\nside; and the Romans and Saracens fled from him as the sheep from the\nwolf or from the lion, and put them, all that abode alive, to flight.\n\nAnd so long they fought that tidings came to King Arthur, and anon he\ngraithed him and came to the battle, and saw his knights how they had\nvanquished the battle, he embraced them knight by knight in his arms,\nand said, Ye be worthy to wield all your honour and worship; there was\nnever king save myself that had so noble knights. Sir, said Cador,\nthere was none of us failed other, but of the prowess and manhood of Sir\nLauncelot were more than wonder to tell, and also of his cousins which\ndid that day many noble feats of war. And also Sir Cador told who of his\nknights were slain, as Sir Berel, and other Sir Moris and Sir Maurel,\ntwo good knights. Then the king wept, and dried his eyes with a\nkerchief, and said, Your courage had near-hand destroyed you, for though\nye had returned again, ye had lost no worship; for I call it folly,\nknights to abide when they be overmatched. Nay, said Launcelot and the\nother, for once shamed may never be recovered.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How a senator told to Lucius of their discomfiture, and\nalso of the great battle between Arthur and Lucius.\n\nNOW leave we King Arthur and his noble knights which had won the field,\nand had brought their prisoners to Paris, and speak we of a senator\nwhich escaped from the battle, and came to Lucius the emperor, and said\nto him, Sir emperor, I advise thee for to withdraw thee; what dost thou\nhere? thou shalt win nothing in these marches but great strokes out\nof all measure, for this day one of Arthur's knights was worth in the\nbattle an hundred of ours. Fie on thee, said Lucius, thou speakest\ncowardly; for thy words grieve me more than all the loss that I had this\nday. And anon he sent forth a king, which hight Sir Leomie, with a great\narmy, and bade him hie him fast to-fore, and he would follow hastily\nafter. King Arthur was warned privily, and sent his people to Sessoine,\nand took up the towns and castles from the Romans. Then the king\ncommanded Sir Cador to take the rearward, and to take with him certain\nknights of the Round Table, and Sir Launcelot, Sir Bors, Sir Kay, Sir\nMarrok, with Sir Marhaus, shall await on our person. Thus the King\nArthur disperpled his host in divers parties, to the end that his\nenemies should not escape.\n\nWhen the emperor was entered into the vale of Sessoine, he might see\nwhere King Arthur was embattled and his banner displayed; and he was\nbeset round about with his enemies, that needs he must fight or yield\nhim, for he might not flee, but said openly unto the Romans, Sirs, I\nadmonish you that this day ye fight and acquit you as men, and remember\nhow Rome domineth and is chief and head over all the earth and universal\nworld, and suffer not these Britons this day to abide against us; and\ntherewith he did command his trumpets to blow the bloody sounds, in such\nwise that the ground trembled and dindled.\n\nThen the battles approached and shoved and shouted on both sides, and\ngreat strokes were smitten on both sides, many men overthrown, hurt, and\nslain; and great valiances, prowesses and appertices of war were that\nday showed, which were over long to recount the noble feats of every\nman, for they should contain an whole volume. But in especial, King\nArthur rode in the battle exhorting his knights to do well, and himself\ndid as nobly with his hands as was possible a man to do; he drew out\nExcalibur his sword, and awaited ever whereas the Romans were thickest\nand most grieved his people, and anon he addressed him on that part,\nand hew and slew down right, and rescued his people; and he slew a great\ngiant named Galapas, which was a man of an huge quantity and height, he\nshorted him and smote off both his legs by the knees, saying, Now art\nthou better of a size to deal with than thou were, and after smote off\nhis head. There Sir Gawaine fought nobly and slew three admirals in that\nbattle. And so did all the knights of the Round Table. Thus the battle\nbetween King Arthur and Lucius the Emperor endured long. Lucius had on\nhis side many Saracens which were slain. And thus the battle was great,\nand oftsides that one party was at a fordeal and anon at an afterdeal,\nwhich endured so long till at the last King Arthur espied where Lucius\nthe Emperor fought, and did wonder with his own hands. And anon he rode\nto him. And either smote other fiercely, and at last Lucius smote Arthur\nthwart the visage, and gave him a large wound. And when King Arthur felt\nhimself hurt, anon he smote him again with Excalibur that it cleft his\nhead, from the summit of his head, and stinted not till it came to his\nbreast. And then the emperor fell down dead and there ended his life.\n\nAnd when it was known that the emperor was slain, anon all the Romans\nwith all their host put them to flight, and King Arthur with all his\nknights followed the chase, and slew down right all them that they might\nattain. And thus was the victory given to King Arthur, and the triumph;\nand there were slain on the part of Lucius more than an hundred\nthousand. And after King Arthur did do ransack the dead bodies, and did\ndo bury them that were slain of his retinue, every man according to the\nestate and degree that he was of. And them that were hurt he let the\nsurgeons do search their hurts and wounds, and commanded to spare no\nsalves nor medicines till they were whole.\n\nThen the king rode straight to the place where the Emperor Lucius lay\ndead, and with him he found slain the Soudan of Syria, the King of Egypt\nand of Ethiopia, which were two noble kings, with seventeen other kings\nof divers regions, and also sixty senators of Rome, all noble men, whom\nthe king did do balm and gum with many good gums aromatic, and after did\ndo cere them in sixty fold of cered cloth of sendal, and laid them in\nchests of lead, because they should not chafe nor savour, and upon all\nthese bodies their shields with their arms and banners were set, to the\nend they should be known of what country they were. And after he found\nthree senators which were alive, to whom he said, For to save your lives\nI will that ye take these dead bodies, and carry them with you unto\ngreat Rome, and present them to the Potestate on my behalf, shewing him\nmy letters, and tell them that I in my person shall hastily be at Rome.\nAnd I suppose the Romans shall beware how they shall demand any tribute\nof me. And I command you to say when ye shall come to Rome, to the\nPotestate and all the Council and Senate, that I send to them these\ndead bodies for the tribute that they have demanded. And if they be not\ncontent with these, I shall pay more at my coming, for other tribute\nowe I none, nor none other will I pay. And methinketh this sufficeth for\nBritain, Ireland and all Almaine with Germany. And furthermore, I charge\nyou to say to them, that I command them upon pain of their heads never\nto demand tribute nor tax of me nor of my lands. Then with this charge\nand commandment, the three senators aforesaid departed with all the said\ndead bodies, laying the body of Lucius in a car covered with the arms of\nthe Empire all alone; and after alway two bodies of kings in a chariot,\nand then the bodies of the senators after them, and so went toward\nRome, and showed their legation and message to the Potestate and Senate,\nrecounting the battle done in France, and how the field was lost and\nmuch people and innumerable slain. Wherefore they advised them in no\nwise to move no more war against that noble conqueror Arthur, for his\nmight and prowess is most to be doubted, seen the noble kings and great\nmultitude of knights of the Round Table, to whom none earthly prince may\ncompare.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX How Arthur, after he had achieved the battle against the\nRomans, entered into Almaine, and so into Italy.\n\nNOW turn we unto King Arthur and his noble knights, which, after the\ngreat battle achieved against the Romans, entered into Lorraine, Brabant\nand Flanders, and sithen returned into Haut Almaine, and so over the\nmountains into Lombardy, and after, into Tuscany wherein was a city\nwhich in no wise would yield themself nor obey, wherefore King Arthur\nbesieged it, and lay long about it, and gave many assaults to the city;\nand they within defended them valiantly. Then, on a time, the king\ncalled Sir Florence, a knight, and said to him they lacked victual, And\nnot far from hence be great forests and woods, wherein be many of mine\nenemies with much bestial: I will that thou make thee ready and go\nthither in foraying, and take with thee Sir Gawaine my nephew, Sir\nWisshard, Sir Clegis, Sir Cleremond, and the Captain of Cardiff with\nother, and bring with you all the beasts that ye there can get.\n\nAnd anon these knights made them ready, and rode over holts and hills,\nthrough forests and woods, till they came into a fair meadow full of\nfair flowers and grass; and there they rested them and their horses\nall that night. And in the springing of the day in the next morn, Sir\nGawaine took his horse and stole away from his fellowship, to seek\nsome adventures. And anon he was ware of a man armed, walking his horse\neasily by a wood's side, and his shield laced to his shoulder, sitting\non a strong courser, without any man saving a page bearing a mighty\nspear. The knight bare in his shield three griffins of gold, in sable\ncarbuncle, the chief of silver. When Sir Gawaine espied this gay knight,\nhe feutred his spear, and rode straight to him, and demanded of him from\nwhence that he was. That other answered and said he was of Tuscany, and\ndemanded of Sir Gawaine, What, profferest thou, proud knight, thee so\nboldly? here gettest thou no prey, thou mayest prove what thou wilt,\nfor thou shalt be my prisoner or thou depart. Then said Gawaine, thou\navauntest thee greatly and speakest proud words, I counsel thee for all\nthy boast that thou make thee ready, and take thy gear to thee, to-fore\ngreater grame fall to thee.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. Of a battle done by Sir Gawaine against a Saracen, which\nafter was yielden and became Christian.\n\nTHEN they took their spears and ran each at other with all the might\nthey had, and smote each other through their shields into their\nshoulders, wherefore anon they pulled out their swords, and smote great\nstrokes that the fire sprang out of their helms. Then Sir Gawaine was\nall abashed, and with Galatine his good sword he smote through shield\nand thick hauberk made of thick mails, and all to-rushed and break the\nprecious stones, and made him a large wound, that men might see both\nliver and lung. Then groaned that knight, and addressed him to Sir\nGawaine, and with an awk stroke gave him a great wound and cut a vein,\nwhich grieved Gawaine sore, and he bled sore. Then the knight said\nto Sir Gawaine, bind thy wound or thy blee[ding] change, for thou\nbe-bleedest all thy horse and thy fair arms, for all the barbers of\nBrittany shall not con staunch thy blood, for whosomever is hurt with\nthis blade he shall never be staunched of bleeding. Then answered\nGawaine, it grieveth me but little, thy great words shall not fear\nme nor lessen my courage, but thou shalt suffer teen and sorrow or we\ndepart, but tell me in haste who may staunch my bleeding. That may I do,\nsaid the knight, if I will, and so will I if thou wilt succour and aid\nme, that I may be christened and believe on God, and thereof I require\nthee of thy manhood, and it shall be great merit for thy soul. I grant,\nsaid Gawaine, so God help me, to accomplish all thy desire, but first\ntell me what thou soughtest here thus alone, and of what land and\nliegiance thou art of. Sir, he said, my name is Priamus, and a great\nprince is my father, and he hath been rebel unto Rome and overridden\nmany of their lands. My father is lineally descended of Alexander and\nof Hector by right line. And Duke Joshua and Maccabaeus were of our\nlineage. I am right inheritor of Alexandria and Africa, and all the out\nisles, yet will I believe on thy Lord that thou believest on; and for\nthy labour I shall give thee treasure enough. I was so elate and hauteyn\nin my heart that I thought no man my peer, nor to me semblable. I was\nsent into this war with seven score knights, and now I have encountered\nwith thee, which hast given to me of fighting my fill, wherefore sir\nknight, I pray thee to tell me what thou art. I am no knight, said\nGawaine, I have been brought up in the guardrobe with the noble King\nArthur many years, for to take heed to his armour and his other array,\nand to point his paltocks that long to himself. At Yule last he made me\nyeoman, and gave to me horse and harness, and an hundred pound in money;\nand if fortune be my friend, I doubt not but to be well advanced and\nholpen by my liege lord. Ah, said Priamus, if his knaves be so keen and\nfierce, his knights be passing good: now for the King's love of Heaven,\nwhether thou be a knave or a knight, tell thou me thy name. By God,\nsaid Sir Gawaine, now I will say thee sooth, my name is Sir Gawaine, and\nknown I am in his court and in his chamber, and one of the knights of\nthe Round Table, he dubbed me a duke with his own hand. Therefore grudge\nnot if this grace is to me fortuned, it is the goodness of God that\nlent to me my strength. Now am I better pleased, said Priamus, than thou\nhadst given to me all the Provence and Paris the rich. I had liefer to\nhave been torn with wild horses, than any varlet had won such loos, or\nany page or priker should have had prize on me. But now sir knight\nI warn thee that hereby is a Duke of Lorraine with his army, and the\nnoblest men of Dolphiny, and lords of Lombardy, with the garrison of\nGodard, and Saracens of Southland, y-numbered sixty thousand of good men\nof arms; wherefore but if we hie us hence, it will harm us both, for we\nbe sore hurt, never like to recover; but take heed to my page, that\nhe no horn blow, for if he do, there be hoving here fast by an hundred\nknights awaiting on my person, and if they take thee, there shall no\nransom of gold nor silver acquit thee.\n\nThen Sir Gawaine rode over a water for to save him, and the knight\nfollowed him, and so rode forth till they came to his fellows which were\nin the meadow, where they had been all the night. Anon as Sir Wisshard\nwas ware of Sir Gawaine and saw that he was hurt, he ran to him\nsorrowfully weeping, and demanded of him who had so hurt him; and\nGawaine told how he had foughten with that man, and each of them had\nhurt other, and how he had salves to heal them; but I can tell you other\ntidings, that soon we shall have ado with many enemies.\n\nThen Sir Priamus and Sir Gawaine alighted, and let their horses graze in\nthe meadow, and unarmed them, and then the blood ran freshly from their\nwounds. And Priamus took from his page a vial full of the four waters\nthat came out of Paradise, and with certain balm anointed their wounds,\nand washed them with that water, and within an hour after they were\nboth as whole as ever they were. And then with a trumpet were they all\nassembled to council, and there Priamus told unto them what lords and\nknights had sworn to rescue him, and that without fail they should be\nassailed with many thousands, wherefore he counselled them to withdraw\nthem. Then Sir Gawaine said, it were great shame to them to avoid\nwithout any strokes; Wherefore I advise to take our arms and to make\nus ready to meet with these Saracens and misbelieving men, and with the\nhelp of God we shall overthrow them and have a fair day on them. And Sir\nFlorence shall abide still in this field to keep the stale as a noble\nknight, and we shall not forsake yonder fellows. Now, said Priamus,\ncease your words, for I warn you ye shall find in yonder woods many\nperilous knights; they will put forth beasts to call you on, they be out\nof number, and ye are not past seven hundred, which be over few to fight\nwith so many. Nevertheless, said Sir Gawaine, we shall once encounter\nthem, and see what they can do, and the best shall have the victory.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How the Saracens came out of a wood for to rescue their\nbeasts, and of a great battle.\n\nTHEN Sir Florence called to him Sir Floridas, with an hundred knights,\nand drove forth the herd of beasts. Then followed him seven hundred men\nof arms; and Sir Ferant of Spain on a fair steed came springing out of\nthe woods, and came to Sir Florence and asked him why he fled. Then\nSir Florence took his spear and rode against him, and smote him in the\nforehead and brake his neck bone. Then all the other were moved, and\nthought to avenge the death of Sir Ferant, and smote in among them, and\nthere was great fight, and many slain and laid down to ground, and\nSir Florence with his hundred knights alway kept the stale, and fought\nmanly.\n\nThen when Priamus the good knight perceived the great fight, he went to\nSir Gawaine, and bade him that he should go and succour his fellowship,\nwhich were sore bestead with their enemies. Sir, grieve you not, said\nSir Gawaine, for their gree shall be theirs. I shall not once move my\nhorse to them ward, but if I see more than there be; for they be strong\nenough to match them.\n\nAnd with that he saw an earl called Sir Ethelwold and the duke of\nDutchmen, came leaping out of a wood with many thousands, and Priamus'\nknights, and came straight unto the battle. Then Sir Gawaine comforted\nhis knights, and bade them not to be abashed, for all shall be ours.\nThen they began to wallop and met with their enemies, there were men\nslain and overthrown on every side. Then thrust in among them the\nknights of the Table Round, and smote down to the earth all them that\nwithstood them, in so much that they made them to recoil and flee. By\nGod, said Sir Gawaine, this gladdeth my heart, for now be they less in\nnumber by twenty thousand. Then entered into the battle Jubance a giant,\nand fought and slew down right, and distressed many of our knights,\namong whom was slain Sir Gherard, a knight of Wales. Then our knights\ntook heart to them, and slew many Saracens. And then came in Sir Priamus\nwith his pennon, and rode with the knights of the Round Table, and\nfought so manfully that many of their enemies lost their lives. And\nthere Sir Priamus slew the Marquis of Moises land, and Sir Gawaine with\nhis fellows so quit them that they had the field, but in that stour was\nSir Chestelaine, a child and ward of Sir Gawaine slain, wherefore was\nmuch sorrow made, and his death was soon avenged. Thus was the battle\nended, and many lords of Lombardy and Saracens left dead in the field.\n\nThen Sir Florence and Sir Gawaine harboured surely their people, and\ntook great plenty of bestial, of gold and silver, and great treasure and\nriches, and returned unto King Arthur, which lay still at the siege. And\nwhen they came to the king they presented their prisoners and recounted\ntheir adventures, and how they had vanquished their enemies.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How Sir Gawaine returned to King Arthur with his prisoners,\nand how the King won a city, and how he was crowned Emperor.\n\nNOW thanked be God, said the noble King Arthur. But what manner man is\nhe that standeth by himself, him seemeth no prisoner. Sir, said Gawaine,\nthis is a good man of arms, he hath matched me, but he is yielden unto\nGod, and to me, for to become Christian; had not he have been we should\nnever have returned, wherefore I pray you that he may be baptised, for\nthere liveth not a nobler man nor better knight of his hands. Then the\nking let him anon be christened, and did do call him his first name\nPriamus, and made him a duke and knight of the Table Round. And then\nanon the king let do cry assault to the city, and there was rearing of\nladders, breaking of walls, and the ditch filled, that men with little\npain might enter into the city. Then came out a duchess, and Clarisin\nthe countess, with many ladies and damosels, and kneeling before King\nArthur, required him for the love of God to receive the city, and not\nto take it by assault, for then should many guiltless be slain. Then\nthe king avaled his visor with a meek and noble countenance, and said,\nMadam, there shall none of my subjects misdo you nor your maidens, nor\nto none that to you belong, but the duke shall abide my judgment. Then\nanon the king commanded to leave the assault, and anon the duke's oldest\nson brought out the keys, and kneeling delivered them to the king, and\nbesought him of grace; and the king seized the town by assent of his\nlords, and took the duke and sent him to Dover, there for to abide\nprisoner term of his life, and assigned certain rents for the dower of\nthe duchess and for her children.\n\nThen he made lords to rule those lands, and laws as a lord ought to do\nin his own country; and after he took his journey toward Rome, and sent\nSir Floris and Sir Floridas to-fore, with five hundred men of arms, and\nthey came to the city of Urbino and laid there a bushment, thereas them\nseemed most best for them, and rode to-fore the town, where anon issued\nout much people and skirmished with the fore-riders. Then brake out the\nbushment and won the bridge, and after the town, and set upon the walls\nthe king's banner. Then came the king upon an hill, and saw the city\nand his banner on the walls, by which he knew that the city was won. And\nanon he sent and commanded that none of his liege men should defoul nor\nlie by no lady, wife nor maid; and when he came into the city, he passed\nto the castle, and comforted them that were in sorrow, and ordained\nthere a captain, a knight of his own country.\n\nAnd when they of Milan heard that thilk city was won, they sent to King\nArthur great sums of money, and besought him as their lord to have pity\non them, promising to be his subjects for ever, and yield to him homage\nand fealty for the lands of Pleasance and Pavia, Petersaint, and the\nPort of Tremble, and to give him yearly a million of gold all his\nlifetime. Then he rideth into Tuscany, and winneth towns and castles,\nand wasted all in his way that to him will not obey, and so to Spolute\nand Viterbe, and from thence he rode into the Vale of Vicecount among\nthe vines. And from thence he sent to the senators, to wit whether they\nwould know him for their lord. But soon after on a Saturday came unto\nKing Arthur all the senators that were left alive, and the noblest\ncardinals that then dwelt in Rome, and prayed him of peace, and\nproferred him full large, and besought him as governor to give licence\nfor six weeks for to assemble all the Romans, and then to crown him\nemperor with chrism as it belongeth to so high estate. I assent, said\nthe king, like as ye have devised, and at Christmas there to be crowned,\nand to hold my Round Table with my knights as me liketh. And then the\nsenators made ready for his enthronization. And at the day appointed, as\nthe romance telleth, he came into Rome, and was crowned emperor by the\npope's hand, with all the royalty that could be made, and sojourned\nthere a time, and established all his lands from Rome into France, and\ngave lands and realms unto his servants and knights, to everych after\nhis desert, in such wise that none complained, rich nor poor. And he\ngave to Sir Priamus the duchy of Lorraine; and he thanked him, and said\nhe would serve him the days of his life; and after made dukes and earls,\nand made every man rich.\n\nThen after this all his knights and lords assembled them afore him, and\nsaid: Blessed be God, your war is finished and your conquest achieved,\nin so much that we know none so great nor mighty that dare make war\nagainst you: wherefore we beseech you to return homeward, and give us\nlicence to go home to our wives, from whom we have been long, and to\nrest us, for your journey is finished with honour and worship. Then\nsaid the king, Ye say truth, and for to tempt God it is no wisdom, and\ntherefore make you ready and return we into England. Then there was\ntrussing of harness and baggage and great carriage. And after licence\ngiven, he returned and commanded that no man in pain of death should not\nrob nor take victual, nor other thing by the way but that he should pay\ntherefore. And thus he came over the sea and landed at Sandwich, against\nwhom Queen Guenever his wife came and met him, and he was nobly received\nof all his commons in every city and burgh, and great gifts presented to\nhim at his home-coming to welcome him with.\n\nThus endeth the fifth book of the conquest that King Arthur had against\nLucius the Emperor of Rome, and here followeth the sixth book, which is\nof Sir Launcelot du Lake.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VI.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lionel departed from the court, and\nhow Sir Lionel left him sleeping and was taken.\n\nSOON after that King Arthur was come from Rome into England, then all\nthe knights of the Table Round resorted unto the king, and made many\njousts and tournaments, and some there were that were but knights, which\nincreased so in arms and worship that they passed all their fellows\nin prowess and noble deeds, and that was well proved on many; but in\nespecial it was proved on Sir Launcelot du Lake, for in all tournaments\nand jousts and deeds of arms, both for life and death, he passed all\nother knights, and at no time he was never overcome but if it were by\ntreason or enchantment; so Sir Launcelot increased so marvellously in\nworship, and in honour, therefore is he the first knight that the French\nbook maketh mention of after King Arthur came from Rome. Wherefore Queen\nGuenever had him in great favour above all other knights, and in certain\nhe loved the queen again above all other ladies and damosels of his\nlife, and for her he did many deeds of arms, and saved her from the fire\nthrough his noble chivalry.\n\nThus Sir Launcelot rested him long with play and game. And then he\nthought himself to prove himself in strange adventures, then he bade\nhis nephew, Sir Lionel, for to make him ready; for we two will seek\nadventures. So they mounted on their horses, armed at all rights, and\nrode into a deep forest and so into a deep plain. And then the weather\nwas hot about noon, and Sir Launcelot had great lust to sleep. Then\nSir Lionel espied a great apple-tree that stood by an hedge, and said,\nBrother, yonder is a fair shadow, there may we rest us [and] our horses.\nIt is well said, fair brother, said Sir Launcelot, for this eight year I\nwas not so sleepy as I am now; and so they there alighted and tied their\nhorses unto sundry trees, and so Sir Launcelot laid him down under an\nappletree, and his helm he laid under his head. And Sir Lionel waked\nwhile he slept. So Sir Launcelot was asleep passing fast.\n\nAnd in the meanwhile there came three knights riding, as fast fleeing as\never they might ride. And there followed them three but one knight. And\nwhen Sir Lionel saw him, him thought he saw never so great a knight,\nnor so well faring a man, neither so well apparelled unto all rights.\nSo within a while this strong knight had overtaken one of these knights,\nand there he smote him to the cold earth that he lay still. And then he\nrode unto the second knight, and smote him so that man and horse fell\ndown. And then straight to the third knight he rode, and smote him\nbehind his horse's arse a spear length. And then he alighted down and\nreined his horse on the bridle, and bound all the three knights fast\nwith the reins of their own bridles. When Sir Lionel saw him do thus, he\nthought to assay him, and made him ready, and stilly and privily he took\nhis horse, and thought not for to awake Sir Launcelot. And when he was\nmounted upon his horse, he overtook this strong knight, and bade him\nturn, and the other smote Sir Lionel so hard that horse and man he bare\nto the earth, and so he alighted down and bound him fast, and threw him\noverthwart his own horse, and so he served them all four, and rode with\nthem away to his own castle. And when he came there he gart unarm them,\nand beat them with thorns all naked, and after put them in a deep prison\nwhere were many more knights, that made great dolour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How Sir Ector followed for to seek Sir Launcelot, and how he\nwas taken by Sir Turquine.\n\nWHEN Sir Ector de Maris wist that Sir Launcelot was passed out of the\ncourt to seek adventures, he was wroth with himself, and made him ready\nto seek Sir Launcelot, and as he had ridden long in a great forest he\nmet with a man was like a forester. Fair fellow, said Sir Ector, knowest\nthou in this country any adventures that be here nigh hand? Sir, said\nthe forester, this country know I well, and hereby, within this mile,\nis a strong manor, and well dyked, and by that manor, on the left hand,\nthere is a fair ford for horses to drink of, and over that ford there\ngroweth a fair tree, and thereon hang many fair shields that wielded\nsometime good knights, and at the hole of the tree hangeth a basin of\ncopper and latten, and strike upon that basin with the butt of thy spear\nthrice, and soon after thou shalt hear new tidings, and else hast thou\nthe fairest grace that many a year had ever knight that passed through\nthis forest. Gramercy, said Sir Ector, and departed and came to the\ntree, and saw many fair shields. And among them he saw his brother's\nshield, Sir Lionel, and many more that he knew that were his fellows of\nthe Round Table, the which grieved his heart, and promised to revenge\nhis brother.\n\nThen anon Sir Ector beat on the basin as he were wood, and then he gave\nhis horse drink at the ford, and there came a knight behind him and bade\nhim come out of the water and make him ready; and Sir Ector anon turned\nhim shortly, and in feuter cast his spear, and smote the other knight a\ngreat buffet that his horse turned twice about. This was well done, said\nthe strong knight, and knightly thou hast stricken me; and therewith he\nrushed his horse on Sir Ector, and cleight him under his right arm, and\nbare him clean out of the saddle, and rode with him away into his own\nhall, and threw him down in midst of the floor. The name of this knight\nwas Sir Turquine. Then he said unto Sir Ector, For thou hast done this\nday more unto me than any knight did these twelve years, now will I\ngrant thee thy life, so thou wilt be sworn to be my prisoner all thy\nlife days. Nay, said Sir Ector, that will I never promise thee, but that\nI will do mine advantage. That me repenteth, said Sir Turquine. And then\nhe gart to unarm him, and beat him with thorns all naked, and sithen put\nhim down in a deep dungeon, where he knew many of his fellows. But when\nSir Ector saw Sir Lionel, then made he great sorrow. Alas, brother, said\nSir Ector, where is my brother Sir Launcelot? Fair brother, I left\nhim asleep when that I from him yode, under an apple-tree, and what\nis become of him I cannot tell you. Alas, said the knights, but Sir\nLauncelot help us we may never be delivered, for we know now no knight\nthat is able to match our master Turquine.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III How four queens found Launcelot sleeping, and how by\nenchantment he was taken and led into a castle.\n\nNOW leave we these knights prisoners, and speak we of Sir Launcelot du\nLake that lieth under the apple-tree sleeping. Even about the noon there\ncame by him four queens of great estate; and, for the heat should not\nannoy them, there rode four knights about them, and bare a cloth of\ngreen silk on four spears, betwixt them and the sun, and the queens rode\non four white mules. Thus as they rode they heard by them a great horse\ngrimly neigh, then were they ware of a sleeping knight, that lay all\narmed under an apple-tree; anon as these queens looked on his face,\nthey knew it was Sir Launcelot. Then they began for to strive for that\nknight, everych one said they would have him to her love. We shall not\nstrive, said Morgan le Fay, that was King Arthur's sister, I shall put\nan enchantment upon him that he shall not awake in six hours, and then I\nwill lead him away unto my castle, and when he is surely within my hold,\nI shall take the enchantment from him, and then let him choose which of\nus he will have unto paramour.\n\nSo this enchantment was cast upon Sir Launcelot, and then they laid him\nupon his shield, and bare him so on horseback betwixt two knights,\nand brought him unto the castle Chariot, and there they laid him in a\nchamber cold, and at night they sent unto him a fair damosel with his\nsupper ready dight. By that the enchantment was past, and when she came\nshe saluted him, and asked him what cheer. I cannot say, fair damosel,\nsaid Sir Launcelot, for I wot not how I came into this castle but it be\nby an enchantment. Sir, said she, ye must make good cheer, and if ye\nbe such a knight as it is said ye be, I shall tell you more to-morn by\nprime of the day. Gramercy, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, of your\ngood will I require you. And so she departed. And there he lay all that\nnight without comfort of anybody. And on the morn early came these four\nqueens, passingly well beseen, all they bidding him good morn, and he\nthem again.\n\nSir knight, the four queens said, thou must understand thou art our\nprisoner, and we here know thee well that thou art Sir Launcelot du\nLake, King Ban's son, and because we understand your worthiness, that\nthou art the noblest knight living, and as we know well there can no\nlady have thy love but one, and that is Queen Guenever, and now thou\nshalt lose her for ever, and she thee, and therefore thee behoveth now\nto choose one of us four. I am the Queen Morgan le Fay, queen of the\nland of Gore, and here is the queen of Northgalis, and the queen of\nEastland, and the queen of the Out Isles; now choose one of us which\nthou wilt have to thy paramour, for thou mayest not choose or else\nin this prison to die. This is an hard case, said Sir Launcelot, that\neither I must die or else choose one of you, yet had I liefer to die in\nthis prison with worship, than to have one of you to my paramour maugre\nmy head. And therefore ye be answered, I will none of you, for ye be\nfalse enchantresses, and as for my lady, Dame Guenever, were I at my\nliberty as I was, I would prove it on you or on yours, that she is the\ntruest lady unto her lord living. Well, said the queens, is this your\nanswer, that ye will refuse us. Yea, on my life, said Sir Launcelot,\nrefused ye be of me. So they departed and left him there alone that made\ngreat sorrow.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How Sir Launcelot was delivered by the mean of a damosel.\n\nRIGHT so at the noon came the damosel unto him with his dinner, and\nasked him what cheer. Truly, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, in my\nlife days never so ill. Sir, she said, that me repenteth, but an ye will\nbe ruled by me, I shall help you out of this distress, and ye shall have\nno shame nor villainy, so that ye hold me a promise. Fair damosel, I\nwill grant you, and sore I am of these queen-sorceresses afeard, for\nthey have destroyed many a good knight. Sir, said she, that is sooth,\nand for the renown and bounty that they hear of you they would have your\nlove, and Sir, they say, your name is Sir Launcelot du Lake, the flower\nof knights, and they be passing wroth with you that ye have refused\nthem. But Sir, an ye would promise me to help my father on Tuesday\nnext coming, that hath made a tournament betwixt him and the King of\nNorthgalis--for the last Tuesday past my father lost the field through\nthree knights of Arthur's court--an ye will be there on Tuesday next\ncoming, and help my father, to-morn or prime, by the grace of God, I\nshall deliver you clean. Fair maiden, said Sir Launcelot, tell me what\nis your father's name, and then shall I give you an answer. Sir knight,\nshe said, my father is King Bagdemagus, that was foul rebuked at the\nlast tournament. I know your father well, said Sir Launcelot, for a\nnoble king and a good knight, and by the faith of my body, ye shall have\nmy body ready to do your father and you service at that day. Sir, she\nsaid, gramercy, and to-morn await ye be ready betimes and I shall be she\nthat shall deliver you and take you your armour and your horse, shield\nand spear, and hereby within this ten mile, is an abbey of white monks,\nthere I pray you that ye me abide, and thither shall I bring my father\nunto you. All this shall be done, said Sir Launcelot as I am true\nknight.\n\nAnd so she departed, and came on the morn early, and found him ready;\nthen she brought him out of twelve locks, and brought him unto his\narmour, and when he was clean armed, she brought him until his own\nhorse, and lightly he saddled him and took a great spear in his hand\nand so rode forth, and said, Fair damosel, I shall not fail you, by the\ngrace of God. And so he rode into a great forest all that day, and never\ncould find no highway and so the night fell on him, and then was he\nware in a slade, of a pavilion of red sendal. By my faith, said Sir\nLauncelot, in that pavilion will I lodge all this night, and so there he\nalighted down, and tied his horse to the pavilion, and there he unarmed\nhim, and there he found a bed, and laid him therein and fell asleep\nsadly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How a knight found Sir Launcelot lying in his leman's bed,\nand how Sir Launcelot fought with the knight.\n\nTHEN within an hour there came the knight to whom the pavilion ought,\nand he weened that his leman had lain in that bed, and so he laid him\ndown beside Sir Launcelot, and took him in his arms and began to kiss\nhim. And when Sir Launcelot felt a rough beard kissing him, he started\nout of the bed lightly, and the other knight after him, and either of\nthem gat their swords in their hands, and out at the pavilion door went\nthe knight of the pavilion, and Sir Launcelot followed him, and there by\na little slake Sir Launcelot wounded him sore, nigh unto the death. And\nthen he yielded him unto Sir Launcelot, and so he granted him, so that\nhe would tell him why he came into the bed. Sir, said the knight, the\npavilion is mine own, and there this night I had assigned my lady to\nhave slept with me, and now I am likely to die of this wound. That me\nrepenteth, said Launcelot, of your hurt, but I was adread of treason,\nfor I was late beguiled, and therefore come on your way into your\npavilion and take your rest, and as I suppose I shall staunch your\nblood. And so they went both into the pavilion, and anon Sir Launcelot\nstaunched his blood.\n\nTherewithal came the knight's lady, that was a passing fair lady, and\nwhen she espied that her lord Belleus was sore wounded, she cried out on\nSir Launcelot, and made great dole out of measure. Peace, my lady and\nmy love, said Belleus, for this knight is a good man, and a knight\nadventurous, and there he told her all the cause how he was wounded; And\nwhen that I yielded me unto him, he left me goodly and hath staunched my\nblood. Sir, said the lady, I require thee tell me what knight ye be, and\nwhat is your name? Fair lady, he said, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake.\nSo me thought ever by your speech, said the lady, for I have seen you\noft or this, and I know you better than ye ween. But now an ye would\npromise me of your courtesy, for the harms that ye have done to me and\nmy Lord Belleus, that when he cometh unto Arthur's court for to cause\nhim to be made knight of the Round Table, for he is a passing good man\nof arms, and a mighty lord of lands of many out isles.\n\nFair lady, said Sir Launcelot, let him come unto the court the next high\nfeast, and look that ye come with him, and I shall do my power, an ye\nprove you doughty of your hands, that ye shall have your desire. So\nthus within a while, as they thus talked, the night passed, and the day\nshone, and then Sir Launcelot armed him, and took his horse, and they\ntaught him to the Abbey, and thither he rode within the space of two\nhours.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot was received of King Bagdemagus' daughter,\nand how he made his complaint to her father.\n\nAND soon as Sir Launcelot came within the abbey yard, the daughter of\nKing Bagdemagus heard a great horse go on the pavement. And she then\narose and yede unto a window, and there she saw Sir Launcelot, and anon\nshe made men fast to take his horse from him and let lead him into a\nstable, and himself was led into a fair chamber, and unarmed him, and\nthe lady sent him a long gown, and anon she came herself. And then she\nmade Launcelot passing good cheer, and she said he was the knight in the\nworld was most welcome to her. Then in all haste she sent for her father\nBagdemagus that was within twelve mile of that Abbey, and afore even he\ncame, with a fair fellowship of knights with him. And when the king was\nalighted off his horse he yode straight unto Sir Launcelot's chamber and\nthere he found his daughter, and then the king embraced Sir Launcelot in\nhis arms, and either made other good cheer.\n\nAnon Sir Launcelot made his complaint unto the king how he was betrayed,\nand how his brother Sir Lionel was departed from him he wist not where,\nand how his daughter had delivered him out of prison; Therefore while I\nlive I shall do her service and all her kindred. Then am I sure of\nyour help, said the king, on Tuesday next coming. Yea, sir, said Sir\nLauncelot, I shall not fail you, for so I have promised my lady your\ndaughter. But, sir, what knights be they of my lord Arthur's that were\nwith the King of Northgalis? And the king said it was Sir Mador de\nla Porte, and Sir Mordred and Sir Gahalantine that all for-fared my\nknights, for against them three I nor my knights might bear no strength.\nSir, said Sir Launcelot, as I hear say that the tournament shall be\nhere within this three mile of this abbey, ye shall send unto me three\nknights of yours, such as ye trust, and look that the three knights have\nall white shields, and I also, and no painture on the shields, and we\nfour will come out of a little wood in midst of both parties, and we\nshall fall in the front of our enemies and grieve them that we may; and\nthus shall I not be known what knight I am.\n\nSo they took their rest that night, and this was on the Sunday, and so\nthe king departed, and sent unto Sir Launcelot three knights with the\nfour white shields. And on the Tuesday they lodged them in a little\nleaved wood beside there the tournament should be. And there were\nscaffolds and holes that lords and ladies might behold and to give the\nprize. Then came into the field the King of Northgalis with eight score\nhelms. And then the three knights of Arthur's stood by themselves. Then\ncame into the field King Bagdemagus with four score of helms. And then\nthey feutred their spears, and came together with a great dash, and\nthere were slain of knights at the first recounter twelve of King\nBagdemagus' party, and six of the King of Northgalis' party, and King\nBagdemagus' party was far set aback.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. How Sir Launcelot behaved him in a tournament, and how he\nmet with Sir Turquine leading Sir Gaheris.\n\nWITH that came Sir Launcelot du Lake, and he thrust in with his spear in\nthe thickest of the press, and there he smote down with one spear five\nknights, and of four of them he brake their backs. And in that throng he\nsmote down the King of Northgalis, and brake his thigh in that fall. All\nthis doing of Sir Launcelot saw the three knights of Arthur's. Yonder is\na shrewd guest, said Sir Mador de la Porte, therefore have here once at\nhim. So they encountered, and Sir Launcelot bare him down horse and man,\nso that his shoulder went out of lith. Now befalleth it to me to joust,\nsaid Mordred, for Sir Mador hath a sore fall. Sir Launcelot was ware\nof him, and gat a great spear in his hand, and met him, and Sir Mordred\nbrake a spear upon him, and Sir Launcelot gave him such a buffet that\nthe arson of his saddle brake, and so he flew over his horse's tail,\nthat his helm butted into the earth a foot and more, that nigh his neck\nwas broken, and there he lay long in a swoon.\n\nThen came in Sir Gahalantine with a great spear and Launcelot against\nhim, with all their strength that they might drive, that both their\nspears to-brast even to their hands, and then they flang out with their\nswords and gave many a grim stroke. Then was Sir Launcelot wroth out\nof measure, and then he smote Sir Gahalantine on the helm that his nose\nbrast out on blood, and ears and mouth both, and therewith his head hung\nlow. And therewith his horse ran away with him, and he fell down to the\nearth. Anon therewithal Sir Launcelot gat a great spear in his hand,\nand or ever that great spear brake, he bare down to the earth sixteen\nknights, some horse and man, and some the man and not the horse, and\nthere was none but that he hit surely, he bare none arms that day. And\nthen he gat another great spear, and smote down twelve knights, and the\nmost part of them never throve after. And then the knights of the King\nof Northgalis would joust no more. And there the gree was given to King\nBagdemagus.\n\nSo either party departed unto his own place, and Sir Launcelot rode\nforth with King Bagdemagus unto his castle, and there he had passing\ngood cheer both with the king and with his daughter, and they proffered\nhim great gifts. And on the morn he took his leave, and told the king\nthat he would go and seek his brother Sir Lionel, that went from him\nwhen that he slept, so he took his horse, and betaught them all to God.\nAnd there he said unto the king's daughter, If ye have need any time of\nmy service I pray you let me have knowledge, and I shall not fail you\nas I am true knight. And so Sir Launcelot departed, and by adventure he\ncame into the same forest there he was taken sleeping. And in the midst\nof a highway he met a damosel riding on a white palfrey, and there\neither saluted other. Fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, know ye in\nthis country any adventures? Sir knight, said that damosel, here are\nadventures near hand, an thou durst prove them. Why should I not prove\nadventures? said Sir Launcelot for that cause come I hither. Well, said\nshe, thou seemest well to be a good knight, and if thou dare meet with\na good knight, I shall bring thee where is the best knight, and the\nmightiest that ever thou found, so thou wilt tell me what is thy name,\nand what knight thou art. Damosel, as for to tell thee my name I take no\ngreat force; truly my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Sir, thou beseemest\nwell, here be adventures by that fall for thee, for hereby dwelleth a\nknight that will not be overmatched for no man I know but ye overmatch\nhim, and his name is Sir Turquine. And, as I understand, he hath in his\nprison, of Arthur's court, good knights three score and four, that he\nhath won with his own hands. But when ye have done that journey ye shall\npromise me as ye are a true knight for to go with me, and to help me and\nother damosels that are distressed daily with a false knight. All your\nintent, damosel, and desire I will fulfil, so ye will bring me unto this\nknight. Now, fair knight, come on your way; and so she brought him unto\nthe ford and the tree where hung the basin.\n\nSo Sir Launcelot let his horse drink, and then he beat on the basin with\nthe butt of his spear so hard with all his might till the bottom fell\nout, and long he did so, but he saw nothing. Then he rode endlong the\ngates of that manor nigh half-an-hour. And then was he ware of a great\nknight that drove an horse afore him, and overthwart the horse there\nlay an armed knight bound. And ever as they came near and near, Sir\nLauncelot thought he should know him. Then Sir Launcelot was ware that\nit was Sir Gaheris, Gawaine's brother, a knight of the Table Round.\nNow, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, I see yonder cometh a knight fast\nbounden that is a fellow of mine, and brother he is unto Sir Gawaine.\nAnd at the first beginning I promise you, by the leave of God, to rescue\nthat knight; but if his master sit better in the saddle I shall deliver\nall the prisoners that he hath out of danger, for I am sure he hath two\nbrethren of mine prisoners with him. By that time that either had seen\nother, they gripped their spears unto them. Now, fair knight, said\nSir Launcelot, put that wounded knight off the horse, and let him rest\nawhile, and let us two prove our strengths; for as it is informed me,\nthou doest and hast done great despite and shame unto knights of the\nRound Table, and therefore now defend thee. An thou be of the Table\nRound, said Turquine, I defy thee and all thy fellowship. That is\novermuch said, said Sir Launcelot.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Turquine fought together.\n\nAND then they put their spears in the rests, and came together with\ntheir horses as fast as they might run, and either smote other in midst\nof their shields, that both their horses' backs brast under them, and\nthe knights were both stonied. And as soon as they might avoid their\nhorses, they took their shields afore them, and drew out their swords,\nand came together eagerly, and either gave other many strong strokes,\nfor there might neither shields nor harness hold their strokes. And so\nwithin a while they had both grimly wounds, and bled passing grievously.\nThus they fared two hours or more trasing and rasing either other, where\nthey might hit any bare place.\n\nThen at the last they were breathless both, and stood leaning on their\nswords. Now fellow, said Sir Turquine, hold thy hand a while, and tell\nme what I shall ask thee. Say on. Then Turquine said, Thou art the\nbiggest man that ever I met withal, and the best breathed, and like one\nknight that I hate above all other knights; so be it that thou be not he\nI will lightly accord with thee, and for thy love I will deliver all the\nprisoners that I have, that is three score and four, so thou wilt tell\nme thy name. And thou and I we will be fellows together, and never to\nfail thee while that I live. It is well said, said Sir Launcelot, but\nsithen it is so that I may have thy friendship, what knight is he that\nthou so hatest above all other? Faithfully, said Sir Turquine, his name\nis Sir Launcelot du Lake, for he slew my brother, Sir Carados, at the\ndolorous tower, that was one of the best knights alive; and therefore\nhim I except of all knights, for may I once meet with him, the one of\nus shall make an end of other, I make mine avow. And for Sir Launcelot's\nsake I have slain an hundred good knights, and as many I have maimed all\nutterly that they might never after help themselves, and many have\ndied in prison, and yet have I three score and four, and all shall be\ndelivered so thou wilt tell me thy name, so be it that thou be not Sir\nLauncelot.\n\nNow, see I well, said Sir Launcelot, that such a man I might be, I might\nhave peace, and such a man I might be, that there should be war mortal\nbetwixt us. And now, sir knight, at thy request I will that thou wit and\nknow that I am Launcelot du Lake, King Ban's son of Benwick, and very\nknight of the Table Round. And now I defy thee, and do thy best. Ah,\nsaid Turquine, Launcelot, thou art unto me most welcome that ever was\nknight, for we shall never depart till the one of us be dead. Then\nthey hurtled together as two wild bulls rushing and lashing with their\nshields and swords, that sometime they fell both over their noses. Thus\nthey fought still two hours and more, and never would have rest, and Sir\nTurquine gave Sir Launcelot many wounds that all the ground thereas they\nfought was all bespeckled with blood.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How Sir Turquine was slain, and how Sir Launcelot bade Sir\nGaheris deliver all the prisoners.\n\nTHEN at the last Sir Turquine waxed faint, and gave somewhat aback, and\nbare his shield low for weariness. That espied Sir Launcelot, and leapt\nupon him fiercely and gat him by the beaver of his helmet, and plucked\nhim down on his knees, and anon he raced off his helm, and smote his\nneck in sunder. And when Sir Launcelot had done this, he yode unto the\ndamosel and said, Damosel, I am ready to go with you where ye will have\nme, but I have no horse. Fair sir, said she, take this wounded knight's\nhorse and send him into this manor, and command him to deliver all the\nprisoners. So Sir Launcelot went unto Gaheris, and prayed him not to\nbe aggrieved for to lend him his horse. Nay, fair lord, said Gaheris,\nI will that ye take my horse at your own commandment, for ye have both\nsaved me and my horse, and this day I say ye are the best knight in the\nworld, for ye have slain this day in my sight the mightiest man and the\nbest knight except you that ever I saw, and, fair sir, said Gaheris, I\npray you tell me your name. Sir, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake, that\nought to help you of right for King Arthur's sake, and in especial for\nmy lord Sir Gawaine's sake, your own dear brother; and when that ye come\nwithin yonder manor, I am sure ye shall find there many knights of the\nRound Table, for I have seen many of their shields that I know on yonder\ntree. There is Kay's shield, and Sir Brandel's shield, and Sir Marhaus'\nshield, and Sir Galind's shield, and Sir Brian de Listnois' shield, and\nSir Aliduke's shield, with many more that I am not now advised of,\nand also my two brethren's shields, Sir Ector de Maris and Sir Lionel;\nwherefore I pray you greet them all from me, and say that I bid them\ntake such stuff there as they find, and that in any wise my brethren go\nunto the court and abide me there till that I come, for by the feast of\nPentecost I cast me to be there, for as at this time I must ride with\nthis damosel for to save my promise.\n\nAnd so he departed from Gaheris, and Gaheris yede in to the manor, and\nthere he found a yeoman porter keeping there many keys. Anon withal Sir\nGaheris threw the porter unto the ground and took the keys from him,\nand hastily he opened the prison door, and there he let out all the\nprisoners, and every man loosed other of their bonds. And when they saw\nSir Gaheris, all they thanked him, for they weened that he was wounded.\nNot so, said Gaheris, it was Launcelot that slew him worshipfully with\nhis own hands. I saw it with mine own eyes. And he greeteth you all\nwell, and prayeth you to haste you to the court; and as unto Sir Lionel\nand Ector de Maris he prayeth you to abide him at the court. That shall\nwe not do, says his brethren, we will find him an we may live. So shall\nI, said Sir Kay, find him or I come at the court, as I am true knight.\n\nThen all those knights sought the house thereas the armour was, and then\nthey armed them, and every knight found his own horse, and all that ever\nlonged unto him. And when this was done, there came a forester with four\nhorses laden with fat venison. Anon, Sir Kay said, Here is good meat for\nus for one meal, for we had not many a day no good repast. And so that\nvenison was roasted, baken, and sodden, and so after supper some abode\nthere all night, but Sir Lionel and Ector de Maris and Sir Kay rode\nafter Sir Launcelot to find him if they might.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How Sir Launcelot rode with a damosel and slew a knight that\ndistressed all ladies and also a villain that kept a bridge.\n\nNOW turn we unto Sir Launcelot, that rode with the damosel in a fair\nhighway. Sir, said the damosel, here by this way haunteth a knight that\ndistressed all ladies and gentlewomen, and at the least he robbeth them\nor lieth by them. What, said Sir Launcelot, is he a thief and a knight\nand a ravisher of women? he doth shame unto the order of knighthood, and\ncontrary unto his oath; it is pity that he liveth. But, fair damosel, ye\nshall ride on afore, yourself, and I will keep myself in covert, and if\nthat he trouble you or distress you I shall be your rescue and learn him\nto be ruled as a knight.\n\nSo the maid rode on by the way a soft ambling pace, and within a while\ncame out that knight on horseback out of the wood, and his page with\nhim, and there he put the damosel from her horse, and then she cried.\nWith that came Launcelot as fast as he might till he came to that\nknight, saying, O thou false knight and traitor unto knighthood, who did\nlearn thee to distress ladies and gentlewomen? When the knight saw Sir\nLauncelot thus rebuking him he answered not, but drew his sword and rode\nunto Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot threw his spear from him, and drew\nout his sword, and struck him such a buffet on the helmet that he clave\nhis head and neck unto the throat. Now hast thou thy payment that long\nthou hast deserved! That is truth, said the damosel, for like as Sir\nTurquine watched to destroy knights, so did this knight attend to\ndestroy and distress ladies, damosels, and gentlewomen, and his name was\nSir Peris de Forest Savage. Now, damosel, said Sir Launcelot, will ye\nany more service of me? Nay, sir, she said, at this time, but almighty\nJesu preserve you wheresomever ye ride or go, for the curteist knight\nthou art, and meekest unto all ladies and gentlewomen, that now liveth.\nBut one thing, sir knight, methinketh ye lack, ye that are a knight\nwifeless, that he will not love some maiden or gentlewoman, for I could\nnever hear say that ever ye loved any of no manner degree, and that is\ngreat pity; but it is noised that ye love Queen Guenever, and that she\nhath ordained by enchantment that ye shall never love none other but\nher, nor none other damosel nor lady shall rejoice you; wherefore many\nin this land, of high estate and low, make great sorrow.\n\nFair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, I may not warn people to speak of me\nwhat it pleaseth them; but for to be a wedded man, I think it not; for\nthen I must couch with her, and leave arms and tournaments, battles, and\nadventures; and as for to say for to take my pleasaunce with paramours,\nthat will I refuse in principal for dread of God; for knights that be\nadventurous or lecherous shall not be happy nor fortunate unto the wars,\nfor other they shall be overcome with a simpler knight than they be\nthemselves, other else they shall by unhap and their cursedness slay\nbetter men than they be themselves. And so who that useth paramours\nshall be unhappy, and all thing is unhappy that is about them.\n\nAnd so Sir Launcelot and she departed. And then he rode in a deep forest\ntwo days and more, and had strait lodging. So on the third day he rode\nover a long bridge, and there stert upon him suddenly a passing foul\nchurl, and he smote his horse on the nose that he turned about, and\nasked him why he rode over that bridge without his licence. Why should I\nnot ride this way? said Sir Launcelot, I may not ride beside. Thou shalt\nnot choose, said the churl, and lashed at him with a great club shod\nwith iron. Then Sir Launcelot drew his sword and put the stroke aback,\nand clave his head unto the paps. At the end of the bridge was a fair\nvillage, and all the people, men and women, cried on Sir Launcelot, and\nsaid, A worse deed didst thou never for thyself, for thou hast slain the\nchief porter of our castle. Sir Launcelot let them say what they would,\nand straight he went into the castle; and when he came into the castle\nhe alighted, and tied his horse to a ring on the wall and there he saw a\nfair green court, and thither he dressed him, for there him thought was\na fair place to fight in. So he looked about, and saw much people in\ndoors and windows that said, Fair knight, thou art unhappy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How Sir Launcelot slew two giants, and made a castle free.\n\nANON withal came there upon him two great giants, well armed all save\nthe heads, with two horrible clubs in their hands. Sir Launcelot put his\nshield afore him and put the stroke away of the one giant, and with his\nsword he clave his head asunder. When his fellow saw that, he ran away\nas he were wood, for fear of the horrible strokes, and Launcelot after\nhim with all his might, and smote him on the shoulder, and clave him to\nthe navel. Then Sir Launcelot went into the hall, and there came afore\nhim three score ladies and damosels, and all kneeled unto him, and\nthanked God and him of their deliverance; For sir, said they, the most\nparty of us have been here this seven year their prisoners, and we\nhave worked all manner of silk works for our meat, and we are all great\ngentlewomen born; and blessed be the time, knight, that ever thou be\nborn, for thou hast done the most worship that ever did knight in this\nworld, that will we bear record, and we all pray you to tell us your\nname, that we may tell our friends who delivered us out of prison. Fair\ndamosel, he said, my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Ah, sir, said they\nall, well mayest thou be he, for else save yourself, as we deemed, there\nmight never knight have the better of these two giants; for many fair\nknights have assayed it, and here have ended, and many times have we\nwished after you, and these two giants dread never knight but you.\nNow may ye say, said Sir Launcelot, unto your friends how and who hath\ndelivered you, and greet them all from me, and if that I come in any\nof your marches, show me such cheer as ye have cause, and what treasure\nthat there in this castle is I give it you for a reward for your\ngrievance, and the lord that is owner of this castle I would he\nreceived it as is right. Fair sir, said they, the name of this castle is\nTintagil, and a duke ought it sometime that had wedded fair Igraine, and\nafter wedded her Uther Pendragon, and gat on her Arthur. Well, said Sir\nLauncelot, I understand to whom this castle longeth; and so he departed\nfrom them, and betaught them unto God.\n\nAnd then he mounted upon his horse, and rode into many strange and wild\ncountries, and through many waters and valleys, and evil was he lodged.\nAnd at the last by fortune him happened, against a night, to come to a\nfair courtelage, and therein he found an old gentlewoman that lodged him\nwith good will, and there he had good cheer for him and his horse. And\nwhen time was, his host brought him into a fair garret, over the gate,\nto his bed. There Sir Launcelot unarmed him, and set his harness by him,\nand went to bed, and anon he fell asleep. So, soon after, there came\none on horseback, and knocked at the gate in great haste, and when Sir\nLauncelot heard this, he arose up and looked out at the window, and saw\nby the moonlight three knights came riding after that one man, and all\nthree lashed on him at once with swords, and that one knight turned on\nthem knightly again, and defended him. Truly, said Sir Launcelot, yonder\none knight shall I help, for it were shame for me to see three knights\non one, and if he be slain I am partner of his death; and therewith he\ntook his harness, and went out at a window by a sheet down to the four\nknights, and then Sir Launcelot said on high, Turn you knights unto me,\nand leave your fighting with that knight. And then they all three left\nSir Kay, and turned unto Sir Launcelot, and there began great battle,\nfor they alighted all three, and struck many great strokes at Sir\nLauncelot, and assailed him on every side. Then Sir Kay dressed him for\nto have holpen Sir Launcelot. Nay, sir, said he, I will none of your\nhelp; therefore as ye will have my help, let me alone with them. Sir\nKay, for the pleasure of the knight, suffered him for to do his will,\nand so stood aside. And then anon within six strokes, Sir Launcelot had\nstricken them to the earth.\n\nAnd then they all three cried: Sir knight, we yield us unto you as a man\nof might makeless. As to that, said Sir Launcelot, I will not take\nyour yielding unto me. But so that ye will yield you unto Sir Kay the\nSeneschal, on that covenant I will save your lives, and else not. Fair\nknight, said they, that were we loath to do; for as for Sir Kay, we\nchased him hither, and had overcome him had not ye been, therefore to\nyield us unto him it were no reason. Well, as to that, said Launcelot,\nadvise you well, for ye may choose whether ye will die or live, for an\nye be yolden it shall be unto Sir Kay. Fair knight, then they said, in\nsaving of our lives we will do as thou commandest us. Then shall ye,\nsaid Sir Launcelot, on Whitsunday next coming, go unto the court of King\nArthur, and there shall ye yield you unto Queen Guenever, and put you\nall three in her grace and mercy, and say that Sir Kay sent you thither\nto be her prisoners. Sir, they said, it shall be done by the faith of\nour bodies, an we be living, and there they swore every knight upon his\nsword. And so Sir Launcelot suffered them so to depart. And then Sir\nLauncelot knocked at the gate with the pommel of his sword, and with\nthat came his host, and in they entered Sir Kay and he. Sir, said his\nhost, I weened ye had been in your bed. So I was, said Sir Launcelot,\nbut I rose and leapt out at my window for to help an old fellow of mine.\nAnd so when they came nigh the light, Sir Kay knew well that it was\nSir Launcelot, and therewith he kneeled down and thanked him of all his\nkindness that he had holpen him twice from the death. Sir, he said, I\nhave nothing done but that me ought for to do, and ye are welcome, and\nhere shall ye repose you and take your rest.\n\nSo when Sir Kay was unarmed, he asked after meat; so there was meat\nfetched him, and he ate strongly. And when he had supped they went\nto their beds and were lodged together in one bed. On the morn Sir\nLauncelot arose early, and left Sir Kay sleeping, and Sir Launcelot took\nSir Kay's armour and his shield, and armed him, and so he went to the\nstable, and took his horse, and took his leave of his host, and so he\ndeparted. Then soon after arose Sir Kay and missed Sir Launcelot. And\nthen he espied that he had his armour and his horse. Now by my faith I\nknow well that he will grieve some of the court of King Arthur; for on\nhim knights will be bold, and deem that it is I, and that will beguile\nthem. And because of his armour and shield I am sure I shall ride in\npeace. And then soon after departed Sir Kay and thanked his host.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How Sir Launcelot rode disguised in Sir Kay's harness, and\nhow he smote down a knight.\n\nNOW turn we unto Sir Launcelot that had ridden long in a great forest,\nand at the last he came into a low country, full of fair rivers and\nmeadows. And afore him he saw a long bridge, and three pavilions stood\nthereon, of silk and sendal of divers hue. And without the pavilions\nhung three white shields on truncheons of spears, and great long spears\nstood upright by the pavilions, and at every pavilion's door stood three\nfresh squires, and so Sir Launcelot passed by them and spake no word.\nWhen he was passed the three knights said them that it was the proud\nKay; He weeneth no knight so good as he, and the contrary is ofttime\nproved. By my faith, said one of the knights, his name was Sir Gaunter,\nI will ride after him and assay him for all his pride, and ye may behold\nhow that I speed. So this knight, Sir Gaunter, armed him, and hung his\nshield upon his shoulder, and mounted upon a great horse, and gat his\nspear in his hand, and walloped after Sir Launcelot. And when he came\nnigh him, he cried, Abide, thou proud knight Sir Kay, for thou shalt not\npass quit. So Sir Launcelot turned him, and either feutred their spears,\nand came together with all their mights, and Sir Gaunter's spear brake,\nbut Sir Launcelot smote him down horse and man. And when Sir Gaunter was\nat the earth his brethren said each one to other, Yonder knight is not\nSir Kay, for he is bigger than he. I dare lay my head, said Sir Gilmere,\nyonder knight hath slain Sir Kay and hath taken his horse and his\nharness. Whether it be so or no, said Sir Raynold, the third brother,\nlet us now go mount upon our horses and rescue our brother Sir Gaunter,\nupon pain of death. We all shall have work enough to match that knight,\nfor ever meseemeth by his person it is Sir Launcelot, or Sir Tristram,\nor Sir Pelleas, the good knight.\n\nThen anon they took their horses and overtook Sir Launcelot, and Sir\nGilmere put forth his spear, and ran to Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot\nsmote him down that he lay in a swoon. Sir knight, said Sir Raynold,\nthou art a strong man, and as I suppose thou hast slain my two brethren,\nfor the which raseth my heart sore against thee, and if I might with\nmy worship I would not have ado with you, but needs I must take part\nas they do, and therefore, knight, he said, keep thyself. And so they\nhurtled together with all their mights, and all to-shivered both their\nspears. And then they drew their swords and lashed together eagerly.\nAnon therewith arose Sir Gaunter, and came unto his brother Sir Gilmere,\nand bade him, Arise, and help we our brother Sir Raynold, that yonder\nmarvellously matched yonder good knight. Therewithal, they leapt on\ntheir horses and hurtled unto Sir Launcelot.\n\nAnd when he saw them come he smote a sore stroke unto Sir Raynold, that\nhe fell off his horse to the ground, and then he struck to the other two\nbrethren, and at two strokes he struck them down to the earth. With\nthat Sir Raynold began to start up with his head all bloody, and came\nstraight unto Sir Launcelot. Now let be, said Sir Launcelot, I was not\nfar from thee when thou wert made knight, Sir Raynold, and also I know\nthou art a good knight, and loath I were to slay thee. Gramercy, said\nSir Raynold, as for your goodness; and I dare say as for me and my\nbrethren, we will not be loath to yield us unto you, with that we knew\nyour name, for well we know ye are not Sir Kay. As for that be it as it\nbe may, for ye shall yield you unto dame Guenever, and look that ye be\nwith her on Whitsunday, and yield you unto her as prisoners, and say\nthat Sir Kay sent you unto her. Then they swore it should be done, and\nso passed forth Sir Launcelot, and each one of the brethren holp other\nas well as they might.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. How Sir Launcelot jousted against four knights of the\nRound Table and overthrew them.\n\nSO Sir Launcelot rode into a deep forest, and thereby in a slade, he saw\nfour knights hoving under an oak, and they were of Arthur's court, one\nwas Sir Sagramour le Desirous, and Ector de Maris, and Sir Gawaine, and\nSir Uwaine. Anon as these four knights had espied Sir Launcelot, they\nweened by his arms it had been Sir Kay. Now by my faith, said Sir\nSagramour, I will prove Sir Kay's might, and gat his spear in his hand,\nand came toward Sir Launcelot. Therewith Sir Launcelot was ware and knew\nhim well, and feutred his spear against him, and smote Sir Sagramour so\nsore that horse and man fell both to the earth. Lo, my fellows, said he,\nyonder ye may see what a buffet he hath; that knight is much bigger than\never was Sir Kay. Now shall ye see what I may do to him. So Sir Ector\ngat his spear in his hand and walloped toward Sir Launcelot, and Sir\nLauncelot smote him through the shield and shoulder, that man and horse\nwent to the earth, and ever his spear held.\n\nBy my faith, said Sir Uwaine, yonder is a strong knight, and I am sure\nhe hath slain Sir Kay; and I see by his great strength it will be hard\nto match him. And therewithal, Sir Uwaine gat his spear in his hand and\nrode toward Sir Launcelot, and Sir Launcelot knew him well, and so he\nmet him on the plain, and gave him such a buffet that he was astonied,\nthat long he wist not where he was. Now see I well, said Sir Gawaine,\nI must encounter with that knight. Then he dressed his shield and gat a\ngood spear in his hand, and Sir Launcelot knew him well; and then they\nlet run their horses with all their mights, and either knight smote\nother in midst of the shield. But Sir Gawaine's spear to-brast, and Sir\nLauncelot charged so sore upon him that his horse reversed up-so-down.\nAnd much sorrow had Sir Gawaine to avoid his horse, and so Sir Launcelot\npassed on a pace and smiled, and said, God give him joy that this spear\nmade, for there came never a better in my hand.\n\nThen the four knights went each one to other and comforted each other.\nWhat say ye by this guest? said Sir Gawaine, that one spear hath felled\nus all four. We commend him unto the devil, they said all, for he is a\nman of great might. Ye may well say it, said Sir Gawaine, that he is a\nman of might, for I dare lay my head it is Sir Launcelot, I know it by\nhis riding. Let him go, said Sir Gawaine, for when we come to the court\nthen shall we wit; and then had they much sorrow to get their horses\nagain.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How Sir Launcelot followed a brachet into a castle, where\nhe found a dead knight, and how he after was required of a damosel to\nheal her brother.\n\nNOW leave we there and speak of Sir Launcelot that rode a great while in\na deep forest, where he saw a black brachet, seeking in manner as it\nhad been in the feute of an hurt deer. And therewith he rode after the\nbrachet, and he saw lie on the ground a large feute of blood. And then\nSir Launcelot rode after. And ever the brachet looked behind her, and\nso she went through a great marsh, and ever Sir Launcelot followed. And\nthen was he ware of an old manor, and thither ran the brachet, and so\nover the bridge. So Sir Launcelot rode over that bridge that was old and\nfeeble; and when he came in midst of a great hall, there he saw lie a\ndead knight that was a seemly man, and that brachet licked his wounds.\nAnd therewithal came out a lady weeping and wringing her hands; and then\nshe said, O knight, too much sorrow hast thou brought me. Why say ye so?\nsaid Sir Launcelot, I did never this knight no harm, for hither by\nfeute of blood this brachet brought me; and therefore, fair lady, be\nnot displeased with me, for I am full sore aggrieved of your grievance.\nTruly, sir, she said, I trow it be not ye that hath slain my husband,\nfor he that did that deed is sore wounded, and he is never likely to\nrecover, that shall I ensure him. What was your husband's name? said Sir\nLauncelot. Sir, said she, his name was called Sir Gilbert the Bastard,\none of the best knights of the world, and he that hath slain him I know\nnot his name. Now God send you better comfort, said Sir Launcelot; and\nso he departed and went into the forest again, and there he met with a\ndamosel, the which knew him well, and she said aloud, Well be ye found,\nmy lord; and now I require thee, on thy knighthood, help my brother that\nis sore wounded, and never stinteth bleeding; for this day he fought\nwith Sir Gilbert the Bastard and slew him in plain battle, and there was\nmy brother sore wounded, and there is a lady a sorceress that dwelleth\nin a castle here beside, and this day she told me my brother's wounds\nshould never be whole till I could find a knight that would go into the\nChapel Perilous, and there he should find a sword and a bloody cloth\nthat the wounded knight was lapped in, and a piece of that cloth and\nsword should heal my brother's wounds, so that his wounds were searched\nwith the sword and the cloth. This is a marvellous thing, said Sir\nLauncelot, but what is your brother's name? Sir, she said, his name was\nSir Meliot de Logres. That me repenteth, said Sir Launcelot, for he is\na fellow of the Table Round, and to his help I will do my power. Then,\nsir, said she, follow even this highway, and it will bring you unto the\nChapel Perilous; and here I shall abide till God send you here again,\nand, but you speed, I know no knight living that may achieve that\nadventure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. How Sir Launcelot came into the Chapel Perilous and gat\nthere of a dead corpse a piece of the cloth and a sword.\n\nRIGHT so Sir Launcelot departed, and when he came unto the Chapel\nPerilous he alighted down, and tied his horse unto a little gate. And as\nsoon as he was within the churchyard he saw on the front of the chapel\nmany fair rich shields turned up-so-down, and many of the shields Sir\nLauncelot had seen knights bear beforehand. With that he saw by him\nthere stand a thirty great knights, more by a yard than any man that\never he had seen, and all those grinned and gnashed at Sir Launcelot.\nAnd when he saw their countenance he dreaded him sore, and so put\nhis shield afore him, and took his sword ready in his hand ready unto\nbattle, and they were all armed in black harness ready with their\nshields and their swords drawn. And when Sir Launcelot would have gone\nthroughout them, they scattered on every side of him, and gave him the\nway, and therewith he waxed all bold, and entered into the chapel, and\nthen he saw no light but a dim lamp burning, and then was he ware of a\ncorpse hilled with a cloth of silk. Then Sir Launcelot stooped down, and\ncut a piece away of that cloth, and then it fared under him as the earth\nhad quaked a little; therewithal he feared. And then he saw a fair sword\nlie by the dead knight, and that he gat in his hand and hied him out of\nthe chapel.\n\nAnon as ever he was in the chapel yard all the knights spake to him with\na grimly voice, and said, Knight, Sir Launcelot, lay that sword from\nthee or else thou shalt die. Whether that I live or die, said Sir\nLauncelot, with no great word get ye it again, therefore fight for it an\nye list. Then right so he passed throughout them, and beyond the chapel\nyard there met him a fair damosel, and said, Sir Launcelot, leave that\nsword behind thee, or thou wilt die for it. I leave it not, said Sir\nLauncelot, for no treaties. No, said she, an thou didst leave that\nsword, Queen Guenever should thou never see. Then were I a fool an I\nwould leave this sword, said Launcelot. Now, gentle knight, said the\ndamosel, I require thee to kiss me but once. Nay, said Sir Launcelot,\nthat God me forbid. Well, sir, said she, an thou hadst kissed me thy\nlife days had been done, but now, alas, she said, I have lost all my\nlabour, for I ordained this chapel for thy sake, and for Sir Gawaine.\nAnd once I had Sir Gawaine within me, and at that time he fought with\nthat knight that lieth there dead in yonder chapel, Sir Gilbert the\nBastard; and at that time he smote the left hand off of Sir Gilbert the\nBastard. And, Sir Launcelot, now I tell thee, I have loved thee this\nseven year, but there may no woman have thy love but Queen Guenever. But\nsithen I may not rejoice thee to have thy body alive, I had kept no more\njoy in this world but to have thy body dead. Then would I have balmed it\nand served it, and so have kept it my life days, and daily I should\nhave clipped thee, and kissed thee, in despite of Queen Guenever. Ye say\nwell, said Sir Launcelot, Jesu preserve me from your subtle crafts. And\ntherewithal he took his horse and so departed from her. And as the book\nsaith, when Sir Launcelot was departed she took such sorrow that she\ndied within a fourteen night, and her name was Hellawes the sorceress,\nLady of the Castle Nigramous.\n\nAnon Sir Launcelot met with the damosel, Sir Meliot's sister. And when\nshe saw him she clapped her hands, and wept for joy. And then they rode\nunto a castle thereby where lay Sir Meliot. And anon as Sir Launcelot\nsaw him he knew him, but he was passing pale, as the earth, for\nbleeding. When Sir Meliot saw Sir Launcelot he kneeled upon his knees\nand cried on high: O lord Sir Launcelot, help me! Anon Sir Launcelot\nleapt unto him and touched his wounds with Sir Gilbert's sword. And then\nhe wiped his wounds with a part of the bloody cloth that Sir Gilbert was\nwrapped in, and anon an wholer man in his life was he never. And then\nthere was great joy between them, and they made Sir Launcelot all the\ncheer that they might, and so on the morn Sir Launcelot took his leave,\nand bade Sir Meliot hie him to the court of my lord Arthur, for it\ndraweth nigh to the Feast of Pentecost, and there by the grace of God ye\nshall find me. And therewith they departed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. How Sir Launcelot at the request of a lady recovered a\nfalcon, by which he was deceived.\n\nAND so Sir Launcelot rode through many strange countries, over marshes\nand valleys, till by fortune he came to a fair castle, and as he passed\nbeyond the castle him thought he heard two bells ring. And then was he\nware of a falcon came flying over his head toward an high elm, and long\nlunes about her feet, and as she flew unto the elm to take her perch the\nlunes over-cast about a bough. And when she would have taken her flight\nshe hung by the legs fast; and Sir Launcelot saw how she hung, and\nbeheld the fair falcon perigot, and he was sorry for her.\n\nThe meanwhile came a lady out of the castle and cried on high: O\nLauncelot, Launcelot, as thou art flower of all knights, help me to get\nmy hawk, for an my hawk be lost my lord will destroy me; for I kept the\nhawk and she slipped from me, and if my lord my husband wit it he is\nso hasty that he will slay me. What is your lord's name? said Sir\nLauncelot. Sir, she said, his name is Sir Phelot, a knight that longeth\nunto the King of Northgalis. Well, fair lady, since that ye know my\nname, and require me of knighthood to help you, I will do what I may to\nget your hawk, and yet God knoweth I am an ill climber, and the tree\nis passing high, and few boughs to help me withal. And therewith Sir\nLauncelot alighted, and tied his horse to the same tree, and prayed\nthe lady to unarm him. And so when he was unarmed, he put off all his\nclothes unto his shirt and breech, and with might and force he clomb up\nto the falcon, and tied the lines to a great rotten boyshe, and threw\nthe hawk down and it withal.\n\nAnon the lady gat the hawk in her hand; and therewithal came out Sir\nPhelot out of the groves suddenly, that was her husband, all armed and\nwith his naked sword in his hand, and said: O knight Launcelot, now have\nI found thee as I would, and stood at the bole of the tree to slay him.\nAh, lady, said Sir Launcelot, why have ye betrayed me? She hath done,\nsaid Sir Phelot, but as I commanded her, and therefore there nis none\nother boot but thine hour is come that thou must die. That were shame\nunto thee, said Sir Launcelot, thou an armed knight to slay a naked\nman by treason. Thou gettest none other grace, said Sir Phelot, and\ntherefore help thyself an thou canst. Truly, said Sir Launcelot, that\nshall be thy shame, but since thou wilt do none other, take mine harness\nwith thee, and hang my sword upon a bough that I may get it, and then do\nthy best to slay me an thou canst. Nay, nay, said Sir Phelot, for I know\nthee better than thou weenest, therefore thou gettest no weapon, an I\nmay keep you therefrom. Alas, said Sir Launcelot, that ever a knight\nshould die weaponless. And therewith he waited above him and under\nhim, and over his head he saw a rownsepyk, a big bough leafless, and\ntherewith he brake it off by the body. And then he came lower and\nawaited how his own horse stood, and suddenly he leapt on the further\nside of the horse, fro-ward the knight. And then Sir Phelot lashed at\nhim eagerly, weening to have slain him. But Sir Launcelot put away the\nstroke with the rownsepyk, and therewith he smote him on the one side\nof the head, that he fell down in a swoon to the ground. So then Sir\nLauncelot took his sword out of his hand, and struck his neck from the\nbody. Then cried the lady, Alas! why hast thou slain my husband? I am\nnot causer, said Sir Launcelot, for with falsehood ye would have had\nslain me with treason, and now it is fallen on you both. And then she\nswooned as though she would die. And therewithal Sir Launcelot gat all\nhis armour as well as he might, and put it upon him for dread of more\nresort, for he dreaded that the knight's castle was so nigh. And so, as\nsoon as he might, he took his horse and departed, and thanked God that\nhe had escaped that adventure.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. How Sir Launcelot overtook a knight which chased his wife\nto have slain her, and how he said to him.\n\nSO Sir Launcelot rode many wild ways, throughout marches and many wild\nways. And as he rode in a valley he saw a knight chasing a lady, with\na naked sword, to have slain her. And by fortune as this knight should\nhave slain this lady, she cried on Sir Launcelot and prayed him to\nrescue her. When Sir Launcelot saw that mischief, he took his horse and\nrode between them, saying, Knight, fie for shame, why wilt thou slay\nthis lady? thou dost shame unto thee and all knights. What hast thou to\ndo betwixt me and my wife? said the knight. I will slay her maugre thy\nhead. That shall ye not, said Sir Launcelot, for rather we two will have\nado together. Sir Launcelot, said the knight, thou dost not thy part,\nfor this lady hath betrayed me. It is not so, said the lady, truly he\nsaith wrong on me. And for because I love and cherish my cousin germain,\nhe is jealous betwixt him and me; and as I shall answer to God there was\nnever sin betwixt us. But, sir, said the lady, as thou art called the\nworshipfullest knight of the world, I require thee of true knighthood,\nkeep me and save me. For whatsomever ye say he will slay me, for he is\nwithout mercy. Have ye no doubt, said Launcelot, it shall not lie in his\npower. Sir, said the knight, in your sight I will be ruled as ye will\nhave me. And so Sir Launcelot rode on the one side and she on the other:\nhe had not ridden but a while, but the knight bade Sir Launcelot turn\nhim and look behind him, and said, Sir, yonder come men of arms after\nus riding. And so Sir Launcelot turned him and thought no treason,\nand therewith was the knight and the lady on one side, and suddenly he\nswapped off his lady's head.\n\nAnd when Sir Launcelot had espied him what he had done, he said, and\ncalled him, Traitor, thou hast shamed me for ever. And suddenly Sir\nLauncelot alighted off his horse, and pulled out his sword to slay him,\nand therewithal he fell flat to the earth, and gripped Sir Launcelot\nby the thighs, and cried mercy. Fie on thee, said Sir Launcelot, thou\nshameful knight, thou mayest have no mercy, and therefore arise and\nfight with me. Nay, said the knight, I will never arise till ye grant\nme mercy. Now will I proffer thee fair, said Launcelot, I will unarm\nme unto my shirt, and I will have nothing upon me but my shirt, and my\nsword and my hand. And if thou canst slay me, quit be thou for ever.\nNay, sir, said Pedivere, that will I never. Well, said Sir Launcelot,\ntake this lady and the head, and bear it upon thee, and here shalt thou\nswear upon my sword, to bear it always upon thy back, and never to rest\ntill thou come to Queen Guenever. Sir, said he, that will I do, by the\nfaith of my body. Now, said Launcelot, tell me what is your name? Sir,\nmy name is Pedivere. In a shameful hour wert thou born, said Launcelot.\n\nSo Pedivere departed with the dead lady and the head, and found the\nqueen with King Arthur at Winchester, and there he told all the truth.\nSir knight, said the queen, this is an horrible deed and a shameful, and\na great rebuke unto Sir Launcelot; but notwithstanding his worship\nis not known in many divers countries; but this shall I give you in\npenance, make ye as good shift as ye can, ye shall bear this lady with\nyou on horseback unto the Pope of Rome, and of him receive your penance\nfor your foul deeds; and ye shall never rest one night whereas ye do\nanother; an ye go to any bed the dead body shall lie with you. This oath\nthere he made, and so departed. And as it telleth in the French book,\nwhen he came to Rome, the Pope bade him go again unto Queen Guenever,\nand in Rome was his lady buried by the Pope's commandment. And after\nthis Sir Pedivere fell to great goodness, and was an holy man and an\nhermit.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. How Sir Launcelot came to King Arthur's Court, and how\nthere were recounted all his noble feats and acts.\n\nNOW turn we unto Sir Launcelot du Lake, that came home two days afore\nthe Feast of Pentecost; and the king and all the court were passing\nfain of his coming. And when Sir Gawaine, Sir Uwaine, Sir Sagramore, Sir\nEctor de Maris, saw Sir Launcelot in Kay's armour, then they wist\nwell it was he that smote them down all with one spear. Then there\nwas laughing and smiling among them. And ever now and now came all the\nknights home that Sir Turquine had prisoners, and they all honoured and\nworshipped Sir Launcelot.\n\nWhen Sir Gaheris heard them speak, he said, I saw all the battle from\nthe beginning to the ending, and there he told King Arthur all how it\nwas, and how Sir Turquine was the strongest knight that ever he saw\nexcept Sir Launcelot: there were many knights bare him record, nigh\nthree score. Then Sir Kay told the king how Sir Launcelot had rescued\nhim when he should have been slain, and how he made the knights yield\nthem to me, and not to him. And there they were all three, and bare\nrecord. And by Jesu, said Sir Kay, because Sir Launcelot took my harness\nand left me his I rode in good peace, and no man would have ado with me.\n\nAnon therewithal there came the three knights that fought with Sir\nLauncelot at the long bridge. And there they yielded them unto Sir Kay,\nand Sir Kay forsook them and said he fought never with them. But I shall\nease your heart, said Sir Kay, yonder is Sir Launcelot that overcame\nyou. When they wist that they were glad. And then Sir Meliot de Logres\ncame home, and told the king how Sir Launcelot had saved him from the\ndeath. And all his deeds were known, how four queens, sorceresses, had\nhim in prison, and how he was delivered by King Bagdemagus' daughter.\nAlso there were told all the great deeds of arms that Sir Launcelot did\nbetwixt the two kings, that is for to say the King of Northgalis and\nKing Bagdemagus. All the truth Sir Gahalantine did tell, and Sir Mador\nde la Porte and Sir Mordred, for they were at that same tournament.\nThen came in the lady that knew Sir Launcelot when that he wounded Sir\nBelleus at the pavilion. And there, at request of Sir Launcelot, Sir\nBelleus was made knight of the Round Table. And so at that time Sir\nLauncelot had the greatest name of any knight of the world, and most he\nwas honoured of high and low.\n\nExplicit the noble tale of Sir Launcelot du Lake, which is the vi.\nbook. Here followeth the tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney that was called\nBeaumains by Sir Kay, and is the seventh book.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VII.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How Beaumains came to King Arthur's Court and demanded three\npetitions of King Arthur.\n\nWHEN Arthur held his Round Table most plenour, it fortuned that he\ncommanded that the high feast of Pentecost should be holden at a city\nand a castle, the which in those days was called Kynke Kenadonne, upon\nthe sands that marched nigh Wales. So ever the king had a custom that at\nthe feast of Pentecost in especial, afore other feasts in the year,\nhe would not go that day to meat until he had heard or seen of a great\nmarvel. And for that custom all manner of strange adventures came before\nArthur as at that feast before all other feasts. And so Sir Gawaine, a\nlittle to-fore noon of the day of Pentecost, espied at a window three\nmen upon horseback, and a dwarf on foot, and so the three men alighted,\nand the dwarf kept their horses, and one of the three men was higher\nthan the other twain by a foot and an half. Then Sir Gawaine went unto\nthe king and said, Sir, go to your meat, for here at the hand come\nstrange adventures. So Arthur went unto his meat with many other kings.\nAnd there were all the knights of the Round Table, [save] only those\nthat were prisoners or slain at a recounter. Then at the high feast\nevermore they should be fulfilled the whole number of an hundred and\nfifty, for then was the Round Table fully complished.\n\nRight so came into the hall two men well beseen and richly, and upon\ntheir shoulders there leaned the goodliest young man and the fairest\nthat ever they all saw, and he was large and long, and broad in the\nshoulders, and well visaged, and the fairest and the largest handed that\never man saw, but he fared as though he might not go nor bear himself\nbut if he leaned upon their shoulders. Anon as Arthur saw him there was\nmade peace and room, and right so they yede with him unto the high dais,\nwithout saying of any words. Then this much young man pulled him aback,\nand easily stretched up straight, saying, King Arthur, God you bless and\nall your fair fellowship, and in especial the fellowship of the Table\nRound. And for this cause I am come hither, to pray you and require you\nto give me three gifts, and they shall not be unreasonably asked, but\nthat ye may worshipfully and honourably grant them me, and to you no\ngreat hurt nor loss. And the first don and gift I will ask now, and the\nother two gifts I will ask this day twelvemonth, wheresomever ye hold\nyour high feast. Now ask, said Arthur, and ye shall have your asking.\n\nNow, sir, this is my petition for this feast, that ye will give me meat\nand drink sufficiently for this twelvemonth, and at that day I will ask\nmine other two gifts.\n\nMy fair son, said Arthur, ask better, I counsel thee, for this is but\na simple asking; for my heart giveth me to thee greatly, that thou art\ncome of men of worship, and greatly my conceit faileth me but thou shalt\nprove a man of right great worship. Sir, he said, thereof be as it be\nmay, I have asked that I will ask. Well, said the king, ye shall have\nmeat and drink enough; I never defended that none, neither my friend nor\nmy foe. But what is thy name I would wit? I cannot tell you, said he.\nThat is marvel, said the king, that thou knowest not thy name, and thou\nart the goodliest young man that ever I saw. Then the king betook him\nto Sir Kay the steward, and charged him that he should give him of all\nmanner of meats and drinks of the best, and also that he had all manner\nof finding as though he were a lord's son. That shall little need, said\nSir Kay, to do such cost upon him; for I dare undertake he is a villain\nborn, and never will make man, for an he had come of gentlemen he would\nhave asked of you horse and armour, but such as he is, so he asketh. And\nsithen he hath no name, I shall give him a name that shall be Beaumains,\nthat is Fair-hands, and into the kitchen I shall bring him, and there\nhe shall have fat brose every day, that he shall be as fat by the\ntwelvemonths' end as a pork hog. Right so the two men departed and\nbeleft him to Sir Kay, that scorned him and mocked him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine were wroth because Sir Kay\nmocked Beaumains, and of a damosel which desired a knight to fight for a\nlady.\n\nTHEREAT was Sir Gawaine wroth, and in especial Sir Launcelot bade Sir\nKay leave his mocking, for I dare lay my head he shall prove a man of\ngreat worship. Let be said Sir Kay, it may not be by no reason, for as\nhe is, so he hath asked. Beware, said Sir Launcelot, so ye gave the good\nknight Brewnor, Sir Dinadan's brother, a name, and ye called him La Cote\nMale Taile, and that turned you to anger afterward. As for that, said\nSir Kay, this shall never prove none such. For Sir Brewnor desired ever\nworship, and this desireth bread and drink and broth; upon pain of my\nlife he was fostered up in some abbey, and, howsomever it was, they\nfailed meat and drink, and so hither he is come for his sustenance.\n\nAnd so Sir Kay bade get him a place, and sit down to meat; so Beaumains\nwent to the hall door, and set him down among boys and lads, and there\nhe ate sadly. And then Sir Launcelot after meat bade him come to his\nchamber, and there he should have meat and drink enough. And so did Sir\nGawaine: but he refused them all; he would do none other but as Sir\nKay commanded him, for no proffer. But as touching Sir Gawaine, he had\nreason to proffer him lodging, meat, and drink, for that proffer came\nof his blood, for he was nearer kin to him than he wist. But that as Sir\nLauncelot did was of his great gentleness and courtesy.\n\nSo thus he was put into the kitchen, and lay nightly as the boys of\nthe kitchen did. And so he endured all that twelvemonth, and never\ndispleased man nor child, but always he was meek and mild. But ever when\nthat he saw any jousting of knights, that would he see an he might. And\never Sir Launcelot would give him gold to spend, and clothes, and so did\nSir Gawaine, and where there were any masteries done, thereat would he\nbe, and there might none cast bar nor stone to him by two yards. Then\nwould Sir Kay say, How liketh you my boy of the kitchen? So it passed\non till the feast of Whitsuntide. And at that time the king held it at\nCarlion in the most royallest wise that might be, like as he did yearly.\nBut the king would no meat eat upon the Whitsunday, until he heard some\nadventures. Then came there a squire to the king and said, Sir, ye may\ngo to your meat, for here cometh a damosel with some strange adventures.\nThen was the king glad and sat him down.\n\nRight so there came a damosel into the hall and saluted the king, and\nprayed him of succour. For whom? said the king, what is the adventure?\n\nSir, she said, I have a lady of great worship and renown, and she is\nbesieged with a tyrant, so that she may not out of her castle; and\nbecause here are called the noblest knights of the world, I come to you\nto pray you of succour. What hight your lady, and where dwelleth she,\nand who is she, and what is his name that hath besieged her? Sir king,\nshe said, as for my lady's name that shall not ye know for me as at\nthis time, but I let you wit she is a lady of great worship and of\ngreat lands; and as for the tyrant that besiegeth her and destroyeth her\nlands, he is called the Red Knight of the Red Launds. I know him not,\nsaid the king. Sir, said Sir Gawaine, I know him well, for he is one of\nthe perilloust knights of the world; men say that he hath seven men's\nstrength, and from him I escaped once full hard with my life. Fair\ndamosel, said the king, there be knights here would do their power for\nto rescue your lady, but because you will not tell her name, nor where\nshe dwelleth, therefore none of my knights that here be now shall go\nwith you by my will. Then must I speak further, said the damosel.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How Beaumains desired the battle, and how it was granted to\nhim, and how he desired to be made knight of Sir Launcelot.\n\nWITH these words came before the king Beaumains, while the damosel\nwas there, and thus he said, Sir king, God thank you, I have been this\ntwelvemonth in your kitchen, and have had my full sustenance, and now I\nwill ask my two gifts that be behind. Ask, upon my peril, said the king.\nSir, this shall be my two gifts, first that ye will grant me to have\nthis adventure of the damosel, for it belongeth unto me. Thou shalt have\nit, said the king, I grant it thee. Then, sir, this is the other gift,\nthat ye shall bid Launcelot du Lake to make me knight, for of him I will\nbe made knight and else of none. And when I am passed I pray you let him\nride after me, and make me knight when I require him. All this shall be\ndone, said the king. Fie on thee, said the damosel, shall I have none\nbut one that is your kitchen page? Then was she wroth and took her horse\nand departed. And with that there came one to Beaumains and told him his\nhorse and armour was come for him; and there was the dwarf come with all\nthing that him needed, in the richest manner; thereat all the court had\nmuch marvel from whence came all that gear. So when he was armed there\nwas none but few so goodly a man as he was; and right so as he came into\nthe hall and took his leave of King Arthur, and Sir Gawaine, and Sir\nLauncelot, and prayed that he would hie after him, and so departed and\nrode after the damosel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How Beaumains departed, and how he gat of Sir Kay a spear\nand a shield, and how he jousted with Sir Launcelot.\n\nBUT there went many after to behold how well he was horsed and trapped\nin cloth of gold, but he had neither shield nor spear. Then Sir Kay said\nall open in the hall, I will ride after my boy in the kitchen, to wit\nwhether he will know me for his better. Said Sir Launcelot and Sir\nGawaine, Yet abide at home. So Sir Kay made him ready and took his horse\nand his spear, and rode after him. And right as Beaumains overtook the\ndamosel, right so came Sir Kay and said, Beaumains, what, sir, know ye\nnot me? Then he turned his horse, and knew it was Sir Kay, that had done\nhim all the despite as ye have heard afore. Yea, said Beaumains, I know\nyou for an ungentle knight of the court, and therefore beware of me.\nTherewith Sir Kay put his spear in the rest, and ran straight upon him;\nand Beaumains came as fast upon him with his sword in his hand, and so\nhe put away his spear with his sword, and with a foin thrust him through\nthe side, that Sir Kay fell down as he had been dead; and he alighted\ndown and took Sir Kay's shield and his spear, and stert upon his own\nhorse and rode his way.\n\nAll that saw Sir Launcelot, and so did the damosel. And then he bade his\ndwarf stert upon Sir Kay's horse, and so he did. By that Sir Launcelot\nwas come, then he proffered Sir Launcelot to joust; and either made them\nready, and they came together so fiercely that either bare down other\nto the earth, and sore were they bruised. Then Sir Launcelot arose and\nhelped him from his horse. And then Beaumains threw his shield from him,\nand proffered to fight with Sir Launcelot on foot; and so they rushed\ntogether like boars, tracing, rasing, and foining to the mountenance\nof an hour; and Sir Launcelot felt him so big that he marvelled of his\nstrength, for he fought more liker a giant than a knight, and that his\nfighting was durable and passing perilous. For Sir Launcelot had so much\nado with him that he dreaded himself to be shamed, and said, Beaumains,\nfight not so sore, your quarrel and mine is not so great but we may\nleave off. Truly that is truth, said Beaumains, but it doth me good to\nfeel your might, and yet, my lord, I showed not the utterance.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How Beaumains told to Sir Launcelot his name, and how he was\ndubbed knight of Sir Launcelot, and after overtook the damosel.\n\nIN God's name, said Sir Launcelot, for I promise you, by the faith of my\nbody, I had as much to do as I might to save myself from you unshamed,\nand therefore have ye no doubt of none earthly knight. Hope ye so that\nI may any while stand a proved knight? said Beaumains. Yea, said\nLauncelot, do as ye have done, and I shall be your warrant. Then, I pray\nyou, said Beaumains, give me the order of knighthood. Then must ye tell\nme your name, said Launcelot, and of what kin ye be born. Sir, so\nthat ye will not discover me I shall, said Beaumains. Nay, said Sir\nLauncelot, and that I promise you by the faith of my body, until it be\nopenly known. Then, sir, he said, my name is Gareth, and brother unto\nSir Gawaine of father and mother. Ah, sir, said Sir Launcelot, I am more\ngladder of you than I was; for ever me thought ye should be of great\nblood, and that ye came not to the court neither for meat nor for drink.\nAnd then Sir Launcelot gave him the order of knighthood, and then Sir\nGareth prayed him for to depart and let him go.\n\nSo Sir Launcelot departed from him and came to Sir Kay, and made him to\nbe borne home upon his shield, and so he was healed hard with the\nlife; and all men scorned Sir Kay, and in especial Sir Gawaine and Sir\nLauncelot said it was not his part to rebuke no young man, for full\nlittle knew he of what birth he is come, and for what cause he came to\nthis court; and so we leave Sir Kay and turn we unto Beaumains.\n\nWhen he had overtaken the damosel, anon she said, What dost thou here?\nthou stinkest all of the kitchen, thy clothes be bawdy of the grease and\ntallow that thou gainest in King Arthur's kitchen; weenest thou, said\nshe, that I allow thee, for yonder knight that thou killest. Nay truly,\nfor thou slewest him unhappily and cowardly; therefore turn again, bawdy\nkitchen page, I know thee well, for Sir Kay named thee Beaumains.\nWhat art thou but a lusk and a turner of broaches and a ladle-washer?\nDamosel, said Beaumains, say to me what ye will, I will not go from you\nwhatsomever ye say, for I have undertaken to King Arthur for to achieve\nyour adventure, and so shall I finish it to the end, either I shall die\ntherefore. Fie on thee, kitchen knave, wilt thou finish mine adventure?\nthou shalt anon be met withal, that thou wouldest not for all the broth\nthat ever thou suppest once look him in the face. I shall assay, said\nBeaumains.\n\nSo thus as they rode in the wood, there came a man flying all that ever\nhe might. Whither wilt thou? said Beaumains. O lord, he said, help me,\nfor here by in a slade are six thieves that have taken my lord and bound\nhim, so I am afeard lest they will slay him. Bring me thither, said\nBeaumains. And so they rode together until they came thereas was the\nknight bounden; and then he rode unto them, and struck one unto the\ndeath, and then another, and at the third stroke he slew the third\nthief, and then the other three fled. And he rode after them, and he\novertook them; and then those three thieves turned again and assailed\nBeaumains hard, but at the last he slew them, and returned and unbound\nthe knight. And the knight thanked him, and prayed him to ride with him\nto his castle there a little beside, and he should worshipfully reward\nhim for his good deeds. Sir, said Beaumains, I will no reward have: I\nwas this day made knight of noble Sir Launcelot, and therefore I will no\nreward have, but God reward me. And also I must follow this damosel.\n\nAnd when he came nigh her she bade him ride from her, For thou smellest\nall of the kitchen: weenest thou that I have joy of thee, for all this\ndeed that thou hast done is but mishapped thee: but thou shalt see a\nsight shall make thee turn again, and that lightly. Then the same knight\nwhich was rescued of the thieves rode after that damosel, and prayed\nher to lodge with him all that night. And because it was near night the\ndamosel rode with him to his castle, and there they had great cheer, and\nat supper the knight sat Sir Beaumains afore the damosel. Fie, fie, said\nshe, Sir knight, ye are uncourteous to set a kitchen page afore me; him\nbeseemeth better to stick a swine than to sit afore a damosel of high\nparage. Then the knight was ashamed at her words, and took him up, and\nset him at a sideboard, and set himself afore him, and so all that night\nthey had good cheer and merry rest.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How Beaumains fought and slew two knights at a passage.\n\nAND on the morn the damosel and he took their leave and thanked the\nknight, and so departed, and rode on their way until they came to a\ngreat forest. And there was a great river and but one passage, and there\nwere ready two knights on the farther side to let them the passage. What\nsayest thou, said the damosel, wilt thou match yonder knights or turn\nagain? Nay, said Sir Beaumains, I will not turn again an they were six\nmore. And therewithal he rushed into the water, and in midst of the\nwater either brake their spears upon other to their hands, and then\nthey drew their swords, and smote eagerly at other. And at the last\nSir Beaumains smote the other upon the helm that his head stonied, and\ntherewithal he fell down in the water, and there was he drowned. And\nthen he spurred his horse upon the land, where the other knight fell\nupon him, and brake his spear, and so they drew their swords and fought\nlong together. At the last Sir Beaumains clave his helm and his head\ndown to the shoulders; and so he rode unto the damosel and bade her ride\nforth on her way.\n\nAlas, she said, that ever a kitchen page should have that fortune to\ndestroy such two doughty knights: thou weenest thou hast done doughtily,\nthat is not so; for the first knight his horse stumbled, and there he\nwas drowned in the water, and never it was by thy force, nor by\nthy might. And the last knight by mishap thou camest behind him and\nmishappily thou slew him.\n\nDamosel, said Beaumains, ye may say what ye will, but with whomsomever I\nhave ado withal, I trust to God to serve him or he depart. And therefore\nI reck not what ye say, so that I may win your lady. Fie, fie, foul\nkitchen knave, thou shalt see knights that shall abate thy boast. Fair\ndamosel, give me goodly language, and then my care is past, for what\nknights somever they be, I care not, nor I doubt them not. Also, said\nshe, I say it for thine avail, yet mayest thou turn again with thy\nworship; for an thou follow me, thou art but slain, for I see all that\never thou dost is but by misadventure, and not by prowess of thy hands.\nWell, damosel, ye may say what ye will, but wheresomever ye go I will\nfollow you. So this Beaumains rode with that lady till evensong time,\nand ever she chid him, and would not rest. And they came to a black\nlaund; and there was a black hawthorn, and thereon hung a black banner,\nand on the other side there hung a black shield, and by it stood a black\nspear great and long, and a great black horse covered with silk, and a\nblack stone fast by.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. How Beaumains fought with the Knight of the Black Launds,\nand fought with him till he fell down and died.\n\nTHERE sat a knight all armed in black harness, and his name was the\nKnight of the Black Laund. Then the damosel, when she saw that knight,\nshe bade him flee down that valley, for his horse was not saddled.\nGramercy, said Beaumains, for always ye would have me a coward. With\nthat the Black Knight, when she came nigh him, spake and said, Damosel,\nhave ye brought this knight of King Arthur to be your champion? Nay,\nfair knight, said she, this is but a kitchen knave that was fed in\nKing Arthur's kitchen for alms. Why cometh he, said the knight, in\nsuch array? it is shame that he beareth you company. Sir, I cannot be\ndelivered of him, said she, for with me he rideth maugre mine head: God\nwould that ye should put him from me, other to slay him an ye may, for\nhe is an unhappy knave, and unhappily he hath done this day: through\nmishap I saw him slay two knights at the passage of the water; and\nother deeds he did before right marvellous and through unhappiness. That\nmarvelleth me, said the Black Knight, that any man that is of worship\nwill have ado with him. They know him not, said the damosel, and for\nbecause he rideth with me, they ween that he be some man of worship\nborn. That may be, said the Black Knight; howbeit as ye say that he be\nno man of worship, he is a full likely person, and full like to be a\nstrong man: but thus much shall I grant you, said the Black Knight; I\nshall put him down upon one foot, and his horse and his harness he shall\nleave with me, for it were shame to me to do him any more harm.\n\nWhen Sir Beaumains heard him say thus, he said, Sir knight, thou art\nfull large of my horse and my harness; I let thee wit it cost thee\nnought, and whether it liketh thee or not, this laund will I pass maugre\nthine head. And horse nor harness gettest thou none of mine, but if\nthou win them with thy hands; and therefore let see what thou canst do.\nSayest thou that? said the Black Knight, now yield thy lady from thee,\nfor it beseemeth never a kitchen page to ride with such a lady. Thou\nliest, said Beaumains, I am a gentleman born, and of more high lineage\nthan thou, and that will I prove on thy body.\n\nThen in great wrath they departed with their horses, and came together\nas it had been the thunder, and the Black Knight's spear brake, and\nBeaumains thrust him through both his sides, and therewith his spear\nbrake, and the truncheon left still in his side. But nevertheless the\nBlack Knight drew his sword, and smote many eager strokes, and of great\nmight, and hurt Beaumains full sore. But at the last the Black Knight,\nwithin an hour and an half, he fell down off his horse in swoon, and\nthere he died. And when Beaumains saw him so well horsed and armed, then\nhe alighted down and armed him in his armour, and so took his horse and\nrode after the damosel.\n\nWhen she saw him come nigh, she said, Away, kitchen knave, out of the\nwind, for the smell of thy bawdy clothes grieveth me. Alas, she said,\nthat ever such a knave should by mishap slay so good a knight as thou\nhast done, but all this is thine unhappiness. But here by is one shall\npay thee all thy payment, and therefore yet I counsel thee, flee. It may\nhappen me, said Beaumains, to be beaten or slain, but I warn you, fair\ndamosel, I will not flee away, a nor leave your company, for all that\nye can say; for ever ye say that they will kill me or beat me, but\nhowsomever it happeneth I escape, and they lie on the ground. And\ntherefore it were as good for you to hold you still thus all day\nrebuking me, for away will I not till I see the uttermost of this\njourney, or else I will be slain, other truly beaten; therefore ride on\nyour way, for follow you I will whatsomever happen.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How the brother of the knight that was slain met with\nBeaumains, and fought with Beaumains till he was yielden.\n\nTHUS as they rode together, they saw a knight come driving by them all\nin green, both his horse and his harness; and when he came nigh the\ndamosel, he asked her, Is that my brother the Black Knight that ye have\nbrought with you? Nay, nay, she said, this unhappy kitchen knave hath\nslain your brother through unhappiness. Alas, said the Green Knight,\nthat is great pity, that so noble a knight as he was should so unhappily\nbe slain, and namely of a knave's hand, as ye say that he is. Ah!\ntraitor, said the Green Knight, thou shalt die for slaying of my\nbrother; he was a full noble knight, and his name was Sir Perard. I defy\nthee, said Beaumains, for I let thee wit I slew him knightly and not\nshamefully.\n\nTherewithal the Green Knight rode unto an horn that was green, and it\nhung upon a thorn, and there he blew three deadly motes, and there came\ntwo damosels and armed him lightly. And then he took a great horse, and\na green shield and a green spear. And then they ran together with all\ntheir mights, and brake their spears unto their hands. And then they\ndrew their swords, and gave many sad strokes, and either of them wounded\nother full ill. And at the last, at an overthwart, Beaumains with his\nhorse struck the Green Knight's horse upon the side, that he fell to the\nearth. And then the Green Knight avoided his horse lightly, and dressed\nhim upon foot. That saw Beaumains, and therewithal he alighted, and they\nrushed together like two mighty kemps a long while, and sore they bled\nboth. With that came the damosel, and said, My lord the Green Knight,\nwhy for shame stand ye so long fighting with the kitchen knave? Alas, it\nis shame that ever ye were made knight, to see such a lad to match such\na knight, as the weed overgrew the corn. Therewith the Green Knight was\nashamed, and therewithal he gave a great stroke of might, and clave his\nshield through. When Beaumains saw his shield cloven asunder he was a\nlittle ashamed of that stroke and of her language; and then he gave him\nsuch a buffet upon the helm that he fell on his knees. And so suddenly\nBeaumains pulled him upon the ground grovelling. And then the Green\nKnight cried him mercy, and yielded him unto Sir Beaumains, and prayed\nhim to slay him not. All is in vain, said Beaumains, for thou shalt\ndie but if this damosel that came with me pray me to save thy life.\nAnd therewithal he unlaced his helm like as he would slay him. Fie upon\nthee, false kitchen page, I will never pray thee to save his life, for I\nwill never be so much in thy danger. Then shall he die, said Beaumains.\nNot so hardy, thou bawdy knave, said the damosel, that thou slay him.\nAlas, said the Green Knight, suffer me not to die for a fair word may\nsave me. Fair knight, said the Green Knight, save my life, and I will\nforgive thee the death of my brother, and for ever to become thy man,\nand thirty knights that hold of me for ever shall do you service. In the\ndevil's name, said the damosel, that such a bawdy kitchen knave should\nhave thee and thirty knights' service.\n\nSir knight, said Beaumains, all this availeth thee not, but if my\ndamosel speak with me for thy life. And therewithal he made a semblant\nto slay him. Let be, said the damosel, thou bawdy knave; slay him not,\nfor an thou do thou shalt repent it. Damosel, said Beaumains, your\ncharge is to me a pleasure, and at your commandment his life shall be\nsaved, and else not. Then he said, Sir knight with the green arms, I\nrelease thee quit at this damosel's request, for I will not make her\nwroth, I will fulfil all that she chargeth me. And then the Green Knight\nkneeled down, and did him homage with his sword. Then said the damosel,\nMe repenteth, Green Knight, of your damage, and of your brother's death,\nthe Black Knight, for of your help I had great mister, for I dread me\nsore to pass this forest. Nay, dread you not, said the Green Knight, for\nye shall lodge with me this night, and to-morn I shall help you through\nthis forest. So they took their horses and rode to his manor, which was\nfast there beside.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How the damosel again rebuked Beaumains, and would not\nsuffer him to sit at her table, but called him kitchen boy.\n\nAND ever she rebuked Beaumains, and would not suffer him to sit at her\ntable, but as the Green Knight took him and sat him at a side table.\nMarvel methinketh, said the Green Knight to the damosel, why ye rebuke\nthis noble knight as ye do, for I warn you, damosel, he is a full noble\nknight, and I know no knight is able to match him; therefore ye do\ngreat wrong to rebuke him, for he shall do you right good service, for\nwhatsomever he maketh himself, ye shall prove at the end that he is come\nof a noble blood and of king's lineage. Fie, fie, said the damosel,\nit is shame for you to say of him such worship. Truly, said the Green\nKnight, it were shame for me to say of him any disworship, for he hath\nproved himself a better knight than I am, yet have I met with many\nknights in my days, and never or this time have I found no knight his\nmatch. And so that night they yede unto rest, and all that night the\nGreen Knight commanded thirty knights privily to watch Beaumains, for to\nkeep him from all treason.\n\nAnd so on the morn they all arose, and heard their mass and brake their\nfast; and then they took their horses and rode on their way, and the\nGreen Knight conveyed them through the forest; and there the Green\nKnight said, My lord Beaumains, I and these thirty knights shall be\nalways at your summons, both early and late, at your calling and whither\nthat ever ye will send us. It is well said, said Beaumains; when that I\ncall upon you ye must yield you unto King Arthur, and all your knights.\nIf that ye so command us, we shall be ready at all times, said the Green\nKnight. Fie, fie upon thee, in the devil's name, said the damosel,\nthat any good knights should be obedient unto a kitchen knave. So\nthen departed the Green Knight and the damosel. And then she said unto\nBeaumains, Why followest thou me, thou kitchen boy? Cast away thy shield\nand thy spear, and flee away; yet I counsel thee betimes or thou\nshalt say right soon, alas; for wert thou as wight as ever was Wade or\nLauncelot, Tristram, or the good knight Sir Lamorak, thou shalt not pass\na pass here that is called the Pass Perilous. Damosel, said Beaumains,\nwho is afeard let him flee, for it were shame to turn again sithen I\nhave ridden so long with you. Well, said the damosel, ye shall soon,\nwhether ye will or not.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How the third brother, called the Red Knight, jousted and\nfought against Beaumains, and how Beaumains overcame him.\n\nSO within a while they saw a tower as white as any snow, well matchecold\nall about, and double dyked. And over the tower gate there hung a fifty\nshields of divers colours, and under that tower there was a fair meadow.\nAnd therein were many knights and squires to behold, scaffolds and\npavilions; for there upon the morn should be a great tournament: and the\nlord of the tower was in his castle and looked out at a window, and saw\na damosel, a dwarf, and a knight armed at all points. So God me help,\nsaid the lord, with that knight will I joust, for I see that he is a\nknight-errant. And so he armed him and horsed him hastily. And when he\nwas on horseback with his shield and his spear, it was all red, both\nhis horse and his harness, and all that to him longeth. And when that\nhe came nigh him he weened it had been his brother the Black Knight;\nand then he cried aloud, Brother, what do ye in these marches? Nay, nay,\nsaid the damosel, it is not he; this is but a kitchen knave that was\nbrought up for alms in King Arthur's court. Nevertheless, said the Red\nKnight, I will speak with him or he depart. Ah, said the damosel, this\nknave hath killed thy brother, and Sir Kay named him Beaumains, and this\nhorse and this harness was thy brother's, the Black Knight. Also I\nsaw thy brother the Green Knight overcome of his hands. Now may ye be\nrevenged upon him, for I may never be quit of him.\n\nWith this either knights departed in sunder, and they came together with\nall their might, and either of their horses fell to the earth, and they\navoided their horses, and put their shields afore them and drew their\nswords, and either gave other sad strokes, now here, now there, rasing,\ntracing, foining, and hurling like two boars, the space of two hours.\nAnd then she cried on high to the Red Knight, Alas, thou noble Red\nKnight, think what worship hath followed thee, let never a kitchen knave\nendure thee so long as he doth. Then the Red Knight waxed wroth and\ndoubled his strokes, and hurt Beaumains wonderly sore, that the blood\nran down to the ground, that it was wonder to see that strong battle.\nYet at the last Sir Beaumains struck him to the earth, and as he would\nhave slain the Red Knight, he cried mercy, saying, Noble knight, slay me\nnot, and I shall yield me to thee with fifty knights with me that be at\nmy commandment. And I forgive thee all the despite that thou hast done\nto me, and the death of my brother the Black Knight. All this availeth\nnot, said Beaumains, but if my damosel pray me to save thy life.\nAnd therewith he made semblant to strike off his head. Let be, thou\nBeaumains, slay him not, for he is a noble knight, and not so hardy,\nupon thine head, but thou save him.\n\nThen Beaumains bade the Red Knight, Stand up, and thank the damosel now\nof thy life. Then the Red Knight prayed him to see his castle, and to\nbe there all night. So the damosel then granted him, and there they\nhad merry cheer. But always the damosel spake many foul words unto\nBeaumains, whereof the Red Knight had great marvel; and all that night\nthe Red Knight made three score knights to watch Beaumains, that he\nshould have no shame nor villainy. And upon the morn they heard mass\nand dined, and the Red Knight came before Beaumains with his three score\nknights, and there he proffered him his homage and fealty at all times,\nhe and his knights to do him service. I thank you, said Beaumains, but\nthis ye shall grant me: when I call upon you, to come afore my lord\nKing Arthur, and yield you unto him to be his knights. Sir, said the\nRed Knight, I will be ready, and my fellowship, at your summons. So Sir\nBeaumains departed and the damosel, and ever she rode chiding him in the\nfoulest manner.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How Sir Beaumains suffered great rebukes of the damosel, and\nhe suffered it patiently.\n\nDAMOSEL, said Beaumains, ye are uncourteous so to rebuke me as ye do,\nfor meseemeth I have done you good service, and ever ye threaten me I\nshall be beaten with knights that we meet, but ever for all your boast\nthey lie in the dust or in the mire, and therefore I pray you rebuke me\nno more; and when ye see me beaten or yielden as recreant, then may ye\nbid me go from you shamefully; but first I let you wit I will not depart\nfrom you, for I were worse than a fool an I would depart from you all\nthe while that I win worship. Well, said she, right soon there shall\nmeet a knight shall pay thee all thy wages, for he is the most man of\nworship of the world, except King Arthur. I will well, said Beaumains,\nthe more he is of worship, the more shall be my worship to have ado with\nhim.\n\nThen anon they were ware where was afore them a city rich and fair. And\nbetwixt them and the city a mile and an half there was a fair meadow\nthat seemed new mown, and therein were many pavilions fair to behold.\nLo, said the damosel, yonder is a lord that owneth yonder city, and his\ncustom is, when the weather is fair, to lie in this meadow to joust and\ntourney. And ever there be about him five hundred knights and gentlemen\nof arms, and there be all manner of games that any gentleman can devise.\nThat goodly lord, said Beaumains, would I fain see. Thou shalt see him\ntime enough, said the damosel, and so as she rode near she espied the\npavilion where he was. Lo, said she, seest thou yonder pavilion that is\nall of the colour of Inde, and all manner of thing that there is about,\nmen and women, and horses trapped, shields and spears were all of the\ncolour of Inde, and his name is Sir Persant of Inde, the most lordliest\nknight that ever thou lookedst on. It may well be, said Beaumains, but\nbe he never so stout a knight, in this field I shall abide till that\nI see him under his shield. Ah, fool, said she, thou wert better flee\nbetimes. Why, said Beaumains, an he be such a knight as ye make him, he\nwill not set upon me with all his men, or with his five hundred knights.\nFor an there come no more but one at once, I shall him not fail whilst\nmy life lasteth. Fie, fie, said the damosel, that ever such a stinking\nknave should blow such a boast. Damosel, he said, ye are to blame so to\nrebuke me, for I had liefer do five battles than so to be rebuked, let\nhim come and then let him do his worst.\n\nSir, she said, I marvel what thou art and of what kin thou art come;\nboldly thou speakest, and boldly thou hast done, that have I seen;\ntherefore I pray thee save thyself an thou mayest, for thy horse and\nthou have had great travail, and I dread we dwell over long from the\nsiege, for it is but hence seven mile, and all perilous passages we\nare passed save all only this passage; and here I dread me sore lest ye\nshall catch some hurt, therefore I would ye were hence, that ye were\nnot bruised nor hurt with this strong knight. But I let you wit that Sir\nPersant of Inde is nothing of might nor strength unto the knight that\nlaid the siege about my lady. As for that, said Sir Beaumains, be it\nas it be may. For sithen I am come so nigh this knight I will prove his\nmight or I depart from him, and else I shall be shamed an I now withdraw\nme from him. And therefore, damosel, have ye no doubt by the grace of\nGod I shall so deal with this knight that within two hours after noon\nI shall deliver him. And then shall we come to the siege by daylight. O\nJesu, marvel have I, said the damosel, what manner a man ye be, for it\nmay never be otherwise but that ye be come of a noble blood, for so foul\nnor shamefully did never woman rule a knight as I have done you, and\never courteously ye have suffered me, and that came never but of a\ngentle blood.\n\nDamosel, said Beaumains, a knight may little do that may not suffer a\ndamosel, for whatsomever ye said unto me I took none heed to your words,\nfor the more ye said the more ye angered me, and my wrath I wreaked\nupon them that I had ado withal. And therefore all the missaying that ye\nmissaid me furthered me in my battle, and caused me to think to show and\nprove myself at the end what I was; for peradventure though I had meat\nin King Arthur's kitchen, yet I might have had meat enough in other\nplaces, but all that I did it for to prove and assay my friends, and\nthat shall be known another day; and whether that I be a gentleman\nborn or none, I let you wit, fair damosel, I have done you gentleman's\nservice, and peradventure better service yet will I do or I depart from\nyou. Alas, she said, fair Beaumains, forgive me all that I have missaid\nor done against thee. With all my heart, said he, I forgive it you, for\nye did nothing but as ye should do, for all your evil words pleased me;\nand damosel, said Beaumains, since it liketh you to say thus fair unto\nme, wit ye well it gladdeth my heart greatly, and now meseemeth there is\nno knight living but I am able enough for him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How Beaumains fought with Sir Persant of Inde, and made him\nto be yielden.\n\nWITH this Sir Persant of Inde had espied them as they hoved in the\nfield, and knightly he sent to them whether he came in war or in peace.\nSay to thy lord, said Beaumains, I take no force, but whether as him\nlist himself. So the messenger went again unto Sir Persant and told him\nall his answer. Well then will I have ado with him to the utterance, and\nso he purveyed him and rode against him. And Beaumains saw him and made\nhim ready, and there they met with all that ever their horses might run,\nand brast their spears either in three pieces, and their horses rushed\nso together that both their horses fell dead to the earth; and lightly\nthey avoided their horses and put their shields afore them, and drew\ntheir swords, and gave many great strokes that sometime they hurtled\ntogether that they fell grovelling on the ground. Thus they fought two\nhours and more, that their shields and their hauberks were all forhewen,\nand in many steads they were wounded. So at the last Sir Beaumains smote\nhim through the cost of the body, and then he retrayed him here and\nthere, and knightly maintained his battle long time. And at the last,\nthough him loath were, Beaumains smote Sir Persant above upon the\nhelm, that he fell grovelling to the earth; and then he leapt upon him\noverthwart and unlaced his helm to have slain him.\n\nThen Sir Persant yielded him and asked him mercy. With that came the\ndamosel and prayed to save his life. I will well, for it were pity\nthis noble knight should die. Gramercy, said Persant, gentle knight and\ndamosel. For certainly now I wot well it was ye that slew my brother the\nBlack Knight at the black thorn; he was a full noble knight, his name\nwas Sir Percard. Also I am sure that ye are he that won mine other\nbrother the Green Knight, his name was Sir Pertolepe. Also ye won my\nbrother the Red Knight, Sir Perimones. And now since ye have won these,\nthis shall I do for to please you: ye shall have homage and fealty of\nme, and an hundred knights to be always at your commandment, to go\nand ride where ye will command us. And so they went unto Sir Persant's\npavilion and drank the wine, and ate spices, and afterward Sir Persant\nmade him to rest upon a bed until supper time, and after supper to bed\nagain. When Beaumains was abed, Sir Persant had a lady, a fair daughter\nof eighteen year of age, and there he called her unto him, and charged\nher and commanded her upon his blessing to go unto the knight's bed, and\nlie down by his side, and make him no strange cheer, but good cheer,\nand take him in thine arms and kiss him, and look that this be done, I\ncharge you, as ye will have my love and my good will. So Sir Persant's\ndaughter did as her father bade her, and so she went unto Sir Beaumains'\nbed, and privily she dispoiled her, and laid her down by him, and then\nhe awoke and saw her, and asked her what she was. Sir, she said, I am\nSir Persant's daughter, that by the commandment of my father am come\nhither. Be ye a maid or a wife? said he. Sir, she said, I am a clean\nmaiden. God defend, said he, that I should defoil you to do Sir Persant\nsuch a shame; therefore, fair damosel, arise out of this bed or else I\nwill. Sir, she said, I came not to you by mine own will, but as I was\ncommanded. Alas, said Sir Beaumains, I were a shameful knight an I would\ndo your father any disworship; and so he kissed her, and so she departed\nand came unto Sir Persant her father, and told him all how she had sped.\nTruly, said Sir Persant, whatsomever he be, he is come of a noble blood.\nAnd so we leave them there till on the morn.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. Of the goodly communication between Sir Persant and\nBeaumains, and how he told him that his name was Sir Gareth.\n\nAND so on the morn the damosel and Sir Beaumains heard mass and brake\ntheir fast, and so took their leave. Fair damosel, said Persant,\nwhitherward are ye way-leading this knight? Sir, she said, this knight\nis going to the siege that besiegeth my sister in the Castle Dangerous.\nAh, ah, said Persant, that is the Knight of the Red Laund, the which\nis the most perilous knight that I know now living, and a man that is\nwithout mercy, and men say that he hath seven men's strength. God save\nyou, said he to Beaumains, from that knight, for he doth great wrong to\nthat lady, and that is great pity, for she is one of the fairest ladies\nof the world, and meseemeth that your damosel is her sister: is not your\nname Linet? said he. Yea, sir, said she, and my lady my sister's name is\nDame Lionesse. Now shall I tell you, said Sir Persant, this Red Knight\nof the Red Laund hath lain long at the siege, well-nigh this two years,\nand many times he might have had her an he had would, but he prolongeth\nthe time to this intent, for to have Sir Launcelot du Lake to do battle\nwith him, or Sir Tristram, or Sir Lamorak de Galis, or Sir Gawaine, and\nthis is his tarrying so long at the siege.\n\nNow my lord Sir Persant of Inde, said the damosel Linet, I require you\nthat ye will make this gentleman knight or ever he fight with the Red\nKnight. I will with all my heart, said Sir Persant, an it please him\nto take the order of knighthood of so simple a man as I am. Sir, said\nBeaumains, I thank you for your good will, for I am better sped, for\ncertainly the noble knight Sir Launcelot made me knight. Ah, said Sir\nPersant, of a more renowned knight might ye not be made knight; for of\nall knights he may be called chief of knighthood; and so all the world\nsaith, that betwixt three knights is departed clearly knighthood, that\nis Launcelot du Lake, Sir Tristram de Liones, and Sir Lamorak de Galis:\nthese bear now the renown. There be many other knights, as Sir Palamides\nthe Saracen and Sir Safere his brother; also Sir Bleoberis and Sir\nBlamore de Ganis his brother; also Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir Ector de\nMaris and Sir Percivale de Galis; these and many more be noble knights,\nbut there be none that pass the three above said; therefore God speed\nyou well, said Sir Persant, for an ye may match the Red Knight ye shall\nbe called the fourth of the world.\n\nSir, said Beaumains, I would fain be of good fame and of knighthood. And\nI let you wit I came of good men, for I dare say my father was a noble\nman, and so that ye will keep it in close, and this damosel, I will tell\nyou of what kin I am. We will not discover you, said they both, till ye\ncommand us, by the faith we owe unto God. Truly then, said he, my name\nis Gareth of Orkney, and King Lot was my father, and my mother is\nKing Arthur's sister, her name is Dame Morgawse, and Sir Gawaine is my\nbrother, and Sir Agravaine and Sir Gaheris, and I am the youngest of\nthem all. And yet wot not King Arthur nor Sir Gawaine what I am.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How the lady that was besieged had word from her sister\nhow she had brought a knight to fight for her, and what battles he had\nachieved.\n\nSO the book saith that the lady that was besieged had word of her\nsister's coming by the dwarf, and a knight with her, and how he had\npassed all the perilous passages. What manner a man is he? said the\nlady. He is a noble knight, truly, madam, said the dwarf, and but a\nyoung man, but he is as likely a man as ever ye saw any. What is he?\nsaid the damosel, and of what kin is he come, and of whom was he made\nknight? Madam, said the dwarf, he is the king's son of Orkney, but\nhis name I will not tell you as at this time; but wit ye well, of Sir\nLauncelot was he made knight, for of none other would he be made knight,\nand Sir Kay named him Beaumains. How escaped he, said the lady, from the\nbrethren of Persant? Madam, he said, as a noble knight should. First, he\nslew two brethren at a passage of a water. Ah! said she, they were good\nknights, but they were murderers, the one hight Gherard le Breuse, and\nthe other knight hight Sir Arnold le Breuse. Then, madam, he recountered\nwith the Black Knight, and slew him in plain battle, and so he took his\nhorse and his armour and fought with the Green Knight and won him in\nplain battle, and in like wise he served the Red Knight, and after in\nthe same wise he served the Blue Knight and won him in plain battle.\nThen, said the lady, he hath overcome Sir Persant of Inde, one of the\nnoblest knights of the world, and the dwarf said, He hath won all the\nfour brethren and slain the Black Knight, and yet he did more to-fore:\nhe overthrew Sir Kay and left him nigh dead upon the ground; also he\ndid a great battle with Sir Launcelot, and there they departed on even\nhands: and then Sir Launcelot made him knight.\n\nDwarf, said the lady, I am glad of these tidings, therefore go thou in\nan hermitage of mine hereby, and there shalt thou bear with thee of my\nwine in two flagons of silver, they are of two gallons, and also two\ncast of bread with fat venison baked, and dainty fowls; and a cup of\ngold here I deliver thee, that is rich and precious; and bear all this\nto mine hermitage, and put it in the hermit's hands. And sithen go\nthou unto my sister and greet her well, and commend me unto that gentle\nknight, and pray him to eat and to drink and make him strong, and say\nye him I thank him of his courtesy and goodness, that he would take upon\nhim such labour for me that never did him bounty nor courtesy. Also pray\nhim that he be of good heart and courage, for he shall meet with a full\nnoble knight, but he is neither of bounty, courtesy, nor gentleness; for\nhe attendeth unto nothing but to murder, and that is the cause I cannot\npraise him nor love him.\n\nSo this dwarf departed, and came to Sir Persant, where he found the\ndamosel Linet and Sir Beaumains, and there he told them all as ye have\nheard; and then they took their leave, but Sir Persant took an ambling\nhackney and conveyed them on their ways, and then beleft them to God;\nand so within a little while they came to that hermitage, and there they\ndrank the wine, and ate the venison and the fowls baken. And so when\nthey had repasted them well, the dwarf returned again with his vessel\nunto the castle again; and there met with him the Red Knight of the Red\nLaunds, and asked him from whence that he came, and where he had been.\nSir, said the dwarf, I have been with my lady's sister of this castle,\nand she hath been at King Arthur's court, and brought a knight with her.\nThen I account her travail but lost; for though she had brought with her\nSir Launcelot, Sir Tristram, Sir Lamorak, or Sir Gawaine, I would think\nmyself good enough for them all.\n\nIt may well be, said the dwarf, but this knight hath passed all the\nperilous passages, and slain the Black Knight and other two more, and\nwon the Green Knight, the Red Knight, and the Blue Knight. Then is he\none of these four that I have afore rehearsed. He is none of those, said\nthe dwarf, but he is a king's son. What is his name? said the Red Knight\nof the Red Launds. That will I not tell you, said the dwarf, but Sir Kay\nupon scorn named him Beaumains. I care not, said the knight, what knight\nso ever he be, for I shall soon deliver him. And if I ever match him he\nshall have a shameful death as many other have had. That were pity, said\nthe dwarf, and it is marvel that ye make such shameful war upon noble\nknights.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. How the damosel and Beaumains came to the siege; and came to\na sycamore tree, and there Beaumains blew a horn, and then the Knight of\nthe Red Launds came to fight with him.\n\nNOW leave we the knight and the dwarf, and speak we of Beaumains, that\nall night lay in the hermitage; and upon the morn he and the damosel\nLinet heard their mass and brake their fast. And then they took their\nhorses and rode throughout a fair forest; and then they came to a plain,\nand saw where were many pavilions and tents, and a fair castle, and\nthere was much smoke and great noise; and when they came near the siege\nSir Beaumains espied upon great trees, as he rode, how there hung full\ngoodly armed knights by the neck, and their shields about their necks\nwith their swords, and gilt spurs upon their heels, and so there hung\nnigh a forty knights shamefully with full rich arms.\n\nThen Sir Beaumains abated his countenance and said, What meaneth this?\nFair sir, said the damosel, abate not your cheer for all this sight, for\nye must courage yourself, or else ye be all shent, for all these knights\ncame hither to this siege to rescue my sister Dame Lionesse, and when\nthe Red Knight of the Red Launds had overcome them, he put them to this\nshameful death without mercy and pity. And in the same wise he will\nserve you but if you quit you the better.\n\nNow Jesu defend me, said Beaumains, from such a villainous death and\nshenship of arms. For rather than I should so be faren withal, I would\nrather be slain manly in plain battle. So were ye better, said the\ndamosel; for trust not, in him is no courtesy, but all goeth to the\ndeath or shameful murder, and that is pity, for he is a full likely man,\nwell made of body, and a full noble knight of prowess, and a lord of\ngreat lands and possessions. Truly, said Beaumains, he may well be a\ngood knight, but he useth shameful customs, and it is marvel that he\nendureth so long that none of the noble knights of my lord Arthur's have\nnot dealt with him.\n\nAnd then they rode to the dykes, and saw them double dyked with full\nwarlike walls; and there were lodged many great lords nigh the walls;\nand there was great noise of minstrelsy; and the sea beat upon the one\nside of the walls, where were many ships and mariners' noise with \"hale\nand how.\" And also there was fast by a sycamore tree, and there hung an\nhorn, the greatest that ever they saw, of an elephant's bone; and this\nKnight of the Red Launds had hanged it up there, that if there came any\nerrant-knight, he must blow that horn, and then will he make him ready\nand come to him to do battle. But, sir, I pray you, said the damosel\nLinet, blow ye not the horn till it be high noon, for now it is about\nprime, and now increaseth his might, that as men say he hath seven men's\nstrength. Ah, fie for shame, fair damosel, say ye never so more to me;\nfor, an he were as good a knight as ever was, I shall never fail him\nin his most might, for either I will win worship worshipfully, or die\nknightly in the field. And therewith he spurred his horse straight to\nthe sycamore tree, and blew so the horn eagerly that all the siege and\nthe castle rang thereof. And then there leapt out knights out of their\ntents and pavilions, and they within the castle looked over the walls\nand out at windows.\n\nThen the Red Knight of the Red Launds armed him hastily, and two barons\nset on his spurs upon his heels, and all was blood red, his armour,\nspear and shield. And an earl buckled his helm upon his head, and then\nthey brought him a red spear and a red steed, and so he rode into a\nlittle vale under the castle, that all that were in the castle and at\nthe siege might behold the battle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. How the two knights met together, and of their talking, and\nhow they began their battle.\n\nSIR, said the damosel Linet unto Sir Beaumains, look ye be glad and\nlight, for yonder is your deadly enemy, and at yonder window is my\nlady, my sister, Dame Lionesse. Where? said Beaumains. Yonder, said the\ndamosel, and pointed with her finger. That is truth, said Beaumains. She\nbeseemeth afar the fairest lady that ever I looked upon; and truly, he\nsaid, I ask no better quarrel than now for to do battle, for truly she\nshall be my lady, and for her I will fight. And ever he looked up to the\nwindow with glad countenance, and the Lady Lionesse made curtsey to him\ndown to the earth, with holding up both their hands.\n\nWith that the Red Knight of the Red Launds called to Sir Beaumains,\nLeave, sir knight, thy looking, and behold me, I counsel thee; for\nI warn thee well she is my lady, and for her I have done many strong\nbattles. If thou have so done, said Beaumains, meseemeth it was but\nwaste labour, for she loveth none of thy fellowship, and thou to love\nthat loveth not thee is but great folly. For an I understood that she\nwere not glad of my coming, I would be advised or I did battle for her.\nBut I understand by the besieging of this castle she may forbear thy\nfellowship. And therefore wit thou well, thou Red Knight of the Red\nLaunds, I love her, and will rescue her, or else to die. Sayst thou\nthat? said the Red Knight, meseemeth thou ought of reason to be ware by\nyonder knights that thou sawest hang upon yonder trees. Fie for shame,\nsaid Beaumains, that ever thou shouldest say or do so evil, for in that\nthou shamest thyself and knighthood, and thou mayst be sure there will\nno lady love thee that knoweth thy wicked customs. And now thou weenest\nthat the sight of these hanged knights should fear me. Nay truly, not\nso; that shameful sight causeth me to have courage and hardiness against\nthee, more than I would have had against thee an thou wert a well-ruled\nknight. Make thee ready, said the Red Knight of the Red Launds, and talk\nno longer with me.\n\nThen Sir Beaumains bade the damosel go from him; and then they put their\nspears in their rests, and came together with all their might that they\nhad both, and either smote other in midst of their shields that the\npaitrelles, surcingles, and cruppers brast, and fell to the earth both,\nand the reins of their bridles in their hands; and so they lay a great\nwhile sore astonied, that all that were in the castle and in the siege\nweened their necks had been broken; and then many a stranger and other\nsaid the strange knight was a big man, and a noble jouster, for or now\nwe saw never no knight match the Red Knight of the Red Launds: thus\nthey said, both within the castle and without. Then lightly they avoided\ntheir horses and put their shields afore them, and drew their swords and\nran together like two fierce lions, and either gave other such buffets\nupon their helms that they reeled backward both two strides; and then\nthey recovered both, and hewed great pieces off their harness and their\nshields that a great part fell into the fields.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. How after long fighting Beaumains overcame the knight and\nwould have slain him, but at the request of the lords he saved his life,\nand made him to yield him to the lady.\n\nAND then thus they fought till it was past noon, and never would stint,\ntill at the last they lacked wind both; and then they stood wagging and\nscattering, panting, blowing and bleeding, that all that beheld them for\nthe most part wept for pity. So when they had rested them a while they\nyede to battle again, tracing, racing, foining as two boars. And at some\ntime they took their run as it had been two rams, and hurtled together\nthat sometime they fell grovelling to the earth: and at some time they\nwere so amazed that either took other's sword instead of his own.\n\nThus they endured till evensong time, that there was none that beheld\nthem might know whether was like to win the battle; and their armour\nwas so forhewn that men might see their naked sides; and in other places\nthey were naked, but ever the naked places they did defend. And the\nRed Knight was a wily knight of war, and his wily fighting taught Sir\nBeaumains to be wise; but he abought it full sore or he did espy his\nfighting.\n\nAnd thus by assent of them both they granted either other to rest; and\nso they set them down upon two mole-hills there beside the fighting\nplace, and either of them unlaced his helm, and took the cold wind;\nfor either of their pages was fast by them, to come when they called to\nunlace their harness and to set them on again at their commandment. And\nthen when Sir Beaumains' helm was off, he looked up to the window,\nand there he saw the fair lady Dame Lionesse, and she made him such\ncountenance that his heart waxed light and jolly; and therewith he\nbade the Red Knight of the Red Launds make him ready, and let us do the\nbattle to the utterance. I will well, said the knight, and then they\nlaced up their helms, and their pages avoided, and they stepped together\nand fought freshly; but the Red Knight of the Red Launds awaited him,\nand at an overthwart smote him within the hand, that his sword fell out\nof his hand; and yet he gave him another buffet upon the helm that he\nfell grovelling to the earth, and the Red Knight fell over him, for to\nhold him down.\n\nThen cried the maiden Linet on high: O Sir Beaumains, where is thy\ncourage become? Alas, my lady my sister beholdeth thee, and she sobbeth\nand weepeth, that maketh mine heart heavy. When Sir Beaumains heard her\nsay so, he abraid up with a great might and gat him upon his feet, and\nlightly he leapt to his sword and gripped it in his hand, and doubled\nhis pace unto the Red Knight, and there they fought a new battle\ntogether. But Sir Beaumains then doubled his strokes, and smote so thick\nthat he smote the sword out of his hand, and then he smote him upon the\nhelm that he fell to the earth, and Sir Beaumains fell upon him, and\nunlaced his helm to have slain him; and then he yielded him and asked\nmercy, and said with a loud voice: O noble knight, I yield me to thy\nmercy.\n\nThen Sir Beaumains bethought him upon the knights that he had made to be\nhanged shamefully, and then he said: I may not with my worship save\nthy life, for the shameful deaths that thou hast caused many full good\nknights to die. Sir, said the Red Knight of the Red Launds, hold your\nhand and ye shall know the causes why I put them to so shameful a death.\nSay on, said Sir Beaumains. Sir, I loved once a lady, a fair damosel,\nand she had her brother slain; and she said it was Sir Launcelot\ndu Lake, or else Sir Gawaine; and she prayed me as that I loved her\nheartily, that I would make her a promise by the faith of my knighthood,\nfor to labour daily in arms unto I met with one of them; and all that\nI might overcome I should put them unto a villainous death; and this is\nthe cause that I have put all these knights to death, and so I ensured\nher to do all the villainy unto King Arthur's knights, and that I should\ntake vengeance upon all these knights. And, sir, now I will thee tell\nthat every day my strength increaseth till noon, and all this time have\nI seven men's strength.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. How the knight yielded him, and how Beaumains made him to\ngo unto King Arthur's court, and to cry Sir Launcelot mercy.\n\nTHEN came there many earls, and barons, and noble knights, and prayed\nthat knight to save his life, and take him to your prisoner. And all\nthey fell upon their knees, and prayed him of mercy, and that he would\nsave his life; and, Sir, they all said, it were fairer of him to take\nhomage and fealty, and let him hold his lands of you than for to slay\nhim; by his death ye shall have none advantage, and his misdeeds that\nbe done may not be undone; and therefore he shall make amends to all\nparties, and we all will become your men and do you homage and fealty.\nFair lords, said Beaumains, wit you well I am full loath to slay this\nknight, nevertheless he hath done passing ill and shamefully; but\ninsomuch all that he did was at a lady's request I blame him the less;\nand so for your sake I will release him that he shall have his life upon\nthis covenant, that he go within the castle, and yield him there to the\nlady, and if she will forgive and quit him, I will well; with this he\nmake her amends of all the trespass he hath done against her and her\nlands. And also, when that is done, that ye go unto the court of King\nArthur, and there that ye ask Sir Launcelot mercy, and Sir Gawaine, for\nthe evil will ye have had against them. Sir, said the Red Knight of the\nRed Launds, all this will I do as ye command, and siker assurance and\nborrows ye shall have. And so then when the assurance was made, he made\nhis homage and fealty, and all those earls and barons with him.\n\nAnd then the maiden Linet came to Sir Beaumains, and unarmed him and\nsearched his wounds, and stinted his blood, and in likewise she did to\nthe Red Knight of the Red Launds. And there they sojourned ten days in\ntheir tents; and the Red Knight made his lords and servants to do all\nthe pleasure that they might unto Sir Beaumains. And so within a while\nthe Red Knight of the Red Launds yede unto the castle, and put him in\nher grace. And so she received him upon sufficient surety, so all her\nhurts were well restored of all that she could complain. And then he\ndeparted unto the court of King Arthur, and there openly the Red Knight\nof the Red Launds put him in the mercy of Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine,\nand there he told openly how he was overcome and by whom, and also he\ntold all the battles from the beginning unto the ending. Jesu mercy,\nsaid King Arthur and Sir Gawaine, we marvel much of what blood he is\ncome, for he is a noble knight. Have ye no marvel, said Sir Launcelot,\nfor ye shall right well wit that he is come of a full noble blood; and\nas for his might and hardiness, there be but few now living that is so\nmighty as he is, and so noble of prowess. It seemeth by you, said King\nArthur, that ye know his name, and from whence he is come, and of what\nblood he is. I suppose I do so, said Launcelot, or else I would not have\ngiven him the order of knighthood; but he gave me such charge at that\ntime that I should never discover him until he required me, or else it\nbe known openly by some other.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX How Beaumains came to the lady, and when he came to the\ncastle the gates were closed against him, and of the words that the lady\nsaid to him.\n\nNOW turn we unto Sir Beaumains that desired of Linet that he might see\nher sister, his lady. Sir, she said, I would fain ye saw her. Then Sir\nBeaumains all armed him, and took his horse and his spear, and rode\nstraight unto the castle. And when he came to the gate he found there\nmany men armed, and pulled up the drawbridge and drew the port close.\n\nThen marvelled he why they would not suffer him to enter. And then he\nlooked up to the window; and there he saw the fair Lionesse that said on\nhigh: Go thy way, Sir Beaumains, for as yet thou shalt not have wholly\nmy love, unto the time that thou be called one of the number of the\nworthy knights. And therefore go labour in worship this twelvemonth,\nand then thou shalt hear new tidings. Alas, fair lady, said Beaumains,\nI have not deserved that ye should show me this strangeness, and I had\nweened that I should have right good cheer with you, and unto my power\nI have deserved thank, and well I am sure I have bought your love with\npart of the best blood within my body. Fair courteous knight, said Dame\nLionesse, be not displeased nor over-hasty; for wit you well your great\ntravail nor good love shall not be lost, for I consider your great\ntravail and labour, your bounty and your goodness as me ought to do. And\ntherefore go on your way, and look that ye be of good comfort, for all\nshall be for your worship and for the best, and perdy a twelvemonth will\nsoon be done, and trust me, fair knight, I shall be true to you, and\nnever to betray you, but to my death I shall love you and none other.\nAnd therewithal she turned her from the window, and Sir Beaumains rode\nawayward from the castle, making great dole, and so he rode here and\nthere and wist not where he rode, till it was dark night. And then it\nhappened him to come to a poor man's house, and there he was harboured\nall that night.\n\nBut Sir Beaumains had no rest, but wallowed and writhed for the love\nof the lady of the castle. And so upon the morrow he took his horse and\nrode until underne, and then he came to a broad water, and thereby was\na great lodge, and there he alighted to sleep and laid his head upon the\nshield, and betook his horse to the dwarf, and commanded him to watch\nall night.\n\nNow turn we to the lady of the same castle, that thought much upon\nBeaumains, and then she called unto her Sir Gringamore her brother, and\nprayed him in all manner, as he loved her heartily, that he would ride\nafter Sir Beaumains: And ever have ye wait upon him till ye may find\nhim sleeping, for I am sure in his heaviness he will alight down in some\nplace, and lie him down to sleep; and therefore have ye your wait upon\nhim, and in the priviest manner ye can, take his dwarf, and go ye your\nway with him as fast as ever ye may or Sir Beaumains awake. For my\nsister Linet telleth me that he can tell of what kindred he is come, and\nwhat is his right name. And the meanwhile I and my sister will ride unto\nyour castle to await when ye bring with you the dwarf. And then when\nye have brought him unto your castle, I will have him in examination\nmyself. Unto the time that I know what is his right name, and of what\nkindred he is come, shall I never be merry at my heart. Sister, said Sir\nGringamore, all this shall be done after your intent.\n\nAnd so he rode all the other day and the night till that he found Sir\nBeaumains lying by a water, and his head upon his shield, for to sleep.\nAnd then when he saw Sir Beaumains fast asleep, he came stilly stalking\nbehind the dwarf, and plucked him fast under his arm, and so he rode\naway with him as fast as ever he might unto his own castle. And this Sir\nGringamore's arms were all black, and that to him longeth. But ever as\nhe rode with the dwarf toward his castle, he cried unto his lord and\nprayed him of help. And therewith awoke Sir Beaumains, and up he leapt\nlightly, and saw where Sir Gringamore rode his way with the dwarf, and\nso Sir Gringamore rode out of his sight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. How Sir Beaumains rode after to rescue his dwarf, and came\ninto the castle where he was.\n\nTHEN Sir Beaumains put on his helm anon, and buckled his shield, and\ntook his horse, and rode after him all that ever he might ride through\nmarshes, and fields, and great dales, that many times his horse and he\nplunged over the head in deep mires, for he knew not the way, but took\nthe gainest way in that woodness, that many times he was like to perish.\nAnd at the last him happened to come to a fair green way, and there\nhe met with a poor man of the country, whom he saluted and asked him\nwhether he met not with a knight upon a black horse and all black\nharness, a little dwarf sitting behind him with heavy cheer. Sir, said\nthe poor man, here by me came Sir Gringamore the knight, with such a\ndwarf mourning as ye say; and therefore I rede you not follow him, for\nhe is one of the periloust knights of the world, and his castle is\nhere nigh hand but two mile; therefore we advise you ride not after Sir\nGringamore, but if ye owe him good will.\n\nSo leave we Sir Beaumains riding toward the castle, and speak we of Sir\nGringamore and the dwarf. Anon as the dwarf was come to the castle, Dame\nLionesse and Dame Linet her sister, asked the dwarf where was his master\nborn, and of what lineage he was come. And but if thou tell me, said\nDame Lionesse, thou shalt never escape this castle, but ever here to be\nprisoner. As for that, said the dwarf, I fear not greatly to tell his\nname and of what kin he is come. Wit you well he is a king's son, and\nhis mother is sister to King Arthur, and he is brother to the good\nknight Sir Gawaine, and his name is Sir Gareth of Orkney. And now I have\ntold you his right name, I pray you, fair lady, let me go to my lord\nagain, for he will never out of this country until that he have me\nagain. And if he be angry he will do much harm or that he be stint,\nand work you wrack in this country. As for that threatening, said Sir\nGringamore, be it as it be may, we will go to dinner. And so they washed\nand went to meat, and made them merry and well at ease, and because\nthe Lady Lionesse of the castle was there, they made great joy. Truly,\nmadam, said Linet unto her sister, well may he be a king's son, for he\nhath many good tatches on him, for he is courteous and mild, and the\nmost suffering man that ever I met withal. For I dare say there was\nnever gentlewoman reviled man in so foul a manner as I have rebuked him;\nand at all times he gave me goodly and meek answers again.\n\nAnd as they sat thus talking, there came Sir Gareth in at the gate with\nan angry countenance, and his sword drawn in his hand, and cried aloud\nthat all the castle might hear it, saying: Thou traitor, Sir Gringamore,\ndeliver me my dwarf again, or by the faith that I owe to the order of\nknighthood, I shall do thee all the harm that I can. Then Sir Gringamore\nlooked out at a window and said, Sir Gareth of Orkney, leave thy\nboasting words, for thou gettest not thy dwarf again. Thou coward\nknight, said Sir Gareth, bring him with thee, and come and do battle\nwith me, and win him and take him. So will I do, said Sir Gringamore,\nan me list, but for all thy great words thou gettest him not. Ah! fair\nbrother, said Dame Lionesse, I would he had his dwarf again, for I would\nhe were not wroth, for now he hath told me all my desire I keep no more\nof the dwarf. And also, brother, he hath done much for me, and delivered\nme from the Red Knight of the Red Launds, and therefore, brother, I owe\nhim my service afore all knights living. And wit ye well that I love him\nbefore all other, and full fain I would speak with him. But in nowise I\nwould that he wist what I were, but that I were another strange lady.\n\nWell, said Sir Gringamore, sithen I know now your will, I will obey now\nunto him. And right therewithal he went down unto Sir Gareth, and said:\nSir, I cry you mercy, and all that I have misdone I will amend it at\nyour will. And therefore I pray you that ye would alight, and take such\ncheer as I can make you in this castle. Shall I have my dwarf? said Sir\nGareth. Yea, sir, and all the pleasaunce that I can make you, for as\nsoon as your dwarf told me what ye were and of what blood ye are come,\nand what noble deeds ye have done in these marches, then I repented of\nmy deeds. And then Sir Gareth alighted, and there came his dwarf and\ntook his horse. O my fellow, said Sir Gareth, I have had many adventures\nfor thy sake. And so Sir Gringamore took him by the hand and led him\ninto the hall where his own wife was.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. How Sir Gareth, otherwise called Beaumains, came to the\npresence of his lady, and how they took acquaintance, and of their love.\n\nAND then came forth Dame Lionesse arrayed like a princess, and there\nshe made him passing good cheer, and he her again; and they had goodly\nlanguage and lovely countenance together. And Sir Gareth thought many\ntimes, Jesu, would that the lady of the Castle Perilous were so fair\nas she was. There were all manner of games and plays, of dancing and\nsinging. And ever the more Sir Gareth beheld that lady, the more he\nloved her; and so he burned in love that he was past himself in his\nreason; and forth toward night they yede unto supper, and Sir Gareth\nmight not eat, for his love was so hot that he wist not where he was.\n\nAll these looks espied Sir Gringamore, and then at-after supper he\ncalled his sister Dame Lionesse into a chamber, and said: Fair sister,\nI have well espied your countenance betwixt you and this knight, and I\nwill, sister, that ye wit he is a full noble knight, and if ye can make\nhim to abide here I will do him all the pleasure that I can, for an ye\nwere better than ye are, ye were well bywaryd upon him. Fair brother,\nsaid Dame Lionesse, I understand well that the knight is good, and\ncome he is of a noble house. Notwithstanding, I will assay him better,\nhowbeit I am most beholden to him of any earthly man; for he hath had\ngreat labour for my love, and passed many a dangerous passage.\n\nRight so Sir Gringamore went unto Sir Gareth, and said, Sir, make\nye good cheer, for ye shall have none other cause, for this lady, my\nsister, is yours at all times, her worship saved, for wit ye well she\nloveth you as well as ye do her, and better if better may be. An I wist\nthat, said Sir Gareth, there lived not a gladder man than I would be.\nUpon my worship, said Sir Gringamore, trust unto my promise; and as long\nas it liketh you ye shall sojourn with me, and this lady shall be with\nus daily and nightly to make you all the cheer that she can. I will\nwell, said Sir Gareth, for I have promised to be nigh this country this\ntwelvemonth. And well I am sure King Arthur and other noble knights will\nfind me where that I am within this twelvemonth. For I shall be sought\nand found, if that I be alive. And then the noble knight Sir Gareth went\nunto the Dame Lionesse, which he then much loved, and kissed her many\ntimes, and either made great joy of other. And there she promised him\nher love certainly, to love him and none other the days of her life.\nThen this lady, Dame Lionesse, by the assent of her brother, told Sir\nGareth all the truth what she was, and how she was the same lady that he\ndid battle for, and how she was lady of the Castle Perilous, and there\nshe told him how she caused her brother to take away his dwarf, [*2]for\nthis cause, to know the certainty what was your name, and of what kin ye\nwere come.\n\n\n[*2] Printed by Caxton as part of chap. xxii.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. How at night came an armed knight, and fought with Sir\nGareth, and he, sore hurt in the thigh, smote off the knight's head.\n\nAND then she let fetch to-fore him Linet, the damosel that had ridden\nwith him many wildsome ways. Then was Sir Gareth more gladder than he\nwas to-fore. And then they troth-plight each other to love, and never\nto fail whiles their life lasteth. And so they burnt both in love,\nthat they were accorded to abate their lusts secretly. And there Dame\nLionesse counselled Sir Gareth to sleep in none other place but in\nthe hall. And there she promised him to come to his bed a little afore\nmidnight.\n\n\nThis counsel was not so privily kept but it was understood; for they\nwere but young both, and tender of age, and had not used none such\ncrafts to-fore. Wherefore the damosel Linet was a little displeased, and\nshe thought her sister Dame Lionesse was a little over-hasty, that she\nmight not abide the time of her marriage; and for saving their worship,\nshe thought to abate their hot lusts. And so she let ordain by her\nsubtle crafts that they had not their intents neither with other, as in\ntheir delights, until they were married. And so it passed on. At-after\nsupper was made clean avoidance, that every lord and lady should go unto\nhis rest. But Sir Gareth said plainly he would go no farther than the\nhall, for in such places, he said, was convenient for an errant-knight\nto take his rest in; and so there were ordained great couches, and\nthereon feather beds, and there laid him down to sleep; and within a\nwhile came Dame Lionesse, wrapped in a mantle furred with ermine, and\nlaid her down beside Sir Gareth. And therewithal he began to kiss her.\nAnd then he looked afore him, and there he apperceived and saw come an\narmed knight, with many lights about him; and this knight had a long\ngisarm in his hand, and made grim countenance to smite him. When Sir\nGareth saw him come in that wise, he leapt out of his bed, and gat in\nhis hand his sword, and leapt straight toward that knight. And when the\nknight saw Sir Gareth come so fiercely upon him, he smote him with a\nfoin through the thick of the thigh that the wound was a shaftmon broad\nand had cut a-two many veins and sinews. And therewithal Sir Gareth\nsmote him upon the helm such a buffet that he fell grovelling; and then\nhe leapt over him and unlaced his helm, and smote off his head from the\nbody. And then he bled so fast that he might not stand, but so he laid\nhim down upon his bed, and there he swooned and lay as he had been dead.\n\nThen Dame Lionesse cried aloud, that her brother Sir Gringamore heard,\nand came down. And when he saw Sir Gareth so shamefully wounded he was\nsore displeased, and said: I am shamed that this noble knight is thus\nhonoured. Sir, said Sir Gringamore, how may this be, that ye be here,\nand this noble knight wounded? Brother, she said, I can not tell you,\nfor it was not done by me, nor by mine assent. For he is my lord and I\nam his, and he must be mine husband; therefore, my brother, I will that\nye wit I shame me not to be with him, nor to do him all the pleasure\nthat I can. Sister, said Sir Gringamore, and I will that ye wit it, and\nSir Gareth both, that it was never done by me, nor by my assent that\nthis unhappy deed was done. And there they staunched his bleeding\nas well as they might, and great sorrow made Sir Gringamore and Dame\nLionesse.\n\nAnd forthwithal came Dame Linet, and took up the head in the sight of\nthem all, and anointed it with an ointment thereas it was smitten off;\nand in the same wise she did to the other part thereas the head stuck,\nand then she set it together, and it stuck as fast as ever it did.\nAnd the knight arose lightly up, and the damosel Linet put him in her\nchamber. All this saw Sir Gringamore and Dame Lionesse, and so did Sir\nGareth; and well he espied that it was the damosel Linet, that rode with\nhim through the perilous passages. Ah well, damosel, said Sir Gareth,\nI weened ye would not have done as ye have done. My lord Gareth, said\nLinet, all that I have done I will avow, and all that I have done shall\nbe for your honour and worship, and to us all. And so within a while Sir\nGareth was nigh whole, and waxed light and jocund, and sang, danced, and\ngamed; and he and Dame Lionesse were so hot in burning love that they\nmade their covenant at the tenth night after, that she should come to\nhis bed. And because he was wounded afore, he laid his armour and his\nsword nigh his bed's side.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. How the said knight came again the next night and was\nbeheaded again, and how at the feast of Pentecost all the knights that\nSir Gareth had overcome came and yielded them to King Arthur.\n\nRIGHT as she promised she came; and she was not so soon in his bed but\nshe espied an armed knight coming toward the bed: therewithal she warned\nSir Gareth, and lightly through the good help of Dame Lionesse he was\narmed; and they hurtled together with great ire and malice all about\nthe hall; and there was great light as it had been the number of twenty\ntorches both before and behind, so that Sir Gareth strained him, so that\nhis old wound brast again a-bleeding; but he was hot and courageous and\ntook no keep, but with his great force he struck down that knight, and\nvoided his helm, and struck off his head. Then he hewed the head in an\nhundred pieces. And when he had done so he took up all those pieces, and\nthrew them out at a window into the ditches of the castle; and by this\ndone he was so faint that unnethes he might stand for bleeding. And by\nwhen he was almost unarmed he fell in a deadly swoon on the floor; and\nthen Dame Lionesse cried so that Sir Gringamore heard; and when he came\nand found Sir Gareth in that plight he made great sorrow; and there he\nawaked Sir Gareth, and gave him a drink that relieved him wonderly well;\nbut the sorrow that Dame Lionesse made there may no tongue tell, for she\nso fared with herself as she would have died.\n\nRight so came this damosel Linet before them all, and she had fetched\nall the gobbets of the head that Sir Gareth had thrown out at a window,\nand there she anointed them as she had done to-fore, and set them\ntogether again. Well, damosel Linet, said Sir Gareth, I have not\ndeserved all this despite that ye do unto me. Sir knight, she said, I\nhave nothing done but I will avow, and all that I have done shall be to\nyour worship, and to us all. And then was Sir Gareth staunched of his\nbleeding. But the leeches said that there was no man that bare the life\nshould heal him throughout of his wound but if they healed him that\ncaused that stroke by enchantment.\n\nSo leave we Sir Gareth there with Sir Gringamore and his sisters, and\nturn we unto King Arthur, that at the next feast of Pentecost held his\nfeast; and there came the Green Knight with fifty knights, and yielded\nthem all unto King Arthur. And so there came the Red Knight his brother,\nand yielded him to King Arthur, and three score knights with him. Also\nthere came the Blue Knight, brother to them, with an hundred knights,\nand yielded them unto King Arthur; and the Green Knight's name was\nPertolepe, and the Red Knight's name was Perimones, and the Blue\nKnight's name was Sir Persant of Inde. These three brethren told King\nArthur how they were overcome by a knight that a damosel had with her,\nand called him Beaumains. Jesu, said the king, I marvel what knight he\nis, and of what lineage he is come. He was with me a twelvemonth, and\npoorly and shamefully he was fostered, and Sir Kay in scorn named\nhim Beaumains. So right as the king stood so talking with these three\nbrethren, there came Sir Launcelot du Lake, and told the king that there\nwas come a goodly lord with six hundred knights with him.\n\nThen the king went out of Carlion, for there was the feast, and there\ncame to him this lord, and saluted the king in a goodly manner. What\nwill ye, said King Arthur, and what is your errand? Sir, he said, my\nname is the Red Knight of the Red Launds, but my name is Sir Ironside;\nand sir, wit ye well, here I am sent to you of a knight that is called\nBeaumains, for he won me in plain battle hand for hand, and so did never\nno knight but he, that ever had the better of me this thirty winter; the\nwhich commanded to yield me to you at your will. Ye are welcome, said\nthe king, for ye have been long a great foe to me and my court, and now\nI trust to God I shall so entreat you that ye shall be my friend. Sir,\nboth I and these five hundred knights shall always be at your summons to\ndo you service as may lie in our powers. Jesu mercy, said King Arthur, I\nam much beholden unto that knight that hath put so his body in devoir to\nworship me and my court. And as to thee, Ironside, that art called the\nRed Knight of the Red Launds, thou art called a perilous knight; and if\nthou wilt hold of me I shall worship thee and make thee knight of the\nTable Round; but then thou must be no more a murderer. Sir, as to that,\nI have promised unto Sir Beaumains never more to use such customs, for\nall the shameful customs that I used I did at the request of a lady\nthat I loved; and therefore I must go unto Sir Launcelot, and unto Sir\nGawaine, and ask them forgiveness of the evil will I had unto them; for\nall that I put to death was all only for the love of Sir Launcelot and\nof Sir Gawaine. They be here now, said the king, afore thee, now may ye\nsay to them what ye will. And then he kneeled down unto Sir Launcelot,\nand to Sir Gawaine, and prayed them of forgiveness of his enmity that\never he had against them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. How King Arthur pardoned them, and demanded of them where\nSir Gareth was.\n\nTHEN goodly they said all at once, God forgive you, and we do, and pray\nyou that ye will tell us where we may find Sir Beaumains. Fair lords,\nsaid Sir Ironside, I cannot tell you, for it is full hard to find him;\nfor such young knights as he is one, when they be in their adventures be\nnever abiding in no place. But to say the worship that the Red Knight\nof the Red Launds, and Sir Persant and his brother said of Beaumains, it\nwas marvel to hear. Well, my fair lords, said King Arthur, wit you well\nI shall do you honour for the love of Sir Beaumains, and as soon as ever\nI meet with him I shall make you all upon one day knights of the Table\nRound. And as to thee, Sir Persant of Inde, thou hast been ever called a\nfull noble knight, and so have ever been thy three brethren called.\nBut I marvel, said the king, that I hear not of the Black Knight your\nbrother, he was a full noble knight. Sir, said Pertolepe, the Green\nKnight, Sir Beaumains slew him in a recounter with his spear, his name\nwas Sir Percard. That was great pity, said the king, and so said many\nknights. For these four brethren were full well known in the court of\nKing Arthur for noble knights, for long time they had holden war against\nthe knights of the Round Table. Then said Pertolepe, the Green Knight,\nto the king: At a passage of the water of Mortaise there encountered\nSir Beaumains with two brethren that ever for the most part kept that\npassage, and they were two deadly knights, and there he slew the eldest\nbrother in the water, and smote him upon the head such a buffet that he\nfell down in the water, and there he was drowned, and his name was Sir\nGherard le Breusse; and after he slew the other brother upon the land,\nhis name was Sir Arnold le Breusse.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV[*3]\n\n\n[*3] In Caxton's edition this chapter is misnumbered XXVI., setting the\nnumeration wrong to the end of the book.\n\n\nHow the Queen of Orkney came to this feast of Pentecost, and Sir Gawaine\nand his brethren came to ask her blessing.\n\nSo then the king and they went to meat, and were served in the best\nmanner. And as they sat at the meat, there came in the Queen of Orkney,\nwith ladies and knights a great number. And then Sir Gawaine, Sir\nAgravaine, and Gaheris arose, and went to her and saluted her upon their\nknees, and asked her blessing; for in fifteen year they had not seen\nher. Then she spake on high to her brother King Arthur: Where have ye\ndone my young son Sir Gareth? He was here amongst you a twelvemonth,\nand ye made a kitchen knave of him, the which is shame to you all. Alas,\nwhere have ye done my dear son that was my joy and bliss? O dear mother,\nsaid Sir Gawaine, I knew him not. Nor I, said the king, that now me\nrepenteth, but thanked be God he is proved a worshipful knight as any is\nnow living of his years, and I shall never be glad till I may find him.\n\nAh, brother, said the Queen unto King Arthur, and unto Sir Gawaine, and\nto all her sons, ye did yourself great shame when ye amongst you kept my\nson in the kitchen and fed him like a poor hog. Fair sister, said King\nArthur, ye shall right well wit I knew him not, nor no more did Sir\nGawaine, nor his brethren; but sithen it is so, said the king, that\nhe is thus gone from us all, we must shape a remedy to find him. Also,\nsister, meseemeth ye might have done me to wit of his coming, and then\nan I had not done well to him ye might have blamed me. For when he came\nto this court he came leaning upon two men's shoulders, as though he\nmight not have gone. And then he asked me three gifts; and one he\nasked the same day, that was that I would give him meat enough that\ntwelvemonth; and the other two gifts he asked that day a twelvemonth,\nand that was that he might have the adventure of the damosel Linet, and\nthe third was that Sir Launcelot should make him knight when he desired\nhim. And so I granted him all his desire, and many in this court\nmarvelled that he desired his sustenance for a twelvemonth. And thereby,\nwe deemed, many of us, that he was not come of a noble house.\n\nSir, said the Queen of Orkney unto King Arthur her brother, wit ye well\nthat I sent him unto you right well armed and horsed, and worshipfully\nbeseen of his body, and gold and silver plenty to spend. It may be, said\nthe King, but thereof saw we none, save that same day as he departed\nfrom us, knights told me that there came a dwarf hither suddenly, and\nbrought him armour and a good horse full well and richly beseen; and\nthereat we all had marvel from whence that riches came, that we deemed\nall that he was come of men of worship. Brother, said the queen, all\nthat ye say I believe, for ever sithen he was grown he was marvellously\nwitted, and ever he was faithful and true of his promise. But I marvel,\nsaid she, that Sir Kay did mock him and scorn him, and gave him that\nname Beaumains; yet, Sir Kay, said the queen, named him more righteously\nthan he weened; for I dare say an he be alive, he is as fair an handed\nman and well disposed as any is living. Sir, said Arthur, let this\nlanguage be still, and by the grace of God he shall be found an he be\nwithin this seven realms, and let all this pass and be merry, for he is\nproved to be a man of worship, and that is my joy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. How King Arthur sent for the Lady Lionesse, and how she\nlet cry a tourney at her castle, whereas came many knights.\n\nTHEN said Sir Gawaine and his brethren unto Arthur, Sir, an ye will give\nus leave, we will go and seek our brother. Nay, said Sir Launcelot, that\nshall ye not need; and so said Sir Baudwin of Britain: for as by our\nadvice the king shall send unto Dame Lionesse a messenger, and pray her\nthat she will come to the court in all the haste that she may, and doubt\nye not she will come; and then she may give you best counsel where ye\nshall find him. This is well said of you, said the king. So then goodly\nletters were made, and the messenger sent forth, that night and day\nhe went till he came unto the Castle Perilous. And then the lady Dame\nLionesse was sent for, thereas she was with Sir Gringamore her brother\nand Sir Gareth. And when she understood this message, she bade him ride\non his way unto King Arthur, and she would come after in all goodly\nhaste. Then when she came to Sir Gringamore and to Sir Gareth, she told\nthem all how King Arthur had sent for her. That is because of me, said\nSir Gareth. Now advise me, said Dame Lionesse, what shall I say, and\nin what manner I shall rule me. My lady and my love, said Sir Gareth, I\npray you in no wise be ye aknowen where I am; but well I wot my mother\nis there and all my brethren, and they will take upon them to seek me, I\nwot well that they do. But this, madam, I would ye said and advised the\nking when he questioned with you of me. Then may ye say, this is your\nadvice that, an it like his good grace, ye will do make a cry against\nthe feast of the Assumption of our Lady, that what knight there proveth\nhim best he shall wield you and all your land. And if so be that he be\na wedded man, that his wife shall have the degree, and a coronal of\ngold beset with stones of virtue to the value of a thousand pound, and a\nwhite gerfalcon.\n\nSo Dame Lionesse departed and came to King Arthur, where she was nobly\nreceived, and there she was sore questioned of the king and of the Queen\nof Orkney. And she answered, where Sir Gareth was she could not tell.\nBut thus much she said unto Arthur: Sir, I will let cry a tournament\nthat shall be done before my castle at the Assumption of our Lady, and\nthe cry shall be this: that you, my lord Arthur, shall be there, and\nyour knights, and I will purvey that my knights shall be against yours;\nand then I am sure ye shall hear of Sir Gareth. This is well advised,\nsaid King Arthur; and so she departed. And the king and she made great\nprovision to that tournament.\n\nWhen Dame Lionesse was come to the Isle of Avilion, that was the same\nisle thereas her brother Sir Gringamore dwelt, then she told them all\nhow she had done, and what promise she had made to King Arthur. Alas,\nsaid Sir Gareth, I have been so wounded with unhappiness sithen I came\ninto this castle that I shall not be able to do at that tournament like\na knight; for I was never thoroughly whole since I was hurt. Be ye of\ngood cheer, said the damosel Linet, for I undertake within these fifteen\ndays to make ye whole, and as lusty as ever ye were. And then she laid\nan ointment and a salve to him as it pleased to her, that he was never\nso fresh nor so lusty. Then said the damosel Linet: Send you unto Sir\nPersant of Inde, and assummon him and his knights to be here with you\nas they have promised. Also, that ye send unto Sir Ironside, that is the\nRed Knight of the Red Launds, and charge him that he be ready with you\nwith his whole sum of knights, and then shall ye be able to match with\nKing Arthur and his knights. So this was done, and all knights were sent\nfor unto the Castle Perilous; and then the Red Knight answered and said\nunto Dame Lionesse, and to Sir Gareth, Madam, and my lord Sir Gareth, ye\nshall understand that I have been at the court of King Arthur, and Sir\nPersant of Inde and his brethren, and there we have done our homage as\nye commanded us. Also Sir Ironside said, I have taken upon me with\nSir Persant of Inde and his brethren to hold part against my lord Sir\nLauncelot and the knights of that court. And this have I done for the\nlove of my lady Dame Lionesse, and you my lord Sir Gareth. Ye have well\ndone, said Sir Gareth; but wit you well ye shall be full sore matched\nwith the most noble knights of the world; therefore we must purvey us\nof good knights, where we may get them. That is well said, said Sir\nPersant, and worshipfully.\n\nAnd so the cry was made in England, Wales, and Scotland, Ireland,\nCornwall, and in all the Out Isles, and in Brittany and in many\ncountries; that at the feast of our Lady the Assumption next coming, men\nshould come to the Castle Perilous beside the Isle of Avilion; and there\nall the knights that there came should have the choice whether them list\nto be on the one party with the knights of the castle, or on the\nother party with King Arthur. And two months was to the day that the\ntournament should be. And so there came many good knights that were at\ntheir large, and held them for the most part against King Arthur and his\nknights of the Round Table and came in the side of them of the\ncastle. For Sir Epinogrus was the first, and he was the king's son\nof Northumberland, and Sir Palamides the Saracen was another, and\nSir Safere his brother, and Sir Segwarides his brother, but they were\nchristened, and Sir Malegrine another, and Sir Brian de les Isles, a\nnoble knight, and Sir Grummore Grummursum, a good knight of Scotland,\nand Sir Carados of the dolorous tower, a noble knight, and Sir Turquine\nhis brother, and Sir Arnold and Sir Gauter, two brethren, good knights\nof Cornwall. There came Sir Tristram de Liones, and with him Sir Dinas,\nthe Seneschal, and Sir Sadok; but this Sir Tristram was not at that time\nknight of the Table Round, but he was one of the best knights of the\nworld. And so all these noble knights accompanied them with the lady of\nthe castle, and with the Red Knight of the Red Launds; but as for Sir\nGareth, he would not take upon him more but as other mean knights.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. How King Arthur went to the tournament with his knights,\nand how the lady received him worshipfully, and how the knights\nencountered.\n\nAND then there came with King Arthur Sir Gawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris,\nhis brethren. And then his nephews Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains, and Sir\nAglovale, Sir Tor, Sir Percivale de Galis, and Sir Lamorak de Galis.\nThen came Sir Launcelot du Lake with his brethren, nephews, and cousins,\nas Sir Lionel, Sir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors de Ganis, and Sir Galihodin,\nSir Galihud, and many more of Sir Launcelot's blood, and Sir Dinadan,\nSir La Cote Male Taile, his brother, a good knight, and Sir Sagramore,\na good knight; and all the most part of the Round Table. Also there came\nwith King Arthur these knights, the King of Ireland, King Agwisance, and\nthe King of Scotland, King Carados and King Uriens of the land of Gore,\nand King Bagdemagus and his son Sir Meliaganus, and Sir Galahault the\nnoble prince. All these kings, princes, and earls, barons, and other\nnoble knights, as Sir Brandiles, Sir Uwaine les Avoutres, and Sir Kay,\nSir Bedivere, Sir Meliot de Logres, Sir Petipase of Winchelsea, Sir\nGodelake: all these came with King Arthur, and more that cannot be\nrehearsed.\n\nNow leave we of these kings and knights, and let us speak of the great\narray that was made within the castle and about the castle for both\nparties. The Lady Dame Lionesse ordained great array upon her part for\nher noble knights, for all manner of lodging and victual that came by\nland and by water, that there lacked nothing for her party, nor for\nthe other, but there was plenty to be had for gold and silver for King\nArthur and his knights. And then there came the harbingers from King\nArthur for to harbour him, and his kings, dukes, earls, barons, and\nknights. And then Sir Gareth prayed Dame Lionesse and the Red Knight\nof the Red Launds, and Sir Persant and his brother, and Sir Gringamore,\nthat in no wise there should none of them tell not his name, and make\nno more of him than of the least knight that there was, For, he said,\nI will not be known of neither more nor less, neither at the beginning\nneither at the ending. Then Dame Lionesse said unto Sir Gareth: Sir, I\nwill lend you a ring, but I would pray you as you love me heartily let\nme have it again when the tournament is done, for that ring increaseth\nmy beauty much more than it is of himself. And the virtue of my ring is\nthat, that is green it will turn to red, and that is red it will turn in\nlikeness to green, and that is blue it will turn to likeness of white,\nand that is white it will turn in likeness to blue, and so it will do\nof all manner of colours. Also who that beareth my ring shall lose no\nblood, and for great love I will give you this ring. Gramercy, said Sir\nGareth, mine own lady, for this ring is passing meet for me, for it will\nturn all manner of likeness that I am in, and that shall cause me that\nI shall not be known. Then Sir Gringamore gave Sir Gareth a bay courser\nthat was a passing good horse; also he gave him good armour and sure,\nand a noble sword that sometime Sir Gringamore's father won upon\nan heathen tyrant. And so thus every knight made him ready to that\ntournament. And King Arthur was come two days to-fore the Assumption\nof our Lady. And there was all manner of royalty of all minstrelsy that\nmight be found. Also there came Queen Guenever and the Queen of Orkney,\nSir Gareth's mother.\n\nAnd upon the Assumption Day, when mass and matins were done, there were\nheralds with trumpets commanded to blow to the field. And so there came\nout Sir Epinogrus, the king's son of Northumberland, from the castle,\nand there encountered with him Sir Sagramore le Desirous, and either of\nthem brake their spears to their hands. And then came in Sir Palamides\nout of the castle, and there encountered with him Gawaine, and either\nof them smote other so hard that both the good knights and their horses\nfell to the earth. And then knights of either party rescued their\nknights. And then came in Sir Safere and Sir Segwarides, brethren to Sir\nPalamides; and there encountered Sir Agravaine with Sir Safere and\nSir Gaheris encountered with Sir Segwarides. So Sir Safere smote down\nAgravaine, Sir Gawaine's brother; and Sir Segwarides, Sir Safere's\nbrother. And Sir Malegrine, a knight of the castle, encountered with Sir\nUwaine le Blanchemains, and there Sir Uwaine gave Sir Malegrine a fall,\nthat he had almost broke his neck.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. How the knights bare them in the battle.\n\nTHEN Sir Brian de les Isles and Grummore Grummursum, knights of the\ncastle, encountered with Sir Aglovale, and Sir Tor smote down Sir\nGrummore Grummursum to the earth. Then came in Sir Carados of the\ndolorous tower, and Sir Turquine, knights of the castle; and there\nencountered with them Sir Percivale de Galis and Sir Lamorak de Galis,\nthat were two brethren. And there encountered Sir Percivale with Sir\nCarados, and either brake their spears unto their hands, and then Sir\nTurquine with Sir Lamorak, and either of them smote down other's horse\nand all to the earth, and either parties rescued other, and horsed them\nagain. And Sir Arnold and Sir Gauter, knights of the castle, encountered\nwith Sir Brandiles and Sir Kay, and these four knights encountered\nmightily, and brake their spears to their hands. Then came in Sir\nTristram, Sir Sadok, and Sir Dinas, knights of the castle, and there\nencountered Sir Tristram with Sir Bedivere, and there Sir Bedivere was\nsmitten to the earth both horse and man. And Sir Sadok encountered with\nSir Petipase, and there Sir Sadok was overthrown. And there Uwaine les\nAvoutres smote down Sir Dinas, the Seneschal. Then came in Sir Persant\nof Inde, a knight of the castle, and there encountered with him Sir\nLauncelot du Lake, and there he smote Sir Persant, horse and man, to the\nearth. Then came Sir Pertolepe from the castle, and there encountered\nwith him Sir Lionel, and there Sir Pertolepe, the Green Knight, smote\ndown Sir Lionel, brother to Sir Launcelot. All this was marked by noble\nheralds, who bare him best, and their names.\n\nAnd then came into the field Sir Perimones, the Red Knight, Sir\nPersant's brother, that was a knight of the castle, and he encountered\nwith Sir Ector de Maris, and either smote other so hard that both their\nhorses and they fell to the earth. And then came in the Red Knight of\nthe Red Launds, and Sir Gareth, from the castle, and there encountered\nwith them Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir Bleoberis, and there the Red Knight\nand Sir Bors [either] smote other so hard that their spears brast, and\ntheir horses fell grovelling to the earth. Then Sir Bleoberis brake\nhis spear upon Sir Gareth, but of that stroke Sir Bleoberis fell to the\nearth. When Sir Galihodin saw that he bade Sir Gareth keep him, and Sir\nGareth smote him to the earth. Then Sir Galihud gat a spear to avenge\nhis brother, and in the same wise Sir Gareth served him, and Sir Dinadan\nand his brother, La Cote Male Taile, and Sir Sagramore le Desirous, and\nSir Dodinas le Savage. All these he bare down with one spear.\n\nWhen King Agwisance of Ireland saw Sir Gareth fare so, he marvelled what\nhe might be that one time seemed green, and another time, at his again\ncoming, he seemed blue. And thus at every course that he rode to and fro\nhe changed his colour, so that there might neither king nor knight\nhave ready cognisance of him. Then Sir Agwisance, the King of Ireland,\nencountered with Sir Gareth, and there Sir Gareth smote him from his\nhorse, saddle and all. And then came King Carados of Scotland, and Sir\nGareth smote him down horse and man. And in the same wise he served King\nUriens of the land of Gore. And then came in Sir Bagdemagus, and Sir\nGareth smote him down, horse and man, to the earth. And Bagdemagus' son,\nMeliganus, brake a spear upon Sir Gareth mightily and knightly. And then\nSir Galahault, the noble prince, cried on high: Knight with the many\ncolours, well hast thou jousted; now make thee ready that I may joust\nwith thee. Sir Gareth heard him, and he gat a great spear, and so they\nencountered together, and there the prince brake his spear; but Sir\nGareth smote him upon the left side of the helm that he reeled here and\nthere, and he had fallen down had not his men recovered him.\n\nSo God me help, said King Arthur, that same knight with the many colours\nis a good knight. Wherefore the king called unto him Sir Launcelot, and\nprayed him to encounter with that knight. Sir, said Launcelot, I may\nwell find in my heart for to forbear him as at this time, for he hath\nhad travail enough this day; and when a good knight doth so well upon\nsome day, it is no good knight's part to let him of his worship,\nand namely, when he seeth a knight hath done so great labour; for\nperadventure, said Sir Launcelot, his quarrel is here this day, and\nperadventure he is best beloved with this lady of all that be here;\nfor I see well he paineth him and enforceth him to do great deeds, and\ntherefore, said Sir Launcelot, as for me, this day he shall have the\nhonour; though it lay in my power to put him from it I would not.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. Yet of the said tournament.\n\nTHEN when this was done there was drawing of swords, and then there\nbegan a sore tournament. And there did Sir Lamorak marvellous deeds of\narms; and betwixt Sir Lamorak and Sir Ironside, that was the Red Knight\nof the Red Launds, there was strong battle; and betwixt Sir Palamides\nand Bleoberis there was a strong battle; and Sir Gawaine and Sir\nTristram met, and there Sir Gawaine had the worse, for he pulled Sir\nGawaine from his horse, and there he was long upon foot, and defouled.\nThen came in Sir Launcelot, and he smote Sir Turquine, and he him; and\nthen came Sir Carados his brother, and both at once they assailed him,\nand he as the most noblest knight of the world worshipfully fought with\nthem both, that all men wondered of the noblesse of Sir Launcelot. And\nthen came in Sir Gareth, and knew that it was Sir Launcelot that fought\nwith the two perilous knights. And then Sir Gareth came with his good\nhorse and hurtled them in-sunder, and no stroke would he smite to Sir\nLauncelot. That espied Sir Launcelot, and deemed it should be the good\nknight Sir Gareth: and then Sir Gareth rode here and there, and smote\non the right hand and on the left hand, and all the folk might well espy\nwhere that he rode. And by fortune he met with his brother Sir Gawaine,\nand there he put Sir Gawaine to the worse, for he put off his helm, and\nso he served five or six knights of the Round Table, that all men said\nhe put him in the most pain, and best he did his devoir. For when Sir\nTristram beheld him how he first jousted and after fought so well with\na sword, then he rode unto Sir Ironside and to Sir Persant of Inde, and\nasked them, by their faith, What manner a knight is yonder knight that\nseemeth in so many divers colours? Truly, meseemeth, said Tristram, that\nhe putteth himself in great pain, for he never ceaseth. Wot ye not what\nhe is? said Sir Ironside. No, said Sir Tristram. Then shall ye know that\nthis is he that loveth the lady of the castle, and she him again; and\nthis is he that won me when I besieged the lady of this castle, and this\nis he that won Sir Persant of Inde, and his three brethren. What is his\nname, said Sir Tristram, and of what blood is he come? He was called in\nthe court of King Arthur, Beaumains, but his right name is Sir Gareth of\nOrkney, brother to Sir Gawaine. By my head, said Sir Tristram, he is a\ngood knight, and a big man of arms, and if he be young he shall prove\na full noble knight. He is but a child, they all said, and of Sir\nLauncelot he was made knight. Therefore he is mickle the better, said\nTristram. And then Sir Tristram, Sir Ironside, Sir Persant, and his\nbrother, rode together for to help Sir Gareth; and then there were given\nmany strong strokes.\n\nAnd then Sir Gareth rode out on the one side to amend his helm; and then\nsaid his dwarf: Take me your ring, that ye lose it not while that ye\ndrink. And so when he had drunk he gat on his helm, and eagerly took his\nhorse and rode into the field, and left his ring with his dwarf; and the\ndwarf was glad the ring was from him, for then he wist well he should be\nknown. And then when Sir Gareth was in the field all folks saw him well\nand plainly that he was in yellow colours; and there he rased off helms\nand pulled down knights, that King Arthur had marvel what knight he was,\nfor the king saw by his hair that it was the same knight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX. How Sir Gareth was espied by the heralds, and how he\nescaped out of the field.\n\nBUT before he was in so many colours, and now he is but in one colour;\nthat is yellow. Now go, said King Arthur unto divers heralds, and ride\nabout him, and espy what manner knight he is, for I have spered of many\nknights this day that be upon his party, and all say they know him not.\nAnd so an herald rode nigh Gareth as he could; and there he saw written\nabout his helm in gold, This helm is Sir Gareth of Orkney. Then the\nherald cried as he were wood, and many heralds with him:--This is Sir\nGareth of Orkney in the yellow arms; wherby[*4] all kings and knights\nof Arthur's beheld him and awaited; and then they pressed all to behold\nhim, and ever the heralds cried: This is Sir Gareth of Orkney, King\nLot's son. And when Sir Gareth espied that he was discovered, then he\ndoubled his strokes, and smote down Sir Sagramore, and his brother\nSir Gawaine. O brother, said Sir Gawaine, I weened ye would not have\nstricken me.\n\n\n[*4] So W. de Worde; Caxton \"that by.\"\n\n\n\nSo when he heard him say so he thrang here and there, and so with great\npain he gat out of the press, and there he met with his dwarf. O boy,\nsaid Sir Gareth, thou hast beguiled me foul this day that thou kept my\nring; give it me anon again, that I may hide my body withal; and so he\ntook it him. And then they all wist not where he was become; and Sir\nGawaine had in manner espied where Sir Gareth rode, and then he rode\nafter with all his might. That espied Sir Gareth, and rode lightly into\nthe forest, that Sir Gawaine wist not where he was become. And when\nSir Gareth wist that Sir Gawaine was passed, he asked the dwarf of best\ncounsel. Sir, said the dwarf, meseemeth it were best, now that ye are\nescaped from spying, that ye send my lady Dame Lionesse her ring. It is\nwell advised, said Sir Gareth; now have it here and bear it to her, and\nsay that I recommend me unto her good grace, and say her I will come\nwhen I may, and I pray her to be true and faithful to me as I will be to\nher. Sir, said the dwarf, it shall be done as ye command: and so he rode\nhis way, and did his errand unto the lady. Then she said, Where is my\nknight, Sir Gareth? Madam, said the dwarf, he bade me say that he would\nnot be long from you. And so lightly the dwarf came again unto Sir\nGareth, that would full fain have had a lodging, for he had need to be\nreposed. And then fell there a thunder and a rain, as heaven and earth\nshould go together. And Sir Gareth was not a little weary, for of all\nthat day he had but little rest, neither his horse nor he. So this Sir\nGareth rode so long in that forest until the night came. And ever it\nlightened and thundered, as it had been wood. At the last by fortune he\ncame to a castle, and there he heard the waits upon the walls.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI. How Sir Gareth came to a castle where he was well lodged,\nand he jousted with a knight and slew him.\n\nTHEN Sir Gareth rode unto the barbican of the castle, and prayed the\nporter fair to let him into the castle. The porter answered ungoodly\nagain, and said, Thou gettest no lodging here. Fair sir, say not so, for\nI am a knight of King Arthur's, and pray the lord or the lady of this\ncastle to give me harbour for the love of King Arthur. Then the porter\nwent unto the duchess, and told her how there was a knight of King\nArthur's would have harbour. Let him in, said the duchess, for I will\nsee that knight, and for King Arthur's sake he shall not be harbourless.\nThen she yode up into a tower over the gate, with great torchlight.\n\nWhen Sir Gareth saw that torch-light he cried on high: Whether thou\nbe lord or lady, giant or champion, I take no force so that I may have\nharbour this night; and if it so be that I must needs fight, spare me\nnot to-morn when I have rested me, for both I and mine horse be weary.\nSir knight, said the lady, thou speakest knightly and boldly; but wit\nthou well the lord of this castle loveth not King Arthur, nor none of\nhis court, for my lord hath ever been against him; and therefore thou\nwere better not to come within this castle; for an thou come in this\nnight, thou must come in under such form, that wheresomever thou meet\nmy lord, by stigh or by street, thou must yield thee to him as prisoner.\nMadam, said Sir Gareth, what is your lord, and what is his name? Sir,\nmy lord's name is the Duke de la Rowse. Well madam, said Sir Gareth, I\nshall promise you in what place I meet your lord I shall yield me unto\nhim and to his good grace; with that I understand he will do me no harm:\nand if I understand that he will, I will release myself an I can with my\nspear and my sword. Ye say well, said the duchess; and then she let the\ndrawbridge down, and so he rode into the hall, and there he alighted,\nand his horse was led into a stable; and in the hall he unarmed him\nand said, Madam, I will not out of this hall this night; and when it\nis daylight, let see who will have ado with me, he shall find me ready.\nThen was he set unto supper, and had many good dishes. Then Sir Gareth\nlist well to eat, and knightly he ate his meat, and eagerly; there was\nmany a fair lady by him, and some said they never saw a goodlier man nor\nso well of eating. Then they made him passing good cheer, and shortly\nwhen he had supped his bed was made there; so he rested him all night.\n\nAnd on the morn he heard mass, and brake his fast and took his leave at\nthe duchess, and at them all; and thanked her goodly of her lodging,\nand of his good cheer; and then she asked him his name. Madam, he said,\ntruly my name is Gareth of Orkney, and some men call me Beaumains. Then\nknew she well it was the same knight that fought for Dame Lionesse. So\nSir Gareth departed and rode up into a mountain, and there met him a\nknight, his name was Sir Bendelaine, and said to Sir Gareth: Thou shalt\nnot pass this way, for either thou shalt joust with me, or else be my\nprisoner. Then will I joust, said Sir Gareth. And so they let their\nhorses run, and there Sir Gareth smote him throughout the body; and Sir\nBendelaine rode forth to his castle there beside, and there died. So Sir\nGareth would have rested him, and he came riding to Bendelaine's castle.\nThen his knights and servants espied that it was he that had slain their\nlord. Then they armed twenty good men, and came out and assailed Sir\nGareth; and so he had no spear, but his sword, and put his shield afore\nhim; and there they brake their spears upon him, and they assailed him\npassingly sore. But ever Sir Gareth defended him as a knight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII. How Sir Gareth fought with a knight that held within his\ncastle thirty ladies, and how he slew him.\n\nSO when they saw that they might not overcome him, they rode from him,\nand took their counsel to slay his horse; and so they came in upon Sir\nGareth, and with spears they slew his horse, and then they assailed him\nhard. But when he was on foot, there was none that he fought but he gave\nhim such a buffet that he did never recover. So he slew them by one and\none till they were but four, and there they fled; and Sir Gareth took a\ngood horse that was one of theirs, and rode his way.\n\nThen he rode a great pace till that he came to a castle, and there he\nheard much mourning of ladies and gentlewomen. So there came by him\na page. What noise is this, said Sir Gareth, that I hear within this\ncastle? Sir knight, said the page, here be within this castle thirty\nladies, and all they be widows; for here is a knight that waiteth daily\nupon this castle, and his name is the Brown Knight without Pity, and\nhe is the periloust knight that now liveth; and therefore sir, said the\npage, I rede you flee. Nay, said Sir Gareth, I will not flee though thou\nbe afeard of him. And then the page saw where came the Brown Knight: Lo,\nsaid the page, yonder he cometh. Let me deal with him, said Sir Gareth.\nAnd when either of other had a sight they let their horses run, and the\nBrown Knight brake his spear, and Sir Gareth smote him throughout the\nbody, that he overthrew him to the ground stark dead. So Sir Gareth rode\ninto the castle, and prayed the ladies that he might repose him. Alas,\nsaid the ladies, ye may not be lodged here. Make him good cheer, said\nthe page, for this knight hath slain your enemy. Then they all made him\ngood cheer as lay in their power. But wit ye well they made him good\ncheer, for they might none otherwise do, for they were but poor.\n\nAnd so on the morn he went to mass, and there he saw the thirty ladies\nkneel, and lay grovelling upon divers tombs, making great dole and\nsorrow. Then Sir Gareth wist well that in the tombs lay their lords.\nFair ladies, said Sir Gareth, ye must at the next feast of Pentecost\nbe at the court of King Arthur, and say that I, Sir Gareth, sent you\nthither. We shall do this, said the ladies. So he departed, and by\nfortune he came to a mountain, and there he found a goodly knight that\nbade him, Abide sir knight, and joust with me. What are ye? said Sir\nGareth. My name is, said he, the Duke de la Rowse. Ah sir, ye are the\nsame knight that I lodged once in your castle; and there I made promise\nunto your lady that I should yield me unto you. Ah, said the duke,\nart thou that proud knight that profferest to fight with my knights;\ntherefore make thee ready, for I will have ado with you. So they let\ntheir horses run, and there Sir Gareth smote the duke down from his\nhorse. But the duke lightly avoided his horse, and dressed his shield\nand drew his sword, and bade Sir Gareth alight and fight with him. So\nhe did alight, and they did great battle together more than an hour, and\neither hurt other full sore. At the last Sir Gareth gat the duke to the\nearth, and would have slain him, and then he yield him to him. Then must\nye go, said Sir Gareth, unto Sir Arthur my lord at the next feast, and\nsay that I, Sir Gareth of Orkney, sent you unto him. It shall be done,\nsaid the duke, and I will do to you homage and fealty with an hundred\nknights with me; and all the days of my life to do you service where ye\nwill command me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII. How Sir Gareth and Sir Gawaine fought each against\nother, and how they knew each other by the damosel Linet.\n\nSO the duke departed, and Sir Gareth stood there alone; and there he\nsaw an armed knight coming toward him. Then Sir Gareth took the duke's\nshield, and mounted upon horseback, and so without biding they ran\ntogether as it had been the thunder. And there that knight hurt Sir\nGareth under the side with his spear. And then they alighted and drew\ntheir swords, and gave great strokes that the blood trailed to the\nground. And so they fought two hours.\n\nAt the last there came the damosel Linet, that some men called the\ndamosel Savage, and she came riding upon an ambling mule; and there she\ncried all on high, Sir Gawaine, Sir Gawaine, leave thy fighting with\nthy brother Sir Gareth. And when he heard her say so he threw away his\nshield and his sword, and ran to Sir Gareth, and took him in his arms,\nand sithen kneeled down and asked him mercy. What are ye, said Sir\nGareth, that right now were so strong and so mighty, and now so suddenly\nyield you to me? O Gareth, I am your brother Sir Gawaine, that for your\nsake have had great sorrow and labour. Then Sir Gareth unlaced his helm,\nand kneeled down to him, and asked him mercy. Then they rose both, and\nembraced either other in their arms, and wept a great while or they\nmight speak, and either of them gave other the prize of the battle. And\nthere were many kind words between them. Alas, my fair brother, said Sir\nGawaine, perdy I owe of right to worship you an ye were not my brother,\nfor ye have worshipped King Arthur and all his court, for ye have sent\nhim[*5] more worshipful knights this twelvemonth than six the best of\nthe Round Table have done, except Sir Launcelot.\n\n\n[*5] So W. de Worde; Caxton \"me.\"\n\n\n\n\nThen came the damosel Savage that was the Lady Linet, that rode with Sir\nGareth so long, and there she did staunch Sir Gareth's wounds and Sir\nGawaine's. Now what will ye do? said the damosel Savage; meseemeth that\nit were well done that Arthur had witting of you both, for your horses\nare so bruised that they may not bear. Now, fair damosel, said Sir\nGawaine, I pray you ride unto my lord mine uncle, King Arthur, and tell\nhim what adventure is to me betid here, and I suppose he will not tarry\nlong. Then she took her mule, and lightly she came to King Arthur that\nwas but two mile thence. And when she had told him tidings the king bade\nget him a palfrey. And when he was upon his back he bade the lords and\nladies come after, who that would; and there was saddling and bridling\nof queens' horses and princes' horses, and well was him that soonest\nmight be ready.\n\nSo when the king came thereas they were, he saw Sir Gawaine and Sir\nGareth sit upon a little hill-side, and then the king avoided his horse.\nAnd when he came nigh Sir Gareth he would have spoken but he might not;\nand therewith he sank down in a swoon for gladness. And so they stert\nunto their uncle, and required him of his good grace to be of good\ncomfort. Wit ye well the king made great joy, and many a piteous\ncomplaint he made to Sir Gareth, and ever he wept as he had been a\nchild. With that came his mother, the Queen of Orkney, Dame Morgawse,\nand when she saw Sir Gareth readily in the visage she might not weep,\nbut suddenly fell down in a swoon, and lay there a great while like as\nshe had been dead. And then Sir Gareth recomforted his mother in such\nwise that she recovered and made good cheer. Then the king commanded\nthat all manner of knights that were under his obeissance should make\ntheir lodging right there for the love of his nephews. And so it was\ndone, and all manner of purveyance purveyed, that there lacked nothing\nthat might be gotten of tame nor wild for gold or silver. And then by\nthe means of the damosel Savage Sir Gawaine and Sir Gareth were healed\nof their wounds; and there they sojourned eight days.\n\n\nThen said King Arthur unto the damosel Savage: I marvel that your\nsister, Dame Lionesse, cometh not here to me, and in especial that she\ncometh not to visit her knight, my nephew Sir Gareth, that hath had so\nmuch travail for her love. My lord, said the damosel Linet, ye must of\nyour good grace hold her excused, for she knoweth not that my lord,\nSir Gareth, is here. Go then for her, said King Arthur, that we may\nbe appointed what is best to be done, according to the pleasure of my\nnephew. Sir, said the damosel, that shall be done, and so she rode unto\nher sister. And as lightly as she might she made her ready; and she came\non the morn with her brother Sir Gringamore, and with her forty knights.\nAnd so when she was come she had all the cheer that might be done, both\nof the king, and of many other kings and queens.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV. How Sir Gareth acknowledged that they loved each other to\nKing Arthur, and of the appointment of their wedding.\n\nAND among all these ladies she was named the fairest, and peerless. Then\nwhen Sir Gawaine saw her there was many a goodly look and goodly words,\nthat all men of worship had joy to behold them. Then came King Arthur\nand many other kings, and Dame Guenever, and the Queen of Orkney. And\nthere the king asked his nephew, Sir Gareth, whether he would have that\nlady as paramour, or to have her to his wife. My lord, wit you well that\nI love her above all ladies living. Now, fair lady, said King Arthur,\nwhat say ye? Most noble King, said Dame Lionesse, wit you well that my\nlord, Sir Gareth, is to me more liefer to have and wield as my husband,\nthan any king or prince that is christened; and if I may not have him\nI promise you I will never have none. For, my lord Arthur, said Dame\nLionesse, wit ye well he is my first love, and he shall be the last;\nand if ye will suffer him to have his will and free choice I dare say\nhe will have me. That is truth, said Sir Gareth; an I have not you and\nwield not you as my wife, there shall never lady nor gentlewoman rejoice\nme. What, nephew, said the king, is the wind in that door? for wit ye\nwell I would not for the stint of my crown to be causer to withdraw\nyour hearts; and wit ye well ye cannot love so well but I shall rather\nincrease it than distress it. And also ye shall have my love and my\nlordship in the uttermost wise that may lie in my power. And in the same\nwise said Sir Gareth's mother.\n\nThen there was made a provision for the day of marriage; and by the\nking's advice it was provided that it should be at Michaelmas following,\nat Kink Kenadon by the seaside, for there is a plentiful country. And\nso it was cried in all the places through the realm. And then Sir Gareth\nsent his summons to all these knights and ladies that he had won in\nbattle to-fore, that they should be at his day of marriage at Kink\nKenadon by the sands. And then Dame Lionesse, and the damosel Linet with\nSir Gringamore, rode to their castle; and a goodly and a rich ring she\ngave to Sir Gareth, and he gave her another. And King Arthur gave her a\nrich pair of beads[*6] of gold; and so she departed; and King Arthur and\nhis fellowship rode toward Kink Kenadon, and Sir Gareth brought his lady\non the way, and so came to the king again and rode with him. Lord! the\ngreat cheer that Sir Launcelot made of Sir Gareth and he of him, for\nthere was never no knight that Sir Gareth loved so well as he did Sir\nLauncelot; and ever for the most part he would be in Sir Launcelot's\ncompany; for after Sir Gareth had espied Sir Gawaine's conditions, he\nwithdrew himself from his brother, Sir Gawaine's, fellowship, for he was\nvengeable, and where he hated he would be avenged with murder, and that\nhated Sir Gareth.\n\n\n[*6] So W. de Worde; Caxton \"bee.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV. Of the Great Royalty, and what officers were made at the\nfeast of the wedding, and of the jousts at the feast.\n\nSO it drew fast to Michaelmas; and thither came Dame Lionesse, the lady\nof the Castle Perilous, and her sister, Dame Linet, with Sir Gringamore,\nher brother, with them for he had the conduct of these ladies. And there\nthey were lodged at the device of King Arthur. And upon Michaelmas Day\nthe Bishop of Canterbury made the wedding betwixt Sir Gareth and the\nLady Lionesse with great solemnity. And King Arthur made Gaheris to\nwed the Damosel Savage, that was Dame Linet; and King Arthur made Sir\nAgravaine to wed Dame Lionesse's niece, a fair lady, her name was Dame\nLaurel.\n\nAnd so when this solemnization was done, then came in the Green Knight,\nSir Pertolepe, with thirty knights, and there he did homage and fealty\nto Sir Gareth, and these knights to hold of him for evermore. Also Sir\nPertolepe said: I pray you that at this feast I may be your chamberlain.\nWith a good will, said Sir Gareth sith it liketh you to take so simple\nan office. Then came in the Red Knight, with three score knights with\nhim, and did to Sir Gareth homage and fealty, and all those knights to\nhold of him for evermore. And then this Sir Perimones prayed Sir Gareth\nto grant him to be his chief butler at that high feast. I will well,\nsaid Sir Gareth, that ye have this office, and it were better. Then came\nin Sir Persant of Inde, with an hundred knights with him, and there he\ndid homage and fealty, and all his knights should do him service, and\nhold their lands of him for ever; and there he prayed Sir Gareth to make\nhim his sewer-chief at the feast. I will well, said Sir Gareth, that\nye have it and it were better. Then came the Duke de la Rowse with an\nhundred knights with him, and there he did homage and fealty to Sir\nGareth, and so to hold their lands of him for ever. And he required Sir\nGareth that he might serve him of the wine that day of that feast. I\nwill well, said Sir Gareth, and it were better. Then came in the Red\nKnight of the Red Launds, that was Sir Ironside, and he brought with him\nthree hundred knights, and there he did homage and fealty, and all\nthese knights to hold their lands of him for ever. And then he asked Sir\nGareth to be his carver. I will well, said Sir Gareth, an it please you.\n\nThen came into the court thirty ladies, and all they seemed widows, and\nthose thirty ladies brought with them many fair gentlewomen. And all\nthey kneeled down at once unto King Arthur and unto Sir Gareth, and\nthere all those ladies told the king how Sir Gareth delivered them\nfrom the dolorous tower, and slew the Brown Knight without Pity: And\ntherefore we, and our heirs for evermore, will do homage unto Sir Gareth\nof Orkney. So then the kings and queens, princes and earls, barons and\nmany bold knights, went unto meat; and well may ye wit there were all\nmanner of meat plenteously, all manner revels and games, with all manner\nof minstrelsy that was used in those days. Also there was great jousts\nthree days. But the king would not suffer Sir Gareth to joust, because\nof his new bride; for, as the French book saith, that Dame Lionesse\ndesired of the king that none that were wedded should joust at that\nfeast.\n\nSo the first day there jousted Sir Lamorak de Galis, for he overthrew\nthirty knights, and did passing marvellously deeds of arms; and then\nKing Arthur made Sir Persant and his two brethren Knights of the Round\nTable to their lives' end, and gave them great lands. Also the second\nday there jousted Tristram best, and he overthrew forty knights, and\ndid there marvellous deeds of arms. And there King Arthur made Ironside,\nthat was the Red Knight of the Red Launds, a Knight of the Table Round\nto his life's end, and gave him great lands. The third day there jousted\nSir Launcelot du Lake, and he overthrew fifty knights, and did many\nmarvellous deeds of arms, that all men wondered on him. And there King\nArthur made the Duke de la Rowse a Knight of the Round Table to his\nlife's end, and gave him great lands to spend. But when these jousts\nwere done, Sir Lamorak and Sir Tristram departed suddenly, and would\nnot be known, for the which King Arthur and all the court were sore\ndispleased. And so they held the court forty days with great solemnity.\nAnd this Sir Gareth was a noble knight, and a well-ruled, and\nfair-languaged.\n\n\nThus endeth this tale of Sir Gareth of Orkney that wedded Dame Lionesse\nof the Castle Perilous. And also Sir Gaheris wedded her sister, Dame\nLinet, that was called the Damosel Sabage. And Sir Agrabaine wedded Dame\nLaurel, a fair lady and great, and mighty lands with great riches gave\nwith them King Arthur, that royally they might live till their lives'\nend.\n\nHere followeth the viii. book, the which is the first book of Sir\nTristram de Liones, and who was his father and his mother, and how he\nwas born and fostered, and how he was made knight.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VIII\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How Sir Tristram de Liones was born, and how his mother died\nat his birth, wherefore she named him Tristram.\n\nIT was a king that hight Meliodas, and he was lord and king of the\ncountry of Liones, and this Meliodas was a likely knight as any was that\ntime living. And by fortune he wedded King Mark's sister of Cornwall,\nand she was called Elizabeth, that was called both good and fair. And at\nthat time King Arthur reigned, and he was whole king of England, Wales,\nand Scotland, and of many other realms: howbeit there were many kings\nthat were lords of many countries, but all they held their lands of King\nArthur; for in Wales were two kings, and in the north were many kings;\nand in Cornwall and in the west were two kings; also in Ireland were two\nor three kings, and all were under the obeissance of King Arthur. So was\nthe King of France, and the King of Brittany, and all the lordships unto\nRome.\n\nSo when this King Meliodas had been with his wife, within a while she\nwaxed great with child, and she was a full meek lady, and well she loved\nher lord, and he her again, so there was great joy betwixt them. Then\nthere was a lady in that country that had loved King Meliodas long, and\nby no mean she never could get his love; therefore she let ordain upon\na day, as King Meliodas rode a-hunting, for he was a great chaser, and\nthere by an enchantment she made him chase an hart by himself alone till\nthat he came to an old castle, and there anon he was taken prisoner by\nthe lady that him loved. When Elizabeth, King Meliodas' wife, missed her\nlord, and she was nigh out of her wit, and also as great with child as\nshe was, she took a gentlewoman with her, and ran into the forest to\nseek her lord. And when she was far in the forest she might no farther,\nfor she began to travail fast of her child. And she had many grimly\nthroes; her gentlewoman helped her all that she might, and so by miracle\nof Our Lady of Heaven she was delivered with great pains. But she had\ntaken such cold for the default of help that deep draughts of death took\nher, that needs she must die and depart out of this world; there was\nnone other bote.\n\nAnd when this Queen Elizabeth saw that there was none other bote, then\nshe made great dole, and said unto her gentlewoman: When ye see my lord,\nKing Meliodas, recommend me unto him, and tell him what pains I endure\nhere for his love, and how I must die here for his sake for default of\ngood help; and let him wit that I am full sorry to depart out of this\nworld from him, therefore pray him to be friend to my soul. Now let me\nsee my little child, for whom I have had all this sorrow. And when she\nsaw him she said thus: Ah, my little son, thou hast murdered thy mother,\nand therefore I suppose, thou that art a murderer so young, thou art\nfull likely to be a manly man in thine age. And because I shall die of\nthe birth of thee, I charge thee, gentlewoman, that thou pray my lord,\nKing Meliodas, that when he is christened let call him Tristram, that\nis as much to say as a sorrowful birth. And therewith this queen gave\nup the ghost and died. Then the gentlewoman laid her under an umbre of a\ngreat tree, and then she lapped the child as well as she might for cold.\nRight so there came the barons, following after the queen, and when\nthey saw that she was dead, and understood none other but the king was\ndestroyed, [*7]then certain of them would have slain the child, because\nthey would have been lords of the country of Liones.\n\n\n[*7] Printed by Caxton as part of chap. ii.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How the stepmother of Sir Tristram had ordained poison for\nto have poisoned Sir Tristram.\n\nBUT then through the fair speech of the gentlewoman, and by the means\nthat she made, the most part of the barons would not assent thereto. And\nthen they let carry home the dead queen, and much dole was made for her.\n\nThen this meanwhile Merlin delivered King Meliodas out of prison on the\nmorn after his queen was dead. And so when the king was come home the\nmost part of the barons made great joy. But the sorrow that the king\nmade for his queen that might no tongue tell. So then the king let\ninter her richly, and after he let christen his child as his wife\nhad commanded afore her death. And then he let call him Tristram, the\nsorrowful born child. Then the King Meliodas endured seven years without\na wife, and all this time Tristram was nourished well. Then it befell\nthat King Meliodas wedded King Howell's daughter of Brittany, and anon\nshe had children of King Meliodas: then was she heavy and wroth that her\nchildren should not rejoice the country of Liones, wherefore this queen\nordained for to poison young Tristram. So she let poison be put in a\npiece of silver in the chamber whereas Tristram and her children were\ntogether, unto that intent that when Tristram were thirsty he should\ndrink that drink. And so it fell upon a day, the queen's son, as he was\nin that chamber, espied the piece with poison, and he weened it had been\ngood drink, and because the child was thirsty he took the piece with\npoison and drank freely; and therewithal suddenly the child brast and\nwas dead.\n\nWhen the queen of Meliodas wist of the death of her son, wit ye well\nthat she was heavy. But yet the king understood nothing of her treason.\nNotwithstanding the queen would not leave this, but eft she let ordain\nmore poison, and put it in a piece. And by fortune King Meliodas, her\nhusband, found the piece with wine where was the poison, and he that was\nmuch thirsty took the piece for to drink thereout. And as he would have\ndrunken thereof the queen espied him, and then she ran unto him, and\npulled the piece from him suddenly. The king marvelled why she did so,\nand remembered him how her son was suddenly slain with poison. And then\nhe took her by the hand, and said: Thou false traitress, thou shalt\ntell me what manner of drink this is, or else I shall slay thee. And\ntherewith he pulled out his sword, and sware a great oath that he should\nslay her but if she told him truth. Ah! mercy, my lord, said she, and\nI shall tell you all. And then she told him why she would have slain\nTristram, because her children should rejoice his land. Well, said King\nMeliodas, and therefore shall ye have the law. And so she was condemned\nby the assent of the barons to be burnt; and then was there made a great\nfire, and right as she was at the fire to take her execution, young\nTristram kneeled afore King Meliodas, and besought him to give him a\nboon. I will well, said the king again. Then said young Tristram, Give\nme the life of thy queen, my stepmother. That is unrightfully asked,\nsaid King Meliodas, for thou ought of right to hate her, for she would\nhave slain thee with that poison an she might have had her will; and for\nthy sake most is my cause that she should die.\n\nSir, said Tristram, as for that, I beseech you of your mercy that you\nwill forgive it her, and as for my part, God forgive it her, and I do;\nand so much it liked your highness to grant me my boon, for God's love\nI require you hold your promise. Sithen it is so, said the king, I will\nthat ye have her life. Then, said the king, I give her to you, and go ye\nto the fire and take her, and do with her what ye will. So Sir Tristram\nwent to the fire, and by the commandment of the king delivered her from\nthe death. But after that King Meliodas would never have ado with her,\nas at bed and board. But by the good means of young Tristram he made the\nking and her accorded. But then the king would not suffer young Tristram\nto abide no longer in his court.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How Sir Tristram was sent into France, and had one to\ngovern him named Gouvernail, and how he learned to harp, hawk, and hunt.\n\nAND then he let ordain a gentleman that was well learned and taught,\nhis name was Gouvernail; and then he sent young Tristram with Gouvernail\ninto France to learn the language, and nurture, and deeds of arms. And\nthere was Tristram more than seven years. And then when he well could\nspeak the language, and had learned all that he might learn in that\ncountry, then he came home to his father, King Meliodas, again. And so\nTristram learned to be an harper passing all other, that there was none\nsuch called in no country, and so on harping and on instruments of music\nhe applied him in his youth for to learn.\n\nAnd after, as he grew in might and strength, he laboured ever in hunting\nand in hawking, so that never gentleman more, that ever we heard read\nof. And as the book saith, he began good measures of blowing of beasts\nof venery, and beasts of chase, and all manner of vermin, and all these\nterms we have yet of hawking and hunting. And therefore the book of\nvenery, of hawking, and hunting, is called the book of Sir Tristram.\nWherefore, as meseemeth, all gentlemen that bear old arms ought of right\nto honour Sir Tristram for the goodly terms that gentlemen have and\nuse, and shall to the day of doom, that thereby in a manner all men\nof worship may dissever a gentleman from a yeoman, and from a yeoman a\nvillain. For he that gentle is will draw him unto gentle tatches, and to\nfollow the customs of noble gentlemen.\n\nThus Sir Tristram endured in Cornwall until he was big and strong, of\nthe age of eighteen years. And then the King Meliodas had great joy\nof Sir Tristram, and so had the queen, his wife. For ever after in her\nlife, because Sir Tristram saved her from the fire, she did never hate\nhim more after, but loved him ever after, and gave Tristram many great\ngifts; for every estate loved him, where that he went.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How Sir Marhaus came out of Ireland for to ask truage of\nCornwall, or else he would fight therefore.\n\nTHEN it befell that King Anguish of Ireland sent unto King Mark of\nCornwall for his truage, that Cornwall had paid many winters. And all\nthat time King Mark was behind of the truage for seven years. And King\nMark and his barons gave unto the messenger of Ireland these words and\nanswer, that they would none pay; and bade the messenger go unto his\nKing Anguish, and tell him we will pay him no truage, but tell your\nlord, an he will always have truage of us of Cornwall, bid him send a\ntrusty knight of his land, that will fight for his right, and we shall\nfind another for to defend our right. With this answer the messengers\ndeparted into Ireland. And when King Anguish understood the answer of\nthe messengers he was wonderly wroth. And then he called unto him Sir\nMarhaus, the good knight, that was nobly proved, and a Knight of the\nTable Round. And this Marhaus was brother unto the queen of Ireland.\nThen the king said thus: Fair brother, Sir Marhaus, I pray you go into\nCornwall for my sake, and do battle for our truage that of right we\nought to have; and whatsomever ye spend ye shall have sufficiently, more\nthan ye shall need. Sir, said Marhaus, wit ye well that I shall not\nbe loath to do battle in the right of you and your land with the best\nknight of the Table Round; for I know them, for the most part, what be\ntheir deeds; and for to advance my deeds and to increase my worship I\nwill right gladly go unto this journey for our right.\n\nSo in all haste there was made purveyance for Sir Marhaus, and he had\nall things that to him needed; and so he departed out of Ireland, and\narrived up in Cornwall even fast by the Castle of Tintagil. And when\nKing Mark understood that he was there arrived to fight for Ireland,\nthen made King Mark great sorrow when he understood that the good and\nnoble knight Sir Marhaus was come. For they knew no knight that durst\nhave ado with him. For at that time Sir Marhaus was called one of the\nfamousest and renowned knights of the world. And thus Sir Marhaus abode\nin the sea, and every day he sent unto King Mark for to pay the truage\nthat was behind of seven year, other else to find a knight to fight with\nhim for the truage. This manner of message Sir Marhaus sent daily unto\nKing Mark.\n\nThen they of Cornwall let make cries in every place, that what knight\nwould fight for to save the truage of Cornwall, he should be rewarded\nso that he should fare the better, term of his life. Then some of the\nbarons said to King Mark, and counselled him to send to the court of\nKing Arthur for to seek Sir Launcelot du Lake, that was that time named\nfor the marvelloust knight of all the world. Then there were some other\nbarons that counselled the king not to do so, and said that it was\nlabour in vain, because Sir Marhaus was a knight of the Round Table,\ntherefore any of them will be loath to have ado with other, but if it\nwere any knight at his own request would fight disguised and unknown.\nSo the king and all his barons assented that it was no bote to seek any\nknight of the Round Table. This mean while came the language and the\nnoise unto King Meliodas, how that Sir Marhaus abode battle fast by\nTintagil, and how King Mark could find no manner knight to fight for\nhim. When young Tristram heard of this he was wroth, and sore ashamed\nthat there durst no knight in Cornwall have ado with Sir Marhaus of\nIreland.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How Tristram enterprized the battle to fight for the truage\nof Cornwall, and how he was made knight.\n\nTHEREWITHAL Tristram went unto his father, King Meliodas, and asked him\ncounsel what was best to do for to recover Cornwall from truage. For,\nas meseemeth, said Sir Tristram, it were shame that Sir Marhaus, the\nqueen's brother of Ireland, should go away unless that he were foughten\nwithal. As for that, said King Meliodas, wit you well, son Tristram,\nthat Sir Marhaus is called one of the best knights of the world, and\nKnight of the Table Round; and therefore I know no knight in this\ncountry that is able to match with him. Alas, said Sir Tristram, that I\nam not made knight; and if Sir Marhaus should thus depart into Ireland,\nGod let me never have worship: an I were made knight I should match him.\nAnd sir, said Tristram, I pray you give me leave to ride to King Mark;\nand, so ye be not displeased, of King Mark will I be made knight. I will\nwell, said King Meliodas, that ye be ruled as your courage will rule\nyou. Then Sir Tristram thanked his father much. And then he made him\nready to ride into Cornwall.\n\nIn the meanwhile there came a messenger with letters of love from King\nFaramon of France's daughter unto Sir Tristram, that were full piteous\nletters, and in them were written many complaints of love; but Sir\nTristram had no joy of her letters nor regard unto her. Also she sent\nhim a little brachet that was passing fair. But when the king's daughter\nunderstood that Sir Tristram would not love her, as the book saith, she\ndied for sorrow. And then the same squire that brought the letter and\nthe brachet came again unto Sir Tristram, as after ye shall hear in the\ntale.\n\nSo this young Sir Tristram rode unto his eme, King Mark of Cornwall. And\nwhen he came there he heard say that there would no knight fight with\nSir Marhaus. Then yede Sir Tristram unto his eme and said: Sir, if ye\nwill give me the order of knighthood, I will do battle with Sir Marhaus.\nWhat are ye, said the king, and from whence be ye come? Sir, said\nTristram, I come from King Meliodas that wedded your sister, and a\ngentleman wit ye well I am. King Mark beheld Sir Tristram and saw that\nhe was but a young man of age, but he was passingly well made and big.\nFair sir, said the king, what is your name, and where were ye born? Sir,\nsaid he again, my name is Tristram, and in the country of Liones was I\nborn. Ye say well, said the king; and if ye will do this battle I shall\nmake you knight. Therefore I come to you, said Sir Tristram, and for\nnone other cause. But then King Mark made him knight. And therewithal,\nanon as he had made him knight, he sent a messenger unto Sir Marhaus\nwith letters that said that he had found a young knight ready for to\ntake the battle to the uttermost. It may well be, said Sir Marhaus; but\ntell King Mark I will not fight with no knight but he be of blood royal,\nthat is to say, other king's son, other queen's son, born of a prince or\nprincess.\n\nWhen King Mark understood that, he sent for Sir Tristram de Liones and\ntold him what was the answer of Sir Marhaus. Then said Sir Tristram:\nSithen that he saith so, let him wit that I am come of father side and\nmother side of as noble blood as he is: for, sir, now shall ye know that\nI am King Meliodas' son, born of your own sister, Dame Elizabeth, that\ndied in the forest in the birth of me. O Jesu, said King Mark, ye are\nwelcome fair nephew to me. Then in all the haste the king let horse Sir\nTristram, and armed him in the best manner that might be had or gotten\nfor gold or silver. And then King Mark sent unto Sir Marhaus, and did\nhim to wit that a better born man than he was himself should fight with\nhim, and his name is Sir Tristram de Liones, gotten of King Meliodas,\nand born of King Mark's sister. Then was Sir Marhaus glad and blithe\nthat he should fight with such a gentleman. And so by the assent of King\nMark and of Sir Marhaus they let ordain that they should fight within\nan island nigh Sir Marhaus' ships; and so was Sir Tristram put into a\nvessel both his horse and he, and all that to him longed both for his\nbody and for his horse. Sir Tristram lacked nothing. And when King Mark\nand his barons of Cornwall beheld how young Sir Tristram departed with\nsuch a carriage to fight for the right of Cornwall, there was neither\nman nor woman of worship but they wept to see and understand so young a\nknight to jeopardy himself for their right.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How Sir Tristram arrived into the Island for to furnish the\nbattle with Sir Marhaus.\n\nSO to shorten this tale, when Sir Tristram was arrived within the island\nhe looked to the farther side, and there he saw at an anchor six ships\nnigh to the land; and under the shadow of the ships upon the land,\nthere hoved the noble knight, Sir Marhaus of Ireland. Then Sir Tristram\ncommanded his servant Gouvernail to bring his horse to the land, and\ndress his harness at all manner of rights. And then when he had so\ndone he mounted upon his horse; and when he was in his saddle well\napparelled, and his shield dressed upon his shoulder, Tristram asked\nGouvernail, Where is this knight that I shall have ado withal? Sir, said\nGouvernail, see ye him not? I weened ye had seen him; yonder he hoveth\nunder the umbre of his ships on horseback, with his spear in his hand\nand his shield upon his shoulder. That is truth, said the noble knight,\nSir Tristram, now I see him well enough.\n\nThen he commanded his servant Gouvernail to go to his vessel again: And\ncommend me unto mine eme King Mark, and pray him, if that I be slain in\nthis battle, for to inter my body as him seemed best; and as for me, let\nhim wit that I will never yield me for cowardice; and if I be slain and\nflee not, then they have lost no truage for me; and if so be that I\nflee or yield me as recreant, bid mine eme never bury me in Christian\nburials. And upon thy life, said Sir Tristram to Gouvernail, come thou\nnot nigh this island till that thou see me overcome or slain, or else\nthat I win yonder knight. So either departed from other sore weeping.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. How Sir Tristram fought against Sir Marhaus and achieved\nhis battle, and how Sir Marhaus fled to his ship.\n\nAND then Sir Marhaus avised Sir Tristram, and said thus: Young knight,\nSir Tristram, what dost thou here? me sore repenteth of thy courage,\nfor wit thou well I have been assayed, and the best knights of this\nland have been assayed of my hand; and also I have matched with the best\nknights of the world, and therefore by my counsel return again unto thy\nvessel. And fair knight, and well-proved knight, said Sir Tristram, thou\nshalt well wit I may not forsake thee in this quarrel, for I am for thy\nsake made knight. And thou shalt well wit that I am a king's son born,\nand gotten upon a queen; and such promise I have made at my uncle's\nrequest and mine own seeking, that I shall fight with thee unto the\nuttermost, and deliver Cornwall from the old truage. And also wit thou\nwell, Sir Marhaus, that this is the greatest cause that thou couragest\nme to have ado with thee, for thou art called one of the most renowned\nknights of the world, and because of that noise and fame that thou hast\nthou givest me courage to have ado with thee, for never yet was I proved\nwith good knight; and sithen I took the order of knighthood this day, I\nam well pleased that I may have ado with so good a knight as thou art.\nAnd now wit thou well, Sir Marhaus, that I cast me to get worship on\nthy body; and if that I be not proved, I trust to God that I shall\nbe worshipfully proved upon thy body, and to deliver the country of\nCornwall for ever from all manner of truage from Ireland for ever.\n\nWhen Sir Marhaus had heard him say what he would, he said then thus\nagain: Fair knight, sithen it is so that thou castest to win worship of\nme, I let thee wit worship may thou none lose by me if thou mayest stand\nme three strokes; for I let thee wit for my noble deeds, proved and\nseen, King Arthur made me Knight of the Table Round.\n\nThen they began to feutre their spears, and they met so fiercely\ntogether that they smote either other down, both horse and all. But Sir\nMarhaus smote Sir Tristram a great wound in the side with his spear, and\nthen they avoided their horses, and pulled out their swords, and threw\ntheir shields afore them. And then they lashed together as men that were\nwild and courageous. And when they had stricken so together long, then\nthey left their strokes, and foined at their breaths and visors; and\nwhen they saw that that might not prevail them, then they hurtled\ntogether like rams to bear either other down. Thus they fought still\nmore than half a day, and either were wounded passing sore, that the\nblood ran down freshly from them upon the ground. By then Sir Tristram\nwaxed more fresher than Sir Marhaus, and better winded and bigger; and\nwith a mighty stroke he smote Sir Marhaus upon the helm such a buffet\nthat it went through his helm, and through the coif of steel, and\nthrough the brain-pan, and the sword stuck so fast in the helm and in\nhis brain-pan that Sir Tristram pulled thrice at his sword or ever he\nmight pull it out from his head; and there Marhaus fell down on his\nknees, the edge of Tristram's sword left in his brain-pan. And suddenly\nSir Marhaus rose grovelling, and threw his sword and his shield from\nhim, and so ran to his ships and fled his way, and Sir Tristram had ever\nhis shield and his sword.\n\nAnd when Sir Tristram saw Sir Marhaus withdraw him, he said: Ah! Sir\nKnight of the Round Table, why withdrawest thou thee? thou dost thyself\nand thy kin great shame, for I am but a young knight, or now I was never\nproved, and rather than I should withdraw me from thee, I had rather be\nhewn in an hundred pieces. Sir Marhaus answered no word but yede his way\nsore groaning. Well, Sir Knight, said Sir Tristram, I promise thee thy\nsword and thy shield shall be mine; and thy shield shall I wear in all\nplaces where I ride on mine adventures, and in the sight of King Arthur\nand all the Round Table.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How Sir Marhaus after that he was arrived in Ireland died\nof the stroke that Sir Tristram had given him, and how Tristram was\nhurt.\n\nANON Sir Marhaus and his fellowship departed into Ireland. And as soon\nas he came to the king, his brother, he let search his wounds. And when\nhis head was searched a piece of Sir Tristram's sword was found therein,\nand might never be had out of his head for no surgeons, and so he died\nof Sir Tristram's sword; and that piece of the sword the queen, his\nsister, kept it for ever with her, for she thought to be revenged an she\nmight.\n\nNow turn we again unto Sir Tristram, that was sore wounded, and full\nsore bled that he might not within a little while, when he had taken\ncold, unnethe stir him of his limbs. And then he set him down softly\nupon a little hill, and bled fast. Then anon came Gouvernail, his\nman, with his vessel; and the king and his barons came with procession\nagainst him. And when he was come unto the land, King Mark took him in\nhis arms, and the king and Sir Dinas, the seneschal, led Sir Tristram\ninto the castle of Tintagil. And then was he searched in the best\nmanner, and laid in his bed. And when King Mark saw his wounds he wept\nheartily, and so did all his lords. So God me help, said King Mark,\nI would not for all my lands that my nephew died. So Sir Tristram lay\nthere a month and more, and ever he was like to die of that stroke that\nSir Marhaus smote him first with the spear. For, as the French book\nsaith, the spear's head was envenomed, that Sir Tristram might not be\nwhole. Then was King Mark and all his barons passing heavy, for they\ndeemed none other but that Sir Tristram should not recover. Then the\nking let send after all manner of leeches and surgeons, both unto men\nand women, and there was none that would behote him the life. Then came\nthere a lady that was a right wise lady, and she said plainly unto King\nMark, and to Sir Tristram, and to all his barons, that he should never\nbe whole but if Sir Tristram went in the same country that the venom\ncame from, and in that country should he be holpen or else never. Thus\nsaid the lady unto the king.\n\nWhen King Mark understood that, he let purvey for Sir Tristram a\nfair vessel, well victualled, and therein was put Sir Tristram, and\nGouvernail with him, and Sir Tristram took his harp with him, and so\nhe was put into the sea to sail into Ireland; and so by good fortune\nhe arrived up in Ireland, even fast by a castle where the king and the\nqueen was; and at his arrival he sat and harped in his bed a merry lay,\nsuch one heard they never none in Ireland before that time.\n\nAnd when it was told the king and the queen of such a knight that was\nsuch an harper, anon the king sent for him, and let search his wounds,\nand then asked him his name. Then he answered, I am of the country of\nLiones, and my name is Tramtrist, that thus was wounded in a battle as\nI fought for a lady's right. So God me help, said King Anguish, ye shall\nhave all the help in this land that ye may have here; but I let you wit,\nin Cornwall I had a great loss as ever had king, for there I lost the\nbest knight of the world; his name was Marhaus, a full noble knight, and\nKnight of the Table Round; and there he told Sir Tristram wherefore Sir\nMarhaus was slain. Sir Tristram made semblant as he had been sorry, and\nbetter knew he how it was than the king.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How Sir Tristram was put to the keeping of La Beale Isoud\nfirst for to be healed of his wound.\n\nTHEN the king for great favour made Tramtrist to be put in his\ndaughter's ward and keeping, because she was a noble surgeon. And when\nshe had searched him she found in the bottom of his wound that therein\nwas poison, and so she healed him within a while; and therefore\nTramtrist cast great love to La Beale Isoud, for she was at that time\nthe fairest maid and lady of the world. And there Tramtrist learned her\nto harp, and she began to have a great fantasy unto him. And at that\ntime Sir Palamides, the Saracen, was in that country, and well cherished\nwith the king and the queen. And every day Sir Palamides drew unto La\nBeale Isoud and proffered her many gifts, for he loved her passingly\nwell. All that espied Tramtrist, and full well knew he Sir Palamides\nfor a noble knight and a mighty man. And wit you well Sir Tramtrist had\ngreat despite at Sir Palamides, for La Beale Isoud told Tramtrist that\nPalamides was in will to be christened for her sake. Thus was there\ngreat envy betwixt Tramtrist and Sir Palamides.\n\nThen it befell that King Anguish let cry a great jousts and a great\ntournament for a lady that was called the Lady of the Launds, and she\nwas nigh cousin unto the king. And what man won her, three days after\nhe should wed her and have all her lands. This cry was made in England,\nWales, Scotland, and also in France and in Brittany. It befell upon\na day La Beale Isoud came unto Sir Tramtrist, and told him of this\ntournament. He answered and said: Fair lady, I am but a feeble knight,\nand but late I had been dead had not your good ladyship been. Now, fair\nlady, what would ye I should do in this matter? well ye wot, my lady,\nthat I may not joust. Ah, Tramtrist, said La Beale Isoud, why will\nye not have ado at that tournament? well I wot Sir Palamides shall be\nthere, and to do what he may; and therefore Tramtrist, I pray you for to\nbe there, for else Sir Palamides is like to win the degree. Madam, said\nTramtrist, as for that, it may be so, for he is a proved knight, and I\nam but a young knight and late made; and the first battle that I did it\nmishapped me to be sore wounded as ye see. But an I wist ye would be\nmy better lady, at that tournament I will be, so that ye will keep\nmy counsel and let no creature have knowledge that I shall joust but\nyourself, and such as ye will to keep your counsel, my poor person shall\nI jeopard there for your sake, that, peradventure, Sir Palamides shall\nknow when that I come. Thereto, said La Beale Isoud, do your best, and\nas I can, said La Beale Isoud, I shall purvey horse and armour for you\nat my device. As ye will so be it, said Sir Tramtrist, I will be at your\ncommandment.\n\nSo at the day of jousts there came Sir Palamides with a black shield,\nand he overthrew many knights, that all the people had marvel of him.\nFor he put to the worse Sir Gawaine, Gaheris, Agravaine, Bagdemagus,\nKay, Dodinas le Savage, Sagramore le Desirous, Gumret le Petit, and\nGriflet le Fise de Dieu. All these the first day Sir Palamides struck\ndown to the earth. And then all manner of knights were adread of Sir\nPalamides, and many called him the Knight with the Black Shield. So that\nday Sir Palamides had great worship.\n\nThen came King Anguish unto Tramtrist, and asked him why he would\nnot joust. Sir, he said, I was but late hurt, and as yet I dare not\nadventure me. Then came there the same squire that was sent from the\nking's daughter of France unto Sir Tristram. And when he had espied Sir\nTristram he fell flat to his feet. All that espied La Beale Isoud, what\ncourtesy the squire made unto Sir Tristram. And therewithal suddenly\nSir Tristram ran unto his squire, whose name was Hebes le Renoumes, and\nprayed him heartily in no wise to tell his name. Sir, said Hebes, I will\nnot discover your name but if ye command me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How Sir Tristram won the degree at a tournament in Ireland,\nand there made Palamides to bear no more harness in a year.\n\nTHEN Sir Tristram asked him what he did in those countries. Sir, he\nsaid, I came hither with Sir Gawaine for to be made knight, and if it\nplease you, of your hands that I may be made knight. Await upon me as\nto-morn secretly, and in the field I shall make you a knight.\n\nThen had La Beale Isoud great suspicion unto Tramtrist, that he was some\nman of worship proved, and therewith she comforted herself, and cast\nmore love unto him than she had done to-fore. And so on the morn Sir\nPalamides made him ready to come into the field as he did the first day.\nAnd there he smote down the King with the Hundred Knights, and the King\nof Scots. Then had La Beale Isoud ordained and well arrayed Sir Tristram\nin white horse and harness. And right so she let put him out at a privy\npostern, and so he came into the field as it had been a bright angel.\nAnd anon Sir Palamides espied him, and therewith he feutred a spear unto\nSir Tramtrist, and he again unto him. And there Sir Tristram smote\ndown Sir Palamides unto the earth. And then there was a great noise of\npeople: some said Sir Palamides had a fall, some said the Knight with\nthe Black Shield had a fall. And wit you well La Beale Isoud was passing\nglad. And then Sir Gawaine and his fellows nine had marvel what knight\nit might be that had smitten down Sir Palamides. Then would there none\njoust with Tramtrist, but all that there were forsook him, most and\nleast. Then Sir Tristram made Hebes a knight, and caused him to put\nhimself forth, and did right well that day. So after Sir Hebes held him\nwith Sir Tristram.\n\nAnd when Sir Palamides had received this fall, wit ye well that he was\nsore ashamed, and as privily as he might he withdrew him out of the\nfield. All that espied Sir Tristram, and lightly he rode after Sir\nPalamides and overtook him, and bade him turn, for better he would\nassay him or ever he departed. Then Sir Palamides turned him, and either\nlashed at other with their swords. But at the first stroke Sir Tristram\nsmote down Palamides, and gave him such a stroke upon the head that\nhe fell to the earth. So then Tristram bade yield him, and do his\ncommandment, or else he would slay him. When Sir Palamides beheld his\ncountenance, he dread his buffets so, that he granted all his askings.\nWell said, said Sir Tristram, this shall be your charge. First, upon\npain of your life that ye forsake my lady La Beale Isoud, and in no\nmanner wise that ye draw not to her. Also this twelvemonth and a day\nthat ye bear none armour nor none harness of war. Now promise me this,\nor here shalt thou die. Alas, said Palamides, for ever am I ashamed.\nThen he sware as Sir Tristram had commanded him. Then for despite and\nanger Sir Palamides cut off his harness, and threw them away.\n\nAnd so Sir Tristram turned again to the castle where was La Beale Isoud;\nand by the way he met with a damosel that asked after Sir Launcelot,\nthat won the Dolorous Guard worshipfully; and this damosel asked Sir\nTristram what he was. For it was told her that it was he that smote down\nSir Palamides, by whom the ten knights of King Arthur's were smitten\ndown. Then the damosel prayed Sir Tristram to tell her what he was, and\nwhether that he were Sir Launcelot du Lake, for she deemed that there\nwas no knight in the world might do such deeds of arms but if it were\nLauncelot. Fair damosel, said Sir Tristram, wit ye well that I am not\nSir Launcelot, for I was never of such prowess, but in God is all that\nhe may make me as good a knight as the good knight Sir Launcelot. Now,\ngentle knight, said she, put up thy visor; and when she beheld his\nvisage she thought she saw never a better man's visage, nor a better\nfaring knight. And then when the damosel knew certainly that he was not\nSir Launcelot, then she took her leave, and departed from him. And then\nSir Tristram rode privily unto the postern, where kept him La Beale\nIsoud, and there she made him good cheer, and thanked God of his good\nspeed. So anon, within a while the king and the queen understood that it\nwas Tramtrist that smote down Sir Palamides; then was he much made of,\nmore than he was before.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How the queen espied that Sir Tristram had slain her brother\nSir Marhaus by his sword, and in what jeopardy he was.\n\nTHUS was Sir Tramtrist long there well cherished with the king and the\nqueen, and namely with La Beale Isoud. So upon a day the queen and La\nBeale Isoud made a bain for Sir Tramtrist. And when he was in his bain\nthe queen and Isoud, her daughter, roamed up and down in the chamber;\nand therewhiles Gouvernail and Hebes attended upon Tramtrist, and the\nqueen beheld his sword thereas it lay upon his bed. And then by unhap\nthe queen drew out his sword and beheld it a long while, and both they\nthought it a passing fair sword; but within a foot and an half of the\npoint there was a great piece thereof out-broken of the edge. And when\nthe queen espied that gap in the sword, she remembered her of a piece of\na sword that was found in the brain-pan of Sir Marhaus, the good knight\nthat was her brother. Alas then, said she unto her daughter, La Beale\nIsoud, this is the same traitor knight that slew my brother, thine eme.\nWhen Isoud heard her say so she was passing sore abashed, for passing\nwell she loved Tramtrist, and full well she knew the cruelness of her\nmother the queen.\n\nAnon therewithal the queen went unto her own chamber, and sought her\ncoffer, and there she took out the piece or the sword that was pulled\nout of Sir Marhaus' head after that he was dead. And then she ran with\nthat piece of iron to the sword that lay upon the bed. And when she put\nthat piece of steel and iron unto the sword, it was as meet as it might\nbe when it was new broken. And then the queen gripped that sword in her\nhand fiercely, and with all her might she ran straight upon Tramtrist\nwhere he sat in his bain, and there she had rived him through had not\nSir Hebes gotten her in his arms, and pulled the sword from her, and\nelse she had thrust him through.\n\nThen when she was let of her evil will she ran to the King Anguish, her\nhusband, and said on her knees: O my lord, here have ye in your house\nthat traitor knight that slew my brother and your servant, that noble\nknight, Sir Marhaus. Who is that, said King Anguish, and where is he?\nSir, she said, it is Sir Tramtrist, the same knight that my daughter\nhealed. Alas, said the king, therefore am I right heavy, for he is a\nfull noble knight as ever I saw in field. But I charge you, said the\nking to the queen, that ye have not ado with that knight, but let me\ndeal with him.\n\nThen the king went into the chamber unto Sir Tramtrist, and then was he\ngone unto his chamber, and the king found him all ready armed to\nmount upon his horse. When the king saw him all ready armed to go unto\nhorseback, the king said: Nay, Tramtrist, it will not avail to compare\nthee against me; but thus much I shall do for my worship and for thy\nlove; in so much as thou art within my court it were no worship for me\nto slay thee: therefore upon this condition I will give thee leave for\nto depart from this court in safety, so thou wilt tell me who was thy\nfather, and what is thy name, and if thou slew Sir Marhaus, my brother.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How Sir Tristram departed from the king and La Beale Isoud\nout of Ireland for to come into Cornwall.\n\nSIR, said Tristram, now I shall tell you all the truth: my father's name\nis Sir Meliodas, King of Liones, and my mother hight Elizabeth, that\nwas sister unto King Mark of Cornwall; and my mother died of me in the\nforest, and because thereof she commanded, or she died, that when I were\nchristened they should christen me Tristram; and because I would not be\nknown in this country I turned my name and let me call Tramtrist; and\nfor the truage of Cornwall I fought for my eme's sake, and for the\nright of Cornwall that ye had posseded many years. And wit ye well, said\nTristram unto the king, I did the battle for the love of mine uncle,\nKing Mark, and for the love of the country of Cornwall, and for to\nincrease mine honour; for that same day that I fought with Sir Marhaus I\nwas made knight, and never or then did I battle with no knight, and from\nme he went alive, and left his shield and his sword behind.\n\nSo God me help, said the king, I may not say but ye did as a knight\nshould, and it was your part to do for your quarrel, and to increase\nyour worship as a knight should; howbeit I may not maintain you in this\ncountry with my worship, unless that I should displease my barons,\nand my wife and her kin. Sir, said Tristram, I thank you of your good\nlordship that I have had with you here, and the great goodness my lady,\nyour daughter, hath shewed me, and therefore, said Sir Tristram, it may\nso happen that ye shall win more by my life than by my death, for in the\nparts of England it may happen I may do you service at some season, that\nye shall be glad that ever ye shewed me your good lordship. With more I\npromise you as I am true knight, that in all places I shall be my lady\nyour daughter's servant and knight in right and in wrong, and I shall\nnever fail her, to do as much as a knight may do. Also I beseech your\ngood grace that I may take my leave at my lady, your daughter, and at\nall the barons and knights. I will well, said the king.\n\nThen Sir Tristram went unto La Beale Isoud and took his leave of her.\nAnd then he told her all, what he was, and how he had changed his name\nbecause he would not be known, and how a lady told him that he should\nnever be whole till he came into this country where the poison was made,\nwherethrough I was near my death had not your ladyship been. O gentle\nknight, said La Beale Isoud, full woe am I of thy departing, for I\nsaw never man that I owed so good will to. And therewithal she wept\nheartily. Madam, said Sir Tristram, ye shall understand that my name is\nSir Tristram de Liones, gotten of King Meliodas, and born of his queen.\nAnd I promise you faithfully that I shall be all the days of my\nlife your knight. Gramercy, said La Beale Isoud, and I promise you\nthere-against that I shall not be married this seven years but by your\nassent; and to whom that ye will I shall be married to him will I have,\nand he will have me if ye will consent.\n\nAnd then Sir Tristram gave her a ring, and she gave him another; and\ntherewith he departed from her, leaving her making great dole and\nlamentation; and he straight went unto the court among all the barons,\nand there he took his leave at most and least, and openly he said among\nthem all: Fair lords, now it is so that I must depart: if there be any\nman here that I have offended unto, or that any man be with me grieved,\nlet complain him here afore me or that ever I depart, and I shall amend\nit unto my power. And if there be any that will proffer me wrong, or say\nof me wrong or shame behind my back, say it now or never, and here is my\nbody to make it good, body against body. And all they stood still, there\nwas not one that would say one word; yet were there some knights that\nwere of the queen's blood, and of Sir Marhaus' blood, but they would not\nmeddle with him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. How Sir Tristram and King Mark hurted each other for the\nlove of a knight's wife.\n\nSO Sir Tristram departed, and took the sea, and with good wind he\narrived up at Tintagil in Cornwall; and when King Mark was whole in his\nprosperity there came tidings that Sir Tristram was arrived, and whole\nof his wounds: thereof was King Mark passing glad, and so were all the\nbarons; and when he saw his time he rode unto his father, King Meliodas,\nand there he had all the cheer that the king and the queen could make\nhim. And then largely King Meliodas and his queen departed of their\nlands and goods to Sir Tristram.\n\nThen by the license of King Meliodas, his father, he returned again unto\nthe court of King Mark, and there he lived in great joy long time, until\nat the last there befell a jealousy and an unkindness betwixt King Mark\nand Sir Tristram, for they loved both one lady. And she was an earl's\nwife that hight Sir Segwarides. And this lady loved Sir Tristram\npassingly well. And he loved her again, for she was a passing fair lady,\nand that espied Sir Tristram well. Then King Mark understood that and\nwas jealous, for King Mark loved her passingly well.\n\nSo it fell upon a day this lady sent a dwarf unto Sir Tristram, and\nbade him, as he loved her, that he would be with her the night next\nfollowing. Also she charged you that ye come not to her but if ye\nbe well armed, for her lover was called a good knight. Sir Tristram\nanswered to the dwarf: Recommend me unto my lady, and tell her I will\nnot fail but I will be with her the term that she hath set me. And with\nthis answer the dwarf departed. And King Mark espied that the dwarf was\nwith Sir Tristram upon message from Segwarides' wife; then King Mark\nsent for the dwarf, and when he was come he made the dwarf by force\nto tell him all, why and wherefore that he came on message from Sir\nTristram. Now, said King Mark, go where thou wilt, and upon pain of\ndeath that thou say no word that thou spakest with me; so the dwarf\ndeparted from the king.\n\nAnd that same night that the steven was set betwixt Segwarides' wife\nand Sir Tristram, King Mark armed him, and made him ready, and took two\nknights of his counsel with him; and so he rode afore for to abide by\nthe way for to wait upon Sir Tristram. And as Sir Tristram came riding\nupon his way with his spear in his hand, King Mark came hurtling upon\nhim with his two knights suddenly. And all three smote him with their\nspears, and King Mark hurt Sir Tristram on the breast right sore. And\nthen Sir Tristram feutred his spear, and smote his uncle, King Mark, so\nsore, that he rashed him to the earth, and bruised him that he lay still\nin a swoon, and long it was or ever he might wield himself. And then he\nran to the one knight, and eft to the other, and smote them to the cold\nearth, that they lay still. And therewithal Sir Tristram rode forth sore\nwounded to the lady, and found her abiding him at a postern.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How Sir Tristram lay with the lady, and how her husband\nfought with Sir Tristram.\n\nAND there she welcomed him fair, and either halsed other in arms, and so\nshe let put up his horse in the best wise, and then she unarmed him. And\nso they supped lightly, and went to bed with great joy and pleasaunce;\nand so in his raging he took no keep of his green wound that King Mark\nhad given him. And so Sir Tristram be-bled both the over sheet and the\nnether, and pillows, and head sheet. And within a while there came one\nafore, that warned her that her lord was near-hand within a bow-draught.\nSo she made Sir Tristram to arise, and so he armed him, and took his\nhorse, and so departed. By then was come Segwarides, her lord, and when\nhe found her bed troubled and broken, and went near and beheld it by\ncandle light, then he saw that there had lain a wounded knight.\nAh, false traitress, then he said, why hast thou betrayed me? And\ntherewithal he swang out a sword, and said: But if thou tell me who hath\nbeen here, here thou shalt die. Ah, my lord, mercy, said the lady, and\nheld up her hands, saying: Slay me not, and I shall tell you all who\nhath been here. Tell anon, said Segwarides, to me all the truth. Anon\nfor dread she said: Here was Sir Tristram with me, and by the way as\nhe came to me ward, he was sore wounded. Ah, false traitress, said\nSegwarides, where is he become? Sir, she said, he is armed, and departed\non horseback, not yet hence half a mile. Ye say well, said Segwarides.\n\nThen he armed him lightly, and gat his horse, and rode after Sir\nTristram that rode straightway unto Tintagil. And within a while he\novertook Sir Tristram, and then he bade him, Turn, false traitor knight.\nAnd Sir Tristram anon turned him against him. And therewithal Segwarides\nsmote Sir Tristram with a spear that it all to-brast; and then he swang\nout his sword and smote fast at Sir Tristram. Sir knight, said Sir\nTristram, I counsel you that ye smite no more, howbeit for the wrongs\nthat I have done you I will forbear you as long as I may. Nay, said\nSegwarides, that shall not be, for either thou shalt die or I.\n\nThen Sir Tristram drew out his sword, and hurtled his horse unto him\nfiercely, and through the waist of the body he smote Sir Segwarides that\nhe fell to the earth in a swoon. And so Sir Tristram departed and left\nhim there. And so he rode unto Tintagil and took his lodging secretly,\nfor he would not be known that he was hurt. Also Sir Segwarides'\nmen rode after their master, whom they found lying in the field sore\nwounded, and brought him home on his shield, and there he lay long or\nthat he were whole, but at the last he recovered. Also King Mark would\nnot be aknown of that Sir Tristram and he had met that night. And as for\nSir Tristram, he knew not that King Mark had met with him. And so the\nking askance came to Sir Tristram, to comfort him as he lay sick in his\nbed. But as long as King Mark lived he loved never Sir Tristram after\nthat; though there was fair speech, love was there none. And thus it\npassed many weeks and days, and all was forgiven and forgotten; for Sir\nSegwarides durst not have ado with Sir Tristram, because of his noble\nprowess, and also because he was nephew unto King Mark; therefore he\nlet it overslip: for he that hath a privy hurt is loath to have a shame\noutward.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. How Sir Bleoberis demanded the fairest lady in King Mark's\ncourt, whom he took away, and how he was fought with.\n\nTHEN it befell upon a day that the good knight Bleoberis de Ganis,\nbrother to Blamore de Ganis, and nigh cousin unto the good knight Sir\nLauncelot du Lake, this Bleoberis came unto the court of King Mark, and\nthere he asked of King Mark a boon, to give him what gift that he would\nask in his court. When the king heard him ask so, he marvelled of his\nasking, but because he was a knight of the Round Table, and of a\ngreat renown, King Mark granted him his whole asking. Then, said Sir\nBleoberis, I will have the fairest lady in your court that me list to\nchoose. I may not say nay, said King Mark; now choose at your adventure.\nAnd so Sir Bleoberis did choose Sir Segwarides' wife, and took her by\nthe hand, and so went his way with her; and so he took his horse and\ngart set her behind his squire, and rode upon his way.\n\nWhen Sir Segwarides heard tell that his lady was gone with a knight of\nKing Arthur's court, then he armed him and rode after that knight for\nto rescue his lady. So when Bleoberis was gone with this lady, King Mark\nand all the court was wroth that she was away. Then were there certain\nladies that knew that there were great love between Sir Tristram and\nher, and also that lady loved Sir Tristram above all other knights. Then\nthere was one lady that rebuked Sir Tristram in the horriblest wise, and\ncalled him coward knight, that he would for shame of his knighthood see\na lady so shamefully be taken away from his uncle's court. But she meant\nthat either of them had loved other with entire heart. But Sir Tristram\nanswered her thus: Fair lady, it is not my part to have ado in such\nmatters while her lord and husband is present here; and if it had been\nthat her lord had not been here in this court, then for the worship of\nthis court peradventure I would have been her champion, and if so be\nSir Segwarides speed not well, it may happen that I will speak with that\ngood knight or ever he pass from this country.\n\nThen within a while came one of Sir Segwarides' squires, and told in the\ncourt that Sir Segwarides was beaten sore and wounded to the point of\ndeath; as he would have rescued his lady Sir Bleoberis overthrew him\nand sore hath wounded him. Then was King Mark heavy thereof, and all the\ncourt. When Sir Tristram heard of this he was ashamed and sore grieved;\nand then was he soon armed and on horseback, and Gouvernail, his\nservant, bare his shield and spear. And so as Sir Tristram rode fast he\nmet with Sir Andred his cousin, that by the commandment of King Mark\nwas sent to bring forth, an ever it lay in his power, two knights of\nArthur's court, that rode by the country to seek their adventures. When\nSir Tristram saw Sir Andred he asked him what tidings. So God me\nhelp, said Sir Andred, there was never worse with me, for here by\nthe commandment of King Mark I was sent to fetch two knights of King\nArthur's court, and that one beat me and wounded me, and set nought by\nmy message. Fair cousin, said Sir Tristram, ride on your way, and if I\nmay meet them it may happen I shall revenge you. So Sir Andred rode into\nCornwall, and Sir Tristram rode after the two knights, the which one\nhight Sagramore le Desirous, and the other hight Dodinas le Savage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. How Sir Tristram fought with two knights of the Round\nTable.\n\nTHEN within a while Sir Tristram saw them afore him, two likely knights.\nSir, said Gouvernail unto his master, Sir, I would counsel you not to\nhave ado with them, for they be two proved knights of Arthur's court. As\nfor that, said Sir Tristram, have ye no doubt but I will have ado with\nthem to increase my worship, for it is many day sithen I did any deeds\nof arms. Do as ye list, said Gouvernail. And therewithal anon Sir\nTristram asked them from whence they came, and whither they would, and\nwhat they did in those marches. Sir Sagramore looked upon Sir Tristram,\nand had scorn of his words, and asked him again, Fair knight, be ye\na knight of Cornwall? Whereby ask ye it? said Sir Tristram. For it is\nseldom seen, said Sir Sagramore, that ye Cornish knights be valiant men\nof arms; for within these two hours there met us one of your Cornish\nknights, and great words he spake, and anon with little might he was\nlaid to the earth. And, as I trow, said Sir Sagramore, ye shall have\nthe same handsel that he had. Fair lords, said Sir Tristram, it may so\nhappen that I may better withstand than he did, and whether ye will or\nnill I will have ado with you, because he was my cousin that ye beat.\nAnd therefore here do your best, and wit ye well but if ye quit you\nthe better here upon this ground, one knight of Cornwall shall beat you\nboth.\n\nWhen Sir Dodinas le Savage heard him say so he gat a spear in his hand,\nand said, Sir knight, keep well thyself: And then they departed and came\ntogether as it had been thunder. And Sir Dodinas' spear brast in-sunder,\nbut Sir Tristram smote him with a more might, that he smote him clean\nover the horse-croup, that nigh he had broken his neck. When Sir\nSagramore saw his fellow have such a fall he marvelled what knight he\nmight be. And he dressed his spear with all his might, and Sir Tristram\nagainst him, and they came together as the thunder, and there Sir\nTristram smote Sir Sagramore a strong buffet, that he bare his horse and\nhim to the earth, and in the falling he brake his thigh.\n\nWhen this was done Sir Tristram asked them: Fair knights, will ye any\nmore? Be there no bigger knights in the court of King Arthur? it is to\nyou shame to say of us knights of Cornwall dishonour, for it may happen\na Cornish knight may match you. That is truth, said Sir Sagramore, that\nhave we well proved; but I require thee, said Sir Sagramore, tell us\nyour right name, by the faith and troth that ye owe to the high order\nof knighthood. Ye charge me with a great thing, said Sir Tristram, and\nsithen ye list to wit it, ye shall know and understand that my name is\nSir Tristram de Liones, King Meliodas' son, and nephew unto King Mark.\nThen were they two knights fain that they had met with Tristram, and so\nthey prayed him to abide in their fellowship. Nay, said Sir Tristram,\nfor I must have ado with one of your fellows, his name is Sir Bleoberis\nde Ganis. God speed you well, said Sir Sagramore and Dodinas. Sir\nTristram departed and rode onward on his way. And then was he ware\nbefore him in a valley where rode Sir Bleoberis, with Sir Segwarides'\nlady, that rode behind his squire upon a palfrey.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Bleoberis for a lady, and\nhow the lady was put to choice to whom she would go.\n\nTHEN Sir Tristram rode more than a pace until that he had overtaken him.\nThen spake Sir Tristram: Abide, he said, Knight of Arthur's court,\nbring again that lady, or deliver her to me. I will do neither, said\nBleoberis, for I dread no Cornish knight so sore that me list to deliver\nher. Why, said Sir Tristram, may not a Cornish knight do as well as\nanother knight? this same day two knights of your court within this\nthree mile met with me, and or ever we departed they found a Cornish\nknight good enough for them both. What were their names? said Bleoberis.\nThey told me, said Sir Tristram, that the one of them hight Sir\nSagramore le Desirous, and the other hight Dodinas le Savage. Ah, said\nSir Bleoberis, have ye met with them? so God me help, they were two good\nknights and men of great worship, and if ye have beat them both ye must\nneeds be a good knight; but if it so be ye have beat them both, yet\nshall ye not fear me, but ye shall beat me or ever ye have this lady.\nThen defend you, said Sir Tristram. So they departed and came together\nlike thunder, and either bare other down, horse and all, to the earth.\n\nThen they avoided their horses, and lashed together eagerly with swords,\nand mightily, now tracing and traversing on the right hand and on the\nleft hand more than two hours. And sometime they rushed together with\nsuch a might that they lay both grovelling on the ground. Then Sir\nBleoberis de Ganis stert aback, and said thus: Now, gentle good knight,\na while hold your hands, and let us speak together. Say what ye will,\nsaid Tristram, and I will answer you. Sir, said Bleoberis, I would wit\nof whence ye be, and of whom ye be come, and what is your name? So God\nme help, said Sir Tristram, I fear not to tell you my name. Wit ye well\nI am King Meliodas' son, and my mother is King Mark's sister, and my\nname is Sir Tristram de Liones, and King Mark is mine uncle. Truly, said\nBleoberis, I am right glad of you, for ye are he that slew Marhaus the\nknight, hand for hand in an island, for the truage of Cornwall; also ye\novercame Sir Palamides the good knight, at a tournament in an island,\nwhere ye beat Sir Gawaine and his nine fellows. So God me help, said Sir\nTristram, wit ye well that I am the same knight; now I have told you\nmy name, tell me yours with good will. Wit ye well that my name is Sir\nBleoberis de Ganis, and my brother hight Sir Blamore de Ganis, that\nis called a good knight, and we be sister's children unto my lord Sir\nLauncelot du Lake, that we call one of the best knights of the world.\nThat is truth, said Sir Tristram, Sir Launcelot is called peerless of\ncourtesy and of knighthood; and for his sake, said Sir Tristram, I will\nnot with my good will fight no more with you, for the great love I have\nto Sir Launcelot du Lake. In good faith, said Bleoberis, as for me I\nwill be loath to fight with you; but sithen ye follow me here to have\nthis lady, I shall proffer you kindness, courtesy, and gentleness right\nhere upon this ground. This lady shall be betwixt us both, and to whom\nthat she will go, let him have her in peace. I will well, said Tristram,\nfor, as I deem, she will leave you and come to me. Ye shall prove it\nanon, said Bleoberis.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII. How the lady forsook Sir Tristram and abode with Sir\nBleoberis, and how she desired to go to her husband.\n\nSo when she was set betwixt them both she said these words unto Sir\nTristram: Wit ye well, Sir Tristram de Liones, that but late thou wast\nthe man in the world that I most loved and trusted, and I weened thou\nhadst loved me again above all ladies; but when thou sawest this knight\nlead me away thou madest no cheer to rescue me, but suffered my lord\nSegwarides ride after me; but until that time I weened thou haddest\nloved me, and therefore now I will leave thee, and never love thee more.\nAnd therewithal she went unto Sir Bleoberis.\n\nWhen Sir Tristram saw her do so he was wonderly wroth with that lady,\nand ashamed to come to the court. Sir Tristram, said Sir Bleoberis, ye\nare in the default, for I hear by this lady's words she before this\nday trusted you above all earthly knights, and, as she saith, ye have\ndeceived her, therefore wit ye well, there may no man hold that will\naway; and rather than ye should be heartily displeased with me I would\nye had her, an she would abide with you. Nay, said the lady, so God me\nhelp I will never go with him; for he that I loved most I weened he had\nloved me. And therefore, Sir Tristram, she said, ride as thou came, for\nthough thou haddest overcome this knight, as ye was likely, with thee\nnever would I have gone. And I shall pray this knight so fair of his\nknighthood, that or ever he pass this country, that he will lead me\nto the abbey where my lord Sir Segwarides lieth. So God me help, said\nBleoberis, I let you wit, good knight Sir Tristram, because King Mark\ngave me the choice of a gift in this court, and so this lady liked\nme best--notwithstanding, she is wedded and hath a lord, and I have\nfulfilled my quest, she shall be sent unto her husband again, and in\nespecial most for your sake, Sir Tristram; and if she would go with you\nI would ye had her. I thank you, said Sir Tristram, but for her love I\nshall beware what manner a lady I shall love or trust; for had her lord,\nSir Segwarides, been away from the court, I should have been the first\nthat should have followed you; but sithen that ye have refused me, as\nI am true knight I shall her know passingly well that I shall love or\ntrust. And so they took their leave one from the other and departed.\n\nAnd so Sir Tristram rode unto Tintagil, and Sir Bleoberis rode unto the\nabbey where Sir Segwarides lay sore wounded, and there he delivered his\nlady, and departed as a noble knight; and when Sir Segwarides saw his\nlady, he was greatly comforted; and then she told him that Sir Tristram\nhad done great battle with Sir Bleoberis, and caused him to bring her\nagain. These words pleased Sir Segwarides right well, that Sir Tristram\nwould do so much; and so that lady told all the battle unto King Mark\nbetwixt Sir Tristram and Sir Bleoberis.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. How King Mark sent Sir Tristram for La Beale Isoud toward\nIreland, and how by fortune he arrived into England.\n\nTHEN when this was done King Mark cast always in his heart how he\nmight destroy Sir Tristram. And then he imagined in himself to send\nSir Tristram into Ireland for La Beale Isoud. For Sir Tristram had so\npraised her beauty and her goodness that King Mark said that he would\nwed her, whereupon he prayed Sir Tristram to take his way into Ireland\nfor him on message. And all this was done to the intent to slay Sir\nTristram. Notwithstanding, Sir Tristram would not refuse the message for\nno danger nor peril that might fall, for the pleasure of his uncle,\nbut to go he made him ready in the most goodliest wise that might be\ndevised. For Sir Tristram took with him the most goodliest knights that\nhe might find in the court; and they were arrayed, after the guise that\nwas then used, in the goodliest manner. So Sir Tristram departed and\ntook the sea with all his fellowship. And anon, as he was in the broad\nsea a tempest took him and his fellowship, and drove them back into the\ncoast of England; and there they arrived fast by Camelot, and full fain\nthey were to take the land.\n\nAnd when they were landed Sir Tristram set up his pavilion upon the land\nof Camelot, and there he let hang his shield upon the pavilion. And that\nsame day came two knights of King Arthur's, that one was Sir Ector de\nMaris, and Sir Morganor. And they touched the shield, and bade him\ncome out of the pavilion for to joust, an he would joust. Ye shall be\nanswered, said Sir Tristram, an ye will tarry a little while. So he\nmade him ready, and first he smote down Sir Ector de Maris, and after he\nsmote down Sir Morganor, all with one spear, and sore bruised them. And\nwhen they lay upon the earth they asked Sir Tristram what he was, and of\nwhat country he was knight. Fair lords, said Sir Tristram, wit ye well\nthat I am of Cornwall. Alas, said Sir Ector, now am I ashamed that ever\nany Cornish knight should overcome me. And then for despite Sir Ector\nput off his armour from him, and went on foot, and would not ride.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. How King Anguish of Ireland was summoned to come to King\nArthur's court for treason.\n\nTHEN it fell that Sir Bleoberis and Sir Blamore de Ganis, that were\nbrethren, they had summoned the King Anguish of Ireland for to come to\nArthur's court upon pain of forfeiture of King Arthur's good grace. And\nif the King of Ireland came not in, at the day assigned and set, the\nking should lose his lands. So it happened that at the day assigned,\nKing Arthur neither Sir Launcelot might not be there for to give the\njudgment, for King Arthur was with Sir Launcelot at the Castle Joyous\nGarde. And so King Arthur assigned King Carados and the King of Scots\nto be there that day as judges. So when the kings were at Camelot King\nAnguish of Ireland was come to know his accusers. Then was there Sir\nBlamore de Ganis, and appealed the King of Ireland of treason, that he\nhad slain a cousin of his in his court in Ireland by treason. The king\nwas sore abashed of his accusation, for-why he was come at the summons\nof King Arthur, and or he came at Camelot he wist not wherefore he\nwas sent after. And when the king heard Sir Blamore say his will,\nhe understood well there was none other remedy but for to answer him\nknightly; for the custom was such in those days, that an any man were\nappealed of any treason or murder he should fight body for body, or else\nto find another knight for him. And all manner of murders in those days\nwere called treason.\n\n\nSo when King Anguish understood his accusing he was passing heavy, for\nhe knew Sir Blamore de Ganis that he was a noble knight, and of noble\nknights come. Then the King of Ireland was simply purveyed of his\nanswer; therefore the judges gave him respite by the third day to give\nhis answer. So the king departed unto his lodging. The meanwhile there\ncame a lady by Sir Tristram's pavilion making great dole. What aileth\nyou, said Sir Tristram, that ye make such dole? Ah, fair knight, said\nthe lady, I am ashamed unless that some good knight help me; for a great\nlady of worship sent by me a fair child and a rich, unto Sir Launcelot\ndu Lake, and hereby there met with me a knight, and threw me down from\nmy palfrey, and took away the child from me. Well, my lady, said Sir\nTristram, and for my lord Sir Launcelot's sake I shall get you that\nchild again, or else I shall be beaten for it. And so Sir Tristram took\nhis horse, and asked the lady which way the knight rode; and then she\ntold him. And he rode after him, and within a while he overtook that\nknight. And then Sir Tristram bade him turn and give again the child.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. How Sir Tristram rescued a child from a knight, and how\nGouvernail told him of King Anguish.\n\nTHE knight turned his horse and made him ready to fight. And then Sir\nTristram smote him with a sword such a buffet that he tumbled to the\nearth. And then he yielded him unto Sir Tristram. Then come thy way,\nsaid Sir Tristram, and bring the child to the lady again. So he took\nhis horse meekly and rode with Sir Tristram; and then by the way Sir\nTristram asked him his name. Then he said, My name is Breuse Saunce\nPite. So when he had delivered that child to the lady, he said: Sir, as\nin this the child is well remedied. Then Sir Tristram let him go again\nthat sore repented him after, for he was a great foe unto many good\nknights of King Arthur's court.\n\nThen when Sir Tristram was in his pavilion Gouvernail, his man, came and\ntold him how that King Anguish of Ireland was come thither, and he was\nput in great distress; and there Gouvernail told Sir Tristram how King\nAnguish was summoned and appealed of murder. So God me help, said Sir\nTristram, these be the best tidings that ever came to me this seven\nyears, for now shall the King of Ireland have need of my help; for I\ndaresay there is no knight in this country that is not of Arthur's court\ndare do battle with Sir Blamore de Ganis; and for to win the love of the\nKing of Ireland I will take the battle upon me; and therefore Gouvernail\nbring me, I charge thee, to the king.\n\nThen Gouvernail went unto King Anguish of Ireland, and saluted him fair.\nThe king welcomed him and asked him what he would. Sir, said Gouvernail,\nhere is a knight near hand that desireth to speak with you: he bade me\nsay he would do you service. What knight is he? said the king. Sir,\nsaid he, it is Sir Tristram de Liones, that for your good grace that\nye showed him in your lands will reward you in this country. Come on,\nfellow, said the king, with me anon and show me unto Sir Tristram. So\nthe king took a little hackney and but few fellowship with him, until he\ncame unto Sir Tristram's pavilion. And when Sir Tristram saw the king he\nran unto him and would have holden his stirrup. But the king leapt from\nhis horse lightly, and either halsed other in their arms. My gracious\nlord, said Sir Tristram, gramercy of your great goodnesses showed unto\nme in your marches and lands: and at that time I promised you to do you\nservice an ever it lay in my power. And, gentle knight, said the king\nunto Sir Tristram, now have I great need of you, never had I so great\nneed of no knight's help. How so, my good lord? said Sir Tristram.\nI shall tell you, said the king: I am summoned and appealed from my\ncountry for the death of a knight that was kin unto the good knight\nSir Launcelot; wherefore Sir Blamore de Ganis, brother to Sir Bleoberis\nhath appealed me to fight with him, outher to find a knight in my stead.\nAnd well I wot, said the king, these that are come of King Ban's blood,\nas Sir Launcelot and these other, are passing good knights, and hard\nmen for to win in battle as any that I know now living. Sir, said Sir\nTristram, for the good lordship ye showed me in Ireland, and for my lady\nyour daughter's sake, La Beale Isoud, I will take the battle for you\nupon this condition that ye shall grant me two things: that one is\nthat ye shall swear to me that ye are in the right, that ye were never\nconsenting to the knight's death; Sir, then said Sir Tristram, when\nthat I have done this battle, if God give me grace that I speed, that ye\nshall give me a reward, what thing reasonable that I will ask of you. So\nGod me help, said the king, ye shall have whatsomever ye will ask. It is\nwell said, said Sir Tristram.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. How Sir Tristram fought for Sir Anguish and overcame his\nadversary, and how his adversary would never yield him.\n\nNOW make your answer that your champion is ready, for I shall die in\nyour quarrel rather than to be recreant. I have no doubt of you, said\nthe king, that, an ye should have ado with Sir Launcelot du Lake-- Sir,\nsaid Sir Tristram, as for Sir Launcelot, he is called the noblest knight\nof the world, and wit ye well that the knights of his blood are noble\nmen, and dread shame; and as for Bleoberis, brother unto Sir Blamore, I\nhave done battle with him, therefore upon my head it is no shame to\ncall him a good knight. It is noised, said the king, that Blamore is the\nhardier knight. Sir, as for that let him be, he shall never be refused,\nan as he were the best knight that now beareth shield or spear.\n\n\nSo King Anguish departed unto King Carados and the kings that were that\ntime as judges, and told them that he had found his champion ready. Then\nby the commandment of the kings Sir Blamore de Ganis and Sir Tristram\nwere sent for to hear the charge. And when they were come before the\njudges there were many kings and knights beheld Sir Tristram, and\nmuch speech they had of him because that he slew Sir Marhaus, the good\nknight, and because he for-jousted Sir Palamides the good knight. So\nwhen they had taken their charge they withdrew them to make them ready\nto do battle.\n\nThen said Sir Bleoberis unto his brother, Sir Blamore: Fair dear\nbrother, remember of what kin we be come of, and what a man is Sir\nLauncelot du Lake, neither farther nor nearer but brother's children,\nand there was never none of our kin that ever was shamed in battle; and\nrather suffer death, brother, than to be shamed. Brother, said Blamore,\nhave ye no doubt of me, for I shall never shame none of my blood;\nhowbeit I am sure that yonder knight is called a passing good knight as\nof his time one of the world, yet shall I never yield me, nor say the\nloath word: well may he happen to smite me down with his great might of\nchivalry, but rather shall he slay me than I shall yield me as recreant.\nGod speed you well, said Sir Bleoberis, for ye shall find him the\nmightiest knight that ever ye had ado withal, for I know him, for I have\nhad ado with him. God me speed, said Sir Blamore de Ganis; and therewith\nhe took his horse at the one end of the lists, and Sir Tristram at\nthe other end of the lists, and so they feutred their spears and came\ntogether as it had been thunder; and there Sir Tristram through great\nmight smote down Sir Blamore and his horse to the earth. Then anon Sir\nBlamore avoided his horse and pulled out his sword and threw his shield\nafore him, and bade Sir Tristram alight: For though an horse hath failed\nme, I trust to God the earth will not fail me. And then Sir Tristram\nalighted, and dressed him unto battle; and there they lashed together\nstrongly as racing and tracing, foining and dashing, many sad strokes,\nthat the kings and knights had great wonder that they might stand; for\never they fought like wood men, so that there was never knights seen\nfight more fiercely than they did; for Sir Blamore was so hasty that he\nwould have no rest, that all men wondered that they had breath to stand\non their feet; and all the place was bloody that they fought in. And\nat the last, Sir Tristram smote Sir Blamore such a buffet upon the helm\nthat he there fell down upon his side, and Sir Tristram stood and beheld\nhim.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. How Sir Blamore desired Tristram to slay him, and how Sir\nTristram spared him, and how they took appointment.\n\nTHEN when Sir Blamore might speak, he said thus: Sir Tristram de Liones,\nI require thee, as thou art a noble knight, and the best knight that\never I found, that thou wilt slay me out, for I would not live to be\nmade lord of all the earth, for I have liefer die with worship than live\nwith shame; and needs, Sir Tristram, thou must slay me, or else thou\nshalt never win the field, for I will never say the loath word. And\ntherefore if thou dare slay me, slay me, I require thee. When Sir\nTristram heard him say so knightly, he wist not what to do with him; he\nremembering him of both parties, of what blood he was come, and for Sir\nLauncelot's sake he would be loath to slay him; and in the other party\nin no wise he might not choose, but that he must make him to say the\nloath word, or else to slay him.\n\nThen Sir Tristram stert aback, and went to the kings that were judges,\nand there he kneeled down to-fore them, and besought them for their\nworships, and for King Arthur's and Sir Launcelot's sake, that they\nwould take this matter in their hands. For, my fair lords, said Sir\nTristram, it were shame and pity that this noble knight that yonder\nlieth should be slain; for ye hear well, shamed will he not be, and I\npray to God that he never be slain nor shamed for me. And as for\nthe king for whom I fight for, I shall require him, as I am his true\nchampion and true knight in this field, that he will have mercy upon\nthis good knight. So God me help, said King Anguish, I will for your\nsake; Sir Tristram, be ruled as ye will have me, for I know you for my\ntrue knight; and therefore I will heartily pray the kings that be here\nas judges to take it in their hands. And the kings that were judges\ncalled Sir Bleoberis to them, and asked him his advice. My lords, said\nBleoberis, though my brother be beaten, and hath the worse through might\nof arms, I dare say, though Sir Tristram hath beaten his body he hath\nnot beaten his heart, and I thank God he is not shamed this day; and\nrather than he should be shamed I require you, said Bleoberis, let Sir\nTristram slay him out. It shall not be so, said the kings, for his part\nadversary, both the king and the champion, have pity of Sir Blamore's\nknighthood. My lords, said Bleoberis, I will right well as ye will.\n\nThen the kings called the King of Ireland, and found him goodly\nand treatable. And then, by all their advices, Sir Tristram and Sir\nBleoberis took up Sir Blamore, and the two brethren were accorded with\nKing Anguish, and kissed and made friends for ever. And then Sir Blamore\nand Sir Tristram kissed together, and there they made their oaths that\nthey would never none of them two brethren fight with Sir Tristram,\nand Sir Tristram made the same oath. And for that gentle battle all the\nblood of Sir Launcelot loved Sir Tristram for ever.\n\nThen King Anguish and Sir Tristram took their leave, and sailed into\nIreland with great noblesse and joy. So when they were in Ireland the\nking let make it known throughout all the land how and in what manner\nSir Tristram had done for him. Then the queen and all that there were\nmade the most of him that they might. But the joy that La Beale Isoud\nmade of Sir Tristram there might no tongue tell, for of all men earthly\nshe loved him most.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Tristram demanded La Beale Isoud for King Mark,\nand how Sir Tristram and Isoud drank the love drink.\n\nTHEN upon a day King Anguish asked Sir Tristram why he asked not his\nboon, for whatsomever he had promised him he should have it without\nfail. Sir, said Sir Tristram, now is it time; this is all that I will\ndesire, that ye will give me La Beale Isoud, your daughter, not for\nmyself, but for mine uncle, King Mark, that shall have her to wife, for\nso have I promised him. Alas, said the king, I had liefer than all the\nland that I have ye would wed her yourself. Sir, an I did then I were\nshamed for ever in this world, and false of my promise. Therefore, said\nSir I Tristram, I pray you hold your promise that ye promised me; for\nthis is my desire, that ye will give me La Beale Isoud to go with me\ninto Cornwall for to be wedded to King Mark, mine uncle. As for that,\nsaid King Anguish, ye shall have her with you to do with her what it\nplease you; that is for to say if that ye list to wed her yourself, that\nis me liefest, and if ye will give her unto King Mark, your uncle, that\nis in your choice. So, to make short conclusion, La Beale Isoud was made\nready to go with Sir Tristram, and Dame Bragwaine went with her for her\nchief gentlewoman, with many other.\n\nThen the queen, Isoud's mother, gave to her and Dame Bragwaine, her\ndaughter's gentlewoman, and unto Gouvernail, a drink, and charged them\nthat what day King Mark should wed, that same day they should give him\nthat drink, so that King Mark should drink to La Beale Isoud, and then,\nsaid the queen, I undertake either shall love other the days of their\nlife. So this drink was given unto Dame Bragwaine, and unto Gouvernail.\nAnd then anon Sir Tristram took the sea, and La Beale Isoud; and when\nthey were in their cabin, it happed so that they were thirsty, and they\nsaw a little flasket of gold stand by them, and it seemed by the colour\nand the taste that it was noble wine. Then Sir Tristram took the flasket\nin his hand, and said, Madam Isoud, here is the best drink that ever\nye drank, that Dame Bragwaine, your maiden, and Gouvernail, my servant,\nhave kept for themselves. Then they laughed and made good cheer, and\neither drank to other freely, and they thought never drink that ever\nthey drank to other was so sweet nor so good. But by that their drink\nwas in their bodies, they loved either other so well that never their\nlove departed for weal neither for woe. And thus it happed the love\nfirst betwixt Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud, the which love never\ndeparted the days of their life.\n\nSo then they sailed till by fortune they came nigh a castle that hight\nPluere, and thereby arrived for to repose them, weening to them to have\nhad good harbourage. But anon as Sir Tristram was within the castle they\nwere taken prisoners; for the custom of the castle was such; who that\nrode by that castle and brought any lady, he must needs fight with the\nlord, that hight Breunor. And if it were so that Breunor won the field,\nthen should the knight stranger and his lady be put to death, what that\never they were; and if it were so that the strange knight won the field\nof Sir Breunor, then should he die and his lady both. This custom was\nused many winters, for it was called the Castle Pluere, that is to say\nthe Weeping Castle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. How Sir Tristram and Isoud were in prison, and how he\nfought for her beauty, and smote of another lady's head.\n\nTHUS as Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud were in prison, it happed a\nknight and a lady came unto them where they were, to cheer them. I have\nmarvel, said Tristram unto the knight and the lady, what is the cause\nthe lord of this castle holdeth us in prison: it was never the custom of\nno place of worship that ever I came in, when a knight and a lady asked\nharbour, and they to receive them, and after to destroy them that be\nhis guests. Sir, said the knight, this is the old custom of this castle,\nthat when a knight cometh here he must needs fight with our lord, and\nhe that is weaker must lose his head. And when that is done, if his lady\nthat he bringeth be fouler than our lord's wife, she must lose her head:\nand if she be fairer proved than is our lady, then shall the lady of\nthis castle lose her head. So God me help, said Sir Tristram, this is a\nfoul custom and a shameful. But one advantage have I, said Sir Tristram,\nI have a lady is fair enough, fairer saw I never in all my life-days,\nand I doubt not for lack of beauty she shall not lose her head; and\nrather than I should lose my head I will fight for it on a fair field.\nWherefore, sir knight, I pray you tell your lord that I will be ready as\nto-morn with my lady, and myself to do battle, if it be so I may have\nmy horse and mine armour. Sir, said that knight, I undertake that your\ndesire shall be sped right well. And then he said: Take your rest, and\nlook that ye be up betimes and make you ready and your lady, for ye\nshall want no thing that you behoveth. And therewith he departed, and on\nthe morn betimes that same knight came to Sir Tristram, and fetched him\nout and his lady, and brought him horse and armour that was his own, and\nbade him make him ready to the field, for all the estates and commons of\nthat lordship were there ready to behold that battle and judgment.\n\nThen came Sir Breunor, the lord of that castle, with his lady in his\nhand, muffled, and asked Sir Tristram where was his lady: For an thy\nlady be fairer than mine, with thy sword smite off my lady's head; and\nif my lady be fairer than thine, with my sword I must strike off her\nhead. And if I may win thee, yet shall thy lady be mine, and thou shalt\nlose thy head. Sir, said Tristram, this is a foul custom and horrible;\nand rather than my lady should lose her head, yet had I liefer lose\nmy head. Nay, nay, said Sir Breunor, the ladies shall be first showed\ntogether, and the one shall have her judgment. Nay, I will not so, said\nSir Tristram, for here is none that will give righteous judgment. But\nI doubt not, said Sir Tristram, my lady is fairer than thine, and that\nwill I prove and make good with my hand. And whosomever he be that will\nsay the contrary I will prove it on his head. And therewith Sir Tristram\nshowed La Beale Isoud, and turned her thrice about with his naked sword\nin his hand. And when Sir Breunor saw that, he did the same wise turn\nhis lady. But when Sir Breunor beheld La Beale Isoud, him thought he saw\nnever a fairer lady, and then he dread his lady's head should be off.\nAnd so all the people that were there present gave judgment that La\nBeale Isoud was the fairer lady and the better made. How now, said Sir\nTristram, meseemeth it were pity that my lady should lose her head, but\nbecause thou and she of long time have used this wicked custom, and\nby you both have many good knights and ladies been destroyed, for that\ncause it were no loss to destroy you both. So God me help, said Sir\nBreunor, for to say the sooth, thy lady is fairer than mine, and that me\nsore repenteth. And so I hear the people privily say, for of all women I\nsaw none so fair; and therefore, an thou wilt slay my lady, I doubt not\nbut I shall slay thee and have thy lady. Thou shalt win her, said Sir\nTristram, as dear as ever knight won lady. And because of thine own\njudgment, as thou wouldst have done to my lady if that she had been\nfouler, and because of the evil custom, give me thy lady, said Sir\nTristram. And therewithal Sir Tristram strode unto him and took his\nlady from him, and with an awk stroke he smote off her head clean. Well,\nknight, said Sir Breunor, now hast thou done me a despite; [*8]now take\nthine horse: sithen I am ladyless I will win thy lady an I may.\n\n\n[*8] Printed by Caxton as part of chap. xxvi.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Breunor, and at the last\nsmote off his head.\n\nTHEN they took their horses and came together as it had been the\nthunder; and Sir Tristram smote Sir Breunor clean from his horse, and\nlightly he rose up; and as Sir Tristram came again by him he thrust\nhis horse throughout both the shoulders, that his horse hurled here and\nthere and fell dead to the ground. And ever Sir Breunor ran after to\nhave slain Sir Tristram, but Sir Tristram was light and nimble, and\nvoided his horse lightly. And or ever Sir Tristram might dress his\nshield and his sword the other gave him three or four sad strokes. Then\nthey rushed together like two boars, tracing and traversing mightily and\nwisely as two noble knights. For this Sir Breunor was a proved knight,\nand had been or then the death of many good knights, that it was pity\nthat he had so long endured.\n\nThus they fought, hurling here and there nigh two hours, and either were\nwounded sore. Then at the last Sir Breunor rashed upon Sir Tristram and\ntook him in his arms, for he trusted much in his strength. Then was Sir\nTristram called the strongest and the highest knight of the world; for\nhe was called bigger than Sir Launcelot, but Sir Launcelot was better\nbreathed. So anon Sir Tristram thrust Sir Breunor down grovelling, and\nthen he unlaced his helm and struck off his head. And then all they that\nlonged to the castle came to him, and did him homage and fealty, praying\nhim that he would abide there still a little while to fordo that foul\ncustom. Sir Tristram granted thereto. The meanwhile one of the knights\nof the castle rode unto Sir Galahad, the haut prince, the which was Sir\nBreunor's son, which was a noble knight, and told him what misadventure\nhis father had and his mother.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. How Sir Galahad fought with Sir Tristram, and how Sir\nTristram yielded him and promised to fellowship with Launcelot.\n\nTHEN came Sir Galahad, and the King with the Hundred Knights with him;\nand this Sir Galahad proffered to fight with Sir Tristram hand for hand.\nAnd so they made them ready to go unto battle on horseback with great\ncourage. Then Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram met together so hard that\neither bare other down, horse and all, to the earth. And then they\navoided their horses as noble knights, and dressed their shields, and\ndrew their swords with ire and rancour, and they lashed together many\nsad strokes, and one while striking, another while foining, tracing and\ntraversing as noble knights; thus they fought long, near half a day, and\neither were sore wounded. At the last Sir Tristram waxed light and big,\nand doubled his strokes, and drove Sir Galahad aback on the one side and\non the other, so that he was like to have been slain.\n\nWith that came the King with the Hundred Knights, and all that\nfellowship went fiercely upon Sir Tristram. When Sir Tristram saw them\ncoming upon him, then he wist well he might not endure. Then as a wise\nknight of war, he said to Sir Galahad, the haut prince: Sir, ye show to\nme no knighthood, for to suffer all your men to have ado with me all at\nonce; and as meseemeth ye be a noble knight of your hands it is great\nshame to you. So God me help, said Sir Galahad, there is none other way\nbut thou must yield thee to me, other else to die, said Sir Galahad to\nSir Tristram. I will rather yield me to you than die for that is more\nfor the might of your men than of your hands. And therewithal Sir\nTristram took his own sword by the point, and put the pommel in the hand\nof Sir Galahad.\n\nTherewithal came the King with the Hundred Knights, and hard began to\nassail Sir Tristram. Let be, said Sir Galahad, be ye not so hardy to\ntouch him, for I have given this knight his life. That is your shame,\nsaid the King with the Hundred Knights; hath he not slain your father\nand your mother? As for that, said Sir Galahad, I may not wite him\ngreatly, for my father had him in prison, and enforced him to do battle\nwith him; and my father had such a custom that was a shameful custom,\nthat what knight came there to ask harbour his lady must needs die but\nif she were fairer than my mother; and if my father overcame that knight\nhe must needs die. This was a shameful custom and usage, a knight for\nhis harbour-asking to have such harbourage. And for this custom I would\nnever draw about him. So God me help, said the King, this was a shameful\ncustom. Truly, said Sir Galahad, so seemed me; and meseemed it had been\ngreat pity that this knight should have been slain, for I dare say he is\nthe noblest man that beareth life, but if it were Sir Launcelot du Lake.\nNow, fair knight, said Sir Galahad, I require thee tell me thy name, and\nof whence thou art, and whither thou wilt. Sir, he said, my name is Sir\nTristram de Liones, and from King Mark of Cornwall I was sent on message\nunto King Anguish of Ireland, for to fetch his daughter to be his wife,\nand here she is ready to go with me into Cornwall, and her name is La\nBeale Isoud. And, Sir Tristram, said Sir Galahad, the haut prince, well\nbe ye found in these marches, and so ye will promise me to go unto Sir\nLauncelot du Lake, and accompany with him, ye shall go where ye will,\nand your fair lady with you; and I shall promise you never in all my\ndays shall such customs be used in this castle as have been used. Sir,\nsaid Sir Tristram, now I let you wit, so God me help, I weened ye had\nbeen Sir Launcelot du Lake when I saw you first, and therefore I dread\nyou the more; and sir, I promise you, said Sir Tristram, as soon as I\nmay I will see Sir Launcelot and in fellowship me with him; for of all\nthe knights of the world I most desire his fellowship.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. How Sir Launcelot met with Sir Carados bearing away Sir\nGawaine, and of the rescue of Sir Gawaine.\n\nAND then Sir Tristram took his leave when he saw his time, and took\nthe sea. And in the meanwhile word came unto Sir Launcelot and to Sir\nTristram that Sir Carados, the mighty king, that was made like a giant,\nfought with Sir Gawaine, and gave him such strokes that he swooned in\nhis saddle, and after that he took him by the collar and pulled him out\nof his saddle, and fast bound him to the saddle-bow, and so rode his way\nwith him toward his castle. And as he rode, by fortune Sir Launcelot met\nwith Sir Carados, and anon he knew Sir Gawaine that lay bound after him.\nAh, said Sir Launcelot unto Sir Gawaine, how stands it with you? Never\nso hard, said Sir Gawaine, unless that ye help me, for so God me help,\nwithout ye rescue me I know no knight that may, but outher you or Sir\nTristram. Wherefore Sir Launcelot was heavy of Sir Gawaine's words. And\nthen Sir Launcelot bade Sir Carados: Lay down that knight and fight with\nme. Thou art but a fool, said Sir Carados, for I will serve you in the\nsame wise. As for that, said Sir Launcelot, spare me not, for I warn\nthee I will not spare thee. And then he bound Sir Gawaine hand and foot,\nand so threw him to the ground. And then he gat his spear of his squire,\nand departed from Sir Launcelot to fetch his course. And so either met\nwith other, and brake their spears to their hands; and then they pulled\nout swords, and hurtled together on horseback more than an hour. And\nat the last Sir Launcelot smote Sir Carados such a buffet upon the helm\nthat it pierced his brain-pan. So then Sir Launcelot took Sir Carados by\nthe collar and pulled him under his horse's feet, and then he alighted\nand pulled off his helm and struck off his head. And then Sir Launcelot\nunbound Sir Gawaine. So this same tale was told to Sir Galahad and\nto Sir Tristram:--here may ye hear the nobleness that followeth Sir\nLauncelot. Alas, said Sir Tristram, an I had not this message in hand\nwith this fair lady, truly I would never stint or I had found Sir\nLauncelot. Then Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud went to the sea and came\ninto Cornwall, and there all the barons met them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. Of the wedding of King Mark to La Beale Isoud, and of\nBragwaine her maid, and of Palamides.\n\nAND anon they were richly wedded with great noblesse. But ever, as the\nFrench book saith, Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud loved ever together.\nThen was there great jousts and great tourneying, and many lords and\nladies were at that feast, and Sir Tristram was most praised of all\nother. Thus dured the feast long, and after the feast was done, within\na little while after, by the assent of two ladies that were with Queen\nIsoud, they ordained for hate and envy for to destroy Dame Bragwaine,\nthat was maiden and lady unto La Beale Isoud; and she was sent into the\nforest for to fetch herbs, and there she was met, and bound feet and\nhand to a tree, and so she was bounden three days. And by fortune, Sir\nPalamides found Dame Bragwaine, and there he delivered her from the\ndeath, and brought her to a nunnery there beside, for to be recovered.\nWhen Isoud the queen missed her maiden, wit ye well she was right heavy\nas ever was any queen, for of all earthly women she loved her best: the\ncause was for she came with her out of her country. And so upon a day\nQueen Isoud walked into the forest to put away her thoughts, and there\nshe went herself unto a well and made great moan. And suddenly there\ncame Palamides to her, and had heard all her complaint, and said: Madam\nIsoud, an ye will grant me my boon, I shall bring to you Dame Bragwaine\nsafe and sound. And the queen was so glad of his proffer that suddenly\nunadvised she granted all his asking. Well, Madam, said Palamides, I\ntrust to your promise, and if ye will abide here half an hour I shall\nbring her to you. I shall abide you, said La Beale Isoud. And Sir\nPalamides rode forth his way to that nunnery, and lightly he came again\nwith Dame Bragwaine; but by her good will she would not have come\nagain, because for love of the queen she stood in adventure of her life.\nNotwithstanding, half against her will, she went with Sir Palamides unto\nthe queen. And when the queen saw her she was passing glad. Now, Madam,\nsaid Palamides, remember upon your promise, for I have fulfilled my\npromise. Sir Palamides, said the queen, I wot not what is your desire,\nbut I will that ye wit, howbeit I promised you largely, I thought none\nevil, nor I warn you none evil will I do. Madam, said Sir Palamides,\nas at this time, ye shall not know my desire, but before my lord your\nhusband there shall ye know that I will have my desire that ye have\npromised me. And therewith the queen departed, and rode home to the\nking, and Sir Palamides rode after her. And when Sir Palamides came\nbefore the king, he said: Sir King, I require you as ye be a righteous\nking, that ye will judge me the right. Tell me your cause, said the\nking, and ye shall have right.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX. How Palamides demanded Queen Isoud, and how Lambegus rode\nafter to rescue her, and of the escape of Isoud.\n\nSIR, said Palamides, I promised your Queen Isoud to bring again Dame\nBragwaine that she had lost, upon this covenant, that she should grant\nme a boon that I would ask, and without grudging, outher advisement, she\ngranted me. What say ye, my lady? said the king. It is as he saith, so\nGod me help, said the queen; to say thee sooth I promised him his asking\nfor love and joy that I had to see her. Well, Madam, said the king, and\nif ye were hasty to grant him what boon he would ask, I will well that\nye perform your promise. Then, said Palamides, I will that ye wit that\nI will have your queen to lead her and govern her whereas me list.\nTherewith the king stood still, and bethought him of Sir Tristram, and\ndeemed that he would rescue her. And then hastily the king answered:\nTake her with the adventures that shall fall of it, for as I suppose\nthou wilt not enjoy her no while. As for that, said Palamides, I\ndare right well abide the adventure. And so, to make short tale, Sir\nPalamides took her by the hand and said: Madam, grudge not to go with\nme, for I desire nothing but your own promise. As for that, said the\nqueen, I fear not greatly to go with thee, howbeit thou hast me at\nadvantage upon my promise, for I doubt not I shall be worshipfully\nrescued from thee. As for that, said Sir Palamides, be it as it be may.\nSo Queen Isoud was set behind Palamides, and rode his way.\n\nAnon the king sent after Sir Tristram, but in no wise he could be found,\nfor he was in the forest a-hunting; for that was always his custom, but\nif he used arms, to chase and to hunt in the forests. Alas, said the\nking, now I am shamed for ever, that by mine own assent my lady and\nmy queen shall be devoured. Then came forth a knight, his name was\nLambegus, and he was a knight of Sir Tristram. My lord, said this\nknight, sith ye have trust in my lord, Sir Tristram, wit ye well for\nhis sake I will ride after your queen and rescue her, or else I shall\nbe beaten. Gramercy, said the king, as I live, Sir Lambegus, I shall\ndeserve it. And then Sir Lambegus armed him, and rode after as fast as\nhe might. And then within a while he overtook Sir Palamides. And then\nSir Palamides left the queen. What art thou, said Palamides, art thou\nTristram? Nay, he said, I am his servant, and my name is Sir Lambegus.\nThat me repenteth, said Palamides. I had liefer thou hadst been Sir\nTristram. I believe you well, said Lambegus, but when thou meetest\nwith Sir Tristram thou shalt have thy hands full. And then they hurtled\ntogether and all to-brast their spears, and then they pulled out their\nswords, and hewed on helms and hauberks. At the last Sir Palamides gave\nSir Lambegus such a wound that he fell down like a dead knight to the\nearth.\n\nThen he looked after La Beale Isoud, and then she was gone he nist\nwhere. Wit ye well Sir Palamides was never so heavy. So the queen ran\ninto the forest, and there she found a well, and therein she had thought\nto have drowned herself. And as good fortune would, there came a knight\nto her that had a castle thereby, his name was Sir Adtherp. And when he\nfound the queen in that mischief he rescued her, and brought her to his\ncastle. And when he wist what she was he armed him, and took his horse,\nand said he would be avenged upon Palamides; and so he rode on till he\nmet with him, and there Sir Palamides wounded him sore, and by force he\nmade him to tell him the cause why he did battle with him, and how he\nhad led the queen unto his castle. Now bring me there, said Palamides,\nor thou shalt die of my hands. Sir, said Sir Adtherp, I am so wounded\nI may not follow, but ride you this way and it shall bring you into my\ncastle, and there within is the queen. Then Sir Palamides rode still\ntill he came to the castle. And at a window La Beale Isoud saw Sir\nPalamides; then she made the gates to be shut strongly. And when he\nsaw he might not come within the castle, he put off his bridle and his\nsaddle, and put his horse to pasture, and set himself down at the gate\nlike a man that was out of his wit that recked not of himself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI. How Sir Tristram rode after Palamides, and how he found\nhim and fought with him, and by the means of Isoud the battle ceased.\n\nNOW turn we unto Sir Tristram, that when he was come home and wist La\nBeale Isoud was gone with Sir Palamides, wit ye well he was wroth out of\nmeasure. Alas, said Sir Tristram, I am this day shamed. Then he cried to\nGouvernail his man: Haste thee that I were armed and on horseback,\nfor well I wot Lambegus hath no might nor strength to withstand Sir\nPalamides: alas that I have not been in his stead! So anon as he was\narmed and horsed Sir Tristram and Gouvernail rode after into the forest,\nand within a while he found his knight Lambegus almost wounded to the\ndeath; and Sir Tristram bare him to a forester, and charged him to keep\nhim well. And then he rode forth, and there he found Sir Adtherp sore\nwounded, and he told him how the queen would have drowned herself had\nhe not been, and how for her sake and love he had taken upon him to do\nbattle with Sir Palamides. Where is my lady? said Sir Tristram. Sir,\nsaid the knight, she is sure enough within my castle, an she can hold\nher within it. Gramercy, said Sir Tristram, of thy great goodness. And\nso he rode till he came nigh to that castle; and then Sir Tristram saw\nwhere Sir Palamides sat at the gate sleeping, and his horse pastured\nfast afore him. Now go thou, Gouvernail, said Sir Tristram, and bid him\nawake, and make him ready. So Gouvernail rode unto him and said: Sir\nPalamides, arise, and take to thee thine harness. But he was in such a\nstudy he heard not what Gouvernail said. So Gouvernail came again and\ntold Sir Tristram he slept, or else he was mad. Go thou again, said Sir\nTristram, and bid him arise, and tell him that I am here, his mortal\nfoe. So Gouvernail rode again and put upon him the butt of his spear,\nand said: Sir Palamides, make thee ready, for wit ye well Sir Tristram\nhoveth yonder, and sendeth thee word he is thy mortal foe. And\ntherewithal Sir Palamides arose stilly, without words, and gat his\nhorse, and saddled him and bridled him, and lightly he leapt upon, and\ngat his spear in his hand, and either feutred their spears and hurtled\nfast together; and there Tristram smote down Sir Palamides over his\nhorse's tail. Then lightly Sir Palamides put his shield afore him and\ndrew his sword. And there began strong battle on both parts, for both\nthey fought for the love of one lady, and ever she lay on the walls and\nbeheld them how they fought out of measure, and either were wounded\npassing sore, but Palamides was much sorer wounded. Thus they fought\ntracing and traversing more than two hours, that well-nigh for dole and\nsorrow La Beale Isoud swooned. Alas, she said, that one I loved and yet\ndo, and the other I love not, yet it were great pity that I should see\nSir Palamides slain; for well I know by that time the end be done Sir\nPalamides is but a dead knight: because he is not christened I would be\nloath that he should die a Saracen. And therewithal she came down and\nbesought Sir Tristram to fight no more. Ah, madam, said he, what mean\nyou, will ye have me shamed? Well ye know I will be ruled by you. I will\nnot your dishonour, said La Beale Isoud, but I would that ye would for\nmy sake spare this unhappy Saracen Palamides. Madam, said Sir Tristram,\nI will leave fighting at this time for your sake. Then she said to Sir\nPalamides: This shall be your charge, that thou shalt go out of this\ncountry while I am therein. I will obey your commandment, said Sir\nPalamides, the which is sore against my will. Then take thy way, said La\nBeale Isoud, unto the court of King Arthur, and there recommend me unto\nQueen Guenever, and tell her that I send her word that there be within\nthis land but four lovers, that is, Sir Launcelot du Lake and Queen\nGuenever, and Sir Tristram de Liones and Queen Isoud.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII. How Sir Tristram brought Queen Isoud home, and of the\ndebate of King Mark and Sir Tristram.\n\nAND so Sir Palamides departed with great heaviness. And Sir Tristram\ntook the queen and brought her again to King Mark, and then was there\nmade great joy of her home-coming. Who was cherished but Sir Tristram!\nThen Sir Tristram let fetch Sir Lambegus, his knight, from the\nforester's house, and it was long or he was whole, but at the last he\nwas well recovered. Thus they lived with joy and play a long while. But\never Sir Andred, that was nigh cousin to Sir Tristram, lay in a watch\nto wait betwixt Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud, for to take them and\nslander them. So upon a day Sir Tristram talked with La Beale Isoud in\na window, and that espied Sir Andred, and told it to the King. Then King\nMark took a sword in his hand and came to Sir Tristram, and called him\nfalse traitor, and would have stricken him. But Sir Tristram was nigh\nhim, and ran under his sword, and took it out of his hand. And then\nthe King cried: Where are my knights and my men? I charge you slay this\ntraitor. But at that time there was not one would move for his words.\nWhen Sir Tristram saw that there was not one would be against him, he\nshook the sword to the king, and made countenance as though he would\nhave stricken him. And then King Mark fled, and Sir Tristram followed\nhim, and smote upon him five or six strokes flatling on the neck, that\nhe made him to fall upon the nose. And then Sir Tristram yede his way\nand armed him, and took his horse and his man, and so he rode into that\nforest.\n\nAnd there upon a day Sir Tristram met with two brethren that were\nknights with King Mark, and there he struck off the head of the one, and\nwounded the other to the death; and he made him to bear his brother's\nhead in his helm unto the king, and thirty more there he wounded. And\nwhen that knight came before the king to say his message, he there died\nafore the king and the queen. Then King Mark called his council unto\nhim, and asked advice of his barons what was best to do with Sir\nTristram. Sir, said the barons, in especial Sir Dinas, the Seneschal,\nSir, we will give you counsel for to send for Sir Tristram, for we\nwill that ye wit many men will hold with Sir Tristram an he were hard\nbestead. And sir, said Sir Dinas, ye shall understand that Sir Tristram\nis called peerless and makeless of any Christian knight, and of his\nmight and hardiness we knew none so good a knight, but if it be Sir\nLauncelot du Lake. And if he depart from your court and go to King\nArthur's court, wit ye well he will get him such friends there that he\nwill not set by your malice. And therefore, sir, I counsel you to take\nhim to your grace. I will well, said the king, that he be sent for, that\nwe may be friends. Then the barons sent for Sir Tristram under a safe\nconduct. And so when Sir Tristram came to the king he was welcome, and\nno rehearsal was made, and there was game and play. And then the king\nand the queen went a-hunting, and Sir Tristram.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII. How Sir Lamorak jousted with thirty knights, and Sir\nTristram at the request of King Mark smote his horse down.\n\nTHE king and the queen made their pavilions and their tents in that\nforest beside a river, and there was daily hunting and jousting, for\nthere were ever thirty knights ready to joust unto all them that came\nin at that time. And there by fortune came Sir Lamorak de Galis and Sir\nDriant; and there Sir Driant jousted right well, but at the last he had\na fall. Then Sir Lamorak proffered to joust. And when he began he fared\nso with the thirty knights that there was not one of them but that he\ngave him a fall, and some of them were sore hurt. I marvel, said King\nMark, what knight he is that doth such deeds of arms. Sir, said Sir\nTristram, I know him well for a noble knight as few now be living, and\nhis name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. It were great shame, said the king,\nthat he should go thus away, unless that some of you meet with him\nbetter. Sir, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth it were no worship for a noble\nman to have ado with him: and for because at this time he hath done over\nmuch for any mean knight living, therefore, as meseemeth, it were great\nshame and villainy to tempt him any more at this time, insomuch as he\nand his horse are weary both; for the deeds of arms that he hath done\nthis day, an they be well considered, it were enough for Sir Launcelot\ndu Lake. As for that, said King Mark, I require you, as ye love me and\nmy lady the queen, La Beale Isoud, take your arms and joust with Sir\nLamorak de Galis. Sir, said Sir Tristram, ye bid me do a thing that is\nagainst knighthood, and well I can deem that I shall give him a fall,\nfor it is no mastery, for my horse and I be fresh both, and so is\nnot his horse and he; and wit ye well that he will take it for great\nunkindness, for ever one good knight is loath to take another at\ndisadvantage; but because I will not displease you, as ye require me so\nwill I do, and obey your commandment.\n\nAnd so Sir Tristram armed him and took his horse, and put him forth, and\nthere Sir Lamorak met him mightily, and what with the might of his own\nspear, and of Sir Tristram's spear, Sir Lamorak's horse fell to the\nearth, and he sitting in the saddle. Then anon as lightly as he might he\navoided the saddle and his horse, and put his shield afore him and drew\nhis sword. And then he bade Sir Tristram: Alight, thou knight, an thou\ndurst. Nay, said Sir Tristram, I will no more have ado with thee, for I\nhave done to thee over much unto my dishonour and to thy worship. As for\nthat, said Sir Lamorak, I can thee no thank; since thou hast for-jousted\nme on horseback I require thee and I beseech thee, an thou be Sir\nTristram, fight with me on foot. I will not so, said Sir Tristram; and\nwit ye well my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and well I know ye be Sir\nLamorak de Galis, and this that I have done to you was against my will,\nbut I was required thereto; but to say that I will do at your request as\nat this time, I will have no more ado with you, for me shameth of that\nI have done. As for the shame, said Sir Lamorak, on thy part or on mine,\nbear thou it an thou wilt, for though a mare's son hath failed me, now a\nqueen's son shall not fail thee; and therefore, an thou be such a\nknight as men call thee, I require thee, alight, and fight with me. Sir\nLamorak, said Sir Tristram, I understand your heart is great, and cause\nwhy ye have, to say thee sooth; for it would grieve me an any knight\nshould keep him fresh and then to strike down a weary knight, for that\nknight nor horse was never formed that alway might stand or endure.\nAnd therefore, said Sir Tristram, I will not have ado with you, for me\nforthinketh of that I have done. As for that, said Sir Lamorak, I shall\nquit you, an ever I see my time.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV. How Sir Lamorak sent an horn to King Mark in despite of\nSir Tristram, and how Sir Tristram was driven into a chapel.\n\nSo he departed from him with Sir Driant, and by the way they met with\na knight that was sent from Morgan le Fay unto King Arthur; and this\nknight had a fair horn harnessed with gold, and the horn had such a\nvirtue that there might no lady nor gentlewoman drink of that horn but\nif she were true to her husband, and if she were false she should\nspill all the drink, and if she were true to her lord she might drink\npeaceable. And because of the Queen Guenever, and in the despite of Sir\nLauncelot, this horn was sent unto King Arthur; and by force Sir Lamorak\nmade that knight to tell all the cause why he bare that horn. Now shalt\nthou bear this horn, said Lamorak, unto King Mark, or else choose thou\nto die for it; for I tell thee plainly, in despite and reproof of Sir\nTristram thou shalt bear that horn unto King Mark, his uncle, and say\nthou to him that I sent it him for to assay his lady, and if she be true\nto him he shall prove her. So the knight went his way unto King Mark,\nand brought him that rich horn, and said that Sir Lamorak sent it him,\nand thereto he told him the virtue of that horn. Then the king made\nQueen Isoud to drink thereof, and an hundred ladies, and there were but\nfour ladies of all those that drank clean. Alas, said King Mark, this is\na great despite, and sware a great oath that she should be burnt and the\nother ladies.\n\nThen the barons gathered them together, and said plainly they would not\nhave those ladies burnt for an horn made by sorcery, that came from as\nfalse a sorceress and witch as then was living. For that horn did never\ngood, but caused strife and debate, and always in her days she had been\nan enemy to all true lovers. So there were many knights made their avow,\nan ever they met with Morgan le Fay, that they would show her short\ncourtesy. Also Sir Tristram was passing wroth that Sir Lamorak sent that\nhorn unto King Mark, for well he knew that it was done in the despite of\nhim. And therefore he thought to quite Sir Lamorak.\n\nThen Sir Tristram used daily and nightly to go to Queen Isoud when he\nmight, and ever Sir Andred his cousin watched him night and day for to\ntake him with La Beale Isoud. And so upon a night Sir Andred espied the\nhour and the time when Sir Tristram went to his lady. Then Sir Andred\ngat unto him twelve knights, and at midnight he set upon Sir Tristram\nsecretly and suddenly and there Sir Tristram was taken naked abed with\nLa Beale Isoud, and then was he bound hand and foot, and so was he kept\nuntil day. And then by the assent of King Mark, and of Sir Andred, and\nof some of the barons, Sir Tristram was led unto a chapel that stood\nupon the sea rocks, there for to take his judgment: and so he was led\nbounden with forty knights. And when Sir Tristram saw that there was\nnone other boot but needs that he must die, then said he: Fair lords,\nremember what I have done for the country of Cornwall, and in what\njeopardy I have been in for the weal of you all; for when I fought for\nthe truage of Cornwall with Sir Marhaus, the good knight, I was promised\nfor to be better rewarded, when ye all refused to take the battle;\ntherefore, as ye be good gentle knights, see me not thus shamefully to\ndie, for it is shame to all knighthood thus to see me die; for I dare\nsay, said Sir Tristram, that I never met with no knight but I was as\ngood as he, or better. Fie upon thee, said Sir Andred, false traitor\nthat thou art, with thine avaunting; for all thy boast thou shalt die\nthis day. O Andred, Andred, said Sir Tristram, thou shouldst be my\nkinsman, and now thou art to me full unfriendly, but an there were no\nmore but thou and I, thou wouldst not put me to death. No! said Sir\nAndred, and therewith he drew his sword, and would have slain him.\n\nWhen Sir Tristram saw him make such countenance he looked upon both his\nhands that were fast bounden unto two knights, and suddenly he pulled\nthem both to him, and unwrast his hands, and then he leapt unto his\ncousin, Sir Andred, and wrested his sword out of his hands; then he\nsmote Sir Andred that he fell to the earth, and so Sir Tristram fought\ntill that he had killed ten knights. So then Sir Tristram gat the chapel\nand kept it mightily. Then the cry was great, and the people drew fast\nunto Sir Andred, mo than an hundred. When Sir Tristram saw the people\ndraw unto him, he remembered he was naked, and sperd fast the chapel\ndoor, and brake the bars of a window, and so he leapt out and fell upon\nthe crags in the sea. And so at that time Sir Andred nor none of his\nfellows might get to him, at that time.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV. How Sir Tristram was holpen by his men, and of Queen Isoud\nwhich was put in a lazar-cote, and how Tristram was hurt.\n\nSO when they were departed, Gouvernail, and Sir Lambegus, and Sir\nSentraille de Lushon, that were Sir Tristram's men, sought their master.\nWhen they heard he was escaped then they were passing glad; and on the\nrocks they found him, and with towels they pulled him up. And then Sir\nTristram asked them where was La Beale Isoud, for he weened she had\nbeen had away of Andred's people. Sir, said Gouvernail, she is put in a\nlazar-cote. Alas, said Sir Tristram, this is a full ungoodly place for\nsuch a fair lady, and if I may she shall not be long there. And so he\ntook his men and went thereas was La Beale Isoud, and fetched her away,\nand brought her into a forest to a fair manor, and Sir Tristram there\nabode with her. So the good knight bade his men go from him: For at this\ntime I may not help you. So they departed all save Gouvernail. And so\nupon a day Sir Tristram yede into the forest for to disport him, and\nthen it happened that there he fell sleep; and there came a man that Sir\nTristram aforehand had slain his brother, and when this man had found\nhim he shot him through the shoulder with an arrow, and Sir Tristram\nleapt up and killed that man. And in the meantime it was told King Mark\nhow Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud were in that same manor, and as soon\nas ever he might thither he came with many knights to slay Sir Tristram.\nAnd when he came there he found him gone; and there he took La Beale\nIsoud home with him, and kept her strait that by no means never she\nmight wit nor send unto Tristram, nor he unto her. And then when Sir\nTristram came toward the old manor he found the track of many horses,\nand thereby he wist his lady was gone. And then Sir Tristram took great\nsorrow, and endured with great pain long time, for the arrow that he was\nhurt withal was envenomed.\n\nThen by the mean of La Beale Isoud she told a lady that was cousin unto\nDame Bragwaine, and she came to Sir Tristram, and told him that he might\nnot be whole by no means. For thy lady, La Beale Isoud, may not help\nthee, therefore she biddeth you haste into Brittany to King Howel, and\nthere ye shall find his daughter, Isoud la Blanche Mains, and she shall\nhelp thee. Then Sir Tristram and Gouvernail gat them shipping, and so\nsailed into Brittany. And when King Howel wist that it was Sir Tristram\nhe was full glad of him. Sir, he said, I am come into this country to\nhave help of your daughter, for it is told me that there is none other\nmay heal me but she; and so within a while she healed him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI. How Sir Tristram served in war King Howel of Brittany,\nand slew his adversary in the field.\n\nTHERE was an earl that hight Grip, and this earl made great war upon the\nking, and put the king to the worse, and besieged him. And on a time\nSir Kehydius, that was son to King Howel, as he issued out he was sore\nwounded, nigh to the death. Then Gouvernail went to the king and said:\nSir, I counsel you to desire my lord, Sir Tristram, as in your need to\nhelp you. I will do by your counsel, said the king. And so he yede unto\nSir Tristram, and prayed him in his wars to help him: For my son, Sir\nKehydius, may not go into the field. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I will go\nto the field and do what I may. Then Sir Tristram issued out of the\ntown with such fellowship as he might make, and did such deeds that all\nBrittany spake of him. And then, at the last, by great might and force,\nhe slew the Earl Grip with his own hands, and more than an hundred\nknights he slew that day. And then Sir Tristram was received\nworshipfully with procession. Then King Howel embraced him in his\narms, and said: Sir Tristram, all my kingdom I will resign to thee.\nGod defend, said Sir Tristram, for I am beholden unto you for your\ndaughter's sake to do for you.\n\nThen by the great means of King Howel and Kehydius his son, by great\nproffers, there grew great love betwixt Isoud and Sir Tristram, for that\nlady was both good and fair, and a woman of noble blood and fame.\nAnd for because Sir Tristram had such cheer and riches, and all other\npleasaunce that he had, almost he had forsaken La Beale Isoud. And so\nupon a time Sir Tristram agreed to wed Isoud la Blanche Mains. And at\nthe last they were wedded, and solemnly held their marriage. And so when\nthey were abed both Sir Tristram remembered him of his old lady La\nBeale Isoud. And then he took such a thought suddenly that he was all\ndismayed, and other cheer made he none but with clipping and kissing; as\nfor other fleshly lusts Sir Tristram never thought nor had ado with her:\nsuch mention maketh the French book; also it maketh mention that the\nlady weened there had been no pleasure but kissing and clipping. And in\nthe meantime there was a knight in Brittany, his name was Suppinabiles,\nand he came over the sea into England, and then he came into the court\nof King Arthur, and there he met with Sir Launcelot du Lake, and told\nhim of the marriage of Sir Tristram. Then said Sir Launcelot: Fie upon\nhim, untrue knight to his lady, that so noble a knight as Sir Tristram\nis should be found to his first lady false, La Beale Isoud, Queen of\nCornwall; but say ye him this, said Sir Launcelot, that of all knights\nin the world I loved him most, and had most joy of him, and all was for\nhis noble deeds; and let him wit the love between him and me is done\nfor ever, and that I give him warning from this day forth as his mortal\nenemy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII. How Sir Suppinabiles told Sir Tristram how he was\ndefamed in the court of King Arthur, and of Sir Lamorak.\n\nTHEN departed Sir Suppinabiles unto Brittany again, and there he found\nSir Tristram, and told him that he had been in King Arthur's court. Then\nsaid Sir Tristram: Heard ye anything of me? So God me help, said Sir\nSuppinabiles, there I heard Sir Launcelot speak of you great shame, and\nthat ye be a false knight to your lady and he bade me do you to wit that\nhe will be your mortal enemy in every place where he may meet you. That\nme repenteth, said Tristram, for of all knights I loved to be in his\nfellowship. So Sir Tristram made great moan and was ashamed that\nnoble knights should defame him for the sake of his lady. And in this\nmeanwhile La Beale Isoud made a letter unto Queen Guenever, complaining\nher of the untruth of Sir Tristram, and how he had wedded the king's\ndaughter of Brittany. Queen Guenever sent her another letter, and bade\nher be of good cheer, for she should have joy after sorrow, for Sir\nTristram was so noble a knight called, that by crafts of sorcery ladies\nwould make such noble men to wed them. But in the end, Queen Guenever\nsaid, it shall be thus, that he shall hate her, and love you better than\never he did to-fore.\n\nSo leave we Sir Tristram in Brittany, and speak we of Sir Lamorak de\nGalis, that as he sailed his ship fell on a rock and perished all, save\nSir Lamorak and his squire; and there he swam mightily, and fishers of\nthe Isle of Servage took him up, and his squire was drowned, and the\nshipmen had great labour to save Sir Lamorak's life, for all the comfort\nthat they could do.\n\nAnd the lord of that isle, hight Sir Nabon le Noire, a great mighty\ngiant. And this Sir Nabon hated all the knights of King Arthur's, and in\nno wise he would do them favour. And these fishers told Sir Lamorak all\nthe guise of Sir Nabon; how there came never knight of King Arthur's\nbut he destroyed him. And at the last battle that he did was slain Sir\nNanowne le Petite, the which he put to a shameful death in despite of\nKing Arthur, for he was drawn limb-meal. That forthinketh me, said Sir\nLamorak, for that knight's death, for he was my cousin; and if I were at\nmine ease as well as ever I was, I would revenge his death. Peace, said\nthe fishers, and make here no words, for or ever ye depart from hence\nSir Nabon must know that ye have been here, or else we should die for\nyour sake. So that I be whole, said Lamorak, of my disease that I have\ntaken in the sea, I will that ye tell him that I am a knight of King\nArthur's, for I was never afeard to reneye my lord.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII. How Sir Tristram and his wife arrived in Wales, and how\nhe met there with Sir Lamorak.\n\nNOW turn we unto Sir Tristram, that upon a day he took a little barget,\nand his wife Isoud la Blanche Mains, with Sir Kehydius her brother, to\nplay them in the coasts. And when they were from the land, there was\na wind drove them in to the coast of Wales upon this Isle of Servage,\nwhereas was Sir Lamorak, and there the barget all to-rove; and there\nDame Isoud was hurt; and as well as they might they gat into the forest,\nand there by a well he saw Segwarides and a damosel. And then either\nsaluted other. Sir, said Segwarides, I know you for Sir Tristram de\nLiones, the man in the world that I have most cause to hate, because\nye departed the love between me and my wife; but as for that, said\nSir Segwarides, I will never hate a noble knight for a light lady; and\ntherefore, I pray you, be my friend, and I will be yours unto my power;\nfor wit ye well ye are hard bestead in this valley, and we shall have\nenough to do either of us to succour other. And then Sir Segwarides\nbrought Sir Tristram to a lady thereby that was born in Cornwall, and\nshe told him all the perils of that valley, and how there came never\nknight there but he were taken prisoner or slain. Wit you well, fair\nlady, said Sir Tristram, that I slew Sir Marhaus and delivered Cornwall\nfrom the truage of Ireland, and I am he that delivered the King of\nIreland from Sir Blamore de Ganis, and I am he that beat Sir Palamides;\nand wit ye well I am Sir Tristram de Liones, that by the grace of God\nshall deliver this woful Isle of Servage. So Sir Tristram was well\neased.\n\nThen one told him there was a knight of King Arthur's that was wrecked\non the rocks. What is his name? said Sir Tristram. We wot not, said the\nfishers, but he keepeth it no counsel but that he is a knight of King\nArthur's, and by the mighty lord of this isle he setteth nought. I pray\nyou, said Sir Tristram, an ye may, bring him hither that I may see him,\nand if he be any of the knights of Arthur's I shall know him. Then the\nlady prayed the fishers to bring him to her place. So on the morrow they\nbrought him thither in a fisher's raiment; and as soon as Sir Tristram\nsaw him he smiled upon him and knew him well, but he knew not Sir\nTristram. Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth by your cheer ye\nhave been diseased but late, and also methinketh I should know you\nheretofore. I will well, said Sir Lamorak, that ye have seen me and met\nwith me. Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, tell me your name. Upon a covenant\nI will tell you, said Sir Lamorak, that is, that ye will tell me\nwhether ye be lord of this island or no, that is called Nabon le Noire.\nForsooth, said Sir Tristram, I am not he, nor I hold not of him; I am\nhis foe as well as ye be, and so shall I be found or I depart out of\nthis isle. Well, said Sir Lamorak, since ye have said so largely unto\nme, my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis, son unto King Pellinore. Forsooth,\nI trow well, said Sir Tristram, for an ye said other I know the\ncontrary. What are ye, said Sir Lamorak, that knoweth me? I am Sir\nTristram de Liones. Ah, sir, remember ye not of the fall ye did give me\nonce, and after ye refused me to fight on foot. That was not for fear I\nhad of you, said Sir Tristram, but me shamed at that time to have more\nado with you, for meseemed ye had enough; but, Sir Lamorak, for my\nkindness many ladies ye put to a reproof when ye sent the horn from\nMorgan le Fay to King Mark, whereas ye did this in despite of me. Well,\nsaid he, an it were to do again, so would I do, for I had liefer strife\nand debate fell in King Mark's court rather than Arthur's court, for\nthe honour of both courts be not alike. As to that, said Sir Tristram, I\nknow well; but that that was done it was for despite of me, but all your\nmalice, I thank God, hurt not greatly. Therefore, said Sir Tristram, ye\nshall leave all your malice, and so will I, and let us assay how we may\nwin worship between you and me upon this giant Sir Nabon le Noire that\nis lord of this island, to destroy him. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, now I\nunderstand your knighthood, it may not be false that all men say, for of\nyour bounty, noblesse, and worship, of all knights ye are peerless, and\nfor your courtesy and gentleness I showed you ungentleness, and that now\nme repenteth.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX. How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Nabon, and overcame him,\nand made Sir Segwarides lord of the isle.\n\nIN the meantime there came word that Sir Nabon had made a cry that all\nthe people of that isle should be at his castle the fifth day after. And\nthe same day the son of Nabon should be made knight, and all the knights\nof that valley and thereabout should be there to joust, and all those of\nthe realm of Logris should be there to joust with them of North Wales:\nand thither came five hundred knights, and they of the country brought\nthither Sir Lamorak, and Sir Tristram, and Sir Kehydius, and Sir\nSegwarides, for they durst none otherwise do; and then Sir Nabon lent\nSir Lamorak horse and armour at Sir Lamorak's desire, and Sir Lamorak\njousted and did such deeds of arms that Nabon and all the people said\nthere was never knight that ever they saw do such deeds of arms; for, as\nthe French book saith, he for-jousted all that were there, for the most\npart of five hundred knights, that none abode him in his saddle.\n\nThen Sir Nabon proffered to play with him his play: For I saw never no\nknight do so much upon a day. I will well, said Sir Lamorak, play as I\nmay, but I am weary and sore bruised. And there either gat a spear, but\nNabon would not encounter with Sir Lamorak, but smote his horse in the\nforehead, and so slew him; and then Sir Lamorak yede on foot, and turned\nhis shield and drew his sword, and there began strong battle on foot.\nBut Sir Lamorak was so sore bruised and short breathed, that he traced\nand traversed somewhat aback. Fair fellow, said Sir Nabon, hold thy hand\nand I shall show thee more courtesy than ever I showed knight, because\nI have seen this day thy noble knighthood, and therefore stand thou by,\nand I will wit whether any of thy fellows will have ado with me. Then\nwhen Sir Tristram heard that, he stepped forth and said: Nabon, lend me\nhorse and sure armour, and I will have ado with thee. Well, fellow, said\nSir Nabon, go thou to yonder pavilion, and arm thee of the best thou\nfindest there, and I shall play a marvellous play with thee. Then said\nSir Tristram: Look ye play well, or else peradventure I shall learn\nyou a new play. That is well said, fellow, said Sir Nabon. So when Sir\nTristram was armed as him liked best, and well shielded and sworded, he\ndressed to him on foot; for well he knew that Sir Nabon would not abide\na stroke with a spear, therefore he would slay all knights' horses. Now,\nfair fellow, Sir Nabon, let us play. So then they fought long on foot,\ntracing and traversing, smiting and foining long without any rest. At\nthe last Sir Nabon prayed him to tell him his name. Sir Nabon, I tell\nthee my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, a knight of Cornwall under King\nMark. Thou art welcome, said Sir Nabon, for of all knights I have most\ndesired to fight with thee or with Sir Launcelot.\n\nSo then they went eagerly together, and Sir Tristram slew Sir Nabon, and\nso forthwith he leapt to his son, and struck off his head; and then\nall the country said they would hold of Sir Tristram. Nay, said Sir\nTristram, I will not so; here is a worshipful knight, Sir Lamorak de\nGalis, that for me he shall be lord of this country, for he hath done\nhere great deeds of arms. Nay, said Sir Lamorak, I will not be lord of\nthis country, for I have not deserved it as well as ye, therefore give\nye it where ye will, for I will none have. Well, said Sir Tristram,\nsince ye nor I will not have it, let us give it to him that hath not so\nwell deserved it. Do as ye list, said Segwarides, for the gift is\nyours, for I will none have an I had deserved it. So was it given\nto Segwarides, whereof he thanked them; and so was he lord, and\nworshipfully he did govern it. And then Sir Segwarides delivered all\nprisoners, and set good governance in that valley; and so he returned\ninto Cornwall, and told King Mark and La Beale Isoud how Sir Tristram\nhad advanced him to the Isle of Servage, and there he proclaimed in all\nCornwall of all the adventures of these two knights, so was it openly\nknown. But full woe was La Beale Isoud when she heard tell that Sir\nTristram was wedded to Isoud la Blanche Mains.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nHow Sir Lamorak departed from Sir Tristram, and how he met with Sir\nFrol, and after with Sir Launcelot.\n\nSO turn we unto Sir Lamorak, that rode toward Arthur's court, and Sir\nTristram's wife and Kehydius took a vessel and sailed into Brittany,\nunto King Howel, where he was welcome. And when he heard of these\nadventures they marvelled of his noble deeds. Now turn we unto Sir\nLamorak, that when he was departed from Sir Tristram he rode out of the\nforest, till he came to an hermitage. When the hermit saw him, he asked\nhim from whence he came. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, I come from this valley.\nSir, said the hermit: thereof I marvel. For this twenty winter I\nsaw never no knight pass this country but he was either slain or\nvillainously wounded, or pass as a poor prisoner. Those ill customs,\nsaid Sir Lamorak, are fordone, for Sir Tristram slew your lord, Sir\nNabon, and his son. Then was the hermit glad, and all his brethren,\nfor he said there was never such a tyrant among Christian men. And\ntherefore, said the hermit, this valley and franchise we will hold of\nSir Tristram.\n\nSo on the morrow Sir Lamorak departed; and as he rode he saw four\nknights fight against one, and that one knight defended him well, but\nat the last the four knights had him down. And then Sir Lamorak went\nbetwixt them, and asked them why they would slay that one knight, and\nsaid it was shame, four against one. Thou shalt well wit, said the four\nknights, that he is false. That is your tale, said Sir Lamorak, and\nwhen I hear him also speak, I will say as ye say. Then said Lamorak: Ah,\nknight, can ye not excuse you, but that ye are a false knight. Sir, said\nhe, yet can I excuse me both with my word and with my hands, that I will\nmake good upon one of the best of them, my body to his body. Then spake\nthey all at once: We will not jeopardy our bodies as for thee. But wit\nthou well, they said, an King Arthur were here himself, it should not\nlie in his power to save his life. That is too much said, said Sir\nLamorak, but many speak behind a man more than they will say to his\nface; and because of your words ye shall understand that I am one of the\nsimplest of King Arthur's court; in the worship of my lord now do your\nbest, and in despite of you I shall rescue him. And then they lashed all\nat once to Sir Lamorak, but anon at two strokes Sir Lamorak had slain\ntwo of them, and then the other two fled. So then Sir Lamorak turned\nagain to that knight, and asked him his name. Sir, he said, my name is\nSir Frol of the Out Isles. Then he rode with Sir Lamorak and bare him\ncompany.\n\nAnd as they rode by the way they saw a seemly knight riding against\nthem, and all in white. Ah, said Frol, yonder knight jousted late with\nme and smote me down, therefore I will joust with him. Ye shall not do\nso, said Sir Lamorak, by my counsel, an ye will tell me your quarrel,\nwhether ye jousted at his request, or he at yours. Nay, said Sir Frol,\nI jousted with him at my request. Sir, said Lamorak, then will I counsel\nyou deal no more with him, for meseemeth by his countenance he should be\na noble knight, and no japer; for methinketh he should be of the Table\nRound. Therefore I will not spare, said Sir Frol. And then he cried and\nsaid: Sir knight, make thee ready to joust. That needeth not, said\nthe White Knight, for I have no lust to joust with thee; but yet they\nfeutred their spears, and the White Knight overthrew Sir Frol, and then\nhe rode his way a soft pace. Then Sir Lamorak rode after him, and prayed\nhim to tell him his name: For meseemeth ye should be of the fellowship\nof the Round Table. Upon a covenant, said he, I will tell you my name,\nso that ye will not discover my name, and also that ye will tell me\nyours. Then, said he, my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. And my name\nis Sir Launcelot du Lake. Then they put up their swords, and kissed\nheartily together, and either made great joy of other. Sir, said Sir\nLamorak, an it please you I will do you service. God defend, said\nLauncelot, that any of so noble a blood as ye be should do me service.\nThen he said: More, I am in a quest that I must do myself alone. Now God\nspeed you, said Sir Lamorak, and so they departed. Then Sir Lamorak came\nto Sir Frol and horsed him again. What knight is that? said Sir Frol.\nSir, he said, it is not for you to know, nor it is no point of my\ncharge. Ye are the more uncourteous, said Sir Frol, and therefore I will\ndepart from you. Ye may do as ye list, said Sir Lamorak, and yet by\nmy company ye have saved the fairest flower of your garland; so they\ndeparted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI. How Sir Lamorak slew Sir Frol, and of the courteous\nfighting with Sir Belliance his brother.\n\nTHEN within two or three days Sir Lamorak found a knight at a well\nsleeping, and his lady sat with him and waked. Right so came Sir Gawaine\nand took the knight's lady, and set her up behind his squire. So Sir\nLamorak rode after Sir Gawaine, and said: Sir Gawaine, turn again. And\nthen said Sir Gawaine: What will ye do with me? for I am nephew unto\nKing Arthur. Sir, said he, for that cause I will spare you, else that\nlady should abide with me, or else ye should joust with me. Then Sir\nGawaine turned him and ran to him that ought the lady, with his spear,\nbut the knight with pure might smote down Sir Gawaine, and took his lady\nwith him. All this Sir Lamorak saw, and said to himself: But I revenge\nmy fellow he will say of me dishonour in King Arthur's court. Then Sir\nLamorak returned and proffered that knight to joust. Sir, said he, I am\nready. And there they came together with all their might, and there Sir\nLamorak smote the knight through both sides that he fell to the earth\ndead.\n\nThen that lady rode to that knight's brother that hight Belliance le\nOrgulus, that dwelt fast thereby, and then she told him how his brother\nwas slain. Alas, said he, I will be revenged. And so he horsed him, and\narmed him, and within a while he overtook Sir Lamorak, and bade him:\nTurn and leave that lady, for thou and I must play a new play; for thou\nhast slain my brother Sir Frol, that was a better knight than ever wert\nthou. It might well be, said Sir Lamorak, but this day in the field I\nwas found the better. So they rode together, and unhorsed other, and\nturned their shields, and drew their swords, and fought mightily as\nnoble knights proved, by the space of two hours. So then Sir Belliance\nprayed him to tell him his name. Sir, said he, my name is Sir Lamorak de\nGalis. Ah, said Sir Belliance, thou art the man in the world that I most\nhate, for I slew my sons for thy sake, where I saved thy life, and now\nthou hast slain my brother Sir Frol. Alas, how should I be accorded with\nthee; therefore defend thee, for thou shalt die, there is none other\nremedy. Alas, said Sir Lamorak, full well me ought to know you, for\nye are the man that most have done for me. And therewithal Sir Lamorak\nkneeled down, and besought him of grace. Arise, said Sir Belliance, or\nelse thereas thou kneelest I shall slay thee. That shall not need, said\nSir Lamorak, for I will yield me unto you, not for fear of you, nor for\nyour strength, but your goodness maketh me full loath to have ado with\nyou; wherefore I require you for God's sake, and for the honour of\nknighthood, forgive me all that I have offended unto you. Alas, said\nBelliance, leave thy kneeling, or else I shall slay thee without mercy.\n\n\nThen they yede again unto battle, and either wounded other, that all\nthe ground was bloody thereas they fought. And at the last Belliance\nwithdrew him aback and set him down softly upon a little hill, for he\nwas so faint for bleeding that he might not stand. Then Sir Lamorak\nthrew his shield upon his back, and asked him what cheer. Well, said Sir\nBelliance. Ah, Sir, yet shall I show you favour in your mal-ease. Ah,\nKnight Sir Belliance, said Sir Lamorak, thou art a fool, for an I had\nhad thee at such advantage as thou hast done me, I should slay thee; but\nthy gentleness is so good and so large, that I must needs forgive thee\nmine evil will. And then Sir Lamorak kneeled down, and unlaced first his\numberere, and then his own, and then either kissed other with weeping\ntears. Then Sir Lamorak led Sir Belliance to an abbey fast by, and there\nSir Lamorak would not depart from Belliance till he was whole. And then\nthey sware together that none of them should never fight against other.\nSo Sir Lamorak departed and went to the court of King Arthur.\n\nHere leave we of Sir Lamorak and of Sir Tristram. And here beginneth the\nhistory of La Cote Male Taile.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IX.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. How a young man came into the court of King Arthur, and how\nSir Kay called him in scorn La Cote Male Taile.\n\nAT the court of King Arthur there came a young man and bigly made, and\nhe was richly beseen: and he desired to be made knight of the king, but\nhis over-garment sat over-thwartly, howbeit it was rich cloth of gold.\nWhat is your name? said King Arthur. Sir, said he, my name is Breunor\nle Noire, and within short space ye shall know that I am of good kin.\nIt may well be, said Sir Kay, the Seneschal, but in mockage ye shall be\ncalled La Cote Male Taile, that is as much to say, the evil-shapen coat\nIt is a great thing that thou askest, said the king; and for what cause\nwearest thou that rich coat? tell me, for I can well think for some\ncause it is. Sir, he answered, I had a father, a noble knight, and as he\nrode a-hunting, upon a day it happed him to lay him down to sleep; and\nthere came a knight that had been long his enemy, and when he saw he was\nfast asleep he all to-hew him; and this same coat had my father on the\nsame time; and that maketh this coat to sit so evil upon me, for the\nstrokes be on it as I found it, and never shall be amended for me. Thus\nto have my father's death in remembrance I wear this coat till I be\nrevenged; and because ye are called the most noblest king of the world I\ncome to you that ye should make me knight. Sir, said Sir Lamorak and Sir\nGaheris, it were well done to make him knight; for him beseemeth well\nof person and of countenance, that he shall prove a good man, and a good\nknight, and a mighty; for, Sir, an ye be remembered, even such one was\nSir Launcelot du Lake when he came first into this court, and full few\nof us knew from whence he came; and now is he proved the man of most\nworship in the world; and all your court and all your Round Table is by\nSir Launcelot worshipped and amended more than by any knight now living.\nThat is truth, said the king, and to-morrow at your request I shall make\nhim knight.\n\nSo on the morrow there was an hart found, and thither rode King Arthur\nwith a company of his knights to slay the hart. And this young man\nthat Sir Kay named La Cote Male Taile was there left behind with Queen\nGuenever; and by sudden adventure there was an horrible lion kept in a\nstrong tower of stone, and it happened that he at that time brake loose,\nand came hurling afore the queen and her knights. And when the queen saw\nthe lion she cried and fled, and prayed her knights to rescue her. And\nthere was none of them all but twelve that abode, and all the other\nfled. Then said La Cote Male Taile: Now I see well that all coward\nknights be not dead; and therewithal he drew his sword and dressed him\nafore the lion. And that lion gaped wide and came upon him ramping to\nhave slain him. And he then smote him in the midst of the head such a\nmighty stroke that it clave his head in sunder, and dashed to the earth.\nThen was it told the queen how the young man that Sir Kay named by scorn\nLa Cote Male Taile had slain the lion. With that the king came home.\nAnd when the queen told him of that adventure, he was well pleased, and\nsaid: Upon pain of mine head he shall prove a noble man and a faithful\nknight, and true of his promise: then the king forthwithal made him\nknight. Now Sir, said this young knight, I require you and all the\nknights of your court, that ye call me by none other name but La Cote\nMale Taile: in so much as Sir Kay hath so named me so will I be called.\nI assent me well thereto, said the king.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. How a damosel came into the court and desired a knight to\ntake on him an enquest, which La Cote Male Taile emprised.\n\nTHEN that same day there came a damosel into the court, and she brought\nwith her a great black shield, with a white hand in the midst holding a\nsword. Other picture was there none in that shield. When King Arthur saw\nher he asked her from whence she came and what she would. Sir, she said,\nI have ridden long and many a day with this shield many ways, and for\nthis cause I am come to your court: there was a good knight that ought\nthis shield, and this knight had undertaken a great deed of arms to\nenchieve it; and so it misfortuned him another strong knight met with\nhim by sudden adventure, and there they fought long, and either wounded\nother passing sore; and they were so weary that they left that battle\neven hand. So this knight that ought this shield saw none other way but\nhe must die; and then he commanded me to bear this shield to the court\nof King Arthur, he requiring and praying some good knight to take this\nshield, and that he would fulfil the quest that he was in. Now what say\nye to this quest? said King Arthur; is there any of you here that will\ntake upon him to wield this shield? Then was there not one that would\nspeak one word. Then Sir Kay took the shield in his hands. Sir knight,\nsaid the damosel, what is your name? Wit ye well, said he, my name\nis Sir Kay, the Seneschal, that wide-where is known. Sir, said that\ndamosel, lay down that shield, for wit ye well it falleth not for you,\nfor he must be a better knight than ye that shall wield this shield.\nDamosel, said Sir Kay, wit ye well I took this shield in my hands by\nyour leave for to behold it, not to that intent; but go wheresomever\nthou wilt, for I will not go with you.\n\n\nThen the damosel stood still a great while and beheld many of those\nknights. Then spake the knight, La Cote Male Taile: Fair damosel, I\nwill take the shield and that adventure upon me, so I wist I should know\nwhitherward my journey might be; for because I was this day made knight\nI would take this adventure upon me. What is your name, fair young man?\nsaid the damosel. My name is, said he, La Cote Male Taile. Well mayest\nthou be called so, said the damosel, the knight with the evil-shapen\ncoat; but an thou be so hardy to take upon thee to bear that shield and\nto follow me, wit thou well thy skin shall be as well hewn as thy coat.\nAs for that, said La Cote Male Taile, when I am so hewn I will ask you\nno salve to heal me withal. And forthwithal there came into the court\ntwo squires and brought him great horses, and his armour, and his\nspears, and anon he was armed and took his leave. I would not by my\nwill, said the king, that ye took upon you that hard adventure. Sir,\nsaid he, this adventure is mine, and the first that ever I took upon\nme, and that will I follow whatsomever come of me. Then that damosel\ndeparted, and La Cote Male Taile fast followed after. And within a while\nhe overtook the damosel, and anon she missaid him in the foulest manner.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. How La Cote Male Taile overthrew Sir Dagonet the king's\nfool, and of the rebuke that he had of the damosel.\n\nTHEN Sir Kay ordained Sir Dagonet, King Arthur's fool, to follow after\nLa Cote Male Taile; and there Sir Kay ordained that Sir Dagonet was\nhorsed and armed, and bade him follow La Cote Male Taile and proffer him\nto joust, and so he did; and when he saw La Cote Male Taile, he cried\nand bade him make him ready to joust. So Sir La Cote Male Taile smote\nSir Dagonet over his horse's croup. Then the damosel mocked La Cote Male\nTaile, and said: Fie for shame! now art thou shamed in Arthur's court,\nwhen they send a fool to have ado with thee, and specially at thy first\njousts; thus she rode long, and chid. And within a while there came\nSir Bleoberis, the good knight, and there he jousted with La Cote Male\nTaile, and there Sir Bleoberis smote him so sore, that horse and all\nfell to the earth. Then La Cote Male Taile arose up lightly, and dressed\nhis shield, and drew his sword, and would have done battle to the\nutterance, for he was wood wroth. Not so, said Sir Bleoberis de Ganis,\nas at this time I will not fight upon foot. Then the damosel Maledisant\nrebuked him in the foulest manner, and bade him: Turn again, coward. Ah,\ndamosel, he said, I pray you of mercy to missay me no more, my grief is\nenough though ye give me no more; I call myself never the worse knight\nwhen a mare's son faileth me, and also I count me never the worse knight\nfor a fall of Sir Bleoberis.\n\nSo thus he rode with her two days; and by fortune there came Sir\nPalomides and encountered with him, and he in the same wise served him\nas did Bleoberis to-forehand. What dost thou here in my fellowship? said\nthe damosel Maledisant, thou canst not sit no knight, nor withstand him\none buffet, but if it were Sir Dagonet. Ah, fair damosel, I am not the\nworse to take a fall of Sir Palomides, and yet great disworship have I\nnone, for neither Bleoberis nor yet Palomides would not fight with me on\nfoot. As for that, said the damosel, wit thou well they have disdain and\nscorn to light off their horses to fight with such a lewd knight as thou\nart. So in the meanwhile there came Sir Mordred, Sir Gawaine's brother,\nand so he fell in the fellowship with the damosel Maledisant. And then\nthey came afore the Castle Orgulous, and there was such a custom that\nthere might no knight come by that castle but either he must joust or be\nprisoner, or at the least to lose his horse and his harness. And there\ncame out two knights against them, and Sir Mordred jousted with the\nforemost, and that knight of the castle smote Sir Mordred down off his\nhorse. And then La Cote Male Taile jousted with that other, and either\nof them smote other down, horse and all, to the earth. And when they\navoided their horses, then either of them took other's horses. And then\nLa Cote Male Taile rode unto that knight that smote down Sir Mordred,\nand jousted with him. And there Sir La Cote Male Taile hurt and wounded\nhim passing sore, and put him from his horse as he had been dead. So he\nturned unto him that met him afore, and he took the flight towards\nthe castle, and Sir La Cote Male Taile rode after him into the Castle\nOrgulous, and there La Cote Male Taile slew him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. How La Cote Male Taile fought against an hundred knights,\nand how he escaped by the mean of a lady.\n\nAND anon there came an hundred knights about him and assailed him; and\nwhen he saw his horse should be slain he alighted and voided his horse,\nand put the bridle under his feet, and so put him out of the gate. And\nwhen he had so done he hurled in among them, and dressed his back unto a\nlady's chamber-wall, thinking himself that he had liefer die there with\nworship than to abide the rebukes of the damosel Maledisant. And in the\nmeantime as he stood and fought, that lady whose was the chamber went\nout slily at her postern, and without the gates she found La Cote Male\nTaile's horse, and lightly she gat him by the bridle, and tied him\nto the postern. And then she went unto her chamber slily again for to\nbehold how that one knight fought against an hundred knights. And when\nshe had beheld him long she went to a window behind his back, and said:\nThou knight, thou fightest wonderly well, but for all that at the last\nthou must needs die, but, an thou canst through thy mighty prowess, win\nunto yonder postern, for there have I fastened thy horse to abide thee:\nbut wit thou well thou must think on thy worship, and think not to\ndie, for thou mayst not win unto that postern without thou do nobly and\nmightily. When La Cote Male Taile heard her say so he gripped his\nsword in his hands, and put his shield fair afore him, and through the\nthickest press he thrulled through them. And when he came to the postern\nhe found there ready four knights, and at two the first strokes he slew\ntwo of the knights, and the other fled; and so he won his horse and rode\nfrom them. And all as it was it was rehearsed in King Arthur's court,\nhow he slew twelve knights within the Castle Orgulous; and so he rode on\nhis way.\n\nAnd in the meanwhile the damosel said to Sir Mordred: I ween my foolish\nknight be either slain or taken prisoner: then were they ware where he\ncame riding. And when he was come unto them he told all how he had sped\nand escaped in despite of them all: And some of the best of them will\ntell no tales. Thou liest falsely, said the damosel, that dare I make\ngood, but as a fool and a dastard to all knighthood they have let thee\npass. That may ye prove, said La Cote Male Taile. With that she sent a\ncourier of hers, that rode alway with her, for to know the truth of this\ndeed; and so he rode thither lightly, and asked how and in what manner\nthat La Cote Male Taile was escaped out of the castle. Then all the\nknights cursed him, and said that he was a fiend and no man: For he hath\nslain here twelve of our best knights, and we weened unto this day that\nit had been too much for Sir Launcelot du Lake or for Sir Tristram de\nLiones. And in despite of us all he is departed from us and maugre our\nheads.\n\nWith this answer the courier departed and came to Maledisant his lady,\nand told her all how Sir La Cote Male Taile had sped at the Castle\nOrgulous. Then she smote down her head, and said little. By my head,\nsaid Sir Mordred to the damosel, ye are greatly to blame so to rebuke\nhim, for I warn you plainly he is a good knight, and I doubt not but\nhe shall prove a noble knight; but as yet he may not yet sit sure on\nhorseback, for he that shall be a good horseman it must come of usage\nand exercise. But when he cometh to the strokes of his sword he is then\nnoble and mighty, and that saw Sir Bleoberis and Sir Palomides, for wit\nye well they are wily men of arms, and anon they know when they see a\nyoung knight by his riding, how they are sure to give him a fall from\nhis horse or a great buffet. But for the most part they will not light\non foot with young knights, for they are wight and strongly armed. For\nin likewise Sir Launcelot du Lake, when he was first made knight, he was\noften put to the worse upon horseback, but ever upon foot he recovered\nhis renown, and slew and defoiled many knights of the Round Table. And\ntherefore the rebukes that Sir Launcelot did unto many knights causeth\nthem that be men of prowess to beware; for often I have seen the old\nproved knights rebuked and slain by them that were but young beginners.\nThus they rode sure talking by the way together.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. How Sir Launcelot came to the court and heard of La Cote Male\nTaile, and how he followed after him, and how La Cote Male Taile was\nprisoner.\n\nHERE leave we off a while of this tale, and speak we of Sir Launcelot du\nLake,[*9] that when he was come to the court of King Arthur, then heard\nhe tell of the young knight La Cote Male Taile, how he slew the lion,\nand how he took upon him the adventure of the black shield, the which\nwas named at that time the hardiest adventure of the world. So God me\nsave, said Sir Launcelot unto many of his fellows, it was shame to all\nthe noble knights to suffer such a young knight to take such adventure\nupon him for his destruction; for I will that ye wit, said Sir\nLauncelot, that that damosel Maledisant hath borne that shield many a\nday for to seek the most proved knights, and that was she that Breuse\nSaunce Pite took that shield from her, and after Tristram de Liones\nrescued that shield from him and gave it to the damosel again, a little\nafore that time that Sir Tristram fought with my nephew Sir Blamore de\nGanis, for a quarrel that was betwixt the King of Ireland and him. Then\nmany knights were sorry that Sir La Cote Male Taile was gone forth to\nthat adventure. Truly, said Sir Launcelot, I cast me to ride after him.\nAnd within seven days Sir Launcelot overtook La Cote Male Taile, and\nthen he saluted him and the damosel Maledisant. And when Sir Mordred saw\nSir Launcelot, then he left their fellowship; and so Sir Launcelot rode\nwith them all a day, and ever that damosel rebuked La Cote Male Taile;\nand then Sir Launcelot answered for him, then she left off, and rebuked\nSir Launcelot.\n\n\n[*9] Printed by Caxton as part of chap. iv.\n\n\nSo this meantime Sir Tristram sent by a damosel a letter unto Sir\nLauncelot, excusing him of the wedding of Isoud la Blanche Mains; and\nsaid in the letter, as he was a true knight he had never ado fleshly\nwith Isoud la Blanche Mains; and passing courteously and gentily Sir\nTristram wrote unto Sir Launcelot, ever beseeching him to be his good\nfriend and unto La Beale Isoud of Cornwall, and that Sir Launcelot would\nexcuse him if that ever he saw her. And within short time by the grace\nof God, said Sir Tristram, that he would speak with La Beale Isoud, and\nwith him right hastily. Then Sir Launcelot departed from the damosel and\nfrom Sir La Cote Male Taile, for to oversee that letter, and to write\nanother letter unto Sir Tristram de Liones.\n\nAnd in the meanwhile La Cote Male Taile rode with the damosel until they\ncame to a castle that hight Pendragon; and there were six knights stood\nafore him, and one of them proffered to joust with La Cote Male Taile.\nAnd there La Cote Male Taile smote him over his horse's croup. And then\nthe five knights set upon him all at once with their spears, and\nthere they smote La Cote Male Taile down, horse and man. And then they\nalighted suddenly, and set their hands upon him all at once, and took\nhim prisoner, and so led him unto the castle and kept him as prisoner.\n\nAnd on the morn Sir Launcelot arose, and delivered the damosel with\nletters unto Sir Tristram, and then he took his way after La Cote Male\nTaile; and by the way upon a bridge there was a knight proffered Sir\nLauncelot to joust, and Sir Launcelot smote him down, and then they\nfought upon foot a noble battle together, and a mighty; and at the last\nSir Launcelot smote him down grovelling upon his hands and his knees.\nAnd then that knight yielded him, and Sir Launcelot received him fair.\nSir, said the knight, I require thee tell me your name, for much my\nheart giveth unto you. Nay, said Sir Launcelot, as at this time I will\nnot tell you my name, unless then that ye tell me your name. Certainly,\nsaid the knight, my name is Sir Nerovens, that was made knight of my\nlord Sir Launcelot du Lake. Ah, Nerovens de Lile, said Sir Launcelot, I\nam right glad that ye are proved a good knight, for now wit ye well my\nname is Sir Launcelot du Lake. Alas, said Sir Nerovens de Lile, what\nhave I done! And therewithal flatling he fell to his feet, and would\nhave kissed them, but Sir Launcelot would not let him; and then either\nmade great joy of other. And then Sir Nerovens told Sir Launcelot that\nhe should not go by the Castle of Pendragon: For there is a lord, a\nmighty knight, and many knights with him, and this night I heard say\nthat they took a knight prisoner yesterday that rode with a damosel, and\nthey say he is a Knight of the Round Table.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. How Sir Launcelot fought with six knights, and after with\nSir Brian, and how he delivered the prisoners.\n\nAH, said Sir Launcelot, that knight is my fellow, and him shall I rescue\nor else I shall lose my life therefore. And therewithal he rode fast\ntill he came before the Castle of Pendragon; and anon therewithal there\ncame six knights, and all made them ready to set upon Sir Launcelot at\nonce; then Sir Launcelot feutred his spear, and smote the foremost that\nhe brake his back in-sunder, and three of them hit and three failed. And\nthen Sir Launcelot passed through them, and lightly he turned in again,\nand smote another knight through the breast and throughout the back more\nthan an ell, and therewithal his spear brake. So then all the remnant of\nthe four knights drew their swords and lashed at Sir Launcelot. And at\nevery stroke Sir Launcelot bestowed so his strokes that at four strokes\nsundry they avoided their saddles, passing sore wounded; and forthwithal\nhe rode hurling into that castle.\n\nAnd anon the lord of the castle, that was that time cleped Sir Brian de\nles Isles, the which was a noble man and a great enemy unto King Arthur,\nwithin a while he was armed and upon horseback. And then they feutred\ntheir spears and hurled together so strongly that both their horses\nrashed to the earth. And then they avoided their saddles, and dressed\ntheir shields, and drew their swords, and flang together as wood men,\nand there were many strokes given in a while. At the last Sir Launcelot\ngave to Sir Brian such a buffet that he kneeled upon his knees, and then\nSir Launcelot rashed upon him, and with great force he pulled off his\nhelm; and when Sir Brian saw that he should be slain he yielded him, and\nput him in his mercy and in his grace. Then Sir Launcelot made him to\ndeliver all his prisoners that he had within his castle, and therein Sir\nLauncelot found of Arthur's knights thirty, and forty ladies, and so he\ndelivered them; and then he rode his way. And anon as La Cote Male\nTaile was delivered he gat his horse, and his harness, and his damosel\nMaledisant.\n\nThe meanwhile Sir Nerovens, that Sir Launcelot had foughten withal afore\nat the bridge, he sent a damosel after Sir Launcelot to wit how he sped\nat the Castle of Pendragon. And then they within the castle marvelled\nwhat knight he was, when Sir Brian and his knights delivered all those\nprisoners. Have ye no marvel, said the damosel, for the best knight in\nthis world was here, and did this journey, and wit ye well, she said,\nit was Sir Launcelot. Then was Sir Brian full glad, and so was his\nlady, and all his knights, that such a man should win them. And when the\ndamosel and La Cote Male Taile understood that it was Sir Launcelot du\nLake that had ridden with them in fellowship, and that she remembered\nher how she had rebuked him and called him coward, then was she passing\nheavy.\n\nCHAPTER VII. How Sir Launcelot met with the damosel named Male disant,\nand named her the Damosel Bienpensant.\n\nSO then they took their horses and rode forth a pace after Sir\nLauncelot. And within two mile they overtook him, and saluted him, and\nthanked him, and the damosel cried Sir Launcelot mercy of her evil deed\nand saying: For now I know the flower of all knighthood is departed even\nbetween Sir Tristram and you. For God knoweth, said the damosel, that I\nhave sought you my lord, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Tristram long, and now\nI thank God I have met with you; and once at Camelot I met with Sir\nTristram, and there he rescued this black shield with the white hand\nholding a naked sword that Sir Breuse Saunce Pite had taken from me.\nNow, fair damosel, said Sir Launcelot, who told you my name? Sir, said\nshe, there came a damosel from a knight that ye fought withal at the\nbridge, and she told me your name was Sir Launcelot du Lake. Blame have\nshe then, said Sir Launcelot, but her lord, Sir Nerovens, hath told her.\nBut, damosel, said Sir Launcelot, upon this covenant I will ride with\nyou, so that ye will not rebuke this knight Sir La Cote Male Taile no\nmore; for he is a good knight, and I doubt not he shall prove a noble\nknight, and for his sake and pity that he should not be destroyed I\nfollowed him to succour him in this great need. Ah, Jesu thank you, said\nthe damosel, for now I will say unto you and to him both, I rebuked him\nnever for no hate that I hated him, but for great love that I had to\nhim. For ever I supposed that he had been too young and too tender to\ntake upon him these adventures. And therefore by my will I would have\ndriven him away for jealousy that I had of his life, for it may be\nno young knight's deed that shall enchieve this adventure to the end.\nPardieu, said Sir Launcelot, it is well said, and where ye are called\nthe Damosel Maledisant I will call you the Damosel Bienpensant.\n\nAnd so they rode forth a great while unto they came to the border of the\ncountry of Surluse, and there they found a fair village with a strong\nbridge like a fortress. And when Sir Launcelot and they were at the\nbridge there stert forth afore them of gentlemen and yeomen many, that\nsaid: Fair lords, ye may not pass this bridge and this fortress because\nof that black shield that I see one of you bear, and therefore there\nshall not pass but one of you at once; therefore choose you which of\nyou shall enter within this bridge first. Then Sir Launcelot proffered\nhimself first to enter within this bridge. Sir, said La Cote Male Taile,\nI beseech you let me enter within this fortress, and if I may speed well\nI will send for you, and if it happened that I be slain, there it goeth.\nAnd if so be that I am a prisoner taken, then may ye rescue me. I am\nloath, said Sir Launcelot, to let you pass this passage. Sir, said La\nCote Male Taile, I pray you let me put my body in this adventure. Now go\nyour way, said Sir Launcelot, and Jesu be your speed.\n\nSo he entered, and anon there met with him two brethren, the one hight\nSir Plaine de Force, and the other hight Sir Plaine de Amours. And anon\nthey met with Sir La Cote Male Taile; and first La Cote Male Taile smote\ndown Plaine de Force, and after he smote down Plaine de Amours; and then\nthey dressed them to their shields and swords, and bade La Cote Male\nTaile alight, and so he did; and there was dashing and foining with\nswords, and so they began to assail full hard La Cote Male Taile, and\nmany great wounds they gave him upon his head, and upon his breast,\nand upon his shoulders. And as he might ever among he gave sad strokes\nagain. And then the two brethren traced and traversed for to be of\nboth hands of Sir La Cote Male Taile, but he by fine force and knightly\nprowess gat them afore him. And then when he felt himself so wounded,\nthen he doubled his strokes, and gave them so many wounds that he felled\nthem to the earth, and would have slain them had they not yielded them.\nAnd right so Sir La Cote Male Taile took the best horse that there\nwas of them three, and so rode forth his way to the other fortress\nand bridge; and there he met with the third brother whose name was Sir\nPlenorius, a full noble knight, and there they jousted together, and\neither smote other down, horse and man, to the earth. And then they\navoided their horses, and dressed their shields, and drew their swords,\nand gave many sad strokes, and one while the one knight was afore on the\nbridge, and another while the other. And thus they fought two hours and\nmore, and never rested. And ever Sir Launcelot and the damosel beheld\nthem. Alas, said the damosel, my knight fighteth passing sore and over\nlong. Now may ye see, said Sir Launcelot, that he is a noble knight,\nfor to consider his first battle, and his grievous wounds; and even\nforthwithal so wounded as he is, it is marvel that he may endure this\nlong battle with that good knight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. How La Cote Male Taile was taken prisoner, and after\nrescued by Sir Launcelot, and how Sir Launcelot overcame four brethren.\n\nTHIS meanwhile Sir La Cote Male Taile sank right down upon the earth,\nwhat for-wounded and what for-bled he might not stand. Then the other\nknight had pity of him, and said: Fair young knight, dismay you not,\nfor had ye been fresh when ye met with me, as I was, I wot well that I\nshould not have endured so long as ye have done; and therefore for your\nnoble deeds of arms I shall show to you kindness and gentleness in all\nthat I may. And forthwithal this noble knight, Sir Plenorius, took him\nup in his arms, and led him into his tower. And then he commanded him\nthe wine, and made to search him and to stop his bleeding wounds. Sir,\nsaid La Cote Male Taile, withdraw you from me, and hie you to yonder\nbridge again, for there will meet with you another manner knight than\never was I. Why, said Plenorius, is there another manner knight behind\nof your fellowship? Yea, said La Cote Male Taile, there is a much better\nknight than I am. What is his name? said Plenorius. Ye shall not know\nfor me, said La Cote Male Taile. Well, said the knight, he shall be\nencountered withal whatsomever he be.\n\nThen Sir Plenorius heard a knight call that said: Sir Plenorius, where\nart thou? either thou must deliver me the prisoner that thou hast led\nunto thy tower, or else come and do battle with me. Then Plenorius\ngat his horse, and came with a spear in his hand walloping toward Sir\nLauncelot; and then they began to feutre their spears, and came together\nas thunder, and smote either other so mightily that their horses fell\ndown under them. And then they avoided their horses, and pulled out\ntheir swords, and like two bulls they lashed together with great strokes\nand foins; but ever Sir Launcelot recovered ground upon him, and Sir\nPlenorius traced to have gone about him. But Sir Launcelot would not\nsuffer that, but bare him backer and backer, till he came nigh his tower\ngate. And then said Sir Launcelot: I know thee well for a good knight,\nbut wit thou well thy life and death is in my hand, and therefore yield\nthee to me, and thy prisoner. The other answered no word, but struck\nmightily upon Sir Launcelot's helm, that the fire sprang out of his\neyes. Then Sir Launcelot doubled his strokes so thick, and smote at him\nso mightily, that he made him kneel upon his knees. And therewith Sir\nLauncelot leapt upon him, and pulled him grovelling down. Then Sir\nPlenorius yielded him, and his tower, and all his prisoners at his will.\n\nThen Sir Launcelot received him and took his troth; and then he rode to\nthe other bridge, and there Sir Launcelot jousted with other three of\nhis brethren, the one hight Pillounes, and the other hight Pellogris,\nand the third Sir Pellandris. And first upon horseback Sir Launcelot\nsmote them down, and afterward he beat them on foot, and made them to\nyield them unto him; and then he returned unto Sir Plenorius, and there\nhe found in his prison King Carados of Scotland, and many other knights,\nand all they were delivered. And then Sir La Cote Male Taile came to\nSir Launcelot, and then Sir Launcelot would have given him all these\nfortresses and these bridges. Nay, said La Cote Male Taile, I will not\nhave Sir Plenorius' livelihood; with that he will grant you, my lord Sir\nLauncelot, to come unto King Arthur's court, and to be his knight,\nand all his brethren, I will pray you, my lord, to let him have his\nlivelihood. I will well, said Sir Launcelot, with this that he will come\nto the court of King Arthur and become his man, and his brethren five.\nAnd as for you, Sir Plenorius, I will undertake, said Sir Launcelot, at\nthe next feast, so there be a place voided, that ye shall be Knight of\nthe Round Table. Sir, said Plenorius, at the next feast of Pentecost I\nwill be at Arthur's court, and at that time I will be guided and ruled\nas King Arthur and ye will have me. Then Sir Launcelot and Sir La Cote\nMale Taile reposed them there, unto the time that Sir La Cote Male Taile\nwas whole of his wounds, and there they had merry cheer, and good rest,\nand many good games, and there were many fair ladies.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. How Sir Launcelot made La Cote Male Taile lord of the Castle\nof Pendragon, and after was made knight of the Round Table.\n\nAND in the meanwhile came Sir Kay, the Seneschal, and Sir Brandiles,\nand anon they fellowshipped with them. And then within ten days, then\ndeparted those knights of Arthur's court from these fortresses. And as\nSir Launcelot came by the Castle of Pendragon there he put Sir Brian de\nles Isles from his lands, for cause he would never be withhold with King\nArthur; and all that Castle of Pendragon and all the lands thereof he\ngave to Sir La Cote Male Taile. And then Sir Launcelot sent for Nerovens\nthat he made once knight, and he made him to have all the rule of that\ncastle and of that country, under La Cote Male Taile; and so they rode\nto Arthur's court all wholly together. And at Pentecost next following\nthere was Sir Plenorius and Sir La Cote Male Taile, called otherwise by\nright Sir Breunor le Noire, both made Knights of the Table Round; and\ngreat lands King Arthur gave them, and there Breunor le Noire wedded\nthat damosel Maledisant. And after she was called Beauvivante, but ever\nafter for the more part he was called La Cote Male Taile; and he proved\na passing noble knight, and mighty; and many worshipful deeds he did\nafter in his life; and Sir Plenorius proved a noble knight and full of\nprowess, and all the days of their life for the most part they awaited\nupon Sir Launcelot; and Sir Plenorius' brethren were ever knights of\nKing Arthur. And also, as the French book maketh mention, Sir La Cote\nMale Taile avenged his father's death.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. How La Beale Isoud sent letters to Sir Tristram by her maid\nBragwaine, and of divers adventures of Sir Tristram.\n\nNOW leave we here Sir La Cote Male Taile, and turn we unto Sir Tristram\nde Liones that was in Brittany. When La Beale Isoud understood that he\nwas wedded she sent to him by her maiden Bragwaine as piteous letters\nas could be thought and made, and her conclusion was that, an it pleased\nSir Tristram, that he would come to her court, and bring with him Isoud\nla Blanche Mains, and they should be kept as well as she herself. Then\nSir Tristram called unto him Sir Kehydius, and asked him whether he\nwould go with him into Cornwall secretly. He answered him that he was\nready at all times. And then he let ordain privily a little vessel,\nand therein they went, Sir Tristram, Kehydius, Dame Bragwaine, and\nGouvernail, Sir Tristram's squire. So when they were in the sea a\ncontrarious wind blew them on the coasts of North Wales, nigh the Castle\nPerilous. Then said Sir Tristram: Here shall ye abide me these ten days,\nand Gouvernail, my squire, with you. And if so be I come not again by\nthat day take the next way into Cornwall; for in this forest are many\nstrange adventures, as I have heard say, and some of them I cast me to\nprove or I depart. And when I may I shall hie me after you.\n\nThen Sir Tristram and Kehydius took their horses and departed from their\nfellowship. And so they rode within that forest a mile and more; and at\nthe last Sir Tristram saw afore him a likely knight, armed, sitting by\na well, and a strong mighty horse passing nigh him tied to an oak, and\na man hoving and riding by him leading an horse laden with spears. And\nthis knight that sat at the well seemed by his countenance to be passing\nheavy. Then Sir Tristram rode near him and said: Fair knight, why sit ye\nso drooping? ye seem to be a knight-errant by your arms and harness, and\ntherefore dress you to joust with one of us, or with both. Therewithal\nthat knight made no words, but took his shield and buckled it about his\nneck, and lightly he took his horse and leapt upon him. And then he\ntook a great spear of his squire, and departed his way a furlong. Sir\nKehydius asked leave of Sir Tristram to joust first. Do your best, said\nSir Tristram. So they met together, and there Sir Kehydius had a fall,\nand was sore wounded on high above the paps. Then Sir Tristram said:\nKnight, that is well jousted, now make you ready unto me. I am ready,\nsaid the knight. And then that knight took a greater spear in his hand,\nand encountered with Sir Tristram, and there by great force that knight\nsmote down Sir Tristram from his horse and had a great fall. Then Sir\nTristram was sore ashamed, and lightly he avoided his horse, and put\nhis shield afore his shoulder, and drew his sword. And then Sir Tristram\nrequired that knight of his knighthood to alight upon foot and fight\nwith him. I will well, said the knight; and so he alighted upon foot,\nand avoided his horse, and cast his shield upon his shoulder, and drew\nhis sword, and there they fought a long battle together full nigh two\nhours. Then Sir Tristram said: Fair knight, hold thine hand, and tell me\nof whence thou art, and what is thy name. As for that, said the knight,\nI will be avised; but an thou wilt tell me thy name peradventure I will\ntell thee mine.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. How Sir Tristram met with Sir Lamorak de Galis, and how they\nfought, and after accorded never to fight together.\n\nNOW fair knight, he said, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones. Sir, said\nthe other knight, and my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. Ah, Sir Lamorak,\nsaid Sir Tristram, well be we met, and bethink thee now of the despite\nthou didst me of the sending of the horn unto King Mark's court, to the\nintent to have slain or dishonoured my lady the queen, La Beale Isoud;\nand therefore wit thou well, said Sir Tristram, the one of us shall die\nor we depart. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, remember that we were together in\nthe Isle of Servage, and at that time ye promised me great friendship.\nThen Sir Tristram would make no longer delays, but lashed at Sir\nLamorak; and thus they fought long till either were weary of other. Then\nSir Tristram said to Sir Lamorak: In all my life met I never with such\na knight that was so big and well breathed as ye be, therefore, said Sir\nTristram, it were pity that any of us both should here be mischieved.\nSir said Sir Lamorak, for your renown and name I will that ye have the\nworship of this battle, and therefore I will yield me unto you. And\ntherewith he took the point of his sword to yield him. Nay, said Sir\nTristram, ye shall not do so, for well I know your proffers, and more\nof your gentleness than for any fear or dread ye have of me. And\ntherewithal Sir Tristram proffered him his sword and said: Sir Lamorak,\nas an overcome knight I yield me unto you as to a man of the most noble\nprowess that ever I met withal. Nay, said Sir Lamorak, I will do you\ngentleness; I require you let us be sworn together that never none of us\nshall after this day have ado with other. And therewithal Sir Tristram\nand Sir Lamorak sware that never none of them should fight against\nother, nor for weal nor for woe.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII. How Sir Palomides followed the Questing Beast, and smote\ndown Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak with one spear.\n\nAND this meanwhile there came Sir Palomides, the good knight, following\nthe Questing Beast that had in shape a head like a serpent's head, and a\nbody like a leopard, buttocks like a lion, and footed like an hart; and\nin his body there was such a noise as it had been the noise of thirty\ncouple of hounds questing, and such a noise that beast made wheresomever\nhe went; and this beast ever more Sir Palomides followed, for it was\ncalled his quest. And right so as he followed this beast it came by Sir\nTristram, and soon after came Palomides. And to brief this matter he\nsmote down Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak both with one spear; and so he\ndeparted after the beast Galtisant, that was called the Questing Beast;\nwherefore these two knights were passing wroth that Sir Palomides would\nnot fight on foot with them. Here men may understand that be of worship,\nthat he was never formed that all times might stand, but sometime he was\nput to the worse by mal-fortune; and at sometime the worse knight put\nthe better knight to a rebuke.\n\nThen Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak gat Sir Kehydius upon a shield betwixt\nthem both, and led him to a forester's lodge, and there they gave him\nin charge to keep him well, and with him they abode three days. Then the\ntwo knights took their horses and at the cross they departed. And then\nsaid Sir Tristram to Sir Lamorak: I require you if ye hap to meet with\nSir Palomides, say him that he shall find me at the same well where I\nmet him, and there I, Sir Tristram, shall prove whether he be better\nknight than I. And so either departed from other a sundry way, and Sir\nTristram rode nigh thereas was Sir Kehydius; and Sir Lamorak rode until\nhe came to a chapel, and there he put his horse unto pasture. And anon\nthere came Sir Meliagaunce, that was King Bagdemagus' son, and he there\nput his horse to pasture, and was not ware of Sir Lamorak; and then this\nknight Sir Meliagaunce made his moan of the love that he had to Queen\nGuenever, and there he made a woful complaint. All this heard Sir\nLamorak, and on the morn Sir Lamorak took his horse and rode unto the\nforest, and there he met with two knights hoving under the wood-shaw.\nFair knights, said Sir Lamorak, what do ye hoving here and watching? and\nif ye be knights-errant that will joust, lo I am ready. Nay, sir knight,\nthey said, not so, we abide not here to joust with you, but we lie here\nin await of a knight that slew our brother. What knight was that, said\nSir Lamorak, that you would fain meet withal? Sir, they said, it is Sir\nLauncelot that slew our brother, and if ever we may meet with him\nhe shall not escape, but we shall slay him. Ye take upon you a great\ncharge, said Sir Lamorak, for Sir Launcelot is a noble proved knight. As\nfor that we doubt not, for there nis none of us but we are good enough\nfor him. I will not believe that, said Sir Lamorak, for I heard never\nyet of no knight the days of my life but Sir Launcelot was too big for\nhim.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII. How Sir Lamorak met with Sir Meliagaunce, and fought\ntogether for the beauty of Dame Guenever.\n\nRIGHT so as they stood talking thus Sir Lamorak was ware how Sir\nLauncelot came riding straight toward them; then Sir Lamorak saluted\nhim, and he him again. And then Sir Lamorak asked Sir Launcelot if there\nwere anything that he might do for him in these marches. Nay, said\nSir Launcelot, not at this time I thank you. Then either departed from\nother, and Sir Lamorak rode again thereas he left the two knights, and\nthen he found them hid in the leaved wood. Fie on you, said Sir Lamorak,\nfalse cowards, pity and shame it is that any of you should take the high\norder of knighthood. So Sir Lamorak departed from them, and within a\nwhile he met with Sir Meliagaunce. And then Sir Lamorak asked him why he\nloved Queen Guenever as he did: For I was not far from you when ye made\nyour complaint by the chapel. Did ye so? said Sir Meliagaunce, then will\nI abide by it: I love Queen Guenever, what will ye with it? I will prove\nand make good that she is the fairest lady and most of beauty in the\nworld. As to that, said Sir Lamorak, I say nay thereto, for Queen\nMorgawse of Orkney, mother to Sir Gawaine, and his mother is the\nfairest queen and lady that beareth the life. That is not so, said Sir\nMeliagaunce, and that will I prove with my hands upon thy body. Will ye\nso? said Sir Lamorak, and in a better quarrel keep I not to fight.\nThen they departed either from other in great wrath. And then they came\nriding together as it had been thunder, and either smote other so sore\nthat their horses fell backward to the earth. And then they avoided\ntheir horses, and dressed their shields, and drew their swords. And then\nthey hurtled together as wild boars, and thus they fought a great while.\nFor Meliagaunce was a good man and of great might, but Sir Lamorak was\nhard big for him, and put him always aback, but either had wounded other\nsore.\n\nAnd as they stood thus fighting, by fortune came Sir Launcelot and Sir\nBleoberis riding. And then Sir Launcelot rode betwixt them, and asked\nthem for what cause they fought so together: And ye are both knights of\nKing Arthur!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV. How Sir Meliagaunce told for what cause they fought, and\nhow Sir Lamorak jousted with King Arthur.\n\nSIR, said Meliagaunce, I shall tell you for what cause we do this\nbattle. I praised my lady, Queen Guenever, and said she was the fairest\nlady of the world, and Sir Lamorak said nay thereto, for he said Queen\nMorgawse of Orkney was fairer than she and more of beauty. Ah, Sir\nLamorak, why sayest thou so? it is not thy part to dispraise thy\nprincess that thou art under her obeissance, and we all. And therewith\nhe alighted on foot, and said: For this quarrel, make thee ready, for I\nwill prove upon thee that Queen Guenever is the fairest lady and most of\nbounty in the world. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, I am loath to have ado with\nyou in this quarrel, for every man thinketh his own lady fairest; and\nthough I praise the lady that I love most ye should not be wroth; for\nthough my lady Queen Guenever, be fairest in your eye, wit ye well Queen\nMorgawse of Orkney is fairest in mine eye, and so every knight thinketh\nhis own lady fairest; and wit ye well, sir, ye are the man in the world\nexcept Sir Tristram that I am most loathest to have ado withal, but, an\nye will needs fight with me I shall endure you as long as I may. Then\nspake Sir Bleoberis and said: My lord Sir Launcelot, I wist you never\nso misadvised as ye are now, for Sir Lamorak sayeth you but reason and\nknightly; for I warn you I have a lady, and methinketh that she is the\nfairest lady of the world. Were this a great reason that ye should be\nwroth with me for such language? And well ye wot, that Sir Lamorak is as\nnoble a knight as I know, and he hath ought you and us ever good will,\nand therefore I pray you be good friends. Then Sir Launcelot said\nunto Sir Lamorak. I pray you forgive me mine evil will, and if I was\nmisadvised I will amend it. Sir, said Sir Lamorak, the amends is\nsoon made betwixt you and me. And so Sir Launcelot and Sir Bleoberis\ndeparted, and Sir Meliagaunce and Sir Lamorak took their horses, and\neither departed from other.\n\nAnd within a while came King Arthur, and met with Sir Lamorak, and\njousted with him; and there he smote down Sir Lamorak, and wounded him\nsore with a spear, and so he rode from him; wherefore Sir Lamorak was\nwroth that he would not fight with him on foot, howbeit that Sir Lamorak\nknew not King Arthur.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV. How Sir Kay met with Sir Tristram, and after of the shame\nspoken of the knights of Cornwall, and how they jousted.\n\nNOW leave we of this tale, and speak we of Sir Tristram, that as he rode\nhe met with Sir Kay, the Seneschal; and there Sir Kay asked Sir Tristram\nof what country he was. He answered that he was of the country of\nCornwall. It may well be, said Sir Kay, for yet heard I never that\never good knight came out of Cornwall. That is evil spoken, said Sir\nTristram, but an it please you to tell me your name I require you. Sir,\nwit ye well, said Sir Kay, that my name is Sir Kay, the Seneschal. Is\nthat your name? said Sir Tristram, now wit ye well that ye are named the\nshamefullest knight of your tongue that now is living; howbeit ye\nare called a good knight, but ye are called unfortunate, and passing\noverthwart of your tongue. And thus they rode together till they came\nto a bridge. And there was a knight would not let them pass till one\nof them jousted with him; and so that knight jousted with Sir Kay,\nand there that knight gave Sir Kay a fall: his name was Sir Tor, Sir\nLamorak's half-brother. And then they two rode to their lodging, and\nthere they found Sir Brandiles, and Sir Tor came thither anon after. And\nas they sat at supper these four knights, three of them spake all shame\nby Cornish knights. Sir Tristram heard all that they said and he said\nbut little, but he thought the more, but at that time he discovered not\nhis name.\n\nUpon the morn Sir Tristram took his horse and abode them upon their way.\nAnd there Sir Brandiles proffered to joust with Sir Tristram, and Sir\nTristram smote him down, horse and all, to the earth. Then Sir Tor le\nFise de Vayshoure encountered with Sir Tristram and there Sir Tristram\nsmote him down, and then he rode his way, and Sir Kay followed him, but\nhe would not of his fellowship. Then Sir Brandiles came to Sir Kay and\nsaid: I would wit fain what is that knight's name. Come on with me,\nsaid Sir Kay, and we shall pray him to tell us his name. So they rode\ntogether till they came nigh him, and then they were ware where he sat\nby a well, and had put off his helm to drink at the well. And when he\nsaw them come he laced on his helm lightly, and took his horse, and\nproffered them to joust. Nay, said Sir Brandiles, we jousted late enough\nwith you, we come not in that intent. But for this we come to require\nyou of knighthood to tell us your name. My fair knights, sithen that\nis your desire, and to please you, ye shall wit that my name is Sir\nTristram de Liones, nephew unto King Mark of Cornwall. In good time,\nsaid Sir Brandiles, and well be ye found, and wit ye well that we be\nright glad that we have found you, and we be of a fellowship that would\nbe right glad of your company. For ye are the knight in the world\nthat the noble fellowship of the Round Table most desireth to have the\ncompany of. God thank them said Sir Tristram, of their great goodness,\nbut as yet I feel well that I am unable to be of their fellowship, for I\nwas never yet of such deeds of worthiness to be in the company of such\na fellowship. Ah, said Sir Kay, an ye be Sir Tristram de Liones, ye are\nthe man called now most of prowess except Sir Launcelot du Lake; for he\nbeareth not the life, Christian nor heathen, that can find such another\nknight, to speak of his prowess, and of his hands, and his truth withal.\nFor yet could there never creature say of him dishonour and make it\ngood. Thus they talked a great while, and then they departed either from\nother such ways as them seemed best.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI. How King Arthur was brought into the Forest Perilous, and\nhow Sir Tristram saved his life.\n\nNOW shall ye hear what was the cause that King Arthur came into the\nForest Perilous, that was in North Wales, by the means of a lady. Her\nname was Annowre, and this lady came to King Arthur at Cardiff; and she\nby fair promise and fair behests made King Arthur to ride with her into\nthat Forest Perilous; and she was a great sorceress; and many days she\nhad loved King Arthur, and because she would have him to lie by her she\ncame into that country. So when the king was gone with her many of\nhis knights followed after King Arthur when they missed him, as Sir\nLauncelot, Brandiles, and many other; and when she had brought him to\nher tower she desired him to lie by her; and then the king remembered\nhim of his lady, and would not lie by her for no craft that she could\ndo. Then every day she would make him ride into that forest with his own\nknights, to the intent to have had King Arthur slain. For when this Lady\nAnnowre saw that she might not have him at her will, then she laboured\nby false means to have destroyed King Arthur, and slain.\n\nThen the Lady of the Lake that was alway friendly to King Arthur,\nshe understood by her subtle crafts that King Arthur was like to be\ndestroyed. And therefore this Lady of the Lake, that hight Nimue, came\ninto that forest to seek after Sir Launcelot du Lake or Sir Tristram for\nto help King Arthur; foras that same day this Lady of the Lake knew\nwell that King Arthur should be slain, unless that he had help of one of\nthese two knights. And thus she rode up and down till she met with Sir\nTristram, and anon as she saw him she knew him. O my lord Sir Tristram,\nshe said, well be ye met, and blessed be the time that I have met with\nyou; for this same day, and within these two hours, shall be done the\nfoulest deed that ever was done in this land. O fair damosel, said Sir\nTristram, may I amend it. Come on with me, she said, and that in all\nthe haste ye may, for ye shall see the most worshipfullest knight of the\nworld hard bestead. Then said Sir Tristram: I am ready to help such a\nnoble man. He is neither better nor worse, said the Lady of the Lake,\nbut the noble King Arthur himself. God defend, said Sir Tristram, that\never he should be in such distress. Then they rode together a great\npace, until they came to a little turret or castle; and underneath that\ncastle they saw a knight standing upon foot fighting with two knights;\nand so Sir Tristram beheld them, and at the last the two knights smote\ndown the one knight, and that one of them unlaced his helm to have slain\nhim. And the Lady Annowre gat King Arthur's sword in her hand to have\nstricken off his head. And therewithal came Sir Tristram with all his\nmight, crying: Traitress, traitress, leave that. And anon there Sir\nTristram smote the one of the knights through the body that he fell\ndead; and then he rashed to the other and smote his back asunder; and\nin the meanwhile the Lady of the Lake cried to King Arthur: Let not\nthat false lady escape. Then King Arthur overtook her, and with the same\nsword he smote off her head, and the Lady of the Lake took up her head\nand hung it up by the hair of her saddle-bow. And then Sir Tristram\nhorsed King Arthur and rode forth with him, but he charged the Lady of\nthe Lake not to discover his name as at that time.\n\n\nWhen the king was horsed he thanked heartily Sir Tristram, and desired\nto wit his name; but he would not tell him, but that he was a poor\nknight adventurous; and so he bare King Arthur fellowship till he met\nwith some of his knights. And within a while he met with Sir Ector de\nMaris, and he knew not King Arthur nor Sir Tristram, and he desired to\njoust with one of them. Then Sir Tristram rode unto Sir Ector, and smote\nhim from his horse. And when he had done so he came again to the king\nand said: My lord, yonder is one of your knights, he may bare you\nfellowship, and another day that deed that I have done for you I trust\nto God ye shall understand that I would do you service. Alas, said King\nArthur, let me wit what ye are? Not at this time, said Sir Tristram. So\nhe departed and left King Arthur and Sir Ector together.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII. How Sir Tristram came to La Beale Isoud, and how Kehydius\nbegan to love Beale Isoud, and of a letter that Tristram found.\n\nAND then at a day set Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak met at the well; and\nthen they took Kehydius at the forester's house, and so they rode with\nhim to the ship where they left Dame Bragwaine and Gouvernail, and\nso they sailed into Cornwall all wholly together. And by assent and\ninformation of Dame Bragwaine when they were landed they rode unto Sir\nDinas, the Seneschal, a trusty friend of Sir Tristram's. And so Dame\nBragwaine and Sir Dinas rode to the court of King Mark, and told the\nqueen, La Beale Isoud, that Sir Tristram was nigh her in that country.\nThen for very pure joy La Beale Isoud swooned; and when she might speak\nshe said: Gentle knight Seneschal, help that I might speak with him,\nouther my heart will brast. Then Sir Dinas and Dame Bragwaine brought\nSir Tristram and Kehydius privily unto the court, unto a chamber whereas\nLa Beale Isoud had assigned it; and to tell the joys that were betwixt\nLa Beale Isoud and Sir Tristram, there is no tongue can tell it, nor\nheart think it, nor pen write it. And as the French book maketh mention,\nat the first time that ever Sir Kehydius saw La Beale Isoud he was so\nenamoured upon her that for very pure love he might never withdraw it.\nAnd at the last, as ye shall hear or the book be ended, Sir Kehydius\ndied for the love of La Beale Isoud. And then privily he wrote unto her\nletters and ballads of the most goodliest that were used in those days.\nAnd when La Beale Isoud understood his letters she had pity of his\ncomplaint, and unavised she wrote another letter to comfort him withal.\n\nAnd Sir Tristram was all this while in a turret at the commandment of La\nBeale Isoud, and when she might she came unto Sir Tristram. So on a day\nKing Mark played at the chess under a chamber window; and at that time\nSir Tristram and Sir Kehydius were within the chamber over King Mark,\nand as it mishapped Sir Tristram found the letter that Kehydius sent\nunto La Beale Isoud, also he had found the letter that she wrote unto\nKehydius, and at that same time La Beale Isoud was in the same chamber.\nThen Sir Tristram came unto La Beale Isoud and said: Madam, here is a\nletter that was sent unto you, and here is the letter that ye sent unto\nhim that sent you that letter. Alas, Madam, the good love that I have\nloved you; and many lands and riches have I forsaken for your love, and\nnow ye are a traitress to me, the which doth me great pain. But as for\nthee, Sir Kehydius, I brought thee out of Brittany into this country,\nand thy father, King Howel, I won his lands, howbeit I wedded thy sister\nIsoud la Blanche Mains for the goodness she did unto me. And yet, as\nI am true knight, she is a clean maiden for me; but wit thou well,\nSir Kehydius, for this falsehood and treason thou hast done me, I will\nrevenge it upon thee. And therewithal Sir Tristram drew out his sword\nand said: Sir Kehydius, keep thee, and then La Beale Isoud swooned to\nthe earth. And when Sir Kehydius saw Sir Tristram come upon him he saw\nnone other boot, but leapt out at a bay-window even over the head where\nsat King Mark playing at the chess. And when the king saw one come\nhurling over his head he said: Fellow, what art thou, and what is the\ncause thou leapest out at that window? My lord the king, said Kehydius,\nit fortuned me that I was asleep in the window above your head, and as\nI slept I slumbered, and so I fell down. And thus Sir Kehydius excused\nhim.\n\n\n\nCHAP TER XVIII. How Sir Tristram departed from Tintagil, and how he\nsorrowed and was so long in a forest till he was out of his mind.\n\nTHEN Sir Tristram dread sore lest he were discovered unto the king that\nhe was there; wherefore he drew him to the strength of the Tower, and\narmed him in such armour as he had for to fight with them that would\nwithstand him. And so when Sir Tristram saw there was no resistance\nagainst him he sent Gouvernail for his horse and his spear, and knightly\nhe rode forth out of the castle openly, that was called the Castle of\nTintagil. And even at gate he met with Gingalin, Sir Gawaine's son. And\nanon Sir Gingalin put his spear in his rest, and ran upon Sir Tristram\nand brake his spear; and Sir Tristram at that time had but a sword, and\ngave him such a buffet upon the helm that he fell down from his saddle,\nand his sword slid adown, and carved asunder his horse's neck. And so\nSir Tristram rode his way into the forest, and all this doing saw King\nMark. And then he sent a squire unto the hurt knight, and commanded him\nto come to him, and so he did. And when King Mark wist that it was\nSir Gingalin he welcomed him and gave him an horse, and asked him what\nknight it was that had encountered with him. Sir, said Gingalin, I wot\nnot what knight he was, but well I wot that he sigheth and maketh great\ndole.\n\nThen Sir Tristram within a while met with a knight of his own, that\nhight Sir Fergus. And when he had met with him he made great sorrow,\ninsomuch that he fell down off his horse in a swoon, and in such sorrow\nhe was in three days and three nights. Then at the last Sir Tristram\nsent unto the court by Sir Fergus, for to spere what tidings. And so as\nhe rode by the way he met with a damosel that came from Sir Palomides,\nto know and seek how Sir Tristram did. Then Sir Fergus told her how he\nwas almost out of his mind. Alas, said the damosel, where shall I find\nhim? In such a place, said Sir Fergus. Then Sir Fergus found Queen Isoud\nsick in her bed, making the greatest dole that ever any earthly woman\nmade. And when the damosel found Sir Tristram she made great dole\nbecause she might not amend him, for the more she made of him the more\nwas his pain. And at the last Sir Tristram took his horse and rode away\nfrom her. And then was it three days or that she could find him, and\nthen she brought him meat and drink, but he would none; and then another\ntime Sir Tristram escaped away from the damosel, and it happed him to\nride by the same castle where Sir Palomides and Sir Tristram did battle\nwhen La Beale Isoud departed them. And there by fortune the damosel\nmet with Sir Tristram again, making the greatest dole that ever earthly\ncreature made; and she yede to the lady of that castle and told her of\nthe misadventure of Sir Tristram. Alas, said the lady of that castle,\nwhere is my lord, Sir Tristram? Right here by your castle, said the\ndamosel. In good time, said the lady, is he so nigh me; he shall have\nmeat and drink of the best; and an harp I have of his whereupon he\ntaught me, for of goodly harping he beareth the prize in the world.\nSo this lady and damosel brought him meat and drink, but he ate little\nthereof. Then upon a night he put his horse from him, and then he\nunlaced his armour, and then Sir Tristram would go into the wilderness,\nand brast down the trees and boughs; and otherwhile when he found the\nharp that the lady sent him, then would he harp, and play thereupon and\nweep together. And sometime when Sir Tristram was in the wood that the\nlady wist not where he was, then would she sit her down and play upon\nthat harp: then would Sir Tristram come to that harp, and hearken\nthereto, and sometime he would harp himself. Thus he there endured a\nquarter of a year. Then at the last he ran his way, and she wist not\nwhere he was become. And then was he naked and waxed lean and poor of\nflesh; and so he fell in the fellowship of herdmen and shepherds, and\ndaily they would give him some of their meat and drink. And when he did\nany shrewd deed they would beat him with rods, and so they clipped him\nwith shears and made him like a fool.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX. How Sir Tristram soused Dagonet in a well, and how\nPalomides sent a damosel to seek Tristram, and how Palomides met with\nKing Mark.\n\nAND upon a day Dagonet, King Arthur's fool, came into Cornwall with two\nsquires with him; and as they rode through that forest they came by a\nfair well where Sir Tristram was wont to be; and the weather was hot,\nand they alighted to drink of that well, and in the meanwhile their\nhorses brake loose. Right so Sir Tristram came unto them, and first\nhe soused Sir Dagonet in that well, and after his squires, and thereat\nlaughed the shepherds; and forthwithal he ran after their horses and\nbrought them again one by one, and right so, wet as they were, he made\nthem leap up and ride their ways. Thus Sir Tristram endured there an\nhalf year naked, and would never come in town nor village. The meanwhile\nthe damosel that Sir Palomides sent to seek Sir Tristram, she yede unto\nSir Palomides and told him all the mischief that Sir Tristram endured.\nAlas, said Sir Palomides, it is great pity that ever so noble a knight\nshould be so mischieved for the love of a lady; but nevertheless, I will\ngo and seek him, and comfort him an I may. Then a little before that\ntime La Beale Isoud had commanded Sir Kehydius out of the country\nof Cornwall. So Sir Kehydius departed with a dolorous heart, and by\nadventure he met with Sir Palomides, and they enfellowshipped together;\nand either complained to other of their hot love that they loved La\nBeale Isoud. Now let us, said Sir Palomides, seek Sir Tristram, that\nloved her as well as we, and let us prove whether we may recover him. So\nthey rode into that forest, and three days and three nights they would\nnever take their lodging, but ever sought Sir Tristram.\n\nAnd upon a time, by adventure, they met with King Mark that was ridden\nfrom his men all alone. When they saw him Sir Palomides knew him, but\nSir Kehydius knew him not. Ah, false king, said Sir Palomides, it is\npity thou hast thy life, for thou art a destroyer of all worshipful\nknights, and by thy mischief and thy vengeance thou hast destroyed that\nmost noble knight, Sir Tristram de Liones. And therefore defend thee,\nsaid Sir Palomides, for thou shalt die this day. That were shame, said\nKing Mark, for ye two are armed and I am unarmed. As for that, said Sir\nPalomides, I shall find a remedy therefore; here is a knight with me,\nand thou shalt have his harness. Nay, said King Mark, I will not have\nado with you, for cause have ye none to me; for all the misease that Sir\nTristram hath was for a letter that he found; for as to me I did to\nhim no displeasure, and God knoweth I am full sorry for his disease and\nmalady. So when the king had thus excused him they were friends, and\nKing Mark would have had them unto Tintagil; but Sir Palomides would\nnot, but turned unto the realm of Logris, and Sir Kehydius said that he\nwould go into Brittany.\n\nNow turn we unto Sir Dagonet again, that when he and his squires were\nupon horseback he deemed that the shepherds had sent that fool to array\nthem so, because that they laughed at them, and so they rode unto the\nkeepers of beasts and all to-beat them. Sir Tristram saw them beat that\nwere wont to give him meat and drink, then he ran thither and gat Sir\nDagonet by the head, and gave him such a fall to the earth that he\nbruised him sore so that he lay still. And then he wrast his sword out\nof his hand, and therewith he ran to one of his squires and smote off\nhis head, and the other fled. And so Sir Tristram took his way with that\nsword in his hand, running as he had been wild wood. Then Sir Dagonet\nrode to King Mark and told him how he had sped in that forest. And\ntherefore, said Sir Dagonet, beware, King Mark, that thou come not about\nthat well in the forest, for there is a fool naked, and that fool and I\nfool met together, and he had almost slain me. Ah, said King Mark, that\nis Sir Matto le Breune, that fell out of his wit because he lost his\nlady; for when Sir Gaheris smote down Sir Matto and won his lady of him,\nnever since was he in his mind, and that was pity, for he was a good\nknight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX. How it was noised how Sir Tristram was dead, and how La\nBeale Isoud would have slain herself.\n\nTHEN Sir Andred, that was cousin unto Sir Tristram, made a lady that was\nhis paramour to say and to noise it that she was with Sir Tristram or\never he died. And this tale she brought unto King Mark's court, that she\nburied him by a well, and that or he died he besought King Mark to make\nhis cousin, Sir Andred, king of the country of Liones, of the which Sir\nTristram was lord of. All this did Sir Andred because he would have had\nSir Tristram's lands. And when King Mark heard tell that Sir Tristram\nwas dead he wept and made great dole. But when Queen Isoud heard of\nthese tidings she made such sorrow that she was nigh out of her mind;\nand so upon a day she thought to slay herself and never to live after\nSir Tristram's death. And so upon a day La Beale Isoud gat a sword\nprivily and bare it to her garden, and there she pight the sword through\na plum tree up to the hilt, so that it stuck fast, and it stood breast\nhigh. And as she would have run upon the sword and to have slain herself\nall this espied King Mark, how she kneeled down and said: Sweet Lord\nJesu, have mercy upon me, for I may not live after the death of Sir\nTristram de Liones, for he was my first love and he shall be the last.\nAnd with these words came King Mark and took her in his arms, and then\nhe took up the sword, and bare her away with him into a tower; and there\nhe made her to be kept, and watched her surely, and after that she lay\nlong sick, nigh at the point of death.\n\nThis meanwhile ran Sir Tristram naked in the forest with the sword in\nhis hand, and so he came to an hermitage, and there he laid him down and\nslept; and in the meanwhile the hermit stole away his sword, and laid\nmeat down by him. Thus was he kept there ten days; and at the last he\ndeparted and came to the herdmen again. And there was a giant in that\ncountry that hight Tauleas, and for fear of Sir Tristram more than seven\nyear he durst never much go at large, but for the most part he kept him\nin a sure castle of his own; and so this Tauleas heard tell that Sir\nTristram was dead, by the noise of the court of King Mark. Then this\nTauleas went daily at large. And so he happed upon a day he came to the\nherdmen wandering and langering, and there he set him down to rest among\nthem. The meanwhile there came a knight of Cornwall that led a lady with\nhim, and his name was Sir Dinant; and when the giant saw him he went\nfrom the herdmen and hid him under a tree, and so the knight came to\nthat well, and there he alighted to repose him. And as soon as he was\nfrom his horse this giant Tauleas came betwixt this knight and his\nhorse, and took the horse and leapt upon him. So forthwith he rode unto\nSir Dinant and took him by the collar, and pulled him afore him upon his\nhorse, and there would have stricken off his head. Then the herdmen said\nunto Sir Tristram: Help yonder knight. Help ye him, said Sir Tristram.\nWe dare not, said the herdmen. Then Sir Tristram was ware of the sword\nof the knight thereas it lay; and so thither he ran and took up the\nsword and struck off Sir Tauleas' head, and so he yede his way to the\nherdmen.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI. How King Mark found Sir Tristram naked, and made him to be\nborne home to Tintagil, and how he was there known by a brachet.\n\nTHEN the knight took up the giant's head and bare it with him unto King\nMark, and told him what adventure betid him in the forest, and how a\nnaked man rescued him from the grimly giant, Tauleas. Where had ye\nthis adventure? said King Mark. Forsooth, said Sir Dinant, at the fair\nfountain in your forest where many adventurous knights meet, and there\nis the mad man. Well, said King Mark, I will see that wild man. So\nwithin a day or two King Mark commanded his knights and his hunters that\nthey should be ready on the morn for to hunt, and so upon the morn he\nwent unto that forest. And when the king came to that well he found\nthere lying by that well a fair naked man, and a sword by him. Then King\nMark blew and straked, and therewith his knights came to him; and then\nthe king commanded his knights to: Take that naked man with fairness,\nand bring him to my castle. So they did softly and fair, and cast\nmantles upon Sir Tristram, and so led him unto Tintagil; and there they\nbathed him, and washed him, and gave him hot suppings till they had\nbrought him well to his remembrance; but all this while there was no\ncreature that knew Sir Tristram, nor what man he was.\n\nSo it fell upon a day that the queen, La Beale Isoud, heard of such a\nman, that ran naked in the forest, and how the king had brought him home\nto the court. Then La Beale Isoud called unto her Dame Bragwaine and\nsaid: Come on with me, for we will go see this man that my lord brought\nfrom the forest the last day. So they passed forth, and spered where was\nthe sick man. And then a squire told the queen that he was in the garden\ntaking his rest, and reposing him against the sun. So when the queen\nlooked upon Sir Tristram she was not remembered of him. But ever she\nsaid unto Dame Bragwaine: Meseemeth I should have seen him heretofore\nin many places. But as soon as Sir Tristram saw her he knew her well\nenough. And then he turned away his visage and wept.\n\nThen the queen had always a little brachet with her that Sir Tristram\ngave her the first time that ever she came into Cornwall, and never\nwould that brachet depart from her but if Sir Tristram was nigh thereas\nwas La Beale Isoud; and this brachet was sent from the king's daughter\nof France unto Sir Tristram for great love. And anon as this little\nbrachet felt a savour of Sir Tristram, she leapt upon him and licked his\nlears and his ears, and then she whined and quested, and she smelled at\nhis feet and at his hands, and on all parts of his body that she might\ncome to. Ah, my lady, said Dame Bragwaine unto La Beale Isoud, alas,\nalas, said she, I see it is mine own lord, Sir Tristram. And thereupon\nIsoud fell down in a swoon, and so lay a great while And when she might\nspeak she said: My lord Sir Tristram, blessed be God ye have your life,\nand now I am sure ye shall be discovered by this little brachet, for she\nwill never leave you. And also I am sure as soon as my lord, King Mark,\ndo know you he will banish you out of the country of Cornwall, or else\nhe will destroy you; for God's sake, mine own lord, grant King Mark his\nwill, and then draw you unto the court of King Arthur, for there are ye\nbeloved, and ever when I may I shall send unto you; and when ye list\nye may come to me, and at all times early and late I will be at your\ncommandment, to live as poor a life as ever did queen or lady. O Madam,\nsaid Sir Tristram, go from me, for mickle anger and danger have I\nescaped for your love.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII. How King Mark, by the advice of his council, banished Sir\nTristram out of Cornwall the term of ten years.\n\nTHEN the queen departed, but the brachet would not from him; and\ntherewithal came King Mark, and the brachet set upon him, and bayed\nat them all. There withal Sir Andred spake and said: Sir, this is Sir\nTristram, I see by the brachet. Nay, said the king, I cannot suppose\nthat. Then the king asked him upon his faith what he was, and what was\nhis name. So God me help, said he, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones;\nnow do by me what ye list. Ah, said King Mark, me repenteth of your\nrecovery. And then he let call his barons to judge Sir Tristram to the\ndeath. Then many of his barons would not assent thereto, and in especial\nSir Dinas, the Seneschal, and Sir Fergus. And so by the advice of them\nall Sir Tristram was banished out of the country for ten year, and\nthereupon he took his oath upon a book before the king and his barons.\nAnd so he was made to depart out of the country of Cornwall; and there\nwere many barons brought him unto his ship, of the which some were his\nfriends and some his foes. And in the meanwhile there came a knight\nof King Arthur's, his name was Dinadan, and his coming was for to seek\nafter Sir Tristram; then they showed him where he was armed at all\npoints going to the ship. Now fair knight, said Sir Dinadan, or ye pass\nthis court that ye will joust with me I require thee. With a good will,\nsaid Sir Tristram, an these lords will give me leave. Then the barons\ngranted thereto, and so they ran together, and there Sir Tristram gave\nSir Dinadan a fall. And then he prayed Sir Tristram to give him leave to\ngo in his fellowship. Ye shall be right welcome, said then Sir Tristram.\n\nAnd so they took their horses and rode to their ships together, and when\nSir Tristram was in the sea he said: Greet well King Mark and all\nmine enemies, and say them I will come again when I may; and well am\nI rewarded for the fighting with Sir Marhaus, and delivered all this\ncountry from servage; and well am I rewarded for the fetching and costs\nof Queen Isoud out of Ireland, and the danger that I was in first and\nlast, and by the way coming home what danger I had to bring again Queen\nIsoud from the Castle Pluere; and well am I rewarded when I fought with\nSir Bleoberis for Sir Segwarides' wife; and well am I rewarded when I\nfought with Sir Blamore de Ganis for King Anguish, father unto La Beale\nIsoud; and well am I rewarded when I smote down the good knight, Sir\nLamorak de Galis, at King Mark's request; and well am I rewarded when\nI fought with the King with the Hundred Knights, and the King of\nNorthgalis, and both these would have put his land in servage, and by\nme they were put to a rebuke; and well am I rewarded for the slaying of\nTauleas, the mighty giant, and many other deeds have I done for him, and\nnow have I my warison. And tell King Mark that many noble knights of the\nTable Round have spared the barons of this country for my sake. Also am\nI not well rewarded when I fought with the good knight Sir Palomides and\nrescued Queen Isoud from him; and at that time King Mark said afore all\nhis barons I should have been better rewarded. And forthwithal he took\nthe sea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII. How a damosel sought help to help Sir Launcelot against\nthirty knights, and how Sir Tristram fought with them.\n\nAND at the next landing, fast by the sea, there met with Sir Tristram\nand with Sir Dinadan, Sir Ector de Maris and Sir Bors de Ganis; and\nthere Sir Ector jousted with Sir Dinadan, and he smote him and his horse\ndown. And then Sir Tristram would have jousted with Sir Bors, and Sir\nBors said that he would not joust with no Cornish knights, for they are\nnot called men of worship; and all this was done upon a bridge. And with\nthis came Sir Bleoberis and Sir Driant, and Sir Bleoberis proffered\nto joust with Sir Tristram, and there Sir Tristram smote down Sir\nBleoberis. Then said Sir Bors de Ganis: I wist never Cornish knight of\nso great valour nor so valiant as that knight that beareth the trappings\nembroidered with crowns. And then Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan departed\nfrom them into a forest, and there met them a damosel that came for the\nlove of Sir Launcelot to seek after some noble knights of King Arthur's\ncourt for to rescue Sir Launcelot. And so Sir Launcelot was ordained,\nfor-by the treason of Queen Morgan le Fay to have slain Sir Launcelot,\nand for that cause she ordained thirty knights to lie in await for Sir\nLauncelot, and this damosel knew this treason. And for this cause the\ndamosel came for to seek noble knights to help Sir Launcelot. For that\nnight, or the day after, Sir Launcelot should come where these thirty\nknights were. And so this damosel met with Sir Bors and Sir Ector and\nwith Sir Driant, and there she told them all four of the treason of\nMorgan le Fay; and then they promised her that they would be nigh where\nSir Launcelot should meet with the thirty knights. And if so be they set\nupon him we will do rescues as we can.\n\nSo the damosel departed, and by adventure the damosel met with Sir\nTristram and with Sir Dinadan, and there the damosel told them all the\ntreason that was ordained for Sir Launcelot. Fair damosel, said Sir\nTristram, bring me to that same place where they should meet with Sir\nLauncelot. Then said Sir Dinadan: What will ye do? it is not for us to\nfight with thirty knights, and wit you well I will not thereof; as to\nmatch one knight two or three is enough an they be men, but for to match\nfifteen knights that will I never undertake. Fie for shame, said Sir\nTristram, do but your part. Nay, said Sir Dinadan, I will not thereof\nbut if ye will lend me your shield, for ye bear a shield of Cornwall;\nand for the cowardice that is named to the knights of Cornwall, by your\nshields ye be ever forborne. Nay, said Sir Tristram, I will not depart\nfrom my shield for her sake that gave it me. But one thing, said Sir\nTristram, I promise thee, Sir Dinadan, but if thou wilt promise me to\nabide with me, here I shall slay thee, for I desire no more of thee but\nanswer one knight. And if thy heart will not serve thee, stand by and\nlook upon me and them. Sir, said Sir Dinadan, I promise you to look upon\nand to do what I may to save myself, but I would I had not met with you.\n\nSo then anon these thirty knights came fast by these four knights, and\nthey were ware of them, and either of other. And so these thirty knights\nlet them pass, for this cause, that they would not wrath them, if case\nbe that they had ado with Sir Launcelot; and the four knights let them\npass to this intent, that they would see and behold what they would do\nwith Sir Launcelot. And so the thirty knights passed on and came by Sir\nTristram and by Sir Dinadan, and then Sir Tristram cried on high: Lo,\nhere is a knight against you for the love of Sir Launcelot. And there\nhe slew two with one spear and ten with his sword. And then came in Sir\nDinadan and he did passing well, and so of the thirty knights there went\nbut ten away, and they fled. All this battle saw Sir Bors de Ganis and\nhis three fellows, and then they saw well it was the same knight that\njousted with them at the bridge; then they took their horses and rode\nunto Sir Tristram, and praised him and thanked him of his good deeds,\nand they all desired Sir Tristram to go with them to their lodging; and\nhe said: Nay, he would not go to no lodging. Then they all four knights\nprayed him to tell them his name. Fair lords, said Sir Tristram, as at\nthis time I will not tell you my name.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV. How Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan came to a lodging where\nthey must joust with two knights.\n\nTHEN Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode forth their way till they came to\nthe shepherds and to the herdmen, and there they asked them if they\nknew any lodging or harbour there nigh hand. Forsooth, sirs, said the\nherdmen, hereby is good lodging in a castle; but there is such a\ncustom that there shall no knight be harboured but if he joust with two\nknights, and if he be but one knight he must joust with two. And as ye\nbe therein soon shall ye be matched. There is shrewd harbour, said Sir\nDinadan; lodge where ye will, for I will not lodge there. Fie for shame,\nsaid Sir Tristram, are ye not a knight of the Table Round? wherefore ye\nmay not with your worship refuse your lodging. Not so, said the herdmen,\nfor an ye be beaten and have the worse ye shall not be lodged there, and\nif ye beat them ye shall be well harboured. Ah, said Sir Dinadan, they\nare two sure knights. Then Sir Dinadan would not lodge there in no\nmanner but as Sir Tristram required him of his knighthood; and so they\nrode thither. And to make short tale, Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan smote\nthem down both, and so they entered into the castle and had good cheer\nas they could think or devise.\n\nAnd when they were unarmed, and thought to be merry and in good rest,\nthere came in at the gates Sir Palomides and Sir Gaheris, requiring to\nhave the custom of the castle. What array is this? said Sir Dinadan,\nI would have my rest. That may not be, said Sir Tristram; now must we\nneeds defend the custom of this castle, insomuch as we have the better\nof the lords of this castle, and therefore, said Sir Tristram, needs\nmust ye make you ready. In the devil's name, said Sir Dinadan, came\nI into your company. And so they made them ready; and Sir Gaheris\nencountered with Sir Tristram, and Sir Gaheris had a fall; and Sir\nPalomides encountered with Sir Dinadan, and Sir Dinadan had a fall: then\nwas it fall for fall. So then must they fight on foot. That would not\nSir Dinadan, for he was so sore bruised of the fall that Sir Palomides\ngave him. Then Sir Tristram unlaced Sir Dinadan's helm, and prayed him\nto help him. I will not, said Sir Dinadan, for I am sore wounded of the\nthirty knights that we had but late ago to do withal. But ye fare, said\nSir Dinadan unto Sir Tristram, as a madman and as a man that is out of\nhis mind that would cast himself away, and I may curse the time that\never I saw you, for in all the world are not two such knights that be\nso wood as is Sir Launcelot and ye Sir Tristram; for once I fell in the\nfellowship of Sir Launcelot as I have done now with you, and he set me\na work that a quarter of a year I kept my bed. Jesu defend me, said\nSir Dinadan, from such two knights, and specially from your fellowship.\nThen, said Sir Tristram, I will fight with them both. Then Sir Tristram\nbade them come forth both, for I will fight with you. Then Sir Palomides\nand Sir Gaheris dressed them, and smote at them both. Then Dinadan\nsmote at Sir Gaheris a stroke or two, and turned from him. Nay, said Sir\nPalomides, it is too much shame for us two knights to fight with one.\nAnd then he did bid Sir Gaheris stand aside with that knight that hath\nno list to fight. Then they rode together and fought long, and at the\nlast Sir Tristram doubled his strokes, and drove Sir Palomides aback\nmore than three strides. And then by one assent Sir Gaheris and Sir\nDinadan went betwixt them, and departed them in-sunder. And then by\nassent of Sir Tristram they would have lodged together. But Sir Dinadan\nwould not lodge in that castle. And then he cursed the time that ever he\ncame in their fellowship, and so he took his horse, and his harness, and\ndeparted.\n\nThen Sir Tristram prayed the lords of that castle to lend him a man to\nbring him to a lodging, and so they did, and overtook Sir Dinadan, and\nrode to their lodging two mile thence with a good man in a priory,\nand there they were well at ease. And that same night Sir Bors and Sir\nBleoberis, and Sir Ector and Sir Driant, abode still in the same place\nthereas Sir Tristram fought with the thirty knights; and there they met\nwith Sir Launcelot the same night, and had made promise to lodge with\nSir Colgrevance the same night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV. How Sir Tristram jousted with Sir Kay and Sir Sagramore le\nDesirous, and how Sir Gawaine turned Sir Tristram from Morgan le Fay.\n\nBUT anon as the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, heard of the shield of\nCornwall, then wist he well that it was Sir Tristram that fought with\nhis enemies. And then Sir Launcelot praised Sir Tristram, and called\nhim the man of most worship in the world. So there was a knight in\nthat priory that hight Pellinore, and he desired to wit the name of Sir\nTristram, but in no wise he could not; and so Sir Tristram departed and\nleft Sir Dinadan in the priory, for he was so weary and so sore bruised\nthat he might not ride. Then this knight, Sir Pellinore, said to Sir\nDinadan: Sithen that ye will not tell me that knight's name I will ride\nafter him and make him to tell me his name, or he shall die therefore.\nBeware, sir knight, said Sir Dinadan, for an ye follow him ye shall\nrepent it. So that knight, Sir Pellinore, rode after Sir Tristram and\nrequired him of jousts. Then Sir Tristram smote him down and wounded him\nthrough the shoulder, and so he passed on his way. And on the next day\nfollowing Sir Tristram met with pursuivants, and they told him that\nthere was made a great cry of tournament between King Carados of\nScotland and the King of North Wales, and either should joust against\nother at the Castle of Maidens; and these pursuivants sought all the\ncountry after the good knights, and in especial King Carados let make\nseeking for Sir Launcelot du Lake, and the King of Northgalis let seek\nafter Sir Tristram de Liones. And at that time Sir Tristram thought\nto be at that jousts; and so by adventure they met with Sir Kay, the\nSeneschal, and Sir Sagramore le Desirous; and Sir Kay required Sir\nTristram to joust, and Sir Tristram in a manner refused him, because he\nwould not be hurt nor bruised against the great jousts that should be\nbefore the Castle of Maidens, and therefore thought to repose him and\nto rest him. And alway Sir Kay cried: Sir knight of Cornwall, joust with\nme, or else yield thee to me as recreant. When Sir Tristram heard him\nsay so he turned to him, and then Sir Kay refused him and turned his\nback. Then Sir Tristram said: As I find thee I shall take thee. Then Sir\nKay turned with evil will, and Sir Tristram smote Sir Kay down, and so\nhe rode forth.\n\nThen Sir Sagramore le Desirous rode after Sir Tristram, and made him\nto joust with him, and there Sir Tristram smote down Sir Sagramore le\nDesirous from his horse, and rode his way; and the same day he met with\na damosel that told him that he should win great worship of a knight\nadventurous that did much harm in all that country. When Sir Tristram\nheard her say so, he was glad to go with her to win worship. So Sir\nTristram rode with that damosel a six mile, and then met him Sir\nGawaine, and therewithal Sir Gawaine knew the damosel, that she was a\ndamosel of Queen Morgan le Fay. Then Sir Gawaine understood that she\nled that knight to some mischief. Fair knight, said Sir Gawaine, whither\nride you now with that damosel? Sir, said Sir Tristram, I wot not\nwhither I shall ride but as the damosel will lead me. Sir, said Sir\nGawaine, ye shall not ride with her, for she and her lady did never\ngood, but ill. And then Sir Gawaine pulled out his sword and said:\nDamosel, but if thou tell me anon for what cause thou leadest this\nknight with thee thou shalt die for it right anon: I know all your\nlady's treason, and yours. Mercy, Sir Gawaine, she said, and if ye will\nsave my life I will tell you. Say on, said Sir Gawaine, and thou\nshalt have thy life. Sir, she said, Queen Morgan le Fay, my lady, hath\nordained a thirty ladies to seek and espy after Sir Launcelot or Sir\nTristram, and by the trains of these ladies, who that may first meet any\nof these two knights they should turn them unto Morgan le Fay's castle,\nsaying that they should do deeds of worship; and if any of the two\nknights came there, there be thirty knights lying and watching in a\ntower to wait upon Sir Launcelot or upon Sir Tristram. Fie for shame,\nsaid Sir Gawaine, that ever such false treason should be wrought or used\nin a queen, and a king's sister, and a king and queen's daughter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI. How Sir Tristram and Sir Gawaine rode to have foughten\nwith the thirty knights, but they durst not come out.\n\nSIR, said Sir Gawaine, will ye stand with me, and we will see the malice\nof these thirty knights. Sir, said Sir Tristram, go ye to them, an it\nplease you, and ye shall see I will not fail you, for it is not long ago\nsince I and a fellow met with thirty knights of that queen's fellowship;\nand God speed us so that we may win worship. So then Sir Gawaine and Sir\nTristram rode toward the castle where Morgan le Fay was, and ever Sir\nGawaine deemed well that he was Sir Tristram de Liones, because he heard\nthat two knights had slain and beaten thirty knights. And when they came\nafore the castle Sir Gawaine spake on high and said: Queen Morgan\nle Fay, send out your knights that ye have laid in a watch for Sir\nLauncelot and for Sir Tristram. Now, said Sir Gawaine, I know your false\ntreason, and through all places where that I ride men shall know of your\nfalse treason; and now let see, said Sir Gawaine, whether ye dare come\nout of your castle, ye thirty knights. Then the queen spake and all the\nthirty knights at once, and said: Sir Gawaine, full well wottest thou\nwhat thou dost and sayest; for by God we know thee passing well, but\nall that thou speakest and dost, thou sayest it upon pride of that good\nknight that is there with thee. For there be some of us that know full\nwell the hands of that knight over all well. And wit thou well, Sir\nGawaine, it is more for his sake than for thine that we will not come\nout of this castle. For wit ye well, Sir Gawaine, the knight that\nbeareth the arms of Cornwall, we know him and what he is.\n\nThen Sir Gawaine and Sir Tristram departed and rode on their ways a day\nor two together; and there by adventure, they met with Sir Kay and Sir\nSagramore le Desirous. And then they were glad of Sir Gawaine, and he of\nthem, but they wist not what he was with the shield of Cornwall, but by\ndeeming. And thus they rode together a day or two. And then they were\nware of Sir Breuse Saunce Pite chasing a lady for to have slain her, for\nhe had slain her paramour afore. Hold you all still, said Sir Gawaine,\nand show none of you forth, and ye shall see me reward yonder false\nknight; for an he espy you he is so well horsed that he will escape\naway. And then Sir Gawaine rode betwixt Sir Breuse and the lady, and\nsaid: False knight, leave her, and have ado with me. When Sir Breuse saw\nno more but Sir Gawaine he feutred his spear, and Sir Gawaine against\nhim; and there Sir Breuse overthrew Sir Gawaine, and then he rode over\nhim, and overthwart him twenty times to have destroyed him; and when Sir\nTristram saw him do so villainous a deed, he hurled out against him.\nAnd when Sir Breuse saw him with the shield of Cornwall he knew him well\nthat it was Sir Tristram, and then he fled, and Sir Tristram followed\nafter him; and Sir Breuse Saunce Pite was so horsed that he went his way\nquite, and Sir Tristram followed him long, for he would fain have been\navenged upon him. And so when he had long chased him, he saw a fair\nwell, and thither he rode to repose him, and tied his horse till a tree.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII. How damosel Bragwaine found Tristram sleeping by a well,\nand how she delivered letters to him from La Beale Isoud.\n\nAND then he pulled off his helm and washed his visage and his hands, and\nso he fell asleep. In the meanwhile came a damosel that had sought Sir\nTristram many ways and days within this land. And when she came to the\nwell she looked upon him, and had forgotten him as in remembrance of Sir\nTristram, but by his horse she knew him, that hight Passe-Brewel that\nhad been Sir Tristram's horse many years. For when he was mad in the\nforest Sir Fergus kept him. So this lady, Dame Bragwaine, abode still\ntill he was awake. So when she saw him wake she saluted him, and he her\nagain, for either knew other of old acquaintance; then she told him how\nshe had sought him long and broad, and there she told him how she had\nletters from Queen La Beale Isoud. Then anon Sir Tristram read them, and\nwit ye well he was glad, for therein was many a piteous complaint.\nThen Sir Tristram said: Lady Bragwaine, ye shall ride with me till that\ntournament be done at the Castle of Maidens, and then shall bear letters\nand tidings with you. And then Sir Tristram took his horse and sought\nlodging, and there he met with a good ancient knight and prayed him to\nlodge with him. Right so came Gouvernail unto Sir Tristram, that was\nglad of that lady. So this old knight's name was Sir Pellounes, and he\ntold of the great tournament that should be at the Castle of Maidens.\nAnd there Sir Launcelot and thirty-two knights of his blood had ordained\nshields of Cornwall. And right so there came one unto Sir Pellounes,\nand told him that Sir Persides de Bloise was come home; then that knight\nheld up his hands and thanked God of his coming home. And there Sir\nPellounes told Sir Tristram that in two years he had not seen his son,\nSir Persides. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I know your son well enough for a\ngood knight.\n\n\nSo on a time Sir Tristram and Sir Persides came to their lodging both\nat once, and so they unarmed them, and put upon them their clothing.\nAnd then these two knights each welcomed other. And when Sir Persides\nunderstood that Sir Tristram was of Cornwall, he said he was once in\nCornwall: And there I jousted afore King Mark; and so it happed me at\nthat time to overthrow ten knights, and then came to me Sir Tristram de\nLiones and overthrew me, and took my lady away from me, and that shall\nI never forget, but I shall remember me an ever I see my time. Ah, said\nSir Tristram, now I understand that ye hate Sir Tristram. What deem ye,\nween ye that Sir Tristram is not able to withstand your malice? Yes,\nsaid Sir Persides, I know well that Sir Tristram is a noble knight and\na much better knight than I, yet shall I not owe him my good will. Right\nas they stood thus talking at a bay-window of that castle, they saw\nmany knights riding to and fro toward the tournament. And then was Sir\nTristram ware of a likely knight riding upon a great black horse, and a\nblack-covered shield. What knight is that, said Sir Tristram, with the\nblack horse and the black shield? he seemeth a good knight. I know him\nwell, said Sir Persides, he is one of the best knights of the world.\nThen is it Sir Launcelot, said Tristram. Nay, said Sir Persides, it is\nSir Palomides, that is yet unchristened.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII. How Sir Tristram had a fall with Sir Palomides, and how\nLauncelot overthrew two knights.\n\nTHEN they saw much people of the country salute Sir Palomides. And\nwithin a while after there came a squire of the castle, that told Sir\nPellounes that was lord of that castle, that a knight with a black\nshield had smitten down thirteen knights. Fair brother, said Sir\nTristram unto Sir Persides, let us cast upon us cloaks, and let us go\nsee the play. Not so, said Sir Persides, we will not go like knaves\nthither, but we will ride like men and good knights to withstand our\nenemies. So they armed them, and took their horses and great spears,\nand thither they went thereas many knights assayed themself before the\ntournament. And anon Sir Palomides saw Sir Persides, and then he sent\na squire unto him and said: Go thou to the yonder knight with the green\nshield and therein a lion of gold, and say him I require him to joust\nwith me, and tell him that my name is Sir Palomides. When Sir Persides\nunderstood that request of Sir Palomides, he made him ready, and there\nanon they met together, but Sir Persides had a fall. Then Sir Tristram\ndressed him to be revenged upon Sir Palomides, and that saw Sir\nPalomides that was ready and so was not Sir Tristram, and took him at\nan advantage and smote him over his horse's tail when he had no spear in\nhis rest. Then stert up Sir Tristram and took his horse lightly, and was\nwroth out of measure, and sore ashamed of that fall. Then Sir Tristram\nsent unto Sir Palomides by Gouvernail, and prayed him to joust with\nhim at his request. Nay, said Sir Palomides, as at this time I will not\njoust with that knight, for I know him better than he weeneth. And if he\nbe wroth he may right it to-morn at the Castle of Maidens, where he may\nsee me and many other knights.\n\nWith that came Sir Dinadan, and when he saw Sir Tristram wroth he list\nnot to jape. Lo, said Sir Dinadan, here may a man prove, be a man never\nso good yet may he have a fall, and he was never so wise but he might\nbe overseen, and he rideth well that never fell. So Sir Tristram was\npassing wroth, and said to Sir Persides and to Sir Dinadan: I will\nrevenge me. Right so as they stood talking there, there came by Sir\nTristram a likely knight riding passing soberly and heavily with a black\nshield. What knight is that? said Sir Tristram unto Sir Persides. I know\nhim well, said Sir Persides, for his name is Sir Briant of North Wales;\nso he passed on among other knights of North Wales. And there came in\nSir Launcelot du Lake with a shield of the arms of Cornwall, and he sent\na squire unto Sir Briant, and required him to joust with him. Well,\nsaid Sir Briant, sithen I am required to joust I will do what I may; and\nthere Sir Launcelot smote down Sir Briant from his horse a great fall.\nAnd then Sir Tristram marvelled what knight he was that bare the shield\nof Cornwall. Whatsoever he be, said Sir Dinadan, I warrant you he is of\nKing Ban's blood, the which be knights of the most noble prowess in the\nworld, for to account so many for so many. Then there came two knights\nof Northgalis, that one hight Hew de la Montaine, and the other Sir\nMadok de la Montaine, and they challenged Sir Launcelot foot-hot. Sir\nLauncelot not refusing them but made him ready, with one spear he smote\nthem down both over their horses' croups; and so Sir Launcelot rode\nhis way. By the good lord, said Sir Tristram, he is a good knight that\nbeareth the shield of Cornwall, and meseemeth he rideth in the best\nmanner that ever I saw knight ride.\n\nThen the King of Northgalis rode unto Sir Palomides and prayed him\nheartily for his sake to joust with that knight that hath done us of\nNorthgalis despite. Sir, said Sir Palomides, I am full loath to have ado\nwith that knight, and cause why is, for as to-morn the great tournament\nshall be; and therefore I will keep myself fresh by my will. Nay, said\nthe King of Northgalis, I pray you require him of jousts. Sir, said\nSir Palomides, I will joust at your request, and require that knight\nto joust with me, and often I have seen a man have a fall at his own\nrequest.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX. How Sir Launcelot jousted with Palomides and overthrew\nhim, and after he was assailed with twelve knights.\n\nTHEN Sir Palomides sent unto Sir Launcelot a squire, and required him of\njousts. Fair fellow, said Sir Launcelot, tell me thy lord's name. Sir,\nsaid the squire, my lord's name is Sir Palomides, the good knight. In\ngood hour, said Sir Launcelot, for there is no knight that I saw this\nseven years that I had liefer ado withal than with him. And so either\nknights made them ready with two great spears. Nay, said Sir Dinadan,\nye shall see that Sir Palomides will quit him right well. It may be\nso, said Sir Tristram, but I undertake that knight with the shield of\nCornwall shall give him a fall. I believe it not, said Sir Dinadan.\nRight so they spurred their horses and feutred their spears, and either\nhit other, and Sir Palomides brake a spear upon Sir Launcelot, and he\nsat and moved not; but Sir Launcelot smote him so lightly that he made\nhis horse to avoid the saddle, and the stroke brake his shield and the\nhauberk, and had he not fallen he had been slain. How now, said Sir\nTristram, I wist well by the manner of their riding both that Sir\nPalomides should have a fall.\n\nRight so Sir Launcelot rode his way, and rode to a well to drink and to\nrepose him, and they of Northgalis espied him whither he rode; and then\nthere followed him twelve knights for to have mischieved him, for this\ncause that upon the morn at the tournament of the Castle of Maidens that\nhe should not win the victory. So they came upon Sir Launcelot suddenly,\nand unnethe he might put upon him his helm and take his horse, but they\nwere in hands with him; and then Sir Launcelot gat his spear, and rode\nthrough them, and there he slew a knight and brake a spear in his body.\nThen he drew his sword and smote upon the right hand and upon the left\nhand, so that within a few strokes he had slain other three knights, and\nthe remnant that abode he wounded them sore all that did abide. Thus\nSir Launcelot escaped from his enemies of North Wales, and then Sir\nLauncelot rode his way till a friend, and lodged him till on the morn;\nfor he would not the first day have ado in the tournament because of his\ngreat labour. And on the first day he was with King Arthur thereas he\nwas set on high upon a scaffold to discern who was best worthy of his\ndeeds. So Sir Launcelot was with King Arthur, and jousted not the first\nday.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX. How Sir Tristram behaved him the first day of the\ntournament, and there he had the prize.\n\nNOW turn we unto Sir Tristram de Liones, that commanded Gouvernail,\nhis servant, to ordain him a black shield with none other remembrance\ntherein. And so Sir Persides and Sir Tristram departed from their host\nSir Pellounes, and they rode early toward the tournament, and then they\ndrew them to King Carados' side, of Scotland; and anon knights began the\nfield what of King Northgalis' part, and what of King Carados' part, and\nthere began great party. Then there was hurling and rashing. Right so\ncame in Sir Persides and Sir Tristram and so they did fare that they put\nthe King of Northgalis aback. Then came in Sir Bleoberis de Ganis and\nSir Gaheris with them of Northgalis, and then was Sir Persides smitten\ndown and almost slain, for more than forty horse men went over him. For\nSir Bleoberis did great deeds of arms, and Sir Gaheris failed him not.\nWhen Sir Tristram beheld them, and saw them do such deeds of arms,\nhe marvelled what they were. Also Sir Tristram thought shame that Sir\nPersides was so done to; and then he gat a great spear in his hand, and\nthen he rode to Sir Gaheris and smote him down from his horse. And then\nwas Sir Bleoberis wroth, and gat a spear and rode against Sir Tristram\nin great ire; and there Sir Tristram met with him, and smote Sir\nBleoberis from his horse So then the King with the Hundred Knights was\nwroth, and he horsed Sir Bleoberis and Sir Gaheris again, and there\nbegan a great medley; and ever Sir Tristram held them passing short, and\never Sir Bleoberis was passing busy upon Sir Tristram; and there came\nSir Dinadan against Sir Tristram, and Sir Tristram gave him such a\nbuffet that he swooned in his saddle. Then anon Sir Dinadan came to Sir\nTristram and said: Sir, I know thee better than thou weenest; but here I\npromise thee my troth I will never come against thee more, for I promise\nthee that sword of thine shall never come on mine helm.\n\nWith that came Sir Bleoberis, and Sir Tristram gave him such a buffet\nthat down he laid his head; and then he caught him so sore by the helm\nthat he pulled him under his horse's feet. And then King Arthur blew\nto lodging. Then Sir Tristram departed to his pavilion, and Sir Dinadan\nrode with him; and Sir Persides and King Arthur then, and the kings upon\nboth parties, marvelled what knight that was with the black shield. Many\nsaid their advice, and some knew him for Sir Tristram, and held their\npeace and would nought say. So that first day King Arthur, and all the\nkings and lords that were judges, gave Sir Tristram the prize; howbeit\nthey knew him not, but named him the Knight with the Black Shield.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI. How Sir Tristram returned against King Arthur's party\nbecause he saw Sir Palomides on that party.\n\nTHEN upon the morn Sir Palomides returned from the King of Northgalis,\nand rode to King Arthur's side, where was King Carados, and the King\nof Ireland, and Sir Launcelot's kin, and Sir Gawaine's kin. So Sir\nPalomides sent the damosel unto Sir Tristram that he sent to seek him\nwhen he was out of his mind in the forest, and this damosel asked\nSir Tristram what he was and what was his name? As for that, said Sir\nTristram, tell Sir Palomides ye shall not wit as at this time unto the\ntime I have broken two spears upon him. But let him wit thus much,\nsaid Sir Tristram, that I am the same knight that he smote down in\nover-evening[*10] at the tournament; and tell him plainly on what party\nthat Sir Palomides be I will be of the contrary party. Sir, said the\ndamosel, ye shall understand that Sir Palomides will be on King Arthur's\nside, where the most noble knights of the world be. In the name of God,\nsaid Sir Tristram, then will I be with the King of Northgalis, because\nSir Palomides will be on King Arthur's side, and else I would not but\nfor his sake. So when King Arthur was come they blew unto the field;\nand then there began a great party, and so King Carados jousted with the\nKing of the Hundred Knights, and there King Carados had a fall: then\nwas there hurling and rushing, and right so came in knights of King\nArthur's, and they bare aback the King of Northgalis' knights.\n\n\n[*10] \"the evening afore,\" W. de W.\n\n\nThen Sir Tristram came in, and began so roughly and so bigly that there\nwas none might withstand him, and thus Sir Tristram dured long. And at\nthe last Sir Tristram fell among the fellowship of King Ban, and there\nfell upon him Sir Bors de Ganis, and Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir Blamore\nde Ganis, and many other knights. And then Sir Tristram smote on the\nright hand and on the left hand, that all lords and ladies spake of his\nnoble deeds. But at the last Sir Tristram should have had the worse had\nnot the King with the Hundred Knights been. And then he came with his\nfellowship and rescued Sir Tristram, and brought him away from those\nknights that bare the shields of Cornwall. And then Sir Tristram saw\nanother fellowship by themself, and there were a forty knights together,\nand Sir Kay, the Seneschal, was their governor. Then Sir Tristram rode\nin amongst them, and there he smote down Sir Kay from his horse; and\nthere he fared among those knights like a greyhound among conies.\n\nThen Sir Launcelot found a knight that was sore wounded upon the head.\nSir, said Sir Launcelot, who wounded you so sore? Sir, he said, a knight\nthat beareth a black shield, and I may curse the time that ever I met\nwith him, for he is a devil and no man. So Sir Launcelot departed from\nhim and thought to meet with Sir Tristram, and so he rode with his sword\ndrawn in his hand to seek Sir Tristram; and then he espied him how he\nhurled here and there, and at every stroke Sir Tristram wellnigh smote\ndown a knight. O mercy Jesu! said the king, sith the times I bare arms\nsaw I never no knight do so marvellous deeds of arms. And if I should\nset upon this knight, said Sir Launcelot to himself, I did shame to\nmyself, and therewithal Sir Launcelot put up his sword. And then the\nKing with the Hundred Knights and an hundred more of North Wales set\nupon the twenty of Sir Launcelot's kin: and they twenty knights held\nthem ever together as wild swine, and none would fail other. And so when\nSir Tristram beheld the noblesse or these twenty knights he marvelled of\ntheir good deeds, for he saw by their fare and by their rule that they\nhad liefer die than avoid the field. Now Jesu, said Sir Tristram, well\nmay he be valiant and full of prowess that hath such a sort of noble\nknights unto his kin, and full like is he to be a noble man that is\ntheir leader and governor. He meant it by Sir Launcelot du Lake. So when\nSir Tristram had beholden them long he thought shame to see two hundred\nknights battering upon twenty knights. Then Sir Tristram rode unto the\nKing with the Hundred Knights and said: Sir, leave your fighting with\nthose twenty knights, for ye win no worship of them, ye be so many and\nthey so few; and wit ye well they will not out of the field I see by\ntheir cheer and countenance; and worship get ye none an ye slay them.\nTherefore leave your fighting with them, for I to increase my worship\nI will ride to the twenty knights and help them with all my might and\npower. Nay, said the King with the Hundred Knights, ye shall not do so;\nnow I see your courage and courtesy I will withdraw my knights for your\npleasure, for evermore a good knight will favour another, and like will\ndraw to like.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII. How Sir Tristram found Palomides by a well, and brought\nhim with him to his lodging.\n\nTHEN the King with the Hundred Knights withdrew his knights. And\nall this while, and long to-fore, Sir Launcelot had watched upon Sir\nTristram with a very purpose to have fellowshipped with him. And then\nsuddenly Sir Tristram, Sir Dinadan, and Gouvernail, his man, rode their\nway into the forest, that no man perceived where they went. So then\nKing Arthur blew unto lodging, and gave the King of Northgalis the prize\nbecause Sir Tristram was upon his side. Then Sir Launcelot rode here\nand there, so wood as lion that fauted his fill, because he had lost Sir\nTristram, and so he returned unto King Arthur. And then in all the field\nwas a noise that with the wind it might be heard two mile thence, how\nthe lords and ladies cried: The Knight with the Black Shield hath won\nthe field. Alas, said King Arthur, where is that knight become? It is\nshame to all those in the field so to let him escape away from you; but\nwith gentleness and courtesy ye might have brought him unto me to the\nCastle of Maidens. Then the noble King Arthur went unto his knights\nand comforted them in the best wise that he could, and said: My fair\nfellows, be not dismayed, howbeit ye have lost the field this day. And\nmany were hurt and sore wounded, and many were whole. My fellows, said\nKing Arthur, look that ye be of good cheer, for to-morn I will be in\nthe field with you and revenge you of your enemies. So that night King\nArthur and his knights reposed themself.\n\nThe damosel that came from La Beale Isoud unto Sir Tristram, all the\nwhile the tournament was a-doing she was with Queen Guenever, and ever\nthe queen asked her for what cause she came into that country. Madam,\nshe answered, I come for none other cause but from my lady La Beale\nIsoud to wit of your welfare. For in no wise she would not tell\nthe queen that she came for Sir Tristram's sake. So this lady, Dame\nBragwaine, took her leave of Queen Guenever, and she rode after Sir\nTristram. And as she rode through the forest she heard a great cry;\nthen she commanded her squire to go into the forest to wit what was that\nnoise. And so he came to a well, and there he found a knight bounden\ntill a tree crying as he had been wood, and his horse and his harness\nstanding by him. And when he espied that squire, therewith he abraid\nand brake himself loose, and took his sword in his hand, and ran to have\nslain the squire. Then he took his horse and fled all that ever he might\nunto Dame Bragwaine, and told her of his adventure. Then she rode unto\nSir Tristram's pavilion, and told Sir Tristram what adventure she had\nfound in the forest. Alas, said Sir Tristram, upon my head there is some\ngood knight at mischief.\n\nThen Sir Tristram took his horse and his sword and rode thither, and\nthere he heard how the knight complained unto himself and said: I,\nwoful knight Sir Palomides, what misadventure befalleth me, that thus\nam defoiled with falsehood and treason, through Sir Bors and Sir Ector.\nAlas, he said, why live I so long! And then he gat his sword in his\nhands, and made many strange signs and tokens; and so through his raging\nhe threw his sword into that fountain. Then Sir Palomides wailed and\nwrang his hands. And at the last for pure sorrow he ran into that\nfountain, over his belly, and sought after his sword. Then Sir Tristram\nsaw that, and ran upon Sir Palomides, and held him in his arms fast.\nWhat art thou, said Palomides, that holdeth me so? I am a man of this\nforest that would thee none harm. Alas, said Sir Palomides, I may never\nwin worship where Sir Tristram is; for ever where he is an I be there,\nthen get I no worship; and if he be away for the most part I have\nthe gree, unless that Sir Launcelot be there or Sir Lamorak. Then Sir\nPalomides said: Once in Ireland Sir Tristram put me to the worse, and\nanother time in Cornwall, and in other places in this land. What would\nye do, said Sir Tristram, an ye had Sir Tristram? I would fight with\nhim, said Sir Palomides, and ease my heart upon him; and yet, to say\nthee sooth, Sir Tristram is the gentlest knight in this world living.\nWhat will ye do, said Sir Tristram, will ye go with me to your lodging?\nNay, said he, I will go to the King with the Hundred Knights, for he\nrescued me from Sir Bors de Ganis and Sir Ector and else had I been\nslain traitorly. Sir Tristram said him such kind words that Sir\nPalomides went with him to his lodging. Then Gouvernail went to-fore,\nand charged Dame Bragwaine to go out of the way to her lodging And bid\nye Sir Persides that he make him no quarrels. And so they rode together\ntill they came to Sir Tristram's pavilion, and there Sir Palomides\nhad all the cheer that might be had all that night. But in no wise Sir\nPalomides might not know what was Sir Tristram; and so after supper they\nyede to rest, and Sir Tristram for great travail slept till it was day.\nAnd Sir Palomides might not sleep for anguish; and in the dawning of\nthe day he took his horse privily, and rode his way unto Sir Gaheris and\nunto Sir Sagramore le Desirous, where they were in their pavilions; for\nthey three were fellows at the beginning of the tournament. And then\nupon the morn the king blew unto the tournament upon the third day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII. How Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palomides, and how he\njousted with King Arthur, and other feats.\n\nSO the King of Northgalis and the King with the Hundred Knights, they\ntwo encountered with King Carados and with the King of Ireland; and\nthere the King with the Hundred Knights smote down King Carados, and the\nKing of Northgalis smote down the King of Ireland. With that came in\nSir Palomides, and when he came he made great work, for by his indented\nshield he was well known. So came in King Arthur, and did great deeds\nof arms together, and put the King of Northgalis and the King with the\nHundred Knights to the worse. With this came in Sir Tristram with his\nblack shield, and anon he jousted with Sir Palomides, and there by fine\nforce Sir Tristram smote Sir Palomides over his horse's croup. Then King\nArthur cried: Knight with the Black Shield, make thee ready to me, and\nin the same wise Sir Tristram smote King Arthur. And then by force of\nKing Arthur's knights the King and Sir Palomides were horsed again. Then\nKing Arthur with a great eager heart he gat a spear in his hand, and\nthere upon the one side he smote Sir Tristram over his horse. Then\nfoot-hot Sir Palomides came upon Sir Tristram, as he was upon foot, to\nhave overridden him. Then Sir Tristram was ware of him, and there he\nstooped aside, and with great ire he gat him by the arm, and pulled him\ndown from his horse. Then Sir Palomides lightly arose, and then they\ndashed together mightily with their swords; and many kings, queens, and\nlords, stood and beheld them. And at the last Sir Tristram smote Sir\nPalomides upon the helm three mighty strokes, and at every stroke\nthat he gave him he said: This for Sir Tristram's sake. With that Sir\nPalomides fell to the earth grovelling.\n\nThen came the King with the Hundred Knights, and brought Sir Tristram an\nhorse, and so was he horsed again. By then was Sir Palomides horsed, and\nwith great ire he jousted upon Sir Tristram with his spear as it was in\nthe rest, and gave him a great dash with his sword. Then Sir Tristram\navoided his spear, and gat him by the neck with his both hands, and\npulled him clean out of his saddle, and so he bare him afore him the\nlength of ten spears, and then in the presence of them all he let him\nfall at his adventure. Then Sir Tristram was ware of King Arthur with a\nnaked sword in his hand, and with his spear Sir Tristram ran upon King\nArthur; and then King Arthur boldly abode him and with his sword he\nsmote a-two his spear, and therewithal Sir Tristram stonied; and so King\nArthur gave him three or four strokes or he might get out his sword,\nand at the last Sir Tristram drew his sword and [either] assailed\nother passing hard. With that the great press departed [them]. Then Sir\nTristram rode here and there and did his great pain, that eleven of the\ngood knights of the blood of King Ban, that was of Sir Launcelot's kin,\nthat day Sir Tristram smote down; that all the estates marvelled of his\ngreat deeds and all cried upon the Knight with the Black Shield.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV. How Sir Launcelot hurt Sir Tristram, and how after Sir\nTristram smote down Sir Palomides.\n\nTHEN this cry was so large that Sir Launcelot heard it. And then he gat\na great spear in his hand and came towards the cry. Then Sir Launcelot\ncried: The Knight with the Black Shield, make thee ready to joust with\nme. When Sir Tristram heard him say so he gat his spear in his hand, and\neither abashed down their heads, and came together as thunder; and Sir\nTristram's spear brake in pieces, and Sir Launcelot by malfortune struck\nSir Tristram on the side a deep wound nigh to the death; but yet Sir\nTristram avoided not his saddle, and so the spear brake. Therewithal\nSir Tristram that was wounded gat out his sword, and he rushed to Sir\nLauncelot, and gave him three great strokes upon the helm that the fire\nsprang thereout, and Sir Launcelot abashed his head lowly toward his\nsaddle-bow. And therewithal Sir Tristram departed from the field, for he\nfelt him so wounded that he weened he should have died; and Sir Dinadan\nespied him and followed him into the forest. Then Sir Launcelot abode\nand did many marvellous deeds.\n\nSo when Sir Tristram was departed by the forest's side he alighted, and\nunlaced his harness and freshed his wound; then weened Sir Dinadan that\nhe should have died. Nay, nay, said Sir Tristram, Dinadan never dread\nthee, for I am heart-whole, and of this wound I shall soon be whole,\nby the mercy of God. By that Sir Dinadan was ware where came Palomides\nriding straight upon them. And then Sir Tristram was ware that Sir\nPalomides came to have destroyed him. And so Sir Dinadan gave him\nwarning, and said: Sir Tristram, my lord, ye are so sore wounded that ye\nmay not have ado with him, therefore I will ride against him and do to\nhim what I may, and if I be slain ye may pray for my soul; and in the\nmeanwhile ye may withdraw you and go into the castle, or in the forest,\nthat he shall not meet with you. Sir Tristram smiled and said: I thank\nyou, Sir Dinadan, of your good will, but ye shall wit that I am able to\nhandle him. And then anon hastily he armed him, and took his horse,\nand a great spear in his hand, and said to Sir Dinadan: Adieu; and rode\ntoward Sir Palomides a soft pace. Then when Sir Palomides saw that, he\nmade countenance to amend his horse, but he did it for this cause, for\nhe abode Sir Gaheris that came after him. And when he was come he rode\ntoward Sir Tristram. Then Sir Tristram sent unto Sir Palomides, and\nrequired him to joust with him; and if he smote down Sir Palomides he\nwould do no more to him; and if it so happened that Sir Palomides smote\ndown Sir Tristram, he bade him do his utterance. So they were accorded.\nThen they met together, and Sir Tristram smote down Sir Palomides that\nhe had a grievous fall, so that he lay still as he had been dead. And\nthen Sir Tristram ran upon Sir Gaheris, and he would not have jousted;\nbut whether he would or not Sir Tristram smote him over his horse's\ncroup, that he lay still as though he had been dead. And then Sir\nTristram rode his way and left Sir Persides' squire within the\npavilions, and Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan rode to an old knight's\nplace to lodge them. And that old knight had five sons at the\ntournament, for whom he prayed God heartily for their coming home. And\nso, as the French book saith, they came home all five well beaten.\n\nAnd when Sir Tristram departed into the forest Sir Launcelot held alway\nthe stour like hard, as a man araged that took no heed to himself, and\nwit ye well there was many a noble knight against him. And when King\nArthur saw Sir Launcelot do so marvellous deeds of arms he then armed\nhim, and took his horse and his armour, and rode into the field to help\nSir Launcelot; and so many knights came in with King Arthur. And to make\nshort tale in conclusion, the King of Northgalis and the King of the\nHundred Knights were put to the worse; and because Sir Launcelot abode\nand was the last in the field the prize was given him. But Sir Launcelot\nwould neither for king, queen, nor knight, have the prize, but where the\ncry was cried through the field: Sir Launcelot, Sir Launcelot hath won\nthe field this day, Sir Launcelot let make another cry contrary: Sir\nTristram hath won the field, for he began first, and last he hath\nendured, and so hath he done the first day, the second, and the third\nday.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV. How the prize of the third day was given to Sir Launcelot,\nand Sir Launcelot gave it to Sir Tristram.\n\nTHEN all the estates and degrees high and low said of Sir Launcelot\ngreat worship, for the honour that he did unto Sir Tristram; and for\nthat honour doing to Sir Tristram he was at that time more praised and\nrenowned than an he had overthrown five hundred knights; and all the\npeople wholly for this gentleness, first the estates both high and low,\nand after the commonalty cried at once: Sir Launcelot hath won the field\nwhosoever say nay. Then was Sir Launcelot wroth and ashamed, and so\ntherewithal he rode to King Arthur. Alas, said the king, we are all\ndismayed that Sir Tristram is thus departed from us. By God, said King\nArthur, he is one of the noblest knights that ever I saw hold spear or\nsword in hand, and the most courteoust knight in his fighting; for full\nhard I saw him, said King Arthur, when he smote Sir Palomides upon the\nhelm thrice, that he abashed his helm with his strokes, and also he\nsaid: Here is a stroke for Sir Tristram, and thus thrice he said. Then\nKing Arthur, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Dodinas le Savage took their horses\nto seek Sir Tristram, and by the means of Sir Persides he had told King\nArthur where Sir Tristram was in his pavilion. But when they came there,\nSir Tristram and Sir Dinadan were gone.\n\nThen King Arthur and Sir Launcelot were heavy, and returned again to the\nCastle of Maidens making great dole for the hurt of Sir Tristram, and\nhis sudden departing. So God me help, said King Arthur, I am more heavy\nthat I cannot meet with him than for all the hurts that all my knights\nhave had at the tournament. Right so came Sir Gaheris and told King\nArthur how Sir Tristram had smitten down Sir Palomides, and it was\nat Sir Palomides' own request. Alas, said King Arthur, that was great\ndishonour to Sir Palomides, inasmuch as Sir Tristram was sore wounded,\nand now may we all, kings, and knights, and men of worship, say that Sir\nTristram may be called a noble knight, and one of the best knights\nthat ever I saw the days of my life. For I will that ye all, kings\nand knights, know, said King Arthur, that I never saw knight do so\nmarvellously as he hath done these three days; for he was the first that\nbegan and that longest held on, save this last day. And though he was\nhurt, it was a manly adventure of two noble knights, and when two noble\nmen encounter needs must the one have the worse, like as God will suffer\nat that time. As for me, said Sir Launcelot, for all the lands that ever\nmy father left me I would not have hurt Sir Tristram an I had known him\nat that time; that I hurt him was for I saw not his shield. For an I\nhad seen his black shield, I would not have meddled with him for many\ncauses; for late he did as much for me as ever did knight, and that is\nwell known that he had ado with thirty knights, and no help save\nSir Dinadan. And one thing shall I promise, said Sir Launcelot, Sir\nPalomides shall repent it as in his unkindly dealing for to follow that\nnoble knight that I by mishap hurted thus. Sir Launcelot said all the\nworship that might be said by Sir Tristram. Then King Arthur made a\ngreat feast to all that would come. And thus we let pass King Arthur,\nand a little we will turn unto Sir Palomides, that after he had a fall\nof Sir Tristram, he was nigh-hand araged out of his wit for despite of\nSir Tristram. And so he followed him by adventure. And as he came by a\nriver, in his woodness he would have made his horse to have leapt\nover; and the horse failed footing and fell in the river, wherefore\nSir Palomides was adread lest he should have been drowned; and then he\navoided his horse, and swam to the land, and let his horse go down by\nadventure.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI. How Palomides came to the castle where Sir Tristram\nwas, and of the quest that Sir Launcelot and ten knights made for Sir\nTristram.\n\nAND when he came to the land he took off his harness, and sat roaring\nand crying as a man out of his mind. Right so came a damosel even by\nSir Palomides, that was sent from Sir Gawaine and his brother unto Sir\nMordred, that lay sick in the same place with that old knight where Sir\nTristram was. For, as the French book saith, Sir Persides hurt so\nSir Mordred a ten days afore; and had it hot been for the love of Sir\nGawaine and his brother, Sir Persides had slain Sir Mordred. And so this\ndamosel came by Sir Palomides, and she and he had language together, the\nwhich pleased neither of them; and so the damosel rode her ways till she\ncame to the old knight's place, and there she told that old knight how\nshe met with the woodest knight by adventure that ever she met withal.\nWhat bare he in his shield? said Sir Tristram. It was indented with\nwhite and black, said the damosel. Ah, said Sir Tristram, that was Sir\nPalomides, the good knight. For well I know him, said Sir Tristram, for\none of the best knights living in this realm. Then that old knight took\na little hackney, and rode for Sir Palomides, and brought him unto his\nown manor; and full well knew Sir Tristram Sir Palomides, but he said\nbut little, for at that time Sir Tristram was walking upon his feet,\nand well amended of his hurts; and always when Sir Palomides saw Sir\nTristram he would behold him full marvellously, and ever him seemed that\nhe had seen him. Then would he say unto Sir Dinadan: An ever I may meet\nwith Sir Tristram he shall not escape mine hands. I marvel, said Sir\nDinadan, that ye boast behind Sir Tristram, for it is but late that he\nwas in your hands, and ye in his hands; why would ye not hold him when\nye had him? for I saw myself twice or thrice that ye gat but little\nworship of Sir Tristram. Then was Sir Palomides ashamed. So leave we\nthem a little while in the old castle with the old knight Sir Darras.\n\nNow shall we speak of King Arthur, that said to Sir Launcelot: Had not\nye been we had not lost Sir Tristram, for he was here daily unto the\ntime ye met with him, and in an evil time, said Arthur, ye encountered\nwith him. My lord Arthur, said Launcelot, ye put upon me that I should\nbe cause of his departition; God knoweth it was against my will. But\nwhen men be hot in deeds of arms oft they hurt their friends as well as\ntheir foes. And my lord, said Sir Launcelot, ye shall understand that\nSir Tristram is a man that I am loath to offend, for he hath done for me\nmore than ever I did for him as yet. But then Sir Launcelot made bring\nforth a book: and then Sir Launcelot said: Here we are ten knights that\nwill swear upon a book never to rest one night where we rest another\nthis twelvemonth until that we find Sir Tristram. And as for me, said\nSir Launcelot, I promise you upon this book that an I may meet with him,\neither with fairness or foulness I shall bring him to this court, or\nelse I shall die therefore. And the names of these ten knights that had\nundertaken this quest were these following: First was Sir Launcelot,\nSir Ector de Maris, Sir Bors de Ganis, and Bleoberis, and Sir Blamore\nde Ganis, and Lucan the Butler, Sir Uwaine, Sir Galihud Lionel, and\nGaliodin. So these ten noble knights departed from the court of King\nArthur, and so they rode upon their quest together until they came to\na cross where departed four ways, and there departed the fellowship in\nfour to seek Sir Tristram.\n\nAnd as Sir Launcelot rode by adventure he met with Dame Bragwaine that\nwas sent into that country to seek Sir Tristram, and she fled as fast\nas her palfrey might go. So Sir Launcelot met with her and asked her why\nshe fled. Ah, fair knight, said Dame Bragwaine, I flee for dread of my\nlife, for here followeth me Sir Breuse Saunce Pite to slay me. Hold\nyou nigh me, said Sir Launcelot. Then when Sir Launcelot saw Sir Breuse\nSaunce Pite, Sir Launcelot cried unto him, and said: False knight\ndestroyer of ladies and damosels, now thy last days be come. When Sir\nBreuse Saunce Pite saw Sir Launcelot's shield he knew it well, for at\nthat time he bare not the arms of Cornwall, but he bare his own shield.\nAnd then Sir Breuse fled, and Sir Launcelot followed after him. But Sir\nBreuse was so well horsed that when him list to flee he might well flee,\nand also abide when him list. And then Sir Launcelot returned unto Dame\nBragwaine, and she thanked him of his great labour.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII. How Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan were\ntaken and put in prison.\n\nNOW will we speak of Sir Lucan the butler, that by fortune he came\nriding to the same place thereas was Sir Tristram, and in he came in\nnone other intent but to ask harbour. Then the porter asked what was his\nname. Tell your lord that my name is Sir Lucan, the butler, a Knight of\nthe Round Table. So the porter went unto Sir Darras, lord of the place,\nand told him who was there to ask harbour. Nay, nay, said Sir Daname,\nthat was nephew to Sir Darras, say him that he shall not be lodged here,\nbut let him wit that I, Sir Daname, will meet with him anon, and bid him\nmake him ready. So Sir Daname came forth on horseback, and there they\nmet together with spears, and Sir Lucan smote down Sir Daname over his\nhorse's croup, and then he fled into that place, and Sir Lucan rode\nafter him, and asked after him many times.\n\nThen Sir Dinadan said to Sir Tristram: It is shame to see the lord's\ncousin of this place defoiled. Abide, said Sir Tristram, and I shall\nredress it. And in the meanwhile Sir Dinadan was on horseback, and he\njousted with Lucan the butler, and there Sir Lucan smote Dinadan through\nthe thick of the thigh, and so he rode his way; and Sir Tristram was\nwroth that Sir Dinadan was hurt, and followed after, and thought to\navenge him; and within a while he overtook Sir Lucan, and bade him turn;\nand so they met together so that Sir Tristram hurt Sir Lucan passing\nsore and gave him a fall. With that came Sir Uwaine, a gentle knight,\nand when he saw Sir Lucan so hurt he called Sir Tristram to joust with\nhim. Fair knight, said Sir Tristram, tell me your name I require you.\nSir knight, wit ye well my name is Sir Uwaine le Fise de Roy Ureine. Ah,\nsaid Sir Tristram, by my will I would not have ado with you at no time.\nYe shall not so, said Sir Uwaine, but ye shall have ado with me.\nAnd then Sir Tristram saw none other bote, but rode against him, and\noverthrew Sir Uwaine and hurt him in the side, and so he departed unto\nhis lodging again. And when Sir Dinadan understood that Sir Tristram had\nhurt Sir Lucan he would have ridden after Sir Lucan for to have slain\nhim, but Sir Tristram would not suffer him. Then Sir Uwaine let ordain\nan horse litter, and brought Sir Lucan to the abbey of Ganis, and the\ncastle thereby hight the Castle of Ganis, of the which Sir Bleoberis was\nlord. And at that castle Sir Launcelot promised all his fellows to meet\nin the quest of Sir Tristram.\n\n\nSo when Sir Tristram was come to his lodging there came a damosel that\ntold Sir Darras that three of his sons were slain at that tournament,\nand two grievously wounded that they were never like to help themself.\nAnd all this was done by a noble knight that bare the black shield, and\nthat was he that bare the prize. Then came there one and told Sir Darras\nthat the same knight was within, him that bare the black shield. Then\nSir Darras yede unto Sir Tristram's chamber, and there he found his\nshield and showed it to the damosel. Ah sir, said the damosel, that same\nis he that slew your three sons. Then without any tarrying Sir Darras\nput Sir Tristram, and Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan, within a strong\nprison, and there Sir Tristram was like to have died of great sickness;\nand every day Sir Palomides would reprove Sir Tristram of old hate\nbetwixt them. And ever Sir Tristram spake fair and said little. But when\nSir Palomides saw the falling of sickness of Sir Tristram, then was he\nheavy for him, and comforted him in all the best wise he could. And as\nthe French book saith, there came forty knights to Sir Darras that\nwere of his own kin, and they would have slain Sir Tristram and his two\nfellows, but Sir Darras would not suffer that, but kept them in prison,\nand meat and drink they had. So Sir Tristram endured there great\npain, for sickness had undertaken him, and that is the greatest pain a\nprisoner may have. For all the while a prisoner may have his health\nof body he may endure under the mercy of God and in hope of good\ndeliverance; but when sickness toucheth a prisoner's body, then may a\nprisoner say all wealth is him bereft, and then he hath cause to wail\nand to weep. Right so did Sir Tristram when sickness had undertaken him,\nfor then he took such sorrow that he had almost slain himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII. How King Mark was sorry for the good renown of\nSir Tristram. Some of King Arthur's knights jousted with knights of\nCornwall.\n\nNOW will we speak, and leave Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir\nDinadan in prison, and speak we of other knights that sought after Sir\nTristram many divers parts of this land. And some yede into Cornwall;\nand by adventure Sir Gaheris, nephew unto King Arthur, came unto King\nMark, and there he was well received and sat at King Mark's own table\nand ate of his own mess. Then King Mark asked Sir Gaheris what tidings\nthere were in the realm of Logris. Sir, said Sir Gaheris, the king\nreigneth as a noble knight; and now but late there was a great jousts\nand tournament as ever I saw any in the realm of Logris, and the most\nnoble knights were at that jousts. But there was one knight that did\nmarvellously three days, and he bare a black shield, and of all knights\nthat ever I saw he proved the best knight. Then, said King Mark, that\nwas Sir Launcelot, or Sir Palomides the paynim. Not so, said Sir Gheris,\nfor both Sir Launcelot and Sir Palomides were on the contrary party\nagainst the Knight with the Black Shield. Then was it Sir Tristram, said\nthe king. Yea, said Sir Gaheris. And therewithal the king smote down his\nhead, and in his heart he feared sore that Sir Tristram should get him\nsuch worship in the realm of Logris wherethrough that he himself should\nnot be able to withstand him. Thus Sir Gaheris had great cheer with King\nMark, and with Queen La Beale Isoud, the which was glad of Sir Gaheris'\nwords; for well she wist by his deeds and manners that it was Sir\nTristram. And then the king made a feast royal, and to that feast\ncame Sir Uwaine le Fise de Roy Ureine, and some called him Uwaine\nle Blanchemains. And this Sir Uwaine challenged all the knights of\nCornwall. Then was the king wood wroth that he had no knights to answer\nhim. Then Sir Andred, nephew unto King Mark, leapt up and said: I will\nencounter with Sir Uwaine. Then he yede and armed him and horsed him in\nthe best manner. And there Sir Uwaine met with Sir Andred, and smote him\ndown that he swooned on the earth. Then was King Mark sorry and wroth\nout of measure that he had no knight to revenge his nephew, Sir Andred.\n\nSo the king called unto him Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, and prayed him for\nhis sake to take upon him to joust with Sir Uwaine. Sir, said Sir Dinas,\nI am full loath to have ado with any knight of the Round Table. Yet,\nsaid the king, for my love take upon thee to joust. So Sir Dinas made\nhim ready, and anon they encountered together with great spears, but\nSir Dinas was overthrown, horse and man, a great fall. Who was wroth\nbut King Mark! Alas, he said, have I no knight that will encounter with\nyonder knight? Sir, said Sir Gaheris, for your sake I will joust. So Sir\nGaheris made him ready, and when he was armed he rode into the field.\nAnd when Sir Uwaine saw Sir Gaheris' shield he rode to him and said:\nSir, ye do not your part. For, sir, the first time ye were made Knight\nof the Round Table ye sware that ye should not have ado with your\nfellowship wittingly. And pardie, Sir Gaheris, ye knew me well enough\nby my shield, and so do I know you by your shield, and though ye would\nbreak your oath I would not break mine; for there is not one here, nor\nye, that shall think I am afeard of you, but I durst right well have ado\nwith you, and yet we be sisters' sons. Then was Sir Gaheris ashamed, and\nso therewithal every knight went their way, and Sir Uwaine rode into the\ncountry.\n\nThen King Mark armed him, and took his horse and his spear, with a\nsquire with him. And then he rode afore Sir Uwaine, and suddenly at a\ngap he ran upon him as he that was not ware of him, and there he smote\nhim almost through the body, and there left him. So within a while there\ncame Sir Kay and found Sir Uwaine, and asked him how he was hurt. I wot\nnot, said Sir Uwaine, why nor wherefore, but by treason I am sure I gat\nthis hurt; for here came a knight suddenly upon me or that I was ware,\nand suddenly hurt me. Then there was come Sir Andred to seek King Mark.\nThou traitor knight, said Sir Kay, an I wist it were thou that thus\ntraitorly hast hurt this noble knight thou shouldst never pass my hands.\nSir, said Sir Andred, I did never hurt him, and that I will report me to\nhimself. Fie on you false knight, said Sir Kay, for ye of Cornwall are\nnought worth. So Sir Kay made carry Sir Uwaine to the Abbey of the Black\nCross, and there he was healed. And then Sir Gaheris took his leave of\nKing Mark, but or he departed he said: Sir king, ye did a foul shame\nunto you and your court, when ye banished Sir Tristram out of this\ncountry, for ye needed not to have doubted no knight an he had been\nhere. And so he departed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX. Of the treason of King Mark, and how Sir Gaheris smote\nhim down and Andred his cousin.\n\nTHEN there came Sir Kay, the Seneschal, unto King Mark, and there he had\ngood cheer showing outward. Now, fair lords, said he, will ye prove any\nadventure in the forest of Morris, in the which I know well is as hard\nan adventure as I know any. Sir, said Sir Kay, I will prove it. And Sir\nGaheris said he would be avised for King Mark was ever full of treason:\nand therewithal Sir Gaheris departed and rode his way. And by the same\nway that Sir Kay should ride he laid him down to rest, charging his\nsquire to wait upon Sir Kay; And warn me when he cometh. So within a\nwhile Sir Kay came riding that way, and then Sir Gaheris took his horse\nand met him, and said: Sir Kay, ye are not wise to ride at the request\nof King Mark, for he dealeth all with treason. Then said Sir Kay: I\nrequire you let us prove this adventure. I shall not fail you, said\nSir Gaheris. And so they rode that time till a lake that was that time\ncalled the Perilous Lake, and there they abode under the shaw of the\nwood.\n\nThe meanwhile King Mark within the castle of Tintagil avoided all his\nbarons, and all other save such as were privy with him were avoided out\nof his chamber. And then he let call his nephew Sir Andred, and bade arm\nhim and horse him lightly; and by that time it was midnight. And so King\nMark was armed in black, horse and all; and so at a privy postern they\ntwo issued out with their varlets with them, and rode till they came\nto that lake. Then Sir Kay espied them first, and gat his spear, and\nproffered to joust. And King Mark rode against him, and smote each\nother full hard, for the moon shone as the bright day. And there at that\njousts Sir Kay's horse fell down, for his horse was not so big as\nthe king's horse, and Sir Kay's horse bruised him full sore. Then Sir\nGaheris was wroth that Sir Kay had a fall. Then he cried: Knight, sit\nthou fast in thy saddle, for I will revenge my fellow. Then King Mark\nwas afeard of Sir Gaheris, and so with evil will King Mark rode against\nhim, and Sir Gaheris gave him such a stroke that he fell down. So then\nforthwithal Sir Gaheris ran unto Sir Andred and smote him from his horse\nquite, that his helm smote in the earth, and nigh had broken his neck.\nAnd therewithal Sir Gaheris alighted, and gat up Sir Kay. And then they\nyode both on foot to them, and bade them yield them, and tell their\nnames outher they should die. Then with great pain Sir Andred spake\nfirst, and said: It is King Mark of Cornwall, therefore be ye ware\nwhat ye do, and I am Sir Andred, his cousin. Fie on you both, said Sir\nGaheris, for a false traitor, and false treason hast thou wrought and\nhe both, under the feigned cheer that ye made us! it were pity, said\nSir Gaheris, that thou shouldst live any longer. Save my life, said King\nMark, and I will make amends; and consider that I am a king anointed. It\nwere the more shame, said Sir Gaheris, to save thy life; thou art a king\nanointed with cream, and therefore thou shouldst hold with all men of\nworship; and therefore thou art worthy to die. With that he lashed at\nKing Mark without saying any more, and covered him with his shield and\ndefended him as he might. And then Sir Kay lashed at Sir Andred, and\ntherewithal King Mark yielded him unto Sir Gaheris. And then he kneeled\nadown, and made his oath upon the cross of the sword, that never while\nhe lived he would be against errant-knights. And also he sware to be\ngood friend unto Sir Tristram if ever he came into Cornwall.\n\nBy then Sir Andred was on the earth, and Sir Kay would have slain him.\nLet be, said Sir Gaheris, slay him not I pray you. It were pity, said\nSir Kay, that he should live any longer, for this is nigh cousin unto\nSir Tristram, and ever he hath been a traitor unto him, and by him he\nwas exiled out of Cornwall, and therefore I will slay him, said Sir Kay.\nYe shall not, said Sir Gaheris; sithen I have given the king his life,\nI pray you give him his life. And therewithal Sir Kay let him go. And\nso Sir Kay and Sir Gaheris rode their way unto Dinas, the Seneschal, for\nbecause they heard say that he loved well Sir Tristram. So they reposed\nthem there, and soon after they rode unto the realm of Logris. And so\nwithin a little while they met with Sir Launcelot that always had Dame\nBragwaine with him, to that intent he weened to have met the sooner\nwith Sir Tristram; and Sir Launcelot asked what tidings in Cornwall,\nand whether they heard of Sir Tristram or not. Sir Kay and Sir Gaheris\nanswered and said, that they heard not of him. Then they told Sir\nLauncelot word by word of their adventure. Then Sir Launcelot smiled and\nsaid: Hard it is to take out of the flesh that is bred in the bone; and\nso made them merry together.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nHow after that Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan had been\nlong in prison they were delivered.\n\nNOW leave we off this tale, and speak we of sir Dinas that had within\nthe castle a paramour, and she loved another knight better than him. And\nso when sir Dinas went out a-hunting she slipped down by a towel, and\ntook with her two brachets, and so she yede to the knight that she\nloved, and he her again. And when sir Dinas came home and missed his\nparamour and his brachets, then was he the more wrother for his brachets\nthan for the lady. So then he rode after the knight that had his\nparamour, and bade him turn and joust. So sir Dinas smote him down,\nthat with the fall he brake his leg and his arm. And then his lady and\nparamour cried sir Dinas mercy, and said she would love him better than\never she did. Nay, said sir Dinas, I shall never trust them that once\nbetrayed me, and therefore, as ye have begun, so end, for I will never\nmeddle with you. And so sir Dinas departed, and took his brachets with\nhim, and so rode to his castle.\n\nNow will we turn unto sir Launcelot, that was right heavy that he could\nnever hear no tidings of sir Tristram, for all this while he was in\nprison with sir Darras, Palomides, and Dinadan. Then Dame Bragwaine\ntook her leave to go into Cornwall, and sir Launcelot, sir Kay, and sir\nGaheris rode to seek sir Tristram in the country of Surluse.\n\nNow speaketh this tale of sir Tristram and of his two fellows, for every\nday sir Palomides brawled and said language against sir Tristram. I\nmarvel, said sir Dinadan, of thee, sir Palomides, an thou haddest sir\nTristram here thou wouldst do him no harm; for an a wolf and a sheep\nwere together in a prison the wolf would suffer the sheep to be in\npeace. And wit thou well, said sir Dinadan, this same is sir Tristram\nat a word, and now must thou do thy best with him, and let see now if\nye can skift it with your hands. Then was sir Palomides abashed and said\nlittle. Sir Palomides, then said sir Tristram, I have heard much of your\nmaugre against me, but I will not meddle with you as at this time by my\nwill, because I dread the lord of this place that hath us in governance;\nfor an I dread him not more than I do thee, soon it should be skift: so\nthey peaced themself. Right so came in a damosel and said: Knights, be\nof good cheer, for ye are sure of your lives, and that I heard say my\nlord, Sir Darras. Then were they glad all three, for daily they weened\nthey should have died.\n\nThen soon after this Sir Tristram fell sick that he weened to have died;\nthen Sir Dinadan wept, and so did Sir Palomides under them both making\ngreat sorrow. So a damosel came in to them and found them mourning. Then\nshe went unto Sir Darras, and told him how that mighty knight that bare\nthe black shield was likely to die. That shall not be, said Sir Darras,\nfor God defend when knights come to me for succour that I should suffer\nthem to die within my prison. Therefore, said Sir Darras to the damosel,\nfetch that knight and his fellows afore me. And then anon Sir Darras saw\nSir Tristram brought afore him. He said: Sir knight, me repenteth of thy\nsickness for thou art called a full noble knight, and so it seemeth\nby thee; and wit ye well it shall never be said that Sir Darras shall\ndestroy such a noble knight as thou art in prison, howbeit that thou\nhast slain three of my sons whereby I was greatly aggrieved. But now\nshalt thou go and thy fellows, and your harness and horses have been\nfair and clean kept, and ye shall go where it liketh you, upon this\ncovenant, that thou, knight, wilt promise me to be good friend to my\nsons two that be now alive, and also that thou tell me thy name. Sir,\nsaid he, as for me my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and in Cornwall\nwas I born, and nephew I am unto King Mark. And as for the death of your\nsons I might not do withal, for an they had been the next kin that\nI have I might have done none otherwise. And if I had slain them\nby treason or treachery I had been worthy to have died. All this\nI consider, said Sir Darras, that all that ye did was by force of\nknighthood, and that was the cause I would not put you to death. But\nsith ye be Sir Tristram, the good knight, I pray you heartily to be my\ngood friend and to my sons. Sir, said Sir Tristram, I promise you by the\nfaith of my body, ever while I live I will do you service, for ye\nhave done to us but as a natural knight ought to do. Then Sir Tristram\nreposed him there till that he was amended of his sickness; and when he\nwas big and strong they took their leave, and every knight took their\nhorses, and so departed and rode together till they came to a cross way.\nNow fellows, said Sir Tristram, here will we depart in sundry ways. And\nbecause Sir Dinadan had the first adventure of him I will begin.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI. How Sir Dinadan rescued a lady from Sir Breuse Saunce Pite,\nand how Sir Tristram received a shield of Morgan le Fay.\n\nSO as Sir Dinadan rode by a well he found a lady making great dole.\nWhat aileth you? said Sir Dinadan. Sir knight, said the lady, I am the\nwofullest lady of the world, for within these five days here came a\nknight called Sir Breuse Saunce Pite, and he slew mine own brother, and\never since he hath kept me at his own will, and of all men in the world\nI hate him most; and therefore I require you of knighthood to avenge me,\nfor he will not tarry, but be here anon. Let him come, said Sir Dinadan,\nand because of honour of all women I will do my part. With this came Sir\nBreuse, and when he saw a knight with his lady he was wood wroth. And\nthen he said: Sir knight, keep thee from me. So they hurtled together\nas thunder, and either smote other passing sore, but Sir Dinadan put\nhim through the shoulder a grievous wound, and or ever Sir Dinadan might\nturn him Sir Breuse was gone and fled. Then the lady prayed him to bring\nher to a castle there beside but four mile thence; and so Sir Dinadan\nbrought her there, and she was welcome, for the lord of that castle was\nher uncle; and so Sir Dinadan rode his way upon his adventure.\n\nNow turn we this tale unto Sir Tristram, that by adventure he came to a\ncastle to ask lodging, wherein was Queen Morgan le Fay; and so when Sir\nTristram was let into that castle he had good cheer all that night. And\nupon the morn when he would have departed the queen said: Wit ye well\nye shall not depart lightly, for ye are here as a prisoner. Jesu defend!\nsaid Sir Tristram, for I was but late a prisoner. Fair knight, said\nthe queen, ye shall abide with me till that I wit what ye are and from\nwhence ye come. And ever the queen would set Sir Tristram on her own\nside, and her paramour on the other side. And ever Queen Morgan would\nbehold Sir Tristram, and thereat the knight was jealous, and was in will\nsuddenly to have run upon Sir Tristram with a sword, but he left it\nfor shame. Then the queen said to Sir Tristram: Tell me thy name, and I\nshall suffer you to depart when ye will. Upon that covenant I tell you\nmy name is Sir Tristram de Liones. Ah, said Morgan le Fay, an I had wist\nthat, thou shouldst not have departed so soon as thou shalt. But sithen\nI have made a promise I will hold it, with that thou wilt promise me to\nbear upon thee a shield that I shall deliver thee, unto the castle of\nthe Hard Rock, where King Arthur had cried a great tournament, and there\nI pray you that ye will be, and to do for me as much deeds of arms as\nye may do. For at the Castle of Maidens, Sir Tristram, ye did marvellous\ndeeds of arms as ever I heard knight do. Madam, said Sir Tristram, let\nme see the shield that I shall bear. Then the shield was brought forth,\nand the field was goldish, with a king and a queen therein painted, and\na knight standing above them, [one foot] upon the king's head, and the\nother upon the queen's. Madam, said Sir Tristram, this is a fair shield\nand a mighty; but what signifieth this king and this queen, and the\nknight standing upon both their heads? I shall tell you, said Morgan\nle Fay, it signifieth King Arthur and Queen Guenever, and a knight who\nholdeth them both in bondage and in servage. Who is that knight? said\nSir Tristram. That shall ye not wit as at this time, said the queen.\nBut as the French book saith, Queen Morgan loved Sir Launcelot best, and\never she desired him, and he would never love her nor do nothing at her\nrequest, and therefore she held many knights together for to have taken\nhim by strength. And because she deemed that Sir Launcelot loved Queen\nGuenever paramour, and she him again, therefore Queen Morgan le Fay\nordained that shield to put Sir Launcelot to a rebuke, to that intent\nthat King Arthur might understand the love between them. Then Sir\nTristram took that shield and promised her to bear it at the tournament\nat the Castle of the Hard Rock. But Sir Tristram knew not that that\nshield was ordained against Sir Launcelot, but afterward he knew it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII. How Sir Tristram took with him the shield, and also how he\nslew the paramour of Morgan le Fay.\n\nSO then Sir Tristram took his leave of the queen, and took the shield\nwith him. Then came the knight that held Queen Morgan le Fay, his name\nwas Sir Hemison, and he made him ready to follow Sir Tristram. Fair\nfriend, said Morgan, ride not after that knight, for ye shall not win no\nworship of him. Fie on him, coward, said Sir Hemison, for I wist never\ngood knight come out of Cornwall but if it were Sir Tristram de Liones.\nWhat an that be he? said she. Nay, nay, said he, he is with La Beale\nIsoud, and this is but a daffish knight. Alas, my fair friend, ye shall\nfind him the best knight that ever ye met withal, for I know him better\nthan ye do. For your sake, said Sir Hemison, I shall slay him. Ah, fair\nfriend, said the queen, me repenteth that ye will follow that knight,\nfor I fear me sore of your again coming. With this this knight rode his\nway wood wroth, and he rode after Sir Tristram as fast as he had been\nchased with knights. When Sir Tristram heard a knight come after him so\nfast he returned about, and saw a knight coming against him. And when he\ncame nigh to Sir Tristram he cried on high: Sir knight, keep thee from\nme. Then they rushed together as it had been thunder, and Sir Hemison\nbrised his spear upon Sir Tristram, but his harness was so good that\nhe might not hurt him. And Sir Tristram smote him harder, and bare him\nthrough the body, and he fell over his horse's croup. Then Sir Tristram\nturned to have done more with his sword, but he saw so much blood go\nfrom him that him seemed he was likely to die, and so he departed from\nhim and came to a fair manor to an old knight, and there Sir Tristram\nlodged.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII. How Morgan le Fay buried her paramour, and how Sir\nTristram praised Sir Launcelot and his kin.\n\nNOW leave to speak of Sir Tristram, and speak we of the knight that was\nwounded to the death. Then his varlet alighted, and took off his helm,\nand then he asked his lord whether there were any life in him. There\nis in me life said the knight, but it is but little; and therefore leap\nthou up behind me when thou hast holpen me up, and hold me fast that\nI fall not, and bring me to Queen Morgan le Fay; for deep draughts of\ndeath draw to my heart that I may not live, for I would fain speak\nwith her or I died: for else my soul will be in great peril an I die.\nFor[thwith] with great pain his varlet brought him to the castle, and\nthere Sir Hemison fell down dead. When Morgan le Fay saw him dead she\nmade great sorrow out of reason; and then she let despoil him unto his\nshirt, and so she let him put into a tomb. And about the tomb she let\nwrite: Here lieth Sir Hemison, slain by the hands of Sir Tristram de\nLiones.\n\nNow turn we unto Sir Tristram, that asked the knight his host if he saw\nlate any knights adventurous. Sir, he said, the last night here lodged\nwith me Ector de Maris and a damosel with him, and that damosel told me\nthat he was one of the best knights of the world. That is not so, said\nSir Tristram, for I know four better knights of his own blood, and the\nfirst is Sir Launcelot du Lake, call him the best knight, and Sir Bors\nde Ganis, Sir Bleoberis, Sir Blamore de Ganis, and Sir Gaheris. Nay,\nsaid his host, Sir Gawaine is a better knight than he. That is not so,\nsaid Sir Tristram, for I have met with them both, and I felt Sir Gaheris\nfor the better knight, and Sir Lamorak I call him as good as any of them\nexcept Sir Launcelot. Why name ye not Sir Tristram? said his host, for\nI account him as good as any of them. I know not Sir Tristram, said\nTristram. Thus they talked and bourded as long as them list, and then\nwent to rest. And on the morn Sir Tristram departed, and took his leave\nof his host, and rode toward the Roche Dure, and none adventure had\nSir Tristram but that; and so he rested not till he came to the castle,\nwhere he saw five hundred tents.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV. How Sir Tristram at a tournament bare the shield that\nMorgan le Fay delivered to him.\n\nTHEN the King of Scots and the King of Ireland held against King\nArthur's knights, and there began a great medley. So came in Sir\nTristram and did marvellous deeds of arms, for there he smote down many\nknights. And ever he was afore King Arthur with that shield. And when\nKing Arthur saw that shield he marvelled greatly in what intent it was\nmade; but Queen Guenever deemed as it was, wherefore she was heavy. Then\nwas there a damosel of Queen Morgan in a chamber by King Arthur, and\nwhen she heard King Arthur speak of that shield, then she spake openly\nunto King Arthur. Sir King, wit ye well this shield was ordained for\nyou, to warn you of your shame and dishonour, and that longeth to you\nand your queen. And then anon that damosel picked her away privily, that\nno man wist where she was become. Then was King Arthur sad and wroth,\nand asked from whence came that damosel. There was not one that knew\nher nor wist where she was become. Then Queen Guenever called to her Sir\nEctor de Maris, and there she made her complaint to him, and said: I wot\nwell this shield was made by Morgan le Fay in despite of me and of Sir\nLauncelot, wherefore I dread me sore lest I should be destroyed. And\never the king beheld Sir Tristram, that did so marvellous deeds of arms\nthat he wondered sore what knight he might be, and well he wist it was\nnot Sir Launcelot. And it was told him that Sir Tristram was in Petit\nBritain with Isoud la Blanche Mains, for he deemed, an he had been in\nthe realm of Logris, Sir Launcelot or some of his fellows that were in\nthe quest of Sir Tristram that they should have found him or that time.\nSo King Arthur had marvel what knight he might be. And ever Sir Arthur's\neye was on that shield. All that espied the queen, and that made her\nsore afeard.\n\nThen ever Sir Tristram smote down knights wonderly to behold, what upon\nthe right hand and upon the left hand, that unnethe no knight might\nwithstand him. And the King of Scots and the King of Ireland began to\nwithdraw them. When Arthur espied that, he thought that that knight with\nthe strange shield should not escape him. Then he called unto him Sir\nUwaine le Blanche Mains, and bade him arm him and make him ready. So\nanon King Arthur and Sir Uwaine dressed them before Sir Tristram, and\nrequired him to tell them where he had that shield. Sir, he said, I had\nit of Queen Morgan le Fay, sister unto King Arthur.\n\nSo here endeth this history of this book, for it is the first book of\nSir Tristram de Liones and the second book of Sir Tristram followeth.\n\n\n\n\nGLOSSARY\n\n\n     Abashed, abased, lowered,\n     Abate, depress, calm,\n     Abought, paid for,\n     Abraid, started,\n     Accompted, counted,\n     Accorded, agreed,\n     Accordment, agreement,\n     Acquit, repay,\n     Actually, actively,\n     Adoubted, afraid,\n     Advision, vision,\n     Afeard, afraid,\n     Afterdeal, disadvantage,\n     Againsay, retract,\n     Aknown, known,\n     Aligement, alleviation,\n     Allegeance, alleviation,\n     Allow, approve,\n     Almeries, chests,\n     Alther, gen. pl., of all,\n     Amounted, mounted,\n     Anealed, anointed,\n     Anguishly, in pain,\n     Anon, at once,\n     Apair, weaken,\n     Apparelled, fitted up,\n     Appeach, impeach,\n     Appealed, challenged, accused,\n     Appertices, displays,\n     Araged, enraged, ;

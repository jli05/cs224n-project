{"summary": "Dmitri Gurov is a Moscow bank worker, married with a daughter and two sons. Unhappy in his marriage, he is frequently unfaithful and considers women to be of “a lower race”. While vacationing in Yalta, he sees a young lady walking along the seafront with her small dog, and endeavors to make her acquaintance. The lady, Anna Sergeyevna, is also vacationing, while her husband remains at home in an unnamed provincial town. They are soon engaged in an affair, and spend most of their time together walking and taking drives to nearby Oreanda. Though she is expecting her husband to come to Yalta, he eventually sends for her to come home, saying that something is wrong with his eyes. Gurov sees her off at the station.\nReturning to Moscow and his daily routine, working by day and clubbing by night, Gurov expects to soon forget young Anna but finds he is haunted by her memory. On the ruse of going to St. Petersburg to take care of some business, he sets off to her town to find her. Learning the location of the family’s residence from a hotel porter, he finds the house, only to realize that it would be futile to intrude. In despair, he reasons that Anna has probably forgotten him and found someone else, and heads back to his hotel for a long nap.\nIn the evening, he remembers having seen a sign earlier promoting a performance of The Geisha. Reasoning that Anna and her husband may attend the first performance, he goes to the theater. The couple enters and he watches intently. When the husband goes out for a smoke during the first interval, Gurov greets Anna, who is bewildered and runs from him. After following her through the theater, he confronts her and she confides that she has been thinking of him constantly. Frightened, she begs him to leave and promises to come to see him in Moscow.\nShe makes excuses to come to Moscow, telling her husband that she is going there to see a doctor, which he \"believes and does not believe\". Gurov realizes that for the first time in his life he has actually fallen in love, and wonders how they can continue. While they talk of finding a plan, the story ends without a resolution.\n\n", "full_text": "THE TALES OF CHEKHOV\n\nVOLUME 3\n\nTHE LADY WITH THE DOG AND OTHER STORIES\n\nBY\n\nANTON TCHEKHOV\n\nTranslated by CONSTANCE GARNETT\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\nTHE LADY WITH THE DOG\n\nA DOCTOR'S VISIT\n\nAN UPHEAVAL\n\nIONITCH\n\nTHE HEAD OF THE FAMILY\n\nTHE BLACK MONK\n\nVOLODYA\n\nAN ANONYMOUS STORY\n\nTHE HUSBAND\n\n\n\n\nTHE LADY WITH THE DOG\n\n\nI\n\nIT was said that a new person had appeared on the sea-front: a lady with\na little dog. Dmitri Dmitritch Gurov, who had by then been a fortnight\nat Yalta, and so was fairly at home there, had begun to take an interest\nin new arrivals. Sitting in Verney's pavilion, he saw, walking on the\nsea-front, a fair-haired young lady of medium height, wearing a _beret_;\na white Pomeranian dog was running behind her.\n\nAnd afterwards he met her in the public gardens and in the square\nseveral times a day. She was walking alone, always wearing the same\n_beret_, and always with the same white dog; no one knew who she was,\nand every one called her simply \"the lady with the dog.\"\n\n\"If she is here alone without a husband or friends, it wouldn't be amiss\nto make her acquaintance,\" Gurov reflected.\n\nHe was under forty, but he had a daughter already twelve years old, and\ntwo sons at school. He had been married young, when he was a student in\nhis second year, and by now his wife seemed half as old again as he. She\nwas a tall, erect woman with dark eyebrows, staid and dignified, and, as\nshe said of herself, intellectual. She read a great deal, used phonetic\nspelling, called her husband, not Dmitri, but Dimitri, and he secretly\nconsidered her unintelligent, narrow, inelegant, was afraid of her, and\ndid not like to be at home. He had begun being unfaithful to her long\nago--had been unfaithful to her often, and, probably on that account,\nalmost always spoke ill of women, and when they were talked about in his\npresence, used to call them \"the lower race.\"\n\nIt seemed to him that he had been so schooled by bitter experience that\nhe might call them what he liked, and yet he could not get on for two\ndays together without \"the lower race.\" In the society of men he was\nbored and not himself, with them he was cold and uncommunicative; but\nwhen he was in the company of women he felt free, and knew what to say\nto them and how to behave; and he was at ease with them even when he was\nsilent. In his appearance, in his character, in his whole nature, there\nwas something attractive and elusive which allured women and disposed\nthem in his favour; he knew that, and some force seemed to draw him,\ntoo, to them.\n\nExperience often repeated, truly bitter experience, had taught him long\nago that with decent people, especially Moscow people--always slow to\nmove and irresolute--every intimacy, which at first so agreeably\ndiversifies life and appears a light and charming adventure, inevitably\ngrows into a regular problem of extreme intricacy, and in the long run\nthe situation becomes unbearable. But at every fresh meeting with an\ninteresting woman this experience seemed to slip out of his memory, and\nhe was eager for life, and everything seemed simple and amusing.\n\nOne evening he was dining in the gardens, and the lady in the _beret_\ncame up slowly to take the next table. Her expression, her gait, her\ndress, and the way she did her hair told him that she was a lady, that\nshe was married, that she was in Yalta for the first time and alone, and\nthat she was dull there.... The stories told of the immorality in such\nplaces as Yalta are to a great extent untrue; he despised them, and knew\nthat such stories were for the most part made up by persons who would\nthemselves have been glad to sin if they had been able; but when the\nlady sat down at the next table three paces from him, he remembered\nthese tales of easy conquests, of trips to the mountains, and the\ntempting thought of a swift, fleeting love affair, a romance with an\nunknown woman, whose name he did not know, suddenly took possession of\nhim.\n\nHe beckoned coaxingly to the Pomeranian, and when the dog came up to him\nhe shook his finger at it. The Pomeranian growled: Gurov shook his\nfinger at it again.\n\nThe lady looked at him and at once dropped her eyes.\n\n\"He doesn't bite,\" she said, and blushed.\n\n\"May I give him a bone?\" he asked; and when she nodded he asked\ncourteously, \"Have you been long in Yalta?\"\n\n\"Five days.\"\n\n\"And I have already dragged out a fortnight here.\"\n\nThere was a brief silence.\n\n\"Time goes fast, and yet it is so dull here!\" she said, not looking at\nhim.\n\n\"That's only the fashion to say it is dull here. A provincial will live\nin Belyov or Zhidra and not be dull, and when he comes here it's 'Oh,\nthe dulness! Oh, the dust!' One would think he came from Grenada.\"\n\nShe laughed. Then both continued eating in silence, like strangers, but\nafter dinner they walked side by side; and there sprang up between them\nthe light jesting conversation of people who are free and satisfied, to\nwhom it does not matter where they go or what they talk about. They\nwalked and talked of the strange light on the sea: the water was of a\nsoft warm lilac hue, and there was a golden streak from the moon upon\nit. They talked of how sultry it was after a hot day. Gurov told her\nthat he came from Moscow, that he had taken his degree in Arts, but had\na post in a bank; that he had trained as an opera-singer, but had given\nit up, that he owned two houses in Moscow.... And from her he learnt\nthat she had grown up in Petersburg, but had lived in S---- since her\nmarriage two years before, that she was staying another month in Yalta,\nand that her husband, who needed a holiday too, might perhaps come and\nfetch her. She was not sure whether her husband had a post in a Crown\nDepartment or under the Provincial Council--and was amused by her own\nignorance. And Gurov learnt, too, that she was called Anna Sergeyevna.\n\nAfterwards he thought about her in his room at the hotel--thought she\nwould certainly meet him next day; it would be sure to happen. As he got\ninto bed he thought how lately she had been a girl at school, doing\nlessons like his own daughter; he recalled the diffidence, the\nangularity, that was still manifest in her laugh and her manner of\ntalking with a stranger. This must have been the first time in her life\nshe had been alone in surroundings in which she was followed, looked at,\nand spoken to merely from a secret motive which she could hardly fail to\nguess. He recalled her slender, delicate neck, her lovely grey eyes.\n\n\"There's something pathetic about her, anyway,\" he thought, and fell\nasleep.\n\n\nII\n\nA week had passed since they had made acquaintance. It was a holiday. It\nwas sultry indoors, while in the street the wind whirled the dust round\nand round, and blew people's hats off. It was a thirsty day, and Gurov\noften went into the pavilion, and pressed Anna Sergeyevna to have syrup\nand water or an ice. One did not know what to do with oneself.\n\nIn the evening when the wind had dropped a little, they went out on the\ngroyne to see the steamer come in. There were a great many people\nwalking about the harbour; they had gathered to welcome some one,\nbringing bouquets. And two peculiarities of a well-dressed Yalta crowd\nwere very conspicuous: the elderly ladies were dressed like young ones,\nand there were great numbers of generals.\n\nOwing to the roughness of the sea, the steamer arrived late, after the\nsun had set, and it was a long time turning about before it reached the\ngroyne. Anna Sergeyevna looked through her lorgnette at the steamer and\nthe passengers as though looking for acquaintances, and when she turned\nto Gurov her eyes were shining. She talked a great deal and asked\ndisconnected questions, forgetting next moment what she had asked; then\nshe dropped her lorgnette in the crush.\n\nThe festive crowd began to disperse; it was too dark to see people's\nfaces. The wind had completely dropped, but Gurov and Anna Sergeyevna\nstill stood as though waiting to see some one else come from the\nsteamer. Anna Sergeyevna was silent now, and sniffed the flowers without\nlooking at Gurov.\n\n\"The weather is better this evening,\" he said. \"Where shall we go now?\nShall we drive somewhere?\"\n\nShe made no answer.\n\nThen he looked at her intently, and all at once put his arm round her\nand kissed her on the lips, and breathed in the moisture and the\nfragrance of the flowers; and he immediately looked round him, anxiously\nwondering whether any one had seen them.\n\n\"Let us go to your hotel,\" he said softly. And both walked quickly.\n\nThe room was close and smelt of the scent she had bought at the Japanese\nshop. Gurov looked at her and thought: \"What different people one meets\nin the world!\" From the past he preserved memories of careless,\ngood-natured women, who loved cheerfully and were grateful to him for\nthe happiness he gave them, however brief it might be; and of women like\nhis wife who loved without any genuine feeling, with superfluous\nphrases, affectedly, hysterically, with an expression that suggested\nthat it was not love nor passion, but something more significant; and of\ntwo or three others, very beautiful, cold women, on whose faces he had\ncaught a glimpse of a rapacious expression--an obstinate desire to\nsnatch from life more than it could give, and these were capricious,\nunreflecting, domineering, unintelligent women not in their first youth,\nand when Gurov grew cold to them their beauty excited his hatred, and\nthe lace on their linen seemed to him like scales.\n\nBut in this case there was still the diffidence, the angularity of\ninexperienced youth, an awkward feeling; and there was a sense of\nconsternation as though some one had suddenly knocked at the door. The\nattitude of Anna Sergeyevna--\"the lady with the dog\"--to what had\nhappened was somehow peculiar, very grave, as though it were her\nfall--so it seemed, and it was strange and inappropriate. Her face\ndropped and faded, and on both sides of it her long hair hung down\nmournfully; she mused in a dejected attitude like \"the woman who was a\nsinner\" in an old-fashioned picture.\n\n\"It's wrong,\" she said. \"You will be the first to despise me now.\"\n\nThere was a water-melon on the table. Gurov cut himself a slice and\nbegan eating it without haste. There followed at least half an hour of\nsilence.\n\nAnna Sergeyevna was touching; there was about her the purity of a good,\nsimple woman who had seen little of life. The solitary candle burning on\nthe table threw a faint light on her face, yet it was clear that she was\nvery unhappy.\n\n\"How could I despise you?\" asked Gurov. \"You don't know what you are\nsaying.\"\n\n\"God forgive me,\" she said, and her eyes filled with tears. \"It's\nawful.\"\n\n\"You seem to feel you need to be forgiven.\"\n\n\"Forgiven? No. I am a bad, low woman; I despise myself and don't attempt\nto justify myself. It's not my husband but myself I have deceived. And\nnot only just now; I have been deceiving myself for a long time. My\nhusband may be a good, honest man, but he is a flunkey! I don't know\nwhat he does there, what his work is, but I know he is a flunkey! I was\ntwenty when I was married to him. I have been tormented by curiosity; I\nwanted something better. 'There must be a different sort of life,' I\nsaid to myself. I wanted to live! To live, to live!... I was fired by\ncuriosity ... you don't understand it, but, I swear to God, I could not\ncontrol myself; something happened to me: I could not be restrained. I\ntold my husband I was ill, and came here.... And here I have been\nwalking about as though I were dazed, like a mad creature; ... and now I\nhave become a vulgar, contemptible woman whom any one may despise.\"\n\nGurov felt bored already, listening to her. He was irritated by the\nnaive tone, by this remorse, so unexpected and inopportune; but for the\ntears in her eyes, he might have thought she was jesting or playing a\npart.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" he said softly. \"What is it you want?\"\n\nShe hid her face on his breast and pressed close to him.\n\n\"Believe me, believe me, I beseech you ...\" she said. \"I love a pure,\nhonest life, and sin is loathsome to me. I don't know what I am doing.\nSimple people say: 'The Evil One has beguiled me.' And I may say of\nmyself now that the Evil One has beguiled me.\"\n\n\"Hush, hush!...\" he muttered.\n\nHe looked at her fixed, scared eyes, kissed her, talked softly and\naffectionately, and by degrees she was comforted, and her gaiety\nreturned; they both began laughing.\n\nAfterwards when they went out there was not a soul on the sea-front. The\ntown with its cypresses had quite a deathlike air, but the sea still\nbroke noisily on the shore; a single barge was rocking on the waves, and\na lantern was blinking sleepily on it.\n\nThey found a cab and drove to Oreanda.\n\n\"I found out your surname in the hall just now: it was written on the\nboard--Von Diderits,\" said Gurov. \"Is your husband a German?\"\n\n\"No; I believe his grandfather was a German, but he is an Orthodox\nRussian himself.\"\n\nAt Oreanda they sat on a seat not far from the church, looked down at\nthe sea, and were silent. Yalta was hardly visible through the morning\nmist; white clouds stood motionless on the mountain-tops. The leaves did\nnot stir on the trees, grasshoppers chirruped, and the monotonous hollow\nsound of the sea rising up from below, spoke of the peace, of the\neternal sleep awaiting us. So it must have sounded when there was no\nYalta, no Oreanda here; so it sounds now, and it will sound as\nindifferently and monotonously when we are all no more. And in this\nconstancy, in this complete indifference to the life and death of each\nof us, there lies hid, perhaps, a pledge of our eternal salvation, of\nthe unceasing movement of life upon earth, of unceasing progress towards\nperfection. Sitting beside a young woman who in the dawn seemed so\nlovely, soothed and spellbound in these magical surroundings--the sea,\nmountains, clouds, the open sky--Gurov thought how in reality everything\nis beautiful in this world when one reflects: everything except what we\nthink or do ourselves when we forget our human dignity and the higher\naims of our existence.\n\nA man walked up to them--probably a keeper--looked at them and walked\naway. And this detail seemed mysterious and beautiful, too. They saw a\nsteamer come from Theodosia, with its lights out in the glow of dawn.\n\n\"There is dew on the grass,\" said Anna Sergeyevna, after a silence.\n\n\"Yes. It's time to go home.\"\n\nThey went back to the town.\n\nThen they met every day at twelve o'clock on the sea-front, lunched and\ndined together, went for walks, admired the sea. She complained that she\nslept badly, that her heart throbbed violently; asked the same\nquestions, troubled now by jealousy and now by the fear that he did not\nrespect her sufficiently. And often in the square or gardens, when there\nwas no one near them, he suddenly drew her to him and kissed her\npassionately. Complete idleness, these kisses in broad daylight while he\nlooked round in dread of some one's seeing them, the heat, the smell of\nthe sea, and the continual passing to and fro before him of idle,\nwell-dressed, well-fed people, made a new man of him; he told Anna\nSergeyevna how beautiful she was, how fascinating. He was impatiently\npassionate, he would not move a step away from her, while she was often\npensive and continually urged him to confess that he did not respect\nher, did not love her in the least, and thought of her as nothing but a\ncommon woman. Rather late almost every evening they drove somewhere out\nof town, to Oreanda or to the waterfall; and the expedition was always a\nsuccess, the scenery invariably impressed them as grand and beautiful.\n\nThey were expecting her husband to come, but a letter came from him,\nsaying that there was something wrong with his eyes, and he entreated\nhis wife to come home as quickly as possible. Anna Sergeyevna made haste\nto go.\n\n\"It's a good thing I am going away,\" she said to Gurov. \"It's the finger\nof destiny!\"\n\nShe went by coach and he went with her. They were driving the whole day.\nWhen she had got into a compartment of the express, and when the second\nbell had rung, she said:\n\n\"Let me look at you once more ... look at you once again. That's right.\"\n\nShe did not shed tears, but was so sad that she seemed ill, and her face\nwas quivering.\n\n\"I shall remember you ... think of you,\" she said. \"God be with you; be\nhappy. Don't remember evil against me. We are parting forever--it must\nbe so, for we ought never to have met. Well, God be with you.\"\n\nThe train moved off rapidly, its lights soon vanished from sight, and a\nminute later there was no sound of it, as though everything had\nconspired together to end as quickly as possible that sweet delirium,\nthat madness. Left alone on the platform, and gazing into the dark\ndistance, Gurov listened to the chirrup of the grasshoppers and the hum\nof the telegraph wires, feeling as though he had only just waked up. And\nhe thought, musing, that there had been another episode or adventure in\nhis life, and it, too, was at an end, and nothing was left of it but a\nmemory.... He was moved, sad, and conscious of a slight remorse. This\nyoung woman whom he would never meet again had not been happy with him;\nhe was genuinely warm and affectionate with her, but yet in his manner,\nhis tone, and his caresses there had been a shade of light irony, the\ncoarse condescension of a happy man who was, besides, almost twice her\nage. All the time she had called him kind, exceptional, lofty; obviously\nhe had seemed to her different from what he really was, so he had\nunintentionally deceived her....\n\nHere at the station was already a scent of autumn; it was a cold\nevening.\n\n\"It's time for me to go north,\" thought Gurov as he left the platform.\n\"High time!\"\n\n\nIII\n\nAt home in Moscow everything was in its winter routine; the stoves were\nheated, and in the morning it was still dark when the children were\nhaving breakfast and getting ready for school, and the nurse would light\nthe lamp for a short time. The frosts had begun already. When the first\nsnow has fallen, on the first day of sledge-driving it is pleasant to\nsee the white earth, the white roofs, to draw soft, delicious breath,\nand the season brings back the days of one's youth. The old limes and\nbirches, white with hoar-frost, have a good-natured expression; they are\nnearer to one's heart than cypresses and palms, and near them one\ndoesn't want to be thinking of the sea and the mountains.\n\nGurov was Moscow born; he arrived in Moscow on a fine frosty day, and\nwhen he put on his fur coat and warm gloves, and walked along Petrovka,\nand when on Saturday evening he heard the ringing of the bells, his\nrecent trip and the places he had seen lost all charm for him. Little by\nlittle he became absorbed in Moscow life, greedily read three newspapers\na day, and declared he did not read the Moscow papers on principle! He\nalready felt a longing to go to restaurants, clubs, dinner-parties,\nanniversary celebrations, and he felt flattered at entertaining\ndistinguished lawyers and artists, and at playing cards with a professor\nat the doctors' club. He could already eat a whole plateful of salt fish\nand cabbage.\n\nIn another month, he fancied, the image of Anna Sergeyevna would be\nshrouded in a mist in his memory, and only from time to time would visit\nhim in his dreams with a touching smile as others did. But more than a\nmonth passed, real winter had come, and everything was still clear in\nhis memory as though he had parted with Anna Sergeyevna only the day\nbefore. And his memories glowed more and more vividly. When in the\nevening stillness he heard from his study the voices of his children,\npreparing their lessons, or when he listened to a song or the organ at\nthe restaurant, or the storm howled in the chimney, suddenly everything\nwould rise up in his memory: what had happened on the groyne, and the\nearly morning with the mist on the mountains, and the steamer coming\nfrom Theodosia, and the kisses. He would pace a long time about his\nroom, remembering it all and smiling; then his memories passed into\ndreams, and in his fancy the past was mingled with what was to come.\nAnna Sergeyevna did not visit him in dreams, but followed him about\neverywhere like a shadow and haunted him. When he shut his eyes he saw\nher as though she were living before him, and she seemed to him\nlovelier, younger, tenderer than she was; and he imagined himself finer\nthan he had been in Yalta. In the evenings she peeped out at him from\nthe bookcase, from the fireplace, from the corner--he heard her\nbreathing, the caressing rustle of her dress. In the street he watched\nthe women, looking for some one like her.\n\nHe was tormented by an intense desire to confide his memories to some\none. But in his home it was impossible to talk of his love, and he had\nno one outside; he could not talk to his tenants nor to any one at the\nbank. And what had he to talk of? Had he been in love, then? Had there\nbeen anything beautiful, poetical, or edifying or simply interesting in\nhis relations with Anna Sergeyevna? And there was nothing for him but to\ntalk vaguely of love, of woman, and no one guessed what it meant; only\nhis wife twitched her black eyebrows, and said:\n\n\"The part of a lady-killer does not suit you at all, Dimitri.\"\n\nOne evening, coming out of the doctors' club with an official with whom\nhe had been playing cards, he could not resist saying:\n\n\"If only you knew what a fascinating woman I made the acquaintance of in\nYalta!\"\n\nThe official got into his sledge and was driving away, but turned\nsuddenly and shouted:\n\n\"Dmitri Dmitritch!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You were right this evening: the sturgeon was a bit too strong!\"\n\nThese words, so ordinary, for some reason moved Gurov to indignation,\nand struck him as degrading and unclean. What savage manners, what\npeople! What senseless nights, what uninteresting, uneventful days! The\nrage for card-playing, the gluttony, the drunkenness, the continual talk\nalways about the same thing. Useless pursuits and conversations always\nabout the same things absorb the better part of one's time, the better\npart of one's strength, and in the end there is left a life grovelling\nand curtailed, worthless and trivial, and there is no escaping or\ngetting away from it--just as though one were in a madhouse or a prison.\n\nGurov did not sleep all night, and was filled with indignation. And he\nhad a headache all next day. And the next night he slept badly; he sat\nup in bed, thinking, or paced up and down his room. He was sick of his\nchildren, sick of the bank; he had no desire to go anywhere or to talk\nof anything.\n\nIn the holidays in December he prepared for a journey, and told his wife\nhe was going to Petersburg to do something in the interests of a young\nfriend--and he set off for S----. What for? He did not very well know\nhimself. He wanted to see Anna Sergeyevna and to talk with her--to\narrange a meeting, if possible.\n\nHe reached S---- in the morning, and took the best room at the hotel, in\nwhich the floor was covered with grey army cloth, and on the table was\nan inkstand, grey with dust and adorned with a figure on horseback, with\nits hat in its hand and its head broken off. The hotel porter gave him\nthe necessary information; Von Diderits lived in a house of his own in\nOld Gontcharny Street--it was not far from the hotel: he was rich and\nlived in good style, and had his own horses; every one in the town knew\nhim. The porter pronounced the name \"Dridirits.\"\n\nGurov went without haste to Old Gontcharny Street and found the house.\nJust opposite the house stretched a long grey fence adorned with nails.\n\n\"One would run away from a fence like that,\" thought Gurov, looking from\nthe fence to the windows of the house and back again.\n\nHe considered: to-day was a holiday, and the husband would probably be\nat home. And in any case it would be tactless to go into the house and\nupset her. If he were to send her a note it might fall into her\nhusband's hands, and then it might ruin everything. The best thing was\nto trust to chance. And he kept walking up and down the street by the\nfence, waiting for the chance. He saw a beggar go in at the gate and\ndogs fly at him; then an hour later he heard a piano, and the sounds\nwere faint and indistinct. Probably it was Anna Sergeyevna playing. The\nfront door suddenly opened, and an old woman came out, followed by the\nfamiliar white Pomeranian. Gurov was on the point of calling to the dog,\nbut his heart began beating violently, and in his excitement he could\nnot remember the dog's name.\n\nHe walked up and down, and loathed the grey fence more and more, and by\nnow he thought irritably that Anna Sergeyevna had forgotten him, and was\nperhaps already amusing herself with some one else, and that that was\nvery natural in a young woman who had nothing to look at from morning\ntill night but that confounded fence. He went back to his hotel room and\nsat for a long while on the sofa, not knowing what to do, then he had\ndinner and a long nap.\n\n\"How stupid and worrying it is!\" he thought when he woke and looked at\nthe dark windows: it was already evening. \"Here I've had a good sleep\nfor some reason. What shall I do in the night?\"\n\nHe sat on the bed, which was covered by a cheap grey blanket, such as\none sees in hospitals, and he taunted himself in his vexation:\n\n\"So much for the lady with the dog ... so much for the adventure....\nYou're in a nice fix....\"\n\nThat morning at the station a poster in large letters had caught his\neye. \"The Geisha\" was to be performed for the first time. He thought of\nthis and went to the theatre.\n\n\"It's quite possible she may go to the first performance,\" he thought.\n\nThe theatre was full. As in all provincial theatres, there was a fog\nabove the chandelier, the gallery was noisy and restless; in the front\nrow the local dandies were standing up before the beginning of the\nperformance, with their hands behind them; in the Governor's box the\nGovernor's daughter, wearing a boa, was sitting in the front seat, while\nthe Governor himself lurked modestly behind the curtain with only his\nhands visible; the orchestra was a long time tuning up; the stage\ncurtain swayed. All the time the audience were coming in and taking\ntheir seats Gurov looked at them eagerly.\n\nAnna Sergeyevna, too, came in. She sat down in the third row, and when\nGurov looked at her his heart contracted, and he understood clearly that\nfor him there was in the whole world no creature so near, so precious,\nand so important to him; she, this little woman, in no way remarkable,\nlost in a provincial crowd, with a vulgar lorgnette in her hand, filled\nhis whole life now, was his sorrow and his joy, the one happiness that\nhe now desired for himself, and to the sounds of the inferior orchestra,\nof the wretched provincial violins, he thought how lovely she was. He\nthought and dreamed.\n\nA young man with small side-whiskers, tall and stooping, came in with\nAnna Sergeyevna and sat down beside her; he bent his head at every step\nand seemed to be continually bowing. Most likely this was the husband\nwhom at Yalta, in a rush of bitter feeling, she had called a flunkey.\nAnd there really was in his long figure, his side-whiskers, and the\nsmall bald patch on his head, something of the flunkey's obsequiousness;\nhis smile was sugary, and in his buttonhole there was some badge of\ndistinction like the number on a waiter.\n\nDuring the first interval the husband went away to smoke; she remained\nalone in her stall. Gurov, who was sitting in the stalls, too, went up\nto her and said in a trembling voice, with a forced smile:\n\n\"Good-evening.\"\n\nShe glanced at him and turned pale, then glanced again with horror,\nunable to believe her eyes, and tightly gripped the fan and the\nlorgnette in her hands, evidently struggling with herself not to faint.\nBoth were silent. She was sitting, he was standing, frightened by her\nconfusion and not venturing to sit down beside her. The violins and the\nflute began tuning up. He felt suddenly frightened; it seemed as though\nall the people in the boxes were looking at them. She got up and went\nquickly to the door; he followed her, and both walked senselessly along\npassages, and up and down stairs, and figures in legal, scholastic, and\ncivil service uniforms, all wearing badges, flitted before their eyes.\nThey caught glimpses of ladies, of fur coats hanging on pegs; the\ndraughts blew on them, bringing a smell of stale tobacco. And Gurov,\nwhose heart was beating violently, thought:\n\n\"Oh, heavens! Why are these people here and this orchestra!...\"\n\nAnd at that instant he recalled how when he had seen Anna Sergeyevna off\nat the station he had thought that everything was over and they would\nnever meet again. But how far they were still from the end!\n\nOn the narrow, gloomy staircase over which was written \"To the\nAmphitheatre,\" she stopped.\n\n\"How you have frightened me!\" she said, breathing hard, still pale and\noverwhelmed. \"Oh, how you have frightened me! I am half dead. Why have\nyou come? Why?\"\n\n\"But do understand, Anna, do understand ...\" he said hastily in a low\nvoice. \"I entreat you to understand....\"\n\nShe looked at him with dread, with entreaty, with love; she looked at\nhim intently, to keep his features more distinctly in her memory.\n\n\"I am so unhappy,\" she went on, not heeding him. \"I have thought of\nnothing but you all the time; I live only in the thought of you. And I\nwanted to forget, to forget you; but why, oh, why, have you come?\"\n\nOn the landing above them two schoolboys were smoking and looking down,\nbut that was nothing to Gurov; he drew Anna Sergeyevna to him, and began\nkissing her face, her cheeks, and her hands.\n\n\"What are you doing, what are you doing!\" she cried in horror, pushing\nhim away. \"We are mad. Go away to-day; go away at once.... I beseech you\nby all that is sacred, I implore you.... There are people coming this\nway!\"\n\nSome one was coming up the stairs.\n\n\"You must go away,\" Anna Sergeyevna went on in a whisper. \"Do you hear,\nDmitri Dmitritch? I will come and see you in Moscow. I have never been\nhappy; I am miserable now, and I never, never shall be happy, never!\nDon't make me suffer still more! I swear I'll come to Moscow. But now\nlet us part. My precious, good, dear one, we must part!\"\n\nShe pressed his hand and began rapidly going downstairs, looking round\nat him, and from her eyes he could see that she really was unhappy.\nGurov stood for a little while, listened, then, when all sound had died\naway, he found his coat and left the theatre.\n\n\nIV\n\nAnd Anna Sergeyevna began coming to see him in Moscow. Once in two or\nthree months she left S----, telling her husband that she was going to\nconsult a doctor about an internal complaint--and her husband believed\nher, and did not believe her. In Moscow she stayed at the Slaviansky\nBazaar hotel, and at once sent a man in a red cap to Gurov. Gurov went\nto see her, and no one in Moscow knew of it.\n\nOnce he was going to see her in this way on a winter morning (the\nmessenger had come the evening before when he was out). With him walked\nhis daughter, whom he wanted to take to school: it was on the way. Snow\nwas falling in big wet flakes.\n\n\"It's three degrees above freezing-point, and yet it is snowing,\" said\nGurov to his daughter. \"The thaw is only on the surface of the earth;\nthere is quite a different temperature at a greater height in the\natmosphere.\"\n\n\"And why are there no thunderstorms in the winter, father?\"\n\nHe explained that, too. He talked, thinking all the while that he was\ngoing to see her, and no living soul knew of it, and probably never\nwould know. He had two lives: one, open, seen and known by all who cared\nto know, full of relative truth and of relative falsehood, exactly like\nthe lives of his friends and acquaintances; and another life running its\ncourse in secret. And through some strange, perhaps accidental,\nconjunction of circumstances, everything that was essential, of interest\nand of value to him, everything in which he was sincere and did not\ndeceive himself, everything that made the kernel of his life, was hidden\nfrom other people; and all that was false in him, the sheath in which he\nhid himself to conceal the truth--such, for instance, as his work in the\nbank, his discussions at the club, his \"lower race,\" his presence with\nhis wife at anniversary festivities--all that was open. And he judged of\nothers by himself, not believing in what he saw, and always believing\nthat every man had his real, most interesting life under the cover of\nsecrecy and under the cover of night. All personal life rested on\nsecrecy, and possibly it was partly on that account that civilised man\nwas so nervously anxious that personal privacy should be respected.\n\nAfter leaving his daughter at school, Gurov went on to the Slaviansky\nBazaar. He took off his fur coat below, went upstairs, and softly\nknocked at the door. Anna Sergeyevna, wearing his favourite grey dress,\nexhausted by the journey and the suspense, had been expecting him since\nthe evening before. She was pale; she looked at him, and did not smile,\nand he had hardly come in when she fell on his breast. Their kiss was\nslow and prolonged, as though they had not met for two years.\n\n\"Well, how are you getting on there?\" he asked. \"What news?\"\n\n\"Wait; I'll tell you directly.... I can't talk.\"\n\nShe could not speak; she was crying. She turned away from him, and\npressed her handkerchief to her eyes.\n\n\"Let her have her cry out. I'll sit down and wait,\" he thought, and he\nsat down in an arm-chair.\n\nThen he rang and asked for tea to be brought him, and while he drank his\ntea she remained standing at the window with her back to him. She was\ncrying from emotion, from the miserable consciousness that their life\nwas so hard for them; they could only meet in secret, hiding themselves\nfrom people, like thieves! Was not their life shattered?\n\n\"Come, do stop!\" he said.\n\nIt was evident to him that this love of theirs would not soon be over,\nthat he could not see the end of it. Anna Sergeyevna grew more and more\nattached to him. She adored him, and it was unthinkable to say to her\nthat it was bound to have an end some day; besides, she would not have\nbelieved it!\n\nHe went up to her and took her by the shoulders to say something\naffectionate and cheering, and at that moment he saw himself in the\nlooking-glass.\n\nHis hair was already beginning to turn grey. And it seemed strange to\nhim that he had grown so much older, so much plainer during the last few\nyears. The shoulders on which his hands rested were warm and quivering.\nHe felt compassion for this life, still so warm and lovely, but probably\nalready not far from beginning to fade and wither like his own. Why did\nshe love him so much? He always seemed to women different from what he\nwas, and they loved in him not himself, but the man created by their\nimagination, whom they had been eagerly seeking all their lives; and\nafterwards, when they noticed their mistake, they loved him all the\nsame. And not one of them had been happy with him. Time passed, he had\nmade their acquaintance, got on with them, parted, but he had never once\nloved; it was anything you like, but not love.\n\nAnd only now when his head was grey he had fallen properly, really in\nlove--for the first time in his life.\n\nAnna Sergeyevna and he loved each other like people very close and akin,\nlike husband and wife, like tender friends; it seemed to them that fate\nitself had meant them for one another, and they could not understand why\nhe had a wife and she a husband; and it was as though they were a pair\nof birds of passage, caught and forced to live in different cages. They\nforgave each other for what they were ashamed of in their past, they\nforgave everything in the present, and felt that this love of theirs had\nchanged them both.\n\nIn moments of depression in the past he had comforted himself with any\narguments that came into his mind, but now he no longer cared for\narguments; he felt profound compassion, he wanted to be sincere and\ntender....\n\n\"Don't cry, my darling,\" he said. \"You've had your cry; that's\nenough.... Let us talk now, let us think of some plan.\"\n\nThen they spent a long while taking counsel together, talked of how to\navoid the necessity for secrecy, for deception, for living in different\ntowns and not seeing each other for long at a time. How could they be\nfree from this intolerable bondage?\n\n\"How? How?\" he asked, clutching his head. \"How?\"\n\nAnd it seemed as though in a little while the solution would be found,\nand then a new and splendid life would begin; and it was clear to both\nof them that they had still a long, long road before them, and that the\nmost complicated and difficult part of it was only just beginning.\n\n\n\n\nA DOCTOR'S VISIT\n\n\nTHE Professor received a telegram from the Lyalikovs' factory; he was\nasked to come as quickly as possible. The daughter of some Madame\nLyalikov, apparently the owner of the factory, was ill, and that was all\nthat one could make out of the long, incoherent telegram. And the\nProfessor did not go himself, but sent instead his assistant, Korolyov.\n\nIt was two stations from Moscow, and there was a drive of three miles\nfrom the station. A carriage with three horses had been sent to the\nstation to meet Korolyov; the coachman wore a hat with a peacock's\nfeather on it, and answered every question in a loud voice like a\nsoldier: \"No, sir!\" \"Certainly, sir!\"\n\nIt was Saturday evening; the sun was setting, the workpeople were coming\nin crowds from the factory to the station, and they bowed to the\ncarriage in which Korolyov was driving. And he was charmed with the\nevening, the farmhouses and villas on the road, and the birch-trees, and\nthe quiet atmosphere all around, when the fields and woods and the sun\nseemed preparing, like the workpeople now on the eve of the holiday, to\nrest, and perhaps to pray....\n\nHe was born and had grown up in Moscow; he did not know the country, and\nhe had never taken any interest in factories, or been inside one, but he\nhad happened to read about factories, and had been in the houses of\nmanufacturers and had talked to them; and whenever he saw a factory far\nor near, he always thought how quiet and peaceable it was outside, but\nwithin there was always sure to be impenetrable ignorance and dull\negoism on the side of the owners, wearisome, unhealthy toil on the side\nof the workpeople, squabbling, vermin, vodka. And now when the\nworkpeople timidly and respectfully made way for the carriage, in their\nfaces, their caps, their walk, he read physical impurity, drunkenness,\nnervous exhaustion, bewilderment.\n\nThey drove in at the factory gates. On each side he caught glimpses of\nthe little houses of workpeople, of the faces of women, of quilts and\nlinen on the railings. \"Look out!\" shouted the coachman, not pulling up\nthe horses. It was a wide courtyard without grass, with five immense\nblocks of buildings with tall chimneys a little distance one from\nanother, warehouses and barracks, and over everything a sort of grey\npowder as though from dust. Here and there, like oases in the desert,\nthere were pitiful gardens, and the green and red roofs of the houses in\nwhich the managers and clerks lived. The coachman suddenly pulled up the\nhorses, and the carriage stopped at the house, which had been newly\npainted grey; here was a flower garden, with a lilac bush covered with\ndust, and on the yellow steps at the front door there was a strong smell\nof paint.\n\n\"Please come in, doctor,\" said women's voices in the passage and the\nentry, and at the same time he heard sighs and whisperings. \"Pray walk\nin.... We've been expecting you so long ... we're in real trouble. Here,\nthis way.\"\n\nMadame Lyalikov--a stout elderly lady wearing a black silk dress with\nfashionable sleeves, but, judging from her face, a simple uneducated\nwoman--looked at the doctor in a flutter, and could not bring herself to\nhold out her hand to him; she did not dare. Beside her stood a personage\nwith short hair and a pince-nez; she was wearing a blouse of many\ncolours, and was very thin and no longer young. The servants called her\nChristina Dmitryevna, and Korolyov guessed that this was the governess.\nProbably, as the person of most education in the house, she had been\ncharged to meet and receive the doctor, for she began immediately, in\ngreat haste, stating the causes of the illness, giving trivial and\ntiresome details, but without saying who was ill or what was the matter.\n\nThe doctor and the governess were sitting talking while the lady of the\nhouse stood motionless at the door, waiting. From the conversation\nKorolyov learned that the patient was Madame Lyalikov's only daughter\nand heiress, a girl of twenty, called Liza; she had been ill for a long\ntime, and had consulted various doctors, and the previous night she had\nsuffered till morning from such violent palpitations of the heart, that\nno one in the house had slept, and they had been afraid she might die.\n\n\"She has been, one may say, ailing from a child,\" said Christina\nDmitryevna in a sing-song voice, continually wiping her lips with her\nhand. \"The doctors say it is nerves; when she was a little girl she was\nscrofulous, and the doctors drove it inwards, so I think it may be due\nto that.\"\n\nThey went to see the invalid. Fully grown up, big and tall, but ugly\nlike her mother, with the same little eyes and disproportionate breadth\nof the lower part of the face, lying with her hair in disorder, muffled\nup to the chin, she made upon Korolyov at the first minute the\nimpression of a poor, destitute creature, sheltered and cared for here\nout of charity, and he could hardly believe that this was the heiress of\nthe five huge buildings.\n\n\"I am the doctor come to see you,\" said Korolyov. \"Good evening.\"\n\nHe mentioned his name and pressed her hand, a large, cold, ugly hand;\nshe sat up, and, evidently accustomed to doctors, let herself be\nsounded, without showing the least concern that her shoulders and chest\nwere uncovered.\n\n\"I have palpitations of the heart,\" she said, \"It was so awful all\nnight.... I almost died of fright! Do give me something.\"\n\n\"I will, I will; don't worry yourself.\"\n\nKorolyov examined her and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"The heart is all right,\" he said; \"it's all going on satisfactorily;\neverything is in good order. Your nerves must have been playing pranks a\nlittle, but that's so common. The attack is over by now, one must\nsuppose; lie down and go to sleep.\"\n\nAt that moment a lamp was brought into the bed-room. The patient screwed\nup her eyes at the light, then suddenly put her hands to her head and\nbroke into sobs. And the impression of a destitute, ugly creature\nvanished, and Korolyov no longer noticed the little eyes or the heavy\ndevelopment of the lower part of the face. He saw a soft, suffering\nexpression which was intelligent and touching: she seemed to him\naltogether graceful, feminine, and simple; and he longed to soothe her,\nnot with drugs, not with advice, but with simple, kindly words. Her\nmother put her arms round her head and hugged her. What despair, what\ngrief was in the old woman's face! She, her mother, had reared her and\nbrought her up, spared nothing, and devoted her whole life to having her\ndaughter taught French, dancing, music: had engaged a dozen teachers for\nher; had consulted the best doctors, kept a governess. And now she could\nnot make out the reason of these tears, why there was all this misery,\nshe could not understand, and was bewildered; and she had a guilty,\nagitated, despairing expression, as though she had omitted something\nvery important, had left something undone, had neglected to call in\nsomebody--and whom, she did not know.\n\n\"Lizanka, you are crying again ... again,\" she said, hugging her\ndaughter to her. \"My own, my darling, my child, tell me what it is! Have\npity on me! Tell me.\"\n\nBoth wept bitterly. Korolyov sat down on the side of the bed and took\nLiza's hand.\n\n\"Come, give over; it's no use crying,\" he said kindly. \"Why, there is\nnothing in the world that is worth those tears. Come, we won't cry;\nthat's no good....\"\n\nAnd inwardly he thought:\n\n\"It's high time she was married....\"\n\n\"Our doctor at the factory gave her kalibromati,\" said the governess,\n\"but I notice it only makes her worse. I should have thought that if she\nis given anything for the heart it ought to be drops.... I forget the\nname.... Convallaria, isn't it?\"\n\nAnd there followed all sorts of details. She interrupted the doctor,\npreventing his speaking, and there was a look of effort on her face, as\nthough she supposed that, as the woman of most education in the house,\nshe was duty bound to keep up a conversation with the doctor, and on no\nother subject but medicine.\n\nKorolyov felt bored.\n\n\"I find nothing special the matter,\" he said, addressing the mother as\nhe went out of the bedroom. \"If your daughter is being attended by the\nfactory doctor, let him go on attending her. The treatment so far has\nbeen perfectly correct, and I see no reason for changing your doctor.\nWhy change? It's such an ordinary trouble; there's nothing seriously\nwrong.\"\n\nHe spoke deliberately as he put on his gloves, while Madame Lyalikov\nstood without moving, and looked at him with her tearful eyes.\n\n\"I have half an hour to catch the ten o'clock train,\" he said. \"I hope I\nam not too late.\"\n\n\"And can't you stay?\" she asked, and tears trickled down her cheeks\nagain. \"I am ashamed to trouble you, but if you would be so good.... For\nGod's sake,\" she went on in an undertone, glancing towards the door, \"do\nstay to-night with us! She is all I have ... my only daughter.... She\nfrightened me last night; I can't get over it.... Don't go away, for\ngoodness' sake!...\"\n\nHe wanted to tell her that he had a great deal of work in Moscow, that\nhis family were expecting him home; it was disagreeable to him to spend\nthe evening and the whole night in a strange house quite needlessly; but\nhe looked at her face, heaved a sigh, and began taking off his gloves\nwithout a word.\n\nAll the lamps and candles were lighted in his honour in the drawing-room\nand the dining-room. He sat down at the piano and began turning over the\nmusic. Then he looked at the pictures on the walls, at the portraits.\nThe pictures, oil-paintings in gold frames, were views of the Crimea--a\nstormy sea with a ship, a Catholic monk with a wineglass; they were all\ndull, smooth daubs, with no trace of talent in them. There was not a\nsingle good-looking face among the portraits, nothing but broad\ncheekbones and astonished-looking eyes. Lyalikov, Liza's father, had a\nlow forehead and a self-satisfied expression; his uniform sat like a\nsack on his bulky plebeian figure; on his breast was a medal and a Red\nCross Badge. There was little sign of culture, and the luxury was\nsenseless and haphazard, and was as ill fitting as that uniform. The\nfloors irritated him with their brilliant polish, the lustres on the\nchandelier irritated him, and he was reminded for some reason of the\nstory of the merchant who used to go to the baths with a medal on his\nneck....\n\nHe heard a whispering in the entry; some one was softly snoring. And\nsuddenly from outside came harsh, abrupt, metallic sounds, such as\nKorolyov had never heard before, and which he did not understand now;\nthey roused strange, unpleasant echoes in his soul.\n\n\"I believe nothing would induce me to remain here to live ...\" he\nthought, and went back to the music-books again.\n\n\"Doctor, please come to supper!\" the governess called him in a low\nvoice.\n\nHe went into supper. The table was large and laid with a vast number of\ndishes and wines, but there were only two to supper: himself and\nChristina Dmitryevna. She drank Madeira, ate rapidly, and talked,\nlooking at him through her pince-nez:\n\n\"Our workpeople are very contented. We have performances at the factory\nevery winter; the workpeople act themselves. They have lectures with a\nmagic lantern, a splendid tea-room, and everything they want. They are\nvery much attached to us, and when they heard that Lizanka was worse\nthey had a service sung for her. Though they have no education, they\nhave their feelings, too.\"\n\n\"It looks as though you have no man in the house at all,\" said Korolyov.\n\n\"Not one. Pyotr Nikanoritch died a year and a half ago, and left us\nalone. And so there are the three of us. In the summer we live here, and\nin winter we live in Moscow, in Polianka. I have been living with them\nfor eleven years--as one of the family.\"\n\nAt supper they served sterlet, chicken rissoles, and stewed fruit; the\nwines were expensive French wines.\n\n\"Please don't stand on ceremony, doctor,\" said Christina Dmitryevna,\neating and wiping her mouth with her fist, and it was evident she found\nher life here exceedingly pleasant. \"Please have some more.\"\n\nAfter supper the doctor was shown to his room, where a bed had been made\nup for him, but he did not feel sleepy. The room was stuffy and it smelt\nof paint; he put on his coat and went out.\n\nIt was cool in the open air; there was already a glimmer of dawn, and\nall the five blocks of buildings, with their tall chimneys, barracks,\nand warehouses, were distinctly outlined against the damp air. As it was\na holiday, they were not working, and the windows were dark, and in only\none of the buildings was there a furnace burning; two windows were\ncrimson, and fire mixed with smoke came from time to time from the\nchimney. Far away beyond the yard the frogs were croaking and the\nnightingales singing.\n\nLooking at the factory buildings and the barracks, where the workpeople\nwere asleep, he thought again what he always thought when he saw a\nfactory. They may have performances for the workpeople, magic lanterns,\nfactory doctors, and improvements of all sorts, but, all the same, the\nworkpeople he had met that day on his way from the station did not look\nin any way different from those he had known long ago in his childhood,\nbefore there were factory performances and improvements. As a doctor\naccustomed to judging correctly of chronic complaints, the radical cause\nof which was incomprehensible and incurable, he looked upon factories as\nsomething baffling, the cause of which also was obscure and not\nremovable, and all the improvements in the life of the factory hands he\nlooked upon not as superfluous, but as comparable with the treatment of\nincurable illnesses.\n\n\"There is something baffling in it, of course ...\" he thought, looking\nat the crimson windows. \"Fifteen hundred or two thousand workpeople are\nworking without rest in unhealthy surroundings, making bad cotton goods,\nliving on the verge of starvation, and only waking from this nightmare\nat rare intervals in the tavern; a hundred people act as overseers, and\nthe whole life of that hundred is spent in imposing fines, in abuse, in\ninjustice, and only two or three so-called owners enjoy the profits,\nthough they don't work at all, and despise the wretched cotton. But what\nare the profits, and how do they enjoy them? Madame Lyalikov and her\ndaughter are unhappy--it makes one wretched to look at them; the only\none who enjoys her life is Christina Dmitryevna, a stupid, middle-aged\nmaiden lady in pince-nez. And so it appears that all these five blocks\nof buildings are at work, and inferior cotton is sold in the Eastern\nmarkets, simply that Christina Dmitryevna may eat sterlet and drink\nMadeira.\"\n\nSuddenly there came a strange noise, the same sound Korolyov had heard\nbefore supper. Some one was striking on a sheet of metal near one of the\nbuildings; he struck a note, and then at once checked the vibrations, so\nthat short, abrupt, discordant sounds were produced, rather like \"Dair\n... dair ... dair....\" Then there was half a minute of stillness, and\nfrom another building there came sounds equally abrupt and unpleasant,\nlower bass notes: \"Drin ... drin ... drin ...\" Eleven times. Evidently\nit was the watchman striking the hour. Near the third building he heard:\n\"Zhuk ... zhuk ... zhuk....\" And so near all the buildings, and then\nbehind the barracks and beyond the gates. And in the stillness of the\nnight it seemed as though these sounds were uttered by a monster with\ncrimson eyes--the devil himself, who controlled the owners and the\nwork-people alike, and was deceiving both.\n\nKorolyov went out of the yard into the open country.\n\n\"Who goes there?\" some one called to him at the gates in an abrupt\nvoice.\n\n\"It's just like being in prison,\" he thought, and made no answer.\n\nHere the nightingales and the frogs could be heard more distinctly, and\none could feel it was a night in May. From the station came the noise of\na train; somewhere in the distance drowsy cocks were crowing; but, all\nthe same, the night was still, the world was sleeping tranquilly. In a\nfield not far from the factory there could be seen the framework of a\nhouse and heaps of building material:\n\nKorolyov sat down on the planks and went on thinking.\n\n\"The only person who feels happy here is the governess, and the factory\nhands are working for her gratification. But that's only apparent: she\nis only the figurehead. The real person, for whom everything is being\ndone, is the devil.\"\n\nAnd he thought about the devil, in whom he did not believe, and he\nlooked round at the two windows where the fires were gleaming. It seemed\nto him that out of those crimson eyes the devil himself was looking at\nhim--that unknown force that had created the mutual relation of the\nstrong and the weak, that coarse blunder which one could never correct.\nThe strong must hinder the weak from living--such was the law of\nNature; but only in a newspaper article or in a school book was that\nintelligible and easily accepted. In the hotchpotch which was everyday\nlife, in the tangle of trivialities out of which human relations were\nwoven, it was no longer a law, but a logical absurdity, when the strong\nand the weak were both equally victims of their mutual relations,\nunwillingly submitting to some directing force, unknown, standing\noutside life, apart from man.\n\nSo thought Korolyov, sitting on the planks, and little by little he was\npossessed by a feeling that this unknown and mysterious force was really\nclose by and looking at him. Meanwhile the east was growing paler, time\npassed rapidly; when there was not a soul anywhere near, as though\neverything were dead, the five buildings and their chimneys against the\ngrey background of the dawn had a peculiar look--not the same as by day;\none forgot altogether that inside there were steam motors, electricity,\ntelephones, and kept thinking of lake-dwellings, of the Stone Age,\nfeeling the presence of a crude, unconscious force....\n\nAnd again there came the sound: \"Dair ... dair ... dair ... dair ...\"\ntwelve times. Then there was stillness, stillness for half a minute, and\nat the other end of the yard there rang out.\n\n\"Drin ... drin ... drin....\"\n\n\"Horribly disagreeable,\" thought Korolyov.\n\n\"Zhuk ... zhuk ...\" there resounded from a third place, abruptly,\nsharply, as though with annoyance--\"Zhuk ... zhuk....\"\n\nAnd it took four minutes to strike twelve. Then there was a hush; and\nagain it seemed as though everything were dead.\n\nKorolyov sat a little longer, then went to the house, but sat up for a\ngood while longer. In the adjoining rooms there was whispering, there\nwas a sound of shuffling slippers and bare feet.\n\n\"Is she having another attack?\" thought Korolyov.\n\nHe went out to have a look at the patient. By now it was quite light in\nthe rooms, and a faint glimmer of sunlight, piercing through the morning\nmist, quivered on the floor and on the wall of the drawing-room. The\ndoor of Liza's room was open, and she was sitting in a low chair beside\nher bed, with her hair down, wearing a dressing-gown and wrapped in a\nshawl. The blinds were down on the windows.\n\n\"How do you feel?\" asked Korolyov.\n\n\"Well, thank you.\"\n\nHe touched her pulse, then straightened her hair, that had fallen over\nher forehead.\n\n\"You are not asleep,\" he said. \"It's beautiful weather outside. It's\nspring. The nightingales are singing, and you sit in the dark and think\nof something.\"\n\nShe listened and looked into his face; her eyes were sorrowful and\nintelligent, and it was evident she wanted to say something to him.\n\n\"Does this happen to you often?\" he said.\n\nShe moved her lips, and answered:\n\n\"Often, I feel wretched almost every night.\"\n\nAt that moment the watchman in the yard began striking two o'clock. They\nheard: \"Dair ... dair ...\" and she shuddered.\n\n\"Do those knockings worry you?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't know. Everything here worries me,\" she answered, and pondered.\n\"Everything worries me. I hear sympathy in your voice; it seemed to me\nas soon as I saw you that I could tell you all about it.\"\n\n\"Tell me, I beg you.\"\n\n\"I want to tell you of my opinion. It seems to me that I have no\nillness, but that I am weary and frightened, because it is bound to be\nso and cannot be otherwise. Even the healthiest person can't help being\nuneasy if, for instance, a robber is moving about under his window. I am\nconstantly being doctored,\" she went on, looking at her knees, and she\ngave a shy smile. \"I am very grateful, of course, and I do not deny that\nthe treatment is a benefit; but I should like to talk, not with a\ndoctor, but with some intimate friend who would understand me and would\nconvince me that I was right or wrong.\"\n\n\"Have you no friends?\" asked Korolyov.\n\n\"I am lonely. I have a mother; I love her, but, all the same, I am\nlonely. That's how it happens to be.... Lonely people read a great deal,\nbut say little and hear little. Life for them is mysterious; they are\nmystics and often see the devil where he is not. Lermontov's Tamara was\nlonely and she saw the devil.\"\n\n\"Do you read a great deal?\"\n\n\"Yes. You see, my whole time is free from morning till night. I read by\nday, and by night my head is empty; instead of thoughts there are\nshadows in it.\"\n\n\"Do you see anything at night?\" asked Korolyov.\n\n\"No, but I feel....\"\n\nShe smiled again, raised her eyes to the doctor, and looked at him so\nsorrowfully, so intelligently; and it seemed to him that she trusted\nhim, and that she wanted to speak frankly to him, and that she thought\nthe same as he did. But she was silent, perhaps waiting for him to\nspeak.\n\nAnd he knew what to say to her. It was clear to him that she needed as\nquickly as possible to give up the five buildings and the million if she\nhad it--to leave that devil that looked out at night; it was clear to\nhim, too, that she thought so herself, and was only waiting for some one\nshe trusted to confirm her.\n\nBut he did not know how to say it. How? One is shy of asking men under\nsentence what they have been sentenced for; and in the same way it is\nawkward to ask very rich people what they want so much money for, why\nthey make such a poor use of their wealth, why they don't give it up,\neven when they see in it their unhappiness; and if they begin a\nconversation about it themselves, it is usually embarrassing, awkward,\nand long.\n\n\"How is one to say it?\" Korolyov wondered. \"And is it necessary to\nspeak?\"\n\nAnd he said what he meant in a roundabout way:\n\n\"You in the position of a factory owner and a wealthy heiress are\ndissatisfied; you don't believe in your right to it; and here now you\ncan't sleep. That, of course, is better than if you were satisfied,\nslept soundly, and thought everything was satisfactory. Your\nsleeplessness does you credit; in any case, it is a good sign. In\nreality, such a conversation as this between us now would have been\nunthinkable for our parents. At night they did not talk, but slept\nsound; we, our generation, sleep badly, are restless, but talk a great\ndeal, and are always trying to settle whether we are right or not. For\nour children or grandchildren that question--whether they are right or\nnot--will have been settled. Things will be clearer for them than for\nus. Life will be good in fifty years' time; it's only a pity we shall\nnot last out till then. It would be interesting to have a peep at it.\"\n\n\"What will our children and grandchildren do?\" asked Liza.\n\n\"I don't know.... I suppose they will throw it all up and go away.\"\n\n\"Go where?\"\n\n\"Where?... Why, where they like,\" said Korolyov; and he laughed. \"There\nare lots of places a good, intelligent person can go to.\"\n\nHe glanced at his watch.\n\n\"The sun has risen, though,\" he said. \"It is time you were asleep.\nUndress and sleep soundly. Very glad to have made your acquaintance,\" he\nwent on, pressing her hand. \"You are a good, interesting woman.\nGood-night!\"\n\nHe went to his room and went to bed.\n\nIn the morning when the carriage was brought round they all came out on\nto the steps to see him off. Liza, pale and exhausted, was in a white\ndress as though for a holiday, with a flower in her hair; she looked at\nhim, as yesterday, sorrowfully and intelligently, smiled and talked, and\nall with an expression as though she wanted to tell him something\nspecial, important--him alone. They could hear the larks trilling and\nthe church bells pealing. The windows in the factory buildings were\nsparkling gaily, and, driving across the yard and afterwards along the\nroad to the station, Korolyov thought neither of the workpeople nor of\nlake dwellings, nor of the devil, but thought of the time, perhaps close\nat hand, when life would be as bright and joyous as that still Sunday\nmorning; and he thought how pleasant it was on such a morning in the\nspring to drive with three horses in a good carriage, and to bask in the\nsunshine.\n\n\n\n\nAN UPHEAVAL\n\n\nMASHENKA PAVLETSKY, a young girl who had only just finished her studies\nat a boarding school, returning from a walk to the house of the\nKushkins, with whom she was living as a governess, found the household\nin a terrible turmoil. Mihailo, the porter who opened the door to her,\nwas excited and red as a crab.\n\nLoud voices were heard from upstairs.\n\n\"Madame Kushkin is in a fit, most likely, or else she has quarrelled\nwith her husband,\" thought Mashenka.\n\nIn the hall and in the corridor she met maid-servants. One of them was\ncrying. Then Mashenka saw, running out of her room, the master of the\nhouse himself, Nikolay Sergeitch, a little man with a flabby face and a\nbald head, though he was not old. He was red in the face and twitching\nall over. He passed the governess without noticing her, and throwing up\nhis arms, exclaimed:\n\n\"Oh, how horrible it is! How tactless! How stupid! How barbarous!\nAbominable!\"\n\nMashenka went into her room, and then, for the first time in her life,\nit was her lot to experience in all its acuteness the feeling that is so\nfamiliar to persons in dependent positions, who eat the bread of the\nrich and powerful, and cannot speak their minds. There was a search\ngoing on in her room. The lady of the house, Fedosya Vassilyevna, a\nstout, broad-shouldered, uncouth woman with thick black eyebrows, a\nfaintly perceptible moustache, and red hands, who was exactly like a\nplain, illiterate cook in face and manners, was standing, without her\ncap on, at the table, putting back into Mashenka's workbag balls of\nwool, scraps of materials, and bits of paper.... Evidently the\ngoverness's arrival took her by surprise, since, on looking round and\nseeing the girl's pale and astonished face, she was a little taken\naback, and muttered:\n\n\"_Pardon_. I ... I upset it accidentally.... My sleeve caught in it ...\"\n\nAnd saying something more, Madame Kushkin rustled her long skirts and\nwent out. Mashenka looked round her room with wondering eyes, and,\nunable to understand it, not knowing what to think, shrugged her\nshoulders, and turned cold with dismay. What had Fedosya Vassilyevna\nbeen looking for in her work-bag? If she really had, as she said, caught\nher sleeve in it and upset everything, why had Nikolay Sergeitch dashed\nout of her room so excited and red in the face? Why was one drawer of\nthe table pulled out a little way? The money-box, in which the governess\nput away ten kopeck pieces and old stamps, was open. They had opened it,\nbut did not know how to shut it, though they had scratched the lock all\nover. The whatnot with her books on it, the things on the table, the\nbed--all bore fresh traces of a search. Her linen-basket, too. The linen\nhad been carefully folded, but it was not in the same order as Mashenka\nhad left it when she went out. So the search had been thorough, most\nthorough. But what was it for? Why? What had happened? Mashenka\nremembered the excited porter, the general turmoil which was still going\non, the weeping servant-girl; had it not all some connection with the\nsearch that had just been made in her room? Was not she mixed up in\nsomething dreadful? Mashenka turned pale, and feeling cold all over,\nsank on to her linen-basket.\n\nA maid-servant came into the room.\n\n\"Liza, you don't know why they have been rummaging in my room?\" the\ngoverness asked her.\n\n\"Mistress has lost a brooch worth two thousand,\" said Liza.\n\n\"Yes, but why have they been rummaging in my room?\"\n\n\"They've been searching every one, miss. They've searched all my things,\ntoo. They stripped us all naked and searched us.... God knows, miss, I\nnever went near her toilet-table, let alone touching the brooch. I shall\nsay the same at the police-station.\"\n\n\"But ... why have they been rummaging here?\" the governess still\nwondered.\n\n\"A brooch has been stolen, I tell you. The mistress has been rummaging\nin everything with her own hands. She even searched Mihailo, the porter,\nherself. It's a perfect disgrace! Nikolay Sergeitch simply looks on and\ncackles like a hen. But you've no need to tremble like that, miss. They\nfound nothing here. You've nothing to be afraid of if you didn't take\nthe brooch.\"\n\n\"But, Liza, it's vile ... it's insulting,\" said Mashenka, breathless\nwith indignation. \"It's so mean, so low! What right had she to suspect\nme and to rummage in my things?\"\n\n\"You are living with strangers, miss,\" sighed Liza. \"Though you are a\nyoung lady, still you are ... as it were ... a servant.... It's not like\nliving with your papa and mamma.\"\n\nMashenka threw herself on the bed and sobbed bitterly. Never in her life\nhad she been subjected to such an outrage, never had she been so deeply\ninsulted.... She, well-educated, refined, the daughter of a teacher, was\nsuspected of theft; she had been searched like a street-walker! She\ncould not imagine a greater insult. And to this feeling of resentment\nwas added an oppressive dread of what would come next. All sorts of\nabsurd ideas came into her mind. If they could suspect her of theft,\nthen they might arrest her, strip her naked, and search her, then lead\nher through the street with an escort of soldiers, cast her into a cold,\ndark cell with mice and woodlice, exactly like the dungeon in which\nPrincess Tarakanov was imprisoned. Who would stand up for her? Her\nparents lived far away in the provinces; they had not the money to come\nto her. In the capital she was as solitary as in a desert, without\nfriends or kindred. They could do what they liked with her.\n\n\"I will go to all the courts and all the lawyers,\" Mashenka thought,\ntrembling. \"I will explain to them, I will take an oath.... They will\nbelieve that I could not be a thief!\"\n\nMashenka remembered that under the sheets in her basket she had some\nsweetmeats, which, following the habits of her schooldays, she had put\nin her pocket at dinner and carried off to her room. She felt hot all\nover, and was ashamed at the thought that her little secret was known to\nthe lady of the house; and all this terror, shame, resentment, brought\non an attack of palpitation of the heart, which set up a throbbing in\nher temples, in her heart, and deep down in her stomach.\n\n\"Dinner is ready,\" the servant summoned Mashenka.\n\n\"Shall I go, or not?\"\n\nMashenka brushed her hair, wiped her face with a wet towel, and went\ninto the dining-room. There they had already begun dinner. At one end of\nthe table sat Fedosya Vassilyevna with a stupid, solemn, serious face;\nat the other end Nikolay Sergeitch. At the sides there were the visitors\nand the children. The dishes were handed by two footmen in swallowtails\nand white gloves. Every one knew that there was an upset in the house,\nthat Madame Kushkin was in trouble, and every one was silent. Nothing\nwas heard but the sound of munching and the rattle of spoons on the\nplates.\n\nThe lady of the house, herself, was the first to speak.\n\n\"What is the third course?\" she asked the footman in a weary, injured\nvoice.\n\n\"_Esturgeon a la russe_,\" answered the footman.\n\n\"I ordered that, Fenya,\" Nikolay Sergeitch hastened to observe. \"I\nwanted some fish. If you don't like it, _ma chere_, don't let them serve\nit. I just ordered it....\"\n\nFedosya Vassilyevna did not like dishes that she had not ordered\nherself, and now her eyes filled with tears.\n\n\"Come, don't let us agitate ourselves,\" Mamikov, her household doctor,\nobserved in a honeyed voice, just touching her arm, with a smile as\nhoneyed. \"We are nervous enough as it is. Let us forget the brooch!\nHealth is worth more than two thousand roubles!\"\n\n\"It's not the two thousand I regret,\" answered the lady, and a big tear\nrolled down her cheek. \"It's the fact itself that revolts me! I cannot\nput up with thieves in my house. I don't regret it--I regret nothing;\nbut to steal from me is such ingratitude! That's how they repay me for\nmy kindness....\"\n\nThey all looked into their plates, but Mashenka fancied after the lady's\nwords that every one was looking at her. A lump rose in her throat; she\nbegan crying and put her handkerchief to her lips.\n\n\"_Pardon_,\" she muttered. \"I can't help it. My head aches. I'll go\naway.\"\n\nAnd she got up from the table, scraping her chair awkwardly, and went\nout quickly, still more overcome with confusion.\n\n\"It's beyond everything!\" said Nikolay Sergeitch, frowning. \"What need\nwas there to search her room? How out of place it was!\"\n\n\"I don't say she took the brooch,\" said Fedosya Vassilyevna, \"but can\nyou answer for her? To tell the truth, I haven't much confidence in\nthese learned paupers.\"\n\n\"It really was unsuitable, Fenya.... Excuse me, Fenya, but you've no\nkind of legal right to make a search.\"\n\n\"I know nothing about your laws. All I know is that I've lost my brooch.\nAnd I will find the brooch!\" She brought her fork down on the plate with\na clatter, and her eyes flashed angrily. \"And you eat your dinner, and\ndon't interfere in what doesn't concern you!\"\n\nNikolay Sergeitch dropped his eyes mildly and sighed. Meanwhile\nMashenka, reaching her room, flung herself on her bed. She felt now\nneither alarm nor shame, but she felt an intense longing to go and slap\nthe cheeks of this hard, arrogant, dull-witted, prosperous woman.\n\nLying on her bed she breathed into her pillow and dreamed of how nice it\nwould be to go and buy the most expensive brooch and fling it into the\nface of this bullying woman. If only it were God's will that Fedosya\nVassilyevna should come to ruin and wander about begging, and should\ntaste all the horrors of poverty and dependence, and that Mashenka, whom\nshe had insulted, might give her alms! Oh, if only she could come in for\na big fortune, could buy a carriage, and could drive noisily past the\nwindows so as to be envied by that woman!\n\nBut all these were only dreams, in reality there was only one thing left\nto do--to get away as quickly as possible, not to stay another hour in\nthis place. It was true it was terrible to lose her place, to go back to\nher parents, who had nothing; but what could she do? Mashenka could not\nbear the sight of the lady of the house nor of her little room; she felt\nstifled and wretched here. She was so disgusted with Fedosya\nVassilyevna, who was so obsessed by her illnesses and her supposed\naristocratic rank, that everything in the world seemed to have become\ncoarse and unattractive because this woman was living in it. Mashenka\njumped up from the bed and began packing.\n\n\"May I come in?\" asked Nikolay Sergeitch at the door; he had come up\nnoiselessly to the door, and spoke in a soft, subdued voice. \"May I?\"\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\nHe came in and stood still near the door. His eyes looked dim and his\nred little nose was shiny. After dinner he used to drink beer, and the\nfact was perceptible in his walk, in his feeble, flabby hands.\n\n\"What's this?\" he asked, pointing to the basket.\n\n\"I am packing. Forgive me, Nikolay Sergeitch, but I cannot remain in\nyour house. I feel deeply insulted by this search!\"\n\n\"I understand.... Only you are wrong to go. Why should you? They've\nsearched your things, but you ... what does it matter to you? You will\nbe none the worse for it.\"\n\nMashenka was silent and went on packing. Nikolay Sergeitch pinched his\nmoustache, as though wondering what he should say next, and went on in\nan ingratiating voice:\n\n\"I understand, of course, but you must make allowances. You know my wife\nis nervous, headstrong; you mustn't judge her too harshly.\"\n\nMashenka did not speak.\n\n\"If you are so offended,\" Nikolay Sergeitch went on, \"well, if you like,\nI'm ready to apologise. I ask your pardon.\"\n\nMashenka made no answer, but only bent lower over her box. This\nexhausted, irresolute man was of absolutely no significance in the\nhousehold. He stood in the pitiful position of a dependent and\nhanger-on, even with the servants, and his apology meant nothing either.\n\n\"H'm!... You say nothing! That's not enough for you. In that case, I\nwill apologise for my wife. In my wife's name.... She behaved\ntactlessly, I admit it as a gentleman....\"\n\nNikolay Sergeitch walked about the room, heaved a sigh, and went on:\n\n\"Then you want me to have it rankling here, under my heart.... You want\nmy conscience to torment me....\"\n\n\"I know it's not your fault, Nikolay Sergeitch,\" said Mashenka, looking\nhim full in the face with her big tear-stained eyes. \"Why should you\nworry yourself?\"\n\n\"Of course, no.... But still, don't you ... go away. I entreat you.\"\n\nMashenka shook her head. Nikolay Sergeitch stopped at the window and\ndrummed on the pane with his finger-tips.\n\n\"Such misunderstandings are simply torture to me,\" he said. \"Why, do you\nwant me to go down on my knees to you, or what? Your pride is wounded,\nand here you've been crying and packing up to go; but I have pride, too,\nand you do not spare it! Or do you want me to tell you what I would not\ntell as Confession? Do you? Listen; you want me to tell you what I won't\ntell the priest on my deathbed?\"\n\nMashenka made no answer.\n\n\"I took my wife's brooch,\" Nikolay Sergeitch said quickly. \"Is that\nenough now? Are you satisfied? Yes, I ... took it.... But, of course, I\ncount on your discretion.... For God's sake, not a word, not half a hint\nto any one!\"\n\nMashenka, amazed and frightened, went on packing; she snatched her\nthings, crumpled them up, and thrust them anyhow into the box and the\nbasket. Now, after this candid avowal on the part of Nikolay Sergeitch,\nshe could not remain another minute, and could not understand how she\ncould have gone on living in the house before.\n\n\"And it's nothing to wonder at,\" Nikolay Sergeitch went on after a\npause. \"It's an everyday story! I need money, and she ... won't give it\nto me. It was my father's money that bought this house and everything,\nyou know! It's all mine, and the brooch belonged to my mother, and ...\nit's all mine! And she took it, took possession of everything.... I\ncan't go to law with her, you'll admit.... I beg you most earnestly,\noverlook it ... stay on. _Tout comprendre, tout pardonner._ Will you\nstay?\"\n\n\"No!\" said Mashenka resolutely, beginning to tremble. \"Let me alone, I\nentreat you!\"\n\n\"Well, God bless you!\" sighed Nikolay Sergeitch, sitting down on the\nstool near the box. \"I must own I like people who still can feel\nresentment, contempt, and so on. I could sit here forever and look at\nyour indignant face.... So you won't stay, then? I understand.... It's\nbound to be so ... Yes, of course.... It's all right for you, but for\nme--wo-o-o-o!... I can't stir a step out of this cellar. I'd go off to\none of our estates, but in every one of them there are some of my wife's\nrascals ... stewards, experts, damn them all! They mortgage and\nremortgage.... You mustn't catch fish, must keep off the grass, mustn't\nbreak the trees.\"\n\n\"Nikolay Sergeitch!\" his wife's voice called from the drawing-room.\n\"Agnia, call your master!\"\n\n\"Then you won't stay?\" asked Nikolay Sergeitch, getting up quickly and\ngoing towards the door. \"You might as well stay, really. In the evenings\nI could come and have a talk with you. Eh? Stay! If you go, there won't\nbe a human face left in the house. It's awful!\"\n\nNikolay Sergeitch's pale, exhausted face besought her, but Mashenka\nshook her head, and with a wave of his hand he went out.\n\nHalf an hour later she was on her way.\n\n\n\n\nIONITCH\n\n\nI\n\nWHEN visitors to the provincial town S---- complained of the dreariness\nand monotony of life, the inhabitants of the town, as though defending\nthemselves, declared that it was very nice in S----, that there was a\nlibrary, a theatre, a club; that they had balls; and, finally, that\nthere were clever, agreeable, and interesting families with whom one\ncould make acquaintance. And they used to point to the family of the\nTurkins as the most highly cultivated and talented.\n\nThis family lived in their own house in the principal street, near the\nGovernor's. Ivan Petrovitch Turkin himself--a stout, handsome, dark man\nwith whiskers--used to get up amateur performances for benevolent\nobjects, and used to take the part of an elderly general and cough very\namusingly. He knew a number of anecdotes, charades, proverbs, and was\nfond of being humorous and witty, and he always wore an expression from\nwhich it was impossible to tell whether he were joking or in earnest.\nHis wife, Vera Iosifovna--a thin, nice-looking lady who wore a\npince-nez--used to write novels and stories, and was very fond of\nreading them aloud to her visitors. The daughter, Ekaterina Ivanovna, a\nyoung girl, used to play on the piano. In short, every member of the\nfamily had a special talent. The Turkins welcomed visitors, and\ngood-humouredly displayed their talents with genuine simplicity. Their\nstone house was roomy and cool in summer; half of the windows looked\ninto a shady old garden, where nightingales used to sing in the spring.\nWhen there were visitors in the house, there was a clatter of knives in\nthe kitchen and a smell of fried onions in the yard--and that was always\na sure sign of a plentiful and savoury supper to follow.\n\nAnd as soon as Dmitri Ionitch Startsev was appointed the district\ndoctor, and took up his abode at Dyalizh, six miles from S----, he, too,\nwas told that as a cultivated man it was essential for him to make the\nacquaintance of the Turkins. In the winter he was introduced to Ivan\nPetrovitch in the street; they talked about the weather, about the\ntheatre, about the cholera; an invitation followed. On a holiday in the\nspring--it was Ascension Day--after seeing his patients, Startsev set\noff for town in search of a little recreation and to make some\npurchases. He walked in a leisurely way (he had not yet set up his\ncarriage), humming all the time:\n\n    \"'Before I'd drunk the tears from life's goblet....'\"\n\nIn town he dined, went for a walk in the gardens, then Ivan\nPetrovitch's invitation came into his mind, as it were of itself,\nand he decided to call on the Turkins and see what sort of people\nthey were.\n\n\"How do you do, if you please?\" said Ivan Petrovitch, meeting him\non the steps. \"Delighted, delighted to see such an agreeable visitor.\nCome along; I will introduce you to my better half. I tell him,\nVerotchka,\" he went on, as he presented the doctor to his wife--\"I\ntell him that he has no human right to sit at home in a hospital;\nhe ought to devote his leisure to society. Oughtn't he, darling?\"\n\n\"Sit here,\" said Vera Iosifovna, making her visitor sit down beside\nher. \"You can dance attendance on me. My husband is jealous--he\nis an Othello; but we will try and behave so well that he will\nnotice nothing.\"\n\n\"Ah, you spoilt chicken!\" Ivan Petrovitch muttered tenderly, and\nhe kissed her on the forehead. \"You have come just in the nick of\ntime,\" he said, addressing the doctor again. \"My better half has\nwritten a 'hugeous' novel, and she is going to read it aloud to-day.\"\n\n\"Petit Jean,\" said Vera Iosifovna to her husband, \"dites que l'on\nnous donne du the.\"\n\nStartsev was introduced to Ekaterina Ivanovna, a girl of eighteen,\nvery much like her mother, thin and pretty. Her expression was still\nchildish and her figure was soft and slim; and her developed girlish\nbosom, healthy and beautiful, was suggestive of spring, real spring.\n\nThen they drank tea with jam, honey, and sweetmeats, and with very\nnice cakes, which melted in the mouth. As the evening came on, other\nvisitors gradually arrived, and Ivan Petrovitch fixed his laughing\neyes on each of them and said:\n\n\"How do you do, if you please?\"\n\nThen they all sat down in the drawing-room with very serious faces,\nand Vera Iosifovna read her novel. It began like this: \"The frost\nwas intense....\" The windows were wide open; from the kitchen\ncame the clatter of knives and the smell of fried onions.... It\nwas comfortable in the soft deep arm-chair; the lights had such a\nfriendly twinkle in the twilight of the drawing-room, and at the\nmoment on a summer evening when sounds of voices and laughter floated\nin from the street and whiffs of lilac from the yard, it was difficult\nto grasp that the frost was intense, and that the setting sun was\nlighting with its chilly rays a solitary wayfarer on the snowy\nplain. Vera Iosifovna read how a beautiful young countess founded\na school, a hospital, a library, in her village, and fell in love\nwith a wandering artist; she read of what never happens in real\nlife, and yet it was pleasant to listen--it was comfortable, and\nsuch agreeable, serene thoughts kept coming into the mind, one had\nno desire to get up.\n\n\"Not badsome ...\" Ivan Petrovitch said softly.\n\nAnd one of the visitors hearing, with his thoughts far away, said\nhardly audibly:\n\n\"Yes ... truly....\"\n\nOne hour passed, another. In the town gardens close by a band was\nplaying and a chorus was singing. When Vera Iosifovna shut her\nmanuscript book, the company was silent for five minutes, listening\nto \"Lutchina\" being sung by the chorus, and the song gave what was\nnot in the novel and is in real life.\n\n\"Do you publish your stories in magazines?\" Startsev asked Vera\nIosifovna.\n\n\"No,\" she answered. \"I never publish. I write it and put it away\nin my cupboard. Why publish?\" she explained. \"We have enough to\nlive on.\"\n\nAnd for some reason every one sighed.\n\n\"And now, Kitten, you play something,\" Ivan Petrovitch said to his\ndaughter.\n\nThe lid of the piano was raised and the music lying ready was opened.\nEkaterina Ivanovna sat down and banged on the piano with both hands,\nand then banged again with all her might, and then again and again;\nher shoulders and bosom shook. She obstinately banged on the same\nnotes, and it sounded as if she would not leave off until she had\nhammered the keys into the piano. The drawing-room was filled with\nthe din; everything was resounding; the floor, the ceiling, the\nfurniture.... Ekaterina Ivanovna was playing a difficult passage,\ninteresting simply on account of its difficulty, long and monotonous,\nand Startsev, listening, pictured stones dropping down a steep hill\nand going on dropping, and he wished they would leave off dropping;\nand at the same time Ekaterina Ivanovna, rosy from the violent\nexercise, strong and vigorous, with a lock of hair falling over her\nforehead, attracted him very much. After the winter spent at Dyalizh\namong patients and peasants, to sit in a drawing-room, to watch\nthis young, elegant, and, in all probability, pure creature, and\nto listen to these noisy, tedious but still cultured sounds, was\nso pleasant, so novel....\n\n\"Well, Kitten, you have played as never before,\" said Ivan Petrovitch,\nwith tears in his eyes, when his daughter had finished and stood\nup. \"Die, Denis; you won't write anything better.\"\n\nAll flocked round her, congratulated her, expressed astonishment,\ndeclared that it was long since they had heard such music, and she\nlistened in silence with a faint smile, and her whole figure was\nexpressive of triumph.\n\n\"Splendid, superb!\"\n\n\"Splendid,\" said Startsev, too, carried away by the general enthusiasm.\n\"Where have you studied?\" he asked Ekaterina Ivanovna. \"At the\nConservatoire?\"\n\n\"No, I am only preparing for the Conservatoire, and till now have\nbeen working with Madame Zavlovsky.\"\n\n\"Have you finished at the high school here?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Vera Iosifovna answered for her, \"We have teachers for\nher at home; there might be bad influences at the high school or a\nboarding school, you know. While a young girl is growing up, she\nought to be under no influence but her mother's.\"\n\n\"All the same, I'm going to the Conservatoire,\" said Ekaterina\nIvanovna.\n\n\"No. Kitten loves her mamma. Kitten won't grieve papa and mamma.\"\n\n\"No, I'm going, I'm going,\" said Ekaterina Ivanovna, with playful\ncaprice and stamping her foot.\n\nAnd at supper it was Ivan Petrovitch who displayed his talents.\nLaughing only with his eyes, he told anecdotes, made epigrams, asked\nridiculous riddles and answered them himself, talking the whole\ntime in his extraordinary language, evolved in the course of prolonged\npractice in witticism and evidently now become a habit: \"Badsome,\"\n\"Hugeous,\" \"Thank you most dumbly,\" and so on.\n\nBut that was not all. When the guests, replete and satisfied, trooped\ninto the hall, looking for their coats and sticks, there bustled\nabout them the footman Pavlusha, or, as he was called in the family,\nPava--a lad of fourteen with shaven head and chubby cheeks.\n\n\"Come, Pava, perform!\" Ivan Petrovitch said to him.\n\nPava struck an attitude, flung up his arm, and said in a tragic\ntone: \"Unhappy woman, die!\"\n\nAnd every one roared with laughter.\n\n\"It's entertaining,\" thought Startsev, as he went out into the\nstreet.\n\nHe went to a restaurant and drank some beer, then set off to walk\nhome to Dyalizh; he walked all the way singing:\n\n    \"'Thy voice to me so languid and caressing....'\"\n\nOn going to bed, he felt not the slightest fatigue after the six miles'\nwalk. On the contrary, he felt as though he could with pleasure have\nwalked another twenty.\n\n\"Not badsome,\" he thought, and laughed as he fell asleep.\n\n\nII\n\nStartsev kept meaning to go to the Turkins' again, but there was a great\ndeal of work in the hospital, and he was unable to find free time. In\nthis way more than a year passed in work and solitude. But one day a\nletter in a light blue envelope was brought him from the town.\n\nVera Iosifovna had been suffering for some time from migraine, but now\nsince Kitten frightened her every day by saying that she was going away\nto the Conservatoire, the attacks began to be more frequent. All the\ndoctors of the town had been at the Turkins'; at last it was the\ndistrict doctor's turn. Vera Iosifovna wrote him a touching letter in\nwhich she begged him to come and relieve her sufferings. Startsev went,\nand after that he began to be often, very often at the Turkins'.... He\nreally did something for Vera Iosifovna, and she was already telling all\nher visitors that he was a wonderful and exceptional doctor. But it was\nnot for the sake of her migraine that he visited the Turkins' now....\n\nIt was a holiday. Ekaterina Ivanovna finished her long, wearisome\nexercises on the piano. Then they sat a long time in the dining-room,\ndrinking tea, and Ivan Petrovitch told some amusing story. Then there\nwas a ring and he had to go into the hall to welcome a guest; Startsev\ntook advantage of the momentary commotion, and whispered to Ekaterina\nIvanovna in great agitation:\n\n\"For God's sake, I entreat you, don't torment me; let us go into the\ngarden!\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders, as though perplexed and not knowing what he\nwanted of her, but she got up and went.\n\n\"You play the piano for three or four hours,\" he said, following her;\n\"then you sit with your mother, and there is no possibility of speaking\nto you. Give me a quarter of an hour at least, I beseech you.\"\n\nAutumn was approaching, and it was quiet and melancholy in the old\ngarden; the dark leaves lay thick in the walks. It was already beginning\nto get dark early.\n\n\"I haven't seen you for a whole week,\" Startsev went on, \"and if you\nonly knew what suffering it is! Let us sit down. Listen to me.\"\n\nThey had a favourite place in the garden; a seat under an old spreading\nmaple. And now they sat down on this seat.\n\n\"What do you want?\" said Ekaterina Ivanovna drily, in a matter-of-fact\ntone.\n\n\"I have not seen you for a whole week; I have not heard you for so long.\nI long passionately, I thirst for your voice. Speak.\"\n\nShe fascinated him by her freshness, the naive expression of her eyes\nand cheeks. Even in the way her dress hung on her, he saw something\nextraordinarily charming, touching in its simplicity and naive grace;\nand at the same time, in spite of this naivete, she seemed to him\nintelligent and developed beyond her years. He could talk with her about\nliterature, about art, about anything he liked; could complain to her of\nlife, of people, though it sometimes happened in the middle of serious\nconversation she would laugh inappropriately or run away into the house.\nLike almost all girls of her neighbourhood, she had read a great deal\n(as a rule, people read very little in S----, and at the lending library\nthey said if it were not for the girls and the young Jews, they might as\nwell shut up the library). This afforded Startsev infinite delight; he\nused to ask her eagerly every time what she had been reading the last\nfew days, and listened enthralled while she told him.\n\n\"What have you been reading this week since I saw you last?\" he asked\nnow. \"Do please tell me.\"\n\n\"I have been reading Pisemsky.\"\n\n\"What exactly?\"\n\n\"'A Thousand Souls,'\" answered Kitten. \"And what a funny name Pisemsky\nhad--Alexey Feofilaktitch!\n\n\"Where are you going?\" cried Startsev in horror, as she suddenly got up\nand walked towards the house. \"I must talk to you; I want to explain\nmyself.... Stay with me just five minutes, I supplicate you!\"\n\nShe stopped as though she wanted to say something, then awkwardly thrust\na note into his hand, ran home and sat down to the piano again.\n\n\"Be in the cemetery,\" Startsev read, \"at eleven o'clock to-night, near\nthe tomb of Demetti.\"\n\n\"Well, that's not at all clever,\" he thought, coming to himself. \"Why\nthe cemetery? What for?\"\n\nIt was clear: Kitten was playing a prank. Who would seriously dream of\nmaking an appointment at night in the cemetery far out of the town, when\nit might have been arranged in the street or in the town gardens? And\nwas it in keeping with him--a district doctor, an intelligent, staid\nman--to be sighing, receiving notes, to hang about cemeteries, to do\nsilly things that even schoolboys think ridiculous nowadays? What would\nthis romance lead to? What would his colleagues say when they heard of\nit? Such were Startsev's reflections as he wandered round the tables at\nthe club, and at half-past ten he suddenly set off for the cemetery.\n\nBy now he had his own pair of horses, and a coachman called Panteleimon,\nin a velvet waistcoat. The moon was shining. It was still warm, warm as\nit is in autumn. Dogs were howling in the suburb near the\nslaughter-house. Startsev left his horses in one of the side-streets at\nthe end of the town, and walked on foot to the cemetery.\n\n\"We all have our oddities,\" he thought. \"Kitten is odd, too; and--who\nknows?--perhaps she is not joking, perhaps she will come\"; and he\nabandoned himself to this faint, vain hope, and it intoxicated him.\n\nHe walked for half a mile through the fields; the cemetery showed as a\ndark streak in the distance, like a forest or a big garden. The wall of\nwhite stone came into sight, the gate.... In the moonlight he could read\non the gate: \"The hour cometh.\" Startsev went in at the little gate, and\nbefore anything else he saw the white crosses and monuments on both\nsides of the broad avenue, and the black shadows of them and the\npoplars; and for a long way round it was all white and black, and the\nslumbering trees bowed their branches over the white stones. It seemed\nas though it were lighter here than in the fields; the maple-leaves\nstood out sharply like paws on the yellow sand of the avenue and on the\nstones, and the inscriptions on the tombs could be clearly read. For the\nfirst moments Startsev was struck now by what he saw for the first time\nin his life, and what he would probably never see again; a world not\nlike anything else, a world in which the moonlight was as soft and\nbeautiful, as though slumbering here in its cradle, where there was no\nlife, none whatever; but in every dark poplar, in every tomb, there was\nfelt the presence of a mystery that promised a life peaceful, beautiful,\neternal. The stones and faded flowers, together with the autumn scent of\nthe leaves, all told of forgiveness, melancholy, and peace.\n\nAll was silence around; the stars looked down from the sky in the\nprofound stillness, and Startsev's footsteps sounded loud and out of\nplace, and only when the church clock began striking and he imagined\nhimself dead, buried there for ever, he felt as though some one were\nlooking at him, and for a moment he thought that it was not peace and\ntranquillity, but stifled despair, the dumb dreariness of\nnon-existence....\n\nDemetti's tomb was in the form of a shrine with an angel at the top. The\nItalian opera had once visited S---- and one of the singers had died;\nshe had been buried here, and this monument put up to her. No one in the\ntown remembered her, but the lamp at the entrance reflected the\nmoonlight, and looked as though it were burning.\n\nThere was no one, and, indeed, who would come here at midnight? But\nStartsev waited, and as though the moonlight warmed his passion, he\nwaited passionately, and, in imagination, pictured kisses and embraces.\nHe sat near the monument for half an hour, then paced up and down the\nside avenues, with his hat in his hand, waiting and thinking of the many\nwomen and girls buried in these tombs who had been beautiful and\nfascinating, who had loved, at night burned with passion, yielding\nthemselves to caresses. How wickedly Mother Nature jested at man's\nexpense, after all! How humiliating it was to recognise it!\n\nStartsev thought this, and at the same time he wanted to cry out that he\nwanted love, that he was eager for it at all costs. To his eyes they\nwere not slabs of marble, but fair white bodies in the moonlight; he saw\nshapes hiding bashfully in the shadows of the trees, felt their warmth,\nand the languor was oppressive....\n\nAnd as though a curtain were lowered, the moon went behind a cloud, and\nsuddenly all was darkness. Startsev could scarcely find the gate--by now\nit was as dark as it is on an autumn night. Then he wandered about for\nan hour and a half, looking for the side-street in which he had left his\nhorses.\n\n\"I am tired; I can scarcely stand on my legs,\" he said to Panteleimon.\n\nAnd settling himself with relief in his carriage, he thought: \"Och! I\nought not to get fat!\"\n\n\nIII\n\nThe following evening he went to the Turkins' to make an offer. But it\nturned out to be an inconvenient moment, as Ekaterina Ivanovna was in\nher own room having her hair done by a hair-dresser. She was getting\nready to go to a dance at the club.\n\nHe had to sit a long time again in the dining-room drinking tea. Ivan\nPetrovitch, seeing that his visitor was bored and preoccupied, drew some\nnotes out of his waistcoat pocket, read a funny letter from a German\nsteward, saying that all the ironmongery was ruined and the plasticity\nwas peeling off the walls.\n\n\"I expect they will give a decent dowry,\" thought Startsev, listening\nabsent-mindedly.\n\nAfter a sleepless night, he found himself in a state of stupefaction, as\nthough he had been given something sweet and soporific to drink; there\nwas fog in his soul, but joy and warmth, and at the same time a sort of\ncold, heavy fragment of his brain was reflecting:\n\n\"Stop before it is too late! Is she the match for you? She is spoilt,\nwhimsical, sleeps till two o'clock in the afternoon, while you are a\ndeacon's son, a district doctor....\"\n\n\"What of it?\" he thought. \"I don't care.\"\n\n\"Besides, if you marry her,\" the fragment went on, \"then her relations\nwill make you give up the district work and live in the town.\"\n\n\"After all,\" he thought, \"if it must be the town, the town it must be.\nThey will give a dowry; we can establish ourselves suitably.\"\n\nAt last Ekaterina Ivanovna came in, dressed for the ball, with a low\nneck, looking fresh and pretty; and Startsev admired her so much, and\nwent into such ecstasies, that he could say nothing, but simply stared\nat her and laughed.\n\nShe began saying good-bye, and he--he had no reason for staying now--got\nup, saying that it was time for him to go home; his patients were\nwaiting for him.\n\n\"Well, there's no help for that,\" said Ivan Petrovitch. \"Go, and you\nmight take Kitten to the club on the way.\"\n\nIt was spotting with rain; it was very dark, and they could only tell\nwhere the horses were by Panteleimon's husky cough. The hood of the\ncarriage was put up.\n\n\"I stand upright; you lie down right; he lies all right,\" said Ivan\nPetrovitch as he put his daughter into the carriage.\n\nThey drove off.\n\n\"I was at the cemetery yesterday,\" Startsev began. \"How ungenerous and\nmerciless it was on your part!...\"\n\n\"You went to the cemetery?\"\n\n\"Yes, I went there and waited almost till two o'clock. I suffered....\"\n\n\"Well, suffer, if you cannot understand a joke.\"\n\nEkaterina Ivanovna, pleased at having so cleverly taken in a man who was\nin love with her, and at being the object of such intense love, burst\nout laughing and suddenly uttered a shriek of terror, for, at that very\nminute, the horses turned sharply in at the gate of the club, and the\ncarriage almost tilted over. Startsev put his arm round Ekaterina\nIvanovna's waist; in her fright she nestled up to him, and he could not\nrestrain himself, and passionately kissed her on the lips and on the\nchin, and hugged her more tightly.\n\n\"That's enough,\" she said drily.\n\nAnd a minute later she was not in the carriage, and a policeman near the\nlighted entrance of the club shouted in a detestable voice to\nPanteleimon:\n\n\"What are you stopping for, you crow? Drive on.\"\n\nStartsev drove home, but soon afterwards returned. Attired in another\nman's dress suit and a stiff white tie which kept sawing at his neck and\ntrying to slip away from the collar, he was sitting at midnight in the\nclub drawing-room, and was saying with enthusiasm to Ekaterina Ivanovna.\n\n\"Ah, how little people know who have never loved! It seems to me that no\none has ever yet written of love truly, and I doubt whether this tender,\njoyful, agonising feeling can be described, and any one who has once\nexperienced it would not attempt to put it into words. What is the use\nof preliminaries and introductions? What is the use of unnecessary fine\nwords? My love is immeasurable. I beg, I beseech you,\" Startsev brought\nout at last, \"be my wife!\"\n\n\"Dmitri Ionitch,\" said Ekaterina Ivanovna, with a very grave face, after\na moment's thought--\"Dmitri Ionitch, I am very grateful to you for the\nhonour. I respect you, but ...\" she got up and continued standing, \"but,\nforgive me, I cannot be your wife. Let us talk seriously. Dmitri\nIonitch, you know I love art beyond everything in life. I adore music; I\nlove it frantically; I have dedicated my whole life to it. I want to be\nan artist; I want fame, success, freedom, and you want me to go on\nliving in this town, to go on living this empty, useless life, which has\nbecome insufferable to me. To become a wife--oh, no, forgive me! One\nmust strive towards a lofty, glorious goal, and married life would put\nme in bondage for ever. Dmitri Ionitch\" (she faintly smiled as she\npronounced his name; she thought of \"Alexey Feofilaktitch\")--\"Dmitri\nIonitch, you are a good, clever, honourable man; you are better than any\none....\" Tears came into her eyes. \"I feel for you with my whole heart,\nbut ... but you will understand....\"\n\nAnd she turned away and went out of the drawing-room to prevent herself\nfrom crying.\n\nStartsev's heart left off throbbing uneasily. Going out of the club into\nthe street, he first of all tore off the stiff tie and drew a deep\nbreath. He was a little ashamed and his vanity was wounded--he had not\nexpected a refusal--and could not believe that all his dreams, his hopes\nand yearnings, had led him up to such a stupid end, just as in some\nlittle play at an amateur performance, and he was sorry for his feeling,\nfor that love of his, so sorry that he felt as though he could have\nburst into sobs or have violently belaboured Panteleimon's broad back\nwith his umbrella.\n\nFor three days he could not get on with anything, he could not eat nor\nsleep; but when the news reached him that Ekaterina Ivanovna had gone\naway to Moscow to enter the Conservatoire, he grew calmer and lived as\nbefore.\n\nAfterwards, remembering sometimes how he had wandered about the cemetery\nor how he had driven all over the town to get a dress suit, he stretched\nlazily and said:\n\n\"What a lot of trouble, though!\"\n\n\nIV\n\nFour years had passed. Startsev already had a large practice in the\ntown. Every morning he hurriedly saw his patients at Dyalizh, then he\ndrove in to see his town patients. By now he drove, not with a pair, but\nwith a team of three with bells on them, and he returned home late at\nnight. He had grown broader and stouter, and was not very fond of\nwalking, as he was somewhat asthmatic. And Panteleimon had grown stout,\ntoo, and the broader he grew, the more mournfully he sighed and\ncomplained of his hard luck: he was sick of driving! Startsev used to\nvisit various households and met many people, but did not become\nintimate with any one. The inhabitants irritated him by their\nconversation, their views of life, and even their appearance. Experience\ntaught him by degrees that while he played cards or lunched with one of\nthese people, the man was a peaceable, friendly, and even intelligent\nhuman being; that as soon as one talked of anything not eatable, for\ninstance, of politics or science, he would be completely at a loss, or\nwould expound a philosophy so stupid and ill-natured that there was\nnothing else to do but wave one's hand in despair and go away. Even when\nStartsev tried to talk to liberal citizens, saying, for instance, that\nhumanity, thank God, was progressing, and that one day it would be\npossible to dispense with passports and capital punishment, the liberal\ncitizen would look at him askance and ask him mistrustfully: \"Then any\none could murder any one he chose in the open street?\" And when, at tea\nor supper, Startsev observed in company that one should work, and that\none ought not to live without working, every one took this as a\nreproach, and began to get angry and argue aggressively. With all that,\nthe inhabitants did nothing, absolutely nothing, and took no interest in\nanything, and it was quite impossible to think of anything to say. And\nStartsev avoided conversation, and confined himself to eating and\nplaying _vint_; and when there was a family festivity in some household\nand he was invited to a meal, then he sat and ate in silence, looking at\nhis plate.\n\nAnd everything that was said at the time was uninteresting, unjust, and\nstupid; he felt irritated and disturbed, but held his tongue, and,\nbecause he sat glumly silent and looked at his plate, he was nicknamed\nin the town \"the haughty Pole,\" though he never had been a Pole.\n\nAll such entertainments as theatres and concerts he declined, but he\nplayed _vint_ every evening for three hours with enjoyment. He had\nanother diversion to which he took imperceptibly, little by little: in\nthe evening he would take out of his pockets the notes he had gained by\nhis practice, and sometimes there were stuffed in his pockets\nnotes--yellow and green, and smelling of scent and vinegar and incense\nand fish oil--up to the value of seventy roubles; and when they amounted\nto some hundreds he took them to the Mutual Credit Bank and deposited\nthe money there to his account.\n\nHe was only twice at the Turkins' in the course of the four years after\nEkaterina Ivanovna had gone away, on each occasion at the invitation of\nVera Iosifovna, who was still undergoing treatment for migraine. Every\nsummer Ekaterina Ivanovna came to stay with her parents, but he did not\nonce see her; it somehow never happened.\n\nBut now four years had passed. One still, warm morning a letter was\nbrought to the hospital. Vera Iosifovna wrote to Dmitri Ionitch that she\nwas missing him very much, and begged him to come and see them, and to\nrelieve her sufferings; and, by the way, it was her birthday. Below was\na postscript: \"I join in mother's request.--K.\"\n\nStartsev considered, and in the evening he went to the Turkins'.\n\n\"How do you do, if you please?\" Ivan Petrovitch met him, smiling with\nhis eyes only. \"Bongjour.\"\n\nVera Iosifovna, white-haired and looking much older, shook Startsev's\nhand, sighed affectedly, and said:\n\n\"You don't care to pay attentions to me, doctor. You never come and see\nus; I am too old for you. But now some one young has come; perhaps she\nwill be more fortunate.\"\n\nAnd Kitten? She had grown thinner, paler, had grown handsomer and more\ngraceful; but now she was Ekaterina Ivanovna, not Kitten; she had lost\nthe freshness and look of childish naivete. And in her expression and\nmanners there was something new--guilty and diffident, as though she did\nnot feel herself at home here in the Turkins' house.\n\n\"How many summers, how many winters!\" she said, giving Startsev her\nhand, and he could see that her heart was beating with excitement; and\nlooking at him intently and curiously, she went on: \"How much stouter\nyou are! You look sunburnt and more manly, but on the whole you have\nchanged very little.\"\n\nNow, too, he thought her attractive, very attractive, but there was\nsomething lacking in her, or else something superfluous--he could not\nhimself have said exactly what it was, but something prevented him from\nfeeling as before. He did not like her pallor, her new expression, her\nfaint smile, her voice, and soon afterwards he disliked her clothes,\ntoo, the low chair in which she was sitting; he disliked something in\nthe past when he had almost married her. He thought of his love, of the\ndreams and the hopes which had troubled him four years before--and he\nfelt awkward.\n\nThey had tea with cakes. Then Vera Iosifovna read aloud a novel; she\nread of things that never happen in real life, and Startsev listened,\nlooked at her handsome grey head, and waited for her to finish.\n\n\"People are not stupid because they can't write novels, but because they\ncan't conceal it when they do,\" he thought.\n\n\"Not badsome,\" said Ivan Petrovitch.\n\nThen Ekaterina Ivanovna played long and noisily on the piano, and when\nshe finished she was profusely thanked and warmly praised.\n\n\"It's a good thing I did not marry her,\" thought Startsev.\n\nShe looked at him, and evidently expected him to ask her to go into the\ngarden, but he remained silent.\n\n\"Let us have a talk,\" she said, going up to him. \"How are you getting\non? What are you doing? How are things? I have been thinking about you\nall these days,\" she went on nervously. \"I wanted to write to you,\nwanted to come myself to see you at Dyalizh. I quite made up my mind to\ngo, but afterwards I thought better of it. God knows what your attitude\nis towards me now; I have been looking forward to seeing you to-day with\nsuch emotion. For goodness' sake let us go into the garden.\"\n\nThey went into the garden and sat down on the seat under the old maple,\njust as they had done four years before. It was dark.\n\n\"How are you getting on?\" asked Ekaterina Ivanovna.\n\n\"Oh, all right; I am jogging along,\" answered Startsev.\n\nAnd he could think of nothing more. They were silent.\n\n\"I feel so excited!\" said Ekaterina Ivanovna, and she hid her face in\nher hands. \"But don't pay attention to it. I am so happy to be at home;\nI am so glad to see every one. I can't get used to it. So many memories!\nI thought we should talk without stopping till morning.\"\n\nNow he saw her face near, her shining eyes, and in the darkness she\nlooked younger than in the room, and even her old childish expression\nseemed to have come back to her. And indeed she was looking at him with\nnaive curiosity, as though she wanted to get a closer view and\nunderstanding of the man who had loved her so ardently, with such\ntenderness, and so unsuccessfully; her eyes thanked him for that love.\nAnd he remembered all that had been, every minute detail; how he had\nwandered about the cemetery, how he had returned home in the morning\nexhausted, and he suddenly felt sad and regretted the past. A warmth\nbegan glowing in his heart.\n\n\"Do you remember how I took you to the dance at the club?\" he asked. \"It\nwas dark and rainy then ...\"\n\nThe warmth was glowing now in his heart, and he longed to talk, to rail\nat life....\n\n\"Ech!\" he said with a sigh. \"You ask how I am living. How do we live\nhere? Why, not at all. We grow old, we grow stout, we grow slack. Day\nafter day passes; life slips by without colour, without expressions,\nwithout thoughts.... In the daytime working for gain, and in the evening\nthe club, the company of card-players, alcoholic, raucous-voiced\ngentlemen whom I can't endure. What is there nice in it?\"\n\n\"Well, you have work--a noble object in life. You used to be so fond of\ntalking of your hospital. I was such a queer girl then; I imagined\nmyself such a great pianist. Nowadays all young ladies play the piano,\nand I played, too, like everybody else, and there was nothing special\nabout me. I am just such a pianist as my mother is an authoress. And of\ncourse I didn't understand you then, but afterwards in Moscow I often\nthought of you. I thought of no one but you. What happiness to be a\ndistrict doctor; to help the suffering; to be serving the people! What\nhappiness!\" Ekaterina Ivanovna repeated with enthusiasm. \"When I thought\nof you in Moscow, you seemed to me so ideal, so lofty....\"\n\nStartsev thought of the notes he used to take out of his pockets in the\nevening with such pleasure, and the glow in his heart was quenched.\n\nHe got up to go into the house. She took his arm.\n\n\"You are the best man I've known in my life,\" she went on. \"We will see\neach other and talk, won't we? Promise me. I am not a pianist; I am not\nin error about myself now, and I will not play before you or talk of\nmusic.\"\n\nWhen they had gone into the house, and when Startsev saw in the\nlamplight her face, and her sad, grateful, searching eyes fixed upon\nhim, he felt uneasy and thought again:\n\n\"It's a good thing I did not marry her then.\"\n\nHe began taking leave.\n\n\"You have no human right to go before supper,\" said Ivan Petrovitch as\nhe saw him off. \"It's extremely perpendicular on your part. Well, now,\nperform!\" he added, addressing Pava in the hall.\n\nPava, no longer a boy, but a young man with moustaches, threw himself\ninto an attitude, flung up his arm, and said in a tragic voice:\n\n\"Unhappy woman, die!\"\n\nAll this irritated Startsev. Getting into his carriage, and looking at\nthe dark house and garden which had once been so precious and so dear,\nhe thought of everything at once--Vera Iosifovna's novels and Kitten's\nnoisy playing, and Ivan Petrovitch's jokes and Pava's tragic posturing,\nand thought if the most talented people in the town were so futile, what\nmust the town be?\n\nThree days later Pava brought a letter from Ekaterina Ivanovna.\n\n\"You don't come and see us--why?\" she wrote to him. \"I am afraid that\nyou have changed towards us. I am afraid, and I am terrified at the very\nthought of it. Reassure me; come and tell me that everything is well.\n\n    \"I must talk to you.--Your E. I.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe read this letter, thought a moment, and said to Pava:\n\n\"Tell them, my good fellow, that I can't come to-day; I am very busy.\nSay I will come in three days or so.\"\n\nBut three days passed, a week passed; he still did not go. Happening\nonce to drive past the Turkins' house, he thought he must go in, if only\nfor a moment, but on second thoughts ... did not go in.\n\nAnd he never went to the Turkins' again.\n\n\nV\n\nSeveral more years have passed. Startsev has grown stouter still, has\ngrown corpulent, breathes heavily, and already walks with his head\nthrown back. When stout and red in the face, he drives with his bells\nand his team of three horses, and Panteleimon, also stout and red in the\nface with his thick beefy neck, sits on the box, holding his arms\nstiffly out before him as though they were made of wood, and shouts to\nthose he meets: \"Keep to the ri-i-ight!\" it is an impressive picture;\none might think it was not a mortal, but some heathen deity in his\nchariot. He has an immense practice in the town, no time to breathe, and\nalready has an estate and two houses in the town, and he is looking out\nfor a third more profitable; and when at the Mutual Credit Bank he is\ntold of a house that is for sale, he goes to the house without ceremony,\nand, marching through all the rooms, regardless of half-dressed women\nand children who gaze at him in amazement and alarm, he prods at the\ndoors with his stick, and says:\n\n\"Is that the study? Is that a bedroom? And what's here?\"\n\nAnd as he does so he breathes heavily and wipes the sweat from his brow.\n\nHe has a great deal to do, but still he does not give up his work as\ndistrict doctor; he is greedy for gain, and he tries to be in all places\nat once. At Dyalizh and in the town he is called simply \"Ionitch\":\n\"Where is Ionitch off to?\" or \"Should not we call in Ionitch to a\nconsultation?\"\n\nProbably because his throat is covered with rolls of fat, his voice has\nchanged; it has become thin and sharp. His temper has changed, too: he\nhas grown ill-humoured and irritable. When he sees his patients he is\nusually out of temper; he impatiently taps the floor with his stick, and\nshouts in his disagreeable voice:\n\n\"Be so good as to confine yourself to answering my questions! Don't talk\nso much!\"\n\nHe is solitary. He leads a dreary life; nothing interests him.\n\nDuring all the years he had lived at Dyalizh his love for Kitten had\nbeen his one joy, and probably his last. In the evenings he plays _vint_\nat the club, and then sits alone at a big table and has supper. Ivan,\nthe oldest and most respectable of the waiters, serves him, hands him\nLafitte No. 17, and every one at the club--the members of the committee,\nthe cook and waiters--know what he likes and what he doesn't like and do\ntheir very utmost to satisfy him, or else he is sure to fly into a rage\nand bang on the floor with his stick.\n\nAs he eats his supper, he turns round from time to time and puts in his\nspoke in some conversation:\n\n\"What are you talking about? Eh? Whom?\"\n\nAnd when at a neighbouring table there is talk of the Turkins, he asks:\n\n\"What Turkins are you speaking of? Do you mean the people whose daughter\nplays on the piano?\"\n\nThat is all that can be said about him.\n\nAnd the Turkins? Ivan Petrovitch has grown no older; he is not changed\nin the least, and still makes jokes and tells anecdotes as of old. Vera\nIosifovna still reads her novels aloud to her visitors with eagerness\nand touching simplicity. And Kitten plays the piano for four hours every\nday. She has grown visibly older, is constantly ailing, and every autumn\ngoes to the Crimea with her mother. When Ivan Petrovitch sees them off\nat the station, he wipes his tears as the train starts, and shouts:\n\n\"Good-bye, if you please.\"\n\nAnd he waves his handkerchief.\n\n\n\n\nTHE HEAD OF THE FAMILY\n\n\nIT is, as a rule, after losing heavily at cards or after a drinking-bout\nwhen an attack of dyspepsia is setting in that Stepan Stepanitch Zhilin\nwakes up in an exceptionally gloomy frame of mind. He looks sour,\nrumpled, and dishevelled; there is an expression of displeasure on his\ngrey face, as though he were offended or disgusted by something. He\ndresses slowly, sips his Vichy water deliberately, and begins walking\nabout the rooms.\n\n\"I should like to know what b-b-beast comes in here and does not shut\nthe door!\" he grumbles angrily, wrapping his dressing-gown about him and\nspitting loudly. \"Take away that paper! Why is it lying about here? We\nkeep twenty servants, and the place is more untidy than a pot-house. Who\nwas that ringing? Who the devil is that?\"\n\n\"That's Anfissa, the midwife who brought our Fedya into the world,\"\nanswers his wife.\n\n\"Always hanging about ... these cadging toadies!\"\n\n\"There's no making you out, Stepan Stepanitch. You asked her yourself,\nand now you scold.\"\n\n\"I am not scolding; I am speaking. You might find something to do, my\ndear, instead of sitting with your hands in your lap trying to pick a\nquarrel. Upon my word, women are beyond my comprehension! Beyond my\ncomprehension! How can they waste whole days doing nothing? A man works\nlike an ox, like a b-beast, while his wife, the partner of his life,\nsits like a pretty doll, sits and does nothing but watch for an\nopportunity to quarrel with her husband by way of diversion. It's time\nto drop these schoolgirlish ways, my dear. You are not a schoolgirl, not\na young lady; you are a wife and mother! You turn away? Aha! It's not\nagreeable to listen to the bitter truth!\n\n\"It's strange that you only speak the bitter truth when your liver is\nout of order.\"\n\n\"That's right; get up a scene.\"\n\n\"Have you been out late? Or playing cards?\"\n\n\"What if I have? Is that anybody's business? Am I obliged to give an\naccount of my doings to any one? It's my own money I lose, I suppose?\nWhat I spend as well as what is spent in this house belongs to me--me.\nDo you hear? To me!\"\n\nAnd so on, all in the same style. But at no other time is Stepan\nStepanitch so reasonable, virtuous, stern or just as at dinner, when all\nhis household are sitting about him. It usually begins with the soup.\nAfter swallowing the first spoonful Zhilin suddenly frowns and puts down\nhis spoon.\n\n\"Damn it all!\" he mutters; \"I shall have to dine at a restaurant, I\nsuppose.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" asks his wife anxiously. \"Isn't the soup good?\"\n\n\"One must have the taste of a pig to eat hogwash like that! There's too\nmuch salt in it; it smells of dirty rags ... more like bugs than\nonions.... It's simply revolting, Anfissa Ivanovna,\" he says, addressing\nthe midwife. \"Every day I give no end of money for housekeeping.... I\ndeny myself everything, and this is what they provide for my dinner! I\nsuppose they want me to give up the office and go into the kitchen to do\nthe cooking myself.\"\n\n\"The soup is very good to-day,\" the governess ventures timidly.\n\n\"Oh, you think so?\" says Zhilin, looking at her angrily from under his\neyelids. \"Every one to his taste, of course. It must be confessed our\ntastes are very different, Varvara Vassilyevna. You, for instance, are\nsatisfied with the behaviour of this boy\" (Zhilin with a tragic gesture\npoints to his son Fedya); \"you are delighted with him, while I ... I am\ndisgusted. Yes!\"\n\nFedya, a boy of seven with a pale, sickly face, leaves off eating and\ndrops his eyes. His face grows paler still.\n\n\"Yes, you are delighted, and I am disgusted. Which of us is right, I\ncannot say, but I venture to think as his father, I know my own son\nbetter than you do. Look how he is sitting! Is that the way decently\nbrought up children sit? Sit properly.\"\n\nFedya tilts his chin up, cranes his neck, and fancies that he is holding\nhimself better. Tears come into his eyes.\n\n\"Eat your dinner! Hold your spoon properly! You wait. I'll show you, you\nhorrid boy! Don't dare to whimper! Look straight at me!\"\n\nFedya tries to look straight at him, but his face is quivering and his\neyes fill with tears.\n\n\"A-ah!... you cry? You are naughty and then you cry? Go and stand in the\ncorner, you beast!\"\n\n\"But ... let him have his dinner first,\" his wife intervenes.\n\n\"No dinner for him! Such bla ... such rascals don't deserve dinner!\"\n\nFedya, wincing and quivering all over, creeps down from his chair and\ngoes into the corner.\n\n\"You won't get off with that!\" his parent persists. \"If nobody else\ncares to look after your bringing up, so be it; I must begin.... I won't\nlet you be naughty and cry at dinner, my lad! Idiot! You must do your\nduty! Do you understand? Do your duty! Your father works and you must\nwork, too! No one must eat the bread of idleness! You must be a man! A\nm-man!\"\n\n\"For God's sake, leave off,\" says his wife in French. \"Don't nag at us\nbefore outsiders, at least.... The old woman is all ears; and now,\nthanks to her, all the town will hear of it.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid of outsiders,\" answers Zhilin in Russian. \"Anfissa\nIvanovna sees that I am speaking the truth. Why, do you think I ought to\nbe pleased with the boy? Do you know what he costs me? Do you know, you\nnasty boy, what you cost me? Or do you imagine that I coin money, that I\nget it for nothing? Don't howl! Hold your tongue! Do you hear what I\nsay? Do you want me to whip you, you young ruffian?\"\n\nFedya wails aloud and begins to sob.\n\n\"This is insufferable,\" says his mother, getting up from the table and\nflinging down her dinner-napkin. \"You never let us have dinner in peace!\nYour bread sticks in my throat.\"\n\nAnd putting her handkerchief to her eyes, she walks out of the\ndining-room.\n\n\"Now she is offended,\" grumbles Zhilin, with a forced smile. \"She's been\nspoilt.... That's how it is, Anfissa Ivanovna; no one likes to hear the\ntruth nowadays.... It's all my fault, it seems.\"\n\nSeveral minutes of silence follow. Zhilin looks round at the plates, and\nnoticing that no one has yet touched their soup, heaves a deep sigh, and\nstares at the flushed and uneasy face of the governess.\n\n\"Why don't you eat, Varvara Vassilyevna?\" he asks. \"Offended, I suppose?\nI see.... You don't like to be told the truth. You must forgive me, it's\nmy nature; I can't be a hypocrite.... I always blurt out the plain\ntruth\" (a sigh). \"But I notice that my presence is unwelcome. No one can\neat or talk while I am here.... Well, you should have told me, and I\nwould have gone away.... I will go.\"\n\nZhilin gets up and walks with dignity to the door. As he passes the\nweeping Fedya he stops.\n\n\"After all that has passed here, you are free,\" he says to Fedya,\nthrowing back his head with dignity. \"I won't meddle in your bringing up\nagain. I wash my hands of it! I humbly apologise that as a father, from\na sincere desire for your welfare, I have disturbed you and your\nmentors. At the same time, once for all I disclaim all responsibility\nfor your future....\"\n\nFedya wails and sobs more loudly than ever. Zhilin turns with dignity to\nthe door and departs to his bedroom.\n\nWhen he wakes from his after-dinner nap he begins to feel the stings of\nconscience. He is ashamed to face his wife, his son, Anfissa Ivanovna,\nand even feels very wretched when he recalls the scene at dinner, but\nhis amour-propre is too much for him; he has not the manliness to be\nfrank, and he goes on sulking and grumbling.\n\nWaking up next morning, he feels in excellent spirits, and whistles\ngaily as he washes. Going into the dining-room to breakfast, he finds\nthere Fedya, who, at the sight of his father, gets up and looks at him\nhelplessly.\n\n\"Well, young man?\" Zhilin greets him good-humouredly, sitting down to\nthe table. \"What have you got to tell me, young man? Are you all right?\nWell, come, chubby; give your father a kiss.\"\n\nWith a pale, grave face Fedya goes up to his father and touches his\ncheek with his quivering lips, then walks away and sits down in his\nplace without a word.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BLACK MONK\n\n\nI\n\nANDREY VASSILITCH KOVRIN, who held a master's degree at the University,\nhad exhausted himself, and had upset his nerves. He did not send for a\ndoctor, but casually, over a bottle of wine, he spoke to a friend who\nwas a doctor, and the latter advised him to spend the spring and summer\nin the country. Very opportunely a long letter came from Tanya Pesotsky,\nwho asked him to come and stay with them at Borissovka. And he made up\nhis mind that he really must go.\n\nTo begin with--that was in April--he went to his own home, Kovrinka, and\nthere spent three weeks in solitude; then, as soon as the roads were in\ngood condition, he set off, driving in a carriage, to visit Pesotsky,\nhis former guardian, who had brought him up, and was a horticulturist\nwell known all over Russia. The distance from Kovrinka to Borissovka was\nreckoned only a little over fifty miles. To drive along a soft road in\nMay in a comfortable carriage with springs was a real pleasure.\n\nPesotsky had an immense house with columns and lions, off which the\nstucco was peeling, and with a footman in swallow-tails at the entrance.\nThe old park, laid out in the English style, gloomy and severe,\nstretched for almost three-quarters of a mile to the river, and there\nended in a steep, precipitous clay bank, where pines grew with bare\nroots that looked like shaggy paws; the water shone below with an\nunfriendly gleam, and the peewits flew up with a plaintive cry, and\nthere one always felt that one must sit down and write a ballad. But\nnear the house itself, in the courtyard and orchard, which together with\nthe nurseries covered ninety acres, it was all life and gaiety even in\nbad weather. Such marvellous roses, lilies, camellias; such tulips of\nall possible shades, from glistening white to sooty black--such a wealth\nof flowers, in fact, Kovrin had never seen anywhere as at Pesotsky's. It\nwas only the beginning of spring, and the real glory of the flower-beds\nwas still hidden away in the hot-houses. But even the flowers along the\navenues, and here and there in the flower-beds, were enough to make one\nfeel, as one walked about the garden, as though one were in a realm of\ntender colours, especially in the early morning when the dew was\nglistening on every petal.\n\nWhat was the decorative part of the garden, and what Pesotsky\ncontemptuously spoke of as rubbish, had at one time in his childhood\ngiven Kovrin an impression of fairyland.\n\nEvery sort of caprice, of elaborate monstrosity and mockery at Nature\nwas here. There were espaliers of fruit-trees, a pear-tree in the shape\nof a pyramidal poplar, spherical oaks and lime-trees, an apple-tree in\nthe shape of an umbrella, plum-trees trained into arches, crests,\ncandelabra, and even into the number 1862--the year when Pesotsky first\ntook up horticulture. One came across, too, lovely, graceful trees with\nstrong, straight stems like palms, and it was only by looking intently\nthat one could recognise these trees as gooseberries or currants. But\nwhat made the garden most cheerful and gave it a lively air, was the\ncontinual coming and going in it, from early morning till evening;\npeople with wheelbarrows, shovels, and watering-cans swarmed round the\ntrees and bushes, in the avenues and the flower-beds, like ants....\n\nKovrin arrived at Pesotsky's at ten o'clock in the evening. He found\nTanya and her father, Yegor Semyonitch, in great anxiety. The clear\nstarlight sky and the thermometer foretold a frost towards morning, and\nmeanwhile Ivan Karlovitch, the gardener, had gone to the town, and they\nhad no one to rely upon. At supper they talked of nothing but the\nmorning frost, and it was settled that Tanya should not go to bed, and\nbetween twelve and one should walk through the garden, and see that\neverything was done properly, and Yegor Semyonitch should get up at\nthree o'clock or even earlier.\n\nKovrin sat with Tanya all the evening, and after midnight went out with\nher into the garden. It was cold. There was a strong smell of burning\nalready in the garden. In the big orchard, which was called the\ncommercial garden, and which brought Yegor Semyonitch several thousand\nclear profit, a thick, black, acrid smoke was creeping over the ground\nand, curling around the trees, was saving those thousands from the\nfrost. Here the trees were arranged as on a chessboard, in straight and\nregular rows like ranks of soldiers, and this severe pedantic\nregularity, and the fact that all the trees were of the same size, and\nhad tops and trunks all exactly alike, made them look monotonous and\neven dreary. Kovrin and Tanya walked along the rows where fires of dung,\nstraw, and all sorts of refuse were smouldering, and from time to time\nthey were met by labourers who wandered in the smoke like shadows. The\nonly trees in flower were the cherries, plums, and certain sorts of\napples, but the whole garden was plunged in smoke, and it was only near\nthe nurseries that Kovrin could breathe freely.\n\n\"Even as a child I used to sneeze from the smoke here,\" he said,\nshrugging his shoulders, \"but to this day I don't understand how smoke\ncan keep off frost.\"\n\n\"Smoke takes the place of clouds when there are none ...\" answered\nTanya.\n\n\"And what do you want clouds for?\"\n\n\"In overcast and cloudy weather there is no frost.\"\n\n\"You don't say so.\"\n\nHe laughed and took her arm. Her broad, very earnest face, chilled with\nthe frost, with her delicate black eyebrows, the turned-up collar of her\ncoat, which prevented her moving her head freely, and the whole of her\nthin, graceful figure, with her skirts tucked up on account of the dew,\ntouched him.\n\n\"Good heavens! she is grown up,\" he said. \"When I went away from here\nlast, five years ago, you were still a child. You were such a thin,\nlonglegged creature, with your hair hanging on your shoulders; you used\nto wear short frocks, and I used to tease you, calling you a heron....\nWhat time does!\"\n\n\"Yes, five years!\" sighed Tanya. \"Much water has flowed since then. Tell\nme, Andryusha, honestly,\" she began eagerly, looking him in the face:\n\"do you feel strange with us now? But why do I ask you? You are a man,\nyou live your own interesting life, you are somebody.... To grow apart\nis so natural! But however that may be, Andryusha, I want you to think\nof us as your people. We have a right to that.\"\n\n\"I do, Tanya.\"\n\n\"On your word of honour?\"\n\n\"Yes, on my word of honour.\"\n\n\"You were surprised this evening that we have so many of your\nphotographs. You know my father adores you. Sometimes it seems to me\nthat he loves you more than he does me. He is proud of you. You are a\nclever, extraordinary man, you have made a brilliant career for\nyourself, and he is persuaded that you have turned out like this because\nhe brought you up. I don't try to prevent him from thinking so. Let\nhim.\"\n\nDawn was already beginning, and that was especially perceptible from the\ndistinctness with which the coils of smoke and the tops of the trees\nbegan to stand out in the air.\n\n\"It's time we were asleep, though,\" said Tanya, \"and it's cold, too.\"\nShe took his arm. \"Thank you for coming, Andryusha. We have only\nuninteresting acquaintances, and not many of them. We have only the\ngarden, the garden, the garden, and nothing else. Standards,\nhalf-standards,\" she laughed. \"Aports, Reinettes, Borovinkas, budded\nstocks, grafted stocks.... All, all our life has gone into the garden. I\nnever even dream of anything but apples and pears. Of course, it is very\nnice and useful, but sometimes one longs for something else for variety.\nI remember that when you used to come to us for the summer holidays, or\nsimply a visit, it always seemed to be fresher and brighter in the\nhouse, as though the covers had been taken off the lustres and the\nfurniture. I was only a little girl then, but yet I understood it.\"\n\nShe talked a long while and with great feeling. For some reason the idea\ncame into his head that in the course of the summer he might grow fond\nof this little, weak, talkative creature, might be carried away and fall\nin love; in their position it was so possible and natural! This thought\ntouched and amused him; he bent down to her sweet, preoccupied face and\nhummed softly:\n\n    \"'Onyegin, I won't conceal it;\n       I madly love Tatiana....'\"\n\nBy the time they reached the house, Yegor Semyonitch had got up. Kovrin\ndid not feel sleepy; he talked to the old man and went to the garden\nwith him. Yegor Semyonitch was a tall, broad-shouldered, corpulent man,\nand he suffered from asthma, yet he walked so fast that it was hard work\nto hurry after him. He had an extremely preoccupied air; he was always\nhurrying somewhere, with an expression that suggested that if he were\none minute late all would be ruined!\n\n\"Here is a business, brother ...\" he began, standing still to take\nbreath. \"On the surface of the ground, as you see, is frost; but if you\nraise the thermometer on a stick fourteen feet above the ground, there\nit is warm.... Why is that?\"\n\n\"I really don't know,\" said Kovrin, and he laughed.\n\n\"H'm!... One can't know everything, of course.... However large the\nintellect may be, you can't find room for everything in it. I suppose\nyou still go in chiefly for philosophy?\"\n\n\"Yes, I lecture in psychology; I am working at philosophy in general.\"\n\n\"And it does not bore you?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it's all I live for.\"\n\n\"Well, God bless you!...\" said Yegor Semyonitch, meditatively stroking\nhis grey whiskers. \"God bless you!... I am delighted about you ...\ndelighted, my boy....\"\n\nBut suddenly he listened, and, with a terrible face, ran off and quickly\ndisappeared behind the trees in a cloud of smoke.\n\n\"Who tied this horse to an apple-tree?\" Kovrin heard his despairing,\nheart-rending cry. \"Who is the low scoundrel who has dared to tie this\nhorse to an apple-tree? My God, my God! They have ruined everything;\nthey have spoilt everything; they have done everything filthy, horrible,\nand abominable. The orchard's done for, the orchard's ruined. My God!\"\n\nWhen he came back to Kovrin, his face looked exhausted and mortified.\n\n\"What is one to do with these accursed people?\" he said in a tearful\nvoice, flinging up his hands. \"Styopka was carting dung at night, and\ntied the horse to an apple-tree! He twisted the reins round it, the\nrascal, as tightly as he could, so that the bark is rubbed off in three\nplaces. What do you think of that! I spoke to him and he stands like a\npost and only blinks his eyes. Hanging is too good for him.\"\n\nGrowing calmer, he embraced Kovrin and kissed him on the cheek.\n\n\"Well, God bless you!... God bless you!...\" he muttered. \"I am very glad\nyou have come. Unutterably glad.... Thank you.\"\n\nThen, with the same rapid step and preoccupied face, he made the round\nof the whole garden, and showed his former ward all his greenhouses and\nhot-houses, his covered-in garden, and two apiaries which he called the\nmarvel of our century.\n\nWhile they were walking the sun rose, flooding the garden with brilliant\nlight. It grew warm. Foreseeing a long, bright, cheerful day, Kovrin\nrecollected that it was only the beginning of May, and that he had\nbefore him a whole summer as bright, cheerful, and long; and suddenly\nthere stirred in his bosom a joyous, youthful feeling, such as he used\nto experience in his childhood, running about in that garden. And he\nhugged the old man and kissed him affectionately. Both of them, feeling\ntouched, went indoors and drank tea out of old-fashioned china cups,\nwith cream and satisfying krendels made with milk and eggs; and these\ntrifles reminded Kovrin again of his childhood and boyhood. The\ndelightful present was blended with the impressions of the past that\nstirred within him; there was a tightness at his heart; yet he was\nhappy.\n\nHe waited till Tanya was awake and had coffee with her, went for a walk,\nthen went to his room and sat down to work. He read attentively, making\nnotes, and from time to time raised his eyes to look out at the open\nwindows or at the fresh, still dewy flowers in the vases on the table;\nand again he dropped his eyes to his book, and it seemed to him as\nthough every vein in his body was quivering and fluttering with\npleasure.\n\n\nII\n\nIn the country he led just as nervous and restless a life as in town. He\nread and wrote a great deal, he studied Italian, and when he was out for\na walk, thought with pleasure that he would soon sit down to work again.\nHe slept so little that every one wondered at him; if he accidentally\ndozed for half an hour in the daytime, he would lie awake all night,\nand, after a sleepless night, would feel cheerful and vigorous as though\nnothing had happened.\n\nHe talked a great deal, drank wine, and smoked expensive cigars. Very\noften, almost every day, young ladies of neighbouring families would\ncome to the Pesotskys', and would sing and play the piano with Tanya;\nsometimes a young neighbour who was a good violinist would come, too.\nKovrin listened with eagerness to the music and singing, and was\nexhausted by it, and this showed itself by his eyes closing and his head\nfalling to one side.\n\nOne day he was sitting on the balcony after evening tea, reading. At the\nsame time, in the drawing-room, Tanya taking soprano, one of the young\nladies a contralto, and the young man with his violin, were practising a\nwell-known serenade of Braga's. Kovrin listened to the words--they were\nRussian--and could not understand their meaning. At last, leaving his\nbook and listening attentively, he understood: a maiden, full of sick\nfancies, heard one night in her garden mysterious sounds, so strange and\nlovely that she was obliged to recognise them as a holy harmony which is\nunintelligible to us mortals, and so flies back to heaven. Kovrin's eyes\nbegan to close. He got up, and in exhaustion walked up and down the\ndrawing-room, and then the dining-room. When the singing was over he\ntook Tanya's arm, and with her went out on the balcony.\n\n\"I have been all day thinking of a legend,\" he said. \"I don't remember\nwhether I have read it somewhere or heard it, but it is a strange and\nalmost grotesque legend. To begin with, it is somewhat obscure. A\nthousand years ago a monk, dressed in black, wandered about the desert,\nsomewhere in Syria or Arabia.... Some miles from where he was, some\nfisherman saw another black monk, who was moving slowly over the surface\nof a lake. This second monk was a mirage. Now forget all the laws of\noptics, which the legend does not recognise, and listen to the rest.\nFrom that mirage there was cast another mirage, then from that other a\nthird, so that the image of the black monk began to be repeated\nendlessly from one layer of the atmosphere to another. So that he was\nseen at one time in Africa, at another in Spain, then in Italy, then in\nthe Far North.... Then he passed out of the atmosphere of the earth, and\nnow he is wandering all over the universe, still never coming into\nconditions in which he might disappear. Possibly he may be seen now in\nMars or in some star of the Southern Cross. But, my dear, the real point\non which the whole legend hangs lies in the fact that, exactly a\nthousand years from the day when the monk walked in the desert, the\nmirage will return to the atmosphere of the earth again and will appear\nto men. And it seems that the thousand years is almost up.... According\nto the legend, we may look out for the black monk to-day or to-morrow.\"\n\n\"A queer mirage,\" said Tanya, who did not like the legend.\n\n\"But the most wonderful part of it all,\" laughed Kovrin, \"is that I\nsimply cannot recall where I got this legend from. Have I read it\nsomewhere? Have I heard it? Or perhaps I dreamed of the black monk. I\nswear I don't remember. But the legend interests me. I have been\nthinking about it all day.\"\n\nLetting Tanya go back to her visitors, he went out of the house, and,\nlost in meditation, walked by the flower-beds. The sun was already\nsetting. The flowers, having just been watered, gave forth a damp,\nirritating fragrance. Indoors they began singing again, and in the\ndistance the violin had the effect of a human voice. Kovrin, racking his\nbrains to remember where he had read or heard the legend, turned slowly\ntowards the park, and unconsciously went as far as the river. By a\nlittle path that ran along the steep bank, between the bare roots, he\nwent down to the water, disturbed the peewits there and frightened two\nducks. The last rays of the setting sun still threw light here and there\non the gloomy pines, but it was quite dark on the surface of the river.\nKovrin crossed to the other side by the narrow bridge. Before him lay a\nwide field covered with young rye not yet in blossom. There was no\nliving habitation, no living soul in the distance, and it seemed as\nthough the little path, if one went along it, would take one to the\nunknown, mysterious place where the sun had just gone down, and where\nthe evening glow was flaming in immensity and splendour.\n\n\"How open, how free, how still it is here!\" thought Kovrin, walking\nalong the path. \"And it feels as though all the world were watching me,\nhiding and waiting for me to understand it....\"\n\nBut then waves began running across the rye, and a light evening breeze\nsoftly touched his uncovered head. A minute later there was another gust\nof wind, but stronger--the rye began rustling, and he heard behind him\nthe hollow murmur of the pines. Kovrin stood still in amazement. From\nthe horizon there rose up to the sky, like a whirlwind or a waterspout,\na tall black column. Its outline was indistinct, but from the first\ninstant it could be seen that it was not standing still, but moving with\nfearful rapidity, moving straight towards Kovrin, and the nearer it came\nthe smaller and the more distinct it was. Kovrin moved aside into the\nrye to make way for it, and only just had time to do so.\n\nA monk, dressed in black, with a grey head and black eyebrows, his arms\ncrossed over his breast, floated by him.... His bare feet did not touch\nthe earth. After he had floated twenty feet beyond him, he looked round\nat Kovrin, and nodded to him with a friendly but sly smile. But what a\npale, fearfully pale, thin face! Beginning to grow larger again, he flew\nacross the river, collided noiselessly with the clay bank and pines, and\npassing through them, vanished like smoke.\n\n\"Why, you see,\" muttered Kovrin, \"there must be truth in the legend.\"\n\nWithout trying to explain to himself the strange apparition, glad that\nhe had succeeded in seeing so near and so distinctly, not only the\nmonk's black garments, but even his face and eyes, agreeably excited, he\nwent back to the house.\n\nIn the park and in the garden people were moving about quietly, in the\nhouse they were playing--so he alone had seen the monk. He had an\nintense desire to tell Tanya and Yegor Semyonitch, but he reflected that\nthey would certainly think his words the ravings of delirium, and that\nwould frighten them; he had better say nothing.\n\nHe laughed aloud, sang, and danced the mazurka; he was in high spirits,\nand all of them, the visitors and Tanya, thought he had a peculiar look,\nradiant and inspired, and that he was very interesting.\n\n\nIII\n\nAfter supper, when the visitors had gone, he went to his room and lay\ndown on the sofa: he wanted to think about the monk. But a minute later\nTanya came in.\n\n\"Here, Andryusha; read father's articles,\" she said, giving him a bundle\nof pamphlets and proofs. \"They are splendid articles. He writes\ncapitally.\"\n\n\"Capitally, indeed!\" said Yegor Semyonitch, following her and smiling\nconstrainedly; he was ashamed. \"Don't listen to her, please; don't read\nthem! Though, if you want to go to sleep, read them by all means; they\nare a fine soporific.\"\n\n\"I think they are splendid articles,\" said Tanya, with deep conviction.\n\"You read them, Andryusha, and persuade father to write oftener. He\ncould write a complete manual of horticulture.\"\n\nYegor Semyonitch gave a forced laugh, blushed, and began uttering the\nphrases usually made use of by an embarrassed author. At last he began\nto give way.\n\n\"In that case, begin with Gaucher's article and these Russian articles,\"\nhe muttered, turning over the pamphlets with a trembling hand, \"or else\nyou won't understand. Before you read my objections, you must know what\nI am objecting to. But it's all nonsense ... tiresome stuff. Besides, I\nbelieve it's bedtime.\"\n\nTanya went away. Yegor Semyonitch sat down on the sofa by Kovrin and\nheaved a deep sigh.\n\n\"Yes, my boy ...\" he began after a pause. \"That's how it is, my dear\nlecturer. Here I write articles, and take part in exhibitions, and\nreceive medals.... Pesotsky, they say, has apples the size of a head,\nand Pesotsky, they say, has made his fortune with his garden. In short,\n'Kotcheby is rich and glorious.' But one asks oneself: what is it all\nfor? The garden is certainly fine, a model. It's not really a garden,\nbut a regular institution, which is of the greatest public importance\nbecause it marks, so to say, a new era in Russian agriculture and\nRussian industry. But, what's it for? What's the object of it?\"\n\n\"The fact speaks for itself.\"\n\n\"I do not mean in that sense. I meant to ask: what will happen to the\ngarden when I die? In the condition in which you see it now, it would\nnot be maintained for one month without me. The whole secret of success\nlies not in its being a big garden or a great number of labourers being\nemployed in it, but in the fact that I love the work. Do you understand?\nI love it perhaps more than myself. Look at me; I do everything myself.\nI work from morning to night: I do all the grafting myself, the pruning\nmyself, the planting myself. I do it all myself: when any one helps me I\nam jealous and irritable till I am rude. The whole secret lies in loving\nit--that is, in the sharp eye of the master; yes, and in the master's\nhands, and in the feeling that makes one, when one goes anywhere for an\nhour's visit, sit, ill at ease, with one's heart far away, afraid that\nsomething may have happened in the garden. But when I die, who will look\nafter it? Who will work? The gardener? The labourers? Yes? But I will\ntell you, my dear fellow, the worst enemy in the garden is not a hare,\nnot a cockchafer, and not the frost, but any outside person.\"\n\n\"And Tanya?\" asked Kovrin, laughing. \"She can't be more harmful than a\nhare? She loves the work and understands it.\"\n\n\"Yes, she loves it and understands it. If after my death the garden goes\nto her and she is the mistress, of course nothing better could be\nwished. But if, which God forbid, she should marry,\" Yegor Semyonitch\nwhispered, and looked with a frightened look at Kovrin, \"that's just it.\nIf she marries and children come, she will have no time to think about\nthe garden. What I fear most is: she will marry some fine gentleman, and\nhe will be greedy, and he will let the garden to people who will run it\nfor profit, and everything will go to the devil the very first year! In\nour work females are the scourge of God!\"\n\nYegor Semyonitch sighed and paused for a while.\n\n\"Perhaps it is egoism, but I tell you frankly: I don't want Tanya to get\nmarried. I am afraid of it! There is one young dandy comes to see us,\nbringing his violin and scraping on it; I know Tanya will not marry him,\nI know it quite well; but I can't bear to see him! Altogether, my boy, I\nam very queer. I know that.\"\n\nYegor Semyonitch got up and walked about the room in excitement, and it\nwas evident that he wanted to say something very important, but could\nnot bring himself to it.\n\n\"I am very fond of you, and so I am going to speak to you openly,\" he\ndecided at last, thrusting his hands into his pockets. \"I deal plainly\nwith certain delicate questions, and say exactly what I think, and I\ncannot endure so-called hidden thoughts. I will speak plainly: you are\nthe only man to whom I should not be afraid to marry my daughter. You\nare a clever man with a good heart, and would not let my beloved work go\nto ruin; and the chief reason is that I love you as a son, and I am\nproud of you. If Tanya and you could get up a romance somehow,\nthen--well! I should be very glad and even happy. I tell you this\nplainly, without mincing matters, like an honest man.\"\n\nKovrin laughed. Yegor Semyonitch opened the door to go out, and stood in\nthe doorway.\n\n\"If Tanya and you had a son, I would make a horticulturist of him,\" he\nsaid, after a moment's thought. \"However, this is idle dreaming.\nGoodnight.\"\n\nLeft alone, Kovrin settled himself more comfortably on the sofa and took\nup the articles. The title of one was \"On Intercropping\"; of another, \"A\nfew Words on the Remarks of Monsieur Z. concerning the Trenching of the\nSoil for a New Garden\"; a third, \"Additional Matter concerning Grafting\nwith a Dormant Bud\"; and they were all of the same sort. But what a\nrestless, jerky tone! What nervous, almost hysterical passion! Here was\nan article, one would have thought, with most peaceable and impersonal\ncontents: the subject of it was the Russian Antonovsky Apple. But Yegor\nSemyonitch began it with \"Audiatur altera pars,\" and finished it with\n\"Sapienti sat\"; and between these two quotations a perfect torrent of\nvenomous phrases directed \"at the learned ignorance of our recognised\nhorticultural authorities, who observe Nature from the height of their\nuniversity chairs,\" or at Monsieur Gaucher, \"whose success has been the\nwork of the vulgar and the dilettanti.\" \"And then followed an\ninappropriate, affected, and insincere regret that peasants who stole\nfruit and broke the branches could not nowadays be flogged.\n\n\"It is beautiful, charming, healthy work, but even in this there is\nstrife and passion,\" thought Kovrin, \"I suppose that everywhere and in\nall careers men of ideas are nervous, and marked by exaggerated\nsensitiveness. Most likely it must be so.\"\n\nHe thought of Tanya, who was so pleased with Yegor Semyonitch's\narticles. Small, pale, and so thin that her shoulder-blades stuck out,\nher eyes, wide and open, dark and intelligent, had an intent gaze, as\nthough looking for something. She walked like her father with a little\nhurried step. She talked a great deal and was fond of arguing,\naccompanying every phrase, however insignificant, with expressive\nmimicry and gesticulation. No doubt she was nervous in the extreme.\n\nKovrin went on reading the articles, but he understood nothing of them,\nand flung them aside. The same pleasant excitement with which he had\nearlier in the evening danced the mazurka and listened to the music was\nnow mastering him again and rousing a multitude of thoughts. He got up\nand began walking about the room, thinking about the black monk. It\noccurred to him that if this strange, supernatural monk had appeared to\nhim only, that meant that he was ill and had reached the point of having\nhallucinations. This reflection frightened him, but not for long.\n\n\"But I am all right, and I am doing no harm to any one; so there is no\nharm in my hallucinations,\" he thought; and he felt happy again.\n\nHe sat down on the sofa and clasped his hands round his head.\nRestraining the unaccountable joy which filled his whole being, he then\npaced up and down again, and sat down to his work. But the thought that\nhe read in the book did not satisfy him. He wanted something gigantic,\nunfathomable, stupendous. Towards morning he undressed and reluctantly\nwent to bed: he ought to sleep.\n\nWhen he heard the footsteps of Yegor Semyonitch going out into the\ngarden, Kovrin rang the bell and asked the footman to bring him some\nwine. He drank several glasses of Lafitte, then wrapped himself up, head\nand all; his consciousness grew clouded and he fell asleep.\n\n\nIV\n\nYegor Semyonitch and Tanya often quarrelled and said nasty things to\neach other.\n\nThey quarrelled about something that morning. Tanya burst out crying and\nwent to her room. She would not come down to dinner nor to tea. At first\nYegor Semyonitch went about looking sulky and dignified, as though to\ngive every one to understand that for him the claims of justice and good\norder were more important than anything else in the world; but he could\nnot keep it up for long, and soon sank into depression. He walked about\nthe park dejectedly, continually sighing: \"Oh, my God! My God!\" and at\ndinner did not eat a morsel. At last, guilty and conscience-stricken, he\nknocked at the locked door and called timidly:\n\n\"Tanya! Tanya!\"\n\nAnd from behind the door came a faint voice, weak with crying but still\ndetermined:\n\n\"Leave me alone, if you please.\"\n\nThe depression of the master and mistress was reflected in the whole\nhousehold, even in the labourers working in the garden. Kovrin was\nabsorbed in his interesting work, but at last he, too, felt dreary and\nuncomfortable. To dissipate the general ill-humour in some way, he made\nup his mind to intervene, and towards evening he knocked at Tanya's\ndoor. He was admitted.\n\n\"Fie, fie, for shame!\" he began playfully, looking with surprise at\nTanya's tear-stained, woebegone face, flushed in patches with crying.\n\"Is it really so serious? Fie, fie!\"\n\n\"But if you knew how he tortures me!\" she said, and floods of scalding\ntears streamed from her big eyes. \"He torments me to death,\" she went\non, wringing her hands. \"I said nothing to him ... nothing ... I only\nsaid that there was no need to keep ... too many labourers ... if we\ncould hire them by the day when we wanted them. You know ... you know\nthe labourers have been doing nothing for a whole week.... I ... I ...\nonly said that, and he shouted and ... said ... a lot of horrible\ninsulting things to me. What for?\"\n\n\"There, there,\" said Kovrin, smoothing her hair. \"You've quarrelled with\neach other, you've cried, and that's enough. You must not be angry for\nlong--that's wrong ... all the more as he loves you beyond everything.\"\n\n\"He has ... has spoiled my whole life,\" Tanya went on, sobbing. \"I hear\nnothing but abuse and ... insults. He thinks I am of no use in the\nhouse. Well! He is right. I shall go away to-morrow; I shall become a\ntelegraph clerk.... I don't care....\"\n\n\"Come, come, come.... You mustn't cry, Tanya. You mustn't, dear.... You\nare both hot-tempered and irritable, and you are both to blame. Come\nalong; I will reconcile you.\"\n\nKovrin talked affectionately and persuasively, while she went on crying,\ntwitching her shoulders and wringing her hands, as though some terrible\nmisfortune had really befallen her. He felt all the sorrier for her\nbecause her grief was not a serious one, yet she suffered extremely.\nWhat trivialities were enough to make this little creature miserable for\na whole day, perhaps for her whole life! Comforting Tanya, Kovrin\nthought that, apart from this girl and her father, he might hunt the\nworld over and would not find people who would love him as one of\nthemselves, as one of their kindred. If it had not been for those two he\nmight very likely, having lost his father and mother in early childhood,\nnever to the day of his death have known what was meant by genuine\naffection and that naive, uncritical love which is only lavished on very\nclose blood relations; and he felt that the nerves of this weeping,\nshaking girl responded to his half-sick, overstrained nerves like iron\nto a magnet. He never could have loved a healthy, strong, rosy-cheeked\nwoman, but pale, weak, unhappy Tanya attracted him.\n\nAnd he liked stroking her hair and her shoulders, pressing her hand and\nwiping away her tears.... At last she left off crying. She went on for a\nlong time complaining of her father and her hard, insufferable life in\nthat house, entreating Kovrin to put himself in her place; then she\nbegan, little by little, smiling, and sighing that God had given her\nsuch a bad temper. At last, laughing aloud, she called herself a fool,\nand ran out of the room.\n\nWhen a little later Kovrin went into the garden, Yegor Semyonitch and\nTanya were walking side by side along an avenue as though nothing had\nhappened, and both were eating rye bread with salt on it, as both were\nhungry.\n\n\nV\n\nGlad that he had been so successful in the part of peacemaker, Kovrin\nwent into the park. Sitting on a garden seat, thinking, he heard the\nrattle of a carriage and a feminine laugh--visitors were arriving. When\nthe shades of evening began falling on the garden, the sounds of the\nviolin and singing voices reached him indistinctly, and that reminded\nhim of the black monk. Where, in what land or in what planet, was that\noptical absurdity moving now?\n\nHardly had he recalled the legend and pictured in his imagination the\ndark apparition he had seen in the rye-field, when, from behind a\npine-tree exactly opposite, there came out noiselessly, without the\nslightest rustle, a man of medium height with uncovered grey head, all\nin black, and barefooted like a beggar, and his black eyebrows stood out\nconspicuously on his pale, death-like face. Nodding his head graciously,\nthis beggar or pilgrim came noiselessly to the seat and sat down, and\nKovrin recognised him as the black monk.\n\nFor a minute they looked at one another, Kovrin with amazement, and the\nmonk with friendliness, and, just as before, a little slyness, as though\nhe were thinking something to himself.\n\n\"But you are a mirage,\" said Kovrin. \"Why are you here and sitting\nstill? That does not fit in with the legend.\"\n\n\"That does not matter,\" the monk answered in a low voice, not\nimmediately turning his face towards him. \"The legend, the mirage, and I\nare all the products of your excited imagination. I am a phantom.\"\n\n\"Then you don't exist?\" said Kovrin.\n\n\"You can think as you like,\" said the monk, with a faint smile. \"I exist\nin your imagination, and your imagination is part of nature, so I exist\nin nature.\"\n\n\"You have a very old, wise, and extremely expressive face, as though you\nreally had lived more than a thousand years,\" said Kovrin. \"I did not\nknow that my imagination was capable of creating such phenomena. But why\ndo you look at me with such enthusiasm? Do you like me?\"\n\n\"Yes, you are one of those few who are justly called the chosen of God.\nYou do the service of eternal truth. Your thoughts, your designs, the\nmarvellous studies you are engaged in, and all your life, bear the\nDivine, the heavenly stamp, seeing that they are consecrated to the\nrational and the beautiful--that is, to what is eternal.\"\n\n\"You said 'eternal truth.' ... But is eternal truth of use to man and\nwithin his reach, if there is no eternal life?\"\n\n\"There is eternal life,\" said the monk.\n\n\"Do you believe in the immortality of man?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. A grand, brilliant future is in store for you men. And\nthe more there are like you on earth, the sooner will this future be\nrealised. Without you who serve the higher principle and live in full\nunderstanding and freedom, mankind would be of little account;\ndeveloping in a natural way, it would have to wait a long time for the\nend of its earthly history. You will lead it some thousands of years\nearlier into the kingdom of eternal truth--and therein lies your supreme\nservice. You are the incarnation of the blessing of God, which rests\nupon men.\"\n\n\"And what is the object of eternal life?\" asked Kovrin.\n\n\"As of all life--enjoyment. True enjoyment lies in knowledge, and\neternal life provides innumerable and inexhaustible sources of\nknowledge, and in that sense it has been said: 'In My Father's house\nthere are many mansions.'\"\n\n\"If only you knew how pleasant it is to hear you!\" said Kovrin, rubbing\nhis hands with satisfaction.\n\n\"I am very glad.\"\n\n\"But I know that when you go away I shall be worried by the question of\nyour reality. You are a phantom, an hallucination. So I am mentally\nderanged, not normal?\"\n\n\"What if you are? Why trouble yourself? You are ill because you have\noverworked and exhausted yourself, and that means that you have\nsacrificed your health to the idea, and the time is near at hand when\nyou will give up life itself to it. What could be better? That is the\ngoal towards which all divinely endowed, noble natures strive.\"\n\n\"If I know I am mentally affected, can I trust myself?\"\n\n\"And are you sure that the men of genius, whom all men trust, did not\nsee phantoms, too? The learned say now that genius is allied to madness.\nMy friend, healthy and normal people are only the common herd.\nReflections upon the neurasthenia of the age, nervous exhaustion and\ndegeneracy, et cetera, can only seriously agitate those who place the\nobject of life in the present--that is, the common herd.\"\n\n\"The Romans used to say: _Mens sana in corpore sano._\"\n\n\"Not everything the Greeks and the Romans said is true. Exaltation,\nenthusiasm, ecstasy--all that distinguishes prophets, poets, martyrs for\nthe idea, from the common folk--is repellent to the animal side of\nman--that is, his physical health. I repeat, if you want to be healthy\nand normal, go to the common herd.\"\n\n\"Strange that you repeat what often comes into my mind,\" said Kovrin.\n\"It is as though you had seen and overheard my secret thoughts. But\ndon't let us talk about me. What do you mean by 'eternal truth'?\"\n\nThe monk did not answer. Kovrin looked at him and could not distinguish\nhis face. His features grew blurred and misty. Then the monk's head and\narms disappeared; his body seemed merged into the seat and the evening\ntwilight, and he vanished altogether.\n\n\"The hallucination is over,\" said Kovrin; and he laughed. \"It's a pity.\"\n\nHe went back to the house, light-hearted and happy. The little the monk\nhad said to him had flattered, not his vanity, but his whole soul, his\nwhole being. To be one of the chosen, to serve eternal truth, to stand\nin the ranks of those who could make mankind worthy of the kingdom of\nGod some thousands of years sooner--that is, to free men from some\nthousands of years of unnecessary struggle, sin, and suffering; to\nsacrifice to the idea everything--youth, strength, health; to be ready\nto die for the common weal--what an exalted, what a happy lot! He\nrecalled his past--pure, chaste, laborious; he remembered what he had\nlearned himself and what he had taught to others, and decided that there\nwas no exaggeration in the monk's words.\n\nTanya came to meet him in the park: she was by now wearing a different\ndress.\n\n\"Are you here?\" she said. \"And we have been looking and looking for\nyou.... But what is the matter with you?\" she asked in wonder, glancing\nat his radiant, ecstatic face and eyes full of tears. \"How strange you\nare, Andryusha!\"\n\n\"I am pleased, Tanya,\" said Kovrin, laying his hand on her shoulders. \"I\nam more than pleased: I am happy. Tanya, darling Tanya, you are an\nextraordinary, nice creature. Dear Tanya, I am so glad, I am so glad!\"\n\nHe kissed both her hands ardently, and went on:\n\n\"I have just passed through an exalted, wonderful, unearthly moment. But\nI can't tell you all about it or you would call me mad and not believe\nme. Let us talk of you. Dear, delightful Tanya! I love you, and am used\nto loving you. To have you near me, to meet you a dozen times a day, has\nbecome a necessity of my existence; I don't know how I shall get on\nwithout you when I go back home.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" laughed Tanya, \"you will forget about us in two days. We are\nhumble people and you are a great man.\"\n\n\"No; let us talk in earnest!\" he said. \"I shall take you with me, Tanya.\nYes? Will you come with me? Will you be mine?\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Tanya, and tried to laugh again, but the laugh would not\ncome, and patches of colour came into her face.\n\nShe began breathing quickly and walked very quickly, but not to the\nhouse, but further into the park.\n\n\"I was not thinking of it ... I was not thinking of it,\" she said,\nwringing her hands in despair.\n\nAnd Kovrin followed her and went on talking, with the same radiant,\nenthusiastic face:\n\n\"I want a love that will dominate me altogether; and that love only you,\nTanya, can give me. I am happy! I am happy!\"\n\nShe was overwhelmed, and huddling and shrinking together, seemed ten\nyears older all at once, while he thought her beautiful and expressed\nhis rapture aloud:\n\n\"How lovely she is!\"\n\n\nVI\n\nLearning from Kovrin that not only a romance had been got up, but that\nthere would even be a wedding, Yegor Semyonitch spent a long time in\npacing from one corner of the room to the other, trying to conceal his\nagitation. His hands began trembling, his neck swelled and turned\npurple, he ordered his racing droshky and drove off somewhere. Tanya,\nseeing how he lashed the horse, and seeing how he pulled his cap over\nhis ears, understood what he was feeling, shut herself up in her room,\nand cried the whole day.\n\nIn the hot-houses the peaches and plums were already ripe; the packing\nand sending off of these tender and fragile goods to Moscow took a great\ndeal of care, work, and trouble. Owing to the fact that the summer was\nvery hot and dry, it was necessary to water every tree, and a great deal\nof time and labour was spent on doing it. Numbers of caterpillars made\ntheir appearance, which, to Kovrin's disgust, the labourers and even\nYegor Semyonitch and Tanya squashed with their fingers. In spite of all\nthat, they had already to book autumn orders for fruit and trees, and to\ncarry on a great deal of correspondence. And at the very busiest time,\nwhen no one seemed to have a free moment, the work of the fields carried\noff more than half their labourers from the garden. Yegor Semyonitch,\nsunburnt, exhausted, ill-humoured, galloped from the fields to the\ngarden and back again; cried that he was being torn to pieces, and that\nhe should put a bullet through his brains.\n\nThen came the fuss and worry of the trousseau, to which the Pesotskys\nattached a good deal of importance. Every one's head was in a whirl from\nthe snipping of the scissors, the rattle of the sewing-machine, the\nsmell of hot irons, and the caprices of the dressmaker, a huffy and\nnervous lady. And, as ill-luck would have it, visitors came every day,\nwho had to be entertained, fed, and even put up for the night. But all\nthis hard labour passed unnoticed as though in a fog. Tanya felt that\nlove and happiness had taken her unawares, though she had, since she was\nfourteen, for some reason been convinced that Kovrin would marry her and\nno one else. She was bewildered, could not grasp it, could not believe\nherself.... At one minute such joy would swoop down upon her that she\nlonged to fly away to the clouds and there pray to God, at another\nmoment she would remember that in August she would have to part from her\nhome and leave her father; or, goodness knows why, the idea would occur\nto her that she was worthless--insignificant and unworthy of a great man\nlike Kovrin--and she would go to her room, lock herself in, and cry\nbitterly for several hours. When there were visitors, she would suddenly\nfancy that Kovrin looked extraordinarily handsome, and that all the\nwomen were in love with him and envying her, and her soul was filled\nwith pride and rapture, as though she had vanquished the whole world;\nbut he had only to smile politely at any young lady for her to be\ntrembling with jealousy, to retreat to her room--and tears again. These\nnew sensations mastered her completely; she helped her father\nmechanically, without noticing peaches, caterpillars or labourers, or\nhow rapidly the time was passing.\n\nIt was almost the same with Yegor Semyonitch. He worked from morning\ntill night, was always in a hurry, was irritable, and flew into rages,\nbut all of this was in a sort of spellbound dream. It seemed as though\nthere were two men in him: one was the real Yegor Semyonitch, who was\nmoved to indignation, and clutched his head in despair when he heard of\nsome irregularity from Ivan Karlovitch the gardener; and another--not\nthe real one--who seemed as though he were half drunk, would interrupt a\nbusiness conversation at half a word, touch the gardener on the\nshoulder, and begin muttering:\n\n\"Say what you like, there is a great deal in blood. His mother was a\nwonderful woman, most high-minded and intelligent. It was a pleasure to\nlook at her good, candid, pure face; it was like the face of an angel.\nShe drew splendidly, wrote verses, spoke five foreign languages,\nsang.... Poor thing! she died of consumption. The Kingdom of Heaven be\nhers.\"\n\nThe unreal Yegor Semyonitch sighed, and after a pause went on:\n\n\"When he was a boy and growing up in my house, he had the same angelic\nface, good and candid. The way he looks and talks and moves is as soft\nand elegant as his mother's. And his intellect! We were always struck\nwith his intelligence. To be sure, it's not for nothing he's a Master of\nArts! It's not for nothing! And wait a bit, Ivan Karlovitch, what will\nhe be in ten years' time? He will be far above us!\"\n\nBut at this point the real Yegor Semyonitch, suddenly coming to himself,\nwould make a terrible face, would clutch his head and cry:\n\n\"The devils! They have spoilt everything! They have ruined everything!\nThey have spoilt everything! The garden's done for, the garden's\nruined!\"\n\nKovrin, meanwhile, worked with the same ardour as before, and did not\nnotice the general commotion. Love only added fuel to the flames. After\nevery talk with Tanya he went to his room, happy and triumphant, took up\nhis book or his manuscript with the same passion with which he had just\nkissed Tanya and told her of his love. What the black monk had told him\nof the chosen of God, of eternal truth, of the brilliant future of\nmankind and so on, gave peculiar and extraordinary significance to his\nwork, and filled his soul with pride and the consciousness of his own\nexalted consequence. Once or twice a week, in the park or in the house,\nhe met the black monk and had long conversations with him, but this did\nnot alarm him, but, on the contrary, delighted him, as he was now firmly\npersuaded that such apparitions only visited the elect few who rise up\nabove their fellows and devote themselves to the service of the idea.\n\nOne day the monk appeared at dinner-time and sat in the dining-room\nwindow. Kovrin was delighted, and very adroitly began a conversation\nwith Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya of what might be of interest to the\nmonk; the black-robed visitor listened and nodded his head graciously,\nand Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya listened, too, and smiled gaily without\nsuspecting that Kovrin was not talking to them but to his hallucination.\n\nImperceptibly the fast of the Assumption was approaching, and soon after\ncame the wedding, which, at Yegor Semyonitch's urgent desire, was\ncelebrated with \"a flourish\"--that is, with senseless festivities that\nlasted for two whole days and nights. Three thousand roubles' worth of\nfood and drink was consumed, but the music of the wretched hired band,\nthe noisy toasts, the scurrying to and fro of the footmen, the uproar\nand crowding, prevented them from appreciating the taste of the\nexpensive wines and wonderful delicacies ordered from Moscow.\n\n\nVII\n\nOne long winter night Kovrin was lying in bed, reading a French novel.\nPoor Tanya, who had headaches in the evenings from living in town, to\nwhich she was not accustomed, had been asleep a long while, and, from\ntime to time, articulated some incoherent phrase in her restless dreams.\n\nIt struck three o'clock. Kovrin put out the light and lay down to sleep,\nlay for a long time with his eyes closed, but could not get to sleep\nbecause, as he fancied, the room was very hot and Tanya talked in her\nsleep. At half-past four he lighted the candle again, and this time he\nsaw the black monk sitting in an arm-chair near the bed.\n\n\"Good-morning,\" said the monk, and after a brief pause he asked: \"What\nare you thinking of now?\"\n\n\"Of fame,\" answered Kovrin. \"In the French novel I have just been\nreading, there is a description of a young _savant_, who does silly\nthings and pines away through worrying about fame. I can't understand\nsuch anxiety.\"\n\n\"Because you are wise. Your attitude towards fame is one of\nindifference, as towards a toy which no longer interests you.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is true.\"\n\n\"Renown does not allure you now. What is there flattering, amusing, or\nedifying in their carving your name on a tombstone, then time rubbing\noff the inscription together with the gilding? Moreover, happily there\nare too many of you for the weak memory of mankind to be able to retain\nyour names.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" assented Kovrin. \"Besides, why should they be remembered?\nBut let us talk of something else. Of happiness, for instance. What is\nhappiness?\"\n\nWhen the clock struck five, he was sitting on the bed, dangling his feet\nto the carpet, talking to the monk:\n\n\"In ancient times a happy man grew at last frightened of his happiness\n--it was so great!--and to propitiate the gods he brought as a sacrifice\nhis favourite ring. Do you know, I, too, like Polykrates, begin to be\nuneasy of my happiness. It seems strange to me that from morning to\nnight I feel nothing but joy; it fills my whole being and smothers all\nother feelings. I don't know what sadness, grief, or boredom is. Here I\nam not asleep; I suffer from sleeplessness, but I am not dull. I say it\nin earnest; I begin to feel perplexed.\"\n\n\"But why?\" the monk asked in wonder. \"Is joy a supernatural feeling?\nOught it not to be the normal state of man? The more highly a man is\ndeveloped on the intellectual and moral side, the more independent he\nis, the more pleasure life gives him. Socrates, Diogenes, and Marcus\nAurelius, were joyful, not sorrowful. And the Apostle tells us: 'Rejoice\ncontinually'; 'Rejoice and be glad.'\"\n\n\"But will the gods be suddenly wrathful?\" Kovrin jested; and he laughed.\n\"If they take from me comfort and make me go cold and hungry, it won't\nbe very much to my taste.\"\n\nMeanwhile Tanya woke up and looked with amazement and horror at her\nhusband. He was talking, addressing the arm-chair, laughing and\ngesticulating; his eyes were gleaming, and there was something strange\nin his laugh.\n\n\"Andryusha, whom are you talking to?\" she asked, clutching the hand he\nstretched out to the monk. \"Andryusha! Whom?\"\n\n\"Oh! Whom?\" said Kovrin in confusion. \"Why, to him.... He is sitting\nhere,\" he said, pointing to the black monk.\n\n\"There is no one here ... no one! Andryusha, you are ill!\"\n\nTanya put her arm round her husband and held him tight, as though\nprotecting him from the apparition, and put her hand over his eyes.\n\n\"You are ill!\" she sobbed, trembling all over. \"Forgive me, my precious,\nmy dear one, but I have noticed for a long time that your mind is\nclouded in some way.... You are mentally ill, Andryusha....\"\n\nHer trembling infected him, too. He glanced once more at the arm-chair,\nwhich was now empty, felt a sudden weakness in his arms and legs, was\nfrightened, and began dressing.\n\n\"It's nothing, Tanya; it's nothing,\" he muttered, shivering. \"I really\nam not quite well ... it's time to admit that.\"\n\n\"I have noticed it for a long time ... and father has noticed it,\" she\nsaid, trying to suppress her sobs. \"You talk to yourself, smile somehow\nstrangely ... and can't sleep. Oh, my God, my God, save us!\" she said in\nterror. \"But don't be frightened, Andryusha; for God's sake don't be\nfrightened....\"\n\nShe began dressing, too. Only now, looking at her, Kovrin realised the\ndanger of his position--realised the meaning of the black monk and his\nconversations with him. It was clear to him now that he was mad.\n\nNeither of them knew why they dressed and went into the dining-room: she\nin front and he following her. There they found Yegor Semyonitch\nstanding in his dressing-gown and with a candle in his hand. He was\nstaying with them, and had been awakened by Tanya's sobs.\n\n\"Don't be frightened, Andryusha,\" Tanya was saying, shivering as though\nin a fever; \"don't be frightened.... Father, it will all pass over ...\nit will all pass over....\"\n\nKovrin was too much agitated to speak. He wanted to say to his\nfather-in-law in a playful tone: \"Congratulate me; it appears I have\ngone out of my mind\"; but he could only move his lips and smile\nbitterly.\n\nAt nine o'clock in the morning they put on his jacket and fur coat,\nwrapped him up in a shawl, and took him in a carriage to a doctor.\n\n\nVIII\n\nSummer had come again, and the doctor advised their going into the\ncountry. Kovrin had recovered; he had left off seeing the black monk,\nand he had only to get up his strength. Staying at his father-in-law's,\nhe drank a great deal of milk, worked for only two hours out of the\ntwenty-four, and neither smoked nor drank wine.\n\nOn the evening before Elijah's Day they had an evening service in the\nhouse. When the deacon was handing the priest the censer the immense old\nroom smelt like a graveyard, and Kovrin felt bored. He went out into the\ngarden. Without noticing the gorgeous flowers, he walked about the\ngarden, sat down on a seat, then strolled about the park; reaching the\nriver, he went down and then stood lost in thought, looking at the\nwater. The sullen pines with their shaggy roots, which had seen him a\nyear before so young, so joyful and confident, were not whispering now,\nbut standing mute and motionless, as though they did not recognise him.\nAnd, indeed, his head was closely cropped, his beautiful long hair was\ngone, his step was lagging, his face was fuller and paler than last\nsummer.\n\nHe crossed by the footbridge to the other side. Where the year before\nthere had been rye the oats stood, reaped, and lay in rows. The sun had\nset and there was a broad stretch of glowing red on the horizon, a sign\nof windy weather next day. It was still. Looking in the direction from\nwhich the year before the black monk had first appeared, Kovrin stood\nfor twenty minutes, till the evening glow had begun to fade....\n\nWhen, listless and dissatisfied, he returned home the service was over.\nYegor Semyonitch and Tanya were sitting on the steps of the verandah,\ndrinking tea. They were talking of something, but, seeing Kovrin, ceased\nat once, and he concluded from their faces that their talk had been\nabout him.\n\n\"I believe it is time for you to have your milk,\" Tanya said to her\nhusband.\n\n\"No, it is not time yet ...\" he said, sitting down on the bottom step.\n\"Drink it yourself; I don't want it.\"\n\nTanya exchanged a troubled glance with her father, and said in a guilty\nvoice:\n\n\"You notice yourself that milk does you good.\"\n\n\"Yes, a great deal of good!\" Kovrin laughed. \"I congratulate you: I have\ngained a pound in weight since Friday.\" He pressed his head tightly in\nhis hands and said miserably: \"Why, why have you cured me? Preparations\nof bromide, idleness, hot baths, supervision, cowardly consternation at\nevery mouthful, at every step--all this will reduce me at last to\nidiocy. I went out of my mind, I had megalomania; but then I was\ncheerful, confident, and even happy; I was interesting and original. Now\nI have become more sensible and stolid, but I am just like every one\nelse: I am--mediocrity; I am weary of life.... Oh, how cruelly you have\ntreated me!... I saw hallucinations, but what harm did that do to any\none? I ask, what harm did that do any one?\"\n\n\"Goodness knows what you are saying!\" sighed Yegor Semyonitch. \"It's\npositively wearisome to listen to it.\"\n\n\"Then don't listen.\"\n\nThe presence of other people, especially Yegor Semyonitch, irritated\nKovrin now; he answered him drily, coldly, and even rudely, never looked\nat him but with irony and hatred, while Yegor Semyonitch was overcome\nwith confusion and cleared his throat guiltily, though he was not\nconscious of any fault in himself. At a loss to understand why their\ncharming and affectionate relations had changed so abruptly, Tanya\nhuddled up to her father and looked anxiously in his face; she wanted to\nunderstand and could not understand, and all that was clear to her was\nthat their relations were growing worse and worse every day, that of\nlate her father had begun to look much older, and her husband had grown\nirritable, capricious, quarrelsome and uninteresting. She could not\nlaugh or sing; at dinner she ate nothing; did not sleep for nights\ntogether, expecting something awful, and was so worn out that on one\noccasion she lay in a dead faint from dinner-time till evening. During\nthe service she thought her father was crying, and now while the three\nof them were sitting together on the terrace she made an effort not to\nthink of it.\n\n\"How fortunate Buddha, Mahomed, and Shakespeare were that their kind\nrelations and doctors did not cure them of their ecstasy and their\ninspiration,\" said Kovrin. \"If Mahomed had taken bromide for his nerves,\nhad worked only two hours out of the twenty-four, and had drunk milk,\nthat remarkable man would have left no more trace after him than his\ndog. Doctors and kind relations will succeed in stupefying mankind, in\nmaking mediocrity pass for genius and in bringing civilisation to ruin.\nIf only you knew,\" Kovrin said with annoyance, \"how grateful I am to\nyou.\"\n\nHe felt intense irritation, and to avoid saying too much, he got up\nquickly and went into the house. It was still, and the fragrance of the\ntobacco plant and the marvel of Peru floated in at the open window. The\nmoonlight lay in green patches on the floor and on the piano in the big\ndark dining-room. Kovrin remembered the raptures of the previous summer\nwhen there had been the same scent of the marvel of Peru and the moon\nhad shone in at the window. To bring back the mood of last year he went\nquickly to his study, lighted a strong cigar, and told the footman to\nbring him some wine. But the cigar left a bitter and disgusting taste in\nhis mouth, and the wine had not the same flavour as it had the year\nbefore. And so great is the effect of giving up a habit, the cigar and\nthe two gulps of wine made him giddy, and brought on palpitations of the\nheart, so that he was obliged to take bromide.\n\nBefore going to bed, Tanya said to him:\n\n\"Father adores you. You are cross with him about something, and it is\nkilling him. Look at him; he is ageing, not from day to day, but from\nhour to hour. I entreat you, Andryusha, for God's sake, for the sake of\nyour dead father, for the sake of my peace of mind, be affectionate to\nhim.\"\n\n\"I can't, I don't want to.\"\n\n\"But why?\" asked Tanya, beginning to tremble all over. \"Explain why.\"\n\n\"Because he is antipathetic to me, that's all,\" said Kovrin carelessly;\nand he shrugged his shoulders. \"But we won't talk about him: he is your\nfather.\"\n\n\"I can't understand, I can't,\" said Tanya, pressing her hands to her\ntemples and staring at a fixed point. \"Something incomprehensible,\nawful, is going on in the house. You have changed, grown unlike\nyourself.... You, clever, extraordinary man as you are, are irritated\nover trifles, meddle in paltry nonsense.... Such trivial things excite\nyou, that sometimes one is simply amazed and can't believe that it is\nyou. Come, come, don't be angry, don't be angry,\" she went on, kissing\nhis hands, frightened of her own words. \"You are clever, kind, noble.\nYou will be just to father. He is so good.\"\n\n\"He is not good; he is just good-natured. Burlesque old uncles like your\nfather, with well-fed, good-natured faces, extraordinarily hospitable\nand queer, at one time used to touch me and amuse me in novels and in\nfarces and in life; now I dislike them. They are egoists to the marrow\nof their bones. What disgusts me most of all is their being so well-fed,\nand that purely bovine, purely hoggish optimism of a full stomach.\"\n\nTanya sat down on the bed and laid her head on the pillow.\n\n\"This is torture,\" she said, and from her voice it was evident that she\nwas utterly exhausted, and that it was hard for her to speak. \"Not one\nmoment of peace since the winter.... Why, it's awful! My God! I am\nwretched.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course, I am Herod, and you and your father are the innocents.\nOf course.\"\n\nHis face seemed to Tanya ugly and unpleasant. Hatred and an ironical\nexpression did not suit him. And, indeed, she had noticed before that\nthere was something lacking in his face, as though ever since his hair\nhad been cut his face had changed, too. She wanted to say something\nwounding to him, but immediately she caught herself in this antagonistic\nfeeling, she was frightened and went out of the bedroom.\n\n\nIX\n\nKovrin received a professorship at the University. The inaugural address\nwas fixed for the second of December, and a notice to that effect was\nhung up in the corridor at the University. But on the day appointed he\ninformed the students' inspector, by telegram, that he was prevented by\nillness from giving the lecture.\n\nHe had haemorrhage from the throat. He was often spitting blood, but it\nhappened two or three times a month that there was a considerable loss\nof blood, and then he grew extremely weak and sank into a drowsy\ncondition. This illness did not particularly frighten him, as he knew\nthat his mother had lived for ten years or longer suffering from the\nsame disease, and the doctors assured him that there was no danger, and\nhad only advised him to avoid excitement, to lead a regular life, and to\nspeak as little as possible.\n\nIn January again his lecture did not take place owing to the same\nreason, and in February it was too late to begin the course. It had to\nbe postponed to the following year.\n\nBy now he was living not with Tanya, but with another woman, who was two\nyears older than he was, and who looked after him as though he were a\nbaby. He was in a calm and tranquil state of mind; he readily gave in to\nher, and when Varvara Nikolaevna--that was the name of his\nfriend--decided to take him to the Crimea, he agreed, though he had a\npresentiment that no good would come of the trip.\n\nThey reached Sevastopol in the evening and stopped at an hotel to rest\nand go on the next day to Yalta. They were both exhausted by the\njourney. Varvara Nikolaevna had some tea, went to bed and was soon\nasleep. But Kovrin did not go to bed. An hour before starting for the\nstation, he had received a letter from Tanya, and had not brought\nhimself to open it, and now it was lying in his coat pocket, and the\nthought of it excited him disagreeably. At the bottom of his heart he\ngenuinely considered now that his marriage to Tanya had been a mistake.\nHe was glad that their separation was final, and the thought of that\nwoman who in the end had turned into a living relic, still walking about\nthough everything seemed dead in her except her big, staring,\nintelligent eyes--the thought of her roused in him nothing but pity and\ndisgust with himself. The handwriting on the envelope reminded him how\ncruel and unjust he had been two years before, how he had worked off his\nanger at his spiritual emptiness, his boredom, his loneliness, and his\ndissatisfaction with life by revenging himself on people in no way to\nblame. He remembered, also, how he had torn up his dissertation and all\nthe articles he had written during his illness, and how he had thrown\nthem out of window, and the bits of paper had fluttered in the wind and\ncaught on the trees and flowers. In every line of them he saw strange,\nutterly groundless pretension, shallow defiance, arrogance, megalomania;\nand they made him feel as though he were reading a description of his\nvices. But when the last manuscript had been torn up and sent flying out\nof window, he felt, for some reason, suddenly bitter and angry; he went\nto his wife and said a great many unpleasant things to her. My God, how\nhe had tormented her! One day, wanting to cause her pain, he told her\nthat her father had played a very unattractive part in their romance,\nthat he had asked him to marry her. Yegor Semyonitch accidentally\noverheard this, ran into the room, and, in his despair, could not utter\na word, could only stamp and make a strange, bellowing sound as though\nhe had lost the power of speech, and Tanya, looking at her father, had\nuttered a heart-rending shriek and had fallen into a swoon. It was\nhideous.\n\nAll this came back into his memory as he looked at the familiar writing.\nKovrin went out on to the balcony; it was still warm weather and there\nwas a smell of the sea. The wonderful bay reflected the moonshine and\nthe lights, and was of a colour for which it was difficult to find a\nname. It was a soft and tender blending of dark blue and green; in\nplaces the water was like blue vitriol, and in places it seemed as\nthough the moonlight were liquefied and filling the bay instead of\nwater. And what harmony of colours, what an atmosphere of peace, calm,\nand sublimity!\n\nIn the lower storey under the balcony the windows were probably open,\nfor women's voices and laughter could be heard distinctly. Apparently\nthere was an evening party.\n\nKovrin made an effort, tore open the envelope, and, going back into his\nroom, read:\n\n\"My father is just dead. I owe that to you, for you have killed him. Our\ngarden is being ruined; strangers are managing it already--that is, the\nvery thing is happening that poor father dreaded. That, too, I owe to\nyou. I hate you with my whole soul, and I hope you may soon perish. Oh,\nhow wretched I am! Insufferable anguish is burning my soul.... My curses\non you. I took you for an extraordinary man, a genius; I loved you, and\nyou have turned out a madman....\"\n\nKovrin could read no more, he tore up the letter and threw it away. He\nwas overcome by an uneasiness that was akin to terror. Varvara\nNikolaevna was asleep behind the screen, and he could hear her\nbreathing. From the lower storey came the sounds of laughter and women's\nvoices, but he felt as though in the whole hotel there were no living\nsoul but him. Because Tanya, unhappy, broken by sorrow, had cursed him\nin her letter and hoped for his perdition, he felt eerie and kept\nglancing hurriedly at the door, as though he were afraid that the\nuncomprehended force which two years before had wrought such havoc in\nhis life and in the life of those near him might come into the room and\nmaster him once more.\n\nHe knew by experience that when his nerves were out of hand the best\nthing for him to do was to work. He must sit down to the table and force\nhimself, at all costs, to concentrate his mind on some one thought. He\ntook from his red portfolio a manuscript containing a sketch of a small\nwork of the nature of a compilation, which he had planned in case he\nshould find it dull in the Crimea without work. He sat down to the table\nand began working at this plan, and it seemed to him that his calm,\npeaceful, indifferent mood was coming back. The manuscript with the\nsketch even led him to meditation on the vanity of the world. He thought\nhow much life exacts for the worthless or very commonplace blessings it\ncan give a man. For instance, to gain, before forty, a university chair,\nto be an ordinary professor, to expound ordinary and second-hand\nthoughts in dull, heavy, insipid language--in fact, to gain the position\nof a mediocre learned man, he, Kovrin, had had to study for fifteen\nyears, to work day and night, to endure a terrible mental illness, to\nexperience an unhappy marriage, and to do a great number of stupid and\nunjust things which it would have been pleasant not to remember. Kovrin\nrecognised clearly, now, that he was a mediocrity, and readily resigned\nhimself to it, as he considered that every man ought to be satisfied\nwith what he is.\n\nThe plan of the volume would have soothed him completely, but the torn\nletter showed white on the floor and prevented him from concentrating\nhis attention. He got up from the table, picked up the pieces of the\nletter and threw them out of window, but there was a light wind blowing\nfrom the sea, and the bits of paper were scattered on the windowsill.\nAgain he was overcome by uneasiness akin to terror, and he felt as\nthough in the whole hotel there were no living soul but himself.... He\nwent out on the balcony. The bay, like a living thing, looked at him\nwith its multitude of light blue, dark blue, turquoise and fiery eyes,\nand seemed beckoning to him. And it really was hot and oppressive, and\nit would not have been amiss to have a bathe.\n\nSuddenly in the lower storey under the balcony a violin began playing,\nand two soft feminine voices began singing. It was something familiar.\nThe song was about a maiden, full of sick fancies, who heard one night\nin her garden mysterious sounds, so strange and lovely that she was\nobliged to recognise them as a holy harmony which is unintelligible to\nus mortals, and so flies back to heaven.... Kovrin caught his breath and\nthere was a pang of sadness at his heart, and a thrill of the sweet,\nexquisite delight he had so long forgotten began to stir in his breast.\n\nA tall black column, like a whirlwind or a waterspout, appeared on the\nfurther side of the bay. It moved with fearful rapidity across the bay,\ntowards the hotel, growing smaller and darker as it came, and Kovrin\nonly just had time to get out of the way to let it pass.... The monk\nwith bare grey head, black eyebrows, barefoot, his arms crossed over his\nbreast, floated by him, and stood still in the middle of the room.\n\n\"Why did you not believe me?\" he asked reproachfully, looking\naffectionately at Kovrin. \"If you had believed me then, that you were a\ngenius, you would not have spent these two years so gloomily and so\nwretchedly.\"\n\nKovrin already believed that he was one of God's chosen and a genius; he\nvividly recalled his conversations with the monk in the past and tried\nto speak, but the blood flowed from his throat on to his breast, and not\nknowing what he was doing, he passed his hands over his breast, and his\ncuffs were soaked with blood. He tried to call Varvara Nikolaevna, who\nwas asleep behind the screen; he made an effort and said:\n\n\"Tanya!\"\n\nHe fell on the floor, and propping himself on his arms, called again:\n\n\"Tanya!\"\n\nHe called Tanya, called to the great garden with the gorgeous flowers\nsprinkled with dew, called to the park, the pines with their shaggy\nroots, the rye-field, his marvellous learning, his youth, courage,\njoy--called to life, which was so lovely. He saw on the floor near his\nface a great pool of blood, and was too weak to utter a word, but an\nunspeakable, infinite happiness flooded his whole being. Below, under\nthe balcony, they were playing the serenade, and the black monk\nwhispered to him that he was a genius, and that he was dying only\nbecause his frail human body had lost its balance and could no longer\nserve as the mortal garb of genius.\n\nWhen Varvara Nikolaevna woke up and came out from behind the screen,\nKovrin was dead, and a blissful smile was set upon his face.\n\n\n\n\nVOLODYA\n\n\nAT five o'clock one Sunday afternoon in summer, Volodya, a plain, shy,\nsickly-looking lad of seventeen, was sitting in the arbour of the\nShumihins' country villa, feeling dreary. His despondent thought flowed\nin three directions. In the first place, he had next day, Monday, an\nexamination in mathematics; he knew that if he did not get through the\nwritten examination on the morrow, he would be expelled, for he had\nalready been two years in the sixth form and had two and three-quarter\nmarks for algebra in his annual report. In the second place, his\npresence at the villa of the Shumihins, a wealthy family with\naristocratic pretensions, was a continual source of mortification to his\n_amour-propre_. It seemed to him that Madame Shumihin looked upon him\nand his maman as poor relations and dependents, that they laughed at his\n_maman_ and did not respect her. He had on one occasion accidently\noverheard Madame Shumihin, in the verandah, telling her cousin Anna\nFyodorovna that his _maman_ still tried to look young and got herself\nup, that she never paid her losses at cards, and had a partiality for\nother people's shoes and tobacco. Every day Volodya besought his _maman_\nnot to go to the Shumihins', and drew a picture of the humiliating part\nshe played with these gentlefolk. He tried to persuade her, said rude\nthings, but she--a frivolous, pampered woman, who had run through two\nfortunes, her own and her husband's, in her time, and always gravitated\ntowards acquaintances of high rank--did not understand him, and twice a\nweek Volodya had to accompany her to the villa he hated.\n\nIn the third place, the youth could not for one instant get rid of a\nstrange, unpleasant feeling which was absolutely new to him.... It\nseemed to him that he was in love with Anna Fyodorovna, the Shumihins'\ncousin, who was staying with them. She was a vivacious, loud-voiced,\nlaughter-loving, healthy, and vigorous lady of thirty, with rosy cheeks,\nplump shoulders, a plump round chin and a continual smile on her thin\nlips. She was neither young nor beautiful--Volodya knew that perfectly\nwell; but for some reason he could not help thinking of her, looking at\nher while she shrugged her plump shoulders and moved her flat back as\nshe played croquet, or after prolonged laughter and running up and down\nstairs, sank into a low chair, and, half closing her eyes and gasping\nfor breath, pretended that she was stifling and could not breathe. She\nwas married. Her husband, a staid and dignified architect, came once a\nweek to the villa, slept soundly, and returned to town. Volodya's\nstrange feeling had begun with his conceiving an unaccountable hatred\nfor the architect, and feeling relieved every time he went back to town.\n\nNow, sitting in the arbour, thinking of his examination next day, and of\nhis _maman_, at whom they laughed, he felt an intense desire to see\nNyuta (that was what the Shumihins called Anna Fyodorovna), to hear her\nlaughter and the rustle of her dress.... This desire was not like the\npure, poetic love of which he read in novels and about which he dreamed\nevery night when he went to bed; it was strange, incomprehensible; he\nwas ashamed of it, and afraid of it as of something very wrong and\nimpure, something which it was disagreeable to confess even to himself.\n\n\"It's not love,\" he said to himself. \"One can't fall in love with women\nof thirty who are married. It is only a little intrigue.... Yes, an\nintrigue....\"\n\nPondering on the \"intrigue,\" he thought of his uncontrollable shyness,\nhis lack of moustache, his freckles, his narrow eyes, and put himself in\nhis imagination side by side with Nyuta, and the juxtaposition seemed to\nhim impossible; then he made haste to imagine himself bold, handsome,\nwitty, dressed in the latest fashion.\n\nWhen his dreams were at their height, as he sat huddled together and\nlooking at the ground in a dark corner of the arbour, he heard the sound\nof light footsteps. Some one was coming slowly along the avenue. Soon\nthe steps stopped and something white gleamed in the entrance.\n\n\"Is there any one here?\" asked a woman's voice.\n\nVolodya recognised the voice, and raised his head in a fright.\n\n\"Who is here?\" asked Nyuta, going into the arbour. \"Ah, it is you,\nVolodya? What are you doing here? Thinking? And how can you go on\nthinking, thinking, thinking?... That's the way to go out of your mind!\"\n\nVolodya got up and looked in a dazed way at Nyuta. She had only just\ncome back from bathing. Over her shoulder there was hanging a sheet and\na rough towel, and from under the white silk kerchief on her head he\ncould see the wet hair sticking to her forehead. There was the cool damp\nsmell of the bath-house and of almond soap still hanging about her. She\nwas out of breath from running quickly. The top button of her blouse was\nundone, so that the boy saw her throat and bosom.\n\n\"Why don't you say something?\" said Nyuta, looking Volodya up and down.\n\"It's not polite to be silent when a lady talks to you. What a clumsy\nseal you are though, Volodya! You always sit, saying nothing, thinking\nlike some philosopher. There's not a spark of life or fire in you! You\nare really horrid!... At your age you ought to be living, skipping, and\njumping, chattering, flirting, falling in love.\"\n\nVolodya looked at the sheet that was held by a plump white hand, and\nthought....\n\n\"He's mute,\" said Nyuta, with wonder; \"it is strange, really.... Listen!\nBe a man! Come, you might smile at least! Phew, the horrid philosopher!\"\nshe laughed. \"But do you know, Volodya, why you are such a clumsy seal?\nBecause you don't devote yourself to the ladies. Why don't you? It's\ntrue there are no girls here, but there is nothing to prevent your\nflirting with the married ladies! Why don't you flirt with me, for\ninstance?\"\n\nVolodya listened and scratched his forehead in acute and painful\nirresolution.\n\n\"It's only very proud people who are silent and love solitude,\" Nyuta\nwent on, pulling his hand away from his forehead. \"You are proud,\nVolodya. Why do you look at me like that from under your brows? Look me\nstraight in the face, if you please! Yes, now then, clumsy seal!\"\n\nVolodya made up his mind to speak. Wanting to smile, he twitched his\nlower lip, blinked, and again put his hand to his forehead.\n\n\"I ... I love you,\" he said.\n\nNyuta raised her eyebrows in surprise, and laughed.\n\n\"What do I hear?\" she sang, as prima-donnas sing at the opera when they\nhear something awful. \"What? What did you say? Say it again, say it\nagain....\"\n\n\"I ... I love you!\" repeated Volodya.\n\nAnd without his will's having any part in his action, without reflection\nor understanding, he took half a step towards Nyuta and clutched her by\nthe arm. Everything was dark before his eyes, and tears came into them.\nThe whole world was turned into one big, rough towel which smelt of the\nbathhouse.\n\n\"Bravo, bravo!\" he heard a merry laugh. \"Why don't you speak? I want you\nto speak! Well?\"\n\nSeeing that he was not prevented from holding her arm, Volodya glanced\nat Nyuta's laughing face, and clumsily, awkwardly, put both arms round\nher waist, his hands meeting behind her back. He held her round the\nwaist with both arms, while, putting her hands up to her head, showing\nthe dimples in her elbows, she set her hair straight under the kerchief\nand said in a calm voice:\n\n\"You must be tactful, polite, charming, and you can only become that\nunder feminine influence. But what a wicked, angry face you have! You\nmust talk, laugh.... Yes, Volodya, don't be surly; you are young and\nwill have plenty of time for philosophising. Come, let go of me; I am\ngoing. Let go.\"\n\nWithout effort she released her waist, and, humming something, walked\nout of the arbour. Volodya was left alone. He smoothed his hair, smiled,\nand walked three times to and fro across the arbour, then he sat down on\nthe bench and smiled again. He felt insufferably ashamed, so much so\nthat he wondered that human shame could reach such a pitch of acuteness\nand intensity. Shame made him smile, gesticulate, and whisper some\ndisconnected words.\n\nHe was ashamed that he had been treated like a small boy, ashamed of his\nshyness, and, most of all, that he had had the audacity to put his arms\nround the waist of a respectable married woman, though, as it seemed to\nhim, he had neither through age nor by external quality, nor by social\nposition any right to do so.\n\nHe jumped up, went out of the arbour, and, without looking round, walked\ninto the recesses of the garden furthest from the house.\n\n\"Ah! only to get away from here as soon as possible,\" he thought,\nclutching his head. \"My God! as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe train by which Volodya was to go back with his _maman_ was at\neight-forty. There were three hours before the train started, but he\nwould with pleasure have gone to the station at once without waiting for\nhis _maman_.\n\nAt eight o'clock he went to the house. His whole figure was expressive\nof determination: what would be, would be! He made up his mind to go in\nboldly, to look them straight in the face, to speak in a loud voice,\nregardless of everything.\n\nHe crossed the terrace, the big hall and the drawing-room, and there\nstopped to take breath. He could hear them in the dining-room, drinking\ntea. Madame Shumihin, _maman_, and Nyuta were talking and laughing about\nsomething.\n\nVolodya listened.\n\n\"I assure you!\" said Nyuta. \"I could not believe my eyes! When he began\ndeclaring his passion and--just imagine!--put his arms round my waist, I\nshould not have recognised him. And you know he has a way with him! When\nhe told me he was in love with me, there was something brutal in his\nface, like a Circassian.\"\n\n\"Really!\" gasped _maman_, going off into a peal of laughter. \"Really!\nHow he does remind me of his father!\"\n\nVolodya ran back and dashed out into the open air.\n\n\"How could they talk of it aloud!\" he wondered in agony, clasping his\nhands and looking up to the sky in horror. \"They talk aloud in cold\nblood ... and _maman_ laughed!... _Maman!_ My God, why didst Thou give\nme such a mother? Why?\"\n\nBut he had to go to the house, come what might. He walked three times up\nand down the avenue, grew a little calmer, and went into the house.\n\n\"Why didn't you come in in time for tea?\" Madame Shumihin asked sternly.\n\n\"I am sorry, it's ... it's time for me to go,\" he muttered, not raising\nhis eyes. \"_Maman_, it's eight o'clock!\"\n\n\"You go alone, my dear,\" said his _maman_ languidly. \"I am staying the\nnight with Lili. Goodbye, my dear.... Let me make the sign of the cross\nover you.\"\n\nShe made the sign of the cross over her son, and said in French, turning\nto Nyuta:\n\n\"He's rather like Lermontov ... isn't he?\"\n\nSaying good-bye after a fashion, without looking any one in the face,\nVolodya went out of the dining-room. Ten minutes later he was walking\nalong the road to the station, and was glad of it. Now he felt neither\nfrightened nor ashamed; he breathed freely and easily.\n\nAbout half a mile from the station, he sat down on a stone by the side\nof the road, and gazed at the sun, which was half hidden behind a\nbarrow. There were lights already here and there at the station, and one\ngreen light glimmered dimly, but the train was not yet in sight. It was\npleasant to Volodya to sit still without moving, and to watch the\nevening coming little by little. The darkness of the arbour, the\nfootsteps, the smell of the bath-house, the laughter, and the waist--all\nthese rose with amazing vividness before his imagination, and all this\nwas no longer so terrible and important as before.\n\n\"It's of no consequence.... She did not pull her hand away, and laughed\nwhen I held her by the waist,\" he thought. \"So she must have liked it.\nIf she had disliked it she would have been angry....\"\n\nAnd now Volodya felt sorry that he had not had more boldness there in\nthe arbour. He felt sorry that he was so stupidly going away, and he was\nby now persuaded that if the same thing happened again he would be\nbolder and look at it more simply.\n\nAnd it would not be difficult for the opportunity to occur again. They\nused to stroll about for a long time after supper at the Shumihins'. If\nVolodya went for a walk with Nyuta in the dark garden, there would be an\nopportunity!\n\n\"I will go back,\" he thought, \"and will go by the morning train\nto-morrow.... I will say I have missed the train.\"\n\nAnd he turned back.... Madame Shumihin, _Maman_, Nyuta, and one of the\nnieces were sitting on the verandah, playing _vint_. When Volodya told\nthem the lie that he had missed the train, they were uneasy that he\nmight be late for the examination day, and advised him to get up early.\nAll the while they were playing he sat on one side, greedily watching\nNyuta and waiting.... He already had a plan prepared in his mind: he\nwould go up to Nyuta in the dark, would take her by the hand, then would\nembrace her; there would be no need to say anything, as both of them\nwould understand without words.\n\nBut after supper the ladies did not go for a walk in the garden, but\nwent on playing cards. They played till one o'clock at night, and then\nbroke up to go to bed.\n\n\"How stupid it all is!\" Volodya thought with vexation as he got into\nbed. \"But never mind; I'll wait till to-morrow ... to-morrow in the\narbour. It doesn't matter....\"\n\nHe did not attempt to go to sleep, but sat in bed, hugging his knees and\nthinking. All thought of the examination was hateful to him. He had\nalready made up his mind that they would expel him, and that there was\nnothing terrible about his being expelled. On the contrary, it was a\ngood thing--a very good thing, in fact. Next day he would be as free as\na bird; he would put on ordinary clothes instead of his school uniform,\nwould smoke openly, come out here, and make love to Nyuta when he liked;\nand he would not be a schoolboy but \"a young man.\" And as for the rest\nof it, what is called a career, a future, that was clear; Volodya would\ngo into the army or the telegraph service, or he would go into a\nchemist's shop and work his way up till he was a dispenser.... There\nwere lots of callings. An hour or two passed, and he was still sitting\nand thinking....\n\nTowards three o'clock, when it was beginning to get light, the door\ncreaked cautiously and his _maman_ came into the room.\n\n\"Aren't you asleep?\" she asked, yawning. \"Go to sleep; I have only come\nin for a minute.... I am only fetching the drops....\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Poor Lili has got spasms again. Go to sleep, my child, your\nexamination's to-morrow....\"\n\nShe took a bottle of something out of the cupboard, went to the window,\nread the label, and went away.\n\n\"Marya Leontyevna, those are not the drops!\" Volodya heard a woman's\nvoice, a minute later. \"That's convallaria, and Lili wants morphine. Is\nyour son asleep? Ask him to look for it....\"\n\nIt was Nyuta's voice. Volodya turned cold. He hurriedly put on his\ntrousers, flung his coat over his shoulders, and went to the door.\n\n\"Do you understand? Morphine,\" Nyuta explained in a whisper. \"There must\nbe a label in Latin. Wake Volodya; he will find it.\"\n\n_Maman_ opened the door and Volodya caught sight of Nyuta. She was\nwearing the same loose wrapper in which she had gone to bathe. Her hair\nhung loose and disordered on her shoulders, her face looked sleepy and\ndark in the half-light....\n\n\"Why, Volodya is not asleep,\" she said. \"Volodya, look in the cupboard\nfor the morphine, there's a dear! What a nuisance Lili is! She has\nalways something the matter.\"\n\n_Maman_ muttered something, yawned, and went away.\n\n\"Look for it,\" said Nyuta. \"Why are you standing still?\"\n\nVolodya went to the cupboard, knelt down, and began looking through the\nbottles and boxes of medicine. His hands were trembling, and he had a\nfeeling in his chest and stomach as though cold waves were running all\nover his inside. He felt suffocated and giddy from the smell of ether,\ncarbolic acid, and various drugs, which he quite unnecessarily snatched\nup with his trembling fingers and spilled in so doing.\n\n\"I believe _maman_ has gone,\" he thought. \"That's a good thing ... a\ngood thing....\"\n\n\"Will you be quick?\" said Nyuta, drawling.\n\n\"In a minute.... Here, I believe this is morphine,\" said Volodya,\nreading on one of the labels the word \"morph....\" \"Here it is!\"\n\nNyuta was standing in the doorway in such a way that one foot was in his\nroom and one was in the passage. She was tidying her hair, which was\ndifficult to put in order because it was so thick and long, and looked\nabsent-mindedly at Volodya. In her loose wrap, with her sleepy face and\nher hair down, in the dim light that came into the white sky not yet lit\nby the sun, she seemed to Volodya captivating, magnificent....\nFascinated, trembling all over, and remembering with relish how he had\nheld that exquisite body in his arms in the arbour, he handed her the\nbottle and said:\n\n\"How wonderful you are!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nShe came into the room.\n\n\"What?\" she asked, smiling.\n\nHe was silent and looked at her, then, just as in the arbour, he took\nher hand, and she looked at him with a smile and waited for what would\nhappen next.\n\n\"I love you,\" he whispered.\n\nShe left off smiling, thought a minute, and said:\n\n\"Wait a little; I think somebody is coming. Oh, these schoolboys!\" she\nsaid in an undertone, going to the door and peeping out into the\npassage. \"No, there is no one to be seen....\"\n\nShe came back.\n\nThen it seemed to Volodya that the room, Nyuta, the sunrise and\nhimself--all melted together in one sensation of acute, extraordinary,\nincredible bliss, for which one might give up one's whole life and face\neternal torments.... But half a minute passed and all that vanished.\nVolodya saw only a fat, plain face, distorted by an expression of\nrepulsion, and he himself suddenly felt a loathing for what had\nhappened.\n\n\"I must go away, though,\" said Nyuta, looking at Volodya with disgust.\n\"What a wretched, ugly ... fie, ugly duckling!\"\n\nHow unseemly her long hair, her loose wrap, her steps, her voice seemed\nto Volodya now!...\n\n\"'Ugly duckling' ...\" he thought after she had gone away. \"I really am\nugly ... everything is ugly.\"\n\nThe sun was rising, the birds were singing loudly; he could hear the\ngardener walking in the garden and the creaking of his wheelbarrow ...\nand soon afterwards he heard the lowing of the cows and the sounds of\nthe shepherd's pipe. The sunlight and the sounds told him that somewhere\nin this world there is a pure, refined, poetical life. But where was it?\nVolodya had never heard a word of it from his _maman_ or any of the\npeople round about him.\n\nWhen the footman came to wake him for the morning train, he pretended to\nbe asleep....\n\n\"Bother it! Damn it all!\" he thought.\n\nHe got up between ten and eleven.\n\nCombing his hair before the looking-glass, and looking at his ugly face,\npale from his sleepless night, he thought:\n\n\"It's perfectly true ... an ugly duckling!\"\n\nWhen _maman_ saw him and was horrified that he was not at his\nexamination, Volodya said:\n\n\"I overslept myself, _maman_.... But don't worry, I will get a medical\ncertificate.\"\n\nMadame Shumihin and Nyuta waked up at one o'clock. Volodya heard Madame\nShumihin open her window with a bang, heard Nyuta go off into a peal of\nlaughter in reply to her coarse voice. He saw the door open and a string\nof nieces and other toadies (among the latter was his _maman_) file into\nlunch, caught a glimpse of Nyuta's freshly washed laughing face, and,\nbeside her, the black brows and beard of her husband the architect, who\nhad just arrived.\n\nNyuta was wearing a Little Russian dress which did not suit her at all,\nand made her look clumsy; the architect was making dull and vulgar\njokes. The rissoles served at lunch had too much onion in them--so it\nseemed to Volodya. It also seemed to him that Nyuta laughed loudly on\npurpose, and kept glancing in his direction to give him to understand\nthat the memory of the night did not trouble her in the least, and that\nshe was not aware of the presence at table of the \"ugly duckling.\"\n\nAt four o'clock Volodya drove to the station with his _maman_. Foul\nmemories, the sleepless night, the prospect of expulsion from school,\nthe stings of conscience--all roused in him now an oppressive, gloomy\nanger. He looked at _maman_'s sharp profile, at her little nose, and at\nthe raincoat which was a present from Nyuta, and muttered:\n\n\"Why do you powder? It's not becoming at your age! You make yourself up,\ndon't pay your debts at cards, smoke other people's tobacco.... It's\nhateful! I don't love you ... I don't love you!\"\n\nHe was insulting her, and she moved her little eyes about in alarm,\nflung up her hands, and whispered in horror:\n\n\"What are you saying, my dear! Good gracious! the coachman will hear! Be\nquiet or the coachman will hear! He can overhear everything.\"\n\n\"I don't love you ... I don't love you!\" he went on breathlessly.\n\"You've no soul and no morals.... Don't dare to wear that raincoat! Do\nyou hear? Or else I will tear it into rags....\"\n\n\"Control yourself, my child,\" _maman_ wept; \"the coachman can hear!\"\n\n\"And where is my father's fortune? Where is your money? You have wasted\nit all. I am not ashamed of being poor, but I am ashamed of having such\na mother.... When my schoolfellows ask questions about you, I always\nblush.\"\n\nIn the train they had to pass two stations before they reached the town.\nVolodya spent all the time on the little platform between two carriages\nand shivered all over. He did not want to go into the compartment\nbecause there the mother he hated was sitting. He hated himself, hated\nthe ticket collectors, the smoke from the engine, the cold to which he\nattributed his shivering. And the heavier the weight on his heart, the\nmore strongly he felt that somewhere in the world, among some people,\nthere was a pure, honourable, warm, refined life, full of love,\naffection, gaiety, and serenity.... He felt this and was so intensely\nmiserable that one of the passengers, after looking in his face\nattentively, actually asked:\n\n\"You have the toothache, I suppose?\"\n\nIn the town _maman_ and Volodya lived with Marya Petrovna, a lady of\nnoble rank, who had a large flat and let rooms to boarders. _Maman_ had\ntwo rooms, one with windows and two pictures in gold frames hanging on\nthe walls, in which her bed stood and in which she lived, and a little\ndark room opening out of it in which Volodya lived. Here there was a\nsofa on which he slept, and, except that sofa, there was no other\nfurniture; the rest of the room was entirely filled up with wicker\nbaskets full of clothes, cardboard hat-boxes, and all sorts of rubbish,\nwhich _maman_ preserved for some reason or other. Volodya prepared his\nlessons either in his mother's room or in the \"general room,\" as the\nlarge room in which the boarders assembled at dinner-time and in the\nevening was called.\n\nOn reaching home he lay down on his sofa and put the quilt over him to\nstop his shivering. The cardboard hat-boxes, the wicker baskets, and the\nother rubbish, reminded him that he had not a room of his own, that he\nhad no refuge in which he could get away from his mother, from her\nvisitors, and from the voices that were floating up from the \"general\nroom.\" The satchel and the books lying about in the corners reminded him\nof the examination he had missed.... For some reason there came into his\nmind, quite inappropriately, Mentone, where he had lived with his father\nwhen he was seven years old; he thought of Biarritz and two little\nEnglish girls with whom he ran about on the sand.... He tried to recall\nto his memory the colour of the sky, the sea, the height of the waves,\nand his mood at the time, but he could not succeed. The English girls\nflitted before his imagination as though they were living; all the rest\nwas a medley of images that floated away in confusion....\n\n\"No; it's cold here,\" thought Volodya. He got up, put on his overcoat,\nand went into the \"general room.\"\n\nThere they were drinking tea. There were three people at the samovar:\n_maman_; an old lady with tortoiseshell pince-nez, who gave music\nlessons; and Avgustin Mihalitch, an elderly and very stout Frenchman,\nwho was employed at a perfumery factory.\n\n\"I have had no dinner to-day,\" said _maman_. \"I ought to send the maid\nto buy some bread.\"\n\n\"Dunyasha!\" shouted the Frenchman.\n\nIt appeared that the maid had been sent out somewhere by the lady of the\nhouse.\n\n\"Oh, that's of no consequence,\" said the Frenchman, with a broad smile.\n\"I will go for some bread myself at once. Oh, it's nothing.\"\n\nHe laid his strong, pungent cigar in a conspicuous place, put on his hat\nand went out. After he had gone away _maman_ began telling the music\nteacher how she had been staying at the Shumihins', and how warmly they\nwelcomed her.\n\n\"Lili Shumihin is a relation of mine, you know,\" she said. \"Her late\nhusband, General Shumihin, was a cousin of my husband. And she was a\nBaroness Kolb by birth....\"\n\n\"_Maman_, that's false!\" said Volodya irritably. \"Why tell lies?\"\n\nHe knew perfectly well that what his mother said was true; in what she\nwas saying about General Shumihin and about Baroness Kolb there was not\na word of lying, but nevertheless he felt that she was lying. There was\na suggestion of falsehood in her manner of speaking, in the expression\nof her face, in her eyes, in everything.\n\n\"You are lying,\" repeated Volodya; and he brought his fist down on the\ntable with such force that all the crockery shook and _maman_'s tea was\nspilt over. \"Why do you talk about generals and baronesses? It's all\nlies!\"\n\nThe music teacher was disconcerted, and coughed into her handkerchief,\naffecting to sneeze, and _maman_ began to cry.\n\n\"Where can I go?\" thought Volodya.\n\nHe had been in the street already; he was ashamed to go to his\nschoolfellows. Again, quite incongruously, he remembered the two little\nEnglish girls.... He paced up and down the \"general room,\" and went into\nAvgustin Mihalitch's room. Here there was a strong smell of ethereal\noils and glycerine soap. On the table, in the window, and even on the\nchairs, there were a number of bottles, glasses, and wineglasses\ncontaining fluids of various colours. Volodya took up from the table a\nnewspaper, opened it and read the title _Figaro_ ... There was a strong\nand pleasant scent about the paper. Then he took a revolver from the\ntable....\n\n\"There, there! Don't take any notice of it.\" The music teacher was\ncomforting _maman_ in the next room. \"He is young! Young people of his\nage never restrain themselves. One must resign oneself to that.\"\n\n\"No, Yevgenya Andreyevna; he's too spoilt,\" said _maman_ in a singsong\nvoice. \"He has no one in authority over him, and I am weak and can do\nnothing. Oh, I am unhappy!\"\n\nVolodya put the muzzle of the revolver to his mouth, felt something like\na trigger or spring, and pressed it with his finger.... Then felt\nsomething else projecting, and once more pressed it. Taking the muzzle\nout of his mouth, he wiped it with the lapel of his coat, looked at the\nlock. He had never in his life taken a weapon in his hand before....\n\n\"I believe one ought to raise this ...\" he reflected. \"Yes, it seems\nso.\"\n\nAvgustin Mihalitch went into the \"general room,\" and with a laugh began\ntelling them about something. Volodya put the muzzle in his mouth again,\npressed it with his teeth, and pressed something with his fingers. There\nwas a sound of a shot.... Something hit Volodya in the back of his head\nwith terrible violence, and he fell on the table with his face downwards\namong the bottles and glasses. Then he saw his father, as in Mentone, in\na top-hat with a wide black band on it, wearing mourning for some lady,\nsuddenly seize him by both hands, and they fell headlong into a very\ndeep, dark pit.\n\nThen everything was blurred and vanished.\n\n\n\n\nAN ANONYMOUS STORY\n\n\nI\n\nTHROUGH causes which it is not the time to go into in detail, I had to\nenter the service of a Petersburg official called Orlov, in the capacity\nof a footman. He was about five and thirty, and was called Georgy*\nIvanitch.\n\n*Both _g's_ hard, as in \"Gorgon\"; _e_ like _ai_ in _rain_.\n\nI entered this Orlov's service on account of his father, a prominent\npolitical man, whom I looked upon as a serious enemy of my cause. I\nreckoned that, living with the son, I should--from the conversations I\nshould hear, and from the letters and papers I should find on the\ntable--learn every detail of the father's plans and intentions.\n\nAs a rule at eleven o'clock in the morning the electric bell rang in my\nfootman's quarters to let me know that my master was awake. When I went\ninto the bedroom with his polished shoes and brushed clothes, Georgy\nIvanitch would be sitting in his bed with a face that looked, not\ndrowsy, but rather exhausted by sleep, and he would gaze off in one\ndirection without any sign of satisfaction at having waked. I helped him\nto dress, and he let me do it with an air of reluctance without speaking\nor noticing my presence; then with his head wet with washing, smelling\nof fresh scent, he used to go into the dining-room to drink his coffee.\nHe used to sit at the table, sipping his coffee and glancing through the\nnewspapers, while the maid Polya and I stood respectfully at the door\ngazing at him. Two grown-up persons had to stand watching with the\ngravest attention a third drinking coffee and munching rusks. It was\nprobably ludicrous and grotesque, but I saw nothing humiliating in\nhaving to stand near the door, though I was quite as well born and well\neducated as Orlov himself.\n\nI was in the first stage of consumption, and was suffering from\nsomething else, possibly even more serious than consumption. I don't\nknow whether it was the effect of my illness or of an incipient change\nin my philosophy of life of which I was not conscious at the time, but I\nwas, day by day, more possessed by a passionate, irritating longing for\nordinary everyday life. I yearned for mental tranquillity, health, fresh\nair, good food. I was becoming a dreamer, and, like a dreamer, I did not\nknow exactly what I wanted. Sometimes I felt inclined to go into a\nmonastery, to sit there for days together by the window and gaze at the\ntrees and the fields; sometimes I fancied I would buy fifteen acres of\nland and settle down as a country gentleman; sometimes I inwardly vowed\nto take up science and become a professor at some provincial university.\nI was a retired navy lieutenant; I dreamed of the sea, of our squadron,\nand of the corvette in which I had made the cruise round the world. I\nlonged to experience again the indescribable feeling when, walking in\nthe tropical forest or looking at the sunset in the Bay of Bengal, one\nis thrilled with ecstasy and at the same time homesick. I dreamed of\nmountains, women, music, and, with the curiosity of a child, I looked\ninto people's faces, listened to their voices. And when I stood at the\ndoor and watched Orlov sipping his coffee, I felt not a footman, but a\nman interested in everything in the world, even in Orlov.\n\nIn appearance Orlov was a typical Petersburger, with narrow shoulders, a\nlong waist, sunken temples, eyes of an indefinite colour, and scanty,\ndingy-coloured hair, beard and moustaches. His face had a stale,\nunpleasant look, though it was studiously cared for. It was particularly\nunpleasant when he was asleep or lost in thought. It is not worth while\ndescribing a quite ordinary appearance; besides, Petersburg is not\nSpain, and a man's appearance is not of much consequence even in love\naffairs, and is only of value to a handsome footman or coachman. I have\nspoken of Orlov's face and hair only because there was something in his\nappearance worth mentioning. When Orlov took a newspaper or book,\nwhatever it might be, or met people, whoever they be, an ironical smile\nbegan to come into his eyes, and his whole countenance assumed an\nexpression of light mockery in which there was no malice. Before reading\nor hearing anything he always had his irony in readiness, as a savage\nhas his shield. It was an habitual irony, like some old liquor brewed\nyears ago, and now it came into his face probably without any\nparticipation of his will, as it were by reflex action. But of that\nlater.\n\nSoon after midday he took his portfolio, full of papers, and drove to\nhis office. He dined away from home and returned after eight o'clock. I\nused to light the lamp and candles in his study, and he would sit down\nin a low chair with his legs stretched out on another chair, and,\nreclining in that position, would begin reading. Almost every day he\nbrought in new books with him or received parcels of them from the\nshops, and there were heaps of books in three languages, to say nothing\nof Russian, which he had read and thrown away, in the corners of my room\nand under my bed. He read with extraordinary rapidity. They say: \"Tell\nme what you read, and I'll tell you who you are.\" That may be true, but\nit was absolutely impossible to judge of Orlov by what he read. It was a\nregular hotchpotch. Philosophy, French novels, political economy,\nfinance, new poets, and publications of the firm _Posrednik_*--and he\nread it all with the same rapidity and with the same ironical expression\nin his eyes.\n\n* I.e., Tchertkov and others, publishers of Tolstoy, who issued good\nliterature for peasants' reading.\n\nAfter ten o'clock he carefully dressed, often in evening dress, very\nrarely in his _kammer-junker_'s uniform, and went out, returning in the\nmorning.\n\nOur relations were quiet and peaceful, and we never had any\nmisunderstanding. As a rule he did not notice my presence, and when he\ntalked to me there was no expression of irony on his face--he evidently\ndid not look upon me as a human being.\n\nI only once saw him angry. One day--it was a week after I had entered\nhis service--he came back from some dinner at nine o'clock; his face\nlooked ill-humoured and exhausted. When I followed him into his study to\nlight the candles, he said to me:\n\n\"There's a nasty smell in the flat.\"\n\n\"No, the air is fresh,\" I answered.\n\n\"I tell you, there's a bad smell,\" he answered irritably.\n\n\"I open the movable panes every day.\"\n\n\"Don't argue, blockhead!\" he shouted.\n\nI was offended, and was on the point of answering, and goodness knows\nhow it would have ended if Polya, who knew her master better than I did,\nhad not intervened.\n\n\"There really is a disagreeable smell,\" she said, raising her eyebrows.\n\"What can it be from? Stepan, open the pane in the drawing-room, and\nlight the fire.\"\n\nWith much bustle and many exclamations, she went through all the rooms,\nrustling her skirts and squeezing the sprayer with a hissing sound. And\nOrlov was still out of humour; he was obviously restraining himself not\nto vent his ill-temper aloud. He was sitting at the table and rapidly\nwriting a letter. After writing a few lines he snorted angrily and tore\nit up, then he began writing again.\n\n\"Damn them all!\" he muttered. \"They expect me to have an abnormal\nmemory!\"\n\nAt last the letter was written; he got up from the table and said,\nturning to me:\n\n\"Go to Znamensky Street and deliver this letter to Zinaida Fyodorovna\nKrasnovsky in person. But first ask the porter whether her husband\n--that is, Mr. Krasnovsky--has returned yet. If he has returned, don't\ndeliver the letter, but come back. Wait a minute!... If she asks whether\nI have any one here, tell her that there have been two gentlemen here\nsince eight o'clock, writing something.\"\n\nI drove to Znamensky Street. The porter told me that Mr. Krasnovsky had\nnot yet come in, and I made my way up to the third storey. The door was\nopened by a tall, stout, drab-coloured flunkey with black whiskers, who\nin a sleepy, churlish, and apathetic voice, such as only flunkeys use in\naddressing other flunkeys, asked me what I wanted. Before I had time to\nanswer, a lady dressed in black came hurriedly into the hall. She\nscrewed up her eyes and looked at me.\n\n\"Is Zinaida Fyodorovna at home?\" I asked.\n\n\"That is me,\" said the lady.\n\n\"A letter from Georgy Ivanitch.\"\n\nShe tore the letter open impatiently, and holding it in both hands, so\nthat I saw her sparkling diamond rings, she began reading. I made out a\npale face with soft lines, a prominent chin, and long dark lashes. From\nher appearance I should not have judged the lady to be more than five\nand twenty.\n\n\"Give him my thanks and my greetings,\" she said when she had finished\nthe letter. \"Is there any one with Georgy Ivanitch?\" she asked softly,\njoyfully, and as though ashamed of her mistrust.\n\n\"Two gentlemen,\" I answered. \"They're writing something.\"\n\n\"Give him my greetings and thanks,\" she repeated, bending her head\nsideways, and, reading the letter as she walked, she went noiselessly\nout. I saw few women at that time, and this lady of whom I had a passing\nglimpse made an impression on me. As I walked home I recalled her face\nand the delicate fragrance about her, and fell to dreaming. By the time\nI got home Orlov had gone out.\n\n\nII\n\nAnd so my relations with my employer were quiet and peaceful, but still\nthe unclean and degrading element which I so dreaded on becoming a\nfootman was conspicuous and made itself felt every day. I did not get on\nwith Polya. She was a well-fed and pampered hussy who adored Orlov\nbecause he was a gentleman and despised me because I was a footman.\nProbably, from the point of view of a real flunkey or cook, she was\nfascinating, with her red cheeks, her turned-up nose, her coquettish\nglances, and the plumpness, one might almost say fatness, of her person.\nShe powdered her face, coloured her lips and eyebrows, laced herself in,\nand wore a bustle, and a bangle made of coins. She walked with little\nripping steps; as she walked she swayed, or, as they say, wriggled her\nshoulders and back. The rustle of her skirts, the creaking of her stays,\nthe jingle her bangle and the vulgar smell of lip salve, toilet vinegar,\nand scent stolen from her master, aroused me whilst I was doing the\nrooms with her in the morning a sensation as though I were taking part\nwith her in some abomination.\n\nEither because I did not steal as she did, or because I displayed no\ndesire to become her lover, which she probably looked upon as an insult,\nor perhaps because she felt that I was a man of a different order, she\nhated me from the first day. My inexperience, my appearance--so unlike\na flunkey--and my illness, seemed to her pitiful and excited her\ndisgust. I had a bad cough at that time, and sometimes at night I\nprevented her from sleeping, as our rooms were only divided by a wooden\npartition, and every morning she said to me:\n\n\"Again you didn't let me sleep. You ought to be in hospital instead of\nin service.\"\n\nShe so genuinely believed that I was hardly a human being, but something\ninfinitely below her, that, like the Roman matrons who were not ashamed\nto bathe before their slaves, she sometimes went about in my presence in\nnothing but her chemise.\n\nOnce when I was in a happy, dreamy mood, I asked her at dinner (we had\nsoup and roast meat sent in from a restaurant every day)\n\n\"Polya, do you believe in God?\"\n\n\"Why, of course!\"\n\n\"Then,\" I went on, \"you believe there will be a day of judgment, and\nthat we shall have to answer to God for every evil action?\"\n\nShe gave me no reply, but simply made a contemptuous grimace, and,\nlooking that time at her cold eyes and over-fed expression, I realised\nthat for her complete and finished personality no God, no conscience, no\nlaws existed, and that if I had had to set fire to the house, to murder\nor to rob, I could not have hired a better accomplice.\n\nIn my novel surroundings I felt very uncomfortable for the first week at\nOrlov's before I got used to being addressed as \"thou,\" and being\nconstantly obliged to tell lies (saying \"My master is not at home\" when\nhe was). In my flunkey's swallow-tail I felt as though I were in armour.\nBut I grew accustomed to it in time. Like a genuine footman, I waited at\ntable, tidied the rooms, ran and drove about on errands of all sorts.\nWhen Orlov did not want to keep an appointment with Zinaida Fyodorovna,\nor when he forgot that he had promised to go and see her, I drove to\nZnamensky Street, put a letter into her hands and told a lie. And the\nresult of it all was quite different from what I had expected when I\nbecame a footman. Every day of this new life of mine was wasted for me\nand my cause, as Orlov never spoke of his father, nor did his visitors,\nand all I could learn of the stateman's doings was, as before, what I\ncould glean from the newspapers or from correspondence with my comrades.\nThe hundreds of notes and papers I used to find in the study and read\nhad not the remotest connection with what I was looking for. Orlov was\nabsolutely uninterested in his father's political work, and looked as\nthough he had never heard of it, or as though his father had long been\ndead.\n\n\nIII\n\nEvery Thursday we had visitors.\n\nI ordered a piece of roast beef from the restaurant and telephoned to\nEliseyev's to send us caviare, cheese, oysters, and so on. I bought\nplaying-cards. Polya was busy all day getting ready the tea-things and\nthe dinner service. To tell the truth, this spurt of activity came as a\npleasant change in our idle life, and Thursdays were for us the most\ninteresting days.\n\nOnly three visitors used to come. The most important and perhaps the\nmost interesting was the one called Pekarsky--a tall, lean man of five\nand forty, with a long hooked nose, with a big black beard, and a bald\npatch on his head. His eyes were large and prominent, and his expression\nwas grave and thoughtful like that of a Greek philosopher. He was on the\nboard of management of some railway, and also had some post in a bank;\nhe was a consulting lawyer in some important Government institution, and\nhad business relations with a large number of private persons as a\ntrustee, chairman of committees, and so on. He was of quite a low grade\nin the service, and modestly spoke of himself as a lawyer, but he had a\nvast influence. A note or card from him was enough to make a celebrated\ndoctor, a director of a railway, or a great dignitary see any one\nwithout waiting; and it was said that through his protection one might\nobtain even a post of the Fourth Class, and get any sort of unpleasant\nbusiness hushed up. He was looked upon as a very intelligent man, but\nhis was a strange, peculiar intelligence. He was able to multiply 213 by\n373 in his head instantaneously, or turn English pounds into German\nmarks without help of pencil or paper; he understood finance and railway\nbusiness thoroughly, and the machinery of Russian administration had no\nsecrets for him; he was a most skilful pleader in civil suits, and it\nwas not easy to get the better of him at law. But that exceptional\nintelligence could not grasp many things which are understood even by\nsome stupid people. For instance, he was absolutely unable to understand\nwhy people are depressed, why they weep, shoot themselves, and even kill\nothers; why they fret about things that do not affect them personally,\nand why they laugh when they read Gogol or Shtchedrin.... Everything\nabstract, everything belonging to the domain of thought and feeling, was\nto him boring and incomprehensible, like music to one who has no ear. He\nlooked at people simply from the business point of view, and divided\nthem into competent and incompetent. No other classification existed for\nhim. Honesty and rectitude were only signs of competence. Drinking,\ngambling, and debauchery were permissible, but must not be allowed to\ninterfere with business. Believing in God was rather stupid, but\nreligion ought be safeguarded, as the common people must have some\nprinciple to restrain them, otherwise they would not work. Punishment is\nonly necessary as deterrent. There was no need to go away for holidays,\nas it was just as nice in town. And so on. He was a widower and had no\nchildren, but lived on a large scale, as though he had a family, and\npaid three thousand roubles a year for his flat.\n\nThe second visitor, Kukushkin, an actual civil councillor though a young\nman, was short, and was conspicuous for his extremely unpleasant\nappearance, which was due to the disproportion between his fat, puffy\nbody and his lean little face. His lips were puckered up suavely, and\nhis little trimmed moustaches looked as though they had been fixed on\nwith glue. He was a man with the manners of a lizard. He did not walk,\nbut, as it were, crept along with tiny steps, squirming and sniggering,\nand when he laughed he showed his teeth. He was a clerk on special\ncommissions, and did nothing, though he received a good salary,\nespecially in the summer, when special and lucrative jobs were found for\nhim. He was a man of personal ambition, not only to the marrow of his\nbones, but more fundamentally--to the last drop of his blood; but even\nin his ambitions he was petty and did not rely on himself, but was\nbuilding his career on the chance favour flung him by his superiors. For\nthe sake of obtaining some foreign decoration, or for the sake of having\nhis name mentioned in the newspapers as having been present at some\nspecial service in the company of other great personages, he was ready\nto submit to any kind of humiliation, to beg, to flatter, to promise. He\nflattered Orlov and Pekarsky from cowardice, because he thought they\nwere powerful; he flattered Polya and me because we were in the service\nof a powerful man. Whenever I took off his fur coat he tittered and\nasked me: \"Stepan, are you married?\" and then unseemly vulgarities\nfollowed--by way of showing me special attention. Kukushkin flattered\nOrlov's weaknesses, humoured his corrupted and blase ways; to please him\nhe affected malicious raillery and atheism, in his company criticised\npersons before whom in other places he would slavishly grovel. When at\nsupper they talked of love and women, he pretended to be a subtle and\nperverse voluptuary. As a rule, one may say, Petersburg rakes are fond\nof talking of their abnormal tastes. Some young actual civil councillor\nis perfectly satisfied with the embraces of his cook or of some unhappy\nstreet-walker on the Nevsky Prospect, but to listen to him you would\nthink he was contaminated by all the vices of East and West combined,\nthat he was an honourary member of a dozen iniquitous secret societies\nand was already marked by the police. Kukushkin lied about himself in an\nunconscionable way, and they did not exactly disbelieve him, but paid\nlittle heed to his incredible stories.\n\nThe third guest was Gruzin, the son of a worthy and learned general; a\nman of Orlov's age, with long hair, short-sighted eyes, and gold\nspectacles. I remember his long white fingers, that looked like a\npianist's; and, indeed, there was something of a musician, of a\nvirtuoso, about his whole figure. The first violins in orchestras look\njust like that. He used to cough, suffered from migraine, and seemed\ninvalidish and delicate. Probably at home he was dressed and undressed\nlike a baby. He had finished at the College of Jurisprudence, and had at\nfirst served in the Department of Justice, then he was transferred to\nthe Senate; he left that, and through patronage had received a post in\nthe Department of Crown Estates, and had soon afterwards given that up.\nIn my time he was serving in Orlov's department; he was his head-clerk,\nbut he said that he should soon exchange into the Department of Justice\nagain. He took his duties and his shifting about from one post to\nanother with exceptional levity, and when people talked before him\nseriously of grades in the service, decorations, salaries, he smiled\ngood-naturedly and repeated Prutkov's aphorism: \"It's only in the\nGovernment service you learn the truth.\" He had a little wife with a\nwrinkled face, who was very jealous of him, and five weedy-looking\nchildren. He was unfaithful to his wife, he was only fond of his\nchildren when he saw them, and on the whole was rather indifferent to\nhis family, and made fun of them. He and his family existed on credit,\nborrowing wherever they could at every opportunity, even from his\nsuperiors in the office and porters in people's houses. His was a flabby\nnature; he was so lazy that he did not care what became of himself, and\ndrifted along heedless where or why he was going. He went where he was\ntaken. If he was taken to some low haunt, he went; if wine was set\nbefore him, he drank--if it were not put before him, he abstained; if\nwives were abused in his presence, he abused his wife, declaring she had\nruined his life--when wives were praised, he praised his and said quite\nsincerely: \"I am very fond of her, poor thing!\" He had no fur coat and\nalways wore a rug which smelt of the nursery. When at supper he rolled\nballs of bread and drank a great deal of red wine, absorbed in thought,\nstrange to say, I used to feel almost certain that there was something\nin him of which perhaps he had a vague sense, though in the bustle and\nvulgarity of his daily life he had not time to understand and appreciate\nit. He played a little on the piano. Sometimes he would sit down at the\npiano, play a chord or two, and begin singing softly:\n\n    \"What does the coming day bring to me?\"\n\nBut at once, as though afraid, he would get up and walk from the piano.\n\nThe visitors usually arrived about ten o'clock. They played cards in\nOrlov's study, and Polya and I handed them tea. It was only on these\noccasions that I could gauge the full sweetness of a flunkey's life.\nStanding for four or five hours at the door, watching that no one's\nglass should be empty, changing the ash-trays, running to the table to\npick up the chalk or a card when it was dropped, and, above all,\nstanding, waiting, being attentive without venturing to speak, to cough,\nto smile--is harder, I assure you, is harder than the hardest of field\nlabour. I have stood on watch at sea for four hours at a stretch on\nstormy winter nights, and to my thinking it is an infinitely easier\nduty.\n\nThey used to play cards till two, sometimes till three o'clock at night,\nand then, stretching, they would go into the dining-room to supper, or,\nas Orlov said, for a snack of something. At supper there was\nconversation. It usually began by Orlov's speaking with laughing eyes of\nsome acquaintance, of some book he had lately been reading, of a new\nappointment or Government scheme. Kukushkin, always ingratiating, would\nfall into his tone, and what followed was to me, in my mood at that\ntime, a revolting exhibition. The irony of Orlov and his friends knew no\nbounds, and spared no one and nothing. If they spoke of religion, it was\nwith irony; they spoke of philosophy, of the significance and object of\nlife--irony again, if any one began about the peasantry, it was with\nirony.\n\nThere is in Petersburg a species of men whose specialty it is to jeer at\nevery aspect of life; they cannot even pass by a starving man or a\nsuicide without saying something vulgar. But Orlov and his friends did\nnot jeer or make jokes, they talked ironically. They used to say that\nthere was no God, and personality was completely lost at death; the\nimmortals only existed in the French Academy. Real good did not and\ncould not possibly exist, as its existence was conditional upon human\nperfection, which was a logical absurdity. Russia was a country as poor\nand dull as Persia. The intellectual class was hopeless; in Pekarsky's\nopinion the overwhelming majority in it were incompetent persons, good\nfor nothing. The people were drunken, lazy, thievish, and degenerate. We\nhad no science, our literature was uncouth, our commerce rested on\nswindling--\"No selling without cheating.\" And everything was in that\nstyle, and everything was a subject for laughter.\n\nTowards the end of supper the wine made them more good-humoured, and\nthey passed to more lively conversation. They laughed over Gruzin's\nfamily life, over Kukushkin's conquests, or at Pekarsky, who had, they\nsaid, in his account book one page headed _Charity_ and another\n_Physiological Necessities_. They said that no wife was faithful; that\nthere was no wife from whom one could not, with practice, obtain\ncaresses without leaving her drawing-room while her husband was sitting\nin his study close by; that girls in their teens were perverted and knew\neverything. Orlov had preserved a letter of a schoolgirl of fourteen: on\nher way home from school she had \"hooked an officer on the Nevsky,\" who\nhad, it appears, taken her home with him, and had only let her go late\nin the evening; and she hastened to write about this to her school\nfriend to share her joy with her. They maintained that there was not and\nnever had been such a thing as moral purity, and that evidently it was\nunnecessary; mankind had so far done very well without it. The harm done\nby so-called vice was undoubtedly exaggerated. Vices which are punished\nby our legal code had not prevented Diogenes from being a philosopher\nand a teacher. Caesar and Cicero were profligates and at the same time\ngreat men. Cato in his old age married a young girl, and yet he was\nregarded as a great ascetic and a pillar of morality.\n\nAt three or four o'clock the party broke up or they went off together\nout of town, or to Officers' Street, to the house of a certain Varvara\nOssipovna, while I retired to my quarters, and was kept awake a long\nwhile by coughing and headache.\n\n\nIV\n\nThree weeks after I entered Orlov's service--it was Sunday morning, I\nremember--somebody rang the bell. It was not yet eleven, and Orlov was\nstill asleep. I went to open the door. You can imagine my astonishment\nwhen I found a lady in a veil standing at the door on the landing.\n\n\"Is Georgy Ivanitch up?\" she asked.\n\nFrom her voice I recognised Zinaida Fyodorovna, to whom I had taken\nletters in Znamensky Street. I don't remember whether I had time or\nself-possession to answer her--I was taken aback at seeing her. And,\nindeed, she did not need my answer. In a flash she had darted by me,\nand, filling the hall with the fragrance of her perfume, which I\nremember to this day, she went on, and her footsteps died away. For at\nleast half an hour afterwards I heard nothing. But again some one rang.\nThis time it was a smartly dressed girl, who looked like a maid in a\nwealthy family, accompanied by our house porter. Both were out of\nbreath, carrying two trunks and a dress-basket.\n\n\"These are for Zinaida Fyodorovna,\" said the girl.\n\nAnd she went down without saying another word. All this was mysterious,\nand made Polya, who had a deep admiration for the pranks of her betters,\nsmile slyly to herself; she looked as though she would like to say, \"So\nthat's what we're up to,\" and she walked about the whole time on tiptoe.\nAt last we heard footsteps; Zinaida Fyodorovna came quickly into the\nhall, and seeing me at the door of my room, said:\n\n\"Stepan, take Georgy Ivanitch his things.\"\n\nWhen I went in to Orlov with his clothes and his boots, he was sitting\non the bed with his feet on the bearskin rug. There was an air of\nembarrassment about his whole figure. He did not notice me, and my\nmenial opinion did not interest him; he was evidently perturbed and\nembarrassed before himself, before his inner eye. He dressed, washed,\nand used his combs and brushes silently and deliberately, as though\nallowing himself time to think over his position and to reflect, and\neven from his back one could see he was troubled and dissatisfied with\nhimself.\n\nThey drank coffee together. Zinaida Fyodorovna poured out coffee for\nherself and for Orlov, then she put her elbows on the table and laughed.\n\n\"I still can't believe it,\" she said. \"When one has been a long while on\none's travels and reaches a hotel at last, it's difficult to believe\nthat one hasn't to go on. It is pleasant to breathe freely.\"\n\nWith the expression of a child who very much wants to be mischievous,\nshe sighed with relief and laughed again.\n\n\"You will excuse me,\" said Orlov, nodding towards the coffee. \"Reading\nat breakfast is a habit I can't get over. But I can do two things at\nonce--read and listen.\"\n\n\"Read away.... You shall keep your habits and your freedom. But why do\nyou look so solemn? Are you always like that in the morning, or is it\nonly to-day? Aren't you glad?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am. But I must own I am a little overwhelmed.\"\n\n\"Why? You had plenty of time to prepare yourself for my descent upon\nyou. I've been threatening to come every day.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I didn't expect you to carry out your threat to-day.\"\n\n\"I didn't expect it myself, but that's all the better. It's all the\nbetter, my dear. It's best to have an aching tooth out and have done\nwith it.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear,\" she said, closing her eyes, \"all is well that ends well;\nbut before this happy ending, what suffering there has been! My laughing\nmeans nothing; I am glad, I am happy, but I feel more like crying than\nlaughing. Yesterday I had to fight a regular battle,\" she went on in\nFrench. \"God alone knows how wretched I was. But I laugh because I can't\nbelieve in it. I keep fancying that my sitting here drinking coffee with\nyou is not real, but a dream.\"\n\nThen, still speaking French, she described how she had broken with her\nhusband the day before and her eyes were alternately full of tears and\nof laughter while she gazed with rapture at Orlov. She told him her\nhusband had long suspected her, but had avoided explanations; they had\nfrequent quarrels, and usually at the most heated moment he would\nsuddenly subside into silence and depart to his study for fear that in\nhis exasperation he might give utterance to his suspicions or she might\nherself begin to speak openly. And she had felt guilty, worthless,\nincapable of taking a bold and serious step, and that had made her hate\nherself and her husband more every day, and she had suffered the\ntorments of hell. But the day before, when during a quarrel he had cried\nout in a tearful voice, \"My God, when will it end?\" and had walked off\nto his study, she had run after him like a cat after a mouse, and,\npreventing him from shutting the door, she had cried that she hated him\nwith her whole soul. Then he let her come into the study and she had\ntold him everything, had confessed that she loved some one else, that\nthat some one else was her real, most lawful husband, and that she\nthought it her true duty to go away to him that very day, whatever might\nhappen, if she were to be shot for it.\n\n\"There's a very romantic streak in you,\" Orlov interrupted, keeping his\neyes fixed on the newspaper.\n\nShe laughed and went on talking without touching her coffee. Her cheeks\nglowed and she was a little embarrassed by it, and she looked in\nconfusion at Polya and me. From what she went on to say I learnt that\nher husband had answered her with threats, reproaches, and finally\ntears, and that it would have been more accurate to say that she, and\nnot he, had been the attacking party.\n\n\"Yes, my dear, so long as I was worked up, everything went all right,\"\nshe told Orlov; \"but as night came on, my spirits sank. You don't\nbelieve in God, _George_, but I do believe a little, and I fear\nretribution. God requires of us patience, magnanimity, self-sacrifice,\nand here I am refusing to be patient and want to remodel my life to suit\nmyself. Is that right? What if from the point of view of God it's wrong?\nAt two o'clock in the night my husband came to me and said: 'You dare\nnot go away. I'll fetch you back through the police and make a scandal.'\nAnd soon afterwards I saw him like a shadow at my door. 'Have mercy on\nme! Your elopement may injure me in the service.' Those words had a\ncoarse effect upon me and made me feel stiff all over. I felt as though\nthe retribution were beginning already; I began crying and trembling\nwith terror. I felt as though the ceiling would fall upon me, that I\nshould be dragged off to the police-station at once, that you would grow\ncold to me--all sorts of things, in fact! I thought I would go into a\nnunnery or become a nurse, and give up all thought of happiness, but\nthen I remembered that you loved me, and that I had no right to dispose\nof myself without your knowledge; and everything in my mind was in a\ntangle--I was in despair and did not know what to do or think. But the\nsun rose and I grew happier. As soon as it was morning I dashed off to\nyou. Ah, what I've been through, dear one! I haven't slept for two\nnights!\"\n\nShe was tired out and excited. She was sleepy, and at the same time she\nwanted to talk endlessly, to laugh and to cry, and to go to a restaurant\nto lunch that she might feel her freedom.\n\n\"You have a cosy flat, but I am afraid it may be small for the two of\nus,\" she said, walking rapidly through all the rooms when they had\nfinished breakfast. \"What room will you give me? I like this one because\nit is next to your study.\"\n\nAt one o'clock she changed her dress in the room next to the study,\nwhich from that time she called hers, and she went off with Orlov to\nlunch. They dined, too, at a restaurant, and spent the long interval\nbetween lunch and dinner in shopping. Till late at night I was opening\nthe door to messengers and errand-boys from the shops. They bought,\namong other things, a splendid pier-glass, a dressing-table, a bedstead,\nand a gorgeous tea service which we did not need. They bought a regular\ncollection of copper saucepans, which we set in a row on the shelf in\nour cold, empty kitchen. As we were unpacking the tea service Polya's\neyes gleamed, and she looked at me two or three times with hatred and\nfear that I, not she, would be the first to steal one of these charming\ncups. A lady's writing-table, very expensive and inconvenient, came too.\nIt was evident that Zinaida Fyodorovna contemplated settling with us for\ngood, and meant to make the flat her home.\n\nShe came back with Orlov between nine and ten. Full of proud\nconsciousness that she had done something bold and out of the common,\npassionately in love, and, as she imagined, passionately loved,\nexhausted, looking forward to a sweet sound sleep, Zinaida Fyodorovna\nwas revelling in her new life. She squeezed her hands together in the\nexcess of her joy, declared that everything was delightful, and swore\nthat she would love Orlov for ever; and these vows, and the naive,\nalmost childish confidence that she too was deeply loved and would be\nloved forever, made her at least five years younger. She talked charming\nnonsense and laughed at herself.\n\n\"There's no other blessing greater than freedom!\" she said, forcing\nherself to say something serious and edifying. \"How absurd it is when\nyou think of it! We attach no value to our own opinion even when it is\nwise, but tremble before the opinion of all sorts of stupid people. Up\nto the last minute I was afraid of what other people would say, but as\nsoon as I followed my own instinct and made up my mind to go my own way,\nmy eyes were opened, I overcame my silly fears, and now I am happy and\nwish every one could be as happy!\"\n\nBut her thoughts immediately took another turn, and she began talking of\nanother flat, of wallpapers, horses, a trip to Switzerland and Italy.\nOrlov was tired by the restaurants and the shops, and was still\nsuffering from the same uneasiness that I had noticed in the morning. He\nsmiled, but more from politeness than pleasure, and when she spoke of\nanything seriously, he agreed ironically: \"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"Stepan, make haste and find us a good cook,\" she said to me.\n\n\"There's no need to be in a hurry over the kitchen arrangements,\" said\nOrlov, looking at me coldly. \"We must first move into another flat.\"\n\nWe had never had cooking done at home nor kept horses, because, as he\nsaid, \"he did not like disorder about him,\" and only put up with having\nPolya and me in his flat from necessity. The so-called domestic hearth\nwith its everyday joys and its petty cares offended his taste as\nvulgarity; to be with child, or to have children and talk about them,\nwas bad form, like a petty bourgeois. And I began to feel very curious\nto see how these two creatures would get on together in one flat--she,\ndomestic and home-loving with her copper saucepans and her dreams of a\ngood cook and horses; and he, fond of saying to his friends that a\ndecent and orderly man's flat ought, like a warship, to have nothing in\nit superfluous--no women, no children, no rags, no kitchen utensils.\n\n\nV\n\nThen I will tell you what happened the following Thursday. That day\nZinaida Fyodorovna dined at Content's or Donon's. Orlov returned home\nalone, and Zinaida Fyodorovna, as I learnt afterwards, went to the\nPetersburg Side to spend with her old governess the time visitors were\nwith us. Orlov did not care to show her to his friends. I realised that\nat breakfast, when he began assuring her that for the sake of her peace\nof mind it was essential to give up his Thursday evenings.\n\nAs usual the visitors arrived at almost the same time.\n\n\"Is your mistress at home, too?\" Kukushkin asked me in a whisper.\n\n\"No, sir,\" I answered.\n\nHe went in with a sly, oily look in his eyes, smiling mysteriously,\nrubbing his hands, which were cold from the frost.\n\n\"I have the honour to congratulate you,\" he said to Orlov, shaking all\nover with ingratiating, obsequious laughter. \"May you increase and\nmultiply like the cedars of Lebanon.\"\n\nThe visitors went into the bedroom, and were extremely jocose on the\nsubject of a pair of feminine slippers, the rug that had been put down\nbetween the two beds, and a grey dressing-jacket that hung at the foot\nof the bedstead. They were amused that the obstinate man who despised\nall the common place details of love had been caught in feminine snares\nin such a simple and ordinary way.\n\n\"He who pointed the finger of scorn is bowing the knee in homage,\"\nKukushkin repeated several times. He had, I may say in parenthesis, an\nunpleasant habit of adorning his conversation with texts in Church\nSlavonic. \"Sh-sh!\" he said as they went from the bedroom into the room\nnext to the study. \"Sh-sh! Here Gretchen is dreaming of her Faust.\"\n\nHe went off into a peal of laughter as though he had said something very\namusing. I watched Gruzin, expecting that his musical soul would not\nendure this laughter, but I was mistaken. His thin, good-natured face\nbeamed with pleasure. When they sat down to play cards, he, lisping and\nchoking with laughter, said that all that \"dear _George_\" wanted to\ncomplete his domestic felicity was a cherry-wood pipe and a guitar.\nPekarsky laughed sedately, but from his serious expression one could see\nthat Orlov's new love affair was distasteful to him. He did not\nunderstand what had happened exactly.\n\n\"But how about the husband?\" he asked in perplexity, after they had\nplayed three rubbers.\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered Orlov.\n\nPekarsky combed his big beard with his fingers and sank into thought,\nand he did not speak again till supper-time. When they were seated at\nsupper, he began deliberately, drawling every word:\n\n\"Altogether, excuse my saying so, I don't understand either of you. You\nmight love each other and break the seventh commandment to your heart's\ncontent--that I understand. Yes, that's comprehensible. But why make the\nhusband a party to your secrets? Was there any need for that?\"\n\n\"But does it make any difference?\"\n\n\"Hm!....\" Pekarsky mused. \"Well, then, let me tell you this, my friend,\"\nhe went on, evidently thinking hard: \"if I ever marry again and you take\nit into your head to seduce my wife, please do it so that I don't notice\nit. It's much more honest to deceive a man than to break up his family\nlife and injure his reputation. I understand. You both imagine that in\nliving together openly you are doing something exceptionally honourable\nand advanced, but I can't agree with that ... what shall I call it?...\nromantic attitude?\"\n\nOrlov made no reply. He was out of humour and disinclined to talk.\nPekarsky, still perplexed, drummed on the table with his fingers,\nthought a little, and said:\n\n\"I don't understand you, all the same. You are not a student and she is\nnot a dressmaker. You are both of you people with means. I should have\nthought you might have arranged a separate flat for her.\"\n\n\"No, I couldn't. Read Turgenev.\"\n\n\"Why should I read him? I have read him already.\"\n\n\"Turgenev teaches us in his novels that every exalted, noble-minded girl\nshould follow the man she loves to the ends of the earth, and should\nserve his idea,\" said Orlov, screwing up his eyes ironically. \"The ends\nof the earth are poetic license; the earth and all its ends can be\nreduced to the flat of the man she loves.... And so not to live in the\nsame flat with the woman who loves you is to deny her her exalted\nvocation and to refuse to share her ideals. Yes, my dear fellow,\nTurgenev wrote, and I have to suffer for it.\"\n\n\"What Turgenev has got to do with it I don't understand,\" said Gruzin\nsoftly, and he shrugged his shoulders. \"Do you remember, _George_, how\nin 'Three Meetings' he is walking late in the evening somewhere in\nItaly, and suddenly hears, _'Vieni pensando a me segretamente,'_\" Gruzin\nhummed. \"It's fine.\"\n\n\"But she hasn't come to settle with you by force,\" said Pekarsky. \"It\nwas your own wish.\"\n\n\"What next! Far from wishing it, I never imagined that this would ever\nhappen. When she said she was coming to live with me, I thought it was a\ncharming joke on her part.\"\n\nEverybody laughed.\n\n\"I couldn't have wished for such a thing,\" said Orlov in the tone of a\nman compelled to justify himself. \"I am not a Turgenev hero, and if I\never wanted to free Bulgaria I shouldn't need a lady's company. I look\nupon love primarily as a necessity of my physical nature, degrading and\nantagonistic to my spirit; it must either be satisfied with discretion\nor renounced altogether, otherwise it will bring into one's life\nelements as unclean as itself. For it to be an enjoyment and not a\ntorment, I will try to make it beautiful and to surround it with a mass\nof illusions. I should never go and see a woman unless I were sure\nbeforehand that she would be beautiful and fascinating; and I should\nnever go unless I were in the mood. And it is only in that way that we\nsucceed in deceiving one another, and fancying that we are in love and\nhappy. But can I wish for copper saucepans and untidy hair, or like to\nbe seen myself when I am unwashed or out of humour? Zinaida Fyodorovna\nin the simplicity of her heart wants me to love what I have been\nshunning all my life. She wants my flat to smell of cooking and washing\nup; she wants all the fuss of moving into another flat, of driving about\nwith her own horses; she wants to count over my linen and to look after\nmy health; she wants to meddle in my personal life at every instant, and\nto watch over every step; and at the same time she assures me genuinely\nthat my habits and my freedom will be untouched. She is persuaded that,\nlike a young couple, we shall very soon go for a honeymoon--that is,\nshe wants to be with me all the time in trains and hotels, while I like\nto read on the journey and cannot endure talking in trains.\"\n\n\"You should give her a talking to,\" said Pekarsky.\n\n\"What! Do you suppose she would understand me? Why, we think so\ndifferently. In her opinion, to leave one's papa and mamma or one's\nhusband for the sake of the man one loves is the height of civic virtue,\nwhile I look upon it as childish. To fall in love and run away with a\nman to her means beginning a new life, while to my mind it means nothing\nat all. Love and man constitute the chief interest of her life, and\npossibly it is the philosophy of the unconscious at work in her. Try and\nmake her believe that love is only a simple physical need, like the need\nof food or clothes; that it doesn't mean the end of the world if wives\nand husbands are unsatisfactory; that a man may be a profligate and a\nlibertine, and yet a man of honour and a genius; and that, on the other\nhand, one may abstain from the pleasures of love and at the same time be\na stupid, vicious animal! The civilised man of to-day, even among the\nlower classes--for instance, the French workman--spends ten _sous_ on\ndinner, five _sous_ on his wine, and five or ten _sous_ on woman, and\ndevotes his brain and nerves entirely to his work. But Zinaida\nFyodorovna assigns to love not so many _sous_, but her whole soul. I\nmight give her a talking to, but she would raise a wail in answer, and\ndeclare in all sincerity that I had ruined her, that she had nothing\nleft to live for.\"\n\n\"Don't say anything to her,\" said Pekarsky, \"but simply take a separate\nflat for her, that's all.\"\n\n\"That's easy to say.\"\n\nThere was a brief silence.\n\n\"But she is charming,\" said Kukushkin. \"She is exquisite. Such women\nimagine that they will be in love for ever, and abandon themselves with\ntragic intensity.\"\n\n\"But one must keep a head on one's shoulders,\" said Orlov; \"one must be\nreasonable. All experience gained from everyday life and handed down in\ninnumerable novels and plays, uniformly confirms the fact that adultery\nand cohabitation of any sort between decent people never lasts longer\nthan two or at most three years, however great the love may have been at\nthe beginning. That she ought to know. And so all this business of\nmoving, of saucepans, hopes of eternal love and harmony, are nothing but\na desire to delude herself and me. She is charming and exquisite--who\ndenies it? But she has turned my life upside down; what I have regarded\nas trivial and nonsensical till now she has forced me to raise to the\nlevel of a serious problem; I serve an idol whom I have never looked\nupon as God. She is charming--exquisite, but for some reason now when I\nam going home, I feel uneasy, as though I expected to meet with\nsomething inconvenient at home, such as workmen pulling the stove to\npieces and blocking up the place with heaps of bricks. In fact, I am no\nlonger giving up to love a _sous_, but part of my peace of mind and my\nnerves. And that's bad.\"\n\n\"And she doesn't hear this villain!\" sighed Kukushkin. \"My dear sir,\" he\nsaid theatrically, \"I will relieve you from the burdensome obligation to\nlove that adorable creature! I will wrest Zinaida Fyodorovna from you!\"\n\n\"You may ...\" said Orlov carelessly.\n\nFor half a minute Kukushkin laughed a shrill little laugh, shaking all\nover, then he said:\n\n\"Look out; I am in earnest! Don't you play the Othello afterwards!\"\n\nThey all began talking of Kukushkin's indefatigable energy in love\naffairs, how irresistible he was to women, and what a danger he was to\nhusbands; and how the devil would roast him in the other world for his\nimmorality in this. He screwed up his eyes and remained silent, and when\nthe names of ladies of their acquaintance were mentioned, he held up his\nlittle finger--as though to say they mustn't give away other people's\nsecrets.\n\nOrlov suddenly looked at his watch.\n\nHis friends understood, and began to take their leave. I remember that\nGruzin, who was a little drunk, was wearisomely long in getting off. He\nput on his coat, which was cut like children's coats in poor families,\npulled up the collar, and began telling some long-winded story; then,\nseeing he was not listened to, he flung the rug that smelt of the\nnursery over one shoulder, and with a guilty and imploring face begged\nme to find his hat.\n\n\"_George_, my angel,\" he said tenderly. \"Do as I ask you, dear boy; come\nout of town with us!\"\n\n\"You can go, but I can't. I am in the position of a married man now.\"\n\n\"She is a dear, she won't be angry. My dear chief, come along! It's\nglorious weather; there's snow and frost.... Upon my word, you want\nshaking up a bit; you are out of humour. I don't know what the devil is\nthe matter with you....\"\n\nOrlov stretched, yawned, and looked at Pekarsky.\n\n\"Are you going?\" he said, hesitating.\n\n\"I don't know. Perhaps.\"\n\n\"Shall I get drunk? All right, I'll come,\" said Orlov after some\nhesitation. \"Wait a minute; I'll get some money.\"\n\nHe went into the study, and Gruzin slouched in, too, dragging his rug\nafter him. A minute later both came back into the hall. Gruzin, a little\ndrunk and very pleased, was crumpling a ten-rouble note in his hands.\n\n\"We'll settle up to-morrow,\" he said. \"And she is kind, she won't be\ncross.... She is my Lisotchka's godmother; I am fond of her, poor thing!\nAh, my dear fellow!\" he laughed joyfully, and pressing his forehead on\nPekarsky's back. \"Ah, Pekarsky, my dear soul! Advocatissimus--as dry as\na biscuit, but you bet he is fond of women....\"\n\n\"Fat ones,\" said Orlov, putting on his fur coat. \"But let us get off, or\nwe shall be meeting her on the doorstep.\"\n\n\"_'Vieni pensando a me segretamente,'_\" hummed Gruzin.\n\nAt last they drove off: Orlov did not sleep at home, and returned next\nday at dinner-time.\n\n\nVI\n\nZinaida Fyodorovna had lost her gold watch, a present from her father.\nThis loss surprised and alarmed her. She spent half a day going through\nthe rooms, looking helplessly on all the tables and on all the windows.\nBut the watch had disappeared completely.\n\nOnly three days afterwards Zinaida Fyodorovna, on coming in, left her\npurse in the hall. Luckily for me, on that occasion it was not I but\nPolya who helped her off with her coat. When the purse was missed, it\ncould not be found in the hall.\n\n\"Strange,\" said Zinaida Fyodorovna in bewilderment. \"I distinctly\nremember taking it out of my pocket to pay the cabman ... and then I put\nit here near the looking-glass. It's very odd!\"\n\nI had not stolen it, but I felt as though I had stolen it and had been\ncaught in the theft. Tears actually came into my eyes. When they were\nseated at dinner, Zinaida Fyodorovna said to Orlov in French:\n\n\"There seem to be spirits in the flat. I lost my purse in the hall\nto-day, and now, lo and behold, it is on my table. But it's not quite a\ndisinterested trick of the spirits. They took out a gold coin and twenty\nroubles in notes.\"\n\n\"You are always losing something; first it's your watch and then it's\nyour money ...\" said Orlov. \"Why is it nothing of the sort ever happens\nto me?\"\n\nA minute later Zinaida Fyodorovna had forgotten the trick played by the\nspirits, and was telling with a laugh how the week before she had\nordered some notepaper and had forgotten to give her new address, and\nthe shop had sent the paper to her old home at her husband's, who had to\npay twelve roubles for it. And suddenly she turned her eyes on Polya and\nlooked at her intently. She blushed as she did so, and was so confused\nthat she began talking of something else.\n\nWhen I took in the coffee to the study, Orlov was standing with his back\nto the fire and she was sitting in an arm-chair facing him.\n\n\"I am not in a bad temper at all,\" she was saying in French. \"But I have\nbeen putting things together, and now I see it clearly. I can give you\nthe day and the hour when she stole my watch. And the purse? There can\nbe no doubt about it. Oh!\" she laughed as she took the coffee from me.\n\"Now I understand why I am always losing my handkerchiefs and gloves.\nWhatever you say, I shall dismiss the magpie to-morrow and send Stepan\nfor my Sofya. She is not a thief and has not got such a repulsive\nappearance.\"\n\n\"You are out of humour. To-morrow you will feel differently, and will\nrealise that you can't discharge people simply because you suspect\nthem.\"\n\n\"It's not suspicion; it's certainty,\" said Zinaida Fyodorovna. \"So long\nas I suspected that unhappy-faced, poor-looking valet of yours, I said\nnothing. It's too bad of you not to believe me, _George_.\"\n\n\"If we think differently about anything, it doesn't follow that I don't\nbelieve you. You may be right,\" said Orlov, turning round and flinging\nhis cigarette-end into the fire, \"but there is no need to be excited\nabout it, anyway. In fact, I must say, I never expected my humble\nestablishment would cause you so much serious worry and agitation.\nYou've lost a gold coin: never mind--you may have a hundred of mine; but\nto change my habits, to pick up a new housemaid, to wait till she is\nused to the place--all that's a tedious, tiring business and does not\nsuit me. Our present maid certainly is fat, and has, perhaps, a weakness\nfor gloves and handkerchiefs, but she is perfectly well behaved, well\ntrained, and does not shriek when Kukushkin pinches her.\"\n\n\"You mean that you can't part with her?... Why don't you say so?\"\n\n\"Are you jealous?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am,\" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, decidedly.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am jealous,\" she repeated, and tears glistened in her eyes. \"No,\nit's something worse ... which I find it difficult to find a name for.\"\nShe pressed her hands on her temples, and went on impulsively. \"You men\nare so disgusting! It's horrible!\"\n\n\"I see nothing horrible about it.\"\n\n\"I've not seen it; I don't know; but they say that you men begin with\nhousemaids as boys, and get so used to it that you feel no repugnance. I\ndon't know, I don't know, but I have actually read.... _George_, of\ncourse you are right,\" she said, going up to Orlov and changing to a\ncaressing and imploring tone. \"I really am out of humour to-day. But,\nyou must understand, I can't help it. She disgusts me and I am afraid of\nher. It makes me miserable to see her.\"\n\n\"Surely you can rise above such paltriness?\" said Orlov, shrugging his\nshoulders in perplexity, and walking away from the fire. \"Nothing could\nbe simpler: take no notice of her, and then she won't disgust you, and\nyou won't need to make a regular tragedy out of a trifle.\"\n\nI went out of the study, and I don't know what answer Orlov received.\nWhatever it was, Polya remained. After that Zinaida Fyodorovna never\napplied to her for anything, and evidently tried to dispense with her\nservices. When Polya handed her anything or even passed by her, jingling\nher bangle and rustling her skirts, she shuddered.\n\nI believe that if Gruzin or Pekarsky had asked Orlov to dismiss Polya he\nwould have done so without the slightest hesitation, without troubling\nabout any explanations. He was easily persuaded, like all indifferent\npeople. But in his relations with Zinaida Fyodorovna he displayed for\nsome reason, even in trifles, an obstinacy which sometimes was almost\nirrational. I knew beforehand that if Zinaida Fyodorovna liked anything,\nit would be certain not to please Orlov. When on coming in from shopping\nshe made haste to show him with pride some new purchase, he would glance\nat it and say coldly that the more unnecessary objects they had in the\nflat, the less airy it would be. It sometimes happened that after\nputting on his dress clothes to go out somewhere, and after saying\ngood-bye to Zinaida Fyodorovna, he would suddenly change his mind and\nremain at home from sheer perversity. I used to think that he remained\nat home then simply in order to feel injured.\n\n\"Why are you staying?\" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, with a show of vexation,\nthough at the same time she was radiant with delight. \"Why do you? You\nare not accustomed to spending your evenings at home, and I don't want\nyou to alter your habits on my account. Do go out as usual, if you don't\nwant me to feel guilty.\"\n\n\"No one is blaming you,\" said Orlov.\n\nWith the air of a victim he stretched himself in his easy-chair in the\nstudy, and shading his eyes with his hand, took up a book. But soon the\nbook dropped from his hand, he turned heavily in his chair, and again\nscreened his eyes as though from the sun. Now he felt annoyed that he\nhad not gone out.\n\n\"May I come in?\" Zinaida Fyodorovna would say, coming irresolutely into\nthe study. \"Are you reading? I felt dull by myself, and have come just\nfor a minute ... to have a peep at you.\"\n\nI remember one evening she went in like that, irresolutely and\ninappropriately, and sank on the rug at Orlov's feet, and from her soft,\ntimid movements one could see that she did not understand his mood and\nwas afraid.\n\n\"You are always reading ...\" she said cajolingly, evidently wishing to\nflatter him. \"Do you know, _George_, what is one of the secrets of your\nsuccess? You are very clever and well-read. What book have you there?\"\n\nOrlov answered. A silence followed for some minutes which seemed to me\nvery long. I was standing in the drawing-room, from which I could watch\nthem, and was afraid of coughing.\n\n\"There is something I wanted to tell you,\" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, and\nshe laughed; \"shall I? Very likely you'll laugh and say that I flatter\nmyself. You know I want, I want horribly to believe that you are staying\nat home to-night for my sake ... that we might spend the evening\ntogether. Yes? May I think so?\"\n\n\"Do,\" he said, screening his eyes. \"The really happy man is he who\nthinks not only of what is, but of what is not.\"\n\n\"That was a long sentence which I did not quite understand. You mean\nhappy people live in their imagination. Yes, that's true. I love to sit\nin your study in the evening and let my thoughts carry me far, far\naway.... It's pleasant sometimes to dream. Let us dream aloud,\n_George_.\"\n\n\"I've never been at a girls' boarding-school; I never learnt the art.\"\n\n\"You are out of humour?\" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, taking Orlov's hand.\n\"Tell me why. When you are like that, I'm afraid. I don't know whether\nyour head aches or whether you are angry with me....\"\n\nAgain there was a silence lasting several long minutes.\n\n\"Why have you changed?\" she said softly. \"Why are you never so tender or\nso gay as you used to be at Znamensky Street? I've been with you almost\na month, but it seems to me as though we had not yet begun to live, and\nhave not yet talked of anything as we ought to. You always answer me\nwith jokes or else with a long cold lecture like a teacher. And there is\nsomething cold in your jokes.... Why have you given up talking to me\nseriously?\"\n\n\"I always talk seriously.\"\n\n\"Well, then, let us talk. For God's sake, _George_.... Shall we?\"\n\n\"Certainly, but about what?\"\n\n\"Let us talk of our life, of our future,\" said Zinaida Fyodorovna\ndreamily. \"I keep making plans for our life, plans and plans--and I\nenjoy doing it so! _George_, I'll begin with the question, when are you\ngoing to give up your post?\"\n\n\"What for?\" asked Orlov, taking his hand from his forehead.\n\n\"With your views you cannot remain in the service. You are out of place\nthere.\"\n\n\"My views?\" Orlov repeated. \"My views? In conviction and temperament I\nam an ordinary official, one of Shtchedrin's heroes. You take me for\nsomething different, I venture to assure you.\"\n\n\"Joking again, _George_!\"\n\n\"Not in the least. The service does not satisfy me, perhaps; but,\nanyway, it is better for me than anything else. I am used to it, and in\nit I meet men of my own sort; I am in my place there and find it\ntolerable.\"\n\n\"You hate the service and it revolts you.\"\n\n\"Indeed? If I resign my post, take to dreaming aloud and letting myself\nbe carried away into another world, do you suppose that that world would\nbe less hateful to me than the service?\"\n\n\"You are ready to libel yourself in order to contradict me.\" Zinaida\nFyodorovna was offended and got up. \"I am sorry I began this talk.\"\n\n\"Why are you angry? I am not angry with you for not being an official.\nEvery one lives as he likes best.\"\n\n\"Why, do you live as you like best? Are you free? To spend your life\nwriting documents that are opposed to your own ideas,\" Zinaida\nFyodorovna went on, clasping her hands in despair: \"to submit to\nauthority, congratulate your superiors at the New Year, and then cards\nand nothing but cards: worst of all, to be working for a system which\nmust be distasteful to you--no, _George_, no! You should not make such\nhorrid jokes. It's dreadful. You are a man of ideas, and you ought to be\nworking for your ideas and nothing else.\"\n\n\"You really take me for quite a different person from what I am,\" sighed\nOrlov.\n\n\"Say simply that you don't want to talk to me. You dislike me, that's\nall,\" said Zinaida Fyodorovna through her tears.\n\n\"Look here, my dear,\" said Orlov admonishingly, sitting up in his chair.\n\"You were pleased to observe yourself that I am a clever, well-read man,\nand to teach one who knows does nothing but harm. I know very well all\nthe ideas, great and small, which you mean when you call me a man of\nideas. So if I prefer the service and cards to those ideas, you may be\nsure I have good grounds for it. That's one thing. Secondly, you have,\nso far as I know, never been in the service, and can only have drawn\nyour ideas of Government service from anecdotes and indifferent novels.\nSo it would not be amiss for us to make a compact, once for all, not to\ntalk of things we know already or of things about which we are not\ncompetent to speak.\"\n\n\"Why do you speak to me like that?\" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, stepping\nback as though in horror. \"What for? _George_, for God's sake, think\nwhat you are saying!\"\n\nHer voice quivered and broke; she was evidently trying to restrain her\ntears, but she suddenly broke into sobs.\n\n\"_George_, my darling, I am perishing!\" she said in French, dropping\ndown before Orlov, and laying her head on his knees. \"I am miserable, I\nam exhausted. I can't bear it, I can't bear it.... In my childhood my\nhateful, depraved stepmother, then my husband, now you ... you!... You\nmeet my mad love with coldness and irony.... And that horrible, insolent\nservant,\" she went on, sobbing. \"Yes, yes, I see: I am not your wife nor\nyour friend, but a woman you don't respect because she has become your\nmistress.... I shall kill myself!\"\n\nI had not expected that her words and her tears would make such an\nimpression on Orlov. He flushed, moved uneasily in his chair, and\ninstead of irony, his face wore a look of stupid, schoolboyish dismay.\n\n\"My darling, you misunderstood me,\" he muttered helplessly, touching her\nhair and her shoulders. \"Forgive me, I entreat you. I was unjust and I\nhate myself.\"\n\n\"I insult you with my whining and complaints. You are a true, generous\n... rare man--I am conscious of it every minute; but I've been horribly\ndepressed for the last few days ...\"\n\nZinaida Fyodorovna impulsively embraced Orlov and kissed him on the\ncheek.\n\n\"Only please don't cry,\" he said.\n\n\"No, no.... I've had my cry, and now I am better.\"\n\n\"As for the servant, she shall be gone to-morrow,\" he said, still moving\nuneasily in his chair.\n\n\"No, she must stay, _George!_ Do you hear? I am not afraid of her\nnow.... One must rise above trifles and not imagine silly things. You\nare right! You are a wonderful, rare person!\"\n\nShe soon left off crying. With tears glistening on her eyelashes,\nsitting on Orlov's knee, she told him in a low voice something touching,\nsomething like a reminiscence of childhood and youth. She stroked his\nface, kissed him, and carefully examined his hands with the rings on\nthem and the charms on his watch-chain. She was carried away by what she\nwas saying, and by being near the man she loved, and probably because\nher tears had cleared and refreshed her soul, there was a note of\nwonderful candour and sincerity in her voice. And Orlov played with her\nchestnut hair and kissed her hands, noiselessly pressing them to his\nlips.\n\nThen they had tea in the study, and Zinaida Fyodorovna read aloud some\nletters. Soon after midnight they went to bed. I had a fearful pain in\nmy side that night, and I could not get warm or go to sleep till\nmorning. I could hear Orlov go from the bedroom into his study. After\nsitting there about an hour, he rang the bell. In my pain and exhaustion\nI forgot all the rules and conventions, and went to his study in my\nnight attire, barefooted. Orlov, in his dressing-gown and cap, was\nstanding in the doorway, waiting for me.\n\n\"When you are sent for you should come dressed,\" he said sternly. \"Bring\nsome fresh candles.\"\n\nI was about to apologise, but suddenly broke into a violent cough, and\nclutched at the side of the door to save myself from falling.\n\n\"Are you ill?\" said Orlov.\n\nI believe it was the first time of our acquaintance that he addressed me\nnot in the singular--goodness knows why. Most likely, in my night\nclothes and with my face distorted by coughing, I played my part poorly,\nand was very little like a flunkey.\n\n\"If you are ill, why do you take a place?\" he said.\n\n\"That I may not die of starvation,\" I answered.\n\n\"How disgusting it all is, really!\" he said softly, going up to his\ntable.\n\nWhile hurriedly getting into my coat, I put up and lighted fresh\ncandles. He was sitting at the table, with feet stretched out on a low\nchair, cutting a book.\n\nI left him deeply engrossed, and the book did not drop out of his hands\nas it had done in the evening.\n\n\nVII\n\nNow that I am writing these lines I am restrained by that dread of\nappearing sentimental and ridiculous, in which I have been trained from\nchildhood; when I want to be affectionate or to say anything tender, I\ndon't know how to be natural. And it is that dread, together with lack\nof practice, that prevents me from being able to express with perfect\nclearness what was passing in my soul at that time.\n\nI was not in love with Zinaida Fyodorovna, but in the ordinary human\nfeeling I had for her, there was far more youth, freshness, and\njoyousness than in Orlov's love.\n\nAs I worked in the morning, cleaning boots or sweeping the rooms, I\nwaited with a thrill at my heart for the moment when I should hear her\nvoice and her footsteps. To stand watching her as she drank her coffee\nin the morning or ate her lunch, to hold her fur coat for her in the\nhall, and to put the goloshes on her little feet while she rested her\nhand on my shoulder; then to wait till the hall porter rang up for me,\nto meet her at the door, cold, and rosy, powdered with the snow, to\nlisten to her brief exclamations about the frost or the cabman--if only\nyou knew how much all that meant to me! I longed to be in love, to have\na wife and child of my own. I wanted my future wife to have just such a\nface, such a voice. I dreamed of it at dinner, and in the street when I\nwas sent on some errand, and when I lay awake at night. Orlov rejected\nwith disgust children, cooking, copper saucepans, and feminine\nknicknacks and I gathered them all up, tenderly cherished them in my\ndreams, loved them, and begged them of destiny. I had visions of a wife,\na nursery, a little house with garden paths....\n\nI knew that if I did love her I could never dare hope for the miracle of\nher returning my love, but that reflection did not worry me. In my\nquiet, modest feeling akin to ordinary affection, there was no jealousy\nof Orlov or even envy of him, since I realised that for a wreck like me\nhappiness was only to be found in dreams.\n\nWhen Zinaida Fyodorovna sat up night after night for her _George_,\nlooking immovably at a book of which she never turned a page, or when\nshe shuddered and turned pale at Polya's crossing the room, I suffered\nwith her, and the idea occurred to me to lance this festering wound as\nquickly as possible by letting her know what was said here at supper on\nThursdays; but--how was it to be done? More and more often I saw her\ntears. For the first weeks she laughed and sang to herself, even when\nOrlov was not at home, but by the second month there was a mournful\nstillness in our flat broken only on Thursday evenings.\n\nShe flattered Orlov, and to wring from him a counterfeit smile or kiss,\nwas ready to go on her knees to him, to fawn on him like a dog. Even\nwhen her heart was heaviest, she could not resist glancing into a\nlooking-glass if she passed one and straightening her hair. It seemed\nstrange to me that she could still take an interest in clothes and go\ninto ecstasies over her purchases. It did not seem in keeping with her\ngenuine grief. She paid attention to the fashions and ordered expensive\ndresses. What for? On whose account? I particularly remember one dress\nwhich cost four hundred roubles. To give four hundred roubles for an\nunnecessary, useless dress while women for their hard day's work get\nonly twenty kopecks a day without food, and the makers of Venice and\nBrussels lace are only paid half a franc a day on the supposition that\nthey can earn the rest by immorality! And it seemed strange to me that\nZinaida Fyodorovna was not conscious of it; it vexed me. But she had\nonly to go out of the house for me to find excuses and explanations for\neverything, and to be waiting eagerly for the hall porter to ring for\nme.\n\nShe treated me as a flunkey, a being of a lower order. One may pat a\ndog, and yet not notice it; I was given orders and asked questions, but\nmy presence was not observed. My master and mistress thought it unseemly\nto say more to me than is usually said to servants; if when waiting at\ndinner I had laughed or put in my word in the conversation, they would\ncertainly have thought I was mad and have dismissed me. Zinaida\nFyodorovna was favourably disposed to me, all the same. When she was\nsending me on some errand or explaining to me the working of a new lamp\nor anything of that sort, her face was extraordinarily kind, frank, and\ncordial, and her eyes looked me straight in the face. At such moments I\nalways fancied she remembered with gratitude how I used to bring her\nletters to Znamensky Street. When she rang the bell, Polya, who\nconsidered me her favourite and hated me for it, used to say with a\njeering smile:\n\n\"Go along, _your_ mistress wants you.\"\n\nZinaida Fyodorovna considered me as a being of a lower order, and did\nnot suspect that if any one in the house were in a humiliating position\nit was she. She did not know that I, a footman, was unhappy on her\naccount, and used to ask myself twenty times a day what was in store for\nher and how it would all end. Things were growing visibly worse day by\nday. After the evening on which they had talked of his official work,\nOrlov, who could not endure tears, unmistakably began to avoid\nconversation with her; whenever Zinaida Fyodorovna began to argue, or to\nbeseech him, or seemed on the point of crying, he seized some plausible\nexcuse for retreating to his study or going out. He more and more rarely\nslept at home, and still more rarely dined there: on Thursdays he was\nthe one to suggest some expedition to his friends. Zinaida Fyodorovna\nwas still dreaming of having the cooking done at home, of moving to a\nnew flat, of travelling abroad, but her dreams remained dreams. Dinner\nwas sent in from the restaurant. Orlov asked her not to broach the\nquestion of moving until after they had come back from abroad, and\napropos of their foreign tour, declared that they could not go till his\nhair had grown long, as one could not go trailing from hotel to hotel\nand serving the idea without long hair.\n\nTo crown it all, in Orlov's absence, Kukushkin began calling at the flat\nin the evening. There was nothing exceptional in his behaviour, but I\ncould never forget the conversation in which he had offered to cut Orlov\nout. He was regaled with tea and red wine, and he used to titter and,\nanxious to say something pleasant, would declare that a free union was\nsuperior in every respect to legal marriage, and that all decent people\nought really to come to Zinaida Fyodorovna and fall at her feet.\n\n\nVIII\n\nChristmas was spent drearily in vague anticipations of calamity. On New\nYear's Eve Orlov unexpectedly announced at breakfast that he was being\nsent to assist a senator who was on a revising commission in a certain\nprovince.\n\n\"I don't want to go, but I can't find an excuse to get off,\" he said\nwith vexation. \"I must go; there's nothing for it.\"\n\nSuch news instantly made Zinaida Fyodorovna's eyes look red. \"Is it for\nlong?\" she asked.\n\n\"Five days or so.\"\n\n\"I am glad, really, you are going,\" she said after a moment's thought.\n\"It will be a change for you. You will fall in love with some one on the\nway, and tell me about it afterwards.\"\n\nAt every opportunity she tried to make Orlov feel that she did not\nrestrict his liberty in any way, and that he could do exactly as he\nliked, and this artless, transparent strategy deceived no one, and only\nunnecessarily reminded Orlov that he was not free.\n\n\"I am going this evening,\" he said, and began reading the paper.\n\nZinaida Fyodorovna wanted to see him off at the station, but he\ndissuaded her, saying that he was not going to America, and not going to\nbe away five years, but only five days--possibly less.\n\nThe parting took place between seven and eight. He put one arm round\nher, and kissed her on the lips and on the forehead.\n\n\"Be a good girl, and don't be depressed while I am away,\" he said in a\nwarm, affectionate tone which touched even me. \"God keep you!\"\n\nShe looked greedily into his face, to stamp his dear features on her\nmemory, then she put her arms gracefully round his neck and laid her\nhead on his breast.\n\n\"Forgive me our misunderstandings,\" she said in French. \"Husband and\nwife cannot help quarrelling if they love each other, and I love you\nmadly. Don't forget me.... Wire to me often and fully.\"\n\nOrlov kissed her once more, and, without saying a word, went out in\nconfusion. When he heard the click of the lock as the door closed, he\nstood still in the middle of the staircase in hesitation and glanced\nupwards. It seemed to me that if a sound had reached him at that moment\nfrom above, he would have turned back. But all was quiet. He\nstraightened his coat and went downstairs irresolutely.\n\nThe sledges had been waiting a long while at the door. Orlov got into\none, I got into the other with two portmanteaus. It was a hard frost and\nthere were fires smoking at the cross-roads. The cold wind nipped my\nface and hands, and took my breath away as we drove rapidly along; and,\nclosing my eyes, I thought what a splendid woman she was. How she loved\nhim! Even useless rubbish is collected in the courtyards nowadays and\nused for some purpose, even broken glass is considered a useful\ncommodity, but something so precious, so rare, as the love of a refined,\nyoung, intelligent, and good woman is utterly thrown away and wasted.\nOne of the early sociologists regarded every evil passion as a force\nwhich might by judicious management be turned to good, while among us\neven a fine, noble passion springs up and dies away in impotence, turned\nto no account, misunderstood or vulgarised. Why is it?\n\nThe sledges stopped unexpectedly. I opened my eyes and I saw that we had\ncome to a standstill in Sergievsky Street, near a big house where\nPekarsky lived. Orlov got out of the sledge and vanished into the entry.\nFive minutes later Pekarsky's footman came out, bareheaded, and, angry\nwith the frost, shouted to me:\n\n\"Are you deaf? Pay the cabmen and go upstairs. You are wanted!\"\n\nAt a complete loss, I went to the first storey. I had been to Pekarsky's\nflat before--that is, I had stood in the hall and looked into the\ndrawing-room, and, after the damp, gloomy street, it always struck me by\nthe brilliance of its picture-frames, its bronzes and expensive\nfurniture. To-day in the midst of this splendour I saw Gruzin,\nKukushkin, and, after a minute, Orlov.\n\n\"Look here, Stepan,\" he said, coming up to me. \"I shall be staying here\ntill Friday or Saturday. If any letters or telegrams come, you must\nbring them here every day. At home, of course you will say that I have\ngone, and send my greetings. Now you can go.\"\n\nWhen I reached home Zinaida Fyodorovna was lying on the sofa in the\ndrawing-room, eating a pear. There was only one candle burning in the\ncandelabra.\n\n\"Did you catch the train?\" asked Zinaida Fyodorovna.\n\n\"Yes, madam. His honour sends his greetings.\"\n\nI went into my room and I, too, lay down. I had nothing to do, and I did\nnot want to read. I was not surprised and I was not indignant. I only\nracked my brains to think why this deception was necessary. It is only\nboys in their teens who deceive their mistresses like that. How was it\nthat a man who had thought and read so much could not imagine anything\nmore sensible? I must confess I had by no means a poor opinion of his\nintelligence. I believe if he had had to deceive his minister or any\nother influential person he would have put a great deal of skill and\nenergy into doing so; but to deceive a woman, the first idea that\noccurred to him was evidently good enough. If it succeeded--well and\ngood; if it did not, there would be no harm done--he could tell some\nother lie just as quickly and simply, with no mental effort.\n\nAt midnight when the people on the floor overhead were moving their\nchairs and shouting hurrah to welcome the New Year, Zinaida Fyodorovna\nrang for me from the room next to the study. Languid from lying down so\nlong, she was sitting at the table, writing something on a scrap of\npaper.\n\n\"I must send a telegram,\" she said, with a smile. \"Go to the station as\nquick as you can and ask them to send it after him.\"\n\nGoing out into the street, I read on the scrap of paper:\n\n\"May the New Year bring new happiness. Make haste and telegraph; I miss\nyou dreadfully. It seems an eternity. I am only sorry I can't send a\nthousand kisses and my very heart by telegraph. Enjoy yourself, my\ndarling.--ZINA.\"\n\nI sent the telegram, and next morning I gave her the receipt.\n\n\nIX\n\nThe worst of it was that Orlov had thoughtlessly let Polya, too, into\nthe secret of his deception, telling her to bring his shirts to\nSergievsky Street. After that, she looked at Zinaida Fyodorovna with a\nmalignant joy and hatred I could not understand, and was never tired of\nsnorting with delight to herself in her own room and in the hall.\n\n\"She's outstayed her welcome; it's time she took herself off!\" she would\nsay with zest. \"She ought to realise that herself....\"\n\nShe already divined by instinct that Zinaida Fyodorovna would not be\nwith us much longer, and, not to let the chance slip, carried off\neverything she set her eyes on--smelling-bottles, tortoise-shell\nhairpins, handkerchiefs, shoes! On the day after New Year's Day, Zinaida\nFyodorovna summoned me to her room and told me in a low voice that she\nmissed her black dress. And then she walked through all the rooms, with\na pale, frightened, and indignant face, talking to herself:\n\n\"It's too much! It's beyond everything. Why, it's unheard-of insolence!\"\n\nAt dinner she tried to help herself to soup, but could not--her hands\nwere trembling. Her lips were trembling, too. She looked helplessly at\nthe soup and at the little pies, waiting for the trembling to pass off,\nand suddenly she could not resist looking at Polya.\n\n\"You can go, Polya,\" she said. \"Stepan is enough by himself.\"\n\n\"I'll stay; I don't mind,\" answered Polya.\n\n\"There's no need for you to stay. You go away altogether,\" Zinaida\nFyodorovna went on, getting up in great agitation. \"You may look out for\nanother place. You can go at once.\"\n\n\"I can't go away without the master's orders. He engaged me. It must be\nas he orders.\"\n\n\"You can take orders from me, too! I am mistress here!\" said Zinaida\nFyodorovna, and she flushed crimson.\n\n\"You may be the mistress, but only the master can dismiss me. It was he\nengaged me.\"\n\n\"You dare not stay here another minute!\" cried Zinaida Fyodorovna, and\nshe struck the plate with her knife. \"You are a thief! Do you hear?\"\n\nZinaida Fyodorovna flung her dinner-napkin on the table, and with a\npitiful, suffering face, went quickly out of the room. Loudly sobbing\nand wailing something indistinct, Polya, too, went away. The soup and\nthe grouse got cold. And for some reason all the restaurant dainties on\nthe table struck me as poor, thievish, like Polya. Two pies on a plate\nhad a particularly miserable and guilty air. \"We shall be taken back to\nthe restaurant to-day,\" they seemed to be saying, \"and to-morrow we\nshall be put on the table again for some official or celebrated singer.\"\n\n\"She is a fine lady, indeed,\" I heard uttered in Polya's room. \"I could\nhave been a lady like that long ago, but I have some self-respect! We'll\nsee which of us will be the first to go!\"\n\nZinaida Fyodorovna rang the bell. She was sitting in her room, in the\ncorner, looking as though she had been put in the corner as a\npunishment.\n\n\"No telegram has come?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, madam.\"\n\n\"Ask the porter; perhaps there is a telegram. And don't leave the\nhouse,\" she called after me. \"I am afraid to be left alone.\"\n\nAfter that I had to run down almost every hour to ask the porter whether\na telegram had come. I must own it was a dreadful time! To avoid seeing\nPolya, Zinaida Fyodorovna dined and had tea in her own room; it was here\nthat she slept, too, on a short sofa like a half-moon, and she made her\nown bed. For the first days I took the telegrams; but, getting no\nanswer, she lost her faith in me and began telegraphing herself. Looking\nat her, I, too, began impatiently hoping for a telegram. I hoped he\nwould contrive some deception, would make arrangements, for instance,\nthat a telegram should be sent to her from some station. If he were too\nmuch engrossed with cards or had been attracted by some other woman, I\nthought that both Gruzin and Kukushkin would remind him of us. But our\nexpectations were vain. Five times a day I would go in to Zinaida\nFyodorovna, intending to tell her the truth, But her eyes looked piteous\nas a fawn's, her shoulders seemed to droop, her lips were moving, and I\nwent away again without saying a word. Pity and sympathy seemed to rob\nme of all manliness. Polya, as cheerful and well satisfied with herself\nas though nothing had happened, was tidying the master's study and the\nbedroom, rummaging in the cupboards, and making the crockery jingle, and\nwhen she passed Zinaida Fyodorovna's door, she hummed something and\ncoughed. She was pleased that her mistress was hiding from her. In the\nevening she would go out somewhere, and rang at two or three o'clock in\nthe morning, and I had to open the door to her and listen to remarks\nabout my cough. Immediately afterwards I would hear another ring; I\nwould run to the room next to the study, and Zinaida Fyodorovna, putting\nher head out of the door, would ask, \"Who was it rung?\" while she looked\nat my hands to see whether I had a telegram.\n\nWhen at last on Saturday the bell rang below and she heard the familiar\nvoice on the stairs, she was so delighted that she broke into sobs. She\nrushed to meet him, embraced him, kissed him on the breast and sleeves,\nsaid something one could not understand. The hall porter brought up the\nportmanteaus; Polya's cheerful voice was heard. It was as though some\none had come home for the holidays.\n\n\"Why didn't you wire?\" asked Zinaida Fyodorovna, breathless with joy.\n\"Why was it? I have been in misery; I don't know how I've lived through\nit.... Oh, my God!\"\n\n\"It was very simple! I returned with the senator to Moscow the very\nfirst day, and didn't get your telegrams,\" said Orlov. \"After dinner, my\nlove, I'll give you a full account of my doings, but now I must sleep\nand sleep.... I am worn out with the journey.\"\n\nIt was evident that he had not slept all night; he had probably been\nplaying cards and drinking freely. Zinaida Fyodorovna put him to bed,\nand we all walked about on tiptoe all that day. The dinner went off\nquite satisfactorily, but when they went into the study and had coffee\nthe explanation began. Zinaida Fyodorovna began talking of something\nrapidly in a low voice; she spoke in French, and her words flowed like a\nstream. Then I heard a loud sigh from Orlov, and his voice.\n\n\"My God!\" he said in French. \"Have you really nothing fresher to tell me\nthan this everlasting tale of your servant's misdeeds?\"\n\n\"But, my dear, she robbed me and said insulting things to me.\"\n\n\"But why is it she doesn't rob me or say insulting things to me? Why is\nit I never notice the maids nor the porters nor the footmen? My dear,\nyou are simply capricious and refuse to know your own mind.... I really\nbegin to suspect that you must be in a certain condition. When I offered\nto let her go, you insisted on her remaining, and now you want me to\nturn her away. I can be obstinate, too, in such cases. You want her to\ngo, but I want her to remain. That's the only way to cure you of your\nnerves.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well, very well,\" said Zinaida Fyodorovna in alarm. \"Let us\nsay no more about that.... Let us put it off till to-morrow.... Now tell\nme about Moscow.... What is going on in Moscow?\"\n\n\nX\n\nAfter lunch next day--it was the seventh of January, St. John the\nBaptist's Day--Orlov put on his black dress coat and his decoration to\ngo to visit his father and congratulate him on his name day. He had to\ngo at two o'clock, and it was only half-past one when he had finished\ndressing. What was he to do for that half-hour? He walked about the\ndrawing-room, declaiming some congratulatory verses which he had recited\nas a child to his father and mother.\n\nZinaida Fyodorovna, who was just going out to a dressmaker's or to the\nshops, was sitting, listening to him with a smile. I don't know how\ntheir conversation began, but when I took Orlov his gloves, he was\nstanding before her with a capricious, beseeching face, saying:\n\n\"For God's sake, in the name of everything that's holy, don't talk of\nthings that everybody knows! What an unfortunate gift our intellectual\nthoughtful ladies have for talking with enthusiasm and an air of\nprofundity of things that every schoolboy is sick to death of! Ah, if\nonly you would exclude from our conjugal programme all these serious\nquestions! How grateful I should be to you!\"\n\n\"We women may not dare, it seems, to have views of our own.\"\n\n\"I give you full liberty to be as liberal as you like, and quote from\nany authors you choose, but make me one concession: don't hold forth in\nmy presence on either of two subjects: the corruption of the upper\nclasses and the evils of the marriage system. Do understand me, at last.\nThe upper class is always abused in contrast with the world of\ntradesmen, priests, workmen and peasants, Sidors and Nikitas of all\nsorts. I detest both classes, but if I had honestly to choose between\nthe two, I should without hesitation, prefer the upper class, and there\nwould be no falsity or affectation about it, since all my tastes are in\nthat direction. Our world is trivial and empty, but at any rate we speak\nFrench decently, read something, and don't punch each other in the ribs\neven in our most violent quarrels, while the Sidors and the Nikitas and\ntheir worships in trade talk about 'being quite agreeable,' 'in a\njiffy,' 'blast your eyes,' and display the utmost license of pothouse\nmanners and the most degrading superstition.\"\n\n\"The peasant and the tradesman feed you.\"\n\n\"Yes, but what of it? That's not only to my discredit, but to theirs\ntoo. They feed me and take off their caps to me, so it seems they have\nnot the intelligence and honesty to do otherwise. I don't blame or\npraise any one: I only mean that the upper class and the lower are as\nbad as one another. My feelings and my intelligence are opposed to both,\nbut my tastes lie more in the direction of the former. Well, now for the\nevils of marriage,\" Orlov went on, glancing at his watch. \"It's high\ntime for you to understand that there are no evils in the system itself;\nwhat is the matter is that you don't know yourselves what you want from\nmarriage. What is it you want? In legal and illegal cohabitation, in\nevery sort of union and cohabitation, good or bad, the underlying\nreality is the same. You ladies live for that underlying reality alone:\nfor you it's everything; your existence would have no meaning for you\nwithout it. You want nothing but that, and you get it; but since you've\ntaken to reading novels you are ashamed of it: you rush from pillar to\npost, you recklessly change your men, and to justify this turmoil you\nhave begun talking of the evils of marriage. So long as you can't and\nwon't renounce what underlies it all, your chief foe, your devil--so\nlong as you serve that slavishly, what use is there in discussing the\nmatter seriously? Everything you may say to me will be falsity and\naffectation. I shall not believe you.\"\n\nI went to find out from the hall porter whether the sledge was at the\ndoor, and when I came back I found it had become a quarrel. As sailors\nsay, a squall had blown up.\n\n\"I see you want to shock me by your cynicism today,\" said Zinaida\nFyodorovna, walking about the drawing-room in great emotion. \"It revolts\nme to listen to you. I am pure before God and man, and have nothing to\nrepent of. I left my husband and came to you, and am proud of it. I\nswear, on my honour, I am proud of it!\"\n\n\"Well, that's all right, then!\"\n\n\"If you are a decent, honest man, you, too, ought to be proud of what I\ndid. It raises you and me above thousands of people who would like to do\nas we have done, but do not venture through cowardice or petty prudence.\nBut you are not a decent man. You are afraid of freedom, and you mock\nthe promptings of genuine feeling, from fear that some ignoramus may\nsuspect you of being sincere. You are afraid to show me to your friends;\nthere's no greater infliction for you than to go about with me in the\nstreet.... Isn't that true? Why haven't you introduced me to your father\nor your cousin all this time? Why is it? No, I am sick of it at last,\"\ncried Zinaida Fyodorovna, stamping. \"I demand what is mine by right. You\nmust present me to your father.\"\n\n\"If you want to know him, go and present yourself. He receives visitors\nevery morning from ten till half-past.\"\n\n\"How base you are!\" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, wringing her hands in\ndespair. \"Even if you are not sincere, and are not saying what you\nthink, I might hate you for your cruelty. Oh, how base you are!\"\n\n\"We keep going round and round and never reach the real point. The real\npoint is that you made a mistake, and you won't acknowledge it aloud.\nYou imagined that I was a hero, and that I had some extraordinary ideas\nand ideals, and it has turned out that I am a most ordinary official, a\ncardplayer, and have no partiality for ideas of any sort. I am a worthy\nrepresentative of the rotten world from which you have run away because\nyou were revolted with its triviality and emptiness. Recognise it and be\njust: don't be indignant with me, but with yourself, as it is your\nmistake, and not mine.\"\n\n\"Yes, I admit I was mistaken.\"\n\n\"Well, that's all right, then. We've reached that point at last, thank\nGod. Now hear something more, if you please: I can't rise to your\nlevel--I am too depraved; you can't descend to my level, either, for you\nare too exalted. So there is only one thing left to do....\"\n\n\"What?\" Zinaida Fyodorovna asked quickly, holding her breath and turning\nsuddenly as white as a sheet of paper.\n\n\"To call logic to our aid....\"\n\n\"Georgy, why are you torturing me?\" Zinaida Fyodorovna said suddenly in\nRussian in a breaking voice. \"What is it for? Think of my misery....\"\n\nOrlov, afraid of tears, went quickly into his study, and I don't know\nwhy--whether it was that he wished to cause her extra pain, or whether\nhe remembered it was usually done in such cases--he locked the door\nafter him. She cried out and ran after him with a rustle of her skirt.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" she cried, knocking at his door. \"What ... what\ndoes this mean?\" she repeated in a shrill voice breaking with\nindignation. \"Ah, so this is what you do! Then let me tell you I hate\nyou, I despise you! Everything is over between us now.\"\n\nI heard hysterical weeping mingled with laughter. Something small in the\ndrawing-room fell off the table and was broken. Orlov went out into the\nhall by another door, and, looking round him nervously, he hurriedly put\non his great-coat and went out.\n\nHalf an hour passed, an hour, and she was still weeping. I remembered\nthat she had no father or mother, no relations, and here she was living\nbetween a man who hated her and Polya, who robbed her--and how desolate\nher life seemed to me! I do not know why, but I went into the\ndrawing-room to her. Weak and helpless, looking with her lovely hair\nlike an embodiment of tenderness and grace, she was in anguish, as\nthough she were ill; she was lying on a couch, hiding her face, and\nquivering all over.\n\n\"Madam, shouldn't I fetch a doctor?\" I asked gently.\n\n\"No, there's no need ... it's nothing,\" she said, and she looked at me\nwith her tear-stained eyes. \"I have a little headache.... Thank you.\"\n\nI went out, and in the evening she was writing letter after letter, and\nsent me out first to Pekarsky, then to Gruzin, then to Kukushkin, and\nfinally anywhere I chose, if only I could find Orlov and give him the\nletter. Every time I came back with the letter she scolded me, entreated\nme, thrust money into my hand--as though she were in a fever. And all\nthe night she did not sleep, but sat in the drawing-room, talking to\nherself.\n\nOrlov returned to dinner next day, and they were reconciled.\n\nThe first Thursday afterwards Orlov complained to his friends of the\nintolerable life he led; he smoked a great deal, and said with\nirritation:\n\n\"It is no life at all; it's the rack. Tears, wailing, intellectual\nconversations, begging for forgiveness, again tears and wailing; and the\nlong and the short of it is that I have no flat of my own now. I am\nwretched, and I make her wretched. Surely I haven't to live another\nmonth or two like this? How can I? But yet I may have to.\"\n\n\"Why don't you speak, then?\" said Pekarsky.\n\n\"I've tried, but I can't. One can boldly tell the truth, whatever it may\nbe, to an independent, rational man; but in this case one has to do with\na creature who has no will, no strength of character, and no logic. I\ncannot endure tears; they disarm me. When she cries, I am ready to swear\neternal love and cry myself.\"\n\nPekarsky did not understand; he scratched his broad forehead in\nperplexity and said:\n\n\"You really had better take another flat for her. It's so simple!\"\n\n\"She wants me, not the flat. But what's the good of talking?\" sighed\nOrlov. \"I only hear endless conversations, but no way out of my\nposition. It certainly is a case of 'being guilty without guilt.' I\ndon't claim to be a mushroom, but it seems I've got to go into the\nbasket. The last thing I've ever set out to be is a hero. I never could\nendure Turgenev's novels; and now, all of a sudden, as though to spite\nme, I've heroism forced upon me. I assure her on my honour that I'm not\na hero at all, I adduce irrefutable proofs of the same, but she doesn't\nbelieve me. Why doesn't she believe me? I suppose I really must have\nsomething of the appearance of a hero.\"\n\n\"You go off on a tour of inspection in the provinces,\" said Kukushkin,\nlaughing.\n\n\"Yes, that's the only thing left for me.\"\n\nA week after this conversation Orlov announced that he was again ordered\nto attend the senator, and the same evening he went off with his\nportmanteaus to Pekarsky.\n\n\nXI\n\nAn old man of sixty, in a long fur coat reaching to the ground, and a\nbeaver cap, was standing at the door.\n\n\"Is Georgy Ivanitch at home?\" he asked.\n\nAt first I thought it was one of the moneylenders, Gruzin's creditors,\nwho sometimes used to come to Orlov for small payments on account; but\nwhen he came into the hall and flung open his coat, I saw the thick\nbrows and the characteristically compressed lips which I knew so well\nfrom the photographs, and two rows of stars on the uniform. I recognised\nhim: it was Orlov's father, the distinguished statesman.\n\nI answered that Georgy Ivanitch was not at home. The old man pursed up\nhis lips tightly and looked into space, reflecting, showing me his\ndried-up, toothless profile.\n\n\"I'll leave a note,\" he said; \"show me in.\"\n\nHe left his goloshes in the hall, and, without taking off his long,\nheavy fur coat, went into the study. There he sat down before the table,\nand, before taking up the pen, for three minutes he pondered, shading\nhis eyes with his hand as though from the sun--exactly as his son did\nwhen he was out of humour. His face was sad, thoughtful, with that look\nof resignation which I have only seen on the faces of the old and\nreligious. I stood behind him, gazed at his bald head and at the hollow\nat the nape of his neck, and it was clear as daylight to me that this\nweak old man was now in my power. There was not a soul in the flat\nexcept my enemy and me. I had only to use a little physical violence,\nthen snatch his watch to disguise the object of the crime, and to get\noff by the back way, and I should have gained infinitely more than I\ncould have imagined possible when I took up the part of a footman. I\nthought that I could hardly get a better opportunity. But instead of\nacting, I looked quite unconcernedly, first at his bald patch and then\nat his fur, and calmly meditated on this man's relation to his only son,\nand on the fact that people spoiled by power and wealth probably don't\nwant to die....\n\n\"Have you been long in my son's service?\" he asked, writing a large hand\non the paper.\n\n\"Three months, your High Excellency.\"\n\nHe finished the letter and stood up. I still had time. I urged myself on\nand clenched my fists, trying to wring out of my soul some trace of my\nformer hatred; I recalled what a passionate, implacable, obstinate hate\nI had felt for him only a little while before.... But it is difficult to\nstrike a match against a crumbling stone. The sad old face and the cold\nglitter of his stars roused in me nothing but petty, cheap, unnecessary\nthoughts of the transitoriness of everything earthly, of the nearness of\ndeath....\n\n\"Good-day, brother,\" said the old man. He put on his cap and went out.\n\nThere could be no doubt about it: I had undergone a change; I had become\ndifferent. To convince myself, I began to recall the past, but at once I\nfelt uneasy, as though I had accidentally peeped into a dark, damp\ncorner. I remembered my comrades and friends, and my first thought was\nhow I should blush in confusion if ever I met any of them. What was I\nnow? What had I to think of and to do? Where was I to go? What was I\nliving for?\n\nI could make nothing of it. I only knew one thing--that I must make\nhaste to pack my things and be off. Before the old man's visit my\nposition as a flunkey had a meaning; now it was absurd. Tears dropped\ninto my open portmanteau; I felt insufferably sad; but how I longed to\nlive! I was ready to embrace and include in my short life every\npossibility open to man. I wanted to speak, to read, and to hammer in\nsome big factory, and to stand on watch, and to plough. I yearned for\nthe Nevsky Prospect, for the sea and the fields--for every place to\nwhich my imagination travelled. When Zinaida Fyodorovna came in, I\nrushed to open the door for her, and with peculiar tenderness took off\nher fur coat. The last time!\n\nWe had two other visitors that day besides the old man. In the evening\nwhen it was quite dark, Gruzin came to fetch some papers for Orlov. He\nopened the table-drawer, took the necessary papers, and, rolling them\nup, told me to put them in the hall beside his cap while he went in to\nsee Zinaida Fyodorovna. She was lying on the sofa in the drawing-room,\nwith her arms behind her head. Five or six days had already passed since\nOrlov went on his tour of inspection, and no one knew when he would be\nback, but this time she did not send telegrams and did not expect them.\nShe did not seem to notice the presence of Polya, who was still living\nwith us. \"So be it, then,\" was what I read on her passionless and very\npale face. Like Orlov, she wanted to be unhappy out of obstinacy. To\nspite herself and everything in the world, she lay for days together on\nthe sofa, desiring and expecting nothing but evil for herself. Probably\nshe was picturing to herself Orlov's return and the inevitable quarrels\nwith him; then his growing indifference to her, his infidelities; then\nhow they would separate; and perhaps these agonising thoughts gave her\nsatisfaction. But what would she have said if she found out the actual\ntruth?\n\n\"I love you, Godmother,\" said Gruzin, greeting her and kissing her hand.\n\"You are so kind! And so dear _George_ has gone away,\" he lied. \"He has\ngone away, the rascal!\"\n\nHe sat down with a sigh and tenderly stroked her hand.\n\n\"Let me spend an hour with you, my dear,\" he said. \"I don't want to go\nhome, and it's too early to go to the Birshovs'. The Birshovs are\nkeeping their Katya's birthday to-day. She is a nice child!\"\n\nI brought him a glass of tea and a decanter of brandy. He slowly and\nwith obvious reluctance drank the tea, and returning the glass to me,\nasked timidly:\n\n\"Can you give me ... something to eat, my friend? I have had no dinner.\"\n\nWe had nothing in the flat. I went to the restaurant and brought him the\nordinary rouble dinner.\n\n\"To your health, my dear,\" he said to Zinaida Fyodorovna, and he tossed\noff a glass of vodka. \"My little girl, your godchild, sends you her\nlove. Poor child! she's rickety. Ah, children, children!\" he sighed.\n\"Whatever you may say, Godmother, it is nice to be a father. Dear\n_George_ can't understand that feeling.\"\n\nHe drank some more. Pale and lean, with his dinner-napkin over his chest\nlike a little pinafore, he ate greedily, and raising his eyebrows, kept\nlooking guiltily, like a little boy, first at Zinaida Fyodorovna and\nthen at me. It seemed as though he would have begun crying if I had not\ngiven him the grouse or the jelly. When he had satisfied his hunger he\ngrew more lively, and began laughingly telling some story about the\nBirshov household, but perceiving that it was tiresome and that Zinaida\nFyodorovna was not laughing, he ceased. And there was a sudden feeling\nof dreariness. After he had finished his dinner they sat in the\ndrawing-room by the light of a single lamp, and did not speak; it was\npainful to him to lie to her, and she wanted to ask him something, but\ncould not make up her mind to. So passed half an hour. Gruzin glanced at\nhis watch.\n\n\"I suppose it's time for me to go.\"\n\n\"No, stay a little.... We must have a talk.\"\n\nAgain they were silent. He sat down to the piano, struck one chord, then\nbegan playing, and sang softly, \"What does the coming day bring me?\" but\nas usual he got up suddenly and tossed his head.\n\n\"Play something,\" Zinaida Fyodorovna asked him.\n\n\"What shall I play?\" he asked, shrugging his shoulders. \"I have\nforgotten everything. I've given it up long ago.\"\n\nLooking at the ceiling as though trying to remember, he played two\npieces of Tchaikovsky with exquisite expression, with such warmth, such\ninsight! His face was just as usual--neither stupid nor intelligent--and\nit seemed to me a perfect marvel that a man whom I was accustomed to see\nin the midst of the most degrading, impure surroundings, was capable of\nsuch purity, of rising to a feeling so lofty, so far beyond my reach.\nZinaida Fyodorovna's face glowed, and she walked about the drawing-room\nin emotion.\n\n\"Wait a bit, Godmother; if I can remember it, I will play you\nsomething,\" he said; \"I heard it played on the violoncello.\"\n\nBeginning timidly and picking out the notes, and then gathering\nconfidence, he played Saint-Saens's \"Swan Song.\" He played it through,\nand then played it a second time.\n\n\"It's nice, isn't it?\" he said.\n\nMoved by the music, Zinaida Fyodorovna stood beside him and asked:\n\n\"Tell me honestly, as a friend, what do you think about me?\"\n\n\"What am I to say?\" he said, raising his eyebrows. \"I love you and think\nnothing but good of you. But if you wish that I should speak generally\nabout the question that interests you,\" he went on, rubbing his sleeve\nnear the elbow and frowning, \"then, my dear, you know.... To follow\nfreely the promptings of the heart does not always give good people\nhappiness. To feel free and at the same time to be happy, it seems to\nme, one must not conceal from oneself that life is coarse, cruel, and\nmerciless in its conservatism, and one must retaliate with what it\ndeserves--that is, be as coarse and as merciless in one's striving for\nfreedom. That's what I think.\"\n\n\"That's beyond me,\" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, with a mournful smile. \"I\nam exhausted already. I am so exhausted that I wouldn't stir a finger\nfor my own salvation.\"\n\n\"Go into a nunnery.\"\n\nHe said this in jest, but after he had said it, tears glistened in\nZinaida Fyodorovna's eyes and then in his.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"we've been sitting and sitting, and now we must go.\nGood-bye, dear Godmother. God give you health.\"\n\nHe kissed both her hands, and stroking them tenderly, said that he\nshould certainly come to see her again in a day or two. In the hall, as\nhe was putting on his overcoat, that was so like a child's pelisse, he\nfumbled long in his pockets to find a tip for me, but found nothing\nthere.\n\n\"Good-bye, my dear fellow,\" he said sadly, and went away.\n\nI shall never forget the feeling that this man left behind him.\n\nZinaida Fyodorovna still walked about the room in her excitement. That\nshe was walking about and not still lying down was so much to the good.\nI wanted to take advantage of this mood to speak to her openly and then\nto go away, but I had hardly seen Gruzin out when I heard a ring. It was\nKukushkin.\n\n\"Is Georgy Ivanitch at home?\" he said. \"Has he come back? You say no?\nWhat a pity! In that case, I'll go in and kiss your mistress's hand, and\nso away. Zinaida Fyodorovna, may I come in?\" he cried. \"I want to kiss\nyour hand. Excuse my being so late.\"\n\nHe was not long in the drawing-room, not more than ten minutes, but I\nfelt as though he were staying a long while and would never go away. I\nbit my lips from indignation and annoyance, and already hated Zinaida\nFyodorovna. \"Why does she not turn him out?\" I thought indignantly,\nthough it was evident that she was bored by his company.\n\nWhen I held his fur coat for him he asked me, as a mark of special\ngood-will, how I managed to get on without a wife.\n\n\"But I don't suppose you waste your time,\" he said, laughingly. \"I've no\ndoubt Polya and you are as thick as thieves.... You rascal!\"\n\nIn spite of my experience of life, I knew very little of mankind at that\ntime, and it is very likely that I often exaggerated what was of little\nconsequence and failed to observe what was important. It seemed to me it\nwas not without motive that Kukushkin tittered and flattered me. Could\nit be that he was hoping that I, like a flunkey, would gossip in other\nkitchens and servants' quarters of his coming to see us in the evenings\nwhen Orlov was away, and staying with Zinaida Fyodorovna till late at\nnight? And when my tittle-tattle came to the ears of his acquaintance,\nhe would drop his eyes in confusion and shake his little finger. And\nwould not he, I thought, looking at his little honeyed face, this very\nevening at cards pretend and perhaps declare that he had already won\nZinaida Fyodorovna from Orlov?\n\nThat hatred which failed me at midday when the old father had come, took\npossession of me now. Kukushkin went away at last, and as I listened to\nthe shuffle of his leather goloshes, I felt greatly tempted to fling\nafter him, as a parting shot, some coarse word of abuse, but I\nrestrained myself. And when the steps had died away on the stairs, I\nwent back to the hall, and, hardly conscious of what I was doing, took\nup the roll of papers that Gruzin had left behind, and ran headlong\ndownstairs. Without cap or overcoat, I ran down into the street. It was\nnot cold, but big flakes of snow were falling and it was windy.\n\n\"Your Excellency!\" I cried, catching up Kukushkin. \"Your Excellency!\"\n\nHe stopped under a lamp-post and looked round with surprise. \"Your\nExcellency!\" I said breathless, \"your Excellency!\"\n\nAnd not able to think of anything to say, I hit him two or three times\non the face with the roll of paper. Completely at a loss, and hardly\nwondering--I had so completely taken him by surprise--he leaned his back\nagainst the lamp-post and put up his hands to protect his face. At that\nmoment an army doctor passed, and saw how I was beating the man, but he\nmerely looked at us in astonishment and went on. I felt ashamed and I\nran back to the house.\n\n\nXII\n\nWith my head wet from the snow, and gasping for breath, I ran to my\nroom, and immediately flung off my swallow-tails, put on a reefer jacket\nand an overcoat, and carried my portmanteau out into the passage; I must\nget away! But before going I hurriedly sat down and began writing to\nOrlov:\n\n\"I leave you my false passport,\" I began. \"I beg you to keep it as a\nmemento, you false man, you Petersburg official!\n\n\"To steal into another man's house under a false name, to watch under\nthe mask of a flunkey this person's intimate life, to hear everything,\nto see everything in order later on, unasked, to accuse a man of\nlying--all this, you will say, is on a level with theft. Yes, but I care\nnothing for fine feelings now. I have endured dozens of your dinners and\nsuppers when you said and did what you liked, and I had to hear, to look\non, and be silent. I don't want to make you a present of my silence.\nBesides, if there is not a living soul at hand who dares to tell you the\ntruth without flattery, let your flunkey Stepan wash your magnificent\ncountenance for you.\"\n\nI did not like this beginning, but I did not care to alter it. Besides,\nwhat did it matter?\n\nThe big windows with their dark curtains, the bed, the crumpled dress\ncoat on the floor, and my wet footprints, looked gloomy and forbidding.\nAnd there was a peculiar stillness.\n\nPossibly because I had run out into the street without my cap and\ngoloshes I was in a high fever. My face burned, my legs ached.... My\nheavy head drooped over the table, and there was that kind of division\nin my thought when every idea in the brain seemed dogged by its shadow.\n\n\"I am ill, weak, morally cast down,\" I went on; \"I cannot write to you\nas I should like to. From the first moment I desired to insult and\nhumiliate you, but now I do not feel that I have the right to do so. You\nand I have both fallen, and neither of us will ever rise up again; and\neven if my letter were eloquent, terrible, and passionate, it would\nstill seem like beating on the lid of a coffin: however one knocks upon\nit, one will not wake up the dead! No efforts could warm your accursed\ncold blood, and you know that better than I do. Why write? But my mind\nand heart are burning, and I go on writing; for some reason I am moved\nas though this letter still might save you and me. I am so feverish that\nmy thoughts are disconnected, and my pen scratches the paper without\nmeaning; but the question I want to put to you stands before me as clear\nas though in letters of flame.\n\n\"Why I am prematurely weak and fallen is not hard to explain. Like\nSamson of old, I have taken the gates of Gaza on my shoulders to carry\nthem to the top of the mountain, and only when I was exhausted, when\nyouth and health were quenched in me forever, I noticed that that burden\nwas not for my shoulders, and that I had deceived myself. I have been,\nmoreover, in cruel and continual pain. I have endured cold, hunger,\nillness, and loss of liberty. Of personal happiness I know and have\nknown nothing. I have no home; my memories are bitter, and my conscience\nis often in dread of them. But why have you fallen--you? What fatal,\ndiabolical causes hindered your life from blossoming into full flower?\nWhy, almost before beginning life, were you in such haste to cast off\nthe image and likeness of God, and to become a cowardly beast who backs\nand scares others because he is afraid himself? You are afraid of\nlife--as afraid of it as an Oriental who sits all day on a cushion\nsmoking his hookah. Yes, you read a great deal, and a European coat fits\nyou well, but yet with what tender, purely Oriental, pasha-like care you\nprotect yourself from hunger, cold, physical effort, from pain and\nuneasiness! How early your soul has taken to its dressing-gown! What a\ncowardly part you have played towards real life and nature, with which\nevery healthy and normal man struggles! How soft, how snug, how warm,\nhow comfortable--and how bored you are! Yes, it is deathly boredom,\nunrelieved by one ray of light, as in solitary confinement; but you try\nto hide from that enemy, too, you play cards eight hours out of\ntwenty-four.\n\n\"And your irony? Oh, but how well I understand it! Free, bold, living\nthought is searching and dominating; for an indolent, sluggish mind it\nis intolerable. That it may not disturb your peace, like thousands of\nyour contemporaries, you made haste in youth to put it under bar and\nbolt. Your ironical attitude to life, or whatever you like to call it,\nis your armour; and your thought, fettered and frightened, dare not leap\nover the fence you have put round it; and when you jeer at ideas which\nyou pretend to know all about, you are like the deserter fleeing from\nthe field of battle, and, to stifle his shame, sneering at war and at\nvalour. Cynicism stifles pain. In some novel of Dostoevsky's an old man\ntramples underfoot the portrait of his dearly loved daughter because he\nhad been unjust to her, and you vent your foul and vulgar jeers upon the\nideas of goodness and truth because you have not the strength to follow\nthem. You are frightened of every honest and truthful hint at your\ndegradation, and you purposely surround yourself with people who do\nnothing but flatter your weaknesses. And you may well, you may well\ndread the sight of tears!\n\n\"By the way, your attitude to women. Shamelessness has been handed down\nto us in our flesh and blood, and we are trained to shamelessness; but\nthat is what we are men for--to subdue the beast in us. When you reached\nmanhood and _all_ ideas became known to you, you could not have failed\nto see the truth; you knew it, but you did not follow it; you were\nafraid of it, and to deceive your conscience you began loudly assuring\nyourself that it was not you but woman that was to blame, that she was\nas degraded as your attitude to her. Your cold, scabrous anecdotes, your\ncoarse laughter, all your innumerable theories concerning the underlying\nreality of marriage and the definite demands made upon it, concerning\nthe ten _sous_ the French workman pays his woman; your everlasting\nattacks on female logic, lying, weakness and so on--doesn't it all look\nlike a desire at all costs to force woman down into the mud that she may\nbe on the same level as your attitude to her? You are a weak, unhappy,\nunpleasant person!\"\n\nZinaida Fyodorovna began playing the piano in the drawing-room, trying\nto recall the song of Saint Saens that Gruzin had played. I went and lay\non my bed, but remembering that it was time for me to go, I got up with\nan effort and with a heavy, burning head went to the table again.\n\n\"But this is the question,\" I went on. \"Why are we worn out? Why are we,\nat first so passionate so bold, so noble, and so full of faith, complete\nbankrupts at thirty or thirty-five? Why does one waste in consumption,\nanother put a bullet through his brains, a third seeks forgetfulness in\nvodka and cards, while the fourth tries to stifle his fear and misery by\ncynically trampling underfoot the pure image of his fair youth? Why is\nit that, having once fallen, we do not try to rise up again, and, losing\none thing, do not seek something else? Why is it?\n\n\"The thief hanging on the Cross could bring back the joy of life and the\ncourage of confident hope, though perhaps he had not more than an hour\nto live. You have long years before you, and I shall probably not die so\nsoon as one might suppose. What if by a miracle the present turned out\nto be a dream, a horrible nightmare, and we should wake up renewed,\npure, strong, proud of our righteousness? Sweet visions fire me, and I\nam almost breathless with emotion. I have a terrible longing to live. I\nlong for our life to be holy, lofty, and majestic as the heavens above.\nLet us live! The sun doesn't rise twice a day, and life is not given us\nagain--clutch at what is left of your life and save it....\"\n\nI did not write another word. I had a multitude of thoughts in my mind,\nbut I could not connect them and get them on to paper. Without finishing\nthe letter, I signed it with my name and rank, and went into the study.\nIt was dark. I felt for the table and put the letter on it. I must have\nstumbled against the furniture in the dark and made a noise.\n\n\"Who is there?\" I heard an alarmed voice in the drawing-room.\n\nAnd the clock on the table softly struck one at the moment.\n\n\nXIII\n\nFor at least half a minute I fumbled at the door in the dark, feeling\nfor the handle; then I slowly opened it and walked into the\ndrawing-room. Zinaida Fyodorovna was lying on the couch, and raising\nherself on her elbow, she looked towards me. Unable to bring myself to\nspeak, I walked slowly by, and she followed me with her eyes. I stood\nfor a little time in the dining-room and then walked by her again, and\nshe looked at me intently and with perplexity, even with alarm. At last\nI stood still and said with an effort:\n\n\"He is not coming back.\"\n\nShe quickly got on to her feet, and looked at me without understanding.\n\n\"He is not coming back,\" I repeated, and my heart beat violently. \"He\nwill not come back, for he has not left Petersburg. He is staying at\nPekarsky's.\"\n\nShe understood and believed me--I saw that from her sudden pallor, and\nfrom the way she laid her arms upon her bosom in terror and entreaty. In\none instant all that had happened of late flashed through her mind; she\nreflected, and with pitiless clarity she saw the whole truth. But at the\nsame time she remembered that I was a flunkey, a being of a lower\norder.... A casual stranger, with hair ruffled, with face flushed with\nfever, perhaps drunk, in a common overcoat, was coarsely intruding into\nher intimate life, and that offended her. She said to me sternly:\n\n\"It's not your business: go away.\"\n\n\"Oh, believe me!\" I cried impetuously, holding out my hands to her. \"I\nam not a footman; I am as free as you.\"\n\nI mentioned my name, and, speaking very rapidly that she might not\ninterrupt me or go away, explained to her who I was and why I was living\nthere. This new discovery struck her more than the first. Till then she\nhad hoped that her footman had lied or made a mistake or been silly, but\nnow after my confession she had no doubts left. From the expression of\nher unhappy eyes and face, which suddenly lost its softness and beauty\nand looked old, I saw that she was insufferably miserable, and that the\nconversation would lead to no good; but I went on impetuously:\n\n\"The senator and the tour of inspection were invented to deceive you. In\nJanuary, just as now, he did not go away, but stayed at Pekarsky's, and\nI saw him every day and took part in the deception. He was weary of you,\nhe hated your presence here, he mocked at you.... If you could have\nheard how he and his friends here jeered at you and your love, you would\nnot have remained here one minute! Go away from here! Go away.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said in a shaking voice, and moved her hand over her hair.\n\"Well, so be it.\"\n\nHer eyes were full of tears, her lips were quivering, and her whole face\nwas strikingly pale and distorted with anger. Orlov's coarse, petty\nlying revolted her and seemed to her contemptible, ridiculous: she\nsmiled and I did not like that smile.\n\n\"Well,\" she repeated, passing her hand over her hair again, \"so be it.\nHe imagines that I shall die of humiliation, and instead of that I am\n... amused by it. There's no need for him to hide.\" She walked away from\nthe piano and said, shrugging her shoulders: \"There's no need.... It\nwould have been simpler to have it out with me instead of keeping in\nhiding in other people's flats. I have eyes; I saw it myself long\nago.... I was only waiting for him to come back to have things out once\nfor all.\"\n\nThen she sat down on a low chair by the table, and, leaning her head on\nthe arm of the sofa, wept bitterly. In the drawing-room there was only\none candle burning in the candelabra, and the chair where she was\nsitting was in darkness; but I saw how her head and shoulders were\nquivering, and how her hair, escaping from her combs, covered her neck,\nher face, her arms.... Her quiet, steady weeping, which was not\nhysterical but a woman's ordinary weeping, expressed a sense of insult,\nof wounded pride, of injury, and of something helpless, hopeless, which\none could not set right and to which one could not get used. Her tears\nstirred an echo in my troubled and suffering heart; I forgot my illness\nand everything else in the world; I walked about the drawing-room and\nmuttered distractedly:\n\n\"Is this life?... Oh, one can't go on living like this, one can't....\nOh, it's madness, wickedness, not life.\"\n\n\"What humiliation!\" she said through her tears. \"To live together, to\nsmile at me at the very time when I was burdensome to him, ridiculous in\nhis eyes! Oh, how humiliating!\"\n\nShe lifted up her head, and looking at me with tear-stained eyes through\nher hair, wet with her tears, and pushing it back as it prevented her\nseeing me, she asked:\n\n\"They laughed at me?\"\n\n\"To these men you were laughable--you and your love and Turgenev; they\nsaid your head was full of him. And if we both die at once in despair,\nthat will amuse them, too; they will make a funny anecdote of it and\ntell it at your requiem service. But why talk of them?\" I said\nimpatiently. \"We must get away from here--I cannot stay here one minute\nlonger.\"\n\nShe began crying again, while I walked to the piano and sat down.\n\n\"What are we waiting for?\" I asked dejectedly. \"It's two o'clock.\"\n\n\"I am not waiting for anything,\" she said. \"I am utterly lost.\"\n\n\"Why do you talk like that? We had better consider together what we are\nto do. Neither you nor I can stay here. Where do you intend to go?\"\n\nSuddenly there was a ring at the bell. My heart stood still. Could it be\nOrlov, to whom perhaps Kukushkin had complained of me? How should we\nmeet? I went to open the door. It was Polya. She came in shaking the\nsnow off her pelisse, and went into her room without saying a word to\nme. When I went back to the drawing-room, Zinaida Fyodorovna, pale as\ndeath, was standing in the middle of the room, looking towards me with\nbig eyes.\n\n\"Who was it?\" she asked softly.\n\n\"Polya,\" I answered.\n\nShe passed her hand over her hair and closed her eyes wearily.\n\n\"I will go away at once,\" she said. \"Will you be kind and take me to the\nPetersburg Side? What time is it now?\"\n\n\"A quarter to three.\"\n\n\nXIV\n\nWhen, a little afterwards, we went out of the house, it was dark and\ndeserted in the street. Wet snow was falling and a damp wind lashed in\none's face. I remember it was the beginning of March; a thaw had set in,\nand for some days past the cabmen had been driving on wheels. Under the\nimpression of the back stairs, of the cold, of the midnight darkness,\nand the porter in his sheepskin who had questioned us before letting us\nout of the gate, Zinaida Fyodorovna was utterly cast down and\ndispirited. When we got into the cab and the hood was put up, trembling\nall over, she began hurriedly saying how grateful she was to me.\n\n\"I do not doubt your good-will, but I am ashamed that you should be\ntroubled,\" she muttered. \"Oh, I understand, I understand.... When Gruzin\nwas here to-day, I felt that he was lying and concealing something.\nWell, so be it. But I am ashamed, anyway, that you should be troubled.\"\n\nShe still had her doubts. To dispel them finally, I asked the cabman to\ndrive through Sergievsky Street; stopping him at Pekarsky's door, I got\nout of the cab and rang. When the porter came to the door, I asked\naloud, that Zinaida Fyodorovna might hear, whether Georgy Ivanitch was\nat home.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the answer, \"he came in half an hour ago. He must be in bed\nby now. What do you want?\"\n\nZinaida Fyodorovna could not refrain from putting her head out.\n\n\"Has Georgy Ivanitch been staying here long?\" she asked.\n\n\"Going on for three weeks.\"\n\n\"And he's not been away?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered the porter, looking at me with surprise.\n\n\"Tell him, early to-morrow,\" I said, \"that his sister has arrived from\nWarsaw. Good-bye.\"\n\nThen we drove on. The cab had no apron, the snow fell on us in big\nflakes, and the wind, especially on the Neva, pierced us through and\nthrough. I began to feel as though we had been driving for a long time,\nthat for ages we had been suffering, and that for ages I had been\nlistening to Zinaida Fyodorovna's shuddering breath. In semi-delirium,\nas though half asleep, I looked back upon my strange, incoherent life,\nand for some reason recalled a melodrama, \"The Parisian Beggars,\" which\nI had seen once or twice in my childhood. And when to shake off that\nsemi-delirium I peeped out from the hood and saw the dawn, all the\nimages of the past, all my misty thoughts, for some reason, blended in\nme into one distinct, overpowering thought: everything was irrevocably\nover for Zinaida Fyodorovna and for me. This was as certain a conviction\nas though the cold blue sky contained a prophecy, but a minute later I\nwas already thinking of something else and believed differently.\n\n\"What am I now?\" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, in a voice husky with the cold\nand the damp. \"Where am I to go? What am I to do? Gruzin told me to go\ninto a nunnery. Oh, I would! I would change my dress, my face, my name,\nmy thoughts ... everything--everything, and would hide myself for ever.\nBut they will not take me into a nunnery. I am with child.\"\n\n\"We will go abroad together to-morrow,\" I said.\n\n\"That's impossible. My husband won't give me a passport.\"\n\n\"I will take you without a passport.\"\n\nThe cabman stopped at a wooden house of two storeys, painted a dark\ncolour. I rang. Taking from me her small light basket--the only luggage\nwe had brought with us--Zinaida Fyodorovna gave a wry smile and said:\n\n\"These are my _bijoux_.\"\n\nBut she was so weak that she could not carry these _bijoux_.\n\nIt was a long while before the door was opened. After the third or\nfourth ring a light gleamed in the windows, and there was a sound of\nsteps, coughing and whispering; at last the key grated in the lock, and\na stout peasant woman with a frightened red face appeared at the door.\nSome distance behind her stood a thin little old woman with short grey\nhair, carrying a candle in her hand. Zinaida Fyodorovna ran into the\npassage and flung her arms round the old woman's neck.\n\n\"Nina, I've been deceived,\" she sobbed loudly. \"I've been coarsely,\nfoully deceived! Nina, Nina!\"\n\nI handed the basket to the peasant woman. The door was closed, but still\nI heard her sobs and the cry \"Nina!\"\n\nI got into the cab and told the man to drive slowly to the Nevsky\nProspect. I had to think of a night's lodging for myself.\n\nNext day towards evening I went to see Zinaida Fyodorovna. She was\nterribly changed. There were no traces of tears on her pale, terribly\nsunken face, and her expression was different. I don't know whether it\nwas that I saw her now in different surroundings, far from luxurious,\nand that our relations were by now different, or perhaps that intense\ngrief had already set its mark upon her; she did not strike me as so\nelegant and well dressed as before. Her figure seemed smaller; there was\nan abruptness and excessive nervousness about her as though she were in\na hurry, and there was not the same softness even in her smile. I was\ndressed in an expensive suit which I had bought during the day. She\nlooked first of all at that suit and at the hat in my hand, then turned\nan impatient, searching glance upon my face as though studying it.\n\n\"Your transformation still seems to me a sort of miracle,\" she said.\n\"Forgive me for looking at you with such curiosity. You are an\nextraordinary man, you know.\"\n\nI told her again who I was, and why I was living at Orlov's, and I told\nher at greater length and in more detail than the day before. She\nlistened with great attention, and said without letting me finish:\n\n\"Everything there is over for me. You know, I could not refrain from\nwriting a letter. Here is the answer.\"\n\nOn the sheet which she gave there was written in Orlov's hand:\n\n\"I am not going to justify myself. But you must own that it was your\nmistake, not mine. I wish you happiness, and beg you to make haste and\nforget.\n\n\"Yours sincerely,\n\n\"G. O.\n\n\"P. S.--I am sending on your things.\"\n\nThe trunks and baskets despatched by Orlov were standing in the passage,\nand my poor little portmanteau was there beside them.\n\n\"So ...\" Zinaida Fyodorovna began, but she did not finish.\n\nWe were silent. She took the note and held it for a couple of minutes\nbefore her eyes, and during that time her face wore the same haughty,\ncontemptuous, proud, and harsh expression as the day before at the\nbeginning of our explanation; tears came into her eyes--not timid,\nbitter tears, but proud, angry tears.\n\n\"Listen,\" she said, getting up abruptly and moving away to the window\nthat I might not see her face. \"I have made up my mind to go abroad with\nyou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I am very glad. I am ready to go to-day.\"\n\n\"Accept me as a recruit. Have you read Balzac?\" she asked suddenly,\nturning round. \"Have you? At the end of his novel 'Pere Goriot' the hero\nlooks down upon Paris from the top of a hill and threatens the town:\n'Now we shall settle our account,' and after this he begins a new life.\nSo when I look out of the train window at Petersburg for the last time,\nI shall say, 'Now we shall settle our account!'\"\n\nSaying this, she smiled at her jest, and for some reason shuddered all\nover.\n\n\nXV\n\nAt Venice I had an attack of pleurisy. Probably I had caught cold in the\nevening when we were rowing from the station to the Hotel Bauer. I had\nto take to my bed and stay there for a fortnight. Every morning while I\nwas ill Zinaida Fyodorovna came from her room to drink coffee with me,\nand afterwards read aloud to me French and Russian books, of which we\nhad bought a number at Vienna. These books were either long, long\nfamiliar to me or else had no interest for me, but I had the sound of a\nsweet, kind voice beside me, so that the meaning of all of them was\nsummed up for me in the one thing--I was not alone. She would go out for\na walk, come back in her light grey dress, her light straw hat, gay,\nwarmed by the spring sun; and sitting by my bed, bending low down over\nme, would tell me something about Venice or read me those books--and I\nwas happy.\n\nAt night I was cold, ill, and dreary, but by day I revelled in life--I\ncan find no better expression for it. The brilliant warm sunshine\nbeating in at the open windows and at the door upon the balcony, the\nshouts below, the splash of oars, the tinkle of bells, the prolonged\nboom of the cannon at midday, and the feeling of perfect, perfect\nfreedom, did wonders with me; I felt as though I were growing strong,\nbroad wings which were bearing me God knows whither. And what charm,\nwhat joy at times at the thought that another life was so close to mine!\nthat I was the servant, the guardian, the friend, the indispensable\nfellow-traveller of a creature, young, beautiful, wealthy, but weak,\nlonely, and insulted! It is pleasant even to be ill when you know that\nthere are people who are looking forward to your convalescence as to a\nholiday. One day I heard her whispering behind the door with my doctor,\nand then she came in to me with tear-stained eyes. It was a bad sign,\nbut I was touched, and there was a wonderful lightness in my heart.\n\nBut at last they allowed me to go out on the balcony. The sunshine and\nthe breeze from the sea caressed and fondled my sick body. I looked down\nat the familiar gondolas, which glide with feminine grace smoothly and\nmajestically as though they were alive, and felt all the luxury of this\noriginal, fascinating civilisation. There was a smell of the sea. Some\none was playing a stringed instrument and two voices were singing. How\ndelightful it was! How unlike it was to that Petersburg night when the\nwet snow was falling and beating so rudely on our faces. If one looks\nstraight across the canal, one sees the sea, and on the wide expanse\ntowards the horizon the sun glittered on the water so dazzlingly that it\nhurt one's eyes to look at it. My soul yearned towards that lovely sea,\nwhich was so akin to me and to which I had given up my youth. I longed\nto live--to live--and nothing more.\n\nA fortnight later I began walking freely. I loved to sit in the sun, and\nto listen to the gondoliers without understanding them, and for hours\ntogether to gaze at the little house where, they said, Desdemona\nlived--a naive, mournful little house with a demure expression, as light\nas lace, so light that it looked as though one could lift it from its\nplace with one hand. I stood for a long time by the tomb of Canova, and\ncould not take my eyes off the melancholy lion. And in the Palace of the\nDoges I was always drawn to the corner where the portrait of the unhappy\nMarino Faliero was painted over with black. \"It is fine to be an artist,\na poet, a dramatist,\" I thought, \"but since that is not vouchsafed to\nme, if only I could go in for mysticism! If only I had a grain of some\nfaith to add to the unruffled peace and serenity that fills the soul!\"\n\nIn the evening we ate oysters, drank wine, and went out in a gondola. I\nremember our black gondola swayed softly in the same place while the\nwater faintly gurgled under it. Here and there the reflection of the\nstars and the lights on the bank quivered and trembled. Not far from us\nin a gondola, hung with coloured lanterns which were reflected in the\nwater, there were people singing. The sounds of guitars, of violins, of\nmandolins, of men's and women's voices, were audible in the dark.\nZinaida Fyodorovna, pale, with a grave, almost stern face, was sitting\nbeside me, compressing her lips and clenching her hands. She was\nthinking about something; she did not stir an eyelash, nor hear me. Her\nface, her attitude, and her fixed, expressionless gaze, and her\nincredibly miserable, dreadful, and icy-cold memories, and around her\nthe gondolas, the lights, the music, the song with its vigorous\npassionate cry of \"_Jam-mo! Jam-mo!_\"--what contrasts in life! When she\nsat like that, with tightly clasped hands, stony, mournful, I used to\nfeel as though we were both characters in some novel in the\nold-fashioned style called \"The Ill-fated,\" \"The Abandoned,\" or\nsomething of the sort. Both of us: she--the ill-fated, the abandoned;\nand I--the faithful, devoted friend, the dreamer, and, if you like it, a\nsuperfluous man, a failure capable of nothing but coughing and dreaming,\nand perhaps sacrificing myself.\n\nBut who and what needed my sacrifices now? And what had I to sacrifice,\nindeed?\n\nWhen we came in in the evening we always drank tea in her room and\ntalked. We did not shrink from touching on old, unhealed wounds--on the\ncontrary, for some reason I felt a positive pleasure in telling her\nabout my life at Orlov's, or referring openly to relations which I knew\nand which could not have been concealed from me.\n\n\"At moments I hated you,\" I said to her. \"When he was capricious,\ncondescending, told you lies, I marvelled how it was you did not see,\ndid not understand, when it was all so clear! You kissed his hands, you\nknelt to him, you flattered him ...\"\n\n\"When I ... kissed his hands and knelt to him, I loved him ...\" she\nsaid, blushing crimson.\n\n\"Can it have been so difficult to see through him? A fine sphinx! A\nsphinx indeed--a _kammer-junker!_ I reproach you for nothing, God\nforbid,\" I went on, feeling I was coarse, that I had not the tact, the\ndelicacy which are so essential when you have to do with a\nfellow-creature's soul; in early days before I knew her I had not\nnoticed this defect in myself. \"But how could you fail to see what he\nwas,\" I went on, speaking more softly and more diffidently, however.\n\n\"You mean to say you despise my past, and you are right,\" she said,\ndeeply stirred. \"You belong to a special class of men who cannot be\njudged by ordinary standards; your moral requirements are exceptionally\nrigorous, and I understand you can't forgive things. I understand you,\nand if sometimes I say the opposite, it doesn't mean that I look at\nthings differently from you; I speak the same old nonsense simply\nbecause I haven't had time yet to wear out my old clothes and\nprejudices. I, too, hate and despise my past, and Orlov and my love....\nWhat was that love? It's positively absurd now,\" she said, going to the\nwindow and looking down at the canal. \"All this love only clouds the\nconscience and confuses the mind. The meaning of life is to be found\nonly in one thing--fighting. To get one's heel on the vile head of the\nserpent and to crush it! That's the meaning of life. In that alone or in\nnothing.\"\n\nI told her long stories of my past, and described my really astounding\nadventures. But of the change that had taken place in me I did not say\none word. She always listened to me with great attention, and at\ninteresting places she rubbed her hands as though vexed that it had not\nyet been her lot to experience such adventures, such joys and terrors.\nThen she would suddenly fall to musing and retreat into herself, and I\ncould see from her face that she was not attending to me.\n\nI closed the windows that looked out on the canal and asked whether we\nshould not have the fire lighted.\n\n\"No, never mind. I am not cold,\" she said, smiling listlessly. \"I only\nfeel weak. Do you know, I fancy I have grown much wiser lately. I have\nextraordinary, original ideas now. When I think of my past, of my life\nthen ... people in general, in fact, it is all summed up for me in the\nimage of my stepmother. Coarse, insolent, soulless, false, depraved, and\na morphia maniac too. My father, who was feeble and weak-willed, married\nmy mother for her money and drove her into consumption; but his second\nwife, my stepmother, he loved passionately, insanely.... What I had to\nput up with! But what is the use of talking! And so, as I say, it is all\nsummed up in her image.... And it vexes me that my stepmother is dead. I\nshould like to meet her now!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she answered with a laugh and a graceful movement of her\nhead. \"Good-night. You must get well. As soon as you are well, we'll\ntake up our work ... It's time to begin.\"\n\nAfter I had said good-night and had my hand on the door-handle, she\nsaid:\n\n\"What do you think? Is Polya still living there?\"\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\nAnd I went off to my room. So we spent a whole month. One grey morning\nwhen we both stood at my window, looking at the clouds which were moving\nup from the sea, and at the darkening canal, expecting every minute that\nit would pour with rain, and when a thick, narrow streak of rain covered\nthe sea as though with a muslin veil, we both felt suddenly dreary. The\nsame day we both set off for Florence.\n\n\nXVI\n\nIt was autumn, at Nice. One morning when I went into her room she was\nsitting on a low chair, bent together and huddled up, with her legs\ncrossed and her face hidden in her hands. She was weeping bitterly, with\nsobs, and her long, unbrushed hair fell on her knees. The impression of\nthe exquisite marvellous sea which I had only just seen and of which I\nwanted to tell her, left me all at once, and my heart ached.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked; she took one hand from her face and motioned me\nto go away. \"What is it?\" I repeated, and for the first time during our\nacquaintance I kissed her hand.\n\n\"No, it's nothing, nothing,\" she said quickly. \"Oh, it's nothing,\nnothing.... Go away.... You see, I am not dressed.\"\n\nI went out overwhelmed. The calm and serene mood in which I had been for\nso long was poisoned by compassion. I had a passionate longing to fall\nat her feet, to entreat her not to weep in solitude, but to share her\ngrief with me, and the monotonous murmur of the sea already sounded a\ngloomy prophecy in my ears, and I foresaw fresh tears, fresh troubles,\nand fresh losses in the future. \"What is she crying about? What is it?\"\nI wondered, recalling her face and her agonised look. I remembered she\nwas with child. She tried to conceal her condition from other people,\nand also from herself. At home she went about in a loose wrapper or in a\nblouse with extremely full folds over the bosom, and when she went out\nanywhere she laced herself in so tightly that on two occasions she\nfainted when we were out. She never spoke to me of her condition, and\nwhen I hinted that it might be as well to see a doctor, she flushed\ncrimson and said not a word.\n\nWhen I went to see her next time she was already dressed and had her\nhair done.\n\n\"There, there,\" I said, seeing that she was ready to cry again. \"We had\nbetter go to the sea and have a talk.\"\n\n\"I can't talk. Forgive me, I am in the mood now when one wants to be\nalone. And, if you please, Vladimir Ivanitch, another time you want to\ncome into my room, be so good as to give a knock at the door.\"\n\nThat \"be so good\" had a peculiar, unfeminine sound. I went away. My\naccursed Petersburg mood came back, and all my dreams were crushed and\ncrumpled up like leaves by the heat. I felt I was alone again and there\nwas no nearness between us. I was no more to her than that cobweb to\nthat palm-tree, which hangs on it by chance and which will be torn off\nand carried away by the wind. I walked about the square where the band\nwas playing, went into the Casino; there I looked at overdressed and\nheavily perfumed women, and every one of them glanced at me as though\nshe would say: \"You are alone; that's all right.\" Then I went out on the\nterrace and looked for a long time at the sea. There was not one sail on\nthe horizon. On the left bank, in the lilac-coloured mist, there were\nmountains, gardens, towers, and houses, the sun was sparkling over it\nall, but it was all alien, indifferent, an incomprehensible tangle.\n\n\nXVII\n\nShe used as before to come into my room in the morning to coffee, but we\nno longer dined together, as she said she was not hungry; and she lived\nonly on coffee, tea, and various trifles such as oranges and caramels.\n\nAnd we no longer had conversations in the evening. I don't know why it\nwas like this. Ever since the day when I had found her in tears she had\ntreated me somehow lightly, at times casually, even ironically, and for\nsome reason called me \"My good sir.\" What had before seemed to her\nterrible, heroic, marvellous, and had stirred her envy and enthusiasm,\ndid not touch her now at all, and usually after listening to me, she\nstretched and said:\n\n\"Yes, 'great things were done in days of yore,' my good sir.\"\n\nIt sometimes happened even that I did not see her for days together. I\nwould knock timidly and guiltily at her door and get no answer; I would\nknock again--still silence.... I would stand near the door and listen;\nthen the chambermaid would pass and say coldly, \"_Madame est partie._\"\nThen I would walk about the passages of the hotel, walk and walk....\nEnglish people, full-bosomed ladies, waiters in swallow-tails.... And as\nI keep gazing at the long striped rug that stretches the whole length of\nthe corridor, the idea occurs to me that I am playing in the life of\nthis woman a strange, probably false part, and that it is beyond my\npower to alter that part. I run to my room and fall on my bed, and think\nand think, and can come to no conclusion; and all that is clear to me is\nthat I want to live, and that the plainer and the colder and the harder\nher face grows, the nearer she is to me, and the more intensely and\npainfully I feel our kinship. Never mind \"My good sir,\" never mind her\nlight careless tone, never mind anything you like, only don't leave me,\nmy treasure. I am afraid to be alone.\n\nThen I go out into the corridor again, listen in a tremor.... I have no\ndinner; I don't notice the approach of evening. At last about eleven I\nhear the familiar footstep, and at the turn near the stairs Zinaida\nFyodorovna comes into sight.\n\n\"Are you taking a walk?\" she would ask as she passes me. \"You had better\ngo out into the air.... Good-night!\"\n\n\"But shall we not meet again to-day?\"\n\n\"I think it's late. But as you like.\"\n\n\"Tell me, where have you been?\" I would ask, following her into the\nroom.\n\n\"Where? To Monte Carlo.\" She took ten gold coins out of her pocket and\nsaid: \"Look, my good sir; I have won. That's at roulette.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! As though you would gamble.\"\n\n\"Why not? I am going again to-morrow.\"\n\nI imagined her with a sick and morbid face, in her condition, tightly\nlaced, standing near the gaming-table in a crowd of cocottes, of old\nwomen in their dotage who swarm round the gold like flies round the\nhoney. I remembered she had gone off to Monte Carlo for some reason in\nsecret from me.\n\n\"I don't believe you,\" I said one day. \"You wouldn't go there.\"\n\n\"Don't agitate yourself. I can't lose much.\"\n\n\"It's not the question of what you lose,\" I said with annoyance. \"Has it\nnever occurred to you while you were playing there that the glitter of\ngold, all these women, young and old, the croupiers, all the\nsurroundings--that it is all a vile, loathsome mockery at the toiler's\nlabour, at his bloody sweat?\n\n\"If one doesn't play, what is one to do here?\" she asked. \"The toiler's\nlabour and his bloody sweat--all that eloquence you can put off till\nanother time; but now, since you have begun, let me go on. Let me ask\nyou bluntly, what is there for me to do here, and what am I to do?\"\n\n\"What are you to do?\" I said, shrugging my shoulders. \"That's a question\nthat can't be answered straight off.\"\n\n\"I beg you to answer me honestly, Vladimir Ivanitch,\" she said, and her\nface looked angry. \"Once I have brought myself to ask you this question,\nI am not going to listen to stock phrases. I am asking you,\" she went\non, beating her hand on the table, as though marking time, \"what ought I\nto do here? And not only here at Nice, but in general?\"\n\nI did not speak, but looked out of window to the sea. My heart was\nbeating terribly.\n\n\"Vladimir Ivanitch,\" she said softly and breathlessly; it was hard for\nher to speak--\"Vladimir Ivanitch, if you do not believe in the cause\nyourself, if you no longer think of going back to it, why ... why did\nyou drag me out of Petersburg? Why did you make me promises, why did you\nrouse mad hopes? Your convictions have changed; you have become a\ndifferent man, and nobody blames you for it--our convictions are not\nalways in our power. But ... but, Vladimir Ivanitch, for God's sake, why\nare you not sincere?\" she went on softly, coming up to me. \"All these\nmonths when I have been dreaming aloud, raving, going into raptures over\nmy plans, remodelling my life on a new pattern, why didn't you tell me\nthe truth? Why were you silent or encouraged me by your stories, and\nbehaved as though you were in complete sympathy with me? Why was it? Why\nwas it necessary?\"\n\n\"It's difficult to acknowledge one's bankruptcy,\" I said, turning round,\nbut not looking at her. \"Yes, I have no faith; I am worn out. I have\nlost heart.... It is difficult to be truthful--very difficult, and I\nheld my tongue. God forbid that any one should have to go through what I\nhave been through.\"\n\nI felt that I was on the point of tears, and ceased speaking.\n\n\"Vladimir Ivanitch,\" she said, and took me by both hands, \"you have been\nthrough so much and seen so much of life, you know more than I do; think\nseriously, and tell me, what am I to do? Teach me! If you haven't the\nstrength to go forward yourself and take others with you, at least show\nme where to go. After all, I am a living, feeling, thinking being. To\nsink into a false position ... to play an absurd part ... is painful to\nme. I don't reproach you, I don't blame you; I only ask you.\"\n\nTea was brought in.\n\n\"Well?\" said Zinaida Fyodorovna, giving me a glass. \"What do you say to\nme?\"\n\n\"There is more light in the world than you see through your window,\" I\nanswered. \"And there are other people besides me, Zinaida Fyodorovna.\"\n\n\"Then tell me who they are,\" she said eagerly. \"That's all I ask of\nyou.\"\n\n\"And I want to say, too,\" I went on, \"one can serve an idea in more than\none calling. If one has made a mistake and lost faith in one, one may\nfind another. The world of ideas is large and cannot be exhausted.\"\n\n\"The world of ideas!\" she said, and she looked into my face\nsarcastically. \"Then we had better leave off talking. What's the\nuse?...\"\n\nShe flushed.\n\n\"The world of ideas!\" she repeated. She threw her dinner-napkin aside,\nand an expression of indignation and contempt came into her face. \"All\nyour fine ideas, I see, lead up to one inevitable, essential step: I\nought to become your mistress. That's what's wanted. To be taken up with\nideas without being the mistress of an honourable, progressive man, is\nas good as not understanding the ideas. One has to begin with that ...\nthat is, with being your mistress, and the rest will come of itself.\"\n\n\"You are irritated, Zinaida Fyodorovna,\" I said.\n\n\"No, I am sincere!\" she cried, breathing hard. \"I am sincere!\"\n\n\"You are sincere, perhaps, but you are in error, and it hurts me to hear\nyou.\"\n\n\"I am in error?\" she laughed. \"Any one else might say that, but not you,\nmy dear sir! I may seem to you indelicate, cruel, but I don't care: you\nlove me? You love me, don't you?\"\n\nI shrugged my shoulders.\n\n\"Yes, shrug your shoulders!\" she went on sarcastically. \"When you were\nill I heard you in your delirium, and ever since these adoring eyes,\nthese sighs, and edifying conversations about friendship, about\nspiritual kinship.... But the point is, why haven't you been sincere?\nWhy have you concealed what is and talked about what isn't? Had you said\nfrom the beginning what ideas exactly led you to drag me from\nPetersburg, I should have known. I should have poisoned myself then as I\nmeant to, and there would have been none of this tedious farce.... But\nwhat's the use of talking!\"\n\nWith a wave of the hand she sat down.\n\n\"You speak to me as though you suspected me of dishonourable\nintentions,\" I said, offended.\n\n\"Oh, very well. What's the use of talking! I don't suspect you of\nintentions, but of having no intentions. If you had any, I should have\nknown them by now. You had nothing but ideas and love. For the\npresent--ideas and love, and in prospect--me as your mistress. That's in\nthe order of things both in life and in novels.... Here you abused him,\"\nshe said, and she slapped the table with her hand, \"but one can't help\nagreeing with him. He has good reasons for despising these ideas.\"\n\n\"He does not despise ideas; he is afraid of them,\" I cried. \"He is a\ncoward and a liar.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well. He is a coward and a liar, and deceived me. And you?\nExcuse my frankness; what are you? He deceived me and left me to take my\nchance in Petersburg, and you have deceived me and abandoned me here.\nBut he did not mix up ideas with his deceit, and you ...\"\n\n\"For goodness' sake, why are you saying this?\" I cried in horror,\nwringing my hands and going up to her quickly. \"No, Zinaida Fyodorovna,\nthis is cynicism. You must not be so despairing; listen to me,\" I went\non, catching at a thought which flashed dimly upon me, and which seemed\nto me might still save us both. \"Listen. I have passed through so many\nexperiences in my time that my head goes round at the thought of them,\nand I have realised with my mind, with my racked soul, that man finds\nhis true destiny in nothing if not in self-sacrificing love for his\nneighbour. It is towards that we must strive, and that is our\ndestination! That is my faith!\"\n\nI wanted to go on to speak of mercy, of forgiveness, but there was an\ninsincere note in my voice, and I was embarrassed.\n\n\"I want to live!\" I said genuinely. \"To live, to live! I want peace,\ntranquillity; I want warmth--this sea here--to have you near. Oh, how I\nwish I could rouse in you the same thirst for life! You spoke just now\nof love, but it would be enough for me to have you near, to hear your\nvoice, to watch the look in your face ...!\"\n\nShe flushed crimson, and to hinder my speaking, said quickly:\n\n\"You love life, and I hate it. So our ways lie apart.\"\n\nShe poured herself out some tea, but did not touch it, went into the\nbedroom, and lay down.\n\n\"I imagine it is better to cut short this conversation,\" she said to me\nfrom within. \"Everything is over for me, and I want nothing.... What\nmore is there to say?\"\n\n\"No, it's not all over!\"\n\n\"Oh, very well!... I know! I am sick of it.... That's enough.\"\n\nI got up, took a turn from one end of the room to the other, and went\nout into the corridor. When late at night I went to her door and\nlistened, I distinctly heard her crying.\n\nNext morning the waiter, handing me my clothes, informed me, with a\nsmile, that the lady in number thirteen was confined. I dressed somehow,\nand almost fainting with terror ran to Zinaida Fyodorovna. In her room I\nfound a doctor, a midwife, and an elderly Russian lady from Harkov,\ncalled Darya Milhailovna. There was a smell of ether. I had scarcely\ncrossed the threshold when from the room where she was lying I heard a\nlow, plaintive moan, and, as though it had been wafted me by the wind\nfrom Russia, I thought of Orlov, his irony, Polya, the Neva, the\ndrifting snow, then the cab without an apron, the prediction I had read\nin the cold morning sky, and the despairing cry \"Nina! Nina!\"\n\n\"Go in to her,\" said the lady.\n\nI went in to see Zinaida Fyodorovna, feeling as though I were the father\nof the child. She was lying with her eyes closed, looking thin and pale,\nwearing a white cap edged with lace. I remember there were two\nexpressions on her face: one--cold, indifferent, apathetic; the other--a\nlook of childish helplessness given her by the white cap. She did not\nhear me come in, or heard, perhaps, but did not pay attention. I stood,\nlooked at her, and waited.\n\nBut her face was contorted with pain; she opened her eyes and gazed at\nthe ceiling, as though wondering what was happening to her.... There was\na look of loathing on her face.\n\n\"It's horrible ...\" she whispered.\n\n\"Zinaida Fyodorovna.\" I spoke her name softly. She looked at me\nindifferently, listlessly, and closed her eyes. I stood there a little\nwhile, then went away.\n\nAt night, Darya Mihailovna informed me that the child, a girl, was born,\nbut that the mother was in a dangerous condition. Then I heard noise and\nbustle in the passage. Darya Mihailovna came to me again and with a face\nof despair, wringing her hands, said:\n\n\"Oh, this is awful! The doctor suspects that she has taken poison! Oh,\nhow badly Russians do behave here!\"\n\nAnd at twelve o'clock the next day Zinaida Fyodorovna died.\n\n\nXVIII\n\nTwo years had passed. Circumstances had changed; I had come to\nPetersburg again and could live here openly. I was no longer afraid of\nbeing and seeming sentimental, and gave myself up entirely to the\nfatherly, or rather idolatrous feeling roused in me by Sonya, Zinaida\nFyodorovna's child. I fed her with my own hands, gave her her bath, put\nher to bed, never took my eyes off her for nights together, and screamed\nwhen it seemed to me that the nurse was just going to drop her. My\nthirst for normal ordinary life became stronger and more acute as time\nwent on, but wider visions stopped short at Sonya, as though I had found\nin her at last just what I needed. I loved the child madly. In her I saw\nthe continuation of my life, and it was not exactly that I fancied, but\nI felt, I almost believed, that when I had cast off at last my long,\nbony, bearded frame, I should go on living in those little blue eyes,\nthat silky flaxen hair, those dimpled pink hands which stroked my face\nso lovingly and were clasped round my neck.\n\nSonya's future made me anxious. Orlov was her father; in her birth\ncertificate she was called Krasnovsky, and the only person who knew of\nher existence, and took interest in her--that is, I--was at death's\ndoor. I had to think about her seriously.\n\nThe day after I arrived in Petersburg I went to see Orlov. The door was\nopened to me by a stout old fellow with red whiskers and no moustache,\nwho looked like a German. Polya, who was tidying the drawing-room, did\nnot recognise me, but Orlov knew me at once.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Revolutionist!\" he said, looking at me with curiosity, and\nlaughing. \"What fate has brought you?\"\n\nHe was not changed in the least: the same well-groomed, unpleasant face,\nthe same irony. And a new book was lying on the table just as of old,\nwith an ivory paper-knife thrust in it. He had evidently been reading\nbefore I came in. He made me sit down, offered me a cigar, and with a\ndelicacy only found in well-bred people, concealing the unpleasant\nfeeling aroused by my face and my wasted figure, observed casually that\nI was not in the least changed, and that he would have known me anywhere\nin spite of my having grown a beard. We talked of the weather, of Paris.\nTo dispose as quickly as possible of the oppressive, inevitable\nquestion, which weighed upon him and me, he asked:\n\n\"Zinaida Fyodorovna is dead?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I answered.\n\n\"In childbirth?\"\n\n\"Yes, in childbirth. The doctor suspected another cause of death, but\n... it is more comforting for you and for me to think that she died in\nchildbirth.\"\n\nHe sighed decorously and was silent. The angel of silence passed over\nus, as they say.\n\n\"Yes. And here everything is as it used to be--no changes,\" he said\nbriskly, seeing that I was looking about the room. \"My father, as you\nknow, has left the service and is living in retirement; I am still in\nthe same department. Do you remember Pekarsky? He is just the same as\never. Gruzin died of diphtheria a year ago.... Kukushkin is alive, and\noften speaks of you. By the way,\" said Orlov, dropping his eyes with an\nair of reserve, \"when Kukushkin heard who you were, he began telling\nevery one you had attacked him and tried to murder him ... and that he\nonly just escaped with his life.\"\n\nI did not speak.\n\n\"Old servants do not forget their masters.... It's very nice of you,\"\nsaid Orlov jocosely. \"Will you have some wine and some coffee, though? I\nwill tell them to make some.\"\n\n\"No, thank you. I have come to see you about a very important matter,\nGeorgy Ivanitch.\"\n\n\"I am not very fond of important matters, but I shall be glad to be of\nservice to you. What do you want?\"\n\n\"You see,\" I began, growing agitated, \"I have here with me Zinaida\nFyodorovna's daughter.... Hitherto I have brought her up, but, as you\nsee, before many days I shall be an empty sound. I should like to die\nwith the thought that she is provided for.\"\n\nOrlov coloured a little, frowned a little, and took a cursory and sullen\nglance at me. He was unpleasantly affected, not so much by the\n\"important matter\" as by my words about death, about becoming an empty\nsound.\n\n\"Yes, it must be thought about,\" he said, screening his eyes as though\nfrom the sun. \"Thank you. You say it's a girl?\"\n\n\"Yes, a girl. A wonderful child!\"\n\n\"Yes. Of course, it's not a lap-dog, but a human being. I understand we\nmust consider it seriously. I am prepared to do my part, and am very\ngrateful to you.\"\n\nHe got up, walked about, biting his nails, and stopped before a picture.\n\n\"We must think about it,\" he said in a hollow voice, standing with his\nback to me. \"I shall go to Pekarsky's to-day and will ask him to go to\nKrasnovsky's. I don't think he will make much ado about consenting to\ntake the child.\"\n\n\"But, excuse me, I don't see what Krasnovsky has got to do with it,\" I\nsaid, also getting up and walking to a picture at the other end of the\nroom.\n\n\"But she bears his name, of course!\" said Orlov.\n\n\"Yes, he may be legally obliged to accept the child--I don't know; but I\ncame to you, Georgy Ivanitch, not to discuss the legal aspect.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, you are right,\" he agreed briskly. \"I believe I am talking\nnonsense. But don't excite yourself. We will decide the matter to our\nmutual satisfaction. If one thing won't do, we'll try another; and if\nthat won't do, we'll try a third--one way or another this delicate\nquestion shall be settled. Pekarsky will arrange it all. Be so good as\nto leave me your address and I will let you know at once what we decide.\nWhere are you living?\"\n\nOrlov wrote down my address, sighed, and said with a smile:\n\n\"Oh, Lord, what a job it is to be the father of a little daughter! But\nPekarsky will arrange it all. He is a sensible man. Did you stay long in\nParis?\"\n\n\"Two months.\"\n\nWe were silent. Orlov was evidently afraid I should begin talking of the\nchild again, and to turn my attention in another direction, said:\n\n\"You have probably forgotten your letter by now. But I have kept it. I\nunderstand your mood at the time, and, I must own, I respect that\nletter. 'Damnable cold blood,' 'Asiatic,' 'coarse laugh'--that was\ncharming and characteristic,\" he went on with an ironical smile. \"And\nthe fundamental thought is perhaps near the truth, though one might\ndispute the question endlessly. That is,\" he hesitated, \"not dispute the\nthought itself, but your attitude to the question--your temperament, so\nto say. Yes, my life is abnormal, corrupted, of no use to any one, and\nwhat prevents me from beginning a new life is cowardice--there you are\nquite right. But that you take it so much to heart, are troubled, and\nreduced to despair by it--that's irrational; there you are quite wrong.\"\n\n\"A living man cannot help being troubled and reduced to despair when he\nsees that he himself is going to ruin and others are going to ruin round\nhim.\"\n\n\"Who doubts it! I am not advocating indifference; all I ask for is an\nobjective attitude to life. The more objective, the less danger of\nfalling into error. One must look into the root of things, and try to\nsee in every phenomenon a cause of all the other causes. We have grown\nfeeble, slack--degraded, in fact. Our generation is entirely composed of\nneurasthenics and whimperers; we do nothing but talk of fatigue and\nexhaustion. But the fault is neither yours nor mine; we are of too\nlittle consequence to affect the destiny of a whole generation. We must\nsuppose for that larger, more general causes with a solid _raison\nd'etre_ from the biological point of view. We are neurasthenics, flabby,\nrenegades, but perhaps it's necessary and of service for generations\nthat will come after us. Not one hair falls from the head without the\nwill of the Heavenly Father--in other words, nothing happens by chance\nin Nature and in human environment. Everything has its cause and is\ninevitable. And if so, why should we worry and write despairing\nletters?\"\n\n\"That's all very well,\" I said, thinking a little. \"I believe it will be\neasier and clearer for the generations to come; our experience will be\nat their service. But one wants to live apart from future generations\nand not only for their sake. Life is only given us once, and one wants\nto live it boldly, with full consciousness and beauty. One wants to play\na striking, independent, noble part; one wants to make history so that\nthose generations may not have the right to say of each of us that we\nwere nonentities or worse.... I believe what is going on about us is\ninevitable and not without a purpose, but what have I to do with that\ninevitability? Why should my ego be lost?\"\n\n\"Well, there's no help for it,\" sighed Orlov, getting up and, as it\nwere, giving me to understand that our conversation was over.\n\nI took my hat.\n\n\"We've only been sitting here half an hour, and how many questions we\nhave settled, when you come to think of it!\" said Orlov, seeing me into\nthe hall. \"So I will see to that matter.... I will see Pekarsky\nto-day.... Don't be uneasy.\"\n\nHe stood waiting while I put on my coat, and was obviously relieved at\nthe feeling that I was going away.\n\n\"Georgy Ivanitch, give me back my letter,\" I said.\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nHe went to his study, and a minute later returned with the letter. I\nthanked him and went away.\n\nThe next day I got a letter from him. He congratulated me on the\nsatisfactory settlement of the question. Pekarsky knew a lady, he wrote,\nwho kept a school, something like a kindergarten, where she took quite\nlittle children. The lady could be entirely depended upon, but before\nconcluding anything with her it would be as well to discuss the matter\nwith Krasnovsky--it was a matter of form. He advised me to see Pekarsky\nat once and to take the birth certificate with me, if I had it. \"Rest\nassured of the sincere respect and devotion of your humble servant....\"\n\nI read this letter, and Sonya sat on the table and gazed at me\nattentively without blinking, as though she knew her fate was being\ndecided.\n\n\n\n\nTHE HUSBAND\n\n\nIN the course of the maneuvres the N---- cavalry regiment halted for a\nnight at the district town of K----. Such an event as the visit of\nofficers always has the most exciting and inspiring effect on the\ninhabitants of provincial towns. The shopkeepers dream of getting rid of\nthe rusty sausages and \"best brand\" sardines that have been lying for\nten years on their shelves; the inns and restaurants keep open all\nnight; the Military Commandant, his secretary, and the local garrison\nput on their best uniforms; the police flit to and fro like mad, while\nthe effect on the ladies is beyond all description.\n\nThe ladies of K----, hearing the regiment approaching, forsook their\npans of boiling jam and ran into the street. Forgetting their morning\n_deshabille_ and general untidiness, they rushed breathless with\nexcitement to meet the regiment, and listened greedily to the band\nplaying the march. Looking at their pale, ecstatic faces, one might have\nthought those strains came from some heavenly choir rather than from a\nmilitary brass band.\n\n\"The regiment!\" they cried joyfully. \"The regiment is coming!\"\n\nWhat could this unknown regiment that came by chance to-day and would\ndepart at dawn to-morrow mean to them?\n\nAfterwards, when the officers were standing in the middle of the square,\nand, with their hands behind them, discussing the question of billets,\nall the ladies were gathered together at the examining magistrate's and\nvying with one another in their criticisms of the regiment. They already\nknew, goodness knows how, that the colonel was married, but not living\nwith his wife; that the senior officer's wife had a baby born dead every\nyear; that the adjutant was hopelessly in love with some countess, and\nhad even once attempted suicide. They knew everything. When a\npock-marked soldier in a red shirt darted past the windows, they knew\nfor certain that it was Lieutenant Rymzov's orderly running about the\ntown, trying to get some English bitter ale on tick for his master. They\nhad only caught a passing glimpse of the officers' backs, but had\nalready decided that there was not one handsome or interesting man among\nthem.... Having talked to their hearts' content, they sent for the\nMilitary Commandant and the committee of the club, and instructed them\nat all costs to make arrangements for a dance.\n\nTheir wishes were carried out. At nine o'clock in the evening the\nmilitary band was playing in the street before the club, while in the\nclub itself the officers were dancing with the ladies of K----. The\nladies felt as though they were on wings. Intoxicated by the dancing,\nthe music, and the clank of spurs, they threw themselves heart and soul\ninto making the acquaintance of their new partners, and quite forgot\ntheir old civilian friends. Their fathers and husbands, forced\ntemporarily into the background, crowded round the meagre refreshment\ntable in the entrance hall. All these government cashiers, secretaries,\nclerks, and superintendents--stale, sickly-looking, clumsy figures--were\nperfectly well aware of their inferiority. They did not even enter the\nball-room, but contented themselves with watching their wives and\ndaughters in the distance dancing with the accomplished and graceful\nofficers.\n\nAmong the husbands was Shalikov, the tax-collector--a narrow, spiteful\nsoul, given to drink, with a big, closely cropped head, and thick,\nprotruding lips. He had had a university education; there had been a\ntime when he used to read progressive literature and sing students'\nsongs, but now, as he said of himself, he was a tax-collector and\nnothing more.\n\nHe stood leaning against the doorpost, his eyes fixed on his wife, Anna\nPavlovna, a little brunette of thirty, with a long nose and a pointed\nchin. Tightly laced, with her face carefully powdered, she danced\nwithout pausing for breath--danced till she was ready to drop exhausted.\nBut though she was exhausted in body, her spirit was inexhaustible....\nOne could see as she danced that her thoughts were with the past, that\nfaraway past when she used to dance at the \"College for Young Ladies,\"\ndreaming of a life of luxury and gaiety, and never doubting that her\nhusband was to be a prince or, at the worst, a baron.\n\nThe tax-collector watched, scowling with spite....\n\nIt was not jealousy he was feeling. He was ill-humoured--first, because\nthe room was taken up with dancing and there was nowhere he could play a\ngame of cards; secondly, because he could not endure the sound of wind\ninstruments; and, thirdly, because he fancied the officers treated the\ncivilians somewhat too casually and disdainfully. But what above\neverything revolted him and moved him to indignation was the expression\nof happiness on his wife's face.\n\n\"It makes me sick to look at her!\" he muttered. \"Going on for forty, and\nnothing to boast of at any time, and she must powder her face and lace\nherself up! And frizzing her hair! Flirting and making faces, and\nfancying she's doing the thing in style! Ugh! you're a pretty figure,\nupon my soul!\"\n\nAnna Pavlovna was so lost in the dance that she did not once glance at\nher husband.\n\n\"Of course not! Where do we poor country bumpkins come in!\" sneered the\ntax-collector.\n\n\"We are at a discount now.... We're clumsy seals, unpolished provincial\nbears, and she's the queen of the ball! She has kept enough of her looks\nto please even officers ... They'd not object to making love to her, I\ndare say!\"\n\nDuring the mazurka the tax-collector's face twitched with spite. A\nblack-haired officer with prominent eyes and Tartar cheekbones danced\nthe mazurka with Anna Pavlovna. Assuming a stern expression, he worked\nhis legs with gravity and feeling, and so crooked his knees that he\nlooked like a jack-a-dandy pulled by strings, while Anna Pavlovna, pale\nand thrilled, bending her figure languidly and turning her eyes up,\ntried to look as though she scarcely touched the floor, and evidently\nfelt herself that she was not on earth, not at the local club, but\nsomewhere far, far away--in the clouds. Not only her face but her whole\nfigure was expressive of beatitude.... The tax-collector could endure it\nno longer; he felt a desire to jeer at that beatitude, to make Anna\nPavlovna feel that she had forgotten herself, that life was by no means\nso delightful as she fancied now in her excitement....\n\n\"You wait; I'll teach you to smile so blissfully,\" he muttered. \"You are\nnot a boarding-school miss, you are not a girl. An old fright ought to\nrealise she is a fright!\"\n\nPetty feelings of envy, vexation, wounded vanity, of that small,\nprovincial misanthropy engendered in petty officials by vodka and a\nsedentary life, swarmed in his heart like mice. Waiting for the end of\nthe mazurka, he went into the hall and walked up to his wife. Anna\nPavlovna was sitting with her partner, and, flirting her fan and\ncoquettishly dropping her eyelids, was describing how she used to dance\nin Petersburg (her lips were pursed up like a rosebud, and she\npronounced \"at home in Puetuersburg\").\n\n\"Anyuta, let us go home,\" croaked the tax-collector.\n\nSeeing her husband standing before her, Anna Pavlovna started as though\nrecalling the fact that she had a husband; then she flushed all over:\nshe felt ashamed that she had such a sickly-looking, ill-humoured,\nordinary husband.\n\n\"Let us go home,\" repeated the tax-collector.\n\n\"Why? It's quite early!\"\n\n\"I beg you to come home!\" said the tax-collector deliberately, with a\nspiteful expression.\n\n\"Why? Has anything happened?\" Anna Pavlovna asked in a flutter.\n\n\"Nothing has happened, but I wish you to go home at once.... I wish it;\nthat's enough, and without further talk, please.\"\n\nAnna Pavlovna was not afraid of her husband, but she felt ashamed on\naccount of her partner, who was looking at her husband with surprise and\namusement. She got up and moved a little apart with her husband.\n\n\"What notion is this?\" she began. \"Why go home? Why, it's not eleven\no'clock.\"\n\n\"I wish it, and that's enough. Come along, and that's all about it.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly! Go home alone if you want to.\"\n\n\"All right; then I shall make a scene.\"\n\nThe tax-collector saw the look of beatitude gradually vanish from his\nwife's face, saw how ashamed and miserable she was--and he felt a little\nhappier.\n\n\"Why do you want me at once?\" asked his wife.\n\n\"I don't want you, but I wish you to be at home. I wish it, that's all.\"\n\nAt first Anna Pavlovna refused to hear of it, then she began entreating\nher husband to let her stay just another half-hour; then, without\nknowing why, she began to apologise, to protest--and all in a whisper,\nwith a smile, that the spectators might not suspect that she was having\na tiff with her husband. She began assuring him she would not stay long,\nonly another ten minutes, only five minutes; but the tax-collector stuck\nobstinately to his point.\n\n\"Stay if you like,\" he said, \"but I'll make a scene if you do.\"\n\nAnd as she talked to her husband Anna Pavlovna looked thinner, older,\nplainer. Pale, biting her lips, and almost crying, she went out to the\nentry and began putting on her things.\n\n\"You are not going?\" asked the ladies in surprise. \"Anna Pavlovna, you\nare not going, dear?\"\n\n\"Her head aches,\" said the tax-collector for his wife.\n\nComing out of the club, the husband and wife walked all the way home in\nsilence. The tax-collector walked behind his wife, and watching her\ndowncast, sorrowful, humiliated little figure, he recalled the look of\nbeatitude which had so irritated him at the club, and the consciousness\nthat the beatitude was gone filled his soul with triumph. He was pleased\nand satisfied, and at the same time he felt the lack of something; he\nwould have liked to go back to the club and make every one feel dreary\nand miserable, so that all might know how stale and worthless life is\nwhen you walk along the streets in the dark and hear the slush of the\nmud under your feet, and when you know that you will wake up next\nmorning with nothing to look forward to but vodka and cards. Oh, how\nawful it is!\n\nAnd Anna Pavlovna could scarcely walk.... She was still under the\ninfluence of the dancing, the music, the talk, the lights, and the\nnoise; she asked herself as she walked along why God had thus afflicted\nher. She felt miserable, insulted, and choking with hate as she listened\nto her husband's heavy footsteps. She was silent, trying to think of the\nmost offensive, biting, and venomous word she could hurl at her husband,\nand at the same time she was fully aware that no word could penetrate\nher tax-collector's hide. What did he care for words? Her bitterest\nenemy could not have contrived for her a more helpless position.\n\nAnd meanwhile the band was playing and the darkness was full of the most\nrousing, intoxicating dance-tunes.", "title": "The Lady with the Dog and Other Stories"}

{"summary": "The story begins in May 1863, in the Lidenbrock house in Hamburg, Germany, with Professor Lidenbrock rushing home to peruse his latest purchase, an original runic manuscript of an Icelandic saga written by Snorri Sturluson (\"Heimskringla\"; the chronicle of the Norwegian kings who ruled over Iceland). While looking through the book, Lidenbrock and his nephew Axel find a coded note written in runic script. (This was a first indication of Verne's love for cryptography. Coded, cryptic or incomplete messages as a plot device would continue to appear in many of his works and in each case Verne would go a long way to explain not only the code used but also the mechanisms used to retrieve the original text.) Lidenbrock and Axel transliterate the runic characters into Latin letters, revealing a message written in a seemingly bizarre code. Lidenbrock attempts a decipherment, deducing the message to be a kind of transposition cipher; but his results are as meaningless as the original.\nProfessor Lidenbrock decides to lock everyone in the house and force himself and the others (Axel, and the maid, Martha) to go without food until he cracks the code. Axel discovers the answer when fanning himself with the deciphered text: Lidenbrock's decipherment was correct, and only needs to be read backwards to reveal sentences written in rough Latin. Axel decides to keep the secret hidden from Professor Lidenbrock, afraid of what the Professor might do with the knowledge, but after two days without food he cannot stand the hunger and reveals the secret to his uncle. Lidenbrock translates the note, which is revealed to be a medieval note written by the (fictional) Icelandic alchemist Arne Saknussemm, who claims to have discovered a passage to the centre of the Earth via Snæfell in Iceland. In what Axel calls bad Latin, the deciphered message reads:\n\nIn Snefflls [sic] Iokulis kraterem kem delibat umbra Skartaris Iulii intra kalendas deskende, audas uiator, te [sic] terrestre kentrum attinges. Kod feki. Arne Saknussemm.\n\nIn slightly better Latin, with errors amended:\n\nIn Sneffels Jokulis craterem, quem delibat umbra Scartaris, Julii intra kalendas descende, audax viator, et terrestre centrum attinges; quod feci. Arne Saknussemm\n\nwhich, when translated into English, reads:\n\nDescend, bold traveller, into the crater of the jökull of Snæfell, which the shadow of Scartaris touches (lit: tastes) before the Kalends of July, and you will attain the centre of the earth. I did it. Arne Saknussemm\n\nProfessor Lidenbrock is a man of astonishing impatience, and departs for Iceland immediately, taking his reluctant nephew with him. Axel, who, in comparison, is cowardly and anti-adventurous, repeatedly tries to reason with him, explaining his fears of descending into a volcano and putting forward various scientific theories as to why the journey is impossible, but Professor Lidenbrock repeatedly keeps himself blinded against Axel's point of view. After a rapid journey via Lübeck and Copenhagen, they arrive in Reykjavík, where the two procure the services of Hans Bjelke (a Danish-speaking Icelander eiderdown hunter) as their guide, and travel overland to the base of the volcano.\nIn late June, they reach the volcano, which has three craters. According to Saknussemm's message, the passage to the centre of the Earth is through the one crater that is touched by the shadow of a nearby mountain peak at noon. However, the text also states that this is only true during the last days of June. During the next few days, with July rapidly approaching, the weather is too cloudy for any shadows. Axel silently rejoices, hoping this will force his uncle – who has repeatedly tried to impart courage to him only to succeed in making him even more cowardly still – to give up the project and return home. Alas for Axel, however, on the second to last day, the sun comes out and the mountain peak shows the correct crater to take.\nAfter descending into the crater, the three travellers set off into the bowels of the Earth, encountering many strange phenomena and great dangers, including a chamber filled with combustible gas, and steep-sided wells around the \"path\". After taking a wrong turn, they run out of water and Axel almost dies, but Hans taps into a neighbouring subterranean river. Lidenbrock and Axel name the resulting stream the \"Hansbach\" in his honour and the three are saved. At another point, Axel becomes separated from the others and is lost several miles from them. Luckily, a strange acoustic phenomenon allows him to communicate with them from some miles away, and they are soon reunited.\nAfter descending many miles, following the course of the Hansbach, they reach an unimaginably vast cavern. This underground world is lit by electrically charged gas at the ceiling, and is filled with a very deep subterranean ocean, surrounded by a rocky coastline covered in petrified trees and giant mushrooms. The travelers build a raft out of trees and set sail. The Professor names this sea the Lidenbrock Sea. While on the water, they see several prehistoric creatures such as a giant Ichthyosaurus, which fights with a Plesiosaurus and wins. After the battle between the monsters, the party comes across an island with a huge geyser, which Lidenbrock names \"Axel's Island\".\nA lightning storm again threatens to destroy the raft and its passengers, but instead throws them onto the coastline. This part of the coast, Axel discovers, is alive with prehistoric plant and animal life forms, including giant insects and a herd of mastodons. On a beach covered with bones, Axel discovers an oversized human skull. Axel and Lidenbrock venture some way into the prehistoric forest, where Professor Lidenbrock points out, in a shaky voice, a prehistoric human, more than twelve feet in height, leaning against a tree and watching a herd of mastodons. Axel cannot be sure if he has really seen the man or not, and he and Professor Lidenbrock debate whether or not a proto-human civilization actually exists so far underground. The three wonder if the creature is a man-like ape, or an ape-like man. The sighting of the creature is considered the most alarming part of the story, and the explorers decide that it is better not to alert it to their presence as they fear it may be hostile.\nThe travellers continue to explore the coastline, and find a passageway marked by Saknussemm as the way ahead. However, it is blocked by what appears to be a recent cave-in and two of the three, Hans and the Professor, despair at being unable to hack their way through the granite wall. The adventurers plan to blast the rock with gun cotton and paddle out to sea to escape the blast. Upon executing the plan, however, they discover that behind the rockfall was a seemingly bottomless pit, not a passage to the centre of the earth. The travellers are swept away as the sea rushes into the large open gap in the ground. After spending hours being swept along at lightning speeds by the water, the raft ends up inside a large volcanic chimney filling with water and magma. Terrified, the three are rushed upwards, through stifling heat, and are ejected onto the surface from a side-vent of a stratovolcano. When they regain consciousness, they discover that they have been ejected from Stromboli, a volcanic island located in southern Italy. They return to Hamburg to great acclaim – Professor Lidenbrock is hailed as one of the great scientists of history, Axel marries his sweetheart Gräuben, and Hans eventually returns to his peaceful life in Iceland. The Professor has some regret that their journey was cut short.\nAt the very end of the book, Axel and Lidenbrock realize why their compass was behaving strangely after their journey on the raft. They realize that the needle was pointing the wrong way after being struck by an electric fireball which nearly destroyed the wooden raft.\n\n", "full_text": "A JOURNEY TO THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH\n\nBy Jules Verne\n\n\n\n\n[Redactor's Note: Journey to the Centre of the Earth is number\nV002 in the Taves and Michaluk numbering of the works of Jules\nVerne.

They were\ntruly so wonderful that even now I am bewildered when I think of them.\n\nMy uncle was a German, having married my mother's sister, an\nEnglishwoman. Being very much attached to his fatherless nephew, he\ninvited me to study under him in his home in the fatherland. This home\nwas in a large town, and my uncle a professor of philosophy, chemistry,\ngeology, mineralogy, and many other ologies.\n\nOne day, after passing some hours in the laboratory--my uncle being\nabsent at the time--I suddenly felt the necessity of renovating the\ntissues--<i>i.e.</i>, I was hungry, and was about to rouse up our old French\ncook, when my uncle, Professor Von Hardwigg, suddenly opened the street\ndoor, and came rushing upstairs.\n\nNow Professor Hardwigg, my worthy uncle, is by no means a bad sort of\nman; he is, however, choleric and original. To bear with him means to\nobey; and scarcely had his heavy feet resounded within our joint\ndomicile than he shouted for me to attend upon him.\n\n\"Harry--Harry--Harry--\"\n\nI hastened to obey, but before I could reach his room, jumping three\nsteps at a time, he was stamping his right foot upon the landing.\n\n\"Harry!\" he cried, in a frantic tone, \"are you coming up?\"\n\nNow to tell the truth, at that moment I was far more interested in the\nquestion as to what was to constitute our dinner than in any problem of\nscience; to me soup was more interesting than soda, an omelette more\ntempting than arithmetic, and an artichoke of ten times more value than\nany amount of asbestos.\n\nBut my uncle was not a man to be kept waiting; so adjourning therefore\nall minor questions, I presented myself before him.\n\nHe was a very learned man. Now most persons in this category supply\nthemselves with information, as peddlers do with goods, for the benefit\nof others, and lay up stores in order to diffuse them abroad for the\nbenefit of society in general. Not so my excellent uncle, Professor\nHardwigg; he studied, he consumed the midnight oil, he pored over heavy\ntomes, and digested huge quartos and folios in order to keep the\nknowledge acquired to himself.\n\nThere was a reason, and it may be regarded as a good one, why my uncle\nobjected to display his learning more than was absolutely necessary: he\nstammered; and when intent upon explaining the phenomena of the heavens,\nwas apt to find himself at fault, and allude in such a vague way to sun,\nmoon, and stars that few were able to comprehend his meaning. To tell\nthe honest truth, when the right word would not come, it was generally\nreplaced by a very powerful adjective.\n\nIn connection with the sciences there are many almost unpronounceable\nnames--names very much resembling those of Welsh villages; and my uncle\nbeing very fond of using them, his habit of stammering was not thereby\nimproved. In fact, there were periods in his discourse when he would\nfinally give up and swallow his discomfiture--in a glass of water.\n\nAs I said, my uncle, Professor Hardwigg, was a very learned man; and I\nnow add a most kind relative. I was bound to him by the double ties of\naffection and interest. I took deep interest in all his doings, and\nhoped some day to be almost as learned myself. It was a rare thing for\nme to be absent from his lectures. Like him, I preferred mineralogy to\nall the other sciences. My anxiety was to gain real <i>knowledge of the\nearth</i>. Geology and mineralogy were to us the sole objects of life, and\nin connection with these studies many a fair specimen of stone, chalk,\nor metal did we break with our hammers.\n\nSteel rods, loadstones, glass pipes, and bottles of various acids were\noftener before us than our meals. My uncle Hardwigg was once known to\nclassify six hundred different geological specimens by their weight,\nhardness, fusibility, sound, taste, and smell.\n\nHe corresponded with all the great, learned, and scientific men of the\nage. I was, therefore, in constant communication with, at all events the\nletters of, Sir Humphry Davy, Captain Franklin, and other great men.\n\nBut before I state the subject on which my uncle wished to confer with\nme, I must say a word about his personal appearance. Alas! my readers\nwill see a very different portrait of him at a future time, after he has\ngone through the fearful adventures yet to be related.\n\nMy uncle was fifty years old; tall, thin, and wiry. Large spectacles\nhid, to a certain extent, his vast, round, and goggle eyes, while his\nnose was irreverently compared to a thin file. So much indeed did it\nresemble that useful article, that a compass was said in his presence to\nhave made considerable N (Nasal) deviation.\n\nThe truth being told, however, the only article really attracted to my\nuncle's nose was tobacco.\n\nAnother peculiarity of his was, that he always stepped a yard at a time,\nclenched his fists as if he were going to hit you, and was, when in one\nof his peculiar humors, very far from a pleasant companion.\n\nIt is further necessary to observe that he lived in a very nice house,\nin that very nice street, the Konigstrasse at Hamburg. Though lying in\nthe centre of a town, it was perfectly rural in its aspect--half wood,\nhalf bricks, with old-fashioned gables--one of the few old houses spared\nby the great fire of 1842.\n\nWhen I say a nice house, I mean a handsome house--old, tottering, and\nnot exactly comfortable to English notions: a house a little off the\nperpendicular and inclined to fall into the neighboring canal; exactly\nthe house for a wandering artist to depict; all the more that you could\nscarcely see it for ivy and a magnificent old tree which grew over the\ndoor.\n\nMy uncle was rich; his house was his own property, while he had a\nconsiderable private income. To my notion the best part of his\npossessions was his god-daughter, Gretchen. And the old cook, the young\nlady, the Professor and I were the sole inhabitants.\n\nI loved mineralogy, I loved geology. To me there was nothing like\npebbles--and if my uncle had been in a little less of a fury, we should\nhave been the happiest of families. To prove the excellent Hardwigg's\nimpatience, I solemnly declare that when the flowers in the drawing-room\npots began to grow, he rose every morning at four o'clock to make them\ngrow quicker by pulling the leaves!\n\nHaving described my uncle, I will now give an account of our interview.\n\nHe received me in his study; a perfect museum, containing every natural\ncuriosity that can well be imagined--minerals, however, predominating.\nEvery one was familiar to me, having been catalogued by my own hand. My\nuncle, apparently oblivious of the fact that he had summoned me to his\npresence, was absorbed in a book. He was particularly fond of early\neditions, tall copies, and unique works.\n\n\"Wonderful!\" he cried, tapping his forehead. \"Wonderful--wonderful!\"\n\nIt was one of those yellow-leaved volumes now rarely found on stalls,\nand to me it appeared to possess but little value. My uncle, however,\nwas in raptures.\n\nHe admired its binding, the clearness of its characters, the ease with\nwhich it opened in his hand, and repeated aloud, half a dozen times,\nthat it was very, very old.\n\nTo my fancy he was making a great fuss about nothing, but it was not my\nprovince to say so. On the contrary, I professed considerable interest\nin the subject, and asked him what it was about.\n\n\"It is the Heims-Kringla of Snorre Tarleson,\" he said, \"the celebrated\nIcelandic author of the twelfth century--it is a true and correct\naccount of the Norwegian princes who reigned in Iceland.\"\n\nMy next question related to the language in which it was written. I\nhoped at all events it was translated into German. My uncle was\nindignant at the very thought, and declared he wouldn't give a penny for\na translation. His delight was to have found the original work in the\nIcelandic tongue, which he declared to be one of the most magnificent\nand yet simple idioms in the world--while at the same time its\ngrammatical combinations were the most varied known to students.\n\n\"About as easy as German?\" was my insidious remark.\n\nMy uncle shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"The letters at all events,\" I said, \"are rather difficult of\ncomprehension.\"\n\n\"It is a Runic manuscript, the language of the original population of\nIceland, invented by Odin himself,\" cried my uncle, angry at my\nignorance.\n\nI was about to venture upon some misplaced joke on the subject, when a\nsmall scrap of parchment fell out of the leaves. Like a hungry man\nsnatching at a morsel of bread the Professor seized it. It was about\nfive inches by three and was scrawled over in the most extraordinary\nfashion.\n\nThe lines shown here are an exact facsimile of what was written on the\nvenerable piece of parchment--and have wonderful importance, as they\ninduced my uncle to undertake the most wonderful series of adventures\nwhich ever fell to the lot of human beings.\n\nMy uncle looked keenly at the document for some moments and then\ndeclared that it was Runic. The letters were similar to those in the\nbook, but then what did they mean? This was exactly what I wanted to\nknow.\n\nNow as I had a strong conviction that the Runic alphabet and dialect\nwere simply an invention to mystify poor human nature, I was delighted\nto find that my uncle knew as much about the matter as I did--which was\nnothing. At all events the tremulous motion of his fingers made me think\nso.\n\n\"And yet,\" he muttered to himself, \"it is old Icelandic, I am sure of\nit.\"\n\nAnd my uncle ought to have known, for he was a perfect polyglot\ndictionary in himself. He did not pretend, like a certain learned\npundit, to speak the two thousand languages and four thousand idioms\nmade use of in different parts of the globe, but he did know all the\nmore important ones.\n\nIt is a matter of great doubt to me now, to what violent measures my\nuncle's impetuosity might have led him, had not the clock struck two,\nand our old French cook called out to let us know that dinner was on the\ntable.\n\n\"Bother the dinner!\" cried my uncle.\n\nBut as I was hungry, I sallied forth to the dining room, where I took up\nmy usual quarters. Out of politeness I waited three minutes, but no sign\nof my uncle, the Professor. I was surprised. He was not usually so blind\nto the pleasure of a good dinner. It was the acme of German\nluxury--parsley soup, a ham omelette with sorrel trimmings, an oyster of\nveal stewed with prunes, delicious fruit, and sparkling Moselle. For the\nsake of poring over this musty old piece of parchment, my uncle forbore\nto share our meal. To satisfy my conscience, I ate for both.\n\nThe old cook and housekeeper was nearly out of her mind. After taking so\nmuch trouble, to find her master not appear at dinner was to her a sad\ndisappointment--which, as she occasionally watched the havoc I was\nmaking on the viands, became also alarm. If my uncle were to come to\ntable after all?\n\nSuddenly, just as I had consumed the last apple and drunk the last glass\nof wine, a terrible voice was heard at no great distance. It was my\nuncle roaring for me to come to him. I made very nearly one leap of\nit--so loud, so fierce was his tone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nTHE MYSTERIOUS PARCHMENT\n\n\n[Illustration: Runic Glyphs]\n\n\"I Declare,\" cried my uncle, striking the table fiercely with his fist,\n\"I declare to you it is Runic--and contains some wonderful secret, which\nI must get at, at any price.\"\n\nI was about to reply when he stopped me.\n\n\"Sit down,\" he said, quite fiercely, \"and write to my dictation.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"I will substitute,\" he said, \"a letter of our alphabet for that of the\nRunic: we will then see what that will produce. Now, begin and make no\nmistakes.\"\n\nThe dictation commenced with the following incomprehensible result:\n\n\n     mm.rnlls esruel seecJde\n     sgtssmf unteief niedrke\n     kt,samn atrateS Saodrrn\n     emtnaeI nuaect  rrilSa\n     Atvaar  .nscrc  ieaabs\n     ccdrmi  eeutul  frantu\n     dt,iac  oseibo  KediiY\n\n\nScarcely giving me time to finish, my uncle snatched the document from\nmy hands and examined it with the most rapt and deep attention.\n\n\"I should like to know what it means,\" he said, after a long period.\n\nI certainly could not tell him, nor did he expect me to--his\nconversation being uniformly answered by himself.\n\n\"I declare it puts me in mind of a cryptograph,\" he cried, \"unless,\nindeed, the letters have been written without any real meaning; and yet\nwhy take so much trouble? Who knows but I may be on the verge of some\ngreat discovery?\"\n\nMy candid opinion was that it was all rubbish! But this opinion I kept\ncarefully to myself, as my uncle's choler was not pleasant to bear. All\nthis time he was comparing the book with the parchment.\n\n\"The manuscript volume and the smaller document are written in different\nhands,\" he said, \"the cryptograph is of much later date than the book;\nthere is an undoubted proof of the correctness of my surmise. [An\nirrefragable proof I took it to be.] The first letter is a double M,\nwhich was only added to the Icelandic language in the twelfth\ncentury--this makes the parchment two hundred years posterior to the\nvolume.\"\n\nThe circumstances appeared very probable and very logical, but it was\nall surmise to me.\n\n\"To me it appears probable that this sentence was written by some owner\nof the book. Now who was the owner, is the next important question.\nPerhaps by great good luck it may be written somewhere in the volume.\"\n\nWith these words Professor Hardwigg took off his spectacles, and, taking\na powerful magnifying glass, examined the book carefully.\n\nOn the fly leaf was what appeared to be a blot of ink, but on\nexamination proved to be a line of writing almost effaced by time. This\nwas what he sought; and, after some considerable time, he made out these\nletters:\n\n[Illustration: Runic Glyphs]\n\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" he cried in a joyous and triumphant tone, \"that is\nnot only an Icelandic name, but of a learned professor of the sixteenth\ncentury, a celebrated alchemist.\"\n\nI bowed as a sign of respect.\n\n\"These alchemists,\" he continued, \"Avicenna, Bacon, Lully, Paracelsus,\nwere the true, the only learned men of the day. They made surprising\ndiscoveries. May not this Saknussemm, nephew mine, have hidden on this\nbit of parchment some astounding invention? I believe the cryptograph to\nhave a profound meaning--which I must make out.\"\n\nMy uncle walked about the room in a state of excitement almost\nimpossible to describe.\n\n\"It may be so, sir,\" I timidly observed, \"but why conceal it from\nposterity, if it be a useful, a worthy discovery?\"\n\n\"Why--how should I know? Did not Galileo make a secret of his\ndiscoveries in connection with Saturn? But we shall see. Until I\ndiscover the meaning of this sentence I will neither eat nor sleep.\"\n\n\"My dear uncle--\" I began.\n\n\"Nor you neither,\" he added.\n\nIt was lucky I had taken double allowance that day.\n\n\"In the first place,\" he continued, \"there must be a clue to the\nmeaning. If we could find that, the rest would be easy enough.\"\n\nI began seriously to reflect. The prospect of going without food and\nsleep was not a promising one, so I determined to do my best to solve\nthe mystery. My uncle, meanwhile, went on with his soliloquy.\n\n\"The way to discover it is easy enough. In this document there are one\nhundred and thirty-two letters, giving seventy-nine consonants to\nfifty-three vowels. This is about the proportion found in most southern\nlanguages, the idioms of the north being much more rich in consonants.\nWe may confidently predict, therefore, that we have to deal with a\nsouthern dialect.\"\n\nNothing could be more logical.\n\n\"Now,\" said Professor Hardwigg, \"to trace the particular language.\"\n\n\"As Shakespeare says, 'that is the question,\"' was my rather satirical\nreply.\n\n\"This man Saknussemm,\" he continued, \"was a very learned man: now as he\ndid not write in the language of his birthplace, he probably, like most\nlearned men of the sixteenth century, wrote in Latin. If, however, I\nprove wrong in this guess, we must try Spanish, French, Italian, Greek,\nand even Hebrew. My own opinion, though, is decidedly in favor of\nLatin.\"\n\nThis proposition startled me. Latin was my favorite study, and it seemed\nsacrilege to believe this gibberish to belong to the country of Virgil.\n\n\"Barbarous Latin, in all probability,\" continued my uncle, \"but still\nLatin.\"\n\n\"Very probably,\" I replied, not to contradict him.\n\n\"Let us see into the matter,\" continued my uncle; \"here you see we have\na series of one hundred and thirty-two letters, apparently thrown\npell-mell upon paper, without method or organization. There are words\nwhich are composed wholly of consonants, such as <i>mm.rnlls</i>, others\nwhich are nearly all vowels, the fifth, for instance, which is unteief,\nand one of the last oseibo. This appears an extraordinary combination.\nProbably we shall find that the phrase is arranged according to some\nmathematical plan. No doubt a certain sentence has been written out and\nthen jumbled up--some plan to which some figure is the clue. Now, Harry,\nto show your English wit--what is that figure?\"\n\nI could give him no hint. My thoughts were indeed far away. While he was\nspeaking I had caught sight of the portrait of my cousin Gretchen, and\nwas wondering when she would return.\n\nWe were affianced, and loved one another very sincerely. But my uncle,\nwho never thought even of such sublunary matters, knew nothing of this.\nWithout noticing my abstraction, the Professor began reading the\npuzzling cryptograph all sorts of ways, according to some theory of his\nown. Presently, rousing my wandering attention, he dictated one precious\nattempt to me.\n\nI mildly handed it over to him. It read as follows:\n\n\n    <i>mmessunkaSenrA.icefdoK.segnittamurtn\n    ecertserrette,rotaivsadua,ednecsedsadne\n    lacartniiilrJsiratracSarbmutabiledmek\n    meretarcsilucoYsleffenSnI.</i>\n\n\nI could scarcely keep from laughing, while my uncle, on the contrary,\ngot in a towering passion, struck the table with his fist, darted out of\nthe room, out of the house, and then taking to his heels was presently\nlost to sight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nAN ASTOUNDING DISCOVERY\n\n\n\"What is the matter?\" cried the cook, entering the room; \"when will\nmaster have his dinner?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"And, his supper?\"\n\n\"I don't know. He says he will eat no more, neither shall I. My uncle\nhas determined to fast and make me fast until he makes out this\nabominable inscription,\" I replied.\n\n\"You will be starved to death,\" she said.\n\nI was very much of the same opinion, but not liking to say so, sent her\naway, and began some of my usual work of classification. But try as I\nmight, nothing could keep me from thinking alternately of the stupid\nmanuscript and of the pretty Gretchen.\n\nSeveral times I thought of going out, but my uncle would have been angry\nat my absence. At the end of an hour, my allotted task was done. How to\npass the time? I began by lighting my pipe. Like all other students, I\ndelighted in tobacco; and, seating myself in the great armchair, I began\nto think.\n\nWhere was my uncle? I could easily imagine him tearing along some\nsolitary road, gesticulating, talking to himself, cutting the air with\nhis cane, and still thinking of the absurd bit of hieroglyphics. Would\nhe hit upon some clue? Would he come home in better humor? While these\nthoughts were passing through my brain, I mechanically took up the\nexecrable puzzle and tried every imaginable way of grouping the letters.\nI put them together by twos, by threes, fours, and fives--in vain.\nNothing intelligible came out, except that the fourteenth, fifteenth,\nand sixteenth made <i>ice</i> in English; the eighty-fourth, eighty-fifth,\nand eighty-sixth, the word <i>sir</i>; then at last I seemed to find the\nLatin words <i>rota, mutabile, ira, nec, atra</i>.\n\n\"Ha! there seems to be some truth in my uncle's notion,\" thought I.\n\nThen again I seemed to find the word <i>luco</i>, which means sacred wood.\nThen in the third line I appeared to make out <i>labiled</i>, a perfect\nHebrew word, and at the last the syllables mere, are, mer, which were\nFrench.\n\nIt was enough to drive one mad. Four different idioms in this absurd\nphrase. What connection could there be between ice, sir, anger, cruel,\nsacred wood, changing, mother, are, and sea? The first and the last\nmight, in a sentence connected with Iceland, mean sea of ice. But what\nof the rest of this monstrous cryptograph?\n\nI was, in fact, fighting against an insurmountable difficulty; my brain\nwas almost on fire; my eyes were strained with staring at the parchment;\nthe whole absurd collection of letters appeared to dance before my\nvision in a number of black little groups. My mind was possessed with\ntemporary hallucination--I was stifling. I wanted air. Mechanically I\nfanned myself with the document, of which now I saw the back and then\nthe front.\n\nImagine my surprise when glancing at the back of the wearisome puzzle,\nthe ink having gone through, I clearly made out Latin words, and among\nothers craterem and terrestre.\n\nI had discovered the secret!\n\nIt came upon me like a flash of lightning. I had got the clue. All you\nhad to do to understand the document was to read it backwards. All the\ningenious ideas of the Professor were realized; he had dictated it\nrightly to me; by a mere accident I had discovered what he so much\ndesired.\n\nMy delight, my emotion may be imagined, my eyes were dazzled and I\ntrembled so that at first I could make nothing of it. One look, however,\nwould tell me all I wished to know.\n\n\"Let me read,\" I said to myself, after drawing a long breath.\n\nI spread it before me on the table, I passed my finger over each letter,\nI spelled it through; in my excitement I read it out.\n\nWhat horror and stupefaction took possession of my soul. I was like a\nman who had received a knock-down blow. Was it possible that I really\nread the terrible secret, and it had really been accomplished! A man had\ndared to do--what?\n\nNo living being should ever know.\n\n\"Never!\" cried I, jumping up. \"Never shall my uncle be made aware of the\ndread secret. He would be quite capable of undertaking the terrible\njourney. Nothing would check him, nothing stop him. Worse, he would\ncompel me to accompany him, and we should be lost forever. But no; such\nfolly and madness cannot be allowed.\"\n\nI was almost beside myself with rage and fury.\n\n\"My worthy uncle is already nearly mad,\" I cried aloud. \"This would\nfinish him. By some accident he may make the discovery; in which case,\nwe are both lost. Perish the fearful secret--let the flames forever bury\nit in oblivion.\"\n\nI snatched up book and parchment, and was about to cast them into the\nfire, when the door opened and my uncle entered.\n\nI had scarcely time to put down the wretched documents before my uncle\nwas by my side. He was profoundly absorbed. His thoughts were evidently\nbent on the terrible parchment. Some new combination had probably struck\nhim while taking his walk.\n\nHe seated himself in his armchair, and with a pen began to make an\nalgebraical calculation. I watched him with anxious eyes. My flesh\ncrawled as it became probable that he would discover the secret.\n\nHis combinations I knew now were useless, I having discovered the one\nonly clue. For three mortal hours he continued without speaking a word,\nwithout raising his head, scratching, rewriting, calculating over and\nover again. I knew that in time he must hit upon the right phrase. The\nletters of every alphabet have only a certain number of combinations.\nBut then years might elapse before he would arrive at the correct\nsolution.\n\nStill time went on; night came, the sounds in the streets ceased--and\nstill my uncle went on, not even answering our worthy cook when she\ncalled us to supper.\n\nI did not dare to leave him, so waved her away, and at last fell asleep\non the sofa.\n\nWhen I awoke my uncle was still at work. His red eyes, his pallid\ncountenance, his matted hair, his feverish hands, his hectically flushed\ncheeks, showed how terrible had been his struggle with the impossible,\nand what fearful fatigue he had undergone during that long sleepless\nnight. It made me quite ill to look at him. Though he was rather severe\nwith me, I loved him, and my heart ached at his sufferings. He was so\novercome by one idea that he could not even get in a passion! All his\nenergies were focused on one point. And I knew that by speaking one\nlittle word all this suffering would cease. I could not speak it.\n\nMy heart was, nevertheless, inclining towards him. Why, then, did I\nremain silent? In the interest of my uncle himself.\n\n\"Nothing shall make me speak,\" I muttered. \"He will want to follow in\nthe footsteps of the other! I know him well. His imagination is a\nperfect volcano, and to make discoveries in the interests of geology he\nwould sacrifice his life. I will therefore be silent and strictly keep\nthe secret I have discovered. To reveal it would be suicidal. He would\nnot only rush, himself, to destruction, but drag me with him.\"\n\nI crossed my arms, looked another way and smoked--resolved never to\nspeak.\n\nWhen our cook wanted to go out to market, or on any other errand, she\nfound the front door locked and the key taken away. Was this done\npurposely or not? Surely Professor Hardwigg did not intend the old woman\nand myself to become martyrs to his obstinate will. Were we to be\nstarved to death? A frightful recollection came to my mind. Once we had\nfed on bits and scraps for a week while he sorted some curiosities. It\ngave me the cramp even to think of it!\n\nI wanted my breakfast, and I saw no way of getting it. Still my\nresolution held good. I would starve rather than yield. But the cook\nbegan to take me seriously to task. What was to be done? She could not\ngo out; and I dared not.\n\nMy uncle continued counting and writing; his imagination seemed to have\ntranslated him to the skies. He neither thought of eating nor drinking.\nIn this way twelve o'clock came round. I was hungry, and there was\nnothing in the house. The cook had eaten the last bit of bread. This\ncould not go on. It did, however, until two, when my sensations were\nterrible. After all, I began to think the document very absurd. Perhaps\nit might only be a gigantic hoax. Besides, some means would surely be\nfound to keep my uncle back from attempting any such absurd expedition.\nOn the other hand, if he did attempt anything so quixotic, I should not\nbe compelled to accompany him. Another line of reasoning partially\ndecided me. Very likely he would make the discovery himself when I\nshould have suffered starvation for nothing. Under the influence of\nhunger this reasoning appeared admirable. I determined to tell all.\n\nThe question now arose as to how it was to be done. I was still dwelling\non the thought, when he rose and put on his hat.\n\nWhat! go out and lock us in? Never!\n\n\"Uncle,\" I began.\n\nHe did not appear even to hear me.\n\n\"Professor Hardwigg,\" I cried.\n\n\"What,\" he retorted, \"did you speak?\"\n\n\"How about the key?\"\n\n\"What key--the key of the door?\"\n\n\"No--of these horrible hieroglyphics?\"\n\nHe looked at me from under his spectacles, and started at the odd\nexpression of my face. Rushing forward, he clutched me by the arm and\nkeenly examined my countenance. His very look was an interrogation.\n\nI simply nodded.\n\nWith an incredulous shrug of the shoulders, he turned upon his heel.\nUndoubtedly he thought I had gone mad.\n\n\"I have made a very important discovery.\"\n\nHis eyes flashed with excitement. His hand was lifted in a menacing\nattitude. For a moment neither of us spoke. It is hard to say which was\nmost excited.\n\n\"You don't mean to say that you have any idea of the meaning of the\nscrawl?\"\n\n\"I do,\" was my desperate reply. \"Look at the sentence as dictated by\nyou.\"\n\n\"Well, but it means nothing,\" was the angry answer.\n\n\"Nothing if you read from left to right, but mark, if from right to\nleft--\"\n\n\"Backwards!\" cried my uncle, in wild amazement. \"Oh most cunning\nSaknussemm; and I to be such a blockhead!\"\n\nHe snatched up the document, gazed at it with haggard eye, and read it\nout as I had done.\n\nIt read as follows:\n\n\n    <i>In Sneffels Yoculis craterem kem delibat\n    umbra Scartaris Julii intra calendas descende,\n    audas viator, et terrestre centrum attinges.\n    Kod feci. Arne Saknussemm</i>\n\n\nWhich dog Latin being translated, reads as follows:\n\n\n     Descend into the crater of Yocul of Sneffels, which the shade of\n     Scartaris caresses, before the kalends of July, audacious traveler,\n     and you will reach the centre of the earth. I did it.\n\n                                               ARNE SAKNUSSEMM\n\n\nMy uncle leaped three feet from the ground with joy. He looked radiant\nand handsome. He rushed about the room wild with delight and\nsatisfaction. He knocked over tables and chairs. He threw his books\nabout until at last, utterly exhausted, he fell into his armchair.\n\n\"What's o'clock?\" he asked.\n\n\"About three.\"\n\n\"My dinner does not seem to have done me much good,\" he observed. \"Let\nme have something to eat. We can then start at once. Get my portmanteau\nready.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"And your own,\" he continued. \"We start at once.\"\n\nMy horror may be conceived. I resolved however to show no fear.\nScientific reasons were the only ones likely to influence my uncle. Now,\nthere were many against this terrible journey. The very idea of going\ndown to the centre of the earth was simply absurd. I determined\ntherefore to argue the point after dinner.\n\nMy uncle's rage was now directed against the cook for having no dinner\nready. My explanation however satisfied him, and having gotten the key,\nshe soon contrived to get sufficient to satisfy our voracious appetites.\n\nDuring the repast my uncle was rather gay than otherwise. He made some\nof those peculiar jokes which belong exclusively to the learned. As\nsoon, however, as dessert was over, he called me to his study. We each\ntook a chair on opposite sides of the table.\n\n\"Henry,\" he said, in a soft and winning voice; \"I have always believed\nyou ingenious, and you have rendered me a service never to be forgotten.\nWithout you, this great, this wondrous discovery would never have been\nmade. It is my duty, therefore, to insist on your sharing the glory.\"\n\n\"He is in a good humor,\" thought I; \"I'll soon let him know my opinion\nof glory.\"\n\n\"In the first place,\" he continued, \"you must keep the whole affair a\nprofound secret. There is no more envious race of men than scientific\ndiscoverers. Many would start on the same journey. At all events, we\nwill be the first in the field.\"\n\n\"I doubt your having many competitors,\" was my reply.\n\n\"A man of real scientific acquirements would be delighted at the chance.\nWe should find a perfect stream of pilgrims on the traces of Arne\nSaknussemm, if this document were once made public.\"\n\n\"But, my dear sir, is not this paper very likely to be a hoax?\" I urged.\n\n\"The book in which we find it is sufficient proof of its authenticity,\"\nhe replied.\n\n\"I thoroughly allow that the celebrated Professor wrote the lines, but\nonly, I believe, as a kind of mystification,\" was my answer.\n\nScarcely were the words out of my mouth, when I was sorry I had uttered\nthem. My uncle looked at me with a dark and gloomy scowl, and I began to\nbe alarmed for the results of our conversation. His mood soon changed,\nhowever, and a smile took the place of a frown.\n\n\"We shall see,\" he remarked, with decisive emphasis.\n\n\"But see, what is all this about Yocul, and Sneffels, and this\nScartaris? I have never heard anything about them.\"\n\n\"The very point to which I am coming. I lately received from my friend\nAugustus Peterman, of Leipzig, a map. Take down the third atlas from the\nsecond shelf, series Z, plate 4.\"\n\nI rose, went to the shelf, and presently returned with the volume\nindicated.\n\n\"This,\" said my uncle, \"is one of the best maps of Iceland. I believe it\nwill settle all your doubts, difficulties and objections.\"\n\nWith a grim hope to the contrary, I stooped over the map.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nWE START ON THE JOURNEY\n\n\n\"You see, the whole island is composed of volcanoes,\" said the\nProfessor, \"and remark carefully that they all bear the name of Yocul.\nThe word is Icelandic, and means a glacier. In most of the lofty\nmountains of that region the volcanic eruptions come forth from icebound\ncaverns. Hence the name applied to every volcano on this extraordinary\nisland.\"\n\n\"But what does this word Sneffels mean?\"\n\nTo this question I expected no rational answer. I was mistaken.\n\n\"Follow my finger to the western coast of Iceland, there you see\nReykjavik, its capital. Follow the direction of one of its innumerable\nfjords or arms of the sea, and what do you see below the sixty-fifth\ndegree of latitude?\"\n\n\"A peninsula--very like a thighbone in shape.\"\n\n\"And in the centre of it--?\"\n\n\"A mountain.\"\n\n\"Well, that's Sneffels.\"\n\nI had nothing to say.\n\n\"That is Sneffels--a mountain about five thousand feet in height, one of\nthe most remarkable in the whole island, and certainly doomed to be the\nmost celebrated in the world, for through its crater we shall reach the\ncentre of the earth.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" cried I, startled and shocked at the thought.\n\n\"Why impossible?\" said Professor Hardwigg in his severest tones.\n\n\"Because its crater is choked with lava, by burning rocks--by infinite\ndangers.\"\n\n\"But if it be extinct?\"\n\n\"That would make a difference.\"\n\n\"Of course it would. There are about three hundred volcanoes on the\nwhole surface of the globe--but the greater number are extinct. Of these\nSneffels is one. No eruption has occurred since 1219--in fact it has\nceased to be a volcano at all.\"\n\nAfter this what more could I say? Yes,--I thought of another objection.\n\n\"But what is all this about Scartaris and the kalends of July--?\"\n\nMy uncle reflected deeply. Presently he gave forth the result of his\nreflections in a sententious tone. \"What appears obscure to you, to me\nis light. This very phrase shows how particular Saknussemm is in his\ndirections. The Sneffels mountain has many craters. He is careful\ntherefore to point the exact one which is the highway into the Interior\nof the Earth. He lets us know, for this purpose, that about the end of\nthe month of June, the shadow of Mount Scartaris falls upon the one\ncrater. There can be no doubt about the matter.\"\n\nMy uncle had an answer for everything.\n\n\"I accept all your explanations\" I said, \"and Saknussemm is right. He\nfound out the entrance to the bowels of the earth, he has indicated\ncorrectly, but that he or anyone else ever followed up the discovery is\nmadness to suppose.\"\n\n\"Why so, young man?\"\n\n\"All scientific teaching, theoretical and practical, shows it to be\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"I care nothing for theories,\" retorted my uncle.\n\n\"But is it not well-known that heat increases one degree for every\nseventy feet you descend into the earth? Which gives a fine idea of the\ncentral heat. All the matters which compose the globe are in a state of\nincandescence; even gold, platinum, and the hardest rocks are in a state\nof fusion. What would become of us?\"\n\n\"Don't be alarmed at the heat, my boy.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Neither you nor anybody else know anything about the real state of the\nearth's interior. All modern experiments tend to explode the older\ntheories. Were any such heat to exist, the upper crust of the earth\nwould be shattered to atoms, and the world would be at an end.\"\n\nA long, learned and not uninteresting discussion followed, which ended\nin this wise:\n\n\"I do not believe in the dangers and difficulties which you, Henry, seem\nto multiply; and the only way to learn, is like Arne Saknussemm, to go\nand see.\"\n\n\"Well,\" cried I, overcome at last, \"let us go and see. Though how we can\ndo that in the dark is another mystery.\"\n\n\"Fear nothing. We shall overcome these, and many other difficulties.\nBesides, as we approach the centre, I expect to find it luminous--\"\n\n\"Nothing is impossible.\"\n\n\"And now that we have come to a thorough understanding, not a word to\nany living soul. Our success depends on secrecy and dispatch.\"\n\nThus ended our memorable conference, which roused a perfect fever in me.\nLeaving my uncle, I went forth like one possessed. Reaching the banks of\nthe Elbe, I began to think. Was all I had heard really and truly\npossible? Was my uncle in his sober senses, and could the interior of\nthe earth be reached? Was I the victim of a madman, or was he a\ndiscoverer of rare courage and grandeur of conception?\n\nTo a certain extent I was anxious to be off. I was afraid my enthusiasm\nwould cool. I determined to pack up at once. At the end of an hour,\nhowever, on my way home, I found that my feelings had very much changed.\n\n\"I'm all abroad,\" I cried; \"'tis a nightmare--I must have dreamed it.\"\n\nAt this moment I came face to face with Gretchen, whom I warmly\nembraced.\n\n\"So you have come to meet me,\" she said; \"how good of you. But what is\nthe matter?\"\n\nWell, it was no use mincing the matter, I told her all. She listened\nwith awe, and for some minutes she could not speak.\n\n\"Well?\" I at last said, rather anxiously.\n\n\"What a magnificent journey. If I were only a man! A journey worthy of\nthe nephew of Professor Hardwigg. I should look upon it as an honor to\naccompany him.\"\n\n\"My dear Gretchen, I thought you would be the first to cry out against\nthis mad enterprise.\"\n\n\"No; on the contrary, I glory in it. It is magnificent, splendid--an\nidea worthy of my father. Henry Lawson, I envy you.\"\n\nThis was, as it were, conclusive. The final blow of all.\n\nWhen we entered the house we found my uncle surrounded by workmen and\nporters, who were packing up. He was pulling and hauling at a bell.\n\n\"Where have you been wasting your time? Your portmanteau is not\npacked--my papers are not in order--the precious tailor has not brought\nmy clothes, nor my gaiters--the key of my carpet bag is gone!\"\n\nI looked at him stupefied. And still he tugged away at the bell.\n\n\"We are really off, then?\" I said.\n\n\"Yes--of course, and yet you go out for a stroll, unfortunate boy!\"\n\n\"And when do we go?\"\n\n\"The day after tomorrow, at daybreak.\"\n\nI heard no more; but darted off to my little bedchamber and locked\nmyself in. There was no doubt about it now. My uncle had been hard at\nwork all the afternoon. The garden was full of ropes, rope ladders,\ntorches, gourds, iron clamps, crowbars, alpenstocks, and\npickaxes--enough to load ten men.\n\nI passed a terrible night. I was called early the next day to learn that\nthe resolution of my uncle was unchanged and irrevocable. I also found\nmy cousin and affianced wife as warm on the subject as was her father.\n\nNext day, at five o'clock in the morning, the post chaise was at the\ndoor. Gretchen and the old cook received the keys of the house; and,\nscarcely pausing to wish anyone good-by, we started on our adventurous\njourney into the centre of the earth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nFirst Lessons in Climbing\n\n\nAt Altona, a suburb of Hamburg, is the Chief Station of the Kiel\nrailway, which was to take us to the shores of the Belt. In twenty\nminutes from the moment of our departure we were in Holstein, and our\ncarriage entered the station. Our heavy luggage was taken out, weighed,\nlabeled, and placed in a huge van. We then took our tickets, and exactly\nat seven o'clock were seated opposite each other in a firstclass railway\ncarriage.\n\nMy uncle said nothing. He was too busy examining his papers, among which\nof course was the famous parchment, and some letters of introduction\nfrom the Danish consul which were to pave the way to an introduction to\nthe Governor of Iceland. My only amusement was looking out of the\nwindow. But as we passed through a flat though fertile country, this\noccupation was slightly monotonous. In three hours we reached Kiel, and\nour baggage was at once transferred to the steamer.\n\nWe had now a day before us, a delay of about ten hours. Which fact put\nmy uncle in a towering passion. We had nothing to do but to walk about\nthe pretty town and bay. At length, however, we went on board, and at\nhalf past ten were steaming down the Great Belt. It was a dark night,\nwith a strong breeze and a rough sea, nothing being visible but the\noccasional fires on shore, with here and there a lighthouse. At seven in\nthe morning we left Korsor, a little town on the western side of\nSeeland.\n\nHere we took another railway, which in three hours brought us to the\ncapital, Copenhagen, where, scarcely taking time for refreshment, my\nuncle hurried out to present one of his letters of introduction. It was\nto the director of the Museum of Antiquities, who, having been informed\nthat we were tourists bound for Iceland, did all he could to assist us.\nOne wretched hope sustained me now. Perhaps no vessel was bound for such\ndistant parts.\n\nAlas! a little Danish schooner, the <i>Valkyrie</i>, was to sail on the\nsecond of June for Reykjavik. The captain, M. Bjarne, was on board, and\nwas rather surprised at the energy and cordiality with which his future\npassenger shook him by the hand. To him a voyage to Iceland was merely a\nmatter of course. My uncle, on the other hand, considered the event of\nsublime importance. The honest sailor took advantage of the Professor's\nenthusiasm to double the fare.\n\n\"On Tuesday morning at seven o'clock be on board,\" said M. Bjarne,\nhanding us our receipts.\n\n\"Excellent! Capital! Glorious!\" remarked my uncle as we sat down to a\nlate breakfast; \"refresh yourself, my boy, and we will take a run\nthrough the town.\"\n\nOur meal concluded, we went to the Kongens-Nye-Torw; to the king's\nmagnificent palace; to the beautiful bridge over the canal near the\nMuseum; to the immense cenotaph of Thorwaldsen with its hideous naval\ngroups; to the castle of Rosenberg; and to all the other lions of the\nplace-none of which my uncle even saw, so absorbed was he in his\nanticipated triumphs.\n\nBut one thing struck his fancy, and that was a certain singular steeple\nsituated on the Island of Amak, which is the southeast quarter of the\ncity of Copenhagen. My uncle at once ordered me to turn my steps that\nway, and accordingly we went on board the steam ferry boat which does\nduty on the canal, and very soon reached the noted dockyard quay.\n\nIn the first instance we crossed some narrow streets, where we met\nnumerous groups of galley slaves, with particolored trousers, grey and\nyellow, working under the orders and the sticks of severe taskmasters,\nand finally reached the Vor-Frelser's-Kirk.\n\nThis church exhibited nothing remarkable in itself; in fact, the worthy\nProfessor had only been attracted to it by one circumstance, which was,\nthat its rather elevated steeple started from a circular platform, after\nwhich there was an exterior staircase, which wound round to the very\nsummit.\n\n\"Let us ascend,\" said my uncle.\n\n\"But I never could climb church towers,\" I cried, \"I am subject to\ndizziness in my head.\"\n\n\"The very reason why you should go up. I want to cure you of a bad\nhabit.\"\n\n\"But, my good sir--\"\n\n\"I tell you to come. What is the use of wasting so much valuable time?\"\n\nIt was impossible to dispute the dictatorial commands of my uncle. I\nyielded with a groan. On payment of a fee, a verger gave us the key. He,\nfor one, was not partial to the ascent. My uncle at once showed me the\nway, running up the steps like a schoolboy. I followed as well as I\ncould, though no sooner was I outside the tower, than my head began to\nswim. There was nothing of the eagle about me. The earth was enough for\nme, and no ambitious desire to soar ever entered my mind. Still things\ndid not go badly until I had ascended 150 steps, and was near the\nplatform, when I began to feel the rush of cold air. I could scarcely\nstand, when clutching the railings, I looked upwards. The railing was\nfrail enough, but nothing to those which skirted the terrible winding\nstaircase, that appeared, from where I stood, to ascend to the skies.\n\n\"Now then, Henry.\"\n\n\"I can't do it!\" I cried, in accents of despair.\n\n\"Are you, after all, a coward, sir?\" said my uncle in a pitiless tone.\n\"Go up, I say!\"\n\nTo this there was no reply possible. And yet the keen air acted\nviolently on my nervous system; sky, earth, all seemed to swim round,\nwhile the steeple rocked like a ship. My legs gave way like those of a\ndrunken man. I crawled upon my hands and knees; I hauled myself up\nslowly, crawling like a snake. Presently I closed my eyes, and allowed\nmyself to be dragged upwards.\n\n\"Look around you,\" said my uncle in a stern voice, \"heaven knows what\nprofound abysses you may have to look down. This is excellent practice.\"\n\nSlowly, and shivering all the while with cold, I opened my eyes. What\nthen did I see? My first glance was upwards at the cold fleecy clouds,\nwhich as by some optical delusion appeared to stand still, while the\nsteeple, the weathercock, and our two selves were carried swiftly along.\nFar away on one side could be seen the grassy plain, while on the other\nlay the sea bathed in translucent light. The Sund, or Sound as we call\nit, could be discovered beyond the point of Elsinore, crowded with white\nsails, which, at that distance looked like the wings of seagulls; while\nto the east could be made out the far-off coast of Sweden. The whole\nappeared a magic panorama.\n\nBut faint and bewildered as I was, there was no remedy for it. Rise and\nstand up I must. Despite my protestations my first lesson lasted quite\nan hour. When, nearly two hours later, I reached the bosom of mother\nearth, I was like a rheumatic old man bent double with pain.\n\n\"Enough for one day,\" said my uncle, rubbing his hands, \"we will begin\nagain tomorrow.\"\n\nThere was no remedy. My lessons lasted five days, and at the end of that\nperiod, I ascended blithely enough, and found myself able to look down\ninto the depths below without even winking, and with some degree of\npleasure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nOur Voyage to Iceland\n\n\nThe hour of departure came at last. The night before, the worthy Mr.\nThompson brought us the most cordial letters of introduction for Baron\nTrampe, Governor of Iceland, for M. Pictursson, coadjutor to the bishop,\nand for M. Finsen, mayor of the town of Reykjavik. In return, my uncle\nnearly crushed his hands, so warmly did he shake them.\n\nOn the second of the month, at two in the morning, our precious cargo of\nluggage was taken on board the good ship <i>Valkyrie</i>. We followed, and\nwere very politely introduced by the captain to a small cabin with two\nstanding bed places, neither very well ventilated nor very comfortable.\nBut in the cause of science men are expected to suffer.\n\n\"Well, and have we a fair wind?\" cried my uncle, in his most mellifluous\naccents.\n\n\"An excellent wind!\" replied Captain Bjarne; \"we shall leave the Sound,\ngoing free with all sails set.\"\n\nA few minutes afterwards, the schooner started before the wind, under\nall the canvas she could carry, and entered the channel. An hour later,\nthe capital of Denmark seemed to sink into the waves, and we were at no\ngreat distance from the coast of Elsinore. My uncle was delighted; for\nmyself, moody and dissatisfied, I appeared almost to expect a glimpse of\nthe ghost of Hamlet.\n\n\"Sublime madman,\" thought I, \"you doubtless would approve our\nproceedings. You might perhaps even follow us to the centre of the\nearth, there to resolve your eternal doubts.\"\n\nBut no ghost or anything else appeared upon the ancient walls. The fact\nis, the castle is much later than the time of the heroic prince of\nDenmark. It is now the residence of the keeper of the Strait of the\nSound, and through that Sound more than fifteen thousand vessels of all\nnations pass every year.\n\nThe castle of Kronborg soon disappeared in the murky atmosphere, as well\nas the tower of Helsinborg, which raises its head on the Swedish Bank.\nAnd here the schooner began to feel in earnest the breezes of the\nKattegat. The <i>Valkyrie</i> was swift enough, but with all sailing boats\nthere is the same uncertainty. Her cargo was coal, furniture, pottery,\nwoolen clothing, and a load of corn. As usual, the crew was small, five\nDanes doing the whole of the work.\n\n\"How long will the voyage last?\" asked my uncle.\n\n\"Well, I should think about ten days,\" replied the skipper, \"unless,\nindeed, we meet with some northeast gales among the Faroe Islands.\"\n\n\"At all events, there will be no very considerable delay,\" cried the\nimpatient Professor.\n\n\"No, Mr. Hardwigg,\" said the captain, \"no fear of that. At all events,\nwe shall get there some day.\"\n\nTowards evening the schooner doubled Cape Skagen, the northernmost part\nof Denmark, crossed the Skagerrak during the night--skirted the extreme\npoint of Norway through the gut of Cape Lindesnes, and then reached the\nNorthern Seas. Two days later we were not far from the coast of\nScotland, somewhere near what Danish sailors call Peterhead, and then\nthe <i>Valkyrie</i> stretched out direct for the Faroe Islands, between\nOrkney and Shetland. Our vessel now felt the full force of the ocean\nwaves, and the wind shifting, we with great difficulty made the Faroe\nIsles. On the eighth day, the captain made out Myganness, the\nwesternmost of the isles, and from that moment headed direct for\nPortland, a cape on the southern shores of the singular island for which\nwe were bound.\n\nThe voyage offered no incident worthy of record. I bore it very well,\nbut my uncle to his great annoyance, and even shame, was remarkably\nseasick! This mal de mer troubled him the more that it prevented him\nfrom questioning Captain Bjarne as to the subject of Sneffels, as to the\nmeans of communication, and the facilities of transport. All these\nexplanations he had to adjourn to the period of his arrival. His time,\nmeanwhile, was spent lying in bed groaning, and dwelling anxiously on\nthe hoped--for termination of the voyage. I didn't pity him.\n\nOn the eleventh day we sighted Cape Portland, over which towered Mount\nMyrdals Yokul, which, the weather being clear, we made out very readily.\nThe cape itself is nothing but a huge mount of granite standing naked\nand alone to meet the Atlantic waves. The <i>Valkyrie</i> kept off the coast,\nsteering to the westward. On all sides were to be seen whole \"schools\"\nof whales and sharks. After some hours we came in sight of a solitary\nrock in the ocean, forming a mighty vault, through which the foaming\nwaves poured with intense fury. The islets of Westman appeared to leap\nfrom the ocean, being so low in the water as scarcely to be seen until\nyou were right upon them. From that moment the schooner was steered to\nthe westward in order to round Cape Reykjanes, the western point of\nIceland.\n\nMy uncle, to his great disgust, was unable even to crawl on deck, so\nheavy a sea was on, and thus lost the first view of the Land of Promise.\nForty-eight hours later, after a storm which drove us far to sea under\nbare poles, we came once more in sight of land, and were boarded by a\npilot, who, after three hours of dangerous navigation, brought the\nschooner safely to an anchor in the bay of Faxa before Reykjavik.\n\nMy uncle came out of his cabin pale, haggard, thin, but full of\nenthusiasm, his eyes dilated with pleasure and satisfaction. Nearly the\nwhole population of the town was on foot to see us land. The fact was,\nthat scarcely any one of them but expected some goods by the periodical\nvessel.\n\nProfessor Hardwigg was in haste to leave his prison, or rather as he\ncalled it, his hospital; but before he attempted to do so, he caught\nhold of my hand, led me to the quarterdeck of the schooner, took my arm\nwith his left hand, and pointed inland with his right, over the northern\npart of the bay, to where rose a high two-peaked mountain--a double cone\ncovered with eternal snow.\n\n\"Behold he whispered in an awe-stricken voice, behold--Mount Sneffels!\"\n\nThen without further remark, he put his finger to his lips, frowned\ndarkly, and descended into the small boat which awaited us. I followed,\nand in a few minutes we stood upon the soil of mysterious Iceland!\n\nScarcely were we fairly on shore when there appeared before us a man of\nexcellent appearance, wearing the costume of a military officer. He was,\nhowever, but a civil servant, a magistrate, the governor of the\nisland--Baron Trampe. The Professor knew whom he had to deal with. He\ntherefore handed him the letters from Copenhagen, and a brief\nconversation in Danish followed, to which I of course was a stranger,\nand for a very good reason, for I did not know the language in which\nthey conversed. I afterwards heard, however, that Baron Trampe placed\nhimself entirely at the beck and call of Professor Hardwigg.\n\nMy uncle was most graciously received by M. Finsen, the mayor, who as\nfar as costume went, was quite as military as the governor, but also\nfrom character and occupation quite as pacific. As for his coadjutor, M.\nPictursson, he was absent on an episcopal visit to the northern portion\nof the diocese. We were therefore compelled to defer the pleasure of\nbeing presented to him. His absence was, however, more than compensated\nby the presence of M. Fridriksson, professor of natural science in the\ncollege of Reykjavik, a man of invaluable ability. This modest scholar\nspoke no languages save Icelandic and Latin. When, therefore, he\naddressed himself to me in the language of Horace, we at once came to\nunderstand one another. He was, in fact, the only person that I did\nthoroughly understand during the whole period of my residence in this\nbenighted island.\n\nOut of three rooms of which his house was composed, two were placed at\nour service, and in a few hours we were installed with all our baggage,\nthe amount of which rather astonished the simple inhabitants of\nReykjavik.\n\n\"Now, Harry,\" said my uncle, rubbing his hands, \"an goes well, the worse\ndifficulty is now over.\"\n\n\"How the worse difficulty over?\" I cried in fresh amazement.\n\n\"Doubtless. Here we are in Iceland. Nothing more remains but to descend\ninto the bowels of the earth.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, to a certain extent you are right. We have only to go\ndown--but, as far as I am concerned, that is not the question. I want to\nknow how we are to get up again.\"\n\n\"That is the least part of the business, and does not in any way trouble\nme. In the meantime, there is not an hour to lose. I am about to visit\nthe public library. Very likely I may find there some manuscripts from\nthe hand of Saknussemm. I shall be glad to consult them.\"\n\n\"In the meanwhile,\" I replied, \"I will take a walk through the town.\nWill you not likewise do so?\"\n\n\"I feel no interest in the subject,\" said my uncle. \"What for me is\ncurious in this island, is not what is above the surface, but what is\nbelow.\"\n\nI bowed by way of reply, put on my hat and furred cloak, and went out.\n\nIt was not an easy matter to lose oneself in the two streets of\nReykjavik; I had therefore no need to ask my way. The town lies on a\nflat and marshy plain, between two hills. A vast field of lava skirts it\non one side, falling away in terraces towards the sea. On the other hand\nis the large bay of Faxa, bordered on the north by the enormous glacier\nof Sneffels, and in which bay the <i>Valkyrie</i> was then the only vessel at\nanchor. Generally there were one or two English or French gunboats, to\nwatch and protect the fisheries in the offing. They were now, however,\nabsent on duty.\n\nThe longest of the streets of Reykjavik runs parallel to the shore. In\nthis street the merchants and traders live in wooden huts made with\nbeams of wood, painted red--mere log huts, such as you find in the wilds\nof America. The other street, situated more to the west, runs toward a\nlittle lake between the residences of the bishop and the other\npersonages not engaged in commerce.\n\nI had soon seen all I wanted of these weary and dismal thoroughfares.\nHere and there was a strip of discolored turf, like an old worn-out bit\nof woolen carpet; and now and then a bit of kitchen garden, in which\ngrew potatoes, cabbage, and lettuce, almost diminutive enough to suggest\nthe idea of Lilliput.\n\nIn the centre of the new commercial street, I found the public cemetery,\nenclosed by an earthen wall. Though not very large, it appeared not\nlikely to be filled for centuries. From hence I went to the house of the\nGovernor--a mere hut in comparison with the Mansion House of\nHamburg--but a palace alongside the other Icelandic houses. Between the\nlittle lake and the town was the church, built in simple Protestant\nstyle, and composed of calcined stones, thrown up by volcanic action. I\nhave not the slightest doubt that in high winds its red tiles were blown\nout, to the great annoyance of the pastor and congregation. Upon an\neminence close at hand was the national school, in which were taught\nHebrew, English, French, and Danish.\n\nIn three hours my tour was complete. The general impression upon my mind\nwas sadness. No trees, no vegetation, so to speak--on all sides volcanic\npeaks--the huts of turf and earth--more like roofs than houses. Thanks\nto the heat of these residences, grass grows on the roof, which grass is\ncarefully cut for hay. I saw but few inhabitants during my excursion,\nbut I met a crowd on the beach, drying, salting and loading codfish, the\nprincipal article of exportation. The men appeared robust but heavy;\nfair-haired like Germans, but of pensive mien--exiles of a higher scale\nin the ladder of humanity than the Eskimos, but, I thought, much more\nunhappy, since with superior perceptions they are compelled to live\nwithin the limits of the Polar Circle.\n\nSometimes they gave vent to a convulsive laugh, but by no chance did\nthey smile. Their costume consists of a coarse capote of black wool,\nknown in Scandinavian countries as the \"vadmel,\" a broad-brimmed hat,\ntrousers of red serge, and a piece of leather tied with strings for a\nshoe--a coarse kind of moccasin. The women, though sad-looking and\nmournful, had rather agreeable features, without much expression. They\nwear a bodice and petticoat of somber vadmel. When unmarried they wear a\nlittle brown knitted cap over a crown of plaited hair; but when married,\nthey cover their heads with a colored handkerchief, over which they tie\na white scarf.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nConversation and Discovery\n\n\nWhen I returned, dinner was ready. This meal was devoured by my worthy\nrelative with avidity and voracity. His shipboard diet had turned his\ninterior into a perfect gulf. The repast, which was more Danish than\nIcelandic, was in itself nothing, but the excessive hospitality of our\nhost made us enjoy it doubly.\n\nThe conversation turned upon scientific matters, and M. Fridriksson\nasked my uncle what he thought of the public library.\n\n\"Library, sir?\" cried my uncle; \"it appears to me a collection of\nuseless odd volumes, and a beggarly amount of empty shelves.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried M. Fridriksson; \"why, we have eight thousand volumes of\nmost rare and valuable works--some in the Scandinavian language, besides\nall the new publications from Copenhagen.\"\n\n\"Eight thousand volumes, my dear sir--why, where are they?\" cried my\nuncle.\n\n\"Scattered over the country, Professor Hardwigg. We are very studious,\nmy dear sir, though we do live in Iceland. Every farmer, every laborer,\nevery fisherman can both read and write--and we think that books instead\nof being locked up in cupboards, far from the sight of students, should\nbe distributed as widely as possible. The books of our library are\ntherefore passed from hand to hand without returning to the library\nshelves perhaps for years.\"\n\n\"Then when foreigners visit you, there is nothing for them to see?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, foreigners have their own libraries, and our first\nconsideration is, that our humbler classes should be highly educated.\nFortunately, the love of study is innate in the Icelandic people. In\n1816 we founded a Literary Society and Mechanics' Institute; many\nforeign scholars of eminence are honorary members; we publish books\ndestined to educate our people, and these books have rendered valuable\nservices to our country. Allow me to have the honor, Professor Hardwigg,\nto enroll you as an honorary member?\"\n\nMy uncle, who already belonged to nearly every literary and scientific\ninstitution in Europe, immediately yielded to the amiable wishes of good\nM. Fridriksson.\n\n\"And now,\" he said, after many expressions of gratitude and good will,\n\"if you will tell me what books you expected to find, perhaps I may be\nof some assistance to you.\"\n\nI watched my uncle keenly. For a minute or two he hesitated, as if\nunwilling to speak; to speak openly was, perhaps, to unveil his\nprojects. Nevertheless, after some reflection, he made up his mind.\n\n\"Well, M. Fridriksson,\" he said in an easy, unconcerned kind of way, \"I\nwas desirous of ascertaining, if among other valuable works, you had any\nof the learned Arne Saknussemm.\"\n\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" cried the Professor of Reykjavik; \"you speak of one\nof the most distinguished scholars of the sixteenth century, of the\ngreat naturalist, the great alchemist, the great traveler.\"\n\n\"Exactly so.\"\n\n\"One of the most distinguished men connected with Icelandic science and\nliterature.\"\n\n\"As you say, sir--\"\n\n\"A man illustrious above all.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, all this is true, but his works?\"\n\n\"We have none of them.\"\n\n\"Not in Iceland?\"\n\n\"There are none in Iceland or elsewhere,\" answered the other, sadly.\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because Arne Saknussemm was persecuted for heresy, and in 1573 his\nworks were publicly burnt at Copenhagen, by the hands of the common\nhangman.\"\n\n\"Very good! capital!\" murmured my uncle, to the great astonishment of\nthe worthy Icelander.\n\n\"You said, sir--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, all is clear, I see the link in the chain; everything is\nexplained, and I now understand why Arne Saknussemm, put out of court,\nforced to hide his magnificent discoveries, was compelled to conceal\nbeneath the veil of an incomprehensible cryptograph, the secret--\"\n\n\"What secret?\"\n\n\"A secret--which,\" stammered my uncle.\n\n\"Have you discovered some wonderful manuscript?\" cried M. Fridriksson.\n\n\"No! no, I was carried away by my enthusiasm. A mere supposition.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir. But, really, to turn to another subject, I hope you\nwill not leave our island without examining into its mineralogical\nriches.\"\n\n\"Well, the fact is, I am rather late. So many learned men have been here\nbefore me.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, but there is still much to be done,\" cried M. Fridriksson.\n\n\"You think so,\" said my uncle, his eyes twinkling with hidden\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"Yes, you have no idea how many unknown mountains, glaciers, volcanoes\nthere are which remain to be studied. Without moving from where we sit,\nI can show you one. Yonder on the edge of the horizon, you see\nSneffels.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, Sneffels,\" said my uncle.\n\n\"One of the most curious volcanoes in existence, the crater of which has\nbeen rarely visited.\"\n\n\"Extinct?\"\n\n\"Extinct, any time these five hundred years,\" was the ready reply.\n\n\"Well,\" said my uncle, who dug his nails into his flesh, and pressed his\nknees tightly together to prevent himself leaping up with joy. \"I have a\ngreat mind to begin my studies with an examination of the geological\nmysteries of this Mount Seffel--Feisel--what do you call it?\"\n\n\"Sneffels, my dear sir.\"\n\nThis portion of the conversation took place in Latin, and I therefore\nunderstood all that had been said. I could scarcely keep my countenance\nwhen I found my uncle so cunningly concealing his delight and\nsatisfaction. I must confess that his artful grimaces, put on to conceal\nhis happiness, made him look like a new Mephistopheles.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he continued, \"your proposition delights me. I will endeavor\nto climb to the summit of Sneffels, and, if possible, will descend into\nits crater.\"\n\n\"I very much regret,\" continued M. Fridriksson, \"that my occupation will\nentirely preclude the possibility of my accompanying you. It would have\nbeen both pleasurable and profitable if I could have spared the time.\"\n\n\"No, no, a thousand times no,\" cried my uncle. \"I do not wish to disturb\nthe serenity of any man. I thank you, however, with all my heart. The\npresence of one so learned as yourself, would no doubt have been most\nuseful, but the duties of your office and profession before everything.\"\n\nIn the innocence of his simple heart, our host did not perceive the\nirony of these remarks.\n\n\"I entirely approve your project,\" continued the Icelander after some\nfurther remarks. \"It is a good idea to begin by examining this volcano.\nYou will make a harvest of curious observations. In the first place, how\ndo you propose to get to Sneffels?\"\n\n\"By sea. I shall cross the bay. Of course that is the most rapid route.\"\n\n\"Of course. But still it cannot be done.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"We have not an available boat in all Reykjavik,\" replied the other.\n\n\"What is to be done?\"\n\n\"You must go by land along the coast. It is longer, but much more\ninteresting.\"\n\n\"Then I must have a guide.\"\n\n\"Of course; and I have your very man.\"\n\n\"Somebody on whom I can depend.\"\n\n\"Yes, an inhabitant of the peninsula on which Sneffels is situated. He\nis a very shrewd and worthy man, with whom you will be pleased. He\nspeaks Danish like a Dane.\"\n\n\"When can I see him--today?\"\n\n\"No, tomorrow; he will not be here before.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow be it,\" replied my uncle, with a deep sigh.\n\nThe conversation ended by compliments on both sides. During the dinner\nmy uncle had learned much as to the history of Arne Saknussemm, the\nreasons for his mysterious and hieroglyphical document. He also became\naware that his host would not accompany him on his adventurous\nexpedition, and that next day we should have a guide.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\nTHE EIDER-DOWN HUNTER--OFF AT LAST\n\n\nThat evening I took a brief walk on the shore near Reykjavik, after\nwhich I returned to an early sleep on my bed of coarse planks, where I\nslept the sleep of the just. When I awoke I heard my uncle speaking\nloudly in the next room. I rose hastily and joined him. He was talking\nin Danish with a man of tall stature, and of perfectly Herculean build.\nThis man appeared to be possessed of very great strength. His eyes,\nwhich started rather prominently from a very large head, the face\nbelonging to which was simple and naive, appeared very quick and\nintelligent. Very long hair, which even in England would have been\naccounted exceedingly red, fell over his athletic shoulders. This native\nof Iceland was active and supple in appearance, though he scarcely moved\nhis arms, being in fact one of those men who despise the habit of\ngesticulation common to southern people.\n\nEverything in this man's manner revealed a calm and phlegmatic\ntemperament. There was nothing indolent about him, but his appearance\nspoke of tranquillity. He was one of those who never seemed to expect\nanything from anybody, who liked to work when he thought proper, and\nwhose philosophy nothing could astonish or trouble.\n\nI began to comprehend his character, simply from the way in which he\nlistened to the wild and impassioned verbiage of my worthy uncle. While\nthe excellent Professor spoke sentence after sentence, he stood with\nfolded arms, utterly still, motionless to all my uncle's gesticulations.\nWhen he wanted to say No he moved his head from left to right; when he\nacquiesced he nodded, so slightly that you could scarcely see the\nundulation of his head. This economy of motion was carried to the length\nof avarice.\n\nJudging from his appearance I should have been a long time before I had\nsuspected him to be what he was, a mighty hunter. Certainly his manner\nwas not likely to frighten the game. How, then, did he contrive to get\nat his prey?\n\nMy surprise was slightly modified when I knew that this tranquil and\nsolemn personage was only a hunter of the eider duck, the down of which\nis, after all, the greatest source of the Icelanders' wealth.\n\nIn the early days of summer, the female of the eider, a pretty sort of\nduck, builds its nest amid the rocks of the fjords--the name given to\nall narrow gulfs in Scandinavian countries--with which every part of the\nisland is indented. No sooner has the eider duck made her nest than she\nlines the inside of it with the softest down from her breast. Then comes\nthe hunter or trader, taking away the nest, the poor bereaved female\nbegins her task over again, and this continues as long as any eider down\nis to be found.\n\nWhen she can find no more the male bird sets to work to see what he can\ndo. As, however, his down is not so soft, and has therefore no\ncommercial value, the hunter does not take the trouble to rob him of his\nnest lining. The nest is accordingly finished, the eggs are laid, the\nlittle ones are born, and next year the harvest of eider down is again\ncollected.\n\nNow, as the eider duck never selects steep rocks or aspects to build its\nnest, but rather sloping and low cliffs near to the sea, the Icelandic\nhunter can carry on his trade operations without much difficulty. He is\nlike a farmer who has neither to plow, to sow, nor to harrow, only to\ncollect his harvest.\n\nThis grave, sententious, silent person, as phlegmatic as an Englishman\non the French stage, was named Hans Bjelke. He had called upon us in\nconsequence of the recommendation of M. Fridriksson. He was, in fact,\nour future guide. It struck me that had I sought the world over, I could\nnot have found a greater contradiction to my impulsive uncle.\n\nThey, however, readily understood one another. Neither of them had any\nthought about money; one was ready to take all that was offered him, the\nother ready to offer anything that was asked. It may readily be\nconceived, then, that an understanding was soon come to between them.\n\nNow, the understanding was, that he was to take us to the village of\nStapi, situated on the southern slope of the peninsula of Sneffels, at\nthe very foot of the volcano. Hans, the guide, told us the distance was\nabout twenty-two miles, a journey which my uncle supposed would take\nabout two days.\n\nBut when my uncle came to understand that they were Danish miles, of\neight thousand yards each, he was obliged to be more moderate in his\nideas, and, considering the horrible roads we had to follow, to allow\neight or ten days for the journey.\n\nFour horses were prepared for us, two to carry the baggage, and two to\nbear the important weight of myself and uncle. Hans declared that\nnothing ever would make him climb on the back of any animal. He knew\nevery inch of that part of the coast, and promised to take us the very\nshortest way.\n\nHis engagement with my uncle was by no means to cease with our arrival\nat Stapi; he was further to remain in his service during the whole time\nrequired for the completion of his scientific investigations, at the\nfixed salary of three rix-dollars a week, being exactly fourteen\nshillings and twopence, minus one farthing, English currency. One\nstipulation, however, was made by the guide--the money was to be paid to\nhim every Saturday night, failing which, his engagement was at an end.\n\nThe day of our departure was fixed. My uncle wished to hand the\neider-down hunter an advance, but he refused in one emphatic word--\n\n\"Efter.\"\n\nWhich being translated from Icelandic into plain English means--\"After.\"\n\nThe treaty concluded, our worthy guide retired without another word.\n\n\"A splendid fellow,\" said my uncle; \"only he little suspects the\nmarvelous part he is about to play in the history of the world.\"\n\n\"You mean, then,\" I cried in amazement, \"that he should accompany us?\"\n\n\"To the interior of the earth, yes,\" replied my uncle. \"Why not?\"\n\nThere were yet forty-eight hours to elapse before we made our final\nstart. To my great regret, our whole time was taken up in making\npreparations for our journey. All our industry and ability were devoted\nto packing every object in the most advantageous manner--the instruments\non one side, the arms on the other, the tools here and the provisions\nthere. There were, in fact, four distinct groups.\n\nThe instruments were of course of the best manufacture:\n\n1. A centigrade thermometer of Eigel, counting up to 150 degrees, which\nto me did not appear half enough--or too much. Too hot by half, if the\ndegree of heat was to ascend so high--in which case we should certainly\nbe cooked--not enough, if we wanted to ascertain the exact temperature\nof springs or metal in a state of fusion.\n\n2. A manometer worked by compressed air, an instrument used to ascertain\nthe upper atmospheric pressure on the level of the ocean. Perhaps a\ncommon barometer would not have done as well, the atmospheric pressure\nbeing likely to increase in proportion as we descended below the surface\nof the earth.\n\n3. A first-class chronometer made by Boissonnas, of Geneva, set at the\nmeridian of Hamburg, from which Germans calculate, as the English do\nfrom Greenwich, and the French from Paris.\n\n4. Two compasses, one for horizontal guidance, the other to ascertain\nthe dip.\n\n5. A night glass.\n\n6. Two Ruhmkorff coils, which, by means of a current of electricity,\nwould ensure us a very excellent, easily carried, and certain means of\nobtaining light.\n\n7. A voltaic battery on the newest principle.[1]\n\n[1] Thermometer (<i>thermos</i>, and <i>metron</i>, measure); an instrument for\nmeasuring the temperature of the air.--Manometer (<i>manos</i>,and <i>metron</i>,\nmeasure); an instrument to show the density or rarity of\ngases.--Chronometer (<i>chronos</i>. time, and <i>metros</i>, measure) a time\nmeasurer, or superior watch--Ruhmkorff's coil, an instrument for\nproducing currents of induced electricity of great intensity. It\nconsists of a coil of copper wire, insulated by being covered with silk,\nsurrounded by another coil of fine wire, also insulated, in which a\nmomentary current is induced when a current is passed through the inner\ncoil from a voltaic battery. When the apparatus is in action, the gas\nbecomes luminous, and produces a white and continued light. The battery\nand wire are carried in a leather bag, which the traveler fastens by a\nstrap to his shoulders. The lantern is in front, and enables the\nbenighted wanderer to see in the most profound obscurity. He may venture\nwithout fear of explosion into the midst of the most inflammable gases,\nand the lantern will burn beneath the deepest waters. H. D. Ruhmkorff,\nan able and learned chemist, discovered the induction coil. In 1864 he\nwon the quinquennial French prize of L2,000 for this ingenious\napplication of electricity--A voltaic battery, so called from Volta, its\ndesigner, is an apparatus consisting of a series of metal plates\narranged in pairs and subjected to the action of saline solutions for\nproducing currents of electricity.\n\nOur arms consisted of two rifles, with two revolving six-shooters. Why\nthese arms were provided it was impossible for me to say. I had every\nreason to believe that we had neither wild beasts nor savage natives to\nfear. My uncle, on the other hand, was quite as devoted to his arsenal\nas to his collection of instruments, and above all was very careful with\nhis provision of fulminating or gun cotton, warranted to keep in any\nclimate, and of which the expansive force was known to be greater than\nthat of ordinary gunpowder.\n\nOur tools consisted of two pickaxes, two crowbars, a silken ladder,\nthree iron-shod Alpine poles, a hatchet, a hammer, a dozen wedges, some\npointed pieces of iron, and a quantity of strong rope. You may conceive\nthat the whole made a tolerable parcel, especially when I mention that\nthe ladder itself was three hundred feet long!\n\nThen there came the important question of provisions. The hamper was not\nvery large but tolerably satisfactory, for I knew that in concentrated\nessence of meat and biscuit there was enough to last six months. The\nonly liquid provided by my uncle was Schiedam. Of water, not a drop. We\nhad, however, an ample supply of gourds, and my uncle counted on finding\nwater, and enough to fill them, as soon as we commenced our downward\njourney. My remarks as to the temperature, the quality, and even as to\nthe possibility of none being found, remained wholly without effect.\n\nTo make up the exact list of our traveling gear--for the guidance of\nfuture travelers--add, that we carried a medicine and surgical chest\nwith all apparatus necessary for wounds, fractures and blows; lint,\nscissors, lancets--in fact, a perfect collection of horrible looking\ninstruments; a number of vials containing ammonia, alcohol, ether,\nGoulard water, aromatic vinegar, in fact, every possible and impossible\ndrug--finally, all the materials for working the Ruhmkorff coil!\n\nMy uncle had also been careful to lay in a goodly supply of tobacco,\nseveral flasks of very fine gunpowder, boxes of tinder, besides a large\nbelt crammed full of notes and gold. Good boots rendered watertight were\nto be found to the number of six in the tool box.\n\n\"My boy, with such clothing, with such boots, and such general\nequipment,\" said my uncle, in a state of rapturous delight, \"we may hope\nto travel far.\"\n\nIt took a whole day to put all these matters in order. In the evening we\ndined with Baron Trampe, in company with the Mayor of Reykjavik, and\nDoctor Hyaltalin, the great medical man of Iceland. M. Fridriksson was\nnot present, and I was afterwards sorry to hear that he and the governor\ndid not agree on some matters connected with the administration of the\nisland. Unfortunately, the consequence was, that I did not understand a\nword that was said at dinner--a kind of semiofficial reception. One\nthing I can say, my uncle never left off speaking.\n\nThe next day our labor came to an end. Our worthy host delighted my\nuncle, Professor Hardwigg, by giving him a good map of Iceland, a most\nimportant and precious document for a mineralogist.\n\nOur last evening was spent in a long conversation with M. Fridriksson,\nwhom I liked very much--the more that I never expected to see him or\nanyone else again. After this agreeable way of spending an hour or so, I\ntried to sleep. In vain; with the exception of a few dozes, my night was\nmiserable.\n\nAt five o'clock in the morning I was awakened from the only real half\nhour's sleep of the night by the loud neighing of horses under my\nwindow. I hastily dressed myself and went down into the street. Hans was\nengaged in putting the finishing stroke to our baggage, which he did in\na silent, quiet way that won my admiration, and yet he did it admirably\nwell. My uncle wasted a great deal of breath in giving him directions,\nbut worthy Hans took not the slightest notice of his words.\n\nAt six o'clock all our preparations were completed, and M. Fridriksson\nshook hands heartily with us. My uncle thanked him warmly, in the\nIcelandic language, for his kind hospitality, speaking truly from the\nheart.\n\nAs for myself I put together a few of my best Latin phrases and paid him\nthe highest compliments I could. This fraternal and friendly duty\nperformed, we sallied forth and mounted our horses.\n\nAs soon as we were quite ready, M. Fridriksson advanced, and by way of\nfarewell, called after me in the words of Virgil--words which appeared\nto have been made for us, travelers starting for an uncertain\ndestination:\n\n\"Et quacunque viam dederit fortuna sequamur.\"\n\n(\"And whichsoever way thou goest, may fortune follow!\")\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nOUR START--WE MEET WITH ADVENTURES BY THE WAY\n\n\nThe weather was overcast but settled, when we commenced our adventurous\nand perilous journey. We had neither to fear fatiguing heat nor\ndrenching rain. It was, in fact, real tourist weather.\n\nAs there was nothing I liked better than horse exercise, the pleasure of\nriding through an unknown country caused the early part of our\nenterprise to be particularly agreeable to me.\n\nI began to enjoy the exhilarating delight of traveling, a life of\ndesire, gratification and liberty. The truth is, that my spirits rose so\nrapidly, that I began to be indifferent to what had once appeared to be\na terrible journey.\n\n\"After all,\" I said to myself, \"what do I risk? Simply to take a journey\nthrough a curious country, to climb a remarkable mountain, and if the\nworst comes to the worst, to descend into the crater of an extinct\nvolcano.\"\n\nThere could be no doubt that this was all this terrible Saknussemm had\ndone. As to the existence of a gallery, or of subterraneous passages\nleading into the interior of the earth, the idea was simply absurd, the\nhallucination of a distempered imagination. All, then, that may be\nrequired of me I will do cheerfully, and will create no difficulty.\n\nIt was just before we left Reykjavik that I came to this decision.\n\nHans, our extraordinary guide, went first, walking with a steady, rapid,\nunvarying step. Our two horses with the luggage followed of their own\naccord, without requiring whip or spur. My uncle and I came behind,\ncutting a very tolerable figure upon our small but vigorous animals.\n\nIceland is one of the largest islands in Europe. It contains thirty\nthousand square miles of surface, and has about seventy thousand\ninhabitants. Geographers have divided it into four parts, and we had to\ncross the southwest quarter which in the vernacular is called Sudvestr\nFjordungr.\n\nHans, on taking his departure from Reykjavik, had followed the line of\nthe sea. We took our way through poor and sparse meadows, which made a\ndesperate effort every year to show a little green. They very rarely\nsucceed in a good show of yellow.\n\nThe rugged summits of the rocky hills were dimly visible on the edge of\nthe horizon, through the misty fogs; every now and then some heavy\nflakes of snow showed conspicuous in the morning light, while certain\nlofty and pointed rocks were first lost in the grey low clouds, their\nsummits clearly visible above, like jagged reefs rising from a troublous\nsea.\n\nEvery now and then a spur of rock came down through the arid ground,\nleaving us scarcely room to pass. Our horses, however, appeared not only\nwell acquainted with the country, but by a kind of instinct, knew which\nwas the best road. My uncle had not even the satisfaction of urging\nforward his steed by whip, spur, or voice. It was utterly useless to\nshow any signs of impatience. I could not help smiling to see him look\nso big on his little horse; his long legs now and then touching the\nground made him look like a six-footed centaur.\n\n\"Good beast, good beast,\" he would cry. \"I assure you, that I begin to\nthink no animal is more intelligent than an Icelandic horse. Snow,\ntempest, impracticable roads, rocks, icebergs--nothing stops him. He is\nbrave; he is sober; he is safe; he never makes a false step; never\nglides or slips from his path. I dare to say that if any river, any\nfjord has to be crossed--and I have no doubt there will be many--you\nwill see him enter the water without hesitation like an amphibious\nanimal, and reach the opposite side in safety. We must not, however,\nattempt to hurry him; we must allow him to have his own way, and I\nwill undertake to say that between us we shall do our ten leagues a\nday.\"\n\n\"We may do so,\" was my reply, \"but what about our worthy guide?\"\n\n\"I have not the slightest anxiety about him: that sort of people go\nahead without knowing even what they are about. Look at Hans. He moves\nso little that it is impossible for him to become fatigued. Besides, if\nhe were to complain of weariness, he could have the loan of my horse. I\nshould have a violent attack of the cramp if I were not to have some\nsort of exercise. My arms are right--but my legs are getting a little\nstiff.\"\n\nAll this while we were advancing at a rapid pace. The country we had\nreached was already nearly a desert. Here and there could be seen an\nisolated farm, some solitary bur, or Icelandic house, built of wood,\nearth, fragments of lava--looking like beggars on the highway of life.\nThese wretched and miserable huts excited in us such pity that we felt\nhalf disposed to leave alms at every door. In this country there are no\nroads, paths are nearly unknown, and vegetation, poor as it was, slowly\nas it reached perfection, soon obliterated all traces of the few\ntravelers who passed from place to place.\n\nNevertheless, this division of the province, situated only a few miles\nfrom the capital, is considered one of the best cultivated and most\nthickly peopled in all Iceland. What, then, must be the state of the\nless known and more distant parts of the island? After traveling fully\nhalf a Danish mile, we had met neither a farmer at the door of his hut,\nnor even a wandering shepherd with his wild and savage flock.\n\nA few stray cows and sheep were only seen occasionally. What, then, must\nwe expect when we come to the upheaved regions--to the districts broken\nand roughened from volcanic eruptions and subterraneous commotions?\n\nWe were to learn this all in good time. I saw, however, on consulting\nthe map, that we avoided a good deal of this rough country, by following\nthe winding and desolate shores of the sea. In reality, the great\nvolcanic movement of the island, and all its attendant phenomena, are\nconcentrated in the interior of the island; there, horizontal layers or\nstrata of rocks, piled one upon the other, eruptions of basaltic origin,\nand streams of lava, have given this country a kind of supernatural\nreputation.\n\nLittle did I expect, however, the spectacle which awaited us when we\nreached the peninsula of Sneffels, where agglomerations of nature's\nruins form a kind of terrible chaos.\n\nSome two hours or more after we had left the city of Reykjavik, we\nreached the little town called Aoalkirkja, or the principal church. It\nconsists simply of a few houses--not what in England or Germany we\nshould call a hamlet.\n\nHans stopped here one half hour. He shared our frugal breakfast,\nanswered Yes, and No to my uncle's questions as to the nature of the\nroad, and at last when asked where we were to pass the night was as\nlaconic as usual.\n\n\"Gardar!\" was his one-worded reply.\n\nI took occasion to consult the map, to see where Gardar was to be found.\nAfter looking keenly I found a small town of that name on the borders of\nthe Hvalfjord, about four miles from Reykjavik. I pointed this out to my\nuncle, who made a very energetic grimace.\n\n\"Only four miles out of twenty-two? Why it is only a little walk.\"\n\nHe was about to make some energetic observation to the guide, but Hans,\nwithout taking the slightest notice of him, went in front of the horses,\nand walked ahead with the same imperturbable phlegm he had always\nexhibited.\n\nThree hours later, still traveling over those apparently interminable\nand sandy prairies, we were compelled to go round the Kollafjord, an\neasier and shorter cut than crossing the gulfs. Shortly after we entered\na place of communal jurisdiction called Ejulberg, and the clock of which\nwould then have struck twelve, if any Icelandic church had been rich\nenough to possess so valuable and useful an article. These sacred\nedifices are, however, very much like these people, who do without\nwatches--and never miss them.\n\nHere the horses were allowed to take some rest and refreshment, then\nfollowing a narrow strip of shore between high rocks and the sea, they\ntook us without further halt to the Aoalkirkja of Brantar, and after\nanother mile to Saurboer Annexia, a chapel of ease, situated on the\nsouthern bank of the Hvalfjord.\n\nIt was four o'clock in the evening and we had traveled four Danish\nmiles, about equal to twenty English.\n\nThe fjord was in this place about half a mile in width. The sweeping and\nbroken waves came rolling in upon the pointed rocks; the gulf was\nsurrounded by rocky walls--a mighty cliff, three thousand feet in\nheight, remarkable for its brown strata, separated here and there by\nbeds of tufa of a reddish hue. Now, whatever may have been the\nintelligence of our horses, I had not the slightest reliance upon them,\nas a means of crossing a stormy arm of the sea. To ride over salt water\nupon the back of a little horse seemed to me absurd.\n\n\"If they are really intelligent,\" I said to myself, \"they will certainly\nnot make the attempt. In any case, I shall trust rather to my own\nintelligence than theirs.\"\n\nBut my uncle was in no humor to wait. He dug his heels into the sides of\nhis steed, and made for the shore. His horse went to the very edge of\nthe water, sniffed at the approaching wave and retreated.\n\nMy uncle, who was, sooth to say, quite as obstinate as the beast he\nbestrode, insisted on his making the desired advance. This attempt was\nfollowed by a new refusal on the part of the horse which quietly shook\nhis head. This demonstration of rebellion was followed by a volley of\nwords and a stout application of whipcord; also followed by kicks on the\npart of the horse, which threw its head and heels upwards and tried to\nthrow his rider. At length the sturdy little pony, spreading out his\nlegs, in a stiff and ludicrous attitude, got from under the Professor's\nlegs, and left him standing, with both feet on a separate stone, like\nthe Colossus of Rhodes.\n\n\"Wretched animal!\" cried my uncle, suddenly transformed into a foot\npassenger--and as angry and ashamed as a dismounted cavalry officer on\nthe field of battle.\n\n\"Farja,\" said the guide, tapping him familiarly on the shoulder.\n\n\"What, a ferry boat!\"\n\n\"Der,\" answered Hans, pointing to where lay the boat in\nquestion--\"there.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I cried, quite delighted with the information; \"so it is.\"\n\n\"Why did you not say so before,\" cried my uncle; \"why not start at\nonce?\"\n\n\"Tidvatten,\" said the guide.\n\n\"What does he say?\" I asked, considerably puzzled by the delay and the\ndialogue.\n\n\"He says tide,\" replied my uncle, translating the Danish word for my\ninformation.\n\n\"Of course I understand--we must wait till the tide serves.\"\n\n\"For bida?\" asked my uncle.\n\n\"Ja,\" replied Hans.\n\nMy uncle frowned, stamped his feet and then followed the horses to where\nthe boat lay.\n\nI thoroughly understood and appreciated the necessity for waiting,\nbefore crossing the fjord, for that moment when the sea at its highest\npoint is in a state of slack water. As neither the ebb nor flow can then\nbe felt, the ferry boat was in no danger of being carried out to sea, or\ndashed upon the rocky coast.\n\nThe favorable moment did not come until six o'clock in the evening. Then\nmy uncle, myself, and guide, two boatmen and the four horses got into a\nvery awkward flat-bottom boat. Accustomed as I had been to the steam\nferry boats of the Elbe, I found the long oars of the boatmen but sorry\nmeans of locomotion. We were more than an hour in crossing the fjord;\nbut at length the passage was concluded without accident.\n\nHalf an hour later we reached Gardar.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nTRAVELING IN ICELAND\n\n\nIt ought, one would have thought, to have been night, even in the\nsixty-fifth parallel of latitude; but still the nocturnal illumination\ndid not surprise me. For in Iceland, during the months of June and July,\nthe sun never sets.\n\nThe temperature, however, was very much lower than I expected. I was\ncold, but even that did not affect me so much as ravenous hunger.\nWelcome indeed, therefore, was the hut which hospitably opened its doors\nto us.\n\nIt was merely the house of a peasant, but in the matter of hospitality,\nit was worthy of being the palace of a king. As we alighted at the door\nthe master of the house came forward, held out his hand, and without any\nfurther ceremony, signaled to us to follow him.\n\nWe followed him, for to accompany him was impossible. A long, narrow,\ngloomy passage led into the interior of this habitation, made from beams\nroughly squared by the ax. This passage gave ingress to every room. The\nchambers were four in number--the kitchen, the workshop, where the\nweaving was carried on, the general sleeping chamber of the family, and\nthe best room, to which strangers were especially invited. My uncle,\nwhose lofty stature had not been taken into consideration when the house\nwas built, contrived to knock his head against the beams of the roof.\n\nWe were introduced into our chamber, a kind of large room with a hard\nearthen floor, and lighted by a window, the panes of which were made of\na sort of parchment from the intestines of sheep--very far from\ntransparent.\n\nThe bedding was composed of dry hay thrown into two long red wooden\nboxes, ornamented with sentences painted in Icelandic. I really had no\nidea that we should be made so comfortable. There was one objection to\nthe house, and that was, the very powerful odor of dried fish, of\nmacerated meat, and of sour milk, which three fragrances combined did\nnot at all suit my olfactory nerves.\n\nAs soon as we had freed ourselves from our heavy traveling costume, the\nvoice of our host was heard calling to us to come into the kitchen, the\nonly room in which the Icelanders ever make any fire, no matter how cold\nit may be.\n\nMy uncle, nothing loath, hastened to obey this hospitable and friendly\ninvitation. I followed.\n\nThe kitchen chimney was made on an antique model. A large stone standing\nin the middle of the room was the fireplace; above, in the roof, was a\nhole for the smoke to pass through. This apartment was kitchen, parlor\nand dining room all in one.\n\nOn our entrance, our worthy host, as if he had not seen us before,\nadvanced ceremoniously, uttered a word which means \"be happy,\" and then\nkissed both of us on the cheek.\n\nHis wife followed, pronounced the same word, with the same ceremonial,\nthen the husband and wife, placing their right hands upon their hearts,\nbowed profoundly.\n\nThis excellent Icelandic woman was the mother of nineteen children, who,\nlittle and big, rolled, crawled, and walked about in the midst of\nvolumes of smoke arising from the angular fireplace in the middle of the\nroom. Every now and then I could see a fresh white head, and a slightly\nmelancholy expression of countenance, peering at me through the vapor.\n\nBoth my uncle and myself, however, were very friendly with the whole\nparty, and before we were aware of it, there were three or four of these\nlittle ones on our shoulders, as many on our boxes, and the rest hanging\nabout our legs. Those who could speak kept crying out saellvertu in\nevery possible and impossible key. Those who did not speak only made all\nthe more noise.\n\nThis concert was interrupted by the announcement of supper. At this\nmoment our worthy guide, the eider-duck hunter, came in after seeing to\nthe feeding and stabling of the horses--which consisted in letting them\nloose to browse on the stunted green of the Icelandic prairies. There\nwas little for them to eat, but moss and some very dry and innutritious\ngrass; next day they were ready before the door, some time before we\nwere.\n\n\"Welcome,\" said Hans.\n\nThen tranquilly, with the air of an automaton, without any more\nexpression in one kiss than another, he embraced the host and hostess\nand their nineteen children.\n\nThis ceremony concluded to the satisfaction of all parties, we all sat\ndown to table, that is twenty-four of us, somewhat crowded. Those who\nwere best off had only two juveniles on their knees.\n\nAs soon, however, as the inevitable soup was placed on the table, the\nnatural taciturnity, common even to Icelandic babies, prevailed over all\nelse. Our host filled our plates with a portion of lichen soup of\nIceland moss, of by no means disagreeable flavor, an enormous lump of\nfish floating in sour butter. After that there came some skyr, a kind of\ncurds and whey, served with biscuits and juniper-berry juice. To drink,\nwe had blanda, skimmed milk with water. I was hungry, so hungry, that by\nway of dessert I finished up with a basin of thick oaten porridge.\n\nAs soon as the meal was over, the children disappeared, whilst the grown\npeople sat around the fireplace, on which was placed turf, heather, cow\ndung and dried fish-bones. As soon as everybody was sufficiently warm, a\ngeneral dispersion took place, all retiring to their respective couches.\nOur hostess offered to pull off our stockings and trousers, according to\nthe custom of the country, but as we graciously declined to be so\nhonored, she left us to our bed of dry fodder.\n\nNext day, at five in the morning, we took our leave of these hospitable\npeasants. My uncle had great difficulty in making them accept a\nsufficient and proper remuneration.\n\nHans then gave the signal to start.\n\nWe had scarcely got a hundred yards from Gardar, when the character of\nthe country changed. The soil began to be marshy and boggy, and less\nfavorable to progress. To the right, the range of mountains was\nprolonged indefinitely like a great system of natural fortifications, of\nwhich we skirted the glacis. We met with numerous streams and rivulets\nwhich it was necessary to ford, and that without wetting our baggage. As\nwe advanced, the deserted appearance increased, and yet now and then we\ncould see human shadows flitting in the distance. When a sudden turn of\nthe track brought us within easy reach of one of these specters, I felt\na sudden impulse of disgust at the sight of a swollen head, with shining\nskin, utterly without hair, and whose repulsive and revolting wounds\ncould be seen through his rags. The unhappy wretches never came forward\nto beg; on the contrary, they ran away; not so quick, however, but that\nHans was able to salute them with the universal saellvertu.\n\n\"Spetelsk,\" said he.\n\n\"A leper,\" explained my uncle.\n\nThe very sound of such a word caused a feeling of repulsion. The\nhorrible affliction known as leprosy, which has almost vanished before\nthe effects of modern science, is common in Iceland. It is not\ncontagious but hereditary, so that marriage is strictly prohibited to\nthese unfortunate creatures.\n\nThese poor lepers did not tend to enliven our journey, the scene of\nwhich was inexpressibly sad and lonely. The very last tufts of grassy\nvegetation appeared to die at our feet. Not a tree was to be seen,\nexcept a few stunted willows about as big as blackberry bushes. Now and\nthen we watched a falcon soaring in the grey and misty air, taking his\nflight towards warmer and sunnier regions. I could not help feeling a\nsense of melancholy come over me. I sighed for my own Native Land, and\nwished to be back with Gretchen.\n\nWe were compelled to cross several little fjords, and at last came to a\nreal gulf. The tide was at its height, and we were able to go over at\nonce, and reach the hamlet of Alftanes, about a mile farther.\n\nThat evening, after fording the Alfa and the Heta, two rivers rich in\ntrout and pike, we were compelled to pass the night in a deserted house,\nworthy of being haunted by all the fays of Scandinavian mythology. The\nKing of Cold had taken up his residence there, and made us feel his\npresence all night.\n\nThe following day was remarkable by its lack of any particular\nincidents. Always the same damp and swampy soil; the same dreary\nuniformity; the same sad and monotonous aspect of scenery. In the\nevening, having accomplished the half of our projected journey, we slept\nat the Annexia of Krosolbt.\n\nFor a whole mile we had under our feet nothing but lava. This\ndisposition of the soil is called <i>hraun</i>: the crumbled lava on the\nsurface was in some instances like ship cables stretched out\nhorizontally, in others coiled up in heaps; an immense field of lava\ncame from the neighboring mountains, all extinct volcanoes, but whose\nremains showed what once they had been. Here and there could be made out\nthe steam from hot water springs.\n\nThere was no time, however, for us to take more than a cursory view of\nthese phenomena. We had to go forward with what speed we might. Soon the\nsoft and swampy soil again appeared under the feet of our horses, while\nat every hundred yards we came upon one or more small lakes. Our journey\nwas now in a westerly direction; we had, in fact, swept round the great\nbay of Faxa, and the twin white summits of Sneffels rose to the clouds\nat a distance of less than five miles.\n\nThe horses now advanced rapidly. The accidents and difficulties of the\nsoil no longer checked them. I confess that fatigue began to tell\nseverely upon me; but my uncle was as firm and as hard as he had been on\nthe first day. I could not help admiring both the excellent Professor\nand the worthy guide; for they appeared to regard this rugged expedition\nas a mere walk!\n\nOn Saturday, the 20th June, at six o'clock in the evening, we reached\nBudir, a small town picturesquely situated on the shore of the ocean;\nand here the guide asked for his money. My uncle settled with him\nimmediately. It was now the family of Hans himself, that is to say, his\nuncles, his cousins--german, who offered us hospitality. We were\nexceedingly well received, and without taking too much advantage of the\ngoodness of these worthy people, I should have liked very much to have\nrested with them after the fatigues of the journey. But my uncle, who\ndid not require rest, had no idea of anything of the kind; and despite\nthe fact that next day was Sunday, I was compelled once more to mount my\nsteed.\n\nThe soil was again affected by the neighborhood of the mountains, whose\ngranite peered out of the ground like tops of an old oak. We were\nskirting the enormous base of the mighty volcano. My uncle never took\nhis eyes from off it; he could not keep from gesticulating, and looking\nat it with a kind of sullen defiance as much as to say \"That is the\ngiant I have made up my mind to conquer.\"\n\nAfter four hours of steady traveling, the horses stopped of themselves\nbefore the door of the presbytery of Stapi.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nWE REACH MOUNT SNEFFELS--THE \"REYKIR\"\n\n\nStapi is a town consisting of thirty huts, built on a large plain of\nlava, exposed to the rays of the sun, reflected from the volcano. It\nstretches its humble tenements along the end of a little fjord,\nsurrounded by a basaltic wall of the most singular character.\n\nBasalt is a brown rock of igneous origin. It assumes regular forms,\nwhich astonish by their singular appearance. Here we found Nature\nproceeding geometrically, and working quite after a human fashion, as if\nshe had employed the plummet line, the compass and the rule. If\nelsewhere she produces grand artistic effects by piling up huge masses\nwithout order or connection--if elsewhere we see truncated cones,\nimperfect pyramids, with an odd succession of lines; here, as if wishing\nto give a lesson in regularity, and preceding the architects of the\nearly ages, she has erected a severe order of architecture, which\nneither the splendors of Babylon nor the marvels of Greece ever\nsurpassed.\n\nI had often heard of the Giant's Causeway in Ireland, and of Fingal's\nCave in one of the Hebrides, but the grand spectacle of a real basaltic\nformation had never yet come before my eyes.\n\nThis at Stapi gave us an idea of one in all its wonderful beauty and\ngrace.\n\nThe wall of the fjord, like nearly the whole of the peninsula, consisted\nof a series of vertical columns, in height about thirty feet. These\nupright pillars of stone, of the finest proportions, supported an\narchivault of horizontal columns which formed a kind of half-vaulted\nroof above the sea. At certain intervals, and below this natural basin,\nthe eye was pleased and surprised by the sight of oval openings through\nwhich the outward waves came thundering in volleys of foam. Some banks\nof basalt, torn from their fastenings by the fury of the waves, lay\nscattered on the ground like the ruins of an ancient temple--ruins\neternally young, over which the storms of ages swept without producing\nany perceptible effect!\n\nThis was the last stage of our journey. Hans had brought us along with\nfidelity and intelligence, and I began to feel somewhat more comfortable\nwhen I reflected that he was to accompany us still farther on our way.\n\nWhen we halted before the house of the Rector, a small and incommodious\ncabin, neither handsome nor more comfortable than those of his\nneighbors, I saw a man in the act of shoeing a horse, a hammer in his\nhand, and a leathern apron tied round his waist.\n\n\"Be happy,\" said the eider-down hunter, using his national salutation in\nhis own language.\n\n\"God dag--good day!\" replied the former, in excellent Danish.\n\n\"Kyrkoherde,\" cried Hans, turning round and introducing him to my uncle.\n\n\"The Rector,\" repeated the worthy Professor; \"it appears, my dear Harry,\nthat this worthy man is the Rector, and is not above doing his own\nwork.\"\n\nDuring the speaking of these words the guide intimated to the Kyrkoherde\nwhat was the true state of the case. The good man, ceasing from his\noccupation, gave a kind of halloo, upon which a tall woman, almost a\ngiantess, came out of the hut. She was at least six feet high, which in\nthat region is something considerable.\n\nMy first impression was one of horror. I thought she had come to give us\nthe Icelandic kiss. I had, however, nothing to fear, for she did not\neven show much inclination to receive us into her house.\n\nThe room devoted to strangers appeared to me to be by far the worst in\nthe presbytery; it was narrow, dirty and offensive. There was, however,\nno choice about the matter. The Rector had no notion of practicing the\nusual cordial and antique hospitality. Far from it. Before the day was\nover, I found we had to deal with a blacksmith, a fisherman, a hunter, a\ncarpenter, anything but a clergyman. It must be said in his favor that\nwe had caught him on a weekday; probably he appeared to greater\nadvantage on the Sunday.\n\nThese poor priests receive from the Danish Government a most\nridiculously inadequate salary, and collect one quarter of the tithe of\ntheir parish--not more than sixty marks current, or about L3 10s.\nsterling. Hence the necessity of working to live. In truth, we soon\nfound that our host did not count civility among the cardinal virtues.\n\nMy uncle soon became aware of the kind of man he had to deal with.\nInstead of a worthy and learned scholar, he found a dull ill-mannered\npeasant. He therefore resolved to start on his great expedition as soon\nas possible. He did not care about fatigue, and resolved to spend a few\ndays in the mountains.\n\nThe preparations for our departure were made the very next day after our\narrival at Stapi; Hans now hired three Icelanders to take the place of\nthe horses--which could no longer carry our luggage. When, however,\nthese worthy islanders had reached the bottom of the crater, they were\nto go back and leave us to ourselves. This point was settled before they\nwould agree to start.\n\nOn this occasion, my uncle partly confided in Hans, the eider-duck\nhunter, and gave him to understand that it was his intention to continue\nhis exploration of the volcano to the last possible limits.\n\nHans listened calmly, and then nodded his head. To go there, or\nelsewhere, to bury himself in the bowels of the earth, or to travel over\nits summits, was all the same to him! As for me, amused and occupied by\nthe incidents of travel, I had begun to forget the inevitable future;\nbut now I was once more destined to realize the actual state of affairs.\nWhat was to be done? Run away? But if I really had intended to leave\nProfessor Hardwigg to his fate, it should have been at Hamburg and not\nat the foot of Sneffels.\n\nOne idea, above all others, began to trouble me: a very terrible idea,\nand one calculated to shake the nerves of a man even less sensitive than\nmyself.\n\n\"Let us consider the matter,\" I said to myself; \"we are going to ascend\nthe Sneffels mountain. Well and good. We are about to pay a visit to the\nvery bottom of the crater. Good, still. Others have done it and did not\nperish from that course.\n\n\"That, however, is not the whole matter to be considered. If a road does\nreally present itself by which to descend into the dark and\nsubterraneous bowels of Mother Earth, if this thrice unhappy Saknussemm\nhas really told the truth, we shall be most certainly lost in the midst\nof the labyrinth of subterraneous galleries of the volcano. Now, we have\nno evidence to prove that Sneffels is really extinct. What proof have we\nthat an eruption is not shortly about to take place? Because the monster\nhas slept soundly since 1219, does it follow that he is never to wake?\n\n\"If he does wake what is to become of us?\"\n\nThese were questions worth thinking about, and upon them I reflected\nlong and deeply. I could not lie down in search of sleep without\ndreaming of eruptions. The more I thought, the more I objected to be\nreduced to the state of dross and ashes.\n\nI could stand it no longer; so I determined at last to submit the whole\ncase to my uncle, in the most adroit manner possible, and under the form\nof some totally irreconcilable hypothesis.\n\nI sought him. I laid before him my fears, and then drew back in order to\nlet him get his passion over at his ease.\n\n\"I have been thinking about the matter,\" he said, in the quietest tone\nin the world.\n\nWhat did he mean? Was he at last about to listen to the voice of reason?\nDid he think of suspending his projects? It was almost too much\nhappiness to be true.\n\nI however made no remark. In fact, I was only too anxious not to\ninterrupt him, and allowed him to reflect at his leisure. After some\nmoments he spoke out.\n\n\"I have been thinking about the matter,\" he resumed. \"Ever since we have\nbeen at Stapi, my mind has been almost solely occupied with the grave\nquestion which has been submitted to me by yourself--for nothing would\nbe unwiser and more inconsistent than to act with imprudence.\"\n\n\"I heartily agree with you, my dear uncle,\" was my somewhat hopeful\nrejoinder.\n\n\"It is now six hundred years since Sneffels has spoken, but though now\nreduced to a state of utter silence, he may speak again. New volcanic\neruptions are always preceded by perfectly well-known phenomena. I have\nclosely examined the inhabitants of this region; I have carefully\nstudied the soil, and I beg to tell you emphatically, my dear Harry,\nthere will be no eruption at present.\"\n\nAs I listened to his positive affirmations, I was stupefied and could\nsay nothing.\n\n\"I see you doubt my word,\" said my uncle; \"follow me.\"\n\nI obeyed mechanically.\n\nLeaving the presbytery, the Professor took a road through an opening in\nthe basaltic rock, which led far away from the sea. We were soon in open\ncountry, if we could give such a name to a place all covered with\nvolcanic deposits. The whole land seemed crushed under the weight of\nenormous stones--of trap, of basalt, of granite, of lava, and of all\nother volcanic substances.\n\nI could see many spouts of steam rising in the air. These white vapors,\ncalled in the Icelandic language \"reykir,\" come from hot water\nfountains, and indicate by their violence the volcanic activity of the\nsoil. Now the sight of these appeared to justify my apprehension. I was,\ntherefore, all the more surprised and mortified when my uncle thus\naddressed me.\n\n\"You see all this smoke, Harry, my boy?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, as long as you see them thus, you have nothing to fear from the\nvolcano.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\"\n\n\"Be careful to remember this,\" continued the Professor. \"At the approach\nof an eruption these spouts of vapor redouble their activity--to\ndisappear altogether during the period of volcanic eruption; for the\nelastic fluids, no longer having the necessary tension, seek refuge in\nthe interior of the crater, instead of escaping through the fissures of\nthe earth. If, then, the steam remains in its normal or habitual state,\nif their energy does not increase, and if you add to this, the remark\nthat the wind is not replaced by heavy atmospheric pressure and dead\ncalm, you may be quite sure that there is no fear of any immediate\neruption.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Enough, my boy. When science has sent forth her fiat--it is only to\nhear and obey.\"\n\nI came back to the house quite downcast and disappointed. My uncle had\ncompletely defeated me with his scientific arguments. Nevertheless, I\nhad still one hope, and that was, when once we were at the bottom of the\ncrater, that it would be impossible in default of a gallery or tunnel,\nto descend any deeper; and this, despite all the learned Saknussemms in\nthe world.\n\nI passed the whole of the following night with a nightmare on my chest!\nand, after unheard-of miseries and tortures, found myself in the very\ndepths of the earth, from which I was suddenly launched into planetary\nspace, under the form of an eruptive rock!\n\nNext day, June 23d, Hans calmly awaited us outside the presbytery with\nhis three companions loaded with provisions, tools, and instruments. Two\niron-shod poles, two guns, and two large game bags, were reserved for my\nuncle and myself. Hans, who was a man who never forgot even the minutest\nprecautions, had added to our baggage a large skin full of water, as an\naddition to our gourds. This assured us water for eight days.\n\nIt was nine o'clock in the morning when we were quite ready. The rector\nand his huge wife or servant, I never knew which, stood at the door to\nsee us off. They appeared to be about to inflict on us the usual final\nkiss of the Icelanders. To our supreme astonishment their adieu took the\nshape of a formidable bill, in which they even counted the use of the\npastoral house, really and truly the most abominable and dirty place I\never was in. The worthy couple cheated and robbed us like a Swiss\ninnkeeper, and made us feel, by the sum we had to pay, the splendors of\ntheir hospitality.\n\nMy uncle, however, paid without bargaining. A man who had made up his\nmind to undertake a voyage into the Interior of the Earth, is not the\nman to haggle over a few miserable rix-dollars.\n\nThis important matter settled, Hans gave the signal for departure, and\nsome few moments later we had left Stapi.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nTHE ASCENT OF MOUNT SNEFFELS\n\n\nThe huge volcano which was the first stage of our daring experiment is\nabove five thousand feet high. Sneffels is the termination of a long\nrange of volcanic mountains, of a different character to the system of\nthe island itself. One of its peculiarities is its two huge pointed\nsummits. From whence we started it was impossible to make out the real\noutlines of the peak against the grey field of sky. All we could\ndistinguish was a vast dome of white, which fell downwards from the head\nof the giant.\n\nThe commencement of the great undertaking filled me with awe. Now that\nwe had actually started, I began to believe in the reality of the\nundertaking!\n\nOur party formed quite a procession. We walked in single file, preceded\nby Hans, the imperturbable eider-duck hunter. He calmly led us by narrow\npaths where two persons could by no possibility walk abreast.\nConversation was wholly impossible. We had all the more opportunity to\nreflect and admire the awful grandeur of the scene around.\n\nBeyond the extraordinary basaltic wall of the fjord of Stapi we found\nourselves making our way through fibrous turf, over which grew a scanty\nvegetation of grass, the residuum of the ancient vegetation of the\nswampy peninsula. The vast mass of this combustible, the field of which\nas yet is utterly unexplored, would suffice to warm Iceland for a whole\ncentury. This mighty turf pit, measured from the bottom of certain\nravines, is often not less than seventy feet deep, and presents to the\neye the view of successive layers of black burned-up rocky detritus,\nseparated by thin streaks of porous sandstone.\n\nThe grandeur of the spectacle was undoubted, as well as its arid and\ndeserted air.\n\nAs a true nephew of the great Professor Hardwigg, and despite my\npreoccupation and doleful fears of what was to come, I observed with\ngreat interest the vast collection of mineralogical curiosities spread\nout before me in this vast museum of natural history. Looking back to my\nrecent studies, I went over in thought the whole geological history of\nIceland.\n\nThis extraordinary and curious island must have made its appearance from\nout of the great world of waters at a comparatively recent date. Like\nthe coral islands of the Pacific, it may, for aught we know, be still\nrising by slow and imperceptible degrees.\n\nIf this really be the case, its origin can be attributed to only one\ncause--that of the continued action of subterranean fires.\n\nThis was a happy thought.\n\nIf so, if this were true, away with the theories of Sir Humphry Davy;\naway with the authority of the parchment of Arne Saknussemm; the\nwonderful pretensions to discovery on the part of my uncle--and to our\njourney!\n\nAll must end in smoke.\n\nCharmed with the idea, I began more carefully to look about me. A\nserious study of the soil was necessary to negative or confirm my\nhypothesis. I took in every item of what I saw, and I began to\ncomprehend the succession of phenomena which had preceded its formation.\n\nIceland, being absolutely without sedimentary soil, is composed\nexclusively of volcanic tufa; that is to say, of an agglomeration of\nstones and of rocks of a porous texture. Long before the existence of\nvolcanoes, it was composed of a solid body of massive trap rock lifted\nbodily and slowly out of the sea, by the action of the centrifugal force\nat work in the earth.\n\nThe internal fires, however, had not as yet burst their bounds and\nflooded the exterior cake of Mother Earth with hot and raging lava.\n\nMy readers must excuse this brief and somewhat pedantic geological\nlecture. But it is necessary to the complete understanding of what\nfollows.\n\nAt a later period in the world's history, a huge and mighty fissure\nmust, reasoning by analogy, have been dug diagonally from the southwest\nto the northeast of the island, through which by degrees flowed the\nvolcanic crust. The great and wondrous phenomenon then went on without\nviolence--the outpouring was enormous, and the seething fused matter,\nejected from the bowels of the earth, spread slowly and peacefully in\nthe form of vast level plains, or what are called mamelons or mounds.\n\nIt was at this epoch that the rocks called feldspars, syenites, and\nporphyries appeared.\n\nBut as a natural consequence of this overflow, the depth of the island\nincreased. It can readily be believed what an enormous quantity of\nelastic fluids were piled up within its centre, when at last it afforded\nno other openings, after the process of cooling the crust had taken\nplace.\n\nAt length a time came when despite the enormous thickness and weight of\nthe upper crust, the mechanical forces of the combustible gases below\nbecame so great, that they actually upheaved the weighty back and made\nfor themselves huge and gigantic shafts. Hence the volcanoes which\nsuddenly arose through the upper crust, and next the craters, which\nburst forth at the summit of these new creations.\n\nIt will be seen that the first phenomena in connection with the\nformation of the island were simply eruptive; to these, however, shortly\nsucceeded the volcanic phenomena.\n\nThrough the newly formed openings, escaped the marvelous mass of\nbasaltic stones with which the plain we were now crossing was covered.\nWe were trampling our way over heavy rocks of dark grey color, which,\nwhile cooling, had been moulded into six-sided prisms. In the \"back\ndistance\" we could see a number of flattened cones, which formerly were\nso many fire-vomiting mouths.\n\nAfter the basaltic eruption was appeased and set at rest, the volcano,\nthe force of which increased with that of the extinct craters, gave free\npassage to the fiery overflow of lava, and to the mass of cinders and\npumice stone, now scattered over the sides of the mountain, like\ndisheveled hair on the shoulders of a Bacchante.\n\nHere, in a nutshell, I had the whole history of the phenomena from which\nIceland arose. All take their rise in the fierce action of interior\nfires, and to believe that the central mass did not remain in a state of\nliquid fire, white hot, was simply and purely madness.\n\nThis being satisfactorily proved (Q.E.D.), what insensate folly to\npretend to penetrate into the interior of the mighty earth!\n\nThis mental lecture delivered to myself while proceeding on a journey,\ndid me good. I was quite reassured as to the fate of our enterprise; and\ntherefore went, like a brave soldier mounting a bristling battery, to\nthe assault of old Sneffels.\n\nAs we advanced, the road became every moment more difficult. The soil\nwas broken and dangerous. The rocks broke and gave way under our feet,\nand we had to be scrupulously careful in order to avoid dangerous and\nconstant falls.\n\nHans advanced as calmly as if he had been walking over Salisbury Plain;\nsometimes he would disappear behind huge blocks of stone, and we\nmomentarily lost sight of him. There was a little period of anxiety and\nthen there was a shrill whistle, just to tell us where to look for him.\n\nOccasionally he would take it into his head to stop to pick up lumps of\nrock, and silently pile them up into small heaps, in order that we might\nnot lose our way on our return.\n\nHe had no idea of the journey we were about to undertake.\n\nAt all events, the precaution was a good one; though how utterly useless\nand unnecessary--but I must not anticipate.\n\nThree hours of terrible fatigue, walking incessantly, had only brought\nus to the foot of the great mountain. This will give some notion of what\nwe had still to undergo.\n\nSuddenly, however, Hans cried a halt--that is, he made signs to that\neffect--and a summary kind of breakfast was laid out on the lava before\nus. My uncle, who now was simply Professor Hardwigg, was so eager to\nadvance, that he bolted his food like a greedy clown. This halt for\nrefreshment was also a halt for repose. The Professor was therefore\ncompelled to wait the good pleasure of his imperturbable guide, who did\nnot give the signal for departure for a good hour.\n\nThe three Icelanders, who were as taciturn as their comrade, did not say\na word; but went on eating and drinking very quietly and soberly.\n\nFrom this, our first real stage, we began to ascend the slopes of the\nSneffels volcano. Its magnificent snowy nightcap, as we began to call\nit, by an optical delusion very common in mountains, appeared to me to\nbe close at hand; and yet how many long weary hours must elapse before\nwe reached its summit. What unheard-of fatigue must we endure!\n\nThe stones on the mountain side, held together by no cement of soil,\nbound together by no roots or creeping herbs, gave way continually under\nour feet, and went rushing below into the plains, like a series of small\navalanches.\n\nIn certain places the sides of this stupendous mountain were at an angle\nso steep that it was impossible to climb upwards, and we were compelled\nto get round these obstacles as best we might.\n\nThose who understand Alpine climbing will comprehend our difficulties.\nOften we were obliged to help each other along by means of our climbing\npoles.\n\nI must say this for my uncle, that he stuck as close to me as possible.\nHe never lost sight of me, and on many occasions his arm supplied me\nwith firm and solid support. He was strong, wiry, and apparently\ninsensible to fatigue. Another great advantage with him was that he had\nthe innate sentiment of equilibrium--for he never slipped or failed in\nhis steps. The Icelanders, though heavily loaded, climbed with the\nagility of mountaineers.\n\nLooking up, every now and then, at the height of the great volcano of\nSneffels, it appeared to me wholly impossible to reach to the summit on\nthat side; at all events, if the angle of inclination did not speedily\nchange.\n\nFortunately, after an hour of unheard-of fatigues, and of gymnastic\nexercises that would have been trying to an acrobat, we came to a vast\nfield of ice, which wholly surrounded the bottom of the cone of the\nvolcano. The natives called it the tablecloth, probably from some such\nreason as the dwellers in the Cape of Good Hope call their mountain\nTable Mountain, and their roads Table Bay.\n\nHere, to our mutual surprise, we found an actual flight of stone steps,\nwhich wonderfully assisted our ascent. This singular flight of stairs\nwas, like everything else, volcanic. It had been formed by one of those\ntorrents of stones cast up by the eruptions, and of which the Icelandic\nname is stina. If this singular torrent had not been checked in its\ndescent by the peculiar shape of the flanks of the mountain, it would\nhave swept into the sea, and would have formed new islands.\n\nSuch as it was, it served us admirably. The abrupt character of the\nslopes momentarily increased, but these remarkable stone steps, a little\nless difficult than those of the Egyptian pyramids, were the one simple\nnatural means by which we were enabled to proceed.\n\nAbout seven in the evening of that day, after having clambered up two\nthousand of these rough steps, we found ourselves overlooking a kind of\nspur or projection of the mountain--a sort of buttress upon which the\nconelike crater, properly so called, leaned for support.\n\nThe ocean lay beneath us at a depth of more than three thousand two\nhundred feet--a grand and mighty spectacle. We had reached the region of\neternal snows.\n\nThe cold was keen, searching and intense. The wind blew with\nextraordinary violence. I was utterly exhausted.\n\nMy worthy uncle, the Professor, saw clearly that my legs refused further\nservice, and that, in fact, I was utterly exhausted. Despite his hot and\nfeverish impatience, he decided, with a sigh, upon a halt. He called the\neider-duck hunter to his side. That worthy, however, shook his head.\n\n\"Ofvanfor,\" was his sole spoken reply.\n\n\"It appears,\" says my uncle with a woebegone look, \"that we must go\nhigher.\"\n\nHe then turned to Hans, and asked him to give some reason for this\ndecisive response.\n\n\"Mistour,\" replied the guide.\n\n\"Ja, mistour--yes, the mistour,\" cried one of the Icelandic guides in a\nterrified tone.\n\nIt was the first time he had spoken.\n\n\"What does this mysterious word signify?\" I anxiously inquired.\n\n\"Look,\" said my uncle.\n\nI looked down upon the plain below, and I saw a vast, a prodigious\nvolume of pulverized pumice stone, of sand, of dust, rising to the\nheavens in the form of a mighty waterspout. It resembled the fearful\nphenomenon of a similar character known to the travelers in the desert\nof the great Sahara.\n\nThe wind was driving it directly towards that side of Sneffels on which\nwe were perched. This opaque veil standing up between us and the sun\nprojected a deep shadow on the flanks of the mountain. If this sand\nspout broke over us, we must all be infallibly destroyed, crushed in its\nfearful embraces. This extraordinary phenomenon, very common when the\nwind shakes the glaciers, and sweeps over the arid plains, is in the\nIcelandic tongue called \"mistour.\"\n\n\"Hastigt, hastigt!\" cried our guide.\n\nNow I certainly knew nothing of Danish, but I thoroughly understood that\nhis gestures were meant to quicken us.\n\nThe guide turned rapidly in a direction which would take us to the back\nof the crater, all the while ascending slightly.\n\nWe followed rapidly, despite our excessive fatigue.\n\nA quarter of an hour later Hans paused to enable us to look back. The\nmighty whirlwind of sand was spreading up the slope of the mountain to\nthe very spot where we had proposed to halt. Huge stones were caught up,\ncast into the air, and thrown about as during an eruption. We were\nhappily a little out of the direction of the wind, and therefore out of\nreach of danger. But for the precaution and knowledge of our guide, our\ndislocated bodies, our crushed and broken limbs, would have been cast to\nthe wind, like dust from some unknown meteor.\n\nHans, however, did not think it prudent to pass the night on the bare\nside of the cone. We therefore continued our journey in a zigzag\ndirection. The fifteen hundred feet which remained to be accomplished\ntook us at least five hours. The turnings and windings, the\nno-thoroughfares, the marches and marches, turned that insignificant\ndistance into at least three leagues. I never felt such misery, fatigue\nand exhaustion in my life. I was ready to faint from hunger and cold.\nThe rarefied air at the same time painfully acted upon my lungs.\n\nAt last, when I thought myself at my last gasp, about eleven at night,\nit being in that region quite dark, we reached the summit of Mount\nSneffels! It was in an awful mood of mind, that despite my fatigue,\nbefore I descended into the crater which was to shelter us for the\nnight, I paused to behold the sun rise at midnight on the very day of\nits lowest declension, and enjoyed the spectacle of its ghastly pale\nrays cast upon the isle which lay sleeping at our feet!\n\nI no longer wondered at people traveling all the way from England to\nNorway to behold this magical and wondrous spectacle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nTHE SHADOW OF SCARTARIS\n\n\nOur supper was eaten with ease and rapidity, after which everybody did\nthe best he could for himself within the hollow of the crater. The bed\nwas hard, the shelter unsatisfactory, the situation painful--lying in\nthe open air, five thousand feet above the level of the sea!\n\nNevertheless, it has seldom happened to me to sleep so well as I did on\nthat particular night. I did not even dream. So much for the effects of\nwhat my uncle called \"wholesome fatigue.\"\n\nNext day, when we awoke under the rays of a bright and glorious sun, we\nwere nearly frozen by the keen air. I left my granite couch and made one\nof the party to enjoy a view of the magnificent spectacle which\ndeveloped itself, panorama-like, at our feet.\n\nI stood upon the lofty summit of Mount Sneffels' southern peak. Thence I\nwas able to obtain a view of the greater part of the island. The optical\ndelusion, common to all lofty heights, raised the shores of the island,\nwhile the central portions appeared depressed. It was by no means too\ngreat a flight of fancy to believe that a giant picture was stretched\nout before me. I could see the deep valleys that crossed each other in\nevery direction. I could see precipices looking like sides of wells,\nlakes that seemed to be changed into ponds, ponds that looked like\npuddles, and rivers that were transformed into petty brooks. To my right\nwere glaciers upon glaciers, and multiplied peaks, topped with light\nclouds of smoke.\n\nThe undulation of these infinite numbers of mountains, whose snowy\nsummits make them look as if covered by foam, recalled to my remembrance\nthe surface of a storm-beaten ocean. If I looked towards the west, the\nocean lay before me in all its majestic grandeur, a continuation as it\nwere, of these fleecy hilltops.\n\nWhere the earth ended and the sea began it was impossible for the eye to\ndistinguish.\n\nI soon felt that strange and mysterious sensation which is awakened in\nthe mind when looking down from lofty hilltops, and now I was able to do\nso without any feeling of nervousness, having fortunately hardened\nmyself to that kind of sublime contemplation.\n\nI wholly forgot who I was, and where I was. I became intoxicated with a\nsense of lofty sublimity, without thought of the abysses into which my\ndaring was soon about to plunge me. I was presently, however, brought\nback to the realities of life by the arrival of the Professor and Hans,\nwho joined me upon the lofty summit of the peak.\n\nMy uncle, turning in a westerly direction, pointed out to me a light\ncloud of vapor, a kind of haze, with a faint outline of land rising out\nof the waters.\n\n\"Greenland!\" said he.\n\n\"Greenland?\" cried I in reply.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued my uncle, who always when explaining anything spoke as\nif he were in a professor's chair; \"we are not more than thirty-five\nleagues distant from that wonderful land. When the great annual breakup\nof the ice takes place, white bears come over to Iceland, carried by the\nfloating masses of ice from the north. This, however, is a matter of\nlittle consequence. We are now on the summit of the great, the\ntranscendent Sneffels, and here are its two peaks, north and south. Hans\nwill tell you the name by which the people of Iceland call that on which\nwe stand.\"\n\nMy uncle turned to the imperturbable guide, who nodded, and spoke as\nusual--one word.\n\n\"Scartaris.\"\n\nMy uncle looked at me with a proud and triumphant glance.\n\n\"A crater,\" he said, \"you hear?\"\n\nI did hear, but I was totally unable to make reply.\n\nThe crater of Mount Sneffels represented an inverted cone, the gaping\norifice apparently half a mile across; the depth indefinite feet.\nConceive what this hole must have been like when full of flame and\nthunder and lightning. The bottom of the funnel-shaped hollow was about\nfive hundred feet in circumference, by which it will be seen that the\nslope from the summit to the bottom was very gradual, and we were\ntherefore clearly able to get there without much fatigue or difficulty.\nInvoluntarily, I compared this crater to an enormous loaded cannon; and\nthe comparison completely terrified me.\n\n\"To descend into the interior of a cannon,\" I thought to myself, \"when\nperhaps it is loaded, and will go off at the least shock, is the act of\na madman.\"\n\nBut there was no longer any opportunity for me to hesitate. Hans, with a\nperfectly calm and indifferent air, took his usual post at the head of\nthe adventurous little band. I followed without uttering a syllable.\n\nI felt like the lamb led to the slaughter.\n\nIn order to render the descent less difficult, Hans took his way down\nthe interior of the cone in rather a zigzag fashion, making, as the\nsailors say, long tracks to the eastward, followed by equally long ones\nto the west. It was necessary to walk through the midst of eruptive\nrocks, some of which, shaken in their balance, went rolling down with\nthundering clamor to the bottom of the abyss. These continual falls\nawoke echoes of singular power and effect.\n\nMany portions of the cone consisted of inferior glaciers. Hans, whenever\nhe met with one of these obstacles, advanced with a great show of\nprecaution, sounding the soil with his long iron pole in order to\ndiscover fissures and layers of deep soft snow. In many doubtful or\ndangerous places, it became necessary for us to be tied together by a\nlong rope in order that should any one of us be unfortunate enough to\nslip, he would be supported by his companions. This connecting link was\ndoubtless a prudent precaution, but not by any means unattended with\ndanger.\n\nNevertheless, and despite all the manifold difficulties of the descent,\nalong slopes with which our guide was wholly unacquainted, we made\nconsiderable progress without accident. One of our great parcels of rope\nslipped from one of the Iceland porters, and rushed by a short cut to\nthe bottom of the abyss.\n\nBy midday we were at the end of our journey. I looked upwards, and saw\nonly the upper orifice of the cone, which served as a circular frame to\na very small portion of the sky--a portion which seemed to me singularly\nbeautiful. Should I ever again gaze on that lovely sunlit sky!\n\nThe only exception to this extraordinary landscape, was the Peak of\nScartaris, which seemed lost in the great void of the heavens.\n\nThe bottom of the crater was composed of three separate shafts, through\nwhich, during periods of eruption, when Sneffels was in action, the\ngreat central furnace sent forth its burning lava and poisonous vapors.\nEach of these chimneys or shafts gaped open-mouthed in our path. I kept\nas far away from them as possible, not even venturing to take the\nfaintest peep downwards.\n\nAs for the Professor, after a rapid examination of their disposition and\ncharacteristics, he became breathless and panting. He ran from one to\nthe other like a delighted schoolboy, gesticulating wildly, and uttering\nincomprehensible and disjointed phrases in all sorts of languages.\n\nHans, the guide, and his humbler companions seated themselves on some\npiles of lava and looked silently on. They clearly took my uncle for a\nlunatic; and--waited the result.\n\nSuddenly the Professor uttered a wild, unearthly cry. At first I\nimagined he had lost his footing, and was falling headlong into one of\nthe yawning gulfs. Nothing of the kind. I saw him, his arms spread out\nto their widest extent, his legs stretched apart, standing upright\nbefore an enormous pedestal, high enough and black enough to bear a\ngigantic statue of Pluto. His attitude and mien were that of a man\nutterly stupefied. But his stupefaction was speedily changed to the\nwildest joy.\n\n\"Harry! Harry! come here!\" he cried; \"make haste--wonderful--wonderful!\"\n\nUnable to understand what he meant, I turned to obey his commands.\nNeither Hans nor the other Icelanders moved a step.\n\n\"Look!\" said the Professor, in something of the manner of the French\ngeneral, pointing out the pyramids to his army.\n\nAnd fully partaking his stupefaction, if not his joy, I read on the\neastern side of the huge block of stone, the same characters, half eaten\naway by the corrosive action of time, the name, to me a thousand times\naccursed--\n\n[Illustration: Runic Glyphs]\n\n\"Arne Saknussemm!\" cried my uncle, \"now, unbeliever, do you begin to\nhave faith?\"\n\nIt was totally impossible for me to answer a single word. I went back to\nmy pile of lava, in a state of silent awe. The evidence was\nunanswerable, overwhelming!\n\nIn a few moments, however, my thoughts were far away, back in my German\nhome, with Gretchen and the old cook. What would I have given for one of\nmy cousin's smiles, for one of the ancient domestic's omelettes, and for\nmy own feather bed!\n\nHow long I remained in this state I know not. All I can say is, that\nwhen at last I raised my head from between my hands, there remained at\nthe bottom of the crater only myself, my uncle and Hans. The Icelandic\nporters had been dismissed and were now descending the exterior slopes\nof Mount Sneffels, on their way to Stapi. How heartily did I wish myself\nwith them!\n\nHans slept tranquilly at the foot of a rock in a kind of rill of lava,\nwhere he had made himself a rough and ready bed. MY uncle was walking\nabout the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage. I had no\ndesire, neither had I the strength, to move from my recumbent position.\nTaking example by the guide, I gave way to a kind of painful somnolency,\nduring which I seemed both to hear and feel continued heavings and\nshudderings in the mountain.\n\nIn this way we passed our first night in the interior of a crater.\n\nNext morning, a grey, cloudy, heavy sky hung like a funereal pall over\nthe summit of the volcanic cone. I did not notice it so much from the\nobscurity that reigned around us, as from the rage with which my uncle\nwas devoured.\n\nI fully understood the reason, and again a glimpse of hope made my heart\nleap with joy. I will briefly explain the cause.\n\nOf the three openings which yawned beneath our steps, only one could\nhave been followed by the adventurous Saknussemm. According to the words\nof the learned Icelander, it was only to be known by that one particular\nmentioned in the cryptograph, that the shadow of Scartaris fell upon it,\njust touching its mouth in the last days of the month of June.\n\nWe were, in fact, to consider the pointed peak as the stylus of an\nimmense sun-dial, the shadow of which pointed on one given day, like the\ninexorable finger of fate, to the yawning chasm which led into the\ninterior of the earth.\n\nNow, as often happens in these regions, should the sun fail to burst\nthrough the clouds, no shadow. Consequently, no chance of discovering\nthe right aperture. We had already reached the 25th June. If the kindly\nheavens would only remain densely clouded for six more days, we should\nhave to put off our voyage of discovery for another year, when certainly\nthere would be one person fewer in the party. I already had sufficient\nof the mad and monstrous enterprise.\n\nIt would be utterly impossible to depict the impotent rage of Professor\nHardwigg. The day passed away, and not the faintest outline of a shadow\ncould be seen at the bottom of the crater. Hans the guide never moved\nfrom his place. He must have been curious to know what we were about, if\nindeed he could believe we were about anything. As for my uncle, he\nnever addressed a word to me. He was nursing his wrath to keep it warm!\nHis eyes fixed on the black and foggy atmosphere, his complexion hideous\nwith suppressed passion. Never had his eyes appeared so fierce, his nose\nso aquiline, his mouth so hard and firm.\n\nOn the 26th no change for the better. A mixture of rain and snow fell\nduring the whole day. Hans very quietly built himself a hut of lava into\nwhich he retired like Diogenes into his tub. I took a malicious delight\nin watching the thousand little cascades that flowed down the side of\nthe cone, carrying with them at times a stream of stones into the \"vasty\ndeep\" below.\n\nMy uncle was almost frantic: to be sure, it was enough to make even a\npatient man angry. He had reached to a certain extent the goal of his\ndesires, and yet he was likely to be wrecked in port.\n\nBut if the heavens and the elements are capable of causing us much pain\nand sorrow, there are two sides to a medal. And there was reserved for\nProfessor Hardwigg a brilliant and sudden surprise which was to\ncompensate him for all his sufferings.\n\nNext day the sky was still overcast, but on Sunday, the 28th, the last\nday but two of the month, with a sudden change of wind and a new moon\nthere came a change of weather. The sun poured its beaming rays to the\nvery bottom of the crater.\n\nEach hillock, every rock, every stone, every asperity of the soil had\nits share of the luminous effulgence, and its shadow fell heavily on the\nsoil. Among others, to his insane delight, the shadow of Scartaris was\nmarked and clear, and moved slowly with the radiant start of day.\n\nMy uncle moved with it in a state of mental ecstasy.\n\nAt twelve o'clock exactly, when the sun had attained its highest\naltitude for the day, the shadow fell upon the edge of the central pit!\n\n\"Here it is,\" gasped the Professor in an agony of joy, \"here it is--we\nhave found it. Forward, my friends, into the Interior of the Earth.\"\n\nI looked curiously at Hans to see what reply he would make to this\nterrific announcement.\n\n\"Forut,\" said the guide tranquilly.\n\n\"Forward it is,\" answered my uncle, who was now in the seventh heaven of\ndelight.\n\nWhen we were quite ready, our watches indicated thirteen minutes past\none!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nTHE REAL JOURNEY COMMENCES\n\n\nOur real journey had now commenced. Hitherto our courage and\ndetermination had overcome all difficulties. We were fatigued at times;\nand that was all. Now we were about to encounter unknown and fearful\ndangers.\n\nI had not as yet ventured to take a glimpse down the horrible abyss into\nwhich in a few minutes more I was about to plunge. The fatal moment had,\nhowever, at last arrived. I had still the option of refusing or\naccepting a share in this foolish and audacious enterprise. But I was\nashamed to show more fear than the eider-duck hunter. Hans seemed to\naccept the difficulties of the journey so tranquilly, with such calm\nindifference, with such perfect recklessness of all danger, that I\nactually blushed to appear less of a man than he!\n\nHad I been alone with my uncle, I should certainly have sat down and\nargued the point fully; but in the presence of the guide I held my\ntongue. I gave one moment to the thought of my charming cousin, and then\nI advanced to the mouth of the central shaft.\n\nIt measured about a hundred feet in diameter, which made about three\nhundred in circumference. I leaned over a rock which stood on its edge,\nand looked down. My hair stood on end, my teeth chattered, my limbs\ntrembled. I seemed utterly to lose my centre of gravity, while my head\nwas in a sort of whirl, like that of a drunken man. There is nothing\nmore powerful than this attraction towards an abyss. I was about to fall\nheadlong into the gaping well, when I was drawn back by a firm and\npowerful hand. It was that of Hans. I had not taken lessons enough at\nthe Frelser's-Kirk of Copenhagen in the art of looking down from lofty\neminences without blinking!\n\nHowever, few as the minutes were during which I gazed down this\ntremendous and even wondrous shaft, I had a sufficient glimpse of it to\ngive me some idea of its physical conformation. Its sides, which were\nalmost as perpendicular as those of a well, presented numerous\nprojections which doubtless would assist our descent.\n\nIt was a sort of wild and savage staircase, without bannister or fence.\nA rope fastened above, near the surface, would certainly support our\nweight and enable us to reach the bottom, but how, when we had arrived\nat its utmost depth, were we to loosen it above? This was, I thought, a\nquestion of some importance.\n\nMy uncle, however, was one of those men who are nearly always prepared\nwith expedients. He hit upon a very simple method of obviating this\ndifficulty. He unrolled a cord about as thick as my thumb, and at least\nfour hundred feet in length. He allowed about half of it to go down the\npit and catch in a hitch over a great block of lava which stood on the\nedge of the precipice. This done, he threw the second half after the\nfirst.\n\nEach of us could now descend by catching the two cords in one hand. When\nabout two hundred feet below, all the explorer had to do was to let go\none end and pull away at the other, when the cord would come falling at\nhis feet. In order to go down farther, all that was necessary was to\ncontinue the same operation.\n\nThis was a very excellent proposition, and no doubt, a correct one.\nGoing down appeared to me easy enough; it was the coming up again that\nnow occupied my thoughts.\n\n\"Now,\" said my uncle, as soon as he had completed this important\npreparation, \"let us see about the baggage. It must be divided into\nthree separate parcels, and each of us must carry one on his back. I\nallude to the more important and fragile articles.\"\n\nMy worthy and ingenious uncle did not appear to consider that we came\nunder the denomination.\n\n\"Hans,\" he continued, \"you will take charge of the tools and some of the\nprovisions; you, Harry, must take possession of another third of the\nprovisions and of the arms. I will load myself with the rest of the\neatables, and with the more delicate instruments.\"\n\n\"But,\" I exclaimed, \"our clothes, this mass of cord and ladders--who\nwill undertake to carry them down?\"\n\n\"They will go down of themselves.\"\n\n\"And how so?\" I asked.\n\n\"You shall see.\"\n\nMy uncle was not fond of half measures, nor did he like anything in the\nway of hesitation. Giving his orders to Hans he had the whole of the\nnonfragile articles made up into one bundle; and the packet, firmly and\nsolidly fastened, was simply pitched over the edge of the gulf.\n\nI heard the moaning of the suddenly displaced air, and the noise of\nfalling stones. My uncle leaning over the abyss followed the descent of\nhis luggage with a perfectly self-satisfied air, and did not rise until\nit had completely disappeared from sight.\n\n\"Now then,\" he cried, \"it is our turn.\"\n\nI put it in good faith to any man of common sense--was it possible to\nhear this energetic cry without a shudder?\n\nThe Professor fastened his case of instruments on his back. Hans took\ncharge of the tools, I of the arms. The descent then commenced in the\nfollowing order: Hans went first, my uncle followed, and I went last.\nOur progress was made in profound silence--a silence only troubled by\nthe fall of pieces of rock, which breaking from the jagged sides, fell\nwith a roar into the depths below.\n\nI allowed myself to slide, so to speak, holding frantically on the\ndouble cord with one hand and with the other keeping myself off the\nrocks by the assistance of my iron-shod pole. One idea was all the time\nimpressed upon my brain. I feared that the upper support would fail me.\nThe cord appeared to me far too fragile to bear the weight of three such\npersons as we were, with our luggage. I made as little use of it as\npossible, trusting to my own agility and doing miracles in the way of\nfeats of dexterity and strength upon the projecting shelves and spurs of\nlava which my feet seemed to clutch as strongly as my hands.\n\nThe guide went first, I have said, and when one of the slippery and\nfrail supports broke from under his feet he had recourse to his usual\nmonosyllabic way of speaking.\n\n\"Gif akt--\"\n\n\"Attention--look out,\" repeated my uncle.\n\nIn about half an hour we reached a kind of small terrace formed by a\nfragment of rock projecting some distance from the sides of the shaft.\n\nHans now began to haul upon the cord on one side only, the other going\nas quietly upward as the other came down. It fell at last, bringing with\nit a shower of small stones, lava and dust, a disagreeable kind of rain\nor hail.\n\nWhile we were seated on this extraordinary bench I ventured once more to\nlook downwards. With a sigh I discovered that the bottom was still\nwholly invisible. Were we, then, going direct to the interior of the\nearth?\n\nThe performance with the cord recommenced, and a quarter of an hour\nlater we had reached to the depth of another two hundred feet.\n\nI have very strong doubts if the most determined geologist would, during\nthat descent, have studied the nature of the different layers of earth\naround him. I did not trouble my head much about the matter; whether we\nwere among the combustible carbon, Silurians, or primitive soil, I\nneither knew nor cared to know.\n\nNot so the inveterate Professor. He must have taken notes all the way\ndown, for, at one of our halts, he began a brief lecture.\n\n\"The farther we advance,\" said he, \"the greater is my confidence in the\nresult. The disposition of these volcanic strata absolutely confirms the\ntheories of Sir Humphry Davy. We are still within the region of the\nprimordial soil, the soil in which took place the chemical operation of\nmetals becoming inflamed by coming in contact with the air and water. I\nat once regret the old and now forever exploded theory of a central\nfire. At all events, we shall soon know the truth.\"\n\nSuch was the everlasting conclusion to which he came. I, however, was\nvery far from being in humor to discuss the matter. I had something else\nto think of. My silence was taken for consent; and still we continued to\ngo down.\n\nAt the expiration of three hours, we were, to all appearance, as far off\nas ever from the bottom of the well. When I looked upwards, however, I\ncould see that the upper orifice was every minute decreasing in size.\nThe sides of the shaft were getting closer and closer together, we were\napproaching the regions of eternal night!\n\nAnd still we continued to descend!\n\nAt length, I noticed that when pieces of stone were detached from the\nsides of this stupendous precipice, they were swallowed up with less\nnoise than before. The final sound was sooner heard. We were approaching\nthe bottom of the abyss!\n\nAs I had been very careful to keep account of all the changes of cord\nwhich took place, I was able to tell exactly what was the depth we had\nreached, as well as the time it had taken.\n\nWe had shifted the rope twenty-eight times, each operation taking a\nquarter of an hour, which in all made seven hours. To this had to be\nadded twenty-eight pauses; in all ten hours and a half. We started at\none, it was now, therefore, about eleven o'clock at night.\n\nIt does not require great knowledge of arithmetic to know that\ntwenty-eight times two hundred feet makes five thousand six hundred feet\nin all (more than an English mile).\n\nWhile I was making this mental calculation a voice broke the silence. It\nwas the voice of Hans.\n\n\"Halt!\" he cried.\n\nI checked myself very suddenly, just at the moment when I was about to\nkick my uncle on the head.\n\n\"We have reached the end of our journey,\" said the worthy Professor in a\nsatisfied tone.\n\n\"What, the interior of the earth?\" said I, slipping down to his side.\n\n\"No, you stupid fellow! but we have reached the bottom of the well.\"\n\n\"And I suppose there is no farther progress to be made?\" I hopefully\nexclaimed.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I can dimly see a sort of tunnel, which turns off obliquely to\nthe right. At all events, we must see about that tomorrow. Let us sup\nnow, and seek slumber as best we may.\"\n\nI thought it time, but made no observations on that point. I was fairly\nlaunched on a desperate course, and all I had to do was to go forward\nhopefully and trustingly.\n\nIt was not even now quite dark, the light filtering down in a most\nextraordinary manner.\n\nWe opened the provision bag, ate a frugal supper, and each did his best\nto find a bed amid the pile of stones, dirt, and lava which had\naccumulated for ages at the bottom of the shaft.\n\nI happened to grope out the pile of ropes, ladders, and clothes which we\nhad thrown down; and upon them I stretched myself. After such a day's\nlabor, my rough bed seemed as soft as down!\n\nFor a while I lay in a sort of pleasant trance.\n\nPresently, after lying quietly for some minutes, I opened my eyes and\nlooked upwards. As I did so I made out a brilliant little dot, at the\nextremity of this long, gigantic telescope.\n\nIt was a star without scintillating rays. According to my calculation,\nit must be Beta in the constellation of the Little Bear.\n\nAfter this little bit of astronomical recreation, I dropped into a sound\nsleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\nWE CONTINUE OUR DESCENT\n\n\nAt eight o'clock the next morning, a faint kind of dawn of day awoke us.\nThe thousand and one prisms of the lava collected the light as it passed\nand brought it to us like a shower of sparks.\n\nWe were able with ease to see objects around us.\n\n\"Well, Harry, my boy,\" cried the delighted Professor, rubbing his hands\ntogether, \"what say you now? Did you ever pass a more tranquil night in\nour house in the Konigstrasse? No deafening sounds of cart wheels, no\ncries of hawkers, no bad language from boatmen or watermen!\"\n\n\"Well, Uncle, we are quite at the bottom of this well--but to me there\nis something terrible in this calm.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said the Professor hotly, \"one would say you were already\nbeginning to be afraid. How will you get on presently? Do you know, that\nas yet, we have not penetrated one inch into the bowels of the earth.\"\n\n\"What can you mean, sir?\" was my bewildered and astonished reply.\n\n\"I mean to say that we have only just reached the soil of the island\nitself. This long vertical tube, which ends at the bottom of the crater\nof Sneffels, ceases here just about on a level with the sea.\"\n\n\"Are you sure, sir?\"\n\n\"Quite sure. Consult the barometer.\"\n\nIt was quite true that the mercury, after rising gradually in the\ninstrument, as long as our descent was taking place, had stopped\nprecisely at twenty-nine degrees.\n\n\"You perceive,\" said the Professor, \"we have as yet only to endure the\npressure of air. I am curious to replace the barometer by the\nmanometer.\"\n\nThe barometer, in fact, was about to become useless--as soon as the\nweight of the air was greater than what was calculated as above the\nlevel of the ocean.\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"is it not very much to be feared that this\never-increasing pressure may not in the end turn out very painful and\ninconvenient?\"\n\n\"No,\" said he. \"We shall descend very slowly, and our lungs will be\ngradually accustomed to breathe compressed air. It is well known that\naeronauts have gone so high as to be nearly without air at all--why,\nthen, should we not accustom ourselves to breathe when we have, say, a\nlittle too much of it? For myself, I am certain I shall prefer it. Let\nus not lose a moment. Where is the packet which preceded us in our\ndescent?\"\n\nI smilingly pointed it out to my uncle. Hans had not seen it, and\nbelieved it caught somewhere above us: \"Huppe\" as he phrased it.\n\n\"Now,\" said my uncle, \"let us breakfast, and break fast like people who\nhave a long day's work before them.\"\n\nBiscuit and dried meat, washed down by some mouthfuls of water flavored\nwith Schiedam, was the material of our luxurious meal.\n\nAs soon as it was finished, my uncle took from his pocket a notebook\ndestined to be filled by memoranda of our travels. He had already placed\nhis instruments in order, and this is what he wrote:\n\n\n     Monday, June 29th\n\n     Chronometer, 8h. 17m. morning.\n\n     Barometer, 29.6 inches.\n\n     Thermometer, 6 degrees [43 degrees Fahr.]\n\n     Direction, E.S.E.\n\n\n\nThis last observation referred to the obscure gallery, and was indicated\nto us by the compass.\n\n\"Now, Harry,\" cried the Professor, in an enthusiastic tone of voice, \"we\nare truly about to take our first step into the Interior of the Earth;\nnever before visited by man since the first creation of the world. You\nmay consider, therefore, that at this precise moment our travels really\ncommence.\"\n\nAs my uncle made this remark, he took in one hand the Ruhmkorff coil\napparatus, which hung round his neck, and with the other he put the\nelectric current into communication with the worm of the lantern. And a\nbright light at once illumined that dark and gloomy tunnel!\n\nThe effect was magical!\n\nHans, who carried the second apparatus, had it also put into operation.\nThis ingenious application of electricity to practical purposes enabled\nus to move along by the light of an artificial day, amid even the flow\nof the most inflammable and combustible gases.\n\n\"Forward!\" cried my uncle. Each took up his burden. Hans went first, my\nuncle followed, and I going third, we entered the somber gallery!\n\nJust as we were about to engulf ourselves in this dismal passage, I\nlifted up my head, and through the tubelike shaft saw that Iceland sky I\nwas never to see again!\n\nWas it the last I should ever see of any sky?\n\nThe stream of lava flowing from the bowels of the earth in 1219 had\nforced itself a passage through the tunnel. It lined the whole of the\ninside with its thick and brilliant coating. The electric light added\nvery greatly to the brilliancy of the effect.\n\nThe great difficulty of our journey now began. How were we to prevent\nourselves from slipping down the steeply inclined plane? Happily some\ncracks, abrasures of the soil, and other irregularities, served the\nplace of steps; and we descended slowly; allowing our heavy luggage to\nslip on before, at the end of a long cord.\n\nBut that which served as steps under our feet became in other places\nstalactites. The lava, very porous in certain places, took the form of\nlittle round blisters. Crystals of opaque quartz, adorned with limpid\ndrops of natural glass suspended to the roof like lusters, seemed to\ntake fire as we passed beneath them. One would have fancied that the\ngenii of romance were illuminating their underground palaces to receive\nthe sons of men.\n\n\"Magnificent, glorious!\" I cried in a moment of involuntary enthusiasm,\n\"What a spectacle, Uncle! Do you not admire these variegated shades of\nlava, which run through a whole series of colors, from reddish brown to\npale yellow--by the most insensible degrees? And these crystals, they\nappear like luminous globes.\"\n\n\"You are beginning to see the charms of travel, Master Harry,\" cried my\nuncle. \"Wait a bit, until we advance farther. What we have as yet\ndiscovered is nothing--onwards, my boy, onwards!\"\n\nIt would have been a far more correct and appropriate expression, had he\nsaid, \"let us slide,\" for we were going down an inclined plane with\nperfect ease. The compass indicated that we were moving in a\nsoutheasterly direction. The flow of lava had never turned to the right\nor the left. It had the inflexibility of a straight line.\n\nNevertheless, to my surprise, we found no perceptible increase in heat.\nThis proved the theories of Humphry Davy to be founded on truth, and\nmore than once I found myself examining the thermometer in silent\nastonishment.\n\nTwo hours after our departure it only marked fifty-four degrees\nFahrenheit. I had every reason to believe from this that our descent was\nfar more horizontal than vertical. As for discovering the exact depth to\nwhich we had attained, nothing could be easier. The Professor as he\nadvanced measured the angles of deviation and inclination; but he kept\nthe result of his observations to himself.\n\nAbout eight o'clock in the evening, my uncle gave the signal for\nhalting. Hans seated himself on the ground. The lamps were hung to\nfissures in the lava rock. We were now in a large cavern where air was\nnot wanting. On the contrary, it abounded. What could be the cause of\nthis--to what atmospheric agitation could be ascribed this draught? But\nthis was a question which I did not care to discuss just then. Fatigue\nand hunger made me incapable of reasoning. An unceasing march of seven\nhours had not been kept up without great exhaustion. I was really and\ntruly worn out; and delighted enough I was to hear the word Halt.\n\nHans laid out some provisions on a lump of lava, and we each supped with\nkeen relish. One thing, however, caused us great uneasiness--our water\nreserve was already half exhausted. My uncle had full confidence in\nfinding subterranean resources, but hitherto we had completely failed in\nso doing. I could not help calling my uncle's attention to the\ncircumstance.\n\n\"And you are surprised at this total absence of springs?\" he said.\n\n\"Doubtless--I am very uneasy on the point. We have certainly not enough\nwater to last us five days.\"\n\n\"Be quite easy on that matter,\" continued my uncle. \"I answer for it we\nshall find plenty of water--in fact, far more than we shall want.\"\n\n\"But when?\"\n\n\"When we once get through this crust of lava. How can you expect springs\nto force their way through these solid stone walls?\"\n\n\"But what is there to prove that this concrete mass of lava does not\nextend to the centre of the earth? I don't think we have as yet done\nmuch in a vertical way.\"\n\n\"What puts that into your head, my boy?\" asked my uncle mildly.\n\n\"Well, it appears to me that if we had descended very far below the\nlevel of the sea--we should find it rather hotter than we have.\"\n\n\"According to your system,\" said my uncle; \"but what does the\nthermometer say?\"\n\n\"Scarcely fifteen degrees by Reaumur, which is only an increase of nine\nsince our departure.\"\n\n\"Well, and what conclusion does that bring you to?\" inquired the\nProfessor.\n\n\"The deduction I draw from this is very simple. According to the most\nexact observations, the augmentation of the temperature of the interior\nof the earth is one degree for every hundred feet. But certain local\ncauses may considerably modify this figure. Thus at Yakoust in Siberia,\nit has been remarked that the heat increases a degree every thirty-six\nfeet. The difference evidently depends on the conductibility of certain\nrocks. In the neighborhood of an extinct volcano, it has been remarked\nthat the elevation of temperature was only one degree in every\nfive-and-twenty feet. Let us, then, go upon this calculation--which is\nthe most favorable--and calculate.\"\n\n\"Calculate away, my boy.\"\n\n\"Nothing easier,\" said I, pulling out my notebook and pencil. \"Nine\ntimes one hundred and twenty-five feet make a depth of eleven hundred\nand twenty-five feet.\"\n\n\"Archimedes could not have spoken more geometrically.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, according to my observations, we are at least ten thousand feet\nbelow the level of the sea.\"\n\n\"Can it be possible?\"\n\n\"Either my calculation is correct, or there is no truth in figures.\"\n\nThe calculations of the Professor were perfectly correct. We were\nalready six thousand feet deeper down in the bowels of the earth than\nanyone had ever been before. The lowest known depth to which man had\nhitherto penetrated was in the mines of Kitzbuhel, in the Tirol, and\nthose of Wurttemberg.\n\nThe temperature, which should have been eighty-one, was in this place\nonly fifteen. This was a matter for serious consideration.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\nTHE EASTERN TUNNEL\n\n\nThe next day was Tuesday, the 30th of June--and at six o'clock in the\nmorning we resumed our journey.\n\nWe still continued to follow the gallery of lava, a perfect natural\npathway, as easy of descent as some of those inclined planes which, in\nvery old German houses, serve the purpose of staircases. This went on\nuntil seventeen minutes past twelve, the precise instant at which we\nrejoined Hans, who, having been somewhat in advance, had suddenly\nstopped.\n\n\"At last,\" cried my uncle, \"we have reached the end of the shaft.\"\n\nI looked wonderingly about me. We were in the centre of four cross\npaths--somber and narrow tunnels. The question now arose as to which it\nwas wise to take; and this of itself was no small difficulty.\n\nMy uncle, who did not wish to appear to have any hesitation about the\nmatter before myself or the guide, at once made up his mind. He pointed\nquietly to the eastern tunnel; and, without delay, we entered within its\ngloomy recesses.\n\nBesides, had he entertained any feeling of hesitation it might have been\nprolonged indefinitely, for there was no indication by which to\ndetermine on a choice. It was absolutely necessary to trust to chance\nand good fortune!\n\nThe descent of this obscure and narrow gallery was very gradual and\nwinding. Sometimes we gazed through a succession of arches, its course\nvery like the aisles of a Gothic cathedral. The great artistic sculptors\nand builders of the Middle Ages might have here completed their studies\nwith advantage. Many most beautiful and suggestive ideas of\narchitectural beauty would have been discovered by them. After passing\nthrough this phase of the cavernous way, we suddenly came, about a mile\nfarther on, upon a square system of arch, adopted by the early Romans,\nprojecting from the solid rock, and keeping up the weight of the roof.\n\nSuddenly we would come upon a series of low subterranean tunnels which\nlooked like beaver holes, or the work of foxes--through whose narrow and\nwinding ways we had literally to crawl!\n\nThe heat still remained at quite a supportable degree. With an\ninvoluntary shudder, I reflected on what the heat must have been when\nthe volcano of Sneffels was pouring its smoke, flames, and streams of\nboiling lava--all of which must have come up by the road we were now\nfollowing. I could imagine the torrents of hot seething stone darting\non, bubbling up with accompaniments of smoke, steam, and sulphurous\nstench!\n\n\"Only to think of the consequences,\" I mused, \"if the old volcano were\nonce more to set to work.\"\n\nI did not communicate these rather unpleasant reflections to my uncle.\nHe not only would not have understood them, but would have been\nintensely disgusted. His only idea was to go ahead. He walked, he slid,\nhe clambered over piles of fragments, he rolled down heaps of broken\nlava, with an earnestness and conviction it was impossible not to\nadmire.\n\nAt six o'clock in the evening, after a very wearisome journey, but one\nnot so fatiguing as before, we had made six miles towards the southward,\nbut had not gone more than a mile downwards.\n\nMy uncle, as usual, gave the signal to halt. We ate our meal in\nthoughtful silence, and then retired to sleep.\n\nOur arrangements for the night were very primitive and simple. A\ntraveling rug, in which each rolled himself, was all our bedding. We had\nno necessity to fear cold or any unpleasant visit. Travelers who bury\nthemselves in the wilds and depths of the African desert, who seek\nprofit and pleasure in the forests of the New World, are compelled to\ntake it in turn to watch during the hours of sleep; but in this region\nof the earth absolute solitude and complete security reigned supreme.\n\nWe had nothing to fear either from savages or from wild beasts.\n\nAfter a night's sweet repose, we awoke fresh and ready for action. There\nbeing nothing to detain us, we started on our journey. We continued to\nburrow through the lava tunnel as before. It was impossible to make out\nthrough what soil we were making way. The tunnel, moreover, instead of\ngoing down into the bowels of the earth, became absolutely horizontal.\n\nI even thought, after some examination, that we were actually tending\nupwards. About ten o'clock in the day this state of things became so\nclear that, finding the change very fatiguing, I was obliged to slacken\nmy pace and finally come to a halt.\n\n\"Well,\" said the Professor quickly, \"what is the matter?\"\n\n\"The fact is, I am dreadfully tired,\" was my earnest reply.\n\n\"What,\" cried my uncle, \"tired after a three hours' walk, and by so easy\na road?\"\n\n\"Easy enough, I dare say, but very fatiguing.\"\n\n\"But how can that be, when all we have to do is to go downwards.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir. For some time I have noticed that we are going\nupwards.\"\n\n\"Upwards,\" cried my uncle, shrugging his shoulders, \"how can that be?\"\n\n\"There can be no doubt about it. For the last half hour the slopes have\nbeen upward--and if we go on in this way much longer we shall find\nourselves back in Iceland.\"\n\nMy uncle shook his head with the air of a man who does not want to be\nconvinced. I tried to continue the conversation. He would not answer me,\nbut once more gave the signal for departure. His silence I thought was\nonly caused by concentrated ill-temper.\n\nHowever this might be, I once more took up my load, and boldly and\nresolutely followed Hans, who was now in advance of my uncle. I did not\nlike to be beaten or even distanced. I was naturally anxious not to lose\nsight of my companions. The very idea of being left behind, lost in that\nterrible labyrinth, made me shiver as with the ague.\n\nBesides, if the ascending path was more arduous and painful to clamber,\nI had one source of secret consolation and delight. It was to all\nappearance taking us back to the surface of the earth. That of itself\nwas hopeful. Every step I took confirmed me in my belief, and I began\nalready to build castles in the air in relation to my marriage with my\npretty little cousin.\n\nAbout twelve o'clock there was a great and sudden change in the aspect\nof the rocky sides of the gallery. I first noticed it from the\ndiminution of the rays of light which cast back the reflection of the\nlamp. From being coated with shining and resplendent lava, it became\nliving rock. The sides were sloping walls, which sometimes became quite\nvertical.\n\nWe were now in what the geological professors call a state of\ntransition, in the period of Silurian stones, so called because this\nspecimen of early formation is very common in England in the counties\nformerly inhabited by the Celtic nation known as Silures.\n\n\"I can see clearly now,\" I cried; \"the sediment from the waters which\nonce covered the whole earth formed during the second period of its\nexistence these schists and these calcareous rocks. We are turning our\nbacks on the granite rocks, and are like people from Hamburg who would\ngo to Lubeck by way of Hanover.\"\n\nI might just as well have kept my observations to myself. My geological\nenthusiasm got the better, however, of my cooler judgment, and Professor\nHardwigg heard my observations.\n\n\"What is the matter now?\" he said, in a tone of great gravity.\n\n\"Well,\" cried I, \"do you not see these different layers of calcareous\nrocks and the first indication of slate strata?\"\n\n\"Well; what then?\"\n\n\"We have arrived at that period of the world's existence when the first\nplants and the first animals made their appearance.\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"Yes, look; examine and judge for yourself.\"\n\nI induced the Professor with some difficulty to cast the light of his\nlamp on the sides of the long winding gallery. I expected some\nexclamation to burst from his lips. I was very much mistaken. The worthy\nProfessor never spoke a word.\n\nIt was impossible to say whether he understood me or not. Perhaps it was\npossible that in his pride--my uncle and a learned professor--he did not\nlike to own that he was wrong in having chosen the eastern tunnel, or\nwas he determined at any price to go to the end of it? It was quite\nevident we had left the region of lava, and that the road by which we\nwere going could not take us back to the great crater of Mount Sneffels.\n\nAs we went along I could not help ruminating on the whole question, and\nasked myself if I did not lay too great a stress on these sudden and\npeculiar modifications of the earth's crust.\n\nAfter all, I was very likely to be mistaken--and it was within the range\nof probability and possibility that we were not making our way through\nthe strata of rocks which I believed I recognized piled on the lower\nlayer of granitic formation.\n\n\"At all events, if I am right,\" I thought to myself, \"I must certainly\nfind some remains of primitive plants, and it will be absolutely\nnecessary to give way to such indubitable evidence. Let us have a good\nsearch.\"\n\nI accordingly lost no opportunity of searching, and had not gone more\nthan about a hundred yards, when the evidence I sought for cropped up in\nthe most incontestable manner before my eyes. It was quite natural that\nI should expect to find these signs, for during the Silurian period the\nseas contained no fewer than fifteen hundred different animal and\nvegetable species. My feet, so long accustomed to the hard and arid lava\nsoil, suddenly found themselves treading on a kind of soft dust, the\nremains of plants and shells.\n\nUpon the walls themselves I could clearly make out the outline, as plain\nas a sun picture, of the fucus and the lycopods. The worthy and\nexcellent Professor Hardwigg could not of course make any mistake about\nthe matter; but I believe he deliberately closed his eyes, and continued\non his way with a firm and unalterable step.\n\nI began to think that he was carrying his obstinacy a great deal too\nfar. I could no longer act with prudence or composure. I stooped on a\nsudden and picked up an almost perfect shell, which had undoubtedly\nbelonged to some animal very much resembling some of the present day.\nHaving secured the prize, I followed in the wake of my uncle.\n\n\"Do you see this?\" I said.\n\n\"Well, said the Professor, with the most imperturbable tranquillity, \"it\nis the shell of a crustaceous animal of the extinct order of the\ntrilobites; nothing more, I assure you.\"\n\n\"But,\" cried I, much troubled at his coolness, \"do you draw no\nconclusion from it?\"\n\n\"Well, if I may ask, what conclusion do you draw from it yourself?\"\n\n\"Well, I thought--\"\n\n\"I know, my boy, what you would say, and you are right, perfectly and\nincontestably right. We have finally abandoned the crust of lava and the\nroad by which the lava ascended. It is quite possible that I may have\nbeen mistaken, but I shall be unable to discover my error until I get to\nthe end of this gallery.\"\n\n\"You are quite right as far as that is concerned,\" I replied, \"and I\nshould highly approve of your decision, if we had not to fear the\ngreatest of all dangers.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"Want of water.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear Henry, it can't be helped. We must put ourselves on\nrations.\"\n\nAnd on he went.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\nDEEPER AND DEEPER--THE COAL MINE\n\n\nIn truth, we were compelled to put ourselves upon rations. Our supply\nwould certainly last not more than three days. I found this out about\nsupper time. The worst part of the matter was that, in what is called\nthe transition rocks, it was hardly to be expected we should meet with\nwater!\n\nI had read of the horrors of thirst, and I knew that where we were, a\nbrief trial of its sufferings would put an end to our adventures--and\nour lives! But it was utterly useless to discuss the matter with my\nuncle. He would have answered by some axiom from Plato.\n\nDuring the whole of next day we proceeded on our journey through this\ninterminable gallery, arch after arch, tunnel after tunnel. We journeyed\nwithout exchanging a word. We had become as mute and reticent as Hans,\nour guide.\n\nThe road had no longer an upward tendency; at all events, if it had, it\nwas not to be made out very clearly. Sometimes there could be no doubt\nthat we were going downwards. But this inclination was scarcely to be\ndistinguished, and was by no means reassuring to the Professor, because\nthe character of the strata was in no wise modified, and the transition\ncharacter of the rocks became more and more marked.\n\nIt was a glorious sight to see how the electric light brought out the\nsparkles in the walls of the calcareous rocks, and the old red\nsandstone. One might have fancied oneself in one of those deep cuttings\nin Devonshire, which have given their name to this kind of soil. Some\nmagnificent specimens of marble projected from the sides of the gallery:\nsome of an agate grey with white veins of variegated character, others\nof a yellow spotted color, with red veins; farther off might be seen\nsamples of color in which cherry-tinted seams were to be found in all\ntheir brightest shades.\n\nThe greater number of these marbles were stamped with the marks of\nprimitive animals. Since the previous evening, nature and creation had\nmade considerable progress. Instead of the rudimentary trilobites, I\nperceived the remains of a more perfect order. Among others, the fish in\nwhich the eye of a geologist has been able to discover the first form of\nthe reptile.\n\nThe Devonian seas were inhabited by a vast number of animals of this\nspecies, which were deposited in tens of thousands in the rocks of new\nformation.\n\nIt was quite evident to me that we were ascending the scale of animal\nlife of which man forms the summit. My excellent uncle, the Professor,\nappeared not to take notice of these warnings. He was determined at any\nrisk to proceed.\n\nHe must have been in expectation of one of two things; either that a\nvertical well was about to open under his feet, and thus allow him to\ncontinue his descent, or that some insurmountable obstacle would compel\nus to stop and go back by the road we had so long traveled. But evening\ncame again, and, to my horror, neither hope was doomed to be realized!\n\nOn Friday, after a night when I began to feel the gnawing agony of\nthirst, and when in consequence appetite decreased, our little band rose\nand once more followed the turnings and windings, the ascents and\ndescents, of this interminable gallery. All were silent and gloomy. I\ncould see that even my uncle had ventured too far.\n\nAfter about ten hours of further progress--a progress dull and\nmonotonous to the last degree--I remarked that the reverberation, and\nreflection of our lamps upon the sides of the tunnel, had singularly\ndiminished. The marble, the schist, the calcareous rocks, the red\nsandstone, had disappeared, leaving in their places a dark and gloomy\nwall, somber and without brightness. When we reached a remarkably narrow\npart of the tunnel, I leaned my left hand against the rock.\n\nWhen I took my hand away, and happened to glance at it, it was quite\nblack. We had reached the coal strata of the Central Earth.\n\n\"A coal mine!\" I cried.\n\n\"A coal mine without miners,\" responded my uncle, a little severely.\n\n\"How can we tell?\"\n\n\"I can tell,\" replied my uncle, in a sharp and doctorial tone. \"I am\nperfectly certain that this gallery through successive layers of coal\nwas not cut by the hand of man. But whether it is the work of nature or\nnot is of little concern to us. The hour for our evening meal has\ncome--let us sup.\"\n\nHans, the guide, occupied himself in preparing food. I had come to that\npoint when I could no longer eat. All I cared about were the few drops\nof water which fell to my share. What I suffered it is useless to\nrecord. The guide's gourd, not quite half full, was all that was left\nfor us three!\n\nHaving finished their repast, my two companions laid themselves down\nupon their rugs, and found in sleep a remedy for their fatigue and\nsufferings. As for me, I could not sleep, I lay counting the hours until\nmorning.\n\nThe next morning, Saturday, at six o'clock, we started again. Twenty\nminutes later we suddenly came upon a vast excavation. From its mighty\nextent I saw at once that the hand of man could have had nothing to do\nwith this coal mine; the vault above would have fallen in; as it was, it\nwas only held together by some miracle of nature.\n\nThis mighty natural cavern was about a hundred feet wide, by about a\nhundred and fifty high. The earth had evidently been cast apart by some\nviolent subterranean commotion. The mass, giving way to some prodigious\nupheaving of nature, had split in two, leaving the vast gap into which\nwe inhabitants of the earth had penetrated for the first time.\n\nThe whole singular history of the coal period was written on those dark\nand gloomy walls. A geologist would have been able easily to follow the\ndifferent phases of its formation. The seams of coal were separated by\nstrata of sandstone, a compact clay, which appeared to be crushed down\nby the weight from above.\n\nAt that period of the world which preceded the secondary epoch, the\nearth was covered by a coating of enormous and rich vegetation, due to\nthe double action of tropical heat and perpetual humidity. A vast\natmospheric cloud of vapor surrounded the earth on all sides, preventing\nthe rays of the sun from ever reaching it.\n\nHence the conclusion that these intense heats did not arise from this\nnew source of caloric.\n\nPerhaps even the star of day was not quite ready for its brilliant\nwork--to illumine a universe. Climates did not as yet exist, and a level\nheat pervaded the whole surface of the globe--the same heat existing at\nthe North Pole as at the equator.\n\nWhence did it come? From the interior of the earth?\n\nIn spite of all the learned theories of Professor Hardwigg, a fierce and\nvehement fire certainly burned within the entrails of the great\nspheroid. Its action was felt even to the very topmost crust of the\nearth; the plants then in existence, being deprived of the vivifying\nrays of the sun, had neither buds, nor flowers, nor odor, but their\nroots drew a strong and vigorous life from the burning earth of early\ndays.\n\nThere were but few of what may be called trees--only herbaceous plants,\nimmense turfs, briers, mosses, rare families, which, however, in those\ndays were counted by tens and tens of thousands.\n\nIt is entirely to this exuberant vegetation that coal owes its origin.\nThe crust of the vast globe still yielded under the influence of the\nseething, boiling mass, which was forever at work beneath. Hence arose\nnumerous fissures, and continual falling in of the upper earth. The\ndense mass of plants being beneath the waters, soon formed themselves\ninto vast agglomerations.\n\nThen came about the action of natural chemistry; in the depths of the\nocean the vegetable mass at first became turf, then, thanks to the\ninfluence of gases and subterranean fermentation, they underwent the\ncomplete process of mineralization.\n\nIn this manner, in early days, were formed those vast and prodigious\nlayers of coal, which an ever--increasing consumption must utterly use\nup in about three centuries more, if people do not find some more\neconomic light than gas, and some cheaper motive power than steam.\n\nAll these reflections, the memories of my school studies, came to my\nmind while I gazed upon these mighty accumulations of coal, whose\nriches, however, are scarcely likely to be ever utilized. The working of\nthese mines could only be carried out at an expense that would never\nyield a profit.\n\nThe matter, however, is scarcely worthy consideration, when coal is\nscattered over the whole surface of the globe, within a few yards of the\nupper crust. As I looked at these untouched strata, therefore, I knew\nthey would remain as long as the world lasts.\n\nWhile we still continued our journey, I alone forgot the length of the\nroad, by giving myself up wholly to these geological considerations. The\ntemperature continued to be very much the same as while we were\ntraveling amid the lava and the schists. On the other hand my sense of\nsmell was much affected by a very powerful odor. I immediately knew that\nthe gallery was filled to overflowing with that dangerous gas the miners\ncall fire damp, the explosion of which has caused such fearful and\nterrible accidents, making a hundred widows and hundreds of orphans in a\nsingle hour.\n\nHappily, we were able to illumine our progress by means of the Ruhmkorff\napparatus. If we had been so rash and imprudent as to explore this\ngallery, torch in hand, a terrible explosion would have put an end to\nour travels, simply because no travelers would be left.\n\nOur excursion through this wondrous coal mine in the very bowels of the\nearth lasted until evening. My uncle was scarcely able to conceal his\nimpatience and dissatisfaction at the road continuing still to advance\nin a horizontal direction.\n\nThe darkness, dense and opaque a few yards in advance and in the rear,\nrendered it impossible to make out what was the length of the gallery.\nFor myself, I began to believe that it was simply interminable, and\nwould go on in the same manner for months.\n\nSuddenly, at six o'clock, we stood in front of a wall. To the right, to\nthe left above, below, nowhere was there any passage. We had reached a\nspot where the rocks said in unmistakable accents--No Thoroughfare.\n\nI stood stupefied. The guide simply folded his arms. My uncle was\nsilent.\n\n\"Well, well, so much the better,\" cried my uncle, at last, \"I now know\nwhat we are about. We are decidedly not upon the road followed by\nSaknussemm. All we have to do is to go back. Let us take one night's\ngood rest, and before three days are over, I promise you we shall have\nregained the point where the galleries divided.\"\n\n\"Yes, we may, if our strength lasts as long,\" I cried, in a lamentable\nvoice.\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow, among us three, there will not be a drop of water. It is just\ngone.\"\n\n\"And your courage with it,\" said my uncle, speaking in a severe tone.\n\nWhat could I say? I turned round on my side, and from sheer exhaustion\nfell into a heavy sleep disturbed by dreams of water! And I awoke\nunrefreshed.\n\nI would have bartered a diamond mine for a glass of pure spring water!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\nTHE WRONG ROAD!\n\n\nNext day, our departure took place at a very early hour. There was no\ntime for the least delay. According to my account, we had five days'\nhard work to get back to the place where the galleries divided.\n\nI can never tell all the sufferings we endured upon our return. My uncle\nbore them like a man who has been in the wrong--that is, with\nconcentrated and suppressed anger; Hans, with all the resignation of his\npacific character; and I--I confess that I did nothing but complain, and\ndespair. I had no heart for this bad fortune.\n\nBut there was one consolation. Defeat at the outset would probably upset\nthe whole journey!\n\nAs I had expected from the first, our supply of water gave completely\nout on our first day's march. Our provision of liquids was reduced to\nour supply of Schiedam; but this horrible--nay, I will say it--this\ninfernal liquor burnt the throat, and I could not even bear the sight of\nit. I found the temperature to be stifling. I was paralyzed with\nfatigue. More than once I was about to fall insensible to the ground.\nThe whole party then halted, and the worthy Icelander and my excellent\nuncle did their best to console and comfort me. I could, however,\nplainly see that my uncle was contending painfully against the extreme\nfatigues of our journey, and the awful torture generated by the absence\nof water.\n\nAt length a time came when I ceased to recollect anything--when all was\none awfull hideous, fantastic dream!\n\nAt last, on Tuesday, the seventh of the month of July, after crawling on\nour hands and knees for many hours, more dead than alive, we reached the\npoint of junction between the galleries. I lay like a log, an inert mass\nof human flesh on the arid lava soil. It was then ten in the morning.\n\nHans and my uncle, leaning against the wall, tried to nibble away at\nsome pieces of biscuit, while deep groans and sighs escaped from my\nscorched and swollen lips. Then I fell off into a kind of deep lethargy.\n\nPresently I felt my uncle approach, and lift me up tenderly in his arms.\n\n\"Poor boy,\" I heard him say in a tone of deep commiseration.\n\nI was profoundly touched by these words, being by no means accustomed to\nsigns of womanly weakness in the Professor. I caught his trembling hands\nin mine and gave them a gentle pressure. He allowed me to do so without\nresistance, looking at me kindly all the time. His eyes were wet with\ntears.\n\nI then saw him take the gourd which he wore at his side. To my surprise,\nor rather to my stupefaction, he placed it to my lips.\n\n\"Drink, my boy,\" he said.\n\nWas it possible my ears had not deceived me? Was my uncle mad? I looked\nat him, with, I am sure, quite an idiotic expression. I could not\nbelieve him. I too much feared the counteraction of disappointment.\n\n\"Drink,\" he said again.\n\nHad I heard aright? Before, however, I could ask myself the question a\nsecond time, a mouthful of water cooled my parched lips and throat--one\nmouthful, but I do believe it brought me back to life.\n\nI thanked my uncle by clasping my hands. My heart was too full to speak.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"one mouthful of water, the very last--do you hear, my\nboy--the very last! I have taken care of it at the bottom of my bottle\nas the apple of my eye. Twenty times, a hundred times, I have resisted\nthe fearful desire to drink it. But--no--no, Harry, I saved it for you.\"\n\n\"My dear uncle,\" I exclaimed, and the big tears rolled down my hot and\nfeverish cheeks.\n\n\"Yes, my poor boy, I knew that when you reached this place, this\ncrossroad in the earth, you would fall down half dead, and I saved my\nlast drop of water in order to restore you.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I cried; \"thanks from my heart.\"\n\nAs little as my thirst was really quenched, I had nevertheless partially\nrecovered my strength. The contracted muscles of my throat relaxed--and\nthe inflammation of my lips in some measure subsided. At all events, I\nwas able to speak.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"there can be no doubt now as to what we have to do.\nWater has utterly failed us; our journey is therefore at an end. Let us\nreturn.\"\n\nWhile I spoke thus, my uncle evidently avoided my face: he held down his\nhead; his eyes were turned in every possible direction but the right\none.\n\n\"Yes,\" I continued, getting excited by my own words, \"we must go back to\nSneffels. May heaven give us strength to enable us once more to revisit\nthe light of day. Would that we now stood on the summit of the crater.\"\n\n\"Go back,\" said my uncle, speaking to himself, \"and must it be so?\"\n\n\"Go back--yes, and without losing a single moment,\" I vehemently cried.\n\nFor some moments there was silence under that dark and gloomy vault.\n\n\"So, my dear Harry,\" said the Professor in a very singular tone of\nvoice, \"those few drops of water have not sufficed to restore your\nenergy and courage.\"\n\n\"Courage!\" I cried.\n\n\"I see that you are quite as downcast as before--and still give way to\ndiscouragement and despair.\"\n\nWhat, then, was the man made of, and what other projects were entering\nhis fertile and audacious brain!\n\n\"You are not discouraged, sir?\"\n\n\"What! Give up just as we are on the verge of success?\" he cried.\n\"Never, never shall it be said that Professor Hardwigg retreated.\"\n\n\"Then we must make up our minds to perish,\" I cried with a helpless\nsigh.\n\n\"No, Harry, my boy, certainly not. Go, leave me, I am very far from\ndesiring your death. Take Hans with you. <i>I will go on alone.</i>\"\n\n\"You ask us to leave you?\"\n\n\"Leave me, I say. I have undertaken this dangerous and perilous\nadventure. I will carry it to the end--or I will never return to the\nsurface of Mother Earth. Go, Harry--once more I say to you--go!\"\n\nMy uncle as he spoke was terribly excited. His voice, which before had\nbeen tender, almost womanly, became harsh and menacing. He appeared to\nbe struggling with desperate energy against the impossible. I did not\nwish to abandon him at the bottom of that abyss, while, on the other\nhand, the instinct of preservation told me to fly.\n\nMeanwhile, our guide was looking on with profound calmness and\nindifference. He appeared to be an unconcerned party, and yet he\nperfectly well knew what was going on between us. Our gestures\nsufficiently indicated the different roads each wished to follow--and\nwhich each tried to influence the other to undertake. But Hans appeared\nnot to take the slightest interest in what was really a question of life\nand death for us all, but waited quite ready to obey the signal which\nshould say go aloft, or to resume his desperate journey into the\ninterior of the earth.\n\nHow then I wished with all my heart and soul that I could make him\nunderstand my words. My representations, my sighs and groans, the\nearnest accents in which I should have spoken would have convinced that\ncold, hard nature. Those fearful dangers and perils of which the stolid\nguide had no idea, I would have pointed them out to him--I would have,\nas it were, made him see and feel. Between us, we might have convinced\nthe obstinate Professor. If the worst had come to the worst, we could\nhave compelled him to return to the summit of Sneffels.\n\nI quietly approached Hans. I caught his hand in mine. He never moved a\nmuscle. I indicated to him the road to the top of the crater. He\nremained motionless. My panting form, my haggard countenance, must have\nindicated the extent of my sufferings. The Icelander gently shook his\nhead and pointed to my uncle.\n\n\"Master,\" he said.\n\nThe word is Icelandic as well as English.\n\n\"The master!\" I cried, beside myself with fury--\"madman! no--I tell you\nhe is not the master of our lives; we must fly! we must drag him with\nus! do you hear me? Do you understand me, I say?\"\n\nI have already explained that I held Hans by the arm. I tried to make\nhim rise from his seat. I struggled with him and tried to force him\naway. My uncle now interposed.\n\n\"My good Henry, be calm,\" he said. \"You will obtain nothing from my\ndevoted follower; therefore, listen to what I have to say.\"\n\nI folded my arms, as well as I could, and looked my uncle full in the\nface.\n\n\"This wretched want of water,\" he said, \"is the sole obstacle to the\nsuccess of my project. In the entire gallery, made of lava, schist, and\ncoal, it is true we found not one liquid molecule. It is quite possible\nthat we may be more fortunate in the western tunnel.\"\n\nMy sole reply was to shake my head with an air of deep incredulity.\n\n\"Listen to me to the end,\" said the Professor in his well-known\nlecturing voice. \"While you lay yonder without life or motion, I\nundertook a reconnoitering journey into the conformation of this other\ngallery. I have discovered that it goes directly downwards into the\nbowels of the earth, and in a few hours will take us to the old granitic\nformation. In this we shall undoubtedly find innumerable springs. The\nnature of the rock makes this a mathematical certainty, and instinct\nagrees with logic to say that it is so. Now, this is the serious\nproposition which I have to make to you. When Christopher Columbus asked\nof his men three days to discover the land of promise, his men ill,\nterrified, and hopeless, yet gave him three days--and the New World was\ndiscovered. Now I, the Christopher Columbus of this subterranean region,\nonly ask of you one more day. If, when that time is expired, I have not\nfound the water of which we are in search, I swear to you, I will give\nup my mighty enterprise and return to the earth's surface.\"\n\nDespite my irritation and despair, I knew how much it cost my uncle to\nmake this proposition, and to hold such conciliatory language. Under the\ncircumstances, what could I do but yield?\n\n\"Well,\" I cried, \"let it be as you wish, and may heaven reward your\nsuperhuman energy. But as, unless we discover water, our hours are\nnumbered, let us lose no time, but go ahead.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\nTHE WESTERN GALLERY--A NEW ROUTE\n\n\nOur descent was now resumed by means of the second gallery. Hans took up\nhis post in front as usual. We had not gone more than a hundred yards\nwhen the Professor carefully examined the walls.\n\n\"This is the primitive formation--we are on the right road--onwards is\nour hope!\"\n\nWhen the whole earth got cool in the first hours of the world's morning,\nthe diminution of the volume of the earth produced a state of\ndislocation in its upper crust, followed by ruptures, crevasses and\nfissures. The passage was a fissure of this kind, through which, ages\nago, had flowed the eruptive granite. The thousand windings and turnings\nformed an inextricable labyrinth through the ancient soil.\n\nAs we descended, successions of layers composing the primitive soil\nappeared with the utmost fidelity of detail. Geological science\nconsiders this primitive soil as the base of the mineral crust, and it\nhas recognized that it is composed of three different strata or layers,\nall resting on the immovable rock known as granite.\n\nNo mineralogists had even found themselves placed in such a marvelous\nposition to study nature in all her real and naked beauty. The sounding\nrod, a mere machine, could not bring to the surface of the earth the\nobjects of value for the study of its internal structure, which we were\nabout to see with our own eyes, to touch with our own hands.\n\nRemember that I am writing this after the journey.\n\nAcross the streak of the rocks, colored by beautiful green tints, wound\nmetallic threads of copper, of manganese, with traces of platinum and\ngold. I could not help gazing at these riches buried in the entrails of\nMother Earth, and of which no man would have the enjoyment to the end of\ntime! These treasures--mighty and inexhaustible, were buried in the\nmorning of the earth's history, at such awful depths, that no crowbar or\npickax will ever drag them from their tomb!\n\nThe light of our Ruhmkorff's coil, increased tenfold by the myriad of\nprismatic masses of rock, sent its jets of fire in every direction, and\nI could fancy myself traveling through a huge hollow diamond, the rays\nof which produced myriads of extraordinary effects.\n\nTowards six o'clock, this festival of light began sensibly and visibly\nto decrease, and soon almost ceased. The sides of the gallery assumed a\ncrystallized tint, with a somber hue; white mica began to commingle more\nfreely with feldspar and quartz, to form what may be called the true\nrock--the stone which is hard above all, that supports, without being\ncrushed, the four stories of the earth's soil.\n\nWe were walled by an immense prison of granite!\n\nIt was now eight o'clock, and still there was no sign of water. The\nsufferings I endured were horrible. My uncle now kept at the head of our\nlittle column. Nothing could induce him to stop. I, meanwhile, had but\none real thought. My ear was keenly on the watch to catch the sound of a\nspring. But no pleasant sound of falling water fell upon my listening\near.\n\nBut at last the time came when my limbs refused to carry me longer. I\ncontended heroically against the terrible tortures I endured, because I\ndid not wish to compel my uncle to halt. To him I knew this would be the\nlast fatal stroke.\n\nSuddenly I felt a deadly faintness come over me. My eyes could no longer\nsee; my knees shook. I gave one despairing cry--and fell!\n\n\"Help, help, I am dying!\"\n\nMy uncle turned and slowly retraced his steps. He looked at me with\nfolded arms, and then allowed one sentence to escape, in hollow accents,\nfrom his lips:\n\n\"All is over.\"\n\nThe last thing I saw was a face fearfully distorted with pain and\nsorrow; and then my eyes closed.\n\n\nWhen I again opened them, I saw my companions lying near me, motionless,\nwrapped in their huge traveling rugs. Were they asleep or dead? For\nmyself, sleep was wholly out of the question. My fainting fit over, I\nwas wakeful as the lark. I suffered too much for sleep to visit my\neyelids--the more, that I thought myself sick unto death--dying. The\nlast words spoken by my uncle seemed to be buzzing in my ears--all is\nover! And it was probable that he was right. In the state of prostration\nto which I was reduced, it was madness to think of ever again seeing the\nlight of day.\n\nAbove were miles upon miles of the earth's crust. As I thought of it, I\ncould fancy the whole weight resting on my shoulders. I was crushed,\nannihilated! and exhausted myself in vain attempts to turn in my granite\nbed.\n\nHours upon hours passed away. A profound and terrible silence reigned\naround us--a silence of the tomb. Nothing could make itself heard\nthrough these gigantic walls of granite. The very thought was\nstupendous.\n\nPresently, despite my apathy, despite the kind of deadly calm into which\nI was cast, something aroused me. It was a slight but peculiar noise.\nWhile I was watching intently, I observed that the tunnel was becoming\ndark. Then gazing through the dim light that remained, I thought I saw\nthe Icelander taking his departure, lamp in hand.\n\nWhy had he acted thus? Did Hans the guide mean to abandon us? My uncle\nlay fast asleep--or dead. I tried to cry out, and arouse him. My voice,\nfeebly issuing from my parched and fevered lips, found no echo in that\nfearful place. My throat was dry, my tongue stuck to the roof of my\nmouth. The obscurity had by this time become intense, and at last even\nthe faint sound of the guide's footsteps was lost in the blank distance.\nMy soul seemed filled with anguish, and death appeared welcome, only let\nit come quickly.\n\n\"Hans is leaving us,\" I cried. \"Hans--Hans, if you are a man, come\nback.\"\n\nThese words were spoken to myself. They could not be heard aloud.\nNevertheless, after the first few moments of terror were over, I was\nashamed of my suspicions against a man who hitherto had behaved so\nadmirably. Nothing in his conduct or character justified suspicion.\nMoreover, a moment's reflection reassured me. His departure could not be\na flight. Instead of ascending the gallery, he was going deeper down\ninto the gulf. Had he had any bad design, his way would have been\nupwards.\n\nThis reasoning calmed me a little and I began to hope!\n\nThe good, and peaceful, and imperturbable Hans would certainly not have\narisen from his sleep without some serious and grave motive. Was he bent\non a voyage of discovery? During the deep, still silence of the night\nhad he at last heard that sweet murmur about which we were all so\nanxious?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\nWATER, WHERE IS IT? A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT\n\n\nDuring a long, long, weary hour, there crossed my wildly delirious brain\nall sorts of reasons as to what could have aroused our quiet and\nfaithful guide. The most absurd and ridiculous ideas passed through my\nhead, each more impossible than the other. I believe I was either half\nor wholly mad.\n\nSuddenly, however, there arose, as it were from the depths of the earth,\na voice of comfort. It was the sound of footsteps! Hans was returning.\n\nPresently the uncertain light began to shine upon the walls of the\npassage, and then it came in view far down the sloping tunnel. At length\nHans himself appeared.\n\nHe approached my uncle, placed his hand upon his shoulder, and gently\nawakened him. My uncle, as soon as he saw who it was, instantly arose.\n\n\"Well!\" exclaimed the Professor.\n\n\"Vatten,\" said the hunter.\n\nI did not know a single word of the Danish language, and yet by a sort\nof mysterious instinct I understood what the guide had said.\n\n\"Water, water!\" I cried, in a wild and frantic tone, clapping my hands,\nand gesticulating like a madman.\n\n\"Water!\" murmured my uncle, in a voice of deep emotion and gratitude.\n\"Hvar?\" (\"Where?\")\n\n\"Nedat.\" (\"Below.\")\n\n\"Where? below!\" I understood every word. I had caught the hunter by the\nhands, and I shook them heartily, while he looked on with perfect\ncalmness.\n\nThe preparations for our departure did not take long, and we were soon\nmaking a rapid descent into the tunnel.\n\nAn hour later we had advanced a thousand yards, and descended two\nthousand feet.\n\nAt this moment I heard an accustomed and well-known sound running along\nthe floors of the granite rock--a kind of dull and sullen roar, like\nthat of a distant waterfall.\n\nDuring the first half hour of our advance, not finding the discovered\nspring, my feelings of intense suffering appeared to return. Once more I\nbegan to lose all hope. My uncle, however, observing how downhearted I\nwas again becoming, took up the conversation.\n\n\"Hans was right,\" he exclaimed enthusiastically; \"that is the dull\nroaring of a torrent.\"\n\n\"A torrent,\" I cried, delighted at even hearing the welcome words.\n\n\"There's not the slightest doubt about it,\" he replied, \"a subterranean\nriver is flowing beside us.\"\n\nI made no reply, but hastened on, once more animated by hope. I began\nnot even to feel the deep fatigue which hitherto had overpowered me. The\nvery sound of this glorious murmuring water already refreshed me. We\ncould hear it increasing in volume every moment. The torrent, which for\na long time could be heard flowing over our heads, now ran distinctly\nalong the left wall, roaring, rushing, spluttering, and still falling.\n\nSeveral times I passed my hand across the rock hoping to find some trace\nof humidity--of the slightest percolation. Alas! in vain.\n\nAgain a half hour passed in the same weary toil. Again we advanced.\n\nIt now became evident that the hunter, during his absence, had not been\nable to carry his researches any farther. Guided by an instinct peculiar\nto the dwellers in mountain regions and water finders, he \"smelt\" the\nliving spring through the rock. Still he had not seen the precious\nliquid. He had neither quenched his own thirst, nor brought us one drop\nin his gourd.\n\nMoreover, we soon made the disastrous discovery that, if our progress\ncontinued, we should soon be moving away from the torrent, the sound of\nwhich gradually diminished. We turned back. Hans halted at the precise\nspot where the sound of the torrent appeared nearest.\n\nI could bear the suspense and suffering no longer, and seated myself\nagainst the wall, behind which I could hear the water seething and\neffervescing not two feet away. But a solid wall of granite still\nseparated us from it!\n\nHans looked keenly at me, and, strange enough, for once I thought I saw\na smile on his imperturbable face.\n\nHe rose from a stone on which he had been seated, and took up the lamp.\nI could not help rising and following. He moved slowly along the firm\nand solid granite wall. I watched him with mingled curiosity and\neagerness. Presently he halted and placed his ear against the dry stone,\nmoving slowly along and listening with the most extreme care and\nattention. I understood at once that he was searching for the exact spot\nwhere the torrent's roar was most plainly heard. This point he soon\nfound in the lateral wall on the left side, about three feet above the\nlevel of the tunnel floor.\n\nI was in a state of intense excitement. I scarcely dared believe what\nthe eider-duck hunter was about to do. It was, however, impossible in a\nmoment more not to both understand and applaud, and even to smother him\nin my embraces, when I saw him raise the heavy crowbar and commence an\nattack upon the rock itself.\n\n\"Saved!\" I cried.\n\n\"Yes,\" cried my uncle, even more excited and delighted than myself;\n\"Hans is quite right. Oh, the worthy, excellent man! We should never\nhave thought of such an idea.\"\n\nAnd nobody else, I think, would have done so. Such a process, simple as\nit seemed, would most certainly not have entered our heads. Nothing\ncould be more dangerous than to begin to work with pickaxes in that\nparticular part of the globe. Supposing while he was at work a break-up\nwere to take place, and supposing the torrent once having gained an inch\nwere to take an ell, and come pouring bodily through the broken rock!\n\nNot one of these dangers was chimerical. They were only too real. But at\nthat moment no fear of falling in of the roof, or even of inundation was\ncapable of stopping us. Our thirst was so intense that to quench it we\nwould have dug below the bed of old Ocean itself.\n\nHans went quietly to work--a work which neither my uncle nor I would\nhave undertaken at any price. Our impatience was so great that if we had\nonce begun with pickax and crowbar, the rock would soon have split into\na hundred fragments. The guide, on the contrary, calm, ready, moderate,\nwore away the hard rock by little steady blows of his instrument, making\nno attempt at a larger hole than about six inches. As I stood, I heard,\nor I thought I heard, the roar of the torrent momentarily increasing in\nloudness, and at times I almost felt the pleasant sensation of water\nupon my parched lips.\n\nAt the end of what appeared an age, Hans had made a hole which enabled\nhis crowbar to enter two feet into the solid rock. He had been at work\nexactly an hour. It appeared a dozen. I was getting wild with\nimpatience. My uncle began to think of using more violent measures. I\nhad the greatest difficulty in checking him. He had indeed just got hold\nof his crowbar when a loud and welcome hiss was heard. Then a stream, or\nrather jet, of water burst through the wall and came out with such force\nas to hit the opposite side!\n\nHans, the guide, who was half upset by the shock, was scarcely able to\nkeep down a cry of pain and grief. I understood his meaning when,\nplunging my hands into the sparkling jet, I myself gave a wild and\nfrantic cry. The water was scalding hot!\n\n\"Boiling,\" I cried, in bitter disappointment.\n\n\"Well, never mind,\" said my uncle, \"it will soon get cool.\"\n\nThe tunnel began to be filled by clouds of vapor, while a small stream\nran away into the interior of the earth. In a short time we had some\nsufficiently cool to drink. We swallowed it in huge mouthfuls.\n\nOh! what exalted delight--what rich and incomparable luxury! What was\nthis water, whence did it come? To us what was that? The simple fact\nwas--it was water; and, though still with a tingle of warmth about it,\nit brought back to the heart, that life which, but for it, must surely\nhave faded away. I drank greedily, almost without tasting it.\n\nWhen, however, I had almost quenched my ravenous thirst, I made a\ndiscovery.\n\n\"Why, it is chalybeate water!\"\n\n\"A most excellent stomachic,\" replied my uncle, \"and highly mineralized.\nHere is a journey worth twenty to Spa.\"\n\n\"It's very good,\" I replied.\n\n\"I should think so. Water found six miles under ground. There is a\npeculiarly inky flavor about it, which is by no means disagreeable. Hans\nmay congratulate himself on having made a rare discovery. What do you\nsay, nephew, according to the usual custom of travelers, to name the\nstream after him?\"\n\n\"Good,\" said I. And the name of \"Hansbach\" (\"Hans Brook\") was at once\nagreed upon.\n\nHans was not a bit more proud after hearing our determination than he\nwas before. After having taken a very small modicum of the welcome\nrefreshment, he had seated himself in a corner with his usual\nimperturbable gravity.\n\n\"Now,\" said I, \"it is not worth while letting this water run to waste.\"\n\n\"What is the use,\" replied my uncle, \"the source from which this river\nrises is inexhaustible.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" I continued, \"let us fill our goatskin and gourds, and\nthen try to stop the opening up.\"\n\nMy advice, after some hesitation, was followed or attempted to be\nfollowed. Hans picked up all the broken pieces of granite he had knocked\nout, and using some tow he happened to have about him, tried to shut up\nthe fissure he had made in the wall. All he did was to scald his hands.\nThe pressure was too great, and all our attempts were utter failures.\n\n\"It is evident,\" I remarked, \"that the upper surface of these springs is\nsituated at a very great height above--as we may fairly infer from the\ngreat pressure of the jet.\"\n\n\"That is by no means doubtful,\" replied my uncle, \"if this column of\nwater is about thirty-two thousand feet high, the atmospheric pressure\nmust be something enormous. But a new idea has just struck me.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"Why be at so much trouble to close this aperture?\"\n\n\"Because--\"\n\nI hesitated and stammered, having no real reason.\n\n\"When our water bottles are empty, we are not at all sure that we shall\nbe able to fill them,\" observed my uncle.\n\n\"I think that is very probable.\"\n\n\"Well, then, let this water run. It will, of course, naturally follow in\nour track, and will serve to guide and refresh us.\"\n\n\"I think the idea a good one,\" I cried in reply, \"and with this rivulet\nas a companion, there is no further reason why we should not succeed in\nour marvelous project.\"\n\n\"Ah, my boy,\" said the Professor, laughing, \"after all, you are coming\nround.\"\n\n\"More than that, I am now confident of ultimate success.\"\n\n\"One moment, nephew mine. Let us begin by taking some hours of repose.\"\n\nI had utterly forgotten that it was night. The chronometer, however,\ninformed me of the fact. Soon we were sufficiently restored and\nrefreshed, and had all fallen into a profound sleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\nUNDER THE OCEAN\n\n\nBy the next day we had nearly forgotten our past sufferings. The first\nsensation I experienced was surprise at not being thirsty, and I\nactually asked myself the reason. The running stream, which flowed in\nrippling wavelets at my feet, was the satisfactory reply.\n\nWe breakfasted with a good appetite, and then drank our fill of the\nexcellent water. I felt myself quite a new man, ready to go anywhere my\nuncle chose to lead. I began to think. Why should not a man as seriously\nconvinced as my uncle, succeed, with so excellent a guide as worthy\nHans, and so devoted a nephew as myself? These were the brilliant ideas\nwhich now invaded my brain. Had the proposition now been made to go back\nto the summit of Mount Sneffels, I should have declined the offer in a\nmost indignant manner.\n\nBut fortunately there was no question of going up. We were about to\ndescend farther into the interior of the earth.\n\n\"Let us be moving,\" I cried, awakening the echoes of the old world.\n\nWe resumed our march on Thursday at eight o'clock in the morning. The\ngreat granite tunnel, as it went round by sinuous and winding ways,\npresented every now and then sharp turns, and in fact all the appearance\nof a labyrinth. Its direction, however, was in general towards the\nsouthwest. My uncle made several pauses in order to consult his compass.\n\nThe gallery now began to trend downwards in a horizontal direction, with\nabout two inches of fall in every furlong. The murmuring stream flowed\nquietly at our feet. I could not but compare it to some familiar spirit,\nguiding us through the earth, and I dabbled my fingers in its tepid\nwater, which sang like a naiad as we progressed. My good humor began to\nassume a mythological character.\n\nAs for my uncle he began to complain of the horizontal character of the\nroad. His route, he found, began to be indefinitely prolonged, instead\nof \"sliding down the celestial ray,\" according to his expression.\n\nBut we had no choice; and as long as our road led towards the\ncentre--however little progress we made, there was no reason to\ncomplain.\n\nMoreover, from time to time the slopes were much greater, the naiad sang\nmore loudly, and we began to dip downwards in earnest.\n\nAs yet, however, I felt no painful sensation. I had not got over the\nexcitement of the discovery of water.\n\nThat day and the next we did a considerable amount of horizontal, and\nrelatively very little vertical, traveling.\n\nOn Friday evening, the tenth of July, according to our estimation, we\nought to have been thirty leagues to the southeast of Reykjavik, and\nabout two leagues and a half deep. We now received a rather startling\nsurprise.\n\nUnder our feet there opened a horrible well. My uncle was so delighted\nthat he actually clapped his hands--as he saw how steep and sharp was\nthe descent.\n\n\"Ah, ah!\" he cried, in rapturous delight; \"this will take us a long way. \nLook at the projections of the rock. Hah!\" he exclaimed, \"it's a fearful\nstaircase!\"\n\nHans, however, who in all our troubles had never given up the ropes,\ntook care so to dispose of them as to prevent any accidents. Our descent\nthen began. I dare not call it a perilous descent, for I was already too\nfamiliar with that sort of work to look upon it as anything but a very\nordinary affair.\n\nThis well was a kind of narrow opening in the massive granite of the\nkind known as a fissure. The contraction of the terrestrial scaffolding,\nwhen it suddenly cooled, had been evidently the cause. If it had ever\nserved in former times as a kind of funnel through which passed the\neruptive masses vomited by Sneffels, I was at a loss to explain how it\nhad left no mark. We were, in fact, descending a spiral, something like\nthose winding staircases in use in modern houses.\n\nWe were compelled every quarter of an hour or thereabouts to sit down in\norder to rest our legs. Our calves ached. We then seated ourselves on\nsome projecting rock with our legs hanging over, and gossiped while we\nate a mouthful--drinking still from the pleasantly warm running stream\nwhich had not deserted us.\n\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that in this curiously shaped fissure\nthe Hansbach had become a cascade to the detriment of its size. It was\nstill, however, sufficient, and more, for our wants. Besides we knew\nthat, as soon as the declivity ceased to be so abrupt, the stream must\nresume its peaceful course. At this moment it reminded me of my uncle,\nhis impatience and rage, while when it flowed more peacefully, I\npictured to myself the placidity of the Icelandic guide.\n\nDuring the whole of two days, the sixth and seventh of July, we followed\nthe extraordinary spiral staircase of the fissure, penetrating two\nleagues farther into the crust of the earth, which put us five leagues\nbelow the level of the sea. On the eighth, however, at twelve o'clock in\nthe day, the fissure suddenly assumed a much more gentle slope still\ntrending in a southeast direction.\n\nThe road now became comparatively easy, and at the same time dreadfully\nmonotonous. It would have been difficult for matters to have turned out\notherwise. Our peculiar journey had no chance of being diversified by\nlandscape and scenery. At all events, such was my idea.\n\nAt length, on Wednesday the fifteenth, we were actually seven leagues\n(twenty-one miles) below the surface of the earth, and fifty leagues\ndistant from the mountain of Sneffels. Though, if the truth be told, we\nwere very tired, our health had resisted all suffering, and was in a\nmost satisfactory state. Our traveler's box of medicaments had not even\nbeen opened.\n\nMy uncle was careful to note every hour the indications of the compass,\nof the manometer, and of the thermometer, all which he afterwards\npublished in his elaborate philosophical and scientific account of our\nremarkable voyage. He was therefore able to give an exact relation of\nthe situation. When, therefore, he informed me that we were fifty\nleagues in a horizontal direction distant from our starting point, I\ncould not suppress a loud exclamation.\n\n\"What is the matter now?\" cried my uncle.\n\n\"Nothing very important, only an idea has entered my head,\" was my\nreply.\n\n\"Well, out with it, My boy.\"\n\n\"It is my opinion that if your calculations are correct we are no longer\nunder Iceland.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"We can very easily find out,\" I replied, pulling out a map and\ncompasses.\n\n\"You see,\" I said, after careful measurement, \"that I am not mistaken.\nWe are far beyond Cape Portland; and those fifty leagues to the\nsoutheast will take us into the open sea.\"\n\n\"Under the open sea,\" cried my uncle, rubbing his hands with a delighted\nair.\n\n\"Yes,\" I cried, \"no doubt old Ocean flows over our heads!\"\n\n\"Well, my dear boy, what can be more natural! Do you not know that in\nthe neighborhood of Newcastle there are coal mines which have been\nworked far out under the sea?\"\n\nNow my worthy uncle, the Professor, no doubt regarded this discovery as\na very simple fact, but to me the idea was by no means a pleasant one.\nAnd yet when one came to think the matter over seriously, what mattered\nit whether the plains and mountains of Iceland were suspended over our\ndevoted heads, or the mighty billows of the Atlantic Ocean? The whole\nquestion rested on the solidity of the granite roof above us. However, I\nsoon got used to the ideal for the passage now level, now running down,\nand still always to the southeast, kept going deeper and deeper into the\nprofound abysses of Mother Earth.\n\nThree days later, on the eighteenth day of July, on a Saturday, we\nreached a kind of vast grotto. My uncle here paid Hans his usual\nrix-dollars, and it was decided that the next day should be a day of\nrest.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\nSUNDAY BELOW GROUND\n\n\nI Awoke on Sunday morning without any sense of hurry and bustle\nattendant on an immediate departure. Though the day to be devoted to\nrepose and reflection was spent under such strange circumstances, and in\nso wonderful a place, the idea was a pleasant one. Besides, we all began\nto get used to this kind of existence. I had almost ceased to think of\nthe sun, of the moon, of the stars, of the trees, houses, and towns; in\nfact, about any terrestrial necessities. In our peculiar position we\nwere far above such reflections.\n\nThe grotto was a vast and magnificent hall. Along its granitic soil the\nstream flowed placidly and pleasantly. So great a distance was it now\nfrom its fiery source that its water was scarcely lukewarm, and could be\ndrunk without delay or difficulty.\n\nAfter a frugal breakfast, the Professor made up his mind to devote some\nhours to putting his notes and calculations in order.\n\n\"In the first place,\" he said, \"I have a good many to verify and prove,\nin order that we may know our exact position. I wish to be able on our\nreturn to the upper regions to make a map of our journey, a kind of\nvertical section of the globe, which will be, as it were, the profile of\nthe expedition.\"\n\n\"That would indeed be a curious work, Uncle; but can you make your\nobservations with anything like certainty and precision?\"\n\n\"I can. I have never on any occasion failed to note with great care the\nangles and slopes. I am certain as to having made no mistake. Take the\ncompass and examine how she points.\"\n\nI looked at the instrument with care.\n\n\"East one quarter southeast.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" resumed the Professor, noting the observation, and going\nthrough some rapid calculations. \"I make out that we have journeyed two\nhundred and fifty miles from the point of our departure.\"\n\n\"Then the mighty waves of the Atlantic are rolling over our heads?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And at this very moment it is possible that fierce tempests are raging\nabove, and that men and ships are battling against the angry blasts just\nover our heads?\"\n\n\"It is quite within the range of possibility,\" rejoined my uncle,\nsmiling.\n\n\"And that whales are playing in shoals, thrashing the bottom of the sea,\nthe roof of our adamantine prison?\"\n\n\"Be quite at rest on that point; there is no danger of their breaking\nthrough. But to return to our calculations. We are to the southeast, two\nhundred and fifty miles from the base of Sneffels, and, according to my\npreceding notes, I think we have gone sixteen leagues in a downward\ndirection.\"\n\n\"Sixteen leagues--fifty miles!\" I cried.\n\n\"I am sure of it.\"\n\n\"But that is the extreme limit allowed by science for the thickness of\nthe earth's crust,\" I replied, referring to my geological studies.\n\n\"I do not contravene that assertion,\" was his quiet answer.\n\n\"And at this stage of our journey, according to all known laws on the\nincrease of heat, there should be here a temperature of <i>fifteen hundred\ndegrees of Reaumur</i>.\"\n\n\"There should be--you say, my boy.\"\n\n\"In which case this granite would not exist, but be in a state of\nfusion.\"\n\n\"But you perceive, my boy, that it is not so, and that facts, as usual,\nare very stubborn things, overruling all theories.\"\n\n\"I am forced to yield to the evidence of my senses, but I am\nnevertheless very much surprised.\"\n\n\"What heat does the thermometer really indicate?\" continued the\nphilosopher.\n\n\"Twenty-seven six-tenths.\"\n\n\"So that science is wrong by fourteen hundred and seventy-four degrees\nand four-tenths. According to which, it is demonstrated that the\nproportional increase in temperature is an exploded error. Humphry Davy\nhere shines forth in all his glory. He is right, and I have acted wisely\nto believe him. Have you any answer to make to this statement?\"\n\nHad I chosen to have spoken, I might have said a great deal. I in no way\nadmitted the theory of Humphry Davy--I still held out for the theory of\nproportional increase of heat, though I did not feel it.\n\nI was far more willing to allow that this chimney of an extinct volcano\nwas covered by lava of a kind refractory to heat--in fact a bad\nconductor--which did not allow the great increase of temperature to\npercolate through its sides. The hot water jet supported my view of the\nmatter.\n\nBut without entering on a long and useless discussion, or seeking for\nnew arguments to controvert my uncle, I contented myself with taking up\nfacts as they were.\n\n\"Well, sir, I take for granted that all your calculations are correct,\nbut allow me to draw from them a rigorous and definite conclusion.\"\n\n\"Go on, my boy--have your say,\" cried my uncle goodhumoredly.\n\n\"At the place where we now are, under the latitude of Iceland, the\nterrestrial depth is about fifteen hundred and eighty-three leagues.\"\n\n\"Fifteen hundred eighty-three and a quarter.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose we say sixteen hundred in round numbers. Now, out of a\nvoyage of sixteen hundred leagues we have completed sixteen.\"\n\n\"As you say, what then?\"\n\n\"At the expense of a diagonal journey of no less than eighty-five\nleagues.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"We have been twenty days about it.\"\n\n\"Exactly twenty days.\"\n\n\"Now sixteen is the hundredth part of our contemplated expedition. If we\ngo on in this way we shall be two thousand days, that is about five\nyears and a half, going down.\"\n\nThe Professor folded his arms, listened, but did not speak.\n\n\"Without counting that if a vertical descent of sixteen leagues costs us\na horizontal of eighty-five, we shall have to go about eight thousand\nleagues to the southeast, and we must therefore come out somewhere in\nthe circumference long before we can hope to reach the centre.\"\n\n\"Bother your calculations,\" cried my uncle in one of his old rages. \"On\nwhat basis do they rest? How do you know that this passage does not take\nus direct to the end we require? Moreover, I have in my favor,\nfortunately, a precedent. What I have undertaken to do, another has\ndone, and he having succeeded, why should I not be equally successful?\"\n\n\"I hope, indeed, you will, but still, I suppose I may be allowed to--\"\n\n\"You are allowed to hold your tongue,\" cried Professor Hardwigg, \"when\nyou talk so unreasonably as this.\"\n\nI saw at once that the old doctorial Professor was still alive in my\nuncle--and fearful to rouse his angry passions, I dropped the unpleasant\nsubject.\n\n\"Now, then,\" he explained, \"consult the manometer. What does that\nindicate?\"\n\n\"A considerable amount of pressure.\"\n\n\"Very good. You see, then, that by descending slowly, and by gradually\naccustoming ourselves to the density of this lower atmosphere, we shall\nnot suffer.\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose not, except it may be a certain amount of pain in the\nears,\" was my rather grim reply.\n\n\"That, my dear boy, is nothing, and you will easily get rid of that\nsource of discomfort by bringing the exterior air in communication with\nthe air contained in your lungs.\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said I, for I had quite made up my mind in no wise to\ncontradict my uncle. \"I should fancy almost that I should experience a\ncertain amount of satisfaction in making a plunge into this dense\natmosphere. Have you taken note of how wonderfully sound is propagated?\"\n\n\"Of course I have. There can be no doubt that a journey into the\ninterior of the earth would be an excellent cure for deafness.\"\n\n\"But then, Uncle,\" I ventured mildly to observe, \"this density will\ncontinue to increase.\"\n\n\"Yes--according to a law which, however, is scarcely defined. It is true\nthat the intensity of weight will diminish just in proportion to the\ndepth to which we go. You know very well that it is on the surface of\nthe earth that its action is most powerfully felt, while on the\ncontrary, in the very centre of the earth bodies cease to have any\nweight at all.\"\n\n\"I know that is the case, but as we progress will not the atmosphere\nfinally assume the density of water?\"\n\n\"I know it; when placed under the pressure of seven hundred and ten\natmospheres,\" cried my uncle with imperturbable gravity.\n\n\"And when we are still lower down?\" I asked with natural anxiety.\n\n\"Well, lower down, the density will become even greater.\"\n\n\"Then how shall we be able to make our way through this atmospheric\nfog?\"\n\n\"Well, my worthy nephew, we must ballast ourselves by filling our\npockets with stones,\" said Professor Hardwigg.\n\n\"Faith, Uncle, you have an answer for everything,\" was my only reply.\n\nI began to feel that it was unwise of me to go any farther into the wide\nfield of hypotheses for I should certainly have revived some difficulty,\nor rather impossibility, that would have enraged the Professor.\n\nIt was evident, nevertheless, that the air under a pressure which might\nbe multiplied by thousands of atmospheres, would end by becoming\nperfectly solid, and that then admitting our bodies resisted the\npressure, we should have to stop, in spite of all the reasonings in the\nworld. Facts overcome all arguments.\n\nBut I thought it best not to urge this argument. My uncle would simply\nhave quoted the example of Saknussemm. Supposing the learned Icelander's\njourney ever really to have taken place--there was one simple answer to\nbe made:\n\nIn the sixteenth century neither the barometer nor the manometer had\nbeen invented--how, then, could Saknussemm have been able to discover\nwhen he did reach the centre of the earth?\n\nThis unanswerable and learned objection I, however, kept to myself and,\nbracing up my courage, awaited the course of events--little aware of how\nadventurous yet were to be the incidents of our remarkable journey.\n\nThe rest of this day of leisure and repose was spent in calculation and\nconversation. I made it a point to agree with the Professor in\neverything; but I envied the perfect indifference of Hans, who, without\ntaking any such trouble about the cause and effect, went blindly onwards\nwherever destiny chose to lead him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\nALONE\n\n\nIt must in all truth be confessed, things as yet had gone on well, and I\nshould have acted in bad taste to have complained. If the true medium of\nour difficulties did not increase, it was within the range of\npossibility that we might ultimately reach the end of our journey. Then\nwhat glory would be ours! I began in the newly aroused ardor of my soul\nto speak enthusiastically to the Professor. Well, was I serious? The\nwhole state in which we existed was a mystery--and it was impossible to\nknow whether or not I was in earnest.\n\nFor several days after our memorable halt, the slopes became more\nrapid--some were even of a most frightful character--almost vertical, so\nthat we were forever going down into the solid interior mass. During\nsome days, we actually descended a league and a half, even two leagues\ntowards the centre of the earth. The descents were sufficiently\nperilous, and while we were engaged in them we learned fully to\nappreciate the marvelous coolness of our guide, Hans. Without him we\nshould have been wholly lost. The grave and impassible Icelander devoted\nhimself to us with the most incomprehensible sang-froid and ease; and,\nthanks to him, many a dangerous pass was got over, where, but for him,\nwe should inevitably have stuck fast.\n\nHis silence increased every day. I think that we began to be influenced\nby this peculiar trait in his character. It is certain that the\ninanimate objects by which you are surrounded have a direct action on\nthe brain. It must be that a man who shuts himself up between four walls\nmust lose the faculty of associating ideas and words. How many persons\ncondemned to the horrors of solitary confinement have gone mad--simply\nbecause the thinking faculties have lain dormant!\n\nDuring the two weeks that followed our last interesting conversation,\nthere occurred nothing worthy of being especially recorded.\n\nI have, while writing these memoirs, taxed my memory in vain for one\nincident of travel during this particular period.\n\nBut the next event to be related is terrible indeed. Its very memory,\neven now, makes my soul shudder, and my blood run cold.\n\nIt was on the seventh of August. Our constant and successive descents\nhad taken us quite thirty leagues into the interior of the earth, that\nis to say that there were above us thirty leagues, nearly a hundred\nmiles, of rocks, and oceans, and continents, and towns, to say nothing\nof living inhabitants. We were in a southeasterly direction, about two\nhundred leagues from Iceland.\n\nOn that memorable day the tunnel had begun to assume an almost\nhorizontal course.\n\nI was on this occasion walking on in front. My uncle had charge of one\nof the Ruhmkorff coils, I had possession of the other. By means of its\nlight I was busy examining the different layers of granite. I was\ncompletely absorbed in my work.\n\nSuddenly halting and turning round, I found that I was alone!\n\n\"Well,\" thought I to myself, \"I have certainly been walking too fast--or\nelse Hans and my uncle have stopped to rest. The best thing I can do is\nto go back and find them. Luckily, there is very little ascent to tire\nme.\"\n\nI accordingly retraced my steps and, while doing so, walked for at least\na quarter of an hour. Rather uneasy, I paused and looked eagerly around.\nNot a living soul. I called aloud. No reply. My voice was lost amid the\nmyriad cavernous echoes it aroused!\n\nI began for the first time to feel seriously uneasy. A cold shiver shook\nmy whole body, and perspiration, chill and terrible, burst upon my skin.\n\n\"I must be calm,\" I said, speaking aloud, as boys whistle to drive away\nfear. \"There can be no doubt that I shall find my companions. There\ncannot be two roads. It is certain that I was considerably ahead; all I\nhave to do is to go back.\"\n\nHaving come to this determination I ascended the tunnel for at least\nhalf an hour, unable to decide if I had ever seen certain landmarks\nbefore. Every now and then I paused to discover if any loud appeal was\nmade to me, well knowing that in that dense and intensified atmosphere I\nshould hear it a long way off. But no. The most extraordinary silence\nreigned in this immense gallery. Only the echoes of my own footsteps\ncould be heard.\n\nAt last I stopped. I could scarcely realize the fact of my isolation. I\nwas quite willing to think that I had made a mistake, but not that I was\nlost. If I had made a mistake, I might find my way; if lost--I shuddered\nto think of it.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said I to myself, \"since there is only one road, and they\nmust come by it, we shall at last meet. All I have to do is still to go\nupwards. Perhaps, however, not seeing me, and forgetting I was ahead,\nthey may have gone back in search of me. Still, even in this case, if I\nmake haste, I shall get up to them. There can be no doubt about the\nmatter.\"\n\nBut as I spoke these last words aloud, it would have been quite clear to\nany listener--had there been one--that I was by no means convinced of\nthe fact. Moreover in order to associate together these simple ideas and\nto reunite them under the form of reasoning, required some time. I could\nnot all at once bring my brain to think.\n\nThen another dread doubt fell upon my soul. After all, was I ahead? Of\ncourse I was. Hans was no doubt following behind preceded by my uncle. I\nperfectly recollected his having stopped for a moment to strap his\nbaggage on his shoulder. I now remembered this trifling detail. It was,\nI believe, just at that very moment that I had determined to continue my\nroute.\n\n\"Again,\" thought I, reasoning as calmly as was possible, \"there is\nanother sure means of not losing my way, a thread to guide me through\nthe labyrinthine subterraneous retreat--one which I had forgotten--my\nfaithful river.\"\n\nThis course of reasoning roused my drooping spirits, and I resolved to\nresume my journey without further delay. No time was to be lost.\n\nIt was at this moment that I had reason to bless the thoughtfulness of\nmy uncle, when he refused to allow the eider hunter to close the\norifices of the hot spring--that small fissure in the great mass of\ngranite. This beneficent spring after having saved us from thirst during\nso many days would now enable me to regain the right road.\n\nHaving come to this mental decision, I made up my mind, before I started\nupwards, that ablution would certainly do me a great deal of good.\n\nI stopped to plunge my hands and forehead in the pleasant water of the\nHansbach stream, blessing its presence as a certain consolation.\n\nConceive my horror and stupefaction!--I was treading a hard, dusty,\nshingly road of granite. The stream on which I reckoned had wholly\ndisappeared!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24\n\nLOST!\n\n\nNo words in any human language can depict my utter despair. I was\nliterally buried alive; with no other expectation before me but to die\nin all the slow horrible torture of hunger and thirst.\n\nMechanically I crawled about, feeling the dry and arid rock. Never to my\nfancy had I ever felt anything so dry.\n\nBut, I frantically asked myself, how had I lost the course of the\nflowing stream? There could be no doubt it had ceased to flow in the\ngallery in which I now was. Now I began to understand the cause of the\nstrange silence which prevailed when last I tried if any appeal from my\ncompanions might perchance reach my ear.\n\nIt so happened that when I first took an imprudent step in the wrong\ndirection, I did not perceive the absence of the all-important stream.\n\nIt was now quite evident that when we halted, another tunnel must have\nreceived the waters of the little torrent, and that I had unconsciously\nentered a different gallery. To what unknown depths had my companions\ngone? Where was I?\n\nHow to get back! Clue or landmark there was absolutely none! My feet\nleft no signs on the granite and shingle. My brain throbbed with agony\nas I tried to discover the solution of this terrible problem. My\nsituation, after all sophistry and reflection, had finally to be summed\nup in three awful words--\n\n<i>Lost!</i> Lost!! LOST!!!\n\nLost at a depth which, to my finite understanding, appeared to be\nimmeasurable.\n\nThese thirty leagues of the crust of the earth weighed upon my shoulders\nlike the globe on the shoulders of Atlas. I felt myself crushed by the\nawful weight. It was indeed a position to drive the sanest man to\nmadness!\n\nI tried to bring my thoughts back to the things of the world so long\nforgotten. It was with the greatest difficulty that I succeeded in doing\nso. Hamburg, the house on the Konigstrasse, my dear cousin Gretchen--all\nthat world which had before vanished like a shadow floated before my now\nvivid imagination.\n\nThere they were before me, but how unreal. Under the influence of a\nterrible hallucination I saw all the incidents of our journey pass\nbefore me like the scenes of a panorama. The ship and its inmates,\nIceland, M. Fridriksson, and the great summit of Mount Sneffels! I said\nto myself that, if in my position I retained the most faint and shadowy\noutline of a hope, it would be a sure sign of approaching delirium. It\nwere better to give way wholly to despair!\n\nIn fact, did I but reason with calmness and philosophy, what human power\nwas there in existence able to take me back to the surface of the earth,\nand ready, too, to split asunder, to rend in twain those huge and mighty\nvaults which stand above my head? Who could enable me to find my\nroad--and regain my companions?\n\nInsensate folly and madness to entertain even a shadow of hope!\n\n\"Oh, Uncle!\" was my despairing cry.\n\nThis was the only word of reproach which came to my lips; for I\nthoroughly understood how deeply and sorrowfully the worthy Professor\nwould regret my loss, and how in his turn he would patiently seek for\nme.\n\nWhen I at last began to resign myself to the fact that no further aid\nwas to be expected from man, and knowing that I was utterly powerless to\ndo anything for my own salvation, I kneeled with earnest fervor and\nasked assistance from Heaven. The remembrance of my innocent childhood,\nthe memory of my mother, known only in my infancy, came welling forth\nfrom my heart. I had recourse to prayer. And little as I had a right to\nbe remembered by Him whom I had forgotten in the hour of prosperity, and\nwhom I so tardily invoked, I prayed earnestly and sincerely.\n\nThis renewal of my youthful faith brought about a much greater amount of\ncalm, and I was enabled to concentrate all my strength and intelligence\non the terrible realities of my unprecedented situation.\n\nI had about me that which I had at first wholly forgotten--three days'\nprovisions. Moreover, my water bottle was quite full. Nevertheless, the\none thing which it was impossible to do was to remain alone. Try to find\nmy companions I must, at any price. But which course should I take?\nShould I go upwards, or again descend? Doubtless it was right to retrace\nmy steps in an upward direction.\n\nBy doing this with care and coolness, I must reach the point where I had\nturned away from the rippling stream. I must find the fatal bifurcation\nor fork. Once at this spot, once the river at my feet, I could, at all\nevents, regain the awful crater of Mount Sneffels. Why had I not thought\nof this before? This, at last, was a reasonable hope of safety. The most\nimportant thing, then, to be done was to discover the bed of the\nHansbach.\n\nAfter a slight meal and a draught of water, I rose like a giant\nrefreshed. Leaning heavily on my pole, I began the ascent of the\ngallery. The slope was very rapid and rather difficult. But I advanced\nhopefully and carefully, like a man who at last is making his way out of\na forest, and knows there is only one road to follow.\n\nDuring one whole hour nothing happened to check my progress. As I\nadvanced, I tried to recollect the shape of the tunnel--to recall to my\nmemory certain projections of rocks--to persuade myself that I had\nfollowed certain winding routes before. But no one particular sign could\nI bring to mind, and I was soon forced to allow that this gallery would\nnever take me back to the point at which I had separated myself from my\ncompanions. It was absolutely without issue--a mere blind alley in the\nearth.\n\nThe moment at length came when, facing the solid rock, I knew my fate,\nand fell inanimate on the arid floor!\n\nTo describe the horrible state of despair and fear into which I then\nfell would now be vain and impossible. My last hope, the courage which\nhad sustained me, drooped before the sight of this pitiless granite\nrock!\n\nLost in a vast labyrinth, the sinuosities of which spread in every\ndirection, without guide, clue or compass, I knew it was a vain and\nuseless task to attempt flight. All that remained to me was to lie down\nand die. To lie down and die the most cruel and horrible of deaths!\n\nIn my state of mind, the idea came into my head that one day perhaps,\nwhen my fossil bones were found, their discovery so far below the level\nof the earth might give rise to solemn and interesting scientific\ndiscussions.\n\nI tried to cry aloud, but hoarse, hollow, and inarticulate sounds alone\ncould make themselves heard through my parched lips. I literally panted\nfor breath.\n\nIn the midst of all these horrible sources of anguish and despair, a new\nhorror took possession of my soul. My lamp, by falling down, had got out\nof order. I had no means of repairing it. Its light was already becoming\npaler and paler, and soon would expire.\n\nWith a strange sense of resignation and despair, I watched the luminous\ncurrent in the coil getting less and less. A procession of shadows moved\nflashing along the granite wall. I scarcely dared to lower my eyelids,\nfearing to lose the last spark of this fugitive light. Every instant it\nseemed to me that it was about to vanish and to leave me forever--in\nutter darkness!\n\nAt last, one final trembling flame remained in the lamp; I followed it\nwith all my power of vision; I gasped for breath; I concentrated upon it\nall the power of my soul, as upon the last scintillation of light I was\never destined to see: and then I was to be lost forever in Cimmerian and\ntenebrous shades.\n\nA wild and plaintive cry escaped my lips. On earth during the most\nprofound and comparatively complete darkness, light never allows a\ncomplete destruction and extinction of its power. Light is so diffuse,\nso subtle, that it permeates everywhere, and whatever little may remain,\nthe retina of the eye will succeed in finding it. In this place\nnothing--the absolute obscurity made me blind in every sense.\n\nMy head was now wholly lost. I raised my arms, trying the effects of the\nfeeling in getting against the cold stone wall. It was painful in the\nextreme. Madness must have taken possession of me. I knew not what I\ndid. I began to run, to fly, rushing at haphazard in this inextricable\nlabyrinth, always going downwards, running wildly underneath the\nterrestrial crust, like an inhabitant of the subterranean furnaces,\nscreaming, roaring, howling, until bruised by the pointed rocks, falling\nand picking myself up all covered with blood, seeking madly to drink the\nblood which dripped from my torn features, mad because this blood only\ntrickled over my face, and watching always for this horrid wall which\never presented to me the fearful obstacle against which I could not dash\nmy head.\n\nWhere was I going? It was impossible to say. I was perfectly ignorant of\nthe matter.\n\nSeveral hours passed in this way. After a long time, having utterly\nexhausted my strength, I fell a heavy inert mass along the side of the\ntunnel, and lost consciousness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 25\n\nTHE WHISPERING GALLERY\n\n\nWhen at last I came back to a sense of life and being, my face was wet,\nbut wet, as I soon knew, with tears. How long this state of\ninsensibility lasted, it is quite impossible for me now to say. I had no\nmeans left to me of taking any account of time. Never since the creation\nof the world had such a solitude as mine existed. I was completely\nabandoned.\n\nAfter my fall I lost much blood. I felt myself flooded with the\nlife-giving liquid. My first sensation was perhaps a natural one. Why\nwas I not dead? Because I was alive, there was something left to do. I\ntried to make up my mind to think no longer. As far as I was able, I\ndrove away all ideas, and utterly overcome by pain and grief, I crouched\nagainst the granite wall.\n\nI just commenced to feel the fainting coming on again, and the sensation\nthat this was the last struggle before complete annihilation--when, on a\nsudden, a violent uproar reached my ears. It had some resemblance to the\nprolonged rumbling voice of thunder, and I clearly distinguished\nsonorous voices, lost one after the other, in the distant depths of the\ngulf.\n\nWhence came this noise? Naturally, it was to be supposed from new\nphenomena which were taking place in the bosom of the solid mass of\nMother Earth! The explosion of some gaseous vapors, or the fall of some\nsolid, of the granitic or other rock.\n\nAgain I listened with deep attention. I was extremely anxious to hear if\nthis strange and inexplicable sound was likely to be renewed! A whole\nquarter of an hour elapsed in painful expectation. Deep and solemn\nsilence reigned in the tunnel. So still that I could hear the beatings\nof my own heart! I waited, waited with a strange kind of hopefulness.\n\nSuddenly my ear, which leaned accidentally against the wall, appeared to\ncatch, as it were, the faintest echo of a sound. I thought that I heard\nvague, incoherent and distant voices. I quivered all over with\nexcitement and hope!\n\n\"It must be hallucination,\" I cried. \"It cannot be! it is not true!\"\n\nBut no! By listening more attentively, I really did convince myself that\nwhat I heard was truly the sound of human voices. To make any meaning\nout of the sound, however, was beyond my power. I was too weak even to\nhear distinctly. Still it was a positive fact that someone was speaking.\nOf that I was quite certain.\n\nThere was a moment of fear. A dread fell upon my soul that it might be\nmy own words brought back to me by a distant echo. Perhaps without\nknowing it, I might have been crying aloud. I resolutely closed my lips,\nand once more placed my ear to the huge granite wall.\n\nYes, for certain. It was in truth the sound of human voices.\n\nI now by the exercise of great determination dragged myself along the\nsides of the cavern, until I reached a point where I could hear more\ndistinctly. But though I could detect the sound, I could only make out\nuncertain, strange, and incomprehensible words. They reached my ear as\nif they had been spoken in a low tone--murmured, as it were, afar off.\n\nAt last, I made out the word forlorad repeated several times in a tone\nbetokening great mental anguish and sorrow.\n\nWhat could this word mean, and who was speaking it? It must be either my\nuncle or the guide Hans! If, therefore, I could hear them, they must\nsurely be able to hear me.\n\n\"Help,\" I cried at the top of my voice; \"help, I am dying!\"\n\nI then listened with scarcely a breath; I panted for the slightest sound\nin the darkness--a cry, a sigh, a question! But silence reigned supreme.\nNo answer came! In this way some minutes passed. A whole flood of ideas\nflashed through my mind. I began to fear that my voice, weakened by\nsickness and suffering, could not reach my companions who were in search\nof me.\n\n\"It must be they,\" I cried; \"who else could by any possibility be buried\na hundred miles below the level of the earth?\" The mere supposition was\npreposterous.\n\nI began, therefore, to listen again with the most breathless attention.\nAs I moved my ears along the side of the place I was in, I found a\nmathematical point as it were, where the voices appeared to attain their\nmaximum of intensity. The word forlorad again distinctly reached my ear.\nThen came again that rolling noise like thunder which had awakened me\nout of torpor.\n\n\"I begin to understand,\" I said to myself after some little time devoted\nto reflection; \"it is not through the solid mass that the sound reaches\nmy ears. The walls of my cavernous retreat are of solid granite, and the\nmost fearful explosion would not make uproar enough to penetrate them.\nThe sound must come along the gallery itself. The place I was in must\npossess some peculiar acoustic properties of its own.\"\n\nAgain I listened; and this time--yes, this time--I heard my name\ndistinctly pronounced: cast as it were into space.\n\nIt was my uncle, the Professor, who was speaking. He was in conversation\nwith the guide, and the word which had so often reached my ears,\nforlorad, was a Danish expression.\n\nThen I understood it all. In order to make myself heard, I too must\nspeak as it were along the side of the gallery, which would carry the\nsound of my voice just as the wire carries the electric fluid from point\nto point.\n\nBut there was no time to lose. If my companions were only to remove a\nfew feet from where they stood, the acoustic effect would be over, my\nWhispering Gallery would be destroyed. I again therefore crawled towards\nthe wall, and said as clearly and distinctly as I could:\n\n\"Uncle Hardwigg.\"\n\nI then awaited a reply.\n\nSound does not possess the property of traveling with such extreme\nrapidity. Besides the density of the air at that depth from light and\nmotion was very far from adding to the rapidity of circulation. Several\nseconds elapsed, which to my excited imagination, appeared ages; and\nthese words reached my eager ears, and moved my wildly beating heart:\n\n\"Harry, my boy, is that you?\"\n\nA short delay between question and answer.\n\n\"Yes--yes.\"\n\n..........\n\n\"Where are you?\"\n\n..........\n\n\"Lost!\"\n\n..........\n\n\"And your lamp?\"\n\n..........\n\n\"Out.\"\n\n..........\n\n\"But the guiding stream?\"\n\n..........\n\n\"Is lost!\"\n\n..........\n\n\"Keep your courage, Harry. We will do our best.\"\n\n..........\n\n\"One moment, my uncle,\" I cried; \"I have no longer strength to answer\nyour questions. But--for heaven's sake--do you--continue--to speak--to\nme!\" Absolute silence, I felt, would be annihilation.\n\n\"Keep up your courage,\" said my uncle. \"As you are so weak, do not\nspeak. We have been searching for you in all directions, both by going\nupwards and downwards in the gallery. My dear boy, I had begun to give\nover all hope--and you can never know what bitter tears of sorrow and\nregret I have shed. At last, supposing you to be still on the road\nbeside the Hansbach, we again descended, firing off guns as signals.\nNow, however, that we have found you, and that our voices reach each\nother, it may be a long time before we actually meet. We are conversing\nby means of some extraordinary acoustic arrangement of the labyrinth.\nBut do not despair, my dear boy. It is something gained even to hear\neach other.\"\n\nWhile he was speaking, my brain was at work reflecting. A certain\nundefined hope, vague and shapeless as yet, made my heart beat wildly.\nIn the first place, it was absolutely necessary for me to know one\nthing. I once more, therefore, leaned my head against the wall, which I\nalmost touched with my lips, and again spoke.\n\n\"Uncle.\"\n\n..........\n\n\"My boy?\" was his answer after a few moments.\n\n..........\n\n\"It is of the utmost consequence that we should know how far we are\nasunder.\"\n\n..........\n\n\"That is not difficult.\"\n\n..........\n\n\"You have your chronometer at hand?\" I asked.\n\n..........\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n..........\n\n\"Well, take it into your hand. Pronounce my name, noting exactly the\nsecond at which you speak. I will reply as soon as I hear your\nwords--and you will then note exactly the moment at which my reply\nreaches you.\"\n\n..........\n\n\"Very good; and the mean time between my question and your answer will\nbe the time occupied by my voice in reaching you.\"\n\n..........\n\n\"That is exactly what I mean, Uncle,\" was my eager reply.\n\n..........\n\n\"Are you ready?\"\n\n..........\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n..........\n\n\"Well, make ready, I am about to pronounce your name,\" said the\nProfessor.\n\nI applied my ear close to the sides of the cavernous gallery, and as\nsoon as the word \"Harry\" reached my ear, I turned round and, placing my\nlips to the wall, repeated the sound.\n\n..........\n\n\"Forty seconds,\" said my uncle. \"There has elapsed forty seconds between\nthe two words. The sound, therefore, takes twenty seconds to ascend.\nNow, allowing a thousand and twenty feet for every second--we have\ntwenty thousand four hundred feet--a league and a half and one-eighth.\"\n\nThese words fell on my soul like a kind of death knell.\n\n\"A league and a half,\" I muttered in a low and despairing voice.\n\n..........\n\n\"It shall be got over, my boy,\" cried my uncle in a cheery tone; \"depend\non us.\"\n\n..........\n\n\"But do you know whether to ascend or descend?\" I asked faintly enough.\n\n..........\n\n\"We have to descend, and I will tell you why. You have reached a vast\nopen space, a kind of bare crossroad, from which galleries diverge in\nevery direction. That in which you are now lying must necessarily bring\nyou to this point, for it appears that all these mighty fissures, these\nfractures of the globe's interior, radiate from the vast cavern which we\nat this moment occupy. Rouse yourself, then, have courage and continue\nyour route. Walk if you can, if not drag yourself along--slide, if\nnothing else is possible. The slope must be rather rapid--and you will\nfind strong arms to receive you at the end of your journey. Make a\nstart, like a good fellow.\"\n\nThese words served to rouse some kind of courage in my sinking frame.\n\n\"Farewell for the present, good uncle, I am about to take my departure.\nAs soon as I start, our voices will cease to commingle. Farewell, then,\nuntil we meet again.\"\n\n..........\n\n\"Adieu, Harry--until we say Welcome.\" Such were the last words which\nreached my anxious ears before I commenced my weary and almost hopeless\njourney.\n\nThis wonderful and surprising conversation which took place through the\nvast mass of the earth's labyrinth, these words exchanged, the speakers\nbeing about five miles apart--ended with hopeful and pleasant\nexpressions. I breathed one more prayer to Heaven, I sent up words of\nthanksgiving--believing in my inmost heart that He had led me to the\nonly place where the voices of my friends could reach my ears.\n\nThis apparently astounding acoustic mystery is easily explainable by\nsimple natural laws; it arose from the conductibility of the rock. There\nare many instances of this singular propagation of sound which are not\nperceptible in its less mediate positions. In the interior gallery of\nSt. Paul's, and amid the curious caverns in Sicily, these phenomena are\nobservable. The most marvelous of them all is known as the Ear of\nDionysius.\n\nThese memories of the past, of my early reading and studies, came fresh\nto my thoughts. Moreover, I began to reason that if my uncle and I could\ncommunicate at so great a distance, no serious obstacle could exist\nbetween us. All I had to do was to follow the direction whence the sound\nhad reached me; and logically putting it, I must reach him if my\nstrength did not fail.\n\nI accordingly rose to my feet. I soon found, however, that I could not\nwalk; that I must drag myself along. The slope as I expected was very\nrapid; but I allowed myself to slip down.\n\nSoon the rapidity of the descent began to assume frightful proportions;\nand menaced a fearful fall. I clutched at the sides; I grasped at\nprojections of rocks; I threw myself backwards. All in vain. My weakness\nwas so great I could do nothing to save myself.\n\nSuddenly earth failed me.\n\nI was first launched into a dark and gloomy void. I then struck against\nthe projecting asperities of a vertical gallery, a perfect well. My head\nbounded against a pointed rock, and I lost all knowledge of existence.\nAs far as I was concerned, death had claimed me for his own.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 26\n\nA RAPID RECOVERY\n\n\nWhen I returned to the consciousness of existence, I found myself\nsurrounded by a kind of semiobscurity, lying on some thick and soft\ncoverlets. My uncle was watching--his eyes fixed intently on my\ncountenance, a grave expression on his face, a tear in his eye. At the\nfirst sigh which struggled from my bosom, he took hold of my hand. When\nhe saw my eyes open and fix themselves upon his, he uttered a loud cry\nof joy. \"He lives! he lives!\"\n\n\"Yes, my good uncle,\" I whispered.\n\n\"My dear boy,\" continued the grim Professor, clasping me to his heart,\n\"you are saved!\"\n\nI was deeply and unaffectedly touched by the tone in which these words\nwere uttered, and even more by the kindly care which accompanied them.\nThe Professor, however, was one of those men who must be severely tried\nin order to induce any display of affection or gentle emotion. At this\nmoment our friend Hans, the guide, joined us. He saw my hand in that of\nmy uncle, and I venture to say that, taciturn as he was, his eyes beamed\nwith lively satisfaction.\n\n\"God dag,\" he said.\n\n\"Good day, Hans, good day,\" I replied, in as hearty a tone as I could\nassume, \"and now, Uncle, that we are together, tell me where we are. I\nhave lost all idea of our position, as of everything else.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow, Harry, tomorrow,\" he replied. \"Today you are far too weak.\nYour head is surrounded with bandages and poultices that must not be\ntouched. Sleep, my boy, sleep, and tomorrow you will know all that you\nrequire.\"\n\n\"But,\" I cried, \"let me know what o'clock it is--what day it is?\"\n\n\"It is now eleven o'clock at night, and this is once more Sunday. It is\nnow the ninth of the month of August. And I distinctly prohibit you from\nasking any more questions until the tenth of the same.\"\n\nI was, if the truth were told, very weak indeed, and my eyes soon closed\ninvoluntarily. I did require a good night's rest, and I went off\nreflecting at the last moment that my perilous adventure in the interior\nof the earth, in total darkness, had lasted four days!\n\nOn the morning of the next day, at my awakening, I began to look around\nme. My sleeping place, made of all our traveling bedding, was in a\ncharming grotto, adorned with magnificent stalagmites, glittering in all\nthe colors of the rainbow, the floor of soft and silvery sand.\n\nA dim obscurity prevailed. No torch, no lamp was lighted, and yet\ncertain unexplained beams of light penetrated from without, and made\ntheir way through the opening of the beautiful grotto.\n\nI, moreover, heard a vague and indefinite murmur, like the ebb and flow\nof waves upon a strand, and sometimes I verily believed I could hear the\nsighing of the wind.\n\nI began to believe that, instead of being awake, I must be dreaming.\nSurely my brain had not been affected by my fall, and all that occurred\nduring the last twenty-four hours was not the frenzied visions of\nmadness? And yet after some reflection, a trial of my faculties, I came\nto the conclusion that I could not be mistaken. Eyes and ears could not\nsurely both deceive me.\n\n\"It is a ray of the blessed daylight,\" I said to myself, \"which has\npenetrated through some mighty fissure in the rocks. But what is the\nmeaning of this murmur of waves, this unmistakable moaning of the\nsalt-sea billows? I can hear, too, plainly enough, the whistling of the\nwind. But can I be altogether mistaken? If my uncle, during my illness,\nhas but carried me back to the surface of the earth! Has he, on my\naccount, given up his wondrous expedition, or in some strange manner has\nit come to an end?\"\n\nI was puzzling my brain over these and other questions, when the\nProfessor joined me.\n\n\"Good day, Harry,\" he cried in a joyous tone. \"I fancy you are quite\nwell.\"\n\n\"I am very much better,\" I replied, actually sitting up in my bed.\n\n\"I knew that would be the end of it, as you slept both soundly and\ntranquilly. Hans and I have each taken turn to watch, and every hour we\nhave seen visible signs of amelioration.\"\n\n\"You must be right, Uncle,\" was my reply, \"for I feel as if I could do\njustice to any meal you could put before me.\"\n\n\"You shall eat, my boy, you shall eat. The fever has left you. Our\nexcellent friend Hans has rubbed your wounds and bruises with I know not\nwhat ointment, of which the Icelanders alone possess the secret. And\nthey have healed your bruises in the most marvelous manner. Ah, he's a\nwise fellow is Master Hans.\"\n\nWhile he was speaking, my uncle was placing before me several articles\nof food, which, despite his earnest injunctions, I readily devoured. As\nsoon as the first rage of hunger was appeased, I overwhelmed him with\nquestions, to which he now no longer hesitated to give answers.\n\nI then learned, for the first time, that my providential fall had\nbrought me to the bottom of an almost perpendicular gallery. As I came\ndown, amidst a perfect shower of stones, the least of which falling on\nme would have crushed me to death, they came to the conclusion that I\nhad carried with me an entire dislocated rock. Riding as it were on this\nterrible chariot, I was cast headlong into my uncle's arms. And into\nthem I fell, insensible and covered with blood.\n\n\"It is indeed a miracle,\" was the Professor's final remark, \"that you\nwere not killed a thousand times over. But let us take care never to\nseparate; for surely we should risk never meeting again.\"\n\n\"Let us take care never again to separate.\"\n\nThese words fell with a sort of chill upon my heart. The journey, then,\nwas not over. I looked at my uncle with surprise and astonishment. My\nuncle, after an instant's examination of my countenance, said: \"What is\nthe matter, Harry?\"\n\n\"I want to ask you a very serious question. You say that I am all right\nin health?\"\n\n\"Certainly you are.\"\n\n\"And all my limbs are sound and capable of new exertion?\" I asked.\n\n\"Most undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"But what about my head?\" was my next anxious question.\n\n\"Well, your head, except that you have one or two contusions, is exactly\nwhere it ought to be--on your shoulders,\" said my uncle, laughing.\n\n\"Well, my own opinion is that my head is not exactly right. In fact, I\nbelieve myself slightly delirious.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\n\"I will explain why I fancy I have lost my senses,\" I cried. \"Have we\nnot returned to the surface of Mother Earth?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"Then truly I must be mad, for do I not see the light of day? do I not\nhear the whistling of the wind? and can I not distinguish the wash of a\ngreat sea?\"\n\n\"And that is all that makes you uneasy?\" said my uncle, with a smile.\n\n\"Can you explain?\"\n\n\"I will not make any attempt to explain; for the whole matter is utterly\ninexplicable. But you shall see and judge for yourself. You will then\nfind that geological science is as yet in its infancy--and that we are\ndoomed to enlighten the world.\"\n\n\"Let us advance, then,\" I cried eagerly, no longer able to restrain my\ncuriosity.\n\n\"Wait a moment, my dear Harry,\" he responded; \"you must take precautions\nafter your illness before going into the open air.\"\n\n\"The open air?\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy. I have to warn you that the wind is rather violent--and I\nhave no wish for you to expose yourself without necessary precautions.\"\n\n\"But I beg to assure you that I am perfectly recovered from my illness.\"\n\n\"Have just a little patience, my boy. A relapse would be inconvenient to\nall parties. We have no time to lose--as our approaching sea voyage may\nbe of long duration.\"\n\n\"Sea voyage?\" I cried, more bewildered than ever.\n\n\"Yes. You must take another day's rest, and we shall be ready to go on\nboard by tomorrow,\" replied my uncle, with a peculiar smile.\n\n\"Go on board!\" The words utterly astonished me.\n\nGo on board--what and how? Had we come upon a river, a lake, had we\ndiscovered some inland sea? Was a vessel lying at anchor in some part of\nthe interior of the earth?\n\nMy curiosity was worked up to the very highest pitch. My uncle made vain\nattempts to restrain me. When at last, however, he discovered that my\nfeverish impatience would do more harm than good--and that the\nsatisfaction of my wishes could alone restore me to a calm state of\nmind--he gave way.\n\nI dressed myself rapidly--and then taking the precaution to please my\nuncle, of wrapping myself in one of the coverlets, I rushed out of the\ngrotto.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 27\n\nTHE CENTRAL SEA\n\n\nAt first I saw absolutely nothing. My eyes, wholly unused to the\neffulgence of light, could not bear the sudden brightness; and I was\ncompelled to close them. When I was able to reopen them, I stood still,\nfar more stupefied than astonished. Not all the wildest effects of\nimagination could have conjured up such a scene! \"The sea--the sea,\" I\ncried.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied my uncle, in a tone of pardonable pride; \"the Central\nSea. No future navigator will deny the fact of my having discovered it;\nand hence of acquiring a right of giving it a name.\"\n\nIt was quite true. A vast, limitless expanse of water, the end of a lake\nif not of an ocean, spread before us, until it was lost in the distance.\nThe shore, which was very much indented, consisted of a beautiful soft\ngolden sand, mixed with small shells, the long-deserted home of some of\nthe creatures of a past age. The waves broke incessantly--and with a\npeculiarly sonorous murmur, to be found in underground localities. A\nslight frothy flake arose as the wind blew along the pellucid waters;\nand many a dash of spray was blown into my face. The mighty\nsuperstructure of rock which rose above to an inconceivable height left\nonly a narrow opening--but where we stood, there was a large margin of\nstrand. On all sides were capes and promontories and enormous cliffs,\npartially worn by the eternal breaking of the waves, through countless\nages! And as I gazed from side to side, the mighty rocks faded away like\na fleecy film of cloud.\n\nIt was in reality an ocean, with all the usual characteristics of an\ninland sea, only horribly wild--so rigid, cold and savage.\n\nOne thing startled and puzzled me greatly. How was it that I was able to\nlook upon that vast sheet of water instead of being plunged in utter\ndarkness? The vast landscape before me was lit up like day. But there\nwas wanting the dazzling brilliancy, the splendid irradiation of the\nsun; the pale cold illumination of the moon; the brightness of the\nstars. The illuminating power in this subterranean region, from its\ntrembling and Rickering character, its clear dry whiteness, the very\nslight elevation of its temperature, its great superiority to that of\nthe moon, was evidently electric; something in the nature of the aurora\nborealis, only that its phenomena were constant, and able to light up\nthe whole of the ocean cavern.\n\nThe tremendous vault above our heads, the sky, so to speak, appeared to\nbe composed of a conglomeration of nebulous vapors, in constant motion.\nI should originally have supposed that, under such an atmospheric\npressure as must exist in that place, the evaporation of water could not\nreally take place, and yet from the action of some physical law, which\nescaped my memory, there were heavy and dense clouds rolling along that\nmighty vault, partially concealing the roof. Electric currents produced\nastonishing play of light and shade in the distance, especially around\nthe heavier clouds. Deep shadows were cast beneath, and then suddenly,\nbetween two clouds, there would come a ray of unusual beauty, and\nremarkable intensity. And yet it was not like the sun, for it gave no\nheat.\n\nThe effect was sad and excruciatingly melancholy. Instead of a noble\nfirmament of blue, studded with stars, there was above me a heavy roof\nof granite, which seemed to crush me.\n\nGazing around, I began to think of the theory of the English captain who\ncompared the earth to a vast hollow sphere in the interior of which the\nair is retained in a luminous state by means of atmospheric pressure,\nwhile two stars, Pluto and Proserpine, circled there in their mysterious\norbits. After all, suppose the old fellow was right!\n\nIn truth, we were imprisoned--bound as it were, in a vast excavation.\nIts width it was impossible to make out; the shore, on either hand,\nwidening rapidly until lost to sight; while its length was equally\nuncertain. A haze on the distant horizon bounded our view. As to its\nheight, we could see that it must be many miles to the roof. Looking\nupward, it was impossible to discover where the stupendous roof began.\nThe lowest of the clouds must have been floating at an elevation of two\nthousand yards, a height greater than that of terrestrial vapors, which\ncircumstance was doubtless owing to the extreme density of the air.\n\nI use the word \"cavern\" in order to give an idea of the place. I cannot\ndescribe its awful grandeur; human language fails to convey an idea of\nits savage sublimity. Whether this singular vacuum had or had not been\ncaused by the sudden cooling of the earth when in a state of fusion, I\ncould not say. I had read of most wonderful and gigantic caverns--but,\nnone in any way like this.\n\nThe great grotto of Guachara, in Colombia, visited by the learned\nHumboldt; the vast and partially explored Mammoth Cave in Kentucky--what\nwere these holes in the earth to that in which I stood in speechless\nadmiration! with its vapory clouds, its electric light, and the mighty\nocean slumbering in its bosom! Imagination, not description, can alone\ngive an idea of the splendor and vastness of the cave.\n\nI gazed at these marvels in profound silence. Words were utterly wanting\nto indicate the sensations of wonder I experienced. I seemed, as I stood\nupon that mysterious shore, as if I were some wandering inhabitant of a\ndistant planet, present for the first time at the spectacle of some\nterrestrial phenomena belonging to another existence. To give body and\nexistence to such new sensations would have required the coinage of new\nwords--and here my feeble brain found itself wholly at fault. I looked\non, I thought, I reflected, I admired, in a state of stupefaction not\naltogether unmingled with fear!\n\nThe unexpected spectacle restored some color to my pallid cheeks. I\nseemed to be actually getting better under the influence of this\nnovelty. Moreover, the vivacity of the dense atmosphere reanimated my\nbody by inflating my lungs with unaccustomed oxygen.\n\nIt will be readily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty-seven\ndays, in a dark and miserable tunnel it was with infinite delight that I\nbreathed this saline air. It was like the genial, reviving influence of\nthe salt sea waves.\n\nMy uncle had already got over the first surprise.\n\nWith the Latin poet Horace his idea was that--\n\n     Not to admire is all the art I know,\n\n     To make man happy and to keep him so.\n\n\n\"Well,\" he said, after giving me time thoroughly to appreciate the\nmarvels of this underground sea, \"do you feel strong enough to walk up\nand down?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" was my ready answer, \"nothing would give me greater\npleasure.\"\n\n\"Well then, my boy,\" he said, \"lean on my arm, and we will stroll along\nthe beach.\"\n\nI accepted his offer eagerly, and we began to walk along the shores of\nthis extraordinary lake. To our left were abrupt rocks, piled one upon\nthe other--a stupendous titanic pile; down their sides leaped\ninnumerable cascades, which at last, becoming limpid and murmuring\nstreams, were lost in the waters of the lake. Light vapors, which rose\nhere and there, and floated in fleecy clouds from rock to rock,\nindicated hot springs, which also poured their superfluity into the vast\nreservoir at our feet.\n\nAmong them I recognized our old and faithful stream, the Hansbach,\nwhich, lost in that wild basin, seemed as if it had been flowing since\nthe creation of the world.\n\n\"We shall miss our excellent friend,\" I remarked, with a deep sigh.\n\n\"Bah!\" said my uncle testily, \"what matters it? That or another, it is\nall the same.\"\n\nI thought the remark ungrateful, and felt almost inclined to say so; but\nI forbore.\n\nAt this moment my attention was attracted by an unexpected spectacle.\nAfter we had gone about five hundred yards, we suddenly turned a steep\npromontory, and found ourselves close to a lofty forest! It consisted of\nstraight trunks with tufted tops, in shape like parasols. The air seemed\nto have no effect upon these trees--which in spite of a tolerable breeze\nremained as still and motionless as if they had been petrified.\n\nI hastened forward. I could find no name for these singular formations.\nDid they not belong to the two thousand and more known trees--or were we\nto make the discovery of a new growth? By no means. When we at last\nreached the forest, and stood beneath the trees, my surprise gave way to\nadmiration.\n\nIn truth, I was simply in the presence of a very ordinary product of the\nearth, of singular and gigantic proportions. My uncle unhesitatingly\ncalled them by their real names.\n\n\"It is only,\" he said, in his coolest manner, \"a forest of mushrooms.\"\n\nOn close examination I found that he was not mistaken. Judge of the\ndevelopment attained by this product of damp hot soils. I had heard that\nthe Lycoperdon giganteum reaches nine feet in circumference, but here\nwere white mushrooms, nearly forty feet high, and with tops of equal\ndimensions. They grew in countless thousands--the light could not make\nits way through their massive substance, and beneath them reigned a\ngloomy and mystic darkness.\n\nStill I wished to go forward. The cold in the shades of this singular\nforest was intense. For nearly an hour we wandered about in this visible\ndarkness. At length I left the spot, and once more returned to the\nshores of the lake, to light and comparative warmth.\n\nBut the amazing vegetation of subterraneous land was not confined to\ngigantic mushrooms. New wonders awaited us at every step. We had not\ngone many hundred yards, when we came upon a mighty group of other trees\nwith discolored leaves--the common humble trees of Mother Earth, of an\nexorbitant and phenomenal size: lycopods a hundred feet high; flowering\nferns as tall as pines; gigantic grasses!\n\n\"Astonishing, magnificent, splendid!\" cried my uncle; \"here we have\nbefore us the whole flora of the second period of the world, that of\ntransition. Behold the humble plants of our gardens, which in the first\nages of the world were mighty trees. Look around you, my dear Harry. No\nbotanist ever before gazed on such a sight!\"\n\nMy uncle's enthusiasm, always a little more than was required, was now\nexcusable.\n\n\"You are right, Uncle,\" I remarked. \"Providence appears to have designed\nthe preservation in this vast and mysterious hothouse of antediluvian\nplants, to prove the sagacity of learned men in figuring them so\nmarvelously on paper.\"\n\n\"Well said, my boy--very well said; it is indeed a mighty hothouse. But\nyou would also be within the bounds of reason and common sense, if you\nadded that it is also a vast menagerie.\"\n\nI looked rather anxiously around. If the animals were as exaggerated as\nthe plants, the matter would certainly be serious.\n\n\"A menagerie?\"\n\n\"Doubtless. Look at the dust we are treading under foot--behold the\nbones with which the whole soil of the seashore is covered--\"\n\n\"Bones,\" I replied, \"yes, certainly, the bones of antediluvian animals.\"\n\nI stooped down as I spoke, and picked up one or two singular remains,\nrelics of a bygone age. It was easy to give a name to these gigantic\nbones, in some instances as big as trunks of trees.\n\n\"Here is, clearly, the lower jawbone of a mastodon,\" I cried, almost as\nwarmly and enthusiastically as my uncle; \"here are the molars of the\nDinotherium; here is a leg bone which belonged to the Megatherium. You\nare right, Uncle, it is indeed a menagerie; for the mighty animals to\nwhich these bones once belonged, have lived and died on the shores of\nthis subterranean sea, under the shadow of these plants. Look, yonder\nare whole skeletons--and yet--\"\n\n\"And yet, nephew?\" said my uncle, noticing that I suddenly came to a\nfull stop.\n\n\"I do not understand the presence of such beasts in granite caverns,\nhowever vast and prodigious,\" was my reply.\n\n\"Why not?\" said my uncle, with very much of his old professional\nimpatience.\n\n\"Because it is well known that animal life only existed on earth during\nthe secondary period, when the sedimentary soil was formed by the\nalluviums, and thus replaced the hot and burning rocks of the primitive\nage.\"\n\n\"I have listened to you earnestly and with patience, Harry, and I have a\nsimple and clear answer to your objections: and that is, that this\nitself is a sedimentary soil.\"\n\n\"How can that be at such enormous depth from the surface of the earth?\"\n\n\"The fact can be explained both simply and geologically. At a certain\nperiod, the earth consisted only of an elastic crust, liable to\nalternative upward and downward movements in virtue of the law of\nattraction. It is very probable that many a landslip took place in those\ndays, and that large portions of sedimentary soil were cast into huge\nand mighty chasms.\"\n\n\"Quite possible,\" I dryly remarked. \"But, Uncle, if these antediluvian\nanimals formerly lived in these subterranean regions, what more likely\nthan that one of these monsters may at this moment be concealed behind\none of yonder mighty rocks.\"\n\nAs I spoke, I looked keenly around, examining with care every point of\nthe horizon; but nothing alive appeared to exist on these deserted\nshores.\n\nI now felt rather fatigued, and told my uncle so. The walk and\nexcitement were too much for me in my weak state. I therefore seated\nmyself at the end of a promontory, at the foot of which the waves broke\nin incessant rolls. I looked round a bay formed by projections of vast\ngranitic rocks. At the extreme end was a little port protected by huge\npyramids of stones. A brig and three or four schooners might have lain\nthere with perfect ease. So natural did it seem, that every minute my\nimagination induced me to expect a vessel coming out under all sail and\nmaking for the open sea under the influence of a warm southerly breeze.\n\nBut the fantastic illusion never lasted more than a minute. We were the\nonly living creatures in this subterranean world!\n\nDuring certain periods there was an utter cessation of wind, when a\nsilence deeper, more terrible than the silence of the desert fell upon\nthese solitary and arid rocks--and seemed to hang like a leaden weight\nupon the waters of this singular ocean. I sought, amid the awful\nstillness, to penetrate through the distant fog, to tear down the veil\nwhich concealed the mysterious distance. What unspoken words were\nmurmured by my trembling lips--what questions did I wish to ask and did\nnot! Where did this sea end--to what did it lead? Should we ever be able\nto examine its distant shores?\n\nBut my uncle had no doubts about the matter. He was convinced that our\nenterprise would in the end be successful. For my part, I was in a state\nof painful indecision--I desired to embark on the journey and to\nsucceed, and still I feared the result.\n\nAfter we had passed an hour or more in silent contemplation of the\nwondrous spectacle, we rose and went down towards the bank on our way to\nthe grotto, which I was not sorry to gain. After a slight repast, I\nsought refuge in slumber, and at length, after many and tedious\nstruggles, sleep came over my weary eyes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 28\n\nLAUNCHING THE RAFT\n\n\nOn the morning of the next day, to my great surprise, I awoke completely\nrestored. I thought a bath would be delightful after my long illness and\nsufferings. So, soon after rising, I went and plunged into the waters of\nthis new Mediterranean. The bath was cool, fresh and invigorating.\n\nI came back to breakfast with an excellent appetite. Hans, our worthy\nguide, thoroughly understood how to cook such eatables as we were able\nto provide; he had both fire and water at discretion, so that he was\nenabled slightly to vary the weary monotony of our ordinary repast.\n\nOur morning meal was like a capital English breakfast, with coffee by\nway of a windup. And never had this delicious beverage been so welcome\nand refreshing.\n\nMy uncle had sufficient regard for my state of health not to interrupt\nme in the enjoyment of the meal, but he was evidently delighted when I\nhad finished.\n\n\"Now then,\" said he, \"come with me. It is the height of the tide, and I\nam anxious to study its curious phenomena.\"\n\n\"What!\"' I cried, rising in astonishment, \"did you say the tide, Uncle?\"\n\n\"Certainly I did.\"\n\n\"You do not mean to say,\" I replied, in a tone of respectful doubt,\n\"that the influence of the sun and moon is felt here below.\"\n\n\"And pray why not? Are not all bodies influenced by the law of universal\nattraction? Why should this vast underground sea be exempt from the\ngeneral law, the rule of the universe? Besides, there is nothing like\nthat which is proved and demonstrated. Despite the great atmospheric\npressure down here, you will notice that this inland sea rises and falls\nwith as much regularity as the Atlantic itself.\"\n\nAs my uncle spoke, we reached the sandy shore, and saw and heard the\nwaves breaking monotonously on the beach. They were evidently rising.\n\n\"This is truly the flood,\" I cried, looking at the water at my feet.\n\n\"Yes, my excellent nephew,\" replied my uncle, rubbing his hands with the\ngusto of a philosopher, \"and you see by these several streaks of foam\nthat the tide rises at least ten or twelve feet.\"\n\n\"It is indeed marvelous.\"\n\n\"By no means,\" he responded; \"on the contrary, it is quite natural.\"\n\n\"It may appear so in your eyes, my dear uncle,\" was my reply, \"but all\nthe phenomena of the place appear to me to partake of the marvelous. It\nis almost impossible to believe that which I see. Who in his wildest\ndreams could have imagined that, beneath the crust of our earth, there\ncould exist a real ocean, with ebbing and flowing tides, with its\nchanges of winds, and even its storms! I for one should have laughed the\nsuggestion to scorn.\"\n\n\"But, Harry, my boy, why not?\" inquired my uncle, with a pitying smile;\n\"is there any physical reason in opposition to it?\"\n\n\"Well, if we give up the great theory of the central heat of the earth,\nI certainly can offer no reasons why anything should be looked upon as\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"Then you will own,\" he added, \"that the system of Sir Humphry Davy is\nwholly justified by what we have seen?\"\n\n\"I allow that it is--and that point once granted, I certainly can see no\nreason for doubting the existence of seas and other wonders, even\ncountries, in the interior of the globe.\"\n\n\"That is so--but of course these varied countries are uninhabited?\"\n\n\"Well, I grant that it is more likely than not: still, I do not see why\nthis sea should not have given shelter to some species of unknown fish.\"\n\n\"Hitherto we have not discovered any, and the probabilities are rather\nagainst our ever doing so,\" observed the Professor.\n\nI was losing my skepticism in the presence of these wonders.\n\n\"Well, I am determined to solve the question. It is my intention to try\nmy luck with my fishing line and hook.\"\n\n\"Certainly; make the experiment,\" said my uncle, pleased with my\nenthusiasm. \"While we are about it, it will certainly be only proper to\ndiscover all the secrets of this extraordinary region.\"\n\n\"But, after all, where are we now?\" I asked; \"all this time I have quite\nforgotten to ask you a question, which, doubtless, your philosophical\ninstruments have long since answered.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied the Professor, \"examining the situation from only one\npoint of view, we are now distant three hundred and fifty leagues from\nIceland.\"\n\n\"So much?\" was my exclamation.\n\n\"I have gone over the matter several times, and am sure not to have made\na mistake of five hundred yards,\" replied my uncle positively.\n\n\"And as to the direction--are we still going to the southeast?\"\n\n\"Yes, with a western declination[2] of nineteen degrees, forty-two\nminutes, just as it is above. As for the inclination[3] I have\ndiscovered a very curious fact.\"\n\n[2] The declination is the variation of the needle from the true\nmeridian of a place.\n\n[3] Inclination is the dip of the magnetic needle with a tendency to\nincline towards the earth.\n\n\"What may that be, Uncle? Your information interests me.\"\n\n\"Why, that the needle instead of dipping towards the pole as it does on\nearth, in the northern hemisphere, has an upward tendency.\"\n\n\"This proves,\" I cried, \"that the great point of magnetic attraction\nlies somewhere between the surface of the earth and the spot we have\nsucceeded in reaching.\"\n\n\"Exactly, my observant nephew,\" exclaimed my uncle, elated and\ndelighted, \"and it is quite probable that if we succeed in getting\ntoward the polar regions--somewhere near the seventy-third degree of\nlatitude, where Sir James Ross discovered the magnetic pole, we shall\nbehold the needle point directly upward. We have therefore discovered by\nanalogy, that this great centre of attraction is not situated at a very\ngreat depth.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, rather surprised, \"this discovery will astonish\nexperimental philosophers. It was never suspected.\"\n\n\"Science, great, mighty and in the end unerring,\" replied my uncle\ndogmatically, \"science has fallen into many errors--errors which have\nbeen fortunate and useful rather than otherwise, for they have been the\nsteppingstones to truth.\"\n\nAfter some further discussion, I turned to another matter.\n\n\"Have you any idea of the depth we have reached?\"\n\n\"We are now,\" continued the Professor, \"exactly thirty-five\nleagues--above a hundred miles--down into the interior of the earth.\"\n\n\"So,\" said I, after measuring the distance on the map, \"we are now\nbeneath the Scottish Highlands, and have over our heads the lofty\nGrampian Hills.\"\n\n\"You are quite right,\" said the Professor, laughing; \"it sounds very\nalarming, the weight being heavy--but the vault which supports this vast\nmass of earth and rock is solid and safe; the mighty Architect of the\nUniverse has constructed it of solid materials. Man, even in his highest\nflights of vivid and poetic imagination, never thought of such things!\nWhat are the finest arches of our bridges, what the vaulted roofs of our\ncathedrals, to that mighty dome above us, and beneath which floats an\nocean with its storms and calms and tides!\"\n\n\"I admire it all as much as you can, Uncle, and have no fear that our\ngranite sky will fall upon our heads. But now that we have discussed\nmatters of science and discovery, what are your future intentions? Are\nyou not thinking of getting back to the surface of our beautiful earth?\"\n\nThis was said more as a feeler than with any hope of success.\n\n\"Go back, nephew,\" cried my uncle in a tone of alarm, \"you are not\nsurely thinking of anything so absurd or cowardly. No, my intention is\nto advance and continue our journey. We have as yet been singularly\nfortunate, and henceforth I hope we shall be more so.\"\n\n\"But,\" said I, \"how are we to cross yonder liquid plain?\"\n\n\"It is not my intention to leap into it head foremost, or even to swim\nacross it, like Leander over the Hellespont. But as oceans are, after\nall, only great lakes, inasmuch as they are surrounded by land, so does\nit stand to reason, that this central sea is circumscribed by granite\nsurroundings.\"\n\n\"Doubtless,\" was my natural reply.\n\n\"Well, then, do you not think that when once we reach the other end, we\nshall find some means of continuing our journey?\"\n\n\"Probably, but what extent do you allow to this internal ocean?\"\n\n\"Well, I should fancy it to extend about forty or fifty leagues--more or\nless.\"\n\n\"But even supposing this approximation to be a correct one--what then?\"\nI asked.\n\n\"My dear boy, we have no time for further discussion. We shall embark\ntomorrow.\"\n\nI looked around with surprise and incredulity. I could see nothing in\nthe shape of boat or vessel.\n\n\"What!\" I cried, \"we are about to launch out upon an unknown sea; and\nwhere, if I may ask, is the vessel to carry us?\"\n\n\"Well, my dear boy, it will not be exactly what you would call a vessel.\nFor the present we must be content with a good and solid raft.\"\n\n\"A raft,\" I cried, incredulously, \"but down here a raft is as impossible\nof construction as a vessel--and I am at a loss to imagine--\"\n\n\"My good Harry--if you were to listen instead of talking so much, you\nwould hear,\" said my uncle, waxing a little impatient.\n\n\"I should hear?\"\n\n\"Yes--certain knocks with the hammer, which Hans is now employing to\nmake the raft. He has been at work for many hours.\"\n\n\"Making a raft?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But where has he found trees suitable for such a construction?\"\n\n\"He found the trees all ready to his hand. Come, and you shall see our\nexcellent guide at work.\"\n\nMore and more amazed at what I heard and saw, I followed my uncle like\none in a dream.\n\nAfter a walk of about a quarter of an hour, I saw Hans at work on the\nother side of the promontory which formed our natural port. A few\nminutes more and I was beside him. To my great surprise, on the sandy\nshore lay a half-finished raft. It was made from beams of a very\npeculiar wood, and a great number of limbs, joints, boughs, and pieces\nlay about, sufficient to have constructed a fleet of ships and boats.\n\nI turned to my uncle, silent with astonishment and awe.\n\n\"Where did all this wood come from?\" I cried; \"what wood is it?\"\n\n\"Well, there is pinewood, fir, and the palms of the northern regions,\nmineralized by the action of the sea,\" he replied, sententiously.\n\n\"Can it be possible?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the learned Professor, \"what you see is called fossil wood.\"\n\n\"But then,\" cried I, after reflecting for a moment, \"like the lignites,\nit must be as hard and as heavy as iron, and therefore will certainly\nnot float.\"\n\n\"Sometimes that is the case. Many of these woods have become true\nanthracites, but others again, like those you see before you, have only\nundergone one phase of fossil transformation. But there is no proof like\ndemonstration,\" added my uncle, picking one or two of these precious\nwaifs and casting them into the sea.\n\nThe piece of wood, after having disappeared for a moment, came to the\nsurface, and floated about with the oscillation produced by wind and\ntide.\n\n\"Are you convinced?\" said my uncle, with a self-satisfied smile.\n\n\"I am convinced,\" I cried, \"that what I see is incredible.\"\n\nThe fact was that my journey into the interior of the earth was rapidly\nchanging all preconceived notions, and day by day preparing me for the\nmarvelous.\n\nI should not have been surprised to have seen a fleet of native canoes\nafloat upon that silent sea.\n\nThe very next evening, thanks to the industry and ability of Hans, the\nraft was finished. It was about ten feet long and five feet wide. The\nbeams bound together with stout ropes, were solid and firm, and once\nlaunched by our united efforts, the improvised vessel floated tranquilly\nupon the waters of what the Professor had well named the Central Sea.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 29\n\nON THE WATERS--A RAFT VOYAGE\n\n\nOn the thirteenth of August we were up betimes. There was no time to be\nlost. We now had to inaugurate a new kind of locomotion, which would\nhave the advantage of being rapid and not fatiguing.\n\nA mast, made of two pieces of wood fastened together, to give additional\nstrength, a yard made from another one, the sail a linen sheet from our\nbed. We were fortunately in no want of cordage, and the whole on trial\nappeared solid and seaworthy.\n\nAt six o'clock in the morning, when the eager and enthusiastic Professor\ngave the signal to embark, the victuals, the luggage, all our\ninstruments, our weapons, and a goodly supply of sweet water, which we\nhad collected from springs in the rocks, were placed on the raft.\n\nHans had, with considerable ingenuity, contrived a rudder, which enabled\nhim to guide the floating apparatus with ease. He took the tiller, as a\nmatter of course. The worthy man was as good a sailor as he was a guide\nand duck hunter. I then let go the painter which held us to the shore,\nthe sail was brought to the wind, and we made a rapid offing.\n\nOur sea voyage had at length commenced; and once more we were making for\ndistant and unknown regions.\n\nJust as we were about to leave the little port where the raft had been\nconstructed, my uncle, who was very strong as to geographic\nnomenclature, wanted to give it a name, and among others, suggested\nmine.\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"before you decide I have another to propose.\"\n\n\"Well; out with it.\"\n\n\"I should like to call it Gretchen. Port Gretchen will sound very well\non our future map.\"\n\n\"Well then, Port Gretchen let it be,\" said the Professor.\n\nAnd thus it was that the memory of my dear girl was attached to our\nadventurous and memorable expedition.\n\nWhen we left the shore the wind was blowing from the northward and\neastward. We went directly before the wind at a much greater speed than\nmight have been expected from a raft. The dense layers of atmosphere at\nthat depth had great propelling power and acted upon the sail with\nconsiderable force.\n\nAt the end of an hour, my uncle, who had been taking careful\nobservations, was enabled to judge of the rapidity with which we moved.\nIt was far beyond anything seen in the upper world.\n\n\"If,\" he said, \"we continue to advance at our present rate, we shall\nhave traveled at least thirty leagues in twenty-four hours. With a mere\nraft this is an almost incredible velocity.\"\n\nI certainly was surprised, and without making any reply went forward\nupon the raft. Already the northern shore was fading away on the edge of\nthe horizon. The two shores appeared to separate more and more, leaving\na wide and open space for our departure. Before me I could see nothing\nbut the vast and apparently limitless sea--upon which we floated--the\nonly living objects in sight.\n\nHuge and dark clouds cast their grey shadows below--shadows which seemed\nto crush that colorless and sullen water by their weight. Anything more\nsuggestive of gloom and of regions of nether darkness I never beheld.\nSilvery rays of electric light, reflected here and there upon some small\nspots of water, brought up luminous sparkles in the long wake of our\ncumbrous bark. Presently we were wholly out of sight of land; not a\nvestige could be seen, nor any indication of where we were going. So\nstill and motionless did we seem without any distant point to fix our\neyes on that but for the phosphoric light at the wake of the raft I\nshould have fancied that we were still and motionless.\n\nBut I knew that we were advancing at a very rapid rate.\n\nAbout twelve o'clock in the day, vast collections of seaweed were\ndiscovered surrounding us on all sides. I was aware of the extraordinary\nvegetative power of these plants, which have been known to creep along\nthe bottom of the great ocean, and stop the advance of large ships. But\nnever were seaweeds ever seen, so gigantic and wonderful as those of the\nCentral Sea. I could well imagine how, seen at a distance, tossing and\nheaving on the summit of the billows, the long lines of algae have been\ntaken for living things, and thus have been fertile sources of the\nbelief in sea serpents.\n\nOur raft swept past great specimens of fucus or seawrack, from three to\nfour thousand feet in length, immense, incredibly long, looking like\nsnakes that stretched out far beyond our horizon. It afforded me great\namusement to gaze on their variegated ribbon-like endless lengths. Hour\nafter hour passed without our coming to the termination of these\nfloating weeds. If my astonishment increased, my patience was well-nigh\nexhausted.\n\nWhat natural force could possibly have produced such abnormal and\nextraordinary plants? What must have been the aspect of the globe,\nduring the first centuries of its formation, when under the combined\naction of heat and humidity, the vegetable kingdom occupied its vast\nsurface to the exclusion of everything else?\n\nThese were considerations of never-ending interest for the geologist and\nthe philosopher.\n\nAll this while we were advancing on our journey; and at length night\ncame; but as I had remarked the evening before, the luminous state of\nthe atmosphere was in nothing diminished. Whatever was the cause, it was\na phenomenon upon the duration of which we could calculate with\ncertainty.\n\nAs soon as our supper had been disposed of, and some little speculative\nconversation indulged in, I stretched myself at the foot of the mast,\nand presently went to sleep.\n\nHans remained motionless at the tiller, allowing the raft to rise and\nfall on the waves. The wind being aft, and the sail square, all he had\nto do was to keep his oar in the centre.\n\nEver since we had taken our departure from the newly named Port\nGretchen, my worthy uncle had directed me to keep a regular log of our\nday's navigation, with instructions to put down even the most minute\nparticulars, every interesting and curious phenomenon, the direction of\nthe wind, our rate of sailing, the distance we went; in a word, every\nincident of our extraordinary voyage.\n\nFrom our log, therefore, I tell the story of our voyage on the Central\nSea.\n\n\nFriday, August 14th. A steady breeze from the northwest. Raft\nprogressing with extreme rapidity, and going perfectly straight. Coast\nstill dimly visible about thirty leagues to leeward. Nothing to be seen\nbeyond the horizon in front. The extraordinary intensity of the light\nneither increases nor diminishes. It is singularly stationary. The\nweather remarkably fine; that is to say, the clouds have ascended very\nhigh, and are light and fleecy, and surrounded by an atmosphere\nresembling silver in fusion.\n\nThermometer, +32 degrees centigrade.\n\nAbout twelve o'clock in the day our guide Hans having prepared and\nbaited a hook, cast his line into the subterranean waters. The bait he\nused was a small piece of meat, by means of which he concealed his hook.\nAnxious as I was, I was for a long time doomed to disappointment. Were\nthese waters supplied with fish or not? That was the important question.\nNo--was my decided answer. Then there came a sudden and rather hard tug.\nHans coolly drew it in, and with it a fish, which struggled violently to\nescape.\n\n\"A fish!\" cried my uncle.\n\n\"It is a sturgeon!\" I cried, \"certainly a small sturgeon.\"\n\nThe Professor examined the fish carefully, noting every characteristic;\nand he did not coincide in my opinion. The fish had a flat head, round\nbody, and the lower extremities covered with bony scales; its mouth was\nwholly without teeth, the pectoral fins, which were highly developed,\nsprouted direct from the body, which properly speaking had no tail. The\nanimal certainly belonged to the order in which naturalists class the\nsturgeon, but it differed from that fish in many essential particulars.\n\nMy uncle, after all, was not mistaken. After a long and patient\nexamination, he said:\n\n\"This fish, my dear boy, belongs to a family which has been extinct for\nages, and of which no trace has ever been found on earth, except fossil\nremains in the Devonian strata.\"\n\n\"You do not mean to say,\" I cried, \"that we have captured a live\nspecimen of a fish belonging to the primitive stock that existed before\nthe deluge?\"\n\n\"We have,\" said the Professor, who all this time was continuing his\nobservations, \"and you may see by careful examination that these fossil\nfish have no identity with existing species. To hold in one's hand,\ntherefore, a living specimen of the order, is enough to make a\nnaturalist happy for life.\"\n\n\"But,\" cried I, \"to what family does it belong?\"\n\n\"To the order of Ganoides--an order of fish having angular scales,\ncovered with bright enamel--forming one of the family of the\nCephalaspides, of the genus--\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" I remarked, as I noticed my uncle hesitated to conclude.\n\n\"To the genus Pterychtis--yes, I am certain of it. Still, though I am\nconfident of the correctness of my surmise, this fish offers to our\nnotice a remarkable peculiarity, never known to exist in any other fish\nbut those which are the natives of subterranean waters, wells, lakes, in\ncaverns, and suchlike hidden pools.\"\n\n\"And what may that be?\"\n\n\"It is blind.\"\n\n\"Blind!\" I cried, much surprised.\n\n\"Not only blind,\" continued the Professor, \"but absolutely without\norgans of sight.\"\n\nI now examined our discovery for myself. It was singular, to be sure,\nbut it was really a fact. This, however, might be a solitary instance, I\nsuggested. The hook was baited again and once more thrown into the\nwater. This subterranean ocean must have been tolerably well supplied\nwith fish, for in two hours we took a large number of Pterychtis, as\nwell as other fish belonging to another supposed extinct family--the\nDipterides (a genus of fish, furnished with two fins only, whence the\nname), though my uncle could not class it exactly. All, without\nexception, however, were blind. This unexpected capture enabled us to\nrenew our stock of provisions in a very satisfactory way.\n\nWe were now convinced that this subterranean sea contained only fish\nknown to us as fossil specimens--and fish and reptiles alike were all\nthe more perfect the farther back they dated their origin.\n\nWe began to hope that we should find some of those saurians which\nscience has succeeded in reconstructing from bits of bone or cartilage.\n\nI took up the telescope and carefully examined the horizon--looked over\nthe whole sea; it was utterly and entirely deserted. Doubtless we were\nstill too near the coast.\n\nAfter an examination of the ocean, I looked upward, towards the strange\nand mysterious sky. Why should not one of the birds reconstructed by the\nimmortal Cuvier flap his stupendous wings aloft in the dull strata of\nsubterranean air? It would, of course, find quite sufficient food from\nthe fish in the sea. I gazed for some time upon the void above. It was\nas silent and as deserted as the shores we had but lately left.\n\nNevertheless, though I could neither see nor discover anything, my\nimagination carried me away into wild hypotheses. I was in a kind of\nwaking dream. I thought I saw on the surface of the water those enormous\nantediluvian turtles as big as floating islands. Upon those dull and\nsomber shores passed a spectral row of the mammifers of early days, the\ngreat Liptotherium found in the cavernous hollow of the Brazilian hills,\nthe Mesicotherium, a native of the glacial regions of Siberia.\n\nFarther on, the pachydermatous Lophrodon, that gigantic tapir, which\nconcealed itself behind rocks, ready to do battle for its prey with the\nAnoplotherium, a singular animal partaking of the nature of the\nrhinoceros, the horse, the hippopotamus and the camel.\n\nThere was the giant Mastodon, twisting and turning his horrid trunk,\nwith which he crushed the rocks of the shore to powder, while the\nMegatherium--his back raised like a cat in a passion, his enormous claws\nstretched out, dug into the earth for food, at the same time that he\nawoke the sonorous echoes of the whole place with his terrible roar.\n\nHigher up still, the first monkey ever seen on the face of the globe\nclambered, gamboling and playing up the granite hills. Still farther\naway, ran the Pterodactyl, with the winged hand, gliding or rather\nsailing through the dense and compressed air like a huge bat.\n\nAbove all, near the leaden granitic sky, were immense birds, more\npowerful than the cassowary and the ostrich, which spread their mighty\nwings and fluttered against the huge stone vault of the inland sea.\n\nI thought, such was the effect of my imagination, that I saw this whole\ntribe of antediluvian creatures. I carried myself back to far ages, long\nbefore man existed--when, in fact, the earth was in too imperfect a\nstate for him to live upon it.\n\nMy dream was of countless ages before the existence of man. The\nmammifers first disappeared, then the mighty birds, then the reptiles of\nthe secondary period, presently the fish, the crustacea, the mollusks,\nand finally the vertebrata. The zoophytes of the period of transition in\ntheir turn sank into annihilation.\n\nThe whole panorama of the world's life before the historic period,\nseemed to be born over again, and mine was the only human heart that\nbeat in this unpeopled world! There were no more seasons; there were no\nmore climates; the natural heat of the world increased unceasingly, and\nneutralized that of the great radiant Sun.\n\nVegetation was exaggerated in an extraordinary manner. I passed like a\nshadow in the midst of brushwood as lofty as the giant trees of\nCalifornia, and trod underfoot the moist and humid soil, reeking with a\nrank and varied vegetation.\n\nI leaned against the huge column-like trunks of giant trees, to which\nthose of Canada were as ferns. Whole ages passed, hundreds upon hundreds\nof years were concentrated into a single day.\n\nNext, unrolled before me like a panorama, came the great and wondrous\nseries of terrestrial transformations. Plants disappeared; the granitic\nrocks lost all trace of solidity; the liquid state was suddenly\nsubstituted for that which had before existed. This was caused by\nintense heat acting on the organic matter of the earth. The waters\nflowed over the whole surface of the globe; they boiled; they were\nvolatilized, or turned into vapor; a kind of steam cloud wrapped the\nwhole earth, the globe itself becoming at last nothing but one huge\nsphere of gas, indescribable in color, between white heat and red, as\nbig and as brilliant as the sun.\n\nIn the very centre of this prodigious mass, fourteen hundred thousand\ntimes as large as our globe, I was whirled round in space, and brought\ninto close conjunction with the planets. My body was subtilized, or\nrather became volatile, and commingled in a state of atomic vapor, with\nthe prodigious clouds, which rushed forward like a mighty comet into\ninfinite space!\n\nWhat an extraordinary dream! Where would it finally take me? My feverish\nhand began to write down the marvelous details--details more like the\nimaginings of a lunatic than anything sober and real. I had during this\nperiod of hallucination forgotten everything--the Professor, the guide,\nand the raft on which we were floating. My mind was in a state of\nsemioblivion.\n\n\"What is the matter, Harry?\" said my uncle suddenly.\n\nMy eyes, which were wide opened like those of a somnambulist, were fixed\nupon him, but I did not see him, nor could I clearly make out anything\naround me.\n\n\"Take care, my boy,\" again cried my uncle, \"you will fall into the sea.\"\n\nAs he uttered these words, I felt myself seized on the other side by the\nfirm hand of our devoted guide. Had it not been for the presence of mind\nof Hans, I must infallibly have fallen into the waves and been drowned.\n\n\"Have you gone mad?\" cried my uncle, shaking me on the other side.\n\n\"What--what is the matter?\" I said at last, coming to myself.\n\n\"Are you ill, Henry?\" continued the Professor in an anxious tone.\n\n\"No--no; but I have had an extraordinary dream. It, however, has passed\naway. All now seems well,\" I added, looking around me with strangely\npuzzled eyes.\n\n\"All right,\" said my uncle; \"a beautiful breeze, a splendid sea. We are\ngoing along at a rapid rate, and if I am not out in my calculations we\nshall soon see land. I shall not be sorry to exchange the narrow limits\nof our raft for the mysterious strand of the subterranean ocean.\"\n\nAs my uncle uttered these words, I rose and carefully scanned the\nhorizon. But the line of water was still confounded with the lowering\nclouds that hung aloft, and in the distance appeared to touch the edge\nof the water.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 30\n\nTERRIFIC SAURIAN COMBAT\n\n\nSaturday, August 15th. The sea still retains its uniform monotony. The\nsame leaden hue, the same eternal glare from above. No indication of\nland being in sight. The horizon appears to retreat before us, more and\nmore as we advance.\n\nMy head, still dull and heavy from the effects of my extraordinary\ndream, which I cannot as yet banish from my mind.\n\nThe Professor, who has not dreamed, is, however, in one of his morose\nand unaccountable humors. Spends his time in scanning the horizon, at\nevery point of the compass. His telescope is raised every moment to his\neyes, and when he finds nothing to give any clue to our whereabouts, he\nassumes a Napoleonic attitude and walks anxiously.\n\nI remarked that my uncle, the Professor, had a strong tendency to resume\nhis old impatient character, and I could not but make a note of this\ndisagreeable circumstance in my journal. I saw clearly that it had\nrequired all the influence of my danger and suffering, to extract from\nhim one scintillation of humane feeling. Now that I was quite recovered,\nhis original nature had conquered and obtained the upper hand.\n\nAnd, after all, what had he to be angry and annoyed about, now more than\nat any other time? Was not the journey being accomplished under the most\nfavorable circumstances? Was not the raft progressing with the most\nmarvelous rapidity?\n\nWhat, then, could be the matter? After one or two preliminary hems, I\ndetermined to inquire.\n\n\"You seem uneasy, Uncle,\" said I, when for about the hundredth time he\nput down his telescope and walked up and down, muttering to himself.\n\n\"No, I am not uneasy,\" he replied in a dry harsh tone, \"by no means.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I should have said impatient,\" I replied, softening the force\nof my remark.\n\n\"Enough to make me so, I think.\"\n\n\"And yet we are advancing at a rate seldom attained by a raft,\" I\nremarked.\n\n\"What matters that?\" cried my uncle. \"I am not vexed at the rate we go\nat, but I am annoyed to find the sea so much vaster than I expected.\"\n\nI then recollected that the Professor, before our departure, had\nestimated the length of this subterranean ocean as at most about thirty\nleagues. Now we had traveled at least over thrice that distance without\ndiscovering any trace of the distant shore. I began to understand my\nuncle's anger.\n\n\"We are not going down,\" suddenly exclaimed the Professor. \"We are not\nprogressing with our great discoveries. All this is utter loss of time.\nAfter all, I did not come from home to undertake a party of pleasure.\nThis voyage on a raft over a pond annoys and wearies me.\"\n\nHe called this adventurous journey a party of pleasure, and this great\ninland sea a pond!\n\n\"But,\" argued I, \"if we have followed the route indicated by the great\nSaknussemm, we cannot be going far wrong.\"\n\n\"'That is the question,' as the great, the immortal Shakespeare, has it.\nAre we following the route indicated by that wondrous sage? Did\nSaknussemm ever fall in with this great sheet of water? If he did, did\nhe cross it? I begin to fear that the rivulet we adopted for a guide has\nled us wrong.\"\n\n\"In any case, we can never regret having come thus far. It is worth the\nwhole journey to have enjoyed this magnificent spectacle--it is\nsomething to have seen.\"\n\n\"I care nothing about seeing, nor about magnificent spectacles. I came\ndown into the interior of the earth with an object, and that object I\nmean to attain. Don't talk to me about admiring scenery, or any other\nsentimental trash.\"\n\nAfter this I thought it well to hold my tongue, and allow the Professor\nto bite his lips until the blood came, without further remark.\n\nAt six o'clock in the evening, our matter-of-fact guide, Hans, asked for\nhis week's salary, and receiving his three rix-dollars, put them\ncarefully in his pocket. He was perfectly contented and satisfied.\n\n\nSunday, August 16th. Nothing new to record. The same weather as before.\nThe wind has a slight tendency to freshen up, with signs of an\napproaching gale. When I awoke, my first observation was in regard to\nthe intensity of the light. I keep on fearing, day after day, that the\nextraordinary electric phenomenon should become first obscured, and then\ngo wholly out, leaving us in total darkness. Nothing, however, of the\nkind occurs. The shadow of the raft, its mast and sails, is clearly\ndistinguished on the surface of the water.\n\nThis wondrous sea is, after all, infinite in its extent. It must be\nquite as wide as the Mediterranean--or perhaps even as the great\nAtlantic Ocean. Why, after all, should it not be so?\n\nMy uncle has on more than one occasion, tried deep-sea soundings. He\ntied the cross of one of our heaviest crowbars to the extremity of a\ncord, which he allowed to run out to the extent of two hundred fathoms.\nWe had the greatest difficulty in hoisting in our novel kind of lead.\n\nWhen the crowbar was finally dragged on board, Hans called my attention\nto some singular marks upon its surface. The piece of iron looked as if\nit had been crushed between two very hard substances.\n\nI looked at our worthy guide with an inquiring glance.\n\n\"Tander,\" said he.\n\nOf course I was at a loss to understand. I turned round towards my\nuncle, absorbed in gloomy reflections. I had little wish to disturb him\nfrom his reverie. I accordingly turned once more towards our worthy\nIcelander.\n\nHans very quietly and significantly opened his mouth once or twice, as\nif in the act of biting, and in this way made me understand his meaning.\n\n\"Teeth!\" cried I, with stupefaction, as I examined the bar of iron with\nmore attention.\n\nYes. There can be no doubt about the matter. The indentations on the bar\nof iron are the marks of teeth! What jaws must the owner of such molars\nbe possessed of! Have we then, come upon a monster of unknown species,\nwhich still exists within the vast waste of waters--a monster more\nvoracious than a shark, more terrible and bulky than the whale? I am\nunable to withdraw my eyes from the bar of iron, actually half crushed!\n\nIs, then, my dream about to come true--a dread and terrible reality?\n\nAll day my thoughts were bent upon these speculations, and my\nimagination scarcely regained a degree of calmness and power of\nreflection until after a sleep of many hours.\n\nThis day, as on other Sundays, we observed as a day of rest and pious\nmeditation.\n\n\nMonday, August 17th. I have been trying to realize from memory the\nparticular instincts of those antediluvian animals of the secondary\nperiod, which succeeding to the mollusca, to the crustacea, and to the\nfish, preceded the appearance of the race of mammifers. The generation\nof reptiles then reigned supreme upon the earth. These hideous monsters\nruled everything in the seas of the secondary period, which formed the\nstrata of which the Jura mountains are composed. Nature had endowed them\nwith perfect organization. What a gigantic structure was theirs; what\nvast and prodigious strength they possessed!\n\nThe existing saurians, which include all such reptiles as lizards,\ncrocodiles, and alligators, even the largest and most formidable of\ntheir class, are but feeble imitations of their mighty sires, the\nanimals of ages long ago. If there were giants in the days of old, there\nwere also gigantic animals.\n\nI shuddered as I evolved from my mind the idea and recollection of these\nawful monsters. No eye of man had seen them in the flesh. They took\ntheir walks abroad upon the face of the earth thousands of ages before\nman came into existence, and their fossil bones, discovered in the\nlimestone, have allowed us to reconstruct them anatomically, and thus to\nget some faint idea of their colossal formation.\n\nI recollect once seeing in the great Museum of Hamburg the skeleton of\none of these wonderful saurians. It measured no less than thirty feet\nfrom the nose to the tail. Am I, then, an inhabitant of the earth of the\npresent day, destined to find myself face to face with a representative\nof this antediluvian family? I can scarcely believe it possible; I can\nhardly believe it true. And yet these marks of powerful teeth upon the\nbar of iron! Can there be a doubt from their shape that the bite is the\nbite of a crocodile?\n\nMy eyes stare wildly and with terror upon the subterranean sea. Every\nmoment I expect one of these monsters to rise from its vast cavernous\ndepths.\n\nI fancy that the worthy Professor in some measure shares my notions, if\nnot my fears, for, after an attentive examination of the crowbar, he\ncast his eyes rapidly over the mighty and mysterious ocean.\n\n\"What could possess him to leave the land,\" I thought, \"as if the depth\nof this water was of any importance to us. No doubt he has disturbed\nsome terrible monster in his watery home, and perhaps we may pay dearly\nfor our temerity.\"\n\nAnxious to be prepared for the worst, I examined our weapons, and saw\nthat they were in a fit state for use. My uncle looked on at me and\nnodded his head approvingly. He, too, has noticed what we have to fear.\n\nAlready the uplifting of the waters on the surface indicates that\nsomething is in motion below. The danger approaches. It comes nearer and\nnearer. It behooves us to be on the watch.\n\n\nTuesday, August 18th. Evening came at last, the hour when the desire for\nsleep caused our eyelids to be heavy. Night there is not, properly\nspeaking, in this place, any more than there is in summer in the arctic\nregions. Hans, however, is immovable at the rudder. When he snatches a\nmoment of rest I really cannot say. I take advantage of his vigilance to\ntake some little repose.\n\nBut two hours after I was awakened from a heavy sleep by an awful shock.\nThe raft appeared to have struck upon a sunken rock. It was lifted right\nout of the water by some wondrous and mysterious power, and then started\noff twenty fathoms distant.\n\n\"Eh, what is it?\" cried my uncle starting up. \"Are we shipwrecked, or\nwhat?\"\n\nHans raised his hand and pointed to where, about two hundred yards off,\na large black mass was moving up and down.\n\nI looked with awe. My worst fears were realized.\n\n\"It is a colossal monster!\" I cried, clasping my hands.\n\n\"Yes,\" cried the agitated Professor, \"and there yonder is a huge sea\nlizard of terrible size and shape.\"\n\n\"And farther on behold a prodigious crocodile. Look at his hideous jaws,\nand that row of monstrous teeth. Ha! he has gone.\"\n\n\"A whale! a whale!\" shouted the Professor, \"I can see her enormous fins.\nSee, see, how she blows air and water!\"\n\nTwo liquid columns rose to a vast height above the level of the sea,\ninto which they fell with a terrific crash, waking up the echoes of that\nawful place. We stood still--surprised, stupefied, terror-stricken at\nthe sight of this group of fearful marine monsters, more hideous in the\nreality than in my dream. They were of supernatural dimensions; the very\nsmallest of the whole party could with ease have crushed our raft and\nourselves with a single bite.\n\nHans, seizing the rudder which had flown out of his hand, puts it hard\naweather in order to escape from such dangerous vicinity; but no sooner\ndoes he do so, than he finds he is flying from Scylla to Charybdis. To\nleeward is a turtle about forty feet wide, and a serpent quite as long,\nwith an enormous and hideous head peering from out the waters.\n\nLook which way we will, it is impossible for us to fly. The fearful\nreptiles advanced upon us; they turned and twisted about the raft with\nawful rapidity. They formed around our devoted vessel a series of\nconcentric circles. I took up my rifle in desperation. But what effect\ncan a rifle ball produce upon the armor scales with which the bodies of\nthese horrid monsters are covered?\n\nWe remain still and dumb from utter horror. They advance upon us, nearer\nand nearer. Our fate appears certain, fearful and terrible. On one side\nthe mighty crocodile, on the other the great sea serpent. The rest of\nthe fearful crowd of marine prodigies have plunged beneath the briny\nwaves and disappeared!\n\nI am about to fire at any risk and try the effect of a shot. Hans, the\nguide, however, interfered by a sign to check me. The two hideous and\nravenous monsters passed within fifty fathoms of the raft, and then made\na rush at one another--their fury and rage preventing them from seeing\nus.\n\nThe combat commenced. We distinctly made out every action of the two\nhideous monsters.\n\nBut to my excited imagination the other animals appeared about to take\npart in the fierce and deadly struggle--the monster, the whale, the\nlizard, and the turtle. I distinctly saw them every moment. I pointed\nthem out to the Icelander. But he only shook his head.\n\n\"Tva,\" he said.\n\n\"What--two only does he say. Surely he is mistaken,\" I cried in a tone\nof wonder.\n\n\"He is quite right,\" replied my uncle coolly and philosophically,\nexamining the terrible duel with his telescope and speaking as if he\nwere in a lecture room.\n\n\"How can that be?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is so. The first of these hideous monsters has the snout of a\nporpoise, the head of a lizard, the teeth of a crocodile; and it is this\nthat has deceived us. It is the most fearful of all antediluvian\nreptiles, the world--renowned Ichthyosaurus or great fish lizard.\"\n\n\"And the other?\"\n\n\"The other is a monstrous serpent, concealed under the hard vaulted\nshell of the turtle, the terrible enemy of its fearful rival, the\nPlesiosaurus, or sea crocodile.\"\n\nHans was quite right. The two monsters only, disturbed the surface of\nthe sea!\n\nAt last have mortal eyes gazed upon two reptiles of the great primitive\nocean! I see the flaming red eyes of the Ichthyosaurus, each as big, or\nbigger than a man's head. Nature in its infinite wisdom had gifted this\nwondrous marine animal with an optical apparatus of extreme power,\ncapable of resisting the pressure of the heavy layers of water which\nrolled over him in the depths of the ocean where he usually fed. It has\nby some authors truly been called the whale of the saurian race, for it\nis as big and quick in its motions as our king of the seas. This one\nmeasures not less than a hundred feet in length, and I can form some\nidea of his girth when I see him lift his prodigious tail out of the\nwaters. His jaw is of awful size and strength, and according to the\nbest-informed naturalists, it does not contain less than a hundred and\neighty-two teeth.\n\nThe other was the mighty Plesiosaurus, a serpent with a cylindrical\ntrunk, with a short stumpy tail, with fins like a bank of oars in a\nRoman galley.\n\nIts whole body covered by a carapace or shell, and its neck, as flexible\nas that of a swan, rose more than thirty feet above the waves, a tower\nof animated flesh!\n\nThese animals attacked one another with inconceivable fury. Such a\ncombat was never seen before by mortal eyes, and to us who did see it,\nit appeared more like the phantasmagoric creation of a dream than\nanything else. They raised mountains of water, which dashed in spray\nover the raft, already tossed to and fro by the waves. Twenty times we\nseemed on the point of being upset and hurled headlong into the waves.\nHideous hisses appeared to shake the gloomy granite roof of that mighty\ncavern--hisses which carried terror to our hearts. The awful combatants\nheld each other in a tight embrace. I could not make out one from the\nother. Still the combat could not last forever; and woe unto us,\nwhichsoever became the victor.\n\nOne hour, two hours, three hours passed away, without any decisive\nresult. The struggle continued with the same deadly tenacity, but\nwithout apparent result. The deadly opponents now approached, now drew\naway from the raft. Once or twice we fancied they were about to leave us\naltogether, but instead of that, they came nearer and nearer.\n\nWe crouched on the raft ready to fire at them at a moment's notice, poor\nas the prospect of hurting or terrifying them was. Still we were\ndetermined not to perish without a struggle.\n\nSuddenly the Ichthyosaurus and the Plesiosaurus disappeared beneath the\nwaves, leaving behind them a maelstrom in the midst of the sea. We were\nnearly drawn down by the indraft of the water!\n\nSeveral minutes elapsed before anything was again seen. Was this\nwonderful combat to end in the depths of the ocean? Was the last act of\nthis terrible drama to take place without spectators?\n\nIt was impossible for us to say.\n\nSuddenly, at no great distance from us, an enormous mass rises out of\nthe waters--the head of the great Plesiosaurus. The terrible monster is\nnow wounded unto death. I can see nothing now of his enormous body. All\nthat could be distinguished was his serpent-like neck, which he twisted\nand curled in all the agonies of death. Now he struck the waters with it\nas if it had been a gigantic whip, and then again wriggled like a worm\ncut in two. The water was spurted up to a great distance in all\ndirections. A great portion of it swept over our raft and nearly blinded\nus. But soon the end of the beast approached nearer and nearer; his\nmovements slackened visibly; his contortions almost ceased; and at last\nthe body of the mighty snake lay an inert, dead mass on the surface of\nthe now calm and placid waters.\n\nAs for the Ichthyosaurus, has he gone down to his mighty cavern under\nthe sea to rest, or will he reappear to destroy us?\n\nThis question remained unanswered. And we had breathing time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 31\n\nTHE SEA MONSTER\n\n\nWednesday, August 19th. Fortunately the wind, which for the present\nblows with some violence, has allowed us to escape from the scene of the\nunparalleled and extraordinary struggle. Hans with his usual\nimperturbable calm remained at the helm. My uncle, who for a short time\nhad been withdrawn from his absorbing reveries by the novel incidents of\nthis sea fight, fell back again apparently into a brown study. His eyes\nwere fixed impatiently on the widespread ocean.\n\nOur voyage now became monotonous and uniform. Dull as it has become, I\nhave no desire to have it broken by any repetition of the perils and\nadventures of yesterday.\n\n\nThursday, August 20th. The wind is now N. N. E., and blows very\nirregularly. It has changed to fitful gusts. The temperature is\nexceedingly high. We are now progressing at the average rate of about\nten miles and a half per hour.\n\nAbout twelve o'clock a distant sound as of thunder fell upon our ears. I\nmake a note of the fact without even venturing a suggestion as to its\ncause. It was one continued roar as of a sea falling over mighty rocks.\n\n\"Far off in the distance,\" said the Professor dogmatically, \"there is\nsome rock or some island against which the sea lashed to fury by the\nwind, is breaking violently.\"\n\nHans, without saying a word, clambered to the top of the mast, but could\nmake out nothing. The ocean was level in every direction as far as the\neye could reach.\n\nThree hours passed away without any sign to indicate what might be\nbefore us. The sound began to assume that of a mighty cataract.\n\nI expressed my opinion on this point strongly to my uncle. He merely\nshook his head. I, however, am strongly impressed by a conviction that I\nam not wrong. Are we advancing towards some mighty waterfall which shall\ncast us into the abyss? Probably this mode of descending into the abyss\nmay be agreeable to the Professor, because it would be something like\nthe vertical descent he is so eager to make. I entertain a very\ndifferent opinion.\n\nWhatever be the truth, it is certain that not many leagues distant there\nmust be some very extraordinary phenomenon, for as we advance the roar\nbecomes something mighty and stupendous. Is it in the water, or in the\nair?\n\nI cast hasty glances aloft at the suspended vapors, and I seek to\npenetrate their mighty depths. But the vault above is tranquil. The\nclouds, which are now elevated to the very summit, appear utterly still\nand motionless, and completely lost in the irradiation of electric\nlight. It is necessary, therefore, to seek for the cause of this\nphenomenon elsewhere.\n\nI examine the horizon, now perfectly calm, pure, and free from all haze.\nIts aspect still remains unchanged. But if this awful noise proceeds\nfrom a cataract--if, so to speak in plain English, this vast interior\nocean is precipitated into a lower basin--if these tremendous roars are\nproduced by the noise of falling waters, the current would increase in\nactivity, and its increasing swiftness would give me some idea of the\nextent of the peril with which we are menaced. I consult the current. It\nsimply does not exist: there is no such thing. An empty bottle cast into\nthe water lies to leeward without motion.\n\nAbout four o'clock Hans rises, clambers up the mast, and reaches the\ntruck itself. From this elevated position his looks are cast around.\nThey take in a vast circumference of the ocean. At last, his eyes remain\nfixed. His face expresses no astonishment, but his eyes slightly dilate.\n\n\"He has seen something at last,\" cried my uncle.\n\n\"I think so,\" I replied.\n\nHans came down, stood beside us, and pointed with his right hand to the\nsouth.\n\n\"Der nere,\" he said.\n\n\"There,\" replied my uncle.\n\nAnd seizing his telescope, he looked at it with great attention for\nabout a minute, which to me appeared an age. I knew not what to think or\nexpect.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" he cried in a tone of considerable surprise, \"there it is.\"\n\n\"What?\" I asked.\n\n\"A tremendous spurt of water rising out of the waves.\"\n\n\"Some other marine monster,\" I cried, already alarmed.\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"Then let us steer more to the westward, for we know what we have to\nexpect from antediluvian animals,\" was my eager reply.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" said my uncle.\n\nI turned towards Hans. Hans was at the tiller steering with his usual\nimperturbable calm.\n\nNevertheless, if from the distance which separated us from this\ncreature, a distance which must be estimated at not less than a dozen\nleagues, one could see the column of water spurting from the blow-hole\nof the great animal, his dimensions must be something preternatural. To\nfly is, therefore, the course to be suggested by ordinary prudence. But\nwe have not come into that part of the world to be prudent. Such is my\nuncle's determination.\n\nWe, accordingly, continued to advance. The nearer we come, the loftier\nis the spouting water. What monster can fill himself with such huge\nvolumes of water, and then unceasingly spout them out in such lofty\njets?\n\nAt eight o'clock in the evening, reckoning as above ground, where there\nis day and night, we are not more than two leagues from the mighty\nbeast. Its long, black, enormous, mountainous body, lies on the top of\nthe water like an island. But then sailors have been said to have gone\nashore on sleeping whales, mistaking them for land. Is it illusion, or\nis it fear? Its length cannot be less than a thousand fathoms. What,\nthen, is this cetaceous monster of which no Cuvier ever thought?\n\nIt is quite motionless and presents the appearance of sleep. The sea\nseems unable to lift him upwards; it is rather the waves which break on\nhis huge and gigantic frame. The waterspout, rising to a height of five\nhundred feet, breaks in spray with a dull, sullen roar.\n\nWe advance, like senseless lunatics, towards this mighty mass.\n\nI honestly confess that I was abjectly afraid. I declared that I would\ngo no farther. I threatened in my terror to cut the sheet of the sail. I\nattacked the Professor with considerable acrimony, calling him\nfoolhardy, mad, I know not what. He made no answer.\n\nSuddenly the imperturbable Hans once more pointed his finger to the\nmenacing object:\n\n\"<i>Holme</i>!\"\n\n\"An island!\" cried my uncle.\n\n\"An island?\" I replied, shrugging my shoulders at this poor attempt at\ndeception.\n\n\"Of course it is,\" cried my uncle, bursting into a loud and joyous\nlaugh.\n\n\"But the waterspout?\"\n\n\"Geyser,\" said Hans.\n\n\"Yes, of course--a geyser,\" replied my uncle, still laughing, \"a geyser\nlike those common in Iceland. Jets like this are the great wonders of\nthe country.\"\n\nAt first I would not allow that I had been so grossly deceived. What\ncould be more ridiculous than to have taken an island for a marine\nmonster? But kick as one may, one must yield to evidence, and I was\nfinally convinced of my error. It was nothing, after all, but a natural\nphenomenon.\n\nAs we approached nearer and nearer, the dimensions of the liquid sheaf\nof waters became truly grand and stupendous. The island had, at a\ndistance, presented the appearance of an enormous whale, whose head rose\nhigh above the waters. The geyser, a word the Icelanders pronounce\ngeysir, and which signifies fury, rose majestically from its summit.\nDull detonations are heard every now and then, and the enormous jet,\ntaken as it were with sudden fury, shakes its plume of vapor, and bounds\ninto the first layer of the clouds. It is alone. Neither spurts of vapor\nnor hot springs surround it, and the whole volcanic power of that region\nis concentrated in one sublime column. The rays of electric light mix\nwith this dazzling sheaf, every drop as it falls assuming the prismatic\ncolors of the rainbow.\n\n\"Let us go on shore,\" said the Professor, after some minutes of silence.\n\nIt is necessary, however, to take great precaution, in order to avoid\nthe weight of falling waters, which would cause the raft to founder in\nan instant. Hans, however, steers admirably, and brings us to the other\nextremity of the island.\n\nI was the first to leap on the rock. My uncle followed, while the\neider-duck hunter remained still, like a man above any childish sources\nof astonishment. We were now walking on granite mixed with siliceous\nsandstone; the soil shivered under our feet like the sides of boilers in\nwhich over-heated steam is forcibly confined. It is burning. We soon\ncame in sight of the little central basin from which rose the geyser. I\nplunged a thermometer into the water which ran bubbling from the centre,\nand it marked a heat of a hundred and sixty-three degrees!\n\nThis water, therefore, came from some place where the heat was intense.\nThis was singularly in contradiction with the theories of Professor\nHardwigg. I could not help telling him my opinion on the subject.\n\n\"Well,\" said he sharply, \"and what does this prove against my doctrine?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied I dryly, seeing that I was running my head against a\nforegone conclusion.\n\nNevertheless, I am compelled to confess that until now we have been most\nremarkably fortunate, and that this voyage is being accomplished in most\nfavorable conditions of temperature; but it appears evident, in fact,\ncertain, that we shall sooner or later arrive at one of those regions\nwhere the central heat will reach its utmost limits, and will go far\nbeyond all the possible gradations of thermometers.\n\nVisions of the Hades of the ancients, believed to be in the centre of\nthe earth, floated through my imagination.\n\nWe shall, however, see what we shall see. That is the Professor's\nfavorite phrase now. Having christened the volcanic island by the name\nof his nephew, the leader of the expedition turned away and gave the\nsignal for embarkation.\n\nI stood still, however, for some minutes, gazing upon the magnificent\ngeyser. I soon was able to perceive that the upward tendency of the\nwater was irregular; now it diminished in intensity, and then, suddenly,\nit regained new vigor, which I attributed to the variation of the\npressure of the accumulated vapors in its reservoir.\n\nAt last we took our departure, going carefully round the projecting, and\nrather dangerous, rocks of the southern side. Hans had taken advantage\nof this brief halt to repair the raft.\n\nBefore we took our final departure from the island, however, I made some\nobservations to calculate the distance we had gone over, and I put them\ndown in my journal. Since we left Port Gretchen, we had traveled two\nhundred and seventy leagues--more than eight hundred miles--on this\ngreat inland sea; we were, therefore, six hundred and twenty leagues\nfrom Iceland, and exactly under England.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 32\n\nTHE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS\n\n\nFriday, August 21st. This morning the magnificent geyser had wholly\ndisappeared. The wind had freshened up, and we were fast leaving the\nneighborhood of Henry's Island. Even the roaring sound of the mighty\ncolumn was lost to the ear.\n\nThe weather, if, under the circumstances, we may use such an expression,\nis about to change very suddenly. The atmosphere is being gradually\nloaded with vapors, which carry with them the electricity formed by the\nconstant evaporation of the saline waters; the clouds are slowly but\nsensibly falling towards the sea, and are assuming a dark-olive texture;\nthe electric rays can scarcely pierce through the opaque curtain which\nhas fallen like a drop scene before this wondrous theater, on the stage\nof which another and terrible drama is soon to be enacted. This time it\nis no fight of animals; it is the fearful battle of the elements.\n\nI feel that I am very peculiarly influenced, as all creatures are on\nland when a deluge is about to take place.\n\nThe cumuli, a perfectly oval kind of cloud, piled upon the south,\npresented a most awful and sinister appearance, with the pitiless aspect\noften seen before a storm. The air is extremely heavy; the sea is\ncomparatively calm.\n\nIn the distance, the clouds have assumed the appearance of enormous\nballs of cotton, or rather pods, piled one above the other in\npicturesque confusion. By degrees, they appear to swell out, break, and\ngain in number what they lose in grandeur; their heaviness is so great\nthat they are unable to lift themselves from the horizon; but under the\ninfluence of the upper currents of air, they are gradually broken up,\nbecome much darker, and then present the appearance of one single layer\nof a formidable character; now and then a lighter cloud, still lit up\nfrom above, rebounds upon this grey carpet, and is lost in the opaque\nmass.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the entire atmosphere is saturated with\nelectric fluid; I am myself wholly impregnated; my hairs literally stand\non end as if under the influence of a galvanic battery. If one of my\ncompanions ventured to touch me, I think he would receive rather a\nviolent and unpleasant shock.\n\nAbout ten o'clock in the morning, the symptoms of the storm became more\nthorough and decisive; the wind appeared to soften down as if to take\nbreath for a renewed attack; the vast funereal pall above us looked like\na huge bag--like the cave of AEolus, in which the storm was collecting\nits forces for the attack.\n\nI tried all I could not to believe in the menacing signs of the sky, and\nyet I could not avoid saying, as it were involuntarily:\n\n\"I believe we are going to have bad weather.\"\n\nThe Professor made me no answer. He was in a horrible, in a detestable\nhumor--to see the ocean stretching interminably before his eyes. On\nhearing my words he simply shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"We shall have a tremendous storm,\" I said again, pointing to the\nhorizon. \"These clouds are falling lower and lower upon the sea, as if\nto crush it.\"\n\nA great silence prevailed. The wind wholly ceased. Nature assumed a dead\ncalm, and ceased to breathe. Upon the mast, where I noticed a sort of\nslight ignis fatuus, the sail hangs in loose heavy folds. The raft is\nmotionless in the midst of a dark heavy sea--without undulation, without\nmotion. It is as still as glass. But as we are making no progress, what\nis the use of keeping up the sail, which may be the cause of our\nperdition if the tempest should suddenly strike us without warning.\n\n\"Let us lower the sail,\" I said, \"it is only an act of common prudence.\"\n\n\"No--no,\" cried my uncle, in an exasperated tone, \"a hundred times, no.\nLet the wind strike us and do its worst, let the storm sweep us away\nwhere it will--only let me see the glimmer of some coast--of some rocky\ncliffs, even if they dash our raft into a thousand pieces. No! keep up\nthe sail--no matter what happens.\"\n\nThese words were scarcely uttered when the southern horizon underwent a\nsudden and violent change. The long accumulated vapors were resolved\ninto water, and the air required to fill up the void produced became a\nwild and raging tempest.\n\nIt came from the most distant corners of the mighty cavern. It raged\nfrom every point of the compass. It roared; it yelled; it shrieked with\nglee as of demons let loose. The darkness increased and became indeed\ndarkness visible.\n\nThe raft rose and fell with the storm, and bounded over the waves. My\nuncle was cast headlong upon the deck. I with great difficulty dragged\nmyself towards him. He was holding on with might and main to the end of\na cable, and appeared to gaze with pleasure and delight at the spectacle\nof the unchained elements.\n\nHans never moved a muscle. His long hair driven hither and thither by\nthe tempest and scattered wildly over his motionless face, gave him a\nmost extraordinary appearance--for every single hair was illuminated by\nlittle sparkling sprigs.\n\nHis countenance presents the extraordinary appearance of an antediluvian\nman, a true contemporary of the Megatherium.\n\nStill the mast holds good against the storm. The sail spreads out and\nfills like a soap bubble about to burst. The raft rushes on at a pace\nimpossible to estimate, but still less swiftly than the body of water\ndisplaced beneath it, the rapidity of which may be seen by the lines\nwhich fly right and left in the wake.\n\n\"The sail, the sail!\" I cried, making a trumpet of my hands, and then\nendeavoring to lower it.\n\n\"Let it alone!\" said my uncle, more exasperated than ever.\n\n\"<i>Nej</i>,\" said Hans, gently shaking his head.\n\nNevertheless, the rain formed a roaring cataract before this horizon of\nwhich we were in search, and to which we were rushing like madmen.\n\nBut before this wilderness of waters reached us, the mighty veil of\ncloud was torn in twain; the sea began to foam wildly; and the\nelectricity, produced by some vast and extraordinary chemical action in\nthe upper layer of cloud, is brought into play. To the fearful claps of\nthunder are added dazzling flashes of lightning, such as I had never\nseen. The flashes crossed one another, hurled from every side; while the\nthunder came pealing like an echo. The mass of vapor becomes\nincandescent; the hailstones which strike the metal of our boots and our\nweapons are actually luminous; the waves as they rise appear to be\nfire-eating monsters, beneath which seethes an intense fire, their\ncrests surmounted by combs of flame.\n\nMy eyes are dazzled, blinded by the intensity of light, my ears are\ndeafened by the awful roar of the elements. I am compelled to hold onto\nthe mast, which bends like a reed beneath the violence of the storm, to\nwhich none ever before seen by mariners bore any resemblance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHere my traveling notes become very incomplete, loose and vague. I have\nonly been able to make out one or two fugitive observations, jotted down\nin a mere mechanical way. But even their brevity, even their obscurity,\nshow the emotions which overcame me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSunday, August 23rd. Where have we got to? In what region are we\nwandering? We are still carried forward with inconceivable rapidity.\n\nThe night has been fearful, something not to be described. The storm\nshows no signs of cessation. We exist in the midst of an uproar which\nhas no name. The detonations as of artillery are incessant. Our ears\nliterally bleed. We are unable to exchange a word, or hear each other\nspeak.\n\nThe lightning never ceases to flash for a single instant. I can see the\nzigzags after a rapid dart strike the arched roof of this mightiest of\nmighty vaults. If it were to give way and fall upon us! Other lightnings\nplunge their forked streaks in every direction, and take the form of\nglobes of fire, which explode like bombshells over a beleaguered city.\nThe general crash and roar do not apparently increase; it has already\ngone far beyond what human ear can appreciate. If all the powder\nmagazines in the world were to explode together, it would be impossible\nfor us to hear worse noise.\n\nThere is a constant emission of light from the storm clouds; the\nelectric matter is incessantly released; evidently the gaseous\nprinciples of the air are out of order; innumerable columns of water\nrush up like waterspouts, and fall back upon the surface of the ocean in\nfoam.\n\nWhither are we going? My uncle still lies at full length upon the raft,\nwithout speaking--without taking any note of time.\n\nThe heat increases. I look at the thermometer, to my surprise it\nindicates--<i>The exact figure is here rubbed out in my manuscript.</i>\n\n\nMonday, August 24th. This terrible storm will never end. Why should not\nthis state of the atmosphere, so dense and murky, once modified, again\nremain definitive?\n\nWe are utterly broken and harassed by fatigue. Hans remains just as\nusual. The raft runs to the southeast invariably. We have now already\nrun two hundred leagues from the newly discovered island.\n\nAbout twelve o'clock the storm became worse than ever. We are obliged\nnow to fasten every bit of cargo tightly on the deck of the raft, or\neverything would be swept away. We make ourselves fast, too, each man\nlashing the other. The waves drive over us, so that several times we are\nactually under water.\n\nWe had been under the painful necessity of abstaining from speech for\nthree days and three nights. We opened our mouths, we moved our lips,\nbut no sound came. Even when we placed our mouths to each other's ears\nit was the same.\n\nThe wind carried the voice away.\n\nMy uncle once contrived to get his head close to mine after several\nalmost vain endeavors. He appeared to my nearly exhausted senses to\narticulate some word. I had a notion, more from intuition than anything\nelse, that he said to me, \"We are lost.\"\n\nI took out my notebook, from which under the most desperate\ncircumstances I never parted, and wrote a few words as legibly as I\ncould:\n\n\"Take in sail.\"\n\nWith a deep sigh he nodded his head and acquiesced.\n\nHis head had scarcely time to fall back in the position from which he\nhad momentarily raised it than a disk or ball of fire appeared on the\nvery edge of the raft--our devoted, our doomed craft. The mast and sail\nare carried away bodily, and I see them swept away to a prodigious\nheight like a kite.\n\nWe were frozen, actually shivered with terror. The ball of fire, half\nwhite, half azure-colored, about the size of a ten-inch bombshell, moved\nalong, turning with prodigious rapidity to leeward of the storm. It ran\nabout here, there, and everywhere, it clambered up one of the bulwarks\nof the raft, it leaped upon the sack of provisions, and then finally\ndescended lightly, fell like a football and landed on our powder barrel.\n\nHorrible situation. An explosion of course was now inevitable.\n\nBy heaven's mercy, it was not so.\n\nThe dazzling disk moved on one side, it approached Hans, who looked at\nit with singular fixity; then it approached my uncle, who cast himself\non his knees to avoid it; it came towards me, as I stood pale and\nshuddering in the dazzling light and heat; it pirouetted round my feet,\nwhich I endeavored to withdraw.\n\nAn odor of nitrous gas filled the whole air; it penetrated to the\nthroat, to the lungs. I felt ready to choke.\n\nWhy is it that I cannot withdraw my feet? Are they riveted to the\nflooring of the raft?\n\nNo.\n\nThe fall of the electric globe has turned all the iron on board into\nloadstones--the instruments, the tools, the arms are clanging together\nwith awful and horrible noise; the nails of my heavy boots adhere\nclosely to the plate of iron incrustated in the wood. I cannot withdraw\nmy foot.\n\nIt is the old story again of the mountain of adamant.\n\nAt last, by a violent and almost superhuman effort, I tear it away just\nas the ball which is still executing its gyratory motions is about to\nrun round it and drag me with it--if--\n\nOh, what intense stupendous light! The globe of fire bursts--we are\nenveloped in cascades of living fire, which flood the space around with\nluminous matter.\n\nThen all went out and darkness once more fell upon the deep! I had just\ntime to see my uncle once more cast apparently senseless on the flooring\nof the raft, Hans at the helm, \"spitting fire\" under the influence of\nthe electricity which seemed to have gone through him.\n\nWhither are we going, I ask? and echo answers, Whither?\n\n.............\n\nTuesday, August 25th. I have just come out of a long fainting fit. The\nawful and hideous storm still continues; the lightning has increased in\nvividness, and pours out its fiery wrath like a brood of serpents let\nloose in the atmosphere.\n\nAre we still upon the sea? Yes, and being carried along with incredible\nvelocity.\n\nWe have passed under England, under the Channel, under France, probably\nunder the whole extent of Europe.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother awful clamor in the distance. This time it is certain that the\nsea is breaking upon the rocks at no great distance. Then--\n\n..............\n\n..............\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 33\n\nOUR ROUTE REVERSED\n\n\nHere ends what I call \"My Journal\" of our voyage on board the raft,\nwhich journal was happily saved from the wreck. I proceed with my\nnarrative as I did before I commenced my daily notes.\n\nWhat happened when the terrible shock took place, when the raft was cast\nupon the rocky shore, it would be impossible for me now to say. I felt\nmyself precipitated violently into the boiling waves, and if I escaped\nfrom a certain and cruel death, it was wholly owing to the determination\nof the faithful Hans, who, clutching me by the arm, saved me from the\nyawning abyss.\n\nThe courageous Icelander then carried me in his powerful arms, far out\nof the reach of the waves, and laid me down upon a burning expanse of\nsand, where I found myself some time afterwards in the company of my\nuncle, the Professor.\n\nThen he quietly returned towards the fatal rocks, against which the\nfurious waves were beating, in order to save any stray waifs from the\nwreck. This man was always practical and thoughtful. I could not utter a\nword; I was quite overcome with emotion; my whole body was broken and\nbruised with fatigue; it took hours before I was anything like myself.\n\nMeanwhile, there fell a fearful deluge of rain, drenching us to the\nskin. Its very violence, however, proclaimed the approaching end of the\nstorm. Some overhanging rocks afforded us a slight protection from the\ntorrents.\n\nUnder this shelter, Hans prepared some food, which, however, I was\nunable to touch; and, exhausted by the three weary days and nights of\nwatching, we fell into a deep and painful sleep. My dreams were fearful,\nbut at last exhausted nature asserted her supremacy, and I slumbered.\n\nNext day when I awoke the change was magical. The weather was\nmagnificent. Air and sea, as if by mutual consent, had regained their\nserenity. Every trace of the storm, even the faintest, had disappeared.\nI was saluted on my awakening by the first joyous tones I had heard from\nthe Professor for many a day. His gaiety, indeed, was something\nterrible.\n\n\"Well, my lad,\" he cried, rubbing his hands together, \"have you slept\nsoundly?\"\n\nMight it not have been supposed that we were in the old house on the\nKonigstrasse; that I had just come down quietly to my breakfast; and\nthat my marriage with Gretchen was to take place that very day? My\nuncle's coolness was exasperating.\n\nAlas, considering how the tempest had driven us in an easterly\ndirection, we had passed under the whole of Germany, under the city of\nHamburg where I had been so happy, under the very street which contained\nall I loved and cared for in the world.\n\nIt was a positive fact that I was only separated from her by a distance\nof forty leagues. But these forty leagues were of hard, impenetrable\ngranite!\n\nAll these dreary and miserable reflections passed through my mind,\nbefore I attempted to answer my uncle's question.\n\n\"Why, what is the matter?\" he cried. \"Cannot you say whether you have\nslept well or not?\"\n\n\"I have slept very well,\" was my reply, \"but every bone in my body\naches. I suppose that will lead to nothing.\"\n\n\"Nothing at all, my boy. It is only the result of the fatigue of the\nlast few days--that is all.\"\n\n\"You appear--if I may be allowed to say so--to be very jolly this\nmorning,\" I said.\n\n\"Delighted, my dear boy, delighted. Was never happier in my life. We\nhave at last reached the wished-for port.\"\n\n\"The end of our expedition?\" cried I, in a tone of considerable\nsurprise.\n\n\"No; but to the confines of that sea which I began to fear would never\nend, but go round the whole world. We will now tranquilly resume our\njourney by land, and once again endeavor to dive into the centre of the\nearth.\"\n\n\"My dear uncle,\" I began, in a hesitating kind of way, \"allow me to ask\nyou one question.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Harry; a dozen if you think proper.\"\n\n\"One will suffice. How about getting back?\" I asked.\n\n\"How about getting back? What a question to ask. We have not as yet\nreached the end of our journey.\"\n\n\"I know that. All I want to know is how you propose we shall manage the\nreturn voyage?\"\n\n\"In the most simple manner in the world,\" said the imperturbable\nProfessor. \"Once we reach the exact centre of this sphere, either we\nshall find a new road by which to ascend to the surface, or we shall\nsimply turn round and go back by the way we came. I have every reason to\nbelieve that while we are traveling forward, it will not close behind\nus.\"\n\n\"Then one of the first matters to see to will be to repair the raft,\"\nwas my rather melancholy response.\n\n\"Of course. We must attend to that above all things,\" continued the\nProfessor.\n\n\"Then comes the all-important question of provisions,\" I urged. \"Have we\nanything like enough left to enable us to accomplish such great, such\namazing, designs as you contemplate carrying out?\"\n\n\"I have seen into the matter, and my answer is in the affirmative. Hans\nis a very clever fellow, and I have reason to believe that he has saved\nthe greater part of the cargo. But the best way to satisfy your scruples\nis to come and judge for yourself.\"\n\nSaying which, he led the way out of the kind of open grotto in which we\nhad taken shelter. I had almost begun to hope that which I should rather\nhave feared, and this was the impossibility of such a shipwreck leaving\neven the slightest signs of what it had carried as freight. I was,\nhowever, thoroughly mistaken.\n\nAs soon as I reached the shores of this inland sea, I found Hans\nstanding gravely in the midst of a large number of things laid out in\ncomplete order. My uncle wrung his hands with deep and silent gratitude.\nHis heart was too full for speech.\n\nThis man, whose superhuman devotion to his employers I not only never\nsaw surpassed, nor even equaled, had been hard at work all the time we\nslept, and at the risk of his life had succeeded in saving the most\nprecious articles of our cargo.\n\nOf course, under the circumstances, we necessarily experienced several\nsevere losses. Our weapons had wholly vanished. But experience had\ntaught us to do without them. The provision of powder had, however,\nremained intact, after having narrowly escaped blowing us all to atoms\nin the storm.\n\n\"Well,\" said the Professor, who was now ready to make the best of\neverything, \"as we have no guns, all we have to do is to give up all\nidea of hunting.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear sir, we can do without them, but what about all our\ninstruments?\"\n\n\"Here is the manometer, the most useful of all, and which I gladly\naccept in lieu of the rest. With it alone I can calculate the depth as\nwe proceed; by its means alone I shall be able to decide when we have\nreached the centre of the earth. Ha, ha! but for this little instrument\nwe might make a mistake, and run the risk of coming out at the\nantipodes!\"\n\nAll this was said amid bursts of unnatural laughter.\n\n\"But the compass,\" I cried, \"without that what can we do?\"\n\n\"Here it is, safe and sound!\" he cried, with real joy, \"ah, ah, and here\nwe have the chronometer and the thermometers. Hans the hunter is indeed\nan invaluable man!\"\n\nIt was impossible to deny this fact. As far as the nautical and other\ninstruments were concerned, nothing was wanting. Then on further\nexamination, I found ladders, cords, pickaxes, crowbars, and shovels,\nall scattered about on the shore.\n\nThere was, however, finally the most important question of all, and that\nwas, provisions.\n\n\"But what are we to do for food?\" I asked.\n\n\"Let us see to the commissariat department\", replied my uncle gravely.\n\nThe boxes which contained our supply of food for the voyage were placed\nin a row along the strand, and were in a capital state of preservation;\nthe sea had in every case respected their contents, and to sum up in one\nsentence, taking into consideration, biscuits, salt meat, Schiedam and\ndried fish, we could still calculate on having about four months'\nsupply, if used with prudence and caution.\n\n\"Four months,\" cried the sanguine Professor in high glee. \"Then we shall\nhave plenty of time both to go and to come, and with what remains I\nundertake to give a grand dinner to my colleagues of the Johanneum.\"\n\nI sighed. I should by this time have become used to the temperament of\nmy uncle, and yet this man astonished me more and more every day. He was\nthe greatest human enigma I ever had known.\n\n\"Now,\" he, \"before we do anything else, we must lay in a stock of fresh\nwater. The rain has fallen in abundance, and filled the hollows of the\ngranite. There is a rich supply of water, and we have no fear of\nsuffering from thirst, which in our circumstances is of the last\nimportance. As for the raft, I shall recommend Hans to repair it to the\nbest of his abilities; though I have every reason to believe we shall\nnot require it again.\"\n\n\"How is that?\" I cried, more amazed than ever at my uncle's style of\nreasoning.\n\n\"I have an idea, my dear boy; it is none other than this simple fact; we\nshall not come out by the same opening as that by which we entered.\"\n\nI began to look at my uncle with vague suspicion. An idea had more than\nonce taken possession of me; and this was, that he was going mad. And\nyet, little did I think how true and prophetic his words were doomed to\nbe.\n\n\"And now,\" he said, \"having seen to all these matters of detail, to\nbreakfast.\"\n\nI followed him to a sort of projecting cape, after he had given his last\ninstructions to our guide. In this original position, with dried meat,\nbiscuit, and a delicious cup of tea, we made a satisfactory meal--I may\nsay one of the most welcome and pleasant I ever remember. Exhaustion,\nthe keen atmosphere, the state of calm after so much agitation, all\ncontributed to give me an excellent appetite. Indeed, it contributed\nvery much to producing a pleasant and cheerful state of mind.\n\nWhile breakfast was in hand, and between the sips of warm tea, I asked\nmy uncle if he had any idea of how we now stood in relation to the world\nabove.\n\n\"For my part,\" I added, \"I think it will be rather difficult to\ndetermine.\"\n\n\"Well, if we were compelled to fix the exact spot,\" said my uncle, \"it\nmight be difficult, since during the three days of that awful tempest I\ncould keep no account either of the quickness of our pace, or of the\ndirection in which the raft was going. Still, we will endeavor to\napproximate to the truth. We shall not, I believe, be so very far out.\"\n\n\"Well, if I recollect rightly,\" I replied, \"our last observation was\nmade at the geyser island.\"\n\n\"Harry's Island, my boy! Harry's Island. Do not decline the honor of\nhaving named it; given your name to an island discovered by us, the\nfirst human beings who trod it since the creation of the world!\"\n\n\"Let it be so, then. At Harry's Island we had already gone over two\nhundred and seventy leagues of sea, and we were, I believe, about six\nhundred leagues, more or less, from Iceland.\"\n\n\"Good. I am glad to see that you remember so well. Let us start from\nthat point, and let us count four days of storm, during which our rate\nof traveling must have been very great. I should say that our velocity\nmust have been about eighty leagues to the twenty-four hours.\"\n\nI agreed that I thought this a fair calculation. There were then three\nhundred leagues to be added to the grand total.\n\n\"Yes, and the Central Sea must extend at least six hundred leagues from\nside to side. Do you know, my boy, Harry, that we have discovered an\ninland lake larger than the Mediterranean?\"\n\n\"Certainly, and we only know of its extent in one way. It may be\nhundreds of miles in length.\"\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said I, after calculating for some for some minutes, \"if your\nprevisions are right, we are at this moment exactly under the\nMediterranean itself.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am almost certain of it. Are we not nine hundred leagues distant\nfrom Reykjavik?\"\n\n\"That is perfectly true, and a famous bit of road we have traveled, my\nboy. But why we should be under the Mediterranean more than under Turkey\nor the Atlantic Ocean can only be known when we are sure of not having\ndeviated from our course; and of this we know nothing.\"\n\n\"I do not think we were driven very far from our course; the wind\nappears to me to have been always about the same. My opinion is that\nthis shore must be situated to the southeast of Port Gretchen.\"\n\n\"Good--I hope so. It will, however, be easy to decide the matter by\ntaking the bearings from our departure by means of the compass. Come\nalong, and we will consult that invaluable invention.\"\n\nThe Professor now walked eagerly in the direction of the rock where the\nindefatigable Hans had placed the instruments in safety. My uncle was\ngay and lighthearted; he rubbed his hands, and assumed all sorts of\nattitudes. He was to all appearance once more a young man. Since I had\nknown him, never had he been so amiable and pleasant. I followed him,\nrather curious to know whether I had made any mistake in my estimation\nof our position.\n\nAs soon as we had reached the rock, my uncle took the compass, placed it\nhorizontally before him, and looked keenly at the needle.\n\nAs he had at first shaken it to give it vivacity, it oscillated\nconsiderably, and then slowly assumed its right position under the\ninfluence of the magnetic power.\n\nThe Professor bent his eyes curiously over the wondrous instrument. A\nviolent start immediately showed the extent of his emotion.\n\nHe closed his eyes, rubbed them, and took another and a keener survey.\n\nThen he turned slowly round to me, stupefaction depicted on his\ncountenance.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" said I, beginning to be alarmed.\n\nHe could not speak. He was too overwhelmed for words. He simply pointed\nto the instrument.\n\nI examined it eagerly according to his mute directions, and a loud cry\nof surprise escaped my lips. The needle of the compass pointed due\nnorth--in the direction we expected was the south!\n\nIt pointed to the shore instead of to the high seas.\n\nI shook the compass; I examined it with a curious and anxious eye. It\nwas in a state of perfection. No blemish in any way explained the\nphenomenon. Whatever position we forced the needle into, it returned\ninvariably to the same unexpected point.\n\nIt was useless attempting to conceal from ourselves the fatal truth.\n\nThere could be no doubt about it, unwelcome as was the fact, that during\nthe tempest, there had been a sudden slant of wind, of which we had been\nunable to take any account, and thus the raft had carried us back to the\nshores we had left, apparently forever, so many days before!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 34\n\nA VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY\n\n\nIt would be altogether impossible for me to give any idea of the utter\nastonishment which overcame the Professor on making this extraordinary\ndiscovery. Amazement, incredulity, and rage were blended in such a way\nas to alarm me.\n\nDuring the whole course of my Life I had never seen a man at first so\nchapfallen; and then so furiously indignant.\n\nThe terrible fatigues of our sea voyage, the fearful dangers we had\npassed through, had all, all, gone for nothing. We had to begin them all\nover again.\n\nInstead of progressing, as we fondly expected, during a voyage of so\nmany days, we had retreated. Every hour of our expedition on the raft\nhad been so much lost time!\n\nPresently, however, the indomitable energy of my uncle overcame every\nother consideration.\n\n\"So,\" he said, between his set teeth, \"fatality will play me these\nterrible tricks. The elements themselves conspire to overwhelm me with\nmortification. Air, fire, and water combine their united efforts to\noppose my passage. Well, they shall see what the earnest will of a\ndetermined man can do. I will not yield, I will not retreat even one\ninch; and we shall see who shall triumph in this great contest--man or\nnature.\"\n\nStanding upright on a rock, irritated and menacing, Professor Hardwigg,\nlike the ferocious Ajax, seemed to defy the fates. I, however, took upon\nmyself to interfere, and to impose some sort of check upon such\ninsensate enthusiasm.\n\n\"Listen to me, Uncle,\" I said, in a firm but temperate tone of voice,\n\"there must be some limit to ambition here below. It is utterly useless\nto struggle against the impossible. Pray listen to reason. We are\nutterly unprepared for a sea voyage; it is simply madness to think of\nperforming a journey of five hundred leagues upon a wretched pile of\nbeams, with a counterpane for a sail, a paltry stick for a mast, and a\ntempest to contend with. As we are totally incapable of steering our\nfrail craft, we shall become the mere plaything of the storm, and it is\nacting the part of madmen if we, a second time, run any risk upon this\ndangerous and treacherous Central Sea.\"\n\nThese are only a few of the reasons and arguments I put\ntogether--reasons and arguments which to me appeared unanswerable. I was\nallowed to go on without interruption for about ten minutes. The\nexplanation to this I soon discovered. The Professor was not even\nlistening, and did not hear a word of all my eloquence.\n\n\"To the raft!\" he cried in a hoarse voice, when I paused for a reply.\n\nSuch was the result of my strenuous effort to resist his iron will. I\ntried again; I begged and implored him; I got into a passion; but I had\nto deal with a will more determined than my own. I seemed to feel like\nthe waves which fought and battled against the huge mass of granite at\nour feet, which had smiled grimly for so many ages at their puny\nefforts.\n\nHans, meanwhile, without taking part in our discussion, had been\nrepairing the raft. One would have supposed that he instinctively\nguessed at the further projects of my uncle.\n\nBy means of some fragments of cordage, he had again made the raft\nseaworthy.\n\nWhile I had been speaking, he had hoisted a new mast and sail, the\nlatter already fluttering and waving in the breeze.\n\nThe worthy Professor spoke a few words to our imperturbable guide, who\nimmediately began to put our baggage on board and to prepare for our\ndeparture. The atmosphere was now tolerably clear and pure, and the\nnortheast wind blew steadily and serenely. It appeared likely to last\nfor some time.\n\nWhat, then, could I do? Could I undertake to resist the iron will of two\nmen? It was simply impossible if even I could have hoped for the support\nof Hans. This, however, was out of the question. It appeared to me that\nthe Icelander had set aside all personal will and identity. He was a\npicture of abnegation.\n\nI could hope for nothing from one so infatuated with and devoted to his\nmaster. All I could do, therefore, was to swim with the stream.\n\nIn a mood of stolid and sullen resignation, I was about to take my\naccustomed place on the raft when my uncle placed his hand upon my\nshoulder.\n\n\"There is no hurry, my boy,\" he said, \"we shall not start until\ntomorrow.\"\n\nI looked the picture of resignation to the dire will of fate.\n\n\"Under the circumstances,\" he said, \"I ought to neglect no precautions.\nAs fate has cast me upon these shores, I shall not leave without having\ncompletely examined them.\"\n\nIn order to understand this remark, I must explain that though we had\nbeen driven back to the northern shore, we had landed at a very\ndifferent spot from that which had been our starting point.\n\nPort Gretchen must, we calculated, be very much to the westward.\nNothing, therefore, was more natural and reasonable than that we should\nreconnoiter this new shore upon which we had so unexpectedly landed.\n\n\"Let us go on a journey of discovery,\" I cried.\n\nAnd leaving Hans to his important operation, we started on our\nexpedition. The distance between the foreshore at high water and the\nfoot of the rocks was considerable. It would take about half an hour's\nwalking to get from one to the other.\n\nAs we trudged along, our feet crushed innumerable shells of every shape\nand size--once the dwelling place of animals of every period of\ncreation.\n\nI particularly noticed some enormous shells--carapaces (turtle and\ntortoise species) the diameter of which exceeded fifteen feet.\n\nThey had in past ages belonged to those gigantic Glyptodons of the\nPliocene period, of which the modern turtle is but a minute specimen. In\naddition, the whole soil was covered by a vast quantity of stony relics,\nhaving the appearance of flints worn by the action of the waves, and\nlying in successive layers one above the other. I came to the conclusion\nthat in past ages the sea must have covered the whole district. Upon the\nscattered rocks, now lying far beyond its reach, the mighty waves of\nages had left evident marks of their passage.\n\nOn reflection, this appeared to me partially to explain the existence of\nthis remarkable ocean, forty leagues below the surface of the earth's\ncrust. According to my new, and perhaps fanciful, theory, this liquid\nmass must be gradually lost in the deep bowels of the earth. I had also\nno doubt that this mysterious sea was fed by infiltration of the ocean\nabove, through imperceptible fissures.\n\nNevertheless, it was impossible not to admit that these fissures must\nnow be nearly choked up, for if not, the cavern, or rather the immense\nand stupendous reservoir, would have been completely filled in a short\nspace of time. Perhaps even this water, having to contend against the\naccumulated subterraneous fires of the interior of the earth, had become\npartially vaporized. Hence the explanation of those heavy clouds\nsuspended over our heads, and the superabundant display of that\nelectricity which occasioned such terrible storms in this deep and\ncavernous sea.\n\nThis lucid explanation of the phenomena we had witnessed appeared to me\nquite satisfactory. However great and mighty the marvels of nature may\nseem to us, they are always to be explained by physical reasons.\nEverything is subordinate to some great law of nature.\n\nIt now appeared clear that we were walking upon a kind of sedimentary\nsoil, formed like all the soils of that period, so frequent on the\nsurface of the globe, by the subsidence of the waters. The Professor,\nwho was now in his element, carefully examined every rocky fissure. Let\nhim only find an opening and it directly became important to him to\nexamine its depth.\n\nFor a whole mile we followed the windings of the Central Sea, when\nsuddenly an important change took place in the aspect of the soil. It\nseemed to have been rudely cast up, convulsionized, as it were, by a\nviolent upheaving of the lower strata. In many places, hollows here and\nhillocks there attested great dislocations at some other period of the\nterrestrial mass.\n\nWe advanced with great difficulty over the broken masses of granite\nmixed with flint, quartz, and alluvial deposits, when a large field,\nmore even than a field, a plain of bones, appeared suddenly before our\neyes! It looked like an immense cemetery, where generation after\ngeneration had mingled their mortal dust.\n\nLofty barrows of early remains rose at intervals. They undulated away to\nthe limits of the distant horizon and were lost in a thick and brown\nfog.\n\nOn that spot, some three square miles in extent, was accumulated the\nwhole history of animal life--scarcely one creature upon the\ncomparatively modern soil of the upper and inhabited world had not there\nexisted.\n\nNevertheless, we were drawn forward by an all-absorbing and impatient\ncuriosity. Our feet crushed with a dry and crackling sound the remains\nof those prehistoric fossils, for which the museums of great cities\nquarrel, even when they obtain only rare and curious morsels. A thousand\nsuch naturalists as Cuvier would not have sufficed to recompose the\nskeletons of the organic beings which lay in this magnificent osseous\ncollection.\n\nI was utterly confounded. My uncle stood for some minutes with his arms\nraised on high towards the thick granite vault which served us for a\nsky. His mouth was wide open; his eyes sparkled wildly behind his\nspectacles (which he had fortunately saved), his head bobbed up and down\nand from side to side, while his whole attitude and mien expressed\nunbounded astonishment.\n\nHe stood in the presence of an endless, wondrous, and inexhaustibly rich\ncollection of antediluvian monsters, piled up for his own private and\npeculiar satisfaction.\n\nFancy an enthusiastic lover of books carried suddenly into the very\nmidst of the famous library of Alexandria burned by the sacrilegious\nOmar, and which some miracle had restored to its pristine splendor! Such\nwas something of the state of mind in which Uncle Hardwigg was now\nplaced.\n\nFor some time he stood thus, literally aghast at the magnitude of his\ndiscovery.\n\nBut it was even a greater excitement when, darting wildly over this mass\nof organic dust, he caught up a naked skull and addressed me in a\nquivering voice:\n\n\"Harry, my boy--Harry--this is a human head!\"\n\n\"A human head, Uncle!\" I said, no less amazed and stupefied than\nhimself.\n\n\"Yes, nephew. Ah! Mr. Milne-Edwards--ah! Mr. De Quatrefages--why are you\nnot here where I am--I, Professor Hardwigg!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 35\n\nDISCOVERY UPON DISCOVERY\n\n\nIn order fully to understand the exclamation made by my uncle, and his\nallusions to these illustrious and learned men, it will be necessary to\nenter into certain explanations in regard to a circumstance of the\nhighest importance to paleontology, or the science of fossil life, which\nhad taken place a short time before our departure from the upper regions\nof the earth.\n\nOn the 28th of March, 1863, some navigators under the direction of M.\nBoucher de Perthes, were at work in the great quarries of\nMoulin-Quignon, near Abbeville, in the department of the Somme, in\nFrance. While at work, they unexpectedly came upon a human jawbone\nburied fourteen feet below the surface of the soil. It was the first\nfossil of the kind that had ever been brought to the light of day. Near\nthis unexpected human relic were found stone hatchets and carved flints,\ncolored and clothed by time in one uniform brilliant tint of verdigris.\n\nThe report of this extraordinary and unexpected discovery spread not\nonly all over France, but over England and Germany. Many learned men\nbelonging to various scientific bodies, and noteworthy among others,\nMessrs. Milne-Edwards and De Quatrefages, took the affair very much to\nheart, demonstrated the incontestable authenticity of the bone in\nquestion, and became--to use the phrase then recognized in England--the\nmost ardent supporters of the \"jawbone question.\"\n\nTo the eminent geologists of the United Kingdom who looked upon the fact\nas certain--Messrs. Falconer, Buck, Carpenter, and others--were soon\nunited the learned men of Germany, and among those in the first rank,\nthe most eager, the most enthusiastic, was my worthy uncle, Professor\nHardwigg.\n\nThe authenticity of a human fossil of the Quaternary period seemed then\nto be incontestably demonstrated, and even to be admitted by the most\nskeptical.\n\nThis system or theory, call it what you will, had, it is true, a bitter\nadversary in M. Elie de Beaumont. This learned man, who holds such a\nhigh place in the scientific world, holds that the soil of\nMoulin-Quignon does not belong to the diluvium but to a much less\nancient stratum, and, in accordance with Cuvier in this respect, he\nwould by no means admit that the human species was contemporary with the\nanimals of the Quaternary epoch. My worthy uncle, Professor Hardwigg, in\nconcert with the great majority of geologists, had held firm, had\ndisputed, discussed, and finally, after considerable talking and\nwriting, M. Elie de Beaumont had been pretty well left alone in his\nopinions.\n\nWe were familiar with all the details of this discussion, but were far\nfrom being aware then that since our departure the matter had entered\nupon a new phase. Other similar jawbones, though belonging to\nindividuals of varied types and very different natures, had been found\nin the movable grey sands of certain grottoes in France, Switzerland,\nand Belgium; together with arms, utensils, tools, bones of children, of\nmen in the prime of life, and of old men. The existence of men in the\nQuaternary period became, therefore, more positive every day.\n\nBut this was far from being all. New remains, dug up from the Pliocene\nor Tertiary deposits, had enabled the more far-seeing or audacious among\nlearned men to assign even a far greater degree of antiquity to the\nhuman race. These remains, it is true, were not those of men; that is,\nwere not the bones of men, but objects decidedly having served the human\nrace: shinbones, thighbones of fossil animals, regularly scooped out,\nand in fact sculptured--bearing the unmistakable signs of human\nhandiwork.\n\nBy means of these wondrous and unexpected discoveries, man ascended\nendless centuries in the scale of time; he, in fact, preceded the\nmastodon; became the contemporary of the <i>Elephas meridionalis</i>--the\nsouthern elephant; acquired an antiquity of over a hundred thousand\nyears, since that is the date given by the most eminent geologists to\nthe Pliocene period of the earth. Such was then the state of\npaleontologic science, and what we moreover knew sufficed to explain our\nattitude before this great cemetery of the plains of the Hardwigg Ocean.\n\nIt will now be easy to understand the Professor's mingled astonishment\nand joy when, on advancing about twenty yards, he found himself in the\npresence of, I may say face to face with, a specimen of the human race\nactually belonging to the Quaternary period!\n\nIt was indeed a human skull, perfectly recognizable. Had a soil of very\npeculiar nature, like that of the cemetery of St. Michel at Bordeaux,\npreserved it during countless ages? This was the question I asked\nmyself, but which I was wholly unable to answer. But this head with\nstretched and parchmenty skin, with the teeth whole, the hair abundant,\nwas before our eyes as in life!\n\nI stood mute, almost paralyzed with wonder and awe before this dread\napparition of another age. My uncle, who on almost every occasion was a\ngreat talker, remained for a time completely dumfounded. He was too full\nof emotion for speech to be possible. After a while, however, we raised\nup the body to which the skull belonged. We stood it on end. It seemed,\nto our excited imaginations, to look at us with its terrible hollow\neyes.\n\nAfter some minutes of silence, the man was vanquished by the Professor.\nHuman instincts succumbed to scientific pride and exultation. Professor\nHardwigg, carried away by his enthusiasm, forgot all the circumstances\nof our journey, the extraordinary position in which we were placed, the\nimmense cavern which stretched far away over our heads. There can be no\ndoubt that he thought himself at the Institution addressing his\nattentive pupils, for he put on his most doctorial style, waved his\nhand, and began:\n\n\"Gentlemen, I have the honor on this auspicious occasion to present to\nyou a man of the Quaternary period of our globe. Many learned men have\ndenied his very existence, while other able persons, perhaps of even\nhigher authority, have affirmed their belief in the reality of his life.\nIf the St. Thomases of paleontology were present, they would\nreverentially touch him with their fingers and believe in his existence,\nthus acknowledging their obstinate heresy. I know that science should be\ncareful in relation to all discoveries of this nature. I am not without\nhaving heard of the many Barnums and other quacks who have made a trade\nof suchlike pretended discoveries. I have, of course, heard of the\ndiscovery of the kneebones of Ajax, of the pretended finding of the body\nof Orestes by the Spartiates, and of the body of Asterius, ten spans\nlong, fifteen feet--of which we read in Pausanias.\n\n\"I have read everything in relation to the skeleton of Trapani,\ndiscovered in the fourteenth century, and which many persons chose to\nregard as that of Polyphemus, and the history of the giant dug up during\nthe sixteenth century in the environs of Palmyra. You are well aware as\nI am, gentlemen, of the existence of the celebrated analysis made near\nLucerne, in 1577, of the great bones which the celebrated Doctor Felix\nPlater declared belonged to a giant about nineteen feet high. I have\ndevoured all the treatises of Cassanion, and all those memoirs,\npamphlets, speeches, and replies published in reference to the skeleton\nof Teutobochus, king of the Cimbri, the invader of Gaul, dug out of a\ngravel pit in Dauphine, in 1613. In the eighteenth century I should have\ndenied, with Peter Campet, the existence of the preadamites of\nScheuchzer. I have had in my hands the writing called Gigans--\"\n\nHere my uncle was afflicted by the natural infirmity which prevented him\nfrom pronouncing difficult words in public. It was not exactly\nstuttering, but a strange sort of constitutional hesitation.\n\n\"The writing named Gigans--\" he repeated.\n\nHe, however, could get no further.\n\n\"Giganteo--\"\n\nImpossible! The unfortunate word would not come out. There would have\nbeen great laughter at the Institution, had the mistake happened there.\n\n\"Gigantosteology!\" at last exclaimed Professor Hardwigg between two\nsavage growls.\n\nHaving got over our difficulty, and getting more and more excited--\n\n\"Yes, gentlemen, I am well acquainted with all these matters, and know,\nalso, that Cuvier and Blumenbach fully recognized in these bones the\nundeniable remains of mammoths of the Quaternary period. But after what\nwe now see, to allow a doubt is to insult scientific inquiry. There is\nthe body; you can see it; you can touch it. It is not a skeleton, it is\na complete and uninjured body, preserved with an anthropological\nobject.\"\n\nI did not attempt to controvert this singular and astounding assertion.\n\n\"If I could but wash this corpse in a solution of sulphuric acid,\"\ncontinued my uncle, \"I would undertake to remove all the earthy\nparticles, and these resplendent shells, which are incrusted all over\nthis body. But I am without this precious dissolving medium.\nNevertheless, such as it is, this body will tell its own history.\"\n\nHere the Professor held up the fossil body, and exhibited it with rare\ndexterity. No professional showman could have shown more activity.\n\n\"As on examination you will see,\" my uncle continued, \"it is only about\nsix feet in length, which is a long way from the pretended giants of\nearly days. As to the particular race to which it belonged, it is\nincontestably Caucasian. It is of the white race, that is, of our own.\nThe skull of this fossil being is a perfect ovoid without any remarkable\nor prominent development of the cheekbones, and without any projection\nof the jaw. It presents no indication of the prognathism which modifies\nthe facial angle.[4] Measure the angle for yourselves, and you will find\nthat it is just ninety degrees. But I will advance still farther on the\nroad of inquiry and deduction, and I dare venture to say that this human\nsample or specimen belongs to the Japhetic family, which spread over the\nworld from India to the uttermost limits of western Europe. There is no\noccasion, gentlemen, to smile at my remarks.\"\n\n[4] The facial angle is formed by two planes--one more or less vertical\nwhich is in a straight line with the forehead and the incisors; the\nother, horizontal, which passes through the organs of hearing, and the\nlower nasal bone. Prognathism, in anthropological language, means that\nparticular projection of the jaw which modifies the facial angle.\n\nOf course nobody smiled. But the excellent Professor was so accustomed\nto beaming countenances at his lectures, that he believed he saw all his\naudience laughing during the delivery of his learned dissertation.\n\n\"Yes,\" he continued, with renewed animation, \"this is a fossil man, a\ncontemporary of the mastodons, with the bones of which this whole\namphitheater is covered. But if I am called on to explain how he came to\nthis place, how these various strata by which he is covered have fallen\ninto this vast cavity, I can undertake to give you no explanation.\nDoubtless, if we carry ourselves back to the Quaternary epoch, we shall\nfind that great and mighty convulsions took place in the crust of the\nearth; the continually cooling operation, through which the earth had to\npass, produced fissures, landslips, and chasms, through which a large\nportion of the earth made its way. I come to no absolute conclusion, but\nthere is the man, surrounded by the works of his hands, his hatchets and\nhis carved flints, which belong to the stony period; and the only\nrational supposition is, that, like myself, he visited the centre of the\nearth as a traveling tourist, a pioneer of science. At all events, there\ncan be no doubt of his great age, and of his being one of the oldest\nrace of human beings.\"\n\nThe Professor with these words ceased his oration, and I burst forth\ninto loud and \"unanimous\" applause. Besides, after all, my uncle was\nright. Much more learned men than his nephew would have found it rather\nhard to refute his facts and arguments.\n\nAnother circumstance soon presented itself. This fossilized body was not\nthe only one in this vast plain of bones--the cemetery of an extinct\nworld. Other bodies were found, as we trod the dusty plain, and my uncle\nwas able to choose the most marvelous of these specimens in order to\nconvince the most incredulous.\n\nIn truth, it was a surprising spectacle, the successive remains of\ngenerations and generations of men and animals confounded together in\none vast cemetery. But a great question now presented itself to our\nnotice, and one we were actually afraid to contemplate in all its\nbearings.\n\nHad these once animated beings been buried so far beneath the soil by\nsome tremendous convulsion of nature, after they had been earth to earth\nand ashes to ashes, or had they lived here below, in this subterranean\nworld, under this factitious sky, borne, married, and given in marriage,\nand died at last, just like ordinary inhabitants of the earth?\n\nUp to the present moment, marine monsters, fish, and suchlike animals\nhad alone been seen alive!\n\nThe question which rendered us rather uneasy, was a pertinent one. Were\nany of these men of the abyss wandering about the deserted shores of\nthis wondrous sea of the centre of the earth?\n\nThis was a question which rendered me very uneasy and uncomfortable.\nHow, should they really be in existence, would they receive us men from\nabove?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 36\n\nWHAT IS IT?\n\n\nFor a long and weary hour we tramped over this great bed of bones. We\nadvanced regardless of everything, drawn on by ardent curiosity. What\nother marvels did this great cavern contain--what other wondrous\ntreasures for the scientific man? My eyes were quite prepared for any\nnumber of surprises, my imagination lived in expectation of something\nnew and wonderful.\n\nThe borders of the great Central Ocean had for some time disappeared\nbehind the hills that were scattered over the ground occupied by the\nplain of bones. The imprudent and enthusiastic Professor, who did not\ncare whether he lost himself or not, hurried me forward. We advanced\nsilently, bathed in waves of electric fluid.\n\nBy reason of a phenomenon which I cannot explain, and thanks to its\nextreme diffusion, now complete, the light illumined equally the sides\nof every hill and rock. Its seat appeared to be nowhere, in no\ndetermined force, and produced no shade whatever.\n\nThe appearance presented was that of a tropical country at midday in\nsummer--in the midst of the equatorial regions and under the vertical\nrays of the sun.\n\nAll signs of vapor had disappeared. The rocks, the distant mountains,\nsome confused masses of far-off forests, assumed a weird and mysterious\naspect under this equal distribution of the luminous fluid!\n\nWe resembled, to a certain extent, the mysterious personage in one of\nHoffmann's fantastic tales--the man who lost his shadow.\n\nAfter we had walked about a mile farther, we came to the edge of a vast\nforest not, however, one of the vast mushroom forests we had discovered\nnear Port Gretchen.\n\nIt was the glorious and wild vegetation of the Tertiary period, in all\nits superb magnificence. Huge palms, of a species now unknown, superb\npalmacites--a genus of fossil palms from the coal formation--pines,\nyews, cypress, and conifers or cone-bearing trees, the whole bound\ntogether by an inextricable and complicated mass of creeping plants.\n\nA beautiful carpet of mosses and ferns grew beneath the trees. Pleasant\nbrooks murmured beneath umbrageous boughs, little worthy of this name,\nfor no shade did they give. Upon their borders grew small treelike\nshrubs, such as are seen in the hot countries on our own inhabited\nglobe.\n\nThe one thing wanting in these plants, these shrubs, these trees--was\ncolor! Forever deprived of the vivifying warmth of the sun, they were\nvapid and colorless. All shade was lost in one uniform tint, of a brown\nand faded character. The leaves were wholly devoid of verdure, and the\nflowers, so numerous during the Tertiary period which gave them birth,\nwere without color and without perfume, something like paper discolored\nby long exposure to the atmosphere.\n\nMy uncle ventured beneath the gigantic groves. I followed him, though\nnot without a certain amount of apprehension. Since nature had shown\nherself capable of producing such stupendous vegetable supplies, why\nmight we not meet with mammals just as large, and therefore dangerous?\n\nI particularly remarked, in the clearings left by trees that had fallen\nand been partially consumed by time, many leguminous (beanlike) shrubs,\nsuch as the maple and other eatable trees, dear to ruminating animals.\nThen there appeared confounded together and intermixed, the trees of\nsuch varied lands, specimens of the vegetation of every part of the\nglobe; there was the oak near the palm tree, the Australian eucalyptus,\nan interesting class of the order Myrtaceae--leaning against the tall\nNorwegian pine, the poplar of the north, mixing its branches with those\nof the New Zealand kauris. It was enough to drive the most ingenious\nclassifier of the upper regions out of his mind, and to upset all his\nreceived ideas about botany.\n\nSuddenly I stopped short and restrained my uncle.\n\nThe extreme diffuseness of the light enabled me to see the smallest\nobjects in the distant copses. I thought I saw--no, I really did see\nwith my own eyes--immense, gigantic animals moving about under the\nmighty trees. Yes, they were truly gigantic animals, a whole herd of\nmastodons, not fossils, but living, and exactly like those discovered in\n1801, on the marshy banks of the great Ohio, in North America.\n\nYes, I could see these enormous elephants, whose trunks were tearing\ndown large boughs, and working in and out the trees like a legion of\nserpents. I could hear the sounds of the mighty tusks uprooting huge\ntrees!\n\nThe boughs crackled, and the whole masses of leaves and green branches\nwent down the capacious throats of these terrible monsters!\n\nThat wondrous dream, when I saw the antehistorical times revivified,\nwhen the Tertiary and Quaternary periods passed before me, was now\nrealized!\n\nAnd there we were alone, far down in the bowels of the earth, at the\nmercy of its ferocious inhabitants!\n\nMy uncle paused, full of wonder and astonishment.\n\n\"Come!\" he said at last, when his first surprise was over, \"Come along,\nmy boy, and let us see them nearer.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied I, restraining his efforts to drag me forward, \"we are\nwholly without arms. What should we do in the midst of that flock of\ngigantic quadrupeds? Come away, Uncle, I implore you. No human creature\ncan with impunity brave the ferocious anger of these monsters.\"\n\n\"No human creature,\" said my uncle, suddenly lowering his voice to a\nmysterious whisper, \"you are mistaken, my dear Henry. Look! look yonder!\nIt seems to me that I behold a human being--a being like ourselves--a\nman!\"\n\nI looked, shrugging my shoulders, decided to push incredulity to its\nvery last limits. But whatever might have been my wish, I was compelled\nto yield to the weight of ocular demonstration.\n\nYes--not more than a quarter of a mile off, leaning against the trunk of\nan enormous tree, was a human being--a Proteus of these subterranean\nregions, a new son of Neptune keeping this innumerable herd of\nmastodons.\n\n\n     Immanis pecoris custos, immanior ipse![5]\n\n\n\n[5] The keeper of gigantic cattle, himself still more gigantic!\n\nYes--it was no longer a fossil whose corpse we had raised from the\nground in the great cemetery, but a giant capable of guiding and driving\nthese prodigious monsters. His height was above twelve feet. His head,\nas big as the head of a buffalo, was lost in a mane of matted hair. It\nwas indeed a huge mane, like those which belonged to the elephants of\nthe earlier ages of the world.\n\nIn his hand was a branch of a tree, which served as a crook for this\nantediluvian shepherd.\n\nWe remained profoundly still, speechless with surprise.\n\nBut we might at any moment be seen by him. Nothing remained for us but\ninstant flight.\n\n\"Come, come!\" I cried, dragging my uncle along; and, for the first time,\nhe made no resistance to my wishes.\n\nA quarter of an hour later we were far away from that terrible monster!\n\nNow that I think of the matter calmly, and that I reflect upon it\ndispassionately; now that months, years, have passed since this strange\nand unnatural adventure befell us--what am I to think, what am I to\nbelieve?\n\nNo, it is utterly impossible! Our ears must have deceived us, and our\neyes have cheated us! we have not seen what we believed we had seen. No\nhuman being could by any possibility have existed in that subterranean\nworld! No generation of men could inhabit the lower caverns of the globe\nwithout taking note of those who peopled the surface, without\ncommunication with them. It was folly, folly, folly! nothing else!\n\nI am rather inclined to admit the existence of some animal resembling in\nstructure the human race--of some monkey of the first geological epochs,\nlike that discovered by M. Lartet in the ossiferous deposit of Sansan.\n\nBut this animal, or being, whichsoever it was, surpassed in height all\nthings known to modern science. Never mind. However unlikely it may be,\nit might have been a monkey--but a man, a living man, and with him a\nwhole generation of gigantic animals, buried in the entrails of the\nearth--it was too monstrous to be believed!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 37\n\nTHE MYSTERIOUS DAGGER\n\n\nDuring this time, we had left the bright and transparent forest far\nbehind us. We were mute with astonishment, overcome by a kind of feeling\nwhich was next door to apathy. We kept running in spite of ourselves. It\nwas a perfect Right, which resembled one of those horrible sensations we\nsometimes meet with in our dreams.\n\nInstinctively we made our way towards the Central Sea, and I cannot now\ntell what wild thoughts passed through my mind, nor of what follies I\nmight have been guilty, but for a very serious preoccupation which\nbrought me back to practical life.\n\nThough I was aware that we were treading on a soil quite new to us, I,\nhowever, every now and then noticed certain aggregations of rock, the\nshape of which forcibly reminded me of those near Port Gretchen.\n\nThis confirmed, moreover, the indications of the compass and our\nextraordinary and unlooked-for, as well as involuntary, return to the\nnorth of this great Central Sea. It was so like our starting point, that\nI could scarcely doubt the reality of our position. Streams and cascades\nfell in hundreds over the numerous projections of the rocks.\n\nI actually thought I could see our faithful and monotonous Hans and the\nwonderful grotto in which I had come back to life after my tremendous\nfall.\n\nThen, as we advanced still farther, the position of the cliffs, the\nappearance of a stream, the unexpected profile of a rock, threw me again\ninto a state of bewildering doubt.\n\nAfter some time, I explained my state of mental indecision to my uncle.\nHe confessed to a similar feeling of hesitation. He was totally unable\nto make up his mind in the midst of this extraordinary but uniform\npanorama.\n\n\"There can be no doubt,\" I insisted, \"that we have not landed exactly at\nthe place whence we first took our departure; but the tempest has\nbrought us above our starting point. I think, therefore, that if we\nfollow the coast we shall once more find Port Gretchen.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" cried my uncle, \"it is useless to continue our\nexploration. The very best thing we can do is to make our way back to\nthe raft. Are you quite sure, Harry, that you are not mistaken?\"\n\n\"It is difficult,\" was my reply, \"to come to any decision, for all these\nrocks are exactly alike. There is no marked difference between them. At\nthe same time, the impression on my mind is that I recognize the\npromontory at the foot of which our worthy Hans constructed the raft. We\nare, I am nearly convinced, near the little port: if this be not it,\" I\nadded, carefully examining a creek which appeared singularly familiar to\nmy mind.\n\n\"My dear Harry--if this were the case, we should find traces of our own\nfootsteps, some signs of our passage; and I can really see nothing to\nindicate our having passed this way.\"\n\n\"But I see something,\" I cried, in an impetuous tone of voice, as I\nrushed forward and eagerly picked up something which shone in the sand\nunder my feet.\n\n\"What is it?\" cried the astonished and bewildered Professor.\n\n\"This,\" was my reply.\n\nAnd I handed to my startled relative a rusty dagger, of singular shape.\n\n\"What made you bring with you so useless a weapon?\" he exclaimed. \"It\nwas needlessly hampering yourself.\"\n\n\"I bring it? It is quite new to me. I never saw it before--are you sure\nit is not out of your collection?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of,\" said the Professor, puzzled. \"I have no\nrecollection of the circumstance. It was never my property.\"\n\n\"This is very extraordinary,\" I said, musing over the novel and singular\nincident.\n\n\"Not at all. There is a very simple explanation, Harry. The Icelanders\nare known to keep up the use of these antiquated weapons, and this must\nhave belonged to Hans, who has let it fall without knowing it.\"\n\nI shook my head. That dagger had never been in the possession of the\npacific and taciturn Hans. I knew him and his habits too well.\n\n\"Then what can it be--unless it be the weapon of some antediluvian\nwarrior,\" I continued, \"of some living man, a contemporary of that\nmighty shepherd from whom we have just escaped? But no--mystery upon\nmystery--this is no weapon of the stony epoch, nor even of the bronze\nperiod. It is made of excellent steel--\"\n\nEre I could finish my sentence, my uncle stopped me short from entering\nupon a whole train of theories, and spoke in his most cold and decided\ntone of voice.\n\n\"Calm yourself, my dear boy, and endeavor to use your reason. This\nweapon, upon which we have fallen so unexpectedly, is a true <i>dague</i>,\none of those worn by gentlemen in their belts during the sixteenth\ncentury. Its use was to give the <i>coup de grace</i>, the final blow, to the\nfoe who would not surrender. It is clearly of Spanish workmanship. It\nbelongs neither to you, nor to me, nor the eider-down hunter, nor to any\nof the living beings who may still exist so marvelously in the interior\nof the earth.\"\n\n\"What can you mean, Uncle?\" I said, now lost in a host of surmises.\n\n\"Look closely at it,\" he continued; \"these jagged edges were never made\nby the resistance of human blood and bone. The blade is covered with a\nregular coating of iron mold and rust, which is not a day old, not a\nyear old, not a century old, but much more--\"\n\nThe Professor began to get quite excited, according to custom, and was\nallowing himself to be carried away by his fertile imagination. I could\nhave said something. He stopped me.\n\n\"Harry,\" he cried, \"we are now on the verge of a great discovery. This\nblade of a dagger you have so marvelously discovered, after being\nabandoned upon the sand for more than a hundred, two hundred, even three\nhundred years, has been indented by someone endeavoring to carve an\ninscription on these rocks.\"\n\n\"But this poniard never got here of itself,\" I exclaimed, \"it could not\nhave twisted itself. Someone, therefore, must have preceded us upon the\nshores of this extraordinary sea.\"\n\n\"Yes, a man.\"\n\n\"But what man has been sufficiently desperate to do such a thing?\"\n\n\"A man who has somewhere written his name with this very dagger--a man\nwho has endeavored once more to indicate the right road to the interior\nof the earth. Let us look around, my boy. You know not the importance of\nyour singular and happy discovery.\"\n\nProdigiously interested, we walked along the wall of rock, examining the\nsmallest fissures, which might finally expand into the much wished--for\ngully or shaft.\n\nWe at last reached a spot where the shore became extremely narrow. The\nsea almost bathed the foot of the rocks, which were here very lofty and\nsteep. There was scarcely a path wider than two yards at any point. At\nlast, under a huge over-hanging rock, we discovered the entrance of a\ndark and gloomy tunnel.\n\nThere, on a square tablet of granite, which had been smoothed by rubbing\nit with another stone, we could see two mysterious, and much worn\nletters, the two initials of the bold and extraordinary traveler who had\npreceded us on our adventurous journey.\n\n[Illustration: Runic Glyph]\n\n\"A. S.!\" cried my uncle. \"You see, I was right. Arne Saknussemm, always\nArne Saknussemm!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 38\n\nNO OUTLET--BLASTING THE ROCK\n\n\nEver since the commencement of our marvelous journey, I had experienced\nmany surprises, had suffered from many illusions. I thought that I was\ncase-hardened against all surprises and could neither see nor hear\nanything to amaze me again.\n\nI was like a many who, having been round the world, finds himself wholly\nblase and proof against the marvelous.\n\nWhen, however, I saw these two letters, which had been engraven three\nhundred years before, I stood fixed in an attitude of mute surprise.\n\nNot only was there the signature of the learned and enterprising\nalchemist written in the rock, but I held in my hand the very identical\ninstrument with which he had laboriously engraved it.\n\nIt was impossible, without showing an amount of incredulity scarcely\nbecoming a sane man, to deny the existence of the traveler, and the\nreality of that voyage which I believed all along to have been a\nmyth--the mystification of some fertile brain.\n\nWhile these reflections were passing through my mind, my uncle, the\nProfessor, gave way to an access of feverish and poetical excitement.\n\n\"Wonderful and glorious genius, great Saknussemm,\" he cried, \"you have\nleft no stone unturned, no resource omitted, to show to other mortals\nthe way into the interior of our mighty globe, and your fellow creatures\ncan find the trail left by your illustrious footsteps, three hundred\nyears ago, at the bottom of these obscure subterranean abodes. You have\nbeen careful to secure for others the contemplation of these wonders and\nmarvels of creation. Your name engraved at every important stage of your\nglorious journey leads the hopeful traveler direct to the great and\nmighty discovery to which you devoted such energy and courage. The\naudacious traveler, who shall follow your footsteps to the last, will\ndoubtless find your initials engraved with your own hand upon the centre\nof the earth. I will be that audacious traveler--I, too, will sign my\nname upon the very same spot, upon the central granite stone of this\nwondrous work of the Creator. But in justice to your devotion, to your\ncourage, and to your being the first to indicate the road, let this\ncape, seen by you upon the shores of this sea discovered by you, be\ncalled, of all time, Cape Saknussemm.\"\n\nThis is what I heard, and I began to be roused to the pitch of\nenthusiasm indicated by those words. A fierce excitement roused me. I\nforgot everything. The dangers of the voyage and the perils of the\nreturn journey were now as nothing!\n\nWhat another man had done in ages past could, I felt, be done again; I\nwas determined to do it myself, and now nothing that man had\naccomplished appeared to me impossible.\n\n\"Forward--forward,\" I cried in a burst of genuine and hearty enthusiasm.\n\nI had already started in the direction of the somber and gloomy gallery\nwhen the Professor stopped me; he, the man so rash and hasty, he, the\nman so easily roused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm, checked me, and\nasked me to be patient and show more calm.\n\n\"Let us return to our good friend, Hans,\" he said; \"we will then bring\nthe raft down to this place.\"\n\nI must say that though I at once yielded to my uncle's request, it was\nnot without dissatisfaction, and I hastened along the rocks of that\nwonderful coast.\n\n\"Do you know, my dear uncle,\" I said, as we walked along, \"that we have\nbeen singularly helped by a concurrence of circumstances, right up to\nthis very moment.\"\n\n\"So you begin to see it, do you, Harry?\" said the Professor with a\nsmile.\n\n\"Doubtless,\" I responded, \"and strangely enough, even the tempest has\nbeen the means of putting us on the right road. Blessings on the\ntempest! It brought us safely back to the very spot from which fine\nweather would have driven us forever. Supposing we had succeeded in\nreaching the southern and distant shores of this extraordinary sea, what\nwould have become of us? The name of Saknussemm would never have\nappeared to us, and at this moment we should have been cast away upon an\ninhospitable coast, probably without an outlet.\"\n\n\"Yes, Harry, my boy, there is certainly something providential in that\nwandering at the mercy of wind and waves towards the south: we have come\nback exactly north; and what is better still, we fall upon this great\ndiscovery of Cape Saknussemm. I mean to say, that it is more than\nsurprising; there is something in it which is far beyond my\ncomprehension. The coincidence is unheard of, marvelous!\"\n\n\"What matter! It is not our duty to explain facts, but to make the best\npossible use of them.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, my boy; but if you will allow me--\" said the really\ndelighted Professor.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir, but I see exactly how it will be; we shall take the\nnorthern route; we shall pass under the northern regions of Europe,\nunder Sweden, under Russia, under Siberia, and who knows where--instead\nof burying ourselves under the burning plains and deserts of Africa, or\nbeneath the mighty waves of the ocean; and that is all, at this stage of\nour journey, that I care to know. Let us advance, and Heaven will be our\nguide!\"\n\n\"Yes, Harry, you are right, quite right; all is for the best. Let us\nabandon this horizontal sea, which could never have led to anything\nsatisfactory. We shall descend, descend, and everlastingly descend. Do\nyou know, my dear boy, that to reach the interior of the earth we have\nonly five thousand miles to travel!\"\n\n\"Bah!\" I cried, carried away by a burst of enthusiasm, \"the distance is\nscarcely worth speaking about. The thing is to make a start.\"\n\nMy wild, mad, and incoherent speeches continued until we rejoined our\npatient and phlegmatic guide. All was, we found, prepared for an\nimmediate departure. There was not a single parcel but what was in its\nproper place. We all took up our posts on the raft, and the sail being\nhoisted, Hans received his directions, and guided the frail bark towards\nCape Saknussemm, as we had definitely named it.\n\nThe wind was very unfavorable to a craft that was unable to sail close\nto the wind. It was constructed to go before the blast. We were\ncontinually reduced to pushing ourselves forward by means of poles. On\nseveral occasions the rocks ran far out into deep water and we were\ncompelled to make a long round. At last, after three long and weary\nhours of navigation, that is to say, about six o'clock in the evening,\nwe found a place at which we could land.\n\nI jumped on shore first. In my present state of excitement and\nenthusiasm, I was always first. My uncle and the Icelander followed. The\nvoyage from the port to this point of the sea had by no means calmed me.\nIt had rather produced the opposite effect. I even proposed to burn our\nvessel, that is, to destroy our raft, in order to completely cut off our\nretreat. But my uncle sternly opposed this wild project. I began to\nthink him particularly lukewarm and unenthusiastic.\n\n\"At any rate, my dear uncle,\" I said, \"let us start without delay.\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy, I am quite as eager to do so as you can be. But, in the\nfirst place, let us examine this mysterious gallery, in order to find if\nwe shall need to prepare and mend our ladders.\"\n\nMy uncle now began to see to the efficiency of our Ruhmkorff coil, which\nwould doubtless soon be needed; the raft, securely fastened to a rock,\nwas left alone. Moreover, the opening into the new gallery was not\ntwenty paces distant from the spot. Our little troop, with myself at the\nhead, advanced.\n\nThe orifice, which was almost circular, presented a diameter of about\nfive feet; the somber tunnel was cut in the living rock, and coated on\nthe inside by the different material which had once passed through it in\na state of fusion. The lower part was about level with the water, so\nthat we were able to penetrate to the interior without difficulty.\n\nWe followed an almost horizontal direction; when, at the end of about a\ndozen paces, our further advance was checked by the interposition of an\nenormous block of granite rock.\n\n\"Accursed stone!\" I cried furiously, on perceiving that we were stopped\nby what seemed an insurmountable obstacle.\n\nIn vain we looked to the right, in vain we looked to the left; in vain\nexamined it above and below. There existed no passage, no sign of any\nother tunnel. I experienced the most bitter and painful disappointment.\nSo enraged was I that I would not admit the reality of any obstacle. I\nstooped to my knees; I looked under the mass of stone. No hole, no\ninterstice. I then looked above. The same barrier of granite! Hans, with\nthe lamp, examined the sides of the tunnel in every direction.\n\nBut all in vain! It was necessary to renounce all hope of passing\nthrough.\n\nI had seated myself upon the ground. My uncle walked angrily and\nhopelessly up and down. He was evidently desperate.\n\n\"But,\" I cried, after some moments' thought, \"what about Arne\nSaknussemm?\"\n\n\"You are right,\" replied my uncle, \"he can never have been checked by a\nlump of rock.\"\n\n\"No--ten thousand times no,\" I cried, with extreme vivacity. \"This huge\nlump of rock, in consequence of some singular concussion, or process,\none of those magnetic phenomena which have so often shaken the\nterrestrial crust, has in some unexpected way closed up the passage.\nMany and many years have passed away since the return of Saknussemm, and\nthe fall of this huge block of granite. Is it not quite evident that\nthis gallery was formerly the outlet for the pent-up lava in the\ninterior of the earth, and that these eruptive matters then circulated\nfreely? Look at these recent fissures in the granite roof; it is\nevidently formed of pieces of enormous stone, placed here as if by the\nhand of a giant, who had worked to make a strong and substantial arch.\nOne day, after an unusually strong shock, the vast rock which stands in\nour way, and which was doubtless the key of a kind of arch, fell through\nto a level with the soil and has barred our further progress. We are\nright, then, in thinking that this is an unexpected obstacle, with which\nSaknussemm did not meet; and if we do not upset it in some way, we are\nunworthy of following in the footsteps of the great discoverer; and\nincapable of finding our way to the centre of the earth!\"\n\nIn this wild way I addressed my uncle. The zeal of the Professor, his\nearnest longing for success, had become part and parcel of my being. I\nwholly forgot the past; I utterly despised the future. Nothing existed\nfor me upon the surface of this spheroid in the bosom of which I was\nengulfed, no towns, no country, no Hamburg, no Koenigstrasse, not even\nmy poor Gretchen, who by this time would believe me utterly lost in the\ninterior of the earth!\n\n\"Well,\" cried my uncle, roused to enthusiasm by my words, \"Let us go to\nwork with pickaxes, with crowbars, with anything that comes to hand--but\ndown with these terrible walls.\"\n\n\"It is far too tough and too big to be destroyed by a pickax or\ncrowbar,\" I replied.\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"As I said, it is useless to think of overcoming such a difficulty by\nmeans of ordinary tools.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"What else but gunpowder, a subterranean mine? Let us blow up the\nobstacle that stands in our way.\"\n\n\"Gunpowder!\"\n\n\"Yes; all we have to do is to get rid of this paltry obstacle.\"\n\n\"To work, Hans, to work!\" cried the Professor.\n\nThe Icelander went back to the raft, and soon returned with a huge\ncrowbar, with which he began to dig a hole in the rock, which was to\nserve as a mine. It was by no means a slight task. It was necessary for\nour purpose to make a cavity large enough to hold fifty pounds of\nfulminating gun cotton, the expansive power of which is four times as\ngreat as that of ordinary gunpowder.\n\nI had now roused myself to an almost miraculous state of excitement.\nWhile Hans was at work, I actively assisted my uncle to prepare a long\nwick, made from damp gunpowder, the mass of which we finally enclosed in\na bag of linen.\n\n\"We are bound to go through,\" I cried, enthusiastically.\n\n\"We are bound to go through,\" responded the Professor, tapping me on the\nback.\n\nAt midnight, our work as miners was completely finished; the charge of\nfulminating cotton was thrust into the hollow, and the match, which we\nhad made of considerable length, was ready.\n\nA spark was now sufficient to ignite this formidable engine, and to blow\nthe rock to atoms!\n\n\"We will now rest until tomorrow.\"\n\nIt was absolutely necessary to resign myself to my fate, and to consent\nto wait for the explosion for six weary hours!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 39\n\nTHE EXPLOSION AND ITS RESULTS\n\n\nThe next day, which was the twenty-seventh of August, was a date\ncelebrated in our wondrous subterranean journey. I never think of it\neven now, but I shudder with horror. My heart beats wildly at the very\nmemory of that awful day.\n\nFrom this time forward, our reason, our judgment, our human ingenuity,\nhave nothing to do with the course of events. We are about to become the\nplaything of the great phenomena of the earth!\n\nAt six o'clock we were all up and ready. The dreaded moment was arriving\nwhen we were about to seek an opening into the interior of the earth by\nmeans of gunpowder. What would be the consequences of breaking through\nthe crust of the earth?\n\nI begged that it might be my duty to set fire to the mine. I looked upon\nit as an honor. This task once performed, I could rejoin my friends upon\nthe raft, which had not been unloaded. As soon as we were all ready, we\nwere to sail away to some distance to avoid the consequences of the\nexplosion, the effects of which would certainly not be concentrated in\nthe interior of the earth.\n\nThe slow match we calculated to burn for about ten minutes, more or\nless, before it reached the chamber in which the great body of powder\nwas confined. I should therefore have plenty of time to reach the raft\nand put off to a safe distance.\n\nI prepared to execute my self-allotted task--not, it must be confessed,\nwithout considerable emotion.\n\nAfter a hearty repast, my uncle and the hunter-guide embarked on board\nthe raft, while I remained alone upon the desolate shore.\n\nI was provided with a lantern which was to enable me to set fire to the\nwick of the infernal machine.\n\n\"Go, my boy,\" said my uncle, \"and Heaven be with you. But come back as\nsoon as you can. I shall be all impatience.\"\n\n\"Be easy on that matter,\" I replied, \"there is no fear of my delaying on\nthe road.\"\n\nHaving said this, I advanced toward the opening of the somber gallery.\nMy heart beat wildly. I opened my lantern and seized the extremity of\nthe wick.\n\nThe Professor, who was looking on, held his chronometer in his hand.\n\n\"Are you ready?\" cried he.\n\n\"Quite ready.\"\n\n\"Well, then, fire away!\"\n\nI hastened to put the light to the wick, which crackled and sparkled,\nhissing and spitting like a serpent; then, running as fast as I could, I\nreturned to the shore.\n\n\"Get on board, my lad, and you, Hans, shove off,\" cried my uncle.\n\nBy a vigorous application of his pole Hans sent us flying over the\nwater. The raft was quite twenty fathoms distant.\n\nIt was a moment of palpitating interest, of deep anxiety. My uncle, the\nProfessor, never took his eyes off the chronometer.\n\n\"Only five minutes more,\" he said in a low tone, \"only four, only\nthree.\"\n\nMy pulse went a hundred to the minute. I could hear my heart beating.\n\n\"Only two, one! Now, then, mountains of granite, crumble beneath the\npower of man!\"\n\nWhat happened after that? As to the terrific roar of the explosion, I do\nnot think I heard it. But the form of the rocks completely changed in my\neyes--they seemed to be drawn aside like a curtain. I saw a fathomless,\na bottomless abyss, which yawned beneath the turgid waves. The sea,\nwhich seemed suddenly to have gone mad, then became one great\nmountainous mass, upon the top of which the raft rose perpendicularly.\n\nWe were all thrown down. In less than a second the light gave place to\nthe most profound obscurity. Then I felt all solid support give way not\nto my feet, but to the raft itself. I thought it was going bodily down a\ntremendous well. I tried to speak, to question my uncle. Nothing could\nbe heard but the roaring of the mighty waves. We clung together in utter\nsilence.\n\nDespite the awful darkness, despite the noise, the surprise, the\nemotion, I thoroughly understood what had happened.\n\nBeyond the rock which had been blown up, there existed a mighty abyss.\nThe explosion had caused a kind of earthquake in this soil, broken by\nfissures and rents. The gulf, thus suddenly thrown open, was about to\nswallow the inland sea which, transformed into a mighty torrent, was\ndragging us with it.\n\nOnly one idea filled my mind. We were utterly and completely lost!\n\nOne hour, two hours--what more I cannot say, passed in this manner. We\nsat close together, elbow touching elbow, knee touching knee! We held\none another's hands not to be thrown off the raft. We were subjected to\nthe most violent shocks, whenever our sole dependence, a frail wooden\nraft, struck against the rocky sides of the channel. Fortunately for us,\nthese concussions became less and less frequent, which made me fancy\nthat the gallery was getting wider and wider. There could be now no\ndoubt that we had chanced upon the road once followed by Saknussemm, but\ninstead of going down in a proper manner, we had, through our own\nimprudence, drawn a whole sea with us!\n\nThese ideas presented themselves to my mind in a very vague and obscure\nmanner. I felt rather than reasoned. I put my ideas together only\nconfusedly, while spinning along like a man going down a waterfall. To\njudge by the air which, as it were, whipped my face, we must have been\nrushing at a perfectly lightning rate.\n\nTo attempt under these circumstances to light a torch was simply\nimpossible, and the last remains of our electric machine, of our\nRuhmkorff coil, had been destroyed during the fearful explosion.\n\nI was therefore very much confused to see at last a bright light shining\nclose to me. The calm countenance of the guide seemed to gleam upon me.\nThe clever and patient hunter had succeeded in lighting the lantern; and\nthough, in the keen and thorough draft, the flame flickered and\nvacillated and was nearly put out, it served partially to dissipate the\nawful obscurity.\n\nThe gallery into which we had entered was very wide. I was, therefore,\nquite right in that part of my conjecture. The insufficient light did\nnot allow us to see both of the walls at the same time. The slope of\nwaters, which was carrying us away, was far greater than that of the\nmost rapid river of America. The whole surface of the stream seemed to\nbe composed of liquid arrows, darted forward with extreme violence and\npower. I can give no idea of the impression it made upon me.\n\nThe raft, at times, caught in certain whirlpools, and rushed forward,\nyet turned on itself all the time. How it did not upset I shall never be\nable to understand. When it approached the sides of the gallery, I took\ncare to throw upon them the light of the lantern, and I was able to\njudge of the rapidity of motion by looking at the projecting masses of\nrock, which as soon as seen were again invisible. So rapid was our\nprogress that points of rock at a considerable distance one from the\nother appeared like portions of transverse lines, which enclosed us in a\nkind of net, like that of a line of telegraphic wires.\n\nI believe we were now going at a rate of not less than a hundred miles\nan hour.\n\nMy uncle and I looked at one another with wild and haggard eyes; we\nclung convulsively to the stump of the mast, which, at the moment when\nthe catastrophe took place, had snapped short off. We turned our backs\nas much as possible to the wind, in order not to be stifled by a\nrapidity of motion which nothing human could face and live.\n\nAnd still the long monotonous hours went on. The situation did not\nchange in the least, though a discovery I suddenly made seemed to\ncomplicate it very much.\n\nWhen we had slightly recovered our equilibrium, I proceeded to examine\nour cargo. I then made the unsatisfactory discovery that the greater\npart of it had utterly disappeared.\n\nI became alarmed, and determined to discover what were our resources. My\nheart beat at the idea, but it was absolutely necessary to know on what\nwe had to depend. With this view, I took the lantern and looked around.\n\nOf all our former collection of nautical and philosophical instruments,\nthere remained only the chronometer and the compass. The ladders and\nropes were reduced to a small piece of rope fastened to the stump of the\nmast. Not a pickax, not a crowbar, not a hammer, and, far worse than\nall, no food--not enough for one day!\n\nThis discovery was a prelude to a certain and horrible death.\n\nSeated gloomily on the raft, clasping the stump of the mast\nmechanically, I thought of all I had read as to sufferings from\nstarvation.\n\nI remembered everything that history had taught me on the subject, and I\nshuddered at the remembrance of the agonies to be endured.\n\nMaddened at the prospects of enduring the miseries of starvation, I\npersuaded myself that I must be mistaken. I examined the cracks in the\nraft; I poked between the joints and beams; I examined every possible\nhole and corner. The result was--simply nothing!\n\nOur stock of provisions consisted of nothing but a piece of dry meat and\nsome soaked and half-moldy biscuits.\n\nI gazed around me scared and frightened. I could not understand the\nawful truth. And yet of what consequence was it in regard to any new\ndanger? Supposing that we had had provisions for months, and even for\nyears, how could we ever get out of the awful abyss into which we were\nbeing hurled by the irresistible torrent we had let loose?\n\nWhy should we trouble ourselves about the sufferings and tortures to be\nendured from hunger when death stared us in the face under so many other\nswifter and perhaps even more horrid forms?\n\nIt was very doubtful, under the circumstances in which we were placed,\nif we should have time to die of inanition.\n\nBut the human frame is singularly constituted.\n\nI know not how it was; but, from some singular hallucination of the\nmind, I forgot the real, serious, and immediate danger to which we were\nexposed, to think of the menaces of the future, which appeared before us\nin all their naked terror. Besides, after all, suggested Hope, perhaps\nwe might finally escape the fury of the raging torrent, and once more\nrevisit the glimpses of the moon, on the surface of our beautiful Mother\nEarth.\n\nHow was it to be done? I had not the remotest idea. Where were we to\ncome out? No matter, so that we did.\n\nOne chance in a thousand is always a chance, while death from hunger\ngave us not even the faintest glimpse of hope. It left to the\nimagination nothing but blank horror, without the faintest chance of\nescape!\n\nI had the greatest mind to reveal all to my uncle, to explain to him the\nextraordinary and wretched position to which we were reduced, in order\nthat, between the two, we might make a calculation as to the exact space\nof time which remained for us to live.\n\nIt was, it appeared to me, the only thing to be done. But I had the\ncourage to hold my tongue, to gnaw at my entrails like the Spartan boy.\nI wished to leave him all his coolness.\n\nAt this moment, the light of the lantern slowly fell, and at last went\nout!\n\nThe wick had wholly burnt to an end. The obscurity became absolute. It\nwas no longer possible to see through the impenetrable darkness! There\nwas one torch left, but it was impossible to keep it alight. Then, like\na child, I shut my eyes, that I might not see the darkness.\n\nAfter a great lapse of time, the rapidity of our journey increased. I\ncould feel it by the rush of air upon my face. The slope of the waters\nwas excessive. I began to feel that we were no longer going down a\nslope; we were falling. I felt as one does in a dream, going down\nbodily--falling; falling; falling!\n\nI felt that the hands of my uncle and Hans were vigorously clasping my\narms.\n\nSuddenly, after a lapse of time scarcely appreciable, I felt something\nlike a shock. The raft had not struck a hard body, but had suddenly been\nchecked in its course. A waterspout, a liquid column of water, fell upon\nus. I felt suffocating. I was being drowned.\n\nStill the sudden inundation did not last. In a few seconds I felt myself\nonce more able to breathe. My uncle and Hans pressed my arms, and the\nraft carried us all three away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 40\n\nTHE APE GIGANS\n\n\nIt is difficult for me to determine what was the real time, but I should\nsuppose, by after calculation, that it must have been ten at night.\n\nI lay in a stupor, a half dream, during which I saw visions of\nastounding character. Monsters of the deep were side by side with the\nmighty elephantine shepherd. Gigantic fish and animals seemed to form\nstrange conjunctions.\n\nThe raft took a sudden turn, whirled round, entered another tunnel--this\ntime illumined in a most singular manner. The roof was formed of porous\nstalactite, through which a moonlit vapor appeared to pass, casting its\nbrilliant light upon our gaunt and haggard figures. The light increased\nas we advanced, while the roof ascended; until at last, we were once\nmore in a kind of water cavern, the lofty dome of which disappeared in a\nluminous cloud!\n\nA rugged cavern of small extent appeared to offer a halting place to our\nweary bodies.\n\nMy uncle and the guide moved as men in a dream. I was afraid to waken\nthem, knowing the danger of such a sudden start. I seated myself beside\nthem to watch.\n\nAs I did so, I became aware of something moving in the distance, which\nat once fascinated my eyes. It was floating, apparently, upon the\nsurface of the water, advancing by means of what at first appeared\npaddles. I looked with glaring eyes. One glance told me that it was\nsomething monstrous.\n\nBut what?\n\nIt was the great \"shark-crocodile\" of the early writers on geology.\nAbout the size of an ordinary whale, with hideous jaws and two gigantic\neyes, it advanced. Its eyes fixed on me with terrible sternness. Some\nindefinite warning told me that it had marked me for its own.\n\nI attempted to rise--to escape, no matter where, but my knees shook\nunder me; my limbs trembled violently; I almost lost my senses. And\nstill the mighty monster advanced. My uncle and the guide made no effort\nto save themselves.\n\nWith a strange noise, like none other I had ever heard, the beast came\non. His jaws were at least seven feet apart, and his distended mouth\nlooked large enough to have swallowed a boatful of men.\n\nWe were about ten feet distant when I discovered that much as his body\nresembled that of a crocodile, his mouth was wholly that of a shark.\n\nHis twofold nature now became apparent. To snatch us up at a mouthful it\nwas necessary for him to turn on his back, which motion necessarily\ncaused his legs to kick up helplessly in the air.\n\nI actually laughed even in the very jaws of death!\n\nBut next minute, with a wild cry, I darted away into the interior of the\ncave, leaving my unhappy comrades to their fate! This cavern was deep\nand dreary. After about a hundred yards, I paused and looked around.\n\nThe whole floor, composed of sand and malachite, was strewn with bones,\nfreshly gnawed bones of reptiles and fish, with a mixture of mammalia.\nMy very soul grew sick as my body shuddered with horror. I had truly,\naccording to the old proverb, fallen out of the frying pan into the\nfire. Some beast larger and more ferocious even than the shark-crocodile\ninhabited this den.\n\nWhat could I do? The mouth of the cave was guarded by one ferocious\nmonster, the interior was inhabited by something too hideous to\ncontemplate. Flight was impossible!\n\nOnly one resource remained, and that was to find some small hiding place\nto which the fearful denizens of the cavern could not penetrate. I gazed\nwildly around, and at last discovered a fissure in the rock, to which I\nrushed in the hope of recovering my scattered senses.\n\nCrouching down, I waited shivering as in an ague fit. No man is brave in\npresence of an earthquake, or a bursting boiler, or an exploding\ntorpedo. I could not be expected to feel much courage in presence of the\nfearful fate that appeared to await me.\n\nAn hour passed. I heard all the time a strange rumbling outside the\ncave.\n\nWhat was the fate of my unhappy companions? It was impossible for me to\npause to inquire. My own wretched existence was all I could think of.\n\nSuddenly a groaning, as of fifty bears in a fight, fell upon my\nears--hisses, spitting, moaning, hideous to hear--and then I saw--\n\nNever, were ages to pass over my head, shall I forget the horrible\napparition.\n\nIt was the Ape Gigans!\n\nFourteen feet high, covered with coarse hair, of a blackish brown, the\nhair on the arms, from the shoulder to the elbow joints, pointing\ndownwards, while that from the wrist to the elbow pointed upwards, it\nadvanced. Its arms were as long as its body, while its legs were\nprodigious. It had thick, long, and sharply pointed teeth--like a\nmammoth saw.\n\nIt struck its breast as it came on smelling and sniffing, reminding me\nof the stories we read in our early childhood of giants who ate the\nFlesh of men and little boys!\n\nSuddenly it stopped. My heart beat wildly, for I was conscious that,\nsomehow or other, the fearful monster had smelled me out and was peering\nabout with his hideous eyes to try and discover my whereabouts.\n\nMy reading, which as a rule is a blessing, but which on this occasion,\nseemed momentarily to prove a curse, told me the real truth. It was the\nApe Gigans, the antediluvian gorilla.\n\nYes! This awful monster, confined by good fortune to the interior of the\nearth, was the progenitor of the hideous monster of Africa.\n\nHe glared wildly about, seeking something--doubtless myself. I gave\nmyself up for lost. No hope of safety or escape seemed to remain.\n\nAt this moment, just as my eyes appeared to close in death, there came a\nstrange noise from the entrance of the cave; and turning, the gorilla\nevidently recognized some enemy more worthy his prodigious size and\nstrength. It was the huge shark-crocodile, which perhaps having disposed\nof my friends, was coming in search of further prey.\n\nThe gorilla placed himself on the defensive, and clutching a bone some\nseven or eight feet in length, a perfect club, aimed a deadly blow at\nthe hideous beast, which reared upwards and fell with all its weight\nupon its adversary.\n\nA terrible combat, the details of which it is impossible to give, now\nensued. The struggle was awful and ferocious, I, however, did not wait\nto witness the result. Regarding myself as the object of contention, I\ndetermined to remove from the presence of the victor. I slid down from\nmy hiding place, reached the ground, and gliding against the wall,\nstrove to gain the open mouth of the cavern.\n\nBut I had not taken many steps when the fearful clamor ceased, to be\nfollowed by a mumbling and groaning which appeared to be indicative of\nvictory.\n\nI looked back and saw the huge ape, gory with blood, coming after me\nwith glaring eyes, with dilated nostrils that gave forth two columns of\nheated vapor. I could feel his hot and fetid breath on my neck; and with\na horrid jump--awoke from my nightmare sleep.\n\nYes--it was all a dream. I was still on the raft with my uncle and the\nguide.\n\nThe relief was not instantaneous, for under the influence of the hideous\nnightmare my senses had become numbed. After a while, however, my\nfeelings were tranquilized. The first of my perceptions which returned\nin full force was that of hearing. I listened with acute and attentive\nears. All was still as death. All I comprehended was silence. To the\nroaring of the waters, which had filled the gallery with awful\nreverberations, succeeded perfect peace.\n\nAfter some little time my uncle spoke, in a low and scarcely audible\ntone: \"Harry, boy, where are you?\"\n\n\"I am here,\" was my faint rejoinder.\n\n\"Well, don't you see what has happened? We are going upwards.\"\n\n\"My dear uncle, what can you mean?\" was my half-delirious reply.\n\n\"Yes, I tell you we are ascending rapidly. Our downward journey is quite\nchecked.\"\n\nI held out my hand, and, after some little difficulty, succeeded in\ntouching the wall. My hand was in an instant covered with blood. The\nskin was torn from the flesh. We were ascending with extraordinary\nrapidity.\n\n\"The torch--the torch!\" cried the Professor, wildly; \"it must be\nlighted.\"\n\nHans, the guide, after many vain efforts, at last succeeded in lighting\nit, and the flame, having now nothing to prevent its burning, shed a\ntolerably clear light. We were enabled to form an approximate idea of\nthe truth.\n\n\"It is just as I thought,\" said my uncle, after a moment or two of\nsilent attention. \"We are in a narrow well about four fathoms square.\nThe waters of the great inland sea, having reached the bottom of the\ngulf are now forcing themselves up the mighty shaft. As a natural\nconsequence, we are being cast upon the summit of the waters.\"\n\n\"That I can see,\" was my lugubrious reply; \"but where will this shaft\nend, and to what fall are we likely to be exposed?\"\n\n\"Of that I am as ignorant as yourself. All I know is, that we should be\nprepared for the worst. We are going up at a fearfully rapid rate. As\nfar as I can judge, we are ascending at the rate of two fathoms a\nsecond, of a hundred and twenty fathoms a minute, or rather more than\nthree and a half leagues an hour. At this rate, our fate will soon be a\nmatter of certainty.\"\n\n\"No doubt of it,\" was my reply. \"The great concern I have now, however,\nis to know whether this shaft has any issue. It may end in a granite\nroof--in which case we shall be suffocated by compressed air, or dashed\nto atoms against the top. I fancy, already, that the air is beginning to\nbe close and condensed. I have a difficulty in breathing.\"\n\nThis might be fancy, or it might be the effect of our rapid motion, but\nI certainly felt a great oppression of the chest.\n\n\"Henry,\" said the Professor, \"I do believe that the situation is to a\ncertain extent desperate. There remain, however, many chances of\nultimate safety, and I have, in my own mind, been revolving them over,\nduring your heavy but agitated sleep. I have come to this logical\nconclusion--whereas we may at any moment perish, so at any moment we may\nbe saved! We need, therefore, prepare ourselves for whatever may turn up\nin the great chapter of accidents.\"\n\n\"But what would you have us do?\" I cried. \"Are we not utterly helpless?\"\n\n\"No! While there is life there is hope. At all events, there is one\nthing we can do--eat, and thus obtain strength to face victory or\ndeath.\"\n\nAs he spoke, I looked at my uncle with a haggard glance. I had put off\nthe fatal communication as long as possible. It was now forced upon me,\nand I must tell him the truth.\n\nStill I hesitated.\n\n\"Eat,\" I said, in a deprecating tone as if there were no hurry.\n\n\"Yes, and at once. I feel like a starving prisoner,\" he said, rubbing\nhis yellow and shivering hands together.\n\nAnd, turning round to the guide, he spoke some hearty, cheering words,\nas I judged from his tone, in Danish. Hans shook his head in a terribly\nsignificant manner. I tried to look unconcerned.\n\n\"What!\" cried the Professor, \"you do not mean to say that all our\nprovisions are lost?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" was my lowly spoken reply, as I held out something in my hand,\n\"this morsel of dried meat is all that remains for us three.\"\n\nMy uncle gazed at me as if he could not fully appreciate the meaning of\nmy words. The blow seemed to stun him by its severity. I allowed him to\nreflect for some moments.\n\n\"Well,\" said I, after a short pause, \"what do you think now? Is there\nany chance of our escaping from our horrible subterranean dangers? Are\nwe not doomed to perish in the great hollows of the centre of the\nearth?\"\n\nBut my pertinent questions brought no answer. My uncle either heard me\nnot, or appeared not to do so.\n\nAnd in this way a whole hour passed. Neither of us cared to speak. For\nmyself, I began to feel the most fearful and devouring hunger. My\ncompanions, doubtless, felt the same horrible tortures, but neither of\nthem would touch the wretched morsel of meat that remained. It lay\nthere, a last remnant of all our great preparations for the mad and\nsenseless journey!\n\nI looked back, with wonderment, to my own folly. Fully was I aware that,\ndespite his enthusiasm, and the ever-to-be-hated scroll of Saknussemm,\nmy uncle should never have started on his perilous voyage. What memories\nof the happy past, what previsions of the horrible future, now filled my\nbrain!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 41\n\nHUNGER\n\n\nHunger, prolonged, is temporary madness! The brain is at work without\nits required food, and the most fantastic notions fill the mind.\nHitherto I had never known what hunger really meant. I was likely to\nunderstand it now.\n\nAnd yet, three months before I could tell my terrible story of\nstarvation, as I thought it. As a boy I used to make frequent excursions\nin the neighborhood of the Professor's house.\n\nMy uncle always acted on system, and he believed that, in addition to\nthe day of rest and worship, there should be a day of recreation. In\nconsequence, I was always free to do as I liked on a Wednesday.\n\nNow, as I had a notion to combine the useful and the agreeable, my\nfavorite pastime was birds' nesting. I had one of the best collections\nof eggs in all the town. They were classified, and under glass cases.\n\nThere was a certain wood, which, by rising at early morn, and taking the\ncheap train, I could reach at eleven in the morning. Here I would\nbotanize or geologize at my will. My uncle was always glad of specimens\nfor his herbarium, and stones to examine. When I had filled my wallet, I\nproceeded to search for nests.\n\nAfter about two hours of hard work, I, one day, sat down by a stream to\neat my humble but copious lunch. How the remembrance of the spiced\nsausage, the wheaten loaf, and the beer, made my mouth water now! I\nwould have given every prospect of worldly wealth for such a meal. But\nto my story.\n\nWhile seated thus at my leisure, I looked up at the ruins of an old\ncastle, at no great distance. It was the remains of an historical\ndwelling, ivy-clad, and now falling to pieces.\n\nWhile looking, I saw two eagles circling about the summit of a lofty\ntower. I soon became satisfied that there was a nest. Now, in all my\ncollection, I lacked eggs of the native eagle and the large owl.\n\nMy mind was made up. I would reach the summit of that tower, or perish\nin the attempt. I went nearer, and surveyed the ruins. The old\nstaircase, years before, had fallen in. The outer walls were, however,\nintact. There was no chance that way, unless I looked to the ivy solely\nfor support. This was, as I soon found out, futile.\n\nThere remained the chimney, which still went up to the top, and had once\nserved to carry off the smoke from every story of the tower.\n\nUp this I determined to venture. It was narrow, rough, and therefore the\nmore easily climbed. I took off my coat and crept into the chimney.\nLooking up, I saw a small, light opening, proclaiming the summit of the\nchimney.\n\nUp--up I went, for some time using my hands and knees, after the fashion\nof a chimney sweep. It was slow work, but, there being continual\nprojections, the task was comparatively easy. In this way, I reached\nhalfway. The chimney now became narrower. The atmosphere was close, and,\nat last, to end the matter, I stuck fast. I could ascend no higher.\n\nThere could be no doubt of this, and there remained no resource but to\ndescend, and give up my glorious prey in despair. I yielded to fate and\nendeavored to descend. But I could not move. Some unseen and mysterious\nobstacle intervened and stopped me. In an instant the full horror of my\nsituation seized me.\n\nI was unable to move either way, and was doomed to a terrible and\nhorrible death, that of starvation. In a boy's mind, however, there is\nan extraordinary amount of elasticity and hope, and I began to think of\nall sorts of plans to escape my gloomy fate.\n\nIn the first place, I required no food just at present, having had an\nexcellent meal, and was therefore allowed time for reflection. My first\nthought was to try and move the mortar with my hand. Had I possessed a\nknife, something might have been done, but that useful instrument I had\nleft in my coat pocket.\n\nI soon found that all efforts of this kind were vain and useless, and\nthat all I could hope to do was to wriggle downwards.\n\nBut though I jerked and struggled, and strove to turn, it was all in\nvain. I could not move an inch, one way or the other. And time flew\nrapidly. My early rising probably contributed to the fact that I felt\nsleepy, and gradually gave way to the sensation of drowsiness.\n\nI slept, and awoke in darkness, ravenously hungry.\n\nNight had come, and still I could not move. I was tight bound, and did\nnot succeed in changing my position an inch. I groaned aloud. Never\nsince the days of my happy childhood, when it was a hardship to go from\nmeal to meal without eating, had I really experienced hunger. The\nsensation was as novel as it was painful. I began now to lose my head\nand to scream and cry out in my agony. Something appeared, startled by\nmy noise. It was a harmless lizard, but it appeared to me a loathsome\nreptile. Again I made the old ruins resound with my cries, and finally\nso exhausted myself that I fainted.\n\nHow long I lay in a kind of trance or sleep I cannot say, but when again\nI recovered consciousness it was day. How ill I felt, how hunger still\ngnawed at me, it would be hard to say. I was too weak to scream now, far\ntoo weak to struggle.\n\nSuddenly I was startled by a roar.\n\n\"Are you there, Henry?\" said the voice of my uncle; \"are you there, my\nboy?\"\n\nI could only faintly respond, but I also made a desperate effort to\nturn. Some mortar fell. To this I owed my being discovered. When the\nsearch took place, it was easily seen that mortar and small pieces of\nstone had recently fallen from above. Hence my uncle's cry.\n\n\"Be calm,\" he cried, \"if we pull down the whole ruin, you shall be\nsaved.\"\n\nThey were delicious words, but I had little hope.\n\nSoon however, about a quarter of an hour later I heard a voice above me,\nat one of the upper fireplaces.\n\n\"Are you below or above?\"\n\n\"Below,\" was my reply.\n\nIn an instant a basket was lowered with milk, a biscuit, and an egg. My\nuncle was fearful to be too ready with his supply of food. I drank the\nmilk first, for thirst had nearly deadened hunger. I then, much\nrefreshed, ate my bread and hard egg.\n\nThey were now at work at the wall. I could hear a pickax. Wishing to\nescape all danger from this terrible weapon I made a desperate struggle,\nand the belt, which surrounded my waist and which had been hitched on a\nstone, gave way. I was free, and only escaped falling down by a rapid\nmotion of my hands and knees.\n\nIn ten minutes more I was in my uncle's arms, after being two days and\nnights in that horrible prison. My occasional delirium prevented me from\ncounting time.\n\nI was weeks recovering from that awful starvation adventure; and yet\nwhat was that to the hideous sufferings I now endured?\n\nAfter dreaming for some time, and thinking of this and other matters, I\nonce more looked around me. We were still ascending with fearful\nrapidity. Every now and then the air appeared to check our respiration\nas it does that of aeronauts when the ascension of the balloon is too\nrapid. But if they feel a degree of cold in proportion to the elevation\nthey attain in the atmosphere, we experienced quite a contrary effect.\nThe heat began to increase in a most threatening and exceptional manner.\nI cannot tell exactly the mean, but I think it must have reached one\nhundred twenty-two degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWhat was the meaning of this extraordinary change in the temperature? As\nfar as we had hitherto gone, facts had proved the theories of Davy and\nof Lidenbrock to be correct. Until now, all the peculiar conditions of\nrefractory rocks, of electricity, of magnetism, had modified the general\nlaws of nature, and had created for us a moderate temperature; for the\ntheory of the central fire, remained, in my eyes, the only explainable\none.\n\nWere we, then, going to reach a position in which these phenomena were\nto be carried out in all their rigor, and in which the heat would reduce\nthe rocks to a state of fusion?\n\nSuch was my not unnatural fear, and I did not conceal the fact from my\nuncle. My way of doing so might be cold and heartless, but I could not\nhelp it.\n\n\"If we are not drowned, or smashed into pancakes, and if we do not die\nof starvation, we have the satisfaction of knowing that we must be\nburned alive.\"\n\nMy uncle, in presence of this brusque attack, simply shrugged his\nshoulders, and resumed his reflections--whatever they might be.\n\nAn hour passed away, and except that there was a slight increase in the\ntemperature no incident modified the situation.\n\nMy uncle at last, of his own accord, broke silence.\n\n\"Well, Henry, my boy,\" he said, in a cheerful way, \"we must make up our\nminds.\"\n\n\"Make up our minds to what?\" I asked, in considerable surprise.\n\n\"Well--to something. We must at whatever risk recruit our physical\nstrength. If we make the fatal mistake of husbanding our little remnant\nof food, we may probably prolong our wretched existence a few hours--but\nwe shall remain weak to the end.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I growled, \"to the end. That, however, will not keep us long\nwaiting.\"\n\n\"Well, only let a chance of safety present itself--only allow that a\nmoment of action be necessary--where shall we find the means of action\nif we allow ourselves to be reduced to physical weakness by inanition?\"\n\n\"When this piece of meat is devoured, Uncle, what hope will there remain\nunto us?\"\n\n\"None, my dear Henry, none. But will it do you any good to devour it\nwith your eyes? You appear to me to reason like one without will or\ndecision, like a being without energy.\"\n\n\"Then,\" cried I, exasperated to a degree which is scarcely to be\nexplained, \"you do not mean to tell me--that you--that you--have not\nlost all hope.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" replied the Professor with consummate coolness.\n\n\"You mean to tell me, Uncle, that we shall get out of this monstrous\nsubterranean shaft?\"\n\n\"While there is life there is hope. I beg to assert, Henry, that as long\nas a man's heart beats, as long as a man's flesh quivers, I do not allow\nthat a being gifted with thought and will can allow himself to despair.\"\n\nWhat a nerve! The man placed in a position like that we occupied must\nhave been very brave to speak like this.\n\n\"Well,\" I cried, \"what do you mean to do?\"\n\n\"Eat what remains of the food we have in our hands; let us swallow the\nlast crumb. It will bel Heaven willing, our last repast. Well, never\nmind--instead of being exhausted skeletons, we shall be men.\"\n\n\"True,\" muttered I in a despairing tone, \"let us take our fill.\"\n\n\"We must,\" replied my uncle, with a deep sigh, \"call it what you will.\"\n\nMy uncle took a piece of the meat that remained, and some crusts of\nbiscuit which had escaped the wreck. He divided the whole into three\nparts.\n\nEach had one pound of food to last him as long as he remained in the\ninterior of the earth.\n\nEach now acted in accordance with his own private character.\n\nMy uncle, the Professor, ate greedily, but evidently without appetite,\neating simply from some mechanical motion. I put the food inside my\nlips, and hungry as I was, chewed my morsel without pleasure, and\nwithout satisfaction.\n\nHans, the guide, just as if he had been eider-down hunting, swallowed\nevery mouthful, as though it were a usual affair. He looked like a man\nequally prepared to enjoy superfluity or total want.\n\nHans, in all probability, was no more used to starvation than ourselves,\nbut his hardy Icelandic nature had prepared him for many sufferings. As\nlong as he received his three rix-dollars every Saturday night, he was\nprepared for anything.\n\nThe fact was, Hans never troubled himself about much except his money.\nHe had undertaken to serve a certain man at so much per week, and no\nmatter what evils befell his employer or himself, he never found fault\nor grumbled, so long as his wages were duly paid.\n\nSuddenly my uncle roused himself. He had seen a smile on the face of our\nguide. I could not make it out.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" said my uncle.\n\n\"Schiedam,\" said the guide, producing a bottle of this precious fluid.\n\nWe drank. My uncle and myself will own to our dying day that hence we\nderived strength to exist until the last bitter moment. That precious\nbottle of Hollands was in reality only half full; but, under the\ncircumstances, it was nectar.\n\nIt took some minutes for myself and my uncle to form a decided opinion\non the subject. The worthy Professor swallowed about half a pint and did\nnot seem able to drink any more.\n\n\"<i>Fortrafflig</i>,\" said Hans, swallowing nearly all that was left.\n\n\"Excellent--very good,\" said my uncle, with as much gusto as if he had\njust left the steps of the club at Hamburg.\n\nI had begun to feel as if there had been one gleam of hope. Now all\nthought of the future vanished!\n\nWe had consumed our last ounce of food, and it was five o'clock in the\nmorning!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 42\n\nTHE VOLCANIC SHAFT\n\n\nMan's constitution is so peculiar that his health is purely a negative\nmatter. No sooner is the rage of hunger appeased than it becomes\ndifficult to comprehend the meaning of starvation. It is only when you\nsuffer that you really understand.\n\nAs to anyone who has not endured privation having any notion of the\nmatter, it is simply absurd.\n\nWith us, after a long fast, some mouthfuls of bread and meat, a little\nmoldy biscuit and salt beef triumphed over all our previous gloomy and\nsaturnine thoughts.\n\nNevertheless, after this repast each gave way to his own reflections. I\nwondered what were those of Hans--the man of the extreme north, who was\nyet gifted with the fatalistic resignation of Oriental character. But\nthe utmost stretch of the imagination would not allow me to realize the\ntruth. As for my individual self, my thoughts had ceased to be anything\nbut memories of the past, and were all connected with that upper world\nwhich I never should have left. I saw it all now, the beautiful house in\nthe Konigstrasse, my poor Gretchen, the good Martha; they all passed\nbefore my mind like visions of the past. Every time any of the\nlugubrious groanings which were to be distinguished in the hollows\naround fell upon my ears, I fancied I heard the distant murmur of the\ngreat cities above my head.\n\nAs for my uncle, always thinking of his science, he examined the nature\nof the shaft by means of a torch. He closely examined the different\nstrata one above the other, in order to recognize his situation by\ngeological theory. This calculation, or rather this estimation, could by\nno means be anything but approximate. But a learned man, a philosopher,\nis nothing if not a philosopher, when he keeps his ideas calm and\ncollected; and certainly the Professor possessed this quality to\nperfection.\n\nI heard him, as I sat in silence, murmuring words of geological science.\nAs I understood his object and his meaning, I could not but interest\nmyself despite my preoccupation in that terrible hour.\n\n\"Eruptive granite,\" he said to himself, \"we are still in the primitive\nepoch. But we are going up--going up, still going up. But who knows? Who\nknows?\"\n\nThen he still hoped. He felt along the vertical sides of the shaft with\nhis hand, and some few minutes later, he would go on again in the\nfollowing style:\n\n\"This is gneiss. This is mica schist--siliceous mineral. Good again;\nthis is the epoch of transition, at all events, we are close to\nthem--and then, and then--\"\n\nWhat could the Professor mean? Could he, by any conceivable means,\nmeasure the thickness of the crust of the earth suspended above our\nheads? Did he possess any possible means of making any approximation to\nthis calculation? No.\n\nThe manometer was wanting, and no summary estimation could take the\nplace of it.\n\nAnd yet, as we progressed, the temperature increased in the most\nextraordinary degree, and I began to feel as if I were bathed in a hot\nand burning atmosphere. Never before had I felt anything like it. I\ncould only compare it to the hot vapor from an iron foundry, when the\nliquid iron is in a state of ebullition and runs over. By degrees, and\none after the other, Hans, my uncle, and myself had taken off our coats\nand waistcoats. They were unbearable. Even the slightest garment was not\nonly uncomfortable, but the cause of extreme suffering.\n\n\"Are we ascending to a living fire?\" I cried; when, to my horror and\nastonishment, the heat became greater than before.\n\n\"No, no,\" said my uncle, \"it is simply impossible, quite impossible.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said I, touching the side of the shaft with my naked hand,\n\"this wall is literally burning.\"\n\nAt this moment, feeling as I did that the sides of this extraordinary\nwall were red hot, I plunged my hands into the water to cool them. I\ndrew them back with a cry of despair.\n\n\"The water is boiling!\" I cried.\n\nMy uncle, the Professor, made no reply other than a gesture of rage and\ndespair.\n\nSomething very like the truth had probably struck his imagination.\n\nBut I could take no share in either what was going on, or in his\nspeculations. An invincible dread had taken possession of my brain and\nsoul. I could only look forward to an immediate catastrophe, such a\ncatastrophe as not even the most vivid imagination could have thought\nof. An idea, at first vague and uncertain, was gradually being changed\ninto certainty.\n\nI tremulously rejected it at first, but it forced itself upon me by\ndegrees with extreme obstinacy. It was so terrible an idea that I\nscarcely dared to whisper it to myself.\n\nAnd yet all the while certain, and as it were, involuntary observations\ndetermined my convictions. By the doubtful glare of the torch, I could\nmake out some singular changes in the granitic strata; a strange and\nterrible phenomenon was about to be produced, in which electricity\nplayed a part.\n\nThen this boiling water, this terrible and excessive heat? I determined\nas a last resource to examine the compass.\n\nThe compass had gone mad!\n\nYes, wholly stark staring mad. The needle jumped from pole to pole with\nsudden and surprising jerks, ran round, or as it is said, boxed the\ncompass, and then ran suddenly back again as if it had the vertigo.\n\nI was aware that, according to the best acknowledged theories, it was a\nreceived notion that the mineral crust of the globe is never, and never\nhas been, in a state of complete repose.\n\nIt is perpetually undergoing the modifications caused by the\ndecomposition of internal matter, the agitation consequent on the\nflowing of extensive liquid currents, the excessive action of magnetism\nwhich tends to shake it incessantly, at a time when even the\nmultitudinous beings on its surface do not suspect the seething process\nto be going on.\n\nStill this phenomenon would not have alarmed me alone; it would not have\naroused in my mind a terrible, an awful idea.\n\nBut other facts could not allow my self-delusion to last.\n\nTerrible detonations, like Heaven's artillery, began to multiply\nthemselves with fearful intensity. I could only compare them with the\nnoise made by hundreds of heavily laden chariots being madly driven over\na stone pavement. It was a continuous roll of heavy thunder.\n\nAnd then the mad compass, shaken by the wild electric phenomena,\nconfirmed me in my rapidly formed opinion. The mineral crust was about\nto burst, the heavy granite masses were about to rejoin, the fissure was\nabout to close, the void was about to be filled up, and we poor atoms to\nbe crushed in its awful embrace!\n\n\"Uncle, Uncle!\" I cried, \"we are wholly, irretrievably lost!\"\n\n\"What, then, my young friend, is your new cause of terror and alarm?\" he\nsaid in his calmest manner. \"What fear you now?\"\n\n\"What do I fear now!\" I cried in fierce and angry tones. \"Do you not see\nthat the walls of the shaft are in motion? Do you not see that the solid\ngranite masses are cracking? Do you not feel the terrible, torrid heat?\nDo you not observe the awful boiling water on which we float? Do you not\nremark this mad needle? Every sign and portent of an awful earthquake!\"\n\nMy uncle coolly shook his head.\n\n\"An earthquake,\" he replied in the most calm and provoking tone.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"My nephew, I tell you that you are utterly mistaken,\" he continued.\n\n\"Do you not, can you not, recognize all the well-known symtons--\"\n\n\"Of an earthquake? By no means. I am expecting something far more\nimportant.\"\n\n\"My brain is strained beyond endurance--what, what do you mean?\" I\ncried.\n\n\"An eruption, Harry.\"\n\n\"An eruption,\" I gasped. \"We are, then, in the volcanic shaft of a\ncrater in full action and vigor.\"\n\n\"I have every reason to think so,\" said the Professor in a smiling tone,\n\"and I beg to tell you that it is the most fortunate thing that could\nhappen to us.\"\n\nThe most fortunate thing! Had my uncle really and truly gone mad? What\ndid he mean by these awful words--what did he mean by this terrible\ncalm, this solemn smile?\n\n\"What!\" cried I, in the height of my exasperation, \"we are on the way to\nan eruption, are we? Fatality has cast us into a well of burning and\nboiling lava, of rocks on fire, of boiling water, in a word, filled with\nevery kind of eruptive matter? We are about to be expelled, thrown up,\nvomited, spit out of the interior of the earth, in common with huge\nblocks of granite, with showers of cinders and scoriae, in a wild\nwhirlwind of flame, and you say--the most fortunate thing which could\nhappen to us.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Professor, looking at me calmly from under his\nspectacles, \"it is the only chance which remains to us of ever escaping\nfrom the interior of the earth to the light of day.\"\n\nIt is quite impossible that I can put on paper the thousand strange,\nwild thoughts which followed this extraordinary announcement.\n\nBut my uncle was right, quite right, and never had he appeared to me so\naudacious and so convinced as when he looked me calmly in the face and\nspoke of the chances of an eruption--of our being cast upon Mother Earth\nonce more through the gaping crater of a volcano!\n\nNevertheless, while we were speaking we were still ascending; we passed\nthe whole night going up, or to speak more scientifically, in an\nascensional motion. The fearful noise redoubled; I was ready to\nsuffocate. I seriously believed that my last hour was approaching, and\nyet, so strange is imagination, all I thought of was some childish\nhypothesis or other. In such circumstances you do not choose your own\nthoughts. They overcome you.\n\nIt was quite evident that we were being cast upwards by eruptive matter;\nunder the raft there was a mass of boiling water, and under this was a\nheavier mass of lava, and an aggregate of rocks which, on reaching the\nsummit of the water, would be dispersed in every direction.\n\nThat we were inside the chimney of a volcano there could no longer be\nthe shadow of a doubt. Nothing more terrible could be conceived!\n\nBut on this occasion, instead of Sneffels, an old and extinct volcano,\nwe were inside a mountain of fire in full activity. Several times I\nfound myself asking, what mountain was it, and on what part of the world\nwe should be shot out. As if it were of any consequence!\n\nIn the northern regions, there could be no reasonable doubt about that.\nBefore it went decidedly mad, the compass had never made the slightest\nmistake. From the cape of Saknussemm, we had been swept away to the\nnorthward many hundreds of leagues. Now the question was, were we once\nmore under Iceland--should we be belched forth on to the earth through\nthe crater of Mount Hecla, or should we reappear through one of the\nother seven fire funnels of the island? Taking in my mental vision a\nradius of five hundred leagues to the westward, I could see under this\nparallel only the little-known volcanoes of the northwest coast of\nAmerica.\n\nTo the east one only existed somewhere about the eightieth degree of\nlatitude, the Esk, upon the island of Jan Mayen, not far from the frozen\nregions of Spitsbergen.\n\nIt was not craters that were wanting, and many of them were big enough\nto vomit a whole army; all I wished to know was the particular one\ntowards which we were making with such fearful velocity.\n\nI often think now of my folly: as if I should ever have expected to\nescape!\n\nTowards morning, the ascending motion became greater and greater. If the\ndegree of heat increased instead of decreasing, as we approached the\nsurface of the earth, it was simply because the causes were local and\nwholly due to volcanic influence. Our very style of locomotion left in\nmy mind no doubt upon the subject. An enormous force, a force of several\nhundreds of atmospheres produced by the vapors accumulated and long\ncompressed in the interior of the earth, was hoisting us upwards with\nirresistible power.\n\nBut though we were approaching the light of day, to what fearful dangers\nwere we about to be exposed?\n\nInstant death appeared the only fate which we could expect or\ncontemplate.\n\nSoon a dim, sepulchral light penetrated the vertical gallery, which\nbecame wider and wider. I could make out to the right and left long dark\ncorridors like immense tunnels, from which awful and horrid vapors\npoured out. Tongues of fire, sparkling and crackling, appeared about to\nlick us up.\n\nThe hour had come!\n\n\"Look, Uncle, look!\" I cried.\n\n\"Well, what you see are the great sulphurous flames. Nothing more common\nin connection with an eruption.\"\n\n\"But if they lap us round!\" I angrily replied.\n\n\"They will not lap us round,\" was his quiet and serene answer.\n\n\"But it will be all the same in the end if they stifle us,\" I cried.\n\n\"We shall not be stifled. The gallery is rapidly becoming wider and\nwider, and if it be necessary, we will presently leave the raft and take\nrefuge in some fissure in the rock.\"\n\n\"But the water, the water, which is continually ascending?\" I\ndespairingly replied.\n\n\"There is no longer any water, Harry,\" he answered, \"but a kind of lava\npaste, which is heaving us up, in company with itself, to the mouth of\nthe crater.\"\n\nIn truth, the liquid column of water had wholly disappeared to give\nplace to dense masses of boiling eruptive matter. The temperature was\nbecoming utterly insupportable, and a thermometer exposed to this\natmosphere would have marked between one hundred and eighty-nine and one\nhundred ninety degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nPerspiration rushed from every pore. But for the extraordinary rapidity\nof our ascent we should have been stifled.\n\nNevertheless, the Professor did not carry out his proposition of\nabandoning the raft; and he did quite wisely. Those few ill-joined beams\noffered, anyway, a solid surface--a support which elsewhere must have\nutterly failed us.\n\nTowards eight o'clock in the morning a new incident startled us. The\nascensional movement suddenly ceased. The raft became still and\nmotionless.\n\n\"What is the matter now?\" I said, querulously, very much startled by\nthis change.\n\n\"A simple halt,\" replied my uncle.\n\n\"Is the eruption about to fail?\" I asked.\n\n\"I hope not.\"\n\nWithout making any reply, I rose. I tried to look around me. Perhaps the\nraft, checked by some projecting rock, opposed a momentary resistance to\nthe eruptive mass. In this case, it was absolutely necessary to release\nit as quickly as possible.\n\nNothing of the kind had occurred. The column of cinders, of scoriae, of\nbroken rocks and earth, had wholly ceased to ascend.\n\n\"I tell you, Uncle, that the eruption has stopped,\" was my oracular\ndecision.\n\n\"Ah,\" said my uncle, \"you think so, my boy. You are wrong. Do not be in\nthe least alarmed; this sudden moment of calm will not last long, be\nassured. It has already endured five minutes, and before we are many\nminutes older we shall be continuing our journey to the mouth of the\ncrater.\"\n\nAll the time he was speaking the Professor continued to consult his\nchronometer, and he was probably right in his prognostics. Soon the raft\nresumed its motion, in a very rapid and disorderly way, which lasted two\nminutes or thereabout; and then again it stopped as suddenly as before.\n\n\"Good,\" said my uncle, observing the hour, \"in ten we shall start\nagain.\"\n\n\"In ten minutes?\"\n\n\"Yes--precisely. We have to do with a volcano, the eruption of which is\nintermittent. We are compelled to breathe just as it does.\"\n\nNothing could be more true. At the exact minute he had indicated, we\nwere again launched on high with extreme rapidity. Not to be cast off\nthe raft, it was necessary to hold on to the beams. Then the hoist again\nceased.\n\nMany times since have I thought of this singular phenomenon without\nbeing able to find for it any satisfactory explanation. Nevertheless, it\nappeared quite clear to me, that we were not in the principal chimney of\nthe volcano, but in an accessory conduit, where we felt the counter\nshock of the great and principal tunnel filled by burning lava.\n\nIt is impossible for me to say how many times this maneuver was\nrepeated. All that I can remember is, that on every ascensional motion,\nwe were hoisted up with ever increasing velocity, as if we had been\nlaunched from a huge projectile. During the sudden halts we were nearly\nstifled; during the moments of projection the hot air took away our\nbreath.\n\nI thought for a moment of the voluptuous joy of suddenly finding myself\nin the hyperborean regions with the cold thirty degrees below zero!\n\nMy exalted imagination pictured to itself the vast snowy plains of the\narctic regions, and I was impatient to roll myself on the icy carpet of\nthe North Pole.\n\nBy degrees my head, utterly overcome by a series of violent emotions,\nbegan to give way to hallucination. I was delirious. Had it not been for\nthe powerful arms of Hans, the guide, I should have broken my head\nagainst the granite masses of the shaft.\n\nI have, in consequence, kept no account of what followed for many hours.\nI have a vague and confused remembrance of continual detonations, of the\nshaking of the huge granitic mass, and of the raft going round like a\nspinning top. It floated on the stream of hot lava, amidst a falling\ncloud of cinders. The huge flames roaring, wrapped us around.\n\nA storm of wind which appeared to be cast forth from an immense\nventilator roused up the interior fires of the earth. It was a hot,\nincandescent blast!\n\nAt last I saw the figure of Hans as if enveloped in the huge halo of\nburning blaze, and no other sense remained to me but that sinister dread\nwhich the condemned victim may be supposed to feel when led to the mouth\nof a cannon, at the supreme moment when the shot is fired and his limbs\nare dispersed into empty space.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 43\n\nDAYLIGHT AT LAST\n\n\nWhen I opened my eyes I felt the hand of the guide clutching me firmly\nby the belt. With his other hand he supported my uncle. I was not\ngrievously wounded, but bruised all over in the most remarkable manner.\n\nAfter a moment I looked around, and found that I was lying down on the\nslope of a mountain not two yards from a yawning gulf into which I\nshould have fallen had I made the slightest false step. Hans had saved\nme from death, while I rolled insensible on the flanks of the crater.\n\n\"Where are we?\" dreamily asked my uncle, who literally appeared to be\ndisgusted at having returned to earth.\n\nThe eider-down hunter simply shrugged his shoulders as a mark of total\nignorance.\n\n\"In Iceland?\" said I, not positively but interrogatively.\n\n\"Nej,\" said Hans.\n\n\"How do you mean?\" cried the Professor; \"no--what are your reasons?\"\n\n\"Hans is wrong,\" said I, rising.\n\nAfter all the innumerable surprises of this journey, a yet more singular\none was reserved to us. I expected to see a cone covered by snow, by\nextensive and widespread glaciers, in the midst of the arid deserts of\nthe extreme northern regions, beneath the full rays of a polar sky,\nbeyond the highest latitudes.\n\nBut contrary to all our expectations, I, my uncle, and the Icelander,\nwere cast upon the slope of a mountain calcined by the burning rays of a\nsun which was literally baking us with its fires.\n\nI could not believe my eyes, but the actual heat which affected my body\nallowed me no chance of doubting. We came out of the crater half naked,\nand the radiant star from which we had asked nothing for two months, was\ngood enough to be prodigal to us of light and warmth--a light and warmth\nwe could easily have dispensed with.\n\nWhen our eyes were accustomed to the light we had lost sight of so long,\nI used them to rectify the errors of my imagination. Whatever happened,\nwe should have been at Spitsbergen, and I was in no humor to yield to\nanything but the most absolute proof.\n\nAfter some delay, the Professor spoke.\n\n\"Hem!\" he said, in a hesitating kind of way, \"it really does not look\nlike Iceland.\"\n\n\"But supposing it were the island of Jan Mayen?\" I ventured to observe.\n\n\"Not in the least, my boy. This is not one of the volcanoes of the\nnorth, with its hills of granite and its crown of snow.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless--\"\n\n\"Look, look, my boy,\" said the Professor, as dogmatically as usual.\n\nRight above our heads, at a great height, opened the crater of a volcano\nfrom which escaped, from one quarter of an hour to the other, with a\nvery loud explosion, a lofty jet of flame mingled with pumice stone,\ncinders, and lava. I could feel the convulsions of nature in the\nmountain, which breathed like a huge whale, throwing up from time to\ntime fire and air through its enormous vents.\n\nBelow, and floating along a slope of considerable angularity, the stream\nof eruptive matter spread away to a depth which did not give the volcano\na height of three hundred fathoms.\n\nIts base disappeared in a perfect forest of green trees, among which I\nperceived olives, fig trees, and vines loaded with rich grapes.\n\nCertainly this was not the ordinary aspect of the arctic regions. About\nthat there could not be the slightest doubt.\n\nWhen the eye was satisfied at its glimpse of this verdant expanse, it\nfell upon the waters of a lovely sea or beautiful lake, which made of\nthis enchanted land an island of not many leagues in extent.\n\nOn the side of the rising sun was to be seen a little port, crowded with\nhouses, and near which the boats and vessels of peculiar build were\nfloating upon azure waves.\n\nBeyond, groups of islands rose above the liquid plain, so numerous and\nclose together as to resemble a vast beehive.\n\nTowards the setting sun, some distant shores were to be made out on the\nedge of the horizon. Some presented the appearance of blue mountains of\nharmonious conformation; upon others, much more distant, there appeared\na prodigiously lofty cone, above the summit of which hung dark and heavy\nclouds.\n\nTowards the north, an immense expanse of water sparkled beneath the\nsolar rays, occasionally allowing the extremity of a mast or the\nconvexity of a sail bellying to the wind, to be seen.\n\nThe unexpected character of such a scene added a hundredfold to its\nmarvelous beauties.\n\n\"Where can we be?\" I asked, speaking in a low and solemn voice.\n\nHans shut his eyes with an air of indifference, and my uncle looked on\nwithout clearly understanding.\n\n\"Whatever this mountain may be,\" he said, at last, \"I must confess it is\nrather warm. The explosions do not leave off, and I do not think it is\nworthwhile to have left the interior of a volcano and remain here to\nreceive a huge piece of rock upon one's head. Let us carefully descend\nthe mountain and discover the real state of the case. To confess the\ntruth, I am dying of hunger and thirst.\"\n\nDecidedly the Professor was no longer a truly reflective character. For\nmyself, forgetting all my necessities, ignoring my fatigues and\nsufferings, I should have remained still for several hours longer--but\nit was necessary to follow my companions.\n\nThe slope of the volcano was very steep and slippery; we slid over piles\nof ashes, avoiding the streams of hot lava which glided about like fiery\nserpents. Still, while we were advancing, I spoke with extreme\nvolubility, for my imagination was too full not to explode in words.\n\n\"We are in Asia!\" I exclaimed; \"we are on the coast of India, in the\ngreat Malay islands, in the centre of Oceania. We have crossed the one\nhalf of the globe to come out right at the antipodes of Europe!\"\n\n\"But the compass!\" exclaimed my uncle; \"explain that to me!\"\n\n\"Yes--the compass,\" I said with considerable hesitation. \"I grant that\nis a difficulty. According to it, we have always been going northward.\"\n\n\"Then it lied.\"\n\n\"Hem--to say it lied is rather a harsh word,\" was my answer.\n\n\"Then we are at the North Pole--\"\n\n\"The Pole--no--well--well I give it up,\" was my reply.\n\nThe plain truth was, that there was no explanation possible. I could\nmake nothing of it.\n\nAnd all the while we were approaching this beautiful verdure, hunger and\nthirst tormented me fearfully. Happily, after two long hours' march, a\nbeautiful country spread out before us, covered by olives, pomegranates,\nand vines, which appeared to belong to anybody and everybody. In any\nevent, in the state of destitution into which we had fallen, we were not\nin a mood to ponder too scrupulously.\n\nWhat delight it was to press these delicious fruits to our lips, and to\nbite at grapes and pomegranates fresh from the vine.\n\nNot far off, near some fresh and mossy grass, under the delicious shade\nof some trees, I discovered a spring of fresh water, in which we\nvoluptuously laved our faces, hands, and feet.\n\nWhile we were all giving way to the delights of new-found pleasures, a\nlittle child appeared between two tufted olive trees.\n\n\"Ah,\" cried I, \"an inhabitant of this happy country.\"\n\nThe little fellow was poorly dressed, weak, and suffering, and appeared\nterribly alarmed at our appearance. Half-naked, with tangled, matted and\nragged beards, we did look supremely ill-favored; and unless the country\nwas a bandit land, we were not likely to alarm the inhabitants!\n\nJust as the boy was about to take to his heels, Hans ran after him, and\nbrought him back, despite his cries and kicks.\n\nMy uncle tried to look as gentle as possible, and then spoke in German.\n\n\"What is the name of this mountain, my friend?\"\n\nThe child made no reply.\n\n\"Good,\" said my uncle, with a very positive air of conviction, \"we are\nnot in Germany.\"\n\nHe then made the same demand in English, of which language he was an\nexcellent scholar.\n\nThe child shook its head and made no reply. I began to be considerably\npuzzled.\n\n\"Is he dumb?\" cried the Professor, who was rather proud of his polyglot\nknowledge of languages, and made the same demand in French.\n\nThe boy only stared in his face.\n\n\"I must perforce try him in Italian,\" said my uncle, with a shrug.\n\n\"<i>Dove noi siamo</i>?\"\n\n\"Yes, tell me where we are?\" I added impatiently and eagerly.\n\nAgain the boy remained silent.\n\n\"My fine fellow, do you or do you not mean to speak?\" cried my uncle,\nwho began to get angry. He shook him, and spoke another dialect of the\nItalian language.\n\n\"<i>Come si noma questa isola</i>?\"--\"What is the name of this island?\"\n\n\"Stromboli,\" replied the rickety little shepherd, dashing away from Hans\nand disappearing in the olive groves.\n\nWe thought little enough about him.\n\nStromboli! What effect on the imagination did these few words produce!\nWe were in the centre of the Mediterranean, amidst the eastern\narchipelago of mythological memory, in the ancient Strongylos, where\nAEolus kept the wind and the tempest chained up. And those blue\nmountains, which rose towards the rising sun, were the mountains of\nCalabria.\n\nAnd that mighty volcano which rose on the southern horizon was Etna, the\nfierce and celebrated Etna!\n\n\"Stromboli! Stromboli!\" I repeated to myself.\n\nMy uncle played a regular accompaniment to my gestures and words. We\nwere singing together like an ancient chorus.\n\nAh--what a journey--what a marvelous and extraordinary journey! Here we\nhad entered the earth by one volcano, and we had come out by another.\nAnd this other was situated more than twelve hundred leagues from\nSneffels from that drear country of Iceland cast away on the confines of\nthe earth. The wondrous changes of this expedition had transported us to\nthe most harmonious and beautiful of earthly lands. We had abandoned the\nregion of eternal snows for that of infinite verdure, and had left over\nour heads the gray fog of the icy regions to come back to the azure sky\nof Sicily!\n\nAfter a delicious repast of fruits and fresh water, we again continued\nour journey in order to reach the port of Stromboli. To say how we had\nreached the island would scarcely have been prudent. The superstitious\ncharacter of the Italians would have been at work, and we should have\nbeen called demons vomited from the infernal regions. It was therefore\nnecessary to pass for humble and unfortunate shipwrecked travelers. It\nwas certainly less striking and romantic, but it was decidedly safer.\n\nAs we advanced, I could hear my worthy uncle muttering to himself:\n\n\"But the compass. The compass most certainly marked north. This is a\nfact I cannot explain in any way.\"\n\n\"Well, the fact is,\" said I, with an air of disdain, \"we must not\nexplain anything. It will be much more easy.\"\n\n\"I should like to see a professor of the Johanneum Institution who is\nunable to explain a cosmic phenomenon--it would indeed be strange.\"\n\nAnd speaking thus, my uncle, half-naked, his leathern purse round his\nloins, and his spectacles upon his nose, became once more the terrible\nProfessor of Mineralogy.\n\nAn hour after leaving the wood of olives, we reached the fort of San\nVicenza, where Hans demanded the price of his thirteenth week of\nservice. My uncle paid him, with very many warm shakes of the hand.\n\nAt that moment, if he did not indeed quite share our natural emotion, he\nallowed his feelings so far to give way as to indulge in an\nextraordinary expression for him.\n\nWith the tips of two fingers he gently pressed our hands and smiled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 44\n\nTHE JOURNEY ENDED\n\n\nThis is the final conclusion of a narrative which will be probably\ndisbelieved even by people who are astonished at nothing. I am, however,\narmed at all points against human incredulity.\n\nWe were kindly received by the Strombolite fishermen, who treated us as\nshipwrecked travelers. They gave us clothes and food. After a delay of\nforty-eight hours, on the 30th of September a little vessel took us to\nMessina, where a few days of delightful and complete repose restored us\nto ourselves.\n\nOn Friday, the 4th of October, we embarked in the Volturne, one of the\npostal packets of the Imperial Messageries of France; and three days\nlater we landed at Marseilles, having no other care on our minds but\nthat of our precious but erratic compass. This inexplicable circumstance\ntormented me terribly. On the 9th of October, in the evening, we reached\nHamburg.\n\nWhat was the astonishment of Martha, what the joy of Gretchen! I will\nnot attempt to define it.\n\n\"Now then, Harry, that you really are a hero,\" she said, \"there is no\nreason why you should ever leave me again.\"\n\nI looked at her. She was weeping tears of joy.\n\nI leave it to be imagined if the return of Professor Hardwigg made or\ndid not make a sensation in Hamburg. Thanks to the indiscretion of\nMartha, the news of his departure for the interior of the earth had been\nspread over the whole world.\n\nNo one would believe it--and when they saw him come back in safety they\nbelieved it all the less.\n\nBut the presence of Hans and many stray scraps of information by degrees\nmodified public opinion.\n\nThen my uncle became a great man and I the nephew of a great man, which,\nat all events, is something. Hamburg gave a festival in our honor. A\npublic meeting of the Johanneum Institution was held, at which the\nProfessor related the whole story of his adventures, omitting only the\nfacts in connection with the compass.\n\nThat same day he deposited in the archives of the town the document he\nhad found written by Saknussemm, and he expressed his great regret that\ncircumstances, stronger than his will, did not allow him to follow the\nIcelandic traveler's track into the very centre of the earth. He was\nmodest in his glory, but his reputation only increased.\n\nSo much honor necessarily created for him many envious enemies. Of\ncourse they existed, and as his theories, supported by certain facts,\ncontradicted the system of science upon the question of central heat, he\nmaintained his own views both with pen and speech against the learned of\nevery country. Although I still believe in the theory of central heat, I\nconfess that certain circumstances, hitherto very ill defined, may\nmodify the laws of such natural phenomena.\n\nAt the moment when these questions were being discussed with interest,\nmy uncle received a rude shock--one that he felt very much. Hans,\ndespite everything he could say to the contrary, quitted Hamburg; the\nman to whom we owed so much would not allow us to pay our deep debt of\ngratitude. He was taken with nostalgia; a love for his Icelandic home.\n\n\"Farval,\" said he, one day, and with this one short word of adieu, he\nstarted for Reykjavik, which he soon reached in safety.\n\nWe were deeply attached to our brave eider-duck hunter. His absence will\nnever cause him to be forgotten by those whose lives he saved, and I\nhope, at some not distant day, to see him again.\n\nTo conclude, I may say that our journey into the interior of the earth\ncreated an enormous sensation throughout the civilized world. It was\ntranslated and printed in many languages. All the leading journals\npublished extracts from it, which were commentated, discussed, attacked,\nand supported with equal animation by those who believed in its\nepisodes, and by those who were utterly incredulous.\n\nWonderful! My uncle enjoyed during his lifetime all the glory he\ndeserved; and he was even offered a large sum of money, by Mr. Barnum,\nto exhibit himself in the United States; while I am credibly informed by\na traveler that he is to be seen in waxwork at Madame Tussaud's!\n\nBut one care preyed upon his mind, a care which rendered him very\nunhappy. One fact remained inexplicable--that of the compass. For a\nlearned man to be baffled by such an inexplicable phenomenon was very\naggravating. But Heaven was merciful, and in the end my uncle was happy.\n\nOne day, while he put some minerals belonging to his collection in\norder, I fell upon the famous compass and examined it keenly.\n\nFor six months it had lain unnoticed and untouched.\n\nI looked at it with curiosity, which soon became surprise. I gave a loud\ncry. The Professor, who was at hand, soon joined me.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he cried.\n\n\"The compass!\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Why its needle points to the south and not to the north.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, you must be dreaming.\"\n\n\"I am not dreaming. See--the poles are changed.\"\n\n\"Changed!\"\n\nMy uncle put on his spectacles, examined the instrument, and leaped with\njoy, shaking the whole house.\n\nA clear light fell upon our minds.\n\n\"Here it is!\" he cried, as soon as he had recovered the use of his\nspeech, \"after we had once passed Cape Saknussemm, the needle of this\ncompass pointed to the southward instead of the northward.\"\n\n\"Evidently.\"\n\n\"Our error is now easily explained. But to what phenomenon do we owe\nthis alteration in the needle?\"\n\n\"Nothing more simple.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself, my boy. I am on thorns.\"\n\n\"During the storm, upon the Central Sea, the ball of fire which made a\nmagnet of the iron in our raft, turned our compass topsy-turvy.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" cried the Professor, with a loud and ringing laugh, \"it was a\ntrick of that inexplicable electricity.\"\n\nFrom that hour my uncle was the happiest of learned men, and I the\nhappiest of ordinary mortals. For my pretty Virland girl, abdicating her\nposition as ward, took her place in the house in the Konigstrasse in the\ndouble quality of niece and wife.\n\nWe need scarcely mention that her uncle was the illustrious Professor\nHardwigg, corresponding member of all the scientific, geographical,\nmineralogical, and geological societies of the five parts of the globe.\n\n\n\nEnd of the Voyage Extraordinaire", "title": "Voyage au centre de la terre.

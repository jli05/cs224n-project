{"summary": "\nAllan Quatermain, an adventurer and white hunter based in Durban, in what is now South Africa, is approached by aristocrat Sir Henry Curtis and his friend Captain Good, seeking his help finding Sir Henry's brother, who was last seen travelling north into the unexplored interior on a quest for the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Quatermain has a mysterious map purporting to lead to the mines, but had never taken it seriously. However, he agrees to lead an expedition in return for a share of the treasure, or a stipend for his son if he is killed along the way. He has little hope they will return alive, but reasons that he has already outlived most people in his profession, so dying in this manner at least ensures that his son will be provided for. They also take along a mysterious native, Umbopa, who seems more regal, handsome and well-spoken than most porters of his class, but who is very anxious to join the party.\nTravelling by oxcart, they reach the edge of a desert, but not before a hunt in which a wounded elephant claims the life of a servant. They continue on foot across the desert, almost dying of thirst before finding the oasis shown halfway across on the map. Reaching a mountain range called Suliman Berg, they climb a peak (one of \"Sheba's Breasts\") and enter a cave where they find the frozen corpse of José Silvestre (also spelt Silvestra), the 16th-century Portuguese explorer who drew the map in his own blood. That night, a second servant dies from the cold, so they leave his body next to Silvestra's, to \"give him a companion\". They cross the mountains into a raised valley, lush and green, known as Kukuanaland. The inhabitants have a well-organised army and society and speak an ancient dialect of IsiZulu. Kukuanaland's capital is Loo, the destination of a magnificent road from ancient times. The city is dominated by a central royal kraal.\nThey soon meet a party of Kukuana warriors who are about to kill them when Captain Good nervously fidgets with his false teeth, making the Kukuanas recoil in fear. Thereafter, to protect themselves, they style themselves \"white men from the stars\"—sorcerer-gods—and are required to give regular proof of their divinity, considerably straining both their nerves and their ingenuity.\nThey are brought before King Twala, who rules over his people with ruthless violence. He came to power years before when he murdered his brother, the previous king, and drove his brother's wife and infant son, Ignosi, out into the desert to die. Twala's rule is unchallenged. An evil, impossibly ancient hag named Gagool is his chief advisor. She roots out any potential opposition by ordering regular witch hunts and murdering without trial all those identified as traitors. When she singles out Umbopa for this fate, it takes all Quatermain's skill to save his life.\nGagool, it appears, has already sensed what Umbopa soon after reveals: he is Ignosi, the rightful king of the Kukuanas. A rebellion breaks out, the Englishmen gaining support for Ignosi by taking advantage of their foreknowledge of a lunar eclipse to claim that they will black out the moon as proof of Ignosi's claim. The Englishmen join Ignosi's army in a furious battle. Although outnumbered, the rebels overthrow Twala, and Sir Henry lops off his head in a duel.\nThe Englishmen also capture Gagool, who reluctantly leads them to King Solomon's Mines. She shows them a treasure room inside a mountain, carved deep within the living rock and full of gold, diamonds and ivory. She then treacherously sneaks out while they are admiring the hoard and triggers a secret mechanism that closes the mine's vast stone door. Unfortunately for Gagool, a brief scuffle with a beautiful native named Foulata—who had become attached to Good after nursing him through his injuries sustained in the battle—causes her to be crushed under the stone door, though not before fatally stabbing Foulata. Their scant store of food and water rapidly dwindling, the trapped men prepare to die also. After a few despairing days sealed in the dark chamber, they find an escape route, bringing with them a few pocketfuls of diamonds from the immense trove, enough to make them rich.\nThe Englishmen bid farewell to a sorrowful Ignosi and return to the desert, assuring him that they value his friendship but must return to be with their own people, Ignosi in return promising them that they will be venerated and honoured among his people forever. Taking a different route, they find Sir Henry's brother stranded in an oasis by a broken leg, unable to go forward or back. They return to Durban and eventually to England, wealthy enough to live comfortable lives.\n\n", "full_text": "KING SOLOMON'S MINES\n\n\nby\n\nH. RIDER HAGGARD\n\n\n\n  DEDICATION\n\n  This faithful but unpretending record\n  of a remarkable adventure\n  is hereby respectfully dedicated\n  by the narrator,\n\n  ALLAN QUATERMAIN,\n\n  to all the big and little boys\n  who read it.\n\n\n\nPREPARER'S NOTE\n\n  This was typed from a 1907 edition published by Cassell and\n  Company, Limited.\n\n\n\nAUTHOR'S NOTE\n\n  The author ventures to take this opportunity to thank his readers\n  for the kind reception they have accorded to the successive\n  editions of this tale during the last twelve years. He hopes that\n  in its present form it will fall into the hands of an even wider\n  public, and that in years to come it may continue to afford\n  amusement to those who are still young enough at heart to love a\n  story of treasure, war, and wild adventure.\n\n  Ditchingham,\n  11 March, 1898.\n\n\n\nPOST SCRIPTUM\n\n  Now, in 1907, on the occasion of the issue of this edition, I can\n  only add how glad I am that my romance should continue to please\n  so many readers. Imagination has been verified by fact; the King\n  Solomon's Mines I dreamed of have been discovered, and are putting\n  out their gold once more, and, according to the latest reports,\n  their diamonds also; the Kukuanas or, rather, the Matabele, have\n  been tamed by the white man's bullets, but still there seem to be\n  many who find pleasure in these simple pages. That they may\n  continue so to do, even to the third and fourth generation, or\n  perhaps longer still, would, I am sure, be the hope of our old and\n  departed friend, Allan Quatermain.\n\n  H. Rider Haggard.\n  Ditchingham, 1907.\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNow that this book is printed, and about to be given to the world, a\nsense of its shortcomings both in style and contents, weighs very\nheavily upon me. As regards the latter, I can only say that it does not\npretend to be a full account of everything we did and saw. There are\nmany things connected with our journey into Kukuanaland that I should\nhave liked to dwell upon at length, which, as it is, have been scarcely\nalluded to. Amongst these are the curious legends which I collected\nabout the chain armour that saved us from destruction in the great\nbattle of Loo, and also about the \"Silent Ones\" or Colossi at the mouth\nof the stalactite cave. Again, if I had given way to my own impulses, I\nshould have wished to go into the differences, some of which are to my\nmind very suggestive, between the Zulu and Kukuana dialects. Also a few\npages might have been given up profitably to the consideration of the\nindigenous flora and fauna of Kukuanaland.[1] Then there remains the\nmost interesting subject--that, as it is, has only been touched on\nincidentally--of the magnificent system of military organisation in\nforce in that country, which, in my opinion, is much superior to that\ninaugurated by Chaka in Zululand, inasmuch as it permits of even more\nrapid mobilisation, and does not necessitate the employment of the\npernicious system of enforced celibacy. Lastly, I have scarcely spoken\nof the domestic and family customs of the Kukuanas, many of which are\nexceedingly quaint, or of their proficiency in the art of smelting and\nwelding metals. This science they carry to considerable perfection, of\nwhich a good example is to be seen in their \"tollas,\" or heavy throwing\nknives, the backs of these weapons being made of hammered iron, and the\nedges of beautiful steel welded with great skill on to the iron frames.\nThe fact of the matter is, I thought, with Sir Henry Curtis and Captain\nGood, that the best plan would be to tell my story in a plain,\nstraightforward manner, and to leave these matters to be dealt with\nsubsequently in whatever way ultimately may appear to be desirable. In\nthe meanwhile I shall, of course, be delighted to give all information\nin my power to anybody interested in such things.\n\nAnd now it only remains for me to offer apologies for my blunt way of\nwriting. I can but say in excuse of it that I am more accustomed to\nhandle a rifle than a pen, and cannot make any pretence to the grand\nliterary flights and flourishes which I see in novels--for sometimes I\nlike to read a novel. I suppose they--the flights and flourishes--are\ndesirable, and I regret not being able to supply them; but at the same\ntime I cannot help thinking that simple things are always the most\nimpressive, and that books are easier to understand when they are\nwritten in plain language, though perhaps I have no right to set up an\nopinion on such a matter. \"A sharp spear,\" runs the Kukuana saying,\n\"needs no polish\"; and on the same principle I venture to hope that a\ntrue story, however strange it may be, does not require to be decked\nout in fine words.\n\nAllan Quatermain.\n\n\n[1] I discovered eight varieties of antelope, with which I was\npreviously totally unacquainted, and many new species of plants, for\nthe most part of the bulbous tribe.--A.Q.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n       I  I MEET SIR HENRY CURTIS\n      II  THE LEGEND OF SOLOMON'S MINES\n     III  UMBOPA ENTERS OUR SERVICE\n      IV  AN ELEPHANT HUNT\n       V  OUR MARCH INTO THE DESERT\n      VI  WATER!

I wonder\nwhat sort of a history it will be when I have finished it, if ever I\ncome to the end of the trip! I have done a good many things in my life,\nwhich seems a long one to me, owing to my having begun work so young,\nperhaps. At an age when other boys are at school I was earning my\nliving as a trader in the old Colony. I have been trading, hunting,\nfighting, or mining ever since. And yet it is only eight months ago\nthat I made my pile. It is a big pile now that I have got it--I don't\nyet know how big--but I do not think I would go through the last\nfifteen or sixteen months again for it; no, not if I knew that I should\ncome out safe at the end, pile and all. But then I am a timid man, and\ndislike violence; moreover, I am almost sick of adventure. I wonder why\nI am going to write this book: it is not in my line. I am not a\nliterary man, though very devoted to the Old Testament and also to the\n\"Ingoldsby Legends.\" Let me try to set down my reasons, just to see if\nI have any.\n\nFirst reason: Because Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good asked me.\n\nSecond reason: Because I am laid up here at Durban with the pain in my\nleft leg. Ever since that confounded lion got hold of me I have been\nliable to this trouble, and being rather bad just now, it makes me limp\nmore than ever. There must be some poison in a lion's teeth, otherwise\nhow is it that when your wounds are healed they break out again,\ngenerally, mark you, at the same time of year that you got your\nmauling? It is a hard thing when one has shot sixty-five lions or more,\nas I have in the course of my life, that the sixty-sixth should chew\nyour leg like a quid of tobacco. It breaks the routine of the thing,\nand putting other considerations aside, I am an orderly man and don't\nlike that. This is by the way.\n\nThird reason: Because I want my boy Harry, who is over there at the\nhospital in London studying to become a doctor, to have something to\namuse him and keep him out of mischief for a week or so. Hospital work\nmust sometimes pall and grow rather dull, for even of cutting up dead\nbodies there may come satiety, and as this history will not be dull,\nwhatever else it may be, it will put a little life into things for a\nday or two while Harry is reading of our adventures.\n\nFourth reason and last: Because I am going to tell the strangest story\nthat I remember. It may seem a queer thing to say, especially\nconsidering that there is no woman in it--except Foulata. Stop, though!\nthere is Gagaoola, if she was a woman, and not a fiend. But she was a\nhundred at least, and therefore not marriageable, so I don't count her.\nAt any rate, I can safely say that there is not a _petticoat_ in the\nwhole history.\n\nWell, I had better come to the yoke. It is a stiff place, and I feel as\nthough I were bogged up to the axle. But, \"_sutjes, sutjes_,\" as the\nBoers say--I am sure I don't know how they spell it--softly does it. A\nstrong team will come through at last, that is, if they are not too\npoor. You can never do anything with poor oxen. Now to make a start.\n\nI, Allan Quatermain, of Durban, Natal, Gentleman, make oath and\nsay--That's how I headed my deposition before the magistrate about poor\nKhiva's and Ventvoegel's sad deaths; but somehow it doesn't seem quite\nthe right way to begin a book. And, besides, am I a gentleman? What is\na gentleman? I don't quite know, and yet I have had to do with\nniggers--no, I will scratch out that word \"niggers,\" for I do not like\nit. I've known natives who _are_, and so you will say, Harry, my boy,\nbefore you have done with this tale, and I have known mean whites with\nlots of money and fresh out from home, too, who _are not_.\n\nAt any rate, I was born a gentleman, though I have been nothing but a\npoor travelling trader and hunter all my life. Whether I have remained\nso I known not, you must judge of that. Heaven knows I've tried. I have\nkilled many men in my time, yet I have never slain wantonly or stained\nmy hand in innocent blood, but only in self-defence. The Almighty gave\nus our lives, and I suppose He meant us to defend them, at least I have\nalways acted on that, and I hope it will not be brought up against me\nwhen my clock strikes. There, there, it is a cruel and a wicked world,\nand for a timid man I have been mixed up in a great deal of fighting. I\ncannot tell the rights of it, but at any rate I have never stolen,\nthough once I cheated a Kafir out of a herd of cattle. But then he had\ndone me a dirty turn, and it has troubled me ever since into the\nbargain.\n\n\nWell, it is eighteen months or so ago since first I met Sir Henry\nCurtis and Captain Good. It was in this way. I had been up elephant\nhunting beyond Bamangwato, and had met with bad luck. Everything went\nwrong that trip, and to top up with I got the fever badly. So soon as I\nwas well enough I trekked down to the Diamond Fields, sold such ivory\nas I had, together with my wagon and oxen, discharged my hunters, and\ntook the post-cart to the Cape. After spending a week in Cape Town,\nfinding that they overcharged me at the hotel, and having seen\neverything there was to see, including the botanical gardens, which\nseem to me likely to confer a great benefit on the country, and the new\nHouses of Parliament, which I expect will do nothing of the sort, I\ndetermined to go back to Natal by the _Dunkeld_, then lying at the\ndocks waiting for the _Edinburgh Castle_ due in from England. I took my\nberth and went aboard, and that afternoon the Natal passengers from the\n_Edinburgh Castle_ transhipped, and we weighed and put to sea.\n\nAmong these passengers who came on board were two who excited my\ncuriosity. One, a gentleman of about thirty, was perhaps the\nbiggest-chested and longest-armed man I ever saw. He had yellow hair, a\nthick yellow beard, clear-cut features, and large grey eyes set deep in\nhis head. I never saw a finer-looking man, and somehow he reminded me\nof an ancient Dane. Not that I know much of ancient Danes, though I\nknew a modern Dane who did me out of ten pounds; but I remember once\nseeing a picture of some of those gentry, who, I take it, were a kind\nof white Zulus. They were drinking out of big horns, and their long\nhair hung down their backs. As I looked at my friend standing there by\nthe companion-ladder, I thought that if he only let his grow a little,\nput one of those chain shirts on to his great shoulders, and took hold\nof a battle-axe and a horn mug, he might have sat as a model for that\npicture. And by the way it is a curious thing, and just shows how the\nblood will out, I discovered afterwards that Sir Henry Curtis, for that\nwas the big man's name, is of Danish blood.[1] He also reminded me\nstrongly of somebody else, but at the time I could not remember who it\nwas.\n\nThe other man, who stood talking to Sir Henry, was stout and dark, and\nof quite a different cut. I suspected at once that he was a naval\nofficer; I don't know why, but it is difficult to mistake a navy man. I\nhave gone shooting trips with several of them in the course of my life,\nand they have always proved themselves the best and bravest and nicest\nfellows I ever met, though sadly given, some of them, to the use of\nprofane language. I asked a page or two back, what is a gentleman? I'll\nanswer the question now: A Royal Naval officer is, in a general sort of\nway, though of course there may be a black sheep among them here and\nthere. I fancy it is just the wide seas and the breath of God's winds\nthat wash their hearts and blow the bitterness out of their minds and\nmake them what men ought to be.\n\nWell, to return, I proved right again; I ascertained that the dark man\n_was_ a naval officer, a lieutenant of thirty-one, who, after seventeen\nyears' service, had been turned out of her Majesty's employ with the\nbarren honour of a commander's rank, because it was impossible that he\nshould be promoted. This is what people who serve the Queen have to\nexpect: to be shot out into the cold world to find a living just when\nthey are beginning really to understand their work, and to reach the\nprime of life. I suppose they don't mind it, but for my own part I had\nrather earn my bread as a hunter. One's halfpence are as scarce\nperhaps, but you do not get so many kicks.\n\nThe officer's name I found out--by referring to the passengers'\nlists--was Good--Captain John Good. He was broad, of medium height,\ndark, stout, and rather a curious man to look at. He was so very neat\nand so very clean-shaved, and he always wore an eye-glass in his right\neye. It seemed to grow there, for it had no string, and he never took\nit out except to wipe it. At first I thought he used to sleep in it,\nbut afterwards I found that this was a mistake. He put it in his\ntrousers pocket when he went to bed, together with his false teeth, of\nwhich he had two beautiful sets that, my own being none of the best,\nhave often caused me to break the tenth commandment. But I am\nanticipating.\n\nSoon after we had got under way evening closed in, and brought with it\nvery dirty weather. A keen breeze sprung up off land, and a kind of\naggravated Scotch mist soon drove everybody from the deck. As for the\n_Dunkeld_, she is a flat-bottomed punt, and going up light as she was,\nshe rolled very heavily. It almost seemed as though she would go right\nover, but she never did. It was quite impossible to walk about, so I\nstood near the engines where it was warm, and amused myself with\nwatching the pendulum, which was fixed opposite to me, swinging slowly\nbackwards and forwards as the vessel rolled, and marking the angle she\ntouched at each lurch.\n\n\"That pendulum's wrong; it is not properly weighted,\" suddenly said a\nsomewhat testy voice at my shoulder. Looking round I saw the naval\nofficer whom I had noticed when the passengers came aboard.\n\n\"Indeed, now what makes you think so?\" I asked.\n\n\"Think so. I don't think at all. Why there\"--as she righted herself\nafter a roll--\"if the ship had really rolled to the degree that thing\npointed to, then she would never have rolled again, that's all. But it\nis just like these merchant skippers, they are always so confoundedly\ncareless.\"\n\nJust then the dinner-bell rang, and I was not sorry, for it is a\ndreadful thing to have to listen to an officer of the Royal Navy when\nhe gets on to that subject. I only know one worse thing, and that is to\nhear a merchant skipper express his candid opinion of officers of the\nRoyal Navy.\n\nCaptain Good and I went down to dinner together, and there we found Sir\nHenry Curtis already seated. He and Captain Good were placed together,\nand I sat opposite to them. The captain and I soon fell into talk about\nshooting and what not; he asking me many questions, for he is very\ninquisitive about all sorts of things, and I answering them as well as\nI could. Presently he got on to elephants.\n\n\"Ah, sir,\" called out somebody who was sitting near me, \"you've reached\nthe right man for that; Hunter Quatermain should be able to tell you\nabout elephants if anybody can.\"\n\nSir Henry, who had been sitting quite quiet listening to our talk,\nstarted visibly.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" he said, leaning forward across the table, and\nspeaking in a low deep voice, a very suitable voice, it seemed to me,\nto come out of those great lungs. \"Excuse me, sir, but is your name\nAllan Quatermain?\"\n\nI said that it was.\n\nThe big man made no further remark, but I heard him mutter \"fortunate\"\ninto his beard.\n\nPresently dinner came to an end, and as we were leaving the saloon Sir\nHenry strolled up and asked me if I would come into his cabin to smoke\na pipe. I accepted, and he led the way to the _Dunkeld_ deck cabin, and\na very good cabin it is. It had been two cabins, but when Sir Garnet\nWolseley or one of those big swells went down the coast in the\n_Dunkeld_, they knocked away the partition and have never put it up\nagain. There was a sofa in the cabin, and a little table in front of\nit. Sir Henry sent the steward for a bottle of whisky, and the three of\nus sat down and lit our pipes.\n\n\"Mr. Quatermain,\" said Sir Henry Curtis, when the man had brought the\nwhisky and lit the lamp, \"the year before last about this time, you\nwere, I believe, at a place called Bamangwato, to the north of the\nTransvaal.\"\n\n\"I was,\" I answered, rather surprised that this gentleman should be so\nwell acquainted with my movements, which were not, so far as I was\naware, considered of general interest.\n\n\"You were trading there, were you not?\" put in Captain Good, in his\nquick way.\n\n\"I was. I took up a wagon-load of goods, made a camp outside the\nsettlement, and stopped till I had sold them.\"\n\nSir Henry was sitting opposite to me in a Madeira chair, his arms\nleaning on the table. He now looked up, fixing his large grey eyes full\nupon my face. There was a curious anxiety in them, I thought.\n\n\"Did you happen to meet a man called Neville there?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; he outspanned alongside of me for a fortnight to rest his\noxen before going on to the interior. I had a letter from a lawyer a\nfew months back, asking me if I knew what had become of him, which I\nanswered to the best of my ability at the time.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sir Henry, \"your letter was forwarded to me. You said in it\nthat the gentleman called Neville left Bamangwato at the beginning of\nMay in a wagon with a driver, a voorlooper, and a Kafir hunter called\nJim, announcing his intention of trekking if possible as far as Inyati,\nthe extreme trading post in the Matabele country, where he would sell\nhis wagon and proceed on foot. You also said that he did sell his\nwagon, for six months afterwards you saw the wagon in the possession of\na Portuguese trader, who told you that he had bought it at Inyati from\na white man whose name he had forgotten, and that he believed the white\nman with the native servant had started off for the interior on a\nshooting trip.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThen came a pause.\n\n\"Mr. Quatermain,\" said Sir Henry suddenly, \"I suppose you know or can\nguess nothing more of the reasons of my--of Mr. Neville's journey to\nthe northward, or as to what point that journey was directed?\"\n\n\"I heard something,\" I answered, and stopped. The subject was one which\nI did not care to discuss.\n\nSir Henry and Captain Good looked at each other, and Captain Good\nnodded.\n\n\"Mr. Quatermain,\" went on the former, \"I am going to tell you a story,\nand ask your advice, and perhaps your assistance. The agent who\nforwarded me your letter told me that I might rely on it implicitly, as\nyou were,\" he said, \"well known and universally respected in Natal, and\nespecially noted for your discretion.\"\n\nI bowed and drank some whisky and water to hide my confusion, for I am\na modest man--and Sir Henry went on.\n\n\"Mr. Neville was my brother.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said, starting, for now I knew of whom Sir Henry had reminded\nme when first I saw him. His brother was a much smaller man and had a\ndark beard, but now that I thought of it, he possessed eyes of the same\nshade of grey and with the same keen look in them: the features too\nwere not unlike.\n\n\"He was,\" went on Sir Henry, \"my only and younger brother, and till\nfive years ago I do not suppose that we were ever a month away from\neach other. But just about five years ago a misfortune befell us, as\nsometimes does happen in families. We quarrelled bitterly, and I\nbehaved unjustly to my brother in my anger.\"\n\nHere Captain Good nodded his head vigorously to himself. The ship gave\na big roll just then, so that the looking-glass, which was fixed\nopposite us to starboard, was for a moment nearly over our heads, and\nas I was sitting with my hands in my pockets and staring upwards, I\ncould see him nodding like anything.\n\n\"As I daresay you know,\" went on Sir Henry, \"if a man dies intestate,\nand has no property but land, real property it is called in England, it\nall descends to his eldest son. It so happened that just at the time\nwhen we quarrelled our father died intestate. He had put off making his\nwill until it was too late. The result was that my brother, who had not\nbeen brought up to any profession, was left without a penny. Of course\nit would have been my duty to provide for him, but at the time the\nquarrel between us was so bitter that I did not--to my shame I say it\n(and he sighed deeply)--offer to do anything. It was not that I grudged\nhim justice, but I waited for him to make advances, and he made none. I\nam sorry to trouble you with all this, Mr. Quatermain, but I must to\nmake things clear, eh, Good?\"\n\n\"Quite so, quite so,\" said the captain. \"Mr. Quatermain will, I am\nsure, keep this history to himself.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said I, for I rather pride myself on my discretion, for\nwhich, as Sir Henry had heard, I have some repute.\n\n\"Well,\" went on Sir Henry, \"my brother had a few hundred pounds to his\naccount at the time. Without saying anything to me he drew out this\npaltry sum, and, having adopted the name of Neville, started off for\nSouth Africa in the wild hope of making a fortune. This I learned\nafterwards. Some three years passed, and I heard nothing of my brother,\nthough I wrote several times. Doubtless the letters never reached him.\nBut as time went on I grew more and more troubled about him. I found\nout, Mr. Quatermain, that blood is thicker than water.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said I, thinking of my boy Harry.\n\n\"I found out, Mr. Quatermain, that I would have given half my fortune\nto know that my brother George, the only relation I possess, was safe\nand well, and that I should see him again.\"\n\n\"But you never did, Curtis,\" jerked out Captain Good, glancing at the\nbig man's face.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Quatermain, as time went on I became more and more anxious\nto find out if my brother was alive or dead, and if alive to get him\nhome again. I set enquiries on foot, and your letter was one of the\nresults. So far as it went it was satisfactory, for it showed that till\nlately George was alive, but it did not go far enough. So, to cut a\nlong story short, I made up my mind to come out and look for him\nmyself, and Captain Good was so kind as to come with me.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the captain; \"nothing else to do, you see. Turned out by my\nLords of the Admiralty to starve on half pay. And now perhaps, sir, you\nwill tell us what you know or have heard of the gentleman called\nNeville.\"\n\n\n[1] Mr. Quatermain's ideas about ancient Danes seem to be rather\nconfused; we have always understood that they were dark-haired people.\nProbably he was thinking of Saxons.--Editor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE LEGEND OF SOLOMON'S MINES\n\n\"What was it that you heard about my brother's journey at Bamangwato?\"\nasked Sir Henry, as I paused to fill my pipe before replying to Captain\nGood.\n\n\"I heard this,\" I answered, \"and I have never mentioned it to a soul\ntill to-day. I heard that he was starting for Solomon's Mines.\"\n\n\"Solomon's Mines?\" ejaculated both my hearers at once. \"Where are they?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said; \"I know where they are said to be. Once I saw\nthe peaks of the mountains that border them, but there were a hundred\nand thirty miles of desert between me and them, and I am not aware that\nany white man ever got across it save one. But perhaps the best thing I\ncan do is to tell you the legend of Solomon's Mines as I know it, you\npassing your word not to reveal anything I tell you without my\npermission. Do you agree to that? I have my reasons for asking.\"\n\nSir Henry nodded, and Captain Good replied, \"Certainly, certainly.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I began, \"as you may guess, generally speaking, elephant\nhunters are a rough set of men, who do not trouble themselves with much\nbeyond the facts of life and the ways of Kafirs. But here and there you\nmeet a man who takes the trouble to collect traditions from the\nnatives, and tries to make out a little piece of the history of this\ndark land. It was such a man as this who first told me the legend of\nSolomon's Mines, now a matter of nearly thirty years ago. That was when\nI was on my first elephant hunt in the Matabele country. His name was\nEvans, and he was killed the following year, poor fellow, by a wounded\nbuffalo, and lies buried near the Zambesi Falls. I was telling Evans\none night, I remember, of some wonderful workings I had found whilst\nhunting koodoo and eland in what is now the Lydenburg district of the\nTransvaal. I see they have come across these workings again lately in\nprospecting for gold, but I knew of them years ago. There is a great\nwide wagon road cut out of the solid rock, and leading to the mouth of\nthe working or gallery. Inside the mouth of this gallery are stacks of\ngold quartz piled up ready for roasting, which shows that the workers,\nwhoever they were, must have left in a hurry. Also, about twenty paces\nin, the gallery is built across, and a beautiful bit of masonry it is.\"\n\n\"'Ay,' said Evans, 'but I will spin you a queerer yarn than that'; and\nhe went on to tell me how he had found in the far interior a ruined\ncity, which he believed to be the Ophir of the Bible, and, by the way,\nother more learned men have said the same long since poor Evans's time.\nI was, I remember, listening open-eared to all these wonders, for I was\nyoung at the time, and this story of an ancient civilisation and of the\ntreasures which those old Jewish or Phoenician adventurers used to\nextract from a country long since lapsed into the darkest barbarism\ntook a great hold upon my imagination, when suddenly he said to me,\n'Lad, did you ever hear of the Suliman Mountains up to the north-west\nof the Mushakulumbwe country?' I told him I never had. 'Ah, well,' he\nsaid, 'that is where Solomon really had his mines, his diamond mines, I\nmean.'\n\n\"'How do you know that?' I asked.\n\n\"'Know it! why, what is \"Suliman\" but a corruption of Solomon?[1]\nBesides, an old Isanusi or witch doctoress up in the Manica country\ntold me all about it. She said that the people who lived across those\nmountains were a \"branch\" of the Zulus, speaking a dialect of Zulu, but\nfiner and bigger men even; that there lived among them great wizards,\nwho had learnt their art from white men when \"all the world was dark,\"\nand who had the secret of a wonderful mine of \"bright stones.\"'\n\n\"Well, I laughed at this story at the time, though it interested me,\nfor the Diamond Fields were not discovered then, but poor Evans went\noff and was killed, and for twenty years I never thought any more of\nthe matter. However, just twenty years afterwards--and that is a long\ntime, gentlemen; an elephant hunter does not often live for twenty\nyears at his business--I heard something more definite about Suliman's\nMountains and the country which lies beyond them. I was up beyond the\nManica country, at a place called Sitanda's Kraal, and a miserable\nplace it was, for a man could get nothing to eat, and there was but\nlittle game about. I had an attack of fever, and was in a bad way\ngenerally, when one day a Portugee arrived with a single companion--a\nhalf-breed. Now I know your low-class Delagoa Portugee well. There is\nno greater devil unhung in a general way, battening as he does upon\nhuman agony and flesh in the shape of slaves. But this was quite a\ndifferent type of man to the mean fellows whom I had been accustomed to\nmeet; indeed, in appearance he reminded me more of the polite doms I\nhave read about, for he was tall and thin, with large dark eyes and\ncurling grey mustachios. We talked together for a while, for he could\nspeak broken English, and I understood a little Portugee, and he told\nme that his name was Jose Silvestre, and that he had a place near\nDelagoa Bay. When he went on next day with his half-breed companion, he\nsaid 'Good-bye,' taking off his hat quite in the old style.\n\n\"'Good-bye, senor,' he said; 'if ever we meet again I shall be the\nrichest man in the world, and I will remember you.' I laughed a\nlittle--I was too weak to laugh much--and watched him strike out for\nthe great desert to the west, wondering if he was mad, or what he\nthought he was going to find there.\n\n\"A week passed, and I got the better of my fever. One evening I was\nsitting on the ground in front of the little tent I had with me,\nchewing the last leg of a miserable fowl I had bought from a native for\na bit of cloth worth twenty fowls, and staring at the hot red sun\nsinking down over the desert, when suddenly I saw a figure, apparently\nthat of a European, for it wore a coat, on the slope of the rising\nground opposite to me, about three hundred yards away. The figure crept\nalong on its hands and knees, then it got up and staggered forward a\nfew yards on its legs, only to fall and crawl again. Seeing that it\nmust be somebody in distress, I sent one of my hunters to help him, and\npresently he arrived, and who do you suppose it turned out to be?\"\n\n\"Jose Silvestre, of course,\" said Captain Good.\n\n\"Yes, Jose Silvestre, or rather his skeleton and a little skin. His\nface was a bright yellow with bilious fever, and his large dark eyes\nstood nearly out of his head, for all the flesh had gone. There was\nnothing but yellow parchment-like skin, white hair, and the gaunt bones\nsticking up beneath.\n\n\"'Water! for the sake of Christ, water!' he moaned and I saw that his\nlips were cracked, and his tongue, which protruded between them, was\nswollen and blackish.\n\n\"I gave him water with a little milk in it, and he drank it in great\ngulps, two quarts or so, without stopping. I would not let him have any\nmore. Then the fever took him again, and he fell down and began to rave\nabout Suliman's Mountains, and the diamonds, and the desert. I carried\nhim into the tent and did what I could for him, which was little\nenough; but I saw how it must end. About eleven o'clock he grew\nquieter, and I lay down for a little rest and went to sleep. At dawn I\nwoke again, and in the half light saw Silvestre sitting up, a strange,\ngaunt form, and gazing out towards the desert. Presently the first ray\nof the sun shot right across the wide plain before us till it reached\nthe faraway crest of one of the tallest of the Suliman Mountains more\nthan a hundred miles away.\n\n\"'There it is!' cried the dying man in Portuguese, and pointing with\nhis long, thin arm, 'but I shall never reach it, never. No one will\never reach it!'\n\n\"Suddenly, he paused, and seemed to take a resolution. 'Friend,' he\nsaid, turning towards me, 'are you there? My eyes grow dark.'\n\n\"'Yes,' I said; 'yes, lie down now, and rest.'\n\n\"'Ay,' he answered, 'I shall rest soon, I have time to rest--all\neternity. Listen, I am dying! You have been good to me. I will give you\nthe writing. Perhaps you will get there if you can live to pass the\ndesert, which has killed my poor servant and me.'\n\n\"Then he groped in his shirt and brought out what I thought was a Boer\ntobacco pouch made of the skin of the Swart-vet-pens or sable antelope.\nIt was fastened with a little strip of hide, what we call a rimpi, and\nthis he tried to loose, but could not. He handed it to me. 'Untie it,'\nhe said. I did so, and extracted a bit of torn yellow linen on which\nsomething was written in rusty letters. Inside this rag was a paper.\n\n\"Then he went on feebly, for he was growing weak: 'The paper has all\nthat is on the linen. It took me years to read. Listen: my ancestor, a\npolitical refugee from Lisbon, and one of the first Portuguese who\nlanded on these shores, wrote that when he was dying on those mountains\nwhich no white foot ever pressed before or since. His name was Jose da\nSilvestra, and he lived three hundred years ago. His slave, who waited\nfor him on this side of the mountains, found him dead, and brought the\nwriting home to Delagoa. It has been in the family ever since, but none\nhave cared to read it, till at last I did. And I have lost my life over\nit, but another may succeed, and become the richest man in the\nworld--the richest man in the world. Only give it to no one, senor; go\nyourself!'\n\n\"Then he began to wander again, and in an hour it was all over.\n\n\"God rest him! he died very quietly, and I buried him deep, with big\nboulders on his breast; so I do not think that the jackals can have dug\nhim up. And then I came away.\"\n\n\"Ay, but the document?\" said Sir Henry, in a tone of deep interest.\n\n\"Yes, the document; what was in it?\" added the captain.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, if you like I will tell you. I have never showed it\nto anybody yet except to a drunken old Portuguese trader who translated\nit for me, and had forgotten all about it by the next morning. The\noriginal rag is at my home in Durban, together with poor Dom Jose's\ntranslation, but I have the English rendering in my pocket-book, and a\nfacsimile of the map, if it can be called a map. Here it is.\"\n\n[Illustration: MAP]\n\n  \"I, Jose da Silvestra, who am now dying of hunger in the little\n  cave where no snow is on the north side of the nipple of the\n  southernmost of the two mountains I have named Sheba's Breasts,\n  write this in the year 1590 with a cleft bone upon a remnant of my\n  raiment, my blood being the ink. If my slave should find it when\n  he comes, and should bring it to Delagoa, let my friend (name\n  illegible) bring the matter to the knowledge of the king, that he\n  may send an army which, if they live through the desert and the\n  mountains, and can overcome the brave Kukuanes and their devilish\n  arts, to which end many priests should be brought, will make him\n  the richest king since Solomon. With my own eyes I have seen the\n  countless diamonds stored in Solomon's treasure chamber behind the\n  white Death; but through the treachery of Gagool the witch-finder\n  I might bring nought away, scarcely my life. Let him who comes\n  follow the map, and climb the snow of Sheba's left breast till he\n  reaches the nipple, on the north side of which is the great road\n  Solomon made, from whence three days' journey to the King's\n  Palace. Let him kill Gagool. Pray for my soul. Farewell.\n\nJose da Silvestra.\"[2]\n\n\nWhen I had finished reading the above, and shown the copy of the map,\ndrawn by the dying hand of the old Dom with his blood for ink, there\nfollowed a silence of astonishment.\n\n\"Well,\" said Captain Good, \"I have been round the world twice, and put\nin at most ports, but may I be hung for a mutineer if ever I heard a\nyarn like this out of a story book, or in it either, for the matter of\nthat.\"\n\n\"It's a queer tale, Mr. Quatermain,\" said Sir Henry. \"I suppose you are\nnot hoaxing us? It is, I know, sometimes thought allowable to take in a\ngreenhorn.\"\n\n\"If you think that, Sir Henry,\" I said, much put out, and pocketing my\npaper--for I do not like to be thought one of those silly fellows who\nconsider it witty to tell lies, and who are for ever boasting to\nnewcomers of extraordinary hunting adventures which never happened--\"if\nyou think that, why, there is an end to the matter,\" and I rose to go.\n\nSir Henry laid his large hand upon my shoulder. \"Sit down, Mr.\nQuatermain,\" he said, \"I beg your pardon; I see very well you do not\nwish to deceive us, but the story sounded so strange that I could\nhardly believe it.\"\n\n\"You shall see the original map and writing when we reach Durban,\" I\nanswered, somewhat mollified, for really when I came to consider the\nquestion it was scarcely wonderful that he should doubt my good faith.\n\n\"But,\" I went on, \"I have not told you about your brother. I knew the\nman Jim who was with him. He was a Bechuana by birth, a good hunter,\nand for a native a very clever man. That morning on which Mr. Neville\nwas starting I saw Jim standing by my wagon and cutting up tobacco on\nthe disselboom.\n\n\"'Jim,' said I, 'where are you off to this trip? It is elephants?'\n\n\"'No, Baas,' he answered, 'we are after something worth much more than\nivory.'\n\n\"'And what might that be?' I said, for I was curious. 'Is it gold?'\n\n\"'No, Baas, something worth more than gold,' and he grinned.\n\n\"I asked no more questions, for I did not like to lower my dignity by\nseeming inquisitive, but I was puzzled. Presently Jim finished cutting\nhis tobacco.\n\n\"'Baas,' said he.\n\n\"I took no notice.\n\n\"'Baas,' said he again.\n\n\"'Eh, boy, what is it?' I asked.\n\n\"'Baas, we are going after diamonds.'\n\n\"'Diamonds! why, then, you are steering in the wrong direction; you\nshould head for the Fields.'\n\n\"'Baas, have you ever heard of Suliman's Berg?'--that is, Solomon's\nMountains, Sir Henry.\n\n\"'Ay!'\n\n\"'Have you ever heard of the diamonds there?'\n\n\"'I have heard a foolish story, Jim.'\n\n\"'It is no story, Baas. Once I knew a woman who came from there, and\nreached Natal with her child, she told me:--she is dead now.'\n\n\"'Your master will feed the assvoegels'--that is, vultures--'Jim, if he\ntries to reach Suliman's country, and so will you if they can get any\npickings off your worthless old carcass,' said I.\n\n\"He grinned. 'Mayhap, Baas. Man must die; I'd rather like to try a new\ncountry myself; the elephants are getting worked out about here.'\n\n\"'Ah! my boy,' I said, 'you wait till the \"pale old man\" gets a grip of\nyour yellow throat, and then we shall hear what sort of a tune you\nsing.'\n\n\"Half an hour after that I saw Neville's wagon move off. Presently Jim\ncame back running. 'Good-bye, Baas,' he said. 'I didn't like to start\nwithout bidding you good-bye, for I daresay you are right, and that we\nshall never trek south again.'\n\n\"'Is your master really going to Suliman's Berg, Jim, or are you lying?'\n\n\"'No,' he answered, 'he is going. He told me he was bound to make his\nfortune somehow, or try to; so he might as well have a fling for the\ndiamonds.'\n\n\"'Oh!' I said; 'wait a bit, Jim; will you take a note to your master,\nJim, and promise not to give it to him till you reach Inyati?' which\nwas some hundred miles off.\n\n\"'Yes, Baas.'\n\n\"So I took a scrap of paper, and wrote on it, 'Let him who comes . . .\nclimb the snow of Sheba's left breast, till he reaches the nipple, on\nthe north side of which is Solomon's great road.'\n\n\"'Now, Jim,' I said, 'when you give this to your master, tell him he\nhad better follow the advice on it implicitly. You are not to give it\nto him now, because I don't want him back asking me questions which I\nwon't answer. Now be off, you idle fellow, the wagon is nearly out of\nsight.'\n\n\"Jim took the note and went, and that is all I know about your brother,\nSir Henry; but I am much afraid--\"\n\n\"Mr. Quatermain,\" said Sir Henry, \"I am going to look for my brother; I\nam going to trace him to Suliman's Mountains, and over them if\nnecessary, till I find him, or until I know that he is dead. Will you\ncome with me?\"\n\nI am, as I think I have said, a cautious man, indeed a timid one, and\nthis suggestion frightened me. It seemed to me that to undertake such a\njourney would be to go to certain death, and putting other\nconsiderations aside, as I had a son to support, I could not afford to\ndie just then.\n\n\"No, thank you, Sir Henry, I think I had rather not,\" I answered. \"I am\ntoo old for wild-goose chases of that sort, and we should only end up\nlike my poor friend Silvestre. I have a son dependent on me, so I\ncannot afford to risk my life foolishly.\"\n\nBoth Sir Henry and Captain Good looked very disappointed.\n\n\"Mr. Quatermain,\" said the former, \"I am well off, and I am bent upon\nthis business. You may put the remuneration for your services at\nwhatever figure you like in reason, and it shall be paid over to you\nbefore we start. Moreover, I will arrange in the event of anything\nuntoward happening to us or to you, that your son shall be suitably\nprovided for. You will see from this offer how necessary I think your\npresence. Also if by chance we should reach this place, and find\ndiamonds, they shall belong to you and Good equally. I do not want\nthem. But of course that promise is worth nothing at all, though the\nsame thing would apply to any ivory we might get. You may pretty well\nmake your own terms with me, Mr. Quatermain; and of course I shall pay\nall expenses.\"\n\n\"Sir Henry,\" said I, \"this is the most liberal proposal I ever had, and\none not to be sneezed at by a poor hunter and trader. But the job is\nthe biggest I have come across, and I must take time to think it over.\nI will give you my answer before we get to Durban.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" answered Sir Henry.\n\nThen I said good-night and turned in, and dreamt about poor long-dead\nSilvestre and the diamonds.\n\n\n[1] Suliman is the Arabic form of Solomon.--Editor.\n\n[2] Eu Jose da Silvestra que estou morrendo de fome na pequena cova\n    onde nao ha neve ao lado norte do bico mais ao sul das duas\n    montanhas que chamei scio de Sheba; escrevo isto no anno 1590;\n    escrevo isto com um pedaco d'osso n' um farrapo de minha roupa e\n    com sangue meu por tinta; se o meu escravo der com isto quando\n    venha ao levar para Lourenzo Marquez, que o meu amigo ---------\n    leve a cousa ao conhecimento d' El Rei, para que possa mandar um\n    exercito que, se desfiler pelo deserto e pelas montonhas e mesmo\n    sobrepujar os bravos Kukuanes e suas artes diabolicas, pelo que se\n    deviam trazer muitos padres Far o Rei mais rico depois de Salomao\n    Com meus proprios olhos ve os di amantes sem conto guardados nas\n    camaras do thesouro de Salomao a traz da morte branca, mas pela\n    traicao de Gagoal a feiticeira achadora, nada poderia levar, e\n    apenas a minha vida.

Jose da Silvestra.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nUMBOPA ENTERS OUR SERVICE\n\nIt takes from four to five days, according to the speed of the vessel\nand the state of the weather, to run up from the Cape to Durban.\nSometimes, if the landing is bad at East London, where they have not\nyet made that wonderful harbour they talk so much of, and sink such a\nmint of money in, a ship is delayed for twenty-four hours before the\ncargo boats can get out to take off the goods. But on this occasion we\nhad not to wait at all, for there were no breakers on the Bar to speak\nof, and the tugs came out at once with the long strings of ugly\nflat-bottomed boats behind them, into which the packages were bundled\nwith a crash. It did not matter what they might be, over they went\nslap-bang; whether they contained china or woollen goods they met with\nthe same treatment. I saw one case holding four dozen of champagne\nsmashed all to bits, and there was the champagne fizzing and boiling\nabout in the bottom of the dirty cargo boat. It was a wicked waste, and\nevidently so the Kafirs in the boat thought, for they found a couple of\nunbroken bottles, and knocking off the necks drank the contents. But\nthey had not allowed for the expansion caused by the fizz in the wine,\nand, feeling themselves swelling, rolled about in the bottom of the\nboat, calling out that the good liquor was \"tagati\"--that is,\nbewitched. I spoke to them from the vessel, and told them it was the\nwhite man's strongest medicine, and that they were as good as dead men.\nThose Kafirs went to the shore in a very great fright, and I do not\nthink that they will touch champagne again.\n\nWell, all the time that we were steaming up to Natal I was thinking\nover Sir Henry Curtis's offer. We did not speak any more on the subject\nfor a day or two, though I told them many hunting yarns, all true ones.\nThere is no need to tell lies about hunting, for so many curious things\nhappen within the knowledge of a man whose business it is to hunt; but\nthis is by the way.\n\nAt last, one beautiful evening in January, which is our hottest month,\nwe steamed past the coast of Natal, expecting to make Durban Point by\nsunset. It is a lovely coast all along from East London, with its red\nsandhills and wide sweeps of vivid green, dotted here and there with\nKafir kraals, and bordered by a ribbon of white surf, which spouts up\nin pillars of foam where it hits the rocks. But just before you come to\nDurban there is a peculiar richness about the landscape. There are the\nsheer kloofs cut in the hills by the rushing rains of centuries, down\nwhich the rivers sparkle; there is the deepest green of the bush,\ngrowing as God planted it, and the other greens of the mealie gardens\nand the sugar patches, while now and again a white house, smiling out\nat the placid sea, puts a finish and gives an air of homeliness to the\nscene. For to my mind, however beautiful a view may be, it requires the\npresence of man to make it complete, but perhaps that is because I have\nlived so much in the wilderness, and therefore know the value of\ncivilisation, though to be sure it drives away the game. The Garden of\nEden, no doubt, looked fair before man was, but I always think that it\nmust have been fairer when Eve adorned it.\n\nTo return, we had miscalculated a little, and the sun was well down\nbefore we dropped anchor off the Point, and heard the gun which told\nthe good folks of Durban that the English Mail was in. It was too late\nto think of getting over the Bar that night, so we went comfortably to\ndinner, after seeing the Mails carried off in the life-boat.\n\nWhen we came up again the moon was out, and shining so brightly over\nsea and shore that she almost paled the quick, large flashes from the\nlighthouse. From the shore floated sweet spicy odours that always\nremind me of hymns and missionaries, and in the windows of the houses\non the Berea sparkled a hundred lights. From a large brig lying near\nalso came the music of the sailors as they worked at getting the anchor\nup in order to be ready for the wind. Altogether it was a perfect\nnight, such a night as you sometimes get in Southern Africa, and it\nthrew a garment of peace over everybody as the moon threw a garment of\nsilver over everything. Even the great bulldog, belonging to a sporting\npassenger, seemed to yield to its gentle influences, and forgetting his\nyearning to come to close quarters with the baboon in a cage on the\nfoc'sle, snored happily at the door of the cabin, dreaming no doubt\nthat he had finished him, and happy in his dream.\n\nWe three--that is, Sir Henry Curtis, Captain Good, and myself--went and\nsat by the wheel, and were quiet for a while.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Quatermain,\" said Sir Henry presently, \"have you been\nthinking about my proposals?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" echoed Captain Good, \"what do you think of them, Mr. Quatermain?\nI hope that you are going to give us the pleasure of your company so\nfar as Solomon's Mines, or wherever the gentleman you knew as Neville\nmay have got to.\"\n\nI rose and knocked out my pipe before I answered. I had not made up my\nmind, and wanted an additional moment to decide. Before the burning\ntobacco had fallen into the sea I had decided; just that little extra\nsecond did the trick. It is often the way when you have been bothering\na long time over a thing.\n\n\"Yes, gentlemen,\" I said, sitting down again, \"I will go, and by your\nleave I will tell you why, and on what conditions. First for the terms\nwhich I ask.\n\n\"1. You are to pay all expenses, and any ivory or other valuables we\nmay get is to be divided between Captain Good and myself.\n\n\"2. That you give me L500 for my services on the trip before we start,\nI undertaking to serve you faithfully till you choose to abandon the\nenterprise, or till we succeed, or disaster overtakes us.\n\n\"3. That before we trek you execute a deed agreeing, in the event of my\ndeath or disablement, to pay my boy Harry, who is studying medicine\nover there in London, at Guy's Hospital, a sum of L200 a year for five\nyears, by which time he ought to be able to earn a living for himself\nif he is worth his salt. That is all, I think, and I daresay you will\nsay quite enough too.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Sir Henry, \"I accept them gladly. I am bent upon this\nproject, and would pay more than that for your help, considering the\npeculiar and exclusive knowledge which you possess.\"\n\n\"Pity I did not ask it, then, but I won't go back on my word. And now\nthat I have got my terms I will tell you my reasons for making up my\nmind to go. First of all, gentlemen, I have been observing you both for\nthe last few days, and if you will not think me impertinent I may say\nthat I like you, and believe that we shall come up well to the yoke\ntogether. That is something, let me tell you, when one has a long\njourney like this before one.\n\n\"And now as to the journey itself, I tell you flatly, Sir Henry and\nCaptain Good, that I do not think it probable we can come out of it\nalive, that is, if we attempt to cross the Suliman Mountains. What was\nthe fate of the old Dom da Silvestra three hundred years ago? What was\nthe fate of his descendant twenty years ago? What has been your\nbrother's fate? I tell you frankly, gentlemen, that as their fates were\nso I believe ours will be.\"\n\nI paused to watch the effect of my words. Captain Good looked a little\nuncomfortable, but Sir Henry's face did not change. \"We must take our\nchance,\" he said.\n\n\"You may perhaps wonder,\" I went on, \"why, if I think this, I, who am,\nas I told you, a timid man, should undertake such a journey. It is for\ntwo reasons. First I am a fatalist, and believe that my time is\nappointed to come quite without reference to my own movements and will,\nand that if I am to go to Suliman's Mountains to be killed, I shall go\nthere and shall be killed. God Almighty, no doubt, knows His mind about\nme, so I need not trouble on that point. Secondly, I am a poor man. For\nnearly forty years I have hunted and traded, but I have never made more\nthan a living. Well, gentlemen, I don't know if you are aware that the\naverage life of an elephant hunter from the time he takes to the trade\nis between four and five years. So you see I have lived through about\nseven generations of my class, and I should think that my time cannot\nbe far off, anyway. Now, if anything were to happen to me in the\nordinary course of business, by the time my debts are paid there would\nbe nothing left to support my son Harry whilst he was getting in the\nway of earning a living, whereas now he will be set up for five years.\nThere is the whole affair in a nutshell.\"\n\n\"Mr. Quatermain,\" said Sir Henry, who had been giving me his most\nserious attention, \"your motives for undertaking an enterprise which\nyou believe can only end in disaster reflect a great deal of credit on\nyou. Whether or not you are right, of course time and the event alone\ncan show. But whether you are right or wrong, I may as well tell you at\nonce that I am going through with it to the end, sweet or bitter. If we\nare to be knocked on the head, all I have to say is, that I hope we get\na little shooting first, eh, Good?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" put in the captain. \"We have all three of us been\naccustomed to face danger, and to hold our lives in our hands in\nvarious ways, so it is no good turning back now. And now I vote we go\ndown to the saloon and take an observation just for luck, you know.\"\nAnd we did--through the bottom of a tumbler.\n\nNext day we went ashore, and I put up Sir Henry and Captain Good at the\nlittle shanty I have built on the Berea, and which I call my home.\nThere are only three rooms and a kitchen in it, and it is constructed\nof green brick with a galvanised iron roof, but there is a good garden\nwith the best loquot trees in it that I know, and some nice young\nmangoes, of which I hope great things. The curator of the botanical\ngardens gave them to me. It is looked after by an old hunter of mine\nnamed Jack, whose thigh was so badly broken by a buffalo cow in\nSikukunis country that he will never hunt again. But he can potter\nabout and garden, being a Griqua by birth. You will never persuade a\nZulu to take much interest in gardening. It is a peaceful art, and\npeaceful arts are not in his line.\n\nSir Henry and Good slept in a tent pitched in my little grove of orange\ntrees at the end of the garden, for there was no room for them in the\nhouse, and what with the smell of the bloom, and the sight of the green\nand golden fruit--in Durban you will see all three on the tree\ntogether--I daresay it is a pleasant place enough, for we have few\nmosquitos here on the Berea, unless there happens to come an unusually\nheavy rain.\n\nWell, to get on--for if I do not, Harry, you will be tired of my story\nbefore ever we fetch up at Suliman's Mountains--having once made up my\nmind to go I set about making the necessary preparations. First I\nsecured the deed from Sir Henry, providing for you, my boy, in case of\naccidents. There was some difficulty about its legal execution, as Sir\nHenry was a stranger here, and the property to be charged is over the\nwater; but it was ultimately got over with the help of a lawyer, who\ncharged L20 for the job--a price that I thought outrageous. Then I\npocketed my cheque for L500.\n\nHaving paid this tribute to my bump of caution, I purchased a wagon and\na span of oxen on Sir Henry's behalf, and beauties they were. It was a\ntwenty-two-foot wagon with iron axles, very strong, very light, and\nbuilt throughout of stink wood; not quite a new one, having been to the\nDiamond Fields and back, but, in my opinion, all the better for that,\nfor I could see that the wood was well seasoned. If anything is going\nto give in a wagon, or if there is green wood in it, it will show out\non the first trip. This particular vehicle was what we call a\n\"half-tented\" wagon, that is to say, only covered in over the after\ntwelve feet, leaving all the front part free for the necessaries we had\nto carry with us. In this after part were a hide \"cartle,\" or bed, on\nwhich two people could sleep, also racks for rifles, and many other\nlittle conveniences. I gave L125 for it, and think that it was cheap at\nthe price.\n\nThen I bought a beautiful team of twenty Zulu oxen, which I had kept my\neye on for a year or two. Sixteen oxen is the usual number for a team,\nbut I took four extra to allow for casualties. These Zulu cattle are\nsmall and light, not more than half the size of the Africander oxen,\nwhich are generally used for transport purposes; but they will live\nwhere the Africanders would starve, and with a moderate load can make\nfive miles a day better going, being quicker and not so liable to\nbecome footsore. What is more, this lot were thoroughly \"salted,\" that\nis, they had worked all over South Africa, and so had become proof,\ncomparatively speaking, against red water, which so frequently destroys\nwhole teams of oxen when they get on to strange \"veldt\" or grass\ncountry. As for \"lung sick,\" which is a dreadful form of pneumonia,\nvery prevalent in this country, they had all been inoculated against\nit. This is done by cutting a slit in the tail of an ox, and binding in\na piece of the diseased lung of an animal which has died of the\nsickness. The result is that the ox sickens, takes the disease in a\nmild form, which causes its tail to drop off, as a rule about a foot\nfrom the root, and becomes proof against future attacks. It seems cruel\nto rob the animal of his tail, especially in a country where there are\nso many flies, but it is better to sacrifice the tail and keep the ox\nthan to lose both tail and ox, for a tail without an ox is not much\ngood, except to dust with. Still it does look odd to trek along behind\ntwenty stumps, where there ought to be tails. It seems as though Nature\nmade a trifling mistake, and stuck the stern ornaments of a lot of\nprize bull-dogs on to the rumps of the oxen.\n\nNext came the question of provisioning and medicines, one which\nrequired the most careful consideration, for what we had to do was to\navoid lumbering the wagon, and yet to take everything absolutely\nnecessary. Fortunately, it turned out that Good is a bit of a doctor,\nhaving at some point in his previous career managed to pass through a\ncourse of medical and surgical instruction, which he has more or less\nkept up. He is not, of course, qualified, but he knows more about it\nthan many a man who can write M.D. after his name, as we found out\nafterwards, and he had a splendid travelling medicine chest and a set\nof instruments. Whilst we were at Durban he cut off a Kafir's big toe\nin a way which it was a pleasure to see. But he was quite nonplussed\nwhen the Kafir, who had sat stolidly watching the operation, asked him\nto put on another, saying that a \"white one\" would do at a pinch.\n\nThere remained, when these questions were satisfactorily settled, two\nfurther important points for consideration, namely, that of arms and\nthat of servants. As to the arms I cannot do better than put down a\nlist of those which we finally decided on from among the ample store\nthat Sir Henry had brought with him from England, and those which I\nowned. I copy it from my pocket-book, where I made the entry at the\ntime.\n\n\"Three heavy breech-loading double-eight elephant guns, weighing about\nfifteen pounds each, to carry a charge of eleven drachms of black\npowder.\" Two of these were by a well-known London firm, most excellent\nmakers, but I do not know by whom mine, which is not so highly\nfinished, was made. I have used it on several trips, and shot a good\nmany elephants with it, and it has always proved a most superior\nweapon, thoroughly to be relied on.\n\n\"Three double-500 Expresses, constructed to stand a charge of six\ndrachms,\" sweet weapons, and admirable for medium-sized game, such as\neland or sable antelope, or for men, especially in an open country and\nwith the semi-hollow bullet.\n\n\"One double No. 12 central-fire Keeper's shot-gun, full choke both\nbarrels.\" This gun proved of the greatest service to us afterwards in\nshooting game for the pot.\n\n\"Three Winchester repeating rifles (not carbines), spare guns.\n\n\"Three single-action Colt's revolvers, with the heavier, or American\npattern of cartridge.\"\n\nThis was our total armament, and doubtless the reader will observe that\nthe weapons of each class were of the same make and calibre, so that\nthe cartridges were interchangeable, a very important point. I make no\napology for detailing it at length, as every experienced hunter will\nknow how vital a proper supply of guns and ammunition is to the success\nof an expedition.\n\nNow as to the men who were to go with us. After much consultation we\ndecided that their number should be limited to five, namely, a driver,\na leader, and three servants.\n\nThe driver and leader I found without much difficulty, two Zulus, named\nrespectively Goza and Tom; but to get the servants proved a more\ndifficult matter. It was necessary that they should be thoroughly\ntrustworthy and brave men, as in a business of this sort our lives\nmight depend upon their conduct. At last I secured two, one a Hottentot\nnamed Ventvoegel, or \"windbird,\" and one a little Zulu named Khiva, who\nhad the merit of speaking English perfectly. Ventvoegel I had known\nbefore; he was one of the most perfect \"spoorers,\" that is, game\ntrackers, I ever had to do with, and tough as whipcord. He never seemed\nto tire. But he had one failing, so common with his race, drink. Put\nhim within reach of a bottle of gin and you could not trust him.\nHowever, as we were going beyond the region of grog-shops this little\nweakness of his did not so much matter.\n\nHaving secured these two men I looked in vain for a third to suit my\npurpose, so we determined to start without one, trusting to luck to\nfind a suitable man on our way up country. But, as it happened, on the\nevening before the day we had fixed for our departure the Zulu Khiva\ninformed me that a Kafir was waiting to see me. Accordingly, when we\nhad done dinner, for we were at table at the time, I told Khiva to\nbring him in. Presently a tall, handsome-looking man, somewhere about\nthirty years of age, and very light-coloured for a Zulu, entered, and\nlifting his knob-stick by way of salute, squatted himself down in the\ncorner on his haunches, and sat silent. I did not take any notice of\nhim for a while, for it is a great mistake to do so. If you rush into\nconversation at once, a Zulu is apt to think you a person of little\ndignity or consequence. I observed, however, that he was a \"Keshla\" or\nringed man; that is, he wore on his head the black ring, made of a\nspecies of gum polished with fat and worked up in the hair, which is\nusually assumed by Zulus on attaining a certain age or dignity. Also it\nstruck me that his face was familiar to me.\n\n\"Well,\" I said at last, \"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Umbopa,\" answered the man in a slow, deep voice.\n\n\"I have seen your face before.\"\n\n\"Yes; the Inkoosi, the chief, my father, saw my face at the place of\nthe Little Hand\"--that is, Isandhlwana--\"on the day before the battle.\"\n\nThen I remembered. I was one of Lord Chelmsford's guides in that\nunlucky Zulu War, and had the good fortune to leave the camp in charge\nof some wagons on the day before the battle. While I was waiting for\nthe cattle to be inspanned I fell into conversation with this man, who\nheld some small command among the native auxiliaries, and he had\nexpressed to me his doubts as to the safety of the camp. At the time I\ntold him to hold his tongue, and leave such matters to wiser heads; but\nafterwards I thought of his words.\n\n\"I remember,\" I said; \"what is it you want?\"\n\n\"It is this, 'Macumazahn.'\" That is my Kafir name, and means the man\nwho gets up in the middle of the night, or, in vulgar English, he who\nkeeps his eyes open. \"I hear that you go on a great expedition far into\nthe North with the white chiefs from over the water. Is it a true word?\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"I hear that you go even to the Lukanga River, a moon's journey beyond\nthe Manica country. Is this so also, 'Macumazahn?'\"\n\n\"Why do you ask whither we go? What is it to you?\" I answered\nsuspiciously, for the objects of our journey had been kept a dead\nsecret.\n\n\"It is this, O white men, that if indeed you travel so far I would\ntravel with you.\"\n\nThere was a certain assumption of dignity in the man's mode of speech,\nand especially in his use of the words \"O white men,\" instead of \"O\nInkosis,\" or chiefs, which struck me.\n\n\"You forget yourself a little,\" I said. \"Your words run out unawares.\nThat is not the way to speak. What is your name, and where is your\nkraal? Tell us, that we may know with whom we have to deal.\"\n\n\"My name is Umbopa. I am of the Zulu people, yet not of them. The house\nof my tribe is in the far North; it was left behind when the Zulus came\ndown here a 'thousand years ago,' long before Chaka reigned in\nZululand. I have no kraal. I have wandered for many years. I came from\nthe North as a child to Zululand. I was Cetewayo's man in the\nNkomabakosi Regiment, serving there under the great Captain,\nUmslopogaasi of the Axe,[1] who taught my hands to fight. Afterwards I\nran away from Zululand and came to Natal because I wanted to see the\nwhite man's ways. Next I fought against Cetewayo in the war. Since then\nI have been working in Natal. Now I am tired, and would go North again.\nHere is not my place. I want no money, but I am a brave man, and am\nworth my place and meat. I have spoken.\"\n\nI was rather puzzled by this man and his way of speech. It was evident\nto me from his manner that in the main he was telling the truth, but\nsomehow he seemed different from the ordinary run of Zulus, and I\nrather mistrusted his offer to come without pay. Being in a difficulty,\nI translated his words to Sir Henry and Good, and asked them their\nopinion.\n\nSir Henry told me to ask him to stand up. Umbopa did so, at the same\ntime slipping off the long military great coat which he wore, and\nrevealing himself naked except for the moocha round his centre and a\nnecklace of lions' claws. Certainly he was a magnificent-looking man; I\nnever saw a finer native. Standing about six foot three high he was\nbroad in proportion, and very shapely. In that light, too, his skin\nlooked scarcely more than dark, except here and there where deep black\nscars marked old assegai wounds. Sir Henry walked up to him and looked\ninto his proud, handsome face.\n\n\"They make a good pair, don't they?\" said Good; \"one as big as the\nother.\"\n\n\"I like your looks, Mr. Umbopa, and I will take you as my servant,\"\nsaid Sir Henry in English.\n\nUmbopa evidently understood him, for he answered in Zulu, \"It is well\";\nand then added, with a glance at the white man's great stature and\nbreadth, \"We are men, thou and I.\"\n\n\n[1] For the history of Umslopogaasi and his Axe, the reader is referred\nto the books called \"Allan Quatermain\" and \"Nada the Lily.\"--Editor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nAN ELEPHANT HUNT\n\nNow I do not propose to narrate at full length all the incidents of our\nlong travel up to Sitanda's Kraal, near the junction of the Lukanga and\nKalukwe Rivers. It was a journey of more than a thousand miles from\nDurban, the last three hundred or so of which we had to make on foot,\nowing to the frequent presence of the dreadful \"tsetse\" fly, whose bite\nis fatal to all animals except donkeys and men.\n\nWe left Durban at the end of January, and it was in the second week of\nMay that we camped near Sitanda's Kraal. Our adventures on the way were\nmany and various, but as they are of the sort which befall every\nAfrican hunter--with one exception to be presently detailed--I shall\nnot set them down here, lest I should render this history too wearisome.\n\nAt Inyati, the outlying trading station in the Matabele country, of\nwhich Lobengula (a great and cruel scoundrel) is king, with many\nregrets we parted from our comfortable wagon. Only twelve oxen remained\nto us out of the beautiful span of twenty which I had bought at Durban.\nOne we lost from the bite of a cobra, three had perished from \"poverty\"\nand the want of water, one strayed, and the other three died from\neating the poisonous herb called \"tulip.\" Five more sickened from this\ncause, but we managed to cure them with doses of an infusion made by\nboiling down the tulip leaves. If administered in time this is a very\neffective antidote.\n\nThe wagon and the oxen we left in the immediate charge of Goza and Tom,\nour driver and leader, both trustworthy boys, requesting a worthy\nScotch missionary who lived in this distant place to keep an eye on\nthem. Then, accompanied by Umbopa, Khiva, Ventvoegel, and half a dozen\nbearers whom we hired on the spot, we started off on foot upon our wild\nquest. I remember we were all a little silent on the occasion of this\ndeparture, and I think that each of us was wondering if we should ever\nsee our wagon again; for my part I never expected to do so. For a while\nwe tramped on in silence, till Umbopa, who was marching in front, broke\ninto a Zulu chant about how some brave men, tired of life and the\ntameness of things, started off into a vast wilderness to find new\nthings or die, and how, lo and behold! when they had travelled far into\nthe wilderness they found that it was not a wilderness at all, but a\nbeautiful place full of young wives and fat cattle, of game to hunt and\nenemies to kill.\n\nThen we all laughed and took it for a good omen. Umbopa was a cheerful\nsavage, in a dignified sort of way, when he was not suffering from one\nof his fits of brooding, and he had a wonderful knack of keeping up our\nspirits. We all grew very fond of him.\n\nAnd now for the one adventure to which I am going to treat myself, for\nI do dearly love a hunting yarn.\n\nAbout a fortnight's march from Inyati we came across a peculiarly\nbeautiful bit of well-watered woodland country. The kloofs in the hills\nwere covered with dense bush, \"idoro\" bush as the natives call it, and\nin some places, with the \"wacht-een-beche,\" or \"wait-a-little thorn,\"\nand there were great quantities of the lovely \"machabell\" tree, laden\nwith refreshing yellow fruit having enormous stones. This tree is the\nelephant's favourite food, and there were not wanting signs that the\ngreat brutes had been about, for not only was their spoor frequent, but\nin many places the trees were broken down and even uprooted. The\nelephant is a destructive feeder.\n\nOne evening, after a long day's march, we came to a spot of great\nloveliness. At the foot of a bush-clad hill lay a dry river-bed, in\nwhich, however, were to be found pools of crystal water all trodden\nround with the hoof-prints of game. Facing this hill was a park-like\nplain, where grew clumps of flat-topped mimosa, varied with occasional\nglossy-leaved machabells, and all round stretched the sea of pathless,\nsilent bush.\n\nAs we emerged into this river-bed path suddenly we started a troop of\ntall giraffes, who galloped, or rather sailed off, in their strange\ngait, their tails screwed up over their backs, and their hoofs rattling\nlike castanets. They were about three hundred yards from us, and\ntherefore practically out of shot, but Good, who was walking ahead, and\nwho had an express loaded with solid ball in his hand, could not resist\ntemptation. Lifting his gun, he let drive at the last, a young cow. By\nsome extraordinary chance the ball struck it full on the back of the\nneck, shattering the spinal column, and that giraffe went rolling head\nover heels just like a rabbit. I never saw a more curious thing.\n\n\"Curse it!\" said Good--for I am sorry to say he had a habit of using\nstrong language when excited--contracted, no doubt, in the course of\nhis nautical career; \"curse it! I've killed him.\"\n\n\"_Ou_, Bougwan,\" ejaculated the Kafirs; \"_ou! ou!_\"\n\nThey called Good \"Bougwan,\" or Glass Eye, because of his eye-glass.\n\n\"Oh, 'Bougwan!'\" re-echoed Sir Henry and I, and from that day Good's\nreputation as a marvellous shot was established, at any rate among the\nKafirs. Really he was a bad one, but whenever he missed we overlooked\nit for the sake of that giraffe.\n\nHaving set some of the \"boys\" to cut off the best of the giraffe's\nmeat, we went to work to build a \"scherm\" near one of the pools and\nabout a hundred yards to its right. This is done by cutting a quantity\nof thorn bushes and piling them in the shape of a circular hedge. Then\nthe space enclosed is smoothed, and dry tambouki grass, if obtainable,\nis made into a bed in the centre, and a fire or fires lighted.\n\nBy the time the \"scherm\" was finished the moon peeped up, and our\ndinners of giraffe steaks and roasted marrow-bones were ready. How we\nenjoyed those marrow-bones, though it was rather a job to crack them! I\nknow of no greater luxury than giraffe marrow, unless it is elephant's\nheart, and we had that on the morrow. We ate our simple meal by the\nlight of the moon, pausing at times to thank Good for his wonderful\nshot; then we began to smoke and yarn, and a curious picture we must\nhave made squatting there round the fire. I, with my short grizzled\nhair sticking up straight, and Sir Henry with his yellow locks, which\nwere getting rather long, were rather a contrast, especially as I am\nthin, and short, and dark, weighing only nine stone and a half, and Sir\nHenry is tall, and broad, and fair, and weighs fifteen. But perhaps the\nmost curious-looking of the three, taking all the circumstances of the\ncase into consideration, was Captain John Good, R.N. There he sat upon\na leather bag, looking just as though he had come in from a comfortable\nday's shooting in a civilised country, absolutely clean, tidy, and well\ndressed. He wore a shooting suit of brown tweed, with a hat to match,\nand neat gaiters. As usual, he was beautifully shaved, his eye-glass\nand his false teeth appeared to be in perfect order, and altogether he\nlooked the neatest man I ever had to do with in the wilderness. He even\nsported a collar, of which he had a supply, made of white gutta-percha.\n\n\"You see, they weigh so little,\" he said to me innocently, when I\nexpressed my astonishment at the fact; \"and I always like to turn out\nlike a gentleman.\" Ah! if he could have foreseen the future and the\nraiment prepared for him.\n\nWell, there we three sat yarning away in the beautiful moonlight, and\nwatching the Kafirs a few yards off sucking their intoxicating \"daccha\"\nfrom a pipe of which the mouthpiece was made of the horn of an eland,\ntill one by one they rolled themselves up in their blankets and went to\nsleep by the fire, that is, all except Umbopa, who was a little apart,\nhis chin resting on his hand, and thinking deeply. I noticed that he\nnever mixed much with the other Kafirs.\n\nPresently, from the depths of the bush behind us, came a loud \"_woof_,\n_woof_!\" \"That's a lion,\" said I, and we all started up to listen.\nHardly had we done so, when from the pool, about a hundred yards off,\nwe heard the strident trumpeting of an elephant. \"_Unkungunklovo_!\n_Indlovu_!\" \"Elephant! Elephant!\" whispered the Kafirs, and a few\nminutes afterwards we saw a succession of vast shadowy forms moving\nslowly from the direction of the water towards the bush.\n\nUp jumped Good, burning for slaughter, and thinking, perhaps, that it\nwas as easy to kill elephant as he had found it to shoot giraffe, but I\ncaught him by the arm and pulled him down.\n\n\"It's no good,\" I whispered, \"let them go.\"\n\n\"It seems that we are in a paradise of game. I vote we stop here a day\nor two, and have a go at them,\" said Sir Henry, presently.\n\nI was rather surprised, for hitherto Sir Henry had always been for\npushing forward as fast as possible, more especially since we\nascertained at Inyati that about two years ago an Englishman of the\nname of Neville _had_ sold his wagon there, and gone on up country. But\nI suppose his hunter instincts got the better of him for a while.\n\nGood jumped at the idea, for he was longing to have a shot at those\nelephants; and so, to speak the truth, did I, for it went against my\nconscience to let such a herd as that escape without a pull at them.\n\n\"All right, my hearties,\" said I. \"I think we want a little recreation.\nAnd now let's turn in, for we ought to be off by dawn, and then perhaps\nwe may catch them feeding before they move on.\"\n\nThe others agreed, and we proceeded to make our preparations. Good took\noff his clothes, shook them, put his eye-glass and his false teeth into\nhis trousers pocket, and folding each article neatly, placed it out of\nthe dew under a corner of his mackintosh sheet. Sir Henry and I\ncontented ourselves with rougher arrangements, and soon were curled up\nin our blankets, and dropping off into the dreamless sleep that rewards\nthe traveller.\n\nGoing, going, go--What was that?\n\nSuddenly, from the direction of the water came sounds of violent\nscuffling, and next instant there broke upon our ears a succession of\nthe most awful roars. There was no mistaking their origin; only a lion\ncould make such a noise as that. We all jumped up and looked towards\nthe water, in the direction of which we saw a confused mass, yellow and\nblack in colour, staggering and struggling towards us. We seized our\nrifles, and slipping on our veldtschoons, that is shoes made of\nuntanned hide, ran out of the scherm. By this time the mass had fallen,\nand was rolling over and over on the ground, and when we reached the\nspot it struggled no longer, but lay quite still.\n\nNow we saw what it was. On the grass there lay a sable antelope\nbull--the most beautiful of all the African antelopes--quite dead, and\ntransfixed by its great curved horns was a magnificent black-maned\nlion, also dead. Evidently what had happened was this: The sable\nantelope had come down to drink at the pool where the lion--no doubt\nthe same which we had heard--was lying in wait. While the antelope\ndrank, the lion had sprung upon him, only to be received upon the sharp\ncurved horns and transfixed. Once before I saw a similar thing happen.\nThen the lion, unable to free himself, had torn and bitten at the back\nand neck of the bull, which, maddened with fear and pain, had rushed on\nuntil it dropped dead.\n\nAs soon as we had examined the beasts sufficiently we called the\nKafirs, and between us managed to drag their carcases up to the scherm.\nAfter that we went in and lay down, to wake no more till dawn.\n\nWith the first light we were up and making ready for the fray. We took\nwith us the three eight-bore rifles, a good supply of ammunition, and\nour large water-bottles, filled with weak cold tea, which I have always\nfound the best stuff to shoot on. After swallowing a little breakfast\nwe started, Umbopa, Khiva, and Ventvoegel accompanying us. The other\nKafirs we left with instructions to skin the lion and the sable\nantelope, and to cut up the latter.\n\nWe had no difficulty in finding the broad elephant trail, which\nVentvoegel, after examination, pronounced to have been made by between\ntwenty and thirty elephants, most of them full-grown bulls. But the\nherd had moved on some way during the night, and it was nine o'clock,\nand already very hot, before, by the broken trees, bruised leaves and\nbark, and smoking droppings, we knew that we could not be far from them.\n\nPresently we caught sight of the herd, which numbered, as Ventvoegel had\nsaid, between twenty and thirty, standing in a hollow, having finished\ntheir morning meal, and flapping their great ears. It was a splendid\nsight, for they were only about two hundred yards from us. Taking a\nhandful of dry grass, I threw it into the air to see how the wind was;\nfor if once they winded us I knew they would be off before we could get\na shot. Finding that, if anything, it blew from the elephants to us, we\ncrept on stealthily, and thanks to the cover managed to get within\nforty yards or so of the great brutes. Just in front of us, and\nbroadside on, stood three splendid bulls, one of them with enormous\ntusks. I whispered to the others that I would take the middle one; Sir\nHenry covering the elephant to the left, and Good the bull with the big\ntusks.\n\n\"Now,\" I whispered.\n\nBoom! boom! boom! went the three heavy rifles, and down came Sir\nHenry's elephant dead as a hammer, shot right through the heart. Mine\nfell on to its knees and I thought that he was going to die, but in\nanother moment he was up and off, tearing along straight past me. As he\nwent I gave him the second barrel in the ribs, and this brought him\ndown in good earnest. Hastily slipping in two fresh cartridges I ran\nclose up to him, and a ball through the brain put an end to the poor\nbrute's struggles. Then I turned to see how Good had fared with the big\nbull, which I had heard screaming with rage and pain as I gave mine its\nquietus. On reaching the captain I found him in a great state of\nexcitement. It appeared that on receiving the bullet the bull had\nturned and come straight for his assailant, who had barely time to get\nout of his way, and then charged on blindly past him, in the direction\nof our encampment. Meanwhile the herd had crashed off in wild alarm in\nthe other direction.\n\nFor awhile we debated whether to go after the wounded bull or to follow\nthe herd, and finally deciding for the latter alternative, departed,\nthinking that we had seen the last of those big tusks. I have often\nwished since that we had. It was easy work to follow the elephants, for\nthey had left a trail like a carriage road behind them, crushing down\nthe thick bush in their furious flight as though it were tambouki grass.\n\nBut to come up with them was another matter, and we had struggled on\nunder the broiling sun for over two hours before we found them. With\nthe exception of one bull, they were standing together, and I could\nsee, from their unquiet way and the manner in which they kept lifting\ntheir trunks to test the air, that they were on the look-out for\nmischief. The solitary bull stood fifty yards or so to this side of the\nherd, over which he was evidently keeping sentry, and about sixty yards\nfrom us. Thinking that he would see or wind us, and that it would\nprobably start them off again if we tried to get nearer, especially as\nthe ground was rather open, we all aimed at this bull, and at my\nwhispered word, we fired. The three shots took effect, and down he went\ndead. Again the herd started, but unfortunately for them about a\nhundred yards further on was a nullah, or dried-out water track, with\nsteep banks, a place very much resembling the one where the Prince\nImperial was killed in Zululand. Into this the elephants plunged, and\nwhen we reached the edge we found them struggling in wild confusion to\nget up the other bank, filling the air with their screams, and\ntrumpeting as they pushed one another aside in their selfish panic,\njust like so many human beings. Now was our opportunity, and firing\naway as quickly as we could load, we killed five of the poor beasts,\nand no doubt should have bagged the whole herd, had they not suddenly\ngiven up their attempts to climb the bank and rushed headlong down the\nnullah. We were too tired to follow them, and perhaps also a little\nsick of slaughter, eight elephants being a pretty good bag for one day.\n\nSo after we were rested a little, and the Kafirs had cut out the hearts\nof two of the dead elephants for supper, we started homewards, very\nwell pleased with our day's work, having made up our minds to send the\nbearers on the morrow to chop away the tusks.\n\nShortly after we re-passed the spot where Good had wounded the\npatriarchal bull we came across a herd of eland, but did not shoot at\nthem, as we had plenty of meat. They trotted past us, and then stopped\nbehind a little patch of bush about a hundred yards away, wheeling\nround to look at us. As Good was anxious to get a near view of them,\nnever having seen an eland close, he handed his rifle to Umbopa, and,\nfollowed by Khiva, strolled up to the patch of bush. We sat down and\nwaited for him, not sorry of the excuse for a little rest.\n\nThe sun was just going down in its reddest glory, and Sir Henry and I\nwere admiring the lovely scene, when suddenly we heard an elephant\nscream, and saw its huge and rushing form with uplifted trunk and tail\nsilhouetted against the great fiery globe of the sun. Next second we\nsaw something else, and that was Good and Khiva tearing back towards us\nwith the wounded bull--for it was he--charging after them. For a moment\nwe did not dare to fire--though at that distance it would have been of\nlittle use if we had done so--for fear of hitting one of them, and the\nnext a dreadful thing happened--Good fell a victim to his passion for\ncivilised dress. Had he consented to discard his trousers and gaiters\nlike the rest of us, and to hunt in a flannel shirt and a pair of\nveldt-schoons, it would have been all right. But as it was, his\ntrousers cumbered him in that desperate race, and presently, when he\nwas about sixty yards from us, his boot, polished by the dry grass,\nslipped, and down he went on his face right in front of the elephant.\n\nWe gave a gasp, for we knew that he must die, and ran as hard as we\ncould towards him. In three seconds it had ended, but not as we\nthought. Khiva, the Zulu boy, saw his master fall, and brave lad as he\nwas, turned and flung his assegai straight into the elephant's face. It\nstuck in his trunk.\n\nWith a scream of pain, the brute seized the poor Zulu, hurled him to\nthe earth, and placing one huge foot on to his body about the middle,\ntwined its trunk round his upper part and _tore him in two_.\n\nWe rushed up mad with horror, and fired again and again, till presently\nthe elephant fell upon the fragments of the Zulu.\n\nAs for Good, he rose and wrung his hands over the brave man who had\ngiven his life to save him, and, though I am an old hand, I felt a lump\ngrow in my throat. Umbopa stood contemplating the huge dead elephant\nand the mangled remains of poor Khiva.\n\n\"Ah, well,\" he said presently, \"he is dead, but he died like a man!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nOUR MARCH INTO THE DESERT\n\nWe had killed nine elephants, and it took us two days to cut out the\ntusks, and having brought them into camp, to bury them carefully in the\nsand under a large tree, which made a conspicuous mark for miles round.\nIt was a wonderfully fine lot of ivory. I never saw a better, averaging\nas it did between forty and fifty pounds a tusk. The tusks of the great\nbull that killed poor Khiva scaled one hundred and seventy pounds the\npair, so nearly as we could judge.\n\nAs for Khiva himself, we buried what remained of him in an ant-bear\nhole, together with an assegai to protect himself with on his journey\nto a better world. On the third day we marched again, hoping that we\nmight live to return to dig up our buried ivory, and in due course,\nafter a long and wearisome tramp, and many adventures which I have not\nspace to detail, we reached Sitanda's Kraal, near the Lukanga River,\nthe real starting-point of our expedition. Very well do I recollect our\narrival at that place. To the right was a scattered native settlement\nwith a few stone cattle kraals and some cultivated lands down by the\nwater, where these savages grew their scanty supply of grain, and\nbeyond it stretched great tracts of waving \"veld\" covered with tall\ngrass, over which herds of the smaller game were wandering. To the left\nlay the vast desert. This spot appears to be the outpost of the fertile\ncountry, and it would be difficult to say to what natural causes such\nan abrupt change in the character of the soil is due. But so it is.\n\nJust below our encampment flowed a little stream, on the farther side\nof which is a stony slope, the same down which, twenty years before, I\nhad seen poor Silvestre creeping back after his attempt to reach\nSolomon's Mines, and beyond that slope begins the waterless desert,\ncovered with a species of karoo shrub.\n\nIt was evening when we pitched our camp, and the great ball of the sun\nwas sinking into the desert, sending glorious rays of many-coloured\nlight flying all over its vast expanse. Leaving Good to superintend the\narrangement of our little camp, I took Sir Henry with me, and walking\nto the top of the slope opposite, we gazed across the desert. The air\nwas very clear, and far, far away I could distinguish the faint blue\noutlines, here and there capped with white, of the Suliman Berg.\n\n\"There,\" I said, \"there is the wall round Solomon's Mines, but God\nknows if we shall ever climb it.\"\n\n\"My brother should be there, and if he is, I shall reach him somehow,\"\nsaid Sir Henry, in that tone of quiet confidence which marked the man.\n\n\"I hope so,\" I answered, and turned to go back to the camp, when I saw\nthat we were not alone. Behind us, also gazing earnestly towards the\nfar-off mountains, stood the great Kafir Umbopa.\n\nThe Zulu spoke when he saw that I had observed him, addressing Sir\nHenry, to whom he had attached himself.\n\n\"Is it to that land that thou wouldst journey, Incubu?\" (a native word\nmeaning, I believe, an elephant, and the name given to Sir Henry by the\nKafirs), he said, pointing towards the mountain with his broad assegai.\n\nI asked him sharply what he meant by addressing his master in that\nfamiliar way. It is very well for natives to have a name for one among\nthemselves, but it is not decent that they should call a white man by\ntheir heathenish appellations to his face. The Zulu laughed a quiet\nlittle laugh which angered me.\n\n\"How dost thou know that I am not the equal of the Inkosi whom I\nserve?\" he said. \"He is of a royal house, no doubt; one can see it in\nhis size and by his mien; so, mayhap, am I. At least, I am as great a\nman. Be my mouth, O Macumazahn, and say my words to the Inkoos Incubu,\nmy master, for I would speak to him and to thee.\"\n\nI was angry with the man, for I am not accustomed to be talked to in\nthat way by Kafirs, but somehow he impressed me, and besides I was\ncurious to know what he had to say. So I translated, expressing my\nopinion at the same time that he was an impudent fellow, and that his\nswagger was outrageous.\n\n\"Yes, Umbopa,\" answered Sir Henry, \"I would journey there.\"\n\n\"The desert is wide and there is no water in it, the mountains are high\nand covered with snow, and man cannot say what lies beyond them behind\nthe place where the sun sets; how shalt thou come thither, Incubu, and\nwherefore dost thou go?\"\n\nI translated again.\n\n\"Tell him,\" answered Sir Henry, \"that I go because I believe that a man\nof my blood, my brother, has gone there before me, and I journey to\nseek him.\"\n\n\"That is so, Incubu; a Hottentot I met on the road told me that a white\nman went out into the desert two years ago towards those mountains with\none servant, a hunter. They never came back.\"\n\n\"How do you know it was my brother?\" asked Sir Henry.\n\n\"Nay, I know not. But the Hottentot, when I asked what the white man\nwas like, said that he had thine eyes and a black beard. He said, too,\nthat the name of the hunter with him was Jim; that he was a Bechuana\nhunter and wore clothes.\"\n\n\"There is no doubt about it,\" said I; \"I knew Jim well.\"\n\nSir Henry nodded. \"I was sure of it,\" he said. \"If George set his mind\nupon a thing he generally did it. It was always so from his boyhood. If\nhe meant to cross the Suliman Berg he has crossed it, unless some\naccident overtook him, and we must look for him on the other side.\"\n\nUmbopa understood English, though he rarely spoke it.\n\n\"It is a far journey, Incubu,\" he put in, and I translated his remark.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Sir Henry, \"it is far. But there is no journey upon\nthis earth that a man may not make if he sets his heart to it. There is\nnothing, Umbopa, that he cannot do, there are no mountains he may not\nclimb, there are no deserts he cannot cross, save a mountain and a\ndesert of which you are spared the knowledge, if love leads him and he\nholds his life in his hands counting it as nothing, ready to keep it or\nlose it as Heaven above may order.\"\n\nI translated.\n\n\"Great words, my father,\" answered the Zulu--I always called him a\nZulu, though he was not really one--\"great swelling words fit to fill\nthe mouth of a man. Thou art right, my father Incubu. Listen! what is\nlife? It is a feather, it is the seed of the grass, blown hither and\nthither, sometimes multiplying itself and dying in the act, sometimes\ncarried away into the heavens. But if that seed be good and heavy it\nmay perchance travel a little way on the road it wills. It is well to\ntry and journey one's road and to fight with the air. Man must die. At\nthe worst he can but die a little sooner. I will go with thee across\nthe desert and over the mountains, unless perchance I fall to the\nground on the way, my father.\"\n\nHe paused awhile, and then went on with one of those strange bursts of\nrhetorical eloquence that Zulus sometimes indulge in, which to my mind,\nfull though they are of vain repetitions, show that the race is by no\nmeans devoid of poetic instinct and of intellectual power.\n\n\"What is life? Tell me, O white men, who are wise, who know the secrets\nof the world, and of the world of stars, and the world that lies above\nand around the stars; who flash your words from afar without a voice;\ntell me, white men, the secret of our life--whither it goes and whence\nit comes!\n\n\"You cannot answer me; you know not. Listen, I will answer. Out of the\ndark we came, into the dark we go. Like a storm-driven bird at night we\nfly out of the Nowhere; for a moment our wings are seen in the light of\nthe fire, and, lo! we are gone again into the Nowhere. Life is nothing.\nLife is all. It is the Hand with which we hold off Death. It is the\nglow-worm that shines in the night-time and is black in the morning; it\nis the white breath of the oxen in winter; it is the little shadow that\nruns across the grass and loses itself at sunset.\"\n\n\"You are a strange man,\" said Sir Henry, when he had ceased.\n\nUmbopa laughed. \"It seems to me that we are much alike, Incubu. Perhaps\n_I_ seek a brother over the mountains.\"\n\nI looked at him suspiciously. \"What dost thou mean?\" I asked; \"what\ndost thou know of those mountains?\"\n\n\"A little; a very little. There is a strange land yonder, a land of\nwitchcraft and beautiful things; a land of brave people, and of trees,\nand streams, and snowy peaks, and of a great white road. I have heard\nof it. But what is the good of talking? It grows dark. Those who live\nto see will see.\"\n\nAgain I looked at him doubtfully. The man knew too much.\n\n\"You need not fear me, Macumazahn,\" he said, interpreting my look. \"I\ndig no holes for you to fall in. I make no plots. If ever we cross\nthose mountains behind the sun I will tell what I know. But Death sits\nupon them. Be wise and turn back. Go and hunt elephants, my masters. I\nhave spoken.\"\n\nAnd without another word he lifted his spear in salutation, and\nreturned towards the camp, where shortly afterwards we found him\ncleaning a gun like any other Kafir.\n\n\"That is an odd man,\" said Sir Henry.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered I, \"too odd by half. I don't like his little ways. He\nknows something, and will not speak out. But I suppose it is no use\nquarrelling with him. We are in for a curious trip, and a mysterious\nZulu won't make much difference one way or another.\"\n\nNext day we made our arrangements for starting. Of course it was\nimpossible to drag our heavy elephant rifles and other kit with us\nacross the desert, so, dismissing our bearers, we made an arrangement\nwith an old native who had a kraal close by to take care of them till\nwe returned. It went to my heart to leave such things as those sweet\ntools to the tender mercies of an old thief of a savage whose greedy\neyes I could see gloating over them. But I took some precautions.\n\nFirst of all I loaded all the rifles, placing them at full cock, and\ninformed him that if he touched them they would go off. He tried the\nexperiment instantly with my eight-bore, and it did go off, and blew a\nhole right through one of his oxen, which were just then being driven\nup to the kraal, to say nothing of knocking him head over heels with\nthe recoil. He got up considerably startled, and not at all pleased at\nthe loss of the ox, which he had the impudence to ask me to pay for,\nand nothing would induce him to touch the guns again.\n\n\"Put the live devils out of the way up there in the thatch,\" he said,\n\"or they will murder us all.\"\n\nThen I told him that, when we came back, if one of those things was\nmissing I would kill him and his people by witchcraft; and if we died\nand he tried to steal the rifles I would come and haunt him and turn\nhis cattle mad and his milk sour till life was a weariness, and would\nmake the devils in the guns come out and talk to him in a way he did\nnot like, and generally gave him a good idea of judgment to come. After\nthat he promised to look after them as though they were his father's\nspirit. He was a very superstitious old Kafir and a great villain.\n\nHaving thus disposed of our superfluous gear we arranged the kit we\nfive--Sir Henry, Good, myself, Umbopa, and the Hottentot\nVentvoegel--were to take with us on our journey. It was small enough,\nbut do what we would we could not get its weight down under about forty\npounds a man. This is what it consisted of:--\n\nThe three express rifles and two hundred rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe two Winchester repeating rifles (for Umbopa and Ventvoegel), with\ntwo hundred rounds of cartridge.\n\nFive Cochrane's water-bottles, each holding four pints.\n\nFive blankets.\n\nTwenty-five pounds' weight of biltong--i.e. sun-dried game flesh.\n\nTen pounds' weight of best mixed beads for gifts.\n\nA selection of medicine, including an ounce of quinine, and one or two\nsmall surgical instruments.\n\nOur knives, a few sundries, such as a compass, matches, a pocket\nfilter, tobacco, a trowel, a bottle of brandy, and the clothes we stood\nin.\n\nThis was our total equipment, a small one indeed for such a venture,\nbut we dared not attempt to carry more. Indeed, that load was a heavy\none per man with which to travel across the burning desert, for in such\nplaces every additional ounce tells. But we could not see our way to\nreducing the weight. There was nothing taken but what was absolutely\nnecessary.\n\nWith great difficulty, and by the promise of a present of a good\nhunting-knife each, I succeeded in persuading three wretched natives\nfrom the village to come with us for the first stage, twenty miles, and\nto carry a large gourd holding a gallon of water apiece. My object was\nto enable us to refill our water-bottles after the first night's march,\nfor we determined to start in the cool of the evening. I gave out to\nthese natives that we were going to shoot ostriches, with which the\ndesert abounded. They jabbered and shrugged their shoulders, saying\nthat we were mad and should perish of thirst, which I must say seemed\nprobable; but being desirous of obtaining the knives, which were almost\nunknown treasures up there, they consented to come, having probably\nreflected that, after all, our subsequent extinction would be no affair\nof theirs.\n\nAll next day we rested and slept, and at sunset ate a hearty meal of\nfresh beef washed down with tea, the last, as Good remarked sadly, we\nwere likely to drink for many a long day. Then, having made our final\npreparations, we lay down and waited for the moon to rise. At last,\nabout nine o'clock, up she came in all her glory, flooding the wild\ncountry with light, and throwing a silver sheen on the expanse of\nrolling desert before us, which looked as solemn and quiet and as alien\nto man as the star-studded firmament above. We rose up, and in a few\nminutes were ready, and yet we hesitated a little, as human nature is\nprone to hesitate on the threshold of an irrevocable step. We three\nwhite men stood by ourselves. Umbopa, assegai in hand and a rifle\nacross his shoulders, looked out fixedly across the desert a few paces\nahead of us; while the hired natives, with the gourds of water, and\nVentvoegel, were gathered in a little knot behind.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Sir Henry presently, in his deep voice, \"we are going\non about as strange a journey as men can make in this world. It is very\ndoubtful if we can succeed in it. But we are three men who will stand\ntogether for good or for evil to the last. Now before we start let us\nfor a moment pray to the Power who shapes the destinies of men, and who\nages since has marked out our paths, that it may please Him to direct\nour steps in accordance with His will.\"\n\nTaking off his hat, for the space of a minute or so, he covered his\nface with his hands, and Good and I did likewise.\n\nI do not say that I am a first-rate praying man, few hunters are, and\nas for Sir Henry, I never heard him speak like that before, and only\nonce since, though deep down in his heart I believe that he is very\nreligious. Good too is pious, though apt to swear. Anyhow I do not\nremember, excepting on one single occasion, ever putting up a better\nprayer in my life than I did during that minute, and somehow I felt the\nhappier for it. Our future was so completely unknown, and I think that\nthe unknown and the awful always bring a man nearer to his Maker.\n\n\"And now,\" said Sir Henry, \"_trek_!\"\n\nSo we started.\n\nWe had nothing to guide ourselves by except the distant mountains and\nold Jose da Silvestre's chart, which, considering that it was drawn by\na dying and half-distraught man on a fragment of linen three centuries\nago, was not a very satisfactory sort of thing to work with. Still,\nour sole hope of success depended upon it, such as it was. If we failed\nin finding that pool of bad water which the old Dom marked as being\nsituated in the middle of the desert, about sixty miles from our\nstarting-point, and as far from the mountains, in all probability we\nmust perish miserably of thirst. But to my mind the chances of our\nfinding it in that great sea of sand and karoo scrub seemed almost\ninfinitesimal. Even supposing that da Silvestra had marked the pool\ncorrectly, what was there to prevent its having been dried up by the\nsun generations ago, or trampled in by game, or filled with the\ndrifting sand?\n\nOn we tramped silently as shades through the night and in the heavy\nsand. The karoo bushes caught our feet and retarded us, and the sand\nworked into our veldtschoons and Good's shooting-boots, so that every\nfew miles we had to stop and empty them; but still the night kept\nfairly cool, though the atmosphere was thick and heavy, giving a sort\nof creamy feel to the air, and we made fair progress. It was very\nsilent and lonely there in the desert, oppressively so indeed. Good\nfelt this, and once began to whistle \"The Girl I left behind me,\" but\nthe notes sounded lugubrious in that vast place, and he gave it up.\n\nShortly afterwards a little incident occurred which, though it startled\nus at the time, gave rise to a laugh. Good was leading, as the holder\nof the compass, which, being a sailor, of course he understood\nthoroughly, and we were toiling along in single file behind him, when\nsuddenly we heard the sound of an exclamation, and he vanished. Next\nsecond there arose all around us a most extraordinary hubbub, snorts,\ngroans, and wild sounds of rushing feet. In the faint light, too, we\ncould descry dim galloping forms half hidden by wreaths of sand. The\nnatives threw down their loads and prepared to bolt, but remembering\nthat there was nowhere to run to, they cast themselves upon the ground\nand howled out that it was ghosts. As for Sir Henry and myself, we\nstood amazed; nor was our amazement lessened when we perceived the form\nof Good careering off in the direction of the mountains, apparently\nmounted on the back of a horse and halloaing wildly. In another second\nhe threw up his arms, and we heard him come to the earth with a thud.\n\nThen I saw what had happened; we had stumbled upon a herd of sleeping\nquagga, on to the back of one of which Good actually had fallen, and\nthe brute naturally enough got up and made off with him. Calling out to\nthe others that it was all right, I ran towards Good, much afraid lest\nhe should be hurt, but to my great relief I found him sitting in the\nsand, his eye-glass still fixed firmly in his eye, rather shaken and\nvery much frightened, but not in any way injured.\n\nAfter this we travelled on without any further misadventure till about\none o'clock, when we called a halt, and having drunk a little water,\nnot much, for water was precious, and rested for half an hour, we\nstarted again.\n\nOn, on we went, till at last the east began to blush like the cheek of\na girl. Then there came faint rays of primrose light, that changed\npresently to golden bars, through which the dawn glided out across the\ndesert. The stars grew pale and paler still, till at last they\nvanished; the golden moon waxed wan, and her mountain ridges stood out\nagainst her sickly face like the bones on the cheek of a dying man.\nThen came spear upon spear of light flashing far away across the\nboundless wilderness, piercing and firing the veils of mist, till the\ndesert was draped in a tremulous golden glow, and it was day.\n\nStill we did not halt, though by this time we should have been glad\nenough to do so, for we knew that when once the sun was fully up it\nwould be almost impossible for us to travel. At length, about an hour\nlater, we spied a little pile of boulders rising out of the plain, and\nto this we dragged ourselves. As luck would have it, here we found an\noverhanging slab of rock carpeted beneath with smooth sand, which\nafforded a most grateful shelter from the heat. Underneath this we\ncrept, and each of us having drunk some water and eaten a bit of\nbiltong, we lay down and soon were sound asleep.\n\nIt was three o'clock in the afternoon before we woke, to find our\nbearers preparing to return. They had seen enough of the desert\nalready, and no number of knives would have tempted them to come a step\nfarther. So we took a hearty drink, and having emptied our\nwater-bottles, filled them up again from the gourds that they had\nbrought with them, and then watched them depart on their twenty miles'\ntramp home.\n\nAt half-past four we also started. It was lonely and desolate work, for\nwith the exception of a few ostriches there was not a single living\ncreature to be seen on all the vast expanse of sandy plain. Evidently\nit was too dry for game, and with the exception of a deadly-looking\ncobra or two we saw no reptiles. One insect, however, we found\nabundant, and that was the common or house fly. There they came, \"not\nas single spies, but in battalions,\" as I think the Old Testament[1]\nsays somewhere. He is an extraordinary insect is the house fly. Go\nwhere you will you find him, and so it must have been always. I have\nseen him enclosed in amber, which is, I was told, quite half a million\nyears old, looking exactly like his descendant of to-day, and I have\nlittle doubt but that when the last man lies dying on the earth he will\nbe buzzing round--if this event happens to occur in summer--watching\nfor an opportunity to settle on his nose.\n\nAt sunset we halted, waiting for the moon to rise. At last she came up,\nbeautiful and serene as ever, and, with one halt about two o'clock in\nthe morning, we trudged on wearily through the night, till at last the\nwelcome sun put a period to our labours. We drank a little and flung\nourselves down on the sand, thoroughly tired out, and soon were all\nasleep. There was no need to set a watch, for we had nothing to fear\nfrom anybody or anything in that vast untenanted plain. Our only\nenemies were heat, thirst, and flies, but far rather would I have faced\nany danger from man or beast than that awful trinity. This time we were\nnot so lucky as to find a sheltering rock to guard us from the glare of\nthe sun, with the result that about seven o'clock we woke up\nexperiencing the exact sensations one would attribute to a beefsteak on\na gridiron. We were literally being baked through and through. The\nburning sun seemed to be sucking our very blood out of us. We sat up\nand gasped.\n\n\"Phew,\" said I, grabbing at the halo of flies which buzzed cheerfully\nround my head. The heat did not affect _them_.\n\n\"My word!\" said Sir Henry.\n\n\"It is hot!\" echoed Good.\n\nIt was hot, indeed, and there was not a bit of shelter to be found.\nLook where we would there was no rock or tree, nothing but an unending\nglare, rendered dazzling by the heated air that danced over the surface\nof the desert as it dances over a red-hot stove.\n\n\"What is to be done?\" asked Sir Henry; \"we can't stand this for long.\"\n\nWe looked at each other blankly.\n\n\"I have it,\" said Good, \"we must dig a hole, get in it, and cover\nourselves with the karoo bushes.\"\n\nIt did not seem a very promising suggestion, but at least it was better\nthan nothing, so we set to work, and, with the trowel we had brought\nwith us and the help of our hands, in about an hour we succeeded in\ndelving out a patch of ground some ten feet long by twelve wide to the\ndepth of two feet. Then we cut a quantity of low scrub with our\nhunting-knives, and creeping into the hole, pulled it over us all, with\nthe exception of Ventvoegel, on whom, being a Hottentot, the heat had no\nparticular effect. This gave us some slight shelter from the burning\nrays of the sun, but the atmosphere in that amateur grave can be better\nimagined than described. The Black Hole of Calcutta must have been a\nfool to it; indeed, to this moment I do not know how we lived through\nthe day. There we lay panting, and every now and again moistening our\nlips from our scanty supply of water. Had we followed our inclinations\nwe should have finished all we possessed in the first two hours, but we\nwere forced to exercise the most rigid care, for if our water failed us\nwe knew that very soon we must perish miserably.\n\nBut everything has an end, if only you live long enough to see it, and\nsomehow that miserable day wore on towards evening. About three o'clock\nin the afternoon we determined that we could bear it no longer. It\nwould be better to die walking that to be killed slowly by heat and\nthirst in this dreadful hole. So taking each of us a little drink from\nour fast diminishing supply of water, now warmed to about the same\ntemperature as a man's blood, we staggered forward.\n\nWe had then covered some fifty miles of wilderness. If the reader will\nrefer to the rough copy and translation of old da Silvestra's map, he\nwill see that the desert is marked as measuring forty leagues across,\nand the \"pan bad water\" is set down as being about in the middle of it.\nNow forty leagues is one hundred and twenty miles, consequently we\nought at the most to be within twelve or fifteen miles of the water if\nany should really exist.\n\nThrough the afternoon we crept slowly and painfully along, scarcely\ndoing more than a mile and a half in an hour. At sunset we rested\nagain, waiting for the moon, and after drinking a little managed to get\nsome sleep.\n\nBefore we lay down, Umbopa pointed out to us a slight and indistinct\nhillock on the flat surface of the plain about eight miles away. At the\ndistance it looked like an ant-hill, and as I was dropping off to sleep\nI fell to wondering what it could be.\n\nWith the moon we marched again, feeling dreadfully exhausted, and\nsuffering tortures from thirst and prickly heat. Nobody who has not\nfelt it can know what we went through. We walked no longer, we\nstaggered, now and again falling from exhaustion, and being obliged to\ncall a halt every hour or so. We had scarcely energy left in us to\nspeak. Up to this Good had chatted and joked, for he is a merry fellow;\nbut now he had not a joke in him.\n\nAt last, about two o'clock, utterly worn out in body and mind, we came\nto the foot of the queer hill, or sand koppie, which at first sight\nresembled a gigantic ant-heap about a hundred feet high, and covering\nat the base nearly two acres of ground.\n\nHere we halted, and driven to it by our desperate thirst, sucked down\nour last drops of water. We had but half a pint a head, and each of us\ncould have drunk a gallon.\n\nThen we lay down. Just as I was dropping off to sleep I heard Umbopa\nremark to himself in Zulu--\n\n\"If we cannot find water we shall all be dead before the moon rises\nto-morrow.\"\n\nI shuddered, hot as it was. The near prospect of such an awful death is\nnot pleasant, but even the thought of it could not keep me from\nsleeping.\n\n\n[1] Readers must beware of accepting Mr. Quatermain's references as\naccurate, as, it has been found, some are prone to do. Although his\nreading evidently was limited, the impression produced by it upon his\nmind was mixed. Thus to him the Old Testament and Shakespeare were\ninterchangeable authorities.--Editor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nWATER! WATER!\n\nTwo hours later, that is, about four o'clock, I woke up, for so soon as\nthe first heavy demand of bodily fatigue had been satisfied, the\ntorturing thirst from which I was suffering asserted itself. I could\nsleep no more. I had been dreaming that I was bathing in a running\nstream, with green banks and trees upon them, and I awoke to find\nmyself in this arid wilderness, and to remember, as Umbopa had said,\nthat if we did not find water this day we must perish miserably. No\nhuman creature could live long without water in that heat. I sat up and\nrubbed my grimy face with my dry and horny hands, as my lips and\neyelids were stuck together, and it was only after some friction and\nwith an effort that I was able to open them. It was not far from dawn,\nbut there was none of the bright feel of dawn in the air, which was\nthick with a hot murkiness that I cannot describe. The others were\nstill sleeping.\n\nPresently it began to grow light enough to read, so I drew out a little\npocket copy of the \"Ingoldsby Legends\" which I had brought with me, and\nread \"The Jackdaw of Rheims.\" When I got to where\n\n  \"A nice little boy held a golden ewer,\n  Embossed, and filled with water as pure\n  As any that flows between Rheims and Namur,\"\n\nliterally I smacked my cracking lips, or rather tried to smack them.\nThe mere thought of that pure water made me mad. If the Cardinal had\nbeen there with his bell, book, and candle, I would have whipped in and\ndrunk his water up; yes, even if he had filled it already with the suds\nof soap \"worthy of washing the hands of the Pope,\" and I knew that the\nwhole consecrated curse of the Catholic Church should fall upon me for\nso doing. I almost think that I must have been a little light-headed\nwith thirst, weariness and the want of food; for I fell to thinking how\nastonished the Cardinal and his nice little boy and the jackdaw would\nhave looked to see a burnt up, brown-eyed, grizzly-haired little\nelephant hunter suddenly bound between them, put his dirty face into\nthe basin, and swallow every drop of the precious water. The idea\namused me so much that I laughed or rather cackled aloud, which woke\nthe others, and they began to rub _their_ dirty faces and drag _their_\ngummed-up lips and eyelids apart.\n\nAs soon as we were all well awake we began to discuss the situation,\nwhich was serious enough. Not a drop of water was left. We turned the\nbottles upside down, and licked their tops, but it was a failure; they\nwere dry as a bone. Good, who had charge of the flask of brandy, got it\nout and looked at it longingly; but Sir Henry promptly took it away\nfrom him, for to drink raw spirit would only have been to precipitate\nthe end.\n\n\"If we do not find water we shall die,\" he said.\n\n\"If we can trust to the old Dom's map there should be some about,\" I\nsaid; but nobody seemed to derive much satisfaction from this remark.\nIt was so evident that no great faith could be put in the map. Now it\nwas gradually growing light, and as we sat staring blankly at each\nother, I observed the Hottentot Ventvoegel rise and begin to walk about\nwith his eyes on the ground. Presently he stopped short, and uttering a\nguttural exclamation, pointed to the earth.\n\n\"What is it?\" we exclaimed; and rising simultaneously we went to where\nhe was standing staring at the sand.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"it is fresh Springbok spoor; what of it?\"\n\n\"Springbucks do not go far from water,\" he answered in Dutch.\n\n\"No,\" I answered, \"I forgot; and thank God for it.\"\n\nThis little discovery put new life into us; for it is wonderful, when a\nman is in a desperate position, how he catches at the slightest hope,\nand feels almost happy. On a dark night a single star is better than\nnothing.\n\nMeanwhile Ventvoegel was lifting his snub nose, and sniffing the hot air\nfor all the world like an old Impala ram who scents danger. Presently\nhe spoke again.\n\n\"I _smell_ water,\" he said.\n\nThen we felt quite jubilant, for we knew what a wonderful instinct\nthese wild-bred men possess.\n\nJust at that moment the sun came up gloriously, and revealed so grand a\nsight to our astonished eyes that for a moment or two we even forgot\nour thirst.\n\nThere, not more than forty or fifty miles from us, glittering like\nsilver in the early rays of the morning sun, soared Sheba's Breasts;\nand stretching away for hundreds of miles on either side of them ran\nthe great Suliman Berg. Now that, sitting here, I attempt to describe\nthe extraordinary grandeur and beauty of that sight, language seems to\nfail me. I am impotent even before its memory. Straight before us, rose\ntwo enormous mountains, the like of which are not, I believe, to be\nseen in Africa, if indeed there are any other such in the world,\nmeasuring each of them at least fifteen thousand feet in height,\nstanding not more than a dozen miles apart, linked together by a\nprecipitous cliff of rock, and towering in awful white solemnity\nstraight into the sky. These mountains placed thus, like the pillars of\na gigantic gateway, are shaped after the fashion of a woman's breasts,\nand at times the mists and shadows beneath them take the form of a\nrecumbent woman, veiled mysteriously in sleep. Their bases swell gently\nfrom the plain, looking at that distance perfectly round and smooth;\nand upon the top of each is a vast hillock covered with snow, exactly\ncorresponding to the nipple on the female breast. The stretch of cliff\nthat connects them appears to be some thousands of feet in height, and\nperfectly precipitous, and on each flank of them, so far as the eye can\nreach, extent similar lines of cliff, broken only here and there by\nflat table-topped mountains, something like the world-famed one at Cape\nTown; a formation, by the way, that is very common in Africa.\n\nTo describe the comprehensive grandeur of that view is beyond my\npowers. There was something so inexpressibly solemn and overpowering\nabout those huge volcanoes--for doubtless they are extinct\nvolcanoes--that it quite awed us. For a while the morning lights played\nupon the snow and the brown and swelling masses beneath, and then, as\nthough to veil the majestic sight from our curious eyes, strange\nvapours and clouds gathered and increased around the mountains, till\npresently we could only trace their pure and gigantic outlines, showing\nghostlike through the fleecy envelope. Indeed, as we afterwards\ndiscovered, usually they were wrapped in this gauze-like mist, which\ndoubtless accounted for our not having seen them more clearly before.\n\nSheba's Breasts had scarcely vanished into cloud-clad privacy, before\nour thirst--literally a burning question--reasserted itself.\n\nIt was all very well for Ventvoegel to say that he smelt water, but we\ncould see no signs of it, look which way we would. So far as the eye\nmight reach there was nothing but arid sweltering sand and karoo scrub.\nWe walked round the hillock and gazed about anxiously on the other\nside, but it was the same story, not a drop of water could be found;\nthere was no indication of a pan, a pool, or a spring.\n\n\"You are a fool,\" I said angrily to Ventvoegel; \"there is no water.\"\n\nBut still he lifted his ugly snub nose and sniffed.\n\n\"I smell it, Baas,\" he answered; \"it is somewhere in the air.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"no doubt it is in the clouds, and about two months\nhence it will fall and wash our bones.\"\n\nSir Henry stroked his yellow beard thoughtfully. \"Perhaps it is on the\ntop of the hill,\" he suggested.\n\n\"Rot,\" said Good; \"whoever heard of water being found at the top of a\nhill!\"\n\n\"Let us go and look,\" I put in, and hopelessly enough we scrambled up\nthe sandy sides of the hillock, Umbopa leading. Presently he stopped as\nthough he was petrified.\n\n\"_Nanzia manzie_!\" that is, \"Here is water!\" he cried with a loud voice.\n\nWe rushed up to him, and there, sure enough, in a deep cut or\nindentation on the very top of the sand koppie, was an undoubted pool\nof water. How it came to be in such a strange place we did not stop to\ninquire, nor did we hesitate at its black and unpleasant appearance. It\nwas water, or a good imitation of it, and that was enough for us. We\ngave a bound and a rush, and in another second we were all down on our\nstomachs sucking up the uninviting fluid as though it were nectar fit\nfor the gods. Heavens, how we did drink! Then when we had done drinking\nwe tore off our clothes and sat down in the pool, absorbing the\nmoisture through our parched skins. You, Harry, my boy, who have only\nto turn on a couple of taps to summon \"hot\" and \"cold\" from an unseen,\nvasty cistern, can have little idea of the luxury of that muddy wallow\nin brackish tepid water.\n\nAfter a while we rose from it, refreshed indeed, and fell to on our\n\"biltong,\" of which we had scarcely been able to touch a mouthful for\ntwenty-four hours, and ate our fill. Then we smoked a pipe, and lay\ndown by the side of that blessed pool, under the overhanging shadow of\nits bank, and slept till noon.\n\nAll that day we rested there by the water, thanking our stars that we\nhad been lucky enough to find it, bad as it was, and not forgetting to\nrender a due share of gratitude to the shade of the long-departed da\nSilvestra, who had set its position down so accurately on the tail of\nhis shirt. The wonderful thing to us was that the pan should have\nlasted so long, and the only way in which I can account for this is on\nthe supposition that it is fed by some spring deep down in the sand.\n\nHaving filled both ourselves and our water-bottles as full as possible,\nin far better spirits we started off again with the moon. That night we\ncovered nearly five-and-twenty miles; but, needless to say, found no\nmore water, though we were lucky enough the following day to get a\nlittle shade behind some ant-heaps. When the sun rose, and, for awhile,\ncleared away the mysterious mists, Suliman's Berg with the two majestic\nBreasts, now only about twenty miles off, seemed to be towering right\nabove us, and looked grander than ever. At the approach of evening we\nmarched again, and, to cut a long story short, by daylight next morning\nfound ourselves upon the lowest slopes of Sheba's left breast, for\nwhich we had been steadily steering. By this time our water was\nexhausted once more, and we were suffering severely from thirst, nor\nindeed could we see any chance of relieving it till we reached the snow\nline far, far above us. After resting an hour or two, driven to it by\nour torturing thirst, we went on, toiling painfully in the burning heat\nup the lava slopes, for we found that the huge base of the mountain was\ncomposed entirely of lava beds belched from the bowels of the earth in\nsome far past age.\n\nBy eleven o'clock we were utterly exhausted, and, generally speaking,\nin a very bad state indeed. The lava clinker, over which we must drag\nourselves, though smooth compared with some clinker I have heard of,\nsuch as that on the Island of Ascension, for instance, was yet rough\nenough to make our feet very sore, and this, together with our other\nmiseries, had pretty well finished us. A few hundred yards above us\nwere some large lumps of lava, and towards these we steered with the\nintention of lying down beneath their shade. We reached them, and to\nour surprise, so far as we had a capacity for surprise left in us, on a\nlittle plateau or ridge close by we saw that the clinker was covered\nwith a dense green growth. Evidently soil formed of decomposed lava had\nrested there, and in due course had become the receptacle of seeds\ndeposited by birds. But we did not take much further interest in the\ngreen growth, for one cannot live on grass like Nebuchadnezzar. That\nrequires a special dispensation of Providence and peculiar digestive\norgans.\n\nSo we sat down under the rocks and groaned, and for one I wished\nheartily that we had never started on this fool's errand. As we were\nsitting there I saw Umbopa get up and hobble towards the patch of\ngreen, and a few minutes afterwards, to my great astonishment, I\nperceived that usually very dignified individual dancing and shouting\nlike a maniac, and waving something green. Off we all scrambled towards\nhim as fast as our wearied limbs would carry us, hoping that he had\nfound water.\n\n\"What is it, Umbopa, son of a fool?\" I shouted in Zulu.\n\n\"It is food and water, Macumazahn,\" and again he waved the green thing.\n\nThen I saw what he had found. It was a melon. We had hit upon a patch\nof wild melons, thousands of them, and dead ripe.\n\n\"Melons!\" I yelled to Good, who was next me; and in another minute his\nfalse teeth were fixed in one of them.\n\nI think we ate about six each before we had done, and poor fruit as\nthey were, I doubt if I ever thought anything nicer.\n\nBut melons are not very nutritious, and when we had satisfied our\nthirst with their pulpy substance, and put a stock to cool by the\nsimple process of cutting them in two and setting them end on in the\nhot sun to grow cold by evaporation, we began to feel exceedingly\nhungry. We had still some biltong left, but our stomachs turned from\nbiltong, and besides, we were obliged to be very sparing of it, for we\ncould not say when we should find more food. Just at this moment a\nlucky thing chanced. Looking across the desert I saw a flock of about\nten large birds flying straight towards us.\n\n\"_Skit, Baas, skit!_\" \"Shoot, master, shoot!\" whispered the Hottentot,\nthrowing himself on his face, an example which we all followed.\n\nThen I saw that the birds were a flock of _pauw_ or bustards, and that\nthey would pass within fifty yards of my head. Taking one of the\nrepeating Winchesters, I waited till they were nearly over us, and then\njumped to my feet. On seeing me the _pauw_ bunched up together, as I\nexpected that they would, and I fired two shots straight into the thick\nof them, and, as luck would have it, brought one down, a fine fellow,\nthat weighed about twenty pounds. In half an hour we had a fire made of\ndry melon stalks, and he was toasting over it, and we made such a feed\nas we had not tasted for a week. We ate that _pauw_; nothing was left\nof him but his leg-bones and his beak, and we felt not a little the\nbetter afterwards.\n\nThat night we went on again with the moon, carrying as many melons as\nwe could with us. As we ascended we found the air grew cooler and\ncooler, which was a great relief to us, and at dawn, so far as we could\njudge, we were not more than about a dozen miles from the snow line.\nHere we discovered more melons, and so had no longer any anxiety about\nwater, for we knew that we should soon get plenty of snow. But the\nascent had now become very precipitous, and we made but slow progress,\nnot more than a mile an hour. Also that night we ate our last morsel of\nbiltong. As yet, with the exception of the _pauw_, we had seen no\nliving thing on the mountain, nor had we come across a single spring or\nstream of water, which struck us as very odd, considering the expanse\nof snow above us, which must, we thought, melt sometimes. But as we\nafterwards discovered, owing to a cause which it is quite beyond my\npower to explain, all the streams flowed down upon the north side of\nthe mountains.\n\nNow we began to grow very anxious about food. We had escaped death by\nthirst, but it seemed probable that it was only to die of hunger. The\nevents of the next three miserable days are best described by copying\nthe entries made at the time in my note-book.\n\n\"21st May.--Started 11 a.m., finding the atmosphere quite cold enough\nto travel by day, and carrying some water-melons with us. Struggled on\nall day, but found no more melons, having evidently passed out of their\ndistrict. Saw no game of any sort. Halted for the night at sundown,\nhaving had no food for many hours. Suffered much during the night from\ncold.\n\n\"22nd.--Started at sunrise again, feeling very faint and weak. Only\nmade about five miles all day; found some patches of snow, of which we\nate, but nothing else. Camped at night under the edge of a great\nplateau. Cold bitter. Drank a little brandy each, and huddled ourselves\ntogether, each wrapped up in his blanket, to keep ourselves alive. Are\nnow suffering frightfully from starvation and weariness. Thought that\nVentvoegel would have died during the night.\n\n\"23rd.--Struggled forward once more as soon as the sun was well up, and\nhad thawed our limbs a little. We are now in a dreadful plight, and I\nfear that unless we get food this will be our last day's journey. But\nlittle brandy left. Good, Sir Henry, and Umbopa bear up wonderfully,\nbut Ventvoegel is in a very bad way. Like most Hottentots, he cannot\nstand cold. Pangs of hunger not so bad, but have a sort of numb feeling\nabout the stomach. Others say the same. We are now on a level with the\nprecipitous chain, or wall of lava, linking the two Breasts, and the\nview is glorious. Behind us the glowing desert rolls away to the\nhorizon, and before us lie mile upon mile of smooth hard snow almost\nlevel, but swelling gently upwards, out of the centre of which the\nnipple of the mountain, that appears to be some miles in circumference,\nrises about four thousand feet into the sky. Not a living thing is to\nbe seen. God help us; I fear that our time has come.\"\n\nAnd now I will drop the journal, partly because it is not very\ninteresting reading; also what follows requires telling rather more\nfully.\n\nAll that day--the 23rd May--we struggled slowly up the incline of snow,\nlying down from time to time to rest. A strange gaunt crew we must have\nlooked, while, laden as we were, we dragged our weary feet over the\ndazzling plain, glaring round us with hungry eyes. Not that there was\nmuch use in glaring, for we could see nothing to eat. We did not\naccomplish more than seven miles that day. Just before sunset we found\nourselves exactly under the nipple of Sheba's left Breast, which\ntowered thousands of feet into the air, a vast smooth hillock of frozen\nsnow. Weak as we were, we could not but appreciate the wonderful scene,\nmade even more splendid by the flying rays of light from the setting\nsun, which here and there stained the snow blood-red, and crowned the\ngreat dome above us with a diadem of glory.\n\n\"I say,\" gasped Good, presently, \"we ought to be somewhere near that\ncave the old gentleman wrote about.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"if there is a cave.\"\n\n\"Come, Quatermain,\" groaned Sir Henry, \"don't talk like that; I have\nevery faith in the Dom; remember the water! We shall find the place\nsoon.\"\n\n\"If we don't find it before dark we are dead men, that is all about\nit,\" was my consolatory reply.\n\nFor the next ten minutes we trudged in silence, when suddenly Umbopa,\nwho was marching along beside me, wrapped in his blanket, and with a\nleather belt strapped so tightly round his stomach, to \"make his hunger\nsmall,\" as he said, that his waist looked like a girl's, caught me by\nthe arm.\n\n\"Look!\" he said, pointing towards the springing slope of the nipple.\n\nI followed his glance, and some two hundred yards from us perceived\nwhat appeared to be a hole in the snow.\n\n\"It is the cave,\" said Umbopa.\n\nWe made the best of our way to the spot, and found sure enough that the\nhole was the mouth of a cavern, no doubt the same as that of which da\nSilvestra wrote. We were not too soon, for just as we reached shelter\nthe sun went down with startling rapidity, leaving the world nearly\ndark, for in these latitudes there is but little twilight. So we crept\ninto the cave, which did not appear to be very big, and huddling\nourselves together for warmth, swallowed what remained of our\nbrandy--barely a mouthful each--and tried to forget our miseries in\nsleep. But the cold was too intense to allow us to do so, for I am\nconvinced that at this great altitude the thermometer cannot have\nmarked less than fourteen or fifteen degrees below freezing point. What\nsuch a temperature meant to us, enervated as we were by hardship, want\nof food, and the great heat of the desert, the reader may imagine\nbetter than I can describe. Suffice it to say that it was something as\nnear death from exposure as I have ever felt. There we sat hour after\nhour through the still and bitter night, feeling the frost wander round\nand nip us now in the finger, now in the foot, now in the face. In vain\ndid we huddle up closer and closer; there was no warmth in our\nmiserable starved carcases. Sometimes one of us would drop into an\nuneasy slumber for a few minutes, but we could not sleep much, and\nperhaps this was fortunate, for if we had I doubt if we should have\never woke again. Indeed, I believe that it was only by force of will\nthat we kept ourselves alive at all.\n\nNot very long before dawn I heard the Hottentot Ventvoegel, whose teeth\nhad been chattering all night like castanets, give a deep sigh. Then\nhis teeth stopped chattering. I did not think anything of it at the\ntime, concluding that he had gone to sleep. His back was resting\nagainst mine, and it seemed to grow colder and colder, till at last it\nfelt like ice.\n\nAt length the air began to grow grey with light, then golden arrows\nsped across the snow, and at last the glorious sun peeped above the\nlava wall and looked in upon our half-frozen forms. Also it looked upon\nVentvoegel, sitting there amongst us, _stone dead_. No wonder his back\nfelt cold, poor fellow. He had died when I heard him sigh, and was now\nfrozen almost stiff. Shocked beyond measure, we dragged ourselves from\nthe corpse--how strange is that horror we mortals have of the\ncompanionship of a dead body--and left it sitting there, its arms\nclasped about its knees.\n\nBy this time the sunlight was pouring its cold rays, for here they were\ncold, straight into the mouth of the cave. Suddenly I heard an\nexclamation of fear from someone, and turned my head.\n\nAnd this is what I saw: Sitting at the end of the cavern--it was not\nmore than twenty feet long--was another form, of which the head rested\non its chest and the long arms hung down. I stared at it, and saw that\nthis too was a _dead man_, and, what was more, a white man.\n\nThe others saw also, and the sight proved too much for our shattered\nnerves. One and all we scrambled out of the cave as fast as our\nhalf-frozen limbs would carry us.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nSOLOMON'S ROAD\n\nOutside the cavern we halted, feeling rather foolish.\n\n\"I am going back,\" said Sir Henry.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Good.\n\n\"Because it has struck me that--what we saw--may be my brother.\"\n\nThis was a new idea, and we re-entered the place to put it to the\nproof. After the bright light outside, our eyes, weak as they were with\nstaring at the snow, could not pierce the gloom of the cave for a\nwhile. Presently, however, they grew accustomed to the semi-darkness,\nand we advanced towards the dead man.\n\nSir Henry knelt down and peered into his face.\n\n\"Thank God,\" he said, with a sigh of relief, \"it is _not_ my brother.\"\n\nThen I drew near and looked. The body was that of a tall man in middle\nlife with aquiline features, grizzled hair, and a long black moustache.\nThe skin was perfectly yellow, and stretched tightly over the bones.\nIts clothing, with the exception of what seemed to be the remains of a\nwoollen pair of hose, had been removed, leaving the skeleton-like frame\nnaked. Round the neck of the corpse, which was frozen perfectly stiff,\nhung a yellow ivory crucifix.\n\n\"Who on earth can it be?\" said I.\n\n\"Can't you guess?\" asked Good.\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"Why, the old Dom, Jose da Silvestra, of course--who else?\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" I gasped; \"he died three hundred years ago.\"\n\n\"And what is there to prevent him from lasting for three thousand years\nin this atmosphere, I should like to know?\" asked Good. \"If only the\ntemperature is sufficiently low, flesh and blood will keep fresh as New\nZealand mutton for ever, and Heaven knows it is cold enough here. The\nsun never gets in here; no animal comes here to tear or destroy. No\ndoubt his slave, of whom he speaks on the writing, took off his clothes\nand left him. He could not have buried him alone. Look!\" he went on,\nstooping down to pick up a queerly-shaped bone scraped at the end into\na sharp point, \"here is the 'cleft bone' that Silvestra used to draw\nthe map with.\"\n\nWe gazed for a moment astonished, forgetting our own miseries in this\nextraordinary and, as it seemed to us, semi-miraculous sight.\n\n\"Ay,\" said Sir Henry, \"and this is where he got his ink from,\" and he\npointed to a small wound on the Dom's left arm. \"Did ever man see such\na thing before?\"\n\nThere was no longer any doubt about the matter, which for my own part I\nconfess perfectly appalled me. There he sat, the dead man, whose\ndirections, written some ten generations ago, had led us to this spot.\nHere in my own hand was the rude pen with which he had written them,\nand about his neck hung the crucifix that his dying lips had kissed.\nGazing at him, my imagination could reconstruct the last scene of the\ndrama, the traveller dying of cold and starvation, yet striving to\nconvey to the world the great secret which he had discovered:--the\nawful loneliness of his death, of which the evidence sat before us. It\neven seemed to me that I could trace in his strongly-marked features a\nlikeness to those of my poor friend Silvestre his descendant, who had\ndied twenty years before in my arms, but perhaps that was fancy. At any\nrate, there he sat, a sad memento of the fate that so often overtakes\nthose who would penetrate into the unknown; and there doubtless he will\nstill sit, crowned with the dread majesty of death, for centuries yet\nunborn, to startle the eyes of wanderers like ourselves, if ever any\nsuch should come again to invade his loneliness. The thing overpowered\nus, already almost perished as we were with cold and hunger.\n\n\"Let us go,\" said Sir Henry in a low voice; \"stay, we will give him a\ncompanion,\" and lifting up the dead body of the Hottentot Ventvoegel, he\nplaced it near to that of the old Dom. Then he stooped, and with a jerk\nbroke the rotten string of the crucifix which hung round da Silvestra's\nneck, for his fingers were too cold to attempt to unfasten it. I\nbelieve that he has it still. I took the bone pen, and it is before me\nas I write--sometimes I use it to sign my name.\n\nThen leaving these two, the proud white man of a past age, and the poor\nHottentot, to keep their eternal vigil in the midst of the eternal\nsnows, we crept out of the cave into the welcome sunshine and resumed\nour path, wondering in our hearts how many hours it would be before we\nwere even as they are.\n\nWhen we had walked about half a mile we came to the edge of the\nplateau, for the nipple of the mountain does not rise out of its exact\ncentre, though from the desert side it had seemed to do so. What lay\nbelow us we could not see, for the landscape was wreathed in billows of\nmorning fog. Presently, however, the higher layers of mist cleared a\nlittle, and revealed, at the end of a long slope of snow, a patch of\ngreen grass, some five hundred yards beneath us, through which a stream\nwas running. Nor was this all. By the stream, basking in the bright\nsun, stood and lay a group of from ten to fifteen _large antelopes_--at\nthat distance we could not see of what species.\n\nThe sight filled us with an unreasoning joy. If only we could get it,\nthere was food in plenty. But the question was how to do so. The beasts\nwere fully six hundred yards off, a very long shot, and one not to be\ndepended on when our lives hung on the results.\n\nRapidly we discussed the advisability of trying to stalk the game, but\nin the end dismissed it reluctantly. To begin with, the wind was not\nfavourable, and further, we must certainly be perceived, however\ncareful we were, against the blinding background of snow, which we\nshould be obliged to traverse.\n\n\"Well, we must have a try from where we are,\" said Sir Henry. \"Which\nshall it be, Quatermain, the repeating rifles or the expresses?\"\n\nHere again was a question. The Winchester repeaters--of which we had\ntwo, Umbopa carrying poor Ventvoegel's as well as his own--were sighted\nup to a thousand yards, whereas the expresses were only sighted to\nthree hundred and fifty, beyond which distance shooting with them was\nmore or less guess-work. On the other hand, if they did hit, the\nexpress bullets, being \"expanding,\" were much more likely to bring the\ngame down. It was a knotty point, but I made up my mind that we must\nrisk it and use the expresses.\n\n\"Let each of us take the buck opposite to him. Aim well at the point of\nthe shoulder and high up,\" said I; \"and Umbopa, do you give the word,\nso that we may all fire together.\"\n\nThen came a pause, each of us aiming his level best, as indeed a man is\nlikely to do when he knows that life itself depends upon the shot.\n\n\"Fire,\" said Umbopa in Zulu, and at almost the same instant the three\nrifles rang out loudly; three clouds of smoke hung for a moment before\nus, and a hundred echoes went flying over the silent snow. Presently\nthe smoke cleared, and revealed--oh, joy!--a great buck lying on its\nback and kicking furiously in its death agony. We gave a yell of\ntriumph--we were saved--we should not starve. Weak as we were, we\nrushed down the intervening slope of snow, and in ten minutes from the\ntime of shooting, that animal's heart and liver were lying before us.\nBut now a new difficulty arose, we had no fuel, and therefore could\nmake no fire to cook them. We gazed at each other in dismay.\n\n\"Starving men should not be fanciful,\" said Good; \"we must eat raw\nmeat.\"\n\nThere was no other way out of the dilemma, and our gnawing hunger made\nthe proposition less distasteful than it would otherwise have been. So\nwe took the heart and liver and buried them for a few minutes in a\npatch of snow to cool them. Then we washed them in the ice-cold water\nof the stream, and lastly ate them greedily. It sounds horrible enough,\nbut honestly, I never tasted anything so good as that raw meat. In a\nquarter of an hour we were changed men. Our life and vigour came back\nto us, our feeble pulses grew strong again, and the blood went coursing\nthrough our veins. But mindful of the results of over-feeding on\nstarved stomachs, we were careful not to eat too much, stopping whilst\nwe were still hungry.\n\n\"Thank Heaven!\" said Sir Henry; \"that brute has saved our lives. What\nis it, Quatermain?\"\n\nI rose and went to look at the antelope, for I was not certain. It was\nabout the size of a donkey, with large curved horns. I had never seen\none like it before; the species was new to me. It was brown in colour,\nwith faint red stripes, and grew a thick coat. I afterwards discovered\nthat the natives of that wonderful country call these bucks \"_inco_.\"\nThey are very rare, and only found at a great altitude where no other\ngame will live. This animal was fairly hit high up in the shoulder,\nthough whose bullet brought it down we could not, of course, discover.\nI believe that Good, mindful of his marvellous shot at the giraffe,\nsecretly set it down to his own prowess, and we did not contradict him.\n\nWe had been so busy satisfying our hunger that hitherto we had not\nfound time to look about us. But now, having set Umbopa to cut off as\nmuch of the best meat as we were likely to be able to carry, we began\nto inspect our surroundings. The mist had cleared away, for it was\neight o'clock, and the sun had sucked it up, so we were able to take in\nall the country before us at a glance. I know not how to describe the\nglorious panorama which unfolded itself to our gaze. I have never seen\nanything like it before, nor shall, I suppose, again.\n\nBehind and over us towered Sheba's snowy Breasts, and below, some five\nthousand feet beneath where we stood, lay league on league of the most\nlovely champaign country. Here were dense patches of lofty forest,\nthere a great river wound its silvery way. To the left stretched a vast\nexpanse of rich, undulating veld or grass land, whereon we could just\nmake out countless herds of game or cattle, at that distance we could\nnot tell which. This expanse appeared to be ringed in by a wall of\ndistant mountains. To the right the country was more or less\nmountainous; that is, solitary hills stood up from its level, with\nstretches of cultivated land between, amongst which we could see groups\nof dome-shaped huts. The landscape lay before us as a map, wherein\nrivers flashed like silver snakes, and Alp-like peaks crowned with\nwildly twisted snow wreaths rose in grandeur, whilst over all was the\nglad sunlight and the breath of Nature's happy life.\n\nTwo curious things struck us as we gazed. First, that the country\nbefore us must lie at least three thousand feet higher than the desert\nwe had crossed, and secondly, that all the rivers flowed from south to\nnorth. As we had painful reason to know, there was no water upon the\nsouthern side of the vast range on which we stood, but on the northern\nface were many streams, most of which appeared to unite with the great\nriver we could see winding away farther than our eyes could follow.\n\nWe sat down for a while and gazed in silence at this wonderful view.\nPresently Sir Henry spoke.\n\n\"Isn't there something on the map about Solomon's Great Road?\" he said.\n\nI nodded, for I was still gazing out over the far country.\n\n\"Well, look; there it is!\" and he pointed a little to our right.\n\nGood and I looked accordingly, and there, winding away towards the\nplain, was what appeared to be a wide turnpike road. We had not seen it\nat first because, on reaching the plain, it turned behind some broken\ncountry. We did not say anything, at least, not much; we were beginning\nto lose the sense of wonder. Somehow it did not seem particularly\nunnatural that we should find a sort of Roman road in this strange\nland. We accepted the fact, that was all.\n\n\"Well,\" said Good, \"it must be quite near us if we cut off to the\nright. Hadn't we better be making a start?\"\n\nThis was sound advice, and so soon as we had washed our faces and hands\nin the stream we acted on it. For a mile or more we made our way over\nboulders and across patches of snow, till suddenly, on reaching the top\nof the little rise, we found the road at our feet. It was a splendid\nroad cut out of the solid rock, at least fifty feet wide, and\napparently well kept; though the odd thing was that it seemed to begin\nthere. We walked down and stood on it, but one single hundred paces\nbehind us, in the direction of Sheba's Breasts, it vanished, the entire\nsurface of the mountain being strewn with boulders interspersed with\npatches of snow.\n\n\"What do you make of this, Quatermain?\" asked Sir Henry.\n\nI shook my head, I could make nothing of the thing.\n\n\"I have it!\" said Good; \"the road no doubt ran right over the range and\nacross the desert on the other side, but the sand there has covered it\nup, and above us it has been obliterated by some volcanic eruption of\nmolten lava.\"\n\nThis seemed a good suggestion; at any rate, we accepted it, and\nproceeded down the mountain. It proved a very different business\ntravelling along down hill on that magnificent pathway with full\nstomachs from what it was travelling uphill over the snow quite starved\nand almost frozen. Indeed, had it not been for melancholy recollections\nof poor Ventvoegel's sad fate, and of that grim cave where he kept\ncompany with the old Dom, we should have felt positively cheerful,\nnotwithstanding the sense of unknown dangers before us. Every mile we\nwalked the atmosphere grew softer and balmier, and the country before\nus shone with a yet more luminous beauty. As for the road itself, I\nnever saw such an engineering work, though Sir Henry said that the\ngreat road over the St. Gothard in Switzerland is very similar. No\ndifficulty had been too great for the Old World engineer who laid it\nout. At one place we came to a ravine three hundred feet broad and at\nleast a hundred feet deep. This vast gulf was actually filled in with\nhuge blocks of dressed stone, having arches pierced through them at the\nbottom for a waterway, over which the road went on sublimely. At\nanother place it was cut in zigzags out of the side of a precipice five\nhundred feet deep, and in a third it tunnelled through the base of an\nintervening ridge, a space of thirty yards or more.\n\nHere we noticed that the sides of the tunnel were covered with quaint\nsculptures, mostly of mailed figures driving in chariots. One, which\nwas exceedingly beautiful, represented a whole battle scene with a\nconvoy of captives being marched off in the distance.\n\n\"Well,\" said Sir Henry, after inspecting this ancient work of art, \"it\nis very well to call this Solomon's Road, but my humble opinion is that\nthe Egyptians had been here before Solomon's people ever set a foot on\nit. If this isn't Egyptian or Phoenician handiwork, I must say that it\nis very like it.\"\n\nBy midday we had advanced sufficiently down the mountain to search the\nregion where wood was to be met with. First we came to scattered bushes\nwhich grew more and more frequent, till at last we found the road\nwinding through a vast grove of silver trees similar to those which are\nto be seen on the slopes of Table Mountain at Cape Town. I had never\nbefore met with them in all my wanderings, except at the Cape, and\ntheir appearance here astonished me greatly.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Good, surveying these shining-leaved trees with evident\nenthusiasm, \"here is lots of wood, let us stop and cook some dinner; I\nhave about digested that raw heart.\"\n\nNobody objected to this, so leaving the road we made our way to a\nstream which was babbling away not far off, and soon had a goodly fire\nof dry boughs blazing. Cutting off some substantial hunks from the\nflesh of the _inco_ which we had brought with us, we proceeded to toast\nthem on the end of sharp sticks, as one sees the Kafirs do, and ate\nthem with relish. After filling ourselves, we lit our pipes and gave\nourselves up to enjoyment that, compared with the hardships we had\nrecently undergone, seemed almost heavenly.\n\nThe brook, of which the banks were clothed with dense masses of a\ngigantic species of maidenhair fern interspersed with feathery tufts of\nwild asparagus, sung merrily at our side, the soft air murmured through\nthe leaves of the silver trees, doves cooed around, and bright-winged\nbirds flashed like living gems from bough to bough. It was a Paradise.\n\nThe magic of the place combined with an overwhelming sense of dangers\nleft behind, and of the promised land reached at last, seemed to charm\nus into silence. Sir Henry and Umbopa sat conversing in a mixture of\nbroken English and Kitchen Zulu in a low voice, but earnestly enough,\nand I lay, with my eyes half shut, upon that fragrant bed of fern and\nwatched them.\n\nPresently I missed Good, and I looked to see what had become of him.\nSoon I observed him sitting by the bank of the stream, in which he had\nbeen bathing. He had nothing on but his flannel shirt, and his natural\nhabits of extreme neatness having reasserted themselves, he was\nactively employed in making a most elaborate toilet. He had washed his\ngutta-percha collar, had thoroughly shaken out his trousers, coat and\nwaistcoat, and was now folding them up neatly till he was ready to put\nthem on, shaking his head sadly as he scanned the numerous rents and\ntears in them, which naturally had resulted from our frightful journey.\nThen he took his boots, scrubbed them with a handful of fern, and\nfinally rubbed them over with a piece of fat, which he had carefully\nsaved from the _inco_ meat, till they looked, comparatively speaking,\nrespectable. Having inspected them judiciously through his eye-glass,\nhe put the boots on and began a fresh operation. From a little bag that\nhe carried he produced a pocket-comb in which was fixed a tiny\nlooking-glass, and in this he surveyed himself. Apparently he was not\nsatisfied, for he proceeded to do his hair with great care. Then came a\npause whilst he again contemplated the effect; still it was not\nsatisfactory. He felt his chin, on which the accumulated scrub of a ten\ndays' beard was flourishing.\n\n\"Surely,\" thought I, \"he is not going to try to shave.\" But so it was.\nTaking the piece of fat with which he had greased his boots, Good\nwashed it thoroughly in the stream. Then diving again into the bag he\nbrought out a little pocket razor with a guard to it, such as are\nbought by people who are afraid of cutting themselves, or by those\nabout to undertake a sea voyage. Then he rubbed his face and chin\nvigorously with the fat and began. Evidently it proved a painful\nprocess, for he groaned very much over it, and I was convulsed with\ninward laughter as I watched him struggling with that stubbly beard. It\nseemed so very odd that a man should take the trouble to shave himself\nwith a piece of fat in such a place and in our circumstances. At last\nhe succeeded in getting the hair off the right side of his face and\nchin, when suddenly I, who was watching, became conscious of a flash of\nlight that passed just by his head.\n\nGood sprang up with a profane exclamation (if it had not been a safety\nrazor he would certainly have cut his throat), and so did I, without\nthe exclamation, and this was what I saw. Standing not more than twenty\npaces from where I was, and ten from Good, were a group of men. They\nwere very tall and copper-coloured, and some of them wore great plumes\nof black feathers and short cloaks of leopard skins; this was all I\nnoticed at the moment. In front of them stood a youth of about\nseventeen, his hand still raised and his body bent forward in the\nattitude of a Grecian statue of a spear-thrower. Evidently the flash of\nlight had been caused by a weapon which he had hurled.\n\nAs I looked an old soldier-like man stepped forward out of the group,\nand catching the youth by the arm said something to him. Then they\nadvanced upon us.\n\nSir Henry, Good, and Umbopa by this time had seized their rifles and\nlifted them threateningly. The party of natives still came on. It\nstruck me that they could not know what rifles were, or they would not\nhave treated them with such contempt.\n\n\"Put down your guns!\" I halloed to the others, seeing that our only\nchance of safety lay in conciliation. They obeyed, and walking to the\nfront I addressed the elderly man who had checked the youth.\n\n\"Greeting,\" I said in Zulu, not knowing what language to use. To my\nsurprise I was understood.\n\n\"Greeting,\" answered the old man, not, indeed, in the same tongue, but\nin a dialect so closely allied to it that neither Umbopa nor myself had\nany difficulty in understanding him. Indeed, as we afterwards found\nout, the language spoken by this people is an old-fashioned form of the\nZulu tongue, bearing about the same relationship to it that the English\nof Chaucer does to the English of the nineteenth century.\n\n\"Whence come you?\" he went on, \"who are you? and why are the faces of\nthree of you white, and the face of the fourth as the face of our\nmother's sons?\" and he pointed to Umbopa. I looked at Umbopa as he said\nit, and it flashed across me that he was right. The face of Umbopa was\nlike the faces of the men before me, and so was his great form like\ntheir forms. But I had not time to reflect on this coincidence.\n\n\"We are strangers, and come in peace,\" I answered, speaking very\nslowly, so that he might understand me, \"and this man is our servant.\"\n\n\"You lie,\" he answered; \"no strangers can cross the mountains where all\nthings perish. But what do your lies matter?--if ye are strangers then\nye must die, for no strangers may live in the land of the Kukuanas. It\nis the king's law. Prepare then to die, O strangers!\"\n\nI was slightly staggered at this, more especially as I saw the hands of\nsome of the men steal down to their sides, where hung on each what\nlooked to me like a large and heavy knife.\n\n\"What does that beggar say?\" asked Good.\n\n\"He says we are going to be killed,\" I answered grimly.\n\n\"Oh, Lord!\" groaned Good; and, as was his way when perplexed, he put\nhis hand to his false teeth, dragging the top set down and allowing\nthem to fly back to his jaw with a snap. It was a most fortunate move,\nfor next second the dignified crowd of Kukuanas uttered a simultaneous\nyell of horror, and bolted back some yards.\n\n\"What's up?\" said I.\n\n\"It's his teeth,\" whispered Sir Henry excitedly. \"He moved them. Take\nthem out, Good, take them out!\"\n\nHe obeyed, slipping the set into the sleeve of his flannel shirt.\n\nIn another second curiosity had overcome fear, and the men advanced\nslowly. Apparently they had now forgotten their amiable intention of\nkilling us.\n\n\"How is it, O strangers,\" asked the old man solemnly, \"that this fat\nman (pointing to Good, who was clad in nothing but boots and a flannel\nshirt, and had only half finished his shaving), whose body is clothed,\nand whose legs are bare, who grows hair on one side of his sickly face\nand not on the other, and who wears one shining and transparent\neye--how is it, I ask, that he has teeth which move of themselves,\ncoming away from the jaws and returning of their own will?\"\n\n\"Open your mouth,\" I said to Good, who promptly curled up his lips and\ngrinned at the old gentleman like an angry dog, revealing to his\nastonished gaze two thin red lines of gum as utterly innocent of\nivories as a new-born elephant. The audience gasped.\n\n\"Where are his teeth?\" they shouted; \"with our eyes we saw them.\"\n\nTurning his head slowly and with a gesture of ineffable contempt, Good\nswept his hand across his mouth. Then he grinned again, and lo, there\nwere two rows of lovely teeth.\n\nNow the young man who had flung the knife threw himself down on the\ngrass and gave vent to a prolonged howl of terror; and as for the old\ngentleman, his knees knocked together with fear.\n\n\"I see that ye are spirits,\" he said falteringly; \"did ever man born of\nwoman have hair on one side of his face and not on the other, or a\nround and transparent eye, or teeth which moved and melted away and\ngrew again? Pardon us, O my lords.\"\n\nHere was luck indeed, and, needless to say, I jumped at the chance.\n\n\"It is granted,\" I said with an imperial smile. \"Nay, ye shall know the\ntruth. We come from another world, though we are men such as ye; we\ncome,\" I went on, \"from the biggest star that shines at night.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" groaned the chorus of astonished aborigines.\n\n\"Yes,\" I went on, \"we do, indeed\"; and again I smiled benignly, as I\nuttered that amazing lie. \"We come to stay with you a little while, and\nto bless you by our sojourn. Ye will see, O friends, that I have\nprepared myself for this visit by the learning of your language.\"\n\n\"It is so, it is so,\" said the chorus.\n\n\"Only, my lord,\" put in the old gentleman, \"thou hast learnt it very\nbadly.\"\n\nI cast an indignant glance at him, and he quailed.\n\n\"Now friends,\" I continued, \"ye might think that after so long a\njourney we should find it in our hearts to avenge such a reception,\nmayhap to strike cold in death the imperious hand that--that, in\nshort--threw a knife at the head of him whose teeth come and go.\"\n\n\"Spare him, my lords,\" said the old man in supplication; \"he is the\nking's son, and I am his uncle. If anything befalls him his blood will\nbe required at my hands.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is certainly so,\" put in the young man with great emphasis.\n\n\"Ye may perhaps doubt our power to avenge,\" I went on, heedless of this\nby-play. \"Stay, I will show you. Here, thou dog and slave (addressing\nUmbopa in a savage tone), give me the magic tube that speaks\"; and I\ntipped a wink towards my express rifle.\n\nUmbopa rose to the occasion, and with something as nearly resembling a\ngrin as I have ever seen on his dignified face he handed me the gun.\n\n\"It is here, O Lord of Lords,\" he said with a deep obeisance.\n\nNow just before I had asked for the rifle I had perceived a little\n_klipspringer_ antelope standing on a mass of rock about seventy yards\naway, and determined to risk the shot.\n\n\"Ye see that buck,\" I said, pointing the animal out to the party before\nme. \"Tell me, is it possible for man born of woman to kill it from here\nwith a noise?\"\n\n\"It is not possible, my lord,\" answered the old man.\n\n\"Yet shall I kill it,\" I said quietly.\n\nThe old man smiled. \"That my lord cannot do,\" he answered.\n\nI raised the rifle and covered the buck. It was a small animal, and one\nwhich a man might well be excused for missing, but I knew that it would\nnot do to miss.\n\nI drew a deep breath, and slowly pressed on the trigger. The buck stood\nstill as a stone.\n\n\"Bang! thud!\" The antelope sprang into the air and fell on the rock\ndead as a door nail.\n\nA groan of simultaneous terror burst from the group before us.\n\n\"If you want meat,\" I remarked coolly, \"go fetch that buck.\"\n\nThe old man made a sign, and one of his followers departed, and\npresently returned bearing the _klipspringer_. I noticed with\nsatisfaction that I had hit it fairly behind the shoulder. They\ngathered round the poor creature's body, gazing at the bullet-hole in\nconsternation.\n\n\"Ye see,\" I said, \"I do not speak empty words.\"\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n\"If ye yet doubt our power,\" I went on, \"let one of you go stand upon\nthat rock that I may make him as this buck.\"\n\nNone of them seemed at all inclined to take the hint, till at last the\nking's son spoke.\n\n\"It is well said. Do thou, my uncle, go stand upon the rock. It is but\na buck that the magic has killed. Surely it cannot kill a man.\"\n\nThe old gentleman did not take the suggestion in good part. Indeed, he\nseemed hurt.\n\n\"No! no!\" he ejaculated hastily, \"my old eyes have seen enough. These\nare wizards, indeed. Let us bring them to the king. Yet if any should\nwish a further proof, let _him_ stand upon the rock, that the magic\ntube may speak with him.\"\n\nThere was a most general and hasty expression of dissent.\n\n\"Let not good magic be wasted on our poor bodies,\" said one; \"we are\nsatisfied. All the witchcraft of our people cannot show the like of\nthis.\"\n\n\"It is so,\" remarked the old gentleman, in a tone of intense relief;\n\"without any doubt it is so. Listen, children of the Stars, children of\nthe shining Eye and the movable Teeth, who roar out in thunder, and\nslay from afar. I am Infadoos, son of Kafa, once king of the Kukuana\npeople. This youth is Scragga.\"\n\n\"He nearly scragged me,\" murmured Good.\n\n\"Scragga, son of Twala, the great king--Twala, husband of a thousand\nwives, chief and lord paramount of the Kukuanas, keeper of the great\nRoad, terror of his enemies, student of the Black Arts, leader of a\nhundred thousand warriors, Twala the One-eyed, the Black, the Terrible.\"\n\n\"So,\" said I superciliously, \"lead us then to Twala. We do not talk\nwith low people and underlings.\"\n\n\"It is well, my lords, we will lead you; but the way is long. We are\nhunting three days' journey from the place of the king. But let my\nlords have patience, and we will lead them.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" I said carelessly; \"all time is before us, for we do not\ndie. We are ready, lead on. But Infadoos, and thou Scragga, beware!\nPlay us no monkey tricks, set for us no foxes' snares, for before your\nbrains of mud have thought of them we shall know and avenge. The light\nof the transparent eye of him with the bare legs and the half-haired\nface shall destroy you, and go through your land; his vanishing teeth\nshall affix themselves fast in you and eat you up, you and your wives\nand children; the magic tubes shall argue with you loudly, and make you\nas sieves. Beware!\"\n\nThis magnificent address did not fail of its effect; indeed, it might\nalmost have been spared, so deeply were our friends already impressed\nwith our powers.\n\nThe old man made a deep obeisance, and murmured the words, \"_Koom\nKoom_,\" which I afterwards discovered was their royal salute,\ncorresponding to the _Bayete_ of the Zulus, and turning, addressed his\nfollowers. These at once proceeded to lay hold of all our goods and\nchattels, in order to bear them for us, excepting only the guns, which\nthey would on no account touch. They even seized Good's clothes, that,\nas the reader may remember, were neatly folded up beside him.\n\nHe saw and made a dive for them, and a loud altercation ensued.\n\n\"Let not my lord of the transparent Eye and the melting Teeth touch\nthem,\" said the old man. \"Surely his slave shall carry the things.\"\n\n\"But I want to put 'em on!\" roared Good, in nervous English.\n\nUmbopa translated.\n\n\"Nay, my lord,\" answered Infadoos, \"would my lord cover up his\nbeautiful white legs (although he is so dark Good has a singularly\nwhite skin) from the eyes of his servants? Have we offended my lord\nthat he should do such a thing?\"\n\nHere I nearly exploded with laughing; and meanwhile one of the men\nstarted on with the garments.\n\n\"Damn it!\" roared Good, \"that black villain has got my trousers.\"\n\n\"Look here, Good,\" said Sir Henry; \"you have appeared in this country\nin a certain character, and you must live up to it. It will never do\nfor you to put on trousers again. Henceforth you must exist in a\nflannel shirt, a pair of boots, and an eye-glass.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"and with whiskers on one side of your face and not on\nthe other. If you change any of these things the people will think that\nwe are impostors. I am very sorry for you, but, seriously, you must. If\nonce they begin to suspect us our lives will not be worth a brass\nfarthing.\"\n\n\"Do you really think so?\" said Good gloomily.\n\n\"I do, indeed. Your 'beautiful white legs' and your eye-glass are now\n_the_ features of our party, and as Sir Henry says, you must live up to\nthem. Be thankful that you have got your boots on, and that the air is\nwarm.\"\n\nGood sighed, and said no more, but it took him a fortnight to become\naccustomed to his new and scant attire.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nWE ENTER KUKUANALAND\n\nAll that afternoon we travelled along the magnificent roadway, which\ntrended steadily in a north-westerly direction. Infadoos and Scragga\nwalked with us, but their followers marched about one hundred paces\nahead.\n\n\"Infadoos,\" I said at length, \"who made this road?\"\n\n\"It was made, my lord, of old time, none know how or when, not even the\nwise woman Gagool, who has lived for generations. We are not old enough\nto remember its making. None can fashion such roads now, but the king\nsuffers no grass to grow upon it.\"\n\n\"And whose are the writings on the wall of the caves through which we\nhave passed on the road?\" I asked, referring to the Egyptian-like\nsculptures that we had seen.\n\n\"My lord, the hands that made the road wrote the wonderful writings. We\nknow not who wrote them.\"\n\n\"When did the Kukuana people come into this country?\"\n\n\"My lord, the race came down here like the breath of a storm ten\nthousand thousand moons ago, from the great lands which lie there\nbeyond,\" and he pointed to the north. \"They could travel no further\nbecause of the high mountains which ring in the land, so say the old\nvoices of our fathers that have descended to us the children, and so\nsays Gagool, the wise woman, the smeller out of witches,\" and again he\npointed to the snow-clad peaks. \"The country, too, was good, so they\nsettled here and grew strong and powerful, and now our numbers are like\nthe sea sand, and when Twala the king calls up his regiments their\nplumes cover the plain so far as the eye of man can reach.\"\n\n\"And if the land is walled in with mountains, who is there for the\nregiments to fight with?\"\n\n\"Nay, my lord, the country is open there towards the north, and now and\nagain warriors sweep down upon us in clouds from a land we know not,\nand we slay them. It is the third part of the life of a man since there\nwas a war. Many thousands died in it, but we destroyed those who came\nto eat us up. So since then there has been no war.\"\n\n\"Your warriors must grow weary of resting on their spears, Infadoos.\"\n\n\"My lord, there was one war, just after we destroyed the people that\ncame down upon us, but it was a civil war; dog ate dog.\"\n\n\"How was that?\"\n\n\"My lord the king, my half-brother, had a brother born at the same\nbirth, and of the same woman. It is not our custom, my lord, to suffer\ntwins to live; the weaker must always die. But the mother of the king\nhid away the feebler child, which was born the last, for her heart\nyearned over it, and that child is Twala the king. I am his younger\nbrother, born of another wife.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"My lord, Kafa, our father, died when we came to manhood, and my\nbrother Imotu was made king in his place, and for a space reigned and\nhad a son by his favourite wife. When the babe was three years old,\njust after the great war, during which no man could sow or reap, a\nfamine came upon the land, and the people murmured because of the\nfamine, and looked round like a starved lion for something to rend.\nThen it was that Gagool, the wise and terrible woman, who does not die,\nmade a proclamation to the people, saying, 'The king Imotu is no king.'\nAnd at the time Imotu was sick with a wound, and lay in his kraal not\nable to move.\n\n\"Then Gagool went into a hut and led out Twala, my half-brother, and\ntwin brother to the king, whom she had hidden among the caves and rocks\nsince he was born, and stripping the '_moocha_' (waist-cloth) off his\nloins, showed the people of the Kukuanas the mark of the sacred snake\ncoiled round his middle, wherewith the eldest son of the king is marked\nat birth, and cried out loud, 'Behold your king whom I have saved for\nyou even to this day!'\n\n\"Now the people being mad with hunger, and altogether bereft of reason\nand the knowledge of truth, cried out--'_The king! The king!_' but I\nknew that it was not so, for Imotu my brother was the elder of the\ntwins, and our lawful king. Then just as the tumult was at its height\nImotu the king, though he was very sick, crawled from his hut holding\nhis wife by the hand, and followed by his little son Ignosi--that is,\nby interpretation, the Lightning.\n\n\"'What is this noise?' he asked. 'Why cry ye _The king! The king!_'\n\n\"Then Twala, his twin brother, born of the same woman, and in the same\nhour, ran to him, and taking him by the hair, stabbed him through the\nheart with his knife. And the people being fickle, and ever ready to\nworship the rising sun, clapped their hands and cried, '_Twala is\nking!_ Now we know that Twala is king!'\"\n\n\"And what became of Imotu's wife and her son Ignosi? Did Twala kill\nthem too?\"\n\n\"Nay, my lord. When she saw that her lord was dead the queen seized the\nchild with a cry and ran away. Two days afterward she came to a kraal\nvery hungry, and none would give her milk or food, now that her lord\nthe king was dead, for all men hate the unfortunate. But at nightfall a\nlittle child, a girl, crept out and brought her corn to eat, and she\nblessed the child, and went on towards the mountains with her boy\nbefore the sun rose again, and there she must have perished, for none\nhave seen her since, nor the child Ignosi.\"\n\n\"Then if this child Ignosi had lived he would be the true king of the\nKukuana people?\"\n\n\"That is so, my lord; the sacred snake is round his middle. If he lives\nhe is king; but, alas! he is long dead.\"\n\n\"See, my lord,\" and Infadoos pointed to a vast collection of huts\nsurrounded by a fence, which was in its turn encircled by a great\nditch, that lay on the plain beneath us. \"That is the kraal where the\nwife of Imotu was last seen with the child Ignosi. It is there that we\nshall sleep to-night, if, indeed,\" he added doubtfully, \"my lords sleep\nat all upon this earth.\"\n\n\"When we are among the Kukuanas, my good friend Infadoos, we do as the\nKukuanas do,\" I said majestically, and turned round quickly to address\nGood, who was tramping along sullenly behind, his mind fully occupied\nwith unsatisfactory attempts to prevent his flannel shirt from flapping\nin the evening breeze. To my astonishment I butted into Umbopa, who was\nwalking along immediately behind me, and very evidently had been\nlistening with the greatest interest to my conversation with Infadoos.\nThe expression on his face was most curious, and gave me the idea of a\nman who was struggling with partial success to bring something long ago\nforgotten back into his mind.\n\nAll this while we had been pressing on at a good rate towards the\nundulating plain beneath us. The mountains we had crossed now loomed\nhigh above our heads, and Sheba's Breasts were veiled modestly in\ndiaphanous wreaths of mist. As we went the country grew more and more\nlovely. The vegetation was luxuriant, without being tropical; the sun\nwas bright and warm, but not burning; and a gracious breeze blew softly\nalong the odorous slopes of the mountains. Indeed, this new land was\nlittle less than an earthly paradise; in beauty, in natural wealth, and\nin climate I have never seen its like. The Transvaal is a fine country,\nbut it is nothing to Kukuanaland.\n\nSo soon as we started Infadoos had despatched a runner to warn the\npeople of the kraal, which, by the way, was in his military command, of\nour arrival. This man had departed at an extraordinary speed, which\nInfadoos informed me he would keep up all the way, as running was an\nexercise much practised among his people.\n\nThe result of this message now became apparent. When we arrived within\ntwo miles of the kraal we could see that company after company of men\nwere issuing from its gates and marching towards us.\n\nSir Henry laid his hand upon my arm, and remarked that it looked as\nthough we were going to meet with a warm reception. Something in his\ntone attracted Infadoos' attention.\n\n\"Let not my lords be afraid,\" he said hastily, \"for in my breast there\ndwells no guile. This regiment is one under my command, and comes out\nby my orders to greet you.\"\n\nI nodded easily, though I was not quite easy in my mind.\n\nAbout half a mile from the gates of this kraal is a long stretch of\nrising ground sloping gently upwards from the road, and here the\ncompanies formed. It was a splendid sight to see them, each company\nabout three hundred strong, charging swiftly up the rise, with flashing\nspears and waving plumes, to take their appointed place. By the time we\nreached the slope twelve such companies, or in all three thousand six\nhundred men, had passed out and taken up their positions along the road.\n\nPresently we came to the first company, and were able to gaze in\nastonishment on the most magnificent set of warriors that I have ever\nseen. They were all men of mature age, mostly veterans of about forty,\nand not one of them was under six feet in height, whilst many stood six\nfeet three or four. They wore upon their heads heavy black plumes of\nSakaboola feathers, like those which adorned our guides. About their\nwaists and beneath the right knees were bound circlets of white ox\ntails, while in their left hands they carried round shields measuring\nabout twenty inches across. These shields are very curious. The\nframework is made of an iron plate beaten out thin, over which is\nstretched milk-white ox-hide.\n\nThe weapons that each man bore were simple, but most effective,\nconsisting of a short and very heavy two-edged spear with a wooden\nshaft, the blade being about six inches across at the widest part.\nThese spears are not used for throwing but like the Zulu \"_bangwan_,\"\nor stabbing assegai, are for close quarters only, when the wound\ninflicted by them is terrible. In addition to his _bangwan_ every man\ncarried three large and heavy knives, each knife weighing about two\npounds. One knife was fixed in the ox-tail girdle, and the other two at\nthe back of the round shield. These knives, which are called \"_tollas_\"\nby the Kukuanas, take the place of the throwing assegai of the Zulus.\nThe Kukuana warriors can cast them with great accuracy to a distance of\nfifty yards, and it is their custom on charging to hurl a volley of\nthem at the enemy as they come to close quarters.\n\nEach company remained still as a collection of bronze statues till we\nwere opposite to it, when at a signal given by its commanding officer,\nwho, distinguished by a leopard skin cloak, stood some paces in front,\nevery spear was raised into the air, and from three hundred throats\nsprang forth with a sudden roar the royal salute of \"_Koom_.\" Then, so\nsoon as we had passed, the company formed up behind us and followed us\ntowards the kraal, till at last the whole regiment of the \"Greys\"--so\ncalled from their white shields--the crack corps of the Kukuana people,\nwas marching in our rear with a tread that shook the ground.\n\nAt length, branching off from Solomon's Great Road, we came to the wide\nfosse surrounding the kraal, which is at least a mile round, and fenced\nwith a strong palisade of piles formed of the trunks of trees. At the\ngateway this fosse is spanned by a primitive drawbridge, which was let\ndown by the guard to allow us to pass in. The kraal is exceedingly well\nlaid out. Through the centre runs a wide pathway intersected at right\nangles by other pathways so arranged as to cut the huts into square\nblocks, each block being the quarters of a company. The huts are\ndome-shaped, and built, like those of the Zulus, of a framework of\nwattle, beautifully thatched with grass; but, unlike the Zulu huts,\nthey have doorways through which men could walk. Also they are much\nlarger, and surrounded by a verandah about six feet wide, beautifully\npaved with powdered lime trodden hard.\n\nAll along each side of this wide pathway that pierces the kraal were\nranged hundreds of women, brought out by curiosity to look at us. These\nwomen, for a native race, are exceedingly handsome. They are tall and\ngraceful, and their figures are wonderfully fine. The hair, though\nshort, is rather curly than woolly, the features are frequently\naquiline, and the lips are not unpleasantly thick, as is the case among\nmost African races. But what struck us most was their exceedingly quiet\nand dignified air. They were as well-bred in their way as the\n_habituees_ of a fashionable drawing-room, and in this respect they\ndiffer from Zulu women and their cousins the Masai who inhabit the\ndistrict beyond Zanzibar. Their curiosity had brought them out to see\nus, but they allowed no rude expressions of astonishment or savage\ncriticism to pass their lips as we trudged wearily in front of them.\nNot even when old Infadoos with a surreptitious motion of the hand\npointed out the crowning wonder of poor Good's \"beautiful white legs,\"\ndid they suffer the feeling of intense admiration which evidently\nmastered their minds to find expression. They fixed their dark eyes\nupon this new and snowy loveliness, for, as I think I have said, Good's\nskin is exceedingly white, and that was all. But it was quite enough\nfor Good, who is modest by nature.\n\nWhen we reached the centre of the kraal, Infadoos halted at the door of\na large hut, which was surrounded at a distance by a circle of smaller\nones.\n\n\"Enter, Sons of the Stars,\" he said, in a magniloquent voice, \"and\ndeign to rest awhile in our humble habitations. A little food shall be\nbrought to you, so that ye may have no need to draw your belts tight\nfrom hunger; some honey and some milk, and an ox or two, and a few\nsheep; not much, my lords, but still a little food.\"\n\n\"It is good,\" said I. \"Infadoos; we are weary with travelling through\nrealms of air; now let us rest.\"\n\nAccordingly we entered the hut, which we found amply prepared for our\ncomfort. Couches of tanned skins were spread for us to lie on, and\nwater was placed for us to wash in.\n\nPresently we heard a shouting outside, and stepping to the door, saw a\nline of damsels bearing milk and roasted mealies, and honey in a pot.\nBehind these were some youths driving a fat young ox. We received the\ngifts, and then one of the young men drew the knife from his girdle and\ndexterously cut the ox's throat. In ten minutes it was dead, skinned,\nand jointed. The best of the meat was then cut off for us, and the\nrest, in the name of our party, I presented to the warriors round us,\nwho took it and distributed the \"white lords' gift.\"\n\nUmbopa set to work, with the assistance of an extremely prepossessing\nyoung woman, to boil our portion in a large earthenware pot over a fire\nwhich was built outside the hut, and when it was nearly ready we sent a\nmessage to Infadoos, and asked him and Scragga, the king's son, to join\nus.\n\nPresently they came, and sitting down upon little stools, of which\nthere were several about the hut, for the Kukuanas do not in general\nsquat upon their haunches like the Zulus, they helped us to get through\nour dinner. The old gentleman was most affable and polite, but it\nstruck me that the young one regarded us with doubt. Together with the\nrest of the party, he had been overawed by our white appearance and by\nour magic properties; but it seemed to me that, on discovering that we\nate, drank, and slept like other mortals, his awe was beginning to wear\noff, and to be replaced by a sullen suspicion--which made me feel\nrather uncomfortable.\n\nIn the course of our meal Sir Henry suggested to me that it might be\nwell to try to discover if our hosts knew anything of his brother's\nfate, or if they had ever seen or heard of him; but, on the whole, I\nthought that it would be wiser to say nothing of the matter at this\ntime. It was difficult to explain a relative lost from \"the Stars.\"\n\nAfter supper we produced our pipes and lit them; a proceeding which\nfilled Infadoos and Scragga with astonishment. The Kukuanas were\nevidently unacquainted with the divine delights of tobacco-smoke. The\nherb is grown among them extensively; but, like the Zulus, they use it\nfor snuff only, and quite failed to identify it in its new form.\n\nPresently I asked Infadoos when we were to proceed on our journey, and\nwas delighted to learn that preparations had been made for us to leave\non the following morning, messengers having already departed to inform\nTwala the king of our coming.\n\nIt appeared that Twala was at his principal place, known as Loo, making\nready for the great annual feast which was to be held in the first week\nof June. At this gathering all the regiments, with the exception of\ncertain detachments left behind for garrison purposes, are brought up\nand paraded before the king; and the great annual witch-hunt, of which\nmore by-and-by, is held.\n\nWe were to start at dawn; and Infadoos, who was to accompany us,\nexpected that we should reach Loo on the night of the second day,\nunless we were detained by accident or by swollen rivers.\n\nWhen they had given us this information our visitors bade us\ngood-night; and, having arranged to watch turn and turn about, three of\nus flung ourselves down and slept the sweet sleep of the weary, whilst\nthe fourth sat up on the look-out for possible treachery.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTWALA THE KING\n\nIt will not be necessary for me to detail at length the incidents of\nour journey to Loo. It took two full days' travelling along Solomon's\nGreat Road, which pursued its even course right into the heart of\nKukuanaland. Suffice it to say that as we went the country seemed to\ngrow richer and richer, and the kraals, with their wide surrounding\nbelts of cultivation, more and more numerous. They were all built upon\nthe same principles as the first camp which we had reached, and were\nguarded by ample garrisons of troops. Indeed, in Kukuanaland, as among\nthe Germans, the Zulus, and the Masai, every able-bodied man is a\nsoldier, so that the whole force of the nation is available for its\nwars, offensive or defensive. As we travelled we were overtaken by\nthousands of warriors hurrying up to Loo to be present at the great\nannual review and festival, and more splendid troops I never saw.\n\nAt sunset on the second day, we stopped to rest awhile upon the summit\nof some heights over which the road ran, and there on a beautiful and\nfertile plain before us lay Loo itself. For a native town it is an\nenormous place, quite five miles round, I should say, with outlying\nkraals projecting from it, that serve on grand occasions as cantonments\nfor the regiments, and a curious horseshoe-shaped hill, with which we\nwere destined to become better acquainted, about two miles to the\nnorth. It is beautifully situated, and through the centre of the kraal,\ndividing it into two portions, runs a river, which appeared to be\nbridged in several places, the same indeed that we had seen from the\nslopes of Sheba's Breasts. Sixty or seventy miles away three great\nsnow-capped mountains, placed at the points of a triangle, started out\nof the level plain. The conformation of these mountains is unlike that\nof Sheba's Breasts, being sheer and precipitous, instead of smooth and\nrounded.\n\nInfadoos saw us looking at them, and volunteered a remark.\n\n\"The road ends there,\" he said, pointing to the mountains known among\nthe Kukuanas as the \"Three Witches.\"\n\n\"Why does it end?\" I asked.\n\n\"Who knows?\" he answered with a shrug; \"the mountains are full of\ncaves, and there is a great pit between them. It is there that the wise\nmen of old time used to go to get whatever it was they came for to this\ncountry, and it is there now that our kings are buried in the Place of\nDeath.\"\n\n\"What was it they came for?\" I asked eagerly.\n\n\"Nay, I know not. My lords who have dropped from the Stars should\nknow,\" he answered with a quick look. Evidently he knew more than he\nchose to say.\n\n\"Yes,\" I went on, \"you are right, in the Stars we learn many things. I\nhave heard, for instance, that the wise men of old came to these\nmountains to find bright stones, pretty playthings, and yellow iron.\"\n\n\"My lord is wise,\" he answered coldly; \"I am but a child and cannot\ntalk with my lord on such matters. My lord must speak with Gagool the\nold, at the king's place, who is wise even as my lord,\" and he went\naway.\n\nSo soon as he was gone I turned to the others, and pointed out the\nmountains. \"There are Solomon's diamond mines,\" I said.\n\nUmbopa was standing with them, apparently plunged in one of the fits of\nabstraction which were common to him, and caught my words.\n\n\"Yes, Macumazahn,\" he put in, in Zulu, \"the diamonds are surely there,\nand you shall have them, since you white men are so fond of toys and\nmoney.\"\n\n\"How dost thou know that, Umbopa?\" I asked sharply, for I did not like\nhis mysterious ways.\n\nHe laughed. \"I dreamed it in the night, white men;\" then he too turned\non his heel and went.\n\n\"Now what,\" said Sir Henry, \"is our black friend driving at? He knows\nmore than he chooses to say, that is clear. By the way, Quatermain, has\nhe heard anything of--of my brother?\"\n\n\"Nothing; he has asked everyone he has become friendly with, but they\nall declare that no white man has ever been seen in the country before.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose that he got here at all?\" suggested Good; \"we have only\nreached the place by a miracle; is it likely he could have reached it\nwithout the map?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Sir Henry gloomily, \"but somehow I think that I\nshall find him.\"\n\nSlowly the sun sank, then suddenly darkness rushed down on the land\nlike a tangible thing. There was no breathing-space between the day and\nnight, no soft transformation scene, for in these latitudes twilight\ndoes not exist. The change from day to night is as quick and as\nabsolute as the change from life to death. The sun sank and the world\nwas wreathed in shadows. But not for long, for see in the west there is\na glow, then come rays of silver light, and at last the full and\nglorious moon lights up the plain and shoots its gleaming arrows far\nand wide, filling the earth with a faint refulgence.\n\nWe stood and watched the lovely sight, whilst the stars grew pale\nbefore this chastened majesty, and felt our hearts lifted up in the\npresence of a beauty that I cannot describe. Mine has been a rough\nlife, but there are a few things I am thankful to have lived for, and\none of them is to have seen that moon shine over Kukuanaland.\n\nPresently our meditations were broken in upon by our polite friend\nInfadoos.\n\n\"If my lords are rested we will journey on to Loo, where a hut is made\nready for my lords to-night. The moon is now bright, so that we shall\nnot fall by the way.\"\n\nWe assented, and in an hour's time were at the outskirts of the town,\nof which the extent, mapped out as it was by thousands of camp fires,\nappeared absolutely endless. Indeed, Good, who is always fond of a bad\njoke, christened it \"Unlimited Loo.\" Soon we came to a moat with a\ndrawbridge, where we were met by the rattling of arms and the hoarse\nchallenge of a sentry. Infadoos gave some password that I could not\ncatch, which was met with a salute, and we passed on through the\ncentral street of the great grass city. After nearly half an hour's\ntramp, past endless lines of huts, Infadoos halted at last by the gate\nof a little group of huts which surrounded a small courtyard of\npowdered limestone, and informed us that these were to be our \"poor\"\nquarters.\n\nWe entered, and found that a hut had been assigned to each of us. These\nhuts were superior to any that we had yet seen, and in each was a most\ncomfortable bed made of tanned skins, spread upon mattresses of\naromatic grass. Food too was ready for us, and so soon as we had washed\nourselves with water, which stood ready in earthenware jars, some young\nwomen of handsome appearance brought us roasted meats, and mealie cobs\ndaintily served on wooden platters, and presented them to us with deep\nobeisances.\n\nWe ate and drank, and then, the beds having been all moved into one hut\nby our request, a precaution at which the amiable young ladies smiled,\nwe flung ourselves down to sleep, thoroughly wearied with our long\njourney.\n\nWhen we woke it was to find the sun high in the heavens, and the female\nattendants, who did not seem to be troubled by any false shame, already\nstanding inside the hut, having been ordered to attend and help us to\n\"make ready.\"\n\n\"Make ready, indeed,\" growled Good; \"when one has only a flannel shirt\nand a pair of boots, that does not take long. I wish you would ask them\nfor my trousers, Quatermain.\"\n\nI asked accordingly, but was informed that these sacred relics had\nalready been taken to the king, who would see us in the forenoon.\n\nSomewhat to their astonishment and disappointment, having requested the\nyoung ladies to step outside, we proceeded to make the best toilet of\nwhich the circumstances admitted. Good even went the length of again\nshaving the right side of his face; the left, on which now appeared a\nvery fair crop of whiskers, we impressed upon him he must on no account\ntouch. As for ourselves, we were contented with a good wash and combing\nour hair. Sir Henry's yellow locks were now almost upon his shoulders,\nand he looked more like an ancient Dane than ever, while my grizzled\nscrub was fully an inch long, instead of half an inch, which in a\ngeneral way I considered my maximum length.\n\nBy the time that we had eaten our breakfast, and smoked a pipe, a\nmessage was brought to us by no less a personage than Infadoos himself\nthat Twala the king was ready to see us, if we would be pleased to come.\n\nWe remarked in reply that we should prefer to wait till the sun was a\nlittle higher, we were yet weary with our journey, &c., &c. It is\nalways well, when dealing with uncivilised people, not to be in too\ngreat a hurry. They are apt to mistake politeness for awe or servility.\nSo, although we were quite as anxious to see Twala as Twala could be to\nsee us, we sat down and waited for an hour, employing the interval in\npreparing such presents as our slender stock of goods\npermitted--namely, the Winchester rifle which had been used by poor\nVentvoegel, and some beads. The rifle and ammunition we determined to\npresent to his royal highness, and the beads were for his wives and\ncourtiers. We had already given a few to Infadoos and Scragga, and\nfound that they were delighted with them, never having seen such things\nbefore. At length we declared that we were ready, and guided by\nInfadoos, started off to the audience, Umbopa carrying the rifle and\nbeads.\n\nAfter walking a few hundred yards we came to an enclosure, something\nlike that surrounding the huts which had been allotted to us, only\nfifty times as big, for it could not have covered less than six or\nseven acres of ground. All round the outside fence stood a row of huts,\nwhich were the habitations of the king's wives. Exactly opposite the\ngateway, on the further side of the open space, was a very large hut,\nbuilt by itself, in which his majesty resided. All the rest was open\nground; that is to say, it would have been open had it not been filled\nby company after company of warriors, who were mustered there to the\nnumber of seven or eight thousand. These men stood still as statues as\nwe advanced through them, and it would be impossible to give an\nadequate idea of the grandeur of the spectacle which they presented,\nwith their waving plumes, their glancing spears, and iron-backed\nox-hide shields.\n\nThe space in front of the large hut was empty, but before it were\nplaced several stools. On three of these, at a sign from Infadoos, we\nseated ourselves, Umbopa standing behind us. As for Infadoos, he took\nup a position by the door of the hut. So we waited for ten minutes or\nmore in the midst of a dead silence, but conscious that we were the\nobject of the concentrated gaze of some eight thousand pairs of eyes.\nIt was a somewhat trying ordeal, but we carried it off as best we\ncould. At length the door of the hut opened, and a gigantic figure,\nwith a splendid tiger-skin karross flung over its shoulders, stepped\nout, followed by the boy Scragga, and what appeared to us to be a\nwithered-up monkey, wrapped in a fur cloak. The figure seated itself\nupon a stool, Scragga took his stand behind it, and the withered-up\nmonkey crept on all fours into the shade of the hut and squatted down.\n\nStill there was silence.\n\nThen the gigantic figure slipped off the karross and stood up before\nus, a truly alarming spectacle. It was that of an enormous man with the\nmost entirely repulsive countenance we had ever beheld. This man's lips\nwere as thick as a Negro's, the nose was flat, he had but one gleaming\nblack eye, for the other was represented by a hollow in the face, and\nhis whole expression was cruel and sensual to a degree. From the large\nhead rose a magnificent plume of white ostrich feathers, his body was\nclad in a shirt of shining chain armour, whilst round the waist and\nright knee were the usual garnishes of white ox-tail. In his right hand\nwas a huge spear, about the neck a thick torque of gold, and bound on\nthe forehead shone dully a single and enormous uncut diamond.\n\nStill there was silence; but not for long. Presently the man, whom we\nrightly guessed to be the king, raised the great javelin in his hand.\nInstantly eight thousand spears were lifted in answer, and from eight\nthousand throats rang out the royal salute of \"_Koom_.\" Three times\nthis was repeated, and each time the earth shook with the noise, that\ncan only be compared to the deepest notes of thunder.\n\n\"Be humble, O people,\" piped out a thin voice which seemed to come from\nthe monkey in the shade, \"it is the king.\"\n\n\"_It is the king_,\" boomed out the eight thousand throats in answer.\n\"_Be humble, O people, it is the king._\"\n\nThen there was silence again--dead silence. Presently, however, it was\nbroken. A soldier on our left dropped his shield, which fell with a\nclatter on to the limestone flooring.\n\nTwala turned his one cold eye in the direction of the noise.\n\n\"Come hither, thou,\" he said, in a cold voice.\n\nA fine young man stepped out of the ranks, and stood before him.\n\n\"It was thy shield that fell, thou awkward dog. Wilt thou make me a\nreproach in the eyes of these strangers from the Stars? What hast thou\nto say for thyself?\"\n\nWe saw the poor fellow turn pale under his dusky skin.\n\n\"It was by chance, O Calf of the Black Cow,\" he murmured.\n\n\"Then it is a chance for which thou must pay. Thou hast made me\nfoolish; prepare for death.\"\n\n\"I am the king's ox,\" was the low answer.\n\n\"Scragga,\" roared the king, \"let me see how thou canst use thy spear.\nKill me this blundering fool.\"\n\nScragga stepped forward with an ill-favoured grin, and lifted his\nspear. The poor victim covered his eyes with his hand and stood still.\nAs for us, we were petrified with horror.\n\n\"Once, twice,\" he waved the spear, and then struck, ah! right home--the\nspear stood out a foot behind the soldier's back. He flung up his hands\nand dropped dead. From the multitude about us rose something like a\nmurmur, it rolled round and round, and died away. The tragedy was\nfinished; there lay the corpse, and we had not yet realised that it had\nbeen enacted. Sir Henry sprang up and swore a great oath, then,\noverpowered by the sense of silence, sat down again.\n\n\"The thrust was a good one,\" said the king; \"take him away.\"\n\nFour men stepped out of the ranks, and lifting the body of the murdered\nman, carried it thence.\n\n\"Cover up the blood-stains, cover them up,\" piped out the thin voice\nthat proceeded from the monkey-like figure; \"the king's word is spoken,\nthe king's doom is done!\"\n\nThereupon a girl came forward from behind the hut, bearing a jar filled\nwith powdered lime, which she scattered over the red mark, blotting it\nfrom sight.\n\nSir Henry meanwhile was boiling with rage at what had happened; indeed,\nit was with difficulty that we could keep him still.\n\n\"Sit down, for heaven's sake,\" I whispered; \"our lives depend on it.\"\n\nHe yielded and remained quiet.\n\nTwala sat silent until the traces of the tragedy had been removed, then\nhe addressed us.\n\n\"White people,\" he said, \"who come hither, whence I know not, and why I\nknow not, greeting.\"\n\n\"Greeting, Twala, King of the Kukuanas,\" I answered.\n\n\"White people, whence come ye, and what seek ye?\"\n\n\"We come from the Stars, ask us not how. We come to see this land.\"\n\n\"Ye journey from far to see a little thing. And that man with you,\"\npointing to Umbopa, \"does he also come from the Stars?\"\n\n\"Even so; there are people of thy colour in the heavens above; but ask\nnot of matters too high for thee, Twala the king.\"\n\n\"Ye speak with a loud voice, people of the Stars,\" Twala answered in a\ntone which I scarcely liked. \"Remember that the Stars are far off, and\nye are here. How if I make you as him whom they bore away?\"\n\nI laughed out loud, though there was little laughter in my heart.\n\n\"O king,\" I said, \"be careful, walk warily over hot stones, lest thou\nshouldst burn thy feet; hold the spear by the handle, lest thou should\ncut thy hands. Touch but one hair of our heads, and destruction shall\ncome upon thee. What, have not these\"--pointing to Infadoos and\nScragga, who, young villain that he was, was employed in cleaning the\nblood of the soldier off his spear--\"told thee what manner of men we\nare? Hast thou seen the like of us?\" and I pointed to Good, feeling\nquite sure that he had never seen anybody before who looked in the\nleast like _him_ as he then appeared.\n\n\"It is true, I have not,\" said the king, surveying Good with interest.\n\n\"Have they not told thee how we strike with death from afar?\" I went on.\n\n\"They have told me, but I believe them not. Let me see you kill. Kill\nme a man among those who stand yonder\"--and he pointed to the opposite\nside of the kraal--\"and I will believe.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" I answered; \"we shed no blood of men except in just punishment;\nbut if thou wilt see, bid thy servants drive in an ox through the kraal\ngates, and before he has run twenty paces I will strike him dead.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" laughed the king, \"kill me a man and I will believe.\"\n\n\"Good, O king, so be it,\" I answered coolly; \"do thou walk across the\nopen space, and before thy feet reach the gate thou shalt be dead; or\nif thou wilt not, send thy son Scragga\" (whom at that moment it would\nhave given me much pleasure to shoot).\n\nOn hearing this suggestion Scragga uttered a sort of howl, and bolted\ninto the hut.\n\nTwala frowned majestically; the suggestion did not please him.\n\n\"Let a young ox be driven in,\" he said.\n\nTwo men at once departed, running swiftly.\n\n\"Now, Sir Henry,\" said I, \"do you shoot. I want to show this ruffian\nthat I am not the only magician of the party.\"\n\nSir Henry accordingly took his \"express,\" and made ready.\n\n\"I hope I shall make a good shot,\" he groaned.\n\n\"You must,\" I answered. \"If you miss with the first barrel, let him\nhave the second. Sight for 150 yards, and wait till the beast turns\nbroadside on.\"\n\nThen came a pause, until presently we caught sight of an ox running\nstraight for the kraal gate. It came on through the gate, then,\ncatching sight of the vast concourse of people, stopped stupidly,\nturned round, and bellowed.\n\n\"Now's your time,\" I whispered.\n\nUp went the rifle.\n\nBang! _thud_! and the ox was kicking on his back, shot in the ribs. The\nsemi-hollow bullet had done its work well, and a sigh of astonishment\nwent up from the assembled thousands.\n\nI turned round coolly--\n\n\"Have I lied, O king?\"\n\n\"Nay, white man, it is the truth,\" was the somewhat awed answer.\n\n\"Listen, Twala,\" I went on. \"Thou hast seen. Now know we come in peace,\nnot in war. See,\" and I held up the Winchester repeater; \"here is a\nhollow staff that shall enable thee to kill even as we kill, only I lay\nthis charm upon it, thou shalt kill no man with it. If thou liftest it\nagainst a man, it shall kill thee. Stay, I will show thee. Bid a\nsoldier step forty paces and place the shaft of a spear in the ground\nso that the flat blade looks towards us.\"\n\nIn a few seconds it was done.\n\n\"Now, see, I will break yonder spear.\"\n\nTaking a careful sight I fired. The bullet struck the flat of the\nspear, and shattered the blade into fragments.\n\nAgain the sigh of astonishment went up.\n\n\"Now, Twala, we give this magic tube to thee, and by-and-by I will show\nthee how to use it; but beware how thou turnest the magic of the Stars\nagainst a man of earth,\" and I handed him the rifle.\n\nThe king took it very gingerly, and laid it down at his feet. As he did\nso I observed the wizened monkey-like figure creeping from the shadow\nof the hut. It crept on all fours, but when it reached the place where\nthe king sat it rose upon its feet, and throwing the furry covering\nfrom its face, revealed a most extraordinary and weird countenance.\nApparently it was that of a woman of great age so shrunken that in size\nit seemed no larger than the face of a year-old child, although made up\nof a number of deep and yellow wrinkles. Set in these wrinkles was a\nsunken slit, that represented the mouth, beneath which the chin curved\noutwards to a point. There was no nose to speak of; indeed, the visage\nmight have been taken for that of a sun-dried corpse had it not been\nfor a pair of large black eyes, still full of fire and intelligence,\nwhich gleamed and played under the snow-white eyebrows, and the\nprojecting parchment-coloured skull, like jewels in a charnel-house. As\nfor the head itself, it was perfectly bare, and yellow in hue, while\nits wrinkled scalp moved and contracted like the hood of a cobra.\n\nThe figure to which this fearful countenance belonged, a countenance so\nfearful indeed that it caused a shiver of fear to pass through us as we\ngazed on it, stood still for a moment. Then suddenly it projected a\nskinny claw armed with nails nearly an inch long, and laying it on the\nshoulder of Twala the king, began to speak in a thin and piercing\nvoice--\n\n\"Listen, O king! Listen, O warriors! Listen, O mountains and plains and\nrivers, home of the Kukuana race! Listen, O skies and sun, O rain and\nstorm and mist! Listen, O men and women, O youths and maidens, and O ye\nbabes unborn! Listen, all things that live and must die! Listen, all\ndead things that shall live again--again to die! Listen, the spirit of\nlife is in me and I prophesy. I prophesy! I prophesy!\"\n\nThe words died away in a faint wail, and dread seemed to seize upon the\nhearts of all who heard them, including our own. This old woman was\nvery terrible.\n\n\"_Blood! blood! blood!_ rivers of blood; blood everywhere. I see it, I\nsmell it, I taste it--it is salt! it runs red upon the ground, it rains\ndown from the skies.\n\n\"_Footsteps! footsteps! footsteps!_ the tread of the white man coming\nfrom afar. It shakes the earth; the earth trembles before her master.\n\n\"Blood is good, the red blood is bright; there is no smell like the\nsmell of new-shed blood. The lions shall lap it and roar, the vultures\nshall wash their wings in it and shriek with joy.\n\n\"I am old! I am old! I have seen much blood; _ha, ha!_ but I shall see\nmore ere I die, and be merry. How old am I, think ye? Your fathers knew\nme, and _their_ fathers knew me, and _their_ fathers' fathers' fathers.\nI have seen the white man and know his desires. I am old, but the\nmountains are older than I. Who made the great road, tell me? Who wrote\nthe pictures on the rocks, tell me? Who reared up the three Silent Ones\nyonder, that gaze across the pit, tell me?\" and she pointed towards the\nthree precipitous mountains which we had noticed on the previous night.\n\n\"Ye know not, but I know. It was a white people who were before ye are,\nwho shall be when ye are not, who shall eat you up and destroy you.\n_Yea! yea! yea!_\n\n\"And what came they for, the White Ones, the Terrible Ones, the skilled\nin magic and all learning, the strong, the unswerving? What is that\nbright stone upon thy forehead, O king? Whose hands made the iron\ngarments upon thy breast, O king? Ye know not, but I know. I the Old\nOne, I the Wise One, I the _Isanusi_, the witch doctress!\"\n\nThen she turned her bald vulture-head towards us.\n\n\"What seek ye, white men of the Stars--ah, yes, of the Stars? Do ye\nseek a lost one? Ye shall not find him here. He is not here. Never for\nages upon ages has a white foot pressed this land; never except once,\nand I remember that he left it but to die. Ye come for bright stones; I\nknow it--I know it; ye shall find them when the blood is dry; but shall\nye return whence ye came, or shall ye stop with me? _Ha! ha! ha!_\n\n\"And thou, thou with the dark skin and the proud bearing,\" and she\npointed her skinny finger at Umbopa, \"who art _thou_, and what seekest\n_thou_? Not stones that shine, not yellow metal that gleams, these thou\nleavest to 'white men from the Stars.' Methinks I know thee; methinks I\ncan smell the smell of the blood in thy heart. Strip off the girdle--\"\n\nHere the features of this extraordinary creature became convulsed, and\nshe fell to the ground foaming in an epileptic fit, and was carried\ninto the hut.\n\nThe king rose up trembling, and waved his hand. Instantly the regiments\nbegan to file off, and in ten minutes, save for ourselves, the king,\nand a few attendants, the great space was left empty.\n\n\"White people,\" he said, \"it passes in my mind to kill you. Gagool has\nspoken strange words. What say ye?\"\n\nI laughed. \"Be careful, O king, we are not easy to slay. Thou hast seen\nthe fate of the ox; wouldst thou be as the ox is?\"\n\nThe king frowned. \"It is not well to threaten a king.\"\n\n\"We threaten not, we speak what is true. Try to kill us, O king, and\nlearn.\"\n\nThe great savage put his hand to his forehead and thought.\n\n\"Go in peace,\" he said at length. \"To-night is the great dance. Ye\nshall see it. Fear not that I shall set a snare for you. To-morrow I\nwill think.\"\n\n\"It is well, O king,\" I answered unconcernedly, and then, accompanied\nby Infadoos, we rose and went back to our kraal.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE WITCH-HUNT\n\nOn reaching our hut I motioned to Infadoos to enter with us.\n\n\"Now, Infadoos,\" I said, \"we would speak with thee.\"\n\n\"Let my lords say on.\"\n\n\"It seems to us, Infadoos, that Twala the king is a cruel man.\"\n\n\"It is so, my lords. Alas! the land cries out because of his cruelties.\nTo-night ye shall see. It is the great witch-hunt, and many will be\nsmelt out as wizards and slain. No man's life is safe. If the king\ncovets a man's cattle, or a man's wife, or if he fears a man that he\nshould excite a rebellion against him, then Gagool, whom ye saw, or\nsome of the witch-finding women whom she has taught, will smell that\nman out as a wizard, and he will be killed. Many must die before the\nmoon grows pale to-night. It is ever so. Perhaps I too shall be killed.\nAs yet I have been spared because I am skilled in war, and am beloved\nby the soldiers; but I know not how long I have to live. The land\ngroans at the cruelties of Twala the king; it is wearied of him and his\nred ways.\"\n\n\"Then why is it, Infadoos, that the people do not cast him down?\"\n\n\"Nay, my lords, he is the king, and if he were killed Scragga would\nreign in his place, and the heart of Scragga is blacker than the heart\nof Twala his father. If Scragga were king his yoke upon our neck would\nbe heavier than the yoke of Twala. If Imotu had never been slain, or if\nIgnosi his son had lived, it might have been otherwise; but they are\nboth dead.\"\n\n\"How knowest thou that Ignosi is dead?\" said a voice behind us. We\nlooked round astonished to see who spoke. It was Umbopa.\n\n\"What meanest thou, boy?\" asked Infadoos; \"who told thee to speak?\"\n\n\"Listen, Infadoos,\" was the answer, \"and I will tell thee a story.\nYears ago the king Imotu was killed in this country and his wife fled\nwith the boy Ignosi. Is it not so?\"\n\n\"It is so.\"\n\n\"It was said that the woman and her son died upon the mountains. Is it\nnot so?\"\n\n\"It is even so.\"\n\n\"Well, it came to pass that the mother and the boy Ignosi did not die.\nThey crossed the mountains and were led by a tribe of wandering desert\nmen across the sands beyond, till at last they came to water and grass\nand trees again.\"\n\n\"How knowest thou this?\"\n\n\"Listen. They travelled on and on, many months' journey, till they\nreached a land where a people called the Amazulu, who also are of the\nKukuana stock, live by war, and with them they tarried many years, till\nat length the mother died. Then the son Ignosi became a wanderer again,\nand journeyed into a land of wonders, where white people live, and for\nmany more years he learned the wisdom of the white people.\"\n\n\"It is a pretty story,\" said Infadoos incredulously.\n\n\"For years he lived there working as a servant and a soldier, but\nholding in his heart all that his mother had told him of his own place,\nand casting about in his mind to find how he might journey thither to\nsee his people and his father's house before he died. For long years he\nlived and waited, and at last the time came, as it ever comes to him\nwho can wait for it, and he met some white men who would seek this\nunknown land, and joined himself to them. The white men started and\ntravelled on and on, seeking for one who is lost. They crossed the\nburning desert, they crossed the snow-clad mountains, and at last\nreached the land of the Kukuanas, and there they found _thee_, O\nInfadoos.\"\n\n\"Surely thou art mad to talk thus,\" said the astonished old soldier.\n\n\"Thou thinkest so; see, I will show thee, O my uncle.\n\n\"_I am Ignosi, rightful king of the Kukuanas!_\"\n\nThen with a single movement Umbopa slipped off his \"moocha\" or girdle,\nand stood naked before us.\n\n\"Look,\" he said; \"what is this?\" and he pointed to the picture of a\ngreat snake tattooed in blue round his middle, its tail disappearing\ninto its open mouth just above where the thighs are set into the body.\n\nInfadoos looked, his eyes starting nearly out of his head. Then he fell\nupon his knees.\n\n\"_Koom! Koom!_\" he ejaculated; \"it is my brother's son; it is the king.\"\n\n\"Did I not tell thee so, my uncle? Rise; I am not yet the king, but\nwith thy help, and with the help of these brave white men, who are my\nfriends, I shall be. Yet the old witch Gagool was right, the land shall\nrun with blood first, and hers shall run with it, if she has any and\ncan die, for she killed my father with her words, and drove my mother\nforth. And now, Infadoos, choose thou. Wilt thou put thy hands between\nmy hands and be my man? Wilt thou share the dangers that lie before me,\nand help me to overthrow this tyrant and murderer, or wilt thou not?\nChoose thou.\"\n\nThe old man put his hand to his head and thought. Then he rose, and\nadvancing to where Umbopa, or rather Ignosi, stood, he knelt before\nhim, and took his hand.\n\n\"Ignosi, rightful king of the Kukuanas, I put my hand between thy\nhands, and am thy man till death. When thou wast a babe I dandled thee\nupon my knees, now shall my old arm strike for thee and freedom.\"\n\n\"It is well, Infadoos; if I conquer, thou shalt be the greatest man in\nthe kingdom after its king. If I fail, thou canst only die, and death\nis not far off from thee. Rise, my uncle.\"\n\n\"And ye, white men, will ye help me? What have I to offer you! The\nwhite stones! If I conquer and can find them, ye shall have as many as\nye can carry hence. Will that suffice you?\"\n\nI translated this remark.\n\n\"Tell him,\" answered Sir Henry, \"that he mistakes an Englishman. Wealth\nis good, and if it comes in our way we will take it; but a gentleman\ndoes not sell himself for wealth. Still, speaking for myself, I say\nthis. I have always liked Umbopa, and so far as lies in me I will stand\nby him in this business. It will be very pleasant to me to try to\nsquare matters with that cruel devil Twala. What do you say, Good, and\nyou, Quatermain?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Good, \"to adopt the language of hyperbole, in which all\nthese people seem to indulge, you can tell him that a row is surely\ngood, and warms the cockles of the heart, and that so far as I am\nconcerned I'm his boy. My only stipulation is that he allows me to wear\ntrousers.\"\n\nI translated the substance of these answers.\n\n\"It is well, my friends,\" said Ignosi, late Umbopa; \"and what sayest\nthou, Macumazahn, art thou also with me, old hunter, cleverer than a\nwounded buffalo?\"\n\nI thought awhile and scratched my head.\n\n\"Umbopa, or Ignosi,\" I said, \"I don't like revolutions. I am a man of\npeace and a bit of a coward\"--here Umbopa smiled--\"but, on the other\nhand, I stick up for my friends, Ignosi. You have stuck to us and\nplayed the part of a man, and I will stick by you. But mind you, I am a\ntrader, and have to make my living, so I accept your offer about those\ndiamonds in case we should ever be in a position to avail ourselves of\nit. Another thing: we came, as you know, to look for Incubu's (Sir\nHenry's) lost brother. You must help us to find him.\"\n\n\"That I will do,\" answered Ignosi. \"Stay, Infadoos, by the sign of the\nsnake about my middle, tell me the truth. Has any white man to thy\nknowledge set his foot within the land?\"\n\n\"None, O Ignosi.\"\n\n\"If any white man had been seen or heard of, wouldst thou have known?\"\n\n\"I should certainly have known.\"\n\n\"Thou hearest, Incubu,\" said Ignosi to Sir Henry; \"he has not been\nhere.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Sir Henry, with a sigh; \"there it is; I suppose that\nhe never got so far. Poor fellow, poor fellow! So it has all been for\nnothing. God's will be done.\"\n\n\"Now for business,\" I put in, anxious to escape from a painful subject.\n\"It is very well to be a king by right divine, Ignosi, but how dost\nthou propose to become a king indeed?\"\n\n\"Nay, I know not. Infadoos, hast thou a plan?\"\n\n\"Ignosi, Son of the Lightning,\" answered his uncle, \"to-night is the\ngreat dance and witch-hunt. Many shall be smelt out and perish, and in\nthe hearts of many others there will be grief and anguish and fury\nagainst the king Twala. When the dance is over, then I will speak to\nsome of the great chiefs, who in turn, if I can win them over, will\nspeak to their regiments. I shall speak to the chiefs softly at first,\nand bring them to see that thou art indeed the king, and I think that\nby to-morrow's light thou shalt have twenty thousand spears at thy\ncommand. And now I must go and think, and hear, and make ready. After\nthe dance is done, if I am yet alive, and we are all alive, I will meet\nthee here, and we can talk. At the best there must be war.\"\n\nAt this moment our conference was interrupted by the cry that\nmessengers had come from the king. Advancing to the door of the hut we\nordered that they should be admitted, and presently three men entered,\neach bearing a shining shirt of chain armour, and a magnificent\nbattle-axe.\n\n\"The gifts of my lord the king to the white men from the Stars!\" said a\nherald who came with them.\n\n\"We thank the king,\" I answered; \"withdraw.\"\n\nThe men went, and we examined the armour with great interest. It was\nthe most wonderful chain work that either of us had ever seen. A whole\ncoat fell together so closely that it formed a mass of links scarcely\ntoo big to be covered with both hands.\n\n\"Do you make these things in this country, Infadoos?\" I asked; \"they\nare very beautiful.\"\n\n\"Nay, my lord, they came down to us from our forefathers. We know not\nwho made them, and there are but few left.[1] None but those of royal\nblood may be clad in them. They are magic coats through which no spear\ncan pass, and those who wear them are well-nigh safe in the battle. The\nking is well pleased or much afraid, or he would not have sent these\ngarments of steel. Clothe yourselves in them to-night, my lords.\"\n\nThe remainder of that day we spent quietly, resting and talking over\nthe situation, which was sufficiently exciting. At last the sun went\ndown, the thousand watch fires glowed out, and through the darkness we\nheard the tramp of many feet and the clashing of hundreds of spears, as\nthe regiments passed to their appointed places to be ready for the\ngreat dance. Then the full moon shone out in splendour, and as we stood\nwatching her rays, Infadoos arrived, clad in his war dress, and\naccompanied by a guard of twenty men to escort us to the dance. As he\nrecommended, we had already donned the shirts of chain armour which the\nking had sent us, putting them on under our ordinary clothing, and\nfinding to our surprise that they were neither very heavy nor\nuncomfortable. These steel shirts, which evidently had been made for\nmen of a very large stature, hung somewhat loosely upon Good and\nmyself, but Sir Henry's fitted his magnificent frame like a glove. Then\nstrapping our revolvers round our waists, and taking in our hands the\nbattle-axes which the king had sent with the armour, we started.\n\nOn arriving at the great kraal, where we had that morning been received\nby the king, we found that it was closely packed with some twenty\nthousand men arranged round it in regiments. These regiments were in\nturn divided into companies, and between each company ran a little path\nto allow space for the witch-finders to pass up and down. Anything more\nimposing than the sight that was presented by this vast and orderly\nconcourse of armed men it is impossible to conceive. There they stood\nperfectly silent, and the moon poured her light upon the forest of\ntheir raised spears, upon their majestic forms, waving plumes, and the\nharmonious shading of their various-coloured shields. Wherever we\nlooked were line upon line of dim faces surmounted by range upon range\nof shimmering spears.\n\n\"Surely,\" I said to Infadoos, \"the whole army is here?\"\n\n\"Nay, Macumazahn,\" he answered, \"but a third of it. One third is\npresent at this dance each year, another third is mustered outside in\ncase there should be trouble when the killing begins, ten thousand more\ngarrison the outposts round Loo, and the rest watch at the kraals in\nthe country. Thou seest it is a great people.\"\n\n\"They are very silent,\" said Good; and indeed the intense stillness\namong such a vast concourse of living men was almost overpowering.\n\n\"What says Bougwan?\" asked Infadoos.\n\nI translated.\n\n\"Those over whom the shadow of Death is hovering are silent,\" he\nanswered grimly.\n\n\"Will many be killed?\"\n\n\"Very many.\"\n\n\"It seems,\" I said to the others, \"that we are going to assist at a\ngladiatorial show arranged regardless of expense.\"\n\nSir Henry shivered, and Good said he wished that we could get out of it.\n\n\"Tell me,\" I asked Infadoos, \"are we in danger?\"\n\n\"I know not, my lords, I trust not; but do not seem afraid. If ye live\nthrough the night all may go well with you. The soldiers murmur against\nthe king.\"\n\nAll this while we had been advancing steadily towards the centre of the\nopen space, in the midst of which were placed some stools. As we\nproceeded we perceived another small party coming from the direction of\nthe royal hut.\n\n\"It is the king Twala, Scragga his son, and Gagool the old; and see,\nwith them are those who slay,\" said Infadoos, pointing to a little\ngroup of about a dozen gigantic and savage-looking men, armed with\nspears in one hand and heavy kerries in the other.\n\nThe king seated himself upon the centre stool, Gagool crouched at his\nfeet, and the others stood behind him.\n\n\"Greeting, white lords,\" Twala cried, as we came up; \"be seated, waste\nnot precious time--the night is all too short for the deeds that must\nbe done. Ye come in a good hour, and shall see a glorious show. Look\nround, white lords; look round,\" and he rolled his one wicked eye from\nregiment to regiment. \"Can the Stars show you such a sight as this? See\nhow they shake in their wickedness, all those who have evil in their\nhearts and fear the judgment of 'Heaven above.'\"\n\n\"_Begin! begin!_\" piped Gagool, in her thin piercing voice; \"the hyaenas\nare hungry, they howl for food. _Begin! begin!_\"\n\nThen for a moment there was intense stillness, made horrible by a\npresage of what was to come.\n\nThe king lifted his spear, and suddenly twenty thousand feet were\nraised, as though they belonged to one man, and brought down with a\nstamp upon the earth. This was repeated three times, causing the solid\nground to shake and tremble. Then from a far point of the circle a\nsolitary voice began a wailing song, of which the refrain ran something\nas follows:--\n\n\"_What is the lot of man born of woman?_\"\n\nBack came the answer rolling out from every throat in that vast\ncompany--\n\n\"_Death!_\"\n\nGradually, however, the song was taken up by company after company,\ntill the whole armed multitude were singing it, and I could no longer\nfollow the words, except in so far as they appeared to represent\nvarious phases of human passions, fears, and joys. Now it seemed to be\na love song, now a majestic swelling war chant, and last of all a death\ndirge ending suddenly in one heart-breaking wail that went echoing and\nrolling away in a volume of blood-curdling sound.\n\nAgain silence fell upon the place, and again it was broken by the king\nlifting his hand. Instantly we heard a pattering of feet, and from out\nof the masses of warriors strange and awful figures appeared running\ntowards us. As they drew near we saw that these were women, most of\nthem aged, for their white hair, ornamented with small bladders taken\nfrom fish, streamed out behind them. Their faces were painted in\nstripes of white and yellow; down their backs hung snake-skins, and\nround their waists rattled circlets of human bones, while each held a\nsmall forked wand in her shrivelled hand. In all there were ten of\nthem. When they arrived in front of us they halted, and one of them,\npointing with her wand towards the crouching figure of Gagool, cried\nout--\n\n\"Mother, old mother, we are here.\"\n\n\"_Good! good! good!_\" answered that aged Iniquity. \"Are your eyes keen,\n_Isanusis_ [witch doctresses], ye seers in dark places?\"\n\n\"Mother, they are keen.\"\n\n\"_Good! good! good!_ Are your ears open, _Isanusis_, ye who hear words\nthat come not from the tongue?\"\n\n\"Mother, they are open.\"\n\n\"_Good! good! good!_ Are your senses awake, _Isanusis_--can ye smell\nblood, can ye purge the land of the wicked ones who compass evil\nagainst the king and against their neighbours? Are ye ready to do the\njustice of 'Heaven above,' ye whom I have taught, who have eaten of the\nbread of my wisdom, and drunk of the water of my magic?\"\n\n\"Mother, we can.\"\n\n\"Then go! Tarry not, ye vultures; see, the slayers\"--pointing to the\nominous group of executioners behind--\"make sharp their spears; the\nwhite men from afar are hungry to see. _Go!_\"\n\nWith a wild yell Gagool's horrid ministers broke away in every\ndirection, like fragments from a shell, the dry bones round their\nwaists rattling as they ran, and headed for various points of the dense\nhuman circle. We could not watch them all, so we fixed our eyes upon\nthe _Isanusi_ nearest to us. When she came to within a few paces of the\nwarriors she halted and began to dance wildly, turning round and round\nwith an almost incredible rapidity, and shrieking out sentences such as\n\"I smell him, the evil-doer!\" \"He is near, he who poisoned his mother!\"\n\"I hear the thoughts of him who thought evil of the king!\"\n\nQuicker and quicker she danced, till she lashed herself into such a\nfrenzy of excitement that the foam flew in specks from her gnashing\njaws, till her eyes seemed to start from her head, and her flesh to\nquiver visibly. Suddenly she stopped dead and stiffened all over, like\na pointer dog when he scents game, and then with outstretched wand she\nbegan to creep stealthily towards the soldiers before her. It seemed to\nus that as she came their stoicism gave way, and that they shrank from\nher. As for ourselves, we followed her movements with a horrible\nfascination. Presently, still creeping and crouching like a dog, the\n_Isanusi_ was before them. Then she halted and pointed, and again crept\non a pace or two.\n\nSuddenly the end came. With a shriek she sprang in and touched a tall\nwarrior with her forked wand. Instantly two of his comrades, those\nstanding immediately next to him, seized the doomed man, each by one\narm, and advanced with him towards the king.\n\nHe did not resist, but we saw that he dragged his limbs as though they\nwere paralysed, and that his fingers, from which the spear had fallen,\nwere limp like those of a man newly dead.\n\nAs he came, two of the villainous executioners stepped forward to meet\nhim. Presently they met, and the executioners turned round, looking\ntowards the king as though for orders.\n\n\"_Kill!_\" said the king.\n\n\"_Kill!_\" squeaked Gagool.\n\n\"_Kill!_\" re-echoed Scragga, with a hollow chuckle.\n\nAlmost before the words were uttered the horrible dead was done. One\nman had driven his spear into the victim's heart, and to make assurance\ndouble sure, the other had dashed out his brains with a great club.\n\n\"_One_,\" counted Twala the king, just like a black Madame Defarge, as\nGood said, and the body was dragged a few paces away and stretched out.\n\nHardly was the thing done before another poor wretch was brought up,\nlike an ox to the slaughter. This time we could see, from the\nleopard-skin cloak which he wore, that the man was a person of rank.\nAgain the awful syllables were spoken, and the victim fell dead.\n\n\"_Two_,\" counted the king.\n\nAnd so the deadly game went on, till about a hundred bodies were\nstretched in rows behind us. I have heard of the gladiatorial shows of\nthe Caesars, and of the Spanish bull-fights, but I take the liberty of\ndoubting if either of them could be half so horrible as this Kukuana\nwitch-hunt. Gladiatorial shows and Spanish bull-fights at any rate\ncontributed to the public amusement, which certainly was not the case\nhere. The most confirmed sensation-monger would fight shy of sensation\nif he knew that it was well on the cards that he would, in his own\nproper person, be the subject of the next \"event.\"\n\nOnce we rose and tried to remonstrate, but were sternly repressed by\nTwala.\n\n\"Let the law take its course, white men. These dogs are magicians and\nevil-doers; it is well that they should die,\" was the only answer\nvouchsafed to us.\n\nAbout half-past ten there was a pause. The witch-finders gathered\nthemselves together, apparently exhausted with their bloody work, and\nwe thought that the performance was done with. But it was not so, for\npresently, to our surprise, the ancient woman, Gagool, rose from her\ncrouching position, and supporting herself with a stick, staggered off\ninto the open space. It was an extraordinary sight to see this\nfrightful vulture-headed old creature, bent nearly double with extreme\nage, gather strength by degrees, until at last she rushed about almost\nas actively as her ill-omened pupils. To and fro she ran, chanting to\nherself, till suddenly she made a dash at a tall man standing in front\nof one of the regiments, and touched him. As she did this a sort of\ngroan went up from the regiment which evidently he commanded. But two\nof its officers seized him all the same, and brought him up for\nexecution. We learned afterwards that he was a man of great wealth and\nimportance, being indeed a cousin of the king.\n\nHe was slain, and Twala counted one hundred and three. Then Gagool\nagain sprang to and fro, gradually drawing nearer and nearer to\nourselves.\n\n\"Hang me if I don't believe she is going to try her games on us,\"\nejaculated Good in horror.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Sir Henry.\n\nAs for myself, when I saw that old fiend dancing nearer and nearer, my\nheart positively sank into my boots. I glanced behind us at the long\nrows of corpses, and shivered.\n\nNearer and nearer waltzed Gagool, looking for all the world like an\nanimated crooked stick or comma, her horrid eyes gleaming and glowing\nwith a most unholy lustre.\n\nNearer she came, and yet nearer, every creature in that vast assemblage\nwatching her movements with intense anxiety. At last she stood still\nand pointed.\n\n\"Which is it to be?\" asked Sir Henry to himself.\n\nIn a moment all doubts were at rest, for the old hag had rushed in and\ntouched Umbopa, alias Ignosi, on the shoulder.\n\n\"I smell him out,\" she shrieked. \"Kill him, kill him, he is full of\nevil; kill him, the stranger, before blood flows from him. Slay him, O\nking.\"\n\nThere was a pause, of which I instantly took advantage.\n\n\"O king,\" I called out, rising from my seat, \"this man is the servant\nof thy guests, he is their dog; whosoever sheds the blood of our dog\nsheds our blood. By the sacred law of hospitality I claim protection\nfor him.\"\n\n\"Gagool, mother of the witch-finders, has smelt him out; he must die,\nwhite men,\" was the sullen answer.\n\n\"Nay, he shall not die,\" I replied; \"he who tries to touch him shall\ndie indeed.\"\n\n\"Seize him!\" roared Twala to the executioners; who stood round red to\nthe eyes with the blood of their victims.\n\nThey advanced towards us, and then hesitated. As for Ignosi, he\nclutched his spear, and raised it as though determined to sell his life\ndearly.\n\n\"Stand back, ye dogs!\" I shouted, \"if ye would see to-morrow's light.\nTouch one hair of his head and your king dies,\" and I covered Twala\nwith my revolver. Sir Henry and Good also drew their pistols, Sir Henry\npointing his at the leading executioner, who was advancing to carry out\nthe sentence, and Good taking a deliberate aim at Gagool.\n\nTwala winced perceptibly as my barrel came in a line with his broad\nchest.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"what is it to be, Twala?\"\n\nThen he spoke.\n\n\"Put away your magic tubes,\" he said; \"ye have adjured me in the name\nof hospitality, and for that reason, but not from fear of what ye can\ndo, I spare him. Go in peace.\"\n\n\"It is well,\" I answered unconcernedly; \"we are weary of slaughter, and\nwould sleep. Is the dance ended?\"\n\n\"It is ended,\" Twala answered sulkily. \"Let these dead dogs,\" pointing\nto the long rows of corpses, \"be flung out to the hyaenas and the\nvultures,\" and he lifted his spear.\n\nInstantly the regiments began to defile through the kraal gateway in\nperfect silence, a fatigue party only remaining behind to drag away the\ncorpses of those who had been sacrificed.\n\nThen we rose also, and making our salaam to his majesty, which he\nhardly deigned to acknowledge, we departed to our huts.\n\n\"Well,\" said Sir Henry, as we sat down, having first lit a lamp of the\nsort used by the Kukuanas, of which the wick is made from the fibre of\na species of palm leaf, and the oil from clarified hippopotamus fat,\n\"well, I feel uncommonly inclined to be sick.\"\n\n\"If I had any doubts about helping Umbopa to rebel against that\ninfernal blackguard,\" put in Good, \"they are gone now. It was as much\nas I could do to sit still while that slaughter was going on. I tried\nto keep my eyes shut, but they would open just at the wrong time. I\nwonder where Infadoos is. Umbopa, my friend, you ought to be grateful\nto us; your skin came near to having an air-hole made in it.\"\n\n\"I am grateful, Bougwan,\" was Umbopa's answer, when I had translated,\n\"and I shall not forget. As for Infadoos, he will be here by-and-by. We\nmust wait.\"\n\nSo we lit our pipes and waited.\n\n\n[1] In the Soudan swords and coats of mail are still worn by Arabs,\nwhose ancestors must have stripped them from the bodies of\nCrusaders.--Editor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nWE GIVE A SIGN\n\nFor a long while--two hours, I should think--we sat there in silence,\nbeing too much overwhelmed by the recollection of the horrors we had\nseen to talk. At last, just as we were thinking of turning in--for the\nnight drew nigh to dawn--we heard a sound of steps. Then came the\nchallenge of a sentry posted at the kraal gate, which apparently was\nanswered, though not in an audible tone, for the steps still advanced;\nand in another second Infadoos had entered the hut, followed by some\nhalf-dozen stately-looking chiefs.\n\n\"My lords,\" he said, \"I have come according to my word. My lords and\nIgnosi, rightful king of the Kukuanas, I have brought with me these\nmen,\" pointing to the row of chiefs, \"who are great men among us,\nhaving each one of them the command of three thousand soldiers, that\nlive but to do their bidding, under the king's. I have told them of\nwhat I have seen, and what my ears have heard. Now let them also behold\nthe sacred snake around thee, and hear thy story, Ignosi, that they may\nsay whether or no they will make cause with thee against Twala the\nking.\"\n\nBy way of answer Ignosi again stripped off his girdle, and exhibited\nthe snake tattooed about him. Each chief in turn drew near and examined\nthe sign by the dim light of the lamp, and without saying a word passed\non to the other side.\n\nThen Ignosi resumed his moocha, and addressing them, repeated the\nhistory he had detailed in the morning.\n\n\"Now ye have heard, chiefs,\" said Infadoos, when he had done, \"what say\nye: will ye stand by this man and help him to his father's throne, or\nwill ye not? The land cries out against Twala, and the blood of the\npeople flows like the waters in spring. Ye have seen to-night. Two\nother chiefs there were with whom I had it in my mind to speak, and\nwhere are they now? The hyaenas howl over their corpses. Soon shall ye\nbe as they are if ye strike not. Choose then, my brothers.\"\n\nThe eldest of the six men, a short, thick-set warrior, with white hair,\nstepped forward a pace and answered--\n\n\"Thy words are true, Infadoos; the land cries out. My own brother is\namong those who died to-night; but this is a great matter, and the\nthing is hard to believe. How know we that if we lift our spears it may\nnot be for a thief and a liar? It is a great matter, I say, of which\nnone can see the end. For of this be sure, blood will flow in rivers\nbefore the deed is done; many will still cleave to the king, for men\nworship the sun that still shines bright in the heavens, rather than\nthat which has not risen. These white men from the Stars, their magic\nis great, and Ignosi is under the cover of their wing. If he be indeed\nthe rightful king, let them give us a sign, and let the people have a\nsign, that all may see. So shall men cleave to us, knowing of a truth\nthat the white man's magic is with them.\"\n\n\"Ye have the sign of the snake,\" I answered.\n\n\"My lord, it is not enough. The snake may have been placed there since\nthe man's childhood. Show us a sign, and it will suffice. But we will\nnot move without a sign.\"\n\nThe others gave a decided assent, and I turned in perplexity to Sir\nHenry and Good, and explained the situation.\n\n\"I think that I have it,\" said Good exultingly; \"ask them to give us a\nmoment to think.\"\n\nI did so, and the chiefs withdrew. So soon as they had gone Good went\nto the little box where he kept his medicines, unlocked it, and took\nout a note-book, in the fly-leaves of which was an almanack. \"Now look\nhere, you fellows, isn't to-morrow the 4th of June?\" he said.\n\nWe had kept a careful note of the days, so were able to answer that it\nwas.\n\n\"Very good; then here we have it--'4 June, total eclipse of the moon\ncommences at 8.15 Greenwich time, visible in Teneriffe--_South Africa_,\n&c.' There's a sign for you. Tell them we will darken the moon\nto-morrow night.\"\n\nThe idea was a splendid one; indeed, the only weak spot about it was a\nfear lest Good's almanack might be incorrect. If we made a false\nprophecy on such a subject, our prestige would be gone for ever, and so\nwould Ignosi's chance of the throne of the Kukuanas.\n\n\"Suppose that the almanack is wrong,\" suggested Sir Henry to Good, who\nwas busily employed in working out something on a blank page of the\nbook.\n\n\"I see no reason to suppose anything of the sort,\" was his answer.\n\"Eclipses always come up to time; at least that is my experience of\nthem, and it especially states that this one will be visible in South\nAfrica. I have worked out the reckonings as well as I can, without\nknowing our exact position; and I make out that the eclipse should\nbegin here about ten o'clock tomorrow night, and last till half-past\ntwelve. For an hour and a half or so there should be almost total\ndarkness.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Sir Henry, \"I suppose we had better risk it.\"\n\nI acquiesced, though doubtfully, for eclipses are queer cattle to deal\nwith--it might be a cloudy night, for instance, or our dates might be\nwrong--and sent Umbopa to summon the chiefs back. Presently they came,\nand I addressed them thus--\n\n\"Great men of the Kukuanas, and thou, Infadoos, listen. We love not to\nshow our powers, for to do so is to interfere with the course of\nnature, and to plunge the world into fear and confusion. But since this\nmatter is a great one, and as we are angered against the king because\nof the slaughter we have seen, and because of the act of the _Isanusi_\nGagool, who would have put our friend Ignosi to death, we have\ndetermined to break a rule, and to give such a sign as all men may see.\nCome hither\"; and I led them to the door of the hut and pointed to the\nred ball of the moon. \"What see ye there?\"\n\n\"We see the sinking moon,\" answered the spokesman of the party.\n\n\"It is so. Now tell me, can any mortal man put out that moon before her\nhour of setting, and bring the curtain of black night down upon the\nland?\"\n\nThe chief laughed a little at the question. \"No, my lord, that no man\ncan do. The moon is stronger than man who looks on her, nor can she\nvary in her courses.\"\n\n\"Ye say so. Yet I tell you that to-morrow night, about two hours before\nmidnight, we will cause the moon to be eaten up for a space of an hour\nand half an hour. Yes, deep darkness shall cover the earth, and it\nshall be for a sign that Ignosi is indeed king of the Kukuanas. If we\ndo this thing, will ye be satisfied?\"\n\n\"Yea, my lords,\" answered the old chief with a smile, which was\nreflected on the faces of his companions; \"_if_ ye do this thing, we\nwill be satisfied indeed.\"\n\n\"It shall be done; we three, Incubu, Bougwan, and Macumazahn, have said\nit, and it shall be done. Dost thou hear, Infadoos?\"\n\n\"I hear, my lord, but it is a wonderful thing that ye promise, to put\nout the moon, the mother of the world, when she is at her full.\"\n\n\"Yet shall we do it, Infadoos.\"\n\n\"It is well, my lords. To-day, two hours after sunset, Twala will send\nfor my lords to witness the girls dance, and one hour after the dance\nbegins the girl whom Twala thinks the fairest shall be killed by\nScragga, the king's son, as a sacrifice to the Silent Ones, who sit and\nkeep watch by the mountains yonder,\" and he pointed towards the three\nstrange-looking peaks where Solomon's road was supposed to end. \"Then\nlet my lords darken the moon, and save the maiden's life, and the\npeople will believe indeed.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said the old chief, still smiling a little, \"the people will\nbelieve indeed.\"\n\n\"Two miles from Loo,\" went on Infadoos, \"there is a hill curved like a\nnew moon, a stronghold, where my regiment, and three other regiments\nwhich these chiefs command, are stationed. This morning we will make a\nplan whereby two or three other regiments may be moved there also.\nThen, if in truth my lords can darken the moon, in the darkness I will\ntake my lords by the hand and lead them out of Loo to this place, where\nthey shall be safe, and thence we can make war upon Twala the king.\"\n\n\"It is good,\" said I. \"Let leave us to sleep awhile and to make ready\nour magic.\"\n\nInfadoos rose, and, having saluted us, departed with the chiefs.\n\n\"My friends,\" said Ignosi, so soon as they were gone, \"can ye do this\nwonderful thing, or were ye speaking empty words to the captains?\"\n\n\"We believe that we can do it, Umbopa--Ignosi, I mean.\"\n\n\"It is strange,\" he answered, \"and had ye not been Englishmen I would\nnot have believed it; but I have learned that English 'gentlemen' tell\nno lies. If we live through the matter, be sure that I will repay you.\"\n\n\"Ignosi,\" said Sir Henry, \"promise me one thing.\"\n\n\"I will promise, Incubu, my friend, even before I hear it,\" answered\nthe big man with a smile. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"This: that if ever you come to be king of this people you will do away\nwith the smelling out of wizards such as we saw last night; and that\nthe killing of men without trial shall no longer take place in the\nland.\"\n\nIgnosi thought for a moment after I had translated this request, and\nthen answered--\n\n\"The ways of black people are not as the ways of white men, Incubu, nor\ndo we value life so highly. Yet I will promise. If it be in my power to\nhold them back, the witch-finders shall hunt no more, nor shall any man\ndie the death without trial or judgment.\"\n\n\"That's a bargain, then,\" said Sir Henry; \"and now let us get a little\nrest.\"\n\nThoroughly wearied out, we were soon sound asleep, and slept till\nIgnosi woke us about eleven o'clock. Then we rose, washed, and ate a\nhearty breakfast. After that we went outside the hut and walked about,\namusing ourselves with examining the structure of the Kukuana huts and\nobserving the customs of the women.\n\n\"I hope that eclipse will come off,\" said Sir Henry presently.\n\n\"If it does not it will soon be all up with us,\" I answered mournfully;\n\"for so sure as we are living men some of those chiefs will tell the\nwhole story to the king, and then there will be another sort of\neclipse, and one that we shall certainly not like.\"\n\nReturning to the hut we ate some dinner, and passed the rest of the day\nin receiving visits of ceremony and curiosity. At length the sun set,\nand we enjoyed a couple of hours of such quiet as our melancholy\nforebodings would allow to us. Finally, about half-past eight, a\nmessenger came from Twala to bid us to the great annual \"dance of\ngirls\" which was about to be celebrated.\n\nHastily we put on the chain shirts that the king had sent us, and\ntaking our rifles and ammunition with us, so as to have them handy in\ncase we had to fly, as suggested by Infadoos, we started boldly enough,\nthough with inward fear and trembling. The great space in front of the\nking's kraal bore a very different appearance from that which it had\npresented on the previous evening. In place of the grim ranks of\nserried warriors were company after company of Kukuana girls, not\nover-dressed, so far as clothing went, but each crowned with a wreath\nof flowers, and holding a palm leaf in one hand and a white arum lily\nin the other. In the centre of the open moonlit space sat Twala the\nking, with old Gagool at his feet, attended by Infadoos, the boy\nScragga, and twelve guards. There were also present about a score of\nchiefs, amongst whom I recognised most of our friends of the night\nbefore.\n\nTwala greeted us with much apparent cordiality, though I saw him fix\nhis one eye viciously on Umbopa.\n\n\"Welcome, white men from the Stars,\" he said; \"this is another sight\nfrom that which your eyes gazed on by the light of last night's moon,\nbut it is not so good a sight. Girls are pleasant, and were it not for\nsuch as these,\" and he pointed round him, \"we should none of us be here\nthis day; but men are better. Kisses and the tender words of women are\nsweet, but the sound of the clashing of the spears of warriors, and the\nsmell of men's blood, are sweeter far! Would ye have wives from among\nour people, white men? If so, choose the fairest here, and ye shall\nhave them, as many as ye will,\" and he paused for an answer.\n\nAs the prospect did not seem to be without attractions for Good, who,\nlike most sailors, is of a susceptible nature,--being elderly and wise,\nforeseeing the endless complications that anything of the sort would\ninvolve, for women bring trouble so surely as the night follows the\nday, I put in a hasty answer--\n\n\"Thanks to thee, O king, but we white men wed only with white women\nlike ourselves. Your maidens are fair, but they are not for us!\"\n\nThe king laughed. \"It is well. In our land there is a proverb which\nruns, 'Women's eyes are always bright, whatever the colour,' and\nanother that says, 'Love her who is present, for be sure she who is\nabsent is false to thee;' but perhaps these things are not so in the\nStars. In a land where men are white all things are possible. So be it,\nwhite men; the girls will not go begging! Welcome again; and welcome,\ntoo, thou black one; if Gagool here had won her way, thou wouldst have\nbeen stiff and cold by now. It is lucky for thee that thou too camest\nfrom the Stars; ha! ha!\"\n\n\"I can kill thee before thou killest me, O king,\" was Ignosi's calm\nanswer, \"and thou shalt be stiff before my limbs cease to bend.\"\n\nTwala started. \"Thou speakest boldly, boy,\" he replied angrily;\n\"presume not too far.\"\n\n\"He may well be bold in whose lips are truth. The truth is a sharp\nspear which flies home and misses not. It is a message from 'the\nStars,' O king.\"\n\nTwala scowled, and his one eye gleamed fiercely, but he said nothing\nmore.\n\n\"Let the dance begin,\" he cried, and then the flower-crowned girls\nsprang forward in companies, singing a sweet song and waving the\ndelicate palms and white lilies. On they danced, looking faint and\nspiritual in the soft, sad light of the risen moon; now whirling round\nand round, now meeting in mimic warfare, swaying, eddying here and\nthere, coming forward, falling back in an ordered confusion delightful\nto witness. At last they paused, and a beautiful young woman sprang out\nof the ranks and began to pirouette in front of us with a grace and\nvigour which would have put most ballet girls to shame. At length she\nretired exhausted, and another took her place, then another and\nanother, but none of them, either in grace, skill, or personal\nattractions, came up to the first.\n\nWhen the chosen girls had all danced, the king lifted his hand.\n\n\"Which deem ye the fairest, white men?\" he asked.\n\n\"The first,\" said I unthinkingly. Next second I regretted it, for I\nremembered that Infadoos had told us that the fairest woman must be\noffered up as a sacrifice.\n\n\"Then is my mind as your minds, and my eyes as your eyes. She is the\nfairest! and a sorry thing it is for her, for she must die!\"\n\n\"_Ay, must die!_\" piped out Gagool, casting a glance of her quick eyes\nin the direction of the poor girl, who, as yet ignorant of the awful\nfate in store for her, was standing some ten yards off in front of a\ncompany of maidens, engaged in nervously picking a flower from her\nwreath to pieces, petal by petal.\n\n\"Why, O king?\" said I, restraining my indignation with difficulty; \"the\ngirl has danced well, and pleased us; she is fair too; it would be hard\nto reward her with death.\"\n\nTwala laughed as he answered--\n\n\"It is our custom, and the figures who sit in stone yonder,\" and he\npointed towards the three distant peaks, \"must have their due. Did I\nfail to put the fairest girl to death to-day, misfortune would fall\nupon me and my house. Thus runs the prophecy of my people: 'If the king\noffer not a sacrifice of a fair girl, on the day of the dance of\nmaidens, to the Old Ones who sit and watch on the mountains, then shall\nhe fall, and his house.' Look ye, white men, my brother who reigned\nbefore me offered not the sacrifice, because of the tears of the woman,\nand he fell, and his house, and I reign in his stead. It is finished;\nshe must die!\" Then turning to the guards--\"Bring her hither; Scragga,\nmake sharp thy spear.\"\n\nTwo of the men stepped forward, and as they advanced, the girl, for the\nfirst time realising her impending fate, screamed aloud and turned to\nfly. But the strong hands caught her fast, and brought her, struggling\nand weeping, before us.\n\n\"What is thy name, girl?\" piped Gagool. \"What! wilt thou not answer?\nShall the king's son do his work at once?\"\n\nAt this hint, Scragga, looking more evil than ever, advanced a step and\nlifted his great spear, and at that moment I saw Good's hand creep to\nhis revolver. The poor girl caught the faint glint of steel through her\ntears, and it sobered her anguish. She ceased struggling, and clasping\nher hands convulsively, stood shuddering from head to foot.\n\n\"See,\" cried Scragga in high glee, \"she shrinks from the sight of my\nlittle plaything even before she has tasted it,\" and he tapped the\nbroad blade of his spear.\n\n\"If ever I get the chance you shall pay for that, you young hound!\" I\nheard Good mutter beneath his breath.\n\n\"Now that thou art quiet, give us thy name, my dear. Come, speak out,\nand fear not,\" said Gagool in mockery.\n\n\"Oh, mother,\" answered the girl, in trembling accents, \"my name is\nFoulata, of the house of Suko. Oh, mother, why must I die? I have done\nno wrong!\"\n\n\"Be comforted,\" went on the old woman in her hateful tone of mockery.\n\"Thou must die, indeed, as a sacrifice to the Old Ones who sit yonder,\"\nand she pointed to the peaks; \"but it is better to sleep in the night\nthan to toil in the daytime; it is better to die than to live, and thou\nshalt die by the royal hand of the king's own son.\"\n\nThe girl Foulata wrung her hands in anguish, and cried out aloud, \"Oh,\ncruel! and I so young! What have I done that I should never again see\nthe sun rise out of the night, or the stars come following on his track\nin the evening, that I may no more gather the flowers when the dew is\nheavy, or listen to the laughing of the waters? Woe is me, that I shall\nnever see my father's hut again, nor feel my mother's kiss, nor tend\nthe lamb that is sick! Woe is me, that no lover shall put his arm\naround me and look into my eyes, nor shall men children be born of me!\nOh, cruel, cruel!\"\n\nAnd again she wrung her hands and turned her tear-stained\nflower-crowned face to Heaven, looking so lovely in her despair--for\nshe was indeed a beautiful woman--that assuredly the sight of her would\nhave melted the hearts of any less cruel than were the three fiends\nbefore us. Prince Arthur's appeal to the ruffians who came to blind him\nwas not more touching than that of this savage girl.\n\nBut it did not move Gagool or Gagool's master, though I saw signs of\npity among the guards behind, and on the faces of the chiefs; and as\nfor Good, he gave a fierce snort of indignation, and made a motion as\nthough to go to her assistance. With all a woman's quickness, the\ndoomed girl interpreted what was passing in his mind, and by a sudden\nmovement flung herself before him, and clasped his \"beautiful white\nlegs\" with her hands.\n\n\"Oh, white father from the Stars!\" she cried, \"throw over me the mantle\nof thy protection; let me creep into the shadow of thy strength, that I\nmay be saved. Oh, keep me from these cruel men and from the mercies of\nGagool!\"\n\n\"All right, my hearty, I'll look after you,\" sang out Good in nervous\nSaxon. \"Come, get up, there's a good girl,\" and he stooped and caught\nher hand.\n\nTwala turned and motioned to his son, who advanced with his spear\nlifted.\n\n\"Now's your time,\" whispered Sir Henry to me; \"what are you waiting\nfor?\"\n\n\"I am waiting for that eclipse,\" I answered; \"I have had my eye on the\nmoon for the last half-hour, and I never saw it look healthier.\"\n\n\"Well, you must risk it now, or the girl will be killed. Twala is\nlosing patience.\"\n\nRecognising the force of the argument, and having cast one more\ndespairing look at the bright face of the moon, for never did the most\nardent astronomer with a theory to prove await a celestial event with\nsuch anxiety, I stepped with all the dignity that I could command\nbetween the prostrate girl and the advancing spear of Scragga.\n\n\"King,\" I said, \"it shall not be; we will not endure this thing; let\nthe girl go in safety.\"\n\nTwala rose from his seat in wrath and astonishment, and from the chiefs\nand serried ranks of maidens who had closed in slowly upon us in\nanticipation of the tragedy came a murmur of amazement.\n\n\"_Shall not be!_ thou white dog, that yappest at the lion in his cave;\n_shall not be!_ art thou mad? Be careful, lest this chicken's fate\novertake thee, and those with thee. How canst thou save her or thyself?\nWho art thou that thou settest thyself between me and my will? Back, I\nsay. Scragga, kill her! Ho, guards! seize these men.\"\n\nAt his cry armed men ran swiftly from behind the hut, where they had\nevidently been placed beforehand.\n\nSir Henry, Good, and Umbopa ranged themselves alongside of me, and\nlifted their rifles.\n\n\"Stop!\" I shouted boldly, though at the moment my heart was in my\nboots. \"Stop! we, the white men from the Stars, say that it shall not\nbe. Come but one pace nearer, and we will put out the moon like a\nwind-blown lamp, as we who dwell in her House can do, and plunge the\nland in darkness. Dare to disobey, and ye shall taste of our magic.\"\n\nMy threat produced an effect; the men halted, and Scragga stood still\nbefore us, his spear lifted.\n\n\"Hear him! hear him!\" piped Gagool; \"hear the liar who says that he\nwill put out the moon like a lamp. Let him do it, and the girl shall be\nspeared. Yes, let him do it, or die by the girl, he and those with him.\"\n\nI glanced up at the moon despairingly, and now to my intense joy and\nrelief saw that we--or rather the almanack--had made no mistake. On the\nedge of the great orb lay a faint rim of shadow, while a smoky hue grew\nand gathered upon its bright surface. Never shall I forget that\nsupreme, that superb moment of relief.\n\nThen I lifted my hand solemnly towards the sky, an example which Sir\nHenry and Good followed, and quoted a line or two from the \"Ingoldsby\nLegends\" at it in the most impressive tones that I could command. Sir\nHenry followed suit with a verse out of the Old Testament, and\nsomething about Balbus building a wall, in Latin, whilst Good addressed\nthe Queen of Night in a volume of the most classical bad language which\nhe could think of.\n\nSlowly the penumbra, the shadow of a shadow, crept on over the bright\nsurface, and as it crept I heard deep gasps of fear rising from the\nmultitude around.\n\n\"Look, O king!\" I cried; \"look, Gagool! Look, chiefs and people and\nwomen, and see if the white men from the Stars keep their word, or if\nthey be but empty liars!\n\n\"The moon grows black before your eyes; soon there will be\ndarkness--ay, darkness in the hour of the full moon. Ye have asked for\na sign; it is given to you. Grow dark, O Moon! withdraw thy light, thou\npure and holy One; bring the proud heart of usurping murderers to the\ndust, and eat up the world with shadows.\"\n\nA groan of terror burst from the onlookers. Some stood petrified with\ndread, others threw themselves upon their knees and cried aloud. As for\nthe king, he sat still and turned pale beneath his dusky skin. Only\nGagool kept her courage.\n\n\"It will pass,\" she cried; \"I have often seen the like before; no man\ncan put out the moon; lose not heart; sit still--the shadow will pass.\"\n\n\"Wait, and ye shall see,\" I replied, hopping with excitement. \"O Moon!\nMoon! Moon! wherefore art thou so cold and fickle?\" This appropriate\nquotation was from the pages of a popular romance that I chanced to\nhave read recently, though now I come to think of it, it was ungrateful\nof me to abuse the Lady of the Heavens, who was showing herself to be\nthe truest of friends to us, however she may have behaved to the\nimpassioned lover in the novel. Then I added: \"Keep it up, Good, I\ncan't remember any more poetry. Curse away, there's a good fellow.\"\n\nGood responded nobly to this tax upon his inventive faculties. Never\nbefore had I the faintest conception of the breadth and depth and\nheight of a naval officer's objurgatory powers. For ten minutes he went\non in several languages without stopping, and he scarcely ever repeated\nhimself.\n\nMeanwhile the dark ring crept on, while all that great assembly fixed\ntheir eyes upon the sky and stared and stared in fascinated silence.\nStrange and unholy shadows encroached upon the moonlight, an ominous\nquiet filled the place. Everything grew still as death. Slowly and in\nthe midst of this most solemn silence the minutes sped away, and while\nthey sped the full moon passed deeper and deeper into the shadow of the\nearth, as the inky segment of its circle slid in awful majesty across\nthe lunar craters. The great pale orb seemed to draw near and to grow\nin size. She turned a coppery hue, then that portion of her surface\nwhich was unobscured as yet grew grey and ashen, and at length, as\ntotality approached, her mountains and her plains were to be seen\nglowing luridly through a crimson gloom.\n\nOn, yet on, crept the ring of darkness; it was now more than half\nacross the blood-red orb. The air grew thick, and still more deeply\ntinged with dusky crimson. On, yet on, till we could scarcely see the\nfierce faces of the group before us. No sound rose now from the\nspectators, and at last Good stopped swearing.\n\n\"The moon is dying--the white wizards have killed the moon,\" yelled the\nprince Scragga at last. \"We shall all perish in the dark,\" and animated\nby fear or fury, or by both, he lifted his spear and drove it with all\nhis force at Sir Henry's breast. But he forgot the mail shirts that the\nking had given us, and which we wore beneath our clothing. The steel\nrebounded harmless, and before he could repeat the blow Curtis had\nsnatched the spear from his hand and sent it straight through him.\n\nScragga dropped dead.\n\nAt the sight, and driven mad with fear of the gathering darkness, and\nof the unholy shadow which, as they believed, was swallowing the moon,\nthe companies of girls broke up in wild confusion, and ran screeching\nfor the gateways. Nor did the panic stop there. The king himself,\nfollowed by his guards, some of the chiefs, and Gagool, who hobbled\naway after them with marvellous alacrity, fled for the huts, so that in\nanother minute we ourselves, the would-be victim Foulata, Infadoos, and\nmost of the chiefs who had interviewed us on the previous night, were\nleft alone upon the scene, together with the dead body of Scragga,\nTwala's son.\n\n\"Chiefs,\" I said, \"we have given you the sign. If ye are satisfied, let\nus fly swiftly to the place of which ye spoke. The charm cannot now be\nstopped. It will work for an hour and the half of an hour. Let us cover\nourselves in the darkness.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Infadoos, turning to go, an example which was followed by\nthe awed captains, ourselves, and the girl Foulata, whom Good took by\nthe arm.\n\nBefore we reached the gate of the kraal the moon went out utterly, and\nfrom every quarter of the firmament the stars rushed forth into the\ninky sky.\n\nHolding each other by the hand we stumbled on through the darkness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nBEFORE THE BATTLE\n\nLuckily for us, Infadoos and the chiefs knew all the paths of the great\ntown perfectly, so that we passed by side-ways unmolested, and\nnotwithstanding the gloom we made fair progress.\n\nFor an hour or more we journeyed on, till at length the eclipse began\nto pass, and that edge of the moon which had disappeared the first\nbecame again visible. Suddenly, as we watched, there burst from it a\nsilver streak of light, accompanied by a wondrous ruddy glow, which\nhung upon the blackness of the sky like a celestial lamp, and a wild\nand lovely sight it was. In another five minutes the stars began to\nfade, and there was sufficient light to see our whereabouts. We then\ndiscovered that we were clear of the town of Loo, and approaching a\nlarge flat-topped hill, measuring some two miles in circumference. This\nhill, which is of a formation common in South Africa, is not very high;\nindeed, its greatest elevation is scarcely more than 200 feet, but it\nis shaped like a horseshoe, and its sides are rather precipitous and\nstrewn with boulders. On the grass table-land at its summit is ample\ncamping-ground, which had been utilised as a military cantonment of no\nmean strength. Its ordinary garrison was one regiment of three thousand\nmen, but as we toiled up the steep side of the mountain in the\nreturning moonlight we perceived that there were several of such\nregiments encamped there.\n\nReaching the table-land at last, we found crowds of men roused from\ntheir sleep, shivering with fear and huddled up together in the utmost\nconsternation at the natural phenomenon which they were witnessing.\nPassing through these without a word, we gained a hut in the centre of\nthe ground, where we were astonished to find two men waiting, laden\nwith our few goods and chattels, which of course we had been obliged to\nleave behind in our hasty flight.\n\n\"I sent for them,\" explained Infadoos; \"and also for these,\" and he\nlifted up Good's long-lost trousers.\n\nWith an exclamation of rapturous delight Good sprang at them, and\ninstantly proceeded to put them on.\n\n\"Surely my lord will not hide his beautiful white legs!\" exclaimed\nInfadoos regretfully.\n\nBut Good persisted, and once only did the Kukuana people get the chance\nof seeing his beautiful legs again. Good is a very modest man.\nHenceforward they had to satisfy their aesthetic longings with his one\nwhisker, his transparent eye, and his movable teeth.\n\nStill gazing with fond remembrance at Good's trousers, Infadoos next\ninformed us that he had commanded the regiments to muster so soon as\nthe day broke, in order to explain to them fully the origin and\ncircumstances of the rebellion which was decided on by the chiefs, and\nto introduce to them the rightful heir to the throne, Ignosi.\n\nAccordingly, when the sun was up, the troops--in all some twenty\nthousand men, and the flower of the Kukuana army--were mustered on a\nlarge open space, to which we went. The men were drawn up in three\nsides of a dense square, and presented a magnificent spectacle. We took\nour station on the open side of the square, and were speedily\nsurrounded by all the principal chiefs and officers.\n\nThese, after silence had been proclaimed, Infadoos proceeded to\naddress. He narrated to them in vigorous and graceful language--for,\nlike most Kukuanas of high rank, he was a born orator--the history of\nIgnosi's father, and of how he had been basely murdered by Twala the\nking, and his wife and child driven out to starve. Then he pointed out\nthat the people suffered and groaned under Twala's cruel rule,\ninstancing the proceedings of the previous night, when, under pretence\nof their being evil-doers, many of the noblest in the land had been\ndragged forth and wickedly done to death. Next he went on to say that\nthe white lords from the Stars, looking down upon their country, had\nperceived its trouble, and determined, at great personal inconvenience,\nto alleviate its lot: That they had accordingly taken the real king of\nthe Kukuanas, Ignosi, who was languishing in exile, by the hand, and\nled him over the mountains: That they had seen the wickedness of\nTwala's doings, and for a sign to the wavering, and to save the life of\nthe girl Foulata, actually, by the exercise of their high magic, had\nput out the moon and slain the young fiend Scragga; and that they were\nprepared to stand by them, and assist them to overthrow Twala, and set\nup the rightful king, Ignosi, in his place.\n\nHe finished his discourse amidst a murmur of approbation. Then Ignosi\nstepped forward and began to speak. Having reiterated all that Infadoos\nhis uncle had said, he concluded a powerful speech in these words:--\n\n\"O chiefs, captains, soldiers, and people, ye have heard my words. Now\nmust ye make choice between me and him who sits upon my throne, the\nuncle who killed his brother, and hunted his brother's child forth to\ndie in the cold and the night. That I am indeed the king\nthese\"--pointing to the chiefs--\"can tell you, for they have seen the\nsnake about my middle. If I were not the king, would these white men be\non my side with all their magic? Tremble, chiefs, captains, soldiers,\nand people! Is not the darkness they have brought upon the land to\nconfound Twala and cover our flight, darkness even in the hour of the\nfull moon, yet before your eyes?\"\n\n\"It is,\" answered the soldiers.\n\n\"I am the king; I say to you, I am the king,\" went on Ignosi, drawing\nup his great stature to its full, and lifting his broad-bladed\nbattle-axe above his head. \"If there be any man among you who says that\nit is not so, let him stand forth and I will fight him now, and his\nblood shall be a red token that I tell you true. Let him stand forth, I\nsay;\" and he shook the great axe till it flashed in the sunlight.\n\nAs nobody seemed inclined to respond to this heroic version of \"Dilly,\nDilly, come and be killed,\" our late henchman proceeded with his\naddress.\n\n\"I am indeed the king, and should ye stand by my side in the battle, if\nI win the day ye shall go with me to victory and honour. I will give\nyou oxen and wives, and ye shall take place of all the regiments; and\nif ye fall, I will fall with you.\n\n\"And behold, I give you this promise, that when I sit upon the seat of\nmy fathers, bloodshed shall cease in the land. No longer shall ye cry\nfor justice to find slaughter, no longer shall the witch-finder hunt\nyou out so that ye may be slain without a cause. No man shall die save\nhe who offends against the laws. The 'eating up' of your kraals shall\ncease; each one of you shall sleep secure in his own hut and fear\nnaught, and justice shall walk blindfold throughout the land. Have ye\nchosen, chiefs, captains, soldiers, and people?\"\n\n\"We have chosen, O king,\" came back the answer.\n\n\"It is well. Turn your heads and see how Twala's messengers go forth\nfrom the great town, east and west, and north and south, to gather a\nmighty army to slay me and you, and these my friends and protectors.\nTo-morrow, or perchance the next day, he will come against us with all\nwho are faithful to him. Then I shall see the man who is indeed my man,\nthe man who fears not to die for his cause; and I tell you that he\nshall not be forgotten in the time of spoil. I have spoken, O chiefs,\ncaptains, soldiers, and people. Now go to your huts and make you ready\nfor war.\"\n\nThere was a pause, till presently one of the chiefs lifted his hand,\nand out rolled the royal salute, \"_Koom._\" It was a sign that the\nsoldiers accepted Ignosi as their king. Then they marched off in\nbattalions.\n\nHalf an hour afterwards we held a council of war, at which all the\ncommanders of regiments were present. It was evident to us that before\nvery long we should be attacked in overwhelming force. Indeed, from our\npoint of vantage on the hill we could see troops mustering, and runners\ngoing forth from Loo in every direction, doubtless to summon soldiers\nto the king's assistance. We had on our side about twenty thousand men,\ncomposed of seven of the best regiments in the country. Twala, so\nInfadoos and the chiefs calculated, had at least thirty to thirty-five\nthousand on whom he could rely at present assembled in Loo, and they\nthought that by midday on the morrow he would be able to gather another\nfive thousand or more to his aid. It was, of course, possible that some\nof his troops would desert and come over to us, but it was not a\ncontingency which could be reckoned on. Meanwhile, it was clear that\nactive preparations were being made by Twala to subdue us. Already\nstrong bodies of armed men were patrolling round and round the foot of\nthe hill, and there were other signs also of coming assault.\n\nInfadoos and the chiefs, however, were of opinion that no attack would\ntake place that day, which would be devoted to preparation and to the\nremoval of every available means of the moral effect produced upon the\nminds of the soldiery by the supposed magical darkening of the moon.\nThe onslaught would be on the morrow, they said, and they proved to be\nright.\n\nMeanwhile, we set to work to strengthen the position in all ways\npossible. Almost every man was turned out, and in the course of the\nday, which seemed far too short, much was done. The paths up the\nhill--that was rather a sanatorium than a fortress, being used\ngenerally as the camping place of regiments suffering from recent\nservice in unhealthy portions of the country--were carefully blocked\nwith masses of stones, and every other approach was made as impregnable\nas time would allow. Piles of boulders were collected at various spots\nto be rolled down upon an advancing enemy, stations were appointed to\nthe different regiments, and all preparation was made which our joint\ningenuity could suggest.\n\nJust before sundown, as we rested after our toil, we perceived a small\ncompany of men advancing towards us from the direction of Loo, one of\nwhom bore a palm leaf in his hand for a sign that he came as a herald.\n\nAs he drew near, Ignosi, Infadoos, one or two chiefs and ourselves,\nwent down to the foot of the mountain to meet him. He was a\ngallant-looking fellow, wearing the regulation leopard-skin cloak.\n\n\"Greeting!\" he cried, as he came; \"the king's greeting to those who\nmake unholy war against the king; the lion's greeting to the jackals\nthat snarl around his heels.\"\n\n\"Speak,\" I said.\n\n\"These are the king's words. Surrender to the king's mercy ere a worse\nthing befall you. Already the shoulder has been torn from the black\nbull, and the king drives him bleeding about the camp.\"[1]\n\n\"What are Twala's terms?\" I asked from curiosity.\n\n\"His terms are merciful, worthy of a great king. These are the words of\nTwala, the one-eyed, the mighty, the husband of a thousand wives, lord\nof the Kukuanas, keeper of the Great Road (Solomon's Road), beloved of\nthe Strange Ones who sit in silence at the mountains yonder (the Three\nWitches), Calf of the Black Cow, Elephant whose tread shakes the earth,\nTerror of the evil-doer, Ostrich whose feet devour the desert, huge\nOne, black One, wise One, king from generation to generation! these are\nthe words of Twala: 'I will have mercy and be satisfied with a little\nblood. One in every ten shall die, the rest shall go free; but the\nwhite man Incubu, who slew Scragga my son, and the black man his\nservant, who pretends to my throne, and Infadoos my brother, who brews\nrebellion against me, these shall die by torture as an offering to the\nSilent Ones.' Such are the merciful words of Twala.\"\n\nAfter consulting with the others a little, I answered him in a loud\nvoice, so that the soldiers might hear, thus--\n\n\"Go back, thou dog, to Twala, who sent thee, and say that we, Ignosi,\nveritable king of the Kukuanas, Incubu, Bougwan, and Macumazahn, the\nwise ones from the Stars, who make dark the moon, Infadoos, of the\nroyal house, and the chiefs, captains, and people here gathered, make\nanswer and say, 'That we will not surrender; that before the sun has\ngone down twice, Twala's corpse shall stiffen at Twala's gate, and\nIgnosi, whose father Twala slew, shall reign in his stead.' Now go, ere\nwe whip thee away, and beware how thou dost lift a hand against such as\nwe are.\"\n\nThe herald laughed loudly. \"Ye frighten not men with such swelling\nwords,\" he cried out. \"Show yourselves as bold to-morrow, O ye who\ndarken the moon. Be bold, fight, and be merry, before the crows pick\nyour bones till they are whiter than your faces. Farewell; perhaps we\nmay meet in the fight; fly not to the Stars, but wait for me, I pray,\nwhite men.\" With this shaft of sarcasm he retired, and almost\nimmediately the sun sank.\n\nThat night was a busy one, for weary as we were, so far as was possible\nby the moonlight all preparations for the morrow's fight were\ncontinued, and messengers were constantly coming and going from the\nplace where we sat in council. At last, about an hour after midnight,\neverything that could be done was done, and the camp, save for the\noccasional challenge of a sentry, sank into silence. Sir Henry and I,\naccompanied by Ignosi and one of the chiefs, descended the hill and\nmade a round of the pickets. As we went, suddenly, from all sorts of\nunexpected places, spears gleamed out in the moonlight, only to vanish\nagain when we uttered the password. It was clear to us that none were\nsleeping at their posts. Then we returned, picking our way warily\nthrough thousands of sleeping warriors, many of whom were taking their\nlast earthly rest.\n\nThe moonlight flickering along their spears, played upon their features\nand made them ghastly; the chilly night wind tossed their tall and\nhearse-like plumes. There they lay in wild confusion, with arms\noutstretched and twisted limbs; their stern, stalwart forms looking\nweird and unhuman in the moonlight.\n\n\"How many of these do you suppose will be alive at this time\nto-morrow?\" asked Sir Henry.\n\nI shook my head and looked again at the sleeping men, and to my tired\nand yet excited imagination it seemed as though Death had already\ntouched them. My mind's eye singled out those who were sealed to\nslaughter, and there rushed in upon my heart a great sense of the\nmystery of human life, and an overwhelming sorrow at its futility and\nsadness. To-night these thousands slept their healthy sleep, to-morrow\nthey, and many others with them, ourselves perhaps among them, would be\nstiffening in the cold; their wives would be widows, their children\nfatherless, and their place know them no more for ever. Only the old\nmoon would shine on serenely, the night wind would stir the grasses,\nand the wide earth would take its rest, even as it did aeons before we\nwere, and will do aeons after we have been forgotten.\n\nYet man dies not whilst the world, at once his mother and his monument,\nremains. His name is lost, indeed, but the breath he breathed still\nstirs the pine-tops on the mountains, the sound of the words he spoke\nyet echoes on through space; the thoughts his brain gave birth to we\nhave inherited to-day; his passions are our cause of life; the joys and\nsorrows that he knew are our familiar friends--the end from which he\nfled aghast will surely overtake us also!\n\nTruly the universe is full of ghosts, not sheeted churchyard spectres,\nbut the inextinguishable elements of individual life, which having once\nbeen, can never _die_, though they blend and change, and change again\nfor ever.\n\n\nAll sorts of reflections of this nature passed through my mind--for as\nI grow older I regret to say that a detestable habit of thinking seems\nto be getting a hold of me--while I stood and stared at those grim yet\nfantastic lines of warriors, sleeping, as their saying goes, \"upon\ntheir spears.\"\n\n\"Curtis,\" I said, \"I am in a condition of pitiable fear.\"\n\nSir Henry stroked his yellow beard and laughed, as he answered--\n\n\"I have heard you make that sort of remark before, Quatermain.\"\n\n\"Well, I mean it now. Do you know, I very much doubt if one of us will\nbe alive to-morrow night. We shall be attacked in overwhelming force,\nand it is quite a chance if we can hold this place.\"\n\n\"We'll give a good account of some of them, at any rate. Look here,\nQuatermain, this business is nasty, and one with which, properly\nspeaking, we ought not to be mixed up, but we are in for it, so we must\nmake the best of our job. Speaking personally, I had rather be killed\nfighting than any other way, and now that there seems little chance of\nour finding my poor brother, it makes the idea easier to me. But\nfortune favours the brave, and we may succeed. Anyway, the battle will\nbe awful, and having a reputation to keep up, we shall need to be in\nthe thick of the thing.\"\n\nHe made this last remark in a mournful voice, but there was a gleam in\nhis eye which belied its melancholy. I have an idea Sir Henry Curtis\nactually likes fighting.\n\nAfter this we went to sleep for a couple of hours or so.\n\nJust about dawn we were awakened by Infadoos, who came to say that\ngreat activity was to be observed in Loo, and that parties of the\nking's skirmishers were driving in our outposts.\n\nWe rose and dressed ourselves for the fray, each putting on his chain\narmour shirt, for which garments at the present juncture we felt\nexceedingly thankful. Sir Henry went the whole length about the matter,\nand dressed himself like a native warrior. \"When you are in\nKukuanaland, do as the Kukuanas do,\" he remarked, as he drew the\nshining steel over his broad breast, which it fitted like a glove. Nor\ndid he stop there. At his request Infadoos had provided him with a\ncomplete set of native war uniform. Round his throat he fastened the\nleopard-skin cloak of a commanding officer, on his brows he bound the\nplume of black ostrich feathers worn only by generals of high rank, and\nabout his middle a magnificent moocha of white ox-tails. A pair of\nsandals, a leglet of goat's hair, a heavy battle-axe with a\nrhinoceros-horn handle, a round iron shield covered with white ox-hide,\nand the regulation number of _tollas_, or throwing-knives, made up his\nequipment, to which, however, he added his revolver. The dress was, no\ndoubt, a savage one, but I am bound to say that I seldom saw a finer\nsight than Sir Henry Curtis presented in this guise. It showed off his\nmagnificent physique to the greatest advantage, and when Ignosi arrived\npresently, arrayed in a similar costume, I thought to myself that I had\nnever before seen two such splendid men.\n\nAs for Good and myself, the armour did not suit us nearly so well. To\nbegin with, Good insisted upon keeping on his new-found trousers, and a\nstout, short gentleman with an eye-glass, and one half of his face\nshaved, arrayed in a mail shirt, carefully tucked into a very seedy\npair of corduroys, looks more remarkable than imposing. In my case, the\nchain shirt being too big for me, I put it on over all my clothes,\nwhich caused it to bulge in a somewhat ungainly fashion. I discarded my\ntrousers, however, retaining only my veldtschoons, having determined to\ngo into battle with bare legs, in order to be the lighter for running,\nin case it became necessary to retire quickly. The mail coat, a spear,\na shield, that I did not know how to use, a couple of _tollas_, a\nrevolver, and a huge plume, which I pinned into the top of my shooting\nhat, in order to give a bloodthirsty finish to my appearance, completed\nmy modest equipment. In addition to all these articles, of course we\nhad our rifles, but as ammunition was scarce, and as they would be\nuseless in case of a charge, we arranged that they should be carried\nbehind us by bearers.\n\nWhen at length we had equipped ourselves, we swallowed some food\nhastily, and then started out to see how things were going on. At one\npoint in the table-land of the mountain, there was a little koppie of\nbrown stone, which served the double purpose of head-quarters and of a\nconning tower. Here we found Infadoos surrounded by his own regiment,\nthe Greys, which was undoubtedly the finest in the Kukuana army, and\nthe same that we had first seen at the outlying kraal. This regiment,\nnow three thousand five hundred strong, was being held in reserve, and\nthe men were lying down on the grass in companies, and watching the\nking's forces creep out of Loo in long ant-like columns. There seemed\nto be no end to the length of these columns--three in all, and each of\nthem numbering, as we judged, at least eleven or twelve thousand men.\n\nAs soon as they were clear of the town the regiments formed up. Then\none body marched off to the right, one to the left, and the third came\non slowly towards us.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Infadoos, \"they are going to attack us on three sides at\nonce.\"\n\nThis seemed rather serious news, for our position on the top of the\nmountain, which measured a mile and a half in circumference, being an\nextended one, it was important to us to concentrate our comparatively\nsmall defending force as much as possible. But since it was impossible\nfor us to dictate in what way we should be assailed, we had to make the\nbest of it, and accordingly sent orders to the various regiments to\nprepare to receive the separate onslaughts.\n\n\n[1] This cruel custom is not confined to the Kukuanas, but is by no\nmeans uncommon amongst African tribes on the occasion of the outbreak\nof war or any other important public event.--A.Q.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE ATTACK\n\nSlowly, and without the slightest appearance of haste or excitement,\nthe three columns crept on. When within about five hundred yards of us,\nthe main or centre column halted at the root of a tongue of open plain\nwhich ran up into the hill, to give time to the other divisions to\ncircumvent our position, which was shaped more or less in the form of a\nhorse-shoe, with its two points facing towards the town of Loo. The\nobject of this manoeuvre was that the threefold assault should be\ndelivered simultaneously.\n\n\"Oh, for a gatling!\" groaned Good, as he contemplated the serried\nphalanxes beneath us. \"I would clear that plain in twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"We have not got one, so it is no use yearning for it; but suppose you\ntry a shot, Quatermain,\" said Sir Henry. \"See how near you can go to\nthat tall fellow who appears to be in command. Two to one you miss him,\nand an even sovereign, to be honestly paid if ever we get out of this,\nthat you don't drop the bullet within five yards.\"\n\n\nThis piqued me, so, loading the express with solid ball, I waited till\nmy friend walked some ten yards out from his force, in order to get a\nbetter view of our position, accompanied only by an orderly; then,\nlying down and resting the express on a rock, I covered him. The rifle,\nlike all expresses, was only sighted to three hundred and fifty yards,\nso to allow for the drop in trajectory I took him half-way down the\nneck, which ought, I calculated, to find him in the chest. He stood\nquite still and gave me every opportunity, but whether it was the\nexcitement or the wind, or the fact of the man being a long shot, I\ndon't know, but this was what happened. Getting dead on, as I thought,\na fine sight, I pressed, and when the puff of smoke had cleared away,\nto my disgust, I saw my man standing there unharmed, whilst his\norderly, who was at least three paces to the left, was stretched upon\nthe ground apparently dead. Turning swiftly, the officer I had aimed at\nbegan to run towards his men in evident alarm.\n\n\"Bravo, Quatermain!\" sang out Good; \"you've frightened him.\"\n\nThis made me very angry, for, if possible to avoid it, I hate to miss\nin public. When a man is master of only one art he likes to keep up his\nreputation in that art. Moved quite out of myself at my failure, I did\na rash thing. Rapidly covering the general as he ran, I let drive with\nthe second barrel. Instantly the poor man threw up his arms, and fell\nforward on to his face. This time I had made no mistake; and--I say it\nas a proof of how little we think of others when our own safety, pride,\nor reputation is in question--I was brute enough to feel delighted at\nthe sight.\n\nThe regiments who had seen the feat cheered wildly at this exhibition\nof the white man's magic, which they took as an omen of success, while\nthe force the general had belonged to--which, indeed, as we ascertained\nafterwards, he had commanded--fell back in confusion. Sir Henry and\nGood now took up their rifles and began to fire, the latter\nindustriously \"browning\" the dense mass before him with another\nWinchester repeater, and I also had another shot or two, with the\nresult, so far as we could judge, that we put some six or eight men\n_hors de combat_ before they were out of range.\n\nJust as we stopped firing there came an ominous roar from our far\nright, then a similar roar rose on our left. The two other divisions\nwere engaging us.\n\nAt the sound, the mass of men before us opened out a little, and\nadvanced towards the hill and up the spit of bare grass land at a slow\ntrot, singing a deep-throated song as they ran. We kept up a steady\nfire from our rifles as they came, Ignosi joining in occasionally, and\naccounted for several men, but of course we produced no more effect\nupon that mighty rush of armed humanity than he who throws pebbles does\non the breaking wave.\n\nOn they came, with a shout and the clashing of spears; now they were\ndriving in the pickets we had placed among the rocks at the foot of the\nhill. After that the advance was a little slower, for though as yet we\nhad offered no serious opposition, the attacking forces must climb up\nhill, and they came slowly to save their breath. Our first line of\ndefence was about half-way down the side of the slope, our second fifty\nyards further back, while our third occupied the edge of the plateau.\n\nOn they stormed, shouting their war-cry, \"_Twala! Twala! Chiele!\nChiele!_\" (Twala! Twala! Smite! Smite!) \"_Ignosi! Ignosi! Chiele!\nChiele!_\" answered our people. They were quite close now, and the\n_tollas_, or throwing-knives, began to flash backwards and forwards,\nand now with an awful yell the battle closed in.\n\nTo and fro swayed the mass of struggling warriors, men falling fast as\nleaves in an autumn wind; but before long the superior weight of the\nattacking force began to tell, and our first line of defence was slowly\npressed back till it merged into the second. Here the struggle was very\nfierce, but again our people were driven back and up, till at length,\nwithin twenty minutes of the commencement of the fight, our third line\ncame into action.\n\nBut by this time the assailants were much exhausted, and besides had\nlost many men killed and wounded, and to break through that third\nimpenetrable hedge of spears proved beyond their powers. For a while\nthe seething lines of savages swung backwards and forwards, in the\nfierce ebb and flow of battle, and the issue was doubtful. Sir Henry\nwatched the desperate struggle with a kindling eye, and then without a\nword he rushed off, followed by Good, and flung himself into the\nhottest of the fray. As for myself, I stopped where I was.\n\nThe soldiers caught sight of his tall form as he plunged into battle,\nand there rose a cry of--\n\n\"_Nanzia Incubu! Nanzia Unkungunklovo!_\" (Here is the Elephant!)\n\"_Chiele! Chiele!_\"\n\nFrom that moment the end was no longer in doubt. Inch by inch, fighting\nwith splendid gallantry, the attacking force was pressed back down the\nhillside, till at last it retreated upon its reserves in something like\nconfusion. At that instant, too, a messenger arrived to say that the\nleft attack had been repulsed; and I was just beginning to congratulate\nmyself, believing that the affair was over for the present, when, to\nour horror, we perceived our men who had been engaged in the right\ndefence being driven towards us across the plain, followed by swarms of\nthe enemy, who had evidently succeeded at this point.\n\nIgnosi, who was standing by me, took in the situation at a glance, and\nissued a rapid order. Instantly the reserve regiment around us, the\nGreys, extended itself.\n\nAgain Ignosi gave a word of command, which was taken up and repeated by\nthe captains, and in another second, to my intense disgust, I found\nmyself involved in a furious onslaught upon the advancing foe. Getting\nas much as I could behind Ignosi's huge frame, I made the best of a bad\njob, and toddled along to be killed as though I liked it. In a minute\nor two--we were plunging through the flying groups of our men, who at\nonce began to re-form behind us, and then I am sure I do not know what\nhappened. All I can remember is a dreadful rolling noise of the meeting\nof shields, and the sudden apparition of a huge ruffian, whose eyes\nseemed literally to be starting out of his head, making straight at me\nwith a bloody spear. But--I say it with pride--I rose--or rather\nsank--to the occasion. It was one before which most people would have\ncollapsed once and for all. Seeing that if I stood where I was I must\nbe killed, as the horrid apparition came I flung myself down in front\nof him so cleverly that, being unable to stop himself, he took a header\nright over my prostrate form. Before he could rise again, _I_ had risen\nand settled the matter from behind with my revolver.\n\nShortly after this somebody knocked me down, and I remember no more of\nthat charge.\n\nWhen I came to I found myself back at the koppie, with Good bending\nover me holding some water in a gourd.\n\n\"How do you feel, old fellow?\" he asked anxiously.\n\nI got up and shook myself before replying.\n\n\"Pretty well, thank you,\" I answered.\n\n\"Thank Heaven! When I saw them carry you in, I felt quite sick; I\nthought you were done for.\"\n\n\"Not this time, my boy. I fancy I only got a rap on the head, which\nknocked me stupid. How has it ended?\"\n\n\"They are repulsed at every point for a while. The loss is dreadfully\nheavy; we have quite two thousand killed and wounded, and they must\nhave lost three. Look, there's a sight!\" and he pointed to long lines\nof men advancing by fours.\n\nIn the centre of every group of four, and being borne by it, was a kind\nof hide tray, of which a Kukuana force always carries a quantity, with\na loop for a handle at each corner. On these trays--and their number\nseemed endless--lay wounded men, who as they arrived were hastily\nexamined by the medicine men, of whom ten were attached to a regiment.\nIf the wound was not of a fatal character the sufferer was taken away\nand attended to as carefully as circumstances would allow. But if, on\nthe other hand, the injured man's condition proved hopeless, what\nfollowed was very dreadful, though doubtless it may have been the\ntruest mercy. One of the doctors, under pretence of carrying out an\nexamination, swiftly opened an artery with a sharp knife, and in a\nminute or two the sufferer expired painlessly. There were many cases\nthat day in which this was done. In fact, it was done in the majority\nof cases when the wound was in the body, for the gash made by the entry\nof the enormously broad spears used by the Kukuanas generally rendered\nrecovery impossible. In most instances the poor sufferers were already\nunconscious, and in others the fatal \"nick\" of the artery was inflicted\nso swiftly and painlessly that they did not seem to notice it. Still it\nwas a ghastly sight, and one from which we were glad to escape; indeed,\nI never remember anything of the kind that affected me more than seeing\nthose gallant soldiers thus put out of pain by the red-handed medicine\nmen, except, indeed, on one occasion when, after an attack, I saw a\nforce of Swazis burying their hopelessly wounded _alive_.\n\nHurrying from this dreadful scene to the further side of the koppie, we\nfound Sir Henry, who still held a battle-axe in his hand, Ignosi,\nInfadoos, and one or two of the chiefs in deep consultation.\n\n\"Thank Heaven, here you are, Quatermain! I can't quite make out what\nIgnosi wants to do. It seems that though we have beaten off the attack,\nTwala is now receiving large reinforcements, and is showing a\ndisposition to invest us, with the view of starving us out.\"\n\n\"That's awkward.\"\n\n\"Yes; especially as Infadoos says that the water supply has given out.\"\n\n\"My lord, that is so,\" said Infadoos; \"the spring cannot supply the\nwants of so great a multitude, and it is failing rapidly. Before night\nwe shall all be thirsty. Listen, Macumazahn. Thou art wise, and hast\ndoubtless seen many wars in the lands from whence thou camest--that is\nif indeed they make wars in the Stars. Now tell us, what shall we do?\nTwala has brought up many fresh men to take the place of those who have\nfallen. Yet Twala has learnt his lesson; the hawk did not think to find\nthe heron ready; but our beak has pierced his breast; he fears to\nstrike at us again. We too are wounded, and he will wait for us to die;\nhe will wind himself round us like a snake round a buck, and fight the\nfight of 'sit down.'\"\n\n\"I hear thee,\" I said.\n\n\"So, Macumazahn, thou seest we have no water here, and but a little\nfood, and we must choose between these three things--to languish like a\nstarving lion in his den, or to strive to break away towards the north,\nor\"--and here he rose and pointed towards the dense mass of our\nfoes--\"to launch ourselves straight at Twala's throat. Incubu, the\ngreat warrior--for to-day he fought like a buffalo in a net, and\nTwala's soldiers went down before his axe like young corn before the\nhail; with these eyes I saw it--Incubu says 'Charge'; but the Elephant\nis ever prone to charge. Now what says Macumazahn, the wily old fox,\nwho has seen much, and loves to bite his enemy from behind? The last\nword is in Ignosi the king, for it is a king's right to speak of war;\nbut let us hear thy voice, O Macumazahn, who watchest by night, and the\nvoice too of him of the transparent eye.\"\n\n\"What sayest thou, Ignosi,\" I asked.\n\n\"Nay, my father,\" answered our quondam servant, who now, clad as he was\nin the full panoply of savage war, looked every inch a warrior king,\n\"do thou speak, and let me, who am but a child in wisdom beside thee,\nhearken to thy words.\"\n\nThus adjured, after taking hasty counsel with Good and Sir Henry, I\ndelivered my opinion briefly to the effect that, being trapped, our\nbest chance, especially in view of the failure of our water supply, was\nto initiate an attack upon Twala's forces. Then I recommended that the\nattack should be delivered at once, \"before our wounds grew stiff,\" and\nalso before the sight of Twala's overpowering force caused the hearts\nof our soldiers \"to wax small like fat before a fire.\" Otherwise, I\npointed out, some of the captains might change their minds, and, making\npeace with Twala, desert to him, or even betray us into his hands.\n\nThis expression of opinion seemed, on the whole, to be favourably\nreceived; indeed, among the Kukuanas my utterances met with a respect\nwhich has never been accorded to them before or since. But the real\ndecision as to our plans lay with Ignosi, who, since he had been\nrecognised as rightful king, could exercise the almost unbounded rights\nof sovereignty, including, of course, the final decision on matters of\ngeneralship, and it was to him that all eyes were now turned.\n\nAt length, after a pause, during which he appeared to be thinking\ndeeply, he spoke.\n\n\"Incubu, Macumazahn, and Bougwan, brave white men, and my friends;\nInfadoos, my uncle, and chiefs; my heart is fixed. I will strike at\nTwala this day, and set my fortunes on the blow, ay, and my life--my\nlife and your lives also. Listen; thus will I strike. Ye see how the\nhill curves round like the half-moon, and how the plain runs like a\ngreen tongue towards us within the curve?\"\n\n\"We see,\" I answered.\n\n\"Good; it is now mid-day, and the men eat and rest after the toil of\nbattle. When the sun has turned and travelled a little way towards the\ndarkness, let thy regiment, my uncle, advance with one other down to\nthe green tongue, and it shall be that when Twala sees it he will hurl\nhis force at it to crush it. But the spot is narrow, and the regiments\ncan come against thee one at a time only; so may they be destroyed one\nby one, and the eyes of all Twala's army shall be fixed upon a struggle\nthe like of which has not been seen by living man. And with thee, my\nuncle, shall go Incubu my friend, that when Twala sees his battle-axe\nflashing in the first rank of the Greys his heart may grow faint. And I\nwill come with the second regiment, that which follows thee, so that if\nye are destroyed, as it might happen, there may yet be a king left to\nfight for; and with me shall come Macumazahn the wise.\"\n\n\"It is well, O king,\" said Infadoos, apparently contemplating the\ncertainty of the complete annihilation of his regiment with perfect\ncalmness. Truly, these Kukuanas are a wonderful people. Death has no\nterrors for them when it is incurred in the course of duty.\n\n\"And whilst the eyes of the multitude of Twala's soldiers are thus\nfixed upon the fight,\" went on Ignosi, \"behold, one-third of the men\nwho are left alive to us (i.e. about 6,000) shall creep along the right\nhorn of the hill and fall upon the left flank of Twala's force, and\none-third shall creep along the left horn and fall upon Twala's right\nflank. And when I see that the horns are ready to toss Twala, then will\nI, with the men who remain to me, charge home in Twala's face, and if\nfortune goes with us the day will be ours, and before Night drives her\nblack oxen from the mountains to the mountains we shall sit in peace at\nLoo. And now let us eat and make ready; and, Infadoos, do thou prepare,\nthat the plan be carried out without fail; and stay, let my white\nfather Bougwan go with the right horn, that his shining eye may give\ncourage to the captains.\"\n\nThe arrangements for attack thus briefly indicated were set in motion\nwith a rapidity that spoke well for the perfection of the Kukuana\nmilitary system. Within little more than an hour rations had been\nserved out and devoured, the divisions were formed, the scheme of\nonslaught was explained to the leaders, and the whole force, numbering\nabout 18,000 men, was ready to move, with the exception of a guard left\nin charge of the wounded.\n\nPresently Good came up to Sir Henry and myself.\n\n\"Good-bye, you fellows,\" he said; \"I am off with the right wing\naccording to orders; and so I have come to shake hands, in case we\nshould not meet again, you know,\" he added significantly.\n\nWe shook hands in silence, and not without the exhibition of as much\nemotion as Anglo-Saxons are wont to show.\n\n\"It is a queer business,\" said Sir Henry, his deep voice shaking a\nlittle, \"and I confess I never expect to see to-morrow's sun. So far as\nI can make out, the Greys, with whom I am to go, are to fight until\nthey are wiped out in order to enable the wings to slip round unawares\nand outflank Twala. Well, so be it; at any rate, it will be a man's\ndeath. Good-bye, old fellow. God bless you! I hope you will pull\nthrough and live to collar the diamonds; but if you do, take my advice\nand don't have anything more to do with Pretenders!\"\n\nIn another second Good had wrung us both by the hand and gone; and then\nInfadoos came up and led off Sir Henry to his place in the forefront of\nthe Greys, whilst, with many misgivings, I departed with Ignosi to my\nstation in the second attacking regiment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE LAST STAND OF THE GREYS\n\nIn a few more minutes the regiments destined to carry out the flanking\nmovements had tramped off in silence, keeping carefully to the lee of\nthe rising ground in order to conceal their advance from the keen eyes\nof Twala's scouts.\n\nHalf an hour or more was allowed to elapse between the setting out of\nthe horns or wings of the army before any stir was made by the Greys\nand their supporting regiment, known as the Buffaloes, which formed its\nchest, and were destined to bear the brunt of the battle.\n\nBoth of these regiments were almost perfectly fresh, and of full\nstrength, the Greys having been in reserve in the morning, and having\nlost but a small number of men in sweeping back that part of the attack\nwhich had proved successful in breaking the line of defence, on the\noccasion when I charged with them and was stunned for my pains. As for\nthe Buffaloes, they had formed the third line of defence on the left,\nand since the attacking force at that point had not succeeded in\nbreaking through the second, they had scarcely come into action at all.\n\nInfadoos, who was a wary old general, and knew the absolute importance\nof keeping up the spirits of his men on the eve of such a desperate\nencounter, employed the pause in addressing his own regiment, the\nGreys, in poetical language: explaining to them the honour that they\nwere receiving in being put thus in the forefront of the battle, and in\nhaving the great white warrior from the Stars to fight with them in\ntheir ranks; and promising large rewards of cattle and promotion to all\nwho survived in the event of Ignosi's arms being successful.\n\nI looked down the long lines of waving black plumes and stern faces\nbeneath them, and sighed to think that within one short hour most, if\nnot all, of those magnificent veteran warriors, not a man of whom was\nunder forty years of age, would be laid dead or dying in the dust. It\ncould not be otherwise; they were being condemned, with that wise\nrecklessness of human life which marks the great general, and often\nsaves his forces and attains his ends, to certain slaughter, in order\nto give their cause and the remainder of the army a chance of success.\nThey were foredoomed to die, and they knew the truth. It was to be\ntheir task to engage regiment after regiment of Twala's army on the\nnarrow strip of green beneath us, till they were exterminated or till\nthe wings found a favourable opportunity for their onslaught. And yet\nthey never hesitated, nor could I detect a sign of fear upon the face\nof a single warrior. There they were--going to certain death, about to\nquit the blessed light of day for ever, and yet able to contemplate\ntheir doom without a tremor. Even at that moment I could not help\ncontrasting their state of mind with my own, which was far from\ncomfortable, and breathing a sigh of envy and admiration. Never before\nhad I seen such an absolute devotion to the idea of duty, and such a\ncomplete indifference to its bitter fruits.\n\n\"Behold your king!\" ended old Infadoos, pointing to Ignosi; \"go fight\nand fall for him, as is the duty of brave men, and cursed and shameful\nfor ever be the name of him who shrinks from death for his king, or who\nturns his back to the foe. Behold your king, chiefs, captains, and\nsoldiers! Now do your homage to the sacred Snake, and then follow on,\nthat Incubu and I may show you a road to the heart of Twala's host.\"\n\nThere was a moment's pause, then suddenly a murmur arose from the\nserried phalanxes before us, a sound like the distant whisper of the\nsea, caused by the gentle tapping of the handles of six thousand spears\nagainst their holders' shields. Slowly it swelled, till its growing\nvolume deepened and widened into a roar of rolling noise, that echoed\nlike thunder against the mountains, and filled the air with heavy waves\nof sound. Then it decreased, and by faint degrees died away into\nnothing, and suddenly out crashed the royal salute.\n\nIgnosi, I thought to myself, might well be a proud man that day, for no\nRoman emperor ever had such a salutation from gladiators \"about to die.\"\n\nIgnosi acknowledged this magnificent act of homage by lifting his\nbattle-axe, and then the Greys filed off in a triple-line formation,\neach line containing about one thousand fighting men, exclusive of\nofficers. When the last companies had advanced some five hundred yards,\nIgnosi put himself at the head of the Buffaloes, which regiment was\ndrawn up in a similar three-fold formation, and gave the word to march,\nand off we went, I, needless to say, uttering the most heartfelt\nprayers that I might emerge from that entertainment with a whole skin.\nMany a queer position have I found myself in, but never before in one\nquite so unpleasant as the present, or one in which my chance of coming\noff safe was smaller.\n\nBy the time that we reached the edge of the plateau the Greys were\nalready half-way down the slope ending in the tongue of grass land that\nran up into the bend of the mountain, something as the frog of a\nhorse's foot runs up into the shoe. The excitement in Twala's camp on\nthe plain beyond was very great, and regiment after regiment was\nstarting forward at a long swinging trot in order to reach the root of\nthe tongue of land before the attacking force could emerge into the\nplain of Loo.\n\nThis tongue, which was some four hundred yards in depth, even at its\nroot or widest part was not more than six hundred and fifty paces\nacross, while at its tip it scarcely measured ninety. The Greys, who,\nin passing down the side of the hill and on to the tip of the tongue,\nhad formed into a column, on reaching the spot where it broadened out\nagain, reassumed their triple-line formation, and halted dead.\n\nThen we--that is, the Buffaloes--moved down the tip of the tongue and\ntook our stand in reserve, about one hundred yards behind the last line\nof the Greys, and on slightly higher ground. Meanwhile we had leisure\nto observe Twala's entire force, which evidently had been reinforced\nsince the morning attack, and could not now, notwithstanding their\nlosses, number less than forty thousand, moving swiftly up towards us.\nBut as they drew near the root of the tongue they hesitated, having\ndiscovered that only one regiment could advance into the gorge at a\ntime, and that there, some seventy yards from the mouth of it,\nunassailable except in front, on account of the high walls of\nboulder-strewn ground on each side, stood the famous regiment of Greys,\nthe pride and glory of the Kukuana army, ready to hold the way against\ntheir power as the three Romans once held the bridge against thousands.\n\nThey hesitated, and finally stopped their advance; there was no\neagerness to cross spears with these three grim ranks of warriors who\nstood so firm and ready. Presently, however, a tall general, wearing\nthe customary head-dress of nodding ostrich plumes, appeared, attended\nby a group of chiefs and orderlies, being, I thought, none other than\nTwala himself. He gave an order, and the first regiment, raising a\nshout, charged up towards the Greys, who remained perfectly still and\nsilent till the attacking troops were within forty yards, and a volley\nof _tollas_, or throwing-knives, came rattling among their ranks.\n\nThen suddenly with a bound and a roar, they sprang forward with\nuplifted spears, and the regiment met in deadly strife. Next second the\nroll of the meeting shields came to our ears like the sound of thunder,\nand the plain seemed to be alive with flashes of light reflected from\nthe shimmering spears. To and fro swung the surging mass of struggling,\nstabbing humanity, but not for long. Suddenly the attacking lines began\nto grow thinner, and then with a slow, long heave the Greys passed over\nthem, just as a great wave heaves up its bulk and passes over a sunken\nridge. It was done; that regiment was completely destroyed, but the\nGreys had but two lines left now; a third of their number were dead.\n\nClosing up shoulder to shoulder, once more they halted in silence and\nawaited attack; and I was rejoiced to catch sight of Sir Henry's yellow\nbeard as he moved to and fro arranging the ranks. So he was yet alive!\n\nMeanwhile we moved on to the ground of the encounter, which was\ncumbered by about four thousand prostrate human beings, dead, dying,\nand wounded, and literally stained red with blood. Ignosi issued an\norder, which was rapidly passed down the ranks, to the effect that none\nof the enemy's wounded were to be killed, and so far as we could see\nthis command was scrupulously carried out. It would have been a\nshocking sight, if we had found time to think of such things.\n\nBut now a second regiment, distinguished by white plumes, kilts, and\nshields, was moving to the attack of the two thousand remaining Greys,\nwho stood waiting in the same ominous silence as before, till the foe\nwas within forty yards or so, when they hurled themselves with\nirresistible force upon them. Again there came the awful roll of the\nmeeting shields, and as we watched the tragedy repeated itself.\n\nBut this time the issue was left longer in doubt; indeed, it seemed for\nawhile almost impossible that the Greys should again prevail. The\nattacking regiment, which was formed of young men, fought with the\nutmost fury, and at first seemed by sheer weight to be driving the\nveterans back. The slaughter was truly awful, hundreds falling every\nminute; and from among the shouts of the warriors and the groans of the\ndying, set to the music of clashing spears, came a continuous hissing\nundertone of \"_S'gee, s'gee_,\" the note of triumph of each victor as he\npassed his assegai through and through the body of his fallen foe.\n\nBut perfect discipline and steady and unchanging valour can do wonders,\nand one veteran soldier is worth two young ones, as soon became\napparent in the present case. For just when we thought that it was all\nover with the Greys, and were preparing to take their place so soon as\nthey made room by being destroyed, I heard Sir Henry's deep voice\nringing out through the din, and caught a glimpse of his circling\nbattle-axe as he waved it high above his plumes. Then came a change;\nthe Greys ceased to give; they stood still as a rock, against which the\nfurious waves of spearmen broke again and again, only to recoil.\nPresently they began to move once more--forward this time; as they had\nno firearms there was no smoke, so we could see it all. Another minute\nand the onslaught grew fainter.\n\n\"Ah, these are _men_, indeed; they will conquer again,\" called out\nIgnosi, who was grinding his teeth with excitement at my side. \"See, it\nis done!\"\n\nSuddenly, like puffs of smoke from the mouth of a cannon, the attacking\nregiment broke away in flying groups, their white head-dresses\nstreaming behind them in the wind, and left their opponents victors,\nindeed, but, alas! no more a regiment. Of the gallant triple line,\nwhich forty minutes before had gone into action three thousand strong,\nthere remained at most some six hundred blood-spattered men; the rest\nwere under foot. And yet they cheered and waved their spears in\ntriumph, and then, instead of falling back upon us as we expected, they\nran forward, for a hundred yards or so, after the flying groups of\nfoemen, took possession of a rising knoll of ground, and, resuming\ntheir triple formation, formed a threefold ring around its base. And\nthere, thanks be to Heaven, standing on the top of the mound for a\nminute, I saw Sir Henry, apparently unharmed, and with him our old\nfriend Infadoos. Then Twala's regiments rolled down upon the doomed\nband, and once more the battle closed in.\n\nAs those who read this history will probably long ago have gathered, I\nam, to be honest, a bit of a coward, and certainly in no way given to\nfighting, though somehow it has often been my lot to get into\nunpleasant positions, and to be obliged to shed man's blood. But I have\nalways hated it, and kept my own blood as undiminished in quantity as\npossible, sometimes by a judicious use of my heels. At this moment,\nhowever, for the first time in my life, I felt my bosom burn with\nmartial ardour. Warlike fragments from the \"Ingoldsby Legends,\"\ntogether with numbers of sanguinary verses in the Old Testament, sprang\nup in my brain like mushrooms in the dark; my blood, which hitherto had\nbeen half-frozen with horror, went beating through my veins, and there\ncame upon me a savage desire to kill and spare not. I glanced round at\nthe serried ranks of warriors behind us, and somehow, all in an\ninstant, I began to wonder if my face looked like theirs. There they\nstood, the hands twitching, the lips apart, the fierce features\ninstinct with the hungry lust of battle, and in the eyes a look like\nthe glare of a bloodhound when after long pursuit he sights his quarry.\n\nOnly Ignosi's heart, to judge from his comparative self-possession,\nseemed, to all appearances, to beat as calmly as ever beneath his\nleopard-skin cloak, though even _he_ still ground his teeth. I could\nbear it no longer.\n\n\"Are we to stand here till we put out roots, Umbopa--Ignosi, I\nmean--while Twala swallows our brothers yonder?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nay, Macumazahn,\" was the answer; \"see, now is the ripe moment: let us\npluck it.\"\n\nAs he spoke a fresh regiment rushed past the ring upon the little\nmound, and wheeling round, attacked it from the hither side.\n\nThen, lifting his battle-axe, Ignosi gave the signal to advance, and,\nscreaming the wild Kukuana war-cry, the Buffaloes charged home with a\nrush like the rush of the sea.\n\nWhat followed immediately on this it is out of my power to tell. All I\ncan remember is an irregular yet ordered advance, that seemed to shake\nthe ground; a sudden change of front and forming up on the part of the\nregiment against which the charge was directed; then an awful shock, a\ndull roar of voices, and a continuous flashing of spears, seen through\na red mist of blood.\n\nWhen my mind cleared I found myself standing inside the remnant of the\nGreys near the top of the mound, and just behind no less a person than\nSir Henry himself. How I got there I had at the moment no idea, but Sir\nHenry afterwards told me that I was borne up by the first furious\ncharge of the Buffaloes almost to his feet, and then left, as they in\nturn were pressed back. Thereon he dashed out of the circle and dragged\nme into shelter.\n\nAs for the fight that followed, who can describe it? Again and again\nthe multitudes surged against our momentarily lessening circle, and\nagain and again we beat them back.\n\n \"The stubborn spearmen still made good\n  The dark impenetrable wood,\n  Each stepping where his comrade stood\n    The instant that he fell,\"\n\nas someone or other beautifully says.\n\nIt was a splendid thing to see those brave battalions come on time\nafter time over the barriers of their dead, sometimes lifting corpses\nbefore them to receive our spear-thrusts, only to leave their own\ncorpses to swell the rising piles. It was a gallant sight to see that\nold warrior, Infadoos, as cool as though he were on parade, shouting\nout orders, taunts, and even jests, to keep up the spirit of his few\nremaining men, and then, as each charge rolled on, stepping forward to\nwherever the fighting was thickest, to bear his share in its repulse.\nAnd yet more gallant was the vision of Sir Henry, whose ostrich plumes\nhad been shorn off by a spear thrust, so that his long yellow hair\nstreamed out in the breeze behind him. There he stood, the great Dane,\nfor he was nothing else, his hands, his axe, and his armour all red\nwith blood, and none could live before his stroke. Time after time I\nsaw it sweeping down, as some great warrior ventured to give him\nbattle, and as he struck he shouted \"_O-hoy! O-hoy!_\" like his\nBerserkir forefathers, and the blow went crashing through shield and\nspear, through head-dress, hair, and skull, till at last none would of\ntheir own will come near the great white \"_umtagati_,\" the wizard, who\nkilled and failed not.\n\nBut suddenly there rose a cry of \"_Twala, y' Twala_,\" and out of the\npress sprang forward none other than the gigantic one-eyed king\nhimself, also armed with battle-axe and shield, and clad in chain\narmour.\n\n\"Where art thou, Incubu, thou white man, who slewest Scragga my\nson--see if thou canst slay me!\" he shouted, and at the same time\nhurled a _tolla_ straight at Sir Henry, who fortunately saw it coming,\nand caught it on his shield, which it transfixed, remaining wedged in\nthe iron plate behind the hide.\n\nThen, with a cry, Twala sprang forward straight at him, and with his\nbattle-axe struck him such a blow upon the shield that the mere force\nand shock of it brought Sir Henry, strong man as he is, down upon his\nknees.\n\nBut at this time the matter went no further, for that instant there\nrose from the regiments pressing round us something like a shout of\ndismay, and on looking up I saw the cause.\n\nTo the right and to the left the plain was alive with the plumes of\ncharging warriors. The outflanking squadrons had come to our relief.\nThe time could not have been better chosen. All Twala's army, as Ignosi\npredicted would be the case, had fixed their attention on the bloody\nstruggle which was raging round the remnant of the Greys and that of\nthe Buffaloes, who were now carrying on a battle of their own at a\nlittle distance, which two regiments had formed the chest of our army.\nIt was not until our horns were about to close upon them that they had\ndreamed of their approach, for they believed these forces to be hidden\nin reserve upon the crest of the moon-shaped hill. And now, before they\ncould even assume a proper formation for defence, the outflanking\n_Impis_ had leapt, like greyhounds, on their flanks.\n\nIn five minutes the fate of the battle was decided. Taken on both\nflanks, and dismayed at the awful slaughter inflicted upon them by the\nGreys and Buffaloes, Twala's regiments broke into flight, and soon the\nwhole plain between us and Loo was scattered with groups of running\nsoldiers making good their retreat. As for the hosts that had so\nrecently surrounded us and the Buffaloes, they melted away as though by\nmagic, and presently we were left standing there like a rock from which\nthe sea has retreated. But what a sight it was! Around us the dead and\ndying lay in heaped-up masses, and of the gallant Greys there remained\nbut ninety-five men upon their feet. More than three thousand four\nhundred had fallen in this one regiment, most of them never to rise\nagain.\n\n\"Men,\" said Infadoos calmly, as between the intervals of binding a\nwound on his arm he surveyed what remained to him of his corps, \"ye\nhave kept up the reputation of your regiment, and this day's fighting\nwill be well spoken of by your children's children.\" Then he turned\nround and shook Sir Henry Curtis by the hand. \"Thou art a great\ncaptain, Incubu,\" he said simply; \"I have lived a long life among\nwarriors, and have known many a brave one, yet have I never seen a man\nlike unto thee.\"\n\nAt this moment the Buffaloes began to march past our position on the\nroad to Loo, and as they went a message was brought to us from Ignosi\nrequesting Infadoos, Sir Henry, and myself to join them. Accordingly,\norders having been issued to the remaining ninety men of the Greys to\nemploy themselves in collecting the wounded, we joined Ignosi, who\ninformed us that he was pressing on to Loo to complete the victory by\ncapturing Twala, if that should be possible. Before we had gone far,\nsuddenly we discovered the figure of Good sitting on an ant-heap about\none hundred paces from us. Close beside him was the body of a Kukuana.\n\n\"He must be wounded,\" said Sir Henry anxiously. As he made the remark,\nan untoward thing happened. The dead body of the Kukuana soldier, or\nrather what had appeared to be his dead body, suddenly sprang up,\nknocked Good head over heels off the ant-heap, and began to spear him.\nWe rushed forward in terror, and as we drew near we saw the brawny\nwarrior making dig after dig at the prostrate Good, who at each prod\njerked all his limbs into the air. Seeing us coming, the Kukuana gave\none final and most vicious dig, and with a shout of \"Take that,\nwizard!\" bolted away. Good did not move, and we concluded that our poor\ncomrade was done for. Sadly we came towards him, and were astonished to\nfind him pale and faint indeed, but with a serene smile upon his face,\nand his eyeglass still fixed in his eye.\n\n\"Capital armour this,\" he murmured, on catching sight of our faces\nbending over him. \"How sold that beggar must have been,\" and then he\nfainted. On examination we discovered that he had been seriously\nwounded in the leg by a _tolla_ in the course of the pursuit, but that\nthe chain armour had prevented his last assailant's spear from doing\nanything more than bruise him badly. It was a merciful escape. As\nnothing could be done for him at the moment, he was placed on one of\nthe wicker shields used for the wounded, and carried along with us.\n\nOn arriving before the nearest gate of Loo we found one of our\nregiments watching it in obedience to orders received from Ignosi. The\nother regiments were in the same way guarding the different exits to\nthe town. The officer in command of this regiment saluted Ignosi as\nking, and informed him that Twala's army had taken refuge in the town,\nwhither Twala himself had also escaped, but he thought that they were\nthoroughly demoralised, and would surrender. Thereupon Ignosi, after\ntaking counsel with us, sent forward heralds to each gate ordering the\ndefenders to open, and promising on his royal word life and forgiveness\nto every soldier who laid down his arms, but saying that if they did\nnot do so before nightfall he would certainly burn the town and all\nwithin its gates. This message was not without its effect. Half an hour\nlater, amid the shouts and cheers of the Buffaloes, the bridge was\ndropped across the fosse, and the gates upon the further side were\nflung open.\n\nTaking due precautions against treachery, we marched on into the town.\nAll along the roadways stood thousands of dejected warriors, their\nheads drooping, and their shields and spears at their feet, who, headed\nby their officers, saluted Ignosi as king as he passed. On we marched,\nstraight to Twala's kraal. When we reached the great space, where a day\nor two previously we had seen the review and the witch hunt, we found\nit deserted. No, not quite deserted, for there, on the further side, in\nfront of his hut, sat Twala himself, with but one attendant--Gagool.\n\nIt was a melancholy sight to see him seated, his battle-axe and shield\nby his side, his chin upon his mailed breast, with but one old crone\nfor companion, and notwithstanding his crimes and misdeeds, a pang of\ncompassion shot through me as I looked upon Twala thus \"fallen from his\nhigh estate.\" Not a soldier of all his armies, not a courtier out of\nthe hundreds who had cringed round him, not even a solitary wife,\nremained to share his fate or halve the bitterness of his fall. Poor\nsavage! he was learning the lesson which Fate teaches to most of us who\nlive long enough, that the eyes of mankind are blind to the\ndiscredited, and that he who is defenceless and fallen finds few\nfriends and little mercy. Nor, indeed, in this case did he deserve any.\n\nFiling through the kraal gate, we marched across the open space to\nwhere the ex-king sat. When within about fifty yards of him the\nregiment was halted, and accompanied only by a small guard we advanced\ntowards him, Gagool reviling us bitterly as we came. As we drew near,\nTwala, for the first time, lifted his plumed head, and fixed his one\neye, which seemed to flash with suppressed fury almost as brightly as\nthe great diamond bound round his forehead, upon his successful\nrival--Ignosi.\n\n\"Hail, O king!\" he said, with bitter mockery; \"thou who hast eaten of\nmy bread, and now by the aid of the white man's magic hast seduced my\nregiments and defeated mine army, hail! What fate hast thou in store\nfor me, O king?\"\n\n\"The fate thou gavest to my father, whose throne thou hast sat on these\nmany years!\" was the stern answer.\n\n\"It is good. I will show thee how to die, that thou mayest remember it\nagainst thine own time. See, the sun sinks in blood,\" and he pointed\nwith his battle-axe towards the setting orb; \"it is well that my sun\nshould go down in its company. And now, O king! I am ready to die, but\nI crave the boon of the Kukuana royal House[1] to die fighting. Thou\ncanst not refuse it, or even those cowards who fled to-day will hold thee\nshamed.\"\n\n\"It is granted. Choose--with whom wilt thou fight? Myself I cannot\nfight with thee, for the king fights not except in war.\"\n\nTwala's sombre eye ran up and down our ranks, and I felt, as for a\nmoment it rested on myself, that the position had developed a new\nhorror. What if he chose to begin by fighting _me_? What chance should\nI have against a desperate savage six feet five high, and broad in\nproportion? I might as well commit suicide at once. Hastily I made up\nmy mind to decline the combat, even if I were hooted out of Kukuanaland\nas a consequence. It is, I think, better to be hooted than to be\nquartered with a battle-axe.\n\nPresently Twala spoke.\n\n\"Incubu, what sayest thou, shall we end what we began to-day, or shall\nI call thee coward, white--even to the liver?\"\n\n\"Nay,\" interposed Ignosi hastily; \"thou shalt not fight with Incubu.\"\n\n\"Not if he is afraid,\" said Twala.\n\nUnfortunately Sir Henry understood this remark, and the blood flamed up\ninto his cheeks.\n\n\"I will fight him,\" he said; \"he shall see if I am afraid.\"\n\n\"For Heaven's sake,\" I entreated, \"don't risk your life against that of\na desperate man. Anybody who saw you to-day will know that you are\nbrave enough.\"\n\n\"I will fight him,\" was the sullen answer. \"No living man shall call me\na coward. I am ready now!\" and he stepped forward and lifted his axe.\n\nI wrung my hands over this absurd piece of Quixotism; but if he was\ndetermined on this deed, of course I could not stop him.\n\n\"Fight not, my white brother,\" said Ignosi, laying his hand\naffectionately on Sir Henry's arm; \"thou hast fought enough, and if\naught befell thee at his hands it would cut my heart in twain.\"\n\n\"I will fight, Ignosi,\" was Sir Henry's answer.\n\n\"It is well, Incubu; thou art a brave man. It will be a good fray.\nBehold, Twala, the Elephant is ready for thee.\"\n\nThe ex-king laughed savagely, and stepping forward faced Curtis. For a\nmoment they stood thus, and the light of the sinking sun caught their\nstalwart frames and clothed them both in fire. They were a well-matched\npair.\n\nThen they began to circle round each other, their battle-axes raised.\n\nSuddenly Sir Henry sprang forward and struck a fearful blow at Twala,\nwho stepped to one side. So heavy was the stroke that the striker half\noverbalanced himself, a circumstance of which his antagonist took a\nprompt advantage. Circling his massive battle-axe round his head, he\nbrought it down with tremendous force. My heart jumped into my mouth; I\nthought that the affair was already finished. But no; with a quick\nupward movement of the left arm Sir Henry interposed his shield between\nhimself and the axe, with the result that its outer edge was shorn\naway, the axe falling on his left shoulder, but not heavily enough to\ndo any serious damage. In another moment Sir Henry got in a second\nblow, which was also received by Twala upon his shield.\n\nThen followed blow upon blow, that were, in turn, either received upon\nthe shields or avoided. The excitement grew intense; the regiment which\nwas watching the encounter forgot its discipline, and, drawing near,\nshouted and groaned at every stroke. Just at this time, too, Good, who\nhad been laid upon the ground by me, recovered from his faint, and,\nsitting up, perceived what was going on. In an instant he was up, and\ncatching hold of my arm, hopped about from place to place on one leg,\ndragging me after him, and yelling encouragements to Sir Henry--\n\n\"Go it, old fellow!\" he hallooed. \"That was a good one! Give it him\namidships,\" and so on.\n\nPresently Sir Henry, having caught a fresh stroke upon his shield, hit\nout with all his force. The blow cut through Twala's shield and through\nthe tough chain armour behind it, gashing him in the shoulder. With a\nyell of pain and fury Twala returned the blow with interest, and, such\nwas his strength, shore right through the rhinoceros' horn handle of\nhis antagonists battle-axe, strengthened as it was with bands of steel,\nwounding Curtis in the face.\n\nA cry of dismay rose from the Buffaloes as our hero's broad axe-head\nfell to the ground; and Twala, again raising his weapon, flew at him\nwith a shout. I shut my eyes. When I opened them again it was to see\nSir Henry's shield lying on the ground, and Sir Henry himself with his\ngreat arms twined round Twala's middle. To and fro they swung, hugging\neach other like bears, straining with all their mighty muscles for dear\nlife, and dearer honour. With a supreme effort Twala swung the\nEnglishman clean off his feet, and down they came together, rolling\nover and over on the lime paving, Twala striking out at Curtis' head\nwith the battle-axe, and Sir Henry trying to drive the _tolla_ he had\ndrawn from his belt through Twala's armour.\n\nIt was a mighty struggle, and an awful thing to see.\n\n\"Get his axe!\" yelled Good; and perhaps our champion heard him.\n\nAt any rate, dropping the _tolla_, he snatched at the axe, which was\nfastened to Twala's wrist by a strip of buffalo hide, and still rolling\nover and over, they fought for it like wild cats, drawing their breath\nin heavy gasps. Suddenly the hide string burst, and then, with a great\neffort, Sir Henry freed himself, the weapon remaining in his hand.\nAnother second and he was upon his feet, the red blood streaming from\nthe wound in his face, and so was Twala. Drawing the heavy _tolla_ from\nhis belt, he reeled straight at Curtis and struck him in the breast.\nThe stab came home true and strong, but whoever it was who made that\nchain armour, he understood his art, for it withstood the steel. Again\nTwala struck out with a savage yell, and again the sharp knife\nrebounded, and Sir Henry went staggering back. Once more Twala came on,\nand as he came our great Englishman gathered himself together, and\nswinging the big axe round his head with both hands, hit at him with\nall his force.\n\nThere was a shriek of excitement from a thousand throats, and, behold!\nTwala's head seemed to spring from his shoulders: then it fell and came\nrolling and bounding along the ground towards Ignosi, stopping just at\nhis feet. For a second the corpse stood upright; then with a dull crash\nit came to the earth, and the gold torque from its neck rolled away\nacross the pavement. As it did so Sir Henry, overpowered by faintness\nand loss of blood, fell heavily across the body of the dead king.\n\nIn a second he was lifted up, and eager hands were pouring water on his\nface. Another minute, and the grey eyes opened wide.\n\nHe was not dead.\n\nThen I, just as the sun sank, stepping to where Twala's head lay in the\ndust, unloosed the diamond from the dead brows, and handed it to Ignosi.\n\n\"Take it,\" I said, \"lawful king of the Kukuanas--king by birth and\nvictory.\"\n\nIgnosi bound the diadem upon his brows. Then advancing, he placed his\nfoot upon the broad chest of his headless foe and broke out into a\nchant, or rather a paean of triumph, so beautiful, and yet so utterly\nsavage, that I despair of being able to give an adequate version of his\nwords. Once I heard a scholar with a fine voice read aloud from the\nGreek poet Homer, and I remember that the sound of the rolling lines\nseemed to make my blood stand still. Ignosi's chant, uttered as it was\nin a language as beautiful and sonorous as the old Greek, produced\nexactly the same effect on me, although I was exhausted with toil and\nmany emotions.\n\n\"Now,\" he began, \"now our rebellion is swallowed up in victory, and our\nevil-doing is justified by strength.\n\n\"In the morning the oppressors arose and stretched themselves; they\nbound on their harness and made them ready to war.\n\n\"They rose up and tossed their spears: the soldiers called to the\ncaptains, 'Come, lead us'--and the captains cried to the king, 'Direct\nthou the battle.'\n\n\"They laughed in their pride, twenty thousand men, and yet a twenty\nthousand.\n\n\"Their plumes covered the valleys as the plumes of a bird cover her\nnest; they shook their shields and shouted, yea, they shook their\nshields in the sunlight; they lusted for battle and were glad.\n\n\"They came up against me; their strong ones ran swiftly to slay me;\nthey cried, 'Ha! ha! he is as one already dead.'\n\n\n\n\"Then breathed I on them, and my breath was as the breath of a wind,\nand lo! they were not.\n\n\"My lightnings pierced them; I licked up their strength with the\nlightning of my spears; I shook them to the ground with the thunder of\nmy shoutings.\n\n\"They broke--they scattered--they were gone as the mists of the morning.\n\n\"They are food for the kites and the foxes, and the place of battle is\nfat with their blood.\n\n\n\"Where are the mighty ones who rose up in the morning?\n\n\"Where are the proud ones who tossed their spears and cried, 'He is as\na man already dead'?\n\n\"They bow their heads, but not in sleep; they are stretched out, but\nnot in sleep.\n\n\"They are forgotten; they have gone into the blackness; they dwell in\nthe dead moons; yea, others shall lead away their wives, and their\nchildren shall remember them no more.\n\n\n\"And I--! the king--like an eagle I have found my eyrie.\n\n\"Behold! far have I flown in the night season, yet have I returned to\nmy young at the daybreak.\n\n\"Shelter ye under the shadow of my wings, O people, and I will comfort\nyou, and ye shall not be dismayed.\n\n\"Now is the good time, the time of spoil.\n\n\"Mine are the cattle on the mountains, mine are the virgins in the\nkraals.\n\n\"The winter is overpast with storms, the summer is come with flowers.\n\n\"Now Evil shall cover up her face, now Mercy and Gladness shall dwell\nin the land.\n\n\"Rejoice, rejoice, my people!\n\n\"Let all the stars rejoice in that this tyranny is trodden down, in\nthat I am the king.\"\n\n\nIgnosi ceased his song, and out of the gathering gloom came back the\ndeep reply--\n\n\"_Thou art the king!_\"\n\n\nThus was my prophecy to the herald fulfilled, and within the\nforty-eight hours Twala's headless corpse was stiffening at Twala's\ngate.\n\n\n[1] It is a law amongst the Kukuanas that no man of the direct royal\nblood can be put to death, unless by his own consent, which is,\nhowever, never refused. He is allowed to choose a succession of\nantagonists, to be approved by the king, with whom he fights, till one\nof them kills him.--A.Q.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nGOOD FALLS SICK\n\nAfter the fight was ended, Sir Henry and Good were carried into Twala's\nhut, where I joined them. They were both utterly exhausted by exertion\nand loss of blood, and, indeed, my own condition was little better. I\nam very wiry, and can stand more fatigue than most men, probably on\naccount of my light weight and long training; but that night I was\nquite done up, and, as is always the case with me when exhausted, that\nold wound which the lion gave me began to pain. Also my head was aching\nviolently from the blow I had received in the morning, when I was\nknocked senseless. Altogether, a more miserable trio than we were that\nevening it would have been difficult to discover; and our only comfort\nlay in the reflection that we were exceedingly fortunate to be there to\nfeel miserable, instead of being stretched dead upon the plain, as so\nmany thousands of brave men were that night, who had risen well and\nstrong in the morning.\n\nSomehow, with the assistance of the beautiful Foulata, who, since we\nhad been the means of saving her life, had constituted herself our\nhandmaiden, and especially Good's, we managed to get off the chain\nshirts, which had certainly saved the lives of two of us that day. As I\nexpected, we found that the flesh underneath was terribly contused, for\nthough the steel links had kept the weapons from entering, they had not\nprevented them from bruising. Both Sir Henry and Good were a mass of\ncontusions, and I was by no means free. As a remedy Foulata brought us\nsome pounded green leaves, with an aromatic odour, which, when applied\nas a plaster, gave us considerable relief.\n\nBut though the bruises were painful, they did not give us such anxiety\nas Sir Henry's and Good's wounds. Good had a hole right through the\nfleshy part of his \"beautiful white leg,\" from which he had lost a\ngreat deal of blood; and Sir Henry, with other hurts, had a deep cut\nover the jaw, inflicted by Twala's battle-axe. Luckily Good is a very\ndecent surgeon, and so soon as his small box of medicines was\nforthcoming, having thoroughly cleansed the wounds, he managed to\nstitch up first Sir Henry's and then his own pretty satisfactorily,\nconsidering the imperfect light given by the primitive Kukuana lamp in\nthe hut. Afterwards he plentifully smeared the injured places with some\nantiseptic ointment, of which there was a pot in the little box, and we\ncovered them with the remains of a pocket-handkerchief which we\npossessed.\n\nMeanwhile Foulata had prepared us some strong broth, for we were too\nweary to eat. This we swallowed, and then threw ourselves down on the\npiles of magnificent karrosses, or fur rugs, which were scattered about\nthe dead king's great hut. By a very strange instance of the irony of\nfate, it was on Twala's own couch, and wrapped in Twala's own\nparticular karross, that Sir Henry, the man who had slain him, slept\nthat night.\n\nI say slept; but after that day's work, sleep was indeed difficult. To\nbegin with, in very truth the air was full\n\n \"Of farewells to the dying\n  And mournings for the dead.\"\n\nFrom every direction came the sound of the wailing of women whose\nhusbands, sons, and brothers had perished in the battle. No wonder that\nthey wailed, for over twelve thousand men, or nearly a fifth of the\nKukuana army, had been destroyed in that awful struggle. It was\nheart-rending to lie and listen to their cries for those who never\nwould return; and it made me understand the full horror of the work\ndone that day to further man's ambition. Towards midnight, however, the\nceaseless crying of the women grew less frequent, till at length the\nsilence was only broken at intervals of a few minutes by a long\npiercing howl that came from a hut in our immediate rear, which, as I\nafterwards discovered, proceeded from Gagool \"keening\" over the dead\nking Twala.\n\nAfter that I got a little fitful sleep, only to wake from time to time\nwith a start, thinking that I was once more an actor in the terrible\nevents of the last twenty-four hours. Now I seemed to see that warrior\nwhom my hand had sent to his last account charging at me on the\nmountain-top; now I was once more in that glorious ring of Greys, which\nmade its immortal stand against all Twala's regiments upon the little\nmound; and now again I saw Twala's plumed and gory head roll past my\nfeet with gnashing teeth and glaring eye.\n\nAt last, somehow or other, the night passed away; but when dawn broke I\nfound that my companions had slept no better than myself. Good, indeed,\nwas in a high fever, and very soon afterwards began to grow\nlight-headed, and also, to my alarm, to spit blood, the result, no\ndoubt, of some internal injury, inflicted during the desperate efforts\nmade by the Kukuana warrior on the previous day to force his big spear\nthrough the chain armour. Sir Henry, however, seemed pretty fresh,\nnotwithstanding his wound on the face, which made eating difficult and\nlaughter an impossibility, though he was so sore and stiff that he\ncould scarcely stir.\n\nAbout eight o'clock we had a visit from Infadoos, who appeared but\nlittle the worse--tough old warrior that he was--for his exertions in\nthe battle, although he informed us that he had been up all night. He\nwas delighted to see us, but much grieved at Good's condition, and\nshook our hands cordially. I noticed, however, that he addressed Sir\nHenry with a kind of reverence, as though he were something more than\nman; and, indeed, as we afterwards found out, the great Englishman was\nlooked on throughout Kukuanaland as a supernatural being. No man, the\nsoldiers said, could have fought as he fought or, at the end of a day\nof such toil and bloodshed, could have slain Twala, who, in addition to\nbeing the king, was supposed to be the strongest warrior in the\ncountry, in single combat, shearing through his bull-neck at a stroke.\nIndeed, that stroke became proverbial in Kukuanaland, and any\nextraordinary blow or feat of strength was henceforth known as\n\"Incubu's blow.\"\n\nInfadoos told us also that all Twala's regiments had submitted to\nIgnosi, and that like submissions were beginning to arrive from chiefs\nin the outlying country. Twala's death at the hands of Sir Henry had\nput an end to all further chance of disturbance; for Scragga had been\nhis only legitimate son, so there was no rival claimant to the throne\nleft alive.\n\nI remarked that Ignosi had swum to power through blood. The old chief\nshrugged his shoulders. \"Yes,\" he answered; \"but the Kukuana people can\nonly be kept cool by letting their blood flow sometimes. Many are\nkilled, indeed, but the women are left, and others must soon grow up to\ntake the places of the fallen. After this the land would be quiet for a\nwhile.\"\n\nAfterwards, in the course of the morning, we had a short visit from\nIgnosi, on whose brows the royal diadem was now bound. As I\ncontemplated him advancing with kingly dignity, an obsequious guard\nfollowing his steps, I could not help recalling to my mind the tall\nZulu who had presented himself to us at Durban some few months back,\nasking to be taken into our service, and reflecting on the strange\nrevolutions of the wheel of fortune.\n\n\"Hail, O king!\" I said, rising.\n\n\"Yes, Macumazahn. King at last, by the might of your three right\nhands,\" was the ready answer.\n\nAll was, he said, going well; and he hoped to arrange a great feast in\ntwo weeks' time in order to show himself to the people.\n\nI asked him what he had settled to do with Gagool.\n\n\"She is the evil genius of the land,\" he answered, \"and I shall kill\nher, and all the witch doctors with her! She has lived so long that\nnone can remember when she was not very old, and she it is who has\nalways trained the witch-hunters, and made the land wicked in the sight\nof the heavens above.\"\n\n\"Yet she knows much,\" I replied; \"it is easier to destroy knowledge,\nIgnosi, than to gather it.\"\n\n\"That is so,\" he said thoughtfully. \"She, and she only, knows the\nsecret of the 'Three Witches,' yonder, whither the great road runs,\nwhere the kings are buried, and the Silent Ones sit.\"\n\n\"Yes, and the diamonds are. Forget not thy promise, Ignosi; thou must\nlead us to the mines, even if thou hast to spare Gagool alive to show\nthe way.\"\n\n\"I will not forget, Macumazahn, and I will think on what thou sayest.\"\n\nAfter Ignosi's visit I went to see Good, and found him quite delirious.\nThe fever set up by his wound seemed to have taken a firm hold of his\nsystem, and to be complicated with an internal injury. For four or five\ndays his condition was most critical; indeed, I believe firmly that had\nit not been for Foulata's indefatigable nursing he must have died.\n\nWomen are women, all the world over, whatever their colour. Yet somehow\nit seemed curious to watch this dusky beauty bending night and day over\nthe fevered man's couch, and performing all the merciful errands of a\nsick-room swiftly, gently, and with as fine an instinct as that of a\ntrained hospital nurse. For the first night or two I tried to help her,\nand so did Sir Henry as soon as his stiffness allowed him to move, but\nFoulata bore our interference with impatience, and finally insisted\nupon our leaving him to her, saying that our movements made him\nrestless, which I think was true. Day and night she watched him and\ntended him, giving him his only medicine, a native cooling drink made\nof milk, in which was infused juice from the bulb of a species of\ntulip, and keeping the flies from settling on him. I can see the whole\npicture now as it appeared night after night by the light of our\nprimitive lamp; Good tossing to and fro, his features emaciated, his\neyes shining large and luminous, and jabbering nonsense by the yard;\nand seated on the ground by his side, her back resting against the wall\nof the hut, the soft-eyed, shapely Kukuana beauty, her face, weary as\nit was with her long vigil, animated by a look of infinite\ncompassion--or was it something more than compassion?\n\nFor two days we thought that he must die, and crept about with heavy\nhearts.\n\nOnly Foulata would not believe it.\n\n\"He will live,\" she said.\n\nFor three hundred yards or more around Twala's chief hut, where the\nsufferer lay, there was silence; for by the king's order all who lived\nin the habitations behind it, except Sir Henry and myself, had been\nremoved, lest any noise should come to the sick man's ears. One night,\nit was the fifth of Good's illness, as was my habit, I went across to\nsee how he was doing before turning in for a few hours.\n\nI entered the hut carefully. The lamp placed upon the floor showed the\nfigure of Good tossing no more, but lying quite still.\n\nSo it had come at last! In the bitterness of my heart I gave something\nlike a sob.\n\n\"Hush--h--h!\" came from the patch of dark shadow behind Good's head.\n\nThen, creeping closer, I saw that he was not dead, but sleeping\nsoundly, with Foulata's taper fingers clasped tightly in his poor white\nhand. The crisis had passed, and he would live. He slept like that for\neighteen hours; and I scarcely like to say it, for fear I should not be\nbelieved, but during the entire period did this devoted girl sit by\nhim, fearing that if she moved and drew away her hand it would wake\nhim. What she must have suffered from cramp and weariness, to say\nnothing of want of food, nobody will ever know; but it is the fact\nthat, when at last he woke, she had to be carried away--her limbs were\nso stiff that she could not move them.\n\n\nAfter the turn had once been taken, Good's recovery was rapid and\ncomplete. It was not till he was nearly well that Sir Henry told him of\nall he owed to Foulata; and when he came to the story of how she sat by\nhis side for eighteen hours, fearing lest by moving she should wake\nhim, the honest sailor's eyes filled with tears. He turned and went\nstraight to the hut where Foulata was preparing the mid-day meal, for\nwe were back in our old quarters now, taking me with him to interpret\nin case he could not make his meaning clear to her, though I am bound\nto say that she understood him marvellously as a rule, considering how\nextremely limited was his foreign vocabulary.\n\n\"Tell her,\" said Good, \"that I owe her my life, and that I will never\nforget her kindness to my dying day.\"\n\nI interpreted, and under her dark skin she actually seemed to blush.\n\nTurning to him with one of those swift and graceful motions that in her\nalways reminded me of the flight of a wild bird, Foulata answered\nsoftly, glancing at him with her large brown eyes--\n\n\"Nay, my lord; my lord forgets! Did he not save _my_ life, and am I not\nmy lord's handmaiden?\"\n\nIt will be observed that the young lady appeared entirely to have\nforgotten the share which Sir Henry and myself had taken in her\npreservation from Twala's clutches. But that is the way of women! I\nremember my dear wife was just the same. Well, I retired from that\nlittle interview sad at heart. I did not like Miss Foulata's soft\nglances, for I knew the fatal amorous propensities of sailors in\ngeneral, and of Good in particular.\n\nThere are two things in the world, as I have found out, which cannot be\nprevented: you cannot keep a Zulu from fighting, or a sailor from\nfalling in love upon the slightest provocation!\n\nIt was a few days after this last occurrence that Ignosi held his great\n\"indaba,\" or council, and was formally recognised as king by the\n\"indunas,\" or head men, of Kukuanaland. The spectacle was a most\nimposing one, including as it did a grand review of troops. On this day\nthe remaining fragments of the Greys were formally paraded, and in the\nface of the army thanked for their splendid conduct in the battle. To\neach man the king made a large present of cattle, promoting them one\nand all to the rank of officers in the new corps of Greys which was in\nprocess of formation. An order was also promulgated throughout the\nlength and breadth of Kukuanaland that, whilst we honoured the country\nby our presence, we three were to be greeted with the royal salute, and\nto be treated with the same ceremony and respect that was by custom\naccorded to the king. Also the power of life and death was publicly\nconferred upon us. Ignosi, too, in the presence of his people,\nreaffirmed the promises which he had made, to the effect that no man's\nblood should be shed without trial, and that witch-hunting should cease\nin the land.\n\nWhen the ceremony was over we waited upon Ignosi, and informed him that\nwe were now anxious to investigate the mystery of the mines to which\nSolomon's Road ran, asking him if he had discovered anything about them.\n\n\"My friends,\" he answered, \"I have discovered this. It is there that\nthe three great figures sit, who here are called the 'Silent Ones,' and\nto whom Twala would have offered the girl Foulata as a sacrifice. It is\nthere, too, in a great cave deep in the mountain, that the kings of the\nland are buried; there ye shall find Twala's body, sitting with those\nwho went before him. There, also, is a deep pit, which, at some time,\nlong-dead men dug out, mayhap for the stones ye speak of, such as I\nhave heard men in Natal tell of at Kimberley. There, too, in the Place\nof Death is a secret chamber, known to none but the king and Gagool.\nBut Twala, who knew it, is dead, and I know it not, nor know I what is\nin it. Yet there is a legend in the land that once, many generations\ngone, a white man crossed the mountains, and was led by a woman to the\nsecret chamber and shown the wealth hidden in it. But before he could\ntake it she betrayed him, and he was driven by the king of that day\nback to the mountains, and since then no man has entered the place.\"\n\n\"The story is surely true, Ignosi, for on the mountains we found the\nwhite man,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, we found him. And now I have promised you that if ye can come to\nthat chamber, and the stones are there--\"\n\n\"The gem upon thy forehead proves that they are there,\" I put in,\npointing to the great diamond I had taken from Twala's dead brows.\n\n\"Mayhap; if they are there,\" he said, \"ye shall have as many as ye can\ntake hence--if indeed ye would leave me, my brothers.\"\n\n\"First we must find the chamber,\" said I.\n\n\"There is but one who can show it to thee--Gagool.\"\n\n\"And if she will not?\"\n\n\"Then she must die,\" said Ignosi sternly. \"I have saved her alive but\nfor this. Stay, she shall choose,\" and calling to a messenger he\nordered Gagool to be brought before him.\n\nIn a few minutes she came, hurried along by two guards, whom she was\ncursing as she walked.\n\n\"Leave her,\" said the king to the guards.\n\nSo soon as their support was withdrawn, the withered old bundle--for\nshe looked more like a bundle than anything else, out of which her two\nbright and wicked eyes gleamed like those of a snake--sank in a heap on\nto the floor.\n\n\"What will ye with me, Ignosi?\" she piped. \"Ye dare not touch me. If ye\ntouch me I will slay you as ye sit. Beware of my magic.\"\n\n\"Thy magic could not save Twala, old she-wolf, and it cannot hurt me,\"\nwas the answer. \"Listen; I will this of thee, that thou reveal to us\nthe chamber where are the shining stones.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" she piped, \"none know its secret but I, and I will never tell\nthee. The white devils shall go hence empty-handed.\"\n\n\"Thou shalt tell me. I will make thee tell me.\"\n\n\"How, O king? Thou art great, but can thy power wring the truth from a\nwoman?\"\n\n\"It is difficult, yet will I do so.\"\n\n\"How, O king?\"\n\n\"Nay, thus; if thou tellest not thou shalt slowly die.\"\n\n\"Die!\" she shrieked in terror and fury; \"ye dare not touch me--man, ye\nknow not who I am. How old think ye am I? I knew your fathers, and your\nfathers' fathers' fathers. When the country was young I was here; when\nthe country grows old I shall still be here. I cannot die unless I be\nkilled by chance, for none dare slay me.\"\n\n\"Yet will I slay thee. See, Gagool, mother of evil, thou art so old\nthat thou canst no longer love thy life. What can life be to such a hag\nas thou, who hast no shape, nor form, nor hair, nor teeth--hast naught,\nsave wickedness and evil eyes? It will be mercy to make an end of thee,\nGagool.\"\n\n\"Thou fool,\" shrieked the old fiend, \"thou accursed fool, deemest thou\nthat life is sweet only to the young? It is not so, and naught thou\nknowest of the heart of man to think it. To the young, indeed, death is\nsometimes welcome, for the young can feel. They love and suffer, and it\nwrings them to see their beloved pass to the land of shadows. But the\nold feel not, they love not, and, _ha! ha!_ they laugh to see another\ngo out into the dark; _ha! ha!_ they laugh to see the evil that is done\nunder the stars. All they love is life, the warm, warm sun, and the\nsweet, sweet air. They are afraid of the cold, afraid of the cold and\nthe dark, _ha! ha! ha!_\" and the old hag writhed in ghastly merriment\non the ground.\n\n\"Cease thine evil talk and answer me,\" said Ignosi angrily. \"Wilt thou\nshow the place where the stones are, or wilt thou not? If thou wilt not\nthou diest, even now,\" and he seized a spear and held it over her.\n\n\"I will not show it; thou darest not kill me, darest not! He who slays\nme will be accursed for ever.\"\n\nSlowly Ignosi brought down the spear till it pricked the prostrate heap\nof rags.\n\nWith a wild yell Gagool sprang to her feet, then fell again and rolled\nupon the floor.\n\n\"Nay, I will show thee. Only let me live, let me sit in the sun and\nhave a bit of meat to suck, and I will show thee.\"\n\n\"It is well. I thought that I should find a way to reason with thee.\nTo-morrow shalt thou go with Infadoos and my white brothers to the\nplace, and beware how thou failest, for if thou showest it not, then\nthou shalt slowly die. I have spoken.\"\n\n\"I will not fail, Ignosi. I always keep my word--_ha! ha! ha!_ Once\nbefore a woman showed the chamber to a white man, and behold! evil\nbefell him,\" and here her wicked eyes glinted. \"Her name was Gagool\nalso. Perchance I was that woman.\"\n\n\"Thou liest,\" I said, \"that was ten generations gone.\"\n\n\"Mayhap, mayhap; when one lives long one forgets. Perhaps it was my\nmother's mother who told me; surely her name was Gagool also. But mark,\nye will find in the place where the bright things are a bag of hide\nfull of stones. The man filled that bag, but he never took it away.\nEvil befell him, I say, evil befell him! Perhaps it was my mother's\nmother who told me. It will be a merry journey--we can see the bodies\nof those who died in the battle as we go. Their eyes will be gone by\nnow, and their ribs will be hollow. _Ha! ha! ha!_\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE PLACE OF DEATH\n\nIt was already dark on the third day after the scene described in the\nprevious chapter when we camped in some huts at the foot of the \"Three\nWitches,\" as the triangle of mountains is called to which Solomon's\nGreat Road runs. Our party consisted of our three selves and Foulata,\nwho waited on us--especially on Good--Infadoos, Gagool, who was borne\nalong in a litter, inside which she could be heard muttering and\ncursing all day long, and a party of guards and attendants. The\nmountains, or rather the three peaks of the mountain, for the mass was\nevidently the result of a solitary upheaval, were, as I have said, in\nthe form of a triangle, of which the base was towards us, one peak\nbeing on our right, one on our left, and one straight in front of us.\nNever shall I forget the sight afforded by those three towering peaks\nin the early sunlight of the following morning. High, high above us, up\ninto the blue air, soared their twisted snow-wreaths. Beneath the\nsnow-line the peaks were purple with heaths, and so were the wild moors\nthat ran up the slopes towards them. Straight before us the white\nribbon of Solomon's Great Road stretched away uphill to the foot of the\ncentre peak, about five miles from us, and there stopped. It was its\nterminus.\n\nI had better leave the feelings of intense excitement with which we set\nout on our march that morning to the imagination of those who read this\nhistory. At last we were drawing near to the wonderful mines that had\nbeen the cause of the miserable death of the old Portuguese Dom three\ncenturies ago, of my poor friend, his ill-starred descendant, and also,\nas we feared, of George Curtis, Sir Henry's brother. Were we destined,\nafter all that we had gone through, to fare any better? Evil befell\nthem, as that old fiend Gagool said; would it also befall us? Somehow,\nas we were marching up that last stretch of beautiful road, I could not\nhelp feeling a little superstitious about the matter, and so I think\ndid Good and Sir Henry.\n\nFor an hour and a half or more we tramped on up the heather-fringed\nway, going so fast in our excitement that the bearers of Gagool's\nhammock could scarcely keep pace with us, and its occupant piped out to\nus to stop.\n\n\"Walk more slowly, white men,\" she said, projecting her hideous\nshrivelled countenance between the grass curtains, and fixing her\ngleaming eyes upon us; \"why will ye run to meet the evil that shall\nbefall you, ye seekers after treasure?\" and she laughed that horrible\nlaugh which always sent a cold shiver down my back, and for a while\nquite took the enthusiasm out of us.\n\nHowever, on we went, till we saw before us, and between ourselves and\nthe peak, a vast circular hole with sloping sides, three hundred feet\nor more in depth, and quite half a mile round.\n\n\"Can't you guess what this is?\" I said to Sir Henry and Good, who were\nstaring in astonishment at the awful pit before us.\n\nThey shook their heads.\n\n\"Then it is clear that you have never seen the diamond diggings at\nKimberley. You may depend on it that this is Solomon's Diamond Mine.\nLook there,\" I said, pointing to the strata of stiff blue clay which\nwere yet to be seen among the grass and bushes that clothed the sides\nof the pit, \"the formation is the same. I'll be bound that if we went\ndown there we should find 'pipes' of soapy brecciated rock. Look, too,\"\nand I pointed to a series of worn flat slabs of stone that were placed\non a gentle slope below the level of a watercourse which in some past\nage had been cut out of the solid rock; \"if those are not tables once\nused to wash the 'stuff,' I'm a Dutchman.\"\n\nAt the edge of this vast hole, which was none other than the pit marked\non the old Dom's map, the Great Road branched into two and circumvented\nit. In many places, by the way, this surrounding road was built\nentirely out of blocks of stone, apparently with the object of\nsupporting the edges of the pit and preventing falls of reef. Along\nthis path we pressed, driven by curiosity to see what were the three\ntowering objects which we could discern from the hither side of the\ngreat gulf. As we drew near we perceived that they were Colossi of some\nsort or another, and rightly conjectured that before us sat the three\n\"Silent Ones\" that are held in such awe by the Kukuana people. But it\nwas not until we were quite close to them that we recognised the full\nmajesty of these \"Silent Ones.\"\n\nThere, upon huge pedestals of dark rock, sculptured with rude emblems\nof the Phallic worship, separated from each other by a distance of\nforty paces, and looking down the road which crossed some sixty miles\nof plain to Loo, were three colossal seated forms--two male and one\nfemale--each measuring about thirty feet from the crown of its head to\nthe pedestal.\n\nThe female form, which was nude, was of great though severe beauty, but\nunfortunately the features had been injured by centuries of exposure to\nthe weather. Rising from either side of her head were the points of a\ncrescent. The two male Colossi, on the contrary, were draped, and\npresented a terrifying cast of features, especially the one to our\nright, which had the face of a devil. That to our left was serene in\ncountenance, but the calm upon it seemed dreadful. It was the calm of\nthat inhuman cruelty, Sir Henry remarked, which the ancients attributed\nto beings potent for good, who could yet watch the sufferings of\nhumanity, if not without rejoicing, at least without sorrow. These\nthree statues form a most awe-inspiring trinity, as they sit there in\ntheir solitude, and gaze out across the plain for ever.\n\nContemplating these \"Silent Ones,\" as the Kukuanas call them, an\nintense curiosity again seized us to know whose were the hands which\nhad shaped them, who it was that had dug the pit and made the road.\nWhilst I was gazing and wondering, suddenly it occurred to me--being\nfamiliar with the Old Testament--that Solomon went astray after strange\ngods, the names of three of whom I remembered--\"Ashtoreth, the goddess\nof the Zidonians, Chemosh, the god of the Moabites, and Milcom, the god\nof the children of Ammon\"--and I suggested to my companions that the\nfigures before us might represent these false and exploded divinities.\n\n\"Hum,\" said Sir Henry, who is a scholar, having taken a high degree in\nclassics at college, \"there may be something in that; Ashtoreth of the\nHebrews was the Astarte of the Phoenicians, who were the great traders\nof Solomon's time. Astarte, who afterwards became the Aphrodite of the\nGreeks, was represented with horns like the half-moon, and there on the\nbrow of the female figure are distinct horns. Perhaps these Colossi\nwere designed by some Phoenician official who managed the mines. Who\ncan say?\"[1]\n\nBefore we had finished examining these extraordinary relics of remote\nantiquity, Infadoos came up, and having saluted the \"Silent Ones\" by\nlifting his spear, asked us if we intended entering the \"Place of\nDeath\" at once, or if we would wait till after we had taken food at\nmid-day. If we were ready to go at once, Gagool had announced her\nwillingness to guide us. As it was not later than eleven\no'clock--driven to it by a burning curiosity--we announced our\nintention of proceeding instantly, and I suggested that, in case we\nshould be detained in the cave, we should take some food with us.\nAccordingly Gagool's litter was brought up, and that lady herself\nassisted out of it. Meanwhile Foulata, at my request, stored some\n\"biltong,\" or dried game-flesh, together with a couple of gourds of\nwater, in a reed basket with a hinged cover. Straight in front of us,\nat a distance of some fifty paces from the backs of the Colossi, rose a\nsheer wall of rock, eighty feet or more in height, that gradually\nsloped upwards till it formed the base of the lofty snow-wreathed peak,\nwhich soared into the air three thousand feet above us. As soon as she\nwas clear of her hammock, Gagool cast one evil grin upon us, and then,\nleaning on a stick, hobbled off towards the face of this wall. We\nfollowed her till we came to a narrow portal solidly arched that looked\nlike the opening of a gallery of a mine.\n\nHere Gagool was waiting for us, still with that evil grin upon her\nhorrid face.\n\n\"Now, white men from the Stars,\" she piped; \"great warriors, Incubu,\nBougwan, and Macumazahn the wise, are ye ready? Behold, I am here to do\nthe bidding of my lord the king, and to show you the store of bright\nstones. _Ha! ha! ha!_\"\n\n\"We are ready,\" I said.\n\n\"Good, good! Make strong your hearts to bear what ye shall see. Comest\nthou too, Infadoos, thou who didst betray thy master?\"\n\nInfadoos frowned as he answered--\n\n\"Nay, I come not; it is not for me to enter there. But thou, Gagool,\ncurb thy tongue, and beware how thou dealest with my lords. At thy\nhands will I require them, and if a hair of them be hurt, Gagool, be'st\nthou fifty times a witch, thou shalt die. Hearest thou?\"\n\n\"I hear Infadoos; I know thee, thou didst ever love big words; when\nthou wast a babe I remember thou didst threaten thine own mother. That\nwas but the other day. But, fear not, fear not, I live only to do the\nbidding of the king. I have done the bidding of many kings, Infadoos,\ntill in the end they did mine. _Ha! ha!_ I go to look upon their faces\nonce more, and Twala's also! Come on, come on, here is the lamp,\" and\nshe drew a large gourd full of oil, and fitted with a rush wick, from\nunder her fur cloak.\n\n\"Art thou coming, Foulata?\" asked Good in his villainous Kitchen\nKukuana, in which he had been improving himself under that young lady's\ntuition.\n\n\"I fear, my lord,\" the girl answered timidly.\n\n\"Then give me the basket.\"\n\n\"Nay, my lord, whither thou goest there I go also.\"\n\n\"The deuce you will!\" thought I to myself; \"that may be rather awkward\nif we ever get out of this.\"\n\nWithout further ado Gagool plunged into the passage, which was wide\nenough to admit of two walking abreast, and quite dark. We followed the\nsound of her voice as she piped to us to come on, in some fear and\ntrembling, which was not allayed by the flutter of a sudden rush of\nwings.\n\n\"Hullo! what's that?\" halloed Good; \"somebody hit me in the face.\"\n\n\"Bats,\" said I; \"on you go.\"\n\nWhen, so far as we could judge, we had gone some fifty paces, we\nperceived that the passage was growing faintly light. Another minute,\nand we were in perhaps the most wonderful place that the eyes of living\nman have beheld.\n\nLet the reader picture to himself the hall of the vastest cathedral he\never stood in, windowless indeed, but dimly lighted from above,\npresumably by shafts connected with the outer air and driven in the\nroof, which arched away a hundred feet above our heads, and he will get\nsome idea of the size of the enormous cave in which we found ourselves,\nwith the difference that this cathedral designed by nature was loftier\nand wider than any built by man. But its stupendous size was the least\nof the wonders of the place, for running in rows adown its length were\ngigantic pillars of what looked like ice, but were, in reality, huge\nstalactites. It is impossible for me to convey any idea of the\noverpowering beauty and grandeur of these pillars of white spar, some\nof which were not less than twenty feet in diameter at the base, and\nsprang up in lofty and yet delicate beauty sheer to the distant roof.\nOthers again were in process of formation. On the rock floor there was\nin these cases what looked, Sir Henry said, exactly like a broken\ncolumn in an old Grecian temple, whilst high above, depending from the\nroof, the point of a huge icicle could be dimly seen.\n\nEven as we gazed we could hear the process going on, for presently with\na tiny splash a drop of water would fall from the far-off icicle on to\nthe column below. On some columns the drops only fell once in two or\nthree minutes, and in these cases it would be an interesting\ncalculation to discover how long, at that rate of dripping, it would\ntake to form a pillar, say eighty feet by ten in diameter. That the\nprocess, in at least one instance, was incalculably slow, the following\nexample will suffice to show. Cut on one of these pillars we discovered\nthe crude likeness of a mummy, by the head of which sat what appeared\nto be the figure of an Egyptian god, doubtless the handiwork of some\nold-world labourer in the mine. This work of art was executed at the\nnatural height at which an idle fellow, be he Phoenician workman or\nBritish cad, is in the habit of trying to immortalise himself at the\nexpense of nature's masterpieces, namely, about five feet from the\nground. Yet at the time that we saw it, which _must_ have been nearly\nthree thousand years after the date of the execution of the carving,\nthe column was only eight feet high, and was still in process of\nformation, which gives a rate of growth of a foot to a thousand years,\nor an inch and a fraction to a century. This we knew because, as we\nwere standing by it, we heard a drop of water fall.\n\nSometimes the stalagmites took strange forms, presumably where the\ndropping of the water had not always been on the same spot. Thus, one\nhuge mass, which must have weighed a hundred tons or so, was in the\nshape of a pulpit, beautifully fretted over outside with a design that\nlooked like lace. Others resembled strange beasts, and on the sides of\nthe cave were fanlike ivory tracings, such as the frost leaves upon a\npane.\n\nOut of the vast main aisle there opened here and there smaller caves,\nexactly, Sir Henry said, as chapels open out of great cathedrals. Some\nwere large, but one or two--and this is a wonderful instance of how\nnature carries out her handiwork by the same unvarying laws, utterly\nirrespective of size--were tiny. One little nook, for instance, was no\nlarger than an unusually big doll's house, and yet it might have been a\nmodel for the whole place, for the water dropped, tiny icicles hung,\nand spar columns were forming in just the same way.\n\nWe had not, however, enough time to examine this beautiful cavern so\nthoroughly as we should have liked to do, since unfortunately, Gagool\nseemed to be indifferent as to stalactites, and only anxious to get her\nbusiness over. This annoyed me the more, as I was particularly anxious\nto discover, if possible, by what system the light was admitted into\nthe cave, and whether it was by the hand of man or by that of nature\nthat this was done; also if the place had been used in any way in\nancient times, as seemed probable. However, we consoled ourselves with\nthe idea that we would investigate it thoroughly on our way back, and\nfollowed on at the heels of our uncanny guide.\n\nOn she led us, straight to the top of the vast and silent cave, where\nwe found another doorway, not arched as the first was, but square at\nthe top, something like the doorways of Egyptian temples.\n\n\"Are ye prepared to enter the Place of Death, white men?\" asked Gagool,\nevidently with a view to making us feel uncomfortable.\n\n\"Lead on, Macduff,\" said Good solemnly, trying to look as though he was\nnot at all alarmed, as indeed we all did except Foulata, who caught\nGood by the arm for protection.\n\n\"This is getting rather ghastly,\" said Sir Henry, peeping into the dark\npassageway. \"Come on, Quatermain--_seniores priores_. We mustn't keep\nthe old lady waiting!\" and he politely made way for me to lead the van,\nfor which inwardly I did not bless him.\n\n_Tap, tap,_ went old Gagool's stick down the passage, as she trotted\nalong, chuckling hideously; and still overcome by some unaccountable\npresentiment of evil, I hung back.\n\n\"Come, get on, old fellow,\" said Good, \"or we shall lose our fair\nguide.\"\n\nThus adjured, I started down the passage, and after about twenty paces\nfound myself in a gloomy apartment some forty feet long, by thirty\nbroad, and thirty high, which in some past age evidently had been\nhollowed, by hand-labour, out of the mountain. This apartment was not\nnearly so well lighted as the vast stalactite ante-cave, and at the\nfirst glance all I could discern was a massive stone table running down\nits length, with a colossal white figure at its head, and life-sized\nwhite figures all round it. Next I discovered a brown thing, seated on\nthe table in the centre, and in another moment my eyes grew accustomed\nto the light, and I saw what all these things were, and was tailing out\nof the place as hard as my legs could carry me.\n\nI am not a nervous man in a general way, and very little troubled with\nsuperstitions, of which I have lived to see the folly; but I am free to\nown that this sight quite upset me, and had it not been that Sir Henry\ncaught me by the collar and held me, I do honestly believe that in\nanother five minutes I should have been outside the stalactite cave,\nand that a promise of all the diamonds in Kimberley would not have\ninduced me to enter it again. But he held me tight, so I stopped\nbecause I could not help myself. Next second, however, _his_ eyes\nbecame accustomed to the light, and he let go of me, and began to mop\nthe perspiration off his forehead. As for Good, he swore feebly, while\nFoulata threw her arms round his neck and shrieked.\n\nOnly Gagool chuckled loud and long.\n\nIt _was_ a ghastly sight. There at the end of the long stone table,\nholding in his skeleton fingers a great white spear, sat _Death_\nhimself, shaped in the form of a colossal human skeleton, fifteen feet\nor more in height. High above his head he held the spear, as though in\nthe act to strike; one bony hand rested on the stone table before him,\nin the position a man assumes on rising from his seat, whilst his frame\nwas bent forward so that the vertebrae of the neck and the grinning,\ngleaming skull projected towards us, and fixed its hollow eye-places\nupon us, the jaws a little open, as though it were about to speak.\n\n\"Great heavens!\" said I faintly, at last, \"what can it be?\"\n\n\"And what are _those things_?\" asked Good, pointing to the white\ncompany round the table.\n\n\"And what on earth is _that thing_?\" said Sir Henry, pointing to the\nbrown creature seated on the table.\n\n\"_Hee! hee! hee!_\" laughed Gagool. \"To those who enter the Hall of the\nDead, evil comes. _Hee! hee! hee! ha! ha!_\"\n\n\"Come, Incubu, brave in battle, come and see him thou slewest;\" and the\nold creature caught Curtis' coat in her skinny fingers, and led him\naway towards the table. We followed.\n\nPresently she stopped and pointed at the brown object seated on the\ntable. Sir Henry looked, and started back with an exclamation; and no\nwonder, for there, quite naked, the head which Curtis' battle-axe had\nshorn from the body resting on its knees, was the gaunt corpse of\nTwala, the last king of the Kukuanas. Yes, there, the head perched upon\nthe knees, it sat in all its ugliness, the vertebrae projecting a full\ninch above the level of the shrunken flesh of the neck, for all the\nworld like a black double of Hamilton Tighe.[2] Over the surface of the\ncorpse there was gathered a thin glassy film, that made its appearance\nyet more appalling, for which we were, at the moment, quite unable to\naccount, till presently we observed that from the roof of the chamber\nthe water fell steadily, _drip! drop! drip!_ on to the neck of the\ncorpse, whence it ran down over the entire surface, and finally escaped\ninto the rock through a tiny hole in the table. Then I guessed what the\nfilm was--_Twala's body was being transformed into a stalactite._\n\nA look at the white forms seated on the stone bench which ran round\nthat ghastly board confirmed this view. They were human bodies indeed,\nor rather they had been human; now they were _stalactites_. This was\nthe way in which the Kukuana people had from time immemorial preserved\ntheir royal dead. They petrified them. What the exact system might be,\nif there was any, beyond the placing of them for a long period of years\nunder the drip, I never discovered, but there they sat, iced over and\npreserved for ever by the siliceous fluid.\n\nAnything more awe-inspiring than the spectacle of this long line of\ndeparted royalties (there were twenty-seven of them, the last being\nIgnosi's father), wrapped, each of them, in a shroud of ice-like spar,\nthrough which the features could be dimly discovered, and seated round\nthat inhospitable board, with Death himself for a host, it is\nimpossible to imagine. That the practice of thus preserving their kings\nmust have been an ancient one is evident from the number, which,\nallowing for an average reign of fifteen years, supposing that every\nking who reigned was placed here--an improbable thing, as some are sure\nto have perished in battle far from home--would fix the date of its\ncommencement at four and a quarter centuries back.\n\nBut the colossal Death, who sits at the head of the board, is far older\nthan that, and, unless I am much mistaken, owes his origin to the same\nartist who designed the three Colossi. He is hewn out of a single\nstalactite, and, looked at as a work of art, is most admirably\nconceived and executed. Good, who understands such things, declared\nthat, so far as he could see, the anatomical design of the skeleton is\nperfect down to the smallest bones.\n\nMy own idea is, that this terrific object was a freak of fancy on the\npart of some old-world sculptor, and that its presence had suggested to\nthe Kukuanas the idea of placing their royal dead under its awful\npresidency. Or perhaps it was set there to frighten away any marauders\nwho might have designs upon the treasure chamber beyond. I cannot say.\nAll I can do is to describe it as it is, and the reader must form his\nown conclusion.\n\nSuch, at any rate, was the White Death and such were the White Dead!\n\n\n[1] Compare Milton, \"Paradise Lost,\" Book i.:--\n\n                      \"With these in troop\n    Came Ashtoreth, whom the Phoenicians called\n    Astarte, Queen of Heaven, with crescent horns;\n    To whose bright image nightly by the moon\n    Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs.\"\n\n[2] \"Now haste ye, my handmaidens, haste and see\n    How he sits there and glowers with his head on his knee.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nSOLOMON'S TREASURE CHAMBER\n\nWhile we were engaged in recovering from our fright, and in examining\nthe grisly wonders of the Place of Death, Gagool had been differently\noccupied. Somehow or other--for she was marvellously active when she\nchose--she had scrambled on to the great table, and made her way to\nwhere our departed friend Twala was placed, under the drip, to see,\nsuggested Good, how he was \"pickling,\" or for some dark purpose of her\nown. Then, after bending down to kiss his icy lips as though in\naffectionate greeting, she hobbled back, stopping now and again to\naddress the remark, the tenor of which I could not catch, to one or\nother of the shrouded forms, just as you or I might welcome an old\nacquaintance. Having gone through this mysterious and horrible\nceremony, she squatted herself down on the table immediately under the\nWhite Death, and began, so far as I could make out, to offer up\nprayers. The spectacle of this wicked creature pouring out\nsupplications, evil ones no doubt, to the arch enemy of mankind, was so\nuncanny that it caused us to hasten our inspection.\n\n\"Now, Gagool,\" said I, in a low voice--somehow one did not dare to\nspeak above a whisper in that place--\"lead us to the chamber.\"\n\nThe old witch promptly scrambled down from the table.\n\n\"My lords are not afraid?\" she said, leering up into my face.\n\n\"Lead on.\"\n\n\"Good, my lords;\" and she hobbled round to the back of the great Death.\n\"Here is the chamber; let my lords light the lamp, and enter,\" and she\nplaced the gourd full of oil upon the floor, and leaned herself against\nthe side of the cave. I took out a match, of which we had still a few\nin a box, and lit a rush wick, and then looked for the doorway, but\nthere was nothing before us except the solid rock. Gagool grinned. \"The\nway is there, my lords. _Ha! ha! ha!_\"\n\n\"Do not jest with us,\" I said sternly.\n\n\"I jest not, my lords. See!\" and she pointed at the rock.\n\nAs she did so, on holding up the lamp we perceived that a mass of stone\nwas rising slowly from the floor and vanishing into the rock above,\nwhere doubtless there is a cavity prepared to receive it. The mass was\nof the width of a good-sized door, about ten feet high and not less\nthan five feet thick. It must have weighed at least twenty or thirty\ntons, and was clearly moved upon some simple balance principle of\ncounter-weights, probably the same as that by which the opening and\nshutting of an ordinary modern window is arranged. How the principle\nwas set in motion, of course none of us saw; Gagool was careful to\navoid this; but I have little doubt that there was some very simple\nlever, which was moved ever so little by pressure at a secret spot,\nthereby throwing additional weight on to the hidden counter-balances,\nand causing the monolith to be lifted from the ground.\n\nVery slowly and gently the great stone raised itself, till at last it\nhad vanished altogether, and a dark hole presented itself to us in the\nplace which the door had filled.\n\nOur excitement was so intense, as we saw the way to Solomon's treasure\nchamber thrown open at last, that I for one began to tremble and shake.\nWould it prove a hoax after all, I wondered, or was old Da Silvestra\nright? Were there vast hoards of wealth hidden in that dark place,\nhoards which would make us the richest men in the whole world? We\nshould know in a minute or two.\n\n\"Enter, white men from the Stars,\" said Gagool, advancing into the\ndoorway; \"but first hear your servant, Gagool the old. The bright\nstones that ye will see were dug out of the pit over which the Silent\nOnes are set, and stored here, I know not by whom, for that was done\nlonger ago than even I remember. But once has this place been entered\nsince the time that those who hid the stones departed in haste, leaving\nthem behind. The report of the treasure went down indeed among the\npeople who lived in the country from age to age, but none knew where\nthe chamber was, nor the secret of the door. But it happened that a\nwhite man reached this country from over the mountains--perchance he\ntoo came 'from the Stars'--and was well received by the king of that\nday. He it is who sits yonder,\" and she pointed to the fifth king at\nthe table of the Dead. \"And it came to pass that he and a woman of the\ncountry who was with him journeyed to this place, and that by chance\nthe woman learnt the secret of the door--a thousand years might ye\nsearch, but ye should never find that secret. Then the white man\nentered with the woman, and found the stones, and filled with stones\nthe skin of a small goat, which the woman had with her to hold food.\nAnd as he was going from the chamber he took up one more stone, a large\none, and held it in his hand.\"\n\nHere she paused.\n\n\"Well,\" I asked, breathless with interest as we all were, \"what\nhappened to Da Silvestra?\"\n\nThe old hag started at the mention of the name.\n\n\"How knowest thou the dead man's name?\" she asked sharply; and then,\nwithout waiting for an answer, went on--\n\n\"None can tell what happened; but it came about that the white man was\nfrightened, for he flung down the goat-skin, with the stones, and fled\nout with only the one stone in his hand, and that the king took, and it\nis the stone which thou, Macumazahn, didst take from Twala's brow.\"\n\n\"Have none entered here since?\" I asked, peering again down the dark\npassage.\n\n\"None, my lords. Only the secret of the door has been kept, and every\nking has opened it, though he has not entered. There is a saying, that\nthose who enter there will die within a moon, even as the white man\ndied in the cave upon the mountain, where ye found him, Macumazahn, and\ntherefore the kings do not enter. _Ha! ha!_ mine are true words.\"\n\nOur eyes met as she said it, and I turned sick and cold. How did the\nold hag know all these things?\n\n\"Enter, my lords. If I speak truth, the goat-skin with the stones will\nlie upon the floor; and if there is truth as to whether it is death to\nenter here, that ye will learn afterwards. _Ha! ha! ha!_\" and she\nhobbled through the doorway, bearing the light with her; but I confess\nthat once more I hesitated about following.\n\n\"Oh, confound it all!\" said Good; \"here goes. I am not going to be\nfrightened by that old devil;\" and followed by Foulata, who, however,\nevidently did not at all like the business, for she was shivering with\nfear, he plunged into the passage after Gagool--an example which we\nquickly followed.\n\nA few yards down the passage, in the narrow way hewn out of the living\nrock, Gagool had paused, and was waiting for us.\n\n\"See, my lords,\" she said, holding the light before her, \"those who\nstored the treasure here fled in haste, and bethought them to guard\nagainst any who should find the secret of the door, but had not the\ntime,\" and she pointed to large square blocks of stone, which, to the\nheight of two courses (about two feet three), had been placed across\nthe passage with a view to walling it up. Along the side of the passage\nwere similar blocks ready for use, and, most curious of all, a heap of\nmortar and a couple of trowels, which tools, so far as we had time to\nexamine them, appeared to be of a similar shape and make to those used\nby workmen to this day.\n\nHere Foulata, who had been in a state of great fear and agitation\nthroughout, said that she felt faint and could go no farther, but would\nwait there. Accordingly we set her down on the unfinished wall, placing\nthe basket of provisions by her side, and left her to recover.\n\nFollowing the passage for about fifteen paces farther, we came suddenly\nto an elaborately painted wooden door. It was standing wide open.\nWhoever was last there had either not found the time to shut it, or had\nforgotten to do so.\n\n_Across the threshold of this door lay a skin bag, formed of a\ngoat-skin, that appeared to be full of pebbles._\n\n\"_Hee! hee!_ white men,\" sniggered Gagool, as the light from the lamp\nfell upon it. \"What did I tell you, that the white man who came here\nfled in haste, and dropped the woman's bag--behold it! Look within also\nand ye will find a water-gourd amongst the stones.\"\n\nGood stooped down and lifted it. It was heavy and jingled.\n\n\"By Jove! I believe it's full of diamonds,\" he said, in an awed\nwhisper; and, indeed, the idea of a small goat-skin full of diamonds is\nenough to awe anybody.\n\n\"Go on,\" said Sir Henry impatiently. \"Here, old lady, give me the\nlamp,\" and taking it from Gagool's hand, he stepped through the doorway\nand held it high above his head.\n\nWe pressed in after him, forgetful for the moment of the bag of\ndiamonds, and found ourselves in King Solomon's treasure chamber.\n\nAt first, all that the somewhat faint light given by the lamp revealed\nwas a room hewn out of the living rock, and apparently not more than\nten feet square. Next there came into sight, stored one on the other to\nthe arch of the roof, a splendid collection of elephant-tusks. How many\nof them there were we did not know, for of course we could not see to\nwhat depth they went back, but there could not have been less than the\nends of four or five hundred tusks of the first quality visible to our\neyes. There, alone, was enough ivory to make a man wealthy for life.\nPerhaps, I thought, it was from this very store that Solomon drew the\nraw material for his \"great throne of ivory,\" of which \"there was not\nthe like made in any kingdom.\"\n\nOn the opposite side of the chamber were about a score of wooden boxes,\nsomething like Martini-Henry ammunition boxes, only rather larger, and\npainted red.\n\n\"There are the diamonds,\" cried I; \"bring the light.\"\n\nSir Henry did so, holding it close to the top box, of which the lid,\nrendered rotten by time even in that dry place, appeared to have been\nsmashed in, probably by Da Silvestra himself. Pushing my hand through\nthe hole in the lid I drew it out full, not of diamonds, but of gold\npieces, of a shape that none of us had seen before, and with what\nlooked like Hebrew characters stamped upon them.\n\n\"Ah!\" I said, replacing the coin, \"we shan't go back empty-handed,\nanyhow. There must be a couple of thousand pieces in each box, and\nthere are eighteen boxes. I suppose this was the money to pay the\nworkmen and merchants.\"\n\n\"Well,\" put in Good, \"I think that is the lot; I don't see any\ndiamonds, unless the old Portuguese put them all into his bag.\"\n\n\"Let my lords look yonder where it is darkest, if they would find the\nstones,\" said Gagool, interpreting our looks. \"There my lords will find\na nook, and three stone chests in the nook, two sealed and one open.\"\n\nBefore translating this to Sir Henry, who carried the light, I could\nnot resist asking how she knew these things, if no one had entered the\nplace since the white man, generations ago.\n\n\"Ah, Macumazahn, the watcher by night,\" was the mocking answer, \"ye who\ndwell in the stars, do ye not know that some live long, and that some\nhave eyes which can see through rock? _Ha! ha! ha!_\"\n\n\"Look in that corner, Curtis,\" I said, indicating the spot Gagool had\npointed out.\n\n\"Hullo, you fellows,\" he cried, \"here's a recess. Great heavens! see\nhere.\"\n\nWe hurried up to where he was standing in a nook, shaped something like\na small bow window. Against the wall of this recess were placed three\nstone chests, each about two feet square. Two were fitted with stone\nlids, the lid of the third rested against the side of the chest, which\nwas open.\n\n\"_See!_\" he repeated hoarsely, holding the lamp over the open chest. We\nlooked, and for a moment could make nothing out, on account of a\nsilvery sheen which dazzled us. When our eyes grew used to it we saw\nthat the chest was three-parts full of uncut diamonds, most of them of\nconsiderable size. Stooping, I picked some up. Yes, there was no doubt\nof it, there was the unmistakable soapy feel about them.\n\nI fairly gasped as I dropped them.\n\n\"We are the richest men in the whole world,\" I said. \"Monte Christo was\na fool to us.\"\n\n\"We shall flood the market with diamonds,\" said Good.\n\n\"Got to get them there first,\" suggested Sir Henry.\n\nWe stood still with pale faces and stared at each other, the lantern in\nthe middle and the glimmering gems below, as though we were\nconspirators about to commit a crime, instead of being, as we thought,\nthe most fortunate men on earth.\n\n\"_Hee! hee! hee!_\" cackled old Gagool behind us, as she flitted about\nlike a vampire bat. \"There are the bright stones ye love, white men, as\nmany as ye will; take them, run them through your fingers, _eat_ of\nthem, _hee! hee! drink_ of them, _ha! ha!_\"\n\nAt that moment there was something so ridiculous to my mind at the idea\nof eating and drinking diamonds, that I began to laugh outrageously, an\nexample which the others followed, without knowing why. There we stood\nand shrieked with laughter over the gems that were ours, which had been\nfound for _us_ thousands of years ago by the patient delvers in the\ngreat hole yonder, and stored for _us_ by Solomon's long-dead overseer,\nwhose name, perchance, was written in the characters stamped on the\nfaded wax that yet adhered to the lids of the chest. Solomon never got\nthem, nor David, or Da Silvestra, nor anybody else. _We_ had got them:\nthere before us were millions of pounds' worth of diamonds, and\nthousands of pounds' worth of gold and ivory only waiting to be taken\naway.\n\nSuddenly the fit passed off, and we stopped laughing.\n\n\"Open the other chests, white men,\" croaked Gagool, \"there are surely\nmore therein. Take your fill, white lords! _Ha! ha!_ take your fill.\"\n\nThus adjured, we set to work to pull up the stone lids on the other\ntwo, first--not without a feeling of sacrilege--breaking the seals that\nfastened them.\n\nHoorah! they were full too, full to the brim; at least, the second one\nwas; no wretched burglarious Da Silvestra had been filling goat-skins\nout of that. As for the third chest, it was only about a fourth full,\nbut the stones were all picked ones; none less than twenty carats, and\nsome of them as large as pigeon-eggs. A good many of these bigger ones,\nhowever, we could see by holding them up to the light, were a little\nyellow, \"off coloured,\" as they call it at Kimberley.\n\nWhat we did _not_ see, however, was the look of fearful malevolence\nthat old Gagool favoured us with as she crept, crept like a snake, out\nof the treasure chamber and down the passage towards the door of solid\nrock.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nHark! Cry upon cry comes ringing up the vaulted path. It is Foulata's\nvoice!\n\n\"_Oh, Bougwan! help! help! the stone falls!_\"\n\n\"Leave go, girl! Then--\"\n\n\"_Help! help! she has stabbed me!_\"\n\nBy now we are running down the passage, and this is what the light from\nthe lamp shows us. The door of the rock is closing down slowly; it is\nnot three feet from the floor. Near it struggle Foulata and Gagool. The\nred blood of the former runs to her knee, but still the brave girl\nholds the old witch, who fights like a wild cat. Ah! she is free!\nFoulata falls, and Gagool throws herself on the ground, to twist like a\nsnake through the crack of the closing stone. She is under--ah! god!\ntoo late! too late! The stone nips her, and she yells in agony. Down,\ndown it comes, all the thirty tons of it, slowly pressing her old body\nagainst the rock below. Shriek upon shriek, such as we have never\nheard, then a long sickening _crunch_, and the door was shut just as,\nrushing down the passage, we hurled ourselves against it.\n\nIt was all done in four seconds.\n\nThen we turned to Foulata. The poor girl was stabbed in the body, and I\nsaw that she could not live long.\n\n\"Ah! Bougwan, I die!\" gasped the beautiful creature. \"She crept\nout--Gagool; I did not see her, I was faint--and the door began to\nfall; then she came back, and was looking up the path--I saw her come\nin through the slowly falling door, and caught her and held her, and\nshe stabbed me, and _I die_, Bougwan!\"\n\n\"Poor girl! poor girl!\" Good cried in his distress; and then, as he\ncould do nothing else, he fell to kissing her.\n\n\"Bougwan,\" she said, after a pause, \"is Macumazahn there? It grows so\ndark, I cannot see.\"\n\n\"Here I am, Foulata.\"\n\n\"Macumazahn, be my tongue for a moment, I pray thee, for Bougwan cannot\nunderstand me, and before I go into the darkness I would speak to him a\nword.\"\n\n\"Say on, Foulata, I will render it.\"\n\n\"Say to my lord, Bougwan, that--I love him, and that I am glad to die\nbecause I know that he cannot cumber his life with such as I am, for\nthe sun may not mate with the darkness, nor the white with the black.\n\n\"Say that, since I saw him, at times I have felt as though there were a\nbird in my bosom, which would one day fly hence and sing elsewhere.\nEven now, though I cannot lift my hand, and my brain grows cold, I do\nnot feel as though my heart were dying; it is so full of love that it\ncould live ten thousand years, and yet be young. Say that if I live\nagain, mayhap I shall see him in the Stars, and that--I will search\nthem all, though perchance there I should still be black and he\nwould--still be white. Say--nay, Macumazahn, say no more, save that I\nlove--Oh, hold me closer, Bougwan, I cannot feel thine arms--_oh! oh!_\"\n\n\"She is dead--she is dead!\" muttered Good, rising in grief, the tears\nrunning down his honest face.\n\n\"You need not let that trouble you, old fellow,\" said Sir Henry.\n\n\"Eh!\" exclaimed Good; \"what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that you will soon be in a position to join her. _Man, don't\nyou see that we are buried alive?_\"\n\nUntil Sir Henry uttered these words I do not think that the full horror\nof what had happened had come home to us, preoccupied as we were with\nthe sight of poor Foulata's end. But now we understood. The ponderous\nmass of rock had closed, probably for ever, for the only brain which\nknew its secret was crushed to powder beneath its weight. This was a\ndoor that none could hope to force with anything short of dynamite in\nlarge quantities. And we were on the wrong side!\n\nFor a few minutes we stood horrified, there over the corpse of Foulata.\nAll the manhood seemed to have gone out of us. The first shock of this\nidea of the slow and miserable end that awaited us was overpowering. We\nsaw it all now; that fiend Gagool had planned this snare for us from\nthe first.\n\nIt would have been just the jest that her evil mind would have rejoiced\nin, the idea of the three white men, whom, for some reason of her own,\nshe had always hated, slowly perishing of thirst and hunger in the\ncompany of the treasure they had coveted. Now I saw the point of that\nsneer of hers about eating and drinking the diamonds. Probably somebody\nhad tried to serve the poor old Dom in the same way, when he abandoned\nthe skin full of jewels.\n\n\"This will never do,\" said Sir Henry hoarsely; \"the lamp will soon go\nout. Let us see if we can't find the spring that works the rock.\"\n\nWe sprang forward with desperate energy, and, standing in a bloody\nooze, began to feel up and down the door and the sides of the passage.\nBut no knob or spring could we discover.\n\n\"Depend on it,\" I said, \"it does not work from the inside; if it did\nGagool would not have risked trying to crawl underneath the stone. It\nwas the knowledge of this that made her try to escape at all hazards,\ncurse her.\"\n\n\"At all events,\" said Sir Henry, with a hard little laugh, \"retribution\nwas swift; hers was almost as awful an end as ours is likely to be. We\ncan do nothing with the door; let us go back to the treasure room.\"\n\nWe turned and went, and as we passed it I perceived by the unfinished\nwall across the passage the basket of food which poor Foulata had\ncarried. I took it up, and brought it with me to the accursed treasure\nchamber that was to be our grave. Then we returned and reverently bore\nin Foulata's corpse, laying it on the floor by the boxes of coin.\n\nNext we seated ourselves, leaning our backs against the three stone\nchests which contained the priceless treasure.\n\n\"Let us divide the food,\" said Sir Henry, \"so as to make it last as\nlong as possible.\" Accordingly we did so. It would, we reckoned, make\nfour infinitesimally small meals for each of us, enough, say, to\nsupport life for a couple of days. Besides the \"biltong,\" or dried\ngame-flesh, there were two gourds of water, each of which held not more\nthan a quart.\n\n\"Now,\" said Sir Henry grimly, \"let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we\ndie.\"\n\nWe each ate a small portion of the \"biltong,\" and drank a sip of water.\nNeedless to say, we had but little appetite, though we were sadly in\nneed of food, and felt better after swallowing it. Then we got up and\nmade a systematic examination of the walls of our prison-house, in the\nfaint hope of finding some means of exit, sounding them and the floor\ncarefully.\n\nThere was none. It was not probable that there would be any to a\ntreasure chamber.\n\nThe lamp began to burn dim. The fat was nearly exhausted.\n\n\"Quatermain,\" said Sir Henry, \"what is the time--your watch goes?\"\n\nI drew it out, and looked at it. It was six o'clock; we had entered the\ncave at eleven.\n\n\"Infadoos will miss us,\" I suggested. \"If we do not return to-night he\nwill search for us in the morning, Curtis.\"\n\n\"He may search in vain. He does not know the secret of the door, nor\neven where it is. No living person knew it yesterday, except Gagool.\nTo-day no one knows it. Even if he found the door he could not break it\ndown. All the Kukuana army could not break through five feet of living\nrock. My friends, I see nothing for it but to bow ourselves to the will\nof the Almighty. The search for treasure has brought many to a bad end;\nwe shall go to swell their number.\"\n\nThe lamp grew dimmer yet.\n\nPresently it flared up and showed the whole scene in strong relief, the\ngreat mass of white tusks, the boxes of gold, the corpse of the poor\nFoulata stretched before them, the goat-skin full of treasure, the dim\nglimmer of the diamonds, and the wild, wan faces of us three white men\nseated there awaiting death by starvation.\n\n\nThen the flame sank and expired.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nWE ABANDON HOPE\n\nI can give no adequate description of the horrors of the night which\nfollowed. Mercifully they were to some extent mitigated by sleep, for\neven in such a position as ours wearied nature will sometimes assert\nitself. But I, at any rate, found it impossible to sleep much. Putting\naside the terrifying thought of our impending doom--for the bravest man\non earth might well quail from such a fate as awaited us, and I never\nmade any pretensions to be brave--the _silence_ itself was too great to\nallow of it. Reader, you may have lain awake at night and thought the\nquiet oppressive, but I say with confidence that you can have no idea\nwhat a vivid, tangible thing is perfect stillness. On the surface of\nthe earth there is always some sound or motion, and though it may in\nitself be imperceptible, yet it deadens the sharp edge of absolute\nsilence. But here there was none. We were buried in the bowels of a\nhuge snow-clad peak. Thousands of feet above us the fresh air rushed\nover the white snow, but no sound of it reached us. We were separated\nby a long tunnel and five feet of rock even from the awful chamber of\nthe Dead; and the dead make no noise. Did we not know it who lay by\npoor Foulata's side? The crashing of all the artillery of earth and\nheaven could not have come to our ears in our living tomb. We were cut\noff from every echo of the world--we were as men already in the grave.\n\nThen the irony of the situation forced itself upon me. There around us\nlay treasures enough to pay off a moderate national debt, or to build a\nfleet of ironclads, and yet we would have bartered them all gladly for\nthe faintest chance of escape. Soon, doubtless, we should be rejoiced\nto exchange them for a bit of food or a cup of water, and, after that,\neven for the privilege of a speedy close to our sufferings. Truly\nwealth, which men spend their lives in acquiring, is a valueless thing\nat the last.\n\nAnd so the night wore on.\n\n\"Good,\" said Sir Henry's voice at last, and it sounded awful in the\nintense stillness, \"how many matches have you in the box?\"\n\n\"Eight, Curtis.\"\n\n\"Strike one and let us see the time.\"\n\nHe did so, and in contrast to the dense darkness the flame nearly\nblinded us. It was five o'clock by my watch. The beautiful dawn was now\nblushing on the snow-wreaths far over our heads, and the breeze would\nbe stirring the night mists in the hollows.\n\n\"We had better eat something and keep up our strength,\" I suggested.\n\n\"What is the good of eating?\" answered Good; \"the sooner we die and get\nit over the better.\"\n\n\"While there is life there is hope,\" said Sir Henry.\n\nAccordingly we ate and sipped some water, and another period of time\nelapsed. Then Sir Henry suggested that it might be well to get as near\nthe door as possible and halloa, on the faint chance of somebody\ncatching a sound outside. Accordingly Good, who, from long practice at\nsea, has a fine piercing note, groped his way down the passage and set\nto work. I must say that he made a most diabolical noise. I never heard\nsuch yells; but it might have been a mosquito buzzing for all the\neffect they produced.\n\nAfter a while he gave it up and came back very thirsty, and had to\ndrink. Then we stopped yelling, as it encroached on the supply of water.\n\nSo we sat down once more against the chests of useless diamonds in that\ndreadful inaction which was one of the hardest circumstances of our\nfate; and I am bound to say that, for my part, I gave way in despair.\nLaying my head against Sir Henry's broad shoulder I burst into tears;\nand I think that I heard Good gulping away on the other side, and\nswearing hoarsely at himself for doing so.\n\nAh, how good and brave that great man was! Had we been two frightened\nchildren, and he our nurse, he could not have treated us more tenderly.\nForgetting his own share of miseries, he did all he could to soothe our\nbroken nerves, telling stories of men who had been in somewhat similar\ncircumstances, and miraculously escaped; and when these failed to cheer\nus, pointing out how, after all, it was only anticipating an end which\nmust come to us all, that it would soon be over, and that death from\nexhaustion was a merciful one (which is not true). Then, in a diffident\nsort of way, as once before I had heard him do, he suggested that we\nshould throw ourselves on the mercy of a higher Power, which for my\npart I did with great vigour.\n\nHis is a beautiful character, very quiet, but very strong.\n\nAnd so somehow the day went as the night had gone, if, indeed, one can\nuse these terms where all was densest night, and when I lit a match to\nsee the time it was seven o'clock.\n\nOnce more we ate and drank, and as we did so an idea occurred to me.\n\n\"How is it,\" said I, \"that the air in this place keeps fresh? It is\nthick and heavy, but it is perfectly fresh.\"\n\n\"Great heavens!\" said Good, starting up, \"I never thought of that. It\ncan't come through the stone door, for it's air-tight, if ever a door\nwas. It must come from somewhere. If there were no current of air in\nthe place we should have been stifled or poisoned when we first came\nin. Let us have a look.\"\n\nIt was wonderful what a change this mere spark of hope wrought in us.\nIn a moment we were all three groping about on our hands and knees,\nfeeling for the slightest indication of a draught. Presently my ardour\nreceived a check. I put my hand on something cold. It was dead\nFoulata's face.\n\nFor an hour or more we went on feeling about, till at last Sir Henry\nand I gave it up in despair, having been considerably hurt by\nconstantly knocking our heads against tusks, chests, and the sides of\nthe chamber. But Good still persevered, saying, with an approach to\ncheerfulness, that it was better than doing nothing.\n\n\"I say, you fellows,\" he said presently, in a constrained sort of\nvoice, \"come here.\"\n\nNeedless to say we scrambled towards him quickly enough.\n\n\"Quatermain, put your hand here where mine is. Now, do you feel\nanything?\"\n\n\"I _think_ I feel air coming up.\"\n\n\"Now listen.\" He rose and stamped upon the place, and a flame of hope\nshot up in our hearts. _It rang hollow._\n\nWith trembling hands I lit a match. I had only three left, and we saw\nthat we were in the angle of the far corner of the chamber, a fact that\naccounted for our not having noticed the hollow sound of the place\nduring our former exhaustive examination. As the match burnt we\nscrutinised the spot. There was a join in the solid rock floor, and,\ngreat heavens! there, let in level with the rock, was a stone ring. We\nsaid no word, we were too excited, and our hearts beat too wildly with\nhope to allow us to speak. Good had a knife, at the back of which was\none of those hooks that are made to extract stones from horses' hoofs.\nHe opened it, and scratched round the ring with it. Finally he worked\nit under, and levered away gently for fear of breaking the hook. The\nring began to move. Being of stone it had not rusted fast in all the\ncenturies it had lain there, as would have been the case had it been of\niron. Presently it was upright. Then he thrust his hands into it and\ntugged with all his force, but nothing budged.\n\n\"Let me try,\" I said impatiently, for the situation of the stone, right\nin the angle of the corner, was such that it was impossible for two to\npull at once. I took hold and strained away, but no results.\n\nThen Sir Henry tried and failed.\n\nTaking the hook again, Good scratched all round the crack where we felt\nthe air coming up.\n\n\"Now, Curtis,\" he said, \"tackle on, and put your back into it; you are\nas strong as two. Stop,\" and he took off a stout black silk\nhandkerchief, which, true to his habits of neatness, he still wore, and\nran it through the ring. \"Quatermain, get Curtis round the middle and\npull for dear life when I give the word. _Now._\"\n\nSir Henry put out all his enormous strength, and Good and I did the\nsame, with such power as nature had given us.\n\n\"Heave! heave! it's giving,\" gasped Sir Henry; and I heard the muscles\nof his great back cracking. Suddenly there was a grating sound, then a\nrush of air, and we were all on our backs on the floor with a heavy\nflag-stone upon the top of us. Sir Henry's strength had done it, and\nnever did muscular power stand a man in better stead.\n\n\"Light a match, Quatermain,\" he said, so soon as we had picked\nourselves up and got our breath; \"carefully, now.\"\n\nI did so, and there before us, Heaven be praised! was the _first step\nof a stone stair._\n\n\"Now what is to be done?\" asked Good.\n\n\"Follow the stair, of course, and trust to Providence.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" said Sir Henry; \"Quatermain, get the bit of biltong and the\nwater that are left; we may want them.\"\n\nI went, creeping back to our place by the chests for that purpose, and\nas I was coming away an idea struck me. We had not thought much of the\ndiamonds for the last twenty-four hours or so; indeed, the very idea of\ndiamonds was nauseous, seeing what they had entailed upon us; but,\nreflected I, I may as well pocket some in case we ever should get out\nof this ghastly hole. So I just put my fist into the first chest and\nfilled all the available pockets of my old shooting-coat and trousers,\ntopping up--this was a happy thought--with a few handfuls of big ones\nfrom the third chest. Also, by an afterthought, I stuffed Foulata's\nbasket, which, except for one water-gourd and a little biltong, was\nempty now, with great quantities of the stones.\n\n\"I say, you fellows,\" I sang out, \"won't you take some diamonds with\nyou? I've filled my pockets and the basket.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on, Quatermain! and hang the diamonds!\" said Sir Henry. \"I\nhope that I may never see another.\"\n\nAs for Good, he made no answer. He was, I think, taking his last\nfarewell of all that was left of the poor girl who had loved him so\nwell. And curious as it may seem to you, my reader, sitting at home at\nease and reflecting on the vast, indeed the immeasurable, wealth which\nwe were thus abandoning, I can assure you that if you had passed some\ntwenty-eight hours with next to nothing to eat and drink in that place,\nyou would not have cared to cumber yourself with diamonds whilst\nplunging down into the unknown bowels of the earth, in the wild hope of\nescape from an agonising death. If from the habits of a lifetime, it\nhad not become a sort of second nature with me never to leave anything\nworth having behind if there was the slightest chance of my being able\nto carry it away, I am sure that I should not have bothered to fill my\npockets and that basket.\n\n\"Come on, Quatermain,\" repeated Sir Henry, who was already standing on\nthe first step of the stone stair. \"Steady, I will go first.\"\n\n\"Mind where you put your feet, there may be some awful hole\nunderneath,\" I answered.\n\n\"Much more likely to be another room,\" said Sir Henry, while he\ndescended slowly, counting the steps as he went.\n\nWhen he got to \"fifteen\" he stopped. \"Here's the bottom,\" he said.\n\"Thank goodness! I think it's a passage. Follow me down.\"\n\nGood went next, and I came last, carrying the basket, and on reaching\nthe bottom lit one of the two remaining matches. By its light we could\njust see that we were standing in a narrow tunnel, which ran right and\nleft at right angles to the staircase we had descended. Before we could\nmake out any more, the match burnt my fingers and went out. Then arose\nthe delicate question of which way to go. Of course, it was impossible\nto know what the tunnel was, or where it led to, and yet to turn one\nway might lead us to safety, and the other to destruction. We were\nutterly perplexed, till suddenly it struck Good that when I had lit the\nmatch the draught of the passage blew the flame to the left.\n\n\"Let us go against the draught,\" he said; \"air draws inwards, not\noutwards.\"\n\nWe took this suggestion, and feeling along the wall with our hands,\nwhilst trying the ground before us at every step, we departed from that\naccursed treasure chamber on our terrible quest for life. If ever it\nshould be entered again by living man, which I do not think probable,\nhe will find tokens of our visit in the open chests of jewels, the\nempty lamp, and the white bones of poor Foulata.\n\nWhen we had groped our way for about a quarter of an hour along the\npassage, suddenly it took a sharp turn, or else was bisected by\nanother, which we followed, only in course of time to be led into a\nthird. And so it went on for some hours. We seemed to be in a stone\nlabyrinth that led nowhere. What all these passages are, of course I\ncannot say, but we thought that they must be the ancient workings of a\nmine, of which the various shafts and adits travelled hither and\nthither as the ore led them. This is the only way in which we could\naccount for such a multitude of galleries.\n\nAt length we halted, thoroughly worn out with fatigue and with that\nhope deferred which maketh the heart sick, and ate up our poor\nremaining piece of biltong and drank our last sup of water, for our\nthroats were like lime-kilns. It seemed to us that we had escaped Death\nin the darkness of the treasure chamber only to meet him in the\ndarkness of the tunnels.\n\nAs we stood, once more utterly depressed, I thought that I caught a\nsound, to which I called the attention of the others. It was very faint\nand very far off, but it _was_ a sound, a faint, murmuring sound, for\nthe others heard it too, and no words can describe the blessedness of\nit after all those hours of utter, awful stillness.\n\n\"By heaven! it's running water,\" said Good. \"Come on.\"\n\nOff we started again in the direction from which the faint murmur\nseemed to come, groping our way as before along the rocky walls. I\nremember that I laid down the basket full of diamonds, wishing to be\nrid of its weight, but on second thoughts took it up again. One might\nas well die rich as poor, I reflected. As we went the sound became more\nand more audible, till at last it seemed quite loud in the quiet. On,\nyet on; now we could distinctly make out the unmistakable swirl of\nrushing water. And yet how could there be running water in the bowels\nof the earth? Now we were quite near it, and Good, who was leading,\nswore that he could smell it.\n\n\"Go gently, Good,\" said Sir Henry, \"we must be close.\" _Splash!_ and a\ncry from Good.\n\nHe had fallen in.\n\n\"Good! Good! where are you?\" we shouted, in terrified distress. To our\nintense relief an answer came back in a choky voice.\n\n\"All right; I've got hold of a rock. Strike a light to show me where\nyou are.\"\n\nHastily I lit the last remaining match. Its faint gleam discovered to\nus a dark mass of water running at our feet. How wide it was we could\nnot see, but there, some way out, was the dark form of our companion\nhanging on to a projecting rock.\n\n\"Stand clear to catch me,\" sung out Good. \"I must swim for it.\"\n\nThen we heard a splash, and a great struggle. Another minute and he had\ngrabbed at and caught Sir Henry's outstretched hand, and we had pulled\nhim up high and dry into the tunnel.\n\n\"My word!\" he said, between his gasps, \"that was touch and go. If I\nhadn't managed to catch that rock, and known how to swim, I should have\nbeen done. It runs like a mill-race, and I could feel no bottom.\"\n\nWe dared not follow the banks of the subterranean river for fear lest\nwe should fall into it again in the darkness. So after Good had rested\na while, and we had drunk our fill of the water, which was sweet and\nfresh, and washed our faces, that needed it sadly, as well as we could,\nwe started from the banks of this African Styx, and began to retrace\nour steps along the tunnel, Good dripping unpleasantly in front of us.\nAt length we came to another gallery leading to our right.\n\n\"We may as well take it,\" said Sir Henry wearily; \"all roads are alike\nhere; we can only go on till we drop.\"\n\nSlowly, for a long, long while, we stumbled, utterly exhausted, along\nthis new tunnel, Sir Henry now leading the way. Again I thought of\nabandoning that basket, but did not.\n\nSuddenly he stopped, and we bumped up against him.\n\n\"Look!\" he whispered, \"is my brain going, or is that light?\"\n\nWe stared with all our eyes, and there, yes, there, far ahead of us,\nwas a faint, glimmering spot, no larger than a cottage window pane. It\nwas so faint that I doubt if any eyes, except those which, like ours,\nhad for days seen nothing but blackness, could have perceived it at all.\n\nWith a gasp of hope we pushed on. In five minutes there was no longer\nany doubt; it _was_ a patch of faint light. A minute more and a breath\nof real live air was fanning us. On we struggled. All at once the\ntunnel narrowed. Sir Henry went on his knees. Smaller yet it grew, till\nit was only the size of a large fox's earth--it was _earth_ now, mind\nyou; the rock had ceased.\n\nA squeeze, a struggle, and Sir Henry was out, and so was Good, and so\nwas I, dragging Foulata's basket after me; and there above us were the\nblessed stars, and in our nostrils was the sweet air. Then suddenly\nsomething gave, and we were all rolling over and over and over through\ngrass and bushes and soft, wet soil.\n\nThe basket caught in something and I stopped. Sitting up I halloed\nlustily. An answering shout came from below, where Sir Henry's wild\ncareer had been checked by some level ground. I scrambled to him, and\nfound him unhurt, though breathless. Then we looked for Good. A little\nway off we discovered him also, hammed in a forked root. He was a good\ndeal knocked about, but soon came to himself.\n\nWe sat down together, there on the grass, and the revulsion of feeling\nwas so great that really I think we cried with joy. We had escaped from\nthat awful dungeon, which was so near to becoming our grave. Surely\nsome merciful Power guided our footsteps to the jackal hole, for that\nis what it must have been, at the termination of the tunnel. And see,\nyonder on the mountains the dawn we had never thought to look upon\nagain was blushing rosy red.\n\nPresently the grey light stole down the slopes, and we saw that we were\nat the bottom, or rather, nearly at the bottom, of the vast pit in\nfront of the entrance to the cave. Now we could make out the dim forms\nof the three Colossi who sat upon its verge. Doubtless those awful\npassages, along which we had wandered the livelong night, had been\noriginally in some way connected with the great diamond mine. As for\nthe subterranean river in the bowels of the mountain, Heaven only knows\nwhat it is, or whence it flows, or whither it goes. I, for one, have no\nanxiety to trace its course.\n\nLighter it grew, and lighter yet. We could see each other now, and such\na spectacle as we presented I have never set eyes on before or since.\nGaunt-cheeked, hollow-eyed wretches, smeared all over with dust and\nmud, bruised, bleeding, the long fear of imminent death yet written on\nour countenances, we were, indeed, a sight to frighten the daylight.\nAnd yet it is a solemn fact that Good's eye-glass was still fixed in\nGood's eye. I doubt whether he had ever taken it out at all. Neither\nthe darkness, nor the plunge in the subterranean river, nor the roll\ndown the slope, had been able to separate Good and his eye-glass.\n\nPresently we rose, fearing that our limbs would stiffen if we stopped\nthere longer, and commenced with slow and painful steps to struggle up\nthe sloping sides of the great pit. For an hour or more we toiled\nsteadfastly up the blue clay, dragging ourselves on by the help of the\nroots and grasses with which it was clothed. But now I had no more\nthought of leaving the basket; indeed, nothing but death should have\nparted us.\n\nAt last it was done, and we stood by the great road, on that side of\nthe pit which is opposite to the Colossi.\n\nAt the side of the road, a hundred yards off, a fire was burning in\nfront of some huts, and round the fire were figures. We staggered\ntowards them, supporting one another, and halting every few paces.\nPresently one of the figures rose, saw us and fell on to the ground,\ncrying out for fear.\n\n\"Infadoos, Infadoos! it is we, thy friends.\"\n\nHe rose; he ran to us, staring wildly, and still shaking with fear.\n\n\"Oh, my lords, my lords, it is indeed you come back from the\ndead!--come back from the dead!\"\n\nAnd the old warrior flung himself down before us, and clasping Sir\nHenry's knees, he wept aloud for joy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nIGNOSI'S FAREWELL\n\nTen days from that eventful morning found us once more in our old\nquarters at Loo; and, strange to say, but little the worse for our\nterrible experience, except that my stubbly hair came out of the\ntreasure cave about three shades greyer than it went in, and that Good\nnever was quite the same after Foulata's death, which seemed to move\nhim very greatly. I am bound to say, looking at the thing from the\npoint of view of an oldish man of the world, that I consider her\nremoval was a fortunate occurrence, since, otherwise, complications\nwould have been sure to ensue. The poor creature was no ordinary native\ngirl, but a person of great, I had almost said stately, beauty, and of\nconsiderable refinement of mind. But no amount of beauty or refinement\ncould have made an entanglement between Good and herself a desirable\noccurrence; for, as she herself put it, \"Can the sun mate with the\ndarkness, or the white with the black?\"\n\nI need hardly state that we never again penetrated into Solomon's\ntreasure chamber. After we had recovered from our fatigues, a process\nwhich took us forty-eight hours, we descended into the great pit in the\nhope of finding the hole by which we had crept out of the mountain, but\nwith no success. To begin with, rain had fallen, and obliterated our\nspoor; and what is more, the sides of the vast pit were full of\nant-bear and other holes. It was impossible to say to which of these we\nowed our salvation. Also, on the day before we started back to Loo, we\nmade a further examination of the wonders of the stalactite cave, and,\ndrawn by a kind of restless feeling, even penetrated once more into the\nChamber of the Dead. Passing beneath the spear of the White Death we\ngazed, with sensations which it would be quite impossible for me to\ndescribe, at the mass of rock that had shut us off from escape,\nthinking the while of priceless treasures beyond, of the mysterious old\nhag whose flattened fragments lay crushed beneath it, and of the fair\ngirl of whose tomb it was the portal. I say gazed at the \"rock,\" for,\nexamine as we could, we could find no traces of the join of the sliding\ndoor; nor, indeed, could we hit upon the secret, now utterly lost, that\nworked it, though we tried for an hour or more. It is certainly a\nmarvellous bit of mechanism, characteristic, in its massive and yet\ninscrutable simplicity, of the age which produced it; and I doubt if\nthe world has such another to show.\n\nAt last we gave it up in disgust; though, if the mass had suddenly\nrisen before our eyes, I doubt if we should have screwed up courage to\nstep over Gagool's mangled remains, and once more enter the treasure\nchamber, even in the sure and certain hope of unlimited diamonds. And\nyet I could have cried at the idea of leaving all that treasure, the\nbiggest treasure probably that in the world's history has ever been\naccumulated in one spot. But there was no help for it. Only dynamite\ncould force its way through five feet of solid rock.\n\nSo we left it. Perhaps, in some remote unborn century, a more fortunate\nexplorer may hit upon the \"Open Sesame,\" and flood the world with gems.\nBut, myself, I doubt it. Somehow, I seem to feel that the tens of\nmillions of pounds' worth of jewels which lie in the three stone\ncoffers will never shine round the neck of an earthly beauty. They and\nFoulata's bones will keep cold company till the end of all things.\n\nWith a sigh of disappointment we made our way back, and next day\nstarted for Loo. And yet it was really very ungrateful of us to be\ndisappointed; for, as the reader will remember, by a lucky thought, I\nhad taken the precaution to fill the wide pockets of my old shooting\ncoat and trousers with gems before we left our prison-house, also\nFoulata's basket, which held twice as many more, notwithstanding that\nthe water bottle had occupied some of its space. A good many of these\nfell out in the course of our roll down the side of the pit, including\nseveral of the big ones, which I had crammed in on the top in my coat\npockets. But, comparatively speaking, an enormous quantity still\nremained, including ninety-three large stones ranging from over two\nhundred to seventy carats in weight. My old shooting coat and the\nbasket still held sufficient treasure to make us all, if not\nmillionaires as the term is understood in America, at least exceedingly\nwealthy men, and yet to keep enough stones each to make the three\nfinest sets of gems in Europe. So we had not done so badly.\n\nOn arriving at Loo we were most cordially received by Ignosi, whom we\nfound well, and busily engaged in consolidating his power, and\nreorganising the regiments which had suffered most in the great\nstruggle with Twala.\n\nHe listened with intense interest to our wonderful story; but when we\ntold him of old Gagool's frightful end he grew thoughtful.\n\n\"Come hither,\" he called, to a very old Induna or councillor, who was\nsitting with others in a circle round the king, but out of ear-shot.\nThe ancient man rose, approached, saluted, and seated himself.\n\n\"Thou art aged,\" said Ignosi.\n\n\"Ay, my lord the king! Thy father's father and I were born on the same\nday.\"\n\n\"Tell me, when thou wast little, didst thou know Gagaoola the witch\ndoctress?\"\n\n\"Ay, my lord the king!\"\n\n\"How was she then--young, like thee?\"\n\n\"Not so, my lord the king! She was even as she is now and as she was in\nthe days of my great grandfather before me; old and dried, very ugly,\nand full of wickedness.\"\n\n\"She is no more; she is dead.\"\n\n\"So, O king! then is an ancient curse taken from the land.\"\n\n\"Go!\"\n\n\"_Koom!_ I go, Black Puppy, who tore out the old dog's throat. _Koom!_\"\n\n\"Ye see, my brothers,\" said Ignosi, \"this was a strange woman, and I\nrejoice that she is dead. She would have let you die in the dark place,\nand mayhap afterwards she had found a way to slay me, as she found a\nway to slay my father, and set up Twala, whom her black heart loved, in\nhis place. Now go on with the tale; surely there never was its like!\"\n\nAfter I had narrated all the story of our escape, as we had agreed\nbetween ourselves that I should, I took the opportunity to address\nIgnosi as to our departure from Kukuanaland.\n\n\"And now, Ignosi,\" I said, \"the time has come for us to bid thee\nfarewell, and start to see our own land once more. Behold, Ignosi, thou\ncamest with us a servant, and now we leave thee a mighty king. If thou\nart grateful to us, remember to do even as thou didst promise: to rule\njustly, to respect the law, and to put none to death without a cause.\nSo shalt thou prosper. To-morrow, at break of day, Ignosi, thou wilt\ngive us an escort who shall lead us across the mountains. Is it not so,\nO king?\"\n\nIgnosi covered his face with his hands for a while before answering.\n\n\"My heart is sore,\" he said at last; \"your words split my heart in\ntwain. What have I done to you, Incubu, Macumazahn, and Bougwan, that\nye should leave me desolate? Ye who stood by me in rebellion and in\nbattle, will ye leave me in the day of peace and victory? What will\nye--wives? Choose from among the maidens! A place to live in? Behold,\nthe land is yours as far as ye can see. The white man's houses? Ye\nshall teach my people how to build them. Cattle for beef and milk?\nEvery married man shall bring you an ox or a cow. Wild game to hunt?\nDoes not the elephant walk through my forests, and the river-horse\nsleep in the reeds? Would ye make war? My Impis wait your word. If\nthere is anything more which I can give, that will I give you.\"\n\n\"Nay, Ignosi, we want none of these things,\" I answered; \"we would seek\nour own place.\"\n\n\"Now do I learn,\" said Ignosi bitterly, and with flashing eyes, \"that\nye love the bright stones more than me, your friend. Ye have the\nstones; now ye would go to Natal and across the moving black water and\nsell them, and be rich, as it is the desire of a white man's heart to\nbe. Cursed for your sake be the white stones, and cursed he who seeks\nthem. Death shall it be to him who sets foot in the place of Death to\nfind them. I have spoken. White men, ye can go.\"\n\nI laid my hand upon his arm. \"Ignosi,\" I said, \"tell us, when thou\ndidst wander in Zululand, and among the white people of Natal, did not\nthine heart turn to the land thy mother told thee of, thy native place,\nwhere thou didst see the light, and play when thou wast little, the\nland where thy place was?\"\n\n\"It was even so, Macumazahn.\"\n\n\"In like manner, Ignosi, do our hearts turn to our land and to our own\nplace.\"\n\nThen came a silence. When Ignosi broke it, it was in a different voice.\n\n\"I do perceive that now as ever thy words are wise and full of reason,\nMacumazahn; that which flies in the air loves not to run along the\nground; the white man loves not to live on the level of the black or to\nhouse among his kraals. Well, ye must go, and leave my heart sore,\nbecause ye will be as dead to me, since from where ye are no tidings\ncan come to me.\n\n\"But listen, and let all your brothers know my words. No other white\nman shall cross the mountains, even if any man live to come so far. I\nwill see no traders with their guns and gin. My people shall fight with\nthe spear, and drink water, like their forefathers before them. I will\nhave no praying-men to put a fear of death into men's hearts, to stir\nthem up against the law of the king, and make a path for the white folk\nwho follow to run on. If a white man comes to my gates I will send him\nback; if a hundred come I will push them back; if armies come, I will\nmake war on them with all my strength, and they shall not prevail\nagainst me. None shall ever seek for the shining stones: no, not an\narmy, for if they come I will send a regiment and fill up the pit, and\nbreak down the white columns in the caves and choke them with rocks, so\nthat none can reach even to that door of which ye speak, and whereof\nthe way to move it is lost. But for you three, Incubu, Macumazahn, and\nBougwan, the path is always open; for, behold, ye are dearer to me than\naught that breathes.\n\n\"And ye would go. Infadoos, my uncle, and my Induna, shall take you by\nthe hand and guide you with a regiment. There is, as I have learned,\nanother way across the mountains that he shall show you. Farewell, my\nbrothers, brave white men. See me no more, for I have no heart to bear\nit. Behold! I make a decree, and it shall be published from the\nmountains to the mountains; your names, Incubu, Macumazahn, and\nBougwan, shall be \"_hlonipa_\" even as the names of dead kings, and he\nwho speaks them shall die.[1] So shall your memory be preserved in the\nland for ever.\n\n\"Go now, ere my eyes rain tears like a woman's. At times as ye look\nback down the path of life, or when ye are old and gather yourselves\ntogether to crouch before the fire, because for you the sun has no more\nheat, ye will think of how we stood shoulder to shoulder, in that great\nbattle which thy wise words planned, Macumazahn; of how thou wast the\npoint of the horn that galled Twala's flank, Bougwan; whilst thou stood\nin the ring of the Greys, Incubu, and men went down before thine axe\nlike corn before a sickle; ay, and of how thou didst break that wild\nbull Twala's strength, and bring his pride to dust. Fare ye well for\never, Incubu, Macumazahn, and Bougwan, my lords and my friends.\"\n\nIgnosi rose and looked earnestly at us for a few seconds. Then he threw\nthe corner of his karross over his head, so as to cover his face from\nus.\n\nWe went in silence.\n\n\nNext day at dawn we left Loo, escorted by our old friend Infadoos, who\nwas heart-broken at our departure, and by the regiment of Buffaloes.\nEarly as was the hour, all the main street of the town was lined with\nmultitudes of people, who gave us the royal salute as we passed at the\nhead of the regiment, while the women blessed us for having rid the\nland of Twala, throwing flowers before us as we went. It was really\nvery affecting, and not the sort of thing one is accustomed to meet\nwith from natives.\n\nOne ludicrous incident occurred, however, which I rather welcomed, as\nit gave us something to laugh at.\n\nJust before we reached the confines of the town, a pretty young girl,\nwith some lovely lilies in her hand, ran forward and presented them to\nGood--somehow they all seemed to like Good; I think his eye-glass and\nsolitary whisker gave him a fictitious value--and then said that she\nhad a boon to ask.\n\n\"Speak on,\" he answered.\n\n\"Let my lord show his servant his beautiful white legs, that his\nservant may look upon them, and remember them all her days, and tell of\nthem to her children; his servant has travelled four days' journey to\nsee them, for the fame of them has gone throughout the land.\"\n\n\"I'll be hanged if I do!\" exclaimed Good excitedly.\n\n\"Come, come, my dear fellow,\" said Sir Henry, \"you can't refuse to\noblige a lady.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" replied Good obstinately; \"it is positively indecent.\"\n\nHowever, in the end he consented to draw up his trousers to the knee,\namidst notes of rapturous admiration from all the women present,\nespecially the gratified young lady, and in this guise he had to walk\ntill we got clear of the town.\n\nGood's legs, I fear, will never be so greatly admired again. Of his\nmelting teeth, and even of his \"transparent eye,\" the Kukuanas wearied\nmore or less, but of his legs never.\n\nAs we travelled, Infadoos told us that there was another pass over the\nmountains to the north of the one followed by Solomon's Great Road, or\nrather that there was a place where it was possible to climb down the\nwall of cliff which separates Kukuanaland from the desert, and is\nbroken by the towering shapes of Sheba's Breasts. It appeared, also,\nthat rather more than two years previously a party of Kukuana hunters\nhad descended this path into the desert in search of ostriches, whose\nplumes are much prized among them for war head-dresses, and that in the\ncourse of their hunt they had been led far from the mountains and were\nmuch troubled by thirst. Seeing trees on the horizon, however, they\nwalked towards them, and discovered a large and fertile oasis some\nmiles in extent, and plentifully watered. It was by way of this oasis\nthat Infadoos suggested we should return, and the idea seemed to us a\ngood one, for it appeared that we should thus escape the rigours of the\nmountain pass. Also some of the hunters were in attendance to guide us\nto the oasis, from which, they stated, they could perceive other\nfertile spots far away in the desert.[2]\n\nTravelling easily, on the night of the fourth day's journey we found\nourselves once more on the crest of the mountains that separate\nKukuanaland from the desert, which rolled away in sandy billows at our\nfeet, and about twenty-five miles to the north of Sheba's Breasts.\n\nAt dawn on the following day, we were led to the edge of a very\nprecipitous chasm, by which we were to descend the precipice, and gain\nthe plain two thousand and more feet below.\n\nHere we bade farewell to that true friend and sturdy old warrior,\nInfadoos, who solemnly wished all good upon us, and nearly wept with\ngrief. \"Never, my lords,\" he said, \"shall mine old eyes see the like of\nyou again. Ah! the way that Incubu cut his men down in the battle! Ah!\nfor the sight of that stroke with which he swept off my brother Twala's\nhead! It was beautiful--beautiful! I may never hope to see such\nanother, except perchance in happy dreams.\"\n\nWe were very sorry to part from him; indeed, Good was so moved that he\ngave him as a souvenir--what do you think?--an _eye-glass_; afterwards\nwe discovered that it was a spare one. Infadoos was delighted,\nforeseeing that the possession of such an article would increase his\nprestige enormously, and after several vain attempts he actually\nsucceeded in screwing it into his own eye. Anything more incongruous\nthan the old warrior looked with an eye-glass I never saw. Eye-glasses\ndo not go well with leopard-skin cloaks and black ostrich plumes.\n\nThen, after seeing that our guides were well laden with water and\nprovisions, and having received a thundering farewell salute from the\nBuffaloes, we wrung Infadoos by the hand, and began our downward climb.\nA very arduous business it proved to be, but somehow that evening we\nfound ourselves at the bottom without accident.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Sir Henry that night, as we sat by our fire and\ngazed up at the beetling cliffs above us, \"I think that there are worse\nplaces than Kukuanaland in the world, and that I have known unhappier\ntimes than the last month or two, though I have never spent such queer\nones. Eh! you fellows?\"\n\n\"I almost wish I were back,\" said Good, with a sigh.\n\nAs for myself, I reflected that all's well that ends well; but in the\ncourse of a long life of shaves, I never had such shaves as those which\nI had recently experienced. The thought of that battle makes me feel\ncold all over, and as for our experience in the treasure chamber--!\n\n\nNext morning we started on a toilsome trudge across the desert, having\nwith us a good supply of water carried by our five guides, and camped\nthat night in the open, marching again at dawn on the morrow.\n\nBy noon of the third day's journey we could see the trees of the oasis\nof which the guides spoke, and within an hour of sundown we were\nwalking once more upon grass and listening to the sound of running\nwater.\n\n\n[1] This extraordinary and negative way of showing intense respect is\nby no means unknown among African people, and the result is that if, as\nis usual, the name in question has a significance, the meaning must be\nexpressed by an idiom or other word. In this way a memory is preserved\nfor generations, or until the new word utterly supplants the old.\n\n[2] It often puzzled all of us to understand how it was possible that\nIgnosi's mother, bearing the child with her, should have survived the\ndangers of her journey across the mountains and the desert, dangers\nwhich so nearly proved fatal to ourselves. It has since occurred to me,\nand I give the idea to the reader for what it is worth, that she must\nhave taken this second route, and wandered out like Hagar into the\nwilderness. If she did so, there is no longer anything inexplicable\nabout the story, since, as Ignosi himself related, she may well have\nbeen picked up by some ostrich hunters before she or the child was\nexhausted, was led by them to the oasis, and thence by stages to the\nfertile country, and so on by slow degrees southwards to Zululand.--A.Q.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nFOUND\n\nAnd now I come to perhaps the strangest adventure that happened to us\nin all this strange business, and one which shows how wonderfully\nthings are brought about.\n\nI was walking along quietly, some way in front of the other two, down\nthe banks of the stream which runs from the oasis till it is swallowed\nup in the hungry desert sands, when suddenly I stopped and rubbed my\neyes, as well I might. There, not twenty yards in front of me, placed\nin a charming situation, under the shade of a species of fig-tree, and\nfacing to the stream, was a cosy hut, built more or less on the Kafir\nprinciple with grass and withes, but having a full-length door instead\nof a bee-hole.\n\n\"What the dickens,\" said I to myself, \"can a hut be doing here?\" Even\nas I said it the door of the hut opened, and there limped out of it a\n_white man_ clothed in skins, and with an enormous black beard. I\nthought that I must have got a touch of the sun. It was impossible. No\nhunter ever came to such a place as this. Certainly no hunter would\never settle in it. I stared and stared, and so did the other man, and\njust at that juncture Sir Henry and Good walked up.\n\n\"Look here, you fellows,\" I said, \"is that a white man, or am I mad?\"\n\nSir Henry looked, and Good looked, and then all of a sudden the lame\nwhite man with a black beard uttered a great cry, and began hobbling\ntowards us. When he was close he fell down in a sort of faint.\n\nWith a spring Sir Henry was by his side.\n\n\"Great Powers!\" he cried, \"_it is my brother George!_\"\n\nAt the sound of this disturbance, another figure, also clad in skins,\nemerged from the hut, a gun in his hand, and ran towards us. On seeing\nme he too gave a cry.\n\n\"Macumazahn,\" he halloed, \"don't you know me, Baas? I'm Jim the hunter.\nI lost the note you gave me to give to the Baas, and we have been here\nnearly two years.\" And the fellow fell at my feet, and rolled over and\nover, weeping for joy.\n\n\"You careless scoundrel!\" I said; \"you ought to be well\n_sjambocked_\"--that is, hided.\n\nMeanwhile the man with the black beard had recovered and risen, and he\nand Sir Henry were pump-handling away at each other, apparently without\na word to say. But whatever they had quarrelled about in the past--I\nsuspect it was a lady, though I never asked--it was evidently forgotten\nnow.\n\n\"My dear old fellow,\" burst out Sir Henry at last, \"I thought you were\ndead. I have been over Solomon's Mountains to find you. I had given up\nall hope of ever seeing you again, and now I come across you perched in\nthe desert, like an old _assvoegel_.\"[1]\n\n\"I tried to cross Solomon's Mountains nearly two years ago,\" was the\nanswer, spoken in the hesitating voice of a man who has had little\nrecent opportunity of using his tongue, \"but when I reached here a\nboulder fell on my leg and crushed it, and I have been able to go\nneither forward nor back.\"\n\nThen I came up. \"How do you do, Mr. Neville?\" I said; \"do you remember\nme?\"\n\n\"Why,\" he said, \"isn't it Hunter Quatermain, eh, and Good too? Hold on\na minute, you fellows, I am getting dizzy again. It is all so very\nstrange, and, when a man has ceased to hope, so very happy!\"\n\nThat evening, over the camp fire, George Curtis told us his story,\nwhich, in its way, was almost as eventful as our own, and, put shortly,\namounted to this. A little less than two years before, he had started\nfrom Sitanda's Kraal, to try to reach Suliman's Berg. As for the note I\nhad sent him by Jim, that worthy lost it, and he had never heard of it\ntill to-day. But, acting upon information he had received from the\nnatives, he headed not for Sheba's Breasts, but for the ladder-like\ndescent of the mountains down which we had just come, which is clearly\na better route than that marked out in old Dom Silvestra's plan. In the\ndesert he and Jim had suffered great hardships, but finally they\nreached this oasis, where a terrible accident befell George Curtis. On\nthe day of their arrival he was sitting by the stream, and Jim was\nextracting the honey from the nest of a stingless bee which is to be\nfound in the desert, on the top of a bank immediately above him. In so\ndoing he loosened a great boulder of rock, which fell upon George\nCurtis's right leg, crushing it frightfully. From that day he had been\nso lame that he found it impossible to go either forward or back, and\nhad preferred to take the chances of dying in the oasis to the\ncertainty of perishing in the desert.\n\nAs for food, however, they got on pretty well, for they had a good\nsupply of ammunition, and the oasis was frequented, especially at\nnight, by large quantities of game, which came thither for water. These\nthey shot, or trapped in pitfalls, using the flesh for food, and, after\ntheir clothes wore out, the hides for clothing.\n\n\"And so,\" George Curtis ended, \"we have lived for nearly two years,\nlike a second Robinson Crusoe and his man Friday, hoping against hope\nthat some natives might come here to help us away, but none have come.\nOnly last night we settled that Jim should leave me, and try to reach\nSitanda's Kraal to get assistance. He was to go to-morrow, but I had\nlittle hope of ever seeing him back again. And now _you_, of all people\nin the world, _you_, who, as I fancied, had long ago forgotten all\nabout me, and were living comfortably in old England, turn up in a\npromiscuous way and find me where you least expected. It is the most\nwonderful thing that I have ever heard of, and the most merciful too.\"\n\nThen Sir Henry set to work, and told him the main facts of our\nadventures, sitting till late into the night to do it.\n\n\"By Jove!\" said George Curtis, when I showed him some of the diamonds:\n\"well, at least you have got something for your pains, besides my\nworthless self.\"\n\nSir Henry laughed. \"They belong to Quatermain and Good. It was a part\nof the bargain that they should divide any spoils there might be.\"\n\nThis remark set me thinking, and having spoken to Good, I told Sir\nHenry that it was our joint wish that he should take a third portion of\nthe diamonds, or, if he would not, that his share should be handed to\nhis brother, who had suffered even more than ourselves on the chance of\ngetting them. Finally, we prevailed upon him to consent to this\narrangement, but George Curtis did not know of it until some time\nafterwards.\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nHere, at this point, I think that I shall end my history. Our journey\nacross the desert back to Sitanda's Kraal was most arduous, especially\nas we had to support George Curtis, whose right leg was very weak\nindeed, and continually threw out splinters of bone. But we did\naccomplish it somehow, and to give its details would only be to\nreproduce much of what happened to us on the former occasion.\n\nSix months from the date of our re-arrival at Sitanda's, where we found\nour guns and other goods quite safe, though the old rascal in charge\nwas much disgusted at our surviving to claim them, saw us all once more\nsafe and sound at my little place on the Berea, near Durban, where I am\nnow writing. Thence I bid farewell to all who have accompanied me\nthrough the strangest trip I ever made in the course of a long and\nvaried experience.\n\nP.S.--Just as I had written the last word, a Kafir came up my avenue of\norange trees, carrying a letter in a cleft stick, which he had brought\nfrom the post. It turned out to be from Sir Henry, and as it speaks for\nitself I give it in full.\n\n  October 1, 1884.\n  Brayley Hall, Yorkshire.\n\n  My Dear Quatermain,\n\n  I send you a line a few mails back to say that the three of us,\n  George, Good, and myself, fetched up all right in England. We got\n  off the boat at Southampton, and went up to town. You should have\n  seen what a swell Good turned out the very next day, beautifully\n  shaved, frock coat fitting like a glove, brand new eye-glass,\n  etc., etc. I went and walked in the park with him, where I met\n  some people I know, and at once told them the story of his\n  \"beautiful white legs.\"\n\n  He is furious, especially as some ill-natured person has printed\n  it in a Society paper.\n\n  To come to business, Good and I took the diamonds to Streeter's to\n  be valued, as we arranged, and really I am afraid to tell you what\n  they put them at, it seems so enormous. They say that of course it\n  is more or less guess-work, as such stones have never to their\n  knowledge been put on the market in anything like such quantities.\n  It appears that (with the exception of one or two of the largest)\n  they are of the finest water, and equal in every way to the best\n  Brazilian stones. I asked them if they would buy them, but they\n  said that it was beyond their power to do so, and recommended us\n  to sell by degrees, over a period of years indeed, for fear lest\n  we should flood the market. They offer, however, a hundred and\n  eighty thousand for a very small portion of them.\n\n  You must come home, Quatermain, and see about these things,\n  especially if you insist upon making the magnificent present of\n  the third share, which does _not_ belong to me, to my brother\n  George. As for Good, he is _no good_. His time is too much\n  occupied in shaving, and other matters connected with the vain\n  adorning of the body. But I think he is still down on his luck\n  about Foulata. He told me that since he had been home he hadn't\n  seen a woman to touch her, either as regards her figure or the\n  sweetness of her expression.\n\n  I want you to come home, my dear old comrade, and to buy a house\n  near here. You have done your day's work, and have lots of money\n  now, and there is a place for sale quite close which would suit\n  you admirably. Do come; the sooner the better; you can finish\n  writing the story of our adventures on board ship. We have refused\n  to tell the tale till it is written by you, for fear lest we shall\n  not be believed. If you start on receipt of this you will reach\n  here by Christmas, and I book you to stay with me for that. Good\n  is coming, and George; and so, by the way, is your boy Harry\n  (there's a bribe for you). I have had him down for a week's\n  shooting, and like him. He is a cool young hand; he shot me in the\n  leg, cut out the pellets, and then remarked upon the advantages of\n  having a medical student with every shooting party!\n\n  Good-bye, old boy; I can't say any more, but I know that you will\n  come, if it is only to oblige\n\n  Your sincere friend,\n  Henry Curtis.\n\n  P.S.--The tusks of the great bull that killed poor Khiva have now\n  been put up in the hall here, over the pair of buffalo horns you\n  gave me, and look magnificent; and the axe with which I chopped\n  off Twala's head is fixed above my writing-table. I wish that we\n  could have managed to bring away the coats of chain armour. Don't\n  lose poor Foulata's basket in which you brought away the diamonds.\n\n  H.C.\n\nTo-day is Tuesday. There is a steamer going on Friday, and I really\nthink that I must take Curtis at his word, and sail by her for England,\nif it is only to see you, Harry, my boy, and to look after the printing\nof this history, which is a task that I do not like to trust to anybody\nelse.\n\n\nALLAN QUATERMAIN.\n\n\n[1] Vulture.", "title": "King Solomon's Mines"}

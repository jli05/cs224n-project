{"summary": "Dr. James Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to investigate the death of his friend, Sir Charles Baskerville. Sir Charles died at his Devonshire estate, Baskerville Hall, and Mortimer now fears for Sir Charles's nephew and sole heir, Sir Henry Baskerville. The death was attributed to a heart attack, but Mortimer is suspicious because Sir Charles died with an expression of horror on his face and Mortimer noticed \"the footprints of a gigantic hound\" nearby. The Baskerville family has supposedly been under a curse since the era of the English Civil War, when Hugo Baskerville offered his soul to the devil for help in abducting a woman and was reportedly killed by a giant spectral hound. Sir Charles believed in the curse and was apparently running away from something when he died.\nIntrigued, Holmes meets with Sir Henry, newly arrived from Canada. Sir Henry has received an anonymous telegram warning him away from the moors, and one of his new boots is inexplicably missing from his London hotel room. The Baskerville family is discussed: Sir Charles was the eldest of three brothers; the youngest, black sheep Rodger, is believed to have died childless in South America, while Sir Henry is the only child of the middle brother. Sir Henry plans to go to Baskerville Hall, despite the telegram. Holmes and Dr. Watson follow him from Holmes's Baker Street apartment back to his hotel and notice a bearded man following him in a cab; they pursue the man, but he escapes. Mortimer tells them that Mr. Barrymore, the servant at Baskerville Hall, has a beard. Sir Henry's boot reappears, but an older one vanishes.\n\nHolmes dispatches Watson to accompany Sir Henry to Baskerville Hall. They learn that an escaped murderer named Selden is believed to be in the area. Barrymore and his wife wish to leave the estate soon. Watson hears a woman crying in the night; it's obvious to him that it was Mrs. Barrymore, but her husband denies it. Watson has no proof that Barrymore was in Devon on the day of the chase in London. He meets a brother and sister who live nearby: Mr. Stapleton, a naturalist, and the beautiful Miss Stapleton. When an animalistic sound is heard, Stapleton is quick to dismiss it as unrelated to the legendary hound. When her brother is out of earshot, Miss Stapleton mistakes Watson for Sir Henry and warns him to leave. She and Sir Henry later meet and quickly fall in love, arousing Stapleton's anger; he later apologizes and invites Sir Henry to dine with him a few days later.\n\nBarrymore arouses further suspicion when Watson and Sir Henry catch him at night with a candle in an empty room. Barrymore refuses to answer their questions, but Mrs. Barrymore confesses that Selden is her brother and her husband is signalling that they have left supplies for him. Watson and Sir Henry pursue Selden on the moor but he eludes them, while Watson notices another man on a nearby tor. After an agreement is reached to allow Selden to flee the country, Barrymore reveals the contents of an incompletely burnt letter asking Sir Charles to be at the gate at the time of his death. It was signed with the initials L.L.; on Mortimer's advice, Watson questions a Laura Lyons, who admits to writing the letter in hopes that Sir Charles would help finance her divorce, but says she didn't keep the appointment. Watson tracks the second man he saw in the area and discovers it to be Holmes, investigating independently in hopes of a faster resolution. Holmes reveals further information: Stapleton is actually married to the supposed Miss Stapleton, and he also promised marriage to Laura Lyons to get her cooperation. They hear a scream and discover the body of Selden, dead from a fall. They initially mistake him for Sir Henry, whose old clothes he was wearing.\nAt Baskerville Hall, Holmes notices a resemblance between Stapleton and a portrait of Hugo Baskerville. He realises that Stapleton could be an unknown Baskerville family member, seeking to claim the Baskerville wealth by eliminating his relatives. Accompanied by Inspector Lestrade, whom Holmes has summoned, Holmes and Watson travel to the Stapleton home, where Sir Henry is dining. They rescue him from a hound that Stapleton releases while Sir Henry is walking home across the moor. It had been painted with phosphorus to give it a hellish appearance. They find Mrs. Stapleton bound and gagged inside the house, while Stapleton apparently dies in an attempt to reach his hideout in a nearby mire. They also find Sir Henry's boot, used to give the hound his scent.\nWeeks later, Holmes provides Watson with additional details about the case. Stapleton was in fact Rodger Baskerville's son, also named Rodger. His now-widow is a South American woman, the former Beryl Garcia. He supported himself through crime for many years, before learning that he could inherit a fortune by murdering his uncle and cousin. Stapleton had taken Sir Henry's old boot because the new and little-worn one lacked his scent; the hound had pursued Selden to his death because of the scent on Sir Henry's old clothes. Mrs. Stapleton had disavowed her husband's plot, so he imprisoned her to prevent her from interfering.\n\n", "full_text": "THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES\n\nBy A. Conan Doyle\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1. Mr. Sherlock Holmes\n\n\n\nMr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save\nupon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated\nat the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the\nstick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a\nfine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as\na \"Penang lawyer.\" Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly\nan inch across. \"To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the\nC.C.H.,\" was engraved upon it, with the date \"1884.\" It was just such a\nstick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry--dignified,\nsolid, and reassuring.\n\n\"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?\"\n\nHolmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of\nmy occupation.\n\n\"How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back\nof your head.\"\n\n\"I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of\nme,\" said he. \"But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor's\nstick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no\nnotion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance.\nLet me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said I, following as far as I could the methods of my\ncompanion, \"that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man,\nwell-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their\nappreciation.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Holmes. \"Excellent!\"\n\n\"I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country\npractitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot.\"\n\n\"Why so?\"\n\n\"Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so\nknocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it.\nThe thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a\ngreat amount of walking with it.\"\n\n\"Perfectly sound!\" said Holmes.\n\n\"And then again, there is the 'friends of the C.C.H.' I should guess\nthat to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has\npossibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small\npresentation in return.\"\n\n\"Really, Watson, you excel yourself,\" said Holmes, pushing back his\nchair and lighting a cigarette. \"I am bound to say that in all the\naccounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small\nachievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may\nbe that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of\nlight. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of\nstimulating it. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in your\ndebt.\"\n\nHe had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave\nme keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my\nadmiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to\nhis methods. I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his\nsystem as to apply it in a way which earned his approval. He now took\nthe stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked\neyes. Then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette,\nand carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a\nconvex lens.\n\n\"Interesting, though elementary,\" said he as he returned to his\nfavourite corner of the settee. \"There are certainly one or two\nindications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several\ndeductions.\"\n\n\"Has anything escaped me?\" I asked with some self-importance. \"I trust\nthat there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?\"\n\n\"I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were\nerroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that\nin noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth.\nNot that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a\ncountry practitioner. And he walks a good deal.\"\n\n\"Then I was right.\"\n\n\"To that extent.\"\n\n\"But that was all.\"\n\n\"No, no, my dear Watson, not all--by no means all. I would suggest, for\nexample, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a\nhospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials 'C.C.' are placed\nbefore that hospital the words 'Charing Cross' very naturally suggest\nthemselves.\"\n\n\"You may be right.\"\n\n\"The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a\nworking hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our\nconstruction of this unknown visitor.\"\n\n\"Well, then, supposing that 'C.C.H.' does stand for 'Charing Cross\nHospital,' what further inferences may we draw?\"\n\n\"Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!\"\n\n\"I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised\nin town before going to the country.\"\n\n\"I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it\nin this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a\npresentation would be made? When would his friends unite to give him\na pledge of their good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer\nwithdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice\nfor himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has\nbeen a change from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then,\nstretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the\noccasion of the change?\"\n\n\"It certainly seems probable.\"\n\n\"Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the\nhospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could\nhold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country.\nWhat was he, then? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he\ncould only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician--little more\nthan a senior student. And he left five years ago--the date is on the\nstick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into\nthin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty,\namiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite\ndog, which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and\nsmaller than a mastiff.\"\n\nI laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and\nblew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.\n\n\"As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,\" said I, \"but\nat least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the\nman's age and professional career.\" From my small medical shelf I took\ndown the Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several\nMortimers, but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record\naloud.\n\n        \"Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.\n        House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.\n        Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology,\n        with essay entitled 'Is Disease a Reversion?'  Corresponding\n        member of the Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of\n        'Some Freaks of Atavism' (Lancet 1882).  'Do We Progress?'\n        (Journal of Psychology, March, 1883).  Medical Officer\n        for the parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.\"\n\n\"No mention of that local hunt, Watson,\" said Holmes with a mischievous\nsmile, \"but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think\nthat I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to the adjectives, I\nsaid, if I remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded.\nIt is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who\nreceives testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London\ncareer for the country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his\nstick and not his visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.\"\n\n\"And the dog?\"\n\n\"Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master. Being a\nheavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of\nhis teeth are very plainly visible. The dog's jaw, as shown in the space\nbetween these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not\nbroad enough for a mastiff. It may have been--yes, by Jove, it is a\ncurly-haired spaniel.\"\n\nHe had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess\nof the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I\nglanced up in surprise.\n\n\"My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?\"\n\n\"For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very\ndoor-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don't move, I beg you,\nWatson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be\nof assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when\nyou hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you\nknow not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man\nof science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!\"\n\nThe appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected\na typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, with a\nlong nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes,\nset closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of\ngold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly\nfashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though\nyoung, his long back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward\nthrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence. As he\nentered his eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes's hand, and he ran\ntowards it with an exclamation of joy. \"I am so very glad,\" said he.\n\"I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I\nwould not lose that stick for the world.\"\n\n\"A presentation, I see,\" said Holmes.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"From Charing Cross Hospital?\"\n\n\"From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear, that's bad!\" said Holmes, shaking his head.\n\nDr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment. \"Why was\nit bad?\"\n\n\"Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your marriage,\nyou say?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of\na consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home of my own.\"\n\n\"Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,\" said Holmes. \"And now,\nDr. James Mortimer--\"\n\n\"Mister, sir, Mister--a humble M.R.C.S.\"\n\n\"And a man of precise mind, evidently.\"\n\n\"A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the shores\nof the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes\nwhom I am addressing and not--\"\n\n\"No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.\"\n\n\"Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in connection\nwith that of your friend. You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes. I\nhad hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked\nsupra-orbital development. Would you have any objection to my running my\nfinger along your parietal fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until\nthe original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological\nmuseum. It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet\nyour skull.\"\n\nSherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. \"You are an\nenthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in\nmine,\" said he. \"I observe from your forefinger that you make your own\ncigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.\"\n\nThe man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other\nwith surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers as agile and\nrestless as the antennae of an insect.\n\nHolmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest\nwhich he took in our curious companion. \"I presume, sir,\" said he at\nlast, \"that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that\nyou have done me the honour to call here last night and again today?\"\n\n\"No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing\nthat as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that I am\nmyself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a\nmost serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you\nare the second highest expert in Europe--\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?\" asked\nHolmes with some asperity.\n\n\"To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon\nmust always appeal strongly.\"\n\n\"Then had you not better consult him?\"\n\n\"I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man\nof affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I\nhave not inadvertently--\"\n\n\"Just a little,\" said Holmes. \"I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do\nwisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the\nexact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2. The Curse of the Baskervilles\n\n\n\n\"I have in my pocket a manuscript,\" said Dr. James Mortimer.\n\n\"I observed it as you entered the room,\" said Holmes.\n\n\"It is an old manuscript.\"\n\n\"Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.\"\n\n\"How can you say that, sir?\"\n\n\"You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time\nthat you have been talking. It would be a poor expert who could not give\nthe date of a document within a decade or so. You may possibly have read\nmy little monograph upon the subject. I put that at 1730.\"\n\n\"The exact date is 1742.\" Dr. Mortimer drew it from his breast-pocket.\n\"This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville,\nwhose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much\nexcitement in Devonshire. I may say that I was his personal friend as\nwell as his medical attendant. He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd,\npractical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this\ndocument very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end\nas did eventually overtake him.\"\n\nHolmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon\nhis knee. \"You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s\nand the short. It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix\nthe date.\"\n\nI looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script. At\nthe head was written: \"Baskerville Hall,\" and below in large, scrawling\nfigures: \"1742.\"\n\n\"It appears to be a statement of some sort.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the\nBaskerville family.\"\n\n\"But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon\nwhich you wish to consult me?\"\n\n\"Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided\nwithin twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and is intimately\nconnected with the affair. With your permission I will read it to you.\"\n\nHolmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and\nclosed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer turned the\nmanuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking voice the following\ncurious, old-world narrative:\n\n        \"Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there\n        have been many statements, yet as I come in a direct\n        line from Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story from\n        my father, who also had it from his, I have set it down\n        with all belief that it occurred even as is here set\n        forth.  And I would have you believe, my sons, that the\n        same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously\n        forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer\n        and repentance it may be removed.  Learn then from this\n        story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to\n        be circumspect in the future, that those foul passions\n        whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not\n        again be loosed to our undoing.\n\n        \"Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the\n        history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most\n        earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of\n        Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be\n        gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless\n        man.  This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned,\n        seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts,\n        but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour\n        which made his name a by-word through the West.  It\n        chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed, so dark\n        a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter\n        of a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate.\n        But the young maiden, being discreet and of good repute,\n        would ever avoid him, for she feared his evil name.  So\n        it came to pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, with five\n        or six of his idle and wicked companions, stole down upon\n        the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and\n        brothers being from home, as he well knew.  When they had\n        brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper\n        chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long\n        carouse, as was their nightly custom.  Now, the poor lass\n        upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing\n        and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from\n        below, for they say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville,\n        when he was in wine, were such as might blast the man who\n        said them.  At last in the stress of her fear she did that\n        which might have daunted the bravest or most active man,\n        for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and\n        still covers) the south wall she came down from under the\n        eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three\n        leagues betwixt the Hall and her father's farm.\n\n        \"It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his\n        guests to carry food and drink--with other worse things,\n        perchance--to his captive, and so found the cage empty\n        and the bird escaped.  Then, as it would seem, he became\n        as one that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs\n        into the dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table,\n        flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he cried\n        aloud before all the company that he would that very\n        night render his body and soul to the Powers of Evil if\n        he might but overtake the wench.  And while the revellers\n        stood aghast at the fury of the man, one more wicked or,\n        it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out that\n        they should put the hounds upon her.  Whereat Hugo ran\n        from the house, crying to his grooms that they should\n        saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the\n        hounds a kerchief of the maid's, he swung them to the\n        line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor.\n\n        \"Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable\n        to understand all that had been done in such haste.  But\n        anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed\n        which was like to be done upon the moorlands.  Everything\n        was now in an uproar, some calling for their pistols,\n        some for their horses, and some for another flask of\n        wine.  But at length some sense came back to their crazed\n        minds, and the whole of them, thirteen in number, took\n        horse and started in pursuit.  The moon shone clear above\n        them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course\n        which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach\n        her own home.\n\n        \"They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the\n        night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to\n        him to know if he had seen the hunt.  And the man, as\n        the story goes, was so crazed with fear that he could\n        scarce speak, but at last he said that he had indeed seen\n        the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track.  'But\n        I have seen more than that,' said he, 'for Hugo Baskerville\n        passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind\n        him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at\n        my heels.'  So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd\n        and rode onward.  But soon their skins turned cold, for\n        there came a galloping across the moor, and the black\n        mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing\n        bridle and empty saddle.  Then the revellers rode close\n        together, for a great fear was on them, but they still\n        followed over the moor, though each, had he been alone,\n        would have been right glad to have turned his horse's\n        head.  Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last\n        upon the hounds.  These, though known for their valour\n        and their breed, were whimpering in a cluster at the\n        head of a deep dip or goyal, as we call it, upon the\n        moor, some slinking away and some, with starting hackles\n        and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before them.\n\n        \"The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you\n        may guess, than when they started.  The most of them\n        would by no means advance, but three of them, the boldest,\n        or it may be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal.\n        Now, it opened into a broad space in which stood two of\n        those great stones, still to be seen there, which were\n        set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old.\n        The moon was shining bright upon the clearing, and there\n        in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen,\n        dead of fear and of fatigue.  But it was not the sight\n        of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo\n        Baskerville lying near her, which raised the hair upon\n        the heads of these three dare-devil roysterers, but it\n        was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at his throat,\n        there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped\n        like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal\n        eye has rested upon.  And even as they looked the thing\n        tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it\n        turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the\n        three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life, still\n        screaming, across the moor.  One, it is said, died that\n        very night of what he had seen, and the other twain were\n        but broken men for the rest of their days.\n\n        \"Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound\n        which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever\n        since.  If I have set it down it is because that which\n        is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but\n        hinted at and guessed.  Nor can it be denied that many\n        of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which\n        have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious.  Yet may we\n        shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence,\n        which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that\n        third or fourth generation which is threatened in Holy\n        Writ.  To that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend\n        you, and I counsel you by way of caution to forbear from\n        crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of\n        evil are exalted.\n\n        \"[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John,\n        with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their\n        sister Elizabeth.]\"\n\nWhen Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed\nhis spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock\nHolmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the\nfire.\n\n\"Well?\" said he.\n\n\"Do you not find it interesting?\"\n\n\"To a collector of fairy tales.\"\n\nDr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. This\nis the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this year. It is a short\naccount of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville\nwhich occurred a few days before that date.\"\n\nMy friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent. Our\nvisitor readjusted his glasses and began:\n\n        \"The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose\n        name has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate\n        for Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over\n        the county.  Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville\n        Hall for a comparatively short period his amiability of\n        character and extreme generosity had won the affection\n        and respect of all who had been brought into contact with\n        him.  In these days of nouveaux riches it is refreshing\n        to find a case where the scion of an old county family\n        which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his own\n        fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the\n        fallen grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is well known,\n        made large sums of money in South African speculation.\n        More wise than those who go on until the wheel turns\n        against them, he realized his gains and returned to England\n        with them.  It is only two years since he took up his\n        residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how\n        large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement\n        which have been interrupted by his death.  Being himself\n        childless, it was his openly expressed desire that the\n        whole countryside should, within his own lifetime, profit\n        by his good fortune, and many will have personal reasons\n        for bewailing his untimely end.  His generous donations\n        to local and county charities have been frequently\n        chronicled in these columns.\n\n        \"The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles\n        cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the\n        inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of\n        those rumours to which local superstition has given rise.\n        There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to\n        imagine that death could be from any but natural causes.\n        Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to\n        have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind.\n        In spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his\n        personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Baskerville\n        Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the\n        husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper.\n        Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends,\n        tends to show that Sir Charles's health has for some time\n        been impaired, and points especially to some affection\n        of the heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour,\n        breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression.\n        Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of\n        the deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.\n\n        \"The facts of the case are simple.  Sir Charles Baskerville\n        was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking\n        down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall.  The evidence\n        of the Barrymores shows that this had been his custom.\n        On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his intention\n        of starting next day for London, and had ordered Barrymore\n        to prepare his luggage.  That night he went out as usual\n        for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in\n        the habit of smoking a cigar.  He never returned.  At\n        twelve o'clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still open,\n        became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in search\n        of his master.  The day had been wet, and Sir Charles's\n        footmarks were easily traced down the alley.  Halfway down\n        this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor.\n        There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some\n        little time here.  He then proceeded down the alley, and\n        it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered.\n        One fact which has not been explained is the statement\n        of Barrymore that his master's footprints altered their\n        character from the time that he passed the moor-gate, and\n        that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking\n        upon his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on\n        the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears\n        by his own confession to have been the worse for drink.\n        He declares that he heard cries but is unable to state\n        from what direction they came.  No signs of violence were\n        to be discovered upon Sir Charles's person, and though\n        the doctor's evidence pointed to an almost incredible\n        facial distortion--so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at\n        first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient\n        who lay before him--it was explained that that is a symptom\n        which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death from\n        cardiac exhaustion.  This explanation was borne out by\n        the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing\n        organic disease, and the coroner's jury returned a\n        verdict in accordance with the medical evidence.  It is\n        well that this is so, for it is obviously of the utmost\n        importance that Sir Charles's heir should settle at the\n        Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly\n        interrupted.  Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not\n        finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been\n        whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been\n        difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall.  It is\n        understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville,\n        if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville's\n        younger brother.  The young man when last heard of was\n        in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a\n        view to informing him of his good fortune.\"\n\nDr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket. \"Those\nare the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the death of Sir\nCharles Baskerville.\"\n\n\"I must thank you,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"for calling my attention to a\ncase which certainly presents some features of interest. I had observed\nsome newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied\nby that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige\nthe Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases. This\narticle, you say, contains all the public facts?\"\n\n\"It does.\"\n\n\"Then let me have the private ones.\" He leaned back, put his finger-tips\ntogether, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression.\n\n\"In doing so,\" said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of some\nstrong emotion, \"I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone.\nMy motive for withholding it from the coroner's inquiry is that a man of\nscience shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming\nto indorse a popular superstition. I had the further motive that\nBaskerville Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted\nif anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation.\nFor both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather\nless than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with\nyou there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.\n\n\"The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other\nare thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a good deal of\nSir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr. Frankland, of Lafter\nHall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of\neducation within many miles. Sir Charles was a retiring man, but the\nchance of his illness brought us together, and a community of interests\nin science kept us so. He had brought back much scientific information\nfrom South Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together\ndiscussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot.\n\n\"Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that\nSir Charles's nervous system was strained to the breaking point. He had\ntaken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart--so much\nso that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce\nhim to go out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it may appear to\nyou, Mr. Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung\nhis family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of\nhis ancestors were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence\nconstantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has asked me\nwhether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange\ncreature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter question he put\nto me several times, and always with a voice which vibrated with\nexcitement.\n\n\"I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three\nweeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall door. I had\ndescended from my gig and was standing in front of him, when I saw\nhis eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an\nexpression of the most dreadful horror. I whisked round and had just\ntime to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black\ncalf passing at the head of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he\nthat I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been\nand look around for it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared\nto make the worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with him all the\nevening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion which he\nhad shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative which I read to\nyou when first I came. I mention this small episode because it assumes\nsome importance in view of the tragedy which followed, but I was\nconvinced at the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his\nexcitement had no justification.\n\n\"It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London. His\nheart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in which he lived,\nhowever chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a\nserious effect upon his health. I thought that a few months among the\ndistractions of town would send him back a new man. Mr. Stapleton, a\nmutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health, was of the\nsame opinion. At the last instant came this terrible catastrophe.\n\n\"On the night of Sir Charles's death Barrymore the butler, who made\nthe discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was\nsitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of\nthe event. I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned\nat the inquest. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the\nspot at the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the\nchange in the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there\nwere no other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and\nfinally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until\nmy arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers dug\ninto the ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to\nsuch an extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. There was\ncertainly no physical injury of any kind. But one false statement was\nmade by Barrymore at the inquest. He said that there were no traces\nupon the ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did--some\nlittle distance off, but fresh and clear.\"\n\n\"Footprints?\"\n\n\"Footprints.\"\n\n\"A man's or a woman's?\"\n\nDr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank\nalmost to a whisper as he answered.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3. The Problem\n\n\n\nI confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a thrill\nin the doctor's voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by\nthat which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his\neyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly\ninterested.\n\n\"You saw this?\"\n\n\"As clearly as I see you.\"\n\n\"And you said nothing?\"\n\n\"What was the use?\"\n\n\"How was it that no one else saw it?\"\n\n\"The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them\na thought. I don't suppose I should have done so had I not known this\nlegend.\"\n\n\"There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?\"\n\n\"No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.\"\n\n\"You say it was large?\"\n\n\"Enormous.\"\n\n\"But it had not approached the body?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What sort of night was it?'\n\n\"Damp and raw.\"\n\n\"But not actually raining?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What is the alley like?\"\n\n\"There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and\nimpenetrable. The walk in the centre is about eight feet across.\"\n\n\"Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?\"\n\n\"Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side.\"\n\n\"I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate?\"\n\n\"Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.\"\n\n\"Is there any other opening?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"So that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the\nhouse or else to enter it by the moor-gate?\"\n\n\"There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end.\"\n\n\"Had Sir Charles reached this?\"\n\n\"No; he lay about fifty yards from it.\"\n\n\"Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer--and this is important--the marks which you\nsaw were on the path and not on the grass?\"\n\n\"No marks could show on the grass.\"\n\n\"Were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?\"\n\n\"Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the\nmoor-gate.\"\n\n\"You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate\nclosed?\"\n\n\"Closed and padlocked.\"\n\n\"How high was it?\"\n\n\"About four feet high.\"\n\n\"Then anyone could have got over it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?\"\n\n\"None in particular.\"\n\n\"Good heaven! Did no one examine?\"\n\n\"Yes, I examined, myself.\"\n\n\"And found nothing?\"\n\n\"It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there for\nfive or ten minutes.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.\"\n\n\"Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But the\nmarks?\"\n\n\"He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I could\ndiscern no others.\"\n\nSherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient\ngesture.\n\n\"If I had only been there!\" he cried. \"It is evidently a case of\nextraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities to\nthe scientific expert. That gravel page upon which I might have read so\nmuch has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs\nof curious peasants. Oh, Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you\nshould not have called me in! You have indeed much to answer for.\"\n\n\"I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these facts to\nthe world, and I have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so.\nBesides, besides--\"\n\n\"Why do you hesitate?\"\n\n\"There is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of\ndetectives is helpless.\"\n\n\"You mean that the thing is supernatural?\"\n\n\"I did not positively say so.\"\n\n\"No, but you evidently think it.\"\n\n\"Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears several\nincidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature.\"\n\n\"For example?\"\n\n\"I find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen\na creature upon the moor which corresponds with this Baskerville demon,\nand which could not possibly be any animal known to science. They all\nagreed that it was a huge creature, luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I\nhave cross-examined these men, one of them a hard-headed countryman,\none a farrier, and one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of\nthis dreadful apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the\nlegend. I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district,\nand that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night.\"\n\n\"And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?\"\n\n\"I do not know what to believe.\"\n\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders. \"I have hitherto confined my\ninvestigations to this world,\" said he. \"In a modest way I have combated\nevil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself would, perhaps, be too\nambitious a task. Yet you must admit that the footmark is material.\"\n\n\"The original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out, and\nyet he was diabolical as well.\"\n\n\"I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But now,\nDr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have you come\nto consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath that it is useless\nto investigate Sir Charles's death, and that you desire me to do it.\"\n\n\"I did not say that I desired you to do it.\"\n\n\"Then, how can I assist you?\"\n\n\"By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville, who\narrives at Waterloo Station\"--Dr. Mortimer looked at his watch--\"in\nexactly one hour and a quarter.\"\n\n\"He being the heir?\"\n\n\"Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young gentleman\nand found that he had been farming in Canada. From the accounts which\nhave reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way. I speak now not\nas a medical man but as a trustee and executor of Sir Charles's will.\"\n\n\"There is no other claimant, I presume?\"\n\n\"None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was Rodger\nBaskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir Charles was\nthe elder. The second brother, who died young, is the father of this lad\nHenry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of the family. He came of\nthe old masterful Baskerville strain and was the very image, they tell\nme, of the family picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold\nhim, fled to Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever.\nHenry is the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes\nI meet him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived at\nSouthampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise me to\ndo with him?\"\n\n\"Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?\"\n\n\"It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every Baskerville\nwho goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure that if Sir Charles\ncould have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me\nagainst bringing this, the last of the old race, and the heir to great\nwealth, to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be denied that the\nprosperity of the whole poor, bleak countryside depends upon his\npresence. All the good work which has been done by Sir Charles will\ncrash to the ground if there is no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I\nshould be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter, and\nthat is why I bring the case before you and ask for your advice.\"\n\nHolmes considered for a little time.\n\n\"Put into plain words, the matter is this,\" said he. \"In your opinion\nthere is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for a\nBaskerville--that is your opinion?\"\n\n\"At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence\nthat this may be so.\"\n\n\"Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it could\nwork the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A devil\nwith merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable\na thing.\"\n\n\"You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would probably\ndo if you were brought into personal contact with these things. Your\nadvice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man will be as safe\nin Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty minutes. What would you\nrecommend?\"\n\n\"I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is\nscratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir Henry\nBaskerville.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my\nmind about the matter.\"\n\n\"How long will it take you to make up your mind?\"\n\n\"Twenty-four hours. At ten o'clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be\nmuch obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be\nof help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry\nBaskerville with you.\"\n\n\"I will do so, Mr. Holmes.\" He scribbled the appointment on his\nshirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded\nfashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.\n\n\"Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir Charles\nBaskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon the moor?\"\n\n\"Three people did.\"\n\n\"Did any see it after?\"\n\n\"I have not heard of any.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Good-morning.\"\n\nHolmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction\nwhich meant that he had a congenial task before him.\n\n\"Going out, Watson?\"\n\n\"Unless I can help you.\"\n\n\"No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you for\naid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of view.\nWhen you pass Bradley's, would you ask him to send up a pound of the\nstrongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you could make\nit convenient not to return before evening. Then I should be very glad\nto compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has\nbeen submitted to us this morning.\"\n\nI knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend\nin those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed\nevery particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced\none against the other, and made up his mind as to which points were\nessential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day at my club and\ndid not return to Baker Street until evening. It was nearly nine o'clock\nwhen I found myself in the sitting-room once more.\n\nMy first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out,\nfor the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon\nthe table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears were set at\nrest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me\nby the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision\nof Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black\nclay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him.\n\n\"Caught cold, Watson?\" said he.\n\n\"No, it's this poisonous atmosphere.\"\n\n\"I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it.\"\n\n\"Thick! It is intolerable.\"\n\n\"Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I perceive.\"\n\n\"My dear Holmes!\"\n\n\"Am I right?\"\n\n\"Certainly, but how?\"\n\nHe laughed at my bewildered expression. \"There is a delightful freshness\nabout you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small\npowers which I possess at your expense. A gentleman goes forth on a\nshowery and miry day. He returns immaculate in the evening with the\ngloss still on his hat and his boots. He has been a fixture therefore\nall day. He is not a man with intimate friends. Where, then, could he\nhave been? Is it not obvious?\"\n\n\"Well, it is rather obvious.\"\n\n\"The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever\nobserves. Where do you think that I have been?\"\n\n\"A fixture also.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire.\"\n\n\"In spirit?\"\n\n\"Exactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret\nto observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an\nincredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to Stamford's\nfor the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my spirit has\nhovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could find my way\nabout.\"\n\n\"A large-scale map, I presume?\"\n\n\"Very large.\"\n\nHe unrolled one section and held it over his knee. \"Here you have the\nparticular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville Hall in the\nmiddle.\"\n\n\"With a wood round it?\"\n\n\"Exactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that name, must\nstretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon the right\nof it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of Grimpen,\nwhere our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a radius of\nfive miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered dwellings.\nHere is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative. There is\na house indicated here which may be the residence of the\nnaturalist--Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are two\nmoorland farmhouses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the\ngreat convict prison of Princetown. Between and around these scattered\npoints extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage\nupon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to play\nit again.\"\n\n\"It must be a wild place.\"\n\n\"Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a\nhand in the affairs of men--\"\n\n\"Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation.\"\n\n\"The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There are\ntwo questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is whether any crime\nhas been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime and how was\nit committed? Of course, if Dr. Mortimer's surmise should be correct,\nand we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature,\nthere is an end of our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all\nother hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think we'll shut\nthat window again, if you don't mind. It is a singular thing, but I find\nthat a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought. I have\nnot pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think, but that is\nthe logical outcome of my convictions. Have you turned the case over in\nyour mind?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.\"\n\n\"What do you make of it?\"\n\n\"It is very bewildering.\"\n\n\"It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of\ndistinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example. What\ndo you make of that?\"\n\n\"Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of\nthe alley.\"\n\n\"He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should a\nman walk on tiptoe down the alley?\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"He was running, Watson--running desperately, running for his life,\nrunning until he burst his heart--and fell dead upon his face.\"\n\n\"Running from what?\"\n\n\"There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was crazed\nwith fear before ever he began to run.\"\n\n\"How can you say that?\"\n\n\"I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor.\nIf that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had lost his\nwits would have run from the house instead of towards it. If the\ngipsy's evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help in the\ndirection where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom was he\nwaiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley\nrather than in his own house?\"\n\n\"You think that he was waiting for someone?\"\n\n\"The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an evening\nstroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. Is it natural\nthat he should stand for five or ten minutes, as Dr. Mortimer, with more\npractical sense than I should have given him credit for, deduced from\nthe cigar ash?\"\n\n\"But he went out every evening.\"\n\n\"I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening. On\nthe contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. That night he\nwaited there. It was the night before he made his departure for London.\nThe thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I ask you to\nhand me my violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this\nbusiness until we have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir\nHenry Baskerville in the morning.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4. Sir Henry Baskerville\n\n\n\nOur breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his\ndressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual to\ntheir appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr. Mortimer\nwas shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was a small,\nalert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very sturdily built,\nwith thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face. He wore a\nruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one who\nhas spent most of his time in the open air, and yet there was something\nin his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated\nthe gentleman.\n\n\"This is Sir Henry Baskerville,\" said Dr. Mortimer.\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said he, \"and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\nthat if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning\nI should have come on my own account. I understand that you think out\nlittle puzzles, and I've had one this morning which wants more thinking\nout than I am able to give it.\"\n\n\"Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you have\nyourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in London?\"\n\n\"Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not.\nIt was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me this\nmorning.\"\n\nHe laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was of\ncommon quality, grayish in colour. The address, \"Sir Henry Baskerville,\nNorthumberland Hotel,\" was printed in rough characters; the post-mark\n\"Charing Cross,\" and the date of posting the preceding evening.\n\n\"Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?\" asked\nHolmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.\n\n\"No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer.\"\n\n\"But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?\"\n\n\"No, I had been staying with a friend,\" said the doctor.\n\n\"There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel.\"\n\n\"Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements.\" Out\nof the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into four.\nThis he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the middle of it\na single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed\nwords upon it. It ran:\n\n        As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.\n\nThe word \"moor\" only was printed in ink.\n\n\"Now,\" said Sir Henry Baskerville, \"perhaps you will tell me, Mr.\nHolmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that takes\nso much interest in my affairs?\"\n\n\"What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is\nnothing supernatural about this, at any rate?\"\n\n\"No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced\nthat the business is supernatural.\"\n\n\"What business?\" asked Sir Henry sharply. \"It seems to me that all you\ngentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs.\"\n\n\"You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry. I\npromise you that,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"We will confine ourselves\nfor the present with your permission to this very interesting document,\nwhich must have been put together and posted yesterday evening. Have you\nyesterday's Times, Watson?\"\n\n\"It is here in the corner.\"\n\n\"Might I trouble you for it--the inside page, please, with the leading\narticles?\" He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up and down the\ncolumns. \"Capital article this on free trade. Permit me to give you an\nextract from it.\n\n     'You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special\n     trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a\n     protective tariff, but it stands to reason that such\n     legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the\n     country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower the\n     general conditions of life in this island.'\n\n\"What do you think of that, Watson?\" cried Holmes in high glee, rubbing\nhis hands together with satisfaction. \"Don't you think that is an\nadmirable sentiment?\"\n\nDr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest, and\nSir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.\n\n\"I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind,\" said he,\n\"but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as that note is\nconcerned.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir\nHenry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I fear\nthat even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence.\"\n\n\"No, I confess that I see no connection.\"\n\n\"And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection that\nthe one is extracted out of the other. 'You,' 'your,' 'your,' 'life,'\n'reason,' 'value,' 'keep away,' 'from the.' Don't you see now whence\nthese words have been taken?\"\n\n\"By thunder, you're right! Well, if that isn't smart!\" cried Sir Henry.\n\n\"If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that 'keep\naway' and 'from the' are cut out in one piece.\"\n\n\"Well, now--so it is!\"\n\n\"Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have imagined,\"\nsaid Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement. \"I could understand\nanyone saying that the words were from a newspaper; but that you should\nname which, and add that it came from the leading article, is really one\nof the most remarkable things which I have ever known. How did you do\nit?\"\n\n\"I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from that\nof an Esquimau?\"\n\n\"Most certainly.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious. The\nsupra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve, the--\"\n\n\"But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally obvious.\nThere is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type\nof a Times article and the slovenly print of an evening half-penny paper\nas there could be between your negro and your Esquimau. The detection of\ntypes is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special\nexpert in crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I\nconfused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News. But a Times\nleader is entirely distinctive, and these words could have been taken\nfrom nothing else. As it was done yesterday the strong probability was\nthat we should find the words in yesterday's issue.\"\n\n\"So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,\" said Sir Henry\nBaskerville, \"someone cut out this message with a scissors--\"\n\n\"Nail-scissors,\" said Holmes. \"You can see that it was a very\nshort-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over 'keep\naway.'\"\n\n\"That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of\nshort-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste--\"\n\n\"Gum,\" said Holmes.\n\n\"With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word 'moor' should\nhave been written?\"\n\n\"Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all simple\nand might be found in any issue, but 'moor' would be less common.\"\n\n\"Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else in\nthis message, Mr. Holmes?\"\n\n\"There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been\ntaken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in rough\ncharacters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands\nbut those of the highly educated. We may take it, therefore, that\nthe letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an\nuneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that\nthat writing might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you\nwill observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but\nthat some are much higher than others. 'Life,' for example is quite out\nof its proper place. That may point to carelessness or it may point to\nagitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter. On the whole I incline\nto the latter view, since the matter was evidently important, and it\nis unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless. If he\nwere in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be\nin a hurry, since any letter posted up to early morning would reach\nSir Henry before he would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an\ninterruption--and from whom?\"\n\n\"We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,\" said Dr.\nMortimer.\n\n\"Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and choose\nthe most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination, but we\nhave always some material basis on which to start our speculation. Now,\nyou would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am almost certain that this\naddress has been written in a hotel.\"\n\n\"How in the world can you say that?\"\n\n\"If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink\nhave given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered twice in a single\nword and has run dry three times in a short address, showing that there\nwas very little ink in the bottle. Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is\nseldom allowed to be in such a state, and the combination of the two\nmust be quite rare. But you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where\nit is rare to get anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation\nin saying that could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels\naround Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated Times\nleader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this\nsingular message. Halloa! Halloa! What's this?\"\n\nHe was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words were\npasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said he, throwing it down. \"It is a blank half-sheet of\npaper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have drawn as much\nas we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir Henry, has anything\nelse of interest happened to you since you have been in London?\"\n\n\"Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.\"\n\n\"You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?\"\n\n\"I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,\" said our\nvisitor. \"Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me?\"\n\n\"We are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us before we\ngo into this matter?\"\n\n\"Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.\"\n\n\"I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth\nreporting.\"\n\nSir Henry smiled. \"I don't know much of British life yet, for I have\nspent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada. But I hope that to\nlose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over\nhere.\"\n\n\"You have lost one of your boots?\"\n\n\"My dear sir,\" cried Dr. Mortimer, \"it is only mislaid. You will find\nit when you return to the hotel. What is the use of troubling Mr. Holmes\nwith trifles of this kind?\"\n\n\"Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Holmes, \"however foolish the incident may seem. You have\nlost one of your boots, you say?\"\n\n\"Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last night,\nand there was only one in the morning. I could get no sense out of the\nchap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I only bought the pair\nlast night in the Strand, and I have never had them on.\"\n\n\"If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be cleaned?\"\n\n\"They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I put\nthem out.\"\n\n\"Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you went out\nat once and bought a pair of boots?\"\n\n\"I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with me.\nYou see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part, and\nit may be that I have got a little careless in my ways out West. Among\nother things I bought these brown boots--gave six dollars for them--and\nhad one stolen before ever I had them on my feet.\"\n\n\"It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,\" said Sherlock Holmes.\n\"I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer's belief that it will not be long\nbefore the missing boot is found.\"\n\n\"And, now, gentlemen,\" said the baronet with decision, \"it seems to me\nthat I have spoken quite enough about the little that I know. It is time\nthat you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all\ndriving at.\"\n\n\"Your request is a very reasonable one,\" Holmes answered. \"Dr. Mortimer,\nI think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it\nto us.\"\n\nThus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket\nand presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before.\nSir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest attention and with an\noccasional exclamation of surprise.\n\n\"Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,\" said\nhe when the long narrative was finished. \"Of course, I've heard of the\nhound ever since I was in the nursery. It's the pet story of the family,\nthough I never thought of taking it seriously before. But as to my\nuncle's death--well, it all seems boiling up in my head, and I can't\nget it clear yet. You don't seem quite to have made up your mind whether\nit's a case for a policeman or a clergyman.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"And now there's this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I suppose\nthat fits into its place.\"\n\n\"It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on\nupon the moor,\" said Dr. Mortimer.\n\n\"And also,\" said Holmes, \"that someone is not ill-disposed towards you,\nsince they warn you of danger.\"\n\n\"Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me away.\"\n\n\"Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted to you,\nDr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which presents several\ninteresting alternatives. But the practical point which we now have to\ndecide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to\nBaskerville Hall.\"\n\n\"Why should I not go?\"\n\n\"There seems to be danger.\"\n\n\"Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from\nhuman beings?\"\n\n\"Well, that is what we have to find out.\"\n\n\"Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell, Mr.\nHolmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to\nthe home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final answer.\"\nHis dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke.\nIt was evident that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles was not extinct\nin this their last representative. \"Meanwhile,\" said he, \"I have hardly\nhad time to think over all that you have told me. It's a big thing for a\nman to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should like\nto have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look here, Mr.\nHolmes, it's half-past eleven now and I am going back right away to my\nhotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson, come round and lunch\nwith us at two. I'll be able to tell you more clearly then how this\nthing strikes me.\"\n\n\"Is that convenient to you, Watson?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?\"\n\n\"I'd prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.\"\n\n\"I'll join you in a walk, with pleasure,\" said his companion.\n\n\"Then we meet again at two o'clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!\"\n\nWe heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the\nfront door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to\nthe man of action.\n\n\"Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!\" He rushed\ninto his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a few seconds\nin a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs and into the\nstreet. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still visible about two\nhundred yards ahead of us in the direction of Oxford Street.\n\n\"Shall I run on and stop them?\"\n\n\"Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with your\ncompany if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for it is\ncertainly a very fine morning for a walk.\"\n\nHe quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided\nus by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards behind, we\nfollowed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street. Once our friends\nstopped and stared into a shop window, upon which Holmes did the\nsame. An instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction, and,\nfollowing the direction of his eager eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with\na man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now\nproceeding slowly onward again.\n\n\n\"There's our man, Watson! Come along! We'll have a good look at him, if\nwe can do no more.\"\n\nAt that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of\npiercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.\nInstantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed to\nthe driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street. Holmes looked\neagerly round for another, but no empty one was in sight. Then he dashed\nin wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the start was too\ngreat, and already the cab was out of sight.\n\n\"There now!\" said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with\nvexation from the tide of vehicles. \"Was ever such bad luck and such\nbad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an honest man you will\nrecord this also and set it against my successes!\"\n\n\"Who was the man?\"\n\n\"I have not an idea.\"\n\n\"A spy?\"\n\n\"Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville has been\nvery closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town. How else\ncould it be known so quickly that it was the Northumberland Hotel which\nhe had chosen? If they had followed him the first day I argued that they\nwould follow him also the second. You may have observed that I twice\nstrolled over to the window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember.\"\n\n\"I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none. We\nare dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very deep, and\nthough I have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or\na malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I am conscious always of\npower and design. When our friends left I at once followed them in the\nhopes of marking down their invisible attendant. So wily was he that he\nhad not trusted himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab\nso that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their\nnotice. His method had the additional advantage that if they were to\ntake a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one obvious\ndisadvantage.\"\n\n\"It puts him in the power of the cabman.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"What a pity we did not get the number!\"\n\n\"My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not seriously\nimagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704 is our man. But\nthat is no use to us for the moment.\"\n\n\"I fail to see how you could have done more.\"\n\n\"On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked in the\nother direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a second cab\nand followed the first at a respectful distance, or, better still, have\ndriven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there. When our unknown\nhad followed Baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of\nplaying his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for. As\nit is, by an indiscreet eagerness, which was taken advantage of with\nextraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent, we have betrayed\nourselves and lost our man.\"\n\nWe had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this\nconversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long vanished in\nfront of us.\n\n\"There is no object in our following them,\" said Holmes. \"The shadow has\ndeparted and will not return. We must see what further cards we have\nin our hands and play them with decision. Could you swear to that man's\nface within the cab?\"\n\n\"I could swear only to the beard.\"\n\n\"And so could I--from which I gather that in all probability it was\na false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a\nbeard save to conceal his features. Come in here, Watson!\"\n\nHe turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he was\nwarmly greeted by the manager.\n\n\"Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I had\nthe good fortune to help you?\"\n\n\"No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps my\nlife.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection, Wilson, that\nyou had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who showed some ability\nduring the investigation.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, he is still with us.\"\n\n\"Could you ring him up?--thank you! And I should be glad to have change\nof this five-pound note.\"\n\nA lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the summons\nof the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous\ndetective.\n\n\"Let me have the Hotel Directory,\" said Holmes. \"Thank you! Now,\nCartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all in the\nimmediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You will visit each of these in turn.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling.\nHere are twenty-three shillings.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of yesterday.\nYou will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are\nlooking for it. You understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the Times\nwith some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy of the Times. It\nis this page. You could easily recognize it, could you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter, to whom\nalso you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings. You will\nthen learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty-three that the\nwaste of the day before has been burned or removed. In the three other\ncases you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page\nof the Times among it. The odds are enormously against your finding\nit. There are ten shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a\nreport by wire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only\nremains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman, No. 2704,\nand then we will drop into one of the Bond Street picture galleries and\nfill in the time until we are due at the hotel.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5. Three Broken Threads\n\n\n\nSherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching\nhis mind at will. For two hours the strange business in which we had\nbeen involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was entirely absorbed in\nthe pictures of the modern Belgian masters. He would talk of nothing\nbut art, of which he had the crudest ideas, from our leaving the gallery\nuntil we found ourselves at the Northumberland Hotel.\n\n\"Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,\" said the clerk. \"He\nasked me to show you up at once when you came.\"\n\n\"Have you any objection to my looking at your register?\" said Holmes.\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\nThe book showed that two names had been added after that of Baskerville.\nOne was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle; the other Mrs.\nOldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.\n\n\"Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,\" said Holmes\nto the porter. \"A lawyer, is he not, gray-headed, and walks with a\nlimp?\"\n\n\"No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active gentleman,\nnot older than yourself.\"\n\n\"Surely you are mistaken about his trade?\"\n\n\"No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very well\nknown to us.\"\n\n\"Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the name.\nExcuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend one finds\nanother.\"\n\n\"She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of Gloucester.\nShe always comes to us when she is in town.\"\n\n\"Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have\nestablished a most important fact by these questions, Watson,\" he\ncontinued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. \"We know now that\nthe people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down\nin his own hotel. That means that while they are, as we have seen, very\nanxious to watch him, they are equally anxious that he should not see\nthem. Now, this is a most suggestive fact.\"\n\n\"What does it suggest?\"\n\n\"It suggests--halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the matter?\"\n\nAs we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir Henry\nBaskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and he held an old\nand dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was he that he was hardly\narticulate, and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more\nWestern dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning.\n\n\"Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,\" he cried.\n\"They'll find they've started in to monkey with the wrong man unless\nthey are careful. By thunder, if that chap can't find my missing boot\nthere will be trouble. I can take a joke with the best, Mr. Holmes, but\nthey've got a bit over the mark this time.\"\n\n\"Still looking for your boot?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, and mean to find it.\"\n\n\"But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?\"\n\n\"So it was, sir. And now it's an old black one.\"\n\n\"What! you don't mean to say--?\"\n\n\"That's just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in the\nworld--the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers, which I am\nwearing. Last night they took one of my brown ones, and today they have\nsneaked one of the black. Well, have you got it? Speak out, man, and\ndon't stand staring!\"\n\nAn agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.\n\n\"No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear no word\nof it.\"\n\n\"Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I'll see the\nmanager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.\"\n\n\"It shall be found, sir--I promise you that if you will have a little\npatience it will be found.\"\n\n\"Mind it is, for it's the last thing of mine that I'll lose in this den\nof thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you'll excuse my troubling you about\nsuch a trifle--\"\n\n\"I think it's well worth troubling about.\"\n\n\"Why, you look very serious over it.\"\n\n\"How do you explain it?\"\n\n\"I just don't attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest, queerest\nthing that ever happened to me.\"\n\n\"The queerest perhaps--\" said Holmes thoughtfully.\n\n\"What do you make of it yourself?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't profess to understand it yet. This case of yours is very\ncomplex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with your uncle's death\nI am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of capital importance\nwhich I have handled there is one which cuts so deep. But we hold\nseveral threads in our hands, and the odds are that one or other of them\nguides us to the truth. We may waste time in following the wrong one,\nbut sooner or later we must come upon the right.\"\n\nWe had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business\nwhich had brought us together. It was in the private sitting-room to\nwhich we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked Baskerville what were his\nintentions.\n\n\"To go to Baskerville Hall.\"\n\n\"And when?\"\n\n\"At the end of the week.\"\n\n\"On the whole,\" said Holmes, \"I think that your decision is a wise one.\nI have ample evidence that you are being dogged in London, and amid the\nmillions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people\nare or what their object can be. If their intentions are evil they might\ndo you a mischief, and we should be powerless to prevent it. You did not\nknow, Dr. Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?\"\n\nDr. Mortimer started violently. \"Followed! By whom?\"\n\n\"That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among your\nneighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a black, full\nbeard?\"\n\n\"No--or, let me see--why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles's butler, is a man\nwith a full, black beard.\"\n\n\"Ha! Where is Barrymore?\"\n\n\"He is in charge of the Hall.\"\n\n\"We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any possibility\nhe might be in London.\"\n\n\"How can you do that?\"\n\n\"Give me a telegraph form. 'Is all ready for Sir Henry?' That will\ndo. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the nearest\ntelegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a second wire to the\npostmaster, Grimpen: 'Telegram to Mr. Barrymore to be delivered into\nhis own hand. If absent, please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville,\nNorthumberland Hotel.' That should let us know before evening whether\nBarrymore is at his post in Devonshire or not.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said Baskerville. \"By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is this\nBarrymore, anyhow?\"\n\n\"He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have looked after\nthe Hall for four generations now. So far as I know, he and his wife are\nas respectable a couple as any in the county.\"\n\n\"At the same time,\" said Baskerville, \"it's clear enough that so long as\nthere are none of the family at the Hall these people have a mighty fine\nhome and nothing to do.\"\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles's will?\" asked Holmes.\n\n\"He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.\"\n\n\"Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?\"\n\n\"Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions of his\nwill.\"\n\n\"That is very interesting.\"\n\n\"I hope,\" said Dr. Mortimer, \"that you do not look with suspicious eyes\nupon everyone who received a legacy from Sir Charles, for I also had a\nthousand pounds left to me.\"\n\n\"Indeed! And anyone else?\"\n\n\"There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large number\nof public charities. The residue all went to Sir Henry.\"\n\n\"And how much was the residue?\"\n\n\"Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.\"\n\nHolmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. \"I had no idea that so gigantic\na sum was involved,\" said he.\n\n\"Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not know how\nvery rich he was until we came to examine his securities. The total\nvalue of the estate was close on to a million.\"\n\n\"Dear me! It is a stake for which a man might well play a desperate\ngame. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing that anything\nhappened to our young friend here--you will forgive the unpleasant\nhypothesis!--who would inherit the estate?\"\n\n\"Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles's younger brother died unmarried,\nthe estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are distant cousins. James\nDesmond is an elderly clergyman in Westmoreland.\"\n\n\"Thank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you met Mr.\nJames Desmond?\"\n\n\"Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of venerable\nappearance and of saintly life. I remember that he refused to accept any\nsettlement from Sir Charles, though he pressed it upon him.\"\n\n\"And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles's\nthousands.\"\n\n\"He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. He would\nalso be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the\npresent owner, who can, of course, do what he likes with it.\"\n\n\"And have you made your will, Sir Henry?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I've had no time, for it was only yesterday\nthat I learned how matters stood. But in any case I feel that the money\nshould go with the title and estate. That was my poor uncle's idea. How\nis the owner going to restore the glories of the Baskervilles if he has\nnot money enough to keep up the property? House, land, and dollars must\ngo together.\"\n\n\"Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the\nadvisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay. There is\nonly one provision which I must make. You certainly must not go alone.\"\n\n\"Dr. Mortimer returns with me.\"\n\n\"But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house is miles\naway from yours. With all the goodwill in the world he may be unable to\nhelp you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with you someone, a trusty man,\nwho will be always by your side.\"\n\n\"Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?\"\n\n\"If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in person;\nbut you can understand that, with my extensive consulting practice\nand with the constant appeals which reach me from many quarters, it is\nimpossible for me to be absent from London for an indefinite time. At\nthe present instant one of the most revered names in England is being\nbesmirched by a blackmailer, and only I can stop a disastrous scandal.\nYou will see how impossible it is for me to go to Dartmoor.\"\n\n\"Whom would you recommend, then?\"\n\nHolmes laid his hand upon my arm. \"If my friend would undertake it there\nis no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a\ntight place. No one can say so more confidently than I.\"\n\nThe proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had time to\nanswer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily.\n\n\"Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson,\" said he. \"You see how\nit is with me, and you know just as much about the matter as I do. If\nyou will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me through I'll never\nforget it.\"\n\nThe promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I was\ncomplimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with which the\nbaronet hailed me as a companion.\n\n\"I will come, with pleasure,\" said I. \"I do not know how I could employ\nmy time better.\"\n\n\"And you will report very carefully to me,\" said Holmes. \"When a crisis\ncomes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I suppose that by\nSaturday all might be ready?\"\n\n\"Would that suit Dr. Watson?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet at the\nten-thirty train from Paddington.\"\n\nWe had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry, of triumph, and\ndiving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from\nunder a cabinet.\n\n\"My missing boot!\" he cried.\n\n\"May all our difficulties vanish as easily!\" said Sherlock Holmes.\n\n\"But it is a very singular thing,\" Dr. Mortimer remarked. \"I searched\nthis room carefully before lunch.\"\n\n\"And so did I,\" said Baskerville. \"Every inch of it.\"\n\n\"There was certainly no boot in it then.\"\n\n\"In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were\nlunching.\"\n\nThe German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter,\nnor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been added to that\nconstant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had\nsucceeded each other so rapidly. Setting aside the whole grim story of\nSir Charles's death, we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within\nthe limits of two days, which included the receipt of the printed\nletter, the black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown\nboot, the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new\nbrown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to Baker\nStreet, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that his mind,\nlike my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into which\nall these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted.\nAll afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and\nthought.\n\nJust before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran:\n\nHave just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE.\n\nThe second:\n\nVisited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry, to report unable to\ntrace cut sheet of Times. CARTWRIGHT.\n\n\"There go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more stimulating\nthan a case where everything goes against you. We must cast round for\nanother scent.\"\n\n\"We have still the cabman who drove the spy.\"\n\n\"Exactly. I have wired to get his name and address from the Official\nRegistry. I should not be surprised if this were an answer to my\nquestion.\"\n\nThe ring at the bell proved to be something even more satisfactory\nthan an answer, however, for the door opened and a rough-looking fellow\nentered who was evidently the man himself.\n\n\"I got a message from the head office that a gent at this address had\nbeen inquiring for No. 2704,\" said he. \"I've driven my cab this seven\nyears and never a word of complaint. I came here straight from the Yard\nto ask you to your face what you had against me.\"\n\n\"I have nothing in the world against you, my good man,\" said Holmes.\n\"On the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a\nclear answer to my questions.\"\n\n\"Well, I've had a good day and no mistake,\" said the cabman with a grin.\n\"What was it you wanted to ask, sir?\"\n\n\"First of all your name and address, in case I want you again.\"\n\n\"John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out of Shipley's\nYard, near Waterloo Station.\"\n\nSherlock Holmes made a note of it.\n\n\"Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched this\nhouse at ten o'clock this morning and afterwards followed the two\ngentlemen down Regent Street.\"\n\nThe man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. \"Why, there's no good\nmy telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I do already,\"\nsaid he. \"The truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a\ndetective and that I was to say nothing about him to anyone.\"\n\n\"My good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you may find\nyourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me.\nYou say that your fare told you that he was a detective?\"\n\n\"Yes, he did.\"\n\n\"When did he say this?\"\n\n\"When he left me.\"\n\n\"Did he say anything more?\"\n\n\"He mentioned his name.\"\n\nHolmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. \"Oh, he mentioned his name,\ndid he? That was imprudent. What was the name that he mentioned?\"\n\n\"His name,\" said the cabman, \"was Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\"\n\nNever have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the\ncabman's reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement. Then he burst\ninto a hearty laugh.\n\n\"A touch, Watson--an undeniable touch!\" said he. \"I feel a foil as quick\nand supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettily that time. So\nhis name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, that was the gentleman's name.\"\n\n\"Excellent! Tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred.\"\n\n\"He hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. He said that he was\na detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do exactly what he\nwanted all day and ask no questions. I was glad enough to agree. First\nwe drove down to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there until two\ngentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank. We followed their cab\nuntil it pulled up somewhere near here.\"\n\n\"This very door,\" said Holmes.\n\n\"Well, I couldn't be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew all about\nit. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half.\nThen the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and we followed down Baker\nStreet and along--\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Holmes.\n\n\"Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my gentleman threw\nup the trap, and he cried that I should drive right away to Waterloo\nStation as hard as I could go. I whipped up the mare and we were there\nunder the ten minutes. Then he paid up his two guineas, like a good one,\nand away he went into the station. Only just as he was leaving he turned\nround and he said: 'It might interest you to know that you have been\ndriving Mr. Sherlock Holmes.' That's how I come to know the name.\"\n\n\"I see. And you saw no more of him?\"\n\n\"Not after he went into the station.\"\n\n\"And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\"\n\nThe cabman scratched his head. \"Well, he wasn't altogether such an easy\ngentleman to describe. I'd put him at forty years of age, and he was\nof a middle height, two or three inches shorter than you, sir. He was\ndressed like a toff, and he had a black beard, cut square at the end,\nand a pale face. I don't know as I could say more than that.\"\n\n\"Colour of his eyes?\"\n\n\"No, I can't say that.\"\n\n\"Nothing more that you can remember?\"\n\n\"No, sir; nothing.\"\n\n\"Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There's another one waiting\nfor you if you can bring any more information. Good-night!\"\n\n\"Good-night, sir, and thank you!\"\n\nJohn Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a shrug of\nhis shoulders and a rueful smile.\n\n\"Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,\" said he. \"The\ncunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had\nconsulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street, conjectured that I had\ngot the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver, and so\nsent back this audacious message. I tell you, Watson, this time we have\ngot a foeman who is worthy of our steel. I've been checkmated in London.\nI can only wish you better luck in Devonshire. But I'm not easy in my\nmind about it.\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"About sending you. It's an ugly business, Watson, an ugly dangerous\nbusiness, and the more I see of it the less I like it. Yes, my dear\nfellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very glad\nto have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6. Baskerville Hall\n\n\n\nSir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the appointed\nday, and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr. Sherlock Holmes\ndrove with me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions\nand advice.\n\n\"I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions,\nWatson,\" said he; \"I wish you simply to report facts in the fullest\npossible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the theorizing.\"\n\n\"What sort of facts?\" I asked.\n\n\"Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the\ncase, and especially the relations between young Baskerville and his\nneighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death of Sir Charles.\nI have made some inquiries myself in the last few days, but the results\nhave, I fear, been negative. One thing only appears to be certain, and\nthat is that Mr. James Desmond, who is the next heir, is an elderly\ngentleman of a very amiable disposition, so that this persecution does\nnot arise from him. I really think that we may eliminate him entirely\nfrom our calculations. There remain the people who will actually\nsurround Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.\"\n\n\"Would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this Barrymore\ncouple?\"\n\n\"By no means. You could not make a greater mistake. If they are innocent\nit would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we should be\ngiving up all chance of bringing it home to them. No, no, we will\npreserve them upon our list of suspects. Then there is a groom at the\nHall, if I remember right. There are two moorland farmers. There is our\nfriend Dr. Mortimer, whom I believe to be entirely honest, and there is\nhis wife, of whom we know nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton,\nand there is his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions.\nThere is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor,\nand there are one or two other neighbours. These are the folk who must\nbe your very special study.\"\n\n\"I will do my best.\"\n\n\"You have arms, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, I thought it as well to take them.\"\n\n\"Most certainly. Keep your revolver near you night and day, and never\nrelax your precautions.\"\n\nOur friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were waiting\nfor us upon the platform.\n\n\"No, we have no news of any kind,\" said Dr. Mortimer in answer to my\nfriend's questions. \"I can swear to one thing, and that is that we\nhave not been shadowed during the last two days. We have never gone\nout without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could have escaped our\nnotice.\"\n\n\"You have always kept together, I presume?\"\n\n\"Except yesterday afternoon. I usually give up one day to pure amusement\nwhen I come to town, so I spent it at the Museum of the College of\nSurgeons.\"\n\n\"And I went to look at the folk in the park,\" said Baskerville.\n\n\"But we had no trouble of any kind.\"\n\n\"It was imprudent, all the same,\" said Holmes, shaking his head and\nlooking very grave. \"I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go about alone.\nSome great misfortune will befall you if you do. Did you get your other\nboot?\"\n\n\"No, sir, it is gone forever.\"\n\n\"Indeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-bye,\" he added as the\ntrain began to glide down the platform. \"Bear in mind, Sir Henry, one of\nthe phrases in that queer old legend which Dr. Mortimer has read to us,\nand avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil\nare exalted.\"\n\nI looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and saw the\ntall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and gazing after us.\n\nThe journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it in making the\nmore intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in playing with\nDr. Mortimer's spaniel. In a very few hours the brown earth had\nbecome ruddy, the brick had changed to granite, and red cows grazed in\nwell-hedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation\nspoke of a richer, if a damper, climate. Young Baskerville stared\neagerly out of the window and cried aloud with delight as he recognized\nthe familiar features of the Devon scenery.\n\n\"I've been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr. Watson,\"\nsaid he; \"but I have never seen a place to compare with it.\"\n\n\"I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his county,\" I\nremarked.\n\n\"It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county,\" said\nDr. Mortimer. \"A glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of\nthe Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic enthusiasm and power\nof attachment. Poor Sir Charles's head was of a very rare type, half\nGaelic, half Ivernian in its characteristics. But you were very young\nwhen you last saw Baskerville Hall, were you not?\"\n\n\"I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father's death and had never\nseen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the South Coast.\nThence I went straight to a friend in America. I tell you it is all as\nnew to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I'm as keen as possible to see the\nmoor.\"\n\n\"Are you? Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your first\nsight of the moor,\" said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the carriage\nwindow.\n\nOver the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there\nrose in the distance a gray, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged\nsummit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in\na dream. Baskerville sat for a long time, his eyes fixed upon it, and I\nread upon his eager face how much it meant to him, this first sight of\nthat strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long\nand left their mark so deep. There he sat, with his tweed suit and his\nAmerican accent, in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as\nI looked at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how\ntrue a descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery,\nand masterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in his thick\nbrows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. If on that\nforbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us,\nthis was at least a comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk\nwith the certainty that he would bravely share it.\n\nThe train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all descended.\nOutside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with a pair of cobs\nwas waiting. Our coming was evidently a great event, for station-master\nand porters clustered round us to carry out our luggage. It was a sweet,\nsimple country spot, but I was surprised to observe that by the gate\nthere stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their\nshort rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a\nhard-faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in\na few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road. Rolling\npasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old gabled houses\npeeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful\nand sunlit countryside there rose ever, dark against the evening sky,\nthe long, gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister\nhills.\n\nThe wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward through\ndeep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on either side, heavy\nwith dripping moss and fleshy hart's-tongue ferns. Bronzing bracken and\nmottled bramble gleamed in the light of the sinking sun. Still steadily\nrising, we passed over a narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy\nstream which gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the gray\nboulders. Both road and stream wound up through a valley dense with\nscrub oak and fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of\ndelight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless questions. To\nhis eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon\nthe countryside, which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year.\nYellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we\npassed. The rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of\nrotting vegetation--sad gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw\nbefore the carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.\n\n\"Halloa!\" cried Dr. Mortimer, \"what is this?\"\n\nA steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor, lay in\nfront of us. On the summit, hard and clear like an equestrian statue\nupon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark and stern, his rifle\npoised ready over his forearm. He was watching the road along which we\ntravelled.\n\n\"What is this, Perkins?\" asked Dr. Mortimer.\n\nOur driver half turned in his seat. \"There's a convict escaped from\nPrincetown, sir. He's been out three days now, and the warders watch\nevery road and every station, but they've had no sight of him yet. The\nfarmers about here don't like it, sir, and that's a fact.\"\n\n\"Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give\ninformation.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared\nto the chance of having your throat cut. You see, it isn't like any\nordinary convict. This is a man that would stick at nothing.\"\n\n\"Who is he, then?\"\n\n\"It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.\"\n\nI remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes had taken an\ninterest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the\nwanton brutality which had marked all the actions of the assassin. The\ncommutation of his death sentence had been due to some doubts as to his\ncomplete sanity, so atrocious was his conduct. Our wagonette had topped\na rise and in front of us rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled\nwith gnarled and craggy cairns and tors. A cold wind swept down from\nit and set us shivering. Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was\nlurking this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his\nheart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out.\nIt needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren\nwaste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky. Even Baskerville fell\nsilent and pulled his overcoat more closely around him.\n\nWe had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. We looked back on\nit now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams to threads of\ngold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad\ntangle of the woodlands. The road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder\nover huge russet and olive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders. Now\nand then we passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone,\nwith no creeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into\na cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which had been\ntwisted and bent by the fury of years of storm. Two high, narrow towers\nrose over the trees. The driver pointed with his whip.\n\n\"Baskerville Hall,\" said he.\n\nIts master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and shining\neyes. A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-gates, a maze of\nfantastic tracery in wrought iron, with weather-bitten pillars on either\nside, blotched with lichens, and surmounted by the boars' heads of the\nBaskervilles. The lodge was a ruin of black granite and bared ribs of\nrafters, but facing it was a new building, half constructed, the first\nfruit of Sir Charles's South African gold.\n\nThrough the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels were\nagain hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their branches in a\nsombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville shuddered as he looked up\nthe long, dark drive to where the house glimmered like a ghost at the\nfarther end.\n\n\"Was it here?\" he asked in a low voice.\n\n\"No, no, the yew alley is on the other side.\"\n\nThe young heir glanced round with a gloomy face.\n\n\"It's no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in such a\nplace as this,\" said he. \"It's enough to scare any man. I'll have a row\nof electric lamps up here inside of six months, and you won't know it\nagain, with a thousand candle-power Swan and Edison right here in front\nof the hall door.\"\n\nThe avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay before\nus. In the fading light I could see that the centre was a heavy block\nof building from which a porch projected. The whole front was draped in\nivy, with a patch clipped bare here and there where a window or a coat\nof arms broke through the dark veil. From this central block rose the\ntwin towers, ancient, crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes. To\nright and left of the turrets were more modern wings of black granite.\nA dull light shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high\nchimneys which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a\nsingle black column of smoke.\n\n\"Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville Hall!\"\n\nA tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the door of\nthe wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow\nlight of the hall. She came out and helped the man to hand down our\nbags.\n\n\"You don't mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?\" said Dr. Mortimer.\n\"My wife is expecting me.\"\n\n\"Surely you will stay and have some dinner?\"\n\n\"No, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. I would\nstay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a better guide\nthan I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to send for me if I\ncan be of service.\"\n\nThe wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned\ninto the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was a fine\napartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and heavily\nraftered with huge baulks of age-blackened oak. In the great\nold-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a log-fire crackled\nand snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our hands to it, for we were numb\nfrom our long drive. Then we gazed round us at the high, thin window\nof old stained glass, the oak panelling, the stags' heads, the coats\nof arms upon the walls, all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the\ncentral lamp.\n\n\"It's just as I imagined it,\" said Sir Henry. \"Is it not the very\npicture of an old family home? To think that this should be the same\nhall in which for five hundred years my people have lived. It strikes me\nsolemn to think of it.\"\n\nI saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about\nhim. The light beat upon him where he stood, but long shadows trailed\ndown the walls and hung like a black canopy above him. Barrymore had\nreturned from taking our luggage to our rooms. He stood in front of\nus now with the subdued manner of a well-trained servant. He was a\nremarkable-looking man, tall, handsome, with a square black beard and\npale, distinguished features.\n\n\"Would you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?\"\n\n\"Is it ready?\"\n\n\"In a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in your rooms. My\nwife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you until you have\nmade your fresh arrangements, but you will understand that under the new\nconditions this house will require a considerable staff.\"\n\n\"What new conditions?\"\n\n\"I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and we\nwere able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish to have\nmore company, and so you will need changes in your household.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?\"\n\n\"Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir.\"\n\n\"But your family have been with us for several generations, have they\nnot? I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family\nconnection.\"\n\nI seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler's white face.\n\n\"I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But to tell the truth, sir,\nwe were both very much attached to Sir Charles, and his death gave us\na shock and made these surroundings very painful to us. I fear that we\nshall never again be easy in our minds at Baskerville Hall.\"\n\n\"But what do you intend to do?\"\n\n\"I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves\nin some business. Sir Charles's generosity has given us the means to do\nso. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to your rooms.\"\n\nA square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall,\napproached by a double stair. From this central point two long corridors\nextended the whole length of the building, from which all the bedrooms\nopened. My own was in the same wing as Baskerville's and almost next\ndoor to it. These rooms appeared to be much more modern than the\ncentral part of the house, and the bright paper and numerous candles\ndid something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left\nupon my mind.\n\nBut the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place of shadow\nand gloom. It was a long chamber with a step separating the dais where\nthe family sat from the lower portion reserved for their dependents.\nAt one end a minstrel's gallery overlooked it. Black beams shot across\nabove our heads, with a smoke-darkened ceiling beyond them. With rows of\nflaring torches to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of\nan old-time banquet, it might have softened; but now, when two\nblack-clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a\nshaded lamp, one's voice became hushed and one's spirit subdued. A\ndim line of ancestors, in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan\nknight to the buck of the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us by\ntheir silent company. We talked little, and I for one was glad when the\nmeal was over and we were able to retire into the modern billiard-room\nand smoke a cigarette.\n\n\"My word, it isn't a very cheerful place,\" said Sir Henry. \"I suppose\none can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the picture at present.\nI don't wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived all alone\nin such a house as this. However, if it suits you, we will retire early\ntonight, and perhaps things may seem more cheerful in the morning.\"\n\nI drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out from my\nwindow. It opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall\ndoor. Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind. A\nhalf moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds. In its cold light I\nsaw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks, and the long, low curve\nof the melancholy moor. I closed the curtain, feeling that my last\nimpression was in keeping with the rest.\n\nAnd yet it was not quite the last. I found myself weary and yet wakeful,\ntossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for the sleep which would\nnot come. Far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters of the\nhours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house. And then\nsuddenly, in the very dead of the night, there came a sound to my\nears, clear, resonant, and unmistakable. It was the sob of a woman, the\nmuffled, strangling gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow.\nI sat up in bed and listened intently. The noise could not have been\nfar away and was certainly in the house. For half an hour I waited with\nevery nerve on the alert, but there came no other sound save the chiming\nclock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7. The Stapletons of Merripit House\n\n\n\nThe fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from\nour minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of\nus by our first experience of Baskerville Hall. As Sir Henry and I sat\nat breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows,\nthrowing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered\nthem. The dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it\nwas hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck\nsuch a gloom into our souls upon the evening before.\n\n\"I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame!\" said\nthe baronet. \"We were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive,\nso we took a gray view of the place. Now we are fresh and well, so it is\nall cheerful once more.\"\n\n\"And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination,\" I answered.\n\"Did you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman I think, sobbing\nin the night?\"\n\n\"That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I heard\nsomething of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was no more of\nit, so I concluded that it was all a dream.\"\n\n\"I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob of a\nwoman.\"\n\n\"We must ask about this right away.\" He rang the bell and asked\nBarrymore whether he could account for our experience. It seemed to me\nthat the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler still as he\nlistened to his master's question.\n\n\"There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry,\" he answered. \"One is\nthe scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The other is my wife,\nand I can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her.\"\n\nAnd yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that after breakfast I met\nMrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face. She\nwas a large, impassive, heavy-featured woman with a stern set expression\nof mouth. But her telltale eyes were red and glanced at me from between\nswollen lids. It was she, then, who wept in the night, and if she did so\nher husband must know it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery\nin declaring that it was not so. Why had he done this? And why did she\nweep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome, black-bearded\nman there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom. It was he\nwho had been the first to discover the body of Sir Charles, and we had\nonly his word for all the circumstances which led up to the old man's\ndeath. Was it possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had\nseen in the cab in Regent Street? The beard might well have been the\nsame. The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such an\nimpression might easily have been erroneous. How could I settle the\npoint forever? Obviously the first thing to do was to see the Grimpen\npostmaster and find whether the test telegram had really been placed in\nBarrymore's own hands. Be the answer what it might, I should at least\nhave something to report to Sherlock Holmes.\n\nSir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that the\ntime was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant walk of four\nmiles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a small gray\nhamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to be the inn and\nthe house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the rest. The postmaster,\nwho was also the village grocer, had a clear recollection of the\ntelegram.\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" said he, \"I had the telegram delivered to Mr.\nBarrymore exactly as directed.\"\n\n\"Who delivered it?\"\n\n\"My boy here. James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore at the\nHall last week, did you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, father, I delivered it.\"\n\n\"Into his own hands?\" I asked.\n\n\"Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put it\ninto his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore's hands, and she\npromised to deliver it at once.\"\n\n\"Did you see Mr. Barrymore?\"\n\n\"No, sir; I tell you he was in the loft.\"\n\n\"If you didn't see him, how do you know he was in the loft?\"\n\n\"Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is,\" said the\npostmaster testily. \"Didn't he get the telegram? If there is any mistake\nit is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain.\"\n\nIt seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was clear\nthat in spite of Holmes's ruse we had no proof that Barrymore had not\nbeen in London all the time. Suppose that it were so--suppose that the\nsame man had been the last who had seen Sir Charles alive, and the first\nto dog the new heir when he returned to England. What then? Was he the\nagent of others or had he some sinister design of his own? What interest\ncould he have in persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought of the\nstrange warning clipped out of the leading article of the Times. Was\nthat his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon\ncounteracting his schemes? The only conceivable motive was that which\nhad been suggested by Sir Henry, that if the family could be scared away\na comfortable and permanent home would be secured for the Barrymores.\nBut surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate to\naccount for the deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an\ninvisible net round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said that\nno more complex case had come to him in all the long series of his\nsensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the gray,\nlonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his preoccupations\nand able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from\nmy shoulders.\n\nSuddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet\nbehind me and by a voice which called me by name. I turned, expecting to\nsee Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing\nme. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired\nand leanjawed, between thirty and forty years of age, dressed in a gray\nsuit and wearing a straw hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung\nover his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his\nhands.\n\n\"You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson,\" said he as he\ncame panting up to where I stood. \"Here on the moor we are homely folk\nand do not wait for formal introductions. You may possibly have heard\nmy name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I am Stapleton, of Merripit\nHouse.\"\n\n\"Your net and box would have told me as much,\" said I, \"for I knew that\nMr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know me?\"\n\n\"I have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me from\nthe window of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the same way I\nthought that I would overtake you and introduce myself. I trust that Sir\nHenry is none the worse for his journey?\"\n\n\"He is very well, thank you.\"\n\n\"We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir Charles the\nnew baronet might refuse to live here. It is asking much of a wealthy\nman to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind, but I need\nnot tell you that it means a very great deal to the countryside. Sir\nHenry has, I suppose, no superstitious fears in the matter?\"\n\n\"I do not think that it is likely.\"\n\n\"Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the\nfamily?\"\n\n\"I have heard it.\"\n\n\"It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here! Any\nnumber of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature\nupon the moor.\" He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to read in his eyes\nthat he took the matter more seriously. \"The story took a great hold\nupon the imagination of Sir Charles, and I have no doubt that it led to\nhis tragic end.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"His nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have\nhad a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancy that he really\ndid see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley. I\nfeared that some disaster might occur, for I was very fond of the old\nman, and I knew that his heart was weak.\"\n\n\"How did you know that?\"\n\n\"My friend Mortimer told me.\"\n\n\"You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he died of\nfright in consequence?\"\n\n\"Have you any better explanation?\"\n\n\"I have not come to any conclusion.\"\n\n\"Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\"\n\nThe words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the placid\nface and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was\nintended.\n\n\"It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr. Watson,\"\nsaid he. \"The records of your detective have reached us here, and you\ncould not celebrate him without being known yourself. When Mortimer told\nme your name he could not deny your identity. If you are here, then it\nfollows that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is interesting himself in the matter,\nand I am naturally curious to know what view he may take.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that I cannot answer that question.\"\n\n\"May I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?\"\n\n\"He cannot leave town at present. He has other cases which engage his\nattention.\"\n\n\"What a pity! He might throw some light on that which is so dark to us.\nBut as to your own researches, if there is any possible way in which I\ncan be of service to you I trust that you will command me. If I had\nany indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to\ninvestigate the case, I might perhaps even now give you some aid or\nadvice.\"\n\n\"I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend, Sir\nHenry, and that I need no help of any kind.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" said Stapleton. \"You are perfectly right to be wary and\ndiscreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an unjustifiable\nintrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again.\"\n\nWe had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the\nroad and wound away across the moor. A steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay\nupon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry.\nThe face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and\nbrambles growing in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a\ngray plume of smoke.\n\n\"A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit House,\"\nsaid he. \"Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasure of\nintroducing you to my sister.\"\n\nMy first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry's side. But then I\nremembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was\nlittered. It was certain that I could not help with those. And Holmes\nhad expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor. I\naccepted Stapleton's invitation, and we turned together down the path.\n\n\"It is a wonderful place, the moor,\" said he, looking round over the\nundulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged granite\nfoaming up into fantastic surges. \"You never tire of the moor. You\ncannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains. It is so vast, and\nso barren, and so mysterious.\"\n\n\"You know it well, then?\"\n\n\"I have only been here two years. The residents would call me a\nnewcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my tastes led\nme to explore every part of the country round, and I should think that\nthere are few men who know it better than I do.\"\n\n\"Is it hard to know?\"\n\n\"Very hard. You see, for example, this great plain to the north here\nwith the queer hills breaking out of it. Do you observe anything\nremarkable about that?\"\n\n\"It would be a rare place for a gallop.\"\n\n\"You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their\nlives before now. You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly\nover it?\"\n\n\"Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest.\"\n\nStapleton laughed. \"That is the great Grimpen Mire,\" said he. \"A false\nstep yonder means death to man or beast. Only yesterday I saw one of the\nmoor ponies wander into it. He never came out. I saw his head for quite\na long time craning out of the bog-hole, but it sucked him down at last.\nEven in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it, but after these autumn\nrains it is an awful place. And yet I can find my way to the very heart\nof it and return alive. By George, there is another of those miserable\nponies!\"\n\nSomething brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges. Then a\nlong, agonized, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful cry echoed\nover the moor. It turned me cold with horror, but my companion's nerves\nseemed to be stronger than mine.\n\n\"It's gone!\" said he. \"The mire has him. Two in two days, and many more,\nperhaps, for they get in the way of going there in the dry weather and\nnever know the difference until the mire has them in its clutches. It's\na bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.\"\n\n\"And you say you can penetrate it?\"\n\n\"Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can take. I\nhave found them out.\"\n\n\"But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?\"\n\n\"Well, you see the hills beyond? They are really islands cut off on all\nsides by the impassable mire, which has crawled round them in the course\nof years. That is where the rare plants and the butterflies are, if you\nhave the wit to reach them.\"\n\n\"I shall try my luck some day.\"\n\nHe looked at me with a surprised face. \"For God's sake put such an idea\nout of your mind,\" said he. \"Your blood would be upon my head. I assure\nyou that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive.\nIt is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that I am able to do\nit.\"\n\n\"Halloa!\" I cried. \"What is that?\"\n\nA long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. It filled the\nwhole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it came. From a\ndull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then sank back into a\nmelancholy, throbbing murmur once again. Stapleton looked at me with a\ncurious expression in his face.\n\n\"Queer place, the moor!\" said he.\n\n\"But what is it?\"\n\n\"The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for its\nprey. I've heard it once or twice before, but never quite so loud.\"\n\nI looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge swelling\nplain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing stirred over\nthe vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which croaked loudly from a tor\nbehind us.\n\n\"You are an educated man. You don't believe such nonsense as that?\" said\nI. \"What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?\"\n\n\"Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It's the mud settling, or the water\nrising, or something.\"\n\n\"No, no, that was a living voice.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?\"\n\n\"No, I never did.\"\n\n\"It's a very rare bird--practically extinct--in England now, but all\nthings are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be surprised to\nlearn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns.\"\n\n\"It's the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my life.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's rather an uncanny place altogether. Look at the hillside\nyonder. What do you make of those?\"\n\nThe whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of stone, a\nscore of them at least.\n\n\"What are they? Sheep-pens?\"\n\n\"No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric man lived\nthickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has lived there since,\nwe find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them. These are\nhis wigwams with the roofs off. You can even see his hearth and his\ncouch if you have the curiosity to go inside.\n\n\"But it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?\"\n\n\"Neolithic man--no date.\"\n\n\"What did he do?\"\n\n\"He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for tin\nwhen the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look at the\ngreat trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes, you will find\nsome very singular points about the moor, Dr. Watson. Oh, excuse me an\ninstant! It is surely Cyclopides.\"\n\nA small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an instant\nStapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of\nit. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire, and my\nacquaintance never paused for an instant, bounding from tuft to tuft\nbehind it, his green net waving in the air. His gray clothes and jerky,\nzigzag, irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself.\nI was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his\nextraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the\ntreacherous mire, when I heard the sound of steps and, turning round,\nfound a woman near me upon the path. She had come from the direction in\nwhich the plume of smoke indicated the position of Merripit House, but\nthe dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close.\n\nI could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had\nbeen told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and I\nremembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty. The\nwoman who approached me was certainly that, and of a most uncommon type.\nThere could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister,\nfor Stapleton was neutral tinted, with light hair and gray eyes, while\nshe was darker than any brunette whom I have seen in England--slim,\nelegant, and tall. She had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it\nmight have seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the\nbeautiful dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure and elegant dress\nshe was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path. Her\neyes were on her brother as I turned, and then she quickened her pace\ntowards me. I had raised my hat and was about to make some explanatory\nremark when her own words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.\n\n\"Go back!\" she said. \"Go straight back to London, instantly.\"\n\nI could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at me, and\nshe tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.\n\n\"Why should I go back?\" I asked.\n\n\"I cannot explain.\" She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a curious lisp\nin her utterance. \"But for God's sake do what I ask you. Go back and\nnever set foot upon the moor again.\"\n\n\"But I have only just come.\"\n\n\"Man, man!\" she cried. \"Can you not tell when a warning is for your own\ngood? Go back to London! Start tonight! Get away from this place at all\ncosts! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word of what I have said. Would\nyou mind getting that orchid for me among the mare's-tails yonder? We\nare very rich in orchids on the moor, though, of course, you are rather\nlate to see the beauties of the place.\"\n\nStapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and\nflushed with his exertions.\n\n\"Halloa, Beryl!\" said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of his\ngreeting was not altogether a cordial one.\n\n\"Well, Jack, you are very hot.\"\n\n\"Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom found in\nthe late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed him!\" He spoke\nunconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the\ngirl to me.\n\n\"You have introduced yourselves, I can see.\"\n\n\"Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to see the\ntrue beauties of the moor.\"\n\n\"Why, who do you think this is?\"\n\n\"I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said I. \"Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My name is\nDr. Watson.\"\n\nA flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. \"We have been\ntalking at cross purposes,\" said she.\n\n\"Why, you had not very much time for talk,\" her brother remarked with\nthe same questioning eyes.\n\n\"I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being merely a\nvisitor,\" said she. \"It cannot much matter to him whether it is early\nor late for the orchids. But you will come on, will you not, and see\nMerripit House?\"\n\nA short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm\nof some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into repair and\nturned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded it, but the trees,\nas is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect of\nthe whole place was mean and melancholy. We were admitted by a strange,\nwizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in keeping with\nthe house. Inside, however, there were large rooms furnished with an\nelegance in which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I\nlooked from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor\nrolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel at what\ncould have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to\nlive in such a place.\n\n\"Queer spot to choose, is it not?\" said he as if in answer to my\nthought. \"And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we not,\nBeryl?\"\n\n\"Quite happy,\" said she, but there was no ring of conviction in her\nwords.\n\n\"I had a school,\" said Stapleton. \"It was in the north country. The work\nto a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the\nprivilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young minds,\nand of impressing them with one's own character and ideals was very dear\nto me. However, the fates were against us. A serious epidemic broke out\nin the school and three of the boys died. It never recovered from the\nblow, and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet,\nif it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys,\nI could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes\nfor botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here, and my\nsister is as devoted to Nature as I am. All this, Dr. Watson, has been\nbrought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out\nof our window.\"\n\n\"It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull--less for\nyou, perhaps, than for your sister.\"\n\n\"No, no, I am never dull,\" said she quickly.\n\n\"We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting neighbours.\nDr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line. Poor Sir Charles was\nalso an admirable companion. We knew him well and miss him more than\nI can tell. Do you think that I should intrude if I were to call this\nafternoon and make the acquaintance of Sir Henry?\"\n\n\"I am sure that he would be delighted.\"\n\n\"Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may in\nour humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he\nbecomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you come upstairs, Dr.\nWatson, and inspect my collection of Lepidoptera? I think it is the most\ncomplete one in the south-west of England. By the time that you have\nlooked through them lunch will be almost ready.\"\n\nBut I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the moor,\nthe death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been\nassociated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all these things\ntinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of these more or less\nvague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of\nMiss Stapleton, delivered with such intense earnestness that I could\nnot doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it. I resisted\nall pressure to stay for lunch, and I set off at once upon my return\njourney, taking the grass-grown path by which we had come.\n\nIt seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those\nwho knew it, for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see\nMiss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. Her face\nwas beautifully flushed with her exertions and she held her hand to her\nside.\n\n\"I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,\" said she.\n\"I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop, or my brother\nmay miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the stupid\nmistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please forget the\nwords I said, which have no application whatever to you.\"\n\n\"But I can't forget them, Miss Stapleton,\" said I. \"I am Sir Henry's\nfriend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine. Tell me why it\nwas that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to London.\"\n\n\"A woman's whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will understand\nthat I cannot always give reasons for what I say or do.\"\n\n\"No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look in\nyour eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton, for ever\nsince I have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me.\nLife has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches\neverywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track.\nTell me then what it was that you meant, and I will promise to convey\nyour warning to Sir Henry.\"\n\nAn expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face, but\nher eyes had hardened again when she answered me.\n\n\"You make too much of it, Dr. Watson,\" said she. \"My brother and I\nwere very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him very\nintimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house. He\nwas deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family, and when\nthis tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some grounds\nfor the fears which he had expressed. I was distressed therefore when\nanother member of the family came down to live here, and I felt that he\nshould be warned of the danger which he will run. That was all which I\nintended to convey.\n\n\"But what is the danger?\"\n\n\"You know the story of the hound?\"\n\n\"I do not believe in such nonsense.\"\n\n\"But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him away from\na place which has always been fatal to his family. The world is wide.\nWhy should he wish to live at the place of danger?\"\n\n\"Because it is the place of danger. That is Sir Henry's nature. I fear\nthat unless you can give me some more definite information than this it\nwould be impossible to get him to move.\"\n\n\"I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything definite.\"\n\n\"I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no\nmore than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish your\nbrother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to which he, or\nanyone else, could object.\"\n\n\"My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he thinks it\nis for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He would be very angry\nif he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir Henry to\ngo away. But I have done my duty now and I will say no more. I must go\nback, or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!\"\nShe turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered\nboulders, while I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to\nBaskerville Hall.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8. First Report of Dr. Watson\n\n\n\nFrom this point onward I will follow the course of events by\ntranscribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie before me\non the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly\nas written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more\naccurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can\npossibly do.\n\n\nBaskerville Hall, October 13th. MY DEAR HOLMES: My previous letters\nand telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as to all that has\noccurred in this most God-forsaken corner of the world. The longer one\nstays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul,\nits vastness, and also its grim charm. When you are once out upon its\nbosom you have left all traces of modern England behind you, but, on the\nother hand, you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of\nthe prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the houses\nof these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge monoliths which\nare supposed to have marked their temples. As you look at their gray\nstone huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own age behind\nyou, and if you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the\nlow door fitting a flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you\nwould feel that his presence there was more natural than your own. The\nstrange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must\nalways have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I could\nimagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced\nto accept that which none other would occupy.\n\nAll this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and\nwill probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind.\nI can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun\nmoved round the earth or the earth round the sun. Let me, therefore,\nreturn to the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville.\n\nIf you have not had any report within the last few days it is because\nup to today there was nothing of importance to relate. Then a very\nsurprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you in due course.\nBut, first of all, I must keep you in touch with some of the other\nfactors in the situation.\n\nOne of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped\nconvict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that he\nhas got right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely\nhouseholders of this district. A fortnight has passed since his flight,\nduring which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him. It\nis surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during\nall that time. Of course, so far as his concealment goes there is\nno difficulty at all. Any one of these stone huts would give him a\nhiding-place. But there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and\nslaughter one of the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone,\nand the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.\n\nWe are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take\ngood care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments\nwhen I have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles from any help.\nThere are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother, the\nlatter not a very strong man. They would be helpless in the hands of a\ndesperate fellow like this Notting Hill criminal if he could once effect\nan entrance. Both Sir Henry and I were concerned at their situation, and\nit was suggested that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there,\nbut Stapleton would not hear of it.\n\nThe fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a\nconsiderable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be wondered\nat, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like\nhim, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman. There is\nsomething tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast\nto her cool and unemotional brother. Yet he also gives the idea of\nhidden fires. He has certainly a very marked influence over her, for\nI have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking\napprobation for what she said. I trust that he is kind to her. There is\na dry glitter in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes\nwith a positive and possibly a harsh nature. You would find him an\ninteresting study.\n\nHe came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the very\nnext morning he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the\nwicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It was an excursion of\nsome miles across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might\nhave suggested the story. We found a short valley between rugged tors\nwhich led to an open, grassy space flecked over with the white cotton\ngrass. In the middle of it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at\nthe upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some\nmonstrous beast. In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old\ntragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more\nthan once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the\ninterference of the supernatural in the affairs of men. He spoke\nlightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest. Stapleton\nwas guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that he said less\nthan he might, and that he would not express his whole opinion out of\nconsideration for the feelings of the baronet. He told us of similar\ncases, where families had suffered from some evil influence, and he left\nus with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter.\n\nOn our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was there\nthat Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton. From the first\nmoment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her, and\nI am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual. He referred to her\nagain and again on our walk home, and since then hardly a day has passed\nthat we have not seen something of the brother and sister. They dine\nhere tonight, and there is some talk of our going to them next week. One\nwould imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and\nyet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest disapprobation\nin his face when Sir Henry has been paying some attention to his sister.\nHe is much attached to her, no doubt, and would lead a lonely life\nwithout her, but it would seem the height of selfishness if he were to\nstand in the way of her making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain\nthat he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have\nseveral times observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from\nbeing tete-a-tete. By the way, your instructions to me never to allow\nSir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love\naffair were to be added to our other difficulties. My popularity would\nsoon suffer if I were to carry out your orders to the letter.\n\nThe other day--Thursday, to be more exact--Dr. Mortimer lunched with us.\nHe has been excavating a barrow at Long Down and has got a prehistoric\nskull which fills him with great joy. Never was there such a\nsingle-minded enthusiast as he! The Stapletons came in afterwards, and\nthe good doctor took us all to the yew alley at Sir Henry's request to\nshow us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night. It is\na long, dismal walk, the yew alley, between two high walls of clipped\nhedge, with a narrow band of grass upon either side. At the far end is\nan old tumble-down summer-house. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where\nthe old gentleman left his cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate with\na latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your theory of the\naffair and tried to picture all that had occurred. As the old man stood\nthere he saw something coming across the moor, something which terrified\nhim so that he lost his wits and ran and ran until he died of sheer\nhorror and exhaustion. There was the long, gloomy tunnel down which\nhe fled. And from what? A sheep-dog of the moor? Or a spectral hound,\nblack, silent, and monstrous? Was there a human agency in the matter?\nDid the pale, watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say? It was\nall dim and vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind\nit.\n\nOne other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr.\nFrankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south of us.\nHe is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric. His passion\nis for the British law, and he has spent a large fortune in litigation.\nHe fights for the mere pleasure of fighting and is equally ready to take\nup either side of a question, so that it is no wonder that he has found\nit a costly amusement. Sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy\nthe parish to make him open it. At others he will with his own hands\ntear down some other man's gate and declare that a path has existed\nthere from time immemorial, defying the owner to prosecute him for\ntrespass. He is learned in old manorial and communal rights, and he\napplies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy\nand sometimes against them, so that he is periodically either carried in\ntriumph down the village street or else burned in effigy, according to\nhis latest exploit. He is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his\nhands at present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of his\nfortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the future.\nApart from the law he seems a kindly, good-natured person, and I\nonly mention him because you were particular that I should send some\ndescription of the people who surround us. He is curiously employed\nat present, for, being an amateur astronomer, he has an excellent\ntelescope, with which he lies upon the roof of his own house and sweeps\nthe moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped\nconvict. If he would confine his energies to this all would be well, but\nthere are rumours that he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for opening\na grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the\nNeolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to keep our lives\nfrom being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly\nneeded.\n\nAnd now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict, the\nStapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let me end on\nthat which is most important and tell you more about the Barrymores, and\nespecially about the surprising development of last night.\n\nFirst of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London in\norder to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I have already\nexplained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test was\nworthless and that we have no proof one way or the other. I told Sir\nHenry how the matter stood, and he at once, in his downright fashion,\nhad Barrymore up and asked him whether he had received the telegram\nhimself. Barrymore said that he had.\n\n\"Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?\" asked Sir Henry.\n\nBarrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.\n\n\"No,\" said he, \"I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife brought\nit up to me.\"\n\n\"Did you answer it yourself?\"\n\n\"No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it.\"\n\nIn the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.\n\n\"I could not quite understand the object of your questions this morning,\nSir Henry,\" said he. \"I trust that they do not mean that I have done\nanything to forfeit your confidence?\"\n\nSir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by giving\nhim a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London outfit having\nnow all arrived.\n\nMrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid person, very\nlimited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical. You\ncould hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet I have told you how,\non the first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then\nI have more than once observed traces of tears upon her face. Some deep\nsorrow gnaws ever at her heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty\nmemory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a\ndomestic tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular\nand questionable in this man's character, but the adventure of last\nnight brings all my suspicions to a head.\n\nAnd yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that I am\nnot a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in this house\nmy slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night, about two in the\nmorning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room. I rose,\nopened my door, and peeped out. A long black shadow was trailing down\nthe corridor. It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage\nwith a candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no\ncovering to his feet. I could merely see the outline, but his height\ntold me that it was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly,\nand there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole\nappearance.\n\nI have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs\nround the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. I waited\nuntil he had passed out of sight and then I followed him. When I came\nround the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor, and\nI could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he\nhad entered one of the rooms. Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and\nunoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever. The\nlight shone steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down\nthe passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of the\ndoor.\n\nBarrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the\nglass. His profile was half turned towards me, and his face seemed to be\nrigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor.\nFor some minutes he stood watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan\nand with an impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my\nway back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing\nonce more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had fallen\ninto a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could\nnot tell whence the sound came. What it all means I cannot guess, but\nthere is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which\nsooner or later we shall get to the bottom of. I do not trouble you with\nmy theories, for you asked me to furnish you only with facts. I have\nhad a long talk with Sir Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of\ncampaign founded upon my observations of last night. I will not speak\nabout it just now, but it should make my next report interesting\nreading.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9. The Light upon the Moor [Second Report of Dr. Watson]\n\n\n\nBaskerville Hall, Oct. 15th. MY DEAR HOLMES: If I was compelled to\nleave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must\nacknowledge that I am making up for lost time, and that events are now\ncrowding thick and fast upon us. In my last report I ended upon my top\nnote with Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already\nwhich will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you. Things\nhave taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. In some ways they\nhave within the last forty-eight hours become much clearer and in some\nways they have become more complicated. But I will tell you all and you\nshall judge for yourself.\n\nBefore breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went down the\ncorridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had been on the night\nbefore. The western window through which he had stared so intently has,\nI noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows in the house--it\ncommands the nearest outlook on to the moor. There is an opening between\ntwo trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down\nupon it, while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse\nwhich can be obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since\nonly this window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for\nsomething or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so that I\ncan hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone. It had struck\nme that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot. That would\nhave accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness\nof his wife. The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well equipped\nto steal the heart of a country girl, so that this theory seemed to\nhave something to support it. That opening of the door which I had heard\nafter I had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep\nsome clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the morning,\nand I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however much the result\nmay have shown that they were unfounded.\n\nBut whatever the true explanation of Barrymore's movements might be,\nI felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until I could\nexplain them was more than I could bear. I had an interview with the\nbaronet in his study after breakfast, and I told him all that I had\nseen. He was less surprised than I had expected.\n\n\"I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to speak\nto him about it,\" said he. \"Two or three times I have heard his steps in\nthe passage, coming and going, just about the hour you name.\"\n\n\"Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular window,\" I\nsuggested.\n\n\"Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and see what\nit is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes would do if he\nwere here.\"\n\n\"I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,\" said I. \"He\nwould follow Barrymore and see what he did.\"\n\n\"Then we shall do it together.\"\n\n\"But surely he would hear us.\"\n\n\"The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance of\nthat. We'll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he passes.\" Sir\nHenry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was evident that he hailed\nthe adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor.\n\nThe baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared\nthe plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from London, so that we\nmay expect great changes to begin here soon. There have been decorators\nand furnishers up from Plymouth, and it is evident that our friend\nhas large ideas and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the\ngrandeur of his family. When the house is renovated and refurnished, all\nthat he will need will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves\nthere are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady\nis willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman\nthan he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton. And yet the\ncourse of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under\nthe circumstances expect. Today, for example, its surface was broken\nby a very unexpected ripple, which has caused our friend considerable\nperplexity and annoyance.\n\nAfter the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir Henry\nput on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of course I did the\nsame.\n\n\"What, are you coming, Watson?\" he asked, looking at me in a curious\nway.\n\n\"That depends on whether you are going on the moor,\" said I.\n\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\n\"Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude, but\nyou heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you, and\nespecially that you should not go alone upon the moor.\"\n\nSir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said he, \"Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not foresee\nsome things which have happened since I have been on the moor. You\nunderstand me? I am sure that you are the last man in the world who\nwould wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out alone.\"\n\nIt put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to say or\nwhat to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his cane and\nwas gone.\n\nBut when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached me\nbitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my sight.\nI imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to you and to\nconfess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your\ninstructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed at the very thought. It\nmight not even now be too late to overtake him, so I set off at once in\nthe direction of Merripit House.\n\nI hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything\nof Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor path branches\noff. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the wrong direction after\nall, I mounted a hill from which I could command a view--the same hill\nwhich is cut into the dark quarry. Thence I saw him at once. He was on\nthe moor path about a quarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his side\nwho could only be Miss Stapleton. It was clear that there was already\nan understanding between them and that they had met by appointment. They\nwere walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making\nquick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest in what\nshe was saying, while he listened intently, and once or twice shook his\nhead in strong dissent. I stood among the rocks watching them, very much\npuzzled as to what I should do next. To follow them and break into their\nintimate conversation seemed to be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was\nnever for an instant to let him out of my sight. To act the spy upon a\nfriend was a hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to\nobserve him from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to\nhim afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any sudden danger had\nthreatened him I was too far away to be of use, and yet I am sure that\nyou will agree with me that the position was very difficult, and that\nthere was nothing more which I could do.\n\nOur friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and were\nstanding deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was suddenly\naware that I was not the only witness of their interview. A wisp of\ngreen floating in the air caught my eye, and another glance showed me\nthat it was carried on a stick by a man who was moving among the broken\nground. It was Stapleton with his butterfly-net. He was very much closer\nto the pair than I was, and he appeared to be moving in their direction.\nAt this instant Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. His\narm was round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from\nhim with her face averted. He stooped his head to hers, and she raised\none hand as if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring apart and turn\nhurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of the interruption. He was\nrunning wildly towards them, his absurd net dangling behind him. He\ngesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers.\nWhat the scene meant I could not imagine, but it seemed to me that\nStapleton was abusing Sir Henry, who offered explanations, which became\nmore angry as the other refused to accept them. The lady stood by in\nhaughty silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in\na peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at Sir\nHenry, walked off by the side of her brother. The naturalist's angry\ngestures showed that the lady was included in his displeasure. The\nbaronet stood for a minute looking after them, and then he walked slowly\nback the way that he had come, his head hanging, the very picture of\ndejection.\n\nWhat all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed to\nhave witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge. I ran\ndown the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom. His face was\nflushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his\nwit's ends what to do.\n\n\"Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped from?\" said he. \"You don't mean\nto say that you came after me in spite of all?\"\n\nI explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to remain\nbehind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed all that\nhad occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but my frankness\ndisarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh.\n\n\"You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe\nplace for a man to be private,\" said he, \"but, by thunder, the whole\ncountryside seems to have been out to see me do my wooing--and a mighty\npoor wooing at that! Where had you engaged a seat?\"\n\n\"I was on that hill.\"\n\n\"Quite in the back row, eh? But her brother was well up to the front.\nDid you see him come out on us?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did.\"\n\n\"Did he ever strike you as being crazy--this brother of hers?\"\n\n\"I can't say that he ever did.\"\n\n\"I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until today, but you\ncan take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a straitjacket.\nWhat's the matter with me, anyhow? You've lived near me for some weeks,\nWatson. Tell me straight, now! Is there anything that would prevent me\nfrom making a good husband to a woman that I loved?\"\n\n\"I should say not.\"\n\n\"He can't object to my worldly position, so it must be myself that he\nhas this down on. What has he against me? I never hurt man or woman in\nmy life that I know of. And yet he would not so much as let me touch the\ntips of her fingers.\"\n\n\"Did he say so?\"\n\n\"That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I've only known her these\nfew weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me,\nand she, too--she was happy when she was with me, and that I'll swear.\nThere's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than words. But he\nhas never let us get together and it was only today for the first time\nthat I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone. She was glad\nto meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk about,\nand she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could have\nstopped it. She kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger,\nand that she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that\nsince I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if she\nreally wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her to arrange\nto go with me. With that I offered in as many words to marry her, but\nbefore she could answer, down came this brother of hers, running at us\nwith a face on him like a madman. He was just white with rage, and those\nlight eyes of his were blazing with fury. What was I doing with the\nlady? How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her?\nDid I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he\nhad not been her brother I should have known better how to answer him.\nAs it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as\nI was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour me by\nbecoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I\nlost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should\nperhaps, considering that she was standing by. So it ended by his going\noff with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any\nin this county. Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I'll owe you\nmore than ever I can hope to pay.\"\n\nI tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely puzzled\nmyself. Our friend's title, his fortune, his age, his character, and his\nappearance are all in his favour, and I know nothing against him unless\nit be this dark fate which runs in his family. That his advances should\nbe rejected so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wishes\nand that the lady should accept the situation without protest is very\namazing. However, our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from\nStapleton himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies\nfor his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview with\nSir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was that the\nbreach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at Merripit House next\nFriday as a sign of it.\n\n\"I don't say now that he isn't a crazy man,\" said Sir Henry; \"I can't\nforget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning, but I must\nallow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done.\"\n\n\"Did he give any explanation of his conduct?\"\n\n\"His sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural enough,\nand I am glad that he should understand her value. They have always been\ntogether, and according to his account he has been a very lonely man\nwith only her as a companion, so that the thought of losing her was\nreally terrible to him. He had not understood, he said, that I was\nbecoming attached to her, but when he saw with his own eyes that it was\nreally so, and that she might be taken away from him, it gave him such a\nshock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did.\nHe was very sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish\nand how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a\nbeautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. If she\nhad to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to\nanyone else. But in any case it was a blow to him and it would take him\nsome time before he could prepare himself to meet it. He would withdraw\nall opposition upon his part if I would promise for three months to let\nthe matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady's friendship\nduring that time without claiming her love. This I promised, and so the\nmatter rests.\"\n\nSo there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is something to\nhave touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering.\nWe know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister's\nsuitor--even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And\nnow I pass on to another thread which I have extricated out of the\ntangled skein, the mystery of the sobs in the night, of the tear-stained\nface of Mrs. Barrymore, of the secret journey of the butler to the\nwestern lattice window. Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me\nthat I have not disappointed you as an agent--that you do not regret\nthe confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down. All these\nthings have by one night's work been thoroughly cleared.\n\nI have said \"by one night's work,\" but, in truth, it was by two nights'\nwork, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up with Sir Henry\nin his rooms until nearly three o'clock in the morning, but no sound of\nany sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs. It was\na most melancholy vigil and ended by each of us falling asleep in our\nchairs. Fortunately we were not discouraged, and we determined to try\nagain. The next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes\nwithout making the least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours\ncrawled by, and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of\npatient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into\nwhich he hopes the game may wander. One struck, and two, and we had\nalmost for the second time given it up in despair when in an instant we\nboth sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary senses keenly on\nthe alert once more. We had heard the creak of a step in the passage.\n\nVery stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the\ndistance. Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out in\npursuit. Already our man had gone round the gallery and the corridor was\nall in darkness. Softly we stole along until we had come into the other\nwing. We were just in time to catch a glimpse of the tall, black-bearded\nfigure, his shoulders rounded as he tiptoed down the passage. Then he\npassed through the same door as before, and the light of the candle\nframed it in the darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the\ngloom of the corridor. We shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every\nplank before we dared to put our whole weight upon it. We had taken the\nprecaution of leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the old boards\nsnapped and creaked beneath our tread. Sometimes it seemed impossible\nthat he should fail to hear our approach. However, the man is\nfortunately rather deaf, and he was entirely preoccupied in that which\nhe was doing. When at last we reached the door and peeped through we\nfound him crouching at the window, candle in hand, his white, intent\nface pressed against the pane, exactly as I had seen him two nights\nbefore.\n\nWe had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to whom\nthe most direct way is always the most natural. He walked into the room,\nand as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss\nof his breath and stood, livid and trembling, before us. His dark eyes,\nglaring out of the white mask of his face, were full of horror and\nastonishment as he gazed from Sir Henry to me.\n\n\"What are you doing here, Barrymore?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir.\" His agitation was so great that he could hardly speak,\nand the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his candle. \"It\nwas the window, sir. I go round at night to see that they are fastened.\"\n\n\"On the second floor?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, all the windows.\"\n\n\"Look here, Barrymore,\" said Sir Henry sternly, \"we have made up our\nminds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you trouble to tell\nit sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies! What were you doing at\nthat window?\"\n\nThe fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his hands\ntogether like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery.\n\n\"I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle to the window.\"\n\n\"And why were you holding a candle to the window?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me, Sir Henry--don't ask me! I give you my word, sir, that it\nis not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If it concerned no one but\nmyself I would not try to keep it from you.\"\n\nA sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from the trembling\nhand of the butler.\n\n\"He must have been holding it as a signal,\" said I. \"Let us see if\nthere is any answer.\" I held it as he had done, and stared out into the\ndarkness of the night. Vaguely I could discern the black bank of the\ntrees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the moon was behind the\nclouds. And then I gave a cry of exultation, for a tiny pinpoint of\nyellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily\nin the centre of the black square framed by the window.\n\n\"There it is!\" I cried.\n\n\"No, no, sir, it is nothing--nothing at all!\" the butler broke in; \"I\nassure you, sir--\"\n\n\"Move your light across the window, Watson!\" cried the baronet. \"See,\nthe other moves also! Now, you rascal, do you deny that it is a signal?\nCome, speak up! Who is your confederate out yonder, and what is this\nconspiracy that is going on?\"\n\nThe man's face became openly defiant. \"It is my business, and not yours.\nI will not tell.\"\n\n\"Then you leave my employment right away.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir. If I must I must.\"\n\n\"And you go in disgrace. By thunder, you may well be ashamed of\nyourself. Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred years under\nthis roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot against me.\"\n\n\"No, no, sir; no, not against you!\" It was a woman's voice, and Mrs.\nBarrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband, was standing\nat the door. Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have been comic\nwere it not for the intensity of feeling upon her face.\n\n\"We have to go, Eliza. This is the end of it. You can pack our things,\"\nsaid the butler.\n\n\"Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this? It is my doing, Sir\nHenry--all mine. He has done nothing except for my sake and because I\nasked him.\"\n\n\"Speak out, then! What does it mean?\"\n\n\"My unhappy brother is starving on the moor. We cannot let him perish at\nour very gates. The light is a signal to him that food is ready for him,\nand his light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it.\"\n\n\"Then your brother is--\"\n\n\"The escaped convict, sir--Selden, the criminal.\"\n\n\"That's the truth, sir,\" said Barrymore. \"I said that it was not my\nsecret and that I could not tell it to you. But now you have heard it,\nand you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you.\"\n\nThis, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at night\nand the light at the window. Sir Henry and I both stared at the woman in\namazement. Was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was of\nthe same blood as one of the most notorious criminals in the country?\n\n\"Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother. We humoured\nhim too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way in everything\nuntil he came to think that the world was made for his pleasure, and\nthat he could do what he liked in it. Then as he grew older he met\nwicked companions, and the devil entered into him until he broke my\nmother's heart and dragged our name in the dirt. From crime to crime\nhe sank lower and lower until it is only the mercy of God which has\nsnatched him from the scaffold; but to me, sir, he was always the little\ncurly-headed boy that I had nursed and played with as an elder sister\nwould. That was why he broke prison, sir. He knew that I was here and\nthat we could not refuse to help him. When he dragged himself here one\nnight, weary and starving, with the warders hard at his heels, what\ncould we do? We took him in and fed him and cared for him. Then you\nreturned, sir, and my brother thought he would be safer on the moor than\nanywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he lay in hiding there.\nBut every second night we made sure if he was still there by putting a\nlight in the window, and if there was an answer my husband took out some\nbread and meat to him. Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long\nas he was there we could not desert him. That is the whole truth, as I\nam an honest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in\nthe matter it does not lie with my husband but with me, for whose sake\nhe has done all that he has.\"\n\nThe woman's words came with an intense earnestness which carried\nconviction with them.\n\n\"Is this true, Barrymore?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.\"\n\n\"Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. Forget what\nI have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk further about\nthis matter in the morning.\"\n\nWhen they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir Henry had\nflung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces. Far away\nin the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow\nlight.\n\n\"I wonder he dares,\" said Sir Henry.\n\n\"It may be so placed as to be only visible from here.\"\n\n\"Very likely. How far do you think it is?\"\n\n\"Out by the Cleft Tor, I think.\"\n\n\"Not more than a mile or two off.\"\n\n\"Hardly that.\"\n\n\"Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to it.\nAnd he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. By thunder, Watson,\nI am going out to take that man!\"\n\nThe same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if the\nBarrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had been\nforced from them. The man was a danger to the community, an unmitigated\nscoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse. We were only doing\nour duty in taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no\nharm. With his brutal and violent nature, others would have to pay the\nprice if we held our hands. Any night, for example, our neighbours the\nStapletons might be attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of\nthis which made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.\n\n\"I will come,\" said I.\n\n\"Then get your revolver and put on your boots. The sooner we start the\nbetter, as the fellow may put out his light and be off.\"\n\nIn five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our expedition.\nWe hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull moaning of the\nautumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves. The night air was\nheavy with the smell of damp and decay. Now and again the moon peeped\nout for an instant, but clouds were driving over the face of the sky,\nand just as we came out on the moor a thin rain began to fall. The light\nstill burned steadily in front.\n\n\"Are you armed?\" I asked.\n\n\"I have a hunting-crop.\"\n\n\"We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a desperate\nfellow. We shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before\nhe can resist.\"\n\n\"I say, Watson,\" said the baronet, \"what would Holmes say to this? How\nabout that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted?\"\n\nAs if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom\nof the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon the borders\nof the great Grimpen Mire. It came with the wind through the silence\nof the night, a long, deep mutter, then a rising howl, and then the sad\nmoan in which it died away. Again and again it sounded, the whole air\nthrobbing with it, strident, wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my\nsleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness.\n\n\"My God, what's that, Watson?\"\n\n\"I don't know. It's a sound they have on the moor. I heard it once\nbefore.\"\n\nIt died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood\nstraining our ears, but nothing came.\n\n\"Watson,\" said the baronet, \"it was the cry of a hound.\"\n\nMy blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice which\ntold of the sudden horror which had seized him.\n\n\"What do they call this sound?\" he asked.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The folk on the countryside.\"\n\n\"Oh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what they call it?\"\n\n\"Tell me, Watson. What do they say of it?\"\n\nI hesitated but could not escape the question.\n\n\"They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles.\"\n\nHe groaned and was silent for a few moments.\n\n\"A hound it was,\" he said at last, \"but it seemed to come from miles\naway, over yonder, I think.\"\n\n\"It was hard to say whence it came.\"\n\n\"It rose and fell with the wind. Isn't that the direction of the great\nGrimpen Mire?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is.\"\n\n\"Well, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn't you think yourself that\nit was the cry of a hound? I am not a child. You need not fear to speak\nthe truth.\"\n\n\"Stapleton was with me when I heard it last. He said that it might be\nthe calling of a strange bird.\"\n\n\"No, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth in all these\nstories? Is it possible that I am really in danger from so dark a cause?\nYou don't believe it, do you, Watson?\"\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\"And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it is another\nto stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as\nthat. And my uncle! There was the footprint of the hound beside him as\nhe lay. It all fits together. I don't think that I am a coward, Watson,\nbut that sound seemed to freeze my very blood. Feel my hand!\"\n\nIt was as cold as a block of marble.\n\n\"You'll be all right tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I don't think I'll get that cry out of my head. What do you advise that\nwe do now?\"\n\n\"Shall we turn back?\"\n\n\"No, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do it. We\nafter the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not, after us. Come\non! We'll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon\nthe moor.\"\n\nWe stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of the\ncraggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning steadily\nin front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon\na pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon\nthe horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us.\nBut at last we could see whence it came, and then we knew that we were\nindeed very close. A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the\nrocks which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it\nand also to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of\nBaskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach, and\ncrouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. It was strange\nto see this single candle burning there in the middle of the moor, with\nno sign of life near it--just the one straight yellow flame and the\ngleam of the rock on each side of it.\n\n\"What shall we do now?\" whispered Sir Henry.\n\n\"Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get a\nglimpse of him.\"\n\nThe words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him. Over the\nrocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was thrust out\nan evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all seamed and scored with\nvile passions. Foul with mire, with a bristling beard, and hung with\nmatted hair, it might well have belonged to one of those old savages\nwho dwelt in the burrows on the hillsides. The light beneath him was\nreflected in his small, cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and\nleft through the darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard\nthe steps of the hunters.\n\nSomething had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have been that\nBarrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to give, or\nthe fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not\nwell, but I could read his fears upon his wicked face. Any instant he\nmight dash out the light and vanish in the darkness. I sprang forward\ntherefore, and Sir Henry did the same. At the same moment the convict\nscreamed out a curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against\nthe boulder which had sheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his short,\nsquat, strongly built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run.\nAt the same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds.\nWe rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man running with\ngreat speed down the other side, springing over the stones in his way\nwith the activity of a mountain goat. A lucky long shot of my revolver\nmight have crippled him, but I had brought it only to defend myself if\nattacked and not to shoot an unarmed man who was running away.\n\nWe were both swift runners and in fairly good training, but we soon\nfound that we had no chance of overtaking him. We saw him for a long\ntime in the moonlight until he was only a small speck moving swiftly\namong the boulders upon the side of a distant hill. We ran and ran until\nwe were completely blown, but the space between us grew ever wider.\nFinally we stopped and sat panting on two rocks, while we watched him\ndisappearing in the distance.\n\nAnd it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and\nunexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were turning to go\nhome, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was low upon the\nright, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up against the\nlower curve of its silver disc. There, outlined as black as an ebony\nstatue on that shining background, I saw the figure of a man upon the\ntor. Do not think that it was a delusion, Holmes. I assure you that\nI have never in my life seen anything more clearly. As far as I could\njudge, the figure was that of a tall, thin man. He stood with his legs\na little separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were\nbrooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lay\nbefore him. He might have been the very spirit of that terrible place.\nIt was not the convict. This man was far from the place where the\nlatter had disappeared. Besides, he was a much taller man. With a cry\nof surprise I pointed him out to the baronet, but in the instant during\nwhich I had turned to grasp his arm the man was gone. There was the\nsharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but\nits peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure.\n\nI wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it was some\ndistance away. The baronet's nerves were still quivering from that cry,\nwhich recalled the dark story of his family, and he was not in the mood\nfor fresh adventures. He had not seen this lonely man upon the tor and\ncould not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his commanding\nattitude had given to me. \"A warder, no doubt,\" said he. \"The moor\nhas been thick with them since this fellow escaped.\" Well, perhaps his\nexplanation may be the right one, but I should like to have some further\nproof of it. Today we mean to communicate to the Princetown people where\nthey should look for their missing man, but it is hard lines that\nwe have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our\nown prisoner. Such are the adventures of last night, and you must\nacknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well in\nthe matter of a report. Much of what I tell you is no doubt quite\nirrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that I should let you have\nall the facts and leave you to select for yourself those which will\nbe of most service to you in helping you to your conclusions. We are\ncertainly making some progress. So far as the Barrymores go we have\nfound the motive of their actions, and that has cleared up the situation\nvery much. But the moor with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants\nremains as inscrutable as ever. Perhaps in my next I may be able to\nthrow some light upon this also. Best of all would it be if you could\ncome down to us. In any case you will hear from me again in the course\nof the next few days.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10. Extract from the Diary of Dr. Watson\n\n\n\nSo far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have forwarded\nduring these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now, however, I have arrived\nat a point in my narrative where I am compelled to abandon this method\nand to trust once more to my recollections, aided by the diary which\nI kept at the time. A few extracts from the latter will carry me on to\nthose scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I\nproceed, then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the\nconvict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.\n\nOctober 16th. A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain. The house\nis banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and then to show the\ndreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver veins upon the sides of the\nhills, and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon\ntheir wet faces. It is melancholy outside and in. The baronet is in a\nblack reaction after the excitements of the night. I am conscious myself\nof a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger--ever present\ndanger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define it.\n\nAnd have I not cause for such a feeling? Consider the long sequence of\nincidents which have all pointed to some sinister influence which is\nat work around us. There is the death of the last occupant of the Hall,\nfulfilling so exactly the conditions of the family legend, and there\nare the repeated reports from peasants of the appearance of a strange\ncreature upon the moor. Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound\nwhich resembled the distant baying of a hound. It is incredible,\nimpossible, that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of\nnature. A spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the\nair with its howling is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may\nfall in with such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one\nquality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade me to\nbelieve in such a thing. To do so would be to descend to the level of\nthese poor peasants, who are not content with a mere fiend dog but must\nneeds describe him with hell-fire shooting from his mouth and eyes.\nHolmes would not listen to such fancies, and I am his agent. But facts\nare facts, and I have twice heard this crying upon the moor. Suppose\nthat there were really some huge hound loose upon it; that would go far\nto explain everything. But where could such a hound lie concealed, where\ndid it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one\nsaw it by day? It must be confessed that the natural explanation offers\nalmost as many difficulties as the other. And always, apart from the\nhound, there is the fact of the human agency in London, the man in the\ncab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry against the moor. This at\nleast was real, but it might have been the work of a protecting friend\nas easily as of an enemy. Where is that friend or enemy now? Has he\nremained in London, or has he followed us down here? Could he--could he\nbe the stranger whom I saw upon the tor?\n\nIt is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yet there are\nsome things to which I am ready to swear. He is no one whom I have seen\ndown here, and I have now met all the neighbours. The figure was far\ntaller than that of Stapleton, far thinner than that of Frankland.\nBarrymore it might possibly have been, but we had left him behind us,\nand I am certain that he could not have followed us. A stranger then is\nstill dogging us, just as a stranger dogged us in London. We have never\nshaken him off. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we\nmight find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this one\npurpose I must now devote all my energies.\n\nMy first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second and\nwisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as possible to\nanyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have been strangely shaken\nby that sound upon the moor. I will say nothing to add to his anxieties,\nbut I will take my own steps to attain my own end.\n\nWe had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore asked leave\nto speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in his study some little\ntime. Sitting in the billiard-room I more than once heard the sound of\nvoices raised, and I had a pretty good idea what the point was which was\nunder discussion. After a time the baronet opened his door and called\nfor me. \"Barrymore considers that he has a grievance,\" he said. \"He\nthinks that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down\nwhen he, of his own free will, had told us the secret.\"\n\nThe butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.\n\n\"I may have spoken too warmly, sir,\" said he, \"and if I have, I am sure\nthat I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very much surprised when\nI heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you\nhad been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has enough to fight against\nwithout my putting more upon his track.\"\n\n\"If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a different\nthing,\" said the baronet, \"you only told us, or rather your wife only\ntold us, when it was forced from you and you could not help yourself.\"\n\n\"I didn't think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir Henry--indeed\nI didn't.\"\n\n\"The man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered over the\nmoor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. You only want to\nget a glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr. Stapleton's house,\nfor example, with no one but himself to defend it. There's no safety for\nanyone until he is under lock and key.\"\n\n\"He'll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon that.\nBut he will never trouble anyone in this country again. I assure you,\nSir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have\nbeen made and he will be on his way to South America. For God's sake,\nsir, I beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the\nmoor. They have given up the chase there, and he can lie quiet until the\nship is ready for him. You can't tell on him without getting my wife and\nme into trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.\"\n\n\"What do you say, Watson?\"\n\nI shrugged my shoulders. \"If he were safely out of the country it would\nrelieve the tax-payer of a burden.\"\n\n\"But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes?\"\n\n\"He would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him with all\nthat he can want. To commit a crime would be to show where he was\nhiding.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Sir Henry. \"Well, Barrymore--\"\n\n\"God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! It would have killed\nmy poor wife had he been taken again.\"\n\n\"I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, after what\nwe have heard I don't feel as if I could give the man up, so there is an\nend of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.\"\n\nWith a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he hesitated\nand then came back.\n\n\"You've been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the best I\ncan for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and perhaps I should\nhave said it before, but it was long after the inquest that I found it\nout. I've never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man. It's about\npoor Sir Charles's death.\"\n\nThe baronet and I were both upon our feet. \"Do you know how he died?\"\n\n\"No, sir, I don't know that.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"I know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a woman.\"\n\n\"To meet a woman! He?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And the woman's name?\"\n\n\"I can't give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials. Her\ninitials were L. L.\"\n\n\"How do you know this, Barrymore?\"\n\n\"Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had usually a\ngreat many letters, for he was a public man and well known for his kind\nheart, so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him. But\nthat morning, as it chanced, there was only this one letter, so I took\nthe more notice of it. It was from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed\nin a woman's hand.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have done\nhad it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out\nSir Charles's study--it had never been touched since his death--and she\nfound the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate. The greater\npart of it was charred to pieces, but one little slip, the end of a\npage, hung together, and the writing could still be read, though it was\ngray on a black ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end\nof the letter and it said: 'Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn\nthis letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath it were signed\nthe initials L. L.\"\n\n\"Have you got that slip?\"\n\n\"No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.\"\n\n\"Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should not\nhave noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.\"\n\n\"And you have no idea who L. L. is?\"\n\n\"No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our hands\nupon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles's death.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal this important\ninformation.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us.\nAnd then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of Sir Charles, as we\nwell might be considering all that he has done for us. To rake this\nup couldn't help our poor master, and it's well to go carefully when\nthere's a lady in the case. Even the best of us--\"\n\n\"You thought it might injure his reputation?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it. But now you have been\nkind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to\ntell you all that I know about the matter.\"\n\n\"Very good, Barrymore; you can go.\" When the butler had left us Sir\nHenry turned to me. \"Well, Watson, what do you think of this new light?\"\n\n\"It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.\"\n\n\"So I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up the whole\nbusiness. We have gained that much. We know that there is someone who\nhas the facts if we can only find her. What do you think we should do?\"\n\n\"Let Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him the clue for\nwhich he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not bring him\ndown.\"\n\nI went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning's\nconversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he had been very busy\nof late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street were few and short,\nwith no comments upon the information which I had supplied and hardly\nany reference to my mission. No doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing\nall his faculties. And yet this new factor must surely arrest his\nattention and renew his interest. I wish that he were here.\n\nOctober 17th. All day today the rain poured down, rustling on the ivy\nand dripping from the eaves. I thought of the convict out upon the\nbleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever his crimes, he has\nsuffered something to atone for them. And then I thought of that other\none--the face in the cab, the figure against the moon. Was he also out\nin that deluged--the unseen watcher, the man of darkness? In the evening\nI put on my waterproof and I walked far upon the sodden moor, full of\ndark imaginings, the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling\nabout my ears. God help those who wander into the great mire now, for\neven the firm uplands are becoming a morass. I found the black tor upon\nwhich I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summit I\nlooked out myself across the melancholy downs. Rain squalls drifted\nacross their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured clouds hung\nlow over the landscape, trailing in gray wreaths down the sides of the\nfantastic hills. In the distant hollow on the left, half hidden by the\nmist, the two thin towers of Baskerville Hall rose above the trees. They\nwere the only signs of human life which I could see, save only those\nprehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills. Nowhere\nwas there any trace of that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot\ntwo nights before.\n\nAs I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in his dog-cart\nover a rough moorland track which led from the outlying farmhouse of\nFoulmire. He has been very attentive to us, and hardly a day has passed\nthat he has not called at the Hall to see how we were getting on. He\ninsisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart, and he gave me a lift\nhomeward. I found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little\nspaniel. It had wandered on to the moor and had never come back. I\ngave him such consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the\nGrimpen Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again.\n\n\"By the way, Mortimer,\" said I as we jolted along the rough road, \"I\nsuppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom\nyou do not know?\"\n\n\"Hardly any, I think.\"\n\n\"Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are L. L.?\"\n\nHe thought for a few minutes.\n\n\"No,\" said he. \"There are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom\nI can't answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose\ninitials are those. Wait a bit though,\" he added after a pause. \"There\nis Laura Lyons--her initials are L. L.--but she lives in Coombe Tracey.\"\n\n\"Who is she?\" I asked.\n\n\"She is Frankland's daughter.\"\n\n\"What! Old Frankland the crank?\"\n\n\"Exactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching on the\nmoor. He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. The fault from what\nI hear may not have been entirely on one side. Her father refused to\nhave anything to do with her because she had married without his consent\nand perhaps for one or two other reasons as well. So, between the old\nsinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time.\"\n\n\"How does she live?\"\n\n\"I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be more,\nfor his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever she may have\ndeserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad. Her story\ngot about, and several of the people here did something to enable her\nto earn an honest living. Stapleton did for one, and Sir Charles for\nanother. I gave a trifle myself. It was to set her up in a typewriting\nbusiness.\"\n\nHe wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to satisfy\nhis curiosity without telling him too much, for there is no reason why\nwe should take anyone into our confidence. Tomorrow morning I shall\nfind my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of\nequivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing\none incident in this chain of mysteries. I am certainly developing the\nwisdom of the serpent, for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an\ninconvenient extent I asked him casually to what type Frankland's skull\nbelonged, and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive.\nI have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.\n\nI have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and\nmelancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just now, which\ngives me one more strong card which I can play in due time.\n\nMortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played ecarte\nafterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the library, and I took\nthe chance to ask him a few questions.\n\n\"Well,\" said I, \"has this precious relation of yours departed, or is he\nstill lurking out yonder?\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has\nbrought nothing but trouble here! I've not heard of him since I left out\nfood for him last, and that was three days ago.\"\n\n\"Did you see him then?\"\n\n\"No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.\"\n\n\"Then he was certainly there?\"\n\n\"So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took it.\"\n\nI sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at Barrymore.\n\n\"You know that there is another man then?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.\"\n\n\"Have you seen him?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"How do you know of him then?\"\n\n\"Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. He's in hiding, too,\nbut he's not a convict as far as I can make out. I don't like it, Dr.\nWatson--I tell you straight, sir, that I don't like it.\" He spoke with a\nsudden passion of earnestness.\n\n\"Now, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matter but\nthat of your master. I have come here with no object except to help him.\nTell me, frankly, what it is that you don't like.\"\n\nBarrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst or\nfound it difficult to express his own feelings in words.\n\n\"It's all these goings-on, sir,\" he cried at last, waving his hand\ntowards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor. \"There's foul play\nsomewhere, and there's black villainy brewing, to that I'll swear!\nVery glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry on his way back to London\nagain!\"\n\n\"But what is it that alarms you?\"\n\n\"Look at Sir Charles's death! That was bad enough, for all that the\ncoroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night. There's not a\nman would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it. Look at this\nstranger hiding out yonder, and watching and waiting! What's he waiting\nfor? What does it mean? It means no good to anyone of the name of\nBaskerville, and very glad I shall be to be quit of it all on the day\nthat Sir Henry's new servants are ready to take over the Hall.\"\n\n\"But about this stranger,\" said I. \"Can you tell me anything about\nhim? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or what he was\ndoing?\"\n\n\"He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothing away.\nAt first he thought that he was the police, but soon he found that he\nhad some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he was, as far as he could\nsee, but what he was doing he could not make out.\"\n\n\"And where did he say that he lived?\"\n\n\"Among the old houses on the hillside--the stone huts where the old folk\nused to live.\"\n\n\"But how about his food?\"\n\n\"Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and brings all\nhe needs. I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what he wants.\"\n\n\"Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further of this some other time.\"\nWhen the butler had gone I walked over to the black window, and I looked\nthrough a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline\nof the wind-swept trees. It is a wild night indoors, and what must it\nbe in a stone hut upon the moor. What passion of hatred can it be which\nleads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time! And what deep and\nearnest purpose can he have which calls for such a trial! There, in that\nhut upon the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which\nhas vexed me so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have passed\nbefore I have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the\nmystery.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 11. The Man on the Tor\n\n\n\nThe extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter has\nbrought my narrative up to the eighteenth of October, a time when these\nstrange events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion.\nThe incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my\nrecollection, and I can tell them without reference to the notes made\nat the time. I start them from the day which succeeded that upon which\nI had established two facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura\nLyons of Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made\nan appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his\ndeath, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be found\namong the stone huts upon the hillside. With these two facts in my\npossession I felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be\ndeficient if I could not throw some further light upon these dark\nplaces.\n\nI had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about Mrs.\nLyons upon the evening before, for Dr. Mortimer remained with him at\ncards until it was very late. At breakfast, however, I informed him\nabout my discovery and asked him whether he would care to accompany\nme to Coombe Tracey. At first he was very eager to come, but on second\nthoughts it seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might\nbe better. The more formal we made the visit the less information we\nmight obtain. I left Sir Henry behind, therefore, not without some\nprickings of conscience, and drove off upon my new quest.\n\nWhen I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the horses, and\nI made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate. I had no\ndifficulty in finding her rooms, which were central and well appointed.\nA maid showed me in without ceremony, and as I entered the sitting-room\na lady, who was sitting before a Remington typewriter, sprang up with a\npleasant smile of welcome. Her face fell, however, when she saw that\nI was a stranger, and she sat down again and asked me the object of my\nvisit.\n\nThe first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme beauty. Her\neyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and her cheeks, though\nconsiderably freckled, were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the\nbrunette, the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose.\nAdmiration was, I repeat, the first impression. But the second was\ncriticism. There was something subtly wrong with the face, some\ncoarseness of expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness\nof lip which marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, are\nafterthoughts. At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in\nthe presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me the\nreasons for my visit. I had not quite understood until that instant how\ndelicate my mission was.\n\n\"I have the pleasure,\" said I, \"of knowing your father.\"\n\nIt was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it. \"There\nis nothing in common between my father and me,\" she said. \"I owe him\nnothing, and his friends are not mine. If it were not for the late Sir\nCharles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I might have starved for\nall that my father cared.\"\n\n\"It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come here to\nsee you.\"\n\nThe freckles started out on the lady's face.\n\n\"What can I tell you about him?\" she asked, and her fingers played\nnervously over the stops of her typewriter.\n\n\"You knew him, did you not?\"\n\n\"I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness. If I am\nable to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took\nin my unhappy situation.\"\n\n\"Did you correspond with him?\"\n\nThe lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes.\n\n\"What is the object of these questions?\" she asked sharply.\n\n\"The object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that I should ask\nthem here than that the matter should pass outside our control.\"\n\nShe was silent and her face was still very pale. At last she looked up\nwith something reckless and defiant in her manner.\n\n\"Well, I'll answer,\" she said. \"What are your questions?\"\n\n\"Did you correspond with Sir Charles?\"\n\n\"I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and\nhis generosity.\"\n\n\"Have you the dates of those letters?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Have you ever met him?\"\n\n\"Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He was a very\nretiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth.\"\n\n\"But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know\nenough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has\ndone?\"\n\nShe met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.\n\n\"There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to\nhelp me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of Sir\nCharles's. He was exceedingly kind, and it was through him that Sir\nCharles learned about my affairs.\"\n\nI knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton his\nalmoner upon several occasions, so the lady's statement bore the impress\nof truth upon it.\n\n\"Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you?\" I continued.\n\nMrs. Lyons flushed with anger again. \"Really, sir, this is a very\nextraordinary question.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.\"\n\n\"Then I answer, certainly not.\"\n\n\"Not on the very day of Sir Charles's death?\"\n\nThe flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before me. Her\ndry lips could not speak the \"No\" which I saw rather than heard.\n\n\"Surely your memory deceives you,\" said I. \"I could even quote a passage\nof your letter. It ran 'Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn\nthis letter, and be at the gate by ten o'clock.'\"\n\nI thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself by a supreme\neffort.\n\n\"Is there no such thing as a gentleman?\" she gasped.\n\n\"You do Sir Charles an injustice. He did burn the letter. But sometimes\na letter may be legible even when burned. You acknowledge now that you\nwrote it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did write it,\" she cried, pouring out her soul in a torrent of\nwords. \"I did write it. Why should I deny it? I have no reason to be\nashamed of it. I wished him to help me. I believed that if I had an\ninterview I could gain his help, so I asked him to meet me.\"\n\n\"But why at such an hour?\"\n\n\"Because I had only just learned that he was going to London next day\nand might be away for months. There were reasons why I could not get\nthere earlier.\"\n\n\"But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house?\"\n\n\"Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor's\nhouse?\"\n\n\"Well, what happened when you did get there?\"\n\n\"I never went.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Lyons!\"\n\n\"No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. I never went. Something\nintervened to prevent my going.\"\n\n\"What was that?\"\n\n\"That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.\"\n\n\"You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir Charles at\nthe very hour and place at which he met his death, but you deny that you\nkept the appointment.\"\n\n\"That is the truth.\"\n\nAgain and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get past that\npoint.\n\n\"Mrs. Lyons,\" said I as I rose from this long and inconclusive\ninterview, \"you are taking a very great responsibility and putting\nyourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean\nbreast of all that you know. If I have to call in the aid of the police\nyou will find how seriously you are compromised. If your position is\ninnocent, why did you in the first instance deny having written to Sir\nCharles upon that date?\"\n\n\"Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and\nthat I might find myself involved in a scandal.\"\n\n\"And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy your\nletter?\"\n\n\"If you have read the letter you will know.\"\n\n\"I did not say that I had read all the letter.\"\n\n\"You quoted some of it.\"\n\n\"I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned and it\nwas not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that you were so\npressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter which he received\non the day of his death.\"\n\n\"The matter is a very private one.\"\n\n\"The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation.\"\n\n\"I will tell you, then. If you have heard anything of my unhappy history\nyou will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it.\"\n\n\"I have heard so much.\"\n\n\"My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom I abhor.\nThe law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by the possibility\nthat he may force me to live with him. At the time that I wrote this\nletter to Sir Charles I had learned that there was a prospect of\nmy regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met. It meant\neverything to me--peace of mind, happiness, self-respect--everything. I\nknew Sir Charles's generosity, and I thought that if he heard the story\nfrom my own lips he would help me.\"\n\n\"Then how is it that you did not go?\"\n\n\"Because I received help in the interval from another source.\"\n\n\"Why then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this?\"\n\n\"So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next\nmorning.\"\n\nThe woman's story hung coherently together, and all my questions were\nunable to shake it. I could only check it by finding if she had, indeed,\ninstituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time\nof the tragedy.\n\nIt was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been to\nBaskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would be necessary\nto take her there, and could not have returned to Coombe Tracey until\nthe early hours of the morning. Such an excursion could not be kept\nsecret. The probability was, therefore, that she was telling the truth,\nor, at least, a part of the truth. I came away baffled and disheartened.\nOnce again I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across\nevery path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission. And yet\nthe more I thought of the lady's face and of her manner the more I felt\nthat something was being held back from me. Why should she turn so pale?\nWhy should she fight against every admission until it was forced from\nher? Why should she have been so reticent at the time of the tragedy?\nSurely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she\nwould have me believe. For the moment I could proceed no farther in that\ndirection, but must turn back to that other clue which was to be sought\nfor among the stone huts upon the moor.\n\nAnd that was a most vague direction. I realized it as I drove back\nand noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people.\nBarrymore's only indication had been that the stranger lived in one of\nthese abandoned huts, and many hundreds of them are scattered throughout\nthe length and breadth of the moor. But I had my own experience for a\nguide since it had shown me the man himself standing upon the summit of\nthe Black Tor. That, then, should be the centre of my search. From there\nI should explore every hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right\none. If this man were inside it I should find out from his own lips, at\nthe point of my revolver if necessary, who he was and why he had dogged\nus so long. He might slip away from us in the crowd of Regent Street,\nbut it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor. On the other\nhand, if I should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it I\nmust remain there, however long the vigil, until he returned. Holmes had\nmissed him in London. It would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run\nhim to earth where my master had failed.\n\nLuck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now at\nlast it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was none other\nthan Mr. Frankland, who was standing, gray-whiskered and red-faced,\noutside the gate of his garden, which opened on to the highroad along\nwhich I travelled.\n\n\"Good-day, Dr. Watson,\" cried he with unwonted good humour, \"you must\nreally give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and\nto congratulate me.\"\n\nMy feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what I\nhad heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was anxious to send\nPerkins and the wagonette home, and the opportunity was a good one. I\nalighted and sent a message to Sir Henry that I should walk over in time\nfor dinner. Then I followed Frankland into his dining-room.\n\n\"It is a great day for me, sir--one of the red-letter days of my life,\"\nhe cried with many chuckles. \"I have brought off a double event. I mean\nto teach them in these parts that law is law, and that there is a man\nhere who does not fear to invoke it. I have established a right of way\nthrough the centre of old Middleton's park, slap across it, sir, within\na hundred yards of his own front door. What do you think of that? We'll\nteach these magnates that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights\nof the commoners, confound them! And I've closed the wood where the\nFernworthy folk used to picnic. These infernal people seem to think that\nthere are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where they like\nwith their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr. Watson, and\nboth in my favour. I haven't had such a day since I had Sir John Morland\nfor trespass because he shot in his own warren.\"\n\n\"How on earth did you do that?\"\n\n\"Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading--Frankland v.\nMorland, Court of Queen's Bench. It cost me 200 pounds, but I got my\nverdict.\"\n\n\"Did it do you any good?\"\n\n\"None, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in the\nmatter. I act entirely from a sense of public duty. I have no doubt, for\nexample, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in effigy tonight.\nI told the police last time they did it that they should stop these\ndisgraceful exhibitions. The County Constabulary is in a scandalous\nstate, sir, and it has not afforded me the protection to which I am\nentitled. The case of Frankland v. Regina will bring the matter before\nthe attention of the public. I told them that they would have occasion\nto regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come true.\"\n\n\"How so?\" I asked.\n\nThe old man put on a very knowing expression. \"Because I could tell them\nwhat they are dying to know; but nothing would induce me to help the\nrascals in any way.\"\n\nI had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get away\nfrom his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it. I had seen\nenough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any\nstrong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences.\n\n\"Some poaching case, no doubt?\" said I with an indifferent manner.\n\n\"Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that! What about\nthe convict on the moor?\"\n\nI stared. \"You don't mean that you know where he is?\" said I.\n\n\"I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that I could\nhelp the police to lay their hands on him. Has it never struck you that\nthe way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food and so\ntrace it to him?\"\n\nHe certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth. \"No\ndoubt,\" said I; \"but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor?\"\n\n\"I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes\nhim his food.\"\n\nMy heart sank for Barrymore. It was a serious thing to be in the power\nof this spiteful old busybody. But his next remark took a weight from my\nmind.\n\n\"You'll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child.\nI see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. He passes along\nthe same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to\nthe convict?\"\n\nHere was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance of interest. A\nchild! Barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy. It was\non his track, and not upon the convict's, that Frankland had stumbled.\nIf I could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But\nincredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.\n\n\"I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of\nthe moorland shepherds taking out his father's dinner.\"\n\nThe least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat.\nHis eyes looked malignantly at me, and his gray whiskers bristled like\nthose of an angry cat.\n\n\"Indeed, sir!\" said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching moor. \"Do\nyou see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you see the low hill beyond\nwith the thornbush upon it? It is the stoniest part of the whole moor.\nIs that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station?\nYour suggestion, sir, is a most absurd one.\"\n\nI meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the facts. My\nsubmission pleased him and led him to further confidences.\n\n\"You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I come to an\nopinion. I have seen the boy again and again with his bundle. Every\nday, and sometimes twice a day, I have been able--but wait a moment,\nDr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is there at the present moment\nsomething moving upon that hillside?\"\n\nIt was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot\nagainst the dull green and gray.\n\n\"Come, sir, come!\" cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. \"You will see with\nyour own eyes and judge for yourself.\"\n\nThe telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood upon\nthe flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped his eye to it and gave a\ncry of satisfaction.\n\n\"Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!\"\n\nThere he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle upon his\nshoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he reached the crest I saw\nthe ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue\nsky. He looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air, as one who\ndreads pursuit. Then he vanished over the hill.\n\n\"Well! Am I right?\"\n\n\"Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.\"\n\n\"And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. But not\none word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy also, Dr.\nWatson. Not a word! You understand!\"\n\n\"Just as you wish.\"\n\n\"They have treated me shamefully--shamefully. When the facts come out in\nFrankland v. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of indignation will\nrun through the country. Nothing would induce me to help the police in\nany way. For all they cared it might have been me, instead of my effigy,\nwhich these rascals burned at the stake. Surely you are not going! You\nwill help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion!\"\n\nBut I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading him\nfrom his announced intention of walking home with me. I kept the road\nas long as his eye was on me, and then I struck off across the moor and\nmade for the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared. Everything\nwas working in my favour, and I swore that it should not be through lack\nof energy or perseverance that I should miss the chance which fortune\nhad thrown in my way.\n\nThe sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the hill, and\nthe long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one side and gray\nshadow on the other. A haze lay low upon the farthest sky-line, out of\nwhich jutted the fantastic shapes of Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the\nwide expanse there was no sound and no movement. One great gray bird, a\ngull or curlew, soared aloft in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be\nthe only living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert\nbeneath it. The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery\nand urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boy was\nnowhere to be seen. But down beneath me in a cleft of the hills there\nwas a circle of the old stone huts, and in the middle of them there\nwas one which retained sufficient roof to act as a screen against the\nweather. My heart leaped within me as I saw it. This must be the burrow\nwhere the stranger lurked. At last my foot was on the threshold of his\nhiding place--his secret was within my grasp.\n\nAs I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do when\nwith poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I satisfied myself\nthat the place had indeed been used as a habitation. A vague pathway\namong the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a\ndoor. All was silent within. The unknown might be lurking there, or\nhe might be prowling on the moor. My nerves tingled with the sense of\nadventure. Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the butt\nof my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked in. The\nplace was empty.\n\nBut there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false scent. This\nwas certainly where the man lived. Some blankets rolled in a waterproof\nlay upon that very stone slab upon which Neolithic man had once\nslumbered. The ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate. Beside it\nlay some cooking utensils and a bucket half-full of water. A litter of\nempty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time, and I\nsaw, as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and\na half-full bottle of spirits standing in the corner. In the middle of\nthe hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this stood\na small cloth bundle--the same, no doubt, which I had seen through the\ntelescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It contained a loaf of bread,\na tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved peaches. As I set it down\nagain, after having examined it, my heart leaped to see that beneath it\nthere lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it. I raised it, and this\nwas what I read, roughly scrawled in pencil: \"Dr. Watson has gone to\nCoombe Tracey.\"\n\nFor a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the\nmeaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir Henry, who was\nbeing dogged by this secret man. He had not followed me himself, but\nhe had set an agent--the boy, perhaps--upon my track, and this was his\nreport. Possibly I had taken no step since I had been upon the moor\nwhich had not been observed and reported. Always there was this feeling\nof an unseen force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and\ndelicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment\nthat one realized that one was indeed entangled in its meshes.\n\nIf there was one report there might be others, so I looked round the hut\nin search of them. There was no trace, however, of anything of the kind,\nnor could I discover any sign which might indicate the character or\nintentions of the man who lived in this singular place, save that he\nmust be of Spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of life.\nWhen I thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof I\nunderstood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept\nhim in that inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by\nchance our guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hut until\nI knew.\n\nOutside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet\nand gold. Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant\npools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There were the two towers\nof Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the\nvillage of Grimpen. Between the two, behind the hill, was the house\nof the Stapletons. All was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden\nevening light, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared none of the\npeace of Nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that\ninterview which every instant was bringing nearer. With tingling nerves\nbut a fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with\nsombre patience for the coming of its tenant.\n\nAnd then at last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink of a boot\nstriking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, coming nearer and\nnearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol in\nmy pocket, determined not to discover myself until I had an opportunity\nof seeing something of the stranger. There was a long pause which showed\nthat he had stopped. Then once more the footsteps approached and a\nshadow fell across the opening of the hut.\n\n\"It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,\" said a well-known voice. \"I\nreally think that you will be more comfortable outside than in.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 12. Death on the Moor\n\n\n\nFor a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my ears.\nThen my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight\nof responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul. That\ncold, incisive, ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the\nworld.\n\n\"Holmes!\" I cried--\"Holmes!\"\n\n\"Come out,\" said he, \"and please be careful with the revolver.\"\n\nI stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone outside,\nhis gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished\nfeatures. He was thin and worn, but clear and alert, his keen face\nbronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind. In his tweed suit and\ncloth cap he looked like any other tourist upon the moor, and he had\ncontrived, with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which was one\nof his characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen\nas perfect as if he were in Baker Street.\n\n\"I never was more glad to see anyone in my life,\" said I as I wrung him\nby the hand.\n\n\"Or more astonished, eh?\"\n\n\"Well, I must confess to it.\"\n\n\"The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had no idea that\nyou had found my occasional retreat, still less that you were inside it,\nuntil I was within twenty paces of the door.\"\n\n\"My footprint, I presume?\"\n\n\"No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your\nfootprint amid all the footprints of the world. If you seriously desire\nto deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when I see the stub\nof a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know that my friend\nWatson is in the neighbourhood. You will see it there beside the path.\nYou threw it down, no doubt, at that supreme moment when you charged\ninto the empty hut.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"I thought as much--and knowing your admirable tenacity I was convinced\nthat you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting for the\ntenant to return. So you actually thought that I was the criminal?\"\n\n\"I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.\"\n\n\"Excellent, Watson! And how did you localize me? You saw me, perhaps, on\nthe night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the\nmoon to rise behind me?\"\n\n\"Yes, I saw you then.\"\n\n\"And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?\"\n\n\"No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where to\nlook.\"\n\n\"The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not make it out\nwhen first I saw the light flashing upon the lens.\" He rose and peeped\ninto the hut. \"Ha, I see that Cartwright has brought up some supplies.\nWhat's this paper? So you have been to Coombe Tracey, have you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Well done! Our researches have evidently been running on parallel\nlines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly\nfull knowledge of the case.\"\n\n\"Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the\nresponsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my\nnerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what have\nyou been doing? I thought that you were in Baker Street working out that\ncase of blackmailing.\"\n\n\"That was what I wished you to think.\"\n\n\"Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!\" I cried with some\nbitterness. \"I think that I have deserved better at your hands, Holmes.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other\ncases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play a\ntrick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your own sake that I did it,\nand it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to\ncome down and examine the matter for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry\nand you it is confident that my point of view would have been the\nsame as yours, and my presence would have warned our very formidable\nopponents to be on their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about\nas I could not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and\nI remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all my\nweight at a critical moment.\"\n\n\"But why keep me in the dark?\"\n\n\"For you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have led\nto my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something, or in your\nkindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other, and so an\nunnecessary risk would be run. I brought Cartwright down with me--you\nremember the little chap at the express office--and he has seen after\nmy simple wants: a loaf of bread and a clean collar. What does man want\nmore? He has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of\nfeet, and both have been invaluable.\"\n\n\"Then my reports have all been wasted!\"--My voice trembled as I recalled\nthe pains and the pride with which I had composed them.\n\nHolmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.\n\n\"Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I assure\nyou. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only delayed one day\nupon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and\nthe intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult\ncase.\"\n\nI was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon\nme, but the warmth of Holmes's praise drove my anger from my mind. I\nfelt also in my heart that he was right in what he said and that it was\nreally best for our purpose that I should not have known that he was\nupon the moor.\n\n\"That's better,\" said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face. \"And\nnow tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons--it was not\ndifficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone, for\nI am already aware that she is the one person in Coombe Tracey who might\nbe of service to us in the matter. In fact, if you had not gone today it\nis exceedingly probable that I should have gone tomorrow.\"\n\nThe sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had turned\nchill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There, sitting together\nin the twilight, I told Holmes of my conversation with the lady. So\ninterested was he that I had to repeat some of it twice before he was\nsatisfied.\n\n\"This is most important,\" said he when I had concluded. \"It fills up a\ngap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair. You\nare aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists between this lady and\nthe man Stapleton?\"\n\n\"I did not know of a close intimacy.\"\n\n\"There can be no doubt about the matter. They meet, they write, there\nis a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a very powerful\nweapon into our hands. If I could only use it to detach his wife--\"\n\n\"His wife?\"\n\n\"I am giving you some information now, in return for all that you have\ngiven me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is in reality\nhis wife.\"\n\n\"Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How could he have\npermitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?\"\n\n\"Sir Henry's falling in love could do no harm to anyone except Sir\nHenry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love to her,\nas you have yourself observed. I repeat that the lady is his wife and\nnot his sister.\"\n\n\"But why this elaborate deception?\"\n\n\"Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in\nthe character of a free woman.\"\n\nAll my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took shape and\ncentred upon the naturalist. In that impassive colourless man, with his\nstraw hat and his butterfly-net, I seemed to see something terrible--a\ncreature of infinite patience and craft, with a smiling face and a\nmurderous heart.\n\n\"It is he, then, who is our enemy--it is he who dogged us in London?\"\n\n\"So I read the riddle.\"\n\n\"And the warning--it must have come from her!\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\nThe shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed, loomed\nthrough the darkness which had girt me so long.\n\n\"But are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you know that the woman is his\nwife?\"\n\n\"Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of\nautobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare say\nhe has many a time regretted it since. He was once a schoolmaster in\nthe north of England. Now, there is no one more easy to trace than a\nschoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies by which one may identify\nany man who has been in the profession. A little investigation showed me\nthat a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances, and that\nthe man who had owned it--the name was different--had disappeared with\nhis wife. The descriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man\nwas devoted to entomology the identification was complete.\"\n\nThe darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the shadows.\n\n\"If this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons come\nin?\" I asked.\n\n\"That is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a\nlight. Your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very\nmuch. I did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her\nhusband. In that case, regarding Stapleton as an unmarried man, she\ncounted no doubt upon becoming his wife.\"\n\n\"And when she is undeceived?\"\n\n\"Why, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our first duty\nto see her--both of us--tomorrow. Don't you think, Watson, that you are\naway from your charge rather long? Your place should be at Baskerville\nHall.\"\n\nThe last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled\nupon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky.\n\n\"One last question, Holmes,\" I said as I rose. \"Surely there is no need\nof secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it all? What is he\nafter?\"\n\nHolmes's voice sank as he answered:\n\n\"It is murder, Watson--refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder. Do not\nask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even as his are\nupon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already almost at my mercy.\nThere is but one danger which can threaten us. It is that he should\nstrike before we are ready to do so. Another day--two at the most--and\nI have my case complete, but until then guard your charge as closely\nas ever a fond mother watched her ailing child. Your mission today has\njustified itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his\nside. Hark!\"\n\nA terrible scream--a prolonged yell of horror and anguish--burst out of\nthe silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the blood to ice in\nmy veins.\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" I gasped. \"What is it? What does it mean?\"\n\nHolmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline at\nthe door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward,\nhis face peering into the darkness.\n\n\"Hush!\" he whispered. \"Hush!\"\n\nThe cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out\nfrom somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon our ears,\nnearer, louder, more urgent than before.\n\n\"Where is it?\" Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his voice\nthat he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul. \"Where is it, Watson?\"\n\n\"There, I think.\" I pointed into the darkness.\n\n\"No, there!\"\n\nAgain the agonized cry swept through the silent night, louder and much\nnearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep, muttered\nrumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like the low,\nconstant murmur of the sea.\n\n\"The hound!\" cried Holmes. \"Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if we are\ntoo late!\"\n\nHe had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed at his\nheels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in\nfront of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy\nthud. We halted and listened. Not another sound broke the heavy silence\nof the windless night.\n\nI saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted. He\nstamped his feet upon the ground.\n\n\"He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.\"\n\n\"No, no, surely not!\"\n\n\"Fool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes of\nabandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst has happened we'll\navenge him!\"\n\nBlindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders, forcing\nour way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down slopes,\nheading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come.\nAt every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him, but the shadows were\nthick upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its dreary face.\n\n\"Can you see anything?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"But, hark, what is that?\"\n\nA low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our left!\nOn that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked\na stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was spread-eagled some dark,\nirregular object. As we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into\na definite shape. It was a prostrate man face downward upon the ground,\nthe head doubled under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded\nand the body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault.\nSo grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant realize\nthat that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a whisper, not a\nrustle, rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped. Holmes laid\nhis hand upon him and held it up again with an exclamation of horror.\nThe gleam of the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers\nand upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull\nof the victim. And it shone upon something else which turned our hearts\nsick and faint within us--the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!\n\nThere was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed\nsuit--the very one which he had worn on the first morning that we had\nseen him in Baker Street. We caught the one clear glimpse of it, and\nthen the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had gone out\nof our souls. Holmes groaned, and his face glimmered white through the\ndarkness.\n\n\"The brute! The brute!\" I cried with clenched hands. \"Oh Holmes, I shall\nnever forgive myself for having left him to his fate.\"\n\n\"I am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my case well\nrounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my client. It is\nthe greatest blow which has befallen me in my career. But how could I\nknow--how could I know--that he would risk his life alone upon the moor\nin the face of all my warnings?\"\n\n\"That we should have heard his screams--my God, those screams!--and yet\nhave been unable to save him! Where is this brute of a hound which drove\nhim to his death? It may be lurking among these rocks at this instant.\nAnd Stapleton, where is he? He shall answer for this deed.\"\n\n\"He shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been murdered--the\none frightened to death by the very sight of a beast which he thought\nto be supernatural, the other driven to his end in his wild flight to\nescape from it. But now we have to prove the connection between the\nman and the beast. Save from what we heard, we cannot even swear to the\nexistence of the latter, since Sir Henry has evidently died from the\nfall. But, by heavens, cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power\nbefore another day is past!\"\n\nWe stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body,\noverwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought\nall our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Then as the moon\nrose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had\nfallen, and from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor, half\nsilver and half gloom. Far away, miles off, in the direction of Grimpen,\na single steady yellow light was shining. It could only come from the\nlonely abode of the Stapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at\nit as I gazed.\n\n\"Why should we not seize him at once?\"\n\n\"Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the last\ndegree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we make one\nfalse move the villain may escape us yet.\"\n\n\"What can we do?\"\n\n\"There will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. Tonight we can only perform\nthe last offices to our poor friend.\"\n\nTogether we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the\nbody, black and clear against the silvered stones. The agony of those\ncontorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with\ntears.\n\n\"We must send for help, Holmes! We cannot carry him all the way to the\nHall. Good heavens, are you mad?\"\n\nHe had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing and\nlaughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern, self-contained\nfriend? These were hidden fires, indeed!\n\n\"A beard! A beard! The man has a beard!\"\n\n\"A beard?\"\n\n\"It is not the baronet--it is--why, it is my neighbour, the convict!\"\n\nWith feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that dripping beard\nwas pointing up to the cold, clear moon. There could be no doubt about\nthe beetling forehead, the sunken animal eyes. It was indeed the same\nface which had glared upon me in the light of the candle from over the\nrock--the face of Selden, the criminal.\n\nThen in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how the baronet\nhad told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to Barrymore. Barrymore\nhad passed it on in order to help Selden in his escape. Boots, shirt,\ncap--it was all Sir Henry's. The tragedy was still black enough, but\nthis man had at least deserved death by the laws of his country. I told\nHolmes how the matter stood, my heart bubbling over with thankfulness\nand joy.\n\n\"Then the clothes have been the poor devil's death,\" said he. \"It is\nclear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of\nSir Henry's--the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all\nprobability--and so ran this man down. There is one very singular thing,\nhowever: How came Selden, in the darkness, to know that the hound was on\nhis trail?\"\n\n\"He heard him.\"\n\n\"To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this\nconvict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture\nby screaming wildly for help. By his cries he must have run a long way\nafter he knew the animal was on his track. How did he know?\"\n\n\"A greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all our\nconjectures are correct--\"\n\n\"I presume nothing.\"\n\n\"Well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose that it\ndoes not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would not let it go\nunless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would be there.\"\n\n\"My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think that we\nshall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain\nforever a mystery. The question now is, what shall we do with this poor\nwretch's body? We cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens.\"\n\n\"I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate\nwith the police.\"\n\n\"Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far. Halloa,\nWatson, what's this? It's the man himself, by all that's wonderful and\naudacious! Not a word to show your suspicions--not a word, or my plans\ncrumble to the ground.\"\n\nA figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red glow\nof a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish the dapper\nshape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped when he saw us, and\nthen came on again.\n\n\"Why, Dr. Watson, that's not you, is it? You are the last man that I\nshould have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night. But,\ndear me, what's this? Somebody hurt? Not--don't tell me that it is our\nfriend Sir Henry!\" He hurried past me and stooped over the dead man. I\nheard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers.\n\n\"Who--who's this?\" he stammered.\n\n\"It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.\"\n\nStapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort he had\novercome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked sharply from\nHolmes to me. \"Dear me! What a very shocking affair! How did he die?\"\n\n\"He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks. My\nfriend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.\"\n\n\"I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy about\nSir Henry.\"\n\n\"Why about Sir Henry in particular?\" I could not help asking.\n\n\"Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did not come\nI was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his safety when I\nheard cries upon the moor. By the way\"--his eyes darted again from my\nface to Holmes's--\"did you hear anything else besides a cry?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Holmes; \"did you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom\nhound, and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor. I was\nwondering if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight.\"\n\n\"We heard nothing of the kind,\" said I.\n\n\"And what is your theory of this poor fellow's death?\"\n\n\"I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head.\nHe has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over\nhere and broken his neck.\"\n\n\"That seems the most reasonable theory,\" said Stapleton, and he gave a\nsigh which I took to indicate his relief. \"What do you think about it,\nMr. Sherlock Holmes?\"\n\nMy friend bowed his compliments. \"You are quick at identification,\" said\nhe.\n\n\"We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came down.\nYou are in time to see a tragedy.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend's explanation will cover\nthe facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to London with me\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"Oh, you return tomorrow?\"\n\n\"That is my intention.\"\n\n\"I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have\npuzzled us?\"\n\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An investigator\nneeds facts and not legends or rumours. It has not been a satisfactory\ncase.\"\n\nMy friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner. Stapleton\nstill looked hard at him. Then he turned to me.\n\n\"I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it would\ngive my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it.\nI think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until\nmorning.\"\n\nAnd so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton's offer of hospitality,\nHolmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist to\nreturn alone. Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the\nbroad moor, and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope\nwhich showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his\nend.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 13. Fixing the Nets\n\n\n\n\"We're at close grips at last,\" said Holmes as we walked together across\nthe moor. \"What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled himself together\nin the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that\nthe wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot. I told you in London,\nWatson, and I tell you now again, that we have never had a foeman more\nworthy of our steel.\"\n\n\"I am sorry that he has seen you.\"\n\n\"And so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.\"\n\n\"What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows\nyou are here?\"\n\n\"It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to desperate\nmeasures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may be too confident in\nhis own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us.\"\n\n\"Why should we not arrest him at once?\"\n\n\"My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your instinct is\nalways to do something energetic. But supposing, for argument's sake,\nthat we had him arrested tonight, what on earth the better off should\nwe be for that? We could prove nothing against him. There's the devilish\ncunning of it! If he were acting through a human agent we could get some\nevidence, but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it\nwould not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.\"\n\n\"Surely we have a case.\"\n\n\"Not a shadow of one--only surmise and conjecture. We should be laughed\nout of court if we came with such a story and such evidence.\"\n\n\"There is Sir Charles's death.\"\n\n\"Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died of\nsheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how are we to\nget twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are there of a hound?\nWhere are the marks of its fangs? Of course we know that a hound does\nnot bite a dead body and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the\nbrute overtook him. But we have to prove all this, and we are not in a\nposition to do it.\"\n\n\"Well, then, tonight?\"\n\n\"We are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct\nconnection between the hound and the man's death. We never saw the\nhound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it was running upon this\nman's trail. There is a complete absence of motive. No, my dear fellow;\nwe must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present,\nand that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish\none.\"\n\n\"And how do you propose to do so?\"\n\n\"I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when the\nposition of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own plan as\nwell. Sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I hope before the\nday is past to have the upper hand at last.\"\n\nI could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in thought,\nas far as the Baskerville gates.\n\n\"Are you coming up?\"\n\n\"Yes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word,\nWatson. Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him think that\nSelden's death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He will have a\nbetter nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow,\nwhen he is engaged, if I remember your report aright, to dine with these\npeople.\"\n\n\"And so am I.\"\n\n\"Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be easily\narranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think that we are\nboth ready for our suppers.\"\n\nSir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes, for he\nhad for some days been expecting that recent events would bring him down\nfrom London. He did raise his eyebrows, however, when he found that my\nfriend had neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence.\nBetween us we soon supplied his wants, and then over a belated supper\nwe explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed\ndesirable that he should know. But first I had the unpleasant duty of\nbreaking the news to Barrymore and his wife. To him it may have been an\nunmitigated relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. To all the world\nhe was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her he\nalways remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, the child who\nhad clung to her hand. Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to\nmourn him.\n\n\"I've been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in the\nmorning,\" said the baronet. \"I guess I should have some credit, for I\nhave kept my promise. If I hadn't sworn not to go about alone I might\nhave had a more lively evening, for I had a message from Stapleton\nasking me over there.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,\" said\nHolmes drily. \"By the way, I don't suppose you appreciate that we have\nbeen mourning over you as having broken your neck?\"\n\nSir Henry opened his eyes. \"How was that?\"\n\n\"This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your servant who\ngave them to him may get into trouble with the police.\"\n\n\"That is unlikely. There was no mark on any of them, as far as I know.\"\n\n\"That's lucky for him--in fact, it's lucky for all of you, since you are\nall on the wrong side of the law in this matter. I am not sure that as\na conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole\nhousehold. Watson's reports are most incriminating documents.\"\n\n\"But how about the case?\" asked the baronet. \"Have you made anything out\nof the tangle? I don't know that Watson and I are much the wiser since\nwe came down.\"\n\n\"I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation rather more\nclear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly difficult and most\ncomplicated business. There are several points upon which we still want\nlight--but it is coming all the same.\"\n\n\"We've had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We heard the\nhound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all empty superstition.\nI had something to do with dogs when I was out West, and I know one when\nI hear one. If you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain I'll be\nready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time.\"\n\n\"I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me\nyour help.\"\n\n\"Whatever you tell me to do I will do.\"\n\n\"Very good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without always\nasking the reason.\"\n\n\"Just as you like.\"\n\n\"If you will do this I think the chances are that our little problem\nwill soon be solved. I have no doubt--\"\n\nHe stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the air. The\nlamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so still that it might\nhave been that of a clear-cut classical statue, a personification of\nalertness and expectation.\n\n\"What is it?\" we both cried.\n\nI could see as he looked down that he was repressing some internal\nemotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes shone with\namused exultation.\n\n\"Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur,\" said he as he waved his hand\ntowards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall. \"Watson\nwon't allow that I know anything of art but that is mere jealousy\nbecause our views upon the subject differ. Now, these are a really very\nfine series of portraits.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad to hear you say so,\" said Sir Henry, glancing with some\nsurprise at my friend. \"I don't pretend to know much about these things,\nand I'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture. I\ndidn't know that you found time for such things.\"\n\n\"I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That's a Kneller,\nI'll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and the stout\ngentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are all family\nportraits, I presume?\"\n\n\"Every one.\"\n\n\"Do you know the names?\"\n\n\"Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my\nlessons fairly well.\"\n\n\"Who is the gentleman with the telescope?\"\n\n\"That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the West\nIndies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William\nBaskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons\nunder Pitt.\"\n\n\"And this Cavalier opposite to me--the one with the black velvet and the\nlace?\"\n\n\"Ah, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of all the\nmischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the Baskervilles.\nWe're not likely to forget him.\"\n\nI gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Holmes, \"he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man enough, but\nI dare say that there was a lurking devil in his eyes. I had pictured\nhim as a more robust and ruffianly person.\"\n\n\"There's no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the date,\n1647, are on the back of the canvas.\"\n\nHolmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to\nhave a fascination for him, and his eyes were continually fixed upon it\nduring supper. It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone to his\nroom, that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts. He led me\nback into the banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he\nheld it up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.\n\n\"Do you see anything there?\"\n\nI looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the white lace\ncollar, and the straight, severe face which was framed between them. It\nwas not a brutal countenance, but it was prim, hard, and stern, with a\nfirm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly intolerant eye.\n\n\"Is it like anyone you know?\"\n\n\"There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.\"\n\n\"Just a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!\" He stood upon a\nchair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved his right\narm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" I cried in amazement.\n\nThe face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.\n\n\"Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine faces and not\ntheir trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal investigator that\nhe should see through a disguise.\"\n\n\"But this is marvellous. It might be his portrait.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears to be\nboth physical and spiritual. A study of family portraits is enough\nto convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. The fellow is a\nBaskerville--that is evident.\"\n\n\"With designs upon the succession.\"\n\n\"Exactly. This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our\nmost obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we have him, and I dare\nswear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering in our net as\nhelpless as one of his own butterflies. A pin, a cork, and a card, and\nwe add him to the Baker Street collection!\" He burst into one of his\nrare fits of laughter as he turned away from the picture. I have not\nheard him laugh often, and it has always boded ill to somebody.\n\nI was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier still, for\nI saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.\n\n\"Yes, we should have a full day today,\" he remarked, and he rubbed his\nhands with the joy of action. \"The nets are all in place, and the drag\nis about to begin. We'll know before the day is out whether we have\ncaught our big, leanjawed pike, or whether he has got through the\nmeshes.\"\n\n\"Have you been on the moor already?\"\n\n\"I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death of\nSelden. I think I can promise that none of you will be troubled in the\nmatter. And I have also communicated with my faithful Cartwright, who\nwould certainly have pined away at the door of my hut, as a dog does at\nhis master's grave, if I had not set his mind at rest about my safety.\"\n\n\"What is the next move?\"\n\n\"To see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!\"\n\n\"Good-morning, Holmes,\" said the baronet. \"You look like a general who\nis planning a battle with his chief of the staff.\"\n\n\"That is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders.\"\n\n\"And so do I.\"\n\n\"Very good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our friends\nthe Stapletons tonight.\"\n\n\"I hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people, and I\nam sure that they would be very glad to see you.\"\n\n\"I fear that Watson and I must go to London.\"\n\n\"To London?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present\njuncture.\"\n\nThe baronet's face perceptibly lengthened.\n\n\"I hoped that you were going to see me through this business. The Hall\nand the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what I tell\nyou. You can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have\ncome with you, but that urgent business required us to be in town. We\nhope very soon to return to Devonshire. Will you remember to give them\nthat message?\"\n\n\"If you insist upon it.\"\n\n\"There is no alternative, I assure you.\"\n\nI saw by the baronet's clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he\nregarded as our desertion.\n\n\"When do you desire to go?\" he asked coldly.\n\n\"Immediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey, but\nWatson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you.\nWatson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell him that you regret\nthat you cannot come.\"\n\n\"I have a good mind to go to London with you,\" said the baronet. \"Why\nshould I stay here alone?\"\n\n\"Because it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word that you\nwould do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.\"\n\n\"All right, then, I'll stay.\"\n\n\"One more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send back\nyour trap, however, and let them know that you intend to walk home.\"\n\n\"To walk across the moor?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to\ndo.\"\n\n\"This time you may do it with safety. If I had not every confidence in\nyour nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but it is essential that\nyou should do it.\"\n\n\"Then I will do it.\"\n\n\"And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction\nsave along the straight path which leads from Merripit House to the\nGrimpen Road, and is your natural way home.\"\n\n\"I will do just what you say.\"\n\n\"Very good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as\npossible, so as to reach London in the afternoon.\"\n\nI was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that Holmes\nhad said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate\nnext day. It had not crossed my mind however, that he would wish me to\ngo with him, nor could I understand how we could both be absent at a\nmoment which he himself declared to be critical. There was nothing for\nit, however, but implicit obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful\nfriend, and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of\nCoombe Tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A\nsmall boy was waiting upon the platform.\n\n\"Any orders, sir?\"\n\n\"You will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment you arrive you\nwill send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name, to say that if he\nfinds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is to send it by registered\npost to Baker Street.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And ask at the station office if there is a message for me.\"\n\nThe boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. It ran:\n\nWire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive five-forty.\nLestrade.\n\n\"That is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the\nprofessionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now, Watson, I\nthink that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your\nacquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.\"\n\nHis plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would use the\nbaronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were really gone,\nwhile we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to\nbe needed. That telegram from London, if mentioned by Sir Henry to the\nStapletons, must remove the last suspicions from their minds. Already I\nseemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike.\n\nMrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened his\ninterview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her.\n\n\"I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the\nlate Sir Charles Baskerville,\" said he. \"My friend here, Dr. Watson,\nhas informed me of what you have communicated, and also of what you have\nwithheld in connection with that matter.\"\n\n\"What have I withheld?\" she asked defiantly.\n\n\"You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate at ten\no'clock. We know that that was the place and hour of his death. You have\nwithheld what the connection is between these events.\"\n\n\"There is no connection.\"\n\n\"In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one. But\nI think that we shall succeed in establishing a connection, after all. I\nwish to be perfectly frank with you, Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as\none of murder, and the evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr.\nStapleton but his wife as well.\"\n\nThe lady sprang from her chair.\n\n\"His wife!\" she cried.\n\n\"The fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed for his\nsister is really his wife.\"\n\nMrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms of her\nchair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure\nof her grip.\n\n\"His wife!\" she said again. \"His wife! He is not a married man.\"\n\nSherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so--!\"\n\nThe fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.\n\n\"I have come prepared to do so,\" said Holmes, drawing several papers\nfrom his pocket. \"Here is a photograph of the couple taken in York four\nyears ago. It is indorsed 'Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,' but you will have no\ndifficulty in recognizing him, and her also, if you know her by sight.\nHere are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and\nMrs. Vandeleur, who at that time kept St. Oliver's private school. Read\nthem and see if you can doubt the identity of these people.\"\n\nShe glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigid face\nof a desperate woman.\n\n\"Mr. Holmes,\" she said, \"this man had offered me marriage on condition\nthat I could get a divorce from my husband. He has lied to me, the\nvillain, in every conceivable way. Not one word of truth has he ever\ntold me. And why--why? I imagined that all was for my own sake. But now\nI see that I was never anything but a tool in his hands. Why should I\npreserve faith with him who never kept any with me? Why should I try to\nshield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me what you\nlike, and there is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing I swear\nto you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of any\nharm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.\"\n\n\"I entirely believe you, madam,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"The recital of\nthese events must be very painful to you, and perhaps it will make it\neasier if I tell you what occurred, and you can check me if I make any\nmaterial mistake. The sending of this letter was suggested to you by\nStapleton?\"\n\n\"He dictated it.\"\n\n\"I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from\nSir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping\nthe appointment?\"\n\n\"He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other man\nshould find the money for such an object, and that though he was a poor\nman himself he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles\nwhich divided us.\"\n\n\"He appears to be a very consistent character. And then you heard\nnothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with Sir\nCharles?\"\n\n\"He did. He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and that I\nshould certainly be suspected if the facts came out. He frightened me\ninto remaining silent.\"\n\n\"Quite so. But you had your suspicions?\"\n\nShe hesitated and looked down.\n\n\"I knew him,\" she said. \"But if he had kept faith with me I should\nalways have done so with him.\"\n\n\"I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,\" said\nSherlock Holmes. \"You have had him in your power and he knew it, and yet\nyou are alive. You have been walking for some months very near to the\nedge of a precipice. We must wish you good-morning now, Mrs. Lyons, and\nit is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again.\"\n\n\"Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins\naway in front of us,\" said Holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival of\nthe express from town. \"I shall soon be in the position of being able\nto put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular\nand sensational crimes of modern times. Students of criminology will\nremember the analogous incidents in Godno, in Little Russia, in the year\n'66, and of course there are the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but\nthis case possesses some features which are entirely its own. Even now\nwe have no clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very\nmuch surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this\nnight.\"\n\nThe London express came roaring into the station, and a small, wiry\nbulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. We all three\nshook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way in which\nLestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since\nthe days when they had first worked together. I could well remember\nthe scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the\npractical man.\n\n\"Anything good?\" he asked.\n\n\"The biggest thing for years,\" said Holmes. \"We have two hours before\nwe need think of starting. I think we might employ it in getting some\ndinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London fog out of your\nthroat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of Dartmoor. Never\nbeen there? Ah, well, I don't suppose you will forget your first visit.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 14. The Hound of the Baskervilles\n\n\n\nOne of Sherlock Holmes's defects--if, indeed, one may call it a\ndefect--was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans\nto any other person until the instant of their fulfilment. Partly it\ncame no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and\nsurprise those who were around him. Partly also from his professional\ncaution, which urged him never to take any chances. The result, however,\nwas very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants.\nI had often suffered under it, but never more so than during that long\ndrive in the darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we\nwere about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing,\nand I could only surmise what his course of action would be. My nerves\nthrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and\nthe dark, void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we\nwere back upon the moor once again. Every stride of the horses and every\nturn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure.\n\nOur conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired\nwagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our\nnerves were tense with emotion and anticipation. It was a relief to me,\nafter that unnatural restraint, when we at last passed Frankland's\nhouse and knew that we were drawing near to the Hall and to the scene\nof action. We did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of\nthe avenue. The wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe\nTracey forthwith, while we started to walk to Merripit House.\n\n\"Are you armed, Lestrade?\"\n\nThe little detective smiled. \"As long as I have my trousers I have a\nhip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have something in it.\"\n\n\"Good! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.\"\n\n\"You're mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes. What's the game\nnow?\"\n\n\"A waiting game.\"\n\n\"My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place,\" said the detective\nwith a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and\nat the huge lake of fog which lay over the Grimpen Mire. \"I see the\nlights of a house ahead of us.\"\n\n\"That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must request you\nto walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper.\"\n\nWe moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house,\nbut Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it.\n\n\"This will do,\" said he. \"These rocks upon the right make an admirable\nscreen.\"\n\n\"We are to wait here?\"\n\n\"Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,\nLestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson? Can you\ntell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed windows at this\nend?\"\n\n\"I think they are the kitchen windows.\"\n\n\"And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?\"\n\n\"That is certainly the dining-room.\"\n\n\"The blinds are up. You know the lie of the land best. Creep forward\nquietly and see what they are doing--but for heaven's sake don't let\nthem know that they are watched!\"\n\nI tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded\nthe stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached a point whence I\ncould look straight through the uncurtained window.\n\nThere were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton. They sat\nwith their profiles towards me on either side of the round table. Both\nof them were smoking cigars, and coffee and wine were in front of them.\nStapleton was talking with animation, but the baronet looked pale and\ndistrait. Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened\nmoor was weighing heavily upon his mind.\n\nAs I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir Henry\nfilled his glass again and leaned back in his chair, puffing at his\ncigar. I heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon\ngravel. The steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall\nunder which I crouched. Looking over, I saw the naturalist pause at the\ndoor of an out-house in the corner of the orchard. A key turned in\na lock, and as he passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from\nwithin. He was only a minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn\nonce more and he passed me and reentered the house. I saw him rejoin his\nguest, and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to\ntell them what I had seen.\n\n\"You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?\" Holmes asked when I had\nfinished my report.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other room\nexcept the kitchen?\"\n\n\"I cannot think where she is.\"\n\nI have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense, white\nfog. It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like a\nwall on that side of us, low but thick and well defined. The moon shone\non it, and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field, with the heads\nof the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface. Holmes's face\nwas turned towards it, and he muttered impatiently as he watched its\nsluggish drift.\n\n\"It's moving towards us, Watson.\"\n\n\"Is that serious?\"\n\n\"Very serious, indeed--the one thing upon earth which could have\ndisarranged my plans. He can't be very long, now. It is already ten\no'clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out\nbefore the fog is over the path.\"\n\nThe night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold and bright,\nwhile a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft, uncertain light.\nBefore us lay the dark bulk of the house, its serrated roof and\nbristling chimneys hard outlined against the silver-spangled sky. Broad\nbars of golden light from the lower windows stretched across the orchard\nand the moor. One of them was suddenly shut off. The servants had left\nthe kitchen. There only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the\ntwo men, the murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted\nover their cigars.\n\nEvery minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of the moor\nwas drifting closer and closer to the house. Already the first thin\nwisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window.\nThe farther wall of the orchard was already invisible, and the trees\nwere standing out of a swirl of white vapour. As we watched it the\nfog-wreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled\nslowly into one dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof\nfloated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his hand\npassionately upon the rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his\nimpatience.\n\n\"If he isn't out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered. In\nhalf an hour we won't be able to see our hands in front of us.\"\n\n\"Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think it would be as well.\"\n\nSo as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were\nhalf a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea, with the\nmoon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on.\n\n\"We are going too far,\" said Holmes. \"We dare not take the chance of his\nbeing overtaken before he can reach us. At all costs we must hold our\nground where we are.\" He dropped on his knees and clapped his ear to the\nground. \"Thank God, I think that I hear him coming.\"\n\nA sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. Crouching among\nthe stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in front of us.\nThe steps grew louder, and through the fog, as through a curtain, there\nstepped the man whom we were awaiting. He looked round him in surprise\nas he emerged into the clear, starlit night. Then he came swiftly along\nthe path, passed close to where we lay, and went on up the long slope\nbehind us. As he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder,\nlike a man who is ill at ease.\n\n\"Hist!\" cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking pistol.\n\"Look out! It's coming!\"\n\nThere was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the heart\nof that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay,\nand we glared at it, all three, uncertain what horror was about to break\nfrom the heart of it. I was at Holmes's elbow, and I glanced for an\ninstant at his face. It was pale and exultant, his eyes shining brightly\nin the moonlight. But suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed\nstare, and his lips parted in amazement. At the same instant Lestrade\ngave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground.\nI sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind paralyzed\nby the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of\nthe fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a\nhound as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fire burst from its open mouth, its\neyes glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap\nwere outlined in flickering flame. Never in the delirious dream of\na disordered brain could anything more savage, more appalling, more\nhellish be conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke\nupon us out of the wall of fog.\n\nWith long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track,\nfollowing hard upon the footsteps of our friend. So paralyzed were we by\nthe apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered our\nnerve. Then Holmes and I both fired together, and the creature gave a\nhideous howl, which showed that one at least had hit him. He did not\npause, however, but bounded onward. Far away on the path we saw Sir\nHenry looking back, his face white in the moonlight, his hands raised in\nhorror, glaring helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him\ndown. But that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the\nwinds. If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound him we\ncould kill him. Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran that night. I\nam reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as much as I outpaced the\nlittle professional. In front of us as we flew up the track we heard\nscream after scream from Sir Henry and the deep roar of the hound. I was\nin time to see the beast spring upon its victim, hurl him to the ground,\nand worry at his throat. But the next instant Holmes had emptied five\nbarrels of his revolver into the creature's flank. With a last howl of\nagony and a vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon its back, four feet\npawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its side. I stooped, panting,\nand pressed my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head, but it was\nuseless to press the trigger. The giant hound was dead.\n\nSir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away his collar,\nand Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was\nno sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time. Already our\nfriend's eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move. Lestrade\nthrust his brandy-flask between the baronet's teeth, and two frightened\neyes were looking up at us.\n\n\"My God!\" he whispered. \"What was it? What, in heaven's name, was it?\"\n\n\"It's dead, whatever it is,\" said Holmes. \"We've laid the family ghost\nonce and forever.\"\n\nIn mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying\nstretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure\nmastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of the two--gaunt, savage,\nand as large as a small lioness. Even now in the stillness of death,\nthe huge jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame and the small,\ndeep-set, cruel eyes were ringed with fire. I placed my hand upon the\nglowing muzzle, and as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and\ngleamed in the darkness.\n\n\"Phosphorus,\" I said.\n\n\"A cunning preparation of it,\" said Holmes, sniffing at the dead animal.\n\"There is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent.\nWe owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having exposed you to this\nfright. I was prepared for a hound, but not for such a creature as this.\nAnd the fog gave us little time to receive him.\"\n\n\"You have saved my life.\"\n\n\"Having first endangered it. Are you strong enough to stand?\"\n\n\"Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for\nanything. So! Now, if you will help me up. What do you propose to do?\"\n\n\"To leave you here. You are not fit for further adventures tonight. If\nyou will wait, one or other of us will go back with you to the Hall.\"\n\nHe tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale and\ntrembling in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where he sat shivering\nwith his face buried in his hands.\n\n\"We must leave you now,\" said Holmes. \"The rest of our work must be\ndone, and every moment is of importance. We have our case, and now we\nonly want our man.\n\n\"It's a thousand to one against our finding him at the house,\" he\ncontinued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. \"Those shots\nmust have told him that the game was up.\"\n\n\"We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.\"\n\n\"He followed the hound to call him off--of that you may be certain. No,\nno, he's gone by this time! But we'll search the house and make sure.\"\n\nThe front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to\nroom to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us in the\npassage. There was no light save in the dining-room, but Holmes caught\nup the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored. No sign could we\nsee of the man whom we were chasing. On the upper floor, however, one of\nthe bedroom doors was locked.\n\n\"There's someone in here,\" cried Lestrade. \"I can hear a movement. Open\nthis door!\"\n\nA faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck the door\njust over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew open. Pistol in\nhand, we all three rushed into the room.\n\nBut there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain\nwhom we expected to see. Instead we were faced by an object so strange\nand so unexpected that we stood for a moment staring at it in amazement.\n\nThe room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls were\nlined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that collection of\nbutterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of\nthis complex and dangerous man. In the centre of this room there was an\nupright beam, which had been placed at some period as a support for the\nold worm-eaten baulk of timber which spanned the roof. To this post a\nfigure was tied, so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been\nused to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it\nwas that of a man or a woman. One towel passed round the throat and was\nsecured at the back of the pillar. Another covered the lower part of\nthe face, and over it two dark eyes--eyes full of grief and shame and a\ndreadful questioning--stared back at us. In a minute we had torn off\nthe gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs. Stapleton sank upon the floor in\nfront of us. As her beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the clear\nred weal of a whiplash across her neck.\n\n\"The brute!\" cried Holmes. \"Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle! Put her\nin the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion.\"\n\nShe opened her eyes again.\n\n\"Is he safe?\" she asked. \"Has he escaped?\"\n\n\"He cannot escape us, madam.\"\n\n\"No, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry? Is he safe?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And the hound?\"\n\n\"It is dead.\"\n\nShe gave a long sigh of satisfaction.\n\n\"Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he has treated me!\"\nShe shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw with horror that they\nwere all mottled with bruises. \"But this is nothing--nothing! It is my\nmind and soul that he has tortured and defiled. I could endure it all,\nill-usage, solitude, a life of deception, everything, as long as I could\nstill cling to the hope that I had his love, but now I know that in\nthis also I have been his dupe and his tool.\" She broke into passionate\nsobbing as she spoke.\n\n\"You bear him no good will, madam,\" said Holmes. \"Tell us then where we\nshall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now and so\natone.\"\n\n\"There is but one place where he can have fled,\" she answered. \"There is\nan old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire. It was there that\nhe kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he\nmight have a refuge. That is where he would fly.\"\n\nThe fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held the\nlamp towards it.\n\n\"See,\" said he. \"No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire\ntonight.\"\n\nShe laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed with\nfierce merriment.\n\n\"He may find his way in, but never out,\" she cried. \"How can he see the\nguiding wands tonight? We planted them together, he and I, to mark the\npathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have plucked them out\ntoday. Then indeed you would have had him at your mercy!\"\n\nIt was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had\nlifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house while\nHolmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville Hall. The story\nof the Stapletons could no longer be withheld from him, but he took\nthe blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had\nloved. But the shock of the night's adventures had shattered his nerves,\nand before morning he lay delirious in a high fever under the care of\nDr. Mortimer. The two of them were destined to travel together round the\nworld before Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he\nhad been before he became master of that ill-omened estate.\n\nAnd now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative, in\nwhich I have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague\nsurmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a\nmanner. On the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted\nand we were guided by Mrs. Stapleton to the point where they had found\na pathway through the bog. It helped us to realize the horror of this\nwoman's life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us\non her husband's track. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of\nfirm, peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. From the\nend of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path\nzigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those green-scummed pits\nand foul quagmires which barred the way to the stranger. Rank reeds and\nlush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic\nvapour onto our faces, while a false step plunged us more than once\nthigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft\nundulations around our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as\nwe walked, and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was\ntugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful was\nthe clutch in which it held us. Once only we saw a trace that someone\nhad passed that perilous way before us. From amid a tuft of cotton grass\nwhich bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting. Holmes\nsank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it, and had we\nnot been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot\nupon firm land again. He held an old black boot in the air. \"Meyers,\nToronto,\" was printed on the leather inside.\n\n\"It is worth a mud bath,\" said he. \"It is our friend Sir Henry's missing\nboot.\"\n\n\"Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight.\"\n\n\"Exactly. He retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound\nupon the track. He fled when he knew the game was up, still clutching\nit. And he hurled it away at this point of his flight. We know at least\nthat he came so far in safety.\"\n\nBut more than that we were never destined to know, though there was much\nwhich we might surmise. There was no chance of finding footsteps in the\nmire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them, but as we at last\nreached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly for them.\nBut no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes. If the earth told a\ntrue story, then Stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards\nwhich he struggled through the fog upon that last night. Somewhere in\nthe heart of the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the\nhuge morass which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is\nforever buried.\n\nMany traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had hid his\nsavage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled with rubbish\nshowed the position of an abandoned mine. Beside it were the crumbling\nremains of the cottages of the miners, driven away no doubt by the foul\nreek of the surrounding swamp. In one of these a staple and chain with\na quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined.\nA skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the\ndebris.\n\n\"A dog!\" said Holmes. \"By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor Mortimer\nwill never see his pet again. Well, I do not know that this place\ncontains any secret which we have not already fathomed. He could hide\nhis hound, but he could not hush its voice, and hence came those cries\nwhich even in daylight were not pleasant to hear. On an emergency he\ncould keep the hound in the out-house at Merripit, but it was always a\nrisk, and it was only on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end\nof all his efforts, that he dared do it. This paste in the tin is no\ndoubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed. It was\nsuggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and by the\ndesire to frighten old Sir Charles to death. No wonder the poor devil of\na convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did, and as we ourselves\nmight have done, when he saw such a creature bounding through the\ndarkness of the moor upon his track. It was a cunning device, for, apart\nfrom the chance of driving your victim to his death, what peasant would\nventure to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight\nof it, as many have done, upon the moor? I said it in London, Watson,\nand I say it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a\nmore dangerous man than he who is lying yonder\"--he swept his long arm\ntowards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which stretched\naway until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 15. A Retrospection\n\n\n\nIt was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy\nnight, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room in Baker\nStreet. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to Devonshire he had been\nengaged in two affairs of the utmost importance, in the first of which\nhe had exposed the atrocious conduct of Colonel Upwood in connection\nwith the famous card scandal of the Nonpareil Club, while in the second\nhe had defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from the charge\nof murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her\nstep-daughter, Mlle. Carere, the young lady who, as it will be\nremembered, was found six months later alive and married in New York.\nMy friend was in excellent spirits over the success which had attended\na succession of difficult and important cases, so that I was able to\ninduce him to discuss the details of the Baskerville mystery. I had\nwaited patiently for the opportunity for I was aware that he would never\npermit cases to overlap, and that his clear and logical mind would not\nbe drawn from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past. Sir\nHenry and Dr. Mortimer were, however, in London, on their way to that\nlong voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his\nshattered nerves. They had called upon us that very afternoon, so that\nit was natural that the subject should come up for discussion.\n\n\"The whole course of events,\" said Holmes, \"from the point of view of\nthe man who called himself Stapleton was simple and direct, although\nto us, who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of\nhis actions and could only learn part of the facts, it all appeared\nexceedingly complex. I have had the advantage of two conversations with\nMrs. Stapleton, and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I\nam not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us.\nYou will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my\nindexed list of cases.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from\nmemory.\"\n\n\"Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts in my\nmind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way of blotting out\nwhat has passed. The barrister who has his case at his fingers' ends and\nis able to argue with an expert upon his own subject finds that a week\nor two of the courts will drive it all out of his head once more. So\neach of my cases displaces the last, and Mlle. Carere has blurred my\nrecollection of Baskerville Hall. Tomorrow some other little problem may\nbe submitted to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair French\nlady and the infamous Upwood. So far as the case of the hound goes,\nhowever, I will give you the course of events as nearly as I can, and\nyou will suggest anything which I may have forgotten.\n\n\"My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not\nlie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. He was a son of that\nRodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir Charles, who fled with\na sinister reputation to South America, where he was said to have died\nunmarried. He did, as a matter of fact, marry, and had one child, this\nfellow, whose real name is the same as his father's. He married Beryl\nGarcia, one of the beauties of Costa Rica, and, having purloined a\nconsiderable sum of public money, he changed his name to Vandeleur and\nfled to England, where he established a school in the east of Yorkshire.\nHis reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had\nstruck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage\nhome, and that he had used this man's ability to make the undertaking a\nsuccess. Fraser, the tutor, died however, and the school which had begun\nwell sank from disrepute into infamy. The Vandeleurs found it convenient\nto change their name to Stapleton, and he brought the remains of his\nfortune, his schemes for the future, and his taste for entomology to\nthe south of England. I learned at the British Museum that he was a\nrecognized authority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur\nhas been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, in his\nYorkshire days, been the first to describe.\n\n\"We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be of such\nintense interest to us. The fellow had evidently made inquiry and found\nthat only two lives intervened between him and a valuable estate. When\nhe went to Devonshire his plans were, I believe, exceedingly hazy, but\nthat he meant mischief from the first is evident from the way in which\nhe took his wife with him in the character of his sister. The idea of\nusing her as a decoy was clearly already in his mind, though he may not\nhave been certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged. He\nmeant in the end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any tool\nor run any risk for that end. His first act was to establish himself as\nnear to his ancestral home as he could, and his second was to cultivate\na friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and with the neighbours.\n\n\"The baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so prepared\nthe way for his own death. Stapleton, as I will continue to call him,\nknew that the old man's heart was weak and that a shock would kill him.\nSo much he had learned from Dr. Mortimer. He had heard also that Sir\nCharles was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously.\nHis ingenious mind instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could\nbe done to death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the\nguilt to the real murderer.\n\n\"Having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with\nconsiderable finesse. An ordinary schemer would have been content\nto work with a savage hound. The use of artificial means to make the\ncreature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part. The dog he\nbought in London from Ross and Mangles, the dealers in Fulham Road. It\nwas the strongest and most savage in their possession. He brought it\ndown by the North Devon line and walked a great distance over the moor\nso as to get it home without exciting any remarks. He had already on his\ninsect hunts learned to penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a\nsafe hiding-place for the creature. Here he kennelled it and waited his\nchance.\n\n\"But it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not be decoyed\noutside of his grounds at night. Several times Stapleton lurked about\nwith his hound, but without avail. It was during these fruitless quests\nthat he, or rather his ally, was seen by peasants, and that the legend\nof the demon dog received a new confirmation. He had hoped that his wife\nmight lure Sir Charles to his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly\nindependent. She would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in\na sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy.\nThreats and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her. She\nwould have nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton was at a\ndeadlock.\n\n\"He found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that Sir\nCharles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made him the minister\nof his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman, Mrs. Laura Lyons.\nBy representing himself as a single man he acquired complete influence\nover her, and he gave her to understand that in the event of her\nobtaining a divorce from her husband he would marry her. His plans were\nsuddenly brought to a head by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about\nto leave the Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he\nhimself pretended to coincide. He must act at once, or his victim might\nget beyond his power. He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons to\nwrite this letter, imploring the old man to give her an interview on\nthe evening before his departure for London. He then, by a specious\nargument, prevented her from going, and so had the chance for which he\nhad waited.\n\n\"Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time to get\nhis hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bring the beast\nround to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find\nthe old gentleman waiting. The dog, incited by its master, sprang over\nthe wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate baronet, who fled screaming\ndown the yew alley. In that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a\ndreadful sight to see that huge black creature, with its flaming jaws\nand blazing eyes, bounding after its victim. He fell dead at the end\nof the alley from heart disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the\ngrassy border while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track\nbut the man's was visible. On seeing him lying still the creature had\nprobably approached to sniff at him, but finding him dead had turned\naway again. It was then that it left the print which was actually\nobserved by Dr. Mortimer. The hound was called off and hurried away to\nits lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was left which puzzled\nthe authorities, alarmed the countryside, and finally brought the case\nwithin the scope of our observation.\n\n\"So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. You perceive the\ndevilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost impossible to make\na case against the real murderer. His only accomplice was one who could\nnever give him away, and the grotesque, inconceivable nature of\nthe device only served to make it more effective. Both of the women\nconcerned in the case, Mrs. Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left\nwith a strong suspicion against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he\nhad designs upon the old man, and also of the existence of the hound.\nMrs. Lyons knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the\ndeath occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only\nknown to him. However, both of them were under his influence, and he had\nnothing to fear from them. The first half of his task was successfully\naccomplished but the more difficult still remained.\n\n\"It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir\nin Canada. In any case he would very soon learn it from his friend Dr.\nMortimer, and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of\nHenry Baskerville. Stapleton's first idea was that this young stranger\nfrom Canada might possibly be done to death in London without coming\ndown to Devonshire at all. He distrusted his wife ever since she had\nrefused to help him in laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not\nleave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence\nover her. It was for this reason that he took her to London with him.\nThey lodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven Street,\nwhich was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search\nof evidence. Here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while\nhe, disguised in a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer to Baker Street and\nafterwards to the station and to the Northumberland Hotel. His wife had\nsome inkling of his plans; but she had such a fear of her husband--a\nfear founded upon brutal ill-treatment--that she dare not write to warn\nthe man whom she knew to be in danger. If the letter should fall into\nStapleton's hands her own life would not be safe. Eventually, as we\nknow, she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would\nform the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand. It\nreached the baronet, and gave him the first warning of his danger.\n\n\"It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir Henry's\nattire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he might always\nhave the means of setting him upon his track. With characteristic\npromptness and audacity he set about this at once, and we cannot doubt\nthat the boots or chamber-maid of the hotel was well bribed to help him\nin his design. By chance, however, the first boot which was procured for\nhim was a new one and, therefore, useless for his purpose. He then had\nit returned and obtained another--a most instructive incident, since it\nproved conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound,\nas no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old\nboot and this indifference to a new one. The more outre and grotesque an\nincident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined, and the very\npoint which appears to complicate a case is, when duly considered and\nscientifically handled, the one which is most likely to elucidate it.\n\n\"Then we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowed always\nby Stapleton in the cab. From his knowledge of our rooms and of my\nappearance, as well as from his general conduct, I am inclined to think\nthat Stapleton's career of crime has been by no means limited to this\nsingle Baskerville affair. It is suggestive that during the last three\nyears there have been four considerable burglaries in the west country,\nfor none of which was any criminal ever arrested. The last of these, at\nFolkestone Court, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling\nof the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. I cannot\ndoubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in this fashion, and\nthat for years he has been a desperate and dangerous man.\n\n\"We had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he got\naway from us so successfully, and also of his audacity in sending back\nmy own name to me through the cabman. From that moment he understood\nthat I had taken over the case in London, and that therefore there was\nno chance for him there. He returned to Dartmoor and awaited the arrival\nof the baronet.\"\n\n\"One moment!\" said I. \"You have, no doubt, described the sequence\nof events correctly, but there is one point which you have left\nunexplained. What became of the hound when its master was in London?\"\n\n\"I have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly of\nimportance. There can be no question that Stapleton had a confidant,\nthough it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by\nsharing all his plans with him. There was an old manservant at Merripit\nHouse, whose name was Anthony. His connection with the Stapletons can\nbe traced for several years, as far back as the school-mastering days,\nso that he must have been aware that his master and mistress were really\nhusband and wife. This man has disappeared and has escaped from the\ncountry. It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England,\nwhile Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American countries. The\nman, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but with a curious\nlisping accent. I have myself seen this old man cross the Grimpen\nMire by the path which Stapleton had marked out. It is very probable,\ntherefore, that in the absence of his master it was he who cared for the\nhound, though he may never have known the purpose for which the beast\nwas used.\n\n\"The Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they were soon\nfollowed by Sir Henry and you. One word now as to how I stood myself at\nthat time. It may possibly recur to your memory that when I examined\nthe paper upon which the printed words were fastened I made a close\ninspection for the water-mark. In doing so I held it within a few inches\nof my eyes, and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as\nwhite jessamine. There are seventy-five perfumes, which it is very\nnecessary that a criminal expert should be able to distinguish from each\nother, and cases have more than once within my own experience depended\nupon their prompt recognition. The scent suggested the presence of a\nlady, and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons. Thus\nI had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the criminal before\never we went to the west country.\n\n\"It was my game to watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, that I\ncould not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly on his\nguard. I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included, and I came\ndown secretly when I was supposed to be in London. My hardships were\nnot so great as you imagined, though such trifling details must never\ninterfere with the investigation of a case. I stayed for the most\npart at Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut upon the moor when it was\nnecessary to be near the scene of action. Cartwright had come down with\nme, and in his disguise as a country boy he was of great assistance\nto me. I was dependent upon him for food and clean linen. When I was\nwatching Stapleton, Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I\nwas able to keep my hand upon all the strings.\n\n\"I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly, being\nforwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey. They were of\ngreat service to me, and especially that one incidentally truthful piece\nof biography of Stapleton's. I was able to establish the identity of\nthe man and the woman and knew at last exactly how I stood. The case\nhad been considerably complicated through the incident of the escaped\nconvict and the relations between him and the Barrymores. This also you\ncleared up in a very effective way, though I had already come to the\nsame conclusions from my own observations.\n\n\"By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a complete\nknowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case which could go to\na jury. Even Stapleton's attempt upon Sir Henry that night which ended\nin the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving\nmurder against our man. There seemed to be no alternative but to\ncatch him red-handed, and to do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and\napparently unprotected, as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a\nsevere shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and\ndriving Stapleton to his destruction. That Sir Henry should have been\nexposed to this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the\ncase, but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing\nspectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog which\nenabled him to burst upon us at such short notice. We succeeded in our\nobject at a cost which both the specialist and Dr. Mortimer assure me\nwill be a temporary one. A long journey may enable our friend to recover\nnot only from his shattered nerves but also from his wounded feelings.\nHis love for the lady was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part\nof all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her.\n\n\"It only remains to indicate the part which she had played throughout.\nThere can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an influence over her\nwhich may have been love or may have been fear, or very possibly both,\nsince they are by no means incompatible emotions. It was, at least,\nabsolutely effective. At his command she consented to pass as his\nsister, though he found the limits of his power over her when he\nendeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder. She was ready to\nwarn Sir Henry so far as she could without implicating her husband, and\nagain and again she tried to do so. Stapleton himself seems to have been\ncapable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying court to the\nlady, even though it was part of his own plan, still he could not help\ninterrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul\nwhich his self-contained manner so cleverly concealed. By encouraging\nthe intimacy he made it certain that Sir Henry would frequently come\nto Merripit House and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity\nwhich he desired. On the day of the crisis, however, his wife turned\nsuddenly against him. She had learned something of the death of the\nconvict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the outhouse on\nthe evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner. She taxed her husband\nwith his intended crime, and a furious scene followed in which he showed\nher for the first time that she had a rival in his love. Her fidelity\nturned in an instant to bitter hatred, and he saw that she would betray\nhim. He tied her up, therefore, that she might have no chance of warning\nSir Henry, and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put\ndown the baronet's death to the curse of his family, as they certainly\nwould do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished fact and\nto keep silent upon what she knew. In this I fancy that in any case\nhe made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not been there, his doom\nwould none the less have been sealed. A woman of Spanish blood does\nnot condone such an injury so lightly. And now, my dear Watson, without\nreferring to my notes, I cannot give you a more detailed account of\nthis curious case. I do not know that anything essential has been left\nunexplained.\"\n\n\"He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had done the old\nuncle with his bogie hound.\"\n\n\"The beast was savage and half-starved. If its appearance did not\nfrighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the resistance\nwhich might be offered.\"\n\n\"No doubt. There only remains one difficulty. If Stapleton came into the\nsuccession, how could he explain the fact that he, the heir, had been\nliving unannounced under another name so close to the property? How\ncould he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry?\"\n\n\"It is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much when\nyou expect me to solve it. The past and the present are within the field\nof my inquiry, but what a man may do in the future is a hard question\nto answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on\nseveral occasions. There were three possible courses. He might claim the\nproperty from South America, establish his identity before the British\nauthorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to\nEngland at all, or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the\nshort time that he need be in London; or, again, he might furnish an\naccomplice with the proofs and papers, putting him in as heir, and\nretaining a claim upon some proportion of his income. We cannot doubt\nfrom what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the\ndifficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we have had some weeks of severe\nwork, and for one evening, I think, we may turn our thoughts into more\npleasant channels. I have a box for 'Les Huguenots.' Have you heard the\nDe Reszkes? Might I trouble you then to be ready in half an hour, and we\ncan stop at Marcini's for a little dinner on the way?\"", "title": "The Hound of the Baskervilles"}

{"summary": "\nDiary of a Madman centres on the life of Poprishchin, a low-ranking civil servant (titular counsellor) who yearns to be noticed by a beautiful woman, the daughter of a senior official, with whom he has fallen in love. As he said in his first sight of her, just after being a beast of a civil servant himself, “A footman opened the carriage door and out she fluttered, just like a little bird.”\nHis diary records his gradual slide into insanity. As his madness deepens, he begins to \"understand\" the conversations of two dogs and believes he has discovered letters sent between them. Finally, he begins to believe himself to be the heir to the throne of Spain. When he is hauled off and maltreated in the asylum, the madman believes he is taking part in a strange coronation to the Spanish throne. Only in his madness does the lowly anti-hero attain greatness.\nThe story satirizes the rampant petty officialdom of the bureaucracy in the 1830s in St Petersburg, and some have interpreted it as going beyond this to become an allegory about the political state of Russia at the time, revealing Gogol's view of the government from the standpoint of a lowly citizen. The story also portrays the average man's quest for individuality in a seemingly indifferent, urban environment.\n\n", "full_text": "file was produced from images generously made available\nby The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  [ Transcriber's Notes:\n\n    Every effort has been made to replicate this text as faithfully\n    as possible, including inconsistencies in spelling and hyphenation.\n    Some corrections of spelling have been made.

A Russian\nnovelist and dramatist. He was educated in a public gymnasium at\nPultowa, and subsequently in the lyceum, then newly established, at\nNiejinsk. In 1831 he was appointed teacher of history at the Patriotic\nInstitution, a place which he exchanged in 1834 for the professorship of\nhistory in the University of St Petersburg. This he resigned at the end\nof a year and devoted himself entirely to literature. In 1836 Gogol left\nRussia. He lived most of the time in Rome. In 1837 he wrote 'Dead\nSouls.' In 1840 he went to Russia for a short period in order to\nsuperintend the publication of the first volume of 'Dead Souls,' and\nthen returned to Italy. In 1846 he returned to Russia and fell into a\nstate of fanatical mysticism. One of his last acts was to burn the\nmanuscript of the concluding portion of 'Dead Souls,' which he\nconsidered harmful. He also wrote 'The Mantle,' 'Evenings at the Farm,'\n'St Petersburg Stories,' 'Taras Bulba,' a tale of the Cossacks, 'The\nRevizor,' a comedy, etc.\"--From _The Century Cyclopaedia of Names_.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\n                          PAGE\n\n  PREFACE                    7\n\n  THE MANTLE                19\n\n  THE NOSE                  67\n\n  MEMOIRS OF A MADMAN      107\n\n  A MAY NIGHT              141\n\n  THE VIY                  187\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\nAs a novel-writer and a dramatist, Gogol appears to me to deserve a\nminute study, and if the knowledge of Russian were more widely spread,\nhe could not fail to obtain in Europe a reputation equal to that of the\nbest English humorists.\n\nA delicate and close observer, quick to detect the absurd, bold in\nexposing, but inclined to push his fun too far, Gogol is in the first\nplace a very lively satirist. He is merciless towards fools and rascals,\nbut he has only one weapon at his disposal--irony. This is a weapon\nwhich is too severe to use against the merely absurd, and on the other\nhand it is not sharp enough for the punishment of crime; and it is\nagainst crime that Gogol too often uses it. His comic vein is always too\nnear the farcical, and his mirth is hardly contagious. If sometimes he\nmakes his reader laugh, he still leaves in his mind a feeling of\nbitterness and indignation; his satires do not avenge society, they only\nmake it angry.\n\nAs a painter of manners, Gogol excels in familiar scenes. He is akin to\nTeniers and Callot. We feel as though we had seen and lived with his\ncharacters, for he shows us their eccentricities, their nervous habits,\ntheir slightest gestures. One lisps, another mispronounces his words,\nand a third hisses because he has lost a front tooth. Unfortunately\nGogol is so absorbed in this minute study of details that he too often\nforgets to subordinate them to the main action of the story. To tell the\ntruth, there is no ordered plan in his works, and--a strange trait in an\nauthor who sets up as a realist--he takes no care to preserve an\natmosphere of probability. His most carefully painted scenes are\nclumsily connected--they begin and end abruptly; often the author's\ngreat carelessness in construction destroys, as though wantonly, the\nillusion produced by the truth of his descriptions and the naturalness\nof his conversations.\n\nThe immortal master of this school of desultory but ingenious and\nattractive story-tellers, among whom Gogol is entitled to a high place,\nis Rabelais, who cannot be too much admired and studied, but to imitate\nwhom nowadays would, I think, be dangerous and difficult. In spite of\nthe indefinable grace of his obsolete language, one can hardly read\ntwenty pages of Rabelais in succession. One soon wearies of this\neloquence, so original and so eloquent, but the drift of which escapes\nevery reader except some Oedipuses like Le Duchat or Eloi Johanneau.\nJust as the observation of animalculae under the microscope fatigues the\neye, so does the perusal of these brilliant pages tire the mind.\nPossibly not a word of them is superfluous, but possibly also they might\nbe entirely eliminated from the work of which they form part, without\nsensibly detracting from its merit. The art of choosing among the\ninnumerable details which nature offers us is, after all, much more\ndifficult than that of observing them with attention and recording them\nwith exactitude.\n\nThe Russian language, which is, as far as I can judge, the richest of\nall the European family, seems admirably adapted to express the most\ndelicate shades of thought. Possessed of a marvellous conciseness and\nclearness, it can with a single word call up several ideas, to express\nwhich in another tongue whole phrases would be necessary. French,\nassisted by Greek and Latin, calling to its aid all its northern and\nsouthern dialects--the language of Rabelais, in fact, is the only one\nwhich can convey any idea of this suppleness and this energy. One can\nimagine that such an admirable instrument may exercise a considerable\ninfluence on the mind of a writer who is capable of handling it. He\nnaturally takes delight in the picturesqueness of its expressions, just\nas a draughtsman with skill and a good pencil will trace delicate\ncontours. An excellent gift, no doubt, but there are few things which\nhave not their disadvantages. Elaborate execution is a considerable\nmerit if it is reserved for the chief parts of a work; but if it is\nuniformly lavished on all the accessory parts also, the whole produces,\nI fear, a monotonous effect.\n\nI have said that satire is, in my opinion, the special characteristic of\nGogol's talent: he does not see men or things in a bright light. That\ndoes not mean that he is an unfaithful observer, but his descriptions\nbetray a certain preference for the ugly and the sad elements in life.\nDoubtless these two disagreeable elements are only too easily found, and\nit is precisely for that reason that they should not be investigated\nwith insatiable curiosity. We would form a terrible idea of Russia--of\n\"Holy Russia,\" as her children call her--if we only judged her by the\npictures which Gogol draws. His characters are almost entirely confined\nto idiots, or scoundrels who deserve to be hung. It is a well-known\ndefect of satirists to see everywhere the game which they are hunting,\nand they should not be taken too literally. Aristophanes vainly employed\nhis brilliant genius in blackening his contemporaries; he cannot prevent\nus loving the Athens of Pericles.\n\nGogol generally goes to the country districts for his characters,\nimitating in this respect Balzac, whose writings have undoubtedly\ninfluenced him. The modern facility of communication in Europe has\nbrought about, among the higher classes of all countries and the\ninhabitants of the great cities, a conventional uniformity of manners\nand customs, e.g. the dress-coat and round hat. It is among the middle\nclasses remote from great towns that we must look to-day for national\ncharacteristics and for original characters. In the country, people\nstill maintain primitive habits and prejudices--things which become\nrarer from day to day. The Russian country gentlemen, who only journey\nto St Petersburg once in a lifetime, and who, living on their estates\nall the year round, eat much, read little and hardly think at all--these\nare the types to which Gogol is partial, or rather which he pursues with\nhis jests and sarcasms. Some critics, I am told, reproach him for\ndisplaying a kind of provincial patriotism. As a Little Russian, he is\nsaid to have a predilection for Little Russia over the rest of the\nEmpire. For my own part, I find him impartial enough or even too general\nin his criticisms, and on the other hand too severe on anyone whom he\nplaces under the microscope of his observation. Pushkin was accused,\nquite wrongly in my opinion, of scepticism, immorality, and of belonging\nto the Satanic school; however he discovered in an old country manor his\nadmirable Tatiana. One regrets that Gogol has not been equally\nfortunate.\n\nI do not know the dates of Gogol's different works, but I should be\ninclined to believe that his short stories were the first in order of\npublication. They seem to me to witness to a certain vagueness in the\nauthor's mind, as though he were making experiments in order to\nascertain to what style of work his genius was best adapted. He has\nproduced an historical romance inspired by the perusal of Sir Walter\nScott, fantastic legends, psychological studies, marked by a mixture of\nsentimentality and grotesqueness. If my conjecture is correct, he has\nbeen obliged to ask himself for some time whether he should take as his\nmodel Sterne, Walter Scott, Chamisso, or Hoffmann. Later on he has done\nbetter in following the path which he has himself traced out. \"Taras\nBulba,\" his historical romance, is an animated and, as far as I know,\ncorrect picture of the Zaporogues, that singular people whom Voltaire\nbriefly mentions in his \"Life of Charles XII.\" In the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries the Zaporogues played a great part in the annals\nof Russia and of Poland; they then formed a republic of soldiers, or\nrather of filibusters, established on the islands of the Don, nominal\nsubjects sometimes of the Kings of Poland, sometimes of the Grand Dukes\nof Moscow, sometimes even of the Ottoman Porte. At bottom they were\nextremely independent bandits, and ravaged their neighbours' territory\nwith great impartiality. They did not allow women to live in their\ntowns, which were a kind of nomad encampments; it was there that the\nCossack aspirants to military glory went to be trained as irregular\ntroops. The most absolute equality prevailed among the Zaporogues while\nat peace in the marshes of the Don. Then the chiefs, or atamans, when\nspeaking to their subordinates always took their caps off. But during an\nexpedition, on the contrary, their power was unlimited, and disobedience\nto the captain of the company (Ataman Kotchevoi) was considered the\ngreatest of crimes.\n\nOur filibusters of the seventeenth century have many traits of\nresemblance to the Zaporogues, and the histories of both preserve the\nremembrance of prodigies of audacity and of horrible cruelties. Taras\nBulba is one of those heroes with whom, as the student of Schiller said,\none can only have relations when holding a well-loaded gun in one's\nhand. I am one of those who have a strong liking for bandits; not\nbecause I like to meet them on my road, but because, in spite of myself,\nthe energy these men display in struggling against the whole of society,\nextorts from me an admiration of which I am ashamed. Formerly I read\nwith delight the lives of Morgan, of Donnais, and of Mombars the\ndestroyer, and I would not be bored if I read them again. However, there\nare bandits and bandits. Their glory is greatly enhanced if they are of\na recent date. Actual bandits always cast into the shade those of the\nmelodrama, and the one who has been more recently hung infallibly\neffaces the fame of his predecessors. Nowadays neither Mombars nor Taras\nBulba can excite so much interest as Mussoni, who last month sustained a\nregular siege in a wolf's den against five hundred men, who had to\nattack him by sapping and mining.\n\nGogol has made brilliantly coloured pictures of his Zaporogues, which\nplease by their very grotesqueness; but sometimes it is too evident that\nhe has not drawn them from nature. Moreover, these character-pictures\nare framed in such a trivial and romantic setting that one regrets to\nsee them so ill-placed. The most prosaic story would have suited them\nbetter than these melodramatic scenes in which are accumulated tragic\nincidents of famine, torture, etc. In short, one feels that the author\nis not at ease on the ground which he has chosen; his gait is awkward,\nand the invariable irony of his style makes the perusal of these\nmelancholy incidents more painful. This style which, in my opinion, is\nquite out of place in some parts of \"Taras Bulba,\" is much more\nappropriate in the \"Viy,\" or \"King of the Gnomes,\" a tale of witchcraft,\nwhich amuses and alarms at the same time. The grotesque easily blends\nwith the marvellous. Recognising to the full the poetic side of his\nsubject, the author, while describing the savage and strange customs of\nthe old-time Cossacks with his usual precision and exactitude, has\neasily prepared the way for the introduction of an element of\nuncanniness.\n\nThe receipt for a good, fantastic tale is well known: begin with\nwell-defined portraits of eccentric characters, but such as to be within\nthe bounds of possibility, described with minute realism. From the\ngrotesque to the marvellous the transition is imperceptible, and the\nreader will find himself in the world of fantasy before he perceives\nthat he has left the real world far behind him. I purposely avoid any\nattempt to analyse \"The King of the Gnomes\"; the proper time and place\nto read it is in the country, by the fireside on a stormy autumn night.\nAfter the _denouement_, it will require a certain amount of resolution\nto traverse long corridors to reach one's room, while the wind and the\nrain shake the casements. Now that the fantastic style of the Germans is\na little threadbare, that of the Cossacks will have novel charms, and in\nthe first place the merit of resembling nothing else--no slight praise,\nI think.\n\nThe \"Memoirs of a Madman\" is simultaneously a social satire, a\nsentimental story, and a medico-legal study of the phenomena presented\nby a brain which is becoming deranged. The study, I believe, is\ncarefully made and the process carefully depicted, but I do not like\nthis class of writing; madness is one of those misfortunes which arouse\npity but which disgust at the same time. Doubtless, by introducing a\nmadman in his story an author is sure of producing an effect. It causes\nto vibrate a cord which is always susceptible; but it is a cheap method,\nand Gogol's gifts are such as to be able to dispense with having resort\nto such. The portrayal of lunatics and dogs--both of whom can produce an\nirresistible effect--should be left to tyros. It is easy to extract\ntears from a reader by breaking a poodle's paw. Homer's only excuse, in\nmy opinion, for making us weep at the mutual recognition of the dog\nArgus and Ulysses, is because he was, I think, the first to discover the\nresources which the canine race offers to an author at a loss for\nexpedients.\n\nI hasten to go on to a small masterpiece, \"An Old-time Household.\" In a\nfew pages Gogol sketches for us the life of two honest old folk living\nin the country. There is not a grain of malice in their composition;\nthey are cheated and adored by their servants, and naive egoists as they\nare, believe everyone is as happy as themselves. The wife dies. The\nhusband, who only seemed born for merry-making, falls ill and dies some\nmonths after his wife. We discover that there was a heart in this mass\nof flesh. We laugh and weep in turns while reading this charming story,\nin which the art of the narrator is disguised by simplicity. All is true\nand natural; every detail is attractive and adds to the general effect.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Translator's Note._--The rest of Merimee's essay is occupied with\nanalyses of Gogol's \"Dead Souls\" and \"The Revisor,\" and therefore is not\ngiven here.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MANTLE\n\n\nIn a certain Russian ministerial department----\n\nBut it is perhaps better that I do not mention which department it was.\nThere are in the whole of Russia no persons more sensitive than\nGovernment officials. Each of them believes if he is annoyed in any way,\nthat the whole official class is insulted in his person.\n\nRecently an Isprawnik (country magistrate)--I do not know of which\ntown--is said to have drawn up a report with the object of showing that,\nignoring Government orders, people were speaking of Isprawniks in terms\nof contempt. In order to prove his assertions, he forwarded with his\nreport a bulky work of fiction, in which on about every tenth page an\nIsprawnik appeared generally in a drunken condition.\n\nIn order therefore to avoid any unpleasantness, I will not definitely\nindicate the department in which the scene of my story is laid, and will\nrather say \"in a certain chancellery.\"\n\nWell, in a certain chancellery there was a certain man who, as I cannot\ndeny, was not of an attractive appearance. He was short, had a face\nmarked with smallpox, was rather bald in front, and his forehead and\ncheeks were deeply lined with furrows--to say nothing of other physical\nimperfections. Such was the outer aspect of our hero, as produced by the\nSt Petersburg climate.\n\nAs regards his official rank--for with us Russians the official rank\nmust always be given--he was what is usually known as a permanent\ntitular councillor, one of those unfortunate beings who, as is well\nknown, are made a butt of by various authors who have the bad habit of\nattacking people who cannot defend themselves.\n\nOur hero's family name was Bashmatchkin; his baptismal name Akaki\nAkakievitch. Perhaps the reader may think this name somewhat strange and\nfar-fetched, but he can be assured that it is not so, and that\ncircumstances so arranged it that it was quite impossible to give him\nany other name.\n\nThis happened in the following way. Akaki Akakievitch was born, if I am\nnot mistaken, on the night of the 23rd of March. His deceased mother,\nthe wife of an official and a very good woman, immediately made proper\narrangements for his baptism. When the time came, she was lying on the\nbed before the door. At her right hand stood the godfather, Ivan\nIvanovitch Jeroshkin, a very important person, who was registrar of the\nsenate; at her left, the godmother Anna Semenovna Byelobrushkova, the\nwife of a police inspector, a woman of rare virtues.\n\nThree names were suggested to the mother from which to choose one for\nthe child--Mokuja, Sossuja, or Khozdazat.\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"I don't like such names.\"\n\nIn order to meet her wishes, the church calendar was opened in another\nplace, and the names Triphiliy, Dula, and Varakhasiy were found.\n\n\"This is a punishment from heaven,\" said the mother. \"What sort of names\nare these! I never heard the like! If it had been Varadat or Varukh, but\nTriphiliy and Varakhasiy!\"\n\nThey looked again in the calendar and found Pavsikakhiy and Vakhtisiy.\n\n\"Now I see,\" said the mother, \"this is plainly fate. If there is no help\nfor it, then he had better take his father's name, which was Akaki.\"\n\nSo the child was called Akaki Akakievitch. It was baptised, although it\nwept and cried and made all kinds of grimaces, as though it had a\npresentiment that it would one day be a titular councillor.\n\nWe have related all this so conscientiously that the reader himself\nmight be convinced that it was impossible for the little Akaki to\nreceive any other name. When and how he entered the chancellery and who\nappointed him, no one could remember. However many of his superiors\nmight come and go, he was always seen in the same spot, in the same\nattitude, busy with the same work, and bearing the same title; so that\npeople began to believe he had come into the world just as he was, with\nhis bald forehead and official uniform.\n\nIn the chancellery where he worked, no kind of notice was taken of him.\nEven the office attendants did not rise from their seats when he\nentered, nor look at him; they took no more notice than if a fly had\nflown through the room. His superiors treated him in a coldly despotic\nmanner. The assistant of the head of the department, when he pushed a\npile of papers under his nose, did not even say \"Please copy those,\" or\n\"There is something interesting for you,\" or make any other polite\nremark such as well-educated officials are in the habit of doing. But\nAkaki took the documents, without worrying himself whether they had the\nright to hand them over to him or not, and straightway set to work to\ncopy them.\n\nHis young colleagues made him the butt of their ridicule and their\nelegant wit, so far as officials can be said to possess any wit. They\ndid not scruple to relate in his presence various tales of their own\ninvention regarding his manner of life and his landlady, who was seventy\nyears old. They declared that she beat him, and inquired of him when he\nwould lead her to the marriage altar. Sometimes they let a shower of\nscraps of paper fall on his head, and told him they were snowflakes.\n\nBut Akaki Akakievitch made no answer to all these attacks; he seemed\noblivious of their presence. His work was not affected in the slightest\ndegree; during all these interruptions he did not make a single error in\ncopying. Only when the horse-play grew intolerable, when he was held by\nthe arm and prevented writing, he would say \"Do leave me alone! Why do\nyou always want to disturb me at work?\" There was something peculiarly\npathetic in these words and the way in which he uttered them.\n\nOne day it happened that when a young clerk, who had been recently\nappointed to the chancellery, prompted by the example of the others, was\nplaying him some trick, he suddenly seemed arrested by something in the\ntone of Akaki's voice, and from that moment regarded the old official\nwith quite different eyes. He felt as though some supernatural power\ndrew him away from the colleagues whose acquaintance he had made here,\nand whom he had hitherto regarded as well-educated, respectable men, and\nalienated him from them. Long afterwards, when surrounded by gay\ncompanions, he would see the figure of the poor little councillor and\nhear the words \"Do leave me alone! Why will you always disturb me at\nwork?\" Along with these words, he also heard others: \"Am I not your\nbrother?\" On such occasions the young man would hide his face in his\nhands, and think how little humane feeling after all was to be found in\nmen's hearts; how much coarseness and cruelty was to be found even in\nthe educated and those who were everywhere regarded as good and\nhonourable men.\n\nNever was there an official who did his work so zealously as Akaki\nAkakievitch. \"Zealously,\" do I say? He worked with a passionate love of\nhis task. While he copied official documents, a world of varied beauty\nrose before his eyes. His delight in copying was legible in his face. To\nform certain letters afforded him special satisfaction, and when he came\nto them he was quite another man; he began to smile, his eyes sparkled,\nand he pursed up his lips, so that those who knew him could see by his\nface which letters he was working at.\n\nHad he been rewarded according to his zeal, he would perhaps--to his own\nastonishment--have been raised to the rank of civic councillor. However,\nhe was not destined, as his colleagues expressed it, to wear a cross at\nhis buttonhole, but only to get haemorrhoids by leading a too sedentary\nlife.\n\nFor the rest, I must mention that on one occasion he attracted a certain\namount of attention. A director, who was a kindly man and wished to\nreward him for his long service, ordered that he should be entrusted\nwith a task more important than the documents which he usually had to\ncopy. This consisted in preparing a report for a court, altering the\nheadings of various documents, and here and there changing the first\npersonal pronoun into the third.\n\nAkaki undertook the work; but it confused and exhausted him to such a\ndegree that the sweat ran from his forehead and he at last exclaimed:\n\"No! Please give me again something to copy.\" From that time he was\nallowed to continue copying to his life's end.\n\nOutside this copying nothing appeared to exist for him. He did not even\nthink of his clothes. His uniform, which was originally green, had\nacquired a reddish tint. The collar was so narrow and so tight that his\nneck, although of average length, stretched far out of it, and appeared\nextraordinarily long, just like those of the cats with movable heads,\nwhich are carried about on trays and sold to the peasants in Russian\nvillages.\n\nSomething was always sticking to his clothes--a piece of thread, a\nfragment of straw which had been flying about, etc. Moreover he seemed\nto have a special predilection for passing under windows just when\nsomething not very clean was being thrown out of them, and therefore he\nconstantly carried about on his hat pieces of orange-peel and such\nrefuse. He never took any notice of what was going on in the streets, in\ncontrast to his colleagues who were always watching people closely and\nwhom nothing delighted more than to see someone walking along on the\nopposite pavement with a rent in his trousers.\n\nBut Akaki Akakievitch saw nothing but the clean, regular lines of his\ncopies before him; and only when he collided suddenly with a horse's\nnose, which blew its breath noisily in his face, did the good man\nobserve that he was not sitting at his writing-table among his neat\nduplicates, but walking in the middle of the street.\n\nWhen he arrived home, he sat down at once to supper, ate his\ncabbage-soup hurriedly, and then, without taking any notice how it\ntasted, a slice of beef with garlic, together with the flies and any\nother trifles which happened to be lying on it. As soon as his hunger\nwas satisfied, he set himself to write, and began to copy the documents\nwhich he had brought home with him. If he happened to have no official\ndocuments to copy, he copied for his own satisfaction political letters,\nnot for their more or less grand style but because they were directed to\nsome high personage.\n\nWhen the grey St Petersburg sky is darkened by the veil of night, and\nthe whole of officialdom has finished its dinner according to its\ngastronomical inclinations or the depth of its purse--when all recover\nthemselves from the perpetual scratching of bureaucratic pens, and all\nthe cares and business with which men so often needlessly burden\nthemselves, they devote the evening to recreation. One goes to the\ntheatre; another roams about the streets, inspecting toilettes; another\nwhispers flattering words to some young girl who has risen like a star\nin his modest official circle. Here and there one visits a colleague in\nhis third or fourth story flat, consisting of two rooms with an\nentrance-hall and kitchen, fitted with some pretentious articles of\nfurniture purchased by many abstinences.\n\nIn short, at this time every official betakes himself to some form of\nrecreation--playing whist, drinking tea, and eating cheap pastry or\nsmoking tobacco in long pipes. Some relate scandals about great people,\nfor in whatever situation of life the Russian may be, he always likes to\nhear about the aristocracy; others recount well-worn but popular\nanecdotes, as for example that of the commandant to whom it was reported\nthat a rogue had cut off the horse's tail on the monument of Peter the\nGreat.\n\nBut even at this time of rest and recreation, Akaki Akakievitch remained\nfaithful to his habits. No one could say that he had ever seen him in\nany evening social circle. After he had written as much as he wanted, he\nwent to bed, and thought of the joys of the coming day, and the fine\ncopies which God would give him to do.\n\nSo flowed on the peaceful existence of a man who was quite content with\nhis post and his income of four hundred roubles a year. He might perhaps\nhave reached an extreme old age if one of those unfortunate events had\nnot befallen him, which not only happen to titular but to actual privy,\ncourt, and other councillors, and also to persons who never give advice\nnor receive it.\n\nIn St Petersburg all those who draw a salary of four hundred roubles or\nthereabouts have a terrible enemy in our northern cold, although some\nassert that it is very good for the health. About nine o'clock in the\nmorning, when the clerks of the various departments betake themselves to\ntheir offices, the cold nips their noses so vigorously that most of them\nare quite bewildered. If at this time even high officials so suffer from\nthe severity of the cold in their own persons that the tears come into\ntheir eyes, what must be the sufferings of the titular councillors,\nwhose means do not allow of their protecting themselves against the\nrigour of winter? When they have put on their light cloaks, they must\nhurry through five or six streets as rapidly as possible, and then in\nthe porter's lodge warm themselves and wait till their frozen official\nfaculties have thawed.\n\nFor some time Akaki had been feeling on his back and shoulders very\nsharp twinges of pain, although he ran as fast as possible from his\ndwelling to the office. After well considering the matter, he came to\nthe conclusion that these were due to the imperfections of his cloak. In\nhis room he examined it carefully, and discovered that in two or three\nplaces it had become so thin as to be quite transparent, and that the\nlining was much torn.\n\nThis cloak had been for a long time the standing object of jests on the\npart of Akaki's merciless colleagues. They had even robbed it of the\nnoble name of \"cloak,\" and called it a cowl. It certainly presented a\nremarkable appearance. Every year the collar had grown smaller, for\nevery year the poor titular councillor had taken a piece of it away in\norder to repair some other part of the cloak; and these repairs did not\nlook as if they had been done by the skilled hand of a tailor. They had\nbeen executed in a very clumsy way and looked remarkably ugly.\n\nAfter Akaki Akakievitch had ended his melancholy examination, he said to\nhimself that he must certainly take his cloak to Petrovitch the tailor,\nwho lived high up in a dark den on the fourth floor.\n\nWith his squinting eyes and pock-marked face, Petrovitch certainly did\nnot look as if he had the honour to make frock-coats and trousers for\nhigh officials--that is to say, when he was sober, and not absorbed in\nmore pleasant diversions.\n\nI might dispense here with dwelling on this tailor; but since it is the\ncustom to portray the physiognomy of every separate personage in a tale,\nI must give a better or worse description of Petrovitch. Formerly when\nhe was a simple serf in his master's house, he was merely called Gregor.\nWhen he became free, he thought he ought to adorn himself with a new\nname, and dubbed himself Petrovitch; at the same time he began to drink\nlustily, not only on the high festivals but on all those which are\nmarked with a cross in the calendar. By thus solemnly celebrating the\ndays consecrated by the Church, he considered that he was remaining\nfaithful to the traditions of his childhood; and when he quarrelled with\nhis wife, he shouted that she was an earthly minded creature and a\nGerman. Of this lady we have nothing more to relate than that she was\nthe wife of Petrovitch, and that she did not wear a kerchief but a cap\non her head. For the rest, she was not pretty; only the soldiers looked\nat her as they passed, then they twirled their moustaches and walked on,\nlaughing.\n\nAkaki Akakievitch accordingly betook himself to the tailor's attic. He\nreached it by a dark, dirty, damp staircase, from which, as in all the\ninhabited houses of the poorer class in St Petersburg, exhaled an\neffluvia of spirits vexatious to nose and eyes alike. As the titular\ncouncillor climbed these slippery stairs, he calculated what sum\nPetrovitch could reasonably ask for repairing his cloak, and determined\nonly to give him a rouble.\n\nThe door of the tailor's flat stood open in order to provide an outlet\nfor the clouds of smoke which rolled from the kitchen, where\nPetrovitch's wife was just then cooking fish. Akaki, his eyes smarting,\npassed through the kitchen without her seeing him, and entered the room\nwhere the tailor sat on a large, roughly made, wooden table, his legs\ncrossed like those of a Turkish pasha, and, as is the custom of tailors,\nwith bare feet. What first arrested attention, when one approached him,\nwas his thumb nail, which was a little misshapen but as hard and strong\nas the shell of a tortoise. Round his neck were hung several skeins of\nthread, and on his knees lay a tattered coat. For some minutes he had\nbeen trying in vain to thread his needle. He was first of all angry with\nthe gathering darkness, then with the thread.\n\n\"Why the deuce won't you go in, you worthless scoundrel!\" he exclaimed.\n\nAkaki saw at once that he had come at an inopportune moment. He wished\nhe had found Petrovitch at a more favourable time, when he was enjoying\nhimself--when, as his wife expressed it, he was having a substantial\nration of brandy. At such times the tailor was extraordinarily ready to\nmeet his customer's proposals with bows and gratitude to boot. Sometimes\nindeed his wife interfered in the transaction, and declared that he was\ndrunk and promised to do the work at much too low a price; but if the\ncustomer paid a trifle more, the matter was settled.\n\nUnfortunately for the titular councillor, Petrovitch had just now not\nyet touched the brandy flask. At such moments he was hard, obstinate,\nand ready to demand an exorbitant price.\n\nAkaki foresaw this danger, and would gladly have turned back again, but\nit was already too late. The tailor's single eye--for he was\none-eyed--had already noticed him, and Akaki Akakievitch murmured\ninvoluntarily \"Good day, Petrovitch.\"\n\n\"Welcome, sir,\" answered the tailor, and fastened his glance on the\ntitular councillor's hand to see what he had in it.\n\n\"I come just--merely--in order--I want--\"\n\nWe must here remark that the modest titular councillor was in the habit\nof expressing his thoughts only by prepositions, adverbs, or particles,\nwhich never yielded a distinct meaning. If the matter of which he spoke\nwas a difficult one, he could never finish the sentence he had begun. So\nthat when transacting business, he generally entangled himself in the\nformula \"Yes--it is indeed true that----\" Then he would remain standing\nand forget what he wished to say, or believe that he had said it.\n\n\"What do you want, sir?\" asked Petrovitch, scrutinising him from top to\ntoe with a searching look, and contemplating his collar, sleeves, coat,\nbuttons--in short his whole uniform, although he knew them all very\nwell, having made them himself. That is the way of tailors whenever they\nmeet an acquaintance.\n\nThen Akaki answered, stammering as usual, \"I want--Petrovitch--this\ncloak--you see--it is still quite good, only a little dusty--and\ntherefore it looks a little old. It is, however, still quite new, only\nthat it is worn a little--there in the back and here in the\nshoulder--and there are three quite little splits. You see it is hardly\nworth talking about; it can be thoroughly repaired in a few minutes.\"\n\nPetrovitch took the unfortunate cloak, spread it on the table,\ncontemplated it in silence, and shook his head. Then he stretched his\nhand towards the window-sill for his snuff-box, a round one with the\nportrait of a general on the lid. I do not know whose portrait it was,\nfor it had been accidentally injured, and the ingenious tailor had\ngummed a piece of paper over it.\n\nAfter Petrovitch had taken a pinch of snuff, he examined the cloak\nagain, held it to the light, and once more shook his head. Then he\nexamined the lining, took a second pinch of snuff, and at last\nexclaimed, \"No! that is a wretched rag! It is beyond repair!\"\n\nAt these words Akaki's courage fell.\n\n\"What!\" he cried in the querulous tone of a child. \"Can this hole really\nnot be repaired? Look! Petrovitch; there are only two rents, and you\nhave enough pieces of cloth to mend them with.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have enough pieces of cloth; but how should I sew them on? The\nstuff is quite worn out; it won't bear another stitch.\"\n\n\"Well, can't you strengthen it with another piece of cloth?\"\n\n\"No, it won't bear anything more; cloth after all is only cloth, and in\nits present condition a gust of wind might blow the wretched mantle into\ntatters.\"\n\n\"But if you could only make it last a little longer, do you\nsee--really----\"\n\n\"No!\" answered Petrovitch decidedly. \"There is nothing more to be done\nwith it; it is completely worn out. It would be better if you made\nyourself foot bandages out of it for the winter; they are warmer than\nstockings. It was the Germans who invented stockings for their own\nprofit.\" Petrovitch never lost an opportunity of having a hit at the\nGermans. \"You must certainly buy a new cloak,\" he added.\n\n\"A new cloak?\" exclaimed Akaki Akakievitch, and it grew dark before his\neyes. The tailor's work-room seemed to go round with him, and the only\nobject he could clearly distinguish was the paper-patched general's\nportrait on the tailor's snuff-box. \"A new cloak!\" he murmured, as\nthough half asleep. \"But I have no money.\"\n\n\"Yes, a new cloak,\" repeated Petrovitch with cruel calmness.\n\n\"Well, even if I did decide on it--how much----\"\n\n\"You mean how much would it cost?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"About a hundred and fifty roubles,\" answered the tailor, pursing his\nlips. This diabolical tailor took a special pleasure in embarrassing his\ncustomers and watching the expression of their faces with his squinting\nsingle eye.\n\n\"A hundred and fifty roubles for a cloak!\" exclaimed Akaki Akakievitch\nin a tone which sounded like an outcry--possibly the first he had\nuttered since his birth.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Petrovitch. \"And then the marten-fur collar and silk\nlining for the hood would make it up to two hundred roubles.\"\n\n\"Petrovitch, I adjure you!\" said Akaki Akakievitch in an imploring tone,\nno longer hearing nor wishing to hear the tailor's words, \"try to make\nthis cloak last me a little longer.\"\n\n\"No, it would be a useless waste of time and work.\"\n\nAfter this answer, Akaki departed, feeling quite crushed; while\nPetrovitch, with his lips firmly pursed up, feeling pleased with himself\nfor his firmness and brave defence of the art of tailoring, remained\nsitting on the table.\n\nMeanwhile Akaki wandered about the streets like a somnambulist, at\nrandom and without an object. \"What a terrible business!\" he said to\nhimself. \"Really, I could never have believed that it would come to\nthat. No,\" he continued after a short pause, \"I could not have guessed\nthat it would come to that. Now I find myself in a completely unexpected\nsituation--in a difficulty that----\"\n\nAs he thus continued his monologue, instead of approaching his dwelling,\nhe went, without noticing it, in quite a wrong direction. A\nchimney-sweep brushed against him and blackened his back as he passed\nby. From a house where building was going on, a bucket of plaster of\nParis was emptied on his head. But he saw and heard nothing. Only when\nhe collided with a sentry, who, after he had planted his halberd beside\nhim, was shaking out some snuff from his snuff-box with a bony hand, was\nhe startled out of his reverie.\n\n\"What do you want?\" the rough guardian of civic order exclaimed. \"Can't\nyou walk on the pavement properly?\"\n\nThis sudden address at last completely roused Akaki from his torpid\ncondition. He collected his thoughts, considered his situation clearly,\nand began to take counsel with himself seriously and frankly, as with a\nfriend to whom one entrusts the most intimate secrets.\n\n\"No!\" he said at last. \"To-day I will get nothing from Petrovitch--to-day\nhe is in a bad humour--perhaps his wife has beaten him--I\nwill look him up again next Sunday. On Saturday evenings he gets\nintoxicated; then the next day he wants a pick-me-up--his wife gives him\nno money--I squeeze a ten-kopeck piece into his hand; then he will be\nmore reasonable and we can discuss the cloak further.\"\n\nEncouraged by these reflections, Akaki waited patiently till Sunday. On\nthat day, having seen Petrovitch's wife leave the house, he betook\nhimself to the tailor's and found him, as he had expected, in a very\ndepressed state as the result of his Saturday's dissipation. But hardly\nhad Akaki let a word fall about the mantle than the diabolical tailor\nawoke from his torpor and exclaimed, \"No, nothing can be done; you must\ncertainly buy a new cloak.\"\n\nThe titular councillor pressed a ten-kopeck piece into his hand.\n\n\"Thanks, my dear friend,\" said Petrovitch; \"that will get me a\npick-me-up, and I will drink your health with it. But as for your old\nmantle, what is the use of talking about it? It isn't worth a farthing.\nLet me only get to work; I will make you a splendid one, I promise!\"\n\nBut poor Akaki Akakievitch still importuned the tailor to repair his old\none.\n\n\"No, and again no,\" answered Petrovitch. \"It is quite impossible. Trust\nme; I won't take you in. I will even put silver hooks and eyes on the\ncollar, as is now the fashion.\"\n\nThis time Akaki saw that he must follow the tailor's advice, and again\nall his courage sank. He must have a new mantle made. But how should he\npay for it? He certainly expected a Christmas bonus at the office; but\nthat money had been allotted beforehand. He must buy a pair of trousers,\nand pay his shoemaker for repairing two pairs of boots, and buy some\nfresh linen. Even if, by an unexpected stroke of good luck, the director\nraised the usual bonus from forty to fifty roubles, what was such a\nsmall amount in comparison with the immense sum which Petrovitch\ndemanded? A mere drop of water in the sea.\n\nAt any rate, he might expect that Petrovitch, if he were in a good\nhumour, would lower the price of the cloak to eighty roubles; but where\nwere these eighty roubles to be found? Perhaps he might succeed if he\nleft no stone unturned, in raising half the sum; but he saw no means of\nprocuring the other half. As regards the first half, he had been in the\nhabit, as often as he received a rouble, of placing a kopeck in a\nmoney-box. At the end of each half-year he changed these copper coins\nfor silver. He had been doing this for some time, and his savings just\nnow amounted to forty roubles. Thus he already had half the required\nsum. But the other half!\n\nAkaki made long calculations, and at last determined that he must, at\nleast for a whole year, reduce some of his daily expenses. He would have\nto give up his tea in the evening, and copy his documents in his\nlandlady's room, in order to economise the fuel in his own. He also\nresolved to avoid rough pavements as much as possible, in order to spare\nhis shoes; and finally to give out less washing to the laundress.\n\nAt first he found these deprivations rather trying; but gradually he got\naccustomed to them, and at last took to going to bed without any supper\nat all. Although his body suffered from this abstinence, his spirit\nderived all the richer nutriment from perpetually thinking about his new\ncloak. From that time it seemed as though his nature had completed\nitself; as though he had married and possessed a companion on his life\njourney. This companion was the thought of his new cloak, properly\nwadded and lined.\n\nFrom that time he became more lively, and his character grew stronger,\nlike that of a man who has set a goal before himself which he will reach\nat all costs. All that was indecisive and vague in his gait and gestures\nhad disappeared. A new fire began to gleam in his eyes, and in his bold\ndreams he sometimes even proposed to himself the question whether he\nshould not have a marten-fur collar made for his coat.\n\nThese and similar thoughts sometimes caused him to be absent-minded. As\nhe was copying his documents one day he suddenly noticed that he had\nmade a slip. \"Ugh!\" he exclaimed, and crossed himself.\n\nAt least once a month he went to Petrovitch to discuss the precious\ncloak with him, and to settle many important questions, e.g. where and\nat what price he should buy the cloth, and what colour he should choose.\n\nEach of these visits gave rise to new discussions, but he always\nreturned home in a happier mood, feeling that at last the day must come\nwhen all the materials would have been bought and the cloak would be\nlying ready to put on.\n\nThis great event happened sooner than he had hoped. The director gave\nhim a bonus, not of forty or fifty, but of five-and-sixty roubles. Had\nthe worthy official noticed that Akaki needed a new mantle, or was the\nexceptional amount of the gift only due to chance?\n\nHowever that might be, Akaki was now richer by twenty roubles. Such an\naccess of wealth necessarily hastened his important undertaking. After\ntwo or three more months of enduring hunger, he had collected his eighty\nroubles. His heart, generally so quiet, began to beat violently; he\nhastened to Petrovitch, who accompanied him to a draper's shop. There,\nwithout hesitating, they bought a very fine piece of cloth. For more\nthan half a year they had discussed the matter incessantly, and gone\nround the shops inquiring prices. Petrovitch examined the cloth, and\nsaid they would not find anything better. For the lining they chose a\npiece of such firm and thickly woven linen that the tailor declared it\nwas better than silk; it also had a splendid gloss on it. They did not\nbuy marten fur, for it was too dear, but chose the best catskin in the\nshop, which was a very good imitation of the former.\n\nIt took Petrovitch quite fourteen days to make the mantle, for he put an\nextra number of stitches into it. He charged twelve roubles for his\nwork, and said he could not ask less; it was all sewn with silk, and the\ntailor smoothed the sutures with his teeth.\n\nAt last the day came--I cannot name it certainly, but it assuredly was\nthe most solemn in Akaki's life--when the tailor brought the cloak. He\nbrought it early in the morning, before the titular councillor started\nfor his office. He could not have come at a more suitable moment, for\nthe cold had again begun to be very severe.\n\nPetrovitch entered the room with the dignified mien of an important\ntailor. His face wore a peculiarly serious expression, such as Akaki had\nnever seen on it. He was fully conscious of his dignity, and of the gulf\nwhich separates the tailor who only repairs old clothes from the artist\nwho makes new ones.\n\nThe cloak had been brought wrapped up in a large, new, freshly washed\nhandkerchief, which the tailor carefully opened, folded, and placed in\nhis pocket. Then he proudly took the cloak in both hands and laid it on\nAkaki Akakievitch's shoulders. He pulled it straight behind to see how\nit hung majestically in its whole length. Finally he wished to see the\neffect it made when unbuttoned. Akaki, however, wished to try the\nsleeves, which fitted wonderfully well. In brief, the cloak was\nirreproachable, and its fit and cut left nothing to be desired.\n\nWhile the tailor was contemplating his work, he did not forget to say\nthat the only reason he had charged so little for making it, was that he\nhad only a low rent to pay and had known Akaki Akakievitch for a long\ntime; he declared that any tailor who lived on the Nevski Prospect would\nhave charged at least five-and-sixty roubles for making up such a cloak.\n\nThe titular councillor did not let himself be involved in a discussion\non the subject. He thanked him, paid him, and then sallied forth on his\nway to the office.\n\nPetrovitch went out with him, and remained standing in the street to\nwatch Akaki as long as possible wearing the mantle; then he hurried\nthrough a cross-alley and came into the main street again to catch\nanother glimpse of him.\n\nAkaki went on his way in high spirits. Every moment he was acutely\nconscious of having a new cloak on, and smiled with sheer\nself-complacency. His head was filled with only two ideas: first that\nthe cloak was warm, and secondly that it was beautiful. Without noticing\nanything on the road, he marched straight to the chancellery, took off\nhis treasure in the hall, and solemnly entrusted it to the porter's\ncare.\n\nI do not know how the report spread in the office that Akaki's old cloak\nhad ceased to exist. All his colleagues hastened to see his splendid new\none, and then began to congratulate him so warmly that he at first had\nto smile with self-satisfaction, but finally began to feel embarrassed.\n\nBut how great was his surprise when his cruel colleagues remarked that\nhe should formally \"handsel\" his cloak by giving them a feast! Poor\nAkaki was so disconcerted and taken aback, that he did not know what to\nanswer nor how to excuse himself. He stammered out, blushing, that the\ncloak was not so new as it appeared; it was really second-hand.\n\nOne of his superiors, who probably wished to show that he was not too\nproud of his rank and title, and did not disdain social intercourse with\nhis subordinates, broke in and said, \"Gentlemen! Instead of Akaki\nAkakievitch, I will invite you to a little meal. Come to tea with me\nthis evening. To-day happens to be my birthday.\"\n\nAll the others thanked him for his kind proposal, and joyfully accepted\nhis invitation. Akaki at first wished to decline, but was told that to\ndo so would be grossly impolite and unpardonable, so he reconciled\nhimself to the inevitable. Moreover, he felt a certain satisfaction at\nthe thought that the occasion would give him a new opportunity of\ndisplaying his cloak in the streets. This whole day for him was like a\nfestival day. In the cheerfullest possible mood he returned home, took\noff his cloak, and hung it up on the wall after once more examining the\ncloth and the lining. Then he took out his old one in order to compare\nit with Petrovitch's masterpiece. His looks passed from one to the\nother, and he thought to himself, smiling, \"What a difference!\"\n\nHe ate his supper cheerfully, and after he had finished, did not sit\ndown as usual to copy documents. No; he lay down, like a Sybarite, on\nthe sofa and waited. When the time came, he made his toilette, took his\ncloak, and went out.\n\nI cannot say where was the house of the superior official who so\ngraciously invited his subordinates to tea. My memory begins to grow\nweak, and the innumerable streets and houses of St Petersburg go round\nso confusedly in my head that I have difficulty in finding my way about\nthem. So much, however, is certain: that the honourable official lived\nin a very fine quarter of the city, and therefore very far from Akaki\nAkakievitch's dwelling.\n\nAt first the titular councillor traversed several badly lit streets\nwhich seemed quite empty; but the nearer he approached his superior's\nhouse, the more brilliant and lively the streets became. He met many\npeople, among whom were elegantly dressed ladies, and men with\nbeaverskin collars. The peasants' sledges, with their wooden seats and\nbrass studs, became rarer; while now every moment appeared skilled\ncoachmen with velvet caps, driving lacquered sleighs covered with\nbearskins, and fine carriages.\n\nAt last he reached the house whither he had been invited. His host lived\nin a first-rate style; a lamp hung before his door, and he occupied the\nwhole of the second story. As Akaki entered the vestibule, he saw a long\nrow of galoshes; on a table a samovar was smoking and hissing; many\ncloaks, some of them adorned with velvet and fur collars, hung on the\nwall. In the adjoining room he heard a confused noise, which assumed a\nmore decided character when a servant opened the door and came out\nbearing a tray full of empty cups, a milk-jug, and a basket of biscuits.\nEvidently the guests had been there some time and had already drunk\ntheir first cup of tea.\n\nAfter hanging his cloak on a peg, Akaki approached the room in which his\ncolleagues, smoking long pipes, were sitting round the card-table and\nmaking a good deal of noise. He entered the room, but remained standing\nby the door, not knowing what to do; but his colleagues greeted him with\nloud applause, and all hastened into the vestibule to take another look\nat his cloak. This excitement quite robbed the good titular councillor\nof his composure; but in his simplicity of heart he rejoiced at the\npraises which were lavished on his precious cloak. Soon afterwards his\ncolleagues left him to himself and resumed their whist parties.\n\nAkaki felt much embarrassed, and did not know what to do with his feet\nand hands. Finally he sat down by the players; looked now at their faces\nand now at the cards; then he yawned and remembered that it was long\npast his usual bedtime. He made an attempt to go, but they held him back\nand told him that he could not do so without drinking a glass of\nchampagne on what was for him such a memorable day.\n\nSoon supper was brought. It consisted of cold veal, cakes, and pastry of\nvarious kinds, accompanied by several bottles of champagne. Akaki was\nobliged to drink two glasses of it, and found everything round him take\non a more cheerful aspect. But he could not forget that it was already\nmidnight and that he ought to have been in bed long ago. From fear of\nbeing kept back again, he slipped furtively into the vestibule, where he\nwas pained to find his cloak lying on the ground. He carefully shook it,\nbrushed it, put it on, and went out.\n\nThe street-lamps were still alight. Some of the small ale-houses\nfrequented by servants and the lower classes were still open, and some\nhad just been shut; but by the beams of light which shone through the\nchinks of the doors, it was easy to see that there were still people\ninside, probably male and female domestics, who were quite indifferent\nto their employers' interests.\n\nAkaki Akakievitch turned homewards in a cheerful mood. Suddenly he found\nhimself in a long street where it was very quiet by day and still more\nso at night. The surroundings were very dismal. Only here and there hung\na lamp which threatened to go out for want of oil; there were long rows\nof wooden houses with wooden fences, but no sign of a living soul. Only\nthe snow in the street glimmered faintly in the dim light of the\nhalf-extinguished lanterns, and the little houses looked melancholy in\nthe darkness.\n\nAkaki went on till the street opened into an enormous square, on the\nother side of which the houses were scarcely visible, and which looked\nlike a terrible desert. At a great distance--God knows where!--glimmered\nthe light in a sentry-box, which seemed to stand at the end of the\nworld. At the same moment Akaki's cheerful mood vanished. He went in the\ndirection of the light with a vague sense of depression, as though some\nmischief threatened him. On the way he kept looking round him with\nalarm. The huge, melancholy expanse looked to him like a sea. \"No,\" he\nthought to himself, \"I had better not look at it\"; and he continued his\nway with his eyes fixed on the ground. When he raised them again he\nsuddenly saw just in front of him several men with long moustaches,\nwhose faces he could not distinguish. Everything grew dark before his\neyes, and his heart seemed to be constricted.\n\n\"That is my cloak!\" shouted one of the men, and seized him by the\ncollar. Akaki tried to call for help. Another man pressed a great bony\nfist on his mouth, and said to him, \"Just try to scream again!\" At the\nsame moment the unhappy titular councillor felt the cloak snatched away\nfrom him, and simultaneously received a kick which stretched him\nsenseless in the snow. A few minutes later he came to himself and stood\nup; but there was no longer anyone in sight. Robbed of his cloak, and\nfeeling frozen to the marrow, he began to shout with all his might; but\nhis voice did not reach the end of the huge square. Continuing to shout,\nhe ran with the rage of despair to the sentinel in the sentry-box, who,\nleaning on his halberd, asked him why the deuce he was making such a\nhellish noise and running so violently.\n\nWhen Akaki reached the sentinel, he accused him of being drunk because\nhe did not see that passers-by were robbed a short distance from his\nsentry-box.\n\n\"I saw you quite well,\" answered the sentinel, \"in the middle of the\nsquare with two men; I thought you were friends. It is no good getting\nso excited. Go to-morrow to the police inspector; he will take up the\nmatter, have the thieves searched for, and make an examination.\"\n\nAkaki saw there was nothing to be done but to go home. He reached his\ndwelling in a state of dreadful disorder, his hair hanging wildly over\nhis forehead, and his clothes covered with snow. When his old landlady\nheard him knocking violently at the door, she sprang up and hastened\nthither, only half-dressed; but at the sight of Akaki started back in\nalarm. When he told her what had happened, she clasped her hands\ntogether and said, \"You should not go to the police inspector, but to\nthe municipal Superintendent of the district. The inspector will put you\noff with fine words, and do nothing; but I have known the Superintendent\nfor a long time. My former cook, Anna, is now in his service, and I\noften see him pass by under our windows. He goes to church on all the\nfestival-days, and one sees at once by his looks that he is an honest\nman.\"\n\nAfter hearing this eloquent recommendation, Akaki retired sadly to his\nroom. Those who can picture to themselves such a situation will\nunderstand what sort of a night he passed. As early as possible the next\nmorning he went to the Superintendent's house. The servants told him\nthat he was still asleep. At ten o'clock he returned, only to receive\nthe same reply. At twelve o'clock the Superintendent had gone out.\n\nAbout dinner-time the titular councillor called again, but the clerks\nasked him in a severe tone what was his business with their superior.\nThen for the first time in his life Akaki displayed an energetic\ncharacter. He declared that it was absolutely necessary for him to speak\nwith the Superintendent on an official matter, and that anyone who\nventured to put difficulties in his way would have to pay dearly for it.\n\nThis left them without reply. One of the clerks departed, in order to\ndeliver his message. When Akaki was admitted to the Superintendent's\npresence, the latter's way of receiving his story was somewhat singular.\nInstead of confining himself to the principal matter--the theft, he\nasked the titular councillor how he came to be out so late, and whether\nhe had not been in suspicious company.\n\nTaken aback by such a question, Akaki did not know what to answer, and\nwent away without knowing whether any steps would be taken in the matter\nor not.\n\nThe whole day he had not been in his office--a perfectly new event in\nhis life. The next day he appeared there again with a pale face and\nrestless aspect, in his old cloak, which looked more wretched than ever.\nWhen his colleagues heard of his misfortune, some were cruel enough to\nlaugh; most of them, however, felt a sincere sympathy with him, and\nstarted a subscription for his benefit; but this praiseworthy\nundertaking had only a very insignificant result, because these same\nofficials had been lately called upon to contribute to two other\nsubscriptions--in the first case to purchase a portrait of their\ndirector, and in the second to buy a work which a friend of his had\npublished.\n\nOne of them, who felt sincerely sorry for Akaki, gave him some good\nadvice for want of something better. He told him it was a waste of time\nto go again to the Superintendent, because even in case that this\nofficial succeeded in recovering the cloak, the police would keep it\ntill the titular councillor had indisputably proved that he was the real\nowner of it. Akaki's friend suggested to him to go to a certain\nimportant personage, who because of his connection with the authorities\ncould expedite the matter.\n\nIn his bewilderment, Akaki resolved to follow this advice. It was not\nknown what position this personage occupied, nor how high it really was;\nthe only facts known were that he had only recently been placed in it,\nand that there must be still higher personages than himself, as he was\nleaving no stone unturned in order to get promotion. When he entered his\nprivate room, he made his subordinates wait for him on the stairs below,\nand no one had direct access to him. If anyone called with a request to\nsee him, the secretary of the board informed the Government secretary,\nwho in his turn passed it on to a higher official, and the latter\ninformed the important personage himself.\n\nThat is the way business is carried on in our Holy Russia. In the\nendeavour to resemble the higher officials, everyone imitates the\nmanners of his superiors. Not long ago a titular councillor, who was\nappointed to the headship of a little office, immediately placed over\nthe door of one of his two tiny rooms the inscription \"Council-chamber.\"\nOutside it were placed servants with red collars and lace-work on their\ncoats, in order to announce petitioners, and to conduct them into the\nchamber which was hardly large enough to contain a chair.\n\nBut let us return to the important personage in question. His way of\ncarrying things on was dignified and imposing, but a trifle complicated.\nHis system might be summed up in a single word--\"severity.\" This word he\nwould repeat in a sonorous tone three times in succession, and the last\ntime turn a piercing look on the person with whom he happened to be\nspeaking. He might have spared himself the trouble of displaying so much\ndisciplinary energy; the ten officials who were under his command feared\nhim quite sufficiently without it. As soon as they were aware of his\napproach, they would lay down their pens, and hasten to station\nthemselves in a respectful attitude as he passed by. In converse with\nhis subordinates, he preserved a stiff, unbending attitude, and\ngenerally confined himself to such expressions as \"What do you want? Do\nyou know with whom you are speaking? Do you consider who is in front of\nyou?\"\n\nFor the rest, he was a good-natured man, friendly and amiable with his\nacquaintances. But the title of \"District-Superintendent\" had turned his\nhead. Since the time when it had been bestowed upon him, he lived for a\ngreat part of the day in a kind of dizzy self-intoxication. Among his\nequals, however, he recovered his equilibrium, and then showed his real\namiability in more than one direction; but as soon as he found himself\nin the society of anyone of less rank than himself, he entrenched\nhimself in a severe taciturnity. This situation was all the more painful\nfor him as he was quite aware that he might have passed his time more\nagreeably.\n\nAll who watched him at such moments perceived clearly that he longed to\ntake part in an interesting conversation, but that the fear of\ndisplaying some unguarded courtesy, of appearing too confidential, and\nthereby doing a deadly injury to his dignity, held him back. In order to\navoid such a risk, he maintained an unnatural reserve, and only spoke\nfrom time to time in monosyllables. He had driven this habit to such a\npitch that people called him \"The Tedious,\" and the title was well\ndeserved.\n\nSuch was the person to whose aid Akaki wished to appeal. The moment at\nwhich he came seemed expressly calculated to flatter the\nSuperintendent's vanity, and accordingly to help forward the titular\ncouncillor's cause.\n\nThe high personage was seated in his office, talking cheerfully with an\nold friend whom he had not seen for several years, when he was told that\na gentleman named Akakievitch begged for the honour of an interview.\n\n\"Who is the man?\" asked the Superintendent in a contemptuous tone.\n\n\"An official,\" answered the servant.\n\n\"He must wait. I have no time to receive him now.\"\n\nThe high personage lied; there was nothing in the way of his granting\nthe desired audience. His friend and himself had already quite exhausted\nvarious topics of conversation. Many long, embarrassing pauses had\noccurred, during which they had lightly tapped each other on the\nshoulder, saying, \"So it was, you see.\"\n\n\"Yes, Stepan.\"\n\nBut the Superintendent refused to receive the petitioner, in order to\nshow his friend, who had quitted the public service and lived in the\ncountry, his own importance, and how officials must wait in the\nvestibule till he chose to receive them.\n\nAt last, after they had discussed various other subjects with other\nintervals of silence, during which the two friends leaned back in their\nchairs and blew cigarette smoke in the air, the Superintendent seemed\nsuddenly to remember that someone had sought an interview with him. He\ncalled the secretary, who stood with a roll of papers in his hand at the\ndoor, and told him to admit the petitioner.\n\nWhen he saw Akaki approaching with his humble expression, wearing his\nshabby old uniform, he turned round suddenly towards him and said \"What\ndo you want?\" in a severe voice, accompanied by a vibrating intonation\nwhich at the time of receiving his promotion he had practised before the\nlooking-glass for eight days.\n\nThe modest Akaki was quite taken aback by his harsh manner; however, he\nmade an effort to recover his composure, and to relate how his cloak had\nbeen stolen, but did not do so without encumbering his narrative with a\nmass of superfluous detail. He added that he had applied to His\nExcellence in the hope that through his making a representation to the\npolice inspector, or some other high personage, the cloak might be\ntraced.\n\nThe Superintendent found Akaki's method of procedure somewhat\nunofficial. \"Ah, sir,\" he said, \"don't you know what steps you ought to\ntake in such a case? Don't you know the proper procedure? You should\nhave handed in your petition at the chancellery. This in due course\nwould have passed through the hands of the chief clerk and director of\nthe bureau. It would then have been brought before my secretary, who\nwould have made a communication to you.\"\n\n\"Allow me,\" replied Akaki, making a strenuous effort to preserve the\nremnants of his presence of mind, for he felt that the perspiration\nstood on his forehead, \"allow me to remark to Your Excellence that I\nventured to trouble you personally in this matter because\nsecretaries--secretaries are a hopeless kind of people.\"\n\n\"What! How! Is it possible?\" exclaimed the Superintendent. \"How could\nyou say such a thing? Where have you got your ideas from? It is\ndisgraceful to see young people so rebellious towards their superiors.\"\nIn his official zeal the Superintendent overlooked the fact that the\ntitular councillor was well on in the fifties, and that the word \"young\"\ncould only apply to him conditionally, i.e. in comparison with a man of\nseventy. \"Do you also know,\" he continued, \"with whom you are speaking?\nDo you consider before whom you are standing? Do you consider, I ask\nyou, do you consider?\" As he spoke, he stamped his foot, and his voice\ngrew deeper.\n\nAkaki was quite upset--nay, thoroughly frightened; he trembled and shook\nand could hardly remain standing upright. Unless one of the office\nservants had hurried to help him, he would have fallen to the ground. As\nit was, he was dragged out almost unconscious.\n\nBut the Superintendent was quite delighted at the effect he had\nproduced. It exceeded all his expectations, and filled with satisfaction\nat the fact that his words made such an impression on a middle-aged man\nthat he lost consciousness, he cast a side-glance at his friend to see\nwhat effect the scene had produced on him. His self-satisfaction was\nfurther increased when he observed that his friend also was moved, and\nlooked at him half-timidly.\n\nAkaki had no idea how he got down the stairs and crossed the street, for\nhe felt more dead than alive. In his whole life he had never been so\nscolded by a superior official, let alone one whom he had never seen\nbefore.\n\nHe wandered in the storm which raged without taking the least care of\nhimself, nor sheltering himself on the side-walk against its fury. The\nwind, which blew from all sides and out of all the narrow streets,\ncaused him to contract inflammation of the throat. When he reached home\nhe was unable to speak a word, and went straight to bed.\n\nSuch was the result of the Superintendent's lecture.\n\nThe next day Akaki had a violent fever. Thanks to the St Petersburg\nclimate, his illness developed with terrible rapidity. When the doctor\ncame, he saw that the case was already hopeless; he felt his pulse and\nordered him some poultices, merely in order that he should not die\nwithout some medical help, and declared at once that he had only two\ndays to live. After giving this opinion, he said to Akaki's landlady,\n\"There is no time to be lost; order a pine coffin, for an oak one would\nbe too expensive for this poor man.\"\n\nWhether the titular councillor heard these words, whether they excited\nhim and made him lament his tragic lot, no one ever knew, for he was\ndelirious all the time. Strange pictures passed incessantly through his\nweakened brain. At one time he saw Petrovitch the tailor and asked him\nto make a cloak with nooses attached for the thieves who persecuted him\nin bed, and begged his old landlady to chase away the robbers who were\nhidden under his coverlet. At another time he seemed to be listening to\nthe Superintendent's severe reprimand, and asking his forgiveness. Then\nhe uttered such strange and confused remarks that the old woman crossed\nherself in alarm. She had never heard anything of the kind in her life,\nand these ravings astonished her all the more because the expression\n\"Your Excellency\" constantly occurred in them. Later on he murmured wild\ndisconnected words, from which it could only be gathered that his\nthoughts were continually revolving round a cloak.\n\nAt last Akaki breathed his last. Neither his room nor his cupboard were\nofficially sealed up, for the simple reason that he had no heir and left\nnothing behind him but a bundle of goose-quills, a notebook of white\npaper, three pairs of socks, some trouser buttons, and his old coat.\n\nInto whose possession did these relics pass? Heaven only knows! The\nwriter of this narrative has never inquired.\n\nAkaki was wrapped in his shroud, and laid to rest in the churchyard. The\ngreat city of St Petersburg continued its life as though he had never\nexisted. Thus disappeared a human creature who had never possessed a\npatron or friend, who had never elicited real hearty sympathy from\nanyone, nor even aroused the curiosity of the naturalists, though they\nare most eager to subject a rare insect to microscopic examination.\n\nWithout a complaint he had borne the scorn and contempt of his\ncolleagues; he had proceeded on his quiet way to the grave without\nanything extraordinary happening to him--only towards the end of his\nlife he had been joyfully excited by the possession of a new cloak, and\nhad then been overthrown by misfortune.\n\nSome days after his conversation with the Superintendent, his superior\nin the chancellery, where no one knew what had become of him, sent an\nofficial to his house to demand his presence. The official returned with\nthe news that no one would see the titular councillor any more.\n\n\"Why?\" asked all the clerks.\n\n\"Because he was buried four days ago.\"\n\nIn such a manner did Akaki's colleagues hear of his death.\n\nThe next day his place was occupied by an official of robuster fibre, a\nman who did not trouble to make so many fair transcripts of state\ndocuments.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seems as though Akaki's story ended here, and that there was nothing\nmore to be said of him; but the modest titular councillor was destined\nto attract more notice after his death than during his life, and our\ntale now assumes a somewhat ghostly complexion.\n\nOne day there spread in St Petersburg the report that near the Katinka\nBridge there appeared every night a spectre in a uniform like that of\nthe chancellery officials; that he was searching for a stolen cloak, and\nstripped all passers-by of their cloaks without any regard for rank or\ntitle. It mattered not whether they were lined with wadding, mink, cat,\notter, bear, or beaverskin; he took all he could get hold of. One of the\ntitular councillor's former colleagues had seen the ghost, and quite\nclearly recognised Akaki. He ran as hard as he could and managed to\nescape, but had seen him shaking his fist in the distance. Everywhere it\nwas reported that councillors, and not only titular councillors but also\nstate-councillors, had caught serious colds in their honourable backs on\naccount of these raids.\n\nThe police adopted all possible measures in order to get this ghost dead\nor alive into their power, and to inflict an exemplary punishment on\nhim; but all their attempts were vain.\n\nOne evening, however, a sentinel succeeded in getting hold of the\nmalefactor just as he was trying to rob a musician of his cloak. The\nsentinel summoned with all the force of his lungs two of his comrades,\nto whom he entrusted the prisoner while he sought for his snuff-box in\norder to bring some life again into his half-frozen nose. Probably his\nsnuff was so strong that even a ghost could not stand it. Scarcely had\nthe sentinel thrust a grain or two up his nostrils than the prisoner\nbegan to sneeze so violently that a kind of mist rose before the eyes of\nthe sentinels. While the three were rubbing their eyes, the prisoner\ndisappeared. Since that day, all the sentries were so afraid of the\nghost that they did not even venture to arrest the living but shouted to\nthem from afar \"Go on! Go on!\"\n\nMeanwhile the ghost extended his depredations to the other side of the\nKatinka Bridge, and spread dismay and alarm in the whole of the quarter.\n\nBut now we must return to the Superintendent, who is the real origin of\nour fantastic yet so veracious story. First of all we must do him the\njustice to state that after Akaki's departure he felt a certain sympathy\nfor him. He was by no means without a sense of justice--no, he possessed\nvarious good qualities, but his infatuation about his title hindered him\nfrom showing his good side. When his friend left him, his thoughts began\nto occupy themselves with the unfortunate titular councillor, and from\nthat moment onwards he saw him constantly in his mind's eye, crushed by\nthe severe reproof which had been administered to him. This image so\nhaunted him that at last one day he ordered one of his officials to find\nout what had become of Akaki, and whether anything could be done for\nhim.\n\nWhen the messenger returned with the news that the poor man had died\nsoon after that interview, the Superintendent felt a pang in his\nconscience, and remained the whole day absorbed in melancholy brooding.\n\nIn order to banish his unpleasant sensations, he went in the evening to\na friend's house, where he hoped to find pleasant society and what was\nthe chief thing, some other officials of his own rank, so that he would\nnot be obliged to feel bored. And in fact he did succeed in throwing off\nhis melancholy thoughts there; he unbent and became lively, took an\nactive part in the conversation, and passed a very pleasant evening. At\nsupper he drank two glasses of champagne, which, as everyone knows, is\nan effective means of heightening one's cheerfulness.\n\nAs he sat in his sledge, wrapped in his mantle, on his way home, his\nmind was full of pleasant reveries. He thought of the society in which\nhe had passed such a cheerful evening, and of all the excellent jokes\nwith which he had made them laugh. He repeated some of them to himself\nhalf-aloud, and laughed at them again.\n\nFrom time to time, however, he was disturbed in this cheerful mood by\nviolent gusts of wind, which from some corner or other blew a quantity\nof snowflakes into his face, lifted the folds of his cloak, and made it\nbelly like a sail, so that he had to exert all his strength to hold it\nfirmly on his shoulders. Suddenly he felt a powerful hand seize him by\nthe collar. He turned round, perceived a short man in an old, shabby\nuniform, and recognised with terror Akaki's face, which wore a deathly\npallor and emaciation.\n\nThe titular councillor opened his mouth, from which issued a kind of\ncorpse-like odour, and with inexpressible fright the Superintendent\nheard him say, \"At last I have you--by the collar! I need your cloak.\nYou did not trouble about me when I was in distress; you thought it\nnecessary to reprimand me. Now give me your cloak.\"\n\nThe high dignitary nearly choked. In his office, and especially in the\npresence of his subordinates, he was a man of imposing manners. He only\nneeded to fix his eye on one of them and they all seemed impressed by\nhis pompous bearing. But, as is the case with many such officials, all\nthis was only outward show; at this moment he felt so upset that he\nseriously feared for his health. Taking off his cloak with a feverish,\ntrembling hand, he handed it to Akaki, and called to his coachman,\n\"Drive home quickly.\"\n\nWhen the coachman heard this voice, which did not sound as it usually\ndid, and had often been accompanied by blows of a whip, he bent his head\ncautiously and drove on apace.\n\nSoon afterwards the Superintendent found himself at home. Cloakless, he\nretired to his room with a pale face and wild looks, and had such a bad\nnight that on the following morning his daughter exclaimed \"Father, are\nyou ill?\" But he said nothing of what he had seen, though a very deep\nimpression had been made on him. From that day onwards he no longer\naddressed to his subordinates in a violent tone the words, \"Do you know\nwith whom you are speaking? Do you know who is standing before you?\" Or\nif it ever did happen that he spoke to them in a domineering tone, it\nwas not till he had first listened to what they had to say.\n\nStrangely enough, from that time the spectre never appeared again.\nProbably it was the Superintendent's cloak which he had been seeking so\nearnestly; now he had it and did not want anything more. Various\npersons, however, asserted that this formidable ghost was still to be\nseen in other parts of the city. A sentinel went so far as to say that\nhe had seen him with his own eyes glide like a furtive shadow behind a\nhouse. But this sentinel was of such a nervous disposition that he had\nbeen chaffed about his timidity more than once. Since he did not venture\nto seize the flitting shadow, he stole after it in the darkness; but the\nshadow turned round and shouted at him \"What do you want?\" shaking an\nenormous fist, such as no man had ever possessed.\n\n\"I want nothing,\" answered the sentry, quickly retiring.\n\nThis shadow, however, was taller than the ghost of the titular\ncouncillor, and had an enormous moustache. He went with great strides\ntowards the Obuchoff Bridge, and disappeared in the darkness.\n\n\n\n\nTHE NOSE\n\n\nI\n\nOn the 25th March, 18--, a very strange occurrence took place in St\nPetersburg. On the Ascension Avenue there lived a barber of the name of\nIvan Jakovlevitch. He had lost his family name, and on his sign-board,\non which was depicted the head of a gentleman with one cheek soaped, the\nonly inscription to be read was, \"Blood-letting done here.\"\n\nOn this particular morning he awoke pretty early. Becoming aware of the\nsmell of fresh-baked bread, he sat up a little in bed, and saw his wife,\nwho had a special partiality for coffee, in the act of taking some\nfresh-baked bread out of the oven.\n\n\"To-day, Prasskovna Ossipovna,\" he said, \"I do not want any coffee; I\nshould like a fresh loaf with onions.\"\n\n\"The blockhead may eat bread only as far as I am concerned,\" said his\nwife to herself; \"then I shall have a chance of getting some coffee.\"\nAnd she threw a loaf on the table.\n\nFor the sake of propriety, Ivan Jakovlevitch drew a coat over his shirt,\nsat down at the table, shook out some salt for himself, prepared two\nonions, assumed a serious expression, and began to cut the bread. After\nhe had cut the loaf in two halves, he looked, and to his great\nastonishment saw something whitish sticking in it. He carefully poked\nround it with his knife, and felt it with his finger.\n\n\"Quite firmly fixed!\" he murmured in his beard. \"What can it be?\"\n\nHe put in his finger, and drew out--a nose!\n\nIvan Jakovlevitch at first let his hands fall from sheer astonishment;\nthen he rubbed his eyes and began to feel it. A nose, an actual nose;\nand, moreover, it seemed to be the nose of an acquaintance! Alarm and\nterror were depicted in Ivan's face; but these feelings were slight in\ncomparison with the disgust which took possession of his wife.\n\n\"Whose nose have you cut off, you monster?\" she screamed, her face red\nwith anger. \"You scoundrel! You tippler! I myself will report you to the\npolice! Such a rascal! Many customers have told me that while you were\nshaving them, you held them so tight by the nose that they could hardly\nsit still.\"\n\nBut Ivan Jakovlevitch was more dead than alive; he saw at once that this\nnose could belong to no other than to Kovaloff, a member of the\nMunicipal Committee whom he shaved every Sunday and Wednesday.\n\n\"Stop, Prasskovna Ossipovna! I will wrap it in a piece of cloth and\nplace it in the corner. There it may remain for the present; later on I\nwill take it away.\"\n\n\"No, not there! Shall I endure an amputated nose in my room? You\nunderstand nothing except how to strop a razor. You know nothing of the\nduties and obligations of a respectable man. You vagabond! You\ngood-for-nothing! Am I to undertake all responsibility for you at the\npolice-office? Ah, you soap-smearer! You blockhead! Take it away where\nyou like, but don't let it stay under my eyes!\"\n\nIvan Jakovlevitch stood there flabbergasted. He thought and thought, and\nknew not what he thought.\n\n\"The devil knows how that happened!\" he said at last, scratching his\nhead behind his ear. \"Whether I came home drunk last night or not, I\nreally don't know; but in all probability this is a quite extraordinary\noccurrence, for a loaf is something baked and a nose is something\ndifferent. I don't understand the matter at all.\" And Ivan Jakovlevitch\nwas silent. The thought that the police might find him in unlawful\npossession of a nose and arrest him, robbed him of all presence of mind.\nAlready he began to have visions of a red collar with silver braid and\nof a sword--and he trembled all over.\n\nAt last he finished dressing himself, and to the accompaniment of the\nemphatic exhortations of his spouse, he wrapped up the nose in a cloth\nand issued into the street.\n\nHe intended to lose it somewhere--either at somebody's door, or in a\npublic square, or in a narrow alley; but just then, in order to complete\nhis bad luck, he was met by an acquaintance, who showered inquiries upon\nhim. \"Hullo, Ivan Jakovlevitch! Whom are you going to shave so early in\nthe morning?\" etc., so that he could find no suitable opportunity to do\nwhat he wanted. Later on he did let the nose drop, but a sentry bore\ndown upon him with his halberd, and said, \"Look out! You have let\nsomething drop!\" and Ivan Jakovlevitch was obliged to pick it up and put\nit in his pocket.\n\nA feeling of despair began to take possession of him; all the more as\nthe streets became more thronged and the merchants began to open their\nshops. At last he resolved to go to the Isaac Bridge, where perhaps he\nmight succeed in throwing it into the Neva.\n\nBut my conscience is a little uneasy that I have not yet given any\ndetailed information about Ivan Jakovlevitch, an estimable man in many\nways.\n\nLike every honest Russian tradesman, Ivan Jakovlevitch was a terrible\ndrunkard, and although he shaved other people's faces every day, his own\nwas always unshaved. His coat (he never wore an overcoat) was quite\nmottled, i.e. it had been black, but become brownish-yellow; the collar\nwas quite shiny, and instead of the three buttons, only the threads by\nwhich they had been fastened were to be seen.\n\nIvan Jakovlevitch was a great cynic, and when Kovaloff, the member of\nthe Municipal Committee, said to him, as was his custom while being\nshaved, \"Your hands always smell, Ivan Jakovlevitch!\" the latter\nanswered, \"What do they smell of?\" \"I don't know, my friend, but they\nsmell very strong.\" Ivan Jakovlevitch after taking a pinch of snuff\nwould then, by way of reprisals, set to work to soap him on the cheek,\nthe upper lip, behind the ears, on the chin, and everywhere.\n\nThis worthy man now stood on the Isaac Bridge. At first he looked round\nhim, then he leant on the railings of the bridge, as though he wished to\nlook down and see how many fish were swimming past, and secretly threw\nthe nose, wrapped in a little piece of cloth, into the water. He felt as\nthough a ton weight had been lifted off him, and laughed cheerfully.\nInstead, however, of going to shave any officials, he turned his steps\nto a building, the sign-board of which bore the legend \"Teas served\nhere,\" in order to have a glass of punch, when suddenly he perceived at\nthe other end of the bridge a police inspector of imposing exterior,\nwith long whiskers, three-cornered hat, and sword hanging at his side.\nHe nearly fainted; but the police inspector beckoned to him with his\nhand and said, \"Come here, my dear sir.\"\n\nIvan Jakovlevitch, knowing how a gentleman should behave, took his hat\noff quickly, went towards the police inspector and said, \"I hope you are\nin the best of health.\"\n\n\"Never mind my health. Tell me, my friend, why you were standing on the\nbridge.\"\n\n\"By heaven, gracious sir, I was on the way to my customers, and only\nlooked down to see if the river was flowing quickly.\"\n\n\"That is a lie! You won't get out of it like that. Confess the truth.\"\n\n\"I am willing to shave Your Grace two or even three times a week\ngratis,\" answered Ivan Jakovlevitch.\n\n\"No, my friend, don't put yourself out! Three barbers are busy with me\nalready, and reckon it a high honour that I let them show me their\nskill. Now then, out with it! What were you doing there?\"\n\nIvan Jakovlevitch grew pale. But here the strange episode vanishes in\nmist, and what further happened is not known.\n\n\nII\n\nKovaloff, the member of the Municipal Committee, awoke fairly early that\nmorning, and made a droning noise--\"Brr! Brr!\"--through his lips, as he\nalways did, though he could not say why. He stretched himself, and told\nhis valet to give him a little mirror which was on the table. He wished\nto look at the heat-boil which had appeared on his nose the previous\nevening; but to his great astonishment, he saw that instead of his nose\nhe had a perfectly smooth vacancy in his face. Thoroughly alarmed, he\nordered some water to be brought, and rubbed his eyes with a towel. Sure\nenough, he had no longer a nose! Then he sprang out of bed, and shook\nhimself violently! No, no nose any more! He dressed himself and went at\nonce to the police superintendent.\n\nBut before proceeding further, we must certainly give the reader some\ninformation about Kovaloff, so that he may know what sort of a man this\nmember of the Municipal Committee really was. These committee-men, who\nobtain that title by means of certificates of learning, must not be\ncompared with the committee-men appointed for the Caucasus district, who\nare of quite a different kind. The learned committee-man--but Russia is\nsuch a wonderful country that when one committee-man is spoken of all\nthe others from Riga to Kamschatka refer it to themselves. The same is\nalso true of all other titled officials. Kovaloff had been a Caucasian\ncommittee-man two years previously, and could not forget that he had\noccupied that position; but in order to enhance his own importance, he\nnever called himself \"committee-man\" but \"Major.\"\n\n\"Listen, my dear,\" he used to say when he met an old woman in the street\nwho sold shirt-fronts; \"go to my house in Sadovaia Street and ask 'Does\nMajor Kovaloff live here?' Any child can tell you where it is.\"\n\nAccordingly we will call him for the future Major Kovaloff. It was his\ncustom to take a daily walk on the Neffsky Avenue. The collar of his\nshirt was always remarkably clean and stiff. He wore the same style of\nwhiskers as those that are worn by governors of districts, architects,\nand regimental doctors; in short, all those who have full red cheeks and\nplay a good game of whist. These whiskers grow straight across the cheek\ntowards the nose.\n\nMajor Kovaloff wore a number of seals, on some of which were engraved\narmorial bearings, and others the names of the days of the week. He had\ncome to St Petersburg with the view of obtaining some position\ncorresponding to his rank, if possible that of vice-governor of a\nprovince; but he was prepared to be content with that of a bailiff in\nsome department or other. He was, moreover, not disinclined to marry,\nbut only such a lady who could bring with her a dowry of two hundred\nthousand roubles. Accordingly, the reader can judge for himself what his\nsensations were when he found in his face, instead of a fairly\nsymmetrical nose, a broad, flat vacancy.\n\nTo increase his misfortune, not a single droshky was to be seen in the\nstreet, and so he was obliged to proceed on foot. He wrapped himself up\nin his cloak, and held his handkerchief to his face as though his nose\nbled. \"But perhaps it is all only my imagination; it is impossible that\na nose should drop off in such a silly way,\" he thought, and stepped\ninto a confectioner's shop in order to look into the mirror.\n\nFortunately no customer was in the shop; only small shop-boys were\ncleaning it out, and putting chairs and tables straight. Others with\nsleepy faces were carrying fresh cakes on trays, and yesterday's\nnewspapers stained with coffee were still lying about. \"Thank God no one\nis here!\" he said to himself. \"Now I can look at myself leisurely.\"\n\nHe stepped gingerly up to a mirror and looked.\n\n\"What an infernal face!\" he exclaimed, and spat with disgust. \"If there\nwere only something there instead of the nose, but there is absolutely\nnothing.\"\n\nHe bit his lips with vexation, left the confectioner's, and resolved,\nquite contrary to his habit, neither to look nor smile at anyone on the\nstreet. Suddenly he halted as if rooted to the spot before a door, where\nsomething extraordinary happened. A carriage drew up at the entrance;\nthe carriage door was opened, and a gentleman in uniform came out and\nhurried up the steps. How great was Kovaloff's terror and astonishment\nwhen he saw that it was his own nose!\n\nAt this extraordinary sight, everything seemed to turn round with him.\nHe felt as though he could hardly keep upright on his legs; but, though\ntrembling all over as though with fever, he resolved to wait till the\nnose should return to the carriage. After about two minutes the nose\nactually came out again. It wore a gold-embroidered uniform with a\nstiff, high collar, trousers of chamois leather, and a sword hung at its\nside. The hat, adorned with a plume, showed that it held the rank of a\nstate-councillor. It was obvious that it was paying \"duty-calls.\" It\nlooked round on both sides, called to the coachman \"Drive on,\" and got\ninto the carriage, which drove away.\n\nPoor Kovaloff nearly lost his reason. He did not know what to think of\nthis extraordinary procedure. And indeed how was it possible that the\nnose, which only yesterday he had on his face, and which could neither\nwalk nor drive, should wear a uniform. He ran after the carriage, which\nfortunately had stopped a short way off before the Grand Bazar of\nMoscow. He hurried towards it and pressed through a crowd of\nbeggar-women with their faces bound up, leaving only two openings for\nthe eyes, over whom he had formerly so often made merry.\n\nThere were only a few people in front of the Bazar. Kovaloff was so\nagitated that he could decide on nothing, and looked for the nose\neverywhere. At last he saw it standing before a shop. It seemed half\nburied in its stiff collar, and was attentively inspecting the wares\ndisplayed.\n\n\"How can I get at it?\" thought Kovaloff. \"Everything--the uniform, the\nhat, and so on--show that it is a state-councillor. How the deuce has\nthat happened?\"\n\nHe began to cough discreetly near it, but the nose paid him not the\nleast attention.\n\n\"Honourable sir,\" said Kovaloff at last, plucking up courage,\n\"honourable sir.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked the nose, and turned round.\n\n\"It seems to me strange, most respected sir--you should know where you\nbelong--and I find you all of a sudden--where? Judge yourself.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, I do not understand what you are talking about. Explain\nyourself more distinctly.\"\n\n\"How shall I make my meaning plainer to him?\" Then plucking up fresh\ncourage, he continued, \"Naturally--besides I am a Major. You must admit\nit is not befitting that I should go about without a nose. An old\napple-woman on the Ascension Bridge may carry on her business without\none, but since I am on the look out for a post; besides in many houses I\nam acquainted with ladies of high position--Madame Tchektyriev, wife of\na state-councillor, and many others. So you see--I do not know,\nhonourable sir, what you----\" (here the Major shrugged his shoulders).\n\"Pardon me; if one regards the matter from the point of view of duty and\nhonour--you will yourself understand----\"\n\n\"I understand nothing,\" answered the nose. \"I repeat, please explain\nyourself more distinctly.\"\n\n\"Honourable sir,\" said Kovaloff with dignity, \"I do not know how I am to\nunderstand your words. It seems to me the matter is as clear as\npossible. Or do you wish--but you are after all my own nose!\"\n\nThe nose looked at the Major and wrinkled its forehead. \"There you are\nwrong, respected sir; I am myself. Besides, there can be no close\nrelations between us. To judge by the buttons of your uniform, you must\nbe in quite a different department to mine.\" So saying, the nose turned\naway.\n\nKovaloff was completely puzzled; he did not know what to do, and still\nless what to think. At this moment he heard the pleasant rustling of a\nlady's dress, and there approached an elderly lady wearing a quantity of\nlace, and by her side her graceful daughter in a white dress which set\noff her slender figure to advantage, and wearing a light straw hat.\nBehind the ladies marched a tall lackey with long whiskers.\n\nKovaloff advanced a few steps, adjusted his cambric collar, arranged his\nseals which hung by a little gold chain, and with smiling face fixed his\neyes on the graceful lady, who bowed lightly like a spring flower, and\nraised to her brow her little white hand with transparent fingers. He\nsmiled still more when he spied under the brim of her hat her little\nround chin, and part of her cheek faintly tinted with rose-colour. But\nsuddenly he sprang back as though he had been scorched. He remembered\nthat he had nothing but an absolute blank in place of a nose, and tears\nstarted to his eyes. He turned round in order to tell the gentleman in\nuniform that he was only a state-councillor in appearance, but really a\nscoundrel and a rascal, and nothing else but his own nose; but the nose\nwas no longer there. He had had time to go, doubtless in order to\ncontinue his visits.\n\nHis disappearance plunged Kovaloff into despair. He went back and stood\nfor a moment under a colonnade, looking round him on all sides in hope\nof perceiving the nose somewhere. He remembered very well that it wore a\nhat with a plume in it and a gold-embroidered uniform; but he had not\nnoticed the shape of the cloak, nor the colour of the carriages and the\nhorses, nor even whether a lackey stood behind it, and, if so, what sort\nof livery he wore. Moreover, so many carriages were passing that it\nwould have been difficult to recognise one, and even if he had done so,\nthere would have been no means of stopping it.\n\nThe day was fine and sunny. An immense crowd was passing to and fro in\nthe Neffsky Avenue; a variegated stream of ladies flowed along the\npavement. There was his acquaintance, the Privy Councillor, whom he was\naccustomed to style \"General,\" especially when strangers were present.\nThere was Iarygin, his intimate friend who always lost in the evenings\nat whist; and there another Major, who had obtained the rank of\ncommittee-man in the Caucasus, beckoned to him.\n\n\"Go to the deuce!\" said Kovaloff _sotto voce_. \"Hi! coachman, drive me\nstraight to the superintendent of police.\" So saying, he got into a\ndroshky and continued to shout all the time to the coachman \"Drive\nhard!\"\n\n\"Is the police superintendent at home?\" he asked on entering the front\nhall.\n\n\"No, sir,\" answered the porter, \"he has just gone out.\"\n\n\"Ah, just as I thought!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" continued the porter, \"he has only just gone out; if you had been\na moment earlier you would perhaps have caught him.\"\n\nKovaloff, still holding his handkerchief to his face, re-entered the\ndroshky and cried in a despairing voice \"Drive on!\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked the coachman.\n\n\"Straight on!\"\n\n\"But how? There are cross-roads here. Shall I go to the right or the\nleft?\"\n\nThis question made Kovaloff reflect. In his situation it was necessary\nto have recourse to the police; not because the affair had anything to\ndo with them directly but because they acted more promptly than other\nauthorities. As for demanding any explanation from the department to\nwhich the nose claimed to belong, it would, he felt, be useless, for the\nanswers of that gentleman showed that he regarded nothing as sacred, and\nhe might just as likely have lied in this matter as in saying that he\nhad never seen Kovaloff.\n\nBut just as he was about to order the coachman to drive to the\npolice-station, the idea occurred to him that this rascally scoundrel\nwho, at their first meeting, had behaved so disloyally towards him,\nmight, profiting by the delay, quit the city secretly; and then all his\nsearching would be in vain, or might last over a whole month. Finally,\nas though visited with a heavenly inspiration, he resolved to go\ndirectly to an advertisement office, and to advertise the loss of his\nnose, giving all its distinctive characteristics in detail, so that\nanyone who found it might bring it at once to him, or at any rate inform\nhim where it lived. Having decided on this course, he ordered the\ncoachman to drive to the advertisement office, and all the way he\ncontinued to punch him in the back--\"Quick, scoundrel! quick!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" answered the coachman, lashing his shaggy horse with the\nreins.\n\nAt last they arrived, and Kovaloff, out of breath, rushed into a little\nroom where a grey-haired official, in an old coat and with spectacles on\nhis nose, sat at a table holding his pen between his teeth, counting a\nheap of copper coins.\n\n\"Who takes in the advertisements here?\" exclaimed Kovaloff.\n\n\"At your service, sir,\" answered the grey-haired functionary, looking up\nand then fastening his eyes again on the heap of coins before him.\n\n\"I wish to place an advertisement in your paper----\"\n\n\"Have the kindness to wait a minute,\" answered the official, putting\ndown figures on paper with one hand, and with the other moving two balls\non his calculating-frame.\n\nA lackey, whose silver-laced coat showed that he served in one of the\nhouses of the nobility, was standing by the table with a note in his\nhand, and speaking in a lively tone, by way of showing himself sociable.\n\"Would you believe it, sir, this little dog is really not worth\ntwenty-four kopecks, and for my own part I would not give a farthing for\nit; but the countess is quite gone upon it, and offers a hundred\nroubles' reward to anyone who finds it. To tell you the truth, the\ntastes of these people are very different from ours; they don't mind\ngiving five hundred or a thousand roubles for a poodle or a pointer,\nprovided it be a good one.\"\n\nThe official listened with a serious air while counting the number of\nletters contained in the note. At either side of the table stood a\nnumber of housekeepers, clerks and porters, carrying notes. The writer\nof one wished to sell a barouche, which had been brought from Paris in\n1814 and had been very little used; others wanted to dispose of a strong\ndroshky which wanted one spring, a spirited horse seventeen years old,\nand so on. The room where these people were collected was very small,\nand the air was very close; but Kovaloff was not affected by it, for he\nhad covered his face with a handkerchief, and because his nose itself\nwas heaven knew where.\n\n\"Sir, allow me to ask you--I am in a great hurry,\" he said at last\nimpatiently.\n\n\"In a moment! In a moment! Two roubles, twenty-four kopecks--one minute!\nOne rouble, sixty-four kopecks!\" said the grey-haired official, throwing\ntheir notes back to the housekeepers and porters. \"What do you wish?\" he\nsaid, turning to Kovaloff.\n\n\"I wish--\" answered the latter, \"I have just been swindled and cheated,\nand I cannot get hold of the perpetrator. I only want you to insert an\nadvertisement to say that whoever brings this scoundrel to me will be\nwell rewarded.\"\n\n\"What is your name, please?\"\n\n\"Why do you want my name? I have many lady friends--Madame Tchektyriev,\nwife of a state-councillor, Madame Podtotchina, wife of a Colonel.\nHeaven forbid that they should get to hear of it. You can simply write\n'committee-man,' or, better, 'Major.'\"\n\n\"And the man who has run away is your serf.\"\n\n\"Serf! If he was, it would not be such a great swindle! It is the nose\nwhich has absconded.\"\n\n\"H'm! What a strange name. And this Mr Nose has stolen from you a\nconsiderable sum?\"\n\n\"Mr Nose! Ah, you don't understand me! It is my own nose which has gone,\nI don't know where. The devil has played a trick on me.\"\n\n\"How has it disappeared? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"I can't tell you how, but the important point is that now it walks\nabout the city itself a state-councillor. That is why I want you to\nadvertise that whoever gets hold of it should bring it as soon as\npossible to me. Consider; how can I live without such a prominent part\nof my body? It is not as if it were merely a little toe; I would only\nhave to put my foot in my boot and no one would notice its absence.\nEvery Thursday I call on the wife of M. Tchektyriev, the\nstate-councillor; Madame Podtotchina, a Colonel's wife who has a very\npretty daughter, is one of my acquaintances; and what am I to do now? I\ncannot appear before them like this.\"\n\nThe official compressed his lips and reflected. \"No, I cannot insert an\nadvertisement like that,\" he said after a long pause.\n\n\"What! Why not?\"\n\n\"Because it might compromise the paper. Suppose everyone could advertise\nthat his nose was lost. People already say that all sorts of nonsense\nand lies are inserted.\"\n\n\"But this is not nonsense! There is nothing of that sort in my case.\"\n\n\"You think so? Listen a minute. Last week there was a case very like it.\nAn official came, just as you have done, bringing an advertisement for\nthe insertion of which he paid two roubles, sixty-three kopecks; and\nthis advertisement simply announced the loss of a black-haired poodle.\nThere did not seem to be anything out of the way in it, but it was\nreally a satire; by the poodle was meant the cashier of some\nestablishment or other.\"\n\n\"But I am not talking of a poodle, but my own nose; i.e. almost myself.\"\n\n\"No, I cannot insert your advertisement.\"\n\n\"But my nose really has disappeared!\"\n\n\"That is a matter for a doctor. There are said to be people who can\nprovide you with any kind of nose you like. But I see that you are a\nwitty man, and like to have your little joke.\"\n\n\"But I swear to you on my word of honour. Look at my face yourself.\"\n\n\"Why put yourself out?\" continued the official, taking a pinch of snuff.\n\"All the same, if you don't mind,\" he added with a touch of curiosity,\n\"I should like to have a look at it.\"\n\nThe committee-man removed the handkerchief from before his face.\n\n\"It certainly does look odd,\" said the official. \"It is perfectly flat\nlike a freshly fried pancake. It is hardly credible.\"\n\n\"Very well. Are you going to hesitate any more? You see it is impossible\nto refuse to advertise my loss. I shall be particularly obliged to you,\nand I shall be glad that this incident has procured me the pleasure of\nmaking your acquaintance.\" The Major, we see, did not even shrink from a\nslight humiliation.\n\n\"It certainly is not difficult to advertise it,\" replied the official;\n\"but I don't see what good it would do you. However, if you lay so much\nstress on it, you should apply to someone who has a skilful pen, so that\nhe may describe it as a curious, natural freak, and publish the article\nin the _Northern Bee_\" (here he took another pinch) \"for the benefit of\nyouthful readers\" (he wiped his nose), \"or simply as a matter worthy of\narousing public curiosity.\"\n\nThe committee-man felt completely discouraged. He let his eyes fall\nabsent-mindedly on a daily paper in which theatrical performances were\nadvertised. Reading there the name of an actress whom he knew to be\npretty, he involuntarily smiled, and his hand sought his pocket to see\nif he had a blue ticket--for in Kovaloff's opinion superior officers\nlike himself should not take a lesser-priced seat; but the thought of\nhis lost nose suddenly spoilt everything.\n\nThe official himself seemed touched at his difficult position. Desiring\nto console him, he tried to express his sympathy by a few polite words.\n\"I much regret,\" he said, \"your extraordinary mishap. Will you not try a\npinch of snuff? It clears the head, banishes depression, and is a good\npreventive against haemorrhoids.\"\n\nSo saying, he reached his snuff-box out to Kovaloff, skilfully\nconcealing at the same time the cover, which was adorned with the\nportrait of some lady or other.\n\nThis act, quite innocent in itself, exasperated Kovaloff. \"I don't\nunderstand what you find to joke about in the matter,\" he exclaimed\nangrily. \"Don't you see that I lack precisely the essential feature for\ntaking snuff? The devil take your snuff-box. I don't want to look at\nsnuff now, not even the best, certainly not your vile stuff!\"\n\nSo saying, he left the advertisement office in a state of profound\nirritation, and went to the commissary of police. He arrived just as\nthis dignitary was reclining on his couch, and saying to himself with a\nsigh of satisfaction, \"Yes, I shall make a nice little sum out of that.\"\n\nIt might be expected, therefore, that the committee-man's visit would be\nquite inopportune.\n\nThis police commissary was a great patron of all the arts and\nindustries; but what he liked above everything else was a cheque. \"It is\na thing,\" he used to say, \"to which it is not easy to find an\nequivalent; it requires no food, it does not take up much room, it stays\nin one's pocket, and if it falls, it is not broken.\"\n\nThe commissary accorded Kovaloff a fairly frigid reception, saying that\nthe afternoon was not the best time to come with a case, that nature\nrequired one to rest a little after eating (this showed the\ncommittee-man that the commissary was acquainted with the aphorisms of\nthe ancient sages), and that respectable people did not have their noses\nstolen.\n\nThe last allusion was too direct. We must remember that Kovaloff was a\nvery sensitive man. He did not mind anything said against him as an\nindividual, but he could not endure any reflection on his rank or social\nposition. He even believed that in comedies one might allow attacks on\njunior officers, but never on their seniors.\n\nThe commissary's reception of him hurt his feelings so much that he\nraised his head proudly, and said with dignity, \"After such insulting\nexpressions on your part, I have nothing more to say.\" And he left the\nplace.\n\nHe reached his house quite wearied out. It was already growing dark.\nAfter all his fruitless search, his room seemed to him melancholy and\neven ugly. In the vestibule he saw his valet Ivan stretched on the\nleather couch and amusing himself by spitting at the ceiling, which he\ndid very cleverly, hitting every time the same spot. His servant's\nequanimity enraged him; he struck him on the forehead with his hat, and\nsaid, \"You good-for-nothing, you are always playing the fool!\"\n\nIvan rose quickly and hastened to take off his master's cloak.\n\nOnce in his room, the Major, tired and depressed, threw himself in an\narmchair and, after sighing a while, began to soliloquise:\n\n\"In heaven's name, why should such a misfortune befall me? If I had lost\nan arm or a leg, it would be less insupportable; but a man without a\nnose! Devil take it!--what is he good for? He is only fit to be thrown\nout of the window. If it had been taken from me in war or in a duel, or\nif I had lost it by my own fault! But it has disappeared inexplicably.\nBut no! it is impossible,\" he continued after reflecting a few moments,\n\"it is incredible that a nose can disappear like that--quite incredible.\nI must be dreaming, or suffering from some hallucination; perhaps I\nswallowed, by mistake instead of water, the brandy with which I rub my\nchin after being shaved. That fool of an Ivan must have forgotten to\ntake it away, and I must have swallowed it.\"\n\nIn order to find out whether he were really drunk, the Major pinched\nhimself so hard that he unvoluntarily uttered a cry. The pain convinced\nhim that he was quite wide awake. He walked slowly to the looking-glass\nand at first closed his eyes, hoping to see his nose suddenly in its\nproper place; but on opening them, he started back. \"What a hideous\nsight!\" he exclaimed.\n\nIt was really incomprehensible. One might easily lose a button, a silver\nspoon, a watch, or something similar; but a loss like this, and in one's\nown dwelling!\n\nAfter considering all the circumstances, Major Kovaloff felt inclined to\nsuppose that the cause of all his trouble should be laid at the door of\nMadame Podtotchina, the Colonel's wife, who wished him to marry her\ndaughter. He himself paid her court readily, but always avoided coming\nto the point. And when the lady one day told him point-blank that she\nwished him to marry her daughter, he gently drew back, declaring that he\nwas still too young, and that he had to serve five years more before he\nwould be forty-two. This must be the reason why the lady, in revenge,\nhad resolved to bring him into disgrace, and had hired two sorceresses\nfor that object. One thing was certain--his nose had not been cut off;\nno one had entered his room, and as for Ivan Jakovlevitch--he had been\nshaved by him on Wednesday, and during that day and the whole of\nThursday his nose had been there, as he knew and well remembered.\nMoreover, if his nose had been cut off he would naturally have felt\npain, and doubtless the wound would not have healed so quickly, nor\nwould the surface have been as flat as a pancake.\n\nAll kinds of plans passed through his head: should he bring a legal\naction against the wife of a superior officer, or should he go to her\nand charge her openly with her treachery?\n\nHis reflections were interrupted by a sudden light, which shone through\nall the chinks of the door, showing that Ivan had lit the wax-candles in\nthe vestibule. Soon Ivan himself came in with the lights. Kovaloff\nquickly seized a handkerchief and covered the place where his nose had\nbeen the evening before, so that his blockhead of a servant might not\ngape with his mouth wide open when he saw his master's extraordinary\nappearance.\n\nScarcely had Ivan returned to the vestibule than a stranger's voice was\nheard there.\n\n\"Does Major Kovaloff live here?\" it asked.\n\n\"Come in!\" said the Major, rising rapidly and opening the door.\n\nHe saw a police official of pleasant appearance, with grey whiskers and\nfairly full cheeks--the same who at the commencement of this story was\nstanding at the end of the Isaac Bridge. \"You have lost your nose?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Exactly so.\"\n\n\"It has just been found.\"\n\n\"What--do you say?\" stammered Major Kovaloff.\n\nJoy had suddenly paralysed his tongue. He stared at the police\ncommissary on whose cheeks and full lips fell the flickering light of\nthe candle.\n\n\"How was it?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"By a very singular chance. It has been arrested just as it was getting\ninto a carriage for Riga. Its passport had been made out some time ago\nin the name of an official; and what is still more strange, I myself\ntook it at first for a gentleman. Fortunately I had my glasses with me,\nand then I saw at once that it was a nose. I am shortsighted, you know,\nand as you stand before me I cannot distinguish your nose, your beard,\nor anything else. My mother-in-law can hardly see at all.\"\n\nKovaloff was beside himself with excitement. \"Where is it? Where? I will\nhasten there at once.\"\n\n\"Don't put yourself out. Knowing that you need it, I have brought it\nwith me. Another singular thing is that the principal culprit in the\nmatter is a scoundrel of a barber living in the Ascension Avenue, who is\nnow safely locked up. I had long suspected him of drunkenness and theft;\nonly the day before yesterday he stole some buttons in a shop. Your nose\nis quite uninjured.\" So saying, the police commissary put his hand in\nhis pocket and brought out the nose wrapped up in paper.\n\n\"Yes, yes, that is it!\" exclaimed Kovaloff. \"Will you not stay and drink\na cup of tea with me?\"\n\n\"I should like to very much, but I cannot. I must go at once to the\nHouse of Correction. The cost of living is very high nowadays. My\nmother-in-law lives with me, and there are several children; the eldest\nis very hopeful and intelligent, but I have no means for their\neducation.\"\n\nAfter the commissary's departure, Kovaloff remained for some time\nplunged in a kind of vague reverie, and did not recover full\nconsciousness for several moments, so great was the effect of this\nunexpected good news. He placed the recovered nose carefully in the palm\nof his hand, and examined it again with the greatest attention.\n\n\"Yes, this is it!\" he said to himself. \"Here is the heat-boil on the\nleft side, which came out yesterday.\" And he nearly laughed aloud with\ndelight.\n\nBut nothing is permanent in this world. Joy in the second moment of its\narrival is already less keen than in the first, is still fainter in the\nthird, and finishes by coalescing with our normal mental state, just as\nthe circles which the fall of a pebble forms on the surface of water,\ngradually die away. Kovaloff began to meditate, and saw that his\ndifficulties were not yet over; his nose had been recovered, but it had\nto be joined on again in its proper place.\n\nAnd suppose it could not? As he put this question to himself, Kovaloff\ngrew pale. With a feeling of indescribable dread, he rushed towards his\ndressing-table, and stood before the mirror in order that he might not\nplace his nose crookedly. His hands trembled.\n\nVery carefully he placed it where it had been before. Horror! It did not\nremain there. He held it to his mouth and warmed it a little with his\nbreath, and then placed it there again; but it would not hold.\n\n\"Hold on, you stupid!\" he said.\n\nBut the nose seemed to be made of wood, and fell back on the table with\na strange noise, as though it had been a cork. The Major's face began to\ntwitch feverishly. \"Is it possible that it won't stick?\" he asked\nhimself, full of alarm. But however often he tried, all his efforts were\nin vain.\n\nHe called Ivan, and sent him to fetch the doctor who occupied the finest\nflat in the mansion. This doctor was a man of imposing appearance, who\nhad magnificent black whiskers and a healthy wife. He ate fresh apples\nevery morning, and cleaned his teeth with extreme care, using five\ndifferent tooth-brushes for three-quarters of an hour daily.\n\nThe doctor came immediately. After having asked the Major when this\nmisfortune had happened, he raised his chin and gave him a fillip with\nhis finger just where the nose had been, in such a way that the Major\nsuddenly threw back his head and struck the wall with it. The doctor\nsaid that did not matter; then, making him turn his face to the right,\nhe felt the vacant place and said \"H'm!\" then he made him turn it to the\nleft and did the same; finally he again gave him a fillip with his\nfinger, so that the Major started like a horse whose teeth are being\nexamined. After this experiment, the doctor shook his head and said,\n\"No, it cannot be done. Rather remain as you are, lest something worse\nhappen. Certainly one could replace it at once, but I assure you the\nremedy would be worse than the disease.\"\n\n\"All very fine, but how am I to go on without a nose?\" answered\nKovaloff. \"There is nothing worse than that. How can I show myself with\nsuch a villainous appearance? I go into good society, and this evening I\nam invited to two parties. I know several ladies, Madame Tchektyriev,\nthe wife of a state-councillor, Madame Podtotchina--although after what\nshe has done, I don't want to have anything to do with her except\nthrough the agency of the police. I beg you,\" continued Kovaloff in a\nsupplicating tone, \"find some way or other of replacing it; even if it\nis not quite firm, as long as it holds at all; I can keep it in place\nsometimes with my hand, whenever there is any risk. Besides, I do not\neven dance, so that it is not likely to be injured by any sudden\nmovement. As to your fee, be in no anxiety about that; I can well afford\nit.\"\n\n\"Believe me,\" answered the doctor in a voice which was neither too high\nnor too low, but soft and almost magnetic, \"I do not treat patients from\nlove of gain. That would be contrary to my principles and to my art. It\nis true that I accept fees, but that is only not to hurt my patients'\nfeelings by refusing them. I could certainly replace your nose, but I\nassure you on my word of honour, it would only make matters worse.\nRather let Nature do her own work. Wash the place often with cold water,\nand I assure you that even without a nose, you will be just as well as\nif you had one. As to the nose itself, I advise you to have it preserved\nin a bottle of spirits, or, still better, of warm vinegar mixed with two\nspoonfuls of brandy, and then you can sell it at a good price. I would\nbe willing to take it myself, provided you do not ask too much.\"\n\n\"No, no, I shall not sell it at any price. I would rather it were lost\nagain.\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said the doctor, taking his leave. \"I hoped to be useful to\nyou, but I can do nothing more; you are at any rate convinced of my\ngood-will.\" So saying, the doctor left the room with a dignified air.\n\nKovaloff did not even notice his departure. Absorbed in a profound\nreverie, he only saw the edge of his snow-white cuffs emerging from the\nsleeves of his black coat.\n\nThe next day he resolved, before bringing a formal action, to write to\nthe Colonel's wife and see whether she would not return to him, without\nfurther dispute, that of which she had deprived him.\n\nThe letter ran as follows:\n\n    \"To Madame Alexandra Podtotchina,\n\n    \"I hardly understand your method of action. Be sure that by adopting\n    such a course you will gain nothing, and will certainly not succeed\n    in making me marry your daughter. Believe me, the story of my nose\n    has become well known; it is you and no one else who have taken the\n    principal part in it. Its unexpected separation from the place which\n    it occupied, its flight and its appearances sometimes in the\n    disguise of an official, sometimes in proper person, are nothing but\n    the consequence of unholy spells employed by you or by persons who,\n    like you, are addicted to such honourable pursuits. On my part, I\n    wish to inform you, that if the above-mentioned nose is not restored\n    to-day to its proper place, I shall be obliged to have recourse to\n    legal procedure.\n\n    \"For the rest, with all respect, I have the honour to be your humble\n    servant,\n\n    \"Platon Kovaloff.\"\n\nThe reply was not long in coming, and was as follows:\n\n    \"Major Platon Kovaloff,--\n\n    \"Your letter has profoundly astonished me. I must confess that I had\n    not expected such unjust reproaches on your part. I assure you that\n    the official of whom you speak has not been at my house, either\n    disguised or in his proper person. It is true that Philippe\n    Ivanovitch Potantchikoff has paid visits at my house, and though he\n    has actually asked for my daughter's hand, and was a man of good\n    breeding, respectable and intelligent, I never gave him any hope.\n\n    \"Again, you say something about a nose. If you intend to imply by\n    that that I wished to snub you, i.e. to meet you with a refusal, I\n    am very astonished because, as you well know, I was quite of the\n    opposite mind. If after this you wish to ask for my daughter's hand,\n    I should be glad to gratify you, for such has also been the object\n    of my most fervent desire, in the hope of the accomplishment of\n    which, I remain, yours most sincerely,\n\n    \"Alexandra Podtotchina.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Kovaloff, after having reperused the letter, \"she is\ncertainly not guilty. It is impossible. Such a letter could not be\nwritten by a criminal.\" The committee-man was experienced in such\nmatters, for he had been often officially deputed to conduct criminal\ninvestigations while in the Caucasus. \"But then how and by what trick of\nfate has the thing happened?\" he said to himself with a gesture of\ndiscouragement. \"The devil must be at the bottom of it.\"\n\nMeanwhile the rumour of this extraordinary event had spread all over the\ncity, and, as is generally the case, not without numerous additions. At\nthat period there was a general disposition to believe in the\nmiraculous; the public had recently been impressed by experiments in\nmagnetism. The story of the floating chairs in Koniouchennaia Street was\nstill quite recent, and there was nothing astonishing in hearing soon\nafterwards that Major Kovaloff's nose was to be seen walking every day\nat three o'clock on the Neffsky Avenue. The crowd of curious spectators\nwhich gathered there daily was enormous. On one occasion someone spread\na report that the nose was in Junker's stores and immediately the place\nwas besieged by such a crowd that the police had to interfere and\nestablish order. A certain speculator with a grave, whiskered face, who\nsold cakes at a theatre door, had some strong wooden benches made which\nhe placed before the window of the stores, and obligingly invited the\npublic to stand on them and look in, at the modest charge of twenty-four\nkopecks. A veteran colonel, leaving his house earlier than usual\nexpressly for the purpose, had the greatest difficulty in elbowing his\nway through the crowd, but to his great indignation he saw nothing in\nthe store window but an ordinary flannel waistcoat and a coloured\nlithograph representing a young girl darning a stocking, while an\nelegant youth in a waistcoat with large lappels watched her from behind\na tree. The picture had hung in the same place for more than ten years.\nThe colonel went off, growling savagely to himself, \"How can the fools\nlet themselves be excited by such idiotic stories?\"\n\nThen another rumour got abroad, to the effect that the nose of Major\nKovaloff was in the habit of walking not on the Neffsky Avenue but in\nthe Tauris Gardens. Some students of the Academy of Surgery went there\non purpose to see it. A high-born lady wrote to the keeper of the\ngardens asking him to show her children this rare phenomenon, and to\ngive them some suitable instruction on the occasion.\n\nAll these incidents were eagerly collected by the town wits, who just\nthen were very short of anecdotes adapted to amuse ladies. On the other\nhand, the minority of solid, sober people were very much displeased. One\ngentleman asserted with great indignation that he could not understand\nhow in our enlightened age such absurdities could spread abroad, and he\nwas astonished that the Government did not direct their attention to the\nmatter. This gentleman evidently belonged to the category of those\npeople who wish the Government to interfere in everything, even in their\ndaily quarrels with their wives.\n\nBut here the course of events is again obscured by a veil.\n\n\nIII\n\nStrange events happen in this world, events which are sometimes entirely\nimprobable. The same nose which had masqueraded as a state-councillor,\nand caused so much sensation in the town, was found one morning in its\nproper place, i.e. between the cheeks of Major Kovaloff, as if nothing\nhad happened.\n\nThis occurred on 7th April. On awaking, the Major looked by chance into\na mirror and perceived a nose. He quickly put his hand to it; it was\nthere beyond a doubt!\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Kovaloff. For sheer joy he was on the point of\nperforming a dance barefooted across his room, but the entrance of Ivan\nprevented him. He told him to bring water, and after washing himself, he\nlooked again in the glass. The nose was there! Then he dried his face\nwith a towel and looked again. Yes, there was no mistake about it!\n\n\"Look here, Ivan, it seems to me that I have a heat-boil on my nose,\" he\nsaid to his valet.\n\nAnd he thought to himself at the same time, \"That will be a nice\nbusiness if Ivan says to me 'No, sir, not only is there no boil, but\nyour nose itself is not there!'\"\n\nBut Ivan answered, \"There is nothing, sir; I can see no boil on your\nnose.\"\n\n\"Good! Good!\" exclaimed the Major, and snapped his fingers with delight.\n\nAt this moment the barber, Ivan Jakovlevitch, put his head in at the\ndoor, but as timidly as a cat which has just been beaten for stealing\nlard.\n\n\"Tell me first, are your hands clean?\" asked Kovaloff when he saw him.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You lie.\"\n\n\"I swear they are perfectly clean, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well; then come here.\"\n\nKovaloff seated himself. Jakovlevitch tied a napkin under his chin, and\nin the twinkling of an eye covered his beard and part of his cheeks with\na copious creamy lather.\n\n\"There it is!\" said the barber to himself, as he glanced at the nose.\nThen he bent his head a little and examined it from one side. \"Yes, it\nactually is the nose--really, when one thinks----\" he continued,\npursuing his mental soliloquy and still looking at it. Then quite\ngently, with infinite precaution, he raised two fingers in the air in\norder to take hold of it by the extremity, as he was accustomed to do.\n\n\"Now then, take care!\" Kovaloff exclaimed.\n\nIvan Jakovlevitch let his arm fall and felt more embarrassed than he had\never done in his life. At last he began to pass the razor very lightly\nover the Major's chin, and although it was very difficult to shave him\nwithout using the olfactory organ as a point of support, he succeeded,\nhowever, by placing his wrinkled thumb against the Major's lower jaw and\ncheek, thus overcoming all obstacles and bringing his task to a safe\nconclusion.\n\nWhen the barber had finished, Kovaloff hastened to dress himself, took a\ndroshky, and drove straight to the confectioner's. As he entered it, he\nordered a cup of chocolate. He then stepped straight to the mirror; the\nnose was there!\n\nHe returned joyfully, and regarded with a satirical expression two\nofficers who were in the shop, one of whom possessed a nose not much\nlarger than a waistcoat button.\n\nAfter that he went to the office of the department where he had applied\nfor the post of vice-governor of a province or Government bailiff. As he\npassed through the hall of reception, he cast a glance at the mirror;\nthe nose was there! Then he went to pay a visit to another\ncommittee-man, a very sarcastic personage, to whom he was accustomed to\nsay in answer to his raillery, \"Yes, I know, you are the funniest fellow\nin St Petersburg.\"\n\nOn the way he said to himself, \"If the Major does not burst into\nlaughter at the sight of me, that is a most certain sign that everything\nis in its accustomed place.\"\n\nBut the Major said nothing. \"Very good!\" thought Kovaloff.\n\nAs he returned, he met Madame Podtotchina with her daughter. He accosted\nthem, and they responded very graciously. The conversation lasted a long\ntime, during which he took more than one pinch of snuff, saying to\nhimself, \"No, you haven't caught me yet, coquettes that you are! And as\nto the daughter, I shan't marry her at all.\"\n\nAfter that, the Major resumed his walks on the Neffsky Avenue and his\nvisits to the theatre as if nothing had happened. His nose also remained\nin its place as if it had never quitted it. From that time he was always\nto be seen smiling, in a good humour, and paying attentions to pretty\ngirls.\n\n\nIV\n\nSuch was the occurrence which took place in the northern capital of our\nvast empire. On considering the account carefully we see that there is a\ngood deal which looks improbable about it. Not to speak of the strange\ndisappearance of the nose, and its appearance in different places under\nthe disguise of a councillor of state, how was it that Kovaloff did not\nunderstand that one cannot decently advertise for a lost nose? I do not\nmean to say that he would have had to pay too much for the\nadvertisement--that is a mere trifle, and I am not one of those who\nattach too much importance to money; but to advertise in such a case is\nnot proper nor befitting.\n\nAnother difficulty is--how was the nose found in the baked loaf, and how\ndid Ivan Jakovlevitch himself--no, I don't understand it at all!\n\nBut the most incomprehensible thing of all is, how authors can choose\nsuch subjects for their stories. That really surpasses my understanding.\nIn the first place, no advantage results from it for the country; and in\nthe second place, no harm results either.\n\nAll the same, when one reflects well, there really is something in the\nmatter. Whatever may be said to the contrary, such cases do\noccur--rarely, it is true, but now and then actually.\n\n\n\n\nMEMOIRS OF A MADMAN\n\n\n_October 3rd._--A strange occurrence has taken place to-day. I got up\nfairly late, and when Mawra brought me my clean boots, I asked her how\nlate it was. When I heard it had long struck ten, I dressed as quickly\nas possible.\n\nTo tell the truth, I would rather not have gone to the office at all\nto-day, for I know beforehand that our department-chief will look as\nsour as vinegar. For some time past he has been in the habit of saying\nto me, \"Look here, my friend; there is something wrong with your head.\nYou often rush about as though you were possessed. Then you make such\nconfused abstracts of the documents that the devil himself cannot make\nthem out; you write the title without any capital letters, and add\nneither the date nor the docket-number.\" The long-legged scoundrel! He\nis certainly envious of me, because I sit in the director's work-room,\nand mend His Excellency's pens. In a word, I should not have gone to the\noffice if I had not hoped to meet the accountant, and perhaps squeeze a\nlittle advance out of this skinflint.\n\nA terrible man, this accountant! As for his advancing one's salary once\nin a way--you might sooner expect the skies to fall. You may beg and\nbeseech him, and be on the very verge of ruin--this grey devil won't\nbudge an inch. At the same time, his own cook at home, as all the world\nknows, boxes his ears.\n\nI really don't see what good one gets by serving in our department.\nThere are no plums there. In the fiscal and judicial offices it is quite\ndifferent. There some ungainly fellow sits in a corner and writes and\nwrites; he has such a shabby coat and such an ugly mug that one would\nlike to spit on both of them. But you should see what a splendid\ncountry-house he has rented. He would not condescend to accept a gilt\nporcelain cup as a present. \"You can give that to your family doctor,\"\nhe would say. Nothing less than a pair of chestnut horses, a fine\ncarriage, or a beaver-fur coat worth three hundred roubles would be good\nenough for him. And yet he seems so mild and quiet, and asks so amiably,\n\"Please lend me your penknife; I wish to mend my pen.\" Nevertheless, he\nknows how to scarify a petitioner till he has hardly a whole stitch left\non his body.\n\nIn our office it must be admitted everything is done in a proper and\ngentlemanly way; there is more cleanness and elegance than one will ever\nfind in Government offices. The tables are mahogany, and everyone is\naddressed as \"sir.\" And truly, were it not for this official propriety,\nI should long ago have sent in my resignation.\n\nI put on my old cloak, and took my umbrella, as a light rain was\nfalling. No one was to be seen on the streets except some women, who had\nflung their skirts over their heads. Here and there one saw a cabman or\na shopman with his umbrella up. Of the higher classes one only saw an\nofficial here and there. One I saw at the street-crossing, and thought\nto myself, \"Ah! my friend, you are not going to the office, but after\nthat young lady who walks in front of you. You are just like the\nofficers who run after every petticoat they see.\"\n\nAs I was thus following the train of my thoughts, I saw a carriage stop\nbefore a shop just as I was passing it. I recognised it at once; it was\nour director's carriage. \"He has nothing to do in the shop,\" I said to\nmyself; \"it must be his daughter.\"\n\nI pressed myself close against the wall. A lackey opened the carriage\ndoor, and, as I had expected, she fluttered like a bird out of it. How\nproudly she looked right and left; how she drew her eyebrows together,\nand shot lightnings from her eyes--good heavens! I am lost, hopelessly\nlost!\n\nBut why must she come out in such abominable weather? And yet they say\nwomen are so mad on their finery!\n\nShe did not recognise me. I had wrapped myself as closely as possible in\nmy cloak. It was dirty and old-fashioned, and I would not have liked to\nhave been seen by her wearing it. Now they wear cloaks with long\ncollars, but mine has only a short double collar, and the cloth is of\ninferior quality.\n\nHer little dog could not get into the shop, and remained outside. I know\nthis dog; its name is \"Meggy.\"\n\nBefore I had been standing there a minute, I heard a voice call, \"Good\nday, Meggy!\"\n\nWho the deuce was that? I looked round and saw two ladies hurrying by\nunder an umbrella--one old, the other fairly young. They had already\npassed me when I heard the same voice say again, \"For shame, Meggy!\"\n\nWhat was that? I saw Meggy sniffing at a dog which ran behind the\nladies. The deuce! I thought to myself, \"I am not drunk? That happens\npretty seldom.\"\n\n\"No, Fidel, you are wrong,\" I heard Meggy say quite distinctly. \"I\nwas--bow--wow!--I was--bow! wow! wow!--very ill.\"\n\nWhat an extraordinary dog! I was, to tell the truth, quite amazed to\nhear it talk human language. But when I considered the matter well, I\nceased to be astonished. In fact, such things have already happened in\nthe world. It is said that in England a fish put its head out of water\nand said a word or two in such an extraordinary language that learned\nmen have been puzzling over them for three years, and have not succeeded\nin interpreting them yet. I also read in the paper of two cows who\nentered a shop and asked for a pound of tea.\n\nMeanwhile what Meggy went on to say seemed to me still more remarkable.\nShe added, \"I wrote to you lately, Fidel; perhaps Polkan did not bring\nyou the letter.\"\n\nNow I am willing to forfeit a whole month's salary if I ever heard of\ndogs writing before. This has certainly astonished me. For some little\ntime past I hear and see things which no other man has heard and seen.\n\n\"I will,\" I thought, \"follow that dog in order to get to the bottom of\nthe matter. Accordingly, I opened my umbrella and went after the two\nladies. They went down Bean Street, turned through Citizen Street and\nCarpenter Street, and finally halted on the Cuckoo Bridge before a large\nhouse. I know this house; it is Sverkoff's. What a monster he is! What\nsort of people live there! How many cooks, how many bagmen! There are\nbrother officials of mine also there packed on each other like herrings.\nAnd I have a friend there, a fine player on the cornet.\"\n\nThe ladies mounted to the fifth story. \"Very good,\" thought I; \"I will\nmake a note of the number, in order to follow up the matter at the first\nopportunity.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_October 4th._--To-day is Wednesday, and I was as usual in the office. I\ncame early on purpose, sat down, and mended all the pens.\n\nOur director must be a very clever man. The whole room is full of\nbookcases. I read the titles of some of the books; they were very\nlearned, beyond the comprehension of people of my class, and all in\nFrench and German. I look at his face; see! how much dignity there is in\nhis eyes. I never hear a single superfluous word from his mouth, except\nthat when he hands over the documents, he asks \"What sort of weather is\nit?\"\n\nNo, he is not a man of our class; he is a real statesman. I have already\nnoticed that I am a special favourite of his. If now his daughter\nalso--ah! what folly--let me say no more about it!\n\nI have read the _Northern Bee_. What foolish people the French are! By\nheavens! I should like to tackle them all, and give them a thrashing. I\nhave also read a fine description of a ball given by a landowner of\nKursk. The landowners of Kursk write a fine style.\n\nThen I noticed that it was already half-past twelve, and the director\nhad not yet left his bedroom. But about half-past one something happened\nwhich no pen can describe.\n\nThe door opened. I thought it was the director; I jumped up with my\ndocuments from the seat, and--then--she--herself--came into the room. Ye\nsaints! how beautifully she was dressed. Her garments were whiter than a\nswan's plumage--oh how splendid! A sun, indeed, a real sun!\n\nShe greeted me and asked, \"Has not my father come yet?\"\n\nAh! what a voice. A canary bird! A real canary bird!\n\n\"Your Excellency,\" I wanted to exclaim, \"don't have me executed, but if\nit must be done, then kill me rather with your own angelic hand.\" But,\nGod knows why, I could not bring it out, so I only said, \"No, he has not\ncome yet.\"\n\nShe glanced at me, looked at the books, and let her handkerchief fall.\nInstantly I started up, but slipped on the infernal polished floor, and\nnearly broke my nose. Still I succeeded in picking up the handkerchief.\nYe heavenly choirs, what a handkerchief! So tender and soft, of the\nfinest cambric. It had the scent of a general's rank!\n\nShe thanked me, and smiled so amiably that her sugar lips nearly melted.\nThen she left the room.\n\nAfter I had sat there about an hour, a flunkey came in and said, \"You\ncan go home, Mr Ivanovitch; the director has already gone out!\"\n\nI cannot stand these lackeys! They hang about the vestibules, and\nscarcely vouchsafe to greet one with a nod. Yes, sometimes it is even\nworse; once one of these rascals offered me his snuff-box without even\ngetting up from his chair. \"Don't you know then, you country-bumpkin,\nthat I am an official and of aristocratic birth?\"\n\nThis time, however, I took my hat and overcoat quietly; these people\nnaturally never think of helping one on with it. I went home, lay a good\nwhile on the bed, and wrote some verses in my note:\n\n    \"'Tis an hour since I saw thee,\n       And it seems a whole long year;\n     If I loathe my own existence,\n       How can I live on, my dear?\"\n\nI think they are by Pushkin.\n\nIn the evening I wrapped myself in my cloak, hastened to the director's\nhouse, and waited there a long time to see if she would come out and get\ninto the carriage. I only wanted to see her once, but she did not come.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_November 6th._--Our chief clerk has gone mad. When I came to the office\nto-day he called me to his room and began as follows: \"Look here, my\nfriend, what wild ideas have got into your head?\"\n\n\"How! What? None at all,\" I answered.\n\n\"Consider well. You are already past forty; it is quite time to be\nreasonable. What do you imagine? Do you think I don't know all your\ntricks? Are you trying to pay court to the director's daughter? Look at\nyourself and realise what you are! A nonentity, nothing else. I would\nnot give a kopeck for you. Look well in the glass. How can you have such\nthoughts with such a caricature of a face?\"\n\nMay the devil take him! Because his own face has a certain resemblance\nto a medicine-bottle, because he has a curly bush of hair on his head,\nand sometimes combs it upwards, and sometimes plasters it down in all\nkinds of queer ways, he thinks that he can do everything. I know well, I\nknow why he is angry with me. He is envious; perhaps he has noticed the\ntokens of favour which have been graciously shown me. But why should I\nbother about him? A councillor! What sort of important animal is that?\nHe wears a gold chain with his watch, buys himself boots at thirty\nroubles a pair; may the deuce take him! Am I a tailor's son or some\nother obscure cabbage? I am a nobleman! I can also work my way up. I am\njust forty-two--an age when a man's real career generally begins. Wait a\nbit, my friend! I too may get to a superior's rank; or perhaps, if God\nis gracious, even to a higher one. I shall make a name which will far\noutstrip yours. You think there are no able men except yourself? I only\nneed to order a fashionable coat and wear a tie like yours, and you\nwould be quite eclipsed.\n\nBut I have no money--that is the worst part of it!\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_November 8th._--I was at the theatre. \"The Russian House-Fool\" was\nperformed. I laughed heartily. There was also a kind of musical comedy\nwhich contained amusing hits at barristers. The language was very broad;\nI wonder the censor passed it. In the comedy lines occur which accuse\nthe merchants of cheating; their sons are said to lead immoral lives,\nand to behave very disrespectfully towards the nobility.\n\nThe critics also are criticised; they are said only to be able to find\nfault, so that authors have to beg the public for protection.\n\nOur modern dramatists certainly write amusing things. I am very fond of\nthe theatre. If I have only a kopeck in my pocket, I always go there.\nMost of my fellow-officials are uneducated boors, and never enter a\ntheatre unless one throws free tickets at their head.\n\nOne actress sang divinely. I thought also of--but silence!\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_November 9th._--About eight o'clock I went to the office. The chief\nclerk pretended not to notice my arrival. I for my part also behaved as\nthough he were not in existence. I read through and collated documents.\nAbout four o'clock I left. I passed by the director's house, but no one\nwas to be seen. After dinner I lay for a good while on the bed.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_November 11th._--To-day I sat in the director's room, mended\ntwenty-three pens for him, and for Her--for Her Excellence, his\ndaughter, four more.\n\nThe director likes to see many pens lying on his table. What a head he\nmust have! He continually wraps himself in silence, but I don't think\nthe smallest trifle escapes his eye. I should like to know what he is\ngenerally thinking of, what is really going on in this brain; I should\nlike to get acquainted with the whole manner of life of these gentlemen,\nand get a closer view of their cunning courtiers' arts, and all the\nactivities of these circles. I have often thought of asking His\nExcellence about them; but--the deuce knows why!--every time my tongue\nfailed me and I could get nothing out but my meteorological report.\n\nI wish I could get a look into the spare-room whose door I so often see\nopen. And a second small room behind the spare-room excites my\ncuriosity. How splendidly it is fitted up; what a quantity of mirrors\nand choice china it contains! I should also like to cast a glance into\nthose regions where Her Excellency, the daughter, wields the sceptre. I\nshould like to see how all the scent-bottles and boxes are arranged in\nher boudoir, and the flowers which exhale so delicious a scent that one\nis half afraid to breathe. And her clothes lying about which are too\nethereal to be called clothes--but silence!\n\nTo-day there came to me what seemed a heavenly inspiration. I remembered\nthe conversation between the two dogs which I had overheard on the\nNevski Prospect. \"Very good,\" I thought; \"now I see my way clear. I must\nget hold of the correspondence which these two silly dogs have carried\non with each other. In it I shall probably find many things explained.\"\n\nI had already once called Meggy to me and said to her, \"Listen, Meggy!\nNow we are alone together; if you like, I will also shut the door so\nthat no one can see us. Tell me now all that you know about your\nmistress. I swear to you that I will tell no one.\"\n\nBut the cunning dog drew in its tail, ruffled up its hair, and went\nquite quietly out of the door, as though it had heard nothing.\n\nI had long been of the opinion that dogs are much cleverer than men. I\nalso believed that they could talk, and that only a certain obstinacy\nkept them from doing so. They are especially watchful animals, and\nnothing escapes their observation. Now, cost what it may, I will go\nto-morrow to Sverkoff's house in order to ask after Fidel, and if I have\nluck, to get hold of all the letters which Meggy has written to her.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_November 12th._--To-day about two o'clock in the afternoon I started in\norder, by some means or other, to see Fidel and question her.\n\nI cannot stand this smell of Sauerkraut which assails one's olfactory\nnerves from all the shops in Citizen Street. There also exhales such an\nodour from under each house door, that one must hold one's nose and pass\nby quickly. There ascends also so much smoke and soot from the artisans'\nshops that it is almost impossible to get through it.\n\nWhen I had climbed up to the sixth story, and had rung the bell, a\nrather pretty girl with a freckled face came out. I recognised her as\nthe companion of the old lady. She blushed a little and asked \"What do\nyou want?\"\n\n\"I want to have a little conversation with your dog.\"\n\nShe was a simple-minded girl, as I saw at once. The dog came running and\nbarking loudly. I wanted to take hold of it, but the abominable beast\nnearly caught hold of my nose with its teeth. But in a corner of the\nroom I saw its sleeping-basket. Ah! that was what I wanted. I went to\nit, rummaged in the straw, and to my great satisfaction drew out a\nlittle packet of small pieces of paper. When the hideous little dog saw\nthis, it first bit me in the calf of the leg, and then, as soon as it\nhad become aware of my theft, it began to whimper and to fawn on me; but\nI said, \"No, you little beast; good-bye!\" and hastened away.\n\nI believe the girl thought me mad; at any rate she was thoroughly\nalarmed.\n\nWhen I reached my room I wished to get to work at once, and read through\nthe letters by daylight, since I do not see well by candle-light; but\nthe wretched Mawra had got the idea of sweeping the floor. These\nblockheads of Finnish women are always clean where there is no need to\nbe.\n\nI then went for a little walk and began to think over what had happened.\nNow at last I could get to the bottom of all facts, ideas and motives!\nThese letters would explain everything. Dogs are clever fellows; they\nknow all about politics, and I will certainly find in the letters all I\nwant, especially the character of the director and all his\nrelationships. And through these letters I will get information about\nher who--but silence!\n\nTowards evening I came home and lay for a good while on the bed.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_November 13th._--Now let us see! The letter is fairly legible but the\nhandwriting is somewhat doggish.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Dear Fidel!--I cannot get accustomed to your ordinary name, as if they\ncould not have found a better one for you! Fidel! How tasteless! How\nordinary! But this is not the time to discuss it. I am very glad that we\nthought of corresponding with each other.\"\n\n(The letter is quite correctly written. The punctuation and spelling are\nperfectly right. Even our head clerk does not write so simply and\nclearly, though he declares he has been at the University. Let us go\non.)\n\n\"I think that it is one of the most refined joys of this world to\ninterchange thoughts, feelings, and impressions.\"\n\n(H'm! This idea comes from some book which has been translated from\nGerman. I can't remember the title.)\n\n\"I speak from experience, although I have not gone farther into the\nworld than just before our front door. Does not my life pass happily and\ncomfortably? My mistress, whom her father calls Sophie, is quite in love\nwith me.\"\n\n(Ah! Ah!--but better be silent!)\n\n\"Her father also often strokes me. I drink tea and coffee with cream.\nYes, my dear, I must confess to you that I find no satisfaction in those\nlarge, gnawed-at bones which Polkan devours in the kitchen. Only the\nbones of wild fowl are good, and that only when the marrow has not been\nsucked out of them. They taste very nice with a little sauce, but there\nshould be no green stuff in it. But I know nothing worse than the habit\nof giving dogs balls of bread kneaded up. Someone sits at table, kneads\na bread-ball with dirty fingers, calls you and sticks it in your mouth.\nGood manners forbid your refusing it, and you eat it--with disgust it is\ntrue, but you eat it.\"\n\n(The deuce! What is this? What rubbish! As if she could find nothing\nmore suitable to write about! I will see if there is anything more\nreasonable on the second page.)\n\n\"I am quite willing to inform you of everything that goes on here. I\nhave already mentioned the most important person in the house, whom\nSophie calls 'Papa.' He is a very strange man.\"\n\n(Ah! Here we are at last! Yes, I knew it; they have a politician's\npenetrating eye for all things. Let us see what she says about \"Papa.\")\n\n\"... a strange man. Generally he is silent; he only speaks seldom, but\nabout a week ago he kept on repeating to himself, 'Shall I get it or\nnot?' In one hand he took a sheet of paper; the other he stretched out\nas though to receive something, and repeated, 'Shall I get it or not?'\nOnce he turned to me with the question, 'What do you think, Meggy?' I\ndid not understand in the least what he meant, sniffed at his boots, and\nwent away. A week later he came home with his face beaming. That morning\nhe was visited by several officers in uniform who congratulated him. At\nthe dinner-table he was in a better humour than I have ever seen him\nbefore.\"\n\n(Ah! he is ambitious then! I must make a note of that.)\n\n\"Pardon, my dear, I hasten to conclude, etc., etc. To-morrow I will\nfinish the letter.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now, good morning; here I am again at your service. To-day my mistress\nSophie ...\"\n\n(Ah! we will see what she says about Sophie. Let us go on!)\n\n\"... was in an unusually excited state. She went to a ball, and I was\nglad that I could write to you in her absence. She likes going to balls,\nalthough she gets dreadfully irritated while dressing. I cannot\nunderstand, my dear, what is the pleasure in going to a ball. She comes\nhome from the ball at six o'clock in the early morning, and to judge by\nher pale and emaciated face, she has had nothing to eat. I could,\nfrankly speaking, not endure such an existence. If I could not get\npartridge with sauce, or the wing of a roast chicken, I don't know what\nI should do. Porridge with sauce is also tolerable, but I can get up no\nenthusiasm for carrots, turnips, and artichokes.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe style is very unequal! One sees at once that it has not been written\nby a man. The beginning is quite intelligent, but at the end the canine\nnature breaks out. I will read another letter; it is rather long and\nthere is no date.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Ah, my dear, how delightful is the arrival of spring! My heart beats as\nthough it expected something. There is a perpetual ringing in my ears,\nso that I often stand with my foot raised, for several minutes at a\ntime, and listen towards the door. In confidence I will tell you that I\nhave many admirers. I often sit on the window-sill and let them pass in\nreview. Ah! if you knew what miscreations there are among them; one, a\nclumsy house-dog, with stupidity written on his face, walks the street\nwith an important air and imagines that he is an extremely important\nperson, and that the eyes of all the world are fastened on him. I don't\npay him the least attention, and pretend not to see him at all.\n\n\"And what a hideous bulldog has taken up his post opposite my window! If\nhe stood on his hind-legs, as the monster probably cannot, he would be\ntaller by a head than my mistress's papa, who himself has a stately\nfigure. This lout seems, moreover, to be very impudent. I growl at him,\nbut he does not seem to mind that at all. If he at least would only\nwrinkle his forehead! Instead of that, he stretches out his tongue,\ndroops his big ears, and stares in at the window--this rustic boor! But\ndo you think, my dear, that my heart remains proof against all\ntemptations? Alas no! If you had only seen that gentlemanly dog who\ncrept through the fence of the neighbouring house. 'Treasure' is his\nname. Ah, my dear, what a delightful snout he has!\"\n\n(To the deuce with the stuff! What rubbish it is! How can one blacken\npaper with such absurdities. Give me a man. I want to see a man! I need\nsome food to nourish and refresh my mind, and get this silliness\ninstead. I will turn the page to see if there is anything better on the\nother side.)\n\n\"Sophie sat at the table and sewed something. I looked out of the window\nand amused myself by watching the passers-by. Suddenly a flunkey entered\nand announced a visitor--'Mr Teploff.'\n\n\"'Show him in!' said Sophie, and began to embrace me. 'Ah! Meggy, Meggy,\ndo you know who that is? He is dark, and belongs to the Royal Household;\nand what eyes he has! Dark and brilliant as fire.'\n\n\"Sophie hastened into her room. A minute later a young gentleman with\nblack whiskers entered. He went to the mirror, smoothed his hair, and\nlooked round the room. I turned away and sat down in my place.\n\n\"Sophie entered and returned his bow in a friendly manner.\n\n\"I pretended to observe nothing, and continued to look out of the\nwindow. But I leant my head a little on one side to hear what they were\ntalking about. Ah, my dear! what silly things they discussed--how a lady\nexecuted the wrong figure in dancing; how a certain Boboff, with his\nexpansive shirt-frill, had looked like a stork and nearly fallen down;\nhow a certain Lidina imagined she had blue eyes when they were really\ngreen, etc.\n\n\"I do not know, my dear, what special charm she finds in her Mr Teploff,\nand why she is so delighted with him.\"\n\n(It seems to me myself that there is something wrong here. It is\nimpossible that this Teploff should bewitch her. We will see further.)\n\n\"If this gentleman of the Household pleases her, then she must also be\npleased, according to my view, with that official who sits in her papa's\nwriting-room. Ah, my dear, if you know what a figure he is! A regular\ntortoise!\"\n\n(What official does she mean?)\n\n\"He has an extraordinary name. He always sits there and mends the pens.\nHis hair looks like a truss of hay. Her papa always employs him instead\nof a servant.\"\n\n(I believe this abominable little beast is referring to me. But what has\nmy hair got to do with hay?)\n\n\"Sophie can never keep from laughing when she sees him.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nYou lie, cursed dog! What a scandalous tongue! As if I did not know that\nit is envy which prompts you, and that here there is treachery at\nwork--yes, the treachery of the chief clerk. This man hates me\nimplacably; he has plotted against me, he is always seeking to injure\nme. I'll look through one more letter; perhaps it will make the matter\nclearer.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Fidel, my dear, pardon me that I have not written for so long. I was\nfloating in a dream of delight. In truth, some author remarks, 'Love is\na second life.' Besides, great changes are going on in the house. The\nyoung chamberlain is always here. Sophie is wildly in love with him. Her\npapa is quite contented. I heard from Gregor, who sweeps the floor, and\nis in the habit of talking to himself, that the marriage will soon be\ncelebrated. Her papa will at any rate get his daughter married to a\ngeneral, a colonel, or a chamberlain.\"\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nDeuce take it! I can read no more. It is all about chamberlains and\ngenerals. I should like myself to be a general--not in order to sue for\nher hand and all that--no, not at all; I should like to be a general\nmerely in order to see people wriggling, squirming, and hatching plots\nbefore me.\n\nAnd then I should like to tell them that they are both of them not worth\nspitting on. But it is vexatious! I tear the foolish dog's letters up in\na thousand pieces.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_December 3rd._--It is not possible that the marriage should take place;\nit is only idle gossip. What does it signify if he is a chamberlain!\nThat is only a dignity, not a substantial thing which one can see or\nhandle. His chamberlain's office will not procure him a third eye in his\nforehead. Neither is his nose made of gold; it is just like mine or\nanyone else's nose. He does not eat and cough, but smells and sneezes\nwith it. I should like to get to the bottom of the mystery--whence do\nall these distinctions come? Why am I only a titular councillor?\n\nPerhaps I am really a count or a general, and only appear to be a\ntitular councillor. Perhaps I don't even know who and what I am. How\nmany cases there are in history of a simple gentleman, or even a burgher\nor peasant, suddenly turning out to be a great lord or baron? Well,\nsuppose that I appear suddenly in a general's uniform, on the right\nshoulder an epaulette, on the left an epaulette, and a blue sash across\nmy breast, what sort of a tune would my beloved sing then? What would\nher papa, our director, say? Oh, he is ambitious! He is a freemason,\ncertainly a freemason; however much he may conceal it, I have found it\nout. When he gives anyone his hand, he only reaches out two fingers.\nWell, could not I this minute be nominated a general or a\nsuperintendent? I should like to know why I am a titular councillor--why\njust that, and nothing more?\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_December 5th._--To-day I have been reading papers the whole morning.\nVery strange things are happening in Spain. I have not understood them\nall. It is said that the throne is vacant, the representatives of the\npeople are in difficulties about finding an occupant, and riots are\ntaking place.\n\nAll this appears to me very strange. How can the throne be vacant? It is\nsaid that it will be occupied by a woman. A woman cannot sit on a\nthrone. That is impossible. Only a king can sit on a throne. They say\nthat there is no king there, but that is not possible. There cannot be a\nkingdom without a king. There must be a king, but he is hidden away\nsomewhere. Perhaps he is actually on the spot, and only some domestic\ncomplications, or fears of the neighbouring Powers, France and other\ncountries, compel him to remain in concealment; there might also be\nother reasons.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_December 8th._--I was nearly going to the office, but various\nconsiderations kept me from doing so. I keep on thinking about these\nSpanish affairs. How is it possible that a woman should reign? It would\nnot be allowed, especially by England. In the rest of Europe the\npolitical situation is also critical; the Emperor of Austria----\n\nThese events, to tell the truth, have so shaken and shattered me, that I\ncould really do nothing all day. Mawra told me that I was very\nabsent-minded at table. In fact, in my absent-mindedness I threw two\nplates on the ground so that they broke in pieces.\n\nAfter dinner I felt weak, and did not feel up to making abstracts of\nreports. I lay most of the time on my bed, and thought of the Spanish\naffairs.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_The year 2000: April 43rd._--To-day is a day of splendid triumph. Spain\nhas a king; he has been found, and I am he. I discovered it to-day; all\nof a sudden it came upon me like a flash of lightning.\n\nI do not understand how I could imagine that I am a titular councillor.\nHow could such a foolish idea enter my head? It was fortunate that it\noccurred to no one to shut me up in an asylum. Now it is all clear, and\nas plain as a pikestaff. Formerly--I don't know why--everything seemed\nveiled in a kind of mist. That is, I believe, because people think that\nthe human brain is in the head. Nothing of the sort; it is carried by\nthe wind from the Caspian Sea.\n\nFor the first time I told Mawra who I am. When she learned that the king\nof Spain stood before her, she struck her hands together over her head,\nand nearly died of alarm. The stupid thing had never seen the king of\nSpain before!\n\nI comforted her, however, at once by assuring her that I was not angry\nwith her for having hitherto cleaned my boots badly. Women are stupid\nthings; one cannot interest them in lofty subjects. She was frightened\nbecause she thought all kings of Spain were like Philip II. But I\nexplained to her that there was a great difference between me and him. I\ndid not go to the office. Why the deuce should I? No, my dear friends,\nyou won't get me there again! I am not going to worry myself with your\ninfernal documents any more.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Marchember 86. Between day and night._--To-day the office-messenger\ncame and summoned me, as I had not been there for three weeks. I went\njust for the fun of the thing. The chief clerk thought I would bow\nhumbly before him, and make excuses; but I looked at him quite\nindifferently, neither angrily nor mildly, and sat down quietly at my\nplace as though I noticed no one. I looked at all this rabble of\nscribblers, and thought, \"If you only knew who is sitting among you!\nGood heavens! what a to-do you would make. Even the chief clerk would\nbow himself to the earth before me as he does now before the director.\"\n\nA pile of reports was laid before me, of which to make abstracts, but I\ndid not touch them with one finger.\n\nAfter a little time there was a commotion in the office, and there a\nreport went round that the director was coming. Many of the clerks vied\nwith each other to attract his notice; but I did not stir. As he came\nthrough our room, each one hastily buttoned up his coat; but I had no\nidea of doing anything of the sort. What is the director to me? Should I\nstand up before him? Never. What sort of a director is he? He is a\nbottle-stopper, and no director. A quite ordinary, simple\nbottle-stopper--nothing more. I felt quite amused as they gave me a\ndocument to sign.\n\nThey thought I would simply put down my name--\"So-and-so, Clerk.\" Why\nnot? But at the top of the sheet, where the director generally writes\nhis name, I inscribed \"Ferdinand VIII.\" in bold characters. You should\nhave seen what a reverential silence ensued. But I made a gesture with\nmy hand, and said, \"Gentlemen, no ceremony please!\" Then I went out, and\ntook my way straight to the director's house.\n\nHe was not at home. The flunkey wanted not to let me in, but I talked to\nhim in such a way that he soon dropped his arms.\n\nI went straight to Sophie's dressing-room. She sat before the mirror.\nWhen she saw me, she sprang up and took a step backwards; but I did not\ntell her that I was the king of Spain.\n\nBut I told her that a happiness awaited her, beyond her power to\nimagine; and that in spite of all our enemies' devices we should be\nunited. That was all which I wished to say to her, and I went out. Oh,\nwhat cunning creatures these women are! Now I have found out what woman\nreally is. Hitherto no one knew whom a woman really loves; I am the\nfirst to discover it--she loves the devil. Yes, joking apart, learned\nmen write nonsense when they pronounce that she is this and that; she\nloves the devil--that is all. You see a woman looking through her\nlorgnette from a box in the front row. One thinks she is watching that\nstout gentleman who wears an order. Not a bit of it! She is watching the\ndevil who stands behind his back. He has hidden himself there, and\nbeckons to her with his finger. And she marries him--actually--she\nmarries him!\n\nThat is all ambition, and the reason is that there is under the tongue a\nlittle blister in which there is a little worm of the size of a pin's\nhead. And this is constructed by a barber in Bean Street; I don't\nremember his name at the moment, but so much is certain that, in\nconjunction with a midwife, he wants to spread Mohammedanism all over\nthe world, and that in consequence of this a large number of people in\nFrance have already adopted the faith of Islam.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_No date. The day had no date._--I went for a walk incognito on the\nNevski Prospect. I avoided every appearance of being the king of Spain.\nI felt it below my dignity to let myself be recognised by the whole\nworld, since I must first present myself at court. And I was also\nrestrained by the fact that I have at present no Spanish national\ncostume. If I could only get a cloak! I tried to have a consultation\nwith a tailor, but these people are real asses! Moreover, they neglect\ntheir business, dabble in speculation, and have become loafers. I will\nhave a cloak made out of my new official uniform which I have only worn\ntwice. But to prevent this botcher of a tailor spoiling it, I will make\nit myself with closed doors, so that no one sees me. Since the cut must\nbe altogether altered, I have used the scissors myself.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nI don't remember the date. The devil knows what month it was. The cloak\nis quite ready. Mawra exclaimed aloud when I put it on. I will, however,\nnot present myself at court yet; the Spanish deputation has not yet\narrived. It would not be befitting if I appeared without them. My\nappearance would be less imposing. From hour to hour I expect them.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_The 1st._--The extraordinary long delay of the deputies in coming\nastonishes me. What can possibly keep them? Perhaps France has a hand in\nthe matter; it is certainly hostilely inclined. I went to the post\noffice to inquire whether the Spanish deputation had come. The\npostmaster is an extraordinary blockhead who knows nothing. \"No,\" he\nsaid to me, \"there is no Spanish deputation here; but if you want to\nsend them a letter, we will forward it at the fixed rate.\" The deuce!\nWhat do I want with a letter? Letters are nonsense. Letters are written\nby apothecaries....\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Madrid, February 30th._--So I am in Spain after all! It has happened so\nquickly that I could hardly take it in. The Spanish deputies came early\nthis morning, and I got with them into the carriage. This unexpected\npromptness seemed to me strange. We drove so quickly that in half an\nhour we were at the Spanish frontier. Over all Europe now there are\ncast-iron roads, and the steamers go very fast. A wonderful country,\nthis Spain!\n\nAs we entered the first room, I saw numerous persons with shorn heads. I\nguessed at once that they must be either grandees or soldiers, at least\nto judge by their shorn heads.\n\nThe Chancellor of the State, who led me by the hand, seemed to me to\nbehave in a very strange way; he pushed me into a little room and said,\n\"Stay here, and if you call yourself 'King Ferdinand' again, I will\ndrive the wish to do so out of you.\"\n\nI knew, however, that that was only a test, and I reasserted my\nconviction; on which the Chancellor gave me two such severe blows with a\nstick on the back, that I could have cried out with the pain. But I\nrestrained myself, remembering that this was a usual ceremony of\nold-time chivalry when one was inducted into a high position, and in\nSpain the laws of chivalry prevail up to the present day. When I was\nalone, I determined to study State affairs; I discovered that Spain and\nChina are one and the same country, and it is only through ignorance\nthat people regard them as separate kingdoms. I advise everyone urgently\nto write down the word \"Spain\" on a sheet of paper; he will see that it\nis quite the same as China.\n\nBut I feel much annoyed by an event which is about to take place\nto-morrow; at seven o'clock the earth is going to sit on the moon. This\nis foretold by the famous English chemist, Wellington. To tell the\ntruth, I often felt uneasy when I thought of the excessive brittleness\nand fragility of the moon. The moon is generally repaired in Hamburg,\nand very imperfectly. It is done by a lame cooper, an obvious blockhead\nwho has no idea how to do it. He took waxed thread and olive-oil--hence\nthat pungent smell over all the earth which compels people to hold their\nnoses. And this makes the moon so fragile that no men can live on it,\nbut only noses. Therefore we cannot see our noses, because they are on\nthe moon.\n\nWhen I now pictured to myself how the earth, that massive body, would\ncrush our noses to dust, if it sat on the moon, I became so uneasy, that\nI immediately put on my shoes and stockings and hastened into the\ncouncil-hall to give the police orders to prevent the earth sitting on\nthe moon.\n\nThe grandees with the shorn heads, whom I met in great numbers in the\nhall, were very intelligent people, and when I exclaimed, \"Gentlemen!\nlet us save the moon, for the earth is going to sit on it,\" they all set\nto work to fulfil my imperial wish, and many of them clambered up the\nwall in order to take the moon down. At that moment the Imperial\nChancellor came in. As soon as he appeared, they all scattered, but I\nalone, as king, remained. To my astonishment, however, the Chancellor\nbeat me with the stick and drove me to my room. So powerful are ancient\ncustoms in Spain!\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_January in the same year, following after February._--I can never\nunderstand what kind of a country this Spain really is. The popular\ncustoms and rules of court etiquette are quite extraordinary. I do not\nunderstand them at all, at all. To-day my head was shorn, although I\nexclaimed as loudly as I could, that I did not want to be a monk. What\nhappened afterwards, when they began to let cold water trickle on my\nhead, I do not know. I have never experienced such hellish torments. I\nnearly went mad, and they had difficulty in holding me. The significance\nof this strange custom is entirely hidden from me. It is a very foolish\nand unreasonable one.\n\nNor can I understand the stupidity of the kings who have not done away\nwith it before now. Judging by all the circumstances, it seems to me as\nthough I had fallen into the hands of the Inquisition, and as though the\nman whom I took to be the Chancellor was the Grand Inquisitor. But yet I\ncannot understand how the king could fall into the hands of the\nInquisition. The affair may have been arranged by France--especially\nPolignac--he is a hound, that Polignac! He has sworn to compass my\ndeath, and now he is hunting me down. But I know, my friend, that you\nare only a tool of the English. They are clever fellows, and have a\nfinger in every pie. All the world knows that France sneezes when\nEngland takes a pinch of snuff.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_The 25th._--To-day the Grand Inquisitor came into my room; when I heard\nhis steps in the distance, I hid myself under a chair. When he did not\nsee me, he began to call. At first he called \"Poprishchin!\" I made no\nanswer. Then he called \"Axanti Ivanovitch! Titular Councillor!\nNobleman!\" I still kept silence. \"Ferdinand the Eighth, King of Spain!\"\nI was on the point of putting out my head, but I thought, \"No, brother,\nyou shall not deceive me! You shall not pour water on my head again!\"\n\nBut he had already seen me and drove me from under the chair with his\nstick. The cursed stick really hurts one. But the following discovery\ncompensated me for all the pain, i.e. that every cock has his Spain\nunder his feathers. The Grand Inquisitor went angrily away, and\nthreatened me with some punishment or other. I felt only contempt for\nhis powerless spite, for I know that he only works like a machine, like\na tool of the English.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\n_34 March. February, 349._--No, I have no longer power to endure. O God!\nwhat are they going to do with me? They pour cold water on my head. They\ntake no notice of me, and seem neither to see nor hear. Why do they\ntorture me? What do they want from one so wretched as myself? What can I\ngive them? I possess nothing. I cannot bear all their tortures; my head\naches as though everything were turning round in a circle. Save me!\nCarry me away! Give me three steeds swift as the wind! Mount your seat,\ncoachman, ring bells, gallop horses, and carry me straight out of this\nworld. Farther, ever farther, till nothing more is to be seen!\n\nAh! the heaven bends over me already; a star glimmers in the distance;\nthe forest with its dark trees in the moonlight rushes past; a bluish\nmist floats under my feet; music sounds in the cloud; on the one side is\nthe sea, on the other, Italy; beyond I also see Russian peasants'\nhouses. Is not my parents' house there in the distance? Does not my\nmother sit by the window? O mother, mother, save your unhappy son! Let a\ntear fall on his aching head! See how they torture him! Press the poor\norphan to your bosom! He has no rest in this world; they hunt him from\nplace to place.\n\nMother, mother, have pity on your sick child! And do you know that the\nBey of Algiers has a wart under his nose?\n\n\n\n\nA MAY NIGHT\n\n\nI\n\nSongs were echoing in the village street. It was just the time when the\nyoung men and girls, tired with the work and cares of the day, were in\nthe habit of assembling for the dance. In the mild evening light,\ncheerful songs blended with mild melodies. A mysterious twilight\nobscured the blue sky and made everything seem indistinct and distant.\nIt was growing dark, but the songs were not hushed.\n\nA young Cossack, Levko by name, the son of the village headman, had\nstolen away from the singers, guitar in hand. With his embroidered cap\nset awry on his head, and his hand playing over the strings, he stepped\na measure to the music. Then he stopped at the door of a house half\nhidden by blossoming cherry-trees. Whose house was it? To whom did the\ndoor lead? After a little while he played and sang:\n\n    \"The night is nigh, the sun is down,\n     Come out to me, my love, my own!\"\n\n\"No one is there; my bright-eyed beauty is fast asleep,\" said the\nCossack to himself as he finished the song and approached the window.\n\"Hanna, Hanna, are you asleep, or won't you come to me? Perhaps you are\nafraid someone will see us, or will not expose your delicate face to the\ncold! Fear nothing! The evening is warm, and there is no one near. And\nif anyone comes I will wrap you in my caftan, fold you in my arms, and\nno one will see us. And if the wind blows cold, I will press you close\nto my heart, warm you with my kisses, and lay my cap on your tiny feet,\nmy darling. Only throw me a single glance. No, you are not asleep, you\nproud thing!\" he exclaimed now louder, in a voice which betrayed his\nannoyance at the humiliation. \"You are laughing at me! Good-bye!\"\n\nThen he turned away, set his cap jauntily, and, still lightly touching\nhis guitar, stepped back from the window. Just then the wooden handle of\nthe door turned with a grating noise, and a girl who counted hardly\nseventeen springs looked out timidly through the darkness, and still\nkeeping hold of the handle, stepped over the threshold. In the twilight\nher bright eyes shone like little stars, her coral necklace gleamed, and\nthe pink flush on her cheeks did not escape the Cossack's observation.\n\n\"How impatient you are!\" she said in a whisper. \"You get angry so\nquickly! Why did you choose such a time? There are crowds of people in\nthe street.... I tremble all over.\"\n\n\"Don't tremble, my darling! Come close to me!\" said the Cossack, putting\ndown his guitar, which hung on a long strap round his neck, and sitting\ndown with her on the door-step. \"You know I find it hard to be only an\nhour without seeing you.\"\n\n\"Do you know what I am thinking of?\" interrupted the young girl, looking\nat him thoughtfully. \"Something whispers to me that we shall not see so\nmuch of each other in the future. The people here are not well disposed\nto you, the girls look so envious, and the young fellows.... I notice\nalso that my mother watches me carefully for some time past. I must\nconfess I was happier when among strangers.\" Her face wore a troubled\nexpression as she spoke.\n\n\"You are only two months back at home, and are already tired of it!\"\nsaid the Cossack. \"And of me too perhaps?\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" she replied, smiling. \"I love you, you black-eyed Cossack! I\nlove you because of your dark eyes, and my heart laughs in my breast\nwhen you look at me. I feel so happy when you come down the street\nstroking your black moustache, and enjoy listening to your song when you\nplay the guitar!\"\n\n\"Oh my Hanna!\" exclaimed the Cossack, kissing the girl and drawing her\ncloser to him.\n\n\"Stop, Levko! Tell me whether you have spoken to your father?\"\n\n\"About what?\" he answered absent-mindedly. \"About my marrying you? Yes,\nI did.\" But he seemed to speak almost reluctantly.\n\n\"Well? What more?\"\n\n\"What can you make of him? The old curmudgeon pretends to be deaf; he\nwill not listen to anything, and blames me for loafing with fellows, as\nhe says, about the streets. But don't worry, Hanna! I give you my word\nas a Cossack, I will break his obstinacy.\"\n\n\"You only need to say a word, Levko, and it shall be as you wish. I know\nthat of myself. Often I do not wish to obey you, but you speak only a\nword, and I involuntarily do what you wish. Look, look!\" she continued,\nlaying her head on his shoulder and raising her eyes to the sky, the\nimmeasurable heaven of the Ukraine; \"there far away are twinkling little\nstars--one, two, three, four, five. Is it not true that those are angels\nopening the windows of their bright little homes and looking down on us.\nIs it not so, Levko? They are looking down on earth. If men had wings\nlike birds, how high they could fly. But ah! not even our oaks reach the\nsky. Still people say there is in some distant land a tree whose top\nreaches to heaven, and that God descends by it on the earth, the night\nbefore Easter.\"\n\n\"No, Hanna. God has a long ladder which reaches from heaven to earth.\nBefore Easter Sunday holy angels set it up, and as soon as God puts His\nfoot on the first rung, all evil spirits take to flight and fall in\nswarms into hell. That is why on Easter Day there are none of them on\nearth.\"\n\n\"How gently the water ripples! Like a child in the cradle,\" continued\nHanna, pointing to the pool begirt by dark maples and weeping-willows,\nwhose melancholy branches drooped in the water. On a hill near the wood\nslumbered an old house with closed shutters. The roof was covered with\nmoss and weeds; leafy apple-trees had grown high up before the windows;\nthe wood cast deep shadows on it; a grove of nut-trees spread from the\nfoot of the hill as far as the pool.\n\n\"I remember as if in a dream,\" said Hanna, keeping her eyes fixed on the\nhouse, \"a long, long time ago, when I was little and lived with mother,\nsomeone told a terrible story about this house. You must know it--tell\nme.\"\n\n\"God forbid, my dear child! Old women and stupid people talk a lot of\nnonsense. It would only frighten you and spoil your sleep.\"\n\n\"Tell me, my darling, my black-eyed Cossack,\" she said, pressing her\ncheek to his. \"No, you don't love me; you have certainly another\nsweetheart! I will not be frightened, and will sleep quite quietly. If\nyou refuse to tell me, _that_ would keep me awake. I would keep on\nworrying and thinking about it. Tell me, Levko!\"\n\n\"Certainly it is true what people say, that the devil possesses girls,\nand stirs up their curiosity. Well then, listen. Long ago there lived in\nthat house an elderly man who had a beautiful daughter white as snow,\njust like you. His wife had been dead a long time, and he was thinking\nof marrying again.\n\n\"'Will you pet me as before, father, if you take a second wife?' asked\nhis daughter.\n\n\"'Yes, my daughter,' he answered, 'I shall love you more than ever, and\ngive you yet more rings and necklaces.'\n\n\"So he brought a young wife home, who was beautiful and white and red,\nbut she cast such an evil glance at her stepdaughter that she cried\naloud, but not a word did her sulky stepmother speak to her all day\nlong.\n\n\"When night came, and her father and his wife had retired, the young\ngirl locked herself up in her room, and feeling melancholy began to weep\nbitterly. Suddenly she spied a hideous black cat creeping towards her;\nits fur was aflame and its claws struck on the ground like iron. In her\nterror the girl sprang on a chair; the cat followed her. Then she sprang\ninto bed; the cat sprang after her, and seizing her by the throat began\nto choke her. She tore the creature away, and flung it on the ground,\nbut the terrible cat began to creep towards her again. Rendered\ndesperate with terror, she seized her father's sabre which hung on the\nwall, and struck at the cat, wounding one of its paws. The animal\ndisappeared, whimpering.\n\n\"The next day the young wife did not leave her bedroom; the third day\nshe appeared with her hand bound up.\n\n\"The poor girl perceived that her stepmother was a witch, and that she\nhad wounded her hand.\n\n\"On the fourth day her father told her to bring water, to sweep the\nfloor like a servant-maid, and not to show herself where he and his wife\nsat. She obeyed him, though with a heavy heart. On the fifth day he\ndrove her barefooted out of the house, without giving her any food for\nher journey. Then she began to sob and covered her face with her hands.\n\n\"'You have ruined your own daughter, father!' she cried; 'and the witch\nhas ruined your soul. May God forgive you! He will not allow me to live\nmuch longer.'\n\n\"And do you see,\" continued Levko, turning to Hanna and pointing to the\nhouse, \"do you see that high bank; from that bank she threw herself into\nthe water, and has been no more seen on earth.\"\n\n\"And the witch?\" Hanna interrupted, timidly fastening her tearful eyes\non him.\n\n\"The witch? Old women say that when the moon shines, all those who have\nbeen drowned come out to warm themselves in its rays, and that they are\nled by the witch's stepdaughter. One night she saw her stepmother by the\npool, caught hold of her, and dragged her screaming into the water. But\nthis time also the witch played her a trick; she changed herself into\none of those who had been drowned, and so escaped the chastisement she\nwould have received at their hands.\n\n\"Let anyone who likes believe the old women's stories. They say that the\nwitch's stepdaughter gathers together those who have been drowned every\nnight, and looks in their faces in order to find out which of them is\nthe witch; but has not done so yet. Such are the old wives' tales. It is\nsaid to be the intention of the present owner to erect a distillery on\nthe spot. But I hear voices. They are coming home from the dancing.\nGood-bye, Hanna! Sleep well, and don't think of all that nonsense.\" So\nsaying he embraced her, kissed her, and departed.\n\n\"Good-bye, Levko!\" said Hanna, still gazing at the dark pine wood.\n\nThe brilliant moon was now rising and filling all the earth with\nsplendour. The pool shone like silver, and the shadows of the trees\nstood out in strong relief.\n\n\"Good-bye, Hanna!\" she heard again as she spoke, and felt the light\npressure of a kiss.\n\n\"You have come back!\" she said, looking round, but started on seeing a\nstranger before her.\n\nThere was another \"Good-bye, Hanna!\" and again she was kissed.\n\n\"Has the devil brought a second?\" she exclaimed angrily.\n\n\"Good-bye, dear Hanna!\"\n\n\"There is a third!\"\n\n\"Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye, Hanna!\" and kisses rained from all sides.\n\n\"Why, there is a whole band of them!\" cried Hanna, tearing herself from\nthe youths who had gathered round. \"Are they never tired of the eternal\nkissing? I shall soon not be able to show myself on the street!\" So\nsaying, she closed the door and bolted it.\n\n\nII\n\nTHE VILLAGE HEADMAN\n\nDo you know a Ukraine night? No, you do not know a night in the Ukraine.\nGaze your full on it. The moon shines in the midst of the sky; the\nimmeasurable vault of heaven seems to have expanded to infinity; the\nearth is bathed in silver light; the air is warm, voluptuous, and\nredolent of innumerable sweet scents. Divine night! Magical night!\nMotionless, but inspired with divine breath, the forests stand, casting\nenormous shadows and wrapped in complete darkness. Calmly and placidly\nsleep the lakes surrounded by dark green thickets. The virginal groves\nof the hawthorns and cherry-trees stretch their roots timidly into the\ncool water; only now and then their leaves rustle unwillingly when that\nfreebooter, the night-wind, steals up to kiss them. The whole landscape\nis hushed in slumber; but there is a mysterious breath upon the heights.\nOne falls into a weird and unearthly mood, and silvery apparitions rise\nfrom the depths. Divine night! Magical night! Suddenly the woods, lakes,\nand steppes become alive. The nightingales of the Ukraine are singing,\nand it seems as though the moon itself were listening to their song. The\nvillage sleeps as though under a magic spell; the cottages shine in the\nmoonlight against the darkness of the woods behind them. The songs grow\nsilent, and all is still. Only here and there is a glimmer of light in\nsome small window. Some families, sitting up late, are finishing their\nsupper at the thresholds of their houses.\n\n\"No, the 'gallop' is not danced like that! Now I see, it does not go\nproperly! What did my godfather tell me? So then! Hop! tralala! Hop!\ntralala! Hop! Hop! Hop!\" Thus a half-intoxicated, middle-aged Cossack\ntalked to himself as he danced through the street. \"By heaven, a\n'gallop' is not danced like that! What is the use of lying! On with it\nthen! Hop! tralala! Hop! tralala! Hop! Hop! Hop!\"\n\n\"See that fool there! If he were only a young fellow! But to see a grown\nman dancing, and the children laughing at him,\" exclaimed an old woman\nwho was passing by, carrying a bundle of straw. \"Go home! It is quite\ntime to go to sleep!\"\n\n\"I am going!\" said the Cossack, standing still. \"I am going. What do I\ncare about the headman? He thinks because he is the eldest, and throws\ncold water on people, and carries his head high. As to being headman--I\nmyself am a headman. Yes indeed--otherwise----\" As he spoke, he stepped\nup to the door of the first cottage he came to, stood at the window,\ndrumming with his fingers on the glass, and feeling for the door-handle.\n\"Woman, open! Woman, open quickly I tell you! It is time for me to go to\nsleep!\"\n\n\"Where are you going, Kalenik? That is the wrong house!\" some young\ngirls who were returning from the dance called to him as they passed.\n\"Shall we show you yours?\"\n\n\"Yes, please, ladies!\"\n\n\"Ladies! Just listen to him!\" one of them exclaimed. \"How polite Kalenik\nis! We will show you the house--but no, first dance before us!\"\n\n\"Dance before you? Oh, you are clever girls!\" said Kalenik in a drawling\nvoice, and laughing. He threatened them with his finger, and stumbled,\nnot being able to stand steadily. \"And will you let yourselves be\nkissed? I will kiss the lot.\" With tottering steps he began to run after\nthem.\n\nThe girls cried out and ran apart; but they soon plucked up courage and\nwent on the other side of the road, when they saw that Kalenik was not\nfirm on his legs.\n\n\"There is your house!\" they called to him, pointing to one which was\nlarger than the rest, and which belonged to the village headman.\n\nKalenik turned towards it, and began again to revile the headman.\n\nBut who is this headman to whose disadvantage so much has been said? Oh,\nhe is a very important person in the village. Before Kalenik reaches his\nhouse, we shall doubtless find enough time to say something about him.\nEveryone in the village takes off his cap at the sight of him, and even\nthe smallest girls wish him good morning. Which of the young Cossacks\nwould not like to be a headman? The headman has an entry everywhere, and\nevery stalwart rustic stands respectfully, cap in hand, so long as the\nheadman feels round his snuff-box with his thick, coarse finger. In\nparish-meetings and other assemblies, although his power may be limited\nby the votes of the majority, the headman still maintains the upper\nhand, and sends whom he chooses to make roads or dig ditches. In outward\nmanners he is morose and severe, and not fond of talking. Long ago, when\nthe Empress Catherine of blessed memory journeyed to the Crimea, he was\nchosen as one of her escort for two whole days, and had the high honour\nof sitting with the imperial coachman on the box.\n\nSince then the headman has formed the habit of shaking his head solemnly\nand thoughtfully, of stroking his long, drooping moustache, and of\ndarting hawk-like glances from his eyes. Whatever the topic of\nconversation may be, he manages to refer to his having accompanied the\nEmpress, and sat on the box of the imperial coach. He often pretends to\nbe hard of hearing, especially when he hears something that he does not\nlike. He has an aversion for dandies, and himself wears under a black\ncaftan of cloth, made at home, a simple, embroidered, woollen\nwaist-band. No one has seen him wear any other dress except, of course,\non the occasion of the Czarina's journey to the Crimea, when he wore a\nblue Cossack's uniform. Hardly anyone in the village remembers that\ntime, and he keeps the uniform packed up in a chest.\n\nThe headman is a widower, but his sister-in-law lives with him. She\ncooks his dinner and supper, keeps the house and furniture clean, weaves\nlinen, and acts as housekeeper generally. The village gossips say that\nshe is not a relation of his; but we must remark that the headman has\nmany enemies who spread all kinds of slanders about him. We have now\nsaid what we considered to be necessary about the headman, and the\ndrunken Kalenik is not yet half-way to his house. He continued to abuse\nthe headman in terms which might be expected from one in his condition.\n\n\nIII\n\nAN UNEXPECTED RIVAL--THE CONSPIRACY\n\n\"No, you fellows, I won't. What is the good of all those silly\ngoings-on? Aren't you tired of these foolish jokes? People already call\nus good-for-nothing scapegraces. Better go to bed!\" So Levko said one\nevening to his companions, who were trying to persuade him to take part\nwith them in further practical jokes. \"Farewell, brothers! Good night!\"\nhe said, and left them with quick steps.\n\n\"Does my bright-eyed Hanna sleep?\" he thought as he passed the house\nshaded by the cherry-trees. Then in the silence he heard the sound of a\nwhispered conversation. Levko stood still. Between the trees there\nglimmered something white. \"What is that?\" he thought, as he crept\ncloser and hid himself behind a tree.\n\nBy the light of the moon he saw the face of a girl standing opposite\nhim. It was Hanna. But who was the tall man who had his back turned to\nhim? In vain he strained his eyes; the whole figure was hidden in\nshadow, and the slightest forward step on Levko's part would expose him\nto the risk of discovery. He therefore leant quietly against the tree,\nand determined to remain where he was. Then he heard the girl utter his\nname distinctly.\n\n\"Levko? Levko is a baby,\" said the tall man in an undertone. \"If I ever\nfind him with you, I will pull his hair.\"\n\n\"I should like to know what rascal is boasting of pulling my hair,\" said\nLevko to himself, stretching out his head and endeavouring to miss no\nword. But the stranger continued to speak so low that he was inaudible.\n\n\"What, aren't you ashamed?\" said Hanna after he had finished. \"You are\nlying and deceiving me; I will never believe that you love me.\"\n\n\"I know,\" continued the tall man, \"that Levko has talked nonsense to you\nand turned your head.\" (Here it seemed to the Cossack as though the\nstranger's voice were not quite unknown to him, and that he must have\nheard it somewhere or other.) \"But Levko shall learn to know me,\"\ncontinued the stranger. \"He thinks I don't notice his rascally tricks;\nbut he will yet feel the weight of my fists, the scoundrel!\"\n\nAt these words Levko could no longer restrain his wrath. He came three\nsteps nearer, and took a run in order to plant a blow which would have\nstretched the stranger on the ground in spite of his strength. At that\nmoment, however, a ray of light fell on the latter's face, and Levko\nstood transfixed, for he saw it was his father. But he only expressed\nhis surprise by an involuntary shake of the head and a low whistle.\n\nOn the other side there was the sound of approaching footsteps. Hanna\nran hastily into the house and closed the door behind her.\n\n\"Good-bye, Hanna!\" cried one of the youths, who had stolen up and\nembraced the headman, but started back alarmed when he felt a rough\nmoustache.\n\n\"Good-bye, my darling!\" cried another, but speedily executed a\nsomersault in consequence of a violent blow from the headman.\n\n\"Good-bye, good-bye, Hanna!\" exclaimed several youths, falling on his\nneck.\n\n\"Go to the deuce, you infernal scoundrels!\" shouted the headman,\ndefending himself with both hands and feet. \"What kind of Hanna do you\ntake me for? Hang yourselves like your fathers did, you children of the\ndevil! Falling on one like flies on honey! I will show you who Hanna\nis!\"\n\n\"The headman! The headman! It is the headman!\" cried the youths, running\naway in all directions.\n\n\"Aha, father!\" said Levko to himself, recovering from his astonishment\nand looking after the headman as he departed, cursing and scolding.\n\"Those are the tricks you like to play! Splendid! And I wonder and\npuzzle my head why he pretends to be deaf when I only touch on the\nmatter! Wait, you old sinner, I will teach you to cajole other people's\nsweethearts. Hi! you fellows, come here!\" he cried, beckoning to the\nyouths, who gathered round him. \"Come nearer! I told you to go to bed,\nbut I am differently minded now, and am ready to go round with you all\nnight.\"\n\n\"That is reasonable,\" exclaimed a broad-shouldered, stout fellow, who\nwas regarded as the chief toper and good-for-nothing in the village. \"I\nalways feel uncomfortable if I do not have a good fling, and play some\npractical jokes. I always feel as though there were something wanting,\nas though I had lost my cap or my pipe--in a word, I don't feel like a\nproper Cossack then!\"\n\n\"Do you really want to bait the headman?\" asked Levko.\n\n\"The headman?\"\n\n\"Yes, the headman. I don't know for whom he takes himself. He carries on\nas though he were a duke. It is not only that he treats us as if we were\nhis serfs, but he comes after our girls.\"\n\n\"Quite right! That is true!\" exclaimed all the youths together.\n\n\"But are we made of any worse stuff than he? We are, thank God! free\nCossacks. Let us show him so.\"\n\n\"Yes, we will show him!\" they shouted. \"But when we go for the headman,\nwe must not forget his clerk.\"\n\n\"The clerk shall have his share, too. Just now a song that suits the\nheadman occurs to me. Go on! I will teach it you!\" continued Levko,\nstriking the strings of his guitar. \"But listen! Disguise yourselves as\nwell as you can.\"\n\n\"Hurrah for the Cossacks!\" cried the stout reveller, dancing and\nclapping his hands. \"Long live freedom! When one lets the reins go, one\nthinks of the good old times. It feels as jolly as though one were in\nparadise. Hurrah, you fellows! Go ahead!\"\n\nThe youths rushed noisily through the village street, and the pious old\nwomen, aroused from their sleep, looked through the windows, crossed\nthemselves drowsily, and thought, \"There they go, the wild young\nfellows!\"\n\n\nIV\n\nWILD PRANKS\n\nOnly in one house at the end of the street there still burned a light;\nit was the headman's. He had long finished his supper, and would\ncertainly have gone to sleep but that he had a guest with him, the\nbrandy-distiller. The latter had been sent to superintend the building\nof a distillery for the lords of the manor, who possessed small\nallotments between the lands of the free Cossacks. At the upper end of\nthe table, in the place of honour, sat the guest--a short, stout man\nwith small, merry eyes. He smoked his short pipe with obvious\nsatisfaction, spitting every moment and constantly pushing the tobacco\ndown in the bowl. The clouds of smoke collected over his head, and\nveiled him in a bluish mist. It seemed as though the broad chimney of a\ndistillery, which was bored at always being perched up on the roof, had\nhit upon the idea of taking a little recreation, and had now settled\nitself comfortably at the headman's table. Close under his nose bristled\nhis short, thick moustache, which in the dim, smoky atmosphere resembled\na mouse which the distiller had caught and held in his mouth, usurping\nthe functions of a dining-room cat. The headman sat there, as master of\nthe house, wearing only his shirt and linen breeches. His eagle eye\nbegan to grow dim like the setting sun, and to half close. At the lower\nend of the table sat, smoking his pipe, one of the village council, of\nwhich the headman was superintendent. Out of respect for the latter he\nhad not removed his caftan.\n\n\"How soon do you think,\" asked the headman, turning to the distiller and\nputting his hand before his gaping mouth, \"will you have the distillery\nput up?\"\n\n\"With God's help we shall be distilling brandy this autumn. On\nConception Day I bet the headman will be tracing the figure eight with\nhis feet on his way home.\" So saying, the distiller laughed so heartily\nthat his small eyes disappeared altogether, his body was convulsed, and\nhis twitching lips actually let go of the reeking pipe for a moment.\n\n\"God grant it!\" said the headman, on whose face the shadow of a smile\nwas visible. \"Now, thank heaven, the number of distilleries is\nincreasing a little; but in the old days, when I accompanied the Czarina\non the Perejlaslov Road, and the late Besborodko----\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend, those were bad times. Then from Krementchuk to Romen\nthere were hardly two distilleries. And now--but have you heard what the\ninfernal Germans have invented? They say they will no longer use wood\nfor fuel in the distilleries, but devilish steam.\" At these words the\ndistiller stared at the table reflectively, and at his arms resting on\nit. \"But how they can use steam--by heavens! I don't know.\"\n\n\"What fools these Germans are!\" said the headman. \"I should like to give\nthese sons of dogs a good thrashing. Whoever heard of cooking with\nsteam? At this rate one will not be able to get a spoonful of porridge\nor a bit of bacon into one's mouth.\"\n\n\"And you, friend,\" broke in the headman's sister-in-law, who was sitting\nby the stove; \"will you be with us the whole time without your wife?\"\n\n\"Do I want her then? If she were only passably good-looking----\"\n\n\"She is not pretty, then?\" asked the headman with a questioning glance.\n\n\"How should she be; as old as Satan, and with a face as full of wrinkles\nas an empty purse,\" said the distiller, shaking again with laughter.\n\nThen a noise was heard at the door, which opened and a Cossack stepped\nover the threshold without removing his cap, and remained standing in an\nabsent-minded way in the middle of the room, with open mouth and gazing\nat the ceiling. It was Kalenik, whose acquaintance we have already made.\n\n\"Now I am at home,\" he said, taking his seat by the door, without taking\nany notice of those present. \"Ah! to what a length Satan made the road\nstretch. I went on and on, and there was no end. My legs are quite\nbroken. Woman, bring me my fur blanket to lie down on. There it is in\nthe corner; but mind you don't upset the little pot of snuff. But no;\nbetter not touch it! Leave it alone! You are really quite drunk--I had\nbetter get it myself.\"\n\nKalenik tried to rise, but an invincible power fettered him to his seat.\n\n\"That's a nice business!\" said the headman. \"He comes into a strange\nhouse, and behaves as though he were at home! Push him out, in heaven's\nname!\"\n\n\"Let him rest a bit, friend!\" said the distiller, seizing the headman's\narm. \"The man is very useful; if we had only plenty of this kind, our\ndistillery would get on grandly....\" For the rest, it was not\ngood-nature which inspired these words. The distiller was full of\nsuperstition, and to turn out a man who had already sat down, seemed to\nhim to be tantamount to invoking the devil.\n\n\"That comes of being old,\" grumbled Kalenik, stretching himself out\nalong the seat. \"People might say I was drunk, but no, I am not! Why\nshould I lie? I am ready to tell the headman to his face! Who is the\nheadman anyway? May he break his neck, the son of a dog! I spit at him!\nMay he be run over by a cart, the one-eyed devil!\"\n\n\"Ah! the drunken sot has crawled into the house, and now he lays his\npaws on the table,\" said the headman, rising angrily; but at that moment\na heavy stone, breaking a window-pane to pieces, fell at his feet. The\nheadman remained standing. \"If I knew,\" he said, \"what jail-bird has\nthrown it, I would give him something. What devil's trick is this?\" he\ncontinued, looking at the stone, which he held in his hand, with burning\neyes. \"I wish I could choke him with it!\"\n\n\"Stop! Stop! God preserve you, friend!\" broke in the distiller, looking\npale. \"God keep you in this world and the next, but don't curse anyone\nso.\"\n\n\"Ah! now we have his defender! May he be ruined!\"\n\n\"Listen, friend! You don't know what happened to my late mother-in-law.\"\n\n\"Your mother-in-law?\"\n\n\"Yes, my mother-in-law. One evening, perhaps rather earlier than this,\nthey were sitting at supper, my late mother-in-law, my father-in-law,\ntheir two servants, and five children. My mother-in-law emptied some\ndumplings from the cooking-pot into a dish in order to cool them. But\nthe others, being hungry after the day's work, did not wait till they\nwere quite cooled, but stuck their long wooden forks into them and ate\nthem at once. All at once a stranger entered--heaven knows whence!--and\nasked to be allowed to share their meal. They could not refuse to feed a\nhungry man, and gave him also a wooden fork. But the guest made as short\nwork with the dumplings as a cow with hay. Before the family had each of\nthem finished his or her dumpling and reached out their forks again for\nanother, the dish had been swept as clean as the floor of a nobleman's\ndrawing-room. My mother-in-law emptied out some more dumplings; she\nthought to herself, 'Now the guest is satisfied, and will not be so\ngreedy.' But on the contrary, he began to swallow them faster than ever,\nand emptied the second dish also. 'May one of them choke you!' said my\nmother-in-law under her breath. Suddenly the guest seemed to try to\nclear his throat, and fell back. They rushed to his help, but his breath\nhad stopped and he was dead.\"\n\n\"Served him right, the cursed glutton!\"\n\n\"But it turned out quite otherwise; since that time my mother-in-law has\nno rest. No sooner is it dark than the dead man approaches the house. He\nthen sits astride the chimney, the scoundrel, holding a dumpling between\nhis teeth. During the day it is quite quiet--one hears and sees nothing;\nbut as soon as it begins to grow dark, and one casts a look at the roof,\nthere he is comfortably perched on the chimney!\"\n\n\"A wonderful story, friend! I heard something similar from my late----\"\n\nThen the headman suddenly stopped. Outside there were noises, and the\nstamping of dancers' feet. The strings of a guitar were being struck\ngently, to the accompaniment of a voice. Then the guitar was played more\nloudly, many voices joined in, and the whole chorus struck up a song in\nridicule of the headman.\n\nWhen it was over, the distiller said, with his head bent a little on one\nside, to the headman who was almost petrified by the audacity of the\nserenaders, \"A fine song, my friend!\"\n\n\"Very fine! Only it is a pity that they insult the headman.\"\n\nHe folded his arms with a certain measure of composure on the table, and\nprepared to listen further, for the singing and noise outside continued.\nA sharp observer, however, would have seen that it was not mere\ntorpidity which made the headman sit so quietly. In the same way a\ncrafty cat often allows an inexperienced mouse to play about her tail,\nwhile she is quickly devising a plan to cut it off from the mouse-hole.\nThe headman's one eye was still fastened on the window, and his hand,\nafter he had given the village councillor a sign, was reaching for the\ndoor-handle, when suddenly a loud noise and shouts were heard from the\nstreet. The distiller, who beside many other characteristics possessed a\nkeen curiosity, laid down his pipe quickly and ran into the street; but\nthe ne'er-do-wells had all dispersed.\n\n\"No, you don't escape me!\" cried the headman, dragging someone muffled\nup in a sheepskin coat with the hair turned outwards, by the arm.\n\nThe distiller rapidly seized a favourable moment to look at the face of\nthis disturber of the peace; but he started back when he saw a long\nbeard and a grim, painted face.\n\n\"No, you don't escape me!\" exclaimed the headman again as he dragged his\nprisoner into the vestibule.\n\nThe latter offered no resistance, and followed him as quietly as though\nit had been his own house.\n\n\"Karpo, open the store-room!\" the headman called to the village\ncouncillor. \"We will throw him in there! Then we will awake the clerk,\ncall the village council together, catch this impudent rabble, and pass\nour sentence on them at once.\"\n\nThe village councillor unlocked the store-room; then in the darkness of\nthe vestibule, the prisoner made a desperate effort to break loose from\nthe headman's arms.\n\n\"Ah! you would, would you?\" exclaimed the headman, holding him more\nfirmly by the collar.\n\n\"Let me go! It is I!\" a half-stifled voice was heard saying.\n\n\"It is no good, brother! You may squeal if you choose, like the devil,\ninstead of imitating a woman, but you won't get round me.\" So saying, he\nthrust the prisoner with such violence into the dark room that he fell\non the ground and groaned aloud.\n\nThe victorious headman, accompanied by the village councillor, now\nbetook himself to the clerk's; they were followed by the distiller, who\nwas veiled in clouds of tobacco-smoke, and resembled a steamer.\n\nThey were all three walking reflectively with bent heads, when suddenly,\nturning into a dark side-alley, they uttered a cry and started back in\nconsequence of coming into collision with three other men, who on their\nside shouted with equal loudness. The headman saw with his one eye, to\nhis no small astonishment, the clerk with two village councillors.\n\n\"I was just coming to you, Mr Notary.\"\n\n\"And I was on my way to your honour.\"\n\n\"These are strange goings-on, Mr Notary.\"\n\n\"Indeed they are, your honour.\"\n\n\"Have you seen them then?\" asked the headman, surprised.\n\n\"The young fellows are roaming about the streets using vile language.\nThey are abusing your honour in a way--in a word, it is a scandal. A\ndrunken Russian would be ashamed to use such words.\"\n\nThe lean notary, in his gaily striped breeches and yeast-coloured\nwaistcoat, kept on stretching forward and drawing back his neck while he\ntalked.\n\n\"Hardly had I gone to sleep,\" he continued, \"than the cursed loafers\nwoke me up with their shameful songs and their noise. I meant to give\nthem a sound rating, but while I was putting on my breeches and vest,\nthey all ran away. But the ringleader has not escaped; for the present\nhe is shut up in the hut which we use as a prison. I was very curious to\nknow who the scapegrace is, but his face is as sooty as the devil's when\nhe forges nails for sinners.\"\n\n\"What clothes does he wear, Mr Notary?\"\n\n\"The son of a dog wears a black sheepskin coat turned inside out, your\nhonour.\"\n\n\"Aren't you telling me a lie, Mr Notary? The same good-for-nothing is\nnow shut up in my store-room under lock and key.\"\n\n\"No, your honour! You have drawn the long bow a little yourself, and\nshould not be vexed at what I say.\"\n\n\"Bring a light! We will take a look at him at once!\"\n\nThey returned to the headman's house; the store-room door was opened,\nand the headman groaned for sheer amazement as he saw his sister-in-law\nstanding before him.\n\n\"Tell me then,\" she said, stepping forward, \"have you quite lost your\nsenses? Had you a single particle of brains in your one-eyed fish-head\nwhen you locked me up in the dark room? It is a mercy I did not break my\nhead against the iron door hinge. Didn't I shout out that it was I? Then\nhe seized me, the cursed bear, with his iron claws, and pushed me in.\nMay Satan hereafter so push you into hell!\" The last words she spoke\nfrom the street, having wisely gone out of his reach.\n\n\"Yes, now I see that it is you!\" said the headman, who had slowly\nrecovered his composure.\n\n\"Is he not a scamp and a scoundrel, Mr Clerk?\" he continued.\n\n\"Yes, certainly, your honour.\"\n\n\"Isn't it high time to give all these loose fellows a lesson, that they\nmay at last betake themselves to their work?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is high time, your honour.\"\n\n\"The fools have combined in a gang. What the deuce is that? It sounded\nlike my sister-in-law's voice. The blockheads think that I am like her,\nan ordinary Cossack.\"\n\nHere he coughed and cleared his throat, and a gleam in his eyes showed\nthat he was about to say something very important. \"In the year one\nthousand--I cannot keep these cursed dates in my memory, if I was to be\nkilled for it. Well, never mind when it was, the Commissary Ledatcho was\ncommanded to choose out a Cossack who was cleverer than the rest. Yes,\"\nhe added, raising his forefinger, \"cleverer than the rest, to accompany\nthe Czar. Then I was----\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" the notary interrupted him, \"we all know, headman, that you\nwell deserved the imperial favour. But confess now that I was right: you\nmade a mistake when you declared that you had caught the vagabond in the\nreversed sheepskin.\"\n\n\"This disguised devil I will have imprisoned to serve as a warning to\nthe rest. They will have to learn what authority means. Who has\nappointed the headman, if not the Czar? Then we will tackle the other\nfellows. I don't forget how the scamps drove a whole herd of swine into\nmy garden, which ate up all the cabbages and cucumbers; I don't forget\nhow those sons of devils refused to thrash my rye for me. I don't\nforget--to the deuce with them! We must first find out who this\nscoundrel in the sheepskin really is.\"\n\n\"He is a sly dog anyway,\" said the distiller, whose cheeks during the\nwhole conversation had been as full of smoke as a siege-cannon, and\nwhose lips, when he took his pipe out of his mouth, seemed to emit\nsparks.\n\nMeanwhile they had approached a small ruined hut. Their curiosity had\nmounted to the highest pitch, and they pressed round the door. The\nnotary produced a key and tried to turn the lock, but it did not fit; it\nwas the key of his trunk. The impatience of the onlookers increased. He\nplunged his hand into the wide pocket of his gaily striped breeches,\nbent his back, scraped with his feet, uttered imprecations, and at last\ncried triumphantly, \"I have it!\"\n\nAt these words the hearts of our heroes beat so loud, that the turning\nof the key in the lock was almost inaudible. At last the door opened,\nand the headman turned as white as a sheet. The distiller felt a shiver\nrun down his spine, and his hair stood on end. Terror and apprehension\nwere stamped on the notary's face; the village councillors almost sank\ninto the ground and could not shut their wide-open mouths. Before them\nstood the headman's sister-in-law!\n\nShe was not less startled than they, but recovered herself somewhat, and\nmade a movement as if to approach them.\n\n\"Stop!\" cried the headman in an excited voice, and slammed the door\nagain. \"Sirs, Satan is behind this!\" he continued. \"Bring fire quickly!\nNever mind the hut! Set it alight and burn it up so that not even the\nwitch's bones remain.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, brother!\" exclaimed the distiller. \"Your hair is grey,\nbut you are not very intelligent; no ordinary fire will burn a witch.\nOnly the fire of a pipe can do it. I will manage it all right.\" So\nsaying, he shook some glowing ashes from his pipe on to a bundle of\nstraw, and began to fan the flame.\n\nDespair gave the unfortunate woman courage; she began to implore them in\na loud voice.\n\n\"Stop a moment, brother! Perhaps we are incurring guilt needlessly.\nPerhaps she is really no witch!\" said the notary. \"If the person sitting\nin there declares herself ready to make the sign of the cross, then she\nis not a child of the devil.\"\n\nThe proposal was accepted. \"Look out, Satan!\" continued the notary,\nspeaking at a chink in the door. \"If you promise not to move, we will\nopen the door.\"\n\nThe door was opened.\n\n\"Cross yourself!\" exclaimed the headman, looking round him for a safe\nplace of retreat in case of necessity.\n\nHis sister-in-law crossed herself.\n\n\"The deuce! It is really you, sister-in-law!\"\n\n\"What evil spirit dragged you into this hole, friend?\" asked the notary.\n\nThe headman's sister related amid sobs how the rioters had seized her on\nthe street, and in spite of her resistance, pushed her through a large\nwindow into the hut, on which they had closed the shutters. The notary\nlooked and found that the bolt of the shutter had been wrenched off, and\nthat it was held in its place by a wooden bar placed across it outside.\n\n\"You are a nice fellow, you one-eyed Satan!\" she now exclaimed,\nadvancing towards the headman, who stepped backwards and continued to\ncontemplate her from head to foot. \"I know your thoughts; you were glad\nof an opportunity to get me shut up in order to run after that\npetticoat, so that no one could see the grey-haired sinner making a fool\nof himself. You think I don't know how you talked this evening with\nHanna. Oh, I know everything. You must get up earlier if you want to\nmake a fool of me, you great stupid! I have endured for a long time, but\nat last don't take it ill if----\"\n\nShe made a threatening gesture with her fist, and ran away swiftly,\nleaving the headman quite taken aback.\n\n\"The devil really has something to do with it!\" he thought, rubbing his\nbald head.\n\n\"We have him!\" now exclaimed the two village councillors as they\napproached.\n\n\"Whom have you?\" asked the headman.\n\n\"The devil in the sheepskin.\"\n\n\"Bring him here!\" cried the headman, seizing the prisoner by the arm.\n\"Are you mad? This is the drunken Kalenik!\"\n\n\"It is witchcraft! He was in our hands, your honour!\" replied the\nvillage councillors. \"The rascals were rushing about in the narrow\nside-streets, dancing and behaving like idiots--the devil take them! How\nit was we got hold of this fellow instead of him, heaven only knows!\"\n\n\"In virtue of my authority, and that of the village assembly,\" said the\nheadman, \"I issue the order to seize these robbers and other young\nvagabonds which may be met with in the streets, and to bring them before\nme to be dealt with.\"\n\n\"Excuse us, your honour,\" answered the village councillors, bowing low.\n\"If you could only see the hideous faces they had; may heaven punish us\nif ever anyone has seen such miscreations since he was born and\nbaptised. These devils might frighten one into an illness.\"\n\n\"I'll teach you to be afraid! You won't obey then? You are certainly in\nthe conspiracy with them! You mutineers! What is the meaning of that?\nWhat? You abet robbery and murder! You!--I will inform the Commissary.\nGo at once, do you hear; fly like birds. I shall--you will----\"\n\nThey all dispersed in different directions.\n\n\nV\n\nTHE DROWNED GIRL\n\nWithout troubling himself in the least about those who had been sent to\npursue him, the originator of all this confusion slowly walked towards\nthe old house and the pool. We hardly need to say it was Levko. His\nblack fur coat was buttoned up; he carried his cap in his hand, and the\nperspiration was pouring down his face. The moon poured her light on the\ngloomy majesty of the dark maple-wood.\n\nThe coolness of the air round the motionless pool enticed the weary\nwanderer to rest by it a while. Universal silence prevailed, only that\nin the forest thickets the nightingales' songs were heard. An\noverpowering drowsiness closed his eyes; his tired limbs relaxed, and\nhis head nodded.\n\n\"Ah! am I going to sleep?\" he said, rising and rubbing his eyes.\n\nHe looked round; the night seemed to him still more beautiful. The\nmoonlight seemed to have an intoxicating quality about it, a glamour\nwhich he had never perceived before. The landscape was veiled in a\nsilver mist. The air was redolent with the perfume of the apple-blossoms\nand the night-flowers. Entranced, he gazed on the motionless pool. The\nold, half-ruined house was clearly reflected without a quiver in the\nwater. But instead of dark shutters, he saw light streaming from\nbrilliantly lit windows. Presently one of them opened. Holding his\nbreath, and without moving a muscle, he fastened his eyes on the pool\nand seemed to penetrate its depths. What did he see? First he saw at the\nwindow a graceful, curly head with shining eyes, propped on a white arm;\nthe head moved and smiled. His heart suddenly began to beat. The water\nbegan to break into ripples, and the window closed.\n\nQuietly he withdrew from the pool, and looked towards the house. The\ndark shutters were flung back; the window-panes gleamed in the\nmoonlight. \"How little one can believe what people say!\" he thought to\nhimself. \"The house is brand-new, and looks as though it had only just\nbeen painted. It is certainly inhabited.\"\n\nHe stepped nearer cautiously, but the house was quite silent. The clear\nsong of the nightingales rose powerfully and distinctly on the air, and\nas they died away one heard the chirping and rustling of the\ngrasshoppers, and the marshbird clapping his slippery beak in the water.\n\nLevko felt enraptured with the sweetness and stillness of the night. He\nstruck the strings of his guitar and sang:\n\n    \"Oh lovely moon\n       Thou steepst in light\n     The house where my darling\n       Sleeps all night.\"\n\nA window opened gently, and the same girl whose image he had seen in the\npool looked out and listened attentively to the song. Her long-lashed\neyelids were partly drooping over her eyes; she was as pale as the\nmoonlight, but wonderfully beautiful. She smiled, and a shiver ran\nthrough Levko.\n\n\"Sing me a song, young Cossack!\" she said gently, bending her head\nsideways and quite closing her eyes.\n\n\"What song shall I sing you, dear girl?\"\n\nTears rolled down her pale cheeks. \"Cossack,\" she said, and there was\nsomething inexpressibly touching in her tone, \"Cossack, find my\nstepmother for me. I will do everything for you; I will reward you; I\nwill give you abundant riches. I have armlets embroidered with silk and\ncoral necklaces; I will give you a girdle set with pearls. I have gold.\nCossack, seek my stepmother for me. She is a terrible witch; she allowed\nme no peace in the beautiful world. She tortured me; she made me work\nlike a common maid-servant. Look at my face; she has banished the\nredness from my cheeks with her unholy magic. Look at my white neck;\nthey cannot be washed away, they cannot be washed away--the blue marks\nof her iron claws. Look at my white feet; they did not walk on carpets,\nbut on hot sand, on damp ground, on piercing thorns. And my eyes--look\nat them; they are almost blind with weeping. Seek my stepmother!\"\n\nHer voice, which had gradually become louder, stopped, and she wept.\n\nThe Cossack felt overpowered by sympathy and grief. \"I am ready to do\neverything to please you, dear lady,\" he cried with deep emotion; \"but\nwhere and how can I find her?\"\n\n\"Look, look!\" she said quickly, \"she is here! She dances on the\nlake-shore with my maidens, and warms herself in the moonlight. Yet she\nis cunning and sly. She has assumed the shape of one who is drowned, yet\nI know and hear that she is present. I am so afraid of her. Because of\nher I cannot swim free and light as a fish. I sink and fall to the\nbottom like a piece of iron. Look for her, Cossack!\"\n\nLevko cast a glance at the lake-shore. In a silvery mist there moved,\nlike shadows, girls in white dresses decked with May flowers; gold\nnecklaces and coins gleamed on their necks; but they were very pale, as\nthough formed of transparent clouds. They danced nearer him, and he\ncould hear their voices, somewhat like the sound of reeds stirred in the\nquiet evening by the breeze.\n\n\"Let us play the raven-game! Let us play the raven-game!\"\n\n\"Who will be the raven?\"\n\nLots were cast, and a girl stepped out of the line of the dancers.\n\nLevko observed her attentively. Her face and clothing resembled those of\nthe others; but she was evidently unwilling to play the part assigned\nher. The dancers revolved rapidly round her, without her being able to\ncatch one of them.\n\n\"No, I won't be the raven any more,\" she said, quite exhausted. \"I do\nnot like to rob the poor mother-hen of her chickens.\"\n\n\"You are not a witch,\" thought Levko.\n\nThe girls again gathered together in order to cast lots who should be\nthe raven.\n\n\"I will be the raven!\" called one from the midst.\n\nLevko watched her closely. Boldly and rapidly she ran after the dancers,\nand made every effort to catch her prey. Levko began to notice that her\nbody was not transparent like the others; there was something black in\nthe midst of it. Suddenly there was a cry; the \"raven\" had rushed on a\ngirl, embraced her, and it seemed to Levko as though she had stretched\nout claws, and as though her face shone with malicious joy.\n\n\"Witch!\" he cried out, pointing at her suddenly with his finger, and\nturning towards the house.\n\nThe girl at the window laughed, and the other girls dragged the \"raven\"\nscreaming along with them.\n\n\"How shall I reward you, Cossack?\" said the maiden. \"I know you do not\nneed gold; you love Hanna, but her harsh father will not allow you to\nmarry. But give him this note, and he will cease to hinder it.\"\n\nShe stretched out her white hand, and her face shone wonderfully. With\nstrange shudders and a beating heart, he grasped the paper and--awoke.\n\n\nVI\n\nTHE AWAKENING\n\n\"Have I then been really asleep?\" Levko asked himself as he stood up.\n\"Everything seemed so real, as though I were awake. Wonderful!\nWonderful!\" he repeated, looking round him. The position of the moon\nvertical overhead showed that it was midnight; a waft of coolness came\nfrom the pool. The ruined house with the closed shutters stood there\nwith a melancholy aspect; the moss and weeds which grew thickly upon it\nshowed that it had not been entered by any human foot for a long time.\nThen he suddenly opened his hand, which had been convulsively clenched\nduring his sleep, and cried aloud with astonishment when he saw the note\nin it. \"Ah! if I could only read,\" he thought, turning it this way and\nthat. At that moment he heard a noise behind him.\n\n\"Fear nothing! Lay hold of him! What are you afraid of? There are ten of\nus. I wager that he is a man, and not the devil.\"\n\nIt was the headman encouraging his companions.\n\nLevko felt himself seized by several arms, many of which were trembling\nwith fear.\n\n\"Throw off your mask, friend! Cease trying to fool us,\" said the\nheadman, taking him by the collar. But he started back when he saw him\nclosely. \"Levko! My son!\" he exclaimed, letting his arms sink. \"It is\nyou, miserable boy! I thought some rascal, or disguised devil, was\nplaying these tricks; but now it seems you have cooked this mess for\nyour own father--placed yourself at the head of a band of robbers, and\ncomposed songs to ridicule him. Eh, Levko! What is the meaning of that?\nIt seems your back is itching. Tie him fast!\"\n\n\"Stop, father! I have been ordered to give you this note,\" said Levko.\n\n\"Let me see it then! But bind him all the same.\"\n\n\"Wait, headman,\" said the notary, unfolding the note; \"it is the\nCommissary's handwriting!\"\n\n\"The Commissary's?\"\n\n\"The Commissary's?\" echoed the village councillors mechanically.\n\n\"The Commissary's? Wonderful! Still more incomprehensible!\" thought\nLevko.\n\n\"Read! Read!\" said the headman. \"What does the Commissary write?\"\n\n\"Let us hear!\" exclaimed the distiller, holding his pipe between his\nteeth, and lighting it.\n\nThe notary cleared his throat and began to read.\n\n    \"'Order to the headman, Javtuk Makohonenko.\n\n    \"'It has been brought to our knowledge that you, old id----'\"\n\n\"Stop! Stop! That is unnecessary!\" exclaimed the headman. \"Even if I\nhave not heard it, I know that that is not the chief matter. Read\nfurther!\"\n\n    \"'Consequently I order you at once to marry your son, Levko\n    Makohonenko, to the Cossack's daughter, Hanna Petritchenka, to\n    repair the bridges on the post-road, and to give no horses belonging\n    to the lords of the manor to the county-court magistrates without my\n    knowledge. If on my arrival I do not find these orders carried out,\n    I shall hold you singly responsible.\n\n    \"'Lieut. Kosma Derkatch-Drischpanowski,\n\n    \"'_Commissary_.'\"\n\n\"There we have it!\" exclaimed the headman, with his mouth open. \"Have\nyou heard it? The headman is made responsible for everything, and\ntherefore everyone has to obey him without contradiction! Otherwise, I\nbeg to resign my office. And you,\" he continued, turning to Levko, \"I\nwill have married, as the Commissary directs, though it seems to me\nstrange how he knows of the affair; but you will get a taste of my knout\nfirst--the one, you know, which hangs on the wall at my bed-head. But\nhow did you get hold of the note?\"\n\nLevko, in spite of the astonishment which the unexpected turn of affairs\ncaused him, had had the foresight to prepare an answer, and to conceal\nthe way in which the note had come into his possession. \"I was in the\ntown last night,\" he said, \"and met the Commissary just as he was\nalighting from his droshky. When he heard from which village I was he\ngave me the note and bid me tell you by word of mouth, father, that he\nwould dine with us on his way back.\"\n\n\"Did he say that?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have you heard it?\" said the headman, with a solemn air turning to his\ncompanions. \"The Commissary himself, in his own person, comes to us,\nthat is to me, to dine.\" The headman lifted a finger and bent his head\nas though he were listening to something. \"The Commissary, do you hear,\nthe Commissary is coming to dine with me! What do you think, Mr Notary?\nAnd what do you think, friend? That is not a little honour, is it?\"\n\n\"As far as I can recollect,\" the notary broke in, \"no Commissary has\never dined with a headman.\"\n\n\"All headmen are not alike,\" he answered with a self-satisfied air. Then\nhe uttered a hoarse laugh and said, \"What do you think, Mr Notary? Isn't\nit right to order that in honour of the distinguished guest, a fowl,\nlinen, and other things should be offered by every cottage?\"\n\n\"Yes, they should.\"\n\n\"And when is the wedding to be, father?\" asked Levko.\n\n\"Wedding! I should like to celebrate your wedding in my way! Well, in\nhonour of the distinguished guest, to-morrow the pope(1) will marry you.\nLet the Commissary see that you are punctual. Now, children, we will go\nto bed. Go to your houses. The present occasion reminds me of the time\nwhen I----\" At these words the headman assumed his customary solemn air.\n\n  (1) Village priest.\n\n\"Now the headman will relate how he accompanied the Czarina!\" said Levko\nto himself, and hastened quickly, and full of joy, to the\ncherry-tree-shaded house, which we know. \"May God bless you, beloved,\nand the holy angels smile on you. To no one will I relate the wonders of\nthis night except to you, Hanna; you alone will believe it, and pray\nwith me for the repose of the souls of the poor drowned maidens.\"\n\nHe approached the house; the window was open; the moonbeams fell on\nHanna, who was sleeping by it. Her head was supported on her arm; her\ncheeks glowed; her lips moved, gently murmuring his name.\n\n\"Sleep sweetly, my darling. Dream of everything that is good, and yet\nthe awaking will surpass all.\" He made the sign of the cross over her,\nclosed the window, and gently withdrew.\n\nIn a few moments the whole village was buried in slumber. Only the moon\nhung as brilliant and wonderful as before in the immensity of the\nUkraine sky. The divine night continued her reign in solemn stillness,\nwhile the earth lay bathed in silvery radiance. The universal silence\nwas only broken here and there by the bark of a dog; only the drunken\nKalenik still wandered about the empty streets seeking for his house.\n\n\n\n\nTHE VIY\n\n\n    (The \"Viy\" is a monstrous creation of popular fancy. It is the name\n    which the inhabitants of Little Russia give to the king of the\n    gnomes, whose eyelashes reach to the ground. The following story is\n    a specimen of such folk-lore. I have made no alterations, but\n    reproduce it in the same simple form in which I heard it.--Author's\n    Note.)\n\n\nI\n\nAs soon as the clear seminary bell began sounding in Kieff in the\nmorning, the pupils would come flocking from all parts of the town. The\nstudents of grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, and theology hastened with\ntheir books under their arms over the streets.\n\nThe \"grammarians\" were still mere boys. On the way they pushed against\neach other and quarrelled with shrill voices. Nearly all of them wore\ntorn or dirty clothes, and their pockets were always crammed with all\nkinds of things--push-bones, pipes made out of pens, remains of\nconfectionery, and sometimes even young sparrows. The latter would\nsometimes begin to chirp in the midst of deep silence in the school, and\nbring down on their possessors severe canings and thrashings.\n\nThe \"rhetoricians\" walked in a more orderly way. Their clothes were\ngenerally untorn, but on the other hand their faces were often strangely\ndecorated; one had a black eye, and the lips of another resembled a\nsingle blister, etc. These spoke to each other in tenor voices.\n\nThe \"philosophers\" talked in a tone an octave lower; in their pockets\nthey only had fragments of tobacco, never whole cakes of it; for what\nthey could get hold of, they used at once. They smelt so strongly of\ntobacco and brandy, that a workman passing by them would often remain\nstanding and sniffing with his nose in the air, like a hound.\n\nAbout this time of day the market-place was generally full of bustle,\nand the market women, selling rolls, cakes, and honey-tarts, plucked the\nsleeves of those who wore coats of fine cloth or cotton.\n\n\"Young sir! Young sir! Here! Here!\" they cried from all sides. \"Rolls\nand cakes and tasty tarts, very delicious! I have baked them myself!\"\n\nAnother drew something long and crooked out of her basket and cried,\n\"Here is a sausage, young sir! Buy a sausage!\"\n\n\"Don't buy anything from her!\" cried a rival. \"See how greasy she is,\nand what a dirty nose and hands she has!\"\n\nBut the market women carefully avoided appealing to the philosophers and\ntheologians, for these only took handfuls of eatables merely to taste\nthem.\n\nArrived at the seminary, the whole crowd of students dispersed into the\nlow, large class-rooms with small windows, broad doors, and blackened\nbenches. Suddenly they were filled with a many-toned murmur. The\nteachers heard the pupils' lessons repeated, some in shrill and others\nin deep voices which sounded like a distant booming. While the lessons\nwere being said, the teachers kept a sharp eye open to see whether\npieces of cake or other dainties were protruding from their pupils'\npockets; if so, they were promptly confiscated.\n\nWhen this learned crowd arrived somewhat earlier than usual, or when it\nwas known that the teachers would come somewhat late, a battle would\nensue, as though planned by general agreement. In this battle all had to\ntake part, even the monitors who were appointed to look after the order\nand morality of the whole school. Two theologians generally arranged the\nconditions of the battle: whether each class should split into two\nsides, or whether all the pupils should divide themselves into two\nhalves.\n\nIn each case the grammarians began the battle, and after the\nrhetoricians had joined in, the former retired and stood on the benches,\nin order to watch the fortunes of the fray. Then came the philosophers\nwith long black moustaches, and finally the thick-necked theologians.\nThe battle generally ended in a victory for the latter, and the\nphilosophers retired to the different class-rooms rubbing their aching\nlimbs, and throwing themselves on the benches to take breath.\n\nWhen the teacher, who in his own time had taken part in such contests,\nentered the class-room he saw by the heated faces of his pupils that the\nbattle had been very severe, and while he caned the hands of the\nrhetoricians, in another room another teacher did the same for the\nphilosophers.\n\nOn Sundays and Festival Days the seminarists took puppet-theatres to the\ncitizens' houses. Sometimes they acted a comedy, and in that case it was\nalways a theologian who took the part of the hero or heroine--Potiphar\nor Herodias, etc. As a reward for their exertions, they received a piece\nof linen, a sack of maize, half a roast goose, or something similar. All\nthe students, lay and clerical, were very poorly provided with means for\nprocuring themselves necessary subsistence, but at the same time very\nfond of eating; so that, however much food was given to them, they were\nnever satisfied, and the gifts bestowed by rich landowners were never\nadequate for their needs.\n\nTherefore the Commissariat Committee, consisting of philosophers and\ntheologians, sometimes dispatched the grammarians and rhetoricians under\nthe leadership of a philosopher--themselves sometimes joining in the\nexpedition--with sacks on their shoulders, into the town, in order to\nlevy a contribution on the fleshpots of the citizens, and then there was\na feast in the seminary.\n\nThe most important event in the seminary year was the arrival of the\nholidays; these began in July, and then generally all the students went\nhome. At that time all the roads were thronged with grammarians,\nrhetoricians, philosophers, and theologians. He who had no home of his\nown, would take up his quarters with some fellow-student's family; the\nphilosophers and theologians looked out for tutors' posts, taught the\nchildren of rich farmers, and received for doing so a pair of new boots\nand sometimes also a new coat.\n\nA whole troop of them would go off in close ranks like a regiment; they\ncooked their porridge in common, and encamped under the open sky. Each\nhad a bag with him containing a shirt and a pair of socks. The\ntheologians were especially economical; in order not to wear out their\nboots too quickly, they took them off and carried them on a stick over\ntheir shoulders, especially when the road was very muddy. Then they\ntucked up their breeches over their knees and waded bravely through the\npools and puddles. Whenever they spied a village near the highway, they\nat once left it, approached the house which seemed the most\nconsiderable, and began with loud voices to sing a psalm. The master of\nthe house, an old Cossack engaged in agriculture, would listen for a\nlong time with his head propped in his hands, then with tears on his\ncheeks say to his wife, \"What the students are singing sounds very\ndevout; bring out some lard and anything else of the kind we have in the\nhouse.\"\n\nAfter thus replenishing their stores, the students would continue their\nway. The farther they went, the smaller grew their numbers, as they\ndispersed to their various houses, and left those whose homes were still\nfarther on.\n\nOn one occasion, during such a march, three students left the main-road\nin order to get provisions in some village, since their stock had long\nbeen exhausted. This party consisted of the theologian Khalava, the\nphilosopher Thomas Brutus, and the rhetorician Tiberius Gorobetz.\n\nThe first was a tall youth with broad shoulders and of a peculiar\ncharacter; everything which came within reach of his fingers he felt\nobliged to appropriate. Moreover, he was of a very melancholy\ndisposition, and when he had got intoxicated he hid himself in the most\ntangled thickets so that the seminary officials had the greatest trouble\nin finding him.\n\nThe philosopher Thomas Brutus was a more cheerful character. He liked to\nlie for a long time on the same spot and smoke his pipe; and when he was\nmerry with wine, he hired a fiddler and danced the \"tropak.\" Often he\ngot a whole quantity of \"beans,\" i.e. thrashings; but these he endured\nwith complete philosophic calm, saying that a man cannot escape his\ndestiny.\n\nThe rhetorician Tiberius Gorobetz had not yet the right to wear a\nmoustache, to drink brandy, or to smoke tobacco. He only wore a small\ncrop of hair, as though his character was at present too little\ndeveloped. To judge by the great bumps on his forehead, with which he\noften appeared in the class-room, it might be expected that some day he\nwould be a valiant fighter. Khalava and Thomas often pulled his hair as\na mark of their special favour, and sent him on their errands.\n\nEvening had already come when they left the high-road; the sun had just\ngone down, and the air was still heavy with the heat of the day. The\ntheologian and the philosopher strolled along, smoking in silence, while\nthe rhetorician struck off the heads of the thistles by the wayside with\nhis stick. The way wound on through thick woods of oak and walnut; green\nhills alternated here and there with meadows. Twice already they had\nseen cornfields, from which they concluded that they were near some\nvillage; but an hour had already passed, and no human habitation\nappeared. The sky was already quite dark, and only a red gleam lingered\non the western horizon.\n\n\"The deuce!\" said the philosopher Thomas Brutus. \"I was almost certain\nwe would soon reach a village.\"\n\nThe theologian still remained silent, looked round him, then put his\npipe again between his teeth, and all three continued their way.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" exclaimed the philosopher, and stood still. \"Now the\nroad itself is disappearing.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we shall find a farm farther on,\" answered the theologian,\nwithout taking his pipe out of his mouth.\n\nMeanwhile the night had descended; clouds increased the darkness, and\naccording to all appearance there was no chance of moon or stars\nappearing. The seminarists found that they had lost the way altogether.\n\nAfter the philosopher had vainly sought for a footpath, he exclaimed,\n\"Where have we got to?\"\n\nThe theologian thought for a while, and said, \"Yes, it is really dark.\"\n\nThe rhetorician went on one side, lay on the ground, and groped for a\npath; but his hands encountered only fox-holes. All around lay a huge\nsteppe over which no one seemed to have passed. The wanderers made\nseveral efforts to get forward, but the landscape grew wilder and more\ninhospitable.\n\nThe philosopher tried to shout, but his voice was lost in vacancy, no\none answered; only, some moments later, they heard a faint groaning\nsound, like the whimpering of a wolf.\n\n\"Curse it all! What shall we do?\" said the philosopher.\n\n\"Why, just stop here, and spend the night in the open air,\" answered the\ntheologian. So saying, he felt in his pocket, brought out his timber and\nsteel, and lit his pipe.\n\nBut the philosopher could not agree with this proposal; he was not\naccustomed to sleep till he had first eaten five pounds of bread and\nfive of dripping, and so he now felt an intolerable emptiness in his\nstomach. Besides, in spite of his cheerful temperament, he was a little\nafraid of the wolves.\n\n\"No, Khalava,\" he said, \"that won't do. To lie down like a dog and\nwithout any supper! Let us try once more; perhaps we shall find a house,\nand the consolation of having a glass of brandy to drink before going to\nsleep.\"\n\nAt the word \"brandy,\" the theologian spat on one side and said, \"Yes, of\ncourse, we cannot remain all night in the open air.\"\n\nThe students went on and on, and to their great joy they heard the\nbarking of dogs in the distance. After listening a while to see from\nwhich direction the barking came, they went on their way with new\ncourage, and soon espied a light.\n\n\"A village, by heavens, a village!\" exclaimed the philosopher.\n\nHis supposition proved correct; they soon saw two or three houses built\nround a court-yard. Lights glimmered in the windows, and before the\nfence stood a number of trees. The students looked through the crevices\nof the gates and saw a court-yard in which stood a large number of\nroving tradesmen's carts. In the sky there were now fewer clouds, and\nhere and there a star was visible.\n\n\"See, brother!\" one of them said, \"we must now cry 'halt!' Cost what it\nmay, we must find entrance and a night's lodging.\"\n\nThe three students knocked together at the gate, and cried \"Open!\"\n\nThe door of one of the houses creaked on its hinges, and an old woman\nwrapped in a sheepskin appeared. \"Who is there?\" she exclaimed, coughing\nloudly.\n\n\"Let us spend the night here, mother; we have lost our way, our stomachs\nare empty, and we do not want to spend the night out of doors.\"\n\n\"But what sort of people are you?\"\n\n\"Quite harmless people; the theologian Khalava, the philosopher Brutus,\nand the rhetorician Gorobetz.\"\n\n\"It is impossible,\" answered the old woman. \"The whole house is full of\npeople, and every corner occupied. Where can I put you up? You are big\nand heavy enough to break the house down. I know these philosophers and\ntheologians; when once one takes them in, they eat one out of house and\nhome. Go farther on! There is no room here for you!\"\n\n\"Have pity on us, mother! How can you be so heartless? Don't let\nChristians perish. Put us up where you like, and if we eat up your\nprovisions, or do any other damage, may our hands wither up, and all the\npunishment of heaven light on us!\"\n\nThe old woman seemed a little touched. \"Well,\" she said after a few\nmoments' consideration, \"I will let you in; but I must put you in\ndifferent rooms, for I should have no quiet if you were all together at\nnight.\"\n\n\"Do just as you like; we won't say any more about it,\" answered the\nstudents.\n\nThe gates moved heavily on their hinges, and they entered the\ncourt-yard.\n\n\"Well now, mother,\" said the philosopher, following the old woman, \"if\nyou had a little scrap of something! By heavens! my stomach is as empty\nas a drum. I have not had a bit of bread in my mouth since early this\nmorning!\"\n\n\"Didn't I say so?\" replied the old woman. \"There you go begging at once.\nBut I have no food in the house, nor any fire.\"\n\n\"But we will pay for everything,\" continued the philosopher.\n\n\"We will pay early to-morrow in cash.\"\n\n\"Go on and be content with what you get. You are fine fellows whom the\ndevil has brought here!\"\n\nHer reply greatly depressed the philosopher Thomas; but suddenly his\nnose caught the odour of dried fish; he looked at the breeches of the\ntheologian, who walked by his side, and saw a huge fish's tail sticking\nout of his pocket. The latter had already seized the opportunity to\nsteal a whole fish from one of the carts standing in the court-yard. He\nhad not done this from hunger so much as from the force of habit. He had\nquite forgotten the fish, and was looking about to see whether he could\nnot find something else to appropriate. Then the philosopher put his\nhand in the theologian's pocket as though it were his own, and laid hold\nof his prize.\n\nThe old woman found a special resting-place for each student; the\nrhetorician she put in a shed, the theologian in an empty store-room,\nand the philosopher in a sheep's stall.\n\nAs soon as the philosopher was alone, he devoured the fish in a\ntwinkling, examined the fence which enclosed the stall, kicked away a\npig from a neighbouring stall, which had inquiringly inserted its nose\nthrough a crevice, and lay down on his right side to sleep like a\ncorpse.\n\nThen the low door opened, and the old woman came crouching into the\nstall.\n\n\"Well, mother, what do you want here?\" asked the philosopher.\n\nShe made no answer, but came with outstretched arms towards him.\n\nThe philosopher shrank back; but she still approached, as though she\nwished to lay hold of him. A terrible fright seized him, for he saw the\nold hag's eyes sparkle in an extraordinary way. \"Away with you, old\nwitch, away with you!\" he shouted. But she still stretched her hands\nafter him.\n\nHe jumped up in order to rush out, but she placed herself before the\ndoor, fixed her glowing eyes upon him, and again approached him. The\nphilosopher tried to push her away with his hands, but to his\nastonishment he found that he could neither lift his hands nor move his\nlegs, nor utter an audible word. He only heard his heart beating, and\nsaw the old woman approach him, place his hands crosswise on his breast,\nand bend his head down. Then with the agility of a cat she sprang on his\nshoulders, struck him on the side with a broom, and he began to run like\na race-horse, carrying her on his shoulders.\n\nAll this happened with such swiftness, that the philosopher could\nscarcely collect his thoughts. He laid hold of his knees with both hands\nin order to stop his legs from running; but to his great astonishment\nthey kept moving forward against his will, making rapid springs like a\nCaucasian horse.\n\nNot till the house had been left behind them and a wide plain stretched\nbefore them, bordered on one side by a black gloomy wood, did he say to\nhimself, \"Ah! it is a witch!\"\n\nThe half-moon shone pale and high in the sky. Its mild light, still more\nsubdued by intervening clouds, fell like a transparent veil on the\nearth. Woods, meadows, hills, and valleys--all seemed to be sleeping\nwith open eyes; nowhere was a breath of air stirring. The atmosphere was\nmoist and warm; the shadows of the trees and bushes fell sharply defined\non the sloping plain. Such was the night through which the philosopher\nThomas Brutus sped with his strange rider.\n\nA strange, oppressive, and yet sweet sensation took possession of his\nheart. He looked down and saw how the grass beneath his feet seemed to\nbe quite deep and far away; over it there flowed a flood of\ncrystal-clear water, and the grassy plain looked like the bottom of a\ntransparent sea. He saw his own image, and that of the old woman whom he\ncarried on his back, clearly reflected in it. Then he beheld how,\ninstead of the moon, a strange sun shone there; he heard the deep tones\nof bells, and saw them swinging. He saw a water-nixie rise from a bed of\ntall reeds; she turned to him, and her face was clearly visible, and she\nsang a song which penetrated his soul; then she approached him and\nnearly reached the surface of the water, on which she burst into\nlaughter and again disappeared.\n\nDid he see it or did he not see it? Was he dreaming or was he awake? But\nwhat was that below--wind or music? It sounded and drew nearer, and\npenetrated his soul like a song that rose and fell. \"What is it?\" he\nthought as he gazed into the depths, and still sped rapidly along.\n\nThe perspiration flowed from him in streams; he experienced\nsimultaneously a strange feeling of oppression and delight in all his\nbeing. Often he felt as though he had no longer a heart, and pressed his\nhand on his breast with alarm.\n\nWeary to death, he began to repeat all the prayers which he knew, and\nall the formulas of exorcism against evil spirits. Suddenly he\nexperienced a certain relief. He felt that his pace was slackening; the\nwitch weighed less heavily on his shoulders, and the thick herbage of\nthe plain was again beneath his feet, with nothing especial to remark\nabout it.\n\n\"Splendid!\" thought the philosopher Thomas, and began to repeat his\nexorcisms in a still louder voice.\n\nThen suddenly he wrenched himself away from under the witch, and sprang\non her back in his turn. She began to run, with short, trembling steps\nindeed, but so rapidly that he could hardly breathe. So swiftly did she\nrun that she hardly seemed to touch the ground. They were still on the\nplain, but owing to the rapidity of their flight everything seemed\nindistinct and confused before his eyes. He seized a stick that was\nlying on the ground, and began to belabour the hag with all his might.\nShe uttered a wild cry, which at first sounded raging and threatening;\nthen it became gradually weaker and more gentle, till at last it sounded\nquite low like the pleasant tones of a silver bell, so that it\npenetrated his innermost soul. Involuntarily the thought passed through\nhis mind:\n\n\"Is she really an old woman?\"\n\n\"Ah! I can go no farther,\" she said in a faint voice, and sank to the\nearth.\n\nHe knelt beside her, and looked in her eyes. The dawn was red in the\nsky, and in the distance glimmered the gilt domes of the churches of\nKieff. Before him lay a beautiful maiden with thick, dishevelled hair\nand long eyelashes. Unconsciously she had stretched out her white, bare\narms, and her tear-filled eyes gazed at the sky.\n\nThomas trembled like an aspen-leaf. Sympathy, and a strange feeling of\nexcitement, and a hitherto unknown fear overpowered him. He began to run\nwith all his might. His heart beat violently, and he could not explain\nto himself what a strange, new feeling had seized him. He did not wish\nto return to the village, but hastened towards Kieff, thinking all the\nway as he went of his weird, unaccountable adventure.\n\nThere were hardly any students left in the town; they were all scattered\nabout the country, and had either taken tutors' posts or simply lived\nwithout occupation; for at the farms in Little Russia one can live\ncomfortably and at ease without paying a farthing. The great\nhalf-decayed building in which the seminary was established was\ncompletely empty; and however much the philosopher searched in all its\ncorners for a piece of lard and bread, he could not find even one of the\nhard biscuits which the seminarists were in the habit of hiding.\n\nBut the philosopher found a means of extricating himself from his\ndifficulties by making friends with a certain young widow in the\nmarket-place who sold ribbons, etc. The same evening he found himself\nbeing stuffed with cakes and fowl; in fact it is impossible to say how\nmany things were placed before him on a little table in an arbour shaded\nby cherry-trees.\n\nLater on the same evening the philosopher was to be seen in an\nale-house. He lay on a bench, smoked his pipe in his usual way, and\nthrew the Jewish publican a gold piece. He had a jug of ale standing\nbefore him, looked on all who went in and out in a cold-blooded,\nself-satisfied way, and thought no more of his strange adventure.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout this time a report spread about that the daughter of a rich\ncolonel, whose estate lay about fifty versts distant from Kieff, had\nreturned home one day from a walk in a quite broken-down condition. She\nhad scarcely enough strength to reach her father's house; now she lay\ndying, and had expressed a wish that for three days after her death the\nprayers for the dead should be recited by a Kieff seminarist named\nThomas Brutus.\n\nThis fact was communicated to the philosopher by the rector of the\nseminary himself, who sent for him to his room and told him that he must\nstart at once, as a rich colonel had sent his servants and a kibitka for\nhim. The philosopher trembled, and was seized by an uncomfortable\nfeeling which he could not define. He had a gloomy foreboding that some\nevil was about to befall him. Without knowing why, he declared that he\ndid not wish to go.\n\n\"Listen, Thomas,\" said the rector, who under certain circumstances spoke\nvery politely to his pupils; \"I have no idea of asking you whether you\nwish to go or not. I only tell you that if you think of disobeying, I\nwill have you so soundly flogged on the back with young birch-rods, that\nyou need not think of having a bath for a long time.\"\n\nThe philosopher scratched the back of his head, and went out silently,\nintending to make himself scarce at the first opportunity. Lost in\nthought, he descended the steep flight of steps which led to the\ncourt-yard, thickly planted with poplars; there he remained standing for\na moment, and heard quite distinctly the rector giving orders in a loud\nvoice to his steward, and to another person, probably one of the\nmessengers sent by the colonel.\n\n\"Thank your master for the peeled barley and the eggs,\" said the rector;\n\"and tell him that as soon as the books which he mentions in his note\nare ready, I will send them. I have already given them to a clerk to be\ncopied. And don't forget to remind your master that he has some\nexcellent fish, especially prime sturgeon, in his ponds; he might send\nme some when he has the opportunity, as here in the market the fish are\nbad and dear. And you, Jantukh, give the colonel's man a glass of\nbrandy. And mind you tie up the philosopher, or he will show you a clean\npair of heels.\"\n\n\"Listen to the scoundrel!\" thought the philosopher. \"He has smelt a rat,\nthe long-legged stork!\"\n\nHe descended into the court-yard and beheld there a kibitka, which he at\nfirst took for a barn on wheels. It was, in fact, as roomy as a kiln, so\nthat bricks might have been made inside it. It was one of those\nremarkable Cracow vehicles in which Jews travelled from town to town in\nscores, wherever they thought they would find a market. Six stout,\nstrong, though somewhat elderly Cossacks were standing by it. Their\ngold-braided coats of fine cloth showed that their master was rich and\nof some importance; and certain little scars testified to their valour\non the battle-field.\n\n\"What can I do?\" thought the philosopher. \"There is no escaping one's\ndestiny.\" So he stepped up to the Cossacks and said \"Good day,\ncomrades.\"\n\n\"Welcome, Mr Philosopher!\" some of them answered.\n\n\"Well, I am to travel with you! It is a magnificent vehicle,\" he\ncontinued as he got into it. \"If there were only musicians present, one\nmight dance in it.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is a roomy carriage,\" said one of the Cossacks, taking his seat\nby the coachman. The latter had tied a cloth round his head, as he had\nalready found an opportunity of pawning his cap in the ale-house. The\nother five, with the philosopher, got into the capacious kibitka, and\nsat upon sacks which were filled with all sorts of articles purchased in\nthe city.\n\n\"I should like to know,\" said the philosopher, \"if this equipage were\nladen with salt or iron, how many horses would be required to draw it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Cossack who sat by the coachman, after thinking a short\ntime, \"it would require a good many horses.\"\n\nAfter giving this satisfactory answer, the Cossack considered himself\nentitled to remain silent for the whole of the rest of the journey.\n\nThe philosopher would gladly have found out who the colonel was, and\nwhat sort of a character he had. He was also curious to know about his\ndaughter, who had returned home in such a strange way and now lay dying,\nand whose destiny seemed to be mingled with his own; and wanted to know\nthe sort of life that was lived in the colonel's house. But the Cossacks\nwere probably philosophers like himself, for in answer to his inquiries\nthey only blew clouds of tobacco and settled themselves more comfortably\non their sacks.\n\nMeanwhile, one of them addressed to the coachman on the box a brief\ncommand: \"Keep your eyes open, Overko, you old sleepy-head, and when you\ncome to the ale-house on the road to Tchukrailoff, don't forget to pull\nup and wake me and the other fellows if we are asleep.\" Then he began to\nsnore pretty loud. But in any case his admonition was quite superfluous;\nfor scarcely had the enormous equipage begun to approach the aforesaid\nale-house, than they all cried with one mouth \"Halt! Halt!\" Besides\nthis, Overko's horse was accustomed to stop outside every inn of its own\naccord.\n\nIn spite of the intense July heat, they all got out and entered a low,\ndirty room where a Jewish innkeeper received them in a friendly way as\nold acquaintances. He brought in the skirt of his long coat some\nsausages, and laid them on the table, where, though forbidden by the\nTalmud, they looked very seductive. All sat down at table, and it was\nnot long before each of the guests had an earthenware jug standing in\nfront of him. The philosopher Thomas had to take part in the feast, and\nas the Little Russians when they are intoxicated always begin to kiss\neach other or to weep, the whole room soon began to echo with\ndemonstrations of affection.\n\n\"Come here, come here, Spirid, let me embrace thee!\"\n\n\"Come here, Dorosch, let me press you to my heart!\"\n\nOne Cossack, with a grey moustache, the eldest of them all, leant his\nhead on his hand and began to weep bitterly because he was an orphan and\nalone in God's wide world. Another tall, loquacious man did his best to\ncomfort him, saying, \"Don't weep, for God's sake, don't weep! For over\nthere--God knows best.\"\n\nThe Cossack who had been addressed as Dorosch was full of curiosity, and\naddressed many questions to the philosopher Thomas. \"I should like to\nknow,\" he said, \"what you learn in your seminary; do you learn the same\nthings as the deacon reads to us in church, or something else?\"\n\n\"Don't ask,\" said the consoler; \"let them learn what they like. God\nknows what is to happen; God knows everything.\"\n\n\"No, I will know,\" answered Dorosch, \"I will know what is written in\ntheir books; perhaps it is something quite different from that in the\ndeacon's book.\"\n\n\"O good heavens!\" said the other, \"why all this talk? It is God's will,\nand one cannot change God's arrangements.\"\n\n\"But I will know everything that is written; I will enter the seminary\ntoo, by heaven I will! Do you think perhaps I could not learn? I will\nlearn everything, everything.\"\n\n\"Oh, heavens!\" exclaimed the consoler, and let his head sink on the\ntable, for he could no longer hold it upright.\n\nThe other Cossacks talked about the nobility, and why there was a moon\nin the sky.\n\nWhen the philosopher Thomas saw the state they were in, he determined to\nprofit by it, and to make his escape. In the first place he turned to\nthe grey-headed Cossack, who was lamenting the loss of his parents.\n\"But, little uncle,\" he said to him, \"why do you weep so? I too am an\norphan! Let me go, children; why do you want me?\"\n\n\"Let him go!\" said some of them, \"he is an orphan, let him go where he\nlikes.\"\n\nThey were about to take him outside themselves, when the one who had\ndisplayed a special thirst for knowledge, stopped them, saying, \"No, I\nwant to talk with him about the seminary; I am going to the seminary\nmyself.\"\n\nMoreover, it was not yet certain whether the philosopher could have\nexecuted his project of flight, for when he tried to rise from his\nchair, he felt as though his feet were made of wood, and he began to see\nsuch a number of doors leading out of the room that it would have been\ndifficult for him to have found the right one.\n\nIt was not till evening that the company remembered that they must\ncontinue their journey. They crowded into the kibitka, whipped up the\nhorses, and struck up a song, the words and sense of which were hard to\nunderstand. During a great part of the night, they wandered about,\nhaving lost the road which they ought to have been able to find\nblindfolded. At last they drove down a steep descent into a valley, and\nthe philosopher noticed, by the sides of the road, hedges, behind which\nhe caught glimpses of small trees and house-roofs. All these belonged to\nthe colonel's estate.\n\nIt was already long past midnight. The sky was dark, though little stars\nglimmered here and there; no light was to be seen in any of the houses.\nThey drove into a large court-yard, while the dogs barked. On all sides\nwere barns and cottages with thatched roofs. Just opposite the gateway\nwas a house, which was larger than the others, and seemed to be the\ncolonel's dwelling. The kibitka stopped before a small barn, and the\ntravellers hastened into it and laid themselves down to sleep. The\nphilosopher however attempted to look at the exterior of the house, but,\nrub his eyes as he might, he could distinguish nothing; the house seemed\nto turn into a bear, and the chimney into the rector of the seminary.\nThen he gave it up and lay down to sleep.\n\nWhen he woke up the next morning, the whole house was in commotion; the\nyoung lady had died during the night. The servants ran hither and\nthither in a distracted state; the old women wept and lamented; and a\nnumber of curious people gazed through the enclosure into the\ncourt-yard, as though there were something special to be seen. The\nphilosopher began now to inspect the locality and the buildings, which\nhe had not been able to do during the night.\n\nThe colonel's house was one of those low, small buildings, such as used\nformerly to be constructed in Russia. It was thatched with straw; a\nsmall, high-peaked gable, with a window shaped like an eye, was painted\nall over with blue and yellow flowers and red crescent-moons; it rested\non little oaken pillars, which were round above the middle, hexagonal\nbelow, and whose capitals were adorned with quaint carvings. Under this\ngable was a small staircase with seats at the foot of it on either side.\n\nThe walls of the house were supported by similar pillars. Before the\nhouse stood a large pear-tree of pyramidal shape, whose leaves\nincessantly trembled. A double row of buildings formed a broad street\nleading up to the colonel's house. Behind the barns near the\nentrance-gate stood two three-cornered wine-houses, also thatched with\nstraw; each of the stone walls had a door in it, and was covered with\nall kinds of paintings. On one was represented a Cossack sitting on a\nbarrel and swinging a large pitcher over his head; it bore the\ninscription \"I will drink all that!\" Elsewhere were painted large and\nsmall bottles, a beautiful girl, a running horse, a pipe, and a drum\nbearing the words \"Wine is the Cossack's joy.\"\n\nIn the loft of one of the barns one saw through a huge round window a\ndrum and some trumpets. At the gate there stood two cannons. All this\nshowed that the colonel loved a cheerful life, and the whole place often\nrang with sounds of merriment. Before the gate were two windmills, and\nbehind the house gardens sloped away; through the tree-tops the dark\nchimneys of the peasants' houses were visible. The whole village lay on\na broad, even plateau, in the middle of a mountain-slope which\nculminated in a steep summit on the north side. When seen from below, it\nlooked still steeper. Here and there on the top the irregular stems of\nthe thick steppe-brooms showed in dark relief against the blue sky. The\nbare clay soil made a melancholy impression, worn as it was into deep\nfurrows by rain-water. On the same slope there stood two cottages, and\nover one of them a huge apple-tree spread its branches; the roots were\nsupported by small props, whose interstices were filled with mould. The\napples, which were blown off by the wind, rolled down to the court-yard\nbelow. A road wound round the mountain to the village.\n\nWhen the philosopher looked at this steep slope, and remembered his\njourney of the night before, he came to the conclusion that either the\ncolonel's horses were very sagacious, or that the Cossacks must have\nvery strong heads, as they ventured, even when the worse for drink, on\nsuch a road with the huge kibitka.\n\nWhen the philosopher turned and looked in the opposite direction, he saw\nquite another picture. The village reached down to the plain; meadows\nstretched away to an immense distance, their bright green growing\ngradually dark; far away, about twenty versts off, many other villages\nwere visible. To the right of these meadows were chains of hills, and in\nthe remote distance one saw the Dnieper shimmer and sparkle like a\nmirror of steel.\n\n\"What a splendid country!\" said the philosopher to himself. \"It must be\nfine to live here! One could catch fish in the Dnieper, and in the\nponds, and shoot and snare partridges and bustards; there must be\nquantities here. Much fruit might be dried here and sold in the town,\nor, better still, brandy might be distilled from it, for fruit-brandy is\nthe best of all. But what prevents me thinking of my escape after all?\"\n\nBehind the hedge he saw a little path which was almost entirely\nconcealed by the high grass of the steppe. The philosopher approached it\nmechanically, meaning at first to walk a little along it unobserved, and\nthen quite quietly to gain the open country behind the peasants' houses.\nSuddenly he felt the pressure of a fairly heavy hand on his shoulder.\n\nBehind him stood the same old Cossack who yesterday had so bitterly\nlamented the death of his father and mother, and his own loneliness.\n\"You are giving yourself useless trouble, Mr Philosopher, if you think\nyou can escape from us,\" he said. \"One cannot run away here; and\nbesides, the roads are too bad for walkers. Come to the colonel; he has\nbeen waiting for you for some time in his room.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course! What are you talking about? I will come with the\ngreatest pleasure,\" said the philosopher, and followed the Cossack.\n\nThe colonel was an elderly man; his moustache was grey, and his face\nwore the signs of deep sadness. He sat in his room by a table, with his\nhead propped on both hands. He seemed about five-and-fifty, but his\nattitude of utter despair, and the pallor on his face, showed that his\nheart had been suddenly broken, and that all his former cheerfulness had\nfor ever disappeared.\n\nWhen Thomas entered with the Cossack, he answered their deep bows with a\nslight inclination of the head.\n\n\"Who are you, whence do you come, and what is your profession, my good\nman?\" asked the colonel in an even voice, neither friendly nor austere.\n\n\"I am a student of philosophy; my name is Thomas Brutus.\"\n\n\"And who was your father?\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir.\"\n\n\"And your mother?\"\n\n\"I don't know either; I know that I must have had a mother, but who she\nwas, and where she lived, by heavens, I do not know.\"\n\nThe colonel was silent, and seemed for a moment lost in thought. \"Where\ndid you come to know my daughter?\"\n\n\"I do not know her, gracious sir; I declare I do not know her.\"\n\n\"Why then has she chosen you, and no one else, to offer up prayers for\nher?\"\n\nThe philosopher shrugged his shoulders. \"God only knows. It is a\nwell-known fact that grand people often demand things which the most\nlearned man cannot comprehend; and does not the proverb say, 'Dance,\ndevil, as the Lord commands!'\"\n\n\"Aren't you talking nonsense, Mr Philosopher?\"\n\n\"May the lightning strike me on the spot if I lie.\"\n\n\"If she had only lived a moment longer,\" said the colonel sadly, \"then I\nhad certainly found out everything. She said, 'Let no one offer up\nprayers for me, but send, father, at once to the seminary in Kieff for\nthe student Thomas Brutus; he shall pray three nights running for my\nsinful soul--he knows.' But what he really knows she never said. The\npoor dove could speak no more, and died. Good man, you are probably well\nknown for your sanctity and devout life, and she has perhaps heard of\nyou.\"\n\n\"What? Of me?\" said the philosopher, and took a step backward in\namazement. \"I and sanctity!\" he exclaimed, and stared at the colonel.\n\"God help us, gracious sir! What are you saying? It was only last Holy\nThursday that I paid a visit to the tart-shop.\"\n\n\"Well, she must at any rate have had some reason for making the\narrangement, and you must begin your duties to-day.\"\n\n\"I should like to remark to your honour--naturally everyone who knows\nthe Holy Scripture at all can in his measure--but I believe it would be\nbetter on this occasion to send for a deacon or subdeacon. They are\nlearned people, and they know exactly what is to be done. I have not got\na good voice, nor any official standing.\"\n\n\"You may say what you like, but I shall carry out all my dove's wishes.\nIf you read the prayers for her three nights through in the proper way,\nI will reward you; and if not--I advise the devil himself not to oppose\nme!\"\n\nThe colonel spoke the last words in such an emphatic way that the\nphilosopher quite understood them.\n\n\"Follow me!\" said the colonel.\n\nThey went into the hall. The colonel opened a door which was opposite\nhis own. The philosopher remained for a few minutes in the hall in order\nto look about him; then he stepped over the threshold with a certain\nnervousness.\n\nThe whole floor of the room was covered with red cloth. In a corner\nunder the icons of the saints, on a table covered with a gold-bordered,\nvelvet cloth, lay the body of the girl. Tall candles, round which were\nwound branches of the \"calina,\" stood at her head and feet, and burned\ndimly in the broad daylight. The face of the dead was not to be seen, as\nthe inconsolable father sat before his daughter, with his back turned to\nthe philosopher. The words which the latter overheard filled him with a\ncertain fear:\n\n\"I do not mourn, my daughter, that in the flower of your age you have\nprematurely left the earth, to my grief; but I mourn, my dove, that I do\nnot know my deadly enemy who caused your death. Had I only known that\nanyone could even conceive the idea of insulting you, or of speaking a\ndisrespectful word to you, I swear by heaven he would never have seen\nhis children again, if he had been as old as myself; nor his father and\nmother, if he had been young. And I would have thrown his corpse to the\nbirds of the air, and the wild beasts of the steppe. But woe is me, my\nflower, my dove, my light! I will spend the remainder of my life without\njoy, and wipe the bitter tears which flow out of my old eyes, while my\nenemy will rejoice and laugh in secret over the helpless old man!\"\n\nHe paused, overpowered by grief, and streams of tears flowed down his\ncheeks.\n\nThe philosopher was deeply affected by the sight of such inconsolable\nsorrow. He coughed gently in order to clear his throat. The colonel\nturned and signed to him to take his place at the head of the dead girl,\nbefore a little prayer-desk on which some books lay.\n\n\"I can manage to hold out for three nights,\" thought the philosopher;\n\"and then the colonel will fill both my pockets with ducats.\"\n\nHe approached the dead girl, and after coughing once more, began to\nread, without paying attention to anything else, and firmly resolved not\nto look at her face.\n\nSoon there was deep silence, and he saw that the colonel had left the\nroom. Slowly he turned his head in order to look at the corpse. A\nviolent shudder thrilled through him; before him lay a form of such\nbeauty as is seldom seen upon earth. It seemed to him that never in a\nsingle face had so much intensity of expression and harmony of feature\nbeen united. Her brow, soft as snow and pure as silver, seemed to be\nthinking; the fine, regular eyebrows shadowed proudly the closed eyes,\nwhose lashes gently rested on her cheeks, which seemed to glow with\nsecret longing; her lips still appeared to smile. But at the same time\nhe saw something in these features which appalled him; a terrible\ndepression seized his heart, as when in the midst of dance and song\nsomeone begins to chant a dirge. He felt as though those ruby lips were\ncoloured with his own heart's blood. Moreover, her face seemed\ndreadfully familiar.\n\n\"The witch!\" he cried out in a voice which sounded strange to himself;\nthen he turned away and began to read the prayers with white cheeks. It\nwas the witch whom he had killed.\n\n\nII\n\nWhen the sun had sunk below the horizon, the corpse was carried into the\nchurch. The philosopher supported one corner of the black-draped coffin\nupon his shoulder, and felt an ice-cold shiver run through his body. The\ncolonel walked in front of him, with his right hand resting on the edge\nof the coffin.\n\nThe wooden church, black with age and overgrown with green lichen, stood\nquite at the end of the village in gloomy solitude; it was adorned with\nthree round cupolas. One saw at the first glance that it had not been\nused for divine worship for a long time.\n\nLighted candles were standing before almost every icon. The coffin was\nset down before the altar. The old colonel kissed his dead daughter once\nmore, and then left the church, together with the bearers of the bier,\nafter he had ordered his servants to look after the philosopher and to\ntake him back to the church after supper.\n\nThe coffin-bearers, when they returned to the house, all laid their\nhands on the stove. This custom is always observed in Little Russia by\nthose who have seen a corpse.\n\nThe hunger which the philosopher now began to feel caused him for a\nwhile to forget the dead girl altogether. Gradually all the domestics of\nthe house assembled in the kitchen; it was really a kind of club, where\nthey were accustomed to gather. Even the dogs came to the door, wagging\ntheir tails in order to have bones and offal thrown to them.\n\nIf a servant was sent on an errand, he always found his way into the\nkitchen to rest there for a while, and to smoke a pipe. All the Cossacks\nof the establishment lay here during the whole day on and under the\nbenches--in fact, wherever a place could be found to lie down in.\nMoreover, everyone was always leaving something behind in the\nkitchen--his cap, or his whip, or something of the sort. But the numbers\nof the club were not complete till the evening, when the groom came in\nafter tying up his horses in the stable, the cowherd had shut up his\ncows in their stalls, and others collected there who were not usually\nseen in the day-time. During supper-time even the tongues of the laziest\nwere set in motion. They talked of all and everything--of the new pair\nof breeches which someone had ordered for himself, of what might be in\nthe centre of the earth, and of the wolf which someone had seen. There\nwere a number of wits in the company--a class which is always\nrepresented in Little Russia.\n\nThe philosopher took his place with the rest in the great circle which\nsat round the kitchen door in the open-air. Soon an old woman with a red\ncap issued from it, bearing with both hands a large vessel full of hot\n\"galuchkis,\" which she distributed among them. Each drew out of his\npocket a wooden spoon, or a one-pronged wooden fork. As soon as their\njaws began to move a little more slowly, and their wolfish hunger was\nsomewhat appeased, they began to talk. The conversation, as might be\nexpected, turned on the dead girl.\n\n\"Is it true,\" said a young shepherd, \"is it true--though I cannot\nunderstand it--that our young mistress had traffic with evil spirits?\"\n\n\"Who, the young lady?\" answered Dorosch, whose acquaintance the\nphilosopher had already made in the kibitka. \"Yes, she was a regular\nwitch! I can swear that she was a witch!\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Dorosch!\" exclaimed another--the one who, during the\njourney, had played the part of a consoler. \"We have nothing to do with\nthat. May God be merciful to her! One ought not to talk of such things.\"\n\nBut Dorosch was not at all inclined to be silent; he had just visited\nthe wine-cellar with the steward on important business, and having\nstooped two or three times over one or two casks, he had returned in a\nvery cheerful and loquacious mood.\n\n\"Why do you ask me to be silent?\" he answered. \"She has ridden on my own\nshoulders, I swear she has.\"\n\n\"Say, uncle,\" asked the young shepherd, \"are there signs by which to\nrecognise a sorceress?\"\n\n\"No, there are not,\" answered Dorosch; \"even if you knew the Psalter by\nheart, you could not recognise one.\"\n\n\"Yes, Dorosch, it is possible; don't talk such nonsense,\" retorted the\nformer consoler. \"It is not for nothing that God has given each some\nspecial peculiarity; the learned maintain that every witch has a little\ntail.\"\n\n\"Every old woman is a witch,\" said a grey-headed Cossack quite\nseriously.\n\n\"Yes, you are a fine lot,\" retorted the old woman who entered at that\nmoment with a vessel full of fresh \"galuchkis.\" \"You are great fat\npigs!\"\n\nA self-satisfied smile played round the lips of the old Cossack whose\nname was Javtuch, when he found that his remark had touched the old\nwoman on a tender point. The shepherd burst into such a deep and loud\nexplosion of laughter as if two oxen were lowing together.\n\nThis conversation excited in the philosopher a great curiosity, and a\nwish to obtain more exact information regarding the colonel's daughter.\nIn order to lead the talk back to the subject, he turned to his next\nneighbour and said, \"I should like to know why all the people here think\nthat the young lady was a witch. Has she done harm to anyone, or killed\nthem by witchcraft?\"\n\n\"Yes, there are reports of that kind,\" answered a man, whose face was as\nflat as a shovel. \"Who does not remember the huntsman Mikita, or\nthe----\"\n\n\"What has the huntsman Mikita got to do with it?\" asked the philosopher.\n\n\"Stop; I will tell you the story of Mikita,\" interrupted Dorosch.\n\n\"No, I will tell it,\" said the groom, \"for he was my godfather.\"\n\n\"I will tell the story of Mikita,\" said Spirid.\n\n\"Yes, yes, Spirid shall tell it,\" exclaimed the whole company; and\nSpirid began.\n\n\"You, Mr Philosopher Thomas, did not know Mikita. Ah! he was an\nextraordinary man. He knew every dog as though he were his own father.\nThe present huntsman, Mikola, who sits three places away from me, is not\nfit to hold a candle to him, though good enough in his way; but compared\nto Mikita, he is a mere milksop.\"\n\n\"You tell the tale splendidly,\" exclaimed Dorosch, and nodded as a sign\nof approval.\n\nSpirid continued.\n\n\"He saw a hare in the field quicker than you can take a pinch of snuff.\nHe only needed to whistle 'Come here, Rasboy! Come here, Bosdraja!' and\nflew away on his horse like the wind, so that you could not say whether\nhe went quicker than the dog or the dog than he. He could empty a quart\npot of brandy in the twinkling of an eye. Ah! he was a splendid\nhuntsman, only for some time he always had his eyes fixed on the young\nlady. Either he had fallen in love with her or she had bewitched him--in\nshort, he went to the dogs. He became a regular old woman; yes, he\nbecame the devil knows what--it is not fitting to relate it.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" remarked Dorosch.\n\n\"If the young lady only looked at him, he let the reins slip out of his\nhands, called Bravko instead of Rasboy, stumbled, and made all kinds of\nmistakes. One day when he was currycombing a horse, the young lady came\nto him in the stable. 'Listen, Mikita,' she said. 'I should like for\nonce to set my foot on you.' And he, the booby, was quite delighted, and\nanswered, 'Don't only set your foot there, but sit on me altogether.'\nThe young lady lifted her white little foot, and as soon as he saw it,\nhis delight robbed him of his senses. He bowed his neck, the idiot, took\nher feet in both hands, and began to trot about like a horse all over\nthe place. Whither they went he could not say; he returned more dead\nthan alive, and from that time he wasted away and became as dry as a\nchip of wood. At last someone coming into the stable one day found\ninstead of him only a handful of ashes and an empty jug; he had burned\ncompletely out. But it must be said he was a huntsman such as the world\ncannot match.\"\n\nWhen Spirid had ended his tale, they all began to vie with one another\nin praising the deceased huntsman.\n\n\"And have you heard the story of Cheptchicha?\" asked Dorosch, turning to\nThomas.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Ha! Ha! One sees they don't teach you much in your seminary. Well,\nlisten. We have here in our village a Cossack called Cheptoun, a fine\nfellow. Sometimes indeed he amuses himself by stealing and lying without\nany reason; but he is a fine fellow for all that. His house is not far\naway from here. One evening, just about this time, Cheptoun and his wife\nwent to bed after they had finished their day's work. Since it was fine\nweather, Cheptchicha went to sleep in the court-yard, and Cheptoun in\nthe house--no! I mean Cheptchicha went to sleep in the house on a bench\nand Cheptoun outside----\"\n\n\"No, Cheptchicha didn't go to sleep on a bench, but on the ground,\"\ninterrupted the old woman who stood at the door.\n\nDorosch looked at her, then at the ground, then again at her, and said\nafter a pause, \"If I tore your dress off your back before all these\npeople, it wouldn't look pretty.\"\n\nThe rebuke was effectual. The old woman was silent, and did not\ninterrupt again.\n\nDorosch continued.\n\n\"In the cradle which hung in the middle of the room lay a one-year-old\nchild. I do not know whether it was a boy or a girl. Cheptchicha had\nlain down, and heard on the other side of the door a dog scratching and\nhowling loud enough to frighten anyone. She was afraid, for women are\nsuch simple folk that if one puts out one's tongue at them behind the\ndoor in the dark, their hearts sink into their boots. 'But,' she thought\nto herself, 'I must give this cursed dog one on the snout to stop his\nhowling!' So she seized the poker and opened the door. But hardly had\nshe done so than the dog rushed between her legs straight to the cradle.\nThen Cheptchicha saw that it was not a dog but the young lady; and if it\nhad only been the young lady as she knew her it wouldn't have mattered,\nbut she looked quite blue, and her eyes sparkled like fiery coals. She\nseized the child, bit its throat, and began to suck its blood.\nCheptchicha shrieked, 'Ah! my darling child!' and rushed out of the\nroom. Then she saw that the house-door was shut and rushed up to the\nattic and sat there, the stupid woman, trembling all over. Then the\nyoung lady came after her and bit her too, poor fool! The next morning\nCheptoun carried his wife, all bitten and wounded, down from the attic,\nand the next day she died. Such strange things happen in the world. One\nmay wear fine clothes, but that does not matter; a witch is and remains\na witch.\"\n\nAfter telling his story, Dorosch looked around him with a complacent\nair, and cleaned out his pipe with his little finger in order to fill it\nagain. The story of the witch had made a deep impression on all, and\neach of them had something to say about her. One had seen her come to\nthe door of his house in the form of a hayrick; from others she had\nstolen their caps or their pipes; she had cut off the hair-plaits of\nmany girls in the village, and drunk whole pints of the blood of others.\n\nAt last the whole company observed that they had gossiped over their\ntime, for it was already night. All looked for a sleeping place--some in\nthe kitchen and others in the barn or the court-yard.\n\n\"Now, Mr Thomas, it is time that we go to the dead,\" said the\ngrey-headed Cossack, turning to the philosopher. All four--Spirid,\nDorosch, the old Cossack, and the philosopher--betook themselves to the\nchurch, keeping off with their whips the wild dogs who roamed about the\nroads in great numbers and bit the sticks of passers-by in sheer malice.\n\nAlthough the philosopher had seized the opportunity of fortifying\nhimself beforehand with a stiff glass of brandy, yet he felt a certain\nsecret fear which increased as he approached the church, which was lit\nup within. The strange tales he had heard had made a deep impression on\nhis imagination. They had passed the thick hedges and trees, and the\ncountry became more open. At last they reached the small enclosure round\nthe church; behind it there were no more trees, but a huge, empty plain\ndimly visible in the darkness. The three Cossacks ascended the steep\nsteps with Thomas, and entered the church. Here they left the\nphilosopher, expressing their hope that he would successfully accomplish\nhis duties, and locked him in as their master had ordered.\n\nHe was left alone. At first he yawned, then he stretched himself, blew\non both hands, and finally looked round him. In the middle of the church\nstood the black bier; before the dark pictures of saints burned the\ncandles, whose light only illuminated the icons, and cast a faint\nglimmer into the body of the church; all the corners were in complete\ndarkness. The lofty icons seemed to be of considerable age; only a\nlittle of the original gilt remained on their broken traceries; the\nfaces of the saints had become quite black and looked uncanny.\n\nOnce more the philosopher cast a glance around him. \"Bother it!\" said he\nto himself. \"What is there to be afraid about? No living creature can\nget in, and as for the dead and those who come from the 'other side,' I\ncan protect myself with such effectual prayers that they cannot touch me\nwith the tips of their fingers. There is nothing to fear,\" he repeated,\nswinging his arms. \"Let us begin the prayers!\"\n\nAs he approached one of the side-aisles, he noticed two packets of\ncandles which had been placed there.\n\n\"That is fine,\" he thought. \"I must illuminate the whole church, till it\nis as bright as day. What a pity that one cannot smoke in it.\"\n\nHe began to light the candles on all the wall-brackets and all the\ncandelabra, as well as those already burning before the holy pictures;\nsoon the whole church was brilliantly lit up. Only the darkness in the\nroof above seemed still denser by contrast, and the faces of the saints\npeering out of the frames looked as unearthly as before. He approached\nthe bier, looked nervously at the face of the dead girl, could not help\nshuddering slightly, and involuntarily closed his eyes. What terrible\nand extraordinary beauty!\n\nHe turned away and tried to go to one side, but the strange curiosity\nand peculiar fascination which men feel in moments of fear, compelled\nhim to look again and again, though with a similar shudder. And in truth\nthere was something terrible about the beauty of the dead girl. Perhaps\nshe would not have inspired so much fear had she been less beautiful;\nbut there was nothing ghastly or deathlike in the face, which wore\nrather an expression of life, and it seemed to the philosopher as though\nshe were watching him from under her closed eyelids. He even thought he\nsaw a tear roll from under the eyelash of her right eye, but when it was\nhalf-way down her cheek, he saw that it was a drop of blood.\n\nHe quickly went into one of the stalls, opened his book, and began to\nread the prayers in a very loud voice in order to keep up his courage.\nHis deep voice sounded strange to himself in the grave-like silence; it\naroused no echo in the silent and desolate wooden walls of the church.\n\n\"What is there to be afraid of?\" he thought to himself. \"She will not\nrise from her bier, since she fears God's word. She will remain quietly\nresting. Yes, and what sort of a Cossack should I be, if I were afraid?\nThe fact is, I have drunk a little too much--that is why I feel so\nqueer. Let me take a pinch of snuff. It is really excellent--first-rate!\"\n\nAt the same time he cast a furtive glance over the pages of the\nprayer-book towards the bier, and involuntarily he said to himself,\n\"There! See! She is getting up! Her head is already above the edge of\nthe coffin!\"\n\nBut a death-like silence prevailed; the coffin was motionless, and all\nthe candles shone steadily. It was an awe-inspiring sight, this church\nlit up at midnight, with the corpse in the midst, and no living soul\nnear but one. The philosopher began to sing in various keys in order to\nstifle his fears, but every moment he glanced across at the coffin, and\ninvoluntarily the question came to his lips, \"Suppose she rose up after\nall?\"\n\nBut the coffin did not move. Nowhere was there the slightest sound nor\nstir. Not even did a cricket chirp in any corner. There was nothing\naudible but the slight sputtering of some distant candle, or the faint\nfall of a drop of wax.\n\n\"Suppose she rose up after all?\"\n\nHe raised his head. Then he looked round him wildly and rubbed his eyes.\nYes, she was no longer lying in the coffin, but sitting upright. He\nturned away his eyes, but at once looked again, terrified, at the\ncoffin. She stood up; then she walked with closed eyes through the\nchurch, stretching out her arms as though she wanted to seize someone.\n\nShe now came straight towards him. Full of alarm, he traced with his\nfinger a circle round himself; then in a loud voice he began to recite\nthe prayers and formulas of exorcism which he had learnt from a monk who\nhad often seen witches and evil spirits.\n\nShe had almost reached the edge of the circle which he had traced; but\nit was evident that she had not the power to enter it. Her face wore a\nbluish tint like that of one who has been several days dead.\n\nThomas had not the courage to look at her, so terrible was her\nappearance; her teeth chattered and she opened her dead eyes, but as in\nher rage she saw nothing, she turned in another direction and felt with\noutstretched arms among the pillars and corners of the church in the\nhope of seizing him.\n\nAt last she stood still, made a threatening gesture, and then lay down\nagain in the coffin.\n\nThe philosopher could not recover his self-possession, and kept on\ngazing anxiously at it. Suddenly it rose from its place and began\nhurtling about the church with a whizzing sound. At one time it was\nalmost directly over his head; but the philosopher observed that it\ncould not pass over the area of his charmed circle, so he kept on\nrepeating his formulas of exorcism. The coffin now fell with a crash in\nthe middle of the church, and remained lying there motionless. The\ncorpse rose again; it had now a greenish-blue colour, but at the same\nmoment the distant crowing of a cock was audible, and it lay down again.\n\nThe philosopher's heart beat violently, and the perspiration poured in\nstreams from his face; but heartened by the crowing of the cock, he\nrapidly repeated the prayers.\n\nAs the first light of dawn looked through the windows, there came a\ndeacon and the grey-haired Javtuk, who acted as sacristan, in order to\nrelease him. When he had reached the house, he could not sleep for a\nlong time; but at last weariness overpowered him, and he slept till\nnoon. When he awoke, his experiences of the night appeared to him like a\ndream. He was given a quart of brandy to strengthen him.\n\nAt table he was again talkative and ate a fairly large sucking pig\nalmost without assistance. But none the less he resolved to say nothing\nof what he had seen, and to all curious questions only returned the\nanswer, \"Yes, some wonderful things happened.\"\n\nThe philosopher was one of those men who, when they have had a good\nmeal, are uncommonly amiable. He lay down on a bench, with his pipe in\nhis mouth, looked blandly at all, and expectorated every minute.\n\nBut as the evening approached, he became more and more pensive. About\nsupper-time nearly the whole company had assembled in order to play\n\"krapli.\" This is a kind of game of skittles, in which, instead of\nbowls, long staves are used, and the winner has the right to ride on the\nback of his opponent. It provided the spectators with much amusement;\nsometimes the groom, a huge man, would clamber on the back of the\nswineherd, who was slim and short and shrunken; another time the groom\nwould present his own back, while Dorosch sprang on it shouting, \"What a\nregular ox!\" Those of the company who were more staid sat by the\nthreshold of the kitchen. They looked uncommonly serious, smoked their\npipes, and did not even smile when the younger ones went into fits of\nlaughter over some joke of the groom or Spirid.\n\nThomas vainly attempted to take part in the game; a gloomy thought was\nfirmly fixed like a nail in his head. In spite of his desperate efforts\nto appear cheerful after supper, fear had overmastered his whole being,\nand it increased with the growing darkness.\n\n\"Now it is time for us to go, Mr Student!\" said the grey-haired Cossack,\nand stood up with Dorosch. \"Let us betake ourselves to our work.\"\n\nThomas was conducted to the church in the same way as on the previous\nevening; again he was left alone, and the door was bolted behind him.\n\nAs soon as he found himself alone, he began to feel in the grip of his\nfears. He again saw the dark pictures of the saints in their gilt\nframes, and the black coffin, which stood menacing and silent in the\nmiddle of the church.\n\n\"Never mind!\" he said to himself. \"I am over the first shock. The first\ntime I was frightened, but I am not so at all now--no, not at all!\"\n\nHe quickly went into a stall, drew a circle round him with his finger,\nuttered some prayers and formulas for exorcism, and then began to read\nthe prayers for the dead in a loud voice and with the fixed resolution\nnot to look up from the book nor take notice of anything.\n\nHe did so for an hour, and began to grow a little tired; he cleared his\nthroat and drew his snuff-box out of his pocket, but before he had taken\na pinch he looked nervously towards the coffin.\n\nA sudden chill shot through him. The witch was already standing before\nhim on the edge of the circle, and had fastened her green eyes upon him.\nHe shuddered, looked down at the book, and began to read his prayers and\nexorcisms aloud. Yet all the while he was aware how her teeth chattered,\nand how she stretched out her arms to seize him. But when he cast a\nhasty glance towards her, he saw that she was not looking in his\ndirection, and it was clear that she could not see him.\n\nThen she began to murmur in an undertone, and terrible words escaped her\nlips--words that sounded like the bubbling of boiling pitch. The\nphilosopher did not know their meaning, but he knew that they signified\nsomething terrible, and were intended to counteract his exorcisms.\n\nAfter she had spoken, a stormy wind arose in the church, and there was a\nnoise like the rushing of many birds. He heard the noise of their wings\nand claws as they flapped against and scratched at the iron bars of the\nchurch windows. There were also violent blows on the church door, as if\nsomeone were trying to break it in pieces.\n\nThe philosopher's heart beat violently; he did not dare to look up, but\ncontinued to read the prayers without a pause. At last there was heard\nin the distance the shrill sound of a cock's crow. The exhausted\nphilosopher stopped and gave a great sigh of relief.\n\nThose who came to release him found him more dead than alive; he had\nleant his back against the wall, and stood motionless, regarding them\nwithout any expression in his eyes. They were obliged almost to carry\nhim to the house; he then shook himself, asked for and drank a quart of\nbrandy. He passed his hand through his hair and said, \"There are all\nsorts of horrors in the world, and such dreadful things happen that----\"\nHere he made a gesture as though to ward off something. All who heard\nhim bent their heads forward in curiosity. Even a small boy, who ran on\neveryone's errands, stood by with his mouth wide open.\n\nJust then a young woman in a close-fitting dress passed by. She was the\nold cook's assistant, and very coquettish; she always stuck something in\nher bodice by way of ornament, a ribbon or a flower, or even a piece of\npaper if she could find nothing else.\n\n\"Good day, Thomas,\" she said, as she saw the philosopher. \"Dear me! what\nhas happened to you?\" she exclaimed, striking her hands together.\n\n\"Well, what is it, you silly creature?\"\n\n\"Good heavens! You have grown quite grey!\"\n\n\"Yes, so he has!\" said Spirid, regarding him more closely. \"You have\ngrown as grey as our old Javtuk.\"\n\nWhen the philosopher heard that, he hastened into the kitchen, where he\nhad noticed on the wall a dirty, three-cornered piece of looking-glass.\nIn front of it hung some forget-me-nots, evergreens, and a small\ngarland--a proof that it was the toilette-glass of the young coquette.\nWith alarm he saw that it actually was as they had said--his hair was\nquite grizzled.\n\nHe sank into a reverie; at last he said to himself, \"I will go to the\ncolonel, tell him all, and declare that I will read no more prayers. He\nmust send me back at once to Kieff.\" With this intention he turned\ntowards the door-steps of the colonel's house.\n\nThe colonel was sitting motionless in his room; his face displayed the\nsame hopeless grief which Thomas had observed on it on his first\narrival, only the hollows in his cheeks had deepened. It was obvious\nthat he took very little or no food. A strange paleness made him look\nalmost as though made of marble.\n\n\"Good day,\" he said as he observed Thomas standing, cap in hand, at the\ndoor. \"Well, how are you getting on? All right?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, all right! Such hellish things are going on, that one would\nlike to rush away as far as one's feet can carry one.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Your daughter, sir.... When one considers the matter, she is, of\ncourse, of noble descent--no one can dispute that; but don't be angry,\nand may God grant her eternal rest!\"\n\n\"Very well! What about her?\"\n\n\"She is in league with the devil. She inspires one with such dread that\nall prayers are useless.\"\n\n\"Pray! Pray! It was not for nothing that she sent for you. My dove was\ntroubled about her salvation, and wished to expel all evil influences by\nmeans of prayer.\"\n\n\"I swear, gracious sir, it is beyond my power.\"\n\n\"Pray! Pray!\" continued the colonel in the same persuasive tone. \"There\nis only one night more; you are doing a Christian work, and I will\nreward you richly.\"\n\n\"However great your rewards may be, I will not read the prayers any\nmore, sir,\" said Thomas in a tone of decision.\n\n\"Listen, philosopher!\" said the colonel with a menacing air. \"I will not\nallow any objections. In your seminary you may act as you like, but here\nit won't do. If I have you knouted, it will be somewhat different to the\nrector's canings. Do you know what a strong 'kantchuk'(2) is?\"\n\n  (2) Small scourge.\n\n\"Of course I do,\" said the philosopher in a low voice; \"a number of them\ntogether are insupportable.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so too. But you don't know yet how hot my fellows can make\nit,\" replied the colonel threateningly. He sprang up, and his face\nassumed a fierce, despotic expression, betraying the savagery of his\nnature, which had been only temporarily modified by grief. \"After the\nfirst flogging they pour on brandy and then repeat it. Go away and\nfinish your work. If you don't obey, you won't be able to stand again,\nand if you do, you will get a thousand ducats.\"\n\n\"That is a devil of a fellow,\" thought the philosopher to himself, and\nwent out. \"One can't trifle with him. But wait a little, my friend; I\nwill escape you so cleverly, that even your hounds can't find me!\"\n\nHe determined, under any circumstances, to run away, and only waited\ntill the hour after dinner arrived, when all the servants were\naccustomed to take a nap on the hay in the barn, and to snore and puff\nso loudly that it sounded as if machinery had been set up there. At last\nthe time came. Even Javtuch stretched himself out in the sun and closed\nhis eyes. Tremblingly, and on tiptoe, the philosopher stole softly into\nthe garden, whence he thought he could escape more easily into the open\ncountry. This garden was generally so choked up with weeds that it\nseemed admirably adapted for such an attempt. With the exception of a\nsingle path used by the people of the house, the whole of it was covered\nwith cherry-trees, elder-bushes, and tall heath-thistles with fibrous\nred buds. All these trees and bushes had been thickly overgrown with\nivy, which formed a kind of roof. Its tendrils reached to the hedge and\nfell down on the other side in snake-like curves among the small, wild\nfield-flowers. Behind the hedge which bordered the garden was a dense\nmass of wild heather, in which it did not seem probable that anyone\nwould care to venture himself, and the strong, stubborn stems of which\nseemed likely to baffle any attempt to cut them.\n\nAs the philosopher was about to climb over the hedge, his teeth\nchattered, and his heart beat so violently that he felt frightened at\nit. The skirts of his long cloak seemed to cling to the ground as though\nthey had been fastened to it by pegs. When he had actually got over the\nhedge he seemed to hear a shrill voice crying behind him \"Whither?\nWhither?\"\n\nHe jumped into the heather and began to run, stumbling over old roots\nand treading on unfortunate moles. When he had emerged from the heather\nhe saw that he still had a wide field to cross, behind which was a\nthick, thorny underwood. This, according to his calculation, must\nstretch as far as the road leading to Kieff, and if he reached it he\nwould be safe. Accordingly he ran over the field and plunged into the\nthorny copse. Every sharp thorn he encountered tore a fragment from his\ncoat. Then he reached a small open space; in the centre of it stood a\nwillow, whose branches hung down to the earth, and close by flowed a\nclear spring bright as silver. The first thing the philosopher did was\nto lie down and drink eagerly, for he was intolerably thirsty.\n\n\"Splendid water!\" he said, wiping his mouth. \"This is a good place to\nrest in.\"\n\n\"No, better run farther; perhaps we are being followed,\" said a voice\nimmediately behind him.\n\nThomas started and turned; before him stood Javtuch.\n\n\"This devil of a Javtuch!\" he thought. \"I should like to seize him by\nthe feet and smash his hang-dog face against the trunk of a tree.\"\n\n\"Why did you go round such a long way?\" continued Javtuch. \"You had much\nbetter have chosen the path by which I came; it leads directly by the\nstable. Besides, it is a pity about your coat. Such splendid cloth! How\nmuch did it cost an ell? Well, we have had a long enough walk; it is\ntime to go home.\"\n\nThe philosopher followed Javtuch in a very depressed state.\n\n\"Now the accursed witch will attack me in earnest,\" he thought. \"But\nwhat have I really to fear? Am I not a Cossack? I have read the prayers\nfor two nights already; with God's help I will get through the third\nnight also. It is plain that the witch must have a terrible load of\nguilt upon her, else the evil one would not help her so much.\"\n\nFeeling somewhat encouraged by these reflections, he returned to the\ncourt-yard and asked Dorosch, who sometimes, by the steward's\npermission, had access to the wine-cellar, to fetch him a small bottle\nof brandy. The two friends sat down before a barn and drank a pretty\nlarge one. Suddenly the philosopher jumped up and said, \"I want\nmusicians! Bring some musicians!\"\n\nBut without waiting for them he began to dance the \"tropak\" in the\ncourt-yard. He danced till tea-time, and the servants, who, as is usual\nin such cases, had formed a small circle round him, grew at last tired\nof watching him, and went away saying, \"By heavens, the man can dance!\"\n\nFinally the philosopher lay down in the place where he had been dancing,\nand fell asleep. It was necessary to pour a bucket of cold water on his\nhead to wake him up for supper. At the meal he enlarged on the topic of\nwhat a Cossack ought to be, and how he should not be afraid of anything\nin the world.\n\n\"It is time,\" said Javtuch; \"let us go.\"\n\n\"I wish I could put a lighted match to your tongue,\" thought the\nphilosopher; then he stood up and said, \"Let us go.\"\n\nOn their way to the church, the philosopher kept looking round him on\nall sides, and tried to start a conversation with his companions; but\nboth Javtuch and Dorosch remained silent. It was a weird night. In the\ndistance wolves howled continually, and even the barking of the dogs had\nsomething unearthly about it.\n\n\"That doesn't sound like wolves howling, but something else,\" remarked\nDorosch.\n\nJavtuch still kept silence, and the philosopher did not know what answer\nto make.\n\nThey reached the church and walked over the old wooden planks, whose\nrotten condition showed how little the lord of the manor cared about God\nand his soul. Javtuch and Dorosch left the philosopher alone, as on the\nprevious evenings.\n\nThere was still the same atmosphere of menacing silence in the church,\nin the centre of which stood the coffin with the terrible witch inside\nit.\n\n\"I am not afraid, by heavens, I am not afraid!\" he said; and after\ndrawing a circle round himself as before, he began to read the prayers\nand exorcisms.\n\nAn oppressive silence prevailed; the flickering candles filled the\nchurch with their clear light. The philosopher turned one page after\nanother, and noticed that he was not reading what was in the book. Full\nof alarm, he crossed himself and began to sing a hymn. This calmed him\nsomewhat, and he resumed his reading, turning the pages rapidly as he\ndid so.\n\nSuddenly in the midst of the sepulchral silence the iron lid of the\ncoffin sprang open with a jarring noise, and the dead witch stood up.\nShe was this time still more terrible in aspect than at first. Her teeth\nchattered loudly and her lips, through which poured a stream of dreadful\ncurses, moved convulsively. A whirlwind arose in the church; the icons\nof the saints fell on the ground, together with the broken window-panes.\nThe door was wrenched from its hinges, and a huge mass of monstrous\ncreatures rushed into the church, which became filled with the noise of\nbeating wings and scratching claws. All these creatures flew and crept\nabout, seeking for the philosopher, from whose brain the last fumes of\nintoxication had vanished. He crossed himself ceaselessly and uttered\nprayer after prayer, hearing all the time the whole unclean swarm\nrustling about him, and brushing him with the tips of their wings. He\nhad not the courage to look at them; he only saw one uncouth monster\nstanding by the wall, with long, shaggy hair and two flaming eyes. Over\nhim something hung in the air which looked like a gigantic bladder\ncovered with countless crabs' claws and scorpions' stings, and with\nblack clods of earth hanging from it. All these monsters stared about\nseeking him, but they could not find him, since he was protected by his\nsacred circle.\n\n\"Bring the Viy(3)! Bring the Viy!\" cried the witch.\n\n  (3) The king of the gnomes.\n\nA sudden silence followed; the howling of wolves was heard in the\ndistance, and soon heavy footsteps resounded through the church. Thomas\nlooked up furtively and saw that an ungainly human figure with crooked\nlegs was being led into the church. He was quite covered with black\nsoil, and his hands and feet resembled knotted roots. He trod heavily\nand stumbled at every step. His eyelids were of enormous length. With\nterror, Thomas saw that his face was of iron. They led him in by the\narms and placed him near Thomas's circle.\n\n\"Raise my eyelids! I can't see anything!\" said the Viy in a dull, hollow\nvoice, and they all hastened to help in doing so.\n\n\"Don't look!\" an inner voice warned the philosopher; but he could not\nrestrain from looking.\n\n\"There he is!\" exclaimed the Viy, pointing an iron finger at him; and\nall the monsters rushed on him at once.\n\nStruck dumb with terror, he sank to the ground and died.\n\nAt that moment there sounded a cock's crow for the second time; the\nearth-spirits had not heard the first one. In alarm they hurried to the\nwindows and the door to get out as quickly as possible. But it was too\nlate; they all remained hanging as though fastened to the door and the\nwindows.\n\nWhen the priest came he stood amazed at such a desecration of God's\nhouse, and did not venture to read prayers there. The church remained\nstanding as it was, with the monsters hanging on the windows and the\ndoor. Gradually it became overgrown with creepers, bushes, and wild\nheather, and no one can discover it now.\n\n                   *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the report of this event reached Kieff, and the theologian Khalava\nheard what a fate had overtaken the philosopher Thomas, he sank for a\nwhole hour into deep reflection. He had greatly altered of late; after\nfinishing his studies he had become bell-ringer of one of the chief\nchurches in the city, and he always appeared with a bruised nose,\nbecause the belfry staircase was in a ruinous condition.\n\n\"Have you heard what has happened to Thomas?\" said Tiberius Gorobetz,\nwho had become a philosopher and now wore a moustache.\n\n\"Yes; God had appointed it so,\" answered the bell-ringer. \"Let us go to\nthe ale-house; we will drink a glass to his memory.\"\n\nThe young philosopher, who, with the enthusiasm of a novice, had made\nsuch full use of his privileges as a student that his breeches and coat\nand even his cap reeked of brandy and tobacco, agreed readily to the\nproposal.\n\n\"He was a fine fellow, Thomas,\" said the bell-ringer as the limping\ninnkeeper set the third jug of beer before him. \"A splendid fellow! And\nlost his life for nothing!\"\n\n\"I know why he perished,\" said Gorobetz; \"because he was afraid. If he\nhad not feared her, the witch could have done nothing to him. One ought\nto cross oneself incessantly and spit exactly on her tail, and then not\nthe least harm can happen. I know all about it, for here, in Kieff, all\nthe old women in the market-place are witches.\"\n\nThe bell-ringer nodded assent. But being aware that he could not say any\nmore, he got up cautiously and went out, swaying to the right and left\nin order to find a hiding-place in the thick steppe grass outside the\ntown. At the same time, in accordance with his old habits, he did not\nforget to steal an old boot-sole which lay on the ale-house bench.\n\nTHE END\n\n\nTHE NORTHUMBERLAND PRESS, THORNTON STREET, NEWCASTLE-UPON-TYNE\n\n\n\n\n  [ Transcriber's Note:\n\n    The following is a list of corrections made to the original.\n    The first line is the original line, the second the corrected one.\n\n  31 (N.S) 1809, died at Moscow, March 4 (N.S.), 1852.

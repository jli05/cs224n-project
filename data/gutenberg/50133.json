{"summary": "In the isolated, desolate, decrepit village of Dunwich, Wilbur Whateley is the hideous son of Lavinia Whateley, a deformed and unstable albino mother, and an unknown father (alluded to in passing by mad Old Whateley, as \"Yog-Sothoth\"). Strange events surround his birth and precocious development. Wilbur matures at an abnormal rate, reaching manhood within a decade. Locals shun him and his family, and animals fear and despise him (due to his odor). All the while, his sorcerer grandfather indoctrinates him into certain dark rituals and the study of witchcraft. Various locals grow suspicious after Old Whateley buys more and more cattle, yet the number of his herd never increases, and the cattle in his field become mysteriously afflicted with severe open wounds.\nWilbur and his grandfather have sequestered an unseen presence at their farmhouse; this being is connected somehow to Yog-Sothoth. Year by year, this unseen entity grows to monstrous proportions, requiring the two men to make frequent modifications to their residence. People begin to notice a trend of cattle mysteriously disappearing. Wilbur's grandfather dies. His mother disappears soon afterwards. The colossal entity eventually occupies the whole interior of the farmhouse.\nWilbur ventures to Miskatonic University in Arkham to procure their copy of the Necronomicon – Miskatonic's library is one of only a handful in the world to stock an original. The Necronomicon has spells that Wilbur can use to summon the Old Ones, but his family's copy is damaged and lacks the page he needs to open the \"door\". When the librarian, Dr. Henry Armitage, refuses to release the university's copy to him (and has, by sending warnings to other libraries, thwarted Wilbur's efforts to consult their copies), Wilbur breaks into the library at night to steal it. A guard dog, maddened by Wilbur's alien body odor, attacks Wilbur with unusual ferocity, killing him. When Dr. Armitage and two other professors arrive on the scene, they see Wilbur Whateley's semi-human corpse before it melts completely, leaving no evidence.\nWith Wilbur Whateley dead, no one attends to the mysterious presence growing in the Whateley farmhouse. Early one morning, the Whateley farmhouse explodes and the thing, an invisible monster, rampages across Dunwich, cutting a path through fields, trees, and ravines, leaving huge \"prints\" the size of tree trunks. The monster eventually makes forays into inhabited areas. The invisible creature terrorizes the town for several days, killing two families and several policemen, until Dr. Armitage, Professor Warren Rice, and Dr. Francis Morgan arrive with the knowledge and weapons needed to kill it. The use of a magic powder renders it visible just long enough to send one of the crew into shock. The barn-sized monster screams for help - in English - just before the spell destroys it, leaving a huge burned area. In the end, its nature is revealed: it is Wilbur's twin brother, though it \"looked more like the father than Wilbur did.\"\n\n", "full_text": "_The_ Dunwich Horror\n\n                        by H. P. LOVECRAFT\n\n\n     \"Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras--dire stories of Cel�no and\n     the Harpies--may reproduce themselves in the brain of\n     superstition--_but they were there before_. They are transcripts,\n     types--the archetypes are in us, and eternal. How else should the\n     recital of that which we know in a waking sense to be false come\n     to affect us at all? Is it that we naturally conceive terror from\n     such objects, considered in their capacity of being able to\n     inflict upon us bodily injury? Oh, least of all! _These terrors\n     are of older standing. They date beyond body_--or without the\n     body, they would have been the same.... That the kind of fear here\n     treated is purely spiritual--that it is strong in proportion as it\n     is objectless on earth, that it predominates in the period of our\n     sinless infancy--are difficulties the solution of which might\n     afford some probable insight into our ante-mundane condition, and\n     a peep at least into the shadowland of pre-existence.\"--Charles\n     Lamb: _Witches and Other Night-Fears_.\n\n\n1\n\nWhen a traveler in north central Massachusetts takes the wrong fork\nat the junction of the Aylesbury pike just beyond Dean's Corners he\ncomes upon a lonely and curious country. The ground gets higher, and\nthe brier-bordered stone walls press closer and closer against the ruts\nof the dusty, curving road. The trees of the frequent forest belts\nseem too large, and the wild weeds, brambles, and grasses attain a\nluxuriance not often found in settled regions. At the same time the\nplanted fields appear singularly few and barren; while the sparsely\nscattered houses wear a surprizing uniform aspect of age, squalor, and\ndilapidation. Without knowing why, one hesitates to ask directions\nfrom the gnarled, solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling\ndoorsteps or in the sloping, rock-strewn meadows. Those figures are\nso silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden\nthings, with which it would be better to have nothing to do. When a\nrise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods,\nthe feeling of strange uneasiness is increased. The summits are too\nrounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and\nsometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles\nof tall stone pillars with which most of them are crowned.\n\nGorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way, and the\ncrude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety. When the road\ndips again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively\ndislikes, and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills\nchatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to\nthe raucous, creepily insistent rhythms of stridently piping bullfrogs.\nThe thin, shining line of the Miskatonic's upper reaches has an oddly\nserpentlike suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills\namong which it rises.\n\nAs the hills draw nearer, one heeds their wooded sides more than their\nstone-crowned tops. Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously\nthat one wishes they would keep their distance, but there is no road by\nwhich to escape them. Across a covered bridge one sees a small village\nhuddled between the stream and the vertical slope of Round Mountain,\nand wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an\nearlier architectural period than that of the neighboring region. It\nis not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the houses\nare deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken-steepled church\nnow harbors the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet.\nOne dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no\nway to avoid it. Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a\nfaint, malign odor about the village street, as of the massed mold and\ndecay of centuries. It is always a relief to get clear of the place,\nand to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across\nthe level country beyond till it rejoins the Aylesbury pike. Afterward\none sometimes learns that one has been through Dunwich.\n\nOutsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain\nseason of horror all the signboards pointing toward it have been taken\ndown. The scenery, judged by any ordinary esthetic canon, is more\nthan commonly beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer\ntourists. Two centuries ago, when talk of witch-blood, Satan-worship,\nand strange forest presences was not laughed at, it was the custom to\ngive reasons for avoiding the locality. In our sensible age--since\nthe Dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had the town's\nand the world's welfare at heart--people shun it without knowing\nexactly why. Perhaps one reason--though it can not apply to uninformed\nstrangers--is that the natives are now repellently decadent, having\ngone far along that path of retrogression so common in many New England\nbackwaters. They have come to form a race by themselves, with the\nwell-defined mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding.\nThe average of their intelligence is wofully low, whilst their annals\nreek of overt viciousness and of half-hidden murders, incests, and\ndeeds of almost unnamable violence and perversity. The old gentry,\nrepresenting the two or three armigerous families which came from\nSalem in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of decay;\nthough many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that\nonly their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace. Some of\nthe Whateleys and Bishops still send their eldest sons to Harvard and\nMiskatonic, though those sons seldom return to the moldering gambrel\nroofs under which they and their ancestors were born.\n\nNo one, even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror,\ncan say just what is the matter with Dunwich; though old legends speak\nof unhallowed rites and conclaves of the Indians, amidst which they\ncalled forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills, and\nmade wild orgiastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and\nrumblings from the ground below. In 1747 the Reverend Abijah Hoadley,\nnewly come to the Congregational Church at Dunwich Village, preached a\nmemorable sermon on the close presence of Satan and his imps, in which\nhe said:\n\n     It must be allow'd that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train\n     of D�mons are Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny'd; the\n     cursed Voices of _Azazel_ and _Buzrael_, of _Beelzebub_ and\n     _Belial_, being heard from under Ground by above a Score of\n     credible Witnesses now living. I myself did not more than a\n     Fortnight ago catch a very plain Discourse of evill Powers in the\n     Hill behind my House; wherein there were a Rattling and Rolling,\n     Groaning, Screeching, and Hissing, such as no Things of this Earth\n     cou'd raise up, and which must needs have come from those Caves\n     that only black Magick can discover, and only the Divell unlock.\n\nMr. Hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon; but the\ntext, printed in Springfield, is still extant. Noises in the hills\ncontinued to be reported from year to year, and still form a puzzle to\ngeologists and physiographers.\n\nOther traditions tell of foul odors near the hill-crowning circles of\nstone pillars, and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at\ncertain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines;\nwhile still others try to explain the Devil's Hop Yard--a bleak,\nblasted hillside where no tree, shrub, or grass-blade will grow. Then,\ntoo, the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills\nwhich grow vocal on warm nights. It is vowed that the birds are\npsychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying, and that they\ntime their eery cries in unison with the sufferer's struggling breath.\nIf they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body, they\ninstantly flutter away chittering in demoniac laughter; but if they\nfail, they subside gradually into a disappointed silence.\n\nThese tales, of course, are obsolete and ridiculous; because they come\ndown from very old times. Dunwich is indeed ridiculously old--older by\nfar than any of the communities within thirty miles of it. South of the\nvillage one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient\nBishop house, which was built before 1700; whilst the ruins of the mill\nat the falls, built in 1806, form the most modern piece of architecture\nto be seen. Industry did not flourish here, and the Nineteenth Century\nfactory movement proved short-lived. Oldest of all are the great\nrings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hilltops, but these are more\ngenerally attributed to the Indians than to the settlers. Deposits of\nskulls and bones, found within these circles and around the sizable\ntable-like rock on Sentinel Hill, sustain the popular belief that such\nspots were once the burial-places of the Pocumtucks; even though many\nethnologists, disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory,\npersist in believing the remains Caucasian.\n\n\n2\n\nIt was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited\nfarmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile\nand a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur Whateley was born at 5\na. m. on Sunday, the second of February, 1913. This date was recalled\nbecause it was Candlemas, which people in Dunwich curiously observe\nunder another name; and because the noises in the hills had sounded,\nand all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently, throughout\nthe night before. Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother\nwas one of the decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed, unattractive\nalbino woman of 35, living with an aged and half-insane father\nabout whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered\nin his youth. Lavinia Whateley had no known husband, but according\nto the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child;\nconcerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might--and\ndid--speculate as widely as they chose. On the contrary, she seemed\nstrangely proud of the dark, goatish-looking infant who formed such a\ncontrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism, and was heard to\nmutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous\nfuture.\n\nLavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things, for she was a\nlone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and\ntrying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited\nthrough two centuries of Whateleys, and which were fast falling to\npieces with age and worm-holes. She had never been to school, but was\nfilled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that Old Whateley had\ntaught her. The remote farmhouse had always been feared because of Old\nWhateley's reputation for black magic, and the unexplained death by\nviolence of Mrs. Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years old had not\nhelped to make the place popular. Isolated among strange influences,\nLavinia was fond of wild and grandiose daydreams and singular\noccupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a\nhome from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since\ndisappeared.\n\nThere was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises\nand the dogs' barking on the night Wilbur was born, but no known doctor\nor midwife presided at his coming. Neighbors knew nothing of him till\na week afterward, when Old Whateley drove his sleigh through the snow\ninto Dunwich Village and discoursed incoherently to the group of\nloungers at Osborn's general store. There seemed to be a change in the\nold man--an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which\nsubtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear--though he\nwas not one to be perturbed by any common family event. Amidst it all\nhe showed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and\nwhat he said of the child's paternity was remembered by many of his\nhearers years afterward.\n\n\"I dun't keer what folks think--ef Lavinny's boy looked like his pa, he\nwouldn't look like nothin' ye expeck. Ye needn't think the only folks\nis the folks hereabouts. Lavinny's read some, an' has seed some things\nthe most o' ye only tell abaout. I calc'late her man is as good a\nhusban' as ye kin find this side of Aylesbury; an' ef ye knowed as much\nabaout the hills as I dew, ye wouldn't ast no better church weddin' nor\nher'n. Let me tell ye suthin'--_some day yew folks'll hear a child o'\nLavinny's a-callin' its father's name on the top o' Sentinel Hill!_\"\n\nThe only persons who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life\nwere old Zechariah Whateley, of the undecayed Whateleys, and Earl\nSawyer's common-law wife, Mamie Bishop. Mamie's visit was frankly one\nof curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations;\nbut Zechariah came to lead a pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley\nhad bought of his son Curtis. This marked the beginning of a course of\ncattle-buying on the part of small Wilbur's family which ended only\nin 1928, when the Dunwich horror came and went; yet at no time did\nthe ramshackle Whateley barn seem over-crowded with livestock. There\ncame a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count\nthe herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old\nfarmhouse, and they could never find more than ten or twelve anemic,\nbloodless-looking specimens. Evidently some blight or distemper,\nperhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi\nand timbers of the filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality amongst the\nWhateley animals. Odd wounds or sores, having something of the aspect\nof incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle; and once or twice\nduring the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern\nsimilar sores about the throats of the gray, unshaven old man and his\nslatternly, crinkly-haired albino daughter.\n\nIn the spring after Wilbur's birth Lavinia resumed her customary\nrambles in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy\nchild. Public interest in the Whateleys subsided after most of the\ncountry folk had seen the baby, and no one bothered to comment on the\nswift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit.\nWilbur's growth was indeed phenomenal, for within three months of his\nbirth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in\ninfants under a full year of age. His motions and even his vocal sounds\nshowed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant,\nand no one was really unprepared when, at seven months, he began to\nwalk unassisted, with falterings which another month was sufficient to\nremove.\n\nIt was somewhat after this time--on Hallowe'en--that a great blaze was\nseen at midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like\nstone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones. Considerable talk\nwas started when Silas Bishop--of the undecayed Bishops--mentioned\nhaving seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother\nabout an hour before the blaze was remarked. Silas was rounding up a\nstray heifer, but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied\nthe two figures in the dim light of his lantern. They darted almost\nnoiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed\nto think they were entirely unclothed. Afterward he could not be sure\nabout the boy, who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair\nof dark blue trunks or trousers on. Wilbur was never subsequently seen\nalive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire, the\ndisarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to\nfill him with anger and alarm. His contrast with his squalid mother and\ngrandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror\nof 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons.\n\nThe next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that\n\"Lavinny's black brat\" had commenced to talk, and at the age of only\neleven months. His speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its\ndifference from the ordinary accents of the region, and because it\ndisplayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of\nthree or four might well be proud. The boy was not talkative, yet when\nhe spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed\nby Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness did not reside in what he\nsaid, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked\nwith his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the\nspoken sounds. His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity;\nfor though he shared his mother's and grandfather's chinlessness, his\nfirm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression on his\nlarge, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood\nand well-nigh preternatural intelligence. He was, however, exceedingly\nugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost\ngoatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish\nskin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears. He was soon\ndisliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all\nconjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic\nof Old Whateley, and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the\ndreadful name of _Yog-Sothoth_ in the midst of a circle of stones with\na great book open in his arms before him. Dogs abhorred the boy, and\nhe was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their\nbarking menace.\n\n\n3\n\nMeanwhile Old Whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably\nincreasing the size of his herd. He also cut timber and began to\nrepair the unused parts of his house--a spacious, peaked-roofed affair\nwhose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside, and whose\nthree least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always been sufficient for\nhimself and his daughter. There must have been prodigious reserves\nof strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard\nlabor; and though he still babbled dementedly at times, his carpentry\nseemed to show the effects of sound calculation. It had really begun\nas soon as Wilbur was born, when one of the many tool-sheds had been\nput suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock.\nNow, in restoring the abandoned upper story of the house, he was a no\nless thorough craftsman. His mania showed itself only in his tight\nboarding-up of all the windows in the reclaimed section--though many\ndeclared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at\nall. Less inexplicable was his fitting-up of another downstairs room\nfor his new grandson--a room which several callers saw, though no one\nwas ever admitted to the closely-boarded upper story. This chamber\nhe lined with tall, firm shelving; along which he began gradually to\narrange, in apparently careful order, all the rotting ancient books and\nparts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously\nin odd corners of the various rooms.\n\n\"I made some use of 'em,\" he would say as he tried to mend a torn\nblack-letter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, \"but\nthe boy's fitten to make better use of 'em. He'd orter hev 'em as well\nsot as he kin for they're goin' to be all of his larnin'.\"\n\nWhen Wilbur was a year and seven months old--in September of 1914--his\nsize and accomplishments were almost alarming. He had grown as large as\na child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker.\nHe ran freely about the fields and hills, and accompanied his mother\non all her wanderings. At home he would pore diligently over the queer\npictures and charts in his grandfather's books, while Old Whateley\nwould instruct and catechize him through long, hushed afternoons. By\nthis time the restoration of the house was finished, and those who\nwatched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a\nsolid plank door. It was a window in the rear of the east gable end,\nclose against the hill; and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden\nrunway was built up to it from the ground. About the period of this\nwork's completion people noticed that the old tool-house, tightly\nlocked and windowlessly clapboarded since Wilbur's birth, had been\nabandoned again. The door swung listlessly open, and when Earl Sawyer\nonce stepped within after a cattle-selling call on Old Whateley he was\nquite discomposed by the singular odor he encountered--such a stench,\nhe averred, as he had never before smelt in all his life except near\nthe Indian circles on the hills, and which could not come from anything\nsane or of this earth. But then, the homes and sheds of Dunwich folk\nhave never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness.\n\nThe following months were void of visible events, save that everyone\nswore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises. On\nMay Eve of 1915 there were tremors which even the Aylesbury people\nfelt, whilst the following Hallowe'en produced an underground rumbling\nqueerly synchronized with bursts of flame--\"them witch Whateleys'\ndoin's\"--from the summit of Sentinel Hill. Wilbur was growing up\nuncannily, so that he looked like a boy of ten as he entered his\nfourth year. He read avidly by himself now; but talked much less than\nformerly. A settled taciturnity was absorbing him, and for the first\ntime people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in\nhis goatish face. He would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon, and\nchant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener with a sense of\nunexplainable terror. The aversion displayed toward him by dogs had now\nbecome a matter of wide remark, and he was obliged to carry a pistol\nin order to traverse the countryside in safety. His occasional use of\nthe weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of canine\nguardians.\n\nThe few callers at the house would often find Lavinia alone on the\nground floor, while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded-up\nsecond story. She would never tell what her father and the boy were\ndoing up there, though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal\ndegree of fear when a jocose fish-peddler tried the locked door leading\nto the stairway. That peddler told the store loungers at Dunwich\nVillage that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above.\nThe loungers reflected, thinking of the door and runway, and of\nthe cattle that so swiftly disappeared. Then they shuddered as they\nrecalled tales of Old Whateley's youth, and of the strange things that\nare called out of the earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper\ntime to certain heathen gods. It had for some time been noticed that\ndogs had begun to hate and fear the whole Whateley place as violently\nas they hated and feared young Wilbur personally.\n\nIn 1917 the war came, and Squire Sawyer Whateley, as chairman of the\nlocal draft board, had hard work finding a quota of young Dunwich men\nfit even to be sent to a development camp. The government, alarmed at\nsuch signs of wholesale regional decadence, sent several officers and\nmedical experts to investigate; conducting a survey which New England\nnewspaper readers may still recall. It was the publicity attending this\ninvestigation which set reporters on the track of the Whateleys, and\ncaused the _Boston Globe_ and _Arkham Advertiser_ to print flamboyant\nSunday stories of young Wilbur's precociousness, Old Whateley's black\nmagic, the shelves of strange books, the sealed second story of the\nancient farmhouse, and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill\nnoises. Wilbur was four and a half then, and looked like a lad of\nfifteen. His lip and cheek were fuzzy with a coarse dark down, and his\nvoice had begun to break. Earl Sawyer went out to the Whateley place\nwith both sets of reporters and camera men, and called their attention\nto the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed\nupper spaces. It was, he said, exactly like a smell he had found in the\ntool-shed abandoned when the house was finally repaired, and like the\nfaint odors which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circles\non the mountains. Dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared, and\ngrinned over the obvious mistakes. They wondered, too, why the writers\nmade so much of the fact that Old Whateley always paid for his cattle\nin gold pieces of extremely ancient date. The Whateleys had received\ntheir visitors with ill-concealed distaste, though they did not dare\ncourt further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talk.\n\n\n4\n\nFor a decade the annals of the Whateleys sink indistinguishably into\nthe general life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and\nhardened to their May Eve and All-Hallow orgies. Twice a year they\nwould light fires on the top of Sentinel Hill, at which times the\nmountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence; while\nat all seasons there were strange and portentous doings at the lonely\nfarmhouse. In the course of time callers professed to hear sounds\nin the sealed upper story even when all the family were downstairs,\nand they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock\nwas usually sacrificed. There was talk of a complaint to the Society\nfor the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; but nothing ever came of\nit, since Dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world's\nattention to themselves.\n\nAbout 1923, when Wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature,\nand bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great\nsiege of carpentry went on at the old house. It was all inside the\nsealed upper part, and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded\nthat the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions\nand even removed the attic floor, leaving only one vast open void\nbetween the ground story and the peaked roof. They had torn down the\ngreat central chimney, too, and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy\noutside tin stove-pipe.\n\nIn the spring after this event Old Whateley noticed the growing number\nof whippoorwills that would come out of Cold Spring Glen to chirp under\nhis window at night. He seemed to regard the circumstance as one of\ngreat significance, and told the loungers at Osborn's that he thought\nhis time had almost come.\n\n\"They whistle jest in tune with my breathin' naow,\" he said, \"an' I\nguess they're gittin' ready to ketch my soul. They know it's a-goin'\naout, an' dun't calc'late to miss it. Yew'll know, boys, arter I'm\ngone, whether they git me er not. Ef they dew, they'll keep up\na-singin' an' laffin' till break o' day. Ef they dun't, they'll kinder\nquiet daown like. I expeck them an' the souls they hunts fer hev some\npretty tough tussles sometimes.\"\n\nOn Lammas Night, 1924, Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury was hastily summoned\nby Wilbur Whateley, who had lashed his one remaining horse through the\ndarkness and telephoned from Osborn's in the village. He found Old\nWhateley in a very grave state, with a cardiac action and stertorous\nbreathing that told of an end not far off. The shapeless albino\ndaughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside, whilst from\nthe vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of\nrhythmical surging or lapping, as of the waves on some level beach. The\ndoctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds\noutside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their\nendless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps\nof the dying man. It was uncanny and unnatural--too much, thought Dr.\nHoughton, like the whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in\nresponse to the urgent call.\n\nToward 1 o'clock Old Whateley gained consciousness, and interrupted his\nwheezing to choke out a few words to his grandson.\n\n\"More space, Willy, more space soon. Yew grows--an' _that_ grows\nfaster. It'll be ready to sarve ye soon, boy. Open up the gates to\nYog-Sothoth with the long chant that ye'll find on page 751 _of the\ncomplete edition_, an' _then_ put a match to the prison. Fire from\nairth can't burn it nohaow!\"\n\nHe was obviously quite mad. After a pause, during which the flock of\nwhippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while\nsome indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off, he\nadded another sentence or two.\n\n\"Feed it reg'lar, Willy, an' mind the quantity; but dun't let it grow\ntoo fast fer the place, fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye\nopens to Yog-Sothoth, it's all over an' no use. Only them from beyont\nkin make it multiply an' work.... Only them, the old uns as wants to\ncome back....\"\n\nBut speech gave place to gasps again, and Lavinia screamed at the\nway the whippoorwills followed the change. It was the same for more\nthan an hour, when the final throaty rattle came. Dr. Houghton drew\nshrunken lids over the glazing gray eyes as the tumult of birds faded\nimperceptibly to silence. Lavinia sobbed, but Wilbur only chuckled\nwhilst the hill noises rumbled faintly.\n\n\"They didn't git him,\" he muttered in his heavy bass voice.\n\nWilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in\nhis one-sided way, and was quietly known by correspondence to many\nlibrarians in distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days\nare kept. He was more and more hated and dreaded around Dunwich because\nof certain youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his\ndoor; but was always able to silence inquiry through fear or through\nuse of that fund of old-time gold which still, as in his grandfather's\ntime, went forth regularly and increasingly for cattle-buying. He\nwas now tremendously mature of aspect, and his height, having reached\nthe normal adult limit, seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure. In\n1925, when a scholarly correspondent from Miskatonic University called\nupon him one day and departed pale and puzzled, he was fully six and\nthree-quarters feet tall.\n\nThrough all the years Wilbur had treated his half-deformed albino\nmother with a growing contempt, finally forbidding her to go to the\nhills with him on May Eve and Hallowmass; and in 1926 the poor creature\ncomplained to Mamie Bishop of being afraid of him.\n\n\"They's more abaout him as I knows than I kin tell ye, Mamie,\" she\nsaid, \"an' naowadays they's more nor what I know myself. I vaow afur\nGawd, I dun't know what he wants nor what he's a-tryin' to dew.\"\n\nThat Hallowe'en the hill noises sounded louder than ever, and fire\nburned on Sentinel Hill as usual, but people paid more attention\nto the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated\nwhippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted Whateley\nfarmhouse. After midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of\npandemoniac cachinnation which filled all the countryside, and not\nuntil dawn did they finally quiet down. Then they vanished, hurrying\nsouthward where they were fully a month overdue. What this meant, no\none could quite be certain till later. None of the countryfolk seemed\nto have died--but poor Lavinia Whateley, the twisted albino, was never\nseen again.\n\nIn the summer of 1927 Wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and\nbegan moving his books and effects out to them. Soon afterward Earl\nSawyer told the loungers at Osborn's that more carpentry was going on\nin the Whateley farmhouse. Wilbur was closing all the doors and windows\non the ground floor, and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and\nhis grandfather had done upstairs four years before. He was living\nin one of the sheds, and Sawyer thought he seemed unusually worried\nand tremulous. People generally suspected him of knowing something\nabout his mother's disappearance, and very few ever approached his\nneighborhood now. His height had increased to more than seven feet, and\nshowed no signs of ceasing its development.\n\n\n5\n\nThe following winter brought an event no less strange than Wilbur's\nfirst trip outside the Dunwich region. Correspondence with the Widener\nLibrary at Harvard, the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, the British\nMuseum, the University of Buenos Aires, and the Library of Miskatonic\nUniversity at Arkham had failed to get him the loan of a book he\ndesperately wanted; so at length he set out in person, shabby, dirty,\nbearded, and uncouth of dialect, to consult the copy at Miskatonic,\nwhich was the nearest to him geographically. Almost eight feet tall,\nand carrying a cheap new valise from Osborn's general store, this\ndark and goatish gargoyle appeared one day in Arkham in quest of the\ndreaded volume kept under lock and key at the college library--the\nhideous _Necronomicon_ of the mad Arab Alhazred in Olaus Wormius' Latin\nversion, as printed in Spain in the Seventeenth Century. He had never\nseen a city before, but had no thought save to find his way to the\nuniversity grounds; where, indeed, he passed heedlessly by the great\nwhite-fanged watchdog that barked with unnatural fury and enmity, and\ntugged frantically at its stout chain.\n\nWilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of Dr. Dee's\nEnglish version which his grandfather had bequeathed him, and upon\nreceiving access to the Latin copy he at once began to collate the two\ntexts with the aim of discovering a certain passage which would have\ncome on the 751st page of his own defective volume. This much he could\nnot civilly refrain from telling the librarian--the same erudite Henry\nArmitage (A. M. Miskatonic, Ph. D. Princeton, Litt. D. Johns Hopkins)\nwho had once called at the farm, and who now politely plied him with\nquestions. He was looking, he had to admit, for a kind of formula or\nincantation containing the frightful name _Yog-Sothoth_, and it puzzled\nhim to find discrepancies, duplications, and ambiguities which made\nthe matter of determination far from easy. As he copied the formula\nhe finally chose, Dr. Armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder\nat the open pages; the left-hand one of which, in the Latin version,\ncontained such monstrous threats to the peace and sanity of the world.\n\n    Nor is it to be thought [ran the text as Armitage mentally\n    translated it] that man is either the oldest or the last of earth's\n    masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone.\n    The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not\n    in the spaces we know, but _between_ them. They walk serene and\n    primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. _Yog-Sothoth_ knows the\n    gate. _Yog-Sothoth_ is the gate. _Yog-Sothoth_ is the key and\n    guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in\n    _Yog-Sothoth_. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old,\n    and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have\n    trod earth's fields, and where They still tread them, and why no\n    one can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes\n    know Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, _saving\n    only in the features of those They have begotten on mankind_; and\n    of those are there many sorts, differing in likeness from man's\n    truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is\n    _They_. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words\n    have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons.\n    The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with\n    Their consciousness. They bend the forest and crush the city, yet\n    may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath in the\n    cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice\n    desert of the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones\n    whereon Their seal is engraven, but who hath seen the deep frozen\n    city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles?\n    Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. _I�\n    Shub-Niggurath!_ As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at\n    your throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one\n    with your guarded threshold. _Yog-Sothoth_ is the key to the gate,\n    whereby the spheres meet. Man rules now where They ruled once; They\n    shall soon rule where man rules now. After summer is winter, and\n    after winter summer. They wait patient and potent, for here shall\n    They reign again.\n\nDr. Armitage, associating what he was reading with what he had heard\nof Dunwich and its brooding presences, and of Wilbur Whateley and his\ndim, hideous aura that stretched from a dubious birth to a cloud of\nprobable matricide, felt a wave of fright as tangible as a draft of the\ntomb's cold clamminess. The bent, goatish giant before him seemed like\nthe spawn of another planet or dimension; like something only partly of\nmankind, and linked to black gulfs of essence and entity that stretch\nlike titan fantasms beyond all spheres of force and matter, space and\ntime.\n\nPresently Wilbur raised his head and began speaking in that strange,\nresonant fashion which hinted at sound-producing organs unlike the run\nof mankind's.\n\n\"Mr. Armitage,\" he said, \"I calc'late I've got to take that book home.\nThey's things in it I've got to try under sarten conditions that I\ncan't git here, an' it 'ud be a mortal sin to let a red-tape rule hold\nme up. Let me take it along, sir, an' I'll swar they wun't nobody know\nthe difference. I dun't need to tell ye I'll take good keer of it. It\nwa'n't me that put this Dee copy in the shape it is....\"\n\nHe stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarian's face, and his own\ngoatish features grew crafty. Armitage, half ready to tell him he might\nmake a copy of what parts he needed, thought suddenly of the possible\nconsequences and checked himself. There was too much responsibility\nin giving such a being the key to such blasphemous outer spheres.\nWhateley saw how things stood, and tried to answer lightly.\n\n\"Wal, all right, ef ye feel that way abaout it. Maybe Harvard wun't be\nso fussy as yew be.\" And without saying more he rose and strode out of\nthe building, stooping at each doorway.\n\nArmitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog, and studied\nWhateley's gorilla-like lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible\nfrom the window. He thought of the wild tales he had heard, and\nrecalled the old Sunday stories in the _Advertiser_; these things, and\nthe lore he had picked up from Dunwich rustics and villagers during\nhis one visit there. Unseen things not of earth--or at least not of\ntri-dimensional earth--rushed fetid and horrible through New England's\nglens, and brooded obscenely on the mountain tops. Of this he had\nlong felt certain. Now he seemed to sense the close presence of some\nterrible part of the intruding horror, and to glimpse a hellish advance\nin the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare. He\nlocked away the _Necronomicon_ with a shudder of disgust, but the room\nstill reeked with an unholy and unidentifiable stench. \"As a foulness\nshall ye know them,\" he quoted. Yes--the odor was the same as that\nwhich had sickened him at the Whateley farmhouse less than three years\nbefore. He thought of Wilbur, goatish and ominous, once again, and\nlaughed mockingly at the village rumors of his parentage.\n\n\"Inbreeding?\" Armitage muttered half aloud to himself. \"Great God, what\nsimpletons! Show them Arthur Machen's _Great God Pan_ and they'll think\nit a common Dunwich scandal! But what thing--what cursed shapeless\ninfluence on or off this three-dimensioned earth--was Wilbur Whateley's\nfather? Born on Candlemas--nine months after May Eve of 1912, when the\ntalk about the queer earth noises reached clear to Arkham--what walked\non the mountains that May Night? What Roodmas horror fastened itself on\nthe world in half-human flesh and blood?\"\n\nDuring the ensuing weeks Dr. Armitage set about to collect all possible\ndata on Wilbur Whateley and the formless presences around Dunwich. He\ngot in communication with Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury, who had attended\nOld Whateley in his last illness, and found much to ponder over in the\ngrandfather's last words as quoted by the physician. A visit to Dunwich\nVillage failed to bring out much that was new; but a close survey of\nthe _Necronomicon_, in those parts which Wilbur had sought so avidly,\nseemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature, methods, and\ndesires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet. Talks\nwith several students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many\nothers elsewhere, gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly\nthrough varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual\nfear. As the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be\ndone about the lurking terrors of the upper Miskatonic valley, and\nabout the monstrous being known to the human world as Wilbur Whateley.\n\n\n6\n\nThe Dunwich horror itself came between Lammas and the equinox in 1928,\nand Dr. Armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue.\nHe had heard, meanwhile, of Whateley's grotesque trip to Cambridge,\nand of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the _Necronomicon_\nat the Widener Library. Those efforts had been in vain, since Armitage\nhad issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having\ncharge of the dreaded volume. Wilbur had been shockingly nervous at\nCambridge; anxious for the book, yet almost equally anxious to get\nhome again, as if he feared the results of being away long.\n\nEarly in August the half-expected outcome developed, and in the small\nhours of the third Dr. Armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild,\nfierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus. Deep and\nterrible, the snarling, half-mad growls and barks continued; always\nin mounting volume, but with hideously significant pauses. Then there\nrang out a scream from a wholly different throat--such a scream as\nroused half the sleepers of Arkham and haunted their dreams ever\nafterward--such a scream as could come from no being born of earth, or\nwholly of earth.\n\nArmitage hastened into some clothing and rushed across the street and\nlawn to the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and\nheard the echoes of a burglar-alarm still shrilling from the library.\nAn open window showed black and gaping in the moonlight. What had come\nhad indeed completed its entrance; for the barking and the screaming,\nnow fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning, proceeded\nunmistakably from within. Some instinct warned Armitage that what was\ntaking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see, so he brushed\nback the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door. Among\nthe others he saw Professor Warren Rice and Dr. Francis Morgan, men to\nwhom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings; and these two\nhe motioned to accompany him inside. The inward sounds, except for a\nwatchful, droning whine from the dog, had by this time quite subsided;\nbut Armitage now perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of\nwhippoorwills among the shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical\npiping, as if in unison with the last breath of a dying man.\n\nThe building was full of a frightful stench which Dr. Armitage knew\ntoo well, and the three men rushed across the hall to the small\ngenealogical reading-room whence the low whining came. For a second\nnobody dared to turn on the light; then Armitage summoned up his\ncourage and snapped the switch. One of the three--it is not certain\nwhich--shrieked aloud at what sprawled before them among disordered\ntables and overturned chairs. Professor Rice declares that he wholly\nlost consciousness for an instant, though he did not stumble or fall.\n\nThe thing that lay half-bent on its side in a fetid pool of\ngreenish-yellow ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall,\nand the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin. It\nwas not quite dead, but twitched silently and spasmodically while its\nchest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant\nwhippoorwills outside. Bits of shoe-leather and fragments of apparel\nwere scattered about the room, and just inside the window an empty\ncanvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown. Near the central\ndesk a revolver had fallen, a dented but undischarged cartridge later\nexplaining why it had not been fired. The thing itself, however,\ncrowded out all other images at the time. It would be trite and not\nwholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it, but one may\nproperly say that it could not be vividly visualized by anyone whose\nideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common\nlife-forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions. It was\npartly human, beyond a doubt, with very manlike hands and head, and the\ngoatish, chinless face had the stamp of the Whateleys upon it. But the\ntorso and lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous, so\nthat only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth\nunchallenged or uneradicated.\n\nAbove the waist it was semi-anthropomorphic; though its chest, where\nthe dog's rending paws still rested watchfully, had the leathery,\nreticulated hide of a crocodile or alligator. The back was piebald\nwith yellow and black, and dimly suggested the squamous covering of\ncertain snakes. Below the waist, though, it was the worst; for here\nall human resemblance left off and sheer fantasy began. The skin was\nthickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a score of\nlong greenish-gray tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply.\nTheir arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some\ncosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system. On each of the\nhips, deep set in a kind of pinkish, ciliated orbit, was what seemed to\nbe a rudimentary eye; whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of\ntrunk or feeler with purple annular markings, and with many evidences\nof being an undeveloped mouth or throat. The limbs, save for their\nblack fur, roughly resembled the hind legs of prehistoric earth's giant\nsaurians; and terminated in ridgy-veined pads that were neither hooves\nnor claws. When the thing breathed, its tail and tentacles rhythmically\nchanged color, as if from some circulatory cause normal to the\nnon-human side of its ancestry. In the tentacles this was observable as\na deepening of the greenish tinge, whilst in the tail it was manifest\nas a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly grayish-white\nin the spaces between the purple rings. Of genuine blood there was\nnone; only the fetid greenish-yellow ichor which trickled along the\npainted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness, and left a curious\ndiscoloration behind it.\n\nAs the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing, it\nbegan to mumble without turning or raising its head. Dr. Armitage\nmade no written record of its mouthings, but asserts confidently that\nnothing in English was uttered. At first the syllables defied all\ncorrelation with any speech of earth, but toward the last there came\nsome disjointed fragments evidently taken from the _Necronomicon_,\nthat monstrous blasphemy in quest of which the thing had perished.\nThose fragments, as Armitage recalls them, ran something like \"_N'gai,\nn'gha'ghaa, bugg-shoggog, y'hah; Yog-Sothoth, Yog-Sothoth...._\"\nThey trailed off into nothingness as the whippoorwills shrieked in\nrhythmical crescendoes of unholy anticipation.\n\nThen came a halt in the gasping, and the dog raised his head in a long,\nlugubrious howl. A change came over the yellow, goatish face of the\nprostrate thing, and the great black eyes fell in appallingly. Outside\nthe window the shrilling of the whippoorwills had suddenly ceased, and\nabove the murmurs of the gathering crowd there came the sound of a\npanic-struck whirring and fluttering. Against the moon vast clouds of\nfeathery watchers rose and raced from sight, frantic at that which they\nhad sought for prey.\n\nAll at once the dog started up abruptly, gave a frightened bark, and\nleaped nervously out the window by which it had entered. A cry rose\nfrom the crowd, and Dr. Armitage shouted to the men outside that no\none must be admitted till the police or medical examiner came. He was\nthankful that the windows were just too high to permit of peering\nin, and drew the dark curtains carefully down over each one. By this\ntime two policemen had arrived; and Dr. Morgan, meeting them in the\nvestibule, was urging them for their own sakes to postpone entrance to\nthe stench-filled reading-room till the examiner came and the prostrate\nthing could be covered up.\n\nMeanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor. One need\nnot describe the _kind_ and _rate_ of shrinkage and disintegration that\noccurred before the eyes of Dr. Armitage and Professor Rice; but it is\npermissible to say that, aside from the external appearance of face\nand hands, the really human elements in Wilbur Whateley must have been\nvery small. When the medical examiner came, there was only a sticky\nwhitish mass on the painted boards, and the monstrous odor had nearly\ndisappeared. Apparently Whateley had had no skull or bony skeleton; at\nleast, in any true or stable sense. He had taken somewhat after his\nunknown father.\n\n\n7\n\nYet all this was only the prologue of the actual Dunwich horror.\nFormalities were gone through by bewildered officials, abnormal details\nwere duly kept from press and public, and men were sent to Dunwich\nand Aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs\nof the late Wilbur Whateley. They found the countryside in great\nagitation, both because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed\nhills, and because of the unwonted stench and the surging, lapping\nsounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by\nWhateley's boarded-up farmhouse. Earl Sawyer, who tended the horse and\ncattle during Wilbur's absence, had developed a wofully acute case\nof nerves. The officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome\nboarded place; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased's\nliving quarters, the newly mended sheds, to a single visit. They filed\na ponderous report at the court-house in Aylesbury, and litigations\nconcerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the\ninnumerable Whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper Miskatonic\nvalley.\n\nAn almost interminable manuscript in strange characters, written in a\nhuge ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and\nthe variations in ink and penmanship, presented a baffling puzzle to\nthose who found it on the old bureau which served as its owner's\ndesk. After a week of debate it was sent to Miskatonic University,\ntogether with the deceased's collection of strange books, for study\nand possible translation; but even the best linguists soon saw that it\nwas not likely to be unriddled with ease. No trace of the ancient gold\nwith which Wilbur and Old Whateley always paid their debts has yet been\ndiscovered.\n\nIt was in the dark of September ninth that the horror broke loose.\nThe hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening, and dogs\nbarked frantically all night. Early risers on the tenth noticed a\npeculiar stench in the air. About 7 o'clock Luther Brown, the hired boy\nat George Corey's, between Cold Spring Glen and the village, rushed\nfrenziedly back from his morning trip to Ten-Acre Meadow with the cows.\nHe was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen;\nand in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and\nlowing pitifully, having followed the boy back in the panic they shared\nwith him. Between gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs.\nCorey.\n\n\"Up thar in the rud beyont the glen, Mis' Corey--they's suthin' ben\nthar! It smells like thunder, an' all the bushes an' little trees is\npushed back from the rud like they'd a haouse ben moved along of it.\nAn' that ain't the wust, nuther. They's _prints_ in the rud, Mis'\nCorey--great raound prints as big as barrel-heads, all sunk daown deep\nlike a elephant had ben along, _only they's a sight more nor four feet\ncould make_. I looked at one or two afore I run, an' I see every one\nwas covered with lines spreadin' aout from one place, like as if big\npalm-leaf fans--twict or three times as big as any they is--hed of ben\npaounded daown into the rud. An' the smell was awful, like what it is\naraound Wizard Whateley's ol' haouse....\"\n\nHere he faltered, and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had\nsent him flying home. Mrs. Corey, unable to extract more information,\nbegan telephoning the neighbors; thus starting on its rounds the\noverture of panic that heralded the major terrors. When she got Sally\nSawyer, housekeeper at Seth Bishop's, the nearest place to Whateley's,\nit became her turn to listen instead of transmit; for Sally's boy\nChauncey, who slept poorly, had been up on the hill toward Whateley's,\nand had dashed back in terror after one look at the place, and at the\npasturage where Mr. Bishop's cows had been left out all night.\n\n\"Yes, Mis' Corey,\" came Sally's tremulous voice over the party wire,\n\"Cha'ncey he just come back a-post-in', and couldn't haff talk fer\nbein' scairt! He says Ol' Whateley's haouse is all blowed up, with\nthe timbers scattered raound like they'd ben dynamite inside; only\nthe bottom floor ain't through, but is all covered with a kind o'\ntarlike stuff that smells awful an' drips daown offen the aidges onto\nthe graoun' whar the side timbers is blowed away. An' they's awful\nkinder marks in the yard, tew--great raound marks bigger raound than a\nhogshead, an' all sticky with stuff like is on the blowed-up haouse.\nCha'ncey he says they leads off into the medders, whar a great swath\nwider'n a barn is matted daown, an' all the stun walls tumbled every\nwhich way wherever it goes.\n\n\"An' he says, says he, Mis' Corey, as haow he sot to look fer Seth's\ncaows, frighted ez he was; an' faound 'em in the upper pasture nigh the\nDevil's Hop Yard in an awful shape. Haff on 'em's clean gone, an' nigh\nhaff o' them that's left is sucked most dry o' blood, with sores on 'em\nlike they's ben on Whateley's cattle ever senct Lavinny's black brat\nwas born. Seth he's gone aout naow to look at 'em, though I'll vaow he\nwun't keer ter git very nigh Wizard Whateley's! Cha'ncey didn't look\nkeerful ter see whar the big matted-daown swath led arter it leff the\npasturage, but he says he thinks it p'inted towards the glen rud to the\nvillage.\n\n\"I tell ye, Mis' Corey, they's suthin' abroad as hadn't orter be\nabroad, an' I fer one think that black Wilbur Whateley, as come to\nthe bad eend he desarved, is at the bottom of the breedin' of it. He\nwa'n't all human hisself, I allus says to everybody; an' I think he an'\nOl' Whateley must a raised suthin' in that there nailed-up haouse as\nain't even so human as he was. They's allus ben unseen things araound\nDunwich--livin' things--as ain't human an' ain't good fer human folks.\n\n\"The graoun' was a'talkin' lass night, an' towards mornin' Cha'ncey\nhe heerd the whippoorwills so laoud in Col' Spring Glen he couldn't\nsleep none. Then he thought he heerd another faintlike saound over\ntowards Wizard Whateley's--a kinder rippin' or tearin' o' wood, like\nsome big box or crate was bein' opened fur off. What with this an'\nthat, he didn't git to sleep at all till sunup, an' no sooner was he\nup this mornin', but he's got to go over to Whateley's an' see what's\nthe matter. He see enough, I tell ye, Mis' Corey! This dun't mean no\ngood, an' I think as all the men-folks ought to git up a party an'\ndo suthin'. I know suthin' awful's abaout, an' feel my time is nigh,\nthough only Gawd knows jest what it is.\n\n\"Did your Luther take accaount o' whar them big tracks led tew? No?\nWal, Mis' Corey, ef they was on the glen rud this side o' the glen,\nan' ain't got to your haouse yet, I calc'late they must go into the\nglen itself. They would do that. I allus says Col' Spring Glen ain't no\nhealthy nor decent place. The whippoorwills an' fireflies there never\ndid act like they was creaters o' Gawd, an' they's them as says ye kin\nhear strange things a-rushin' an' a-talkin' in the air daown thar ef ye\nstand in the right place, atween the rock falls an' Bear's Den.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy that noon fully three-quarters of the men and boys of Dunwich were\ntrooping over the roads and meadows between the new-made Whateley ruins\nand Cold Spring Glen; examining in horror the vast, monstrous prints,\nthe maimed Bishop cattle, the strange, noisome wreck of the farmhouse,\nand the bruised, matted vegetation of the fields and road-sides.\nWhatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into\nthe great sinister ravine; for all the trees on the banks were bent and\nbroken, and a great avenue had been gouged in the precipice-hanging\nunderbrush. It was as though a house, launched by an avalanche, had\nslid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope.\nFrom below no sound came, but only a distant, undefinable fetor; and\nit is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge\nand argue, rather than descend and beard the unknown Cyclopean horror\nin its lair. Three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously\nat first, but seemed cowed and reluctant when near the glen. Someone\ntelephoned the news to the _Aylesbury Transcript_; but the editor,\naccustomed to wild tales from Dunwich, did no more than concoct a\nhumorous paragraph about it; an item soon afterward reproduced by the\nAssociated Press.\n\nThat night everyone went home, and every house and barn was barricaded\nas stoutly as possible. Needless to say, no cattle were allowed to\nremain in open pasturage. About 2 in the morning a frightful stench and\nthe savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at Elmer Frye's,\non the eastern edge of Cold Spring Glen, and all agreed that they\ncould hear a sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere\noutside. Mrs. Frye proposed telephoning the neighbors, and Elmer was\nabout to agree when the noise of splintering wood burst in upon their\ndeliberations. It came, apparently, from the barn; and was quickly\nfollowed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle. The\ndogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family.\nFrye lit a lantern through force of habit, but knew it would be death\nto go out into that black farmyard. The children and the women-folk\nwhimpered, kept from screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct\nof defense which told them their lives depended on silence. At last\nthe noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning, and a great\nsnapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes, huddled together\nin the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last echoes died\naway far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal moans from\nthe stable and the demoniac piping of late whippoorwills in the glen,\nSelina Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of\nthe second phase of the horror.\n\nThe next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed,\nuncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had\noccurred. Two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen\nto the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints covered the bare patches of\nground, and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in. Of\nthe cattle, only about a quarter could be found and identified. Some of\nthese were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot.\nEarl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but\nothers maintained it would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a\nbranch that hovered about half-way between soundness and decadence,\nmade darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practised on\nthe hilltops. He came of a line where tradition ran strong, and his\nmemories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether\nconnected with Wilbur and his grandfather.\n\nDarkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organize\nfor real defense. In a few cases closely related families would band\ntogether and watch in the gloom under one roof; but, in general there\nwas only a repetition of the barricading of the night before, and a\nfutile, ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks\nhandily about. Nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and\nwhen the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had\ngone as swiftly as it had come. There were even bold souls who proposed\nan offensive expedition down in the glen, though they did not venture\nto set an actual example to the still reluctant majority.\n\nWhen night came again the barricading was repeated, though there was\nless huddling together of families. In the morning both the Frye and\nthe Seth Bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague\nsounds and stenches from afar, while early explorers noted with horror\na fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting Sentinel Hill.\nAs before, the sides of the road showed a bruising indicative of the\nblasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror; whilst the conformation\nof the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions, as if the\nmoving mountain had come from Cold Spring Glen and returned to it along\nthe same path. At the base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed\nshrubbery and saplings led steeply upward, and the seekers gasped when\nthey saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the\ninexorable trail. Whatever the horror was, it could scale a sheer stony\ncliff of almost complete verticality; and as the investigators climbed\naround to the hill's summit by safer routes they saw that the trail\nended--or rather, reversed--there.\n\nIt was here that the Whateleys used to build their hellish fires and\nchant their hellish rituals by the table-like stone on May Eve and\nHallowmass. Now that very stone formed the center of a vast space\nthrashed around by the mountainous horror, whilst upon its slightly\nconcave surface was a thick fetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness\nobserved on the floor of the ruined Whateley farmhouse when the horror\nescaped. Men looked at one another and muttered. Then they looked down\nthe hill. Apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same\nas that of its ascent. To speculate was futile. Reason, logic, and\nnormal ideas of motivation stood confounded. Only old Zebulon, who\nwas not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or\nsuggested a plausible explanation.\n\nThursday night began much like the others, but it ended less happily.\nThe whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual\npersistence that many could not sleep, and about 3 a. m. all the party\ntelephones rang tremulously. Those who took down their receivers\nheard a fright-mad voice shriek out, \"Help, oh, my Gawd!...\" and some\nthought a crashing sound followed the breaking off of the exclamation.\nThere was nothing more. No one dared do anything, and no one knew\ntill morning whence the call came. Then those who had heard it called\neveryone on the line, and found that only the Fryes did not reply. The\ntruth appeared an hour later, when a hastily assembled group of armed\nmen trudged out to the Frye place at the head of the glen. It was\nhorrible, yet hardly a surprize. There were more swaths and monstrous\nprints, but there was no longer any house. It had caved in like an\negg-shell, and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be\ndiscovered--only a stench and a tarry stickiness. The Elmer Fryes had\nbeen erased from Dunwich.\n\n\n8\n\nIn the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of\nthe horror had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of\na shelf-lined room in Arkham. The curious manuscript record or diary of\nWilbur Whateley, delivered to Miskatonic University for translation,\nhad caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in languages\nboth ancient and modern; its very alphabet, notwithstanding a general\nresemblance to the heavily shaded Arabic used in Mesopotamia, being\nabsolutely unknown to any available authority. The final conclusion of\nthe linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet,\ngiving the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of\ncryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied\non the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used.\nThe ancient books taken from Whateley's quarters, while absorbingly\ninteresting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible\nlines of research among philosophers and men of science, were of no\nassistance whatever in this matter. One of them, a heavy tome with\nan iron clasp, was in another unknown alphabet--this one of a very\ndifferent cast, and resembling Sanskrit more than anything else. The\nold ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of Dr. Armitage,\nboth because of his peculiar interest in the Whateley matter, and\nbecause of his wide linguistic learning and skill in the mystical\nformul� of antiquity and the Middle Ages.\n\nArmitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically\nused by certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times,\nand which have inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of\nthe Saracenic world. That question, however, he did not deem vital;\nsince it would be unnecessary to know the origin of the symbols if,\nas he suspected, they were used as a cipher in a modern language. It\nwas his belief that, considering the great amount of text involved, the\nwriter would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another speech\nthan his own, save perhaps in certain special formul� and incantations.\nAccordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption\nthat the bulk of it was in English.\n\nDr. Armitage knew, from the repeated failures of his colleagues, that\nthe riddle was a deep and complex one, and that no simple mode of\nsolution could merit even a trial. All through late August he fortified\nhimself with the massed lore of cryptography, drawing upon the fullest\nresources of his own library, and wading night after night amidst the\narcana of Trithemius' _Poligraphia_, Giambattista Porta's _De Furtivis\nLiterarum Notis_, De Vigenere's _Trait� des Chiffres_, Falconer's\n_Cryptomenysis Patefacta_, Davys' and Thicknesse's Eighteenth Century\ntreatises, and such fairly modern authorities as Blair, von Marten,\nand Kl�ber's _Kryptographik_. He interspersed his study of the books\nwith attacks on the manuscript itself, and in time became convinced\nthat he had to deal with one of those subtlest and most ingenious of\ncryptograms, in which many separate lists of corresponding letters are\narranged like the multiplication table, and the message built up with\narbitrary key-words known only to the initiated. The older authorities\nseemed rather more helpful than the newer ones, and Armitage concluded\nthat the code of the manuscript was one of great antiquity, no doubt\nhanded down through a long line of mystical experimenters. Several\ntimes he seemed near daylight, only to be set back by some unforeseen\nobstacle. Then, as September approached, the clouds began to clear.\nCertain letters, as used in certain parts of the manuscript, emerged\ndefinitely and unmistakably; and it became obvious that the text was\nindeed in English.\n\nOn the evening of September second the last major barrier gave way, and\nDr. Armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of Wilbur\nWhateley's annals. It was in truth a diary, as all had thought; and\nit was couched in a style clearly showing the mixed occult erudition\nand general illiteracy of the strange being who wrote it. Almost the\nfirst long passage that Armitage deciphered, an entry dated November\n26, 1916, proved highly startling and disquieting. It was written, he\nremembered, by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of\ntwelve or thirteen.\n\n    Today learned the Aklo for the Sabaoth, [it ran] which did not\n    like, it being answerable from the hill and not from the air. That\n    upstairs more ahead of me than I had thought it would be, and is\n    not like to have much earth brain. Shot Elam Hutchins's collie\n    Jack when he went to bite me, and Elam says he would kill me if he\n    dast. I guess he won't. Grandfather kept me saying the Dho formula\n    last night, and I think I saw the inner city at the 2 magnetic\n    poles. I shall go to those poles when the earth is cleared off, if\n    I can't break through with the Dho-Hna formula when I commit it.\n    They from the air told me at Sabbat that it will be years before I\n    can clear off the earth, and I guess Grandfather will be dead then,\n    so I shall have to learn all the angles of the planes and all the\n    formulas between the Yr and the Nhhngr. They from outside will\n    help, but they can not take body without human blood. That upstairs\n    looks it will have the right cast. I can see it a little when I\n    make the Yoorish sign or blow the power of Ibn Ghazi at it, and it\n    is near like them at May Eve on the Hill. The other face may wear\n    off some. I wonder how I shall look when the earth is cleared and\n    there are no earth beings on it. He that came with the Aklo Sabaoth\n    said I may be transfigured, there being much of outside to work on.\n\nMorning found Dr. Armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of\nwakeful concentration. He had not left the manuscript all night, but\nsat at his table under the electric light turning page after page\nwith shaking hands as fast as he could decipher the cryptic text. He\nhad nervously telephoned his wife he would not be home, and when she\nbrought him a breakfast from the house he could scarcely dispose of a\nmouthful. All that day he read on, now and then halted maddeningly as\na reapplication of the complex key became necessary. Lunch and dinner\nwere brought him, but he ate only the smallest fraction of either.\nToward the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair, but\nsoon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths\nand menaces to man's existence that he had uncovered.\n\nOn the morning of September fourth Professor Rice and Dr. Morgan\ninsisted on seeing him for a while, and departed trembling and\nashen-gray. That evening he went to bed, but slept only fitfully.\nWednesday--the next day--he was back at the manuscript, and began to\ntake copious notes both from the current sections and from those he had\nalready deciphered. In the small hours of that night he slept a little\nin an easy-chair in his office, but was at the manuscript again before\ndawn. Some time before noon his physician, Dr. Hartwell, called to see\nhim and insisted that he cease work. He refused, intimating that it was\nof the most vital importance for him to complete the reading of the\ndiary, and promising an explanation in due course of time.\n\nThat evening, just as twilight fell, he finished his terrible perusal\nand sank back exhausted. His wife, bringing his dinner, found him in a\nhalf-comatose state; but he was conscious enough to warn her off with\na sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken.\nWeakly rising, he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all\nin a great envelope, which he immediately placed in his inside coat\npocket. He had sufficient strength to get home, but was so clearly in\nneed of medical aid that Dr. Hartwell was summoned at once. As the\ndoctor put him to bed he could only mutter over and over again, \"_But\nwhat, in God's name, can we do?_\"\n\nDr. Armitage slept, but was partly delirious the next day. He made\nno explanations to Hartwell, but in his calmer moments spoke of the\nimperative need of a long conference with Rice and Morgan. His wilder\nwanderings were very startling indeed, including frantic appeals\nthat something in a boarded-up farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic\nreferences to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race\nand all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder\nrace of beings from another dimension. He would shout that the world\nwas in danger, since the Elder Things wished to strip it and drag it\naway from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane\nor phase of entity from which it had once fallen, vigintillions of eons\nago. At other times he would call for the dreaded _Necronomicon_ and\nthe _D�monolatreia_ of Remigius, in which he seemed hopeful of finding\nsome formula to check the peril he conjured up.\n\n\"Stop them, stop them!\" he would shout. \"Those Whateleys meant to let\nthem in, and the worst of all is left! Tell Rice and Morgan we must do\nsomething--it's a blind business, but I know how to make the powder....\nIt hasn't been fed since the second of August, when Wilbur came here to\nhis death, and at that rate....\"\n\nBut Armitage had a sound physique despite his seventy-three years, and\nslept off his disorder that night without developing any real fever. He\nwoke late Friday, clear of head, though sober, with a gnawing fear and\ntremendous sense of responsibility. Saturday afternoon he felt able to\ngo over to the library and summon Rice and Morgan for a conference, and\nthe rest of that day and evening the three men tortured their brains\nin the wildest speculation and the most desperate debate. Strange and\nterrible books were drawn voluminously from the stack shelves and from\nsecure places of storage, and diagrams and formul� were copied with\nfeverish haste and in bewildering abundance. Of skepticism there was\nnone. All three had seen the body of Wilbur Whateley as it lay on the\nfloor in a room of that very building, and after that not one of them\ncould feel even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madman's\nraving.\n\nOpinions were divided as to notifying the Massachusetts State Police,\nand the negative finally won. There were things involved which simply\ncould not be believed by those who had not seen a sample, as indeed was\nmade clear during certain subsequent investigations. Late at night the\nconference disbanded without having developed a definite plan, but all\nday Sunday Armitage was busy comparing formul� and mixing chemicals\nobtained from the college laboratory. The more he reflected on the\nhellish diary, the more he was inclined to doubt the efficacy of any\nmaterial agent in stamping out the entity which Wilbur Whateley had\nleft behind him--the earth-threatening entity which, unknown to him,\nwas to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable Dunwich\nhorror.\n\nMonday was a repetition of Sunday with Dr. Armitage, for the task\nin hand required an infinity of research and experiment. Further\nconsultations of the monstrous diary brought about various changes of\nplan, and he knew that even in the end a large amount of uncertainty\nmust remain. By Tuesday he had a definite line of action mapped out,\nand believed he would try a trip to Dunwich within a week. Then, on\nWednesday, the great shock came. Tucked obscurely away in a corner of\nthe _Arkham Advertiser_ was a facetious little item from the Associated\nPress, telling what a record-breaking monster the bootleg whisky of\nDunwich had raised up. Armitage, half stunned, could only telephone\nfor Rice and Morgan. Far into the night they discussed, and the next\nday was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all. Armitage\nknew he would be meddling with terrible powers, yet saw that there was\nno other way to annul the deeper and more malign meddling which others\nhad done before him.\n\n\n9\n\nFriday morning Armitage, Rice and Morgan set out by motor for Dunwich,\narriving at the village about 1 in the afternoon. The day was pleasant,\nbut even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent\nseemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep, shadowy\nravines of the stricken region. Now and then on some mountain top a\ngaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky. From the\nair of hushed fright at Osborn's store they knew something hideous\nhad happened, and soon learned of the annihilation of the Elmer Frye\nhouse and family. Throughout that afternoon they rode around Dunwich,\nquestioning the natives concerning all that had occurred, and seeing\nfor themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear Frye ruins with\ntheir lingering traces of the tarry stickiness, the blasphemous tracks\nin the Frye yard, the wounded Seth Bishop cattle, and the enormous\nswaths of disturbed vegetation in various places. The trail up and down\nSentinel Hill seemed to Armitage of almost cataclysmic significance,\nand he looked long at the sinister altarlike stone on the summit.\n\nAt length the visitors, apprised of a party of State Police which had\ncome from Aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone\nreports of the Frye tragedy, decided to seek out the officers and\ncompare notes as far as practicable. This, however, they found more\neasily planned than performed; since no sign of the party could be\nfound in any direction. There had been five of them in a car, but now\nthe car stood empty near the ruins in the Frye yard. The natives, all\nof whom had talked with the policemen, seemed at first as perplexed as\nArmitage and his companions. Then old Sam Hutchins thought of something\nand turned pale, nudging Fred Farr and pointing to the dank, deep\nhollow that yawned close by.\n\n\"Gawd,\" he gasped, \"I telled 'em not ter go daown into the glen, an' I\nnever thought nobody'd dew it with them tracks an' that smell an' the\nwhippoorwills a-screechin' daown thar in the dark o' noonday....\"\n\nA cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike, and every ear\nseemed strained in a kind of instinctive, unconscious listening.\nArmitage, now that he had actually come upon the horror and its\nmonstrous work, trembled with the responsibility he felt to be\nhis. Night would soon fall, and it was then that the mountainous\nblasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch course. _Negotium perambulans in\ntenebris...._ The old librarian rehearsed the formul� he had memorized,\nand clutched the paper containing the alternative ones he had not\nmemorized. He saw that his electric flashlight was in working order.\nRice, beside him, took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used\nin combating insects; whilst Morgan uncased the big-game rifle on which\nhe relied despite his colleague's warnings that no material weapon\nwould be of help.\n\nArmitage, having read the hideous diary, knew painfully well what kind\nof a manifestation to expect, but he did not add to the fright of the\nDunwich people by giving any hints or clues. He hoped that it might\nbe conquered without any revelation to the world of the monstrous\nthing it had escaped. As the shadows gathered, the natives commenced\nto disperse homeward, anxious to bar themselves indoors despite the\npresent evidence that all human locks and bolts were useless before a\nforce that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose. They shook\ntheir heads at the visitors' plan to stand guard at the Frye ruins near\nthe glen; and as they left, had little expectancy of ever seeing the\nwatchers again.\n\nThere were rumblings under the hills that night, and the whippoorwills\npiped threateningly. Once in a while a wind, sweeping up out of Cold\nSpring Glen, would bring a touch of ineffable fetor to the heavy night\nair; such a fetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once before,\nwhen they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years\nand a half as a human being. But the looked-for terror did not appear.\nWhatever was down there in the glen was biding its time, and Armitage\ntold his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in the\ndark.\n\nMorning came wanly, and the night-sounds ceased. It was a gray, bleak\nday, with now and then a drizzle of rain; and heavier and heavier\nclouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the\nnorthwest. The men from Arkham were undecided what to do. Seeking\nshelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed\nFrye outbuildings, they debated the wisdom of waiting, or of taking the\naggressive and going down into the glen in quest of their nameless,\nmonstrous quarry. The downpour waxed in heaviness, and distant peals of\nthunder sounded from far horizons. Sheet lightning shimmered, and then\na forky bolt flashed near at hand, as if descending into the accursed\nglen itself. The sky grew very dark, and the watchers hoped that the\nstorm would prove a short, sharp one followed by clear weather.\n\nIt was still gruesomely dark when, not much over an hour later, a\nconfused babel of voices sounded down the road. Another moment brought\nto view a frightened group of more than a dozen men, running, shouting,\nand even whimpering hysterically. Someone in the lead began sobbing out\nwords, and the Arkham men started violently when those words developed\na coherent form.\n\n\"Oh, my Gawd, my Gawd!\" the voice choked out; \"it's a-goin' agin, _an'\nthis time by day_! It's aout--it's aout an' a-movin' this very minute,\nan' only the Lord knows when it'll be on us all!\"\n\nThe speaker panted into silence, but another took up his message.\n\n\"Nigh on a haour ago Zeb Whateley here heerd the 'phone a-ringin', an'\nit was Mis' Corey, George's wife that lives daown by the junction.\nShe says the hired boy Luther was aout drivin' in the caows from the\nstorm arter the big bolt, when he see all the trees a-bendin' at the\nmaouth o' the glen--opposite side ter this--an' smelt the same awful\nsmell like he smelt when he faound the big tracks las' Monday mornin'.\nAn' she says he says they was a swishin', lappin' saound, more nor\nwhat the bendin' trees an' bushes could make, an' all on a suddent the\ntrees along the rud begun ter git pushed one side, an' they was a awful\nstompin' an' splashin' in the mud. But mind ye, Luther he didn't see\nnothin' at all, only jest the bendin' trees an' underbrush.\n\n\"Then fur ahead where Bishop's Brook goes under the rud he heerd a\nawful creakin' an' strainin' on the bridge, an' says he could tell the\nsaound o' wood a-startin' to crack an' split. An' all the whiles he\nnever see a thing, only them trees an' bushes a-bendin'. An' when the\nswishin' saound got very fur off--on the rud towards Wizard Whateley's\nan' Sentinel Hill--Luther he had the guts ter step up whar he'd heerd\nit fust an' look at the graound. It was all mud an' water, an' the sky\nwas dark, an' the rain was wipin' aout all tracks abaout as fast as\ncould be; but beginnin' at the glen maouth, whar the trees bed moved,\nthey was still some o' them awful prints big as bar'ls like he seen\nMonday.\"\n\nAt this point the first excited speaker interrupted.\n\n\"But _that_ ain't the trouble naow--that was only the start. Zeb here\nwas callin' folks up an' everybody was a-listenin' in when a call from\nSeth Bishop's cut in. His haousekeeper Sally was carryin' on fit ter\nkill--she'd jest seed the trees a-bendin' beside the rud, an' says\nthey was a kind o' mushy saound, like a elephant puffin' an' treadin',\na-headin' fer the haouse. Then she up an' spoke suddent of a fearful\nsmell, an' says her boy Cha'ncey was a-screamin' as haow it was jest\nlike what he smelt up to the Whateley rewins Monday mornin'. An' the\ndogs was all barkin' an' whinin' awful.\n\n\"An' then she let aout a turrible yell, an' says the shed daown the\nrud hed jest caved in like the storm hed blowed it over, only the wind\nwa'n't strong enough to dew that. Everybody was a-listenin', an' ye\ncould hear lots o' folks on the wire a-gaspin'. All to onct Sally she\nyelled agin, an' says the front yard picket fence bed jest crumpled up,\nthough they wa'n't no sign o' what done it. Then everybody on the line\ncould hear Cha'ncey an' ol' Seth Bishop a-yellin', tew, an' Sally was\nshriekin' aout that suthin' heavy hed struck the haouse--not lightnin'\nnor nothin', but suthin' heavy agin' the front, that kep' a-launchin'\nitself agin an' agin, though ye couldn't see nuthin' aout the front\nwinders. An' then ... an' then....\"\n\nLines of fright deepened on every face; and Armitage, shaken as he was,\nhad barely poise enough to prompt the speaker.\n\n\"An' then ... Sally she yelled aout, 'O help, the haouse is a-cavin'\nin' ... an' on the wire we could hoar a turrible crashin', an' a hull\nflock o' screamin' ... jest like when Elmer Frye's place was took, only\nwuss....\"\n\nThe man paused, and another of the crowd spoke.\n\n\"That's all--not a saound nor squeak over the 'phone arter that. Jest\nstill-like. We that heerd it got aout Fords an' wagons an' raounded\nup as many able-bodied men-folks as we could get, at Corey's place,\nan' come up here ter see what yew thought best ter dew. Not but what I\nthink it's the Lord's judgment fer our iniquities, that no mortal kin\never set aside.\"\n\nArmitage saw that the time for positive action had come, and spoke\ndecisively to the faltering group of frightened rustics.\n\n\"We must follow it, boys.\" He made his voice as reassuring as possible.\n\"I believe there's a chance of putting it out of business. You men\nknow that those Whateleys were wizards--well, this thing is a thing\nof wizardry, and must be put down by the same means. I've seen Wilbur\nWhateley's diary and read some of the strange old books he used to\nread, and I think I know the right kind of a spell to recite to make\nthe thing fade away. Of course, one can't be sure, but we can always\ntake a chance. It's invisible--I knew it would be--but there's a powder\nin this long-distance sprayer that might make it show up for a second.\nLater on we'll try it. It's a frightful thing to have alive, but it\nisn't as bad as what Wilbur would have let in if he'd lived longer.\nYou'll never know what the world has escaped. Now we've only this one\nthing to fight, and it can't multiply. It can, though, do a lot of\nharm; so we mustn't hesitate to rid the community of it.\n\n\"We must follow it--and the way to begin is to go to the place that has\njust been wrecked. Let somebody lead the way--I don't know your roads\nvery well, but I've an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots.\nHow about it?\"\n\nThe men shuffled about a moment, and then Earl Sawyer spoke softly,\npointing with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening rain.\n\n\"I guess ye kin git to Seth Bishop's quickest by cuttin' acrost the\nlower medder here, wadin' the brook at the low place, an' climbin'\nthrough Carrier's mowin' an' the timber-lot beyont. That comes aout on\nthe upper rud mighty nigh Seth's--a leetle t'other side.\"\n\nArmitage, with Rice and Morgan, started to walk in the direction\nindicated; and most of the natives followed slowly. The sky was growing\nlighter, and there were signs that the storm had worn itself away. When\nArmitage inadvertently took a wrong direction, Joe Osborn warned him\nand walked ahead to show the right one. Courage and confidence were\nmounting; though the twilight of the almost perpendicular wooded hill\nwhich lay toward the end of their short cut, and among whose fantastic\nancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder, put these\nqualities to a severe test.\n\nAt length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out.\nThey were a little beyond the Seth Bishop place, but bent trees and\nhideously unmistakable tracks showed what had passed by. Only a few\nmoments were consumed in surveying the ruins just around the bend. It\nwas the Frye incident all over again, and nothing dead or living was\nfound in either of the collapsed shells which had been the Bishop house\nand barn. No one cared to remain there amidst the stench and the tarry\nstickiness, but all turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints\nleading on toward the wrecked Whateley farmhouse and the altar-crowned\nslopes of Sentinel Hill.\n\nAs the men passed the site of Wilbur Whateley's abode they shuddered\nvisibly, and seemed again to mix hesitancy with their zeal. It was\nno joke tracking down something as big as a house that one could not\nsee, but that had all the vicious malevolence of a demon. Opposite the\nbase of Sentinel Hill the tracks left the road, and there was a fresh\nbending and matting visible along the broad swath marking the monster's\nformer route to and from the summit.\n\nArmitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned\nthe steep green side of the hill. Then he handed the instrument to\nMorgan, whose sight was keener. After a moment of gazing Morgan cried\nout sharply, passing the glass to Earl Sawyer and indicating a certain\nspot on the slope with his finger. Sawyer, as clumsy as most non-users\nof optical devices are, fumbled a while; but eventually focused the\nlenses with Armitage's aid. When he did so his cry was less restrained\nthan Morgan's had been.\n\n\"Gawd almighty, the grass an' bushes is a-movin'! It's a-goin'\nup--slow-like--creepin' up ter the top this minute, heaven only knows\nwhat fer!\"\n\nThen the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers. It was one\nthing to chase the nameless entity, but quite another to find it.\nSpells might be all right--but suppose they weren't? Voices began\nquestioning Armitage about what he knew of the thing, and no reply\nseemed quite to satisfy. Everyone seemed to feel himself in close\nproximity to phases of nature and of being utterly forbidden, and\nwholly outside the sane experience of mankind.\n\n\n10\n\nIn the end the three men from Arkham--old, white-bearded Dr.\nArmitage, stocky, iron-gray Professor Rice, and lean, youngish Dr.\nMorgan--ascended the mountain alone. After much patient instruction\nregarding its focusing and use, they left the telescope with the\nfrightened group that remained in the road; and as they climbed they\nwere watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed around.\nIt was hard going, and Armitage had to be helped more than once. High\nabove the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker\nrepassed with snail-like deliberateness. Then it was obvious that the\npursuers were gaining.\n\nCurtis Whateley--of the undecayed branch--was holding the telescope\nwhen the Arkham party detoured radically from the swath. He told the\ncrowd that the men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak\nwhich overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of where the\nshrubbery was now bending. This, indeed, proved to be true; and the\nparty were seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the\ninvisible blasphemy had passed it.\n\nThen Wesley Corey, who had taken the glass, cried out that Armitage was\nadjusting the sprayer which Rice held, and that something must be about\nto happen. The crowd stirred uneasily, recalling that this sprayer was\nexpected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility. Two or three\nmen shut their eyes, but Curtis Whateley snatched back the telescope\nand strained his vision to the utmost. He saw that Rice, from the\nparty's point of vantage above and behind the entity, had an excellent\nchance of spreading the potent powder with marvelous effect.\n\nThose without the telescope saw only an instant's flash of gray\ncloud--a cloud about the size of a moderately large building--near the\ntop of the mountain. Curtis, who had held the instrument, dropped it\nwith a piercing shriek into the ankle-deep mud of the road. He reeled,\nand would have crumpled to the ground had not two or three others\nseized and steadied him. All he could do was moan half-inaudibly:\n\n\"Oh, oh, great Gawd ... _that ... that_....\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Oh, oh, great Gawd ... that ... that.\"]\n\nThere was a pandemonium of questioning, and only Henry Wheeler thought\nto rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud. Curtis was\npast all coherence, and even isolated replies were almost too much for\nhim.\n\n\"Bigger 'n a barn ... all made o' squirmin' ropes ... hull thing sort\no' shaped like a hen's egg bigger'n anything, with dozens o' legs like\nhogsheads that haff shut up when they step ... nothin' solid abaout\nit--all like jelly, an' made o' sep'rit wrigglin' ropes pushed clost\ntogether ... great bulgin' eyes all over it ... ten or twenty maouths\nor trunks a-stickin' aout all along the sides, big as stovepipes, an'\nall a-tossin' an' openin' an' shuttin' ... all gray, with kinder blue\nor purple rings ... _an' Gawd in Heaven--that haff face on top_!...\"\n\nThis final memory, whatever it was, proved too much for poor Curtis,\nand he collapsed completely before he could say more. Fred Farr and\nWill Hutchins carried him to the roadside and laid him on the damp\ngrass. Henry Wheeler, trembling, turned the rescued telescope on the\nmountain to see what he might. Through the lenses were discernible\nthree tiny figures, apparently running toward the summit as fast as the\nsteep incline allowed. Only these--nothing more. Then everyone noticed\na strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley behind, and even in\nthe underbrush of Sentinel Hill itself. It was the piping of unnumbered\nwhippoorwills, and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a note\nof tense and evil expectancy.\n\nEarl Sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as\nstanding on the topmost ridge, virtually level with the altar-stone\nbut at a considerable distance from it. One figure, he said, seemed\nto be raising its hands above its head at rhythmic intervals; and\nas Sawyer mentioned the circumstance the crowd seemed to hear a\nfaint, half-musical sound from the distance, as if a loud chant\nwere accompanying the gestures. The weird silhouette on that\nremote peak must have been a spectacle of infinite grotesqueness\nand impressiveness, but no observer was in a mood for esthetic\nappreciation. \"I guess he's sayin' the spell,\" whispered Wheeler as\nhe snatched back the telescope. The whippoorwills were piping wildly,\nand in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the\nvisible ritual.\n\nSuddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any\ndiscernible cloud. It was a very peculiar phenomenon, and was plainly\nmarked by all. A rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills, mixed\nstrangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky.\nLightning flashed aloft, and the wondering crowd looked in vain for\nthe portents of storm. The chanting of the men from Arkham now became\nunmistakable, and Wheeler saw through the glass that they were all\nraising their arms in the rhythmic incantation. From some farmhouse far\naway came the frantic barking of dogs.\n\nThe change in the quality of the daylight increased, and the crowd\ngazed about the horizon in wonder. A purplish darkness, born of\nnothing more than a spectral deepening of the sky's blue, pressed down\nupon the rumbling hills. Then the lightning flashed again, somewhat\nbrighter than before, and the crowd fancied that it had showed a\ncertain mistiness around the altar-stone on the distant height. No\none, however, had been using the telescope at that instant. The\nwhippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation, and the men of\nDunwich braced themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with\nwhich the atmosphere seemed surcharged.\n\nWithout warning came those deep, cracked, raucous vocal sounds which\nwill never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them. Not\nfrom any human throat were they born, for the organs of man can yield\nno such acoustic perversions. Rather would one have said they came\nfrom the pit itself, had not their source been so unmistakably the\naltar-stone on the peak. It is almost erroneous to call them _sounds_\nat all, since so much of their ghastly, infra-bass timbre spoke to\ndim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear; yet\none must do so, since their form was indisputably though vaguely that\nof half-articulate _words_. They were loud--loud as the rumblings and\nthe thunder above which they echoed--yet did they come from no visible\nbeing. And because imagination might suggest a conjectural source in\nthe world of non-visible beings, the huddled crowd at the mountain's\nbase huddled still closer, and winced as if in expectation of a blow.\n\n\"_Ygnaiih ... ygnaiih ... thflthkh'ngha ... Yog-Sothoth...._\" rang the\nhideous croaking out of space. \"_Y'bthnk ... h'ehye ... n'grkdl'lh...._\"\n\nThe speaking impulse seemed to falter here, as if some frightful\npsychic struggle were going on. Henry Wheeler strained his eye at\nthe telescope, but saw only the three grotesquely silhouetted human\nfigures on the peak, all moving their arms furiously in strange\ngestures as their incantation drew near its culmination. From what\nblack wells of Acherontic fear or feeling, from what unplumbed gulfs of\nextra-cosmic consciousness or obscure, long-latent heredity, were those\nhalf-articulate thunder-croakings drawn? Presently they began to gather\nrenewed force and coherence as they grew in stark, utter, ultimate\nfrenzy.\n\n\"_Eh-ya-ya-ya-yahaah ... e'yaya-yayaaaa ... ngh'aaaa ... ngh'aaaa_ ...\nh'yuh ... h'yuh ... HELP! HELP! ... _ff--ff--ff_--FATHER! FATHER!\nYOG-SOTHOTH!...\"\n\nBut that was all. The pallid group in the road, still reeling at\nthe _indisputably English_ syllables that had poured thickly and\nthunderously down from the frantic vacancy beside that shocking\naltar-stone, were never to hear such syllables again. Instead, they\njumped violently at the terrific report which seemed to rend the hills;\nthe deafening, cataclysmic peal whose source, be it inner earth or\nsky, no hearer was ever able to place. A single lightning bolt shot\nfrom the purple zenith to the altar-stone, and a great tidal wave of\nviewless force and indescribable stench swept down from the hill to\nall the countryside. Trees, grass, and underbrush were whipped into a\nfury; and the frightened crowd at the mountain's base, weakened by the\nlethal fetor that seemed about to asphyxiate them, were almost hurled\noff their feet. Dogs howled from the distance, green grass and foliage\nwilted to a curious, sickly yellow-gray, and over field and forest were\nscattered the bodies of dead whippoorwills.\n\nThe stench left quickly, but the vegetation never came right again.\nTo this day there is something queer and unholy about the growths on\nand around that fearsome hill. Curtis Whateley was only just regaining\nconsciousness when the Arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the\nbeams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted. They were grave\nand quiet, and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more\nterrible than those which had reduced the group of natives to a state\nof cowed quivering. In reply to a jumble of questions they only shook\ntheir heads and reaffirmed one vital fact.\n\n\"The thing has gone for ever,\" Armitage said. \"It has been split up\ninto what it was originally made of, and can never exist again. It was\nan impossibility in a normal world. Only the least fraction was really\nmatter in any sense we know. It was like its father--and most of it has\ngone back to him in some vague realm or dimension outside our material\nuniverse; some vague abyss out of which only the most accursed rites of\nhuman blasphemy could ever have called him for a moment on the hills.\"\n\nThere was a brief silence, and in that pause the scattered senses of\npoor Curtis Whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity; so\nthat he put his hands to his head with a moan. Memory seemed to pick\nitself up where it had left off, and the horror of the sight that had\nprostrated him burst in upon him again.\n\n\"_Oh, oh, my Gawd, that haff face ... that haff face on top of it ...\nthat face with the red eyes an' crinkly albino hair, an' no chin, like\nthe Whateleys.... It was a octopus, centipede, spider kind o' thing,\nbut they was a haff-shaped man's face on top of it, an' it looked like\nWizard Whateley's, only it was yards an' yards acrost...._\"\n\nHe paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a\nbewilderment not quite crystallized into fresh terror. Only old Zebulon\nWhateley, who wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been\nsilent heretofore, spoke aloud.\n\n\"Fifteen year' gone,\" he rambled, \"I heerd Ol' Whateley say as haow\nsome day we'd hear a child o' Lavinny's a-callin' its father's name on\nthe top o' Sentinel Hill....\"\n\nBut Joe Osborn interrupted him to question the Arkham men anew.\n\n\"_What was it, anyhaow_, an' haowever did young Wizard Whateley call it\naout o' the air it come from?\"\n\nArmitage chose his words carefully.\n\n\"It was--well, it was mostly a kind of force that doesn't belong in our\npart of space; a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itself\nby other laws than those of our sort of Nature. We have no business\ncalling in such things from outside, and only very wicked people\nand very wicked cults ever try to. There was some of it in Wilbur\nWhateley himself--enough to make a devil and a precocious monster of\nhim, and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight. I'm going\nto burn his accursed diary, and if you men are wise you'll dynamite\nthat altar-stone up there, and pull down all the rings of standing\nstones on the other hills. Things like that brought down the beings\nthose Whateleys were so fond of--the beings they were going to let in\ntangibly to wipe out the human race and drag the earth off to some\nnameless place for some nameless purpose.\n\n\"But as to this thing we've just sent back--the Whateleys raised it for\na terrible part in the doings that were to come. It grew fast and big\nfrom the same reason that Wilbur grew fast and big--but it beat him\nbecause it had a greater share of the _outsideness_ in it. You needn't\nask how Wilbur called it out of the air. He didn't call it out. _It was\nhis twin brother, but it looked more like the father than he did._\"", "title": "The Dunwich Horror"}

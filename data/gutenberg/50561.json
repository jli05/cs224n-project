Not just a formless fear, which implies\neither fear of something that _might_ happen, or fear of unknown\ndangers. Do you see what I mean?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Pat, letting her eyes wander over the black expanse\nof night-dark Lake Michigan. \"Certainly I see what you mean but I don't\nquite understand how you'd do it. It sounds--well, difficult.\"\n\nShe gazed at his lean profile, clear-cut against the distant light.\nHe had turned, staring thoughtfully over the lake, idly fingering the\nlevers on the steering wheel before him. The girl wondered a little at\nher feeling of contentment; she, Patricia Lane, satisfied to spend an\nevening in nothing more exciting than conversation! And they must have\nparked here a full two hours now. There was something about Nick--she\ndidn't understand exactly what; sensitivity, charm, personality. Those\nwere meaningless cliches, handles to hold the unexplainable nuances of\ncharacter.\n\n\"It _is_ difficult,\" resumed Nick. \"Baudelaire tried it, Poe tried it.\nAnd in painting, Hogarth, Goya, Dore. Poe came closest, I think; he\ncaught the essence of horror in an occasional poem or story. Don't you\nthink so?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Pat. \"I've forgotten most of my Poe.\"\n\n\"Remember that story of his--'The Black Cat'?\"\n\n\"Dimly. The man murdered his wife.\"\n\n\"Yes. That isn't the part I mean. I mean the cat itself--the second\ncat. You know a cat, used rightly, can be a symbol of horror.\"\n\n\"Indeed yes!\" The girl shuddered. \"I don't like the treacherous beasts!\"\n\n\"And this cat of Poe's,\" continued Nick, warming to his subject. \"Just\nthink of it--in the first place, it's black; element of horror. Then,\nit's gigantic, unnaturally, abnormally large. And then it's not all\nblack--that would be inartistically perfect--but has a formless white\nmark on its breast, a mark that little by little assumes a fantastic\nform--do you remember what?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"The form of a gallows!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the girl. \"Ugh!\"\n\n\"And then--climax of genius--the eyes! Blind in one eye, the other a\nbaleful yellow orb! Do you feel it? A black cat, an enormous black cat\nmarked with a gallows, and lacking one eye, to make the other even\nmore terrible! Literary tricks, of course, but they work, and _that's_\ngenius! Isn't it?\"\n\n\"Genius! Yes, if you call it that. The perverse genius of the Devil!\"\n\n\"That's what I want to write--what I will write some day.\" He watched\nthe play of lights on the restless surface of the waters. \"Pure horror,\nthe epitome of the horrible. It could be written, but it hasn't been\nyet; not even by Poe.\"\n\n\"That little analysis of yours was bad enough, Nick! Why should you\nwant to improve on his treatment of the theme?\"\n\n\"Because I like to write, and because I'm interested in the horrible.\nTwo good reasons.\"\n\n\"Two excuses, you mean. Of course, even if you'd succeed, you couldn't\nforce anyone to read it.\"\n\n\"If I succeed, there'd be no need to force people. Success would mean\nthat the thing would be great literature, and even today, in these\ntimes, there are still people to read that. And besides--\" He paused.\n\n\"Besides what?\"\n\n\"Everybody's interested in the horrible. Even you are, whether or not\nyou deny it.\"\n\n\"I certainly do deny it!\"\n\n\"But you are, Pat. It's natural to be.\"\n\n\"It isn't!\"\n\n\"Then what is?\"\n\n\"Interest in people, and life, and gay times, and pretty things,\nand--and one's self and one's own feelings. And the feelings of the\npeople one loves.\"\n\n\"Yes. It comes to exactly the point I've been stressing. People are\nsordid, life is hopeless, gay times are stupid, beauty is sensual,\none's own feelings are selfish. And love is carnal. That's the array of\nhorrors that holds your interest!\"\n\nThe girl laughed in exasperation. \"Nick, you could out-argue your\nname-sake, the Devil himself! Do you really believe that indictment of\nthe normal viewpoint?\"\n\n\"I do--often!\"\n\n\"Now?\"\n\n\"Now,\" he said, turning his gaze on Pat, \"I have no feeling of it at\nall. Now, right now, I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" she queried, smiling ingenuously at him.\n\n\"You, obviously.\"\n\n\"Gracious! I had no idea my logic was as convincing as that.\"\n\n\"Your logic isn't. The rest of you is.\"\n\n\"That sounds like a compliment,\" observed Pat. \"If it is,\" she\ncontinued in a bantering tone, \"it's the only one I can recall\nobtaining from you.\"\n\n\"That's because I seldom call attention to the obvious.\"\n\n\"And that's another,\" laughed the girl. \"I'll have to mark this date in\nred on my calendar. It's entirely unique in our--let's see--nearly a\nmonth's acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Is it really so short a time? I know you so well that it must have\ntaken years. Every detail!\" He closed his eyes. \"Hair like black silk,\nand oddly dark blue eyes--if I were writing a poem at the moment, I'd\ncall them violet. Tiny lips, the sort the Elizabethan called bee-stung.\nStraight nose, and a figure that is a sort of vest-pocket copy of\nDiana. Right?\" He opened his eyes.\n\n\"Nice, but exaggerated. And even if you were correct, that isn't Pat\nLane, the real Pat Lane. A camera could do better on a tenth of a\nsecond's acquaintance!\"\n\n\"Check!\" He closed his eyes again. \"Personality, piquant. Character,\nloyal, naturally happy, intelligent, but not serious. An intellectual\nbutterfly; a dilettante. Poised, cool, self-possessed, yet inherently\naffectionate. A being untouched by reality, as yet, living in Chicago\nand in a make-believe world at the same time.\" He paused, \"How old are\nyou, Pat?\"\n\n\"Twenty-two. Why?\"\n\n\"I wondered how long one could manage to stay in the world of\nmake-believe. I'm twenty-six, and I'm long exiled.\"\n\n\"I don't think you know what you mean by a make-believe world. I'm sure\nI don't.\"\n\n\"Of course you don't. You can't know and still remain there. It's like\nbeing happy; once you realize it, it's no longer perfect.\"\n\n\"Then don't explain!\"\n\n\"Wouldn't make any difference if I did, Pat. It's a queer world, like\nthe Sardoodledom of Sardou and the afternoon-tea school of playwrights.\nAll stage-settings and pretense, but it looks real while you're\nwatching, especially if you're one of the characters.\"\n\nThe girl laughed. \"You're a deliciously solemn sort, Nick. How would\nyou like to hear my analysis of you?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't!\"\n\n\"You inflicted yours on me, and I'm entitled to revenge. And so--you're\nintelligent, lazy, dreamy, and with a fine perception of artistic\nvalues. You're very alert to impressions of the senses--I mean you're\nsensuous without being sensual. You're delightfully serious without\nbeing somber, except sometimes. Sometimes I feel a hint, just a\nthrilling hint, in your character, of something dangerously darker--\"\n\n\"Don't!\" said Nick sharply.\n\nPat shot him a quick glance. \"And you're frightened to death of\nfalling in love,\" she concluded imperturbably.\n\n\"Oh! Do you think so?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Then you're wrong! I can't be afraid of it, since I've known for the\nbetter part of a month that I've been in love.\"\n\n\"With me,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Yes, with you!\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Pat. \"It never before took me a month to extract that\nadmission from a man. Is twenty-two getting old?\"\n\n\"You're a tantalizing imp!\"\n\n\"And so?\" She pursed her lips, assuming an air of disappointment. \"What\nam I to do about it--scream for help? You haven't given me anything to\nscream about.\"\n\nThe kiss, Pat admitted to herself, was quite satisfactory. She yielded\nherself to the pleasure of it; it was decidedly the best kiss she had,\nin her somewhat limited experience, encountered. She pushed herself\naway finally, with a little gasp, gazing bright-eyed at her companion.\nHe was staring down at her with serious eyes; there was a tense twist\nto his mouth, and a curiously unexpected attitude of unhappiness.\n\n\"Nick!\" she murmured. \"Was it as bad as all that?\"\n\n\"Bad! Pat, does it mean you--care for me? A little, anyway?\"\n\n\"A little,\" she admitted. \"Maybe more. Is that what makes you look so\nforlorn?\"\n\nHe drew her closer to him. \"How could I look forlorn, Honey, when\nsomething like this has happened to me? That was just my way of looking\nhappy.\"\n\nShe nestled as closely as the steering wheel permitted, drawing his arm\nabout her shoulders. \"I hope you mean that, Nick.\"\n\n\"Then _you_ mean it? You really do?\"\n\n\"I really do.\"\n\n\"I'm glad,\" he said huskily. The girl thought she detected a strange\ndubious note in his voice. She glanced at his face; his eyes were\ngazing into the dim remoteness of the night horizon.\n\n\"Nick,\" she said, \"why were you so--well, so reluctant about admitting\nthis? You must have known I--like you. I showed you that deliberately\nin so many ways.\"\n\n\"I--I wasn't quite sure.\"\n\n\"You were! That isn't it, Nick. I had to practically browbeat you into\nconfessing you cared for me. Why?\"\n\nHe stepped on the starter; the motor ground into sudden life. The car\nbacked into the road, turning toward Chicago, that glared like a false\ndawn in the southern sky.\n\n\"I hope you never find out,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nScience of Mind\n\n\n\"She's out,\" said Pat as the massive form of Dr. Carl Horker loomed in\nthe doorway. \"Your treatments must be successful; Mother's out playing\nbridge.\"\n\nThe Doctor gave his deep, rumbling chuckle. \"So much the better, Pat.\nI don't feel professional anyway.\" He moved into the living room,\ndepositing his bulk on a groaning davenport. \"And how's yourself?\"\n\n\"Too well to be a patient of yours,\" retorted the girl. \"Psychiatry!\nThe new religion! Just between friends, it's all applesauce, isn't it?\"\n\n\"If I weren't trying to act in place of your father, I'd resent that,\nyoung lady,\" said the Doctor placidly. \"Psychiatry is a definite\nscience, and a pretty important one. Applied psychology, the science of\nthe human mind.\"\n\n\"If said mind exists,\" added the girl, swinging her slim legs over the\narm of a chair.\n\n\"Correct,\" agreed the Doctor. \"In my practice I find occasional\nevidence that it does. Or did; your generation seems to have found\nsubstitutes.\"\n\n\"Which appears to work just as well!\" laughed Pat. \"All our troubles\nare more or less inherited from your generation.\"\n\n\"Touche!\" admitted Dr. Horker. \"But my generation also bequeathed you\nsome solid values which you don't know how to use.\"\n\n\"They've been weighed and found wanting,\" said Pat airily. \"We're busy\nreplacing them with our own values.\"\n\n\"Which are certainly no better.\"\n\n\"Maybe not, Doc, but at least they're ours.\"\n\n\"Yours and Tom Paine's. I can't see that you young moderns have brought\nany new ideas to the social scheme.\"\n\n\"New or not, we're the first ones to give 'em a try-out. Your crowd\ntook it out in talk.\"\n\n\"That's an insult,\" observed the Doctor cheerfully. \"If I weren't\nacting _in loco parentis_--\"\n\n\"I know! You'd give me a few licks in the spot popularly supposed to\ndo the most good! Well, that's part of a parent's privilege, isn't it?\"\n\n\"You've grown beyond the spanking age, my dear. Physically, if not\nmentally--though I don't say the process would hurt me as much as you.\nI'd doubtless enjoy it.\"\n\n\"Then you might try sending me to bed without my dinner,\" the girl\nlaughed.\n\n\"That's a doctor's prerogative, Pat. I've even done that to your\nMother.\"\n\n\"In other words, you're a complete flop as a parent. All the\nresponsibilities, and none of the privileges.\"\n\n\"That expresses it.\"\n\n\"Well, you elected yourself, Doc. It's not my fault you happened to\nlive next door.\"\n\n\"No. It's my misfortune.\"\n\n\"And I notice,\" remarked Pat wickedly, \"that you're not too thoroughly\n_in loco_ to neglect sending Mother a bill for services rendered!\"\n\n\"My dear girl, that's part of the treatment!\"\n\n\"So? And how?\"\n\n\"I furnish a bill just steep enough to keep your mother from indulging\ntoo frequently in medical services. Without that little practical check\non her inclinations, she'd be a confirmed neurotic. One of those sweet,\nresigned, professional invalids, you know.\"\n\n\"Then why not send her a bill tall enough to cure her altogether?\"\n\n\"She might change to psychoanalysis or New Thought,\" chuckled the\nDoctor. \"Besides, your father wanted me to look after her, and besides\nthat, I like having the run of the house.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm sure I don't mind,\" observed Pat. \"We've a dog and a canary\nbird, too.\"\n\n\"You're in fine fettle this afternoon!\" laughed her companion. \"Must've\nbeen a successful date last night.\"\n\n\"It was.\" Her eyes turned suddenly dreamy.\n\n\"You're in love again, Pat!\" he accused.\n\n\"Again? Why the 'again'?\"\n\n\"Well, there was Billy, and that Paul--\"\n\n\"Oh, those!\" Her tone was contemptuous. \"Merely passing fancies, Doc.\nJust whims, dreams of the moment--in other words, puppy love.\"\n\n\"And this? I suppose this is different--a grand passion?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said, frowning abruptly. \"He's nice, but--odd.\nAttractive as--well, as the devil.\"\n\n\"Odd? How?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's one of those minds you think we moderns lack.\"\n\n\"Intellectual, eh? New variety for you; out of the usual run of your\ndancing collegiates. I've often suspected that you picked your swains\nby the length and lowness of their cars.\"\n\n\"Maybe I did. That was one of the chief differences between them.\"\n\n\"How'd you meet this mental paragon?\"\n\n\"Billy Fields dragged him around to one of those literary evenings he\naffects--where they read Oscar Wilde and Eugene O'Neil aloud. Bill met\nhim at the library.\"\n\n\"And he out-shone all the local lights, I perceive.\"\n\n\"He surely did!\" retorted Pat. \"And he hardly said a word the whole\nevening.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't have to, if they're all like Billy! What's this prodigy's\nspecialty?\"\n\n\"He writes. I think--laugh if you want to!--I think perhaps he's a\ngenius.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Doctor Horker, \"even that's possible. It's been known to\noccur, but rarely, to my knowledge, in your generation.\"\n\n\"Oh, we're just dimmed by the glare of brilliance from yours.\" She\nswung her legs to the floor, facing the Doctor. \"Do you psychiatrists\nactually _know_ anything about love?\" she queried.\n\n\"We're supposed to.\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\n\"Just a device of Nature's for perpetuating the species. Some organisms\nmanage without it, and do pretty well.\"\n\n\"Yes. I've heard references to the poor fish!\"\n\n\"Then they're inaccurate; fish have primitive symptoms of eroticism.\nBut below the vertebrates, notably in the amoeba, I don't recall any\namorous habits.\"\n\n\"Then your definition doesn't explain a thing, does it?\"\n\n\"Not to one of the victims, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Anyway,\" said Pat decisively, \"I've heard of the old biological urge\nbefore your kind analysis. It doesn't begin to explain why one should\nbe attracted to this person and repelled by that one. Does it?\"\n\n\"No, but Freud does. The famous Oedipus Complex.\"\n\n\"That's the love of son for mother, or daughter for father, isn't it?\nAnd I don't see how that clears up anything; for example, I can just\nbarely remember my father.\"\n\n\"That's plenty. It could be some little trait in these swains of yours,\nsome unimportant mannerism that recalls that memory. Or there's that\nportrait of him in the hall--the one under the mellow red light. It\nmight happen that you'd see one of these chaps under a similar light\nin some attitude that brings the picture to mind--or a hundred other\npossibilities.\"\n\n\"Doesn't sound entirely convincing,\" objected Pat with a thoughtful\nfrown.\n\n\"Well, submit to the proper treatments, and I'll tell you exactly what\ncaused each and every one of your little passing fancies. You can't\nexpect me to hit it first guess.\"\n\n\"Thanks, no! That's one of these courses where you tell the doctor all\nyour secrets, and I prefer to keep what few I have.\"\n\n\"Good judgment, Pat. By the way, you said this chap was odd. Does that\nmean merely that he writes? I've known perfectly normal people who\nwrote.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"it isn't that. It's--he's so sweet and gentle and\nmanageable most of the time, but sometimes he has such a thrilling\nspark of mastery that it almost scares me. It's puzzling but\nfascinating, if you grasp my import.\"\n\n\"Huh! He's probably a naturally selfish fellow who's putting on a good\nshow of gentleness for your benefit. Those flashes of tyranny are\nprobably his real character in moment of forgetfulness.\"\n\n\"You doctors can explain anything, can't you?\"\n\n\"That's our business. It's what we're paid for.\"\n\n\"Well, you're wrong this time. I know Nick well enough to know if he's\nacting. His personality is just what I said--gentle, sensitive, and\nyet--It's perplexing, and that's a good part of his charm.\"\n\n\"Then it's not such a serious case you've got,\" mocked the doctor.\n\"When you're cool enough to analyze your own feelings, and dissect the\nelements of the chap's attraction, you're not in any danger.\"\n\n\"Danger! I can look out for myself, thanks. That's one thing we\nmindless moderns learn young, and don't let me catch you puttering\naround in my romances! _In loco parentis_ or just plain loco, you'll\nget the licking instead of me!\"\n\n\"Believe me, Pat, if I wanted to experiment with affairs of the heart,\nI'd not pick a spit-fire like you as the subject.\"\n\n\"Well, Doctor Carl, you're warned!\"\n\n\"This Nick,\" observed the Doctor, \"must be quite a fellow to get the\nprincess of the North Side so het up. What's the rest of his cognomen?\"\n\n\"Nicholas Devine. Romantic, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Devine,\" muttered Horker. \"I don't know any Devines. Who are his\npeople?\"\n\n\"Hasn't any.\"\n\n\"How does he live? By his writing?\"\n\n\"Don't know. I gathered that he lives on some income left by his\nparents. What's the difference, anyway?\"\n\n\"None. None at all.\" The other wrinkled his brows thoughtfully. \"There\nwas a colleague of mine, a Dr. Devine; died a good many years ago.\nReputation wasn't anything to brag about; was a little off balance\nmentally.\"\n\n\"Well, Nick isn't!\" snapped Pat with some asperity.\n\n\"I'd like to meet him.\"\n\n\"He's coming over tonight.\"\n\n\"So'm I. I want to see your mother.\" He rose ponderously. \"If she's not\nplaying bridge again!\"\n\n\"Well, look him over,\" retorted Pat. \"And I think your knowledge\nof love is a decided flop. I think you're woefully ignorant on the\nsubject.\"\n\n\"Why's that?\"\n\n\"If you'd known anything about it, you could have married mother some\ntime during the last seventeen years. Lord knows you've tried, and\nall you've attained is the state of _in loco parentis_ instead of\n_parens_.\"\n\n\n\n\n3\n\nPsychiatrics of Genius\n\n\n\"How do you charge--by the hour?\" asked Pat, as Doctor Horker returned\nfrom the hall. The sound of her mother's departing footsteps pattered\non the porch.\n\n\"Of course, Young One; like a plumber.\"\n\n\"Then your rates per minute must be colossal! The only time you ever\nsee Mother is a moment or so between bridge games.\"\n\n\"I add on the time I waste with you, my dear. Such as now, waiting to\nlook over that odd swain of yours. Didn't you say he'd be over this\nevening?\"\n\n\"Yes, but it's not worth your rates to have him psychoanalyzed. I can\ndo as well myself.\"\n\n\"All right, Pat. I'll give you a sample analysis free,\" chuckled the\nDoctor, distributing his bulk comfortably on the davenport.\n\n\"I don't like free trials,\" she retorted. \"I sent for a beauty-culture\nbook once, on free trial. I was twelve years only, and returned it in\nseven days, but I'm still getting sales letters in the mails. I must be\non every sucker list in the country.\"\n\n\"So that's the secret of your charm.\"\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"You must have read the book, I mean. If you remember the title, I\nmight try it myself. Think it'd help?\"\n\n\"Dr. Carl,\" laughed the girl, \"you don't need a book on beauty\nculture--you need one on bridge! It's that atrocious game you play\nthat's bothering Mother.\"\n\n\"Indeed? I shouldn't be surprised if you were right; I've suspected\nthat.\"\n\n\"Save your surprise for when I'm wrong, Doc. You'll suffer much less\nfrom shock.\"\n\n\"Confident little brat! You're apt to get that knocked out of you some\nday, though I hope you never do.\"\n\n\"I can take it,\" grinned Pat.\n\n\"No doubt you can, but you're an adept at handing it out. Where's this\nchap of yours?\"\n\n\"He'll be along. No one's ever stood me up on a date yet.\"\n\n\"I can understand that, you imp! Is that the famous Nick?\" he queried\nas a car purred to a stop beyond the windows.\n\n\"No one else!\" said the girl, glancing out. \"The Big Thrill in person.\"\n\nShe darted to the door. Horker turned casually to watch her as she\nopened it, surveying Nicholas Devine with professional nonchalance.\nHe entered, tall, slender, with his thin sensitive features sharply\noutlined in the light of the hall. He cast a quick glance toward the\nDoctor; the latter noted the curious amber-green eyes of the lad, set\nwide in the lean face, deep, speculative, the eyes of a dreamer.\n\n\"Evening, Nick,\" Pat was bubbling. The newcomer gave her a hasty\nsmile, with another glance at the Doctor. \"Don't mind Dr. Carl,\" she\ncontinued. \"Aren't you going to kiss me? It irks the medico, and I\nnever miss a chance.\"\n\nNicholas flushed in embarrassment; he gestured hesitantly, then placed\na hasty peck of a kiss on the girl's forehead. He reddened again at the\nDoctor's rumble of \"Young imp of Satan!\"\n\n\"Not very good,\" said Pat reflectively, obviously enjoying the\nsituation. \"I've known you to do better.\" She pulled him toward the\narch of the living room. \"Come meet Dr. Horker. Dr. Carl, this is the\naforesaid Nicholas Devine.\"\n\n\"Dr. Horker,\" repeated the lad, smiling diffidently. \"You're the\npsychiatrist and brain specialist, aren't you, Sir?\"\n\n\"So my patients believe,\" rumbled the massive Doctor, rising at the\nintroduction, and grasping the youth's hand. \"And you're the genius\nPatricia has been raving about. I'm glad to have the chance of looking\nyou over.\"\n\nNick gave the girl a harassed glance, shifting uncomfortably, and\npatently at a loss for a reply. She grinned mischievously.\n\n\"Sit down, both of you,\" she suggested helpfully. She seized his hat\nfrom the reluctant hands of Nick, sailing it carelessly to a chair.\n\n\"So!\" boomed the Doctor, lowering his great bulk again to the\ndavenport. He eyed the youth sitting nervously before him. \"Devine, did\nyou say?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I knew a Devine once. Colleague of mine.\"\n\n\"A doctor? My father was a doctor.\"\n\n\"Dr. Stuart Devine?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" He paused. \"Did you say you knew him, Dr. Horker?\"\n\n\"Slightly,\" rumbled the other. \"Only slightly.\"\n\n\"I don't remember him at all, of course, I was very young when he--and\nmy mother too--died.\"\n\n\"You must have been. Patricia claims you write.\"\n\n\"I try.\"\n\n\"What sort of material?\"\n\n\"Why--any sort. Prose or poetry; what I feel like writing.\"\n\n\"Whatever inspires you, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" The lad flushed again.\n\n\"Ever have anything published?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. In _Nation's Poetry_.\"\n\n\"Never heard of it.\"\n\n\"It has a large circulation,\" said Nick apologetically.\n\n\"Humph! Well, that's something. Whom do you like?\"\n\n\"Whom do I like?\" The youth's tone was puzzled.\n\n\"What authors--writers?\"\n\n\"Oh.\" He cast another uncomfortable glance at Pat. \"Why--I like\nBaudelaire, and Poe, and Swinburne, and Villon, and--\"\n\n\"Decadents, all of them!\" sniffed the Doctor. \"What prose writers?\"\n\n\"Well--\" He hesitated--\"Poe again, and Stern, and Rabelais--\"\n\n\"Rabelais!\" Horker's voice boomed. \"Well! Your taste can't be as bad as\nI thought, then. There's one we agree on, anyway. And I notice you name\nno moderns, which is another good point.\"\n\n\"I haven't read many moderns, sir.\"\n\n\"That's in your favor.\"\n\n\"Cut it!\" put in Pat with assumed sharpness. \"You've taken enough\nwhacks at my generation for one day.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to find one of your generation who agrees with me,\" chuckled\nthe Doctor. \"At least to the extent of not reading its works.\"\n\n\"I'll teach him,\" grinned Pat. \"I'll have him writing vess libre, and\nmaybe even dadaism, in a week.\"\n\n\"Maybe it won't be much loss,\" grunted Horker. \"I haven't seen any of\nhis work yet.\"\n\n\"We'll bring some around sooner or later. We will, won't we, Nick?\"\n\n\"Of course, if you want to. But--\"\n\n\"He's going to say something modest,\" interrupted the girl. \"He's in\nthe retiring mood now, but he's apt to change any moment, and snap your\nsurly head off.\"\n\n\"Humph! I'd like to see it.\"\n\n\"So'd I,\" retorted Pat. \"You've had it coming all day; maybe I'll do it\nmyself.\"\n\n\"You have, my dear, innumerable times. But I'm like the Hydra, except\nthat I grow only one head to replace the one you snap off.\" He turned\nagain to Nicholas. \"Do you work?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. At my writing.\"\n\n\"I mean how do you live?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said the youth, reddening again in embarrassment, \"my parents--\"\n\n\"Listen!\" said Pat. \"That's enough of Dr. Carl's cross examination.\nYou'd think he was a Victorian father who had just been approached for\nhis daughter's hand. We haven't whispered any news of an engagement to\nyou, have we, Doc?\"\n\n\"No, but I'm acting--\"\n\n\"Sure. _In loco parentis._ We know that.\"\n\n\"You're incorrigible, Pat! I wash my hands of you. Run along, if you're\ngoing out.\"\n\n\"You'll be telling me never to darken my own door again in the next\nbreath!\" She stretched forth a diminutive foot at the extremity of\na superlatively attractive ankle, caught Nick's hat on her toe, and\nkicked it expertly to his lap. \"Come on, Nick. There's a moon.\"\n\n\"There is not!\" objected the Doctor huffily. \"It rises at four, as you\nought to know. You didn't see it last night, did you?\"\n\n\"I didn't notice,\" said the girl. \"Come on, Nick, and we'll watch\nit rise tonight. We'll check up on the Doctor's astronomy, or is it\nchronology?\"\n\n\"You do and I'll know it! I can hear you come home, you imp!\"\n\n\"Nice neighbor,\" observed Pat airily, as she stepped to the door. \"I'll\nbet you peek out of the window, too.\"\n\nShe ignored the Doctor's irritated rumble as she passed into the hall,\nwhere Nick, after a diffident murmur of farewell to Horker, followed.\nShe caught up a light cape, which he draped about her shoulders.\n\n\"Nick,\" she said, \"suppose you run out to the car and wait. I think\nI've stepped too hard on Dr. Carl's corns, and I want to give him a\nlittle cheering up. Will you?\"\n\n\"Of course, Pat.\"\n\nShe darted back into the living room, perching on the arm of the\ndavenport beside the Doctor.\n\n\"Well?\" she said, running her hand through her grizzled hair. \"What's\nthe verdict?\"\n\n\"Seems like a nice kid,\" grumbled Horker reluctantly. \"Nice enough,\nbut introverted, repressed, and I shouldn't be surprised to find him\nanti-social. Doesn't adjust easily to his environment; takes refuge in\na dream world of his own.\"\n\n\"That's what he accuses me of doing,\" grinned Pat. \"That all you've got\nagainst him?\"\n\n\"That's all, but where's that streak of mastery you mentioned? You lead\nhim around on a leash!\"\n\n\"It didn't show up tonight. That's the thrill--the unexpectedness of\nit.\"\n\n\"Bah! You must've dreamed it. There's no more aggressiveness in that\nlad than in KoKo, your canary.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe it, Dr. Carl! The trouble is that he's a genius, and\nthat's where your psychology falls flat.\"\n\n\"Genius,\" said the Doctor oracularly, \"is a sublimation of qualities--\"\n\n\"I'll tell you tomorrow how sublime the qualities are,\" called Pat as\nshe skipped out of the door.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\nThe Transfiguration\n\n\nThe car slid smoothly along a straight white road that stretched ahead\ninto the darkness like an earth-bound Milky Way. In the dim distance\nbefore them, red as Antares, glowed the tail-light of some automobile;\nexcept for this lone evidence of humanity, reflected Pat, they might\nhave been flashing through the cosmic depths of interstellar space,\ninstead of following a highway in the very shadow of Chicago. The\ncolossal city of the lake-shore was invisible behind them, and the\nclustering suburbs with it.\n\n\"Queer, isn't it?\" said Pat, after a silence, \"how contented we can\nbe with none of the purchased amusement people crave--shows, movies,\ndancing, and all that.\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem queer to me,\" answered Nick. \"Not when I look at you\nhere beside me.\"\n\n\"Nice of you!\" retorted Pat. \"But it's never happened to me before.\"\nShe paused, then continued, \"How do you like the Doctor?\"\n\n\"How does he like me? That's considerably more to the point, isn't it?\"\n\n\"He thinks you're nice, but--let's see--introverted, repressed, and\nill-adjusted to your environment. I think those were the points.\"\n\n\"Well, _I_ liked _him_, in spite of your manoeuvers, and in spite of\nhis being a doctor.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with being a doctor?\"\n\n\"Did you ever read 'Tristram Shandy'?\" was Nick's irrelevant response.\n\n\"No, but I read the newspapers!\"\n\n\"What's the connection, Pat?\"\n\n\"Just as much connection as there is between the evils of being a\ndoctor and reading 'Tristram Shandy'. I know that much about the book,\nat least.\"\n\n\"You're nearly right,\" laughed Nick. \"I was just referring to one of\nTristram's remarks on doctors and lawyers. It fits my attitude.\"\n\n\"What's the remark?\"\n\n\"Well, he had the choice of professions, and it occurred to him that\nmedicine and law were the vulture professions, since lawyers live\nby men's quarrels and doctors by men's misfortunes. So--he became a\nwriter.\"\n\n\"And what do writers live by?\" queried Pat mischievously. \"By men's\nstupidity!\"\n\n\"You're precious, Pat!\" Nick chuckled delightedly. \"If I'd created you\nto order, I couldn't have planned you more to taste--pepper, tabasco\nsauce, vinegar, spice, and honey!\"\n\n\"And to be taken with a grain of salt,\" retorted the girl, puckering\nher piquant, impish features. She edged closer to him, locking her arm\nthrough his where it rested on the steering wheel.\n\n\"Nick,\" she said, her tones suddenly gentle, \"I think I'm pretty crazy\nabout you. Heaven knows why I should be, but it's a fact.\"\n\n\"Pat, dear!\"\n\n\"I'm crazy about you in this meek, sensitive pose of yours, and I'm\nfascinated by those masterful moments you flash occasionally. Really,\nNick, I almost wish you flamed out oftener.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" he said sharply.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Let's not talk about me, Pat. It--embarrasses me.\"\n\n\"All right, Mr. Modesty! Let's talk about me, then. I'll promise we\nwon't succeed in embarrassing me.\"\n\n\"And it's quite the most interesting subject in the world, Pat.\"\n\n\"Well, then?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Why don't you start talking? The topic is all attention.\"\n\nHe chuckled. \"How many men have told you you were beautiful, Pat?\"\n\n\"I never kept account.\"\n\n\"And in many different ways?\"\n\n\"Why? Have you, perchance, discovered a new way, Nick?\"\n\n\"Not at all. The oldest way of any, the way of Sappho and Pindar.\"\n\n\"O-ooh!\" She clapped her hands in mock delight. \"Poetry!\"\n\n\"The only medium that could possibly express how lovely you are,\" said\nNick.\n\n\"Nicholas, have you gone and composed a poem to me?\"\n\n\"Composed? No. It isn't necessary, with you here beside me.\"\n\n\"What's that? Some very subtle compliment?\"\n\n\"Not subtle, Pat. You're the poem yourself; all I need do is look at\nyou, listen to you, and translate.\"\n\n\"Neat!\" applauded the girl. \"Do I hear the translation?\"\n\n\"You certainly do.\" He turned his odd amber-green eyes on her, then\nbent forward to the road. He began to speak in a low voice.\n\n    \"In no far country's silent ways\n      Shall I forget one little thing--\n    The soft intentness of your gaze,\n      The sweetness of your murmuring\n    Your generously tender praise,\n      The words just hinted by a breath--\n    In no far country's silent way,\n      Unless that country's name be Death--\"\n\nHe paused abruptly, and drove silently onward.\n\n\"Oh,\" breathed Pat. \"Why don't you go on, Nick? Please.\"\n\n\"No. It isn't the mood for this night, Dear. Not this night, alone with\nyou.\"\n\n\"What is, then?\"\n\n\"Nothing sentimental. Something lighter, something--oh, Elizabethan.\nThat's it.\"\n\n\"And what's stopping you?\"\n\n\"Lack of an available idea. Or--wait. Listen a moment.\" He began, this\ntime in a tone of banter.\n\n    \"When mornings, you attire yourself\n      For riding in the city,\n    You're such a lovely little elf,\n      Extravagantly pretty!\n    And when at noon you deign to wear\n      The habit of the town,\n    I cannot call to mind as fair\n      A symphony in brown.\n\n    \"Then evenings, you blithely don\n      A daintiness of white,\n    To flash a very paragon\n      Of lightsomeness--and light!\n    But when the rounds of pleasure cease,\n      And you retire at night,\n    The Godling on your mantelpiece\n      Must know a fairer sight!\"\n\n\"Sweet!\" laughed Pat. \"But personal. And anyway, how do you know I've a\ngodling on my mantel? Don't you credit me with any modesty?\"\n\n\"If you haven't, you should have! The vision I mentioned ought to\nenliven even a statue.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the girl, \"I have one--a jade Buddha, and with all the\ncharms I flash before him nightly, he's never batted an eyelash.\nExplain that!\"\n\n\"Easily. He's green with envy, and frozen with admiration, and struck\ndumb by wonder.\"\n\n\"Heavens! I suppose I ought to be thankful you didn't say he was\npetrified with fright!\" Pat laughed. \"Oh Nick,\" she continued, in a\nvoice gone suddenly dreamy, \"this _is_ marvelous, isn't it? I mean our\nenjoying ourselves so completely, and our being satisfied to be so\nalone. Why, we've never even danced together.\"\n\n\"So we haven't. That's a subterfuge we haven't needed, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It is,\" replied the girl, dropping her glossy gleaming black head\nagainst his shoulder. \"And besides, it's much more satisfactory to be\nheld in your arms in private, instead of in the midst of a crowd, and\nsitting down, instead of standing up. But I should like to dance with\nyou, Nick,\" she concluded.\n\n\"We'll go dancing, then, whenever you like.\"\n\n\"You're delightfully complaisant, Nick. But--you're puzzling.\" She\nglanced up at him. \"You're so--so reluctant. Here we've been driving an\nhour, and you haven't tried to kiss me a single time, and yet I'm quite\npositive you care for me.\"\n\n\"Lord, Pat!\" he muttered. \"You never need doubt that.\"\n\n\"Then what is it? Are you so spiritual and ethereal, or is my\nattraction for you just sort of intellectual? Or--are you afraid?\" As\nhe made no reply, she continued, \"Or are those poems you spout about my\nphysical charms just--poetic license?\"\n\n\"They're not, and you know it!\" he snapped. \"You've a mirror, haven't\nyou? And other fellows than I have taken you around, haven't they?\"\n\n\"Oh, I've been taken around! That's what perplexes me about you, Nick.\nI'd think you were actually afraid of kissing me if it weren't--\" Her\nvoice trailed into silence, and she stared speculatively ahead at the\nribbon of road that rolled steadily into the headlights' glare.\n\nShe broke the interval of wordlessness. \"What is it, Nick?\" she\nresumed almost pleadingly. \"You've hinted at something now and then.\nPlease--you don't have to hesitate to tell me; I'm modern enough to\nforgive things past, entanglements, affairs, disgraces, or anything\nlike that. Don't you think I should know?\"\n\n\"You'd know,\" he said huskily, \"if I could tell you.\"\n\n\"Then there is something, Nick!\" She pressed his arm against her. \"Tell\nme, isn't there?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" There was the suggestion of a groan in his voice.\n\n\"You don't know! I can't understand.\"\n\n\"I can't either. Please, Pat, let's not spoil tonight; if I could tell\nyou, I would. Why, Pat, I love you--I'm terribly, deeply, solemnly in\nlove with you.\"\n\n\"And I with you, Nick.\" She gazed ahead, where the road rose over the\narch of a narrow bridge. The speeding car lifted to the rise like a\nzooming plane.\n\nAnd suddenly, squarely in the center of the road, another car, until\nnow concealed by the arch of the bridge, appeared almost upon them.\nThere was a heart-stopping moment when a collision seemed inevitable,\nand Pat felt the arm against her tighten convulsively into a bar of\nsteel. She heard her own sobbing gasp, and then, somehow, they had\nslipped unscathed between the other car and the rail of the bridge.\n\n\"Oh!\" she gasped faintly, then with a return of breath, \"That was nice,\nNick!\"\n\nBeyond the bridge, the road widened once more; she felt the car\nslowing, edging toward the broad shoulder of the road.\n\n\"There was danger,\" said her companion in tones as emotionless as the\nrasping of metal. \"I came to save it.\"\n\n\"Save what?\" queried Pat as the car slid to a halt on the turf.\n\n\"Your body.\" The tones were still cold, like grinding wheels. \"The\nbeauty of your body!\"\n\nHe reached a thin hand toward her, suddenly seized her skirt and\nsnatched it above the silken roundness of her knees. \"There,\" he\nrasped. \"That is what I mean.\"\n\n\"Nick!\" Pat half-screamed in appalled astonishment. \"How--\" She paused,\nshocked into abrupt silence, for the face turned toward her was but a\nremote, evil caricature of Nicholas Devine's. It leered at her out of\nblood-shot eyes, as if behind the mask of Nick's face peered a red-eyed\ndemon.\n\n\n\n\n5\n\nA Fantasy of Fear\n\n\nThe satyr beside pat was leaning toward her; the arm about her was\ntightening with a brutal ruthlessness, and while still staring in\nfascination at the incredible eyes, she realized that another arm and\na white hand was moving relentlessly, exploratively, toward her body.\nIt was the cold touch of this hand as it slipped over her silk-sheathed\nlegs that broke the chilling spell of her fascination.\n\n\"Nick!\" she screamed. \"Nick!\" She had a curious sensation of calling\nhim back from far distances, the while she strove with both hands and\nall her strength to press him back from her. But the ruthless force of\nhis arms was overcoming her resistance; she saw the red eyes a hand's\nbreadth from her own.\n\n\"Nick!\" she sobbed in terror.\n\nThere was a change. Abruptly, she was looking into Nick's eyes,\nblood-shot, frightened, puzzled, but indubitably Nick's eyes. The\nflaming orbs of the demon were no more; it was as if they had receded\ninto Nick's head. The arm about her body relaxed, and they were staring\nat each other in a medley of consternation, amazement and unbelief. The\nyouth drew back, huddled in his corner of the car, and Pat, breathing\nin sobs, smoothed out her rumpled apparel with a convulsive movement.\n\n\"Pat!\" he gasped. \"Oh, my God! He couldn't have--\" He paused abruptly.\nThe girl gazed at him without reply.\n\n\"Pat, Dear,\" he spoke in a low, tense murmur, \"I'm--sorry. I don't\nknow--I don't understand how--\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" she said, regaining a vestige of her customary composure.\n\"It's--all right, Nick.\"\n\n\"But--oh, Pat--!\"\n\n\"It was that near accident,\" she said. \"That upset you--both of us, I\nmean.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" he said eagerly. \"That's what it was, Pat. It must have been\nthat, but Dear, can you forgive? Do you want to forgive me?\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" she repeated. \"After all, you just complimented my\nlegs, and I guess I can stand that. It's happened before, only not\nquite so--convincingly!\"\n\n\"You're sweet, Pat!\"\n\n\"No; I just love you Nick.\" She felt a sudden pity for the misery in\nhis face. \"Kiss me, Nick--only gently.\"\n\nHe pressed his lips to hers, very lightly, almost timidly. She lay back\nagainst the seat for a moment, her eyes closed.\n\n\"That's you again,\" she murmured. \"This other--wasn't.\"\n\n\"Please, Pat! Don't refer to it,--not ever.\"\n\n\"But it wasn't you, Nick. It was just the strain of that narrow escape.\nI don't hold it against you.\"\n\n\"You're--Lord, Pat, I don't deserve you. But you know that I--I\nmyself--could never touch you except in tenderness, even in reverence.\nYou're too dainty, too lovely, too spirited, to be hurt, or to be held\nroughly, against your will. You know I feel that way about you, don't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Of course. It was nothing, Nick. Forget it.\"\n\n\"If I can,\" he said somberly. He switched on the engine, backed out\nupon the pavement, and turned the car toward the glow that marked\nChicago. Neither of them spoke as the machine hummed over the arching\nbridge and down the slope, where, so few minutes before, the threat of\naccident had thrust itself at them.\n\n\"We won't see a moon tonight,\" said Pat in a small voice, after an\ninterval. \"We'll never check up on Dr. Carl's astronomy.\"\n\n\"You don't want to tonight, Pat, do you?\"\n\n\"I guess perhaps we'd better not,\" she replied. \"We're both upset, and\nthere'll be other nights.\"\n\nAgain they were silent. Pat felt strained, shaken; there was something\nuncanny about the occurrence that puzzled her. The red eyes that had\nglared out of Nick's face perplexed her, and the curious rasping voice\nhe had used still sounded inhumanly in her memory. Out of recollection\nrose still another mystery.\n\n\"Nick,\" she said, \"what did you mean--then--when you said there was\ndanger and you came to save me?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said sharply.\n\n\"And then, afterwards, you started to say something about 'He couldn't\nhave--'. Who's 'he'?\"\n\n\"It meant nothing, I tell you. I was frantic to think you might have\nbeen hurt. That's all.\"\n\n\"I believe you, Honey,\" she said, wondering whether she really did. The\nthing was beginning to grow hazy; already it was assuming merely the\nproportions of an upheaval of youthful fervor. Such occurrences were\nnot unheard of, though never before had it happened to Patricia Lane!\nStill, even that was conceivable, far more conceivable than the dark,\nunformed, inchoate suspicions she had been harboring. They hadn't even\nbeen definite enough to be called suspicions; indefinite apprehensions\ncame closer.\n\nAnd yet--that strange, wild face that had formed itself of Nick's fine\nfeatures, and the terrible red eyes! Were they elements in a picture\nconjured out of her own imagination? They must be, of course. She had\nbeen frightened by that hairbreadth escape, and had seen things that\ndidn't exist. And the rest of it--well, that might be natural enough.\nStill, there was something--she knew that; Nick had admitted it.\n\nHorker's words concerning Nick's father rose in her mind. Suspected\nof being crazy! Was that it? Was that the cause of Nick's curious\nreluctance where she was concerned? Was the face that had glared\nat her the visage of a maniac? It couldn't be. It couldn't be, she\ntold herself fiercely. Not her fine, tender, sensitive Nick! And\nbesides, that face, if she hadn't imagined it, had been the face, not\nof a lunatic, but of a devil. She shook her head, as if to deny her\nthoughts, and placed her hand impulsively on Nick's.\n\n\"I don't care,\" she said. \"I love you, Nick.\"\n\n\"And I you,\" he murmured. \"Pat, I'm sorry about spoiling this evening.\nI'm sorry and ashamed.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Honey. There'll be others.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"Mother and I are going out to dinner. And Friday we're\nhaving company.\"\n\n\"Really, Pat? You're not just trying to turn me off gently.\"\n\n\"Really, Nick. Try asking me for Saturday evening and see!\"\n\n\"You're asked, then.\"\n\n\"And it's a date.\" Then, with a return of her usual insouciance, she\nadded. \"If you're on good behavior.\"\n\n\"I will be. I promise.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Pat. An inexplicable sense of foreboding had come\nover her; despite her self-given assurances, something unnameable\ntroubled her. She gave a mental shrug, and deliberately relegated the\nunpleasant cogitations to oblivion.\n\nThe car turned into Dempster Road; the lights of the teeming\nroadhouses, dance halls, road-side hamburger and barbecue stands\nflashed by. There were many cars here; there was no longer any\nimpression of solitude now, in the overflow from the vast city in\nwhose shadow they moved. The incessant flow of traffic gave the girl\na feeling of security; these were tangible things about her, and once\nmore the memory of that disturbing occurrence became dim and dreamlike.\nThis was Nick beside her, gentle, intelligent, kind; had he ever been\notherwise? It seemed highly unreasonable, a fantasy of fear and the\nhysteria of the moment.\n\n\"Hungry?\" asked Nick unexpectedly.\n\n\"I could use a barbecue, I guess. Beef.\"\n\nThe car veered to the graveled area before a brightly lit stand. Nick\ngave the order to an attendant. He chuckled as Pat, with the digestive\ndisregard of youth attacked the greasy combination.\n\n\"That's like a humming bird eating hay!\" he said. \"Or better, like a\nleprechaun eating that horse-meat they can for dogs.\"\n\n\"You might as well discover that I don't live on honey and\nrose-petals,\" said Pat. \"Not even on caviar and terrapin--at least, not\nexclusively. I leave the dainty palate for Mother to indulge.\"\n\n\"Which is just as well. Hamburger and barbecue are more easily\nbudgeted.\"\n\n\"Nicholas,\" said the girl, tossing the paper napkin out of the car\nwindow, \"is that an indirect and very evasive proposal of marriage?\"\n\n\"You know it could be, if you wished it!\"\n\n\"And do I?\" she said, assuming a pensive air. \"I wonder. Suppose we say\nI'll let you know later.\"\n\n\"And meanwhile?\"\n\n\"Oh, meanwhile we can be sort of engaged. Just the way we've been.\"\n\n\"You're sweet, Pat,\" he murmured, as the car edged into the line of\ntraffic. \"I don't know just how to convey my appreciation, but it's\nthere!\"\n\nThe buildings drew more closely together; the road was suddenly a\nlighted street, and then, almost without realizing it, they were before\nPat's home. Nick walked beside her to the door; he stood facing her\nhesitantly.\n\n\"Good night, Pat,\" he said huskily. He leaned down, kissing her very\ngently, turned, and departed.\n\nThe girl watched him from the open doorway, following the lights of\nhis car until they vanished down the street. Dear, sweet Nick! Then\nthe disturbing memory of that occurrence of the evening returned; she\nfrowned in perplexity as the thought rose. That was all of a piece with\nthe puzzling character of him, and the curious veiled references he'd\nmade. References to what? She didn't know, couldn't imagine. Nick had\nsaid he didn't know either, which added still another quirk to the maze.\n\nShe thought of Dr. Horker's words. With the thought, she glanced at his\nhouse, adjacent to her own home. A light gleamed in the library; he\nwas still awake. She closed the door behind her, and darted across the\nnarrow strip of lawn to his porch. She rang the bell.\n\n\"Good evening, Dr. Carl,\" she said as the massive form of Horker\nappeared. She puckered her lips impudently at him as she slipped by him\ninto the house.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\nA Question of Science\n\n\n\"Not that I'm displeased at this visit, Pat,\" rumbled the Doctor,\nseating himself in one of the great chairs by the fireplace, \"but I'm\ncurious. I thought you were dating your ideal tonight, yet here you\nare, back alone a little after eleven. How come?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the girl nonchalantly, dropping crosswise in the other\nchair, \"we decided we needed our beauty sleep.\"\n\n\"Then why are you here, you young imp?\"\n\n\"Thought you might be lonesome.\"\n\n\"I'll bet you did! But seriously, Pat, what is it? Any trouble?\"\n\n\"No-o,\" she said dubiously. \"No trouble. I just wanted to ask you a few\nhypothetical questions. About science.\"\n\n\"Go to it, then, and quickly. I was ready to turn in.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Pat, \"about Nick's father. He was a doctor, you said, and\nsupposed to be cracked. Was he really?\"\n\n\"Humph! That's curious. I just looked up a brochure of his tonight in\nthe American Medical Journal, after our conversation of this afternoon.\nWhy do you ask that?\"\n\n\"Because I'm interested, of course.\"\n\n\"Well, here's what I remember about him, Pat. He was an M.D., all\nright, but I see by his paper there--the one I was reading--that he was\non the staff of Northern U. He did some work at the Cook County Asylum,\nsome research work, and there was a bit of talk about his maltreating\nthe patients. Then, on top of that, he published a paper that medical\nmen considered crazy, and that started talk of his sanity. That's all I\nknow.\"\n\n\"Then Nick--.\"\n\n\"I thought so! So it's come to the point where you're investigating his\nantecedents, eh? With an eye to marriage, or what?\"\n\n\"Or what!\" snapped Pat. \"I was curious to know, naturally.\"\n\n\"Naturally.\" The Doctor gave her a keen glance from his shrewd eyes.\n\"Did you think you detected incipient dementia in your ideal?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the girl thoughtfully. \"Dr. Carl, is there any sort\nof craziness that could take an ordinarily shy person and make a\npassionate devil of him? I don't mean passionate, either,\" she added.\n\"Rather cold, ruthless, domineering.\"\n\n\"None that I know of,\" said Horker, watching her closely. \"Did this\nNick of yours have one of his masterful moments?\"\n\n\"Worse than that,\" admitted Pat reluctantly. \"We had a near accident,\nand it startled both of us, and then suddenly, he was looking at me\nlike a devil, and then--\" She paused. \"It frightened me a little.\"\n\n\"What'd he do?\" demanded Horker sharply.\n\n\"Nothing.\" She lied with no hesitation.\n\n\"Were there any signs of Satyromania?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I never heard of that.\"\n\n\"I mean, in plain Americanese, did he make a pass at you?\"\n\n\"He--no, he didn't.\"\n\n\"Well, what _did_ he do?\"\n\n\"He just looked at me.\" Somehow a feeling of disloyalty was rising in\nher; she felt a reluctance to betray Nick further.\n\n\"What did he say, then? And don't lie this time.\"\n\n\"He just said--He just looked at my legs and said something about their\nbeing beautiful, and that was all. After that, the look on his face\nfaded into the old Nick.\"\n\n\"Old Nick is right--the impudent scoundrel!\" Horker's voice rumbled\nangrily.\n\n\"Well, they're nice legs,\" said Pat defiantly, swinging them as\nevidence. \"You've said it yourself. Why shouldn't _he_ say it? What's\nto keep him from it?\"\n\n\"The code of a gentleman, for one thing!\"\n\n\"Oh, who cares for your Victorian codes! Anyway, I came here for\ninformation, not to be cross-examined. I want to ask the questions\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Pat, you're a reckless little spit-fire, and you're going to get\nburned some day, and deserve it,\" the Doctor rumbled ominously. \"Ask\nyour fool questions, and then I'll ask mine.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the girl, still defiant. \"I don't guarantee to answer\nyours, however.\"\n\n\"Well, ask yours, you imp!\"\n\n\"First, then--Is that Satyro-stuff you mentioned intermittent or\ncontinuous?\"\n\n\"It's necessarily intermittent, you numb-skull! The male organism can't\nfunction continuously!\"\n\n\"I mean, does the mania lie dormant for weeks or months, and then flare\nup?\"\n\n\"Not at all. It's a permanent mania, like any other psychopathic sex\ncondition.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Pat thoughtfully, with a sense of relief.\n\n\"Well, go on. What next?\"\n\n\"What are these dual personalities you read about in the papers?\"\n\n\"They're aphasias. An individual forgets his name, and he picks, or is\ngiven, another, if he happens to wander among strangers. He forgets\nmuch of his past experience; the second personality is merely what's\nleft of the first--sort of a vestige of his normal character. There\nisn't any such thing as a dual personality in the sense of two distinct\ncharacters living in one body.\"\n\n\"Isn't there?\" queried the girl musingly. \"Could the second personality\nhave qualities that the first one lacked?\"\n\n\"Not any more than it could have an extra finger! The second is merely\na split off the first, a forgetfulness, a loss of memory. It couldn't\nhave _more_ qualities than the whole, or normal, character; it _must_\nhave fewer.\"\n\n\"Isn't that just too interesting!\" said Pat in a bantering tone. \"All\nright, Dr. Carl. It's your turn.\"\n\n\"Then what's the reason for all this curiosity about perversions and\naphasias? What's happened to your genius now?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm thinking of taking up the study of psychiatry,\" replied the\ngirl cheerfully.\n\n\"Aren't you going to answer me seriously?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then what's the use of my asking questions?\"\n\n\"I know the right answer to that one. None!\"\n\n\"Pat,\" said Horker in a low voice, \"you're an impudent little hoyden,\nand too clever for your own good, but you and your mother are very\nprecious to me. You know that.\"\n\n\"Of course I do, Dr. Carl,\" said the girl, relenting. \"You're a dear,\nand I'm crazy about you, and you know that, too.\"\n\n\"What I'm trying to say,\" proceeded the other, \"is simply that I'm\ntrying to help you. I want to help you, if you need help. Do you?\"\n\n\"I guess I don't, Dr. Carl, but you're sweet.\"\n\n\"Are you in love with this Nicholas Devine?\"\n\n\"I think perhaps I am,\" she admitted softly.\n\n\"And is he in love with you?\"\n\n\"Frankly, could he help being?\"\n\n\"Then there's something about him that worries you. That's it, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"I thought there was, Dr. Carl. I was a little startled by the change\nin him right after we had that narrow escape, but I'm sure it was\nnothing--just imagination. Honestly, that's all that troubled me.\"\n\n\"I believe you, Pat,\" said the Doctor, his eyes fixed on hers. \"But\nguard yourself, my dear. Be sure he's what you think he is; be sure you\nknow him rightly.\"\n\n\"He's clean and fine,\" murmured the girl. \"I _am_ sure.\"\n\n\"But this puzzling yourself about his character, Pat--I don't like it.\nMake doubly sure before you permit your feelings to become too deeply\ninvolved. That's only common sense, child, not psychiatry or magic.\"\n\n\"I'm sure,\" repeated Pat. \"I'm not puzzled or troubled any more. And\nthanks, Dr. Carl. You run along to bed and I'll do likewise.\"\n\nHe rose, accompanying her to the door, his face unusually grave.\n\n\"Patricia,\" he said, \"I want you to think over what I've said. Be\nsure, be doubly sure, before you expose yourself to the possibility of\nsuffering. Remember that, won't you?\"\n\n\"I'll try to. Don't fret yourself about it, Dr. Carl; I'm a hard-boiled\nyoung modern, and it takes a diamond to even scratch me.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" he said soberly. \"Run along; I'll watch until you're\ninside.\"\n\nPat darted across the strip of grass, turned at her door to blow a\ngoodnight kiss to the Doctor, and slipped in. She tiptoed quietly to\nher room, slipped off her dress, and surveyed her long, slim legs in\nthe mirror.\n\n\"Why shouldn't he say they were beautiful?\" she queried of the image.\n\"I can't see any reason to get excited over a simple compliment like\nthat.\"\n\nShe made a face over her shoulder at the green Buddha above the\nfireplace.\n\n\"And as for you, fat boy,\" she murmured, \"I expect to see you wink at\nme tonight. And every night hereafter!\"\n\nShe prepared herself for slumber, slipped into the great bed. She had\nhardly closed her lids before the image of a leering face with terrible\nbloody eyes flamed out of memory and set her trembling and shuddering.\n\n\n\n\n7\n\nThe Red Eyes Return\n\n\n\"I suppose I really ought to meet your friends, Patricia,\" said Mrs.\nLane, peering out of the window, \"but they all seem to call when I'm\nnot at home.\"\n\n\"I'll have some of them call in February,\" said Pat. \"You're not out as\noften in February.\"\n\n\"Why do you say I'm not out as often in February?\" demanded her mother.\n\"I don't see what earthly difference the month makes.\"\n\n\"There are fewer days in February,\" retorted Pat airily.\n\n\"Facetious brat!\"\n\n\"So I've been told. You needn't worry, though, Mother; I'm sober,\nsteady, and reliable, and if I weren't, Dr. Carl would see to it that\nmy associates were.\"\n\n\"Yes; Carl is a gem,\" observed her mother. \"By the way, who's this\nNicholas you're so enthusiastic about?\"\n\n\"He's a boy I met.\"\n\n\"What's he like?\"\n\n\"Well, he speaks English and wears a hat.\"\n\n\"Imp! Is he nice?\"\n\n\"That means is his family acceptable, doesn't it? He hasn't any family.\"\n\nMrs. Lane shrugged her attractive shoulders. \"You're a self-reliant\nsort, Patricia, and cool as iced lettuce, like your father. I don't\ndoubt that you can manage your own affairs, and here comes Claude with\nthe car.\" She gave the girl a hasty kiss. \"Good-bye, and have a good\ntime, as I'm sure I shan't with Bret Cutter in the game.\"\n\nPat watched her mother's trim, amazingly youthful figure as she entered\nthe car. More like a companion than a parent, she mused; she liked the\nindependence her mother's attitude permitted her.\n\n\"Better than being watched like a prize-winning puppy,\" she thought.\n\"Maybe Dr. Carl as a father would have a detriment or two along with\nthe advantages. He's a dear, and I'm mad about him, but he does lean to\nthe nineteenth century as far as parental duties are concerned.\"\n\nShe saw Nick's car draw to the curb; as he emerged she waved from the\nwindow and skipped into the hall. She caught up her wrap and bounded\nout to meet him just ascending the steps.\n\n\"Let's go!\" she greeted him. She cast an apprehensive glance at his\nfeatures, but there was nothing disturbing about him. He gave her a\ndiffident smile, the shy, gentle smile that had taken her in that first\nmoment of meeting. This was certainly no one but her own Nick, with no\ntrace of the unsettling personality of their last encounter.\n\nHe helped her into the car, seating himself at her side. He leaned over\nher, kissing her very tenderly; suddenly she was clinging to him, her\nface against the thrilling warmth of his cheek.\n\n\"Nick!\" she murmured. \"Nick! You're just safely you, aren't you? I've\nbeen imagining things that I knew couldn't be so!\"\n\nHe slipped his arm caressingly about her, and the pressure of it was\nlike the security of encircling battlements. The world was outside\nthe circle of his arms; she was within, safe, inviolable. It was some\nmoments before she stirred, lifting her pert face with tear-bright eyes\nfrom the obscurity of his shoulder.\n\n\"So!\" she exclaimed, patting the black glow of her hair into composure.\n\"I feel better, Nick, and I hope you didn't mind.\"\n\n\"Mind!\" he ejaculated. \"If you mean that as a joke, Honey, it's far too\nsubtle for me.\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't think you'd mind,\" said Pat demurely, settling herself\nbeside him. \"Let's be moving, then; Dr. Carl is nearly popping his eyes\nout in the window there.\"\n\nThe car hummed into motion; she waved a derisive arm at the Doctor's\nwindow by way of indicating her knowledge of his surveillance. \"Ought\nto teach him a lesson some time,\" she thought. \"One of these fine\nevenings I'll give him a real shock.\"\n\n\"Where'll we go?\" queried Nick, veering skilfully into the swift\ntraffic of Sheridan Road.\n\n\"Anywhere!\" she said blithely. \"Who cares as long as we go together?\"\n\n\"Dancing?\"\n\n\"Why not? Know a good place?\"\n\n\"No.\" He frowned in thought. \"I haven't indulged much.\"\n\n\"The Picador?\" she suggested. \"The music's good, and it's not too\nexpensive. But it's 'most across town, and besides, Saturday nights\nwe'd be sure to run into some of the crowd.\"\n\n\"What of it?\"\n\n\"I want to dance with you, Nick--all evening. I want to be without\ndistractions.\"\n\n\"Pat, dear! I could kiss you for that.\"\n\n\"You will,\" she murmured softly.\n\nThey moved aimlessly south with the traffic, pausing momentarily at the\nlight-controlled intersections, then whirring again to rapid motion.\nThe girl leaned against his arm silently, contentedly; block after\nblock dropped behind.\n\n\"Why so pensive, Honey?\" he asked after an interval. \"I've never known\nyou so quiet before.\"\n\n\"I'm enjoying my happiness, Nick.\"\n\n\"Aren't you usually happy?\"\n\n\"Of course, only these last two or three days, ever since our last\ndate, I've been making myself miserable. I've been telling myself\nfoolish things, impossible things, and it's only now that I've thrown\noff the blues. I'm happy, Dear!\"\n\n\"I'm glad you are,\" he said. His voice was strangely husky, and he\nstared fixedly at the street rushing toward them. \"I'm glad you are,\"\nhe repeated, a curious tensity in his tones.\n\n\"So'm I.\"\n\n\"I'll never do anything to make you unhappy, Pat--never. Not--if I can\nhelp it.\"\n\n\"You can help it, Nick. You're the one making me happy; please keep\ndoing it.\"\n\n\"I--hope to.\" There was a queer catch in his voice. It was almost as if\nhe feared something.\n\n\"Selah!\" said Pat conclusively. She was thinking, \"Wrong of me to refer\nto that accident. After all it was harmless; just a natural burst of\npassion. Might happen to anyone.\"\n\n\"Where'll we go?\" asked Nick as they swung into the tree-shadowed road\nof Lincoln Park. \"We haven't decided that.\"\n\n\"Anywhere,\" said the girl dreamily. \"Just drive; we'll find a place.\"\n\n\"You must know lots of them.\"\n\n\"We'll find a new place; we'll discover it for ourselves. It'll mean\nmore, doing that, than if we just go to one of the old places where\nI've been with every boy that ever dated me. You don't want me dancing\nwith a crowd of memories, do you?\"\n\n\"I shouldn't mind as long as they stayed merely memories.\"\n\n\"Well, I should! This evening's to be ours--exclusively ours.\"\n\n\"As if it could ever be otherwise!\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Pat. \"And how do you know what memories I might choose\nto carry along? Are you capable of inspecting my mental baggage?\"\n\n\"We'll check it at the door. You're traveling light tonight, aren't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Pest!\" she said, giving his cheek an impudent vicious pinch. \"Nice,\npleasurable pest!\"\n\nHe made no answer. The car was idling rather slowly along Michigan\nBoulevard; half a block ahead glowed the green of a traffic light.\nFaster traffic flowed around them, passing them like water eddying\nabout a slow floating branch.\n\nSuddenly the car lurched forward. The amber flame of the warning light\nhad flared out; they flashed across the intersection a split second\nbefore the metallic click of the red light, and a scant few feet before\nthe converging lines of traffic from the side street swept in with\nprotesting horns.\n\n\"Nick!\" the girl gasped. \"You'll rate yourself a traffic ticket! Why'd\nyou cut the light like that?\"\n\n\"To lose your guardian angel,\" he muttered in tones so low she barely\nunderstood his words.\n\nPat glanced back; the lights of a dozen cars showed beyond the barrier\nof the red signal.\n\n\"Do you mean one of those cars was following us? What on earth makes\nyou think that, and why should it, anyway?\"\n\nThe other made no answer; he swerved the car abruptly off the avenue,\ninto one of the nondescript side streets. He drove swiftly to the\ncorner, turned south again, and turned again on some street Pat failed\nto identify--South Superior or Grand, she thought. They were scarcely\na block from the magnificence of Michigan Avenue and its skyscrapers,\nits brilliant lights, and its teeming night traffic, yet here they\nmoved down a deserted dark thoroughfare, a street lined with ramshackle\nwooden houses intermingled with mean little shops.\n\n\"Nick!\" Pat exclaimed. \"Where are we going?\"\n\nThe low voice sounded. \"Dancing,\" he said.\n\nHe brought the car to the curb; in the silence as the motor died, the\nfaint strains of a mechanical piano sounded. He opened the car door,\nstepped around to the sidewalk.\n\n\"We're here,\" he said.\n\nSomething metallic in his tone drew Pat's eyes to his face. The eyes\nthat returned her stare were the bloody orbs of the demon of last\nWednesday night!\n\n\n\n\n8\n\nGateway to Evil\n\n\nPat stared curiously at the apparition but made no move to alight from\nthe vehicle. She was conscious of no fear, only a sense of wonder\nand perplexity. After all, this was merely Nick, her own harmless,\nadoring Nick, in some sort of mysterious masquerade, and she felt full\nconfidence in her ability to handle him under any circumstances.\n\n\"Where's here?\" she said, remaining motionless in her place.\n\n\"A place to dance,\" came the toneless reply.\n\nPat eyed him; a street car rumbled past, and the brief glow from its\nlighted windows swept over his face. Suddenly the visage was that\nof Nick; the crimson glare of the eyes was imperceptible, and the\nfeatures were the well-known appurtenances of Nicholas Devine, but\nqueerly tensed and strained.\n\n\"A trick of the light,\" she thought, as the street car lumbered away,\nand again a faint gleam of crimson appeared. She gazed curiously at the\nyouth, who stood impassively returning her survey as he held the door\nof the car. But the face was the face of Nick, she perceived, probably\nin one of his grim moods.\n\nShe transferred her glance to the building opposite which they had\nstopped. The strains of the mechanical piano had ceased; blank,\nshaded windows faced them, around whose edges glowed a subdued light\nfrom within. A drab, battered, paintless shack, she thought, dismal\nand unpleasant; while she gazed, the sound of the discordant music\nrecommenced, adding, it seemed, the last unprepossessing item.\n\n\"It doesn't look very attractive, Nick,\" she observed dubiously.\n\n\"I find it so, however.\"\n\n\"Then you've been here?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But I thought you said you didn't know any place to go.\"\n\n\"This one hadn't occurred to me--then.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said crisply, \"I could have done as well as this with my\neyes closed. It doesn't appeal to me at all, Nick.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, here's where we'll go. You're apt to find\nit--interesting.\"\n\n\"Look here, Nicholas Devine!\" Pat snapped, \"What makes you think you\ncan bully me? No one has ever succeeded yet!\"\n\n\"I said you'd find it interesting.\" His voice was unchanged; she stared\nat him in complete bafflement.\n\n\"Oh, Nick!\" she exclaimed in suddenly softer tones. \"What difference\ndoes it make? Didn't I say anywhere would do, so we went together?\" She\nsmiled at him. \"This will do if you wish, though really, Honey, I'd\nprefer not.\"\n\n\"I do wish it,\" the other said.\n\n\"All right, Honey,\" said Pat the faintest trace of reluctance in her\nvoice as she slipped from the car. \"I stick to my bargains.\"\n\nShe winced at the intensity of his grip as he took her arm to assist\nher. His fingers were like taunt wires biting into her flesh.\n\n\"Nick!\" she cried. \"You're hurting me! You're bruising my arm!\"\n\nHe released her; she rubbed the spot ruefully, then followed him to the\ndoor of the mysterious establishment. The unharmonious jangle of the\npiano dinned abruptly louder as he swung the door open. Pat entered and\nglanced around her at the room revealed.\n\nDull, smoky, dismal--not the least exciting or interesting as yet,\nshe thought. A short bar paralleled one wall, behind which lounged a\nlittle, thin, nondescript individual with a small mustache. Half a\ndozen tables filled the remainder of the room; four or five occupied\nby the clientele of the place, as unsavory a group as the girl could\nrecall having encountered on the hither side of the motion picture\nscreen. Two women tittered as Nick entered; then with one accord, the\neyes of the entire group fixed on Pat, where she stood drawing her wrap\nmore closely about her, standing uncomfortably behind her escort. And\nthe piano tinkled its discords in the far corner.\n\n\"Same place,\" said Nick shortly to the bartender, ignoring the glances\nof the others. Pat followed him across the room to a door, into a hall,\nthence into a smaller room furnished merely with a table and four\nchairs. The nondescript man stood waiting in the doorway as Nick took\nher wrap and seated her in one of the chairs.\n\n\"Quart,\" he said laconically, and the bartender disappeared.\n\nPat stared intently, studiously, into the face of her companion. Nick's\nface, certainly; here in full light there was no trace of the red-eyed\nhorror she had fancied out there in the semi-darkness of the street. Or\nwas there? Now--when he turned, when the light struck his eyes at an\nangle, was that a glint of crimson? Still, the features were Nick's,\nonly a certain grim intensity foreign to him lurked about the set of\nhis mouth, the narrowed eye-lids.\n\n\"Well!\" she said. \"So this is Paris! What are you trying to do--teach\nme capital L--life? And where do we dance?\"\n\n\"In here.\"\n\n\"And what kind of quart was that you ordered? You know how little I\ndrink, and I'm darned particular about even that little.\"\n\n\"You'll like this.\"\n\n\"I doubt it.\"\n\n\"I said you'll like it,\" he reiterated in flat tones.\n\n\"I heard you say it.\" She regarded him with a puzzled frown. \"Nick,\"\nshe said suddenly, \"I've decided I like you better in your gentle pose;\nthis masterful attitude isn't becoming, and you can forget what I said\nabout wishing you'd display it oftener.\"\n\n\"You'll like that, too.\"\n\n\"Again I doubt it. Nick, dear, don't spoil another evening like that\nlast one!\"\n\n\"This one won't be like the last one!\"\n\n\"But Honey--\" she paused at the entrance of the bartender bearing a\ntray, an opened bottle of ginger ale, two glasses of ice, and a flask\nof oily amber liquid. He deposited the assortment on the red-checked\ntable cloth.\n\n\"Two dollars,\" he said, pocketed the money and silently retired.\n\n\"Nicholas,\" said the girl tartly, \"there's enough of that poison for a\nregiment.\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't drink it, and I won't let you drink it! So now what?\"\n\n\"I think you'll do both.\"\n\n\"I don't!\" she snapped. \"And I don't like this, Nick--the place, or the\nliquor, or your attitude, or anything. We're going to leave!\"\n\nInstead of answering, he pulled the cork from the bottle, pouring a\nquantity of the amber fluid into each of the tumblers. To one he added\nan equal quantity of ginger ale, and set it deliberately squarely in\nfront of Pat. She frowned at it distastefully, and shook her head.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"Not I. I'm leaving.\"\n\nShe made no move, however; her eyes met those of her companion, gazing\nat her with a cold intentness in their curious amber depths. And\nagain--was that a flash of red? Impulsively she reached out her hand,\ntouched his.\n\n\"Oh, Nick!\" she said in soft, almost pleading tones. \"Please, Honey--I\ndon't understand you. Don't you know I love you, Nick? You can hear me\nsay it: I love you. Don't you believe that?\"\n\nHe continued his cold, intense stare; the grim set of his mouth was as\nunrelaxing as marble. Pat felt a shiver of apprehension run through\nher, and an almost hypnotic desire to yield herself to the demands of\nthe inexplicable eyes. She tore her glance away, looking down at the\nred checks of the table cloth.\n\n\"Nick, dear,\" she said. \"I can't understand this. Will you tell me what\nyou--will you tell me why we're here?\"\n\n\"It is out of your grasp.\"\n\n\"But--I know it has something to do with Wednesday night, something\nto do with that reluctance of yours, the thing you said you didn't\nunderstand. Hasn't it?\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"I do! And Nick, Honey--didn't I tell you I could\nforgive you anything? I don't care what's happened in the past; all I\ncare for is now, now and the future. Don't you understand me? I've told\nyou I loved you, Honey! Don't you love me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the other, staring at her with no change in the fixity of\nhis gaze.\n\n\"Then how can you--act like this to me?\"\n\n\"This is my conception of love.\"\n\n\"I don't understand!\" the girl said helplessly. \"I'm completely\npuzzled--it's all topsy-turvy.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said in impassive agreement.\n\n\"But what is this, Nick? Please, please--what is this? Are you mad?\"\nShe had almost added, \"Like your father.\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, still in those cold tones. \"This is an experiment.\"\n\n\"An experiment!\"\n\n\"Yes. An experiment in evil.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" she repeated.\n\n\"I said you wouldn't.\"\n\n\"Do you mean,\" she asked, struck by a sudden thought, \"that discussion\nof ours about pure horror? What you said that night last week?\"\n\n\"That!\" His voice was icy and contemptuous. \"That was the drivel of a\nweakling. No; I mean evil, not horror--the living evil that can be so\nbeautiful that one walks deliberately, with open eyes, into Hell only\nto prevent its loss. That is the experiment.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Pat, her own voice suddenly cool. \"Is that what you wish to\ndo--experiment on me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And what am I supposed to do?\"\n\n\"First you are to drink with me.\"\n\n\"I see,\" she said slowly. \"I see--dimly. I am a subject, a reagent,\na guinea pig, to provide you material for your writing. You propose\nto use me in this experiment of yours--this experiment in evil. All\nright!\" She picked up the tumbler; impulsively she drained it. The\nliquor, diluted as it was, was raw and strong enough to bring tears\nsmarting to her eyes. Or _was_ it the liquor?\n\n\"All right!\" she cried. \"I'll drink it all--the whole bottle!\" She\nseized the flask, filling her tumbler to the brim, while her companion\nwatched her with impassive gaze. \"You'll have your experiment! And\nthen, Nicholas Devine, we're through! Do you hear me? Through!\"\n\nShe caught up the tumbler, raised it to her lips, and drained the\nsearing liquid until she could see her companion's cold eyes regarding\nher through the glass of its bottom.\n\n\n\n\n9\n\nDescent into Avernus\n\n\nPat slammed the empty tumbler down on the checked table cloth and\nburied her face in her hands, choking and gasping from the effects\nof the fiery liquor. Her throat burned, her mouth was parched by the\nacrid taste, and a conflagration seemed to be raging somewhere within\nher. Then she steadied, raised her eyes, and stared straight into the\nstrange eyes of Nicholas Devine.\n\n\"Well?\" she said fiercely. \"Is that enough?\"\n\nHe was watching her coldly as an image or a painting; the intensity of\nhis gaze was more cat-like than human. She moved her head aside; his\neyes, without apparent shift, were still on hers, like the eyes of a\npictured face. A resurgence of anger shook her at his immobility; his\naloofness seemed to imply that nothing she could do would disturb him.\n\n\"Wasn't it enough?\" she screamed. \"Wasn't it? Then look!\"\n\nShe seized the bottle, poured another stream of the oily liquid\ninto her glass, and raised it to her lips. Again the burning fluid\nexcoriated her tongue and throat, and then suddenly, the tumbler was\nstruck from her hand, spilling the rest of its contents on the table.\n\n\"That is enough,\" said the icy voice of her companion.\n\n\"Oh, it is? We'll see!\" She snatched at the bottle, still more than\nhalf full. The thin hand of Nicholas Devine wrenched it violently away.\n\n\"Give me that!\" she cried. \"You wanted what you're getting!\" The warmth\nwithin her had reached the surface now; she felt flushed, excited,\nreckless, and desperately angry.\n\nThe other set the bottle deliberately on the floor; he rose, circled\nthe table, and stood glaring down at her with that same inexplicable\nexpression. Suddenly he raised his hand; twisting her black hair in\nhis fist, he dealt her a stinging blow across the lips half-opened to\nscream, then flung her away so violently that she nearly sprawled from\nher chair.\n\nThe scream died in her throat; dazed by the blow, she dropped her head\nto the table, while sobs of pain and fear shook her. Coherent thought\nhad departed, and she knew only that her lips stung, that her clear,\nactive little mind was caught in a mesh of befuddlement. She couldn't\nthink; she could only sob in the haze of dizziness that encompassed\nher. After a long interval, she raised her head, opened her eyes upon\na swaying, unsteady world, and faced her companion, who had silently\nresumed his seat.\n\n\"Nicholas Devine,\" she said slowly, speaking as if each word were an\neffort, \"I hate you!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he said and was again silent.\n\nShe forced her eyes to focus on his face, while his features danced\nvaguely as if smoke flowed between the two of them. It was as if there\nwere smoke in her mind as well; she made a great effort to rise above\nthe clouds that bemused her thoughts.\n\n\"Take me home,\" she said. \"Nicholas, I want to go home.\"\n\n\"Why should I?\" he asked impassively. \"The experiment is hardly begun.\"\n\n\"Experiment?\" she echoed dully. \"Oh, yes--experiment. I'm an\nexperiment.\"\n\n\"An experiment in evil,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes--in evil. And I hate you! That's evil enough, isn't it?\"\n\nHe reached down, lifted the bottle to the table, and methodically\npoured himself a drink of the liquor. He raised it, watching the oily\nswirls in the light, then tipped the fluid to his lips while the girl\ngazed at him with a sullen set to her own lips. A tiny crimson spot\nhad appeared in the corner of her mouth; at its sting, she raised her\nhand and brushed it away. She stared as if in unbelief at the small red\nsmear it left on her fingers.\n\n\"Nicholas,\" she said pleadingly, \"won't you take me home? Please,\nNicholas, I want to leave here.\"\n\n\"Do you hate me?\" he asked, a queer twisting smile appearing on his\nlips.\n\n\"If you'll take me home I won't,\" said Pat, snatching through the\nrising clouds of dizziness at a straw of logic. \"You're going to take\nme home, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Let me hear you say you hate me!\" he demanded, rising again. The girl\ncringed away with a little whimper as he approached. \"You hate me,\ndon't you?\"\n\nHe twisted his hand again in her ebony hair, drawing her face back so\nthat he stared down at it.\n\n\"There's blood on your lips,\" he said as if gloating. \"Blood on your\nlips!\"\n\nHe clutched her hair more tightly; abruptly he bent over her, pressing\nhis mouth to hers. Her bruised lips burned with pain at the fierce\npressure of his; she felt a sharp anguish at the impingement of his\nteeth. Yet the cloudy pall of dizziness about her was unbroken; she was\ntoo frightened and bewildered for resistance.\n\n\"Blood on your lips!\" he repeated exultingly. \"Now is the beauty of\nevil!\"\n\n\"Nicholas,\" she said wearily, clinging desperately to a remnant of\nlogic, \"what do you want of me? Tell me what you want and then let me\ngo home.\"\n\n\"I want to show you the face of evil,\" he said. \"I want you to know the\nglory of evil, the loveliness of supreme evil!\"\n\nHe dragged his chair around the table, placing it beside her. Seated,\nhe drew her into his arms, where she lay passive, too limp and\nbefuddled to resist. With a sudden movement, he turned her so that her\nback rested across his knees, her face gazing up into his. He stared\nintently down at her, and the light, shining at an angle into his eyes,\nsuddenly struck out the red glow that lingered in them.\n\n\"I want you to know the power of evil,\" he murmured. \"The irresistible,\nincomprehensible fascination of it, and the unspeakable pleasures of\nindulgence in it.\"\n\nPat scarcely heard him; she was struggling now in vain against the\noverwhelming fumes of the alcohol she had consumed. The room was\nwavering around her, and behind her despair and terror, a curious\nelation was thrusting itself into her consciousness.\n\n\"Evil,\" she echoed vaguely.\n\n\"Blood on your lips!\" he muttered, peering down at her. \"Taste the\nunutterable pleasure of kisses on bloody lips; drain the sweet anguish\nof pain, the fierce delight of suffering!\"\n\nHe bent down; again his lips pressed upon hers, but this time she felt\nherself responding. Some still sane portion of her brain rebelled,\nbut the intoxication of sense and alcohol was dominant. Suddenly she\nwas clinging to him, returning his kisses, glorying in the pain of her\nlacerated lips. A red mist suffused her; she had no consciousness of\nanything save the exquisite pain of the kiss, that somehow contrived\nto transform itself into an ecstacy of delight. She lay gasping as the\nother withdrew his lips.\n\n\"You see!\" he gloated. \"You understand! Evil is open to us, and all the\nunutterable pleasures of the damned, who cry out in transports of joy\nat the bite of the flames of Hell. Do you see?\"\n\nThe girl made no answer, sobbing in a chaotic mingling of pain and\nexcruciating pleasure. She was incapable of speech or connected\nthought; the alcohol beat against her brain with a persistence that\ndefied resistance. After a moment, she stirred, struggling erect to a\nsitting posture.\n\n\"Evil!\" she said dizzily. \"Evil and good--what's difference? All in a\nlifetime!\"\n\nShe felt a surge of tipsy elation, and then the muffled music of the\nmechanical piano, drifting through the closed door, penetrated her\nbefuddled consciousness.\n\n\"I want to dance!\" she cried. \"I'm drunk and I want to dance! Am I\ndrunk?\" she appealed to her companion.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"I am not! I just want to dance, only it's hot in here. Dance with me,\nNicholas--show me an evil dance! I want to dance with the Devil, and\nI will! You're the Devil, name and all! I want to dance with Old Nick\nhimself!\"\n\nShe rose unsteadily from her chair; instantly the room reeled crazily\nabout her and she fell sprawling. She felt the grasp of arms beneath\nher shoulders, raising her erect; she leaned against the wall and heard\nherself laughing wildly.\n\n\"Funny room!\" she said. \"Evil room--on pivots!\"\n\n\"You're still to learn,\" came the toneless voice of Nicholas Devine.\n\"Do you want to see the face of evil?\"\n\n\"Sure!\" she said. \"Got a good memory for faces!\"\n\nShe realized that he was fumbling with the catch of her dress on her\nleft shoulder; again some remnant, some vestige of sanity deep in her\nbrain warned her.\n\n\"Mustn't,\" she said vaguely.\n\nThen suddenly the catch was open; the dress dropped away around her,\ncrumpling to a shapeless blob of cloth about her diminutive feet. She\ncovered her face with her hands, fighting to hold that last, vanishing\nvestige of sobriety, while she stood swaying drunkenly against the wall.\n\nThen Nicholas Devine's arms were about her again; she felt the sharp\nsting of his kisses on her throat. He swung her about, bent her\nbackwards across the low table; she was conscious of a bewildered\nsensation of helplessness and of little else.\n\n\"Now the supreme glory of evil!\" he was muttering in her ear. She felt\nhis hands on her bare shoulders as he pressed her backward.\n\nThen, abruptly, he paused, releasing her. She sat dizzily erect,\nfollowing the direction of his gaze. In the half open door stood the\nnondescript bartender leering in at them.\n\n\n\n\n10\n\nRescue from Abaddon\n\n\nPat slid dizzily from her perch on the table and sank heavily to\na chair. The interruption of the mustached keeper of this den\nof contradictions struck her as extremely humorous; she giggled\nhysterically as her wavering gaze perceived the consternation in his\nsharp little face. Some forlorn shred of modesty asserted itself, and\nshe dragged a corner of the red-checked table cloth across her knees.\n\n\"Get out!\" said Nicholas Devine in that voice of rasping metal. \"Get\nout!\" he repeated in unchanging tones.\n\nThe other made no move to leave. \"Yeah?\" he said. \"Listen, Bud--this\nplace is respectable, see? You want to pull something like this, you go\nupstairs, see? And pay for your room.\"\n\n\"Get out!\" There was no variation in the voice.\n\n\"_You_ get out! The both of you, see?\"\n\nNicholas Devine stepped slowly toward him; his back, as he advanced\nupon the bartender, was toward Pat, yet through the haze of\nintoxication, she had an impression of evil red eyes in a chill,\nimpassive face. \"Get out!\"\n\nThe other had no stomach for such an adversary. He backed out of the\ndoor, closing it as he vanished. His voice floated in from the hall.\n\n\"I'm telling you!\" he called. \"Clear out!\"\n\nNicholas Devine turned back toward the girl. He surveyed her sitting in\nher chair; she had dropped her chin to her hand to steady the whirling\nof her head.\n\n\"We'll go,\" he said. \"Come on.\"\n\n\"I just want to sit here,\" she said. \"Just let me sit here. I'm tired.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" he repeated.\n\n\"Why?\" she muttered petulantly. \"I'm tired.\"\n\n\"I want no interruptions. We'll go elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Must dress!\" she murmured dazedly, \"can't go on street without dress.\"\n\nNicholas Devine swept her frock from its place in the corner, gathered\nher wrap from the chair, and flung them over his arm. He grasped her\nwrist, tugging her to an unsteady standing position.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said.\n\n\"Dress!\"\n\nHe snatched the red checked table cloth from its place, precipitating\nbottles, ash-tray, and glasses into an indiscriminate pile, and threw\nthe stained and odorous fabric across her shoulders. She gathered it\nabout her like a toga; it hung at most points barely below her waist,\nbut it satisfied the urge of her muddled mind for a covering of some\nsort.\n\n\"We'll go through the rear,\" her companion said. \"Into the alley. I\nwant no trouble with that rat in the bar--yet!\"\n\nHe still held Pat's wrist; she stumbled after him as he dragged her\ninto the darkness of the hall. They moved through it blindly to a door\nat the far end; Nicholas swung it open upon a dim corridor flanked by\nbuildings on either side, with a strip of star-sprinkled sky above.\n\nPat's legs were somehow incapable of their usual lithe grace; she\nfailed to negotiate the single step, and crashed heavily to the\nconcrete paving. The shock and the cooler air of the open steadied her\nmomentarily; she felt no pain from her bruised knees, but a temporary\nrift in the fog that bound her mind. She gathered the red-checked cloth\nmore closely about her shoulders as her companion, still clutching her\nwrist, jerked her violently to her feet.\n\nThey moved into the gulch of the alley, and here she found difficulty\nin following. Her tiny high-heeled pumps slipped at every step on\nthe uneven cobbles of the paving, and the unsteady footing made her\nlurch and stumble until the dusty stretch of the alley was a writhing\npanorama of shadows and lighted windows and stars. Nicholas Devine\nturned an impatient glare on her, and here in the semi-darkness, his\nface was again the face of the red-eyed demon. She dragged him to a\nhalt, laughing strangely.\n\n\"There it is!\" she cried, pointing at him with her free hand. He turned\nagain, staring at her with grim features.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"There! Your face--the face of evil!\" Again she laughed hysterically.\n\nThe other stepped to her side; the disturbing eyes were inches from\nher own. He raised his hand as she laughed, slapped her sharply, so\nthat her head reeled. He seized her shoulders, shaking her until the\ncheckered cloth billowed like a flag in a wind.\n\n\"Now come!\" he muttered.\n\nBut the girl, laughing no longer, leaned pale and weak against a\nlow board fence. Her limbs seemed paralyzed, and movement was quite\nimpossible. She was conscious of neither the blow nor the shaking, but\nonly of a devastating nausea and an all-encompassing weakness. She bent\nover the fence; she was violently ill.\n\nThen the nausea had vanished, and a weariness, a strange lassitude, was\nall that remained. Nicholas Devine stood over her; suddenly he pressed\nher body to him in a convulsive embrace, so that her head dropped back,\nand his face loomed above her, obliterating the stars.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said. He seemed about to kiss her when a\nsound--voices--filtered out of somewhere in the maze of dark courts\nand littered yards along the alley. He released her, seized her wrist,\nand once more she was stumbling wretchedly behind him over the uneven\nsurface of the cobblestones.\n\nA numbness had come over her; consciousness burned very low as she\nwavered doggedly along through the darkness. She perceived dimly that\nthey were approaching the end of the alley; the brighter glow of the\nstreet loomed before them, and a passing motor car cut momentary\nparallel shafts of luminescence across the opening.\n\nNicholas Devine slowed his pace, still clutching her wrist in a cold\ngrip; he paused, moving cautiously toward the corner of the building.\nHe peered around the edge of the structure, surveying the now deserted\nstreet, while Pat stood dully behind him, incapable alike of thought or\nvoluntary movement, clutching desperately at the dirty cloth that hung\nabout her shoulders.\n\nHer companion finished his survey; apparently satisfied that progress\nwas safe, he dragged her after him, turning toward the corner beyond\nwhich his car was parked. The girl staggered behind him with\ndiminishing vigor; consciousness was very nearly at the point of\ndisappearance, and her steps were wavering unsteadily, and doggedly\nslow. She dragged heavily on his arm; he gave a gesture of impatience\nat her weakness.\n\n\"Come on!\" he growled. \"We're just going to the corner.\" His voice rose\nslightly in pitch, still sounding harsh as rasping metals. \"There still\nremains the ultimate evil!\" he said. \"There is still a depth of beauty\nunplumbed, a pain whose exquisite pleasure is yet to find!\"\n\nThey approached the corner; abruptly Nicholas Devine drew back as two\nfigures came unexpectedly into view from beyond it. He turned back\ntoward the alley-way, dragging the girl in a dizzy circle. He took a\nfew rapid steps.\n\nBut Pat was through, exhausted. At his first step she stumbled and\nsprawled, dragging prone behind him. He released her hand and turned\ndefiantly to face the approaching men, while the girl lying on the\npavement struggled to a sitting posture with her back against the wall.\nShe turned dull, indifferent eyes on the scene, then was roused to a\nsomewhat higher pitch of interest by the sound of a familiar voice.\n\n\"There he is! I told you it was his car.\"\n\nDr. Horker! She struggled for clarity of thought; she realized dimly\nthat she ought to feel relief, happiness--but all she could summon\nwas a faint quickening of interest, or rather, a diminution of the\nlassitude that held her. She drew the rag of a table cloth about her\nand huddled against the wall, watching. The Doctor and some strange\nman, burly and massive in the darkness, dashed upon them, while\nNicholas Devine waited, his red-orbed face a demoniac picture of cold\ncontempt. Then the Doctor glanced at her huddled, bedraggled figure;\nshe saw his face aghast, incredulous, as he perceived the condition of\nher clothing.\n\n\"Pat! My God, girl! What's happened? Where've you been?\"\n\nShe found a hidden reserve somewhere within her. Her voice rose, shrill\nand hysterical.\n\n\"We've been in Hell!\" she said. \"You came to take me back, didn't you?\nOrpheus and Eurydice!\" She laughed. \"Dr. Orpheus Horker!\"\n\nThe Doctor flashed her another incredulous glance and a grim and very\nterrible expression flamed in his face. He turned toward Nicholas\nDevine, his hands clenching, his mouth twisting without utterance,\nwith no sound save a half-audible snarl. Then he spoke, a low, grating\nphrase flung at his thick-set companion.\n\n\"Bring the car,\" was all he said. The man lumbered away toward the\ncorner, and he turned again toward Nicholas Devine, who faced him\nimpassively. Suddenly his fist shot out; he struck the youth or demon\nsquarely between the red eyes, sending him reeling back against the\nbuilding. Then the Doctor turned, bending over Pat; she felt the\npressure of his arms beneath knees and shoulders. He was carrying her\ntoward a car that drew up at the curb; he was placing her gently in the\nback seat. Then, without a glance at the figure still leaning against\nthe building, he swept from the sidewalk the dark mass that was Pat's\ndress and her wrap, and re-entered the car beside her.\n\n\"Shall I turn him in?\" asked the man in the front seat.\n\n\"We can't afford the publicity,\" said the Doctor, adding grimly, \"I'll\nsettle with him later.\"\n\nPat's head lurched as the car started; she was losing consciousness,\nand realized it vaguely, but she retained one impression as the vehicle\nswung into motion. She perceived that the face of the lone figure\nleaning against the building, a face staring at her with horror and\nunbelief, was no longer the visage of the demon of the evening, but\nthat of her own Nick.\n\n\n\n\n11\n\nWreckage\n\n\nPat opened her eyes reluctantly, with the impression that something\nunpleasant awaited her return to full consciousness. Something, as yet\nshe could not recall just what, had happened to her; she was not even\nsure where she was awakening.\n\nHowever, her eyes surveyed her own familiar room; there opposite the\nbed grinned the jade Buddha on his stand on the mantel--the one that\nNick had--Nick! A mass of troubled, terrible recollections thrust\nthemselves suddenly into consciousness. She visioned a medley of\ndisturbing pictures, as yet disconnected, unassorted, but waiting only\nthe return of complete wakefulness. And she realized abruptly that her\nhead ached miserably, that her mouth was parched, that twinges of pain\nwere making themselves evident in various portions of her anatomy. She\nturned her head and caught a glimpse of a figure at the bed-side; her\nstartled glance revealed Dr. Horker, sitting quietly watching her.\n\n\"Hello, Doctor,\" she said, wincing as her smile brought a sharp pain\nfrom her lips. \"Or should I say, Good morning, Judge?\"\n\n\"Pat!\" he rumbled, his growling tones oddly gentle. \"Little Pat! How do\nyou feel, child?\"\n\n\"Fair,\" she said. \"Just fair. Dr. Carl, what happened to me last night?\nI can't seem to remember--Oh!\"\n\nA flash of recollection pierced the obscure muddle. She remembered\nnow--not all of the events of that ghastly evening, but enough. Too\nmuch!\n\n\"Oh!\" she murmured faintly. \"Oh, Dr. Carl!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he nodded. \"'Oh!'--and would you mind very much telling me what\nthat 'Oh' of yours implies?\"\n\n\"Why--\". She paused shuddering, as one by one the events of that\nsequence of horrors reassembled themselves. \"Yes, I'd mind very\nmuch,\" she continued. \"It was nothing--\" She turned to him abruptly.\n\"Oh, it was, though, Dr. Carl! It was horrible, unspeakable,\nincomprehensible!--But I can't talk about it! I can't!\"\n\n\"Perhaps you're right,\" said the Doctor mildly. \"Don't you really want\nto discuss it?\"\n\n\"I do want to,\" admitted the girl after a moment's reflection. \"I want\nto--but I can't. I'm afraid to think of all of it.\"\n\n\"But what in Heaven's name did you do?\"\n\n\"We just started out to go dancing,\" she said hesitatingly. \"Then, on\nthe way to town, Nick--changed. He said someone was following us.\"\n\n\"Some one was,\" said Horker. \"_I_ was, with Mueller. That Nick of yours\nhas the Devil's own cleverness!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the girl echoed soberly. \"The Devil's own!--Who's Mueller, Dr.\nCarl?\"\n\n\"He's a plain-clothes man, friend of mine. I treated him once. What do\nyou mean by changed?\"\n\n\"His eyes,\" she said. \"And his mouth. His eyes got reddish and\nterrible, and his mouth got straight and grim. And his voice turned\nsort of--harsh.\"\n\n\"Ever happen before, that you know of?\"\n\n\"Once. When--\" She paused.\n\n\"Yes. Last Wednesday night, when you came over to ask those questions\nabout pure science. What happened then?\"\n\n\"We went to a place to dance.\"\n\n\"And that's the reason, I suppose,\" rumbled the Doctor sardonically,\n\"that I found you wandering about the streets in a table cloth,\nstep-ins, and a pair of hose! That's why I found you on the verge of\npassing out from rotten liquor, and looking like the loser of a battle\nwith an airplane propellor! What happened to your face?\"\n\n\"My face? What's wrong with it?\"\n\nThe Doctor rose from his chair and seized the hand-mirror from her\ndressing table.\n\n\"Look at it!\" he commanded, passing her the glass.\n\nPat gazed incredulously at the reflection the surface presented; a dark\nbruise colored her cheek, her lips were swollen and discolored, and her\nchin bore a jagged scratch. She stared at the injuries in horror.\n\n\"Your knees are skinned, too,\" said Horker. \"Both of them.\"\n\nPat slipped one pajamaed limb from the covers, drawing the pants-leg up\nfor inspection. She gasped in startled fright at the great red stain on\nher knee.\n\n\"That's mercurochrome,\" said the Doctor. \"I put it there.\"\n\n\"_You_ put it there. How did I get home last night, Dr. Carl? How did I\nget to bed?\"\n\n\"I'm responsible for that, too. I put you to bed.\" He leaned forward.\n\"Listen, child--your mother knows nothing about this as yet. She wasn't\nhome when I brought you in, and she's not awake yet this morning.\nWe'll tell her you had an automobile accident; explain away those\nbruises.--And now, how did you get them?\"\n\n\"I fell, I guess. Two or three times.\"\n\n\"That bruise on your cheek isn't from falling.\"\n\nThe girl shuddered. Now in the calm light of morning, the events of\nlast night seemed doubly horrible; she doubted her ability to believe\nthem, so incredible did they seem. She was at a loss to explain even\nher own actions, and those of Nicholas Devine were simply beyond\ncomprehension, a chapter from some dark and blasphemous book of ancient\ntimes--the Kabbala or the Necronomicon.\n\n\"What happened, Pat?\" queried the Doctor gently. \"Tell me,\" he urged\nher.\n\n\"I--can't explain it,\" she said doubtfully. \"He took me to that place,\nbut drinking the liquor was my own fault. I did it out of spite because\nI saw he didn't--care for me. And then--\" She fell silent.\n\n\"Yes? And then?\"\n\n\"Well--he began to talk about the beauty of evil, the delights of evil,\nand his eyes glared at me, and--I don't understand it at all, Dr. Carl,\nbut all of a sudden I was--yielding. Do you see?\"\n\n\"I see,\" he said gently, soberly.\n\n\"Suddenly I seemed to comprehend what he meant--all that about the\nsupreme pleasure of evil. And I was sort of--swept away. The dress--was\nhis fault, but I--somehow I'd lost the power to resist. I guess I was\ndrunk.\"\n\n\"And the bruises? And your cut lips?\" queried the Doctor grimly.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said in a low voice. \"He--struck me. After a while I didn't\ncare. He could have--would have done other things, only we were\ninterrupted, and had to leave. And that's all, Dr. Carl.\"\n\n\"Isn't that enough?\" he groaned. \"Pat, I should have killed the fiend\nthere!\"\n\n\"I'm glad you didn't.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say you'd care?\"\n\n\"I--don't know.\"\n\n\"Are you intimating that you still love him?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said thoughtfully. \"No, I don't love him, but--Dr. Carl,\nthere's something inexplicable about this. There's something I don't\nunderstand, but I'm certain of one thing!\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"That it wasn't Nick--not _my_ Nick--who did those things to me last\nnight. It wasn't, Dr. Carl!\"\n\n\"Pat, you're being a fool!\"\n\n\"I know it. But I'm sure of it, Dr. Carl. I _know_ Nick; I loved him,\nand I know he couldn't have done--that. Not the same gentle Nick that I\nhad to beg to kiss me!\"\n\n\"Pat,\" said the Doctor gently, \"I'm a psychiatrist; it's my business\nto know all the rottenness that can hide in a human being. My office\nis the scene of a parade of misfits, failures, potential criminals,\nlunatics, and mental incompetents. It's a nasty, bitter side I see of\nlife, but I know that side--and I tell you this fellow is dangerous!\"\n\n\"Do you understand this, Dr. Carl?\"\n\nHe reached over, taking her hand in his great palm with its long,\ncurious delicate fingers. \"I have my theory, Pat. The man's a sadist,\na lover of cruelty, and there's enough masochism in any woman to make\nhim terribly dangerous. I want your promise.\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"I want you to promise never to see him again.\"\n\nThe girl turned serious eyes on his face; he noted with a shock of\nsympathy that they were filled with tears.\n\n\"You warned me I'd get burned playing with fire,\" she said. \"You did,\ndidn't you?\"\n\n\"I'm an old fool, Honey. If I'd believed my own advice, I'd have seen\nthat this never happened to you.\" He patted her hand. \"Have I your\npromise?\"\n\nShe averted her eyes. \"Yes,\" she murmured. He winced as he perceived\nthat the tears were on her cheeks.\n\n\"So!\" he said, rising. \"The patient can get out of bed when she feels\nlike it--and don't forget that little fib we've arranged for your\nmother's peace of mind.\"\n\nShe stared up at him, still clinging to his hand.\n\n\"Dr. Carl,\" she said, \"are you sure--quite sure--you're right about\nhim? Couldn't there be a chance that you're mistaken--that it's\nsomething your psychiatry has overlooked or never heard of?\"\n\n\"Small chance, Pat dear.\"\n\n\"But a chance?\"\n\n\"Well, neither I nor any reputable medic claims to know everything, and\nthe human mind's a subtle sort of thing.\"\n\n\n\n\n12\n\nLetter from Lucifer\n\n\n\"I'm glad!\" Pat told herself. \"I'm glad it's over, and I'm glad I\npromised Dr. Carl--I guess I was mighty close to the brink of disaster\nthat time.\"\n\nShe examined the injuries on her face, carefully powdered to conceal\nthe worst effects from her mother. The trick had worked, too; Mrs.\nLane had delivered herself of an excited lecture on the dangers of\nthe gasoline age, and then thanked Heaven it was no worse. Well, Pat\nreflected, she had good old Dr. Carl to thank for the success of the\nsubterfuge; he had broken the news very skillfully, set the stage for\nher appearance, and calmed her mother's apprehensions of scars. And\nPat, surveying her image in the glass above her dressing-table, could\nsee for herself the minor nature of the hurts.\n\n\"Scars--pooh!\" she observed. \"A bruised cheek, a split lip, a skinned\nchin. All I need is a black eye, and I guess I'd have had that in five\nminutes more, and perhaps a cauliflower ear into the bargain.\"\n\nBut her mood was anything but flippant; she was fighting off the time\nwhen her thoughts had of necessity to face the unpleasant, disturbing\nfacts of the affair. She didn't want to think of the thing at all;\nshe wanted to laugh it off and forget it, yet she knew that for an\nimpossibility. The very desire to forget she recognized as a coward's\nwish, and she resented the idea that she was cowardly.\n\n\"Forget the wise-cracks,\" she advised her image. \"Face the thing and\nargue it out; that's the only way to be satisfied.\"\n\nShe rose with a little grimace of pain at the twinge from her bruised\nknees, and crossed to the chaise lounge beside the far window. She\nsettled herself in it and resumed her cogitations. She was feeling more\nor less herself again; the headache of the morning had nearly vanished,\nand aside from the various aches and a listless fagged-out sensation,\nshe approximated her normal self. Physically, that is; the shadow of\nthat other catastrophe, the one she hesitated to face, was another\nmatter.\n\n\"I'm lucky to get off this easily,\" she assured herself, \"after going\non a bust like that one, like a lumberjack with his pay in his pocket.\"\nShe shook her head in mournful amazement. \"And I'm Patricia Lane, the\ngirl whom Billy dubbed 'Pat the Impeccable'! Impeccable! Wandering\nthrough alleys in step-ins and a table cloth--getting beaten up in a\ndrunken brawl--passing out on rot-gut liquor--being carried home and\nput to bed! Not impeccable; incapable's the word! I belong to Dr.\nCarl's parade of incompetents.\"\n\nShe continued her rueful reflections. \"Well, item one is, I don't love\nNick any more. I couldn't now!\" she flung at the smiling green buddha\non the mantel. \"That's over; I've promised.\"\n\nSomehow there was not satisfaction in the memory of that promise. It\nwas logical, of course; there wasn't anything else to do now, but\nstill--\n\n\"That _wasn't_ Nick!\" she told herself. \"That wasn't _my_ Nick. I guess\nDr. Carl is right, and he's a depressed what-ever-it-was; but if he's\ncrazy, so am I! He had me convinced last night; I understood what he\nmeant, and I felt what he wanted me to feel. If he's crazy, I am too; a\nfine couple we are!\"\n\nShe continued. \"But it wasn't Nick! I saw his face when we drove off,\nand it had changed again, and that was Nick's face, not the other. And\nhe was sorry; I could see he was sorry, and the other could never have\nregretted it--not ever! The other isn't--quite human, but Nick is.\"\n\nShe paused, considering the idea. \"Of course,\" she resumed, \"I might\nhave imagined that change at the end. I was hazy and quavery, and it's\nthe last thing I _do_ remember; that must have been just before I\npassed out.\"\n\nAnd then, replying to her own objection, \"But I _didn't_ imagine it! I\nsaw it happen once before, that other night when--Well, what difference\ndoes it make, anyway? It's over, and I've given my promise.\"\n\nBut she was unable to dismiss the matter as easily as that. There\nwas some uncanny, elusive element in it that fascinated her. Cruel,\nterrible, demoniac, he might have been; he had also been kind, lovable,\nand gentle. Yet Dr. Carl had told her that split personalities could\ncontain no characteristics that were not present in the original,\nnormal character. Was cruelty, then, a part of kindness? Was cruelty\nmerely the lack of kindness, or, cynical thought, was kindness but the\nlack of cruelty? Which qualities were positive in the antagonistic\nphases of Nicholas Devine's individuality, and which negative? Was the\ngentle, lovable, but indubitably weaker character the split, and the\ndemon of last evening his normal self? Or vice-versa? Or were both of\nthese fragmentary entities, portions of some greater personality as yet\nunapparent to her?\n\nThe whole matter was a mystery; she shrugged in helpless perplexity.\n\n\"I don't think Dr. Carl knows as much about it as he says,\" she mused.\n\"I don't think psychiatry or any other science knows that much about\nthe human soul. Dr. Carl doesn't even believe in a soul; how could he\nknow anything about it, then?\" She frowned in puzzlement and gave up\nthe attempt to solve the mystery.\n\nThe hours she had spent in her room, at her mother's insistence, began\nto pall; she didn't feel particularly ill--it was more of a languor, a\ndepressed, worn-out feeling. Her mother, of course, was out somewhere;\nshe felt a desire for human companionship, and wondered if the Doctor\nmight by some chance drop in. It seemed improbable; he had his regular\nSunday afternoon routine of golf at the Club, and it took a real\ncatastrophe to keep him away from that. She sighed, stretched her legs,\nrose from her position on the chaise lounge, and wandered toward the\nkitchen where Magda was doubtless to be found.\n\nIt was in the dusk of the rear hall that the first sense of her loss\ncame over her. Heretofore her renunciation of Nicholas Devine was a\nrational thing, a promise given but not felt; but now it was suddenly a\npoignant reality. Nick was gone, she realized; he was out of her world,\nirrevocably sundered from her. She paused at the top of the rear flight\nof stairs, considering the matter.\n\n\"He's gone! I won't see him ever again.\" The thought was appalling; she\nfelt already a premonition of loneliness to come, of an emptiness in\nher world, a lack that nothing could replace.\n\n\"I shouldn't have promised Dr. Carl,\" she mused, knowing that even\nwithout that promise her course must still have been the same. \"I\nshouldn't have, not until I'd talked to Nick--my own Nick.\"\n\nAnd still, she reflected forlornly, what difference did it make? She\nhad to give him up; she couldn't continue to see him not knowing at\nwhat instant that terrible caricature of him might appear to torment\nher. But he might have explained, she argued miserably, answering\nher own objection at once--he's said he couldn't explain, didn't\nunderstand. The thing was at an impasse.\n\nShe shook her shining black head despondently, and descended the dusky\nwell of the stairs to the kitchen. Magda was there clattering among her\npots and pans; Pat entered quietly and perched on the high stool by the\nlong table. Old Magda, who had warmed her babyhood milk and measured\nout her formula, gave her a single glance and continued her work.\n\n\"Sorry about the accident, I was,\" she said without looking up.\n\n\"Thanks,\" responded the girl. \"I'm all right again.\"\n\n\"You don't look it.\"\n\n\"I feel all right.\"\n\nShe watched the mysterious, alchemistic mixing of a pastry, and thought\nof the vast array of them that had come from Magda's hands. As far back\nas she could remember she had perched on this stool observing the same\nmystic culinary rites.\n\nSuddenly another memory rose out of the grave of forgetfulness and\nwent gibbering across her world. She remembered the stories Magda used\nto tell her, frightening stories of witchcraft and the evil eye, tales\nout of an older region and a more credulous age.\n\n\"Magda,\" she asked, \"did you ever see a devil?\"\n\n\"Not I, but I've talked with them that had.\"\n\n\"Didn't you ever see one?\"\n\n\"No.\" The woman slid a pan into the oven. \"I saw a man once, when I was\na tot, possessed by a devil.\"\n\n\"You did? How did he look?\"\n\n\"He screamed terrible, then he said queer things. Then he fell down and\nfoam came out of his mouth.\"\n\n\"Like a fit?\"\n\n\"The Priest, he said it was a devil. He came and prayed over him, and\nafter a while he was real quiet, and then he was all right.\"\n\n\"Possessed by a devil,\" said Pat thoughtfully. \"What happened to him?\"\n\n\"Dunno.\"\n\n\"What queer things did he say?\"\n\n\"Wicked things, the Priest said. I couldn't tell! I was a tot.\"\n\n\"Possessed by a devil!\" Pat repeated musingly. She sat immersed in\nthoughts on the high stool while Magda clattered busily about. The\nwoman paused finally, turning her face to the girl.\n\n\"What you so quiet about, Miss Pat?\"\n\n\"I was just thinking.\"\n\n\"You get your letter?\"\n\n\"Letter? What letter? Today's Sunday.\"\n\n\"Special delivery. The girl, she put it in the hall.\"\n\n\"I didn't know anything about it. Who'd write me a special?\"\n\nShe slipped off the high stool and proceeded to the front hall. The\nletter was there, solitary on the salver that always held the mail. She\npicked it up, examining the envelope in sudden startled amazement and\nmore than a trace of illogical exultation.\n\nFor the letter, post-marked that same morning, was addressed in the\nirregular script of Nicholas Devine!\n\n\n\n\n13\n\nIndecision\n\n\nPat turned the envelope dubiously in her hands, while a maze of chaotic\nthoughts assailed her. She felt almost a sensation of guilt as if\nshe were in some manner violating the promise given to Dr. Horker;\nshe felt a tinge of indignation that Nicholas Devine should dare\ncommunicate with her at all, and she felt too that queer exultation,\nan inexplicable pleasure, a feeling of secret triumph. She slipped the\nletter in the pocket of her robe and padded quietly up the stairs to\nher own room.\n\nStrangely, her loneliness had vanished. The great house, empty now\nsave for herself and Magda in the distant kitchen, was no longer a\nplace of solitude; the discovery of the letter, whatever its contents,\nhad changed the deserted rooms into chambers teeming with her own\nexcitements, trepidations, doubts, and hopes. Even hopes, she admitted\nto herself, though hopes of what nature she was quite unable to say.\nWhat _could_ Nick write that had the power to change things? Apologies?\nPleas? Promises? None of these could alter the naked, horrible facts of\nthe predicament.\n\nNevertheless, she was almost a-tremble with expectation as she skipped\nhastily into her own room, carefully closed the door, and settled\nherself by the west windows. She drew the letter from her pocket, and\nthen, with a tightening of her throat, tore open the envelope, slipping\nout the several pages of scrawled paper. Avidly she began to read.\n\n     \"I don't know whether you'll ever see this\"--the missive began\n     without salutation--\"and I'll not blame you, Pat dear, if you do\n     return it unopened. There's nothing you can do that wouldn't be\n     justified, nor can you think worse of me than I do of myself. And\n     that's a statement so meaningless that even as I wrote it, I could\n     anticipate its effect on you.\n\n     \"Pat--How am I going to convince you that I'm sincere? Will you\n     believe me when I write that I love you? Can you believe that I\n     love you tenderly, worshipfully--reverently?\n\n     \"You can't; I know you can't after that catastrophe of last night.\n     But it's true, Pat, though the logic of a Spinoza might fail to\n     convince you of it.\n\n     \"I don't know how to write you this. I don't know whether you want\n     to hear what I could say, but I know that I must try to say it.\n     Not apologies, Pat--I shouldn't dare approach you for so poor a\n     reason as that--but a sort of explanation. You more than any one\n     in the world are entitled to that explanation, if you want to hear\n     it.\n\n     \"I can't write it to you, Pat; it's something I can only make you\n     believe by telling you--something dark and rather terrible. But\n     please, Dear, believe that I mean you no harm, and that I plan no\n     subterfuge, when I suggest that you see me. It will be, I think,\n     for the last time.\n\n     \"Tonight, and tomorrow night, and as many nights to follow as I\n     can, I'll sit on a bench in the park near the place where I kissed\n     you that first time. There will be people passing there, and cars\n     driving by; you need fear nothing from me. I choose the place to\n     bridle my own actions, Pat; nothing can happen while we sit there\n     in the view of the world.\n\n     \"To write you more than this is futile. If you come, I'll be\n     there; if you don't, I'll understand.\n\n     \"I love you.\"\n\nThe letter was signed merely \"Nick.\" She stared at the signature with\nfeelings so confused that she forebore any attempt to analyze them.\n\n\"But I can't go,\" she mused soberly. \"I've promised Dr. Carl. Or at\nleast, I can't go without telling him.\"\n\nThat last thought, she realized, was a concession. Heretofore she\nhadn't let herself consider the possibility of seeing Nicholas Devine\nagain, and now suddenly she was weakening, arguing with herself about\nthe ethics of seeing him. She shook her head decisively.\n\n\"Won't do, Patricia Lane!\" she told herself. \"Next thing, you'll be\nslipping away without a word to anybody, and coming home with two black\neyes and a broken nose. Won't do at all!\"\n\nShe dropped her eyes to the letter. \"Explanations,\" she reflected. \"I\nguess Dr. Carl would give up a hole-in-one to hear that explanation.\nAnd I'd give more than that.\" She shook her head regretfully. \"Nothing\nto do about it, though. I promised.\"\n\nThe sun was slanting through the west windows; she sat watching the\nshadows lengthen in the room, and tried to turn her thoughts into more\nprofitable channels. This was the first Sunday in many months that\nshe had spent alone in the house; it was a custom for herself and her\nmother to spend the afternoon at the club. The evening too, as a rule;\nthere was invariably bridge for Mrs. Lane, and Pat was always the\ncenter of a circle of the younger members. She wondered dreamily what\nthe crowd thought of her non-appearance, reflecting that her mother\nhad doubtless enlarged on Dr. Carl's story of an accident. Dr. Carl\nwouldn't say much, simply that he'd ordered her to stay at home. But\nsooner or later, Nick would hear the accident story; she wondered what\nhe'd think of it.\n\nShe caught herself up sharply. \"My ideas wander in circles,\" she\nthought petulantly. \"No matter where I start, they curve around back to\nNick. It won't do; I've got to stop it.\"\n\nNearly time for the evening meal, she mused, watching the sun as it\ndropped behind Dr. Horker's house. She didn't feel much like eating;\nthere was still a remnant of the exhausted, dragged-out sensation,\nthough the headache that had accompanied her awakening this morning had\ndisappeared.\n\n\"I know what the morning after feels like, anyway,\" she reflected with\na wry little smile. \"Everybody ought to experience it once, I suppose.\nI wonder how Nick--\"\n\nShe broke off abruptly, with a shrug of disgust. She slipped the letter\nback into its envelope, rose and deposited it in the drawer of the\nnight-table. She glanced at the clock ticking on its shiny top.\n\n\"Six o'clock,\" she murmured. Nick would be sitting in the park in\nanother two hours or so. She had a twinge of sympathy at the thought of\nhis lone vigil; she could visualize the harried expression on his face\nwhen the hours passed without her arrival.\n\n\"Can't be helped,\" she told herself. \"He's no right to ask for\nanything of me after last night. He knows that; he said so in his\nletter.\"\n\nShe suppressed an impulse to re-read that letter, and trotted\ndeliberately out of the room and down the stairs. Magda had set the\ntable in the breakfast room; it was far cozier than the great dining\nroom, especially without her mother's company. And the maid was away;\nthe breakfast room simplified serving, as well.\n\nShe tried valorously to eat what Magda supplied, but the food failed\nto tempt her. It wasn't so much her physical condition, either; it\nwas--She clenched her jaws firmly; was the memory of Nicholas Devine to\nhaunt her forever?\n\n\"Pat Lane,\" she said in admonition, \"you're a crack-brained fool! Just\nbecause a man kicks you all over the place is no reason to let him\nbecome an obsession.\"\n\nShe drank her coffee, feeling the sting of its heat on her injured\nlips. She left the table, tramped firmly to her room, and began\ndefiantly to read. The effort was useless; half a dozen times she\nforced her attention to the page only to find herself staring vaguely\ninto space a moment or two later. She closed the book finally with an\nirritable bang, and vented her restlessness in pacing back and forth.\n\n\"This house is unbearable!\" she snapped. \"I'm not going to stay shut up\nhere like a jail-bird in solitary confinement. A walk in the open is\nwhat I need, and that's what I'll have.\"\n\nShe glanced at the clock; seven-thirty. She tore off her robe\npettishly, flung out of her pajamas, and began to dress with angry\ndetermination. She refused to think of a lonely figure that might even\nnow be sitting disconsolately on a bench in the near-by park.\n\nShe disguised her bruised cheek as best she could, dabbed a little\npowder on the abrasion on her chin, and tramped militantly down the\nstairs. She caught up her wrap, still lying where the Doctor had\ntossed it last night, and moved toward the door, opening it and nearly\ncolliding with the massive figure of Dr. Horker!\n\n\"Well!\" boomed the Doctor as she started back in surprise. \"You're\npretty spry for a patient. Think you were going out?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pat defiantly.\n\n\"Not tonight, child! I left the Club early to take a look at you.\"\n\n\"I am perfectly all right. I want to go for a walk.\"\n\n\"No walk. Doctor's orders.\"\n\n\"I'm of legal age!\" she snapped. \"I want to go for a walk. Do I go?\"\n\n\"You do not.\" The Doctor placed his great form squarely in the doorway.\n\"Not unless you can lick me, my girl, and I'm pretty tough. I put you\nto bed last night, and I can do as much tonight. Shall I?\"\n\nPat backed into the hall. \"You don't have to,\" she said sullenly. \"I'm\ngoing there myself.\" She flung her wrap angrily to a chair and stalked\nup the stairs.\n\n\"Good night, spit-fire,\" he called after her. \"I'll read down here\nuntil your mother comes home.\"\n\nThe girl stormed into her room in anger that she knew to be illogical.\n\n\"I won't be watched like a problem child!\" she told herself viciously.\n\"I know damn well what he thought--and I wasn't going to meet Nick! I\nwasn't at all!\"\n\nShe calmed suddenly, sat on the edge of her bed and kicked off her\npumps. It had occurred to her that Nick had written his intention to\nwait for her in the park tomorrow night as well, and Dr. Horker's\ninterference had confirmed her in a determination to meet him.\n\n\n\n\n14\n\nBizarre Explanation\n\n\n\"I won't be bullied!\" Pat told herself, examining her features in the\nmirror. The two day interval had faded the discoloration of her cheek\nto negligible proportions, and all that remained as evidence of the\nviolence of Saturday night was the diminishing mark on her chin. Of\ncourse, her knees--but they were covered; most of the time, at least.\nShe gave herself a final inspection, and somewhere below a clock boomed.\n\n\"Eight o'clock,\" she remarked to her image; \"Time to be leaving, and it\nserves Dr. Carl right for his high-handed actions last night. I won't\nbe bullied by anybody.\" She checked herself as her mind had almost\nadded, \"Except Nick.\" True or not, she didn't relish the thought; the\nrecent recollections it roused were too disturbing.\n\nShe tossed a stray wisp of black hair from her forehead and turned to\nthe door. She heard her mother's voice as she descended the stairs.\n\n\"Are you going out, Patricia? Do you think it wise?\"\n\n\"I am perfectly all right. I want to go for a walk.\"\n\n\"I know, Dear; it was largely your appearance I meant.\" She surveyed\nthe girl with a critical eye. \"Nice enough, except for that little spot\non your chin, and will you never learn to keep your hair away from that\nside of your forehead? One can never do a bob right; why don't you let\nit grow out like the other girls?\"\n\n\"Makes me individual,\" replied Pat, moving toward the outer door. \"I\nwon't be late at all,\" she added.\n\nOn the porch she cast a cautious glance at Dr. Horker's windows, but\nhis great figure was nowhere evident. Only a light burning in the\nlibrary evinced his presence. She gave a sigh of relief, and tiptoed\ndown the steps to the sidewalk, and moved hastily away from the range\nof his watchful eyes.\n\nNo sooner had she sighted the park than doubts began to torment her.\nSuppose this were some trick of Nicholas Devine's, to trap her into\nsome such situation as that of Saturday night. Even suppose that she\nfound him the sweet personality that she had loved, might that also\nbe a trick? Mightn't he be trusting to his ability to win her over, to\nthe charm she had confessed to him that he held for her? Couldn't he\nbe putting his faith in his own amorous skill, planning some specious\nexplanation to win her forgiveness only to use her once more as the\nmaterial for some horrible experiment? And if he were, would she be\nable to prevent herself from yielding?\n\n\"Forewarned is fore-armed,\" she told herself. \"I'll not put up such a\nfeeble resistance this time, knowing what I now know. And it's only\nfair of me to listen to his explanation, if he really has one.\"\n\nShe was reassured by the sight of the crowded park; groups strolled\nalong the walks, and an endless procession of car-headlights marked the\ncourse of the roadway. Nothing could happen in such an environment;\nthey'd be fortunate even to have an opportunity for confidential\ntalk. She waited for the traffic lights, straining her eyes to locate\nNicholas Devine; at the click of the signal she darted across the\nstreet.\n\nShe moved toward the lake; here was the spot, she was sure. She glanced\nabout with eagerness unexpected even to herself, peering through the\nshadow-shot dusk. He wasn't there, she concluded, with a curious sense\nof disappointment; her failure to appear last night had disheartened\nhim; he had abandoned his attempt.\n\nThen she saw him. He sat on a bench isolated from the rest in a\ntreeless area overlooking the lake. She saw his disconsolate figure,\nhis chin on his hand, staring moodily over the waters. A tremor ran\nthrough her, she halted deliberately, waiting until every trace of\nemotion had vanished, then she advanced, standing coolly beside him.\n\nFor a moment he was unaware of her presence; he sat maintaining his\ndejected attitude without glancing at her. Suddenly some slight\nmovement, the flutter of her skirt, drew his attention; he turned\nsharply, gazing directly into her face.\n\n\"Pat!\" He sprang to his feet. \"Pat! is it you--truly you? Or are you\none of these visions that have been plaguing me for hours?\"\n\n\"I'm real,\" she said, returning his gaze with a studied coolness in her\nface. She made no other move; her cold composure disconcerted him, and\nhe winced, flushed, and moved nervously aside as she seated herself. He\ndropped beside her; he made no attempt to touch her, but sat watching\nher in silence for so long a time that she felt her composure ebbing.\nThere was a hungry, defeated look about him; there was a wistfulness,\na frustration, in his eyes that seemed about to tug tears from her own\neyes. Abruptly she dropped her gaze from his face.\n\n\"Well?\" she said finally in a small voice, and as he made no reply,\n\"I'm here.\"\n\n\"Are you really, Pat? Are you truly here?\" he murmured, still watching\nher avidly. \"I--I still don't believe it. I waited here for hours and\nhours last night, and I'd given up hope for tonight, or any night. But\nI would have come again and again.\"\n\nShe started as he bent suddenly toward her, but he was merely examining\nher face. She saw the gleam of horror in his expression as his eyes\nsurveyed the faintly visible bruise on her cheek, the red mark on her\nchin.\n\n\"Oh my God, Pat!\" His words were barely audible. \"Oh my God!\" he\nrepeated, drawing away from her and resuming the attitude of desolation\nin which her arrival had found him. \"I've hoped it wasn't true!\"\n\n\"What wasn't?\" She was keeping her voice carefully casual; this\nmiserable contrition of Nick's was tugging at her rather too powerfully\nfor complete safety.\n\n\"What I remembered. What I saw just now.\"\n\n\"You hoped it wasn't true?\" she queried in surprise. \"But you did it.\"\n\n\"_I_ did it, Pat? Do you think _I_ could have done it?\"\n\n\"But you did!\" Her voice had taken on a chill inflection; the memory of\nthose indignities came to steel her against him.\n\n\"Pat, do you think I could assault your daintiness, or maltreat the\nbeauty I worship? Didn't anything occur to you? Didn't anything seem\nqueer about--about that ghastly evening?\"\n\n\"Queer!\" she echoed. \"That's certainly a mild word to use, isn't it?\"\n\n\"But I mean--hadn't you any idea of what had happened? Didn't you\nthink anything of it except that I had suddenly gone mad? Or that I'd\ngrown to hate you?\"\n\n\"What was I to think?\" she countered, trying to control the tremor that\nhad crept into her voice.\n\n\"But did you think that?\"\n\n\"No,\" the girl confessed after a pause. \"At first, when you started\nwith that drink, I thought you were looking for material for your work.\nThat's what you said--an experiment. Didn't you?\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" he groaned.\n\n\"But after that, after I'd swallowed that horrible stuff, but before\neverything went hazy, I--thought differently.\"\n\n\"But what, Pat? What did you think?\"\n\n\"Why, then I realized that it wasn't you--not the real you. I could\nfeel the--well, the presence of the person I knew; this presence\nthat was tormenting me was another person, a terrible, cold, inhuman\nstranger.\"\n\n\"Pat!\" There was a note almost of relief in his voice. \"Did you really\nfeel that?\"\n\n\"Yes. Does it help matters, my sensing that? I can't see how.\"\n\nHis eyes, which had been fixed on hers, dropped suddenly. \"No,\" he\nmuttered, all the relief gone out of his tones, \"no, it doesn't help,\ndoes it? Except that it's a meager consolation to me to know that you\nfelt it.\"\n\nPat struggled to suppress an impulse to reach out her hand, to stroke\nhis hair. She caught herself sharply; this was the very danger against\nwhich she had warned herself--this was the very attitude she had\nanticipated in Nicholas Devine, the lure which might bait a trap. Yet\nhe looked so forlorn, so wistful! It was an effort to forbear from\ntouching him; her fingers fairly ached to brush his cheek.\n\n\"Only a fool walks twice into the same trap,\" she told herself. Aloud\nshe said, \"You promised me an explanation. If you've any excuse, I'd\nlike to hear it.\" Her voice had resumed its coolness.\n\n\"I haven't any excuse,\" he responded gloomily, \"and the explanation is\nperhaps too bizarre, too fantastic for belief. _I_ don't believe it\nentirely; I suppose _you_ couldn't believe it at all.\"\n\n\"You promised,\" she repeated. The carefully assumed composure of her\nvoice threatened to crack; this wistfulness of his was a powerful\nweapon against her defense.\n\n\"Oh, I'll give you the explanation,\" he said miserably. \"I just wanted\nto warn you you'd not believe me.\" He gave her a despondent glance.\n\"Pat, as I love you I swear that what I tell you is the truth. Do you\nthink you can believe me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she murmured. The tremor had reappeared in her voice despite her\nefforts.\n\nNicholas Devine turned his eyes toward the lake and began to speak.\n\n\n\n\n15\n\nA Modern Mr. Hyde\n\n\n\"I don't remember when I first noticed it,\" began Nick in a low voice,\n\"but I'm two people. I'm me, the person who's talking to you now, and\nI'm--another.\"\n\nPat, looking very pale and serious in the dusky light, said nothing at\nall. She simply gazed at him silently, without the slightest trace of\nsurprise in her wide dark eyes.\n\n\"This is the real me,\" proceeded Nick miserably. \"The other is an\noutsider, that has somehow contrived to grow into me. He is different;\ncold, cruel, utterly selfish, and not exactly--human. Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Y--Yes,\" said the girl, fighting to control her voice. \"Sort of.\"\n\n\"This is a struggle that has continued for a long time,\" he pursued.\n\"There were times in childhood when I remember punishments for offenses\nI never committed, for nasty little meannesses _he_ perpetrated. My\nmother, and after her death, my tutoress, thought I was lying when I\ntried to explain; they thought I was trying to evade responsibility.\nAfter a while I learned not to explain; I learned to accept my\npunishments doggedly, and to fight this other when he sought dominance.\"\n\n\"And could you?\" asked Pat, her voice frankly quavery. \"Could you fight\nhim?\"\n\n\"I was the stronger; I could win--usually. He slipped into\nconsciousness as wilful, mean little impulses, nasty moods, unreasoning\nhates and such unpleasant things. But I was always the stronger: I\nlearned to drive him into the background.\"\n\n\"You said you _were_ the stronger,\" she mused. \"What does that mean,\nNick?\"\n\n\"I've always been the stronger; I am now. But recently, Pat--I think\nit's since I fell in love with you--the struggle has been on evener\nterms. I've weakened or he's gained. I have to guard against him\nconstantly; in any moment of weakness he may slip in, as on our ride\nlast week, when we had that near accident. And again Saturday.\" He\nturned appealing eyes on the girl. \"Pat, do you believe me?\"\n\n\"I guess I'll have to,\" she said unhappily. \"It--makes things rather\nhopeless, doesn't it?\"\n\nHe nodded dejectedly. \"Yes. I've always felt that sooner or later I'd\nwin, and drive him away permanently. I've felt on the verge of complete\nvictory more than once, but now--\" He shook his head doubtfully. \"He\nhad never dominated me so entirely until Saturday night--Pat, you\ndon't know what Hell is like until you're forced as I was to watch\nthe violation of the being you worship, to stand helpless while a\ndesecration is committed. I'd rather die than suffer it again!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the girl faintly. She was thinking of the sorry picture she\nmust have presented as she reeled half-clothed through the alley. \"Can\nyou see what--_he_ sees?\"\n\n\"Of course, and think his thoughts. But only when he's dominant. I\ndon't know what evil he's planning now, else I could forestall him, I\nwould have warned you if I could have known.\"\n\n\"Where is he now?\"\n\n\"Here,\" said Nick somberly. \"Here listening to us, knowing what I'm\nthinking and feeling, laughing at my unhappiness.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" gasped Pat again. She watched her companion doubtfully. Then the\nmemory of Dr. Horker's diagnosis came to her, and set her wondering.\nWas this story the figment of an unsettled mind? Was this irrational\ntale of a fiendish intruder merely evidence that the Doctor was right\nin his opinion? She was in a maze of uncertainty.\n\n\"Nick,\" she said, \"did you ever try medical help? Did you ever go to a\ndoctor about it?\"\n\n\"Of course, Pat! Two years ago I went to a famous psychiatrist in\nNew York--you'd know the name if I mentioned it--and told him about\nthe--the case. And he studied me, and he treated me, and psychoanalyzed\nme, and the net result was just nothing. And finally he dismissed\nme with the opinion that 'the whole thing is just a fixed delusion,\nfortunately harmless!' Harmless! Bah! But it wasn't I that did those\nthings, Pat; I had to stand by in horror and watch. It was enough to\n_drive_ me crazy, but it didn't--quite.\"\n\n\"But--Oh, Nick, what is it? What is this--this outsider? Can't we fight\nit somehow?\"\n\n\"How can anyone except me fight it?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know!\" she wailed miserably. \"There must be a way. Doctors\nclaim to know pretty nearly everything; there must be _something_ to\ndo.\"\n\n\"But there isn't,\" he retorted gloomily. \"I don't know any more than\nyou what that thing is, but it's beyond your doctors. I've got to fight\nit out alone.\"\n\n\"Nick--\" Her voice was suddenly tense. \"Are you sure it isn't some\nkind of madness? Something tangible like that could perhaps be treated.\"\n\n\"It's no kind your doctors can treat, Pat. Did you ever hear of a\nmadman who stood aside and rationally watched the working of his own\ninsanity? And that's what I'm forced to do. And yet--this other isn't\ninsane either. Were its actions insane?\"\n\nPat shuddered. \"I--don't know,\" she said in low tones. \"I guess not.\"\n\n\"No. Horrible, cruel, bestial, devilishly cunning, evil--but not\ninsane. I don't know what it is, Pat. I know that the fight has to be\nmade by me alone. There's nothing, nobody in the world, that can help.\"\n\n\"Nick!\" she wailed.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Pat dear. You understand now why I was so reluctant to fall\nin love with you. I was afraid to love you; now I know I was right.\"\n\n\"Nick!\" she cried, then paused hopelessly. After a moment she\ncontinued, \"Yesterday I was determined to forget you, and now--now I\ndon't care if this whole tale of yours is a mesh of fantastic lies, I\nlove you! I'd love you even if your real self were that--that other\ncreature, and even if I knew that this was just a trap. I'd love you\nanyway.\"\n\n\"Pat,\" he said seriously, \"don't you believe me? Why should I offer to\ngive you up if this were--what you said? Wouldn't I be pleading for\nanother chance, making promises, finding excuses?\"\n\n\"Oh, I believe you, Nick! It isn't that; I was just thinking how\nstrange it is that I could hate you so two nights past and love you so\ntonight.\"\n\n\"Oh God, Pat! Even you can't know how much I love you; and to win you\nand then be forced to give you up--\" He groaned.\n\nThe girl reached out her hand and covered his; it was the first time\nduring the evening that she had touched him, and the feel of his flesh\nsent a tingle through her. She was miserably distraught.\n\n\"Honey,\" she murmured brokenly. \"Nick, Honey.\"\n\nHe looked at her. \"Do you suppose there's a chance to beat the thing?\"\nhe asked. \"I'd not ask you to wait, Pat, but if I only glimpsed a\nchance--\"\n\n\"I'll wait. I don't think I could do anything else but wait for you.\"\n\n\"If I only knew what I had to fight!\" he whispered. \"If I only knew\nthat!\"\n\nA sudden memory leaped into Pat's mind. \"Nick,\" she said huskily, \"I\nthink I know.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Pat?\"\n\n\"It's something Magda--the cook--said to me. It's foolish,\nsuperstitious, but Nick, what else can it be?\"\n\n\"Tell me!\"\n\n\"Well, she was talking to me yesterday, and she said that when she\nwas a child in the old country, she had seen a man once--\" she\nhesitated--\"a man who was possessed by a devil. Nick, I think you're\npossessed by a devil!\"\n\nHe stared at her. \"Pat,\" he said hoarsely, \"that's--an impossibility!\"\n\n\"I know, but what else can it be?\"\n\n\"Out of the Dark Ages,\" he muttered. \"An echo of the Black Mass and\nwitchcraft, but--\"\n\n\"What did they do,\" asked the girl, \"to people they thought were\npossessed?\"\n\n\"Exorcism!\" he whispered.\n\n\"And how did they--exorcise?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said in a low voice. \"Pat, that's an impossible\nidea, but--I don't know!\" he ended.\n\n\"We'll try,\" she murmured, still covering his hand with her own. \"What\nelse can we do, Nick?\"\n\n\"What's done I'll do alone, Pat.\"\n\n\"But I want to help!\"\n\n\"I'll not let you, Dear. I won't have you exposed to a repetition of\nthose indignities, or perhaps worse!\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid.\"\n\n\"Then I am, Pat! I won't have it!\"\n\n\"But what'll you do?\"\n\n\"I'll go away. I'll battle the thing through once for all, and I'll\neither come back free of it or--\" He paused and the girl did not\nquestion him further, but sat staring at him with troubled eyes.\n\n\"I won't write you, Pat,\" he continued. \"If you should receive a letter\nfrom me, burn it--don't read it. It might be from--the other, a trap or\na lure of some sort. Promise me! You'll promise that, won't you?\"\n\nShe nodded; there was a glint of tears in her eyes.\n\n\"And I don't want you to wait, Pat,\" he proceeded. \"I don't want you to\nfeel that you have any obligations to me--God knows you've nothing to\nthank me for! When--If I come back and you haven't changed, then we'll\ntry again.\"\n\n\"Nick,\" she said in a small voice, \"how do you know the--the other\nwon't come back here? How can you promise for--it?\"\n\n\"I'm still master!\" he said grimly. \"I won't be dominated long enough\nat any time for that to happen. I'll fight it down.\"\n\n\"Then--it's good-bye?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"But not for always--I hope.\"\n\n\"Nick,\" she murmured, \"will you kiss me?\" She felt a tear on her cheek.\n\"I'll stand losing you a little better if I can have a--last kiss--to\nremember.\" Her voice was faltering.\n\nHis arms were about her. She yielded herself completely to his caress;\nthe park, the crowd passing a few yards away, the people on near-by\nbenches, were all forgotten, and once more she felt herself alone with\nNicholas Devine in a vast empty cosmos.\n\nAn insistent voice penetrated her consciousness; she realized that it\nhad been calling her name for some seconds.\n\n\"Miss Lane,\" she heard, and again, \"Miss Lane.\" A hand tapped her\nshoulder; with a sudden start, she tore her lips away, and looked up\ninto a face unrecognized for a moment. Then she placed it. It was the\nvisage of Mueller, Dr. Horker's companion on that disastrous Saturday\nnight.\n\n\n\n\n16\n\nPossessed\n\n\nPat stared at the intruder in a mingling of embarrassment, perplexity,\nand indignation. She felt her cheeks reddening as the latter emotion\ngained the dominance of her mood.\n\n\"Well!\" she snapped. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I thought I'd walk home with you,\" Mueller said amiably.\n\n\"Walk home with me! Please explain that!\" She grasped the arm of\nNicholas Devine, who had risen angrily at the interruption. \"Sit down,\nNick, I know the fellow.\"\n\n\"So should he,\" said Mueller. \"Sure; I'll explain. I'm on a job for Dr.\nHorker.\"\n\n\"Spying on me for him, I suppose!\" taunted the girl.\n\n\"No. Not on you.\"\n\n\"He means on me,\" said Nick soberly. \"You can't blame him, Pat. And\nperhaps you had better go home; we've finished here. There's nothing\nmore we can do or say.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she said, her voice suddenly softer. \"In a moment, Nick.\"\nShe turned to Mueller. \"Would you mind telling me why you waited until\nnow to interfere? We've been here two hours, you know.\"\n\n\"Sure I'll tell you. I got no orders to interfere, that's why.\"\n\n\"Then why did you?\" queried Pat tartly.\n\n\"I didn't until I saw him there\"--he nodded at Nick--\"put his arms\naround you. Then I figured, having no orders, it was time to use my own\njudgment.\"\n\n\"If any!\" sniffed the girl. She turned again to Nick; her face\nsoftened, became very tender. \"Honey,\" she murmured huskily, \"I guess\nit's good-bye now. I'll be fighting with you; you know that.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" he echoed, looking down into her eyes. \"I'm almost\nhappy, Pat.\"\n\n\"When'll you go?\" she whispered in tones inaudible to Mueller.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he answered, his voice unchanged. \"I'll have to make\nsome sort of preparations--and I don't want you to know.\"\n\nShe nodded. She gazed at him a moment longer with tear-bright eyes.\n\"Good-bye, Nick,\" she whispered. She rose on tiptoe, and kissed him\nvery lightly on his lips, then turned and walked quickly away, with\nMueller following behind.\n\nShe walked on, ignoring him until he halted beside her at the crossing\nof the Drive. Then she gave him a cold glance.\n\n\"Why is Dr. Carl having him watched?\" she asked.\n\nMueller shrugged. \"The ins and outs of this case are too much for me,\"\nhe said. \"I do what I'm paid to do.\"\n\n\"You're not watching him now.\"\n\n\"Nope. Seemed like the Doctor would think it was more important to get\nyou home.\"\n\n\"You're wasting your time,\" she said irritably as the lights changed\nand they stepped into the street. \"I was going home anyway.\"\n\n\"Well, now you got company all the way.\" Mueller's voice was placid.\n\nThe girl sniffed contemptuously, and strode silently along. The other's\npresence irritated her; she wanted time and solitude to consider the\namazing story Nicholas Devine had given her. She wanted to analyze her\nown feelings, and most of all she wanted just a place of privacy to\ncry out her misery. For now the loss of Nicholas Devine had changed\nfrom a fortunate escape to a tragedy, and liar, madman, or devil, she\nwanted him terribly, with all the power of her tense little heart. So\nshe moved as swiftly as she could, ignoring the silent companionship of\nMueller.\n\nThey reached her home; the light in the living room window was evidence\nthat the bridge game was still in progress. She mounted the steps,\nMueller watching her silently from the walk; she fumbled for her key.\n\nSuddenly she snapped her hand-bag shut; she couldn't face her mother\nand the two spinster Brocks and elderly, inquisitive Carter Henderson.\nThey'd suggest that she cut into the game, and they'd argue if\nshe refused, and she couldn't play bridge now! She glanced at the\nimpassive Mueller, turned and crossed the strip of lawn to Dr. Horker's\nresidence, where the light still glowed in the library, and rang the\nbell. She saw the figure on the sidewalk move away as the shadow of the\nDoctor appeared on the lighted square of the door.\n\n\"Hello,\" boomed the Doctor amiably. \"Come in.\"\n\nPat stalked into the library and threw herself angrily into Dr.\nHorker's particular chair. The other grinned, and chose another place.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"What touched off the fuse this time?\"\n\n\"Why are you spying on my friends?\" snapped the girl. \"By what right?\"\n\n\"So he's spotted Mueller, eh? That lad's diabolically clever, Pat--and\nI mean diabolic.\"\n\n\"That's no answer!\"\n\n\"So it isn't,\" agreed the Doctor. \"Say it's because I'm acting _in loco\nparentis_.\"\n\n\"And _in loco_ is as far as you'll get, Dr. Carl, if you're going to\nspy on me!\"\n\n\"On you?\" he said mildly. \"Who's spying on you?\"\n\n\"On us, then!\"\n\n\"Or on us?\" queried the Doctor. \"I set Mueller to watch the Devine lad.\nHave you by some mischance broken your promise to me?\"\n\nPat flushed. She had forgotten that broken promise; the recollection of\nit suddenly took the wind from her sails, placed her on the defensive.\n\n\"All right,\" she said defiantly. \"I did; I admit it. Does that excuse\nyou?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it helps to explain my actions, Pat. Don't you understand that\nI'm trying to protect you? Do you think I hired Mueller out of morbid\ncuriosity, or professional interest in the case? Times aren't so good\nthat I can throw money away on such whims.\"\n\n\"I don't need any protection. I can take care of myself!\"\n\n\"So I noticed,\" said the Doctor dryly. \"You gave convincing evidence of\nit night before last.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the girl in exasperation. \"You would say that!\"\n\n\"It's true, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Suppose it is! I don't have to learn the same lesson twice.\"\n\n\"Well, apparently once wasn't enough,\" observed the other amiably. \"You\nwalked into the same danger tonight.\"\n\n\"I wasn't in any danger tonight!\" Suddenly her mood changed as she\nrecalled the circumstances of her parting with Nicholas Devine. \"Dr.\nCarl,\" she said, her voice dropping, \"I'm terribly unhappy.\"\n\n\"Lord!\" he exclaimed staring at her. \"Pat, your moods are as changeable\nas my golf game! You're as mercurial as your Devine lad! A moment ago\nyou were snapping at me, and now I'm suddenly acceptable again.\" He\nperceived the misery in her face. \"All right, child; I'm listening.\"\n\n\"He's going away,\" she said mournfully.\n\n\"Don't you think that's best for everybody concerned? I commend his\njudgment.\"\n\n\"But I don't want him to!\"\n\n\"You do, Pat. You can't continue seeing him, and his absence will make\nit easier for you.\"\n\n\"It'll never be easier for me, Dr. Carl.\" She felt her eyes fill. \"I\nguess I'm--just a fool about him.\"\n\n\"You still feel that way, after the experience you went through?\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"Then you _are_ a fool about him, Pat. He's not worth such devotion.\"\n\n\"How do you know what he's worth? I'm the only one to judge that.\"\n\n\"I have eyes,\" said the Doctor. \"What happened tonight to change your\nattitude so suddenly? You were amenable to reason yesterday.\"\n\n\"I didn't know yesterday what I know now.\"\n\n\"So he told a story, eh?\" The Doctor watched her serious, troubled\nfeatures. \"Would you mind telling me, Honey? I'm interested in the\ndefense mechanisms these psychopathic cases erect to explain their own\nimpulses to themselves.\"\n\n\"No, I won't tell you!\" snapped Pat indignantly. \"Psychopathic cases!\nWe're all just cases to you. I'm a case and he's another, and all you\nwant is our symptoms!\"\n\nDoctor Horker smiled placatingly into her face. \"Pat dear,\" he said\nearnestly, \"don't you see I'd give my eyes to help you? Don't take\nmy flippancies too seriously, Honey; look once in a while at the\nintentions behind them.\" He continued his earnest gaze.\n\nThe girl returned his look; her face softened. \"I'm sorry,\" she said\ncontritely. \"I never doubted it, Dr. Carl--it's only that I'm so--so\ntorn to pieces by all this that I get snappy and irritable.\" She\npaused. \"Of course I'll tell you.\"\n\n\"I'd like to hear it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she began hesitantly, \"he said he was two personalities--one\nthe character I knew, and one the character that we saw Saturday night.\nAnd the first one is--well, dominant, and fights the other one. He says\nthe other has been growing stronger; until lately he could suppress\nit. And he says--Oh, it sounds ridiculous, the way I tell it, but it's\ntrue! I'm sure it's true!\" She leaned toward the Doctor. \"Did you ever\nhear of anything like it? Did you, Dr. Carl?\"\n\n\"No.\" He shook his head, still watching her seriously. \"Not exactly\nlike that, Honey. Don't you think he might possibly have lied to you,\nPat? To excuse himself for the responsibility of Saturday night, for\ninstance?\"\n\n\"No, I don't,\" she said defiantly.\n\n\"Then you have an idea yourself what the trouble is? I judge you have.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said in low tones. \"I have an idea.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I think he's possessed by a devil!\" said the girl flatly.\n\nA quizzical expression came into the Doctor's face. \"Well, of all the\nqueer ideas that harum-scarum mind of yours has _ever_ produced, that's\nthe queerest!\" He broke into a chuckle.\n\n\"Queer, is it?\" flared Pat. \"I don't think you and your mind-doctors\nknow as much as a Swahili medicine-man with a mask!\"\n\nShe leaped angrily to her feet, stamped viciously into the hall.\n\n\"Devil and all,\" she repeated, \"I love him!\"\n\n\"Pat!\" called the Doctor anxiously. \"Pat! Where are you going, child?\"\n\n\"Where do devils live?\" Her voice floated tauntingly back from the\nfront door. \"Hell, of course!\"\n\n\n\n\n17\n\nWitch-Doctor\n\n\nPat had no intentions, however, of following the famous highway that\nevening. She stamped angrily down the Doctor's steps, swished her way\nthrough the break in the hedge with small regard to the safety of her\nsheer hose, and mounted to her own porch. She found her key, opened the\ndoor and entered.\n\nAs she ascended the stairs, her fit of temper at the Doctor passed, and\nshe felt lonely, weary, and unutterably miserable. She sank to a seat\non the topmost step and gave herself over to bitter reflections.\n\nNick was gone! The realization came poignantly at last; there would be\nno more evening rides, no more conversations whose range was limited\nonly by the scope of the universe, no more breath-taking kisses, the\nsweeter for his reluctance. She sat mournfully silent, and considered\nthe miserable situation in which she found herself.\n\nIn love with a madman! Or worse--in love with a demon! With a being\nhalf of whose nature worshiped her while the other half was bent on her\ndestruction! Was any one, she asked herself--was any one, anywhere,\never in a more hopeless predicament?\n\nWhat could she do? Nothing, she realized, save sit helplessly aside\nwhile Nick battled the thing to a finish. Or possibly--the only\nalternative--take him as he was, chance the vicissitudes of his\nunstable nature, lay herself open to the horrors she had glimpsed so\nrecently, and pray for her fortunes to point the way of salvation. And\nin the mood in which she now found herself, that seemed infinitely the\npreferable solution. Yet rationally she knew it was impossible; she\nshook her head despondently, and leaned against the wall in abject\nmisery.\n\nThen, thin and sharp sounded the shrill summons of the door bell, and\na moment later, the patter of the maid's footsteps in the hall below.\nShe listened idly to distract herself from the chain of despondency\nthat was her thoughts, and was mildly startled to recognize the booming\ndrums of Dr. Horker's voice. She heard his greeting and the muffled\nreply from the group, and then a phrase understandable because of his\nsonorous tones.\n\n\"Where's Pat?\" The words drifted up the well of the stairs, followed\nby a scarcely audible reply from her mother. Heavy footfalls on the\ncarpeted steps, and then his figure bulked on the landing below her.\nShe cupped her chin on her hands, and stared down at him while he\nascended to her side, sprawling his great figure beside her.\n\n\"Pat, Honey,\" he rumbled, \"you're beginning to get me worried!\"\n\n\"Am I?\" Her voice was weary, dull. \"I've had myself like that for a\nlong time.\"\n\n\"Poor kid! Are you really so miserable over this Nick problem of yours?\"\n\n\"I love him.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He looked at her with sympathy and calculation mingling in his\nexpression. \"I believe you do. I'm sorry, Honey; I didn't realize until\nnow what he means to you.\"\n\n\"You don't realize now,\" she murmured, still with the weary intonation.\n\n\"Perhaps not, Pat, but I'm learning. If you're in this thing as deeply\nat all that, I'm in too--to the finish. Want me?\"\n\nShe reached out her hand, plucking at his coatsleeve. Abruptly she\nleaned toward him, burying her face against the rough tweed of his\nsuit; she sobbed a little, while he patted her gently with his great,\ndelicately fingered hand. \"I'm sorry, Honey,\" he rumbled. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nThe girl drew herself erect and leaned back against the wall, shaking\nher head to drive the tears from her eyes. She gave the Doctor a wan\nlittle smile.\n\n\"Well?\" she asked.\n\n\"I'll return your compliment of the other night,\" said Horker briskly.\n\"I'll ask a few questions--purely professional, of course.\"\n\n\"Fire away, Dr. Carl.\"\n\n\"Good. Now, when our friend has one of these--uh--attacks, is he\nrational? Do his utterances seem to follow a logical thought sequence?\"\n\n\"I--think so.\"\n\n\"In what way does he differ from his normal self?\"\n\n\"Oh, every way,\" she said with a tremor. \"Nick's kind and gentle and\nsensitive and--and naive, and this--other--is cruel, harsh, gross,\ncrafty, and horrible. You can't imagine a greater difference.\"\n\n\"Um. Is the difference recognizable instantly? Could you ever be in\ndoubt as to which phase you were encountering?\"\n\n\"Oh, no! I can--well, sort of dominate Nick, but the other--Lord!\" She\nshuddered again. \"I felt like a terrified child in the presence of some\npowerful, evil god.\"\n\n\"Humph! Perhaps the god's name was Priapus. Well, we'll discount your\nfeelings, Pat, because you weren't exactly in the best condition\nfor--let's say _sober_ judgment. Now about this story of his. What\nhappens to his own personality when this other phase is dominant? Did\nhe say?\"\n\n\"Yes. He said his own self was compelled to sort of stand by while\nthe--the intruder used his voice and body. He knew the thoughts of the\nother, but only when it was dominant. The rest of the time he couldn't\ntell its thoughts.\"\n\n\"And how long has he suffered from these--intrusions?\"\n\n\"As long as he can remember. As a child he was blamed for the other's\nmischief, and when he tried to explain, people thought he was lying to\nescape punishment.\"\n\n\"Well,\" observed the Doctor, \"I can see how they might think that.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe it?\"\n\n\"I don't exactly disbelieve it, Honey. The human mind plays queer\ntricks sometimes, and this may be one of its little jokes. It's a\npsychiatrist's business to investigate such things, and to painlessly\nremove the point of the joke.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you only can, Dr. Carl! If you only can!\"\n\n\"We'll see.\" He patted her hand comfortingly.\n\n\"Now, you say the kind, gentle, and all that, phase is the normal one.\nIs that usually dominant?\"\n\n\"Yes. Nick can master the other, or could until recently. He says this\nlast--attack--is the worst he's ever had; the other has been gaining\nstrength.\"\n\n\"Strange!\" mused the Doctor. \"Well,\" he said with a smile of\nencouragement, \"I'll have a look at him.\"\n\n\"Do you think you can help?\" Pat asked anxiously. \"Have you any idea\nwhat it is?\"\n\n\"It isn't a devil, at any rate,\" he smiled.\n\n\"But have you any idea?\"\n\n\"Naturally I have, but I can't diagnose at second hand. I'll have to\ntalk to him.\"\n\n\"But what do you think it is?\" she persisted.\n\n\"I think it's a fixation of an idea gained in childhood, Honey. I had\na patient once--\" He smiled at the reminiscence--\"who had a fixed\ndelusion of that sort. He was perfectly rational on every point\nsave one--he believed that a pig with a pink ribbon was following\nhim everywhere! Down town, into elevators and offices, home to\nbed--everywhere he went this pink-ribboned prize porker pursued him!\"\n\n\"And did you cure him?\"\n\n\"Well, he recovered,\" said the Doctor non-committally. \"We got rid of\nthe pig. And it might be something of that nature that's troubling your\nboy friend. Your description doesn't sound like a praecox or a manic\ndepressive, as I thought originally.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Pat abruptly. \"I forgot. He went to a doctor in New York, a\nvery great doctor.\"\n\n\"Muenster?\"\n\n\"He didn't say whom. But this doctor studied him a long time, and\nfinally came out with this fixed idea theory of yours. Only he couldn't\ncure him.\"\n\n\"Um.\" Horker grunted thoughtfully.\n\n\"Do fixed ideas do things like that to people?\" queried the girl.\n\"Things like the pig and what happened to Nick?\"\n\n\"They might.\"\n\n\"Then they're devils!\" she announced with an air of finality. \"They're\njust your scientific jargon for exactly what Magda means when she says\na person's possessed by a devil. So I'm right anyway!\"\n\n\"That's good orthodox theology, Pat,\" chuckled the Doctor. \"We'll try a\nlittle exorcism on your devil, then.\" He rose to his feet. \"Bring your\nboy friend around, will you?\"\n\n\"Oh, Dr. Carl!\" she cried. \"He's leaving! I'll have to call him\ntonight!\"\n\n\"Not tonight, Honey. Mueller would let me know if anything of that sort\nwere happening. Tomorrow's time enough.\"\n\nThe girl stood erect, mounting to the top step to bring her head level\nwith the Doctor's. She threw her arms about him, burying her face in\nhis massive shoulder.\n\n\"Dr. Carl,\" she murmured, \"I'm a nasty, ill-tempered, vicious little\nshrew, and I'm sorry, and I apologize. You know I'm crazy about you,\nand,\" she whispered in his ear, \"so's Mother!\"\n\n\n\n\n18\n\nVanished\n\n\n\"He doesn't answer! I'm too late,\" thought Pat disconsolately as she\nreplaced the telephone. The cheerfulness with which she had awakened\nvanished like a patch of April sunshine. Now, with the failure of her\nthird attempt in as many hours to communicate with Nicholas Devine,\nshe was ready to confess defeat. She had waited too long. Despite Dr.\nHorker's confidence in Mueller, she should have called last night--at\nonce.\n\n\"He's gone!\" she murmured distractedly. She realized now the\nimpossibility of finding him. His solitary habits, his dearth of\nfriends, his lonely existence, left her without the least idea of how\nto commence a search. She knew, actually, so little about him--not\neven the source of the apparently sufficient income on which he\nsubsisted. She felt herself completely at a loss, puzzled, lonesome,\nand disheartened. The futile buzzing of the telephone signal symbolized\nher frustration.\n\nPerhaps, she thought, Dr. Horker might suggest something to do;\nperhaps, even, Mueller had reported Nick's whereabouts. She seized\nthe hope eagerly. A glance at her wrist-watch revealed the time as\nten-thirty; squarely in the midst of the Doctor's morning office hours,\nbut no matter. If he were busy she could wait. She rose, bounding\nhastily down the stairs.\n\nShe glimpsed her mother opening mail in the library, and paused\nmomentarily at the door. Mrs. Lane glanced up as she appeared.\n\n\"Hello,\" said the mother. \"You've been on the telephone all morning,\nand what did Carl want of you last night?\"\n\n\"Argument,\" responded Pat briefly.\n\n\"Carl's a gem! He's been of inestimable assistance in developing you\ninto a very charming and clever daughter, and Heaven knows what I'd\nhave raised without him!\"\n\n\"Cain, probably,\" suggested Pat. She passed into the hall and out the\ndoor, blinking in the brilliant August sunshine. She crossed the strip\nof turf, picked her way through the break in the hedge, and approached\nthe Doctor's door. It was open; it often was in summer time, especially\nduring his brief office hours. She entered and went into the chamber\nused as waiting room.\n\nHis office door was closed; the faint hum of his voice sounded. She sat\nimpatiently in a chair and forced herself to wait.\n\nFortunately, the delay was nominal; it was but a few minutes when the\ndoor opened and an opulent, middle-aged lady swept past her and away.\nPat recognized her as Mrs. Lowry, some sort of cousin of the Brock pair.\n\n\"Good morning!\" boomed the Doctor. \"Professional call, I take it, since\nyou're here during office hours.\" He settled his great form in a chair\nbeside her.\n\n\"He's gone!\" said Pat plaintively. \"I can't reach him.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" grunted Horker helpfully.\n\n\"I've tried all morning--he's always home in the morning.\"\n\n\"Listen, you little scatter-brain!\" rumbled the Doctor. \"Why didn't you\ntell me Mueller brought you home last night? I thought he was on the\njob.\"\n\n\"I didn't think of it,\" she wailed. \"Nick said he'd have to make some\npreparations, and I never dreamed he'd skip away like this.\"\n\n\"He must have gone home directly after you left him, and skipped out\nimmediately,\" said the Doctor ruminatively. \"Mueller never caught up\nwith him.\"\n\n\"But what'll we do?\" she cried desperately.\n\n\"He can't have gone far with no more preparation than this,\" soothed\nHorker. \"He'll write you in a day or two.\"\n\n\"He won't! He said he wouldn't. He doesn't want me to know where he\nis!\" She was on the verge of tears.\n\n\"Now, now,\" said the Doctor still in his soothing tones. \"It isn't as\nbad as all that.\"\n\n\"Take off your bed-side manner!\" she snapped, blinking to keep back the\ntears. \"It's worse! What ever can we do? Dr. Carl,\" she changed to a\npleading tone, \"can't you think of something?\"\n\n\"Of course, Pat! I can think of several things to do if you'll quiet\ndown for a moment or so.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Dr. Carl--but what _can_ we do?\"\n\n\"First, perhaps Mueller can trace him. That's his business, you know.\"\n\n\"But suppose he can't--what then?\"\n\n\"Well, I'd suggest you write him a letter.\"\n\n\"But I don't know where to write!\" she wailed. \"I don't know his\naddress!\"\n\n\"Be still a moment, scatter-brain! Address it to his last residence;\nyou know that, don't you? Of course you do. Now, don't you suppose\nhe'll leave a forwarding address? He must receive some sort of mail\nabout his income, or estate, or whatever he lives on. Your letter'll\nfind him, Honey; don't you doubt it.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you think so?\" she asked, suddenly hopeful. \"Do you really\nthink so?\"\n\n\"I really think so. You would too if you didn't fly into a panic every\ntime some little difficulty confronts you. Sometimes even my psychiatry\nis puzzled to explain how you can be so clever and so stupid, so\nself-reliant and so dependent, so capable and so helpless--all at one\nand the same time. Your Nick can't be as much of a paradox as you are!\"\n\n\"I wonder if a letter _will_ reach him,\" she said eagerly, ignoring the\nDoctor's remarks. \"I'll try. I'll try immediately.\"\n\n\"I sort of had a feeling you would,\" said Horker amiably. \"I hope you\nsucceed; and not only for your sake, Pat, because God knows how this\nthing will work out. But I'm anxious to examine this youngster of yours\non my own account; he must be a remarkable specimen to account for all\nthe perturbation he's managed to cause you. And this Jekyll-and-Hyde\nangle sounds interesting, too.\"\n\n\"Jekyll and Hyde!\" echoed Pat. \"Dr. Carl, is that possible?\"\n\n\"Not literally,\" chuckled the other, \"though in a sense, Stevenson\nanticipated Freud in his thesis that liberating the evil serves also to\nrelease the good.\"\n\n\"But--It was a drug that caused that change in the story, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Well? Do you suspect your friend of being addicted to some mysterious\ndrug? Is that the latest hypothesis?\"\n\n\"_Is_ there such a drug? One that could change a person's character?\"\n\n\"_All_ alkaloids do that, Honey. Some of them stimulate, some depress,\nsome breed frenzies, and some give visions of delight--but all of\nthem influence one's mental and emotional organization, which you call\ncharacter. So for that matter, does a square meal, or a cup of coffee,\nor even a rainy day.\"\n\n\"But isn't there a drug that can separate good qualities from evil,\nlike the story?\"\n\n\"Emphatically not, Pat! That's not the trouble with this pesky boy\nfriend of yours.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the girl doubtfully, \"I only wish I had as much faith in\nyour psychologies as you have. If you brain-doctors know it all, why do\nyou switch theories every year?\"\n\n\"We _don't_ know it all. On the other hand, there are a few things to\nbe said in our favor.\"\n\n\"What are they?\"\n\n\"For one,\" replied the Doctor, \"we do cure people occasionally. You'll\nadmit that.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Pat. \"So did the Salem witches--occasionally.\" She\ngave him a suddenly worried look. \"Oh, Dr. Carl, don't think I'm\nnot grateful! You know how much I'm hoping from your help, but I'm\nmiserably anxious over all this.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Honey. You're not the first one to point out the\nshortcomings of the medical profession. That's a game played by plenty\nof physicians too.\" He paused at the sound of footsteps on the porch,\nfollowed by the buzz of the doorbell. \"Run along and write your letter,\ndear--here comes that Tuesday hypochondriac of mine, and he's rich\nenough for my careful attention.\"\n\nPat flashed him a quick smile of farewell and slipped quietly into the\nhall. At the door she passed the Doctor's patient--a lean, elderly\ngentleman of woe-begone visage--and returned to her own home.\n\nHer spirits, mercurial to a degree, had risen again. She was suddenly\npositive that the Doctor's scheme would bring results, and she darted\ninto the house almost buoyantly. Her mother had abandoned the desk,\nand she ensconced herself before it, finding paper and pen, and staring\nthoughtfully at the blank sheet.\n\nFinally she wrote.\n\n     \"Dear Nick--\n\n     \"Something has happened, favorable, I think, to us. I believe I\n     have found the help we need.\n\n     \"Will you come if you can, or if that's not possible, break that\n     self-given promise of yours, and communicate with me?\n\n     \"I love you.\"\n\nShe signed it simply \"Pat\", placed it in an envelope, addressed it\nhastily, and hurried out to post it. On her return she spied the\nDoctor's hypochondriac in the act of leaving. He walked past her with\nhis lean, worry-smitten face like a study of Hogarth, and she heard him\nmumbling to himself. The elation went out of her; she mounted the steps\nvery soberly, and went miserably inside.\n\n\n\n\n19\n\nMan or Monster?\n\n\nPat suffered Wednesday through somehow, knowing that any such early\nresponse to her letter was impossible. Still, that impossibility did\nnot deter her from starting at the sound of the telephone, and sorting\nthrough the mail with an eagerness that drew a casual attention from\nher mother.\n\n\"Good Heavens, Patricia! You're like a child watching for an answer to\nhis note to Santa Claus!\"\n\n\"That's what I am, I guess,\" responded the girl ruefully. \"Maybe I\nexpect too much from Santa Claus.\"\n\nLate in the afternoon she drifted over to Dr. Horker's residence, to\nbe informed that he was out. For distraction, she went in anyway, and\nspent a while browsing among the books in the library. She blundered\ninto Kraft-Ebing, and read a few pages in growing indignation.\n\n\"I'm ashamed to be human!\" she muttered disgustedly to herself,\nslamming shut the _Psychopathia Sexualis_. \"I wouldn't be a doctor, or\nhave a child of mine become one, if I were positively certain he'd turn\ninto Lord Lister himself! Nick was right when he said doctors live on\npeople's troubles.\"\n\nShe wondered how Dr. Horker could remain so human, so kindly and\nunderstanding, when as he said himself his world was a parade of\nmisfits, incompetents, and all the nastiness of mortals. _He_ was nice;\nshe felt no embarrassment in confiding in him even when she might\nhesitate to bare her feelings to her own mother. Or was it simply the\nnatural thing to do to tell one's troubles to a doctor?\n\nNot, of course, that the situation reflected any discredit on her\nmother. Mrs. Lane was a very precious sort of parent, she mused,\nyoung as Pat in spirit, appreciative and enthusiastically fond of her\ndaughter. That she trusted Pat, that she permitted her to do entirely\nas she pleased, was exactly as the girl would have it; it argued no\nlack of affection that each of them had their separate interests, and\nif the girl occasionally found herself in unpleasantness such as this,\nthat too was her own fault.\n\nAnd yet, she reflected, it was a bitter thing to have no one to whom to\nturn. If it weren't for Dr. Carl and his jovial willingness to commit\nany sin up to malpractice to help her, she might have felt differently.\nBut there always _was_ Dr. Carl, and that, she concluded, was that.\n\nShe wandered back to her own side of the hedge, missing for the first\ntime in many weeks the companionship of the old crowd. There hadn't\nbeen many idle afternoons heretofore during the summer; there'd always\nbeen some of the collegiate vacationing in town, and Pat had never\nneeded other lure than her own piquant vivacity to assure herself\nof ample attention. Now, of course, it was different; she had so\ndefinitely tagged herself with the same Nicholas Devine that even the\nmost ardent of the group had taken the warning.\n\n\"And I don't regret it either!\" she told herself as she entered the\nhouse. \"Trouble, mystery, suffering and all--I don't regret it! I've\nhad my compensations too.\"\n\nShe sighed and trudged upstairs to prepare for dinner.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMorning found Pat in a fair frenzy of trepidation. She kept repeating\nto herself that two days wasn't enough, that more time might be\nrequired, that even had Nicholas Devine received her letter, he might\nnot have answered at once. Yet she was quivering as she darted into\nthe hall to examine the mail.\n\nIt was there! She spied a fragment of the irregular handwriting and\nseized the envelope from beneath a clutter of notes, bills, and\nadvertisements. She glanced at the post-mark. Chicago! He hadn't left\nthe city, trusting perhaps to the anonymity conferred by its colossal\nswarm of humanity. Indeed, she thought as she stared at the missive,\nhe might have moved around the corner, and save for the chance of a\nfortuitous meeting she'd never know it.\n\nShe tore open the envelope and scanned the several scrawled lines.\n\nNo heading, no salutation, not even a signature. Just, \"Thursday\nevening at our place in the park.\" No more; she studied the few words\nintently, as if she could read into their bald phrasing the moods and\nhidden emotions of the writer.\n\nA single phrase, but sufficient. The day was suddenly brighter, and\nthe hope which had glowed so dimly yesterday was abruptly almost more\nthan a hope--a certainty. All her doubts of Dr. Horker's abilities were\nforgotten; already the solution of this uncanny mystery seemed assured,\nand the restoration of romance imminent. She carried the letter to her\nown room and tucked it carefully by the other in the drawer of the\nnight-table.\n\nThursday evening--this evening! Many hours intervened between now and a\nreasonable time for the meeting, but they loomed no longer drab, dull,\nand hopeless. She lay on her bed and dreamed.\n\nShe could meet Nick as early as possible; perhaps at eight-thirty, and\nbring him directly to the Doctor's residence. No use wasting a moment,\nshe mused; the sooner some light could be thrown on the affliction,\nthe sooner they could lay the devil--exorcise it. Demon, fixed idea,\nmental aberration, or whatever Dr. Carl chose to call it, it had to be\nmet and vanquished once and forever. And it _could_ be vanquished; in\nher present mood she didn't doubt it. Then--after that--there was the\nprospect of her own Nick regained, and the sweet vistas opened by that\nreflection.\n\nShe lunched in an abstracted manner. In the afternoon, when the phone\nrang, she jumped in a startled manner, then relaxed with a shrug.\n\nBut this time it _was_ for her. She darted into the hall to take the\ncall on the lower phone; she was hardly surprised but thoroughly\nexcited to recognize the voice of Nicholas Devine.\n\n\"Pat?\"\n\n\"Nick! Oh, Nick, Honey! What is it?\"\n\n\"My note to you.\" Even across the wire she sensed the strain in his\ntense tones. \"You've read it?\"\n\n\"Of course, Nick! I'll be there.\"\n\n\"No.\" His voice was trembling. \"You won't come, Pat. Promise you won't!\"\n\n\"But why? Why not, Nick? Oh, it's terribly important that I see you!\"\n\n\"You're not to come, Pat!\"\n\n\"But--\" An idea was struggling to her consciousness. \"Nick, was it--?\"\n\n\"Yes. You know now.\"\n\n\"But, Honey, what difference does it make? _You_ come. You must, Nick!\"\n\n\"I won't meet you, I tell you!\" She could hear his voice rising\nexcitedly in pitch, she could feel the intensity of the struggle across\nunknown miles of lifeless copper wire.\n\n\"Nick,\" she said, \"I'm going to be there, and you're going to meet me.\"\n\nThere was silence at the other end.\n\n\"Nick!\" she cried anxiously. \"Do you hear me? I'll be there. Will you?\"\n\nHis voice sounded again, now flat and toneless.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"I'll be there.\"\n\nThe receiver clicked at the far end of the wire; there was only a\nfutile buzzing in Pat's ears. She replaced the instrument and sat\nstaring dubiously at it.\n\nHad that been Nick, really her Nick, or--? Suppose she went to that\nmeeting and found--the other? Was she willing to face another evening\nof indignities and terrors like those still fresh in her memory?\n\nStill, she argued, what harm could come to her on that bench, exposed\nas it was to the gaze of thousands who wandered through the park on\nsummer evenings? Suppose it _were_ the other who met her; there was no\nway to force her into a situation such as that of Saturday night. Nick\nhimself had chosen that very spot for their other meeting, and for that\nvery reason.\n\n\"There's no risk in it,\" she told herself, \"Nothing can possibly\nhappen. I'll simply go there and bring Nick back to Dr. Carl's, along a\nlighted, busy street, the whole two blocks. What's there to be afraid\nof?\"\n\nNothing at all, she answered herself. But suppose--She shuddered and\ndeliberately abandoned her chain of thought as she rose and rejoined\nher mother.\n\n\n\n\n20\n\nThe Assignation\n\n\nPat was by no means as buoyant as she had been in the morning. She\napproached the appointed meeting place with a feeling of trepidation\nthat all her arguments could not subdue.\n\nShe surveyed the crowded walks of the park with relief; she felt\nconfirmed in her assumption that nothing unpleasant could occur with\nso many on-lookers. So she approached the bench with somewhat greater\nself-assurance than when she had left the house.\n\nShe saw the seat with its lone occupant, and hastened her steps.\nNicholas Devine was sitting exactly as he had on that other occasion,\nchin cupped on his hands, eyes turned moodily toward the vast lake\nthat coruscated now with the reflection of stars and many lights. As\nbefore, she moved close to his side before he looked up, but here the\nsimilarity of the two occasions vanished. Her fears were realized; she\nwas looking into the red-gleaming eyes and expressionless features of\nhis other self--the demon of Saturday evening!\n\n\"Sit down!\" he said as a sardonic half-smile twisted his lips. \"Aren't\nyou pleased? Aren't you thrilled to the very core of your being?\"\n\nPat stood irresolute; she controlled an impulse to break into sudden,\nabandoned flight. The imminence of the crowded walks again reassured\nher, and she seated herself gingerly on the extreme edge of the bench,\nstaring at her companion with coolly inimical eyes. He returned her\ngaze with features as immobile as carven stone; only his red eyes gave\nevidence of the obscene, uncanny life behind the mask.\n\n\"Well?\" said Pat in as frigid a voice as she could muster.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the other surveying her. \"You are quite as I recalled you.\nVery pretty, almost beautiful, save for a certain irregularity in your\nfeatures. Not unpleasant, however.\" His eyes traveled over her body;\nautomatically she drew back, shrinking away from him. \"You have a\nseductive body,\" he continued. \"A most seductive body; I regret that\ncircumstances prevented our full enjoyment of it. But that will come.\nYes, that will come!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Pat faintly. It took all her determination to remain seated\nby the side of the horror.\n\n\"You were extremely attractive as I attired you Saturday,\" the other\nproceeded. His lips took on a curious sensual leer. \"I could have\ndone better with more time; I would have stripped you somewhat more\ncompletely. Everything, I think, except your legs; I am pleased by\nthe sight of long, straight, silk-clad legs, and should perhaps have\nreceived some pleasure by running these hands along them--scratching\nat proper intervals for the aesthetic effect of blood. But that too\nwill come.\"\n\nThe girl sprang erect, gasping and speechless in outraged anger. She\nturned abruptly; nothing remained of her determination now. She felt\nonly an urge to escape from the sneering tormentor who had lost in her\nmind all connection with her own Nicholas Devine. She took a sudden\nstep.\n\n\"Sit down!\" She heard the tones of the entity behind her, flat,\nunchanged. \"Sit down, else I'll drag you here!\"\n\nShe paused in sheer surprise, turning a startled face on the other.\n\n\"You wouldn't dare!\" she said, amazed at the bald effrontery of the\nthreat. \"You don't dare touch me here!\"\n\nThe other laughed. \"Don't I? What have I to risk? _He_'ll suffer for\nany deed of mine! You'll call for aid against me and only loose the\nhounds on _him_.\"\n\nPat stared blankly at the evil face. She had no answer; for once her\nready tongue found no retort.\n\n\"Sit down!\" reiterated the other, and she dropped dazedly to her\nposition on the bench. She turned dark questioning eyes on him.\n\n\"Do you see,\" he sneered, \"how weakening an influence is this love of\nyours? To protect him you are obeying me; this is my authority over\nyou--this body I share with him!\"\n\nShe made no reply; she was making a desperate effort to lash her mind\ninto activity, to formulate some means of combating the being who\ntortured her.\n\n\"It has weakened him, too,\" the other proceeded. \"This disturbed\nlove of his has taken away the mastery which birth gave him, and his\nenfeeblement has given that mastery to me. He knows now the reason for\nhis weakness; I tell it to him too late to harm me.\"\n\nPat struggled for composure. The very presence of the cold demon tore\nat the roots of her self-control, and she suppressed a fierce desire to\nbreak into hysterical laughter. Ridiculous, hopeless, incomprehensible\nsituation! She forced her quivering throat to husky speech.\n\n\"What--what are you?\" she stammered.\n\n\"Synapse! I'm a question of synapses,\" jeered the other. \"Simple! Very\nsimple! Ask your friend the Doctor!\"\n\n\"I think,\" said the girl, a measure of control returning to her voice,\n\"that you're a devil. You're some sort of a fiend that has managed to\nattach itself to Nick, and you're not human. That's what I think!\"\n\n\"Think what you please,\" said the other. \"We're wasting time here,\" he\nsaid abruptly. \"Come.\"\n\n\"Where?\" Pat was startled; she felt a recurrence of fright.\n\n\"No matter where. Come.\"\n\n\"I won't! Why do you want me?\"\n\n\"To complete the business of Saturday night,\" he said. \"Your lips have\nhealed; they bleed no longer, but that is easy to remedy. Come.\"\n\n\"I won't!\" exclaimed the girl in sudden panic. \"I won't!\" She moved as\nif to rise.\n\n\"You forget,\" intoned the being beside her. \"You forget the authority\nvested in me by virtue of this love of yours. Let me convince you.\" He\nstretched forth a thin hand. \"Move and you condemn your sweetheart to\nthe punishment you threaten me.\"\n\nHe seized her arm, pinching the flesh brutally, his nails breaking the\nsmooth skin. Pat felt her face turn ashy pale; she closed her eyes\nand bit her nearly-healed lips at the excruciating pain, but she made\nnot the slightest sound nor the faintest movement. She simply sat and\nsuffered.\n\n\"You see!\" sneered the other, releasing her. \"Thank my kindly nature\nthat I marked your arm instead of your face. Shall we go?\"\n\nA scarcely audible whimper of pain came from the girl's lips. She sat\npalled and unmoving, with her eyes still closed.\n\n\"No,\" she murmured faintly at last. \"No. I won't go with you.\"\n\n\"Shall I drag you?\"\n\n\"Yes. Drag me if you dare.\"\n\nHis hand closed on her wrist; she felt herself jerked violently to her\nfeet, so roughly that it wrenched her shoulder. A startled, frightened\nlittle cry broke from her lips, and then she closed them firmly at the\nsight of several by-passers turning curious eyes on them.\n\n\"I'll come,\" she murmured. The glimmering of an idea had risen in her\nchaotic mind.\n\nShe followed him in grim, bitter silence across the clipped turf to the\nlimit of the park. She recognized Nick's modest automobile standing\nin the line of cars along the street; her companion, or captor, moved\ndirectly towards it, opened the door and clambered in without a single\nbackward glance. He turned about and watched her as she paused with\none diminutive foot on the running board, and rubbed her hand over her\naching arm.\n\n\"Get in!\" he ordered coldly.\n\nShe made no move. \"I want to know where you intend to take me.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter. To a place where we can complete that unfinished\nexperiment of ours. Aren't you happy at the prospect?\"\n\n\"Do you think,\" she said unsteadily, \"that I'd consent to that even to\nsave Nick from disgrace and punishment? Do you think I'm fool enough\nfor that?\"\n\n\"We'll soon see.\" He extended his hand. \"Scream--fight--struggle!\" he\njeered. \"Call them down on your sweetheart!\"\n\nHe had closed his hand on her wrist; she jerked it convulsively from\nhis grasp.\n\n\"I'll bargain with you!\" she gasped. She needed a moment's respite to\nclarify a thought that had been growing in her mind.\n\n\"Bargain? What have you to offer?\"\n\n\"As much as you!\"\n\n\"Ah, but I have a threat--the threat to your sweetheart! And I'm\noffering too the lure of that evil whose face so charmed you recently.\nHave you forgotten how nearly I won you to the worship of that\nprinciple? Have you forgotten the ecstasy of that pain?\"\n\nHis terrible, blood-shot eyes were approaching her face; and strangely,\nthe girl felt a curious recurrence of that illogical desire to yield\nthat had swept over her on that disastrous night of Saturday. There\n_had_ been an ecstasy; there _had_ been a wild, ungodly, unhallowed\npleasure in his blows, in the searing pain of his kisses on her\nlacerated lips. She realized vaguely that she was staring blankly,\ndazedly, into the red eyes, and that somewhere within her, some insane\nbrain-cells were urging her to clamber to the seat beside him.\n\nShe tore her eyes away. She rubbed her bruised shoulder, and the pain\nof her own touch restored her vanishing logical faculties. She returned\nher gaze to the face of the other, meeting his gaze now coolly.\n\n\"Nick!\" she said earnestly, as if calling him from a distance. \"Nick!\"\n\nThere was, she fancied, the faintest gleam of concern apparent in the\nfeatures opposite her. She continued.\n\n\"Nick!\" she repeated. \"You can hear me, Honey. Come to the house as\nsoon as you are able. Come tonight, or any time; I'll wait until you\ndo. You'll come, Honey; you must!\"\n\nShe backed away from the car; the other made no move to halt her. She\ncircled the vehicle and dashed recklessly across the street. From the\nsafety of the opposite walk she glanced back; the red-eyed visage was\nregarding her steadily through the glass of the window.\n\n\n\n\n21\n\nA Question of Synapses\n\n\nPat almost ran the few blocks to her home. She hastened along in a near\npanic, regardless of the glances of pedestrians she chanced to pass.\nWith the disappearance of the immediate urge, the composure for which\nshe had struggled had deserted her, and she felt shaken, terrified,\nand weak. Her arm ached miserably, and her wrenched shoulder pained at\neach movement. It was not until she attained her own door-step that she\npaused, panting and quivering, to consider the events of the evening.\n\n\"I can't stand any more of this!\" she muttered wretchedly to herself.\n\"I'll just have to give up, I guess; I can't pit myself another time\nagainst--that thing.\"\n\nShe leaned wearily against the railing of the porch, rubbing her\ninjured arm.\n\n\"Dr. Carl was right,\" she thought. \"Nick was right; it's dangerous.\nThere was a moment there at the end when he--or it--almost had me. I'm\nfrightened,\" she admitted. \"Lord only knows what might have happened\nhad I been a little weaker. If the Lord _does_ know,\" she added.\n\nShe found her latch-key and entered the house. Only a dim light burned\nin the hall; her mother, of course, was at the Club, and the maid and\nMagda were far away in their chambers on the third floor. She tossed\nher wrap on a chair, switched on a brighter light, and examined the\npainful spot on her arm, a red mark already beginning to turn a nasty\nblue, with two tiny specks of drying blood. She shuddered, and trudged\nwearily up the stairs to her room.\n\nThe empty silence of the house oppressed her. She wanted human\ncompanionship--safe, trustworthy, friendly company, anyone to distract\nher thoughts from the eerie, disturbing direction they were taking.\nShe was still in somewhat of a panic, and suppressed with difficulty a\ndesire to peep fearfully under the bed.\n\n\"Coward!\" she chided herself. \"You knew what to expect.\"\n\nSuddenly the recollection of her parting words recurred to her. She\nhad told Nick--if Nick had indeed heard--to come to the house, to come\nat once, tonight, if he could. A tremor of apprehension ran through\nher. Suppose he came; suppose he came as her own Nick, and she admitted\nhim, and then--or suppose that other came, and managed by some trick to\nenter, or suppose that unholy fascination of his prevailed on her--she\nshivered, and brushed her hand distractedly across her eyes.\n\n\"I can't stand it!\" she moaned. \"I'll have to give up, even if it means\nnever seeing Nick again. I'll have to!\" She shook her head miserably as\nif to deny the picture that had risen in her mind of herself and that\nhorror alone in the house.\n\n\"I won't stay here!\" she decided. She peeped out of the west windows at\nthe Doctor's residence, and felt a surge of relief at the sight of his\niron-gray hair framed in the library window below. He was reading; she\ncould see the book on his knees. There was her refuge; she ran hastily\ndown the stairs and out of the door.\n\nWith an apprehensive glance along the street she crossed to his door\nand rang the bell. She waited nervously for his coming, and, with\na sudden impulse, pulled her vanity-case from her bag and dabbed a\nfilm of powder over the mark on her arm. Then his ponderous footsteps\nsounded and the door opened.\n\n\"Hello,\" he said genially. \"These late evening visits of yours are\nbecoming quite customary--and see if I care!\"\n\n\"May I come in a while?\" asked Pat meekly.\n\n\"Have I ever turned you away?\" He followed her into the library, pushed\na chair forward for her, and dropped quickly into his own with an air\nof having snatched it from her just in time.\n\n\"I didn't want your old arm-chair,\" she remarked, occupying the other.\n\n\"And what's the trouble tonight?\" he queried.\n\n\"I--well, I was just nervous. I didn't want to stay in the house alone.\"\n\n\"You?\" His tone was skeptical. \"You were nervous? That hardly sounds\nreasonable, coming from an independent little spit-fire like you.\"\n\n\"I was, though. I was scared.\"\n\n\"And of what--or whom?\"\n\n\"Of haunts and devils.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" He nodded. \"I see you've had results from your letter-writing.\"\n\n\"Well, sort of.\"\n\n\"I'm used to your circumlocutions, Pat. Suppose you come directly to\nthe point for once. What happened?\"\n\n\"Why, I wrote Nick to get in touch with me, and I got a reply. He said\nto meet him in the park at a place we knew. This evening.\"\n\n\"And you did, of course.\"\n\n\"Yes, but before that, this afternoon, he called up and told me not to,\nbut I insisted and we did.\"\n\n\"Told you not to, eh? And was his warning justified?\"\n\n\"Yes. Oh, yes! When I came to the place, it was--the other.\"\n\n\"So! Well, he could hardly manhandle you in a public park.\"\n\nPat thought of her wrenched shoulder and bruised arm. She shuddered.\n\n\"He's horrible!\" she said. \"Inhuman! He kept referring to Saturday\nnight, and he threatened that if I moved or made a disturbance he'd let\nNick suffer the consequences. So I kept still while he insulted me.\"\n\n\"You nit-wit!\" There was more than a trace of anger in the Doctor's\nvoice. \"I want to see that pup of yours! We'll soon find out what this\nthing is--a mania or simply lack of a good licking!\"\n\n\"What it is?\" echoed Pat. \"Oh--it told me! Dr. Carl, what's a synopsis?\"\n\n\"A synopsis! You know perfectly well.\"\n\n\"I mean applied to physiology or psychology or something. It--he told\nme he was a question of synopsis.\"\n\n\"This devil of yours said that?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Hum!\" The Doctor's voice was musing. He frowned perplexedly, then\nlooked up abruptly. \"Was it--did he by any chance say synapses? Not\nsynopsis--synapses?\"\n\n\"That's it!\" exclaimed the girl. \"He said he was a question of\nsynapses. Does that explain him? Do you know what he is?\"\n\n\"Doesn't explain a damn thing!\" snapped Horker. \"A synapse is a\njuncture, or the meeting of two nerves. It's why you can develop\nautomatic motions and habits, like playing piano, or dancing. When you\nform a habit, the synapses of the nerves involved are sort of worn\nthin, so the nerves themselves are, in a sense, short-circuited. You go\nthrough motions without the need of your brain intervening, which is\nall a habit amounts to. Understand?\"\n\n\"Not very well,\" confessed Pat.\n\n\"Humph! It doesn't matter anyway. I can't see that it helps to analyze\nyour devil.\"\n\n\"I don't care if it's never analyzed,\" said Pat with a return of\ndespondency. \"Dr. Carl, I can't face that evil thing again. I can't do\nit, not even if it means never seeing Nick!\"\n\n\"Sensible,\" said the Doctor approvingly. \"I'd like to have a chance at\nhim, but not enough to keep you in this state of jitters. Although,\" he\nadded, \"a lot of this mystery is the product of your own harum-scarum\nmind. You can be sure of that, Honey.\"\n\n\"You _would_ say so,\" responded the girl wearily. \"You've never seen\nthat--change. If it's my imagination, then I'm the one that needs your\ntreatments, not Nick.\"\n\n\"It isn't _all_ imagination, most likely,\" said Horker defensively. \"I\nknow these introverted types with their hysterias, megalomanias, and\ndefense mechanisms! They've paraded through my office there for a good\nmany years, Pat; they've provided the lion's share of my practice. But\nthis young psychopathic of yours seems to have it bad--abnormally so,\nand that's why I'm so interested, apart from helping you, of course.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" said Pat apathetically, repressing a desire to rub her\ninjured arm. \"I'm through. I'm scared out of the affair. Another week\nlike this last one and I _would_ be one of your patients.\"\n\n\"Best drop it, then,\" said Horker, eyeing her seriously. \"Nothing's\nworth upsetting yourself like this, Pat.\"\n\n\"Nick's worth it,\" she murmured. \"He's worth it--only I just haven't\nthe strength. I haven't the courage. I can't do it!\"\n\n\"Never mind, Honey,\" the Doctor muttered, regarding her with an\nexpression of concern. \"You're probably well out of the mess. I know\ndamn well you haven't told me everything about this affair--notably,\nhow you acquired that ugly mark on your arm that's so carefully\npowdered over. So, all in all, I guess you're well out of it.\"\n\n\"I suppose I am.\" Her voice was still weary. Suddenly the glare of\nheadlights drew her attention to the window; a car was stopping before\nher home. \"There's Mother,\" she said. \"I'll go on back now, Dr. Carl,\nand thanks for entertaining a lonesome and depressed lady.\"\n\nShe rose with a casual glance through the window, then halted in frozen\nastonishment and a trace of terror.\n\n\"Oh!\" she gasped. The car was the modest coupe of Nicholas Devine.\n\nShe peered through the window; the Doctor rose and stared over her\nshoulder. \"I told him to come,\" she whispered. \"I told him to come when\nhe was able. He heard me, he or--the other.\"\n\nA figure alighted from the vehicle. Even in the dusk she could perceive\nthe exhaustion, the weariness in its movements. She pressed her face\nto the pane, surveying the form with fascinated intentness. It turned,\nsupporting itself against the car and gazing steadily at her own door.\nWith the movement the radiance of a street-light illuminated its\nfeatures.\n\n\"It's Nick!\" she cried with such eagerness that the Doctor was\nstartled. \"It's _my_ Nick!\"\n\n\n\n\n22\n\nDoctor and Devil\n\n\nPat rushed to the door, out upon the porch, and down to the street.\nDr. Horker followed her to the entrance and stood watching her as she\ndarted toward the dejected figure beside the car.\n\n\"Nick!\" she cried. \"I'm here, Honey. You heard me, didn't you?\"\n\nShe flung herself into his arms; he held her eagerly, pressing a hasty,\ntender kiss on her lips.\n\n\"You heard me!\" she murmured.\n\n\"Yes.\" His voice was husky, strained. \"What is it, Pat? Tell me\nquickly--God knows how much time we have!\"\n\n\"It's Dr. Carl. He'll help us, Nick.\"\n\n\"Help us! No one can help us, dear. No one!\"\n\n\"He'll try. It can't do any harm, Honey. Come in with me. Now!\"\n\n\"It's useless, I tell you!\"\n\n\"But come,\" she pleaded. \"Come anyway!\"\n\n\"Pat, I tell you this battle has to be fought out by me alone. I'm the\nonly one who can do anything at all and,\" he lowered his voice, \"Pat,\nI'm losing!\"\n\n\"Nick!\"\n\n\"That's why I came tonight. I was too cowardly to make our last\nmeeting--Monday evening in the park--a definite farewell. I wanted to,\nbut I weakened. So tonight, Pat, it's a final good-bye, and you thank\nHeaven for it!\"\n\n\"Oh, Nick dear!\"\n\n\"It was touch and go whether I came at all tonight. It was a struggle,\nPat; _he_ is as strong as I am now. Or stronger.\"\n\nThe girl gazed searchingly into his worn, weary face. He looked\nmiserably ill, she thought; he seemed as exhausted as one who had been\nengaged in a physical battle.\n\n\"Nick,\" she said insistently, \"I don't care what you say, you're coming\nin with me. Only for a little while.\"\n\nShe tugged at his hand, dragging him reluctantly after her. He followed\nher to the porch where the open door still framed the great figure of\nthe Doctor.\n\n\"You know Dr. Carl,\" she said.\n\n\"Come inside,\" growled Horker. Pat noticed the gruffness of his voice,\nhis lack of any cordiality, but she said nothing as she pulled her\nreluctant companion through the door and into the library.\n\nThe Doctor drew up another chair, and Pat, more accustomed to his\ndevices, observed that he placed it in such position that the lamp cast\na stream of radiance on Nick's face. She sank into her own chair and\nwaited silently for developments.\n\n\"Well,\" said Horker, turning his shrewd old eyes on Nick's countenance,\n\"let's get down to cases. Pat's told me what she knows; we can take\nthat much for granted. Is there anything more you might want to tell?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" responded the youth wearily. \"I've told Pat all I know.\"\n\n\"Humph! Maybe I can ask some leading questions, then. Will you answer\nthem?\"\n\n\"Of course, any that I can.\"\n\n\"All right. Now,\" the Doctor's voice took on a cool professional edge,\n\"you've had these--uh--attacks as long as you can remember. Is that\nright?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But they've been more severe of late?\"\n\n\"Much worse, sir!\"\n\n\"Since when?\"\n\n\"Since--about as long as I've known Pat. Four or five weeks.\"\n\n\"M--m,\" droned the Doctor. \"You've no idea of the cause for this\nincrease in the malignancy of the attacks?\"\n\n\"No sir,\" said Nick, after a barely perceptible hesitation.\n\n\"You don't think the cause could be in any way connected with, let us\nsay, the emotional disturbances attending your acquaintance with Pat\nhere?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said the youth flatly.\n\n\"All right,\" said Horker. \"Let that angle go for the present. Are there\nany after effects from these spells?\"\n\n\"Yes. There's always a splitting headache.\" He closed his eyes. \"I have\none of them now.\"\n\n\"Localized?\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Is the pain in any particular region? Forehead, temples, eyes, or so\nforth?\"\n\n\"No. Just a nasty headache.\"\n\n\"But no other after-effects?\"\n\n\"I can't think of any others. Except, perhaps, a feeling of exhaustion\nafter I've gone through what I've just finished.\" He closed his eyes as\nif to shut out the recollection.\n\n\"Well,\" mused the Doctor, \"we'll forget the physical symptoms. What\nhappens to your individuality, your own consciousness, while you're\nsuffering an attack?\"\n\n\"Nothing happens to it,\" said Nick with a suppressed shudder. \"I\nwatch and hear, but what _he_ does is beyond my control. It's\nterrifying--horrible!\" he burst out suddenly.\n\n\"Doubtless,\" responded Horker smoothly. \"What about the other? Does\nthat one stand by while you're in the saddle?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" muttered Nick dully. \"Of course he does!\" he added\nabruptly. \"I can feel his presence at all times--even now. He's always\nlurking, waiting to spring forth, as soon as I relax!\"\n\n\"Humph!\" ejaculated the Doctor. \"How do you manage to sleep?\"\n\n\"By waiting for exhaustion,\" said Nick wearily. \"By waiting until I can\nstay awake no longer.\"\n\n\"And can you bring this other personality into dominance? Can you\nchange controls, so to speak, at will?\"\n\n\"Why--yes,\" the youth answered, hesitating as if puzzled. \"Yes, I\nsuppose I could.\"\n\n\"Let's see you, then.\"\n\n\"But--\" Horror was in his voice.\n\n\"No, Dr. Carl!\" Pat interjected in fright. \"I won't let him!\"\n\n\"I thought you declared yourself out of this,\" said Horker with a\nshrewd glance at the girl.\n\n\"Then I'm back in it! I won't let him do what you want--anyway, not\nthat!\"\n\n\"Pat,\" said the Doctor with an air of patience, \"you want me to treat\nthis affliction, don't you? Isn't that what both of you want?\"\n\nThe girl murmured a scarcely audible assent.\n\n\"Very well, then,\" he proceeded. \"Do you expect me to treat the thing\nblindly--in the dark? Do you think I can guess at the cause without\nobserving the effect?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Pat faintly.\n\n\"So! Now then,\" he turned to Nick, \"Let's see this transformation.\"\n\n\"Must I?\" asked the youth reluctantly.\n\n\"If you want my help.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he agreed with another tremor. He sat passively staring\nat the Doctor; a moment passed. Horker heard Pat's nervous breathing;\nother than that, the room was in silence. Nicholas Devine closed his\neyes, brushed his hand across his forehead. A moment more and he opened\nthem to gaze perplexedly at the Doctor.\n\n\"He won't!\" he muttered in astonishment. \"He won't do it!\"\n\n\"Humph!\" snapped Horker, ignoring Pat's murmur of relief. \"Finicky\ndevil, isn't he? Likes to pick company he can bully!\"\n\n\"I don't understand it!\" Nick's face was blank. \"He's been tormenting\nme until just now!\" He looked at the Doctor. \"You don't think I'm lying\nabout it, do you, Dr. Horker?\"\n\n\"Not consciously,\" replied the other coolly. \"If I thought you were\nresponsible for a few of the indignities perpetrated on Pat here, I'd\nwaste no time in questions, young man. I'd be relieving myself of\ncertain violent impulses instead.\"\n\n\"I _couldn't_ harm Pat!\"\n\n\"You gave a passable imitation of it, then! However, that's beside the\npoint; as I say, I don't hold you responsible for aberrations which I\nbelieve are beyond your control. The main thing is a diagnosis.\"\n\n\"Do you know what it is?\" cut in Pat eagerly.\n\n\"Not yet--at least, not for certain. There's only one real method\navailable; these questions will get us nowhere. We'll have to\npsychoanalyze you, young man.\"\n\n\"I don't care what you do, if you can offer any hope!\" he declared\nvehemently. \"Let's get it over!\"\n\n\"Not as easy as all that!\" rumbled Horker. \"It takes time; and besides,\nit can't be successful with the subject in a hectic mood such as\nyours.\" He glanced at his watch. \"Moreover, it's after midnight.\"\n\nHe turned to Nicholas Devine. \"We'll make it Saturday evening,\"\nhe said. \"Meanwhile, young man, you're not to see Pat. Not at\nall--understand? You can see her here when you come.\"\n\n\"That's infinitely more than I'd planned for myself,\" said the youth in\na low voice. \"I'd abandoned the hope of seeing her.\"\n\nHe rose and moved toward the door, and the others followed. At the\nentrance he paused; he leaned down to plant a brief, tender kiss on\nthe girl's lips, and moved wordlessly out of the door. Pat watched\nhim enter his car, and followed the vehicle with her eyes until it\ndisappeared. Then she turned to Horker.\n\n\"Do you really know anything about it?\" she queried. \"Have you any\ntheory at all?\"\n\n\"He's not lying,\" said the Doctor thoughtfully. \"I watched him closely;\nhe believes he's telling the truth.\"\n\n\"He is. I know what I saw!\"\n\n\"He hasn't the signs of praecox or depressive,\" mused the Doctor. \"It's\npuzzling; it's one of those functional aberrations, or a fixed delusion\nof some kind. We'll find out just what it is.\"\n\n\"It's the devil,\" declared Pat positively. \"I don't care what sort of\nscientific tag you give it--that's what it is. You doctors can hide a\nlot of ignorance under a long name.\"\n\nHorker paid no attention to her remarks. \"We'll see what the\npsychoanalysis brings out,\" he said. \"I shouldn't be surprised if the\nwhole thing were the result of a defense mechanism erected by a timid\nchild in an effort to evade responsibility. That's what it sounds like.\"\n\n\"It's a devil!\" reiterated Pat.\n\n\"Well,\" said the Doctor, \"if it is, it has one thing in common with\nevery spook or devil I ever heard of.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"It refuses to appear under any conditions where one has a chance to\nexamine it. It's like one of these temperamental mediums trying to\nperform under a spot-light.\"\n\n\n\n\n23\n\nWerewolf\n\n\nPat awoke in rather better spirits. Somehow, the actual entrance of Dr.\nHorker into the case gave her a feeling of security, and her natural\noptimistic nature rode the pendulum back from despair to hope. Even the\npainful black-and-blue mark on her arm, as she examined it ruefully,\nfailed to shake her buoyant mood.\n\nHer mood held most of the day; it was only at evening that a recurrence\nof doubt assailed her. She sat in the dim living room waiting the\narrival of her mother's guests, and wondered whether, after all, the\npredicament was as easily solvable as she had assumed. She watched\nthe play of lights and shadows across the ceiling, patterns cast\nthrough the windows by moving headlights in the street, and wondered\nanew whether her faith in Dr. Carl's abilities was justified. Science!\nShe had the faith of her generation in its omnipotence, but here in\nthe dusk, the outworn superstitions of childhood became appalling\nrealities, and some of Magda's stories, forgotten now for years, rose\nout of their graves and went squeaking and maundering like sheeted\nghosts in a ghastly parade across the universe of her mind. The\nmeaningless taunts she habitually flung at Dr. Carl's science became\nsuddenly pregnant with truth; his patient, hard-learned science seemed\nin fact no more than the frenzies of a witch-doctor dancing in the\nheart of a Rhodesian swamp.\n\nWhat was it worth--this array of medical facts--if it failed to\ncure? Was medicine falling into the state of Chinese science--a vast\ncollection of good rules for which the reasons were either unknown or\nlong forgotten? She sighed; it was with a feeling of profound relief\nthat she heard the voices of the Brocks outside; she played miserable\nbridge the whole evening, but it was less of an affliction than the\nsolitude of her own thoughts.\n\nSaturday morning, cloudy and threatening though it was, found the\npendulum once more at the other end of the arc. She found herself, if\nnot buoyantly cheerful, at least no longer prey to the inchoate doubts\nand fears of the preceding evening. She couldn't even recall their\nnature; they had been apart from the cool, day-time logic that preached\na common-sense reliance on accepted practices. They had been, she\nconcluded, no more than childish nightmares induced by darkness and the\nplay of shadows.\n\nShe dressed and ate a late breakfast; her mother was already en route\nto the Club for her bridge-luncheon. Thereafter, she wandered into the\nkitchen for the company of Magda, whom she found with massive arms\nimmersed in dish water. Pat perched on her particular stool beside the\nkitchen table and watched her at her work.\n\n\"Magda,\" she said finally.\n\n\"I'm listening, Miss Pat.\"\n\n\"Do you remember a story you told me a long time ago? Oh, years\nand years ago, about a man in your town who could change into\nsomething--some fierce animal. A wolf, or something like that.\"\n\n\"Oh, him!\" said Magda, knitting her heavy brows. \"You mean the\nwerewolf.\"\n\n\"That's it! The werewolf. I remember it now--how frightened I was after\nI went to bed. I wasn't more than eight years old, was I?\"\n\n\"I couldn't remember. It was years ago, though, for sure.\"\n\n\"What was the story?\" queried Pat. \"Do you remember that?\"\n\n\"Why, it was the time the sheep were being missed,\" said the woman,\npunctuating her words with the clatter of dishes on the drainboard.\n\"Then there was a child gone, and another, and then tales of this great\nwolf about the country. I didn't see him; us little ones stayed under\nroof by darkness after that.\"\n\n\"That wasn't all of it,\" said Pat. \"You told me more than that.\"\n\n\"Well,\" continued Magda, \"there was my uncle, who was best hand with\na rifle in the village. He and others went after the creature, and my\nuncle, he came back telling how he'd seen it plain against the sky, and\nhow he'd fired at it. He couldn't miss, he was that close, but the wolf\ngave him a look and ran away.\"\n\n\"And then what?\"\n\n\"Then the Priest came, and he said it wasn't a natural wolf. He melted\nup a silver coin and cast a bullet, and he gave it to my uncle, he\nbeing the best shot in the village. And the next night he went out once\nmore.\"\n\n\"Did he get it?\" asked Pat. \"I don't remember.\"\n\n\"He did. He came upon it by the pasture, and he aimed his gun. The\ncreature looked straight at him with its evil red eyes, and he shot it.\nWhen he came to it, there wasn't a wolf at all, but this man--his name\nI forget--with a hole in his head. And then the Priest, he said he was\na werewolf, and only a silver bullet could kill him. But my uncle, _he_\nsaid those evil red eyes kept staring at him for many nights.\"\n\n\"Evil red eyes!\" said Pat suddenly. \"Magda,\" she asked in a faint\nvoice, \"could he change any time he wanted to?\"\n\n\"Only by night, the Priest said. By sunrise he had to be back.\"\n\n\"Only by night!\" mused the girl. Another idea was forming in her active\nlittle mind, another conception, disturbing, impossible to phrase. \"Is\nthat worse than being possessed by a devil, Magda?\"\n\n\"Sure it's worse! The Priest, he could cast out the devil, but I never\nheard no cure for being a werewolf.\"\n\nPat said nothing further, but slid from her high perch to the floor and\nwent soberly out of the kitchen. The fears of last night had come to\nlife again, and now the over-cast skies outside seemed a fitting symbol\nto her mood. She stared thoughtfully out of the living room windows,\nand the sudden splash of raindrops against the pane lent a final touch\nto the whole desolate ensemble.\n\n\"I'm just a superstitious little idiot!\" she told herself. \"I laugh\nat Mother because she always likes to play North and South, and here\nI'm letting myself worry over superstitions that were discarded before\nthere was any such thing as a game called contract bridge.\"\n\nBut her arguments failed to carry conviction. The memory of the\nterrible eyes of that _other_ had clicked too aptly to Magda's phrase.\nShe couldn't subdue the picture that haunted her, and she couldn't cast\noff the apprehensiveness of her mood. She recalled gloomily that Dr.\nHorker was at the Club--wouldn't be home before evening, else she'd\nhave gladly availed herself of his solid, matter-of-fact company.\n\nShe thought of Nick's appointment with the Doctor for that evening.\nSuppose his psychoanalysis brought to light some such horror as these\nfears of hers--that would forever destroy any possibility of happiness\nfor her and Nick. Even though the Doctor refused to recognize it,\ncalled it by some polysyllabic scientific name, the thing would be\nthere to sever them.\n\nShe wandered restlessly into the hall. The morning mail, unexamined,\nlay in its brazen receptacle, she moved over, fingering it idly.\nAbruptly she paused in astonishment--a letter in familiar script\nhad flashed at her. She pulled it out; it was! It was a letter from\nNicholas Devine!\n\nShe tore it open nervously, wondering whether he had reverted to his\noriginal refusal of Dr. Horker's aid, whether he was unable to come,\nwhether _that_ had happened. But only a single unfolded sheet slipped\nfrom the envelope, inscribed with a few brief lines of poetry.\n\n    \"The grief that is too faint for tears,\n      And scarcely breathes of pain,\n    May linger on a hundred years\n      Ere it creep forth again.\n    But I, who love you now too well\n      To suffer your disdain,\n    Must try tonight that love to quell--\n      And try in vain!\"\n\n\n\n\n24\n\nThe Dark Other\n\n\nIt was early in the evening, not yet eight o'clock, when Pat saw the\ncar of Nicholas Devine draw up before the house. She had already been\nwatching half an hour, sitting cross-legged in the deep window seat,\nlike her jade Buddha. That equivocal poem of his had disturbed her,\nlent an added strength to the moods and doubts already implanted by\nMagda's mystical tale, and it was with a feeling of trepidation that\nshe watched him emerge wearily from his vehicle and stare in indecision\nfirst at her window and then at the Horker residence. The waning\ndaylight was still sufficient to delineate his worn features; she\ncould see them, pale, harried, but indubitably the mild features of her\nown Nick.\n\nWhile he hesitated, she darted to the door and out upon the porch. He\ngave her a wan smile of greeting, advanced to the foot of the steps,\nand halted there.\n\n\"The Doctor's not home yet,\" she called to him. He stood motionless\nbelow her.\n\n\"Come up on the porch,\" she invited, as he made no move. She uttered\nthe words with a curious feeling of apprehension; for even as she ached\nfor his presence, the uncertain state of affairs was frightening. She\nthought fearfully that what had happened before might happen again.\nStill, there on the open porch, in practically full daylight, and for\nso brief a time--Dr. Carl would be coming very shortly, she reasoned.\n\n\"I can't,\" said Nick, staring wistfully at her. \"You know I can't.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I promised. You remember--I promised Dr. Horker I'd not see you except\nin his presence.\"\n\n\"So you did,\" said Pat doubtfully. The promise offered escape from\na distressing situation, she thought, and yet--somehow, seeing Nick\nstanding pathetically there, she couldn't imagine anything harmful\nemanating from him. There had been many and many evenings in his\ncompany that had passed delightfully, enjoyably, safely. She felt a\nwave of pity for him; after all, the affliction was his, most of the\nsuffering was his.\n\n\"We needn't take it so literally,\" she said almost reluctantly. \"He'll\nbe home very soon now.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Nick soberly, \"but it was a promise, and besides, I'm\nafraid.\"\n\n\"Never mind, Honey,\" she said, after a momentary hesitation. \"Come up\nand sit here on the steps, then--here beside me. We can talk just as\nwell as there on the settee.\"\n\nHe climbed the steps and seated himself, watching Pat with longing\neyes. He made no move to touch her, nor did she suggest a kiss.\n\n\"I read your poem, Honey,\" she said finally. \"It worried me.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Pat. I couldn't sleep. I kept wandering around the house,\nand at last I wrote it and took it out and mailed it. It was a vent, a\nrelief from the things I'd been thinking.\"\n\n\"What things, Honey?\"\n\n\"A way, mostly,\" he answered gloomily, \"of removing myself from your\nlife. A permanent way.\"\n\n\"Nick!\"\n\n\"I didn't, as you see, Pat. I was too cowardly, I suppose. Or perhaps\nit was because of this forlorn hope of ours. There's always hope, Pat;\neven the condemned man with his foot on the step to the gallows feels\nit.\"\n\n\"Nick dear!\" she cried, her voice quavering in pity. \"Nick, you mustn't\nthink of those things! It might weaken you--make it easier for _him_!\"\n\n\"It can't. If it frightens _him_, I'm glad.\"\n\n\"Honey,\" she said soothingly, \"we'll give Dr. Carl a chance. Promise me\nyou'll let him try, won't you?\"\n\n\"Of course I will. Is there anything I'd refuse to promise you, Pat?\nEven,\" he added bitterly, \"when reason tells me it's a futile promise.\"\n\n\"Don't say it!\" she urged fiercely. \"We've got to help him. We've got\nto believe--There he comes!\" she finished with sudden relief.\n\nThe Doctor's car turned up the driveway beyond his residence. Pat saw\nhis face regarding them as he disappeared behind the building.\n\n\"Come on, Honey,\" she said. \"Let's get at the business.\"\n\nThey moved slowly over to the Doctor's door, waiting there until his\nponderous footsteps sounded. A light flashed in the hall, and his broad\nshadow filled the door for a moment before it opened.\n\n\"Come in,\" he rumbled jovially. \"Fine evening we're spoiling, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It could be,\" said Pat as they followed him into the library, \"only\nit'll probably rain some more.\"\n\n\"Hah!\" snorted the Doctor, frowning at the mention of rain. \"The course\nwas soft. Couldn't get any distance, and it added six strokes to my\nscore. At least six!\"\n\nPat chuckled commiseratingly. \"You ought to lay out a course in\nGreenland,\" she suggested. \"They say anyone can drive a ball a quarter\nof a mile on smooth ice.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" The Doctor waved toward a great, low chair. \"Suppose you sit\nover there, young man, and we'll get about our business. And don't look\nso woe-begone about it.\"\n\nNick settled himself nervously in the designated chair; the Doctor\nseated himself at a little distance to the side, and Pat sat tensely in\nher usual place beside the hearth. She waited in strained impatience\nfor the black magic of psychoanalysis to commence.\n\n\"Now,\" said Horker, \"I want you to keep quiet, Pat--if possible. And\nyou, young man, are to relax, compose yourself, get yourself into as\npassive a state as possible. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" The youth leaned back in the great chair, closing his eyes.\n\n\"So! Now, think back to your childhood, your earliest memories. Let\nyour thoughts wander at random, and speak whatever comes to your mind.\"\n\nNick sat a moment in silence. \"That's hard to do, sir,\" he said finally.\n\n\"Yes. It will take practice, weeks of it, perhaps. You'll have to\nacquire the knack of it, but to do that, we'll have to start.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" He sat with closed eyes. \"My mother,\" he murmured, \"was\nkind. I remember her a little, just a little. She was very gentle, not\napt to blame me. She could understand. Made excuses to my father. He\nwas hard, not cruel--strict. Couldn't understand. Blamed me when I\nwasn't to blame. Other did it. I wasn't mischievous, but got the blame.\nCouldn't explain, he wouldn't believe me.\" He paused uncertainly.\n\n\"Go on,\" said Horker quietly, while Pat strained her ears to listen.\n\n\"Mrs. Stevens,\" he continued. \"Governess after Mother died. Strict like\nFather, got punished when I wasn't to blame. Just as bad after Father\ndied. Always blamed. Couldn't explain, nobody believed me. Other threw\ncat in window, I had to go to bed. Put salt in bird seed, broke leg of\nchair to make it fall. Punished--I couldn't explain.\" His voice droned\ninto silence; he opened his eyes. \"That all,\" he said nervously.\n\n\"Good enough for the first time,\" said the Doctor briskly. \"Wait a few\nweeks; we'll have your life's history out of you. It takes practice.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" queried Pat in astonishment.\n\n\"All for the first time. Later we'll let him talk half an hour at a\nstretch, but it takes practice, as I've mentioned. You run along home\nnow,\" he said to Nick.\n\n\"But it's early!\" objected Pat.\n\n\"Early or not,\" said the Doctor, \"I'm tired, and you two aren't to see\neach other except here. You remember that.\"\n\nNick rose from his seat in the depths of the great chair. \"Thank you,\nsir,\" he said. \"I don't know why, but I feel easier in your presence.\nThe--the struggle disappears while I'm here.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Horker with a smile, \"I like patients with confidence in\nme. Good night.\"\n\nAt the door Nick paused, turning wistful eyes on Pat. \"Good night,\" he\nsaid, leaning to give her a light kiss. A rush of some emotion twisted\nhis features; he stared strangely at the girl. \"I'd better go,\" he said\nabruptly, and vanished through the door.\n\n\"Well?\" said Pat questioningly, turning to the Doctor. \"Did you learn\nanything from that?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" the other admitted, yawning. \"However, the results bear out\nmy theory.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Did you notice how he harped on the undeserved punishment theme? He\nwas punished for another's mischief?\"\n\n\"Yes. What of that?\"\n\n\"Well, picture him as a timid, sensitive child, rather afraid of being\npunished. Afraid, say, of being locked up in a dark closet. Now, when\nhe inadvertently commits a mischief, as all children do, he tries\ndesperately to divert the blame from himself. But there's no one else\nto blame! So what does he do?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"He invents this _other_, the mischievous one, and blames him. And\nnow the other has grown to the proportions of a delusion, haunting\nhim, driving him to commit acts apart from his normal inclinations.\nUnderstand? Because I'm off to bed whether you do or not.\"\n\n\"I understand all right,\" murmured Pat uncertainly as she moved to the\ndoor. \"But somehow, it doesn't sound reasonable.\"\n\n\"It will,\" said the Doctor. \"Good night.\"\n\nPat wandered slowly down the steps and through the break in the hedge,\nmusing over Doctor Horker's expression of opinion. Then, according\nto him, the devil was nothing more than an invention of Nick's mind,\nthe trick of a cowardly child to evade just punishment. She shook her\nhead; it didn't sound like Nick at all. For all his gentleness and\nsensitivity, he wasn't the one to hide behind a fabrication. He wasn't\na coward; she was certain of that. And she was as sure as she could\never be that he hated, feared, loathed this personality that afflicted\nhim; he _couldn't_ have created it.\n\nShe sighed, mounted the steps, and fumbled for her key. The sound\nof a movement behind her brought a faint gasp of astonishment. She\nturned to see a figure materializing from the shadows of the porch.\nThe light from the hall fell across its features, and she drew back as\nshe recognized Nicholas Devine--not the being she had just kissed good\nnight, but in the guise of her tormentor, the red-eyed demon!\n\n\n\n\n25\n\nThe Demon Lover\n\n\nPat drew back, leaning against the door, and her key tinkled on the\nconcrete of the porch. She was startled, shocked, but not as completely\nterrified as she might have expected. After all, she thought rapidly,\nthey were standing in full view of a public street, and Dr. Carl's\nresidence was but a few feet distant. She could summon his help by\nscreaming.\n\n\"Well!\" she exclaimed, eyeing the figure inimically. \"Your appearances\nand disappearances are beginning to remind me of the Cheshire Cat.\"\n\n\"Except for the grin,\" said the other in his cold tones.\n\n\"What do you want?\" snapped Pat.\n\n\"You know what I want.\"\n\n\"You'll not get it,\" said the girl angrily. \"You--you're doomed to\nextinction, anyway! Go away!\"\n\n\"Suppose,\" said the other with a strange, cold, twisted smile, \"it were\n_he_ that's doomed to extinction--what then?\"\n\n\"It isn't!\" cried Pat. \"It isn't!\" she repeated, while a quiver of\nuncertainty shook her. \"He's the stronger,\" she said defiantly.\n\n\"Then where is he now?\"\n\n\"Dr. Carl will help us!\"\n\n\"Doctor!\" sneered the other. \"He and his clever theory! Am I an\nillusion?\" he queried sardonically, thrusting his red-glinting eyes\ntoward her. \"Am I the product of his puerile, vacillating nature? Bah!\nI gave you the clue, and your Doctor hasn't the intelligence to follow\nit!\"\n\n\"Go away!\" murmured Pat faintly. The approach of his face had unnerved\nher, and she felt terror beginning to stir within her. \"Go away!\" she\nsaid again. \"Why do you have to torment me? Any one would serve your\npurpose--any woman!\"\n\n\"You have an aesthetic appeal, as I've told you before,\" replied the\nother in that toneless voice of his. \"There is a pleasure in the\ndefacement of black hair and pale skin, and your body is seductive,\nmost seductive. Another might afford me less enjoyment, and besides,\nyou hate me. Don't you hate me?\" He peered evilly at her.\n\n\"Oh, God--yes!\" The girl was shuddering.\n\n\"Say it, then! Say you hate me!\"\n\n\"I hate you!\" the girl cried vehemently. \"Will you go away now?\"\n\n\"With you!\"\n\n\"I'll scream if you come any closer. You don't dare touch me; I'll call\nDr. Horker.\"\n\n\"You'll only damage _him_--your lover.\"\n\n\"Then I'll do it! He'll understand.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the other reflectively. \"He's fool enough to forgive you.\nHe'll forgive you anything--the weakling!\"\n\n\"Go away! Get away from here!\"\n\nThe other stared at her out of blood-shot eyes. \"Very well,\" he said in\nhis flat tones. \"This time the victory is yours.\"\n\nHe backed slowly toward the steps. Pat watched him as he moved, feeling\na surge of profound relief. As his shadow shifted, her key gleamed\nsilver at her feet, and she stooped to retrieve it.\n\nThere was a rush of motion as her eyes left the form of her antagonist.\nA hand was clamped violently over her mouth, an arm passed with\nsteel-like rigidity about her body. Nicholas Devine was dragging her\ntoward the steps; she was half-way down before she recovered her wits\nenough to struggle.\n\nShe writhed and twisted in his grasp. She drove her elbow into his\nbody with all her power, and kicked with the strength of desperation\nat his legs. She bit into the palm across her mouth--and suddenly,\nwith a subdued grunt of pain, he released her so abruptly that her own\nstruggles sent her spinning blindly into the bushes of the hedge.\n\nShe turned gasping, unable for the moment to summon sufficient breath\nto scream. The other stood facing her with his eyes gleaming terribly\ninto her own; then they ranged slowly from her diminutive feet to the\nrumpled ebony of her hair that she was brushing back with her hands\nfrom her pallid, frightened face.\n\n\"Obstinate,\" he observed, rubbing his injured palm.\n\n\"Obstinate and unbroken--but worth the trouble. Well worth it!\" He\nreached out a swift hand, seizing her wrist as she backed against the\nbushes.\n\nPat twisted around, gazing frantically at Doctor Horker's house, where\na light had only now flashed on in the upper windows. Her breath flowed\nback into her lungs with a strengthening rush.\n\n\"Dr. Carl!\" she screamed. \"Dr. Carl! Help me!\"\n\nThe other spun her violently about. She had a momentary glimpse of\na horribly evil countenance, then he drew back his arm and shot a\nclenched fist to her chin.\n\nThe world reeled into a blaze of spinning lights that faded quickly to\ndarkness. She felt her knees buckling beneath her, and realized that\nshe was crumpling forward toward the figure before her. Then for a\nmoment she was aware of nothing.\n\nShe didn't quite lose consciousness, or at least for no more than a\nmoment. She was suddenly aware that she was gazing down at a moving\npavement, at her own arms dangling helplessly toward it. She perceived\nthat she was lying limply across Nicholas Devine's shoulder with his\narms clenched about her knees. And then, still unable to make the\nslightest resistance, she was bundled roughly into the seat of his\ncoupe; he was beside her, and the car was purring into motion.\n\nShe summoned what remained of her strength. She drew herself erect,\nfumbling at the handle of the door with a frantic idea of casting\nherself out of the car to the street. The creature beside her jerked\nher violently back; as she reeled into the seat, he struck her again\nwith the side of his fist. It was a random blow, delivered with\nscarcely a glance at her; it caught her on the forehead, snapping her\nhead with an audible thump against the wall of the vehicle. She swayed\nfor a moment with closing eyes, then collapsed limply against him, this\ntime in complete unconsciousness.\n\nThat lapse too must have been brief. She opened dazed eyes on a vista\nof moving street lights; they were still in the car, passing now along\nsome unrecognized thoroughfare lined with dark old homes. She lay\nfor some moments uncomprehending; she was completely unaware of her\nsituation.\n\nIt dawned on her slowly. She moaned, struggled away from the shoulder\nagainst which she had been leaning, and huddled miserably in the far\ncorner of the seat. Nicholas Devine gave her a single glance with his\nunpleasant eyes, and turned them again on the street.\n\nThe girl was helpless, unable to put forth the strength even for\nanother attempt to open the door. She was still only half aware of her\nposition, and realized only that something appalling was occurring to\nher. She lay in passive misery against the cushions of the seat as the\nother turned suddenly up a dark driveway and into the open door of a\nsmall garage. He snapped off the engine, extinguished the headlights,\nand left them in a horrible, smothering, silent darkness.\n\nShe heard him open the door on his side; after an apparently\ninterminable interval, she heard the creak of the hinges on her own\nside. She huddled terrified, voiceless, and immobile.\n\nHe reached in, fumbling against her in the darkness. He found her arm,\nand dragged her from the car. Again, as on that other occasion, she\nfound herself reeling helplessly behind him through the dark as he\ntugged at her wrist. He paused at a door in the building adjacent to\nthe garage, searching in his pocket with his free hand.\n\n\"I won't go in there!\" she muttered dazedly. The other made no reply,\nbut inserted a key in the lock, turned it, and swung open the door.\n\nHe stepped through it, dragging her after him. With a sudden access of\ndesperate strength, she caught the frame of the door, jerked violently\non her prisoned wrist, and was unexpectedly free. She reeled away,\nturned toward the street, and took a few faltering steps down the\ndriveway.\n\nAlmost instantly her tormentor was upon her, and his hand closed again\non her arm. Pat had no further strength; she sank to the pavement and\ncrouched there, disregarding the insistent tugging on her arm.\n\n\"Come on,\" he growled. \"You only delay the inevitable. Must I drag you?\"\n\nShe made no reply. He tugged violently at her wrist, dragging her a few\ninches along the pavement. Then he stooped over her, raised her in his\narms, and bore her toward the dark opening of the door. He crowded her\nroughly through it, disregarding the painful bumping of her shoulders\nand knees. She heard the slam of the door as he kicked it closed,\nand she realized that they were mounting a flight of stairs, moving\nsomewhere into the oppressive threatening darkness.\n\nThen they were moving along a level floor, and her arm was bruised\nagainst another door. There was a moment of stillness, and then she was\nreleased, dropped indifferently to the surface of a bed or couch. A\nmoment later a light flashed on.\n\nThe girl was conscious at first only of the gaze of the red eyes. They\nheld her own in a fascinating, unbreakable, trance-like spell. Then, in\na wave of dizziness, she closed her own eyes.\n\n\"Where are we?\" she murmured. \"In Hell?\"\n\n\"You should call it Heaven,\" came the sardonic voice. \"It's the home of\nyour sweetheart. His home--and mine!\"\n\n\n\n\n26\n\nThe Depths\n\n\n\"Heaven and Hell always were the same place,\" said Nicholas Devine, his\nred eyes glaring down at the girl. \"We'll demonstrate the fact.\"\n\nPat shifted wearily, and sat erect, passing her hand dazedly across her\nface. She brushed the tangled strands of black hair from before her\neyes, and stared dully at the room in which she found herself.\n\nIt had some of the aspects of a study, and some of a laboratory, or\nperhaps a doctor's office. There was a case of dusty books on the wall\nopposite, and another crystal-fronted cabinet containing glassware,\nbottles, little round boxes suggestive of drugs or pharmaceuticals.\nThere was a paper-littered table too; she gave a convulsive shudder at\nthe sight of a bald, varnished death's head, its lower jar articulated,\nthat reposed on a pile of papers and grinned at her.\n\n\"Where--\" she began faintly.\n\n\"This was the room of your sweetheart's father,\" said the other. \"His\nand my mutual father. He was an experimenter, a researcher, and so, in\nanother sense, am I!\" He leered evilly at her. \"He used this chamber\nto further his experiments, and I for mine--the carrying on of a noble\nfamily tradition!\"\n\nThe girl scarcely heard his words; the expressionless tone carried no\nmeaning to the chaos which was her mind. She felt only an inchoate\nhorror and a vague but all-encompassing fear, and her head was aching\nfrom the blows he had dealt her.\n\n\"What do you want?\" she asked dully.\n\n\"Why, there is an unfinished experiment. You must remember our\ninterrupted proceedings of a week ago! Have you already forgotten the\nearly steps of our experiment in evil?\"\n\nPat cringed at the cold, sardonic tones of the other. \"Let me go,\" she\nwhimpered. \"Please!\" she appealed. \"Let me go!\"\n\n\"In due time,\" he responded. \"You lack gratitude,\" he continued. \"Last\ntime, out of the kindness that is my soul, I permitted you to dull your\nsenses with alcohol, but you failed, apparently, to appreciate my\nindulgence. But this time\"--His eyes lit up queerly--\"this time you\napproach the consummation of our experiment with undimmed mind!\"\n\nHe approached her. She drew her knees up, huddling back on the couch,\nand summoned the final vestiges of her strength.\n\n\"I'll kick you!\" she muttered desperately. \"Keep back from me!\"\n\nHe paused just beyond her reach. \"I had hoped,\" he said ironically, \"if\nnot for your cooperation, at least for no further active resistance.\nIt's quite useless; I told you days ago that this time would come.\"\n\nHe advanced cautiously; Pat thrust out her foot, driving it with all\nher power. Instantly he drew back, catching her ankle in his hand. He\njerked her leg sharply upwards, and she was precipitated violently to\nthe couch. Again he advanced.\n\nThe girl writhed away from him. She slipped from the foot of the couch\nand darted in a circle around him, turning in an attempt to gain the\nroom's single exit--the door by which they had entered. He moved\nquickly to intercept her; he closed the door as she backed despairingly\naway, retreating to the far end of the room. Once more he faced her,\nhis malicious eyes gleaming, and moved deliberately toward her.\n\nShe drew back until the table halted her; she pressed herself against\nit as if to force her way still further. The other moved at unaltered\npace. Suddenly her hand pressed over some smooth, round, hard object;\nshe grasped it and flung the grinning skull at the more terrible\nface that approached her. He dodged; there was a crash of glass as\nthe gruesome missile shattered the pane of the cabinet of drugs. And\ninexorably, Nicholas Devine approached once more.\n\nShe moved along the edge of the table, squeezed herself between it and\nthe wall. Behind her was one of the room's two windows, curtainless,\nwith drawn shades. She found the cord, jerked it, and let the blind\ncoil upward with an abrupt snap.\n\n\"I'll throw myself through the window!\" she announced with a sort of\ndesperate calm. \"Don't dare move a step closer!\"\n\nThe demon paused once more in his deliberate advance. \"You will, of\ncourse,\" he said as if considering. \"Given the opportunity. Your body\ntorn and broken, spotted with blood--that might be a pleasure second\nonly to that I plan.\"\n\n\"You'll suffer for it!\" said the girl hysterically. \"I'll be glad to do\nit, knowing you'll suffer!\"\n\n\"Not I--your sweetheart.\"\n\n\"I don't care! I can't stand it!\"\n\nThe other smiled his demoniac smile, and resumed his advance. She\nwatched him in terror that had now reached the ultimate degree; her\nmind could bear no more. She turned suddenly, raised her arm, and beat\nher fist against the pane of the window.\n\nWith the surprising resistance glass sometimes displays, it shook at\nher blow but did not shatter. She drew back for a second attempt,\nand her upraised arm was caught in a rigid grip, and she was dragged\nbackward to the center of the room, thrown heavily to the floor. She\nsat dazedly looking up at the form standing over her.\n\n\"Must I render you helpless again?\" queried the flat voice of the\nother. \"Are you not yet broken, convinced of the uselessness of this\nstruggle?\"\n\nShe made no answer, staring dully at his immobile features.\n\n\"Are you going to fight me further?\" As she was still silent, he\nrepeated, \"Are you?\"\n\nShe shook her head vaguely. \"No,\" she muttered. She had reached the\npoint of utter indifference; nothing at all was important enough now to\nstruggle for.\n\n\"Stand up!\" ordered the being above her.\n\nShe pulled herself wearily to her feet, leaning against the wall. She\nclosed her eyes for a moment, then opened them dully as the other moved.\n\n\"What--are you--are you going to do?\" she murmured.\n\n\"First,\" said the demon coldly, \"I shall disrobe you somewhat more\ncompletely than on our other occasion. Thereafter we will proceed to\nthe consummation of our experiment.\"\n\nShe watched him indifferently, uncomprehendingly, as he crooked a thin\nfinger in the neck of her frock. She felt the pressure as he pulled,\nheard the rip of the fabric, and the pop of buttons, but she was\nconscious of no particular sensation as the garment cascaded into a\nblack and red pool at her feet. She stood passive as he hooked his\nfinger in the strap of her vest, and that too joined the little mound\nof cloth. She shivered slightly as she stood bared to the waist, but\ngave no other sign.\n\nAgain the thin hand moved toward her; from somewhere in her tormented\nspirit a final shred of resistance arose, and she pushed the questing\nmember feebly to one side. She heard a low, sardonic laugh from her\noppressor.\n\n\"Look at me!\" he commanded.\n\nShe raised her eyes wearily; she drew her arm about her in a forlorn\ngesture of concealment. Her eyes met the strange orbs of the other, and\na faint thrill of horror stirred; other than this, she felt nothing.\nThen his eyes were approaching her; she was conscious of the illusion\nthat they were expanding, filling all the space in front of her. Their\nweird glow filled the world, dominated everything.\n\n\"Will you yield?\" he queried.\n\nThe eyes commanded. \"Yes,\" she said dully.\n\nShe felt his hands icy cold on her bare shoulders. They traveled like a\nshudder about her body, and suddenly she was pressed close to him.\n\n\"Are you mine?\" he demanded. For the first time there was a tinge of\nexpression in the toneless voice, a trace of eagerness. She made no\nanswer; her eyes, held by his, stared like the eyes of a person in a\ntrance, unwinking, fascinated.\n\n\"Are you mine?\" he repeated, his breath hissing on her cheek.\n\n\"Yes.\" She heard her own voice in automatic reply to his question.\n\n\"Mine--for the delights of evil?\"\n\n\"Yours!\" she murmured. The eyes had blotted out everything.\n\n\"And do you hate me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe arms about her tightened into crushing bands. The pressure\nstopped her breath; her very bones seemed to give under their fierce\ncompression.\n\n\"Do you hate me?\" he muttered.\n\n\"Yes!\" she gasped. \"Yes! I hate you!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" He twisted his hand in her black hair, wrenching it roughly back.\n\"Are you ready now for the consummation? To look upon the face of evil?\"\n\nShe made no reply. Her eyes, as glassy as those of a sleep-walker,\nstared into his.\n\n\"Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\nHe pressed his mouth to hers. The fierceness of the kiss bruised her\nlips, the pull of his hand in her hair was a searing pain, the pressure\nof his arm about her body was a suffocation. Yet--somehow--there was\nagain the dawning of that unholy pleasure--the same degraded delight\nthat had risen in her on that other occasion, in the room of the\nred-checked table cloth. Through some hellish alchemy, the leaden pain\nwas transmuting itself into the garish gold of a horrible, abnormal\npleasure. She found her crushed lips attempting a feeble, painful\nresponse.\n\nAt her movement, she felt herself swung abruptly from her feet. With\nhis lips still crushing hers, he raised her in his arms; she felt\nherself borne across the room. He paused; there was a sudden release,\nand she crashed to the hard surface of the couch, whose rough covering\nscratched the bare flesh of her back. Nicholas Devine bent over her;\nshe saw his hand stretch toward her single remaining garment. And\nagain, from somewhere in her harassed soul, a spark of resistance\nflashed.\n\n\"Nick!\" she moaned. \"Oh, Nick! Help me!\"\n\n\"Call him!\" said the other, a sneer on his face. \"Call him! He hears;\nit adds to his torment!\"\n\nShe covered her eyes with her hands. She felt his hand slip coldly\nbetween her skin and the elastic about her waist.\n\n\"Nick!\" she moaned again. \"Nick! Oh, my God! Nick!\"\n\n\n\n\n27\n\nTwo in Hell\n\n\nThe cold hand against Pat was still; she felt it rigid and stiff on\nher flesh. She lay passive with closed eyes; having voiced her final\nappeal, she was through. The words torn from her misery represented\nthe final iota of spirit remaining to her; and her bruised body and\nbattered mind had nothing further to give.\n\nThe hand quivered and withdrew. For a moment more she lay motionless\nwith her arms clutched about her, then she opened her eyes, gazing\ndully, hopelessly at the demon standing over her. He was watching her\nwith a curious abstracted frown; as she stirred, the scowl intensified,\nand he drew back a step.\n\nHis face contorted suddenly in a spasm of some unguessable emotion.\nHis fists clenched; a low unintelligible mutter broke from his lips.\n\"Strange!\" she heard him say, and after a moment, \"I'm still master\nhere!\"\n\nHe _was_ master; in a moment the emotion vanished, and he was again\nstanding over her, his face the same impassive demoniac mask. She\nwatched him in a dull stupor of despair that was too deep for even a\nwhimper of pain as he wrenched at the elastic about her waist, and it\ncut into her flesh and parted. He tore the garment away, and the red\neyes bored down with a wild elation in their depths.\n\n\"Mine!\" the being muttered, a new hoarseness in his voice. \"Are you\nmine?\"\n\nPat made no answer; his voice croaked in more insistent tones. \"Are you\nmine?\"\n\nShe could not reply. She felt his fingers bite into the flesh of her\nshoulder. She was shaken roughly, violently, and the question came\nagain, fiercely. The eyes flamed in command, and she felt through\nher languor and weakness, the stirring of that strange and unholy\nfascination that he held over her.\n\n\"Answer!\" he croaked. \"Are you mine?\"\n\nThe torture of his searing grip on her shoulder wrung an answer from\nher.\n\n\"Yes,\" she murmured faintly. \"Yours.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes again in helpless resignation. She felt the\nhand withdrawn, and she lay passive, waiting, on the verge of\nunconsciousness, numb, spirit-broken, and beaten.\n\nNothing happened. After a long interval she opened her eyes, and saw\nthe other standing again with clenched fists and contorted countenance.\nHis features were writhing in the intensity of his struggle; a strange\nlow snarl came from his lips. He backed away from her, step by step; he\nleaned against the book-shelves, and beads of perspiration formed on\nhis scowling face.\n\nHe was no longer master! She saw the change; imperceptibly the evil\nvanished from his features, and suddenly they were no longer his,\nbut the weary, horror-stricken visage of her Nick! The red eyes were\nno longer Satanic, but only the blood-shot, troubled, gentle eyes of\nher sweetheart, and the lips had lost their grimness, and gasped and\nquivered and trembled. He reeled against the wall, staggered to the\nchair at the table, and sank weakly into it.\n\nPat was far too exhausted, far too dazed, to feel anything but the\nfaintest sensation of relief. She realized only dimly that tears were\nwelling from her eyes, and that sharp sobs were shaking her. She was\nfor the moment unable to stir, and it was not long until the being at\nthe table turned stricken eyes on her that she moved. Then she drew\nher knees up before her, as if to hide her body behind their slim,\nchiffon-clad grace.\n\nNick rose from the table, approaching her with weary, hesitant tread.\nHe seized a cover of some sort that was folded over the foot of the\ncouch, shook it out and cast it over her. She clutched it about her\nbody, sat erect and leaned back against the wall in utter exhaustion.\nMany minutes passed with no word from either of the occupants of the\nunholy chamber. It was Nick who broke the long silence.\n\n\"Pat,\" he murmured in low tones. \"Pat--Dear. Are you--all right?\"\n\nShe stared at him dazedly without answer.\n\n\"Honey!\" he said. \"Honey! Tell me you're all right!\"\n\n\"All right?\" she repeated uncomprehendingly. \"Yes. I guess I'm all\nright.\"\n\n\"Then go, Pat! Get away from here before he--before anything happens!\nPut your clothes on and hurry away!\"\n\n\"I can't!\" she said, faintly. \"I--can't!\"\n\n\"You must, Honey!\"\n\n\"I'm just--not able to. I will soon, Nick--honest. When I--when I get\nmy breath back.\"\n\n\"Pat!\" There was anguish in the cry. \"Oh, God--Pat! We mustn't ever be\ntogether again--not ever!\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. A bit of sanity was returning to her; comprehension of\nher position sent a shudder through her. \"No, we mustn't.\"\n\n\"I couldn't bear another night like this--watching! I'd go mad!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she choked, tears starting. \"If you hadn't come back, Nick!\"\n\n\"I conquered him,\" he said. \"I don't think I could do it again. It was\nyour call that gave me the strength, Pat.\" He shook his head as if\nbewildered. \"He thought it was being in love with you that weakened me,\nbut in the end it was that which gave me the strength to subdue him.\"\n\n\"I'm scared!\" said the girl suddenly. \"Oh, Nick! I'm frightened!\"\n\n\"You'd better go. You'd better dress and leave at once, Honey. Here.\"\nHe gathered her clothes from the floor, depositing them beside her on\nthe couch. \"There are pins in the tray on the table, Pat. Fix yourself\nup as well as you can, dear--and hurry out of here!\"\n\nHe turned toward the door as if to leave, and a shock of terror shook\nher.\n\n\"Nick!\" she cried. \"Don't go away! I'm more afraid when I can't see\nyou--afraid that _he_--\" She broke off sobbing.\n\n\"All right, Honey. I'll turn my back.\"\n\nShe slipped out from under the blanket, found the pins, and repaired\nher ruined costume. The frock was torn, crushed and bedraggled; she\npinned it together at the throat, though her trembling fingers made the\ntask difficult. She pulled it on and took a tentative step toward the\ndoor.\n\n\"Nick!\" she called as a wave of dizziness sent her swaying against the\nwall.\n\n\"What's the matter, Honey?\" He turned anxiously at her cry.\n\n\"I'm dizzy,\" she moaned. \"My head aches, and--I'm scared!\"\n\n\"Pat, darling! You can't go out alone like this--and,\" he added\nmiserably, \"I can't take you!\" He slipped his arm around her tenderly,\nsupporting her to the couch. \"Honey, what'll we do?\"\n\n\"I'll be--all right,\" she murmured. \"I'll go in a moment.\" The\ndizziness was leaving her; strength was returning.\n\n\"You must!\" he said dolefully. \"What a parting, Pat! Never to see you\nagain, and then having this to remember as farewell!\"\n\n\"I know, Nick. You see, I love you too.\" She turned her dark, troubled\neyes on him. \"Honey, kiss me good-bye! We'll have that to remember,\nanyway!\" Tears were again on her cheeks.\n\n\"Do I dare?\" he asked despondently. \"After the things these lips of\nmine have said, and what these arms have done to you?\"\n\n\"But you didn't, Nick! Could I blame you for--that _other_?\"\n\n\"God! You're kind, Pat! Honey, if ever I win out in this battle, if\never I know I'm the final victor, I'll--No,\" he said his tones dropping\nabruptly. \"I'll never come back to you, Pat. It's far too dangerous,\nand--can I ever be certain? Can I?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Nick. Can you?\"\n\n\"I can't be, Pat! I'll never be sure that _he_ isn't just dormant, as\nhe was before, waiting for my weakness to betray me! I'll never be\ncertain, Honey! It _has_ to be good-bye!\"\n\n\"Then kiss me!\"\n\nShe clung to him; the room that had been so recently a chamber of\nhorrors was transformed. As she held him, as her lips were pressed to\nhis, she thought suddenly of the words of the demon, that Heaven and\nHell were always the same place. They had taken on a new meaning, those\nwords; she drew away from Nick and turned her tear-bright eyes tenderly\non his.\n\n\"Honey,\" she murmured, \"I don't want you to leave me. I don't want you\nto go!\"\n\n\"Nor do I want to, Pat! But I must.\"\n\n\"You mustn't! You're to stay, and we'll fight it out together--be\nmarried, or any way that permits us to fight it through together.\"\n\n\"Pat! Do you think I'd consent to that?\"\n\n\"Nick,\" she said. \"Nick darling--It's worth it to me! I'm realizing it\nnow; I thought it wasn't--but it is! I can't lose you, Nick--anything,\neven that _other_, is better than losing you.\"\n\n\"You're sweet, Pat! You know I'd trade my very soul for that, but--No.\nI can't do it! And don't Honey, torture me by suggesting it again.\"\n\n\"But I will, Nick!\" She was speaking softly, earnestly. \"You're worth\nanything to me! If _he_ should kill me, you'd still be worth it!\" She\ngazed tenderly at him. \"I'd want to die anyway without you!\"\n\n\"No more than I without you,\" he muttered brokenly. \"But I won't do it,\nPat! I won't do that to you!\"\n\n\"I love you, Nick!\" she said in a low voice. \"I don't want to live\nwithout you. Do you understand me, dear? I don't want to live without\nyou!\"\n\nHe stared at her somberly. \"I've thought of that too,\" he said.\n\"Pat--if I only believed that we'd be together after, together\n_anywhere_, I'd say yes. If only I believed there _were_ an afterwards!\"\n\n\"Doesn't he prove that by his very existence?\"\n\n\"Your Doctor would deny that.\"\n\n\"Doctor Carl never saw _him_, Nick. And anyway, even oblivion together\nwould be better than being separated, and far better than this!\"\n\nHe gazed at her silently. She spoke again. \"That doesn't frighten me,\nNick. It's only losing you that frightens me, especially the fear of\nlosing you to _him_.\"\n\nHe continued his silent gaze. Suddenly he drew her close to him, held\nher in a tight, tender embrace.\n\n\n\n\n28\n\nLunar Omen\n\n\nAfter a considerable interval, during which Nick held the girl tightly\nand silently in his arms, he released her, sat with his head resting\non his cupped palms in an attitude of deep study. Pat, beside him,\nfell mechanically to repinning the throat of her frock, which had\nopened during the moments of the embrace. He rose to his feet, pacing\nnervously before her.\n\n\"It isn't a thing to do on the impulse of a moment, Pat,\" he muttered,\npausing at her side. \"You must see that.\"\n\n\"It isn't the impulse of a moment.\"\n\n\"But one doesn't abandon everything, the whole world, so easily,\nHoney. One doesn't cast away a last hope, however forlorn a hope it may\nbe!\"\n\n\"Is there a hope, Nick?\" she asked gently. \"Is there a chance left to\nus?\"\n\n\"I don't know!\" His voice held an increasing tenseness. \"Before\nGod--I--don't know!\"\n\n\"If there's a chance, the very slightest shadow of the specter of a\nchance, we'll take it, won't we? Because the other way is always open\nto us, Nick.\"\n\n\"Yes. It's always open.\"\n\n\"But we won't take that chance,\" she continued defiantly, \"if it\ninvolves my losing you, Honey. I meant what I said, Nick: I don't want\nto live without you!\"\n\n\"What chance have we?\" he queried somberly. \"Those are our\nalternatives--life apart, death together.\"\n\n\"Then you know my choice!\" she cried desperately. \"Nick, Honey--don't\nlet's draw it out in futile talking! I can't stand it!\"\n\nHe moved his hand in a gesture of bewilderment and frustration, and\nturned away, striding nervously toward the window whose blind she had\nraised. He leaned his hands on the table, peering dejectedly out upon\nthe street below.\n\n\"What time,\" he asked irrelevantly in a queer voice, \"did the Doctor\nsay the moon rose? Do you remember?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said tensely. \"Oh, Honey! Please--don't stand there with your\nback to me now, when I'm half crazy!\"\n\n\"I'm thinking,\" he responded. \"It rises a little earlier each night--or\nis it later? No matter; come here, Pat.\"\n\nShe rose wearily and joined him; he slipped his arm about her, and drew\nher against him.\n\n\"Look there,\" he said, indicating the night-dark vista beyond the\nwindow.\n\nShe looked out upon a dim-lit street or court, at the blind end of\nwhich the house was apparently situated. Far off at the open end,\nacross a distant highway where even at this hour passed a constant\nstream of traffic, flashed a narrow strip of lake; and above it, rising\ngigantic from the coruscating moon-path, lifted the satellite. She\nwatched the remote flickering of the waves as they tossed back the\nbroken bits of the light strewn along the path. Then she turned puzzled\neyes on her companion.\n\n\"That's Heaven,\" he said pointing a finger at the great flowing lunar\ndisk. \"There's a world that never caught the planet-cancer called Life,\nor if it ever suffered, it's cured. It's clean--burned clean by the\nsun and scoured clean by the airless zero of space. A dead world, and\ntherefore not an unhappy one.\"\n\nThe girl stared at him without comprehension. She murmured, \"I don't\nunderstand, Nick.\"\n\n\"Don't you, Pat?\" He pointed again at the moon. \"That's Heaven, the\ndead world, and this is Hell, the living one. Heaven and Hell swinging\nforever about their common center!\" He gestured toward the sparkling\nmoon-path on the water. \"Look, Pat! The dead world strews flowers on\nthe grave of the living one!\"\n\nSome of his bitter ecstasy caught the girl; she felt his somber mood of\nexaltation.\n\n\"I love you, Nick!\" she whispered, pressing closely to him.\n\n\"What difference does it make--our actions?\" he queried. \"There's the\nomen, that lifeless globe in the sky. Where we go, all humanity now\nliving will follow before a century, and in a million years, the human\nrace as well! What if we go a year or a million years before the rest?\nWill it make any difference in the end?\" He looked down at her. \"All\nwe've been valuing here is hope. To the devil with hope! Let's have\npeace instead!\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid, Nick.\"\n\n\"Nor I. And if we go, _he_ goes, and he's mortally afraid of death!\"\n\n\"Can he--prevent you?\"\n\n\"Not now! I'm the stronger now. For this time, I'm master.\"\n\nHe turned again to stare at the glowing satellite as it rose\nimperceptibly from the horizon. \"There's nothing to regret,\" he\nmurmured, \"except one thing--the loss of beauty. Beauty like that--and\nlike you, Pat. That's bitterly hard to foreswear!\" He leaned forward\ntoward the remote disk of the moon; he spoke as if addressing it, in\ntones so low that the girl, pressed close to him, had to quiet the\nsound of her own breath to listen. He said:\n\n    \"Long miles above cloud-bank and blast,\n      And many miles above the sea,\n    I watch you rise majestically\n      Feeling your chilly light at last--\n    Cold beauty in the way you cast\n      Split silver fragments on the waves,\n    As if this planet's life were past,\n      And all men peaceful in their graves.\"\n\nPat was silent for a moment as he paused, then she murmured a low\nphrase. \"Oh, I love you, Nick!\" she said.\n\n\"And I you, dear,\" he responded. \"Have we decided anything? Are\nwe--going through with it?\"\n\n\"I've not faltered,\" she said soberly. \"I meant it, Nick. Without you,\nlife would be as empty as that airless void you speak of. I'm not\nafraid. What's there to be afraid of?\"\n\n\"Only the transition, Pat. That and the unknown--but no situation could\npossibly be more terrible than our present one. It _couldn't_ be!\nOblivion, annihilation--they're preferable, aren't they?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! Nothing I can imagine could be other than a change for the\nbetter.\"\n\n\"Then let's face it!\" His voice took on a note of determination. \"I've\nthought to face it a dozen times before this, and each time I've\nhesitated. The hesitation of a coward, Pat.\"\n\n\"You're no coward, dear. It was that illusion of hope; that always\nweakens one. No one's strong who hasn't given up hope.\"\n\n\"Then,\" he repeated, \"let's face it!\"\n\n\"How, Nick?\"\n\n\"My father has left us the means. There in the cabinet are a hundred\ndeaths--swift ones, lingering ones, painful, and easy! I don't know one\nfrom the other; our choice must be blind.\" He strode over to the case,\nsending slivers of glass from the shattered front glistening along\nthe floor. \"I'd choose an easy one, Dear, if I knew, for your sake.\nEuthanasia!\"\n\nHe stared hesitantly at the files of mysterious drugs with their\nincomprehensible labels.\n\nSuddenly the scene appeared humorous to the girl, queerly funny, in\nsome unnatural horrible fashion. Her nerves, overstrained for hours,\nwere on the verge of breaking; without realization of it, she had come\nto the border of hysteria.\n\n\"Shopping for death!\" she choked, trying to suppress the wild laughter\nthat beat in her throat. \"Which one's most suitable? Which one's most\nbecoming? Which one\"--an hysterical laughing sob shook her--\"will wear\nthe longest?\"\n\nHe turned, gazing at her with an illogical concern in his face.\n\n\"What's the difference?\" she cried wildly. \"I don't care--painful or\npleasant, it all ends in the same grave! Close your eyes and choose!\"\n\nSuddenly he was holding her in his arms again, and she was sobbing,\nclinging to him frantically. She was miserably unstrung; her body\nshook under the impact of her gasping breath. Then gradually, she\nquieted, and was silent against him.\n\n\"We've been mad!\" he murmured. \"It's been an insane idea--for me to\ninflict this on you, Pat. Do you think I could consider the destruction\nof your beauty, Dear? I've been lying to myself, stifling my judgment\nwith poetic imagery, when all the while it was just that I'm afraid to\nface the thing alone!\"\n\n\"No,\" she murmured, burying her face against his shoulder. \"I'm the\ncoward, Nick. I'm the one that's frightened, and I'm the one that broke\ndown! It's just been--too much, this evening; I'm all right now.\"\n\n\"But we'll not go through with _this_, Pat!\"\n\n\"But we will! It's better than life without you, Dear. We've argued and\nargued, and at last forgotten the one truth, the one thing I'll never\nretract: I can't face living without you, Nick! I can't!\"\n\nHe brushed his hand wearily before his eyes. \"Back at the starting\npoint,\" he muttered. \"All right, Honey. So be it!\"\n\nHe strode again to the cabinet. \"Corrosive sublimate,\" he murmured.\n\"Cyanide of Potassium. They're both deadly, but I think the second is\nrapid, and therefore less painful. Cyanide let it be!\"\n\nHe extracted two small beakers from the glassware on the shelf. He\nfilled them with water from a carafe on the table, and, while the girl\nwatched him with fascinated eyes, he deliberately tilted a spoonful or\nso of white crystals into each of them. The mixture swirled a moment,\nthen settled clear and colorless, and the crystals began to shrink as\nthey passed swiftly into solution.\n\n\"There it is,\" he announced grimly. \"There's peace, oblivion,\nforgetfulness, and annihilation for you, for me, and--for _him_! Beyond\nall doubt, the logical course for us, isn't it? Do we take it?\"\n\n\"Please,\" she said faintly. \"Kiss me first, Honey. Isn't that the\nproper course for lovers in this situation?\" She felt a faint touch of\nastonishment at her own irony; the circumstances had ceased to have\nany reality to her, and had become merely a dramatic sequence like the\nhappenings in a play.\n\nHe gathered her again into his arms and pressed his lips to hers. It\nwas a long, tender, wistful kiss; when at last it ended, Pat found her\neyes again filled with tears, but not this time the tears of hysteria.\n\n\"Nick!\" she murmured. \"Nick, darling!\"\n\nHe gave her a deep, somber, but very tender smile, and reached for one\nof the deadly beakers, \"To another meeting!\" he said as his fingers\nclosed on it.\n\nSuddenly, amazingly, the strident ring of a doorbell sounded, the more\nsurprising since they had all but forgotten the existence of a world\nabout them. Interruption! It meant only the going through once more of\nall that they had just passed.\n\n\"Drink it!\" exclaimed Pat impulsively, seizing the remaining beaker.\n\n\n\n\n29\n\nScopolamine for Satan\n\n\nThe glass was struck from Pat's hand, and the water-clear contents\nstreamed into pools and darkening blots over the table and its litter\nof papers. She stared unseeingly at the mess, without realizing\nthat it was Nick who had dashed the draught from her very lips. She\nfelt neither anger nor relief, but only a numbness, and a sense of\nanti-climax. Somewhere below the bell was ringing again, and a door was\nresounding to violent blows, but she only continued her bewildered,\nquestioning gaze.\n\n\"I can't let you, Pat!\" he muttered, answering her unspoken query.\n\n\"But Nick--why?\"\n\n\"There's somebody at the door, isn't there? Mustn't we find out who?\"\n\n\"What difference can it make?\" she asked wearily.\n\n\"I don't know. I want to find out.\"\n\n\"It's that illusion of hope again,\" she murmured. \"That's all it is,\nNick--and it means now that it's all to do over again! The whole thing,\nfrom the beginning--and we were so near--the end!\"\n\n\"I know,\" he said miserably. \"I know all that, but--\" He paused as the\ninsistent racket below was redoubled. \"I'm going to answer that bell,\"\nhe ended.\n\nHe moved away from her, vanishing through the room's single door. She\nwatched his disappearance without moving, but no sooner had he passed\nfrom sight than a curious feeling of fear oppressed her. She cast off\nthe numbness and languor, and darted after him into the darkness of the\nhall.\n\n\"Nick!\" she called. Somewhere ahead a light flashed on; she saw the\nwell of a stair-case, and heard his footsteps descending. She followed\nin frantic haste, gaining the top step just as the pounding below\nceased. She heard the click of the door, and paused suddenly at the\nsound of a familiar voice.\n\n\"Where's Pat?\" The words drifted up in low, rumbling, ominous tones.\n\n\"Dr. Carl!\" she shrieked. She ran swiftly down the stairs to Nick's\nside, where he stood facing the great figure of the Doctor. \"Dr. Carl!\nHow'd you find me?\"\n\nThe newcomer gave her a long, narrow-eyed, speculative survey. \"I\nspent nearly the whole night doing it,\" he growled at last. \"It took\nme hours to locate Mueller and get this address from him.\" He stepped\nforward, taking the girl's arm. \"Come on!\" he said gruffly, without a\nglance at Nick standing silently beside her. \"I'm taking you home!\"\n\nShe held back. \"But why?\"\n\n\"Why? Because I don't like the company you keep. Is that reason enough?\"\n\nShe still resisted his insistent tug. \"Nick hasn't done anything,\" she\nsaid defiantly, with a side glance at the youth's flushed, unhappy\nfeatures.\n\n\"He hasn't? Look at yourself, girl! Look at your clothes, and your\nforehead! What's more, I saw enough from my window; I saw him bundle\nyou into that car!\" His eyes were flashing angrily, and his grip on her\narm tightened, while his free hand clenched into an enormous fist.\n\n\"That wasn't Nick!\"\n\n\"No. It was your devil, I suppose!\" said Horker sarcastically. \"Anyway,\nPat, you're coming with me before I do violence to what remains of your\ndevil!\"\n\nNick spoke for the first time since the Doctor's entrance. \"Please do,\nPat,\" he said softly. \"Please go with him.\"\n\n\"I won't!\" she snapped. The sudden shifts of situation during the long\nhours of that terrible evening were irritating her. She had alternated\nso rapidly between horror and hope and despair that her frayed nerves\nhad seized now at the same reality of anger.\n\nHer mind, so long overstrained, was now deliberately forgetting her\nswing from the pit of terror to the verge of death. \"You come up like a\nhero to the rescue!\" she taunted the doctor. \"Hairbreadth Horker!\"\n\n\"You little fool!\" growled the Doctor. \"A fine reception, after\nlosing a night's sleep! I'll drag you home, if I have to!\" He moved\nponderously toward the door; she gave a violent wrench and freed her\narm from his grasp.\n\n\"If you can, you mean!\" she jeered. She looked at his exasperated face,\nand suddenly, with one of her abrupt changes of mood, she softened.\n\"Dr. Carl, Honey,\" she said in apologetic tones, \"I'm sorry. You're\nvery sweet, and I'm really grateful, but I can't leave Nick now.\" Her\neyes turned troubled. \"Not now.\"\n\n\"Why, Pat?\" Mollified by the change in her mien, his voice rumbled in\nsympathetic notes.\n\n\"I can't,\" she repeated. \"It's--it's getting worse.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"So it's 'Bah'!\" she flared. \"Well, if you're so contemptuous of the\nthing, why don't you cure it? What good did your psychoanalysis do? You\ndon't even know what it is!\"\n\n\"What do you expect?\" roared the Doctor. \"Can I diagnose it by absent\ntreatment? I haven't had a chance to see the condition active yet!\"\n\n\"All right!\" said Pat, her strained nerves driving her to impatience.\n\"You're here and Nick's here! Go on with your diagnosis; get it over\nwith, and let's see what you can do. _You_ ought at least to be able\nto name the condition--the outstanding authority in the Middle West on\nneural and mental pathology!\" Her tone was sardonic.\n\n\"Listen, Pat,\" said Horker with exaggerated patience, in the manner of\none addressing a stupid child, \"I've explained before that I can't get\nat the root of a mental aberration when the subject's as unstrung as\nyour young man here seems to be. Psychoanalysis just won't work unless\nthe subject is calm, composed, and not in a nervous state. Can you\ncomprehend that?\"\n\n\"Just dimly!\" she snapped. \"You ought to know another way--you, the\noutstanding authority--\"\n\n\"Be still!\" he interrupted gruffly. \"Of course I know another way,\nif I wanted to drag all of us back to my office, where I have the\nequipment!--which I won't do tonight,\" he finished grimly.\n\n\"Then do it here.\"\n\n\"I haven't what I need.\"\n\n\"There's everything upstairs,\" said Pat. \"It's all there, all Nick's\nfather's equipment.\"\n\n\"Not tonight! That's final.\"\n\nThe girl's manner changed again. She turned troubled, imploring eyes\non Horker. \"Dr. Carl,\" she said plaintively, \"I can't leave Nick now.\"\nShe seized the arm of the silent, dejected youth, who had been standing\npassively by. \"I can't leave him, really. I'd not be sure of seeing him\nagain, ever. Please, Dr. Carl!\"\n\n\"If these frenzies of yours,\" rumbled Horker, \"are so violent and\nmalicious, you ought to be confined. Do you know that, young man?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" mumbled Nick wretchedly.\n\n\"And I've thought of it,\" continued the Doctor. \"I've thought of it!\"\n\n\"Please!\" cried Pat imploringly. \"Won't you try, Dr. Carl?\"\n\n\"The devil!\" he growled. \"All right, then.\"\n\nHe followed the girl up the stairs, while Nick trailed disconsolately\nbehind. She led him back into the chamber they had quitted, where a\ncurious odor of peach pits seemed to scent the air. Horker sniffed\nsuspiciously, then seized the remaining beaker, raising it cautiously\nto his nostrils.\n\n\"Damnation!\" he exploded. \"Prussic acid--or cyanide! What in--\" He\ncaught sight of Pat's tragic eyes, and suddenly replaced the container.\n\"Pat!\" he groaned. \"Pat, Honey!\" He drew her into the circle of his\ngreat arm. \"I'll help you, dear! All I can, with all my heart, since\nit means that much to you!\" He groaned again under his breath. \"Oh, my\nGod!\"\n\nHe held her a moment, patting her tousled black head with his massive,\ndelicate fingered hand. Then he released her, turning to Nick.\n\n\"This the stuff?\" he asked, brusquely, indicating the cabinet of\nbottles, with its splintered front.\n\nNick nodded. Pat sank to the chair beside the table and watched Horker\nas he scanned the array of containers. He pulled out a tiny wooden case\nand snapped it open to reveal a number of steel needles that glinted\nbrightly in the yellow light. He grunted in satisfaction and continued\nhis inspection.\n\n\"Atropine,\" he muttered, reading the labeled boxes. \"Cocaine, daturine,\nhyoscine, hyoscyamine--won't do!\"\n\n\"What do you need?\" the girl queried faintly.\n\n\"A mild hypnotic,\" said the Doctor abstractedly, still searching.\n\"Pretty good substitutes for psychoanalysis--certain drugs. Dulls the\nconscious mind, but not to complete unconsciousness. Good means of\ngetting at the subconscious. See?\"\n\n\"Sort of,\" said Pat. \"If it only works!\"\n\n\"Oh, it'll work if we can find--ah!\" He seized a tiny cardboard box.\n\"Scopolamine! This'll do the work.\"\n\nHe extracted a tiny glassy something from one or other of the boxes he\nheld, and frowned down at it. He seized the carafe of water, plunged\nsomething pointed and shiny into it.\n\n\"Antiseptic,\" he muttered thoughtfully. He seized a brown bottle from\nthe case, held it toward the light, and shook it. \"Peroxide's gone\nflat,\" he growled. \"Nothing but water.\"\n\nHe pulled a silver cigar-lighter from his pocket and snapped a yellow\nflame to it. He passed the point of the hypodermic rapidly back and\nforth through the little spear of fire. Finally he turned to Nick.\n\n\"Take off your coat,\" he ordered. \"Roll up your shirt sleeve--the left\none. And sit over there.\" He indicated the couch along the wall.\n\nThe youth obeyed without a word. The only indication of emotion was a\nlong, miserable, wistful look at Pat as he seated himself impassively\non the spot that the girl had so recently occupied.\n\n\"Now!\" said the Doctor briskly, approaching the youth. \"This will make\nyou drowsy, sleepy. That's all it'll do. Don't fight the effect. Just\nrelax, let the thing take its course, and I'll see what I can get out\nof you.\"\n\nPat gasped and Nick winced as he drove the needle into the bared arm.\n\n\"So!\" he said. \"Now relax. Lean back and close your eyes.\"\n\nHe stepped to the door, dragged in a battered chair from the hall,\nand occupied it. He sat beside Pat, watching the pale features of the\nyouth, who sat quietly with closed eyes, breathing slowly, heavily.\n\n\"Long enough,\" muttered Horker. He raised his voice. \"Can you hear me?\"\nhe called to the motionless figure on the couch. There was no response,\nbut Pat fancied she saw a slight change in Nick's expression.\n\n\"Can you hear me?\" repeated Horker in louder tones.\n\n\"Yes, I can hear you,\" came in icy tones from the figure on the couch.\nPat started violently as the voice sounded. The eyes opened, and she\nsaw in sudden terror the ruddy orbs of the demon!\n\n\n\n\n30\n\nThe Demon Free\n\n\nPat emitted a small, startled shriek, and heard it echoed by a\nsurprised grunt from Dr. Horker.\n\n\"Queer!\" he muttered. \"The stuff must be mislabeled. Scopolamine\ndoesn't act like this; it's a narcotic.\"\n\n\"He's--the other!\" gasped Pat, while the being on the couch grinned\nsardonically.\n\n\"Eh? An attack? Can't be!\" The Doctor shook his head emphatically.\n\n\"It's not Nick!\" cried the girl in panic. \"You're not, are you?\" she\nappealed to the grim entity.\n\n\"Not your sweetheart?\" queried the creature, still with his mocking\nleer. \"A few hours ago you were lying here all but naked, confessing\nyou were mine. Have you forgotten?\"\n\nShe shuddered at the reference, and shrank back in her chair. She heard\nthe Doctor's ominous, angry rumble, and the evil tittering chuckle of\nthe other.\n\n\"Pathological or not,\" snapped Horker, \"I can resent your remarks! I've\nconsidered several times varying my treatment with another solid cut to\nthe jaw!\" He rose from his chair, stamping viciously toward the other.\n\n\"A moment,\" said Nicholas Devine. \"Do you know what you've done? Have\nyou any idea what you've done?\" He turned cool, mocking, red-glinting\neyes on the Doctor.\n\n\"Huh?\" Horker paused as if puzzled. \"What _I've_ done? What do you\nmean?\"\n\n\"You don't know, then.\" The other gave a satyric smile. \"You're stupid;\nI gave you the clue, yet you hadn't the intelligence to follow it.\nDo you know what I am?\" He leaned forward, his eyes leering evilly\ninto the Doctor's. \"I'll tell you. I'm a question of synapses. That's\nall--merely a question of synapses!\" He tittered again, horribly. \"It\nstill means nothing to you, doesn't it, Doctor?\"\n\n\"I'll show you what it means!\" Horker clenched a massive fist and\nstrode toward the figure, whose eyes stared, steadily, unwinkingly into\nhis own.\n\n\"Back!\" the being snapped as the great form bent over him. The Doctor\npaused as if struck rigid, his arm and heavy fist drawn back like the\nconventional fighting pose of a boxer. \"Go back!\" repeated the other,\nrising. Pat whimpered in abject terror as she heard Horker's surprised\ngrunt, and saw him recede slowly, and finally sink into his chair. His\nbewildered eyes were still fixed on those of Nicholas Devine.\n\n\"I'll tell you what you've done!\" said the strange being. \"You've freed\nme! There was nothing wrong with your scopolamine. It worked!\" He\nchuckled. \"You drugged _him_ and freed me!\"\n\nHorker managed a questioning grunt.\n\n\"I'm free!\" exulted the other. \"For the first time I haven't _him_ to\nfight! He's here, but helpless to oppose me--he's feeble--feeble!\" He\ngave again the horrible tittering chuckle. \"See how weak the two of you\nare against my unopposed powers!\" he jeered. \"Weaklings--food for my\npleasures!\"\n\nHe turned his eyes, luminous and avid, on Pat. \"This time,\" he said,\n\"there'll be no interruptions. A witness to our experiment will add a\ndelicate touch of pleasure--\"\n\nHe broke off at the Doctor's sudden movement. Horker had snatched\na glistening blue revolver from his pocket, held it leveled at the\nlust-filled eyes.\n\n\"Huh!\" growled the Doctor triumphantly. \"Do you think I come trailing a\nmaniac without some protection? Especially a vicious one like you?\"\n\nNicholas Devine turned his eyes on his opponent. He stared long and\nintently.\n\n\"Drop it!\" he commanded at length. Pat felt a surge of chaotic terror\nas the weapon clattered to the floor. She turned a frightened glance on\nHorker's face, and her fright redoubled at the sight of his straining\njaw, the perspiration-beaded forehead, and his bewildered eyes. The\ndemon kicked the gun carelessly aside.\n\n\"Puerile!\" he said contemptuously. He backed away from them, re-seating\nhimself on the couch whence he had risen. He surveyed the pair in\nsardonic mirth.\n\n\"Pat!\" muttered the Doctor huskily. \"Get out of here, Honey! He's got\nsome hellish trick of fascination that's paralyzed me. Get out and get\nhelp!\"\n\nThe girl moved as if to rise. Nicholas Devine shifted his eyes for the\nbarest instant to her face; she felt the strength drain out of her\nbody, and she sank weakly to her chair.\n\n\"It's useless,\" she murmured hopelessly to the Doctor. \"He's--he's just\nwhat I told you--a devil!\"\n\n\"I guess you were right,\" mumbled Horker dazedly.\n\nThere was a burst of demonic mirth from the being on the couch. \"Merely\na matter of synapses,\" he rasped, chuckling. His face changed, took\non the familiar coldness, the stony expression Pat had observed there\nbefore. \"This palls!\" he snapped. \"I've better amusement--after we've\nrendered your friend merely an interested on-looker.\" He narrowed his\nred eyes as if in thought. \"Take off a stocking,\" he ordered. \"Tie his\nhands to the back of the chair.\"\n\n\"I won't!\" said the girl. The eyes shifted to her face. \"I won't!\" she\nrepeated tremulously as she kicked off a diminutive pump. She shuddered\nat the gleam in the evil eyes as she stripped the long silken sheath\nfrom a white, rounded limb. She slipped a bare foot into the pump and\nmoved reluctantly behind the chair that held the groaning Horker. She\ntook one of the clenched, straining hands, and drew it back, fumbling\nwith shaking fingers as she twisted the strip of thin chiffon. The\ndemon moved closer, standing over her.\n\n\"Loose knots!\" he snarled abruptly. He knocked her violently away with\na stinging slap across her cheek, and seized the strip in his own\nhands. He drew the binding tight, twisting it about the lowest rung of\nthe chair's ladder back. Horker was forced to lean awkwardly to the\nrear; in this unbalanced position it was quite impossible to rise.\n\nNicholas Devine turned away from the straining, perspiring Doctor, and\nadvanced toward Pat, who cowered against the shattered cabinet.\n\n\"Now!\" he muttered. \"The experiment!\" He chuckled raspingly. \"What\ndelicacy of degradation! Your lover and your guardian angel--both\nhelpless watchers! Excellent! Oh, very excellent!\"\n\nHe grasped her wrist, drawing her after him to the center of the room,\ninto the full view of the horrified, staring eyes of Horker.\n\n\"Always before,\" continued her tormentor, \"these hands have prepared\nyou for the rites--the ceremony that failed on two other occasions\nto transpire. Would it add a poignancy to the torture if I made you\nstrip this body of yours with your own hands? Or will they suffer more\nwatching me? Which do you think?\"\n\nPat closed her eyes in helpless resignation to her fate. \"Nick!\" she\nmoaned. \"Oh, Nick dearest!\"\n\n\"Not this time!\" sneered the other. \"Your friend and protector, the\nDoctor, has thoughtfully eliminated your sweetheart as a factor. He\nstruggles too feebly for me to feel.\"\n\n\"Nick!\" she murmured again. \"Dr. Carl!\"\n\nBut the Doctor, now pulling painfully at his bonds, could only groan in\ndistraction, and curse the unsuspected strength of sheer chiffon. He\nwrithed miserably at the chafing of his wrists; his strange paralysis\nhad departed, but he was quite helpless to assist Pat.\n\n\"I think,\" said the cold tones of Nicholas Devine, \"that the more\ndelicate torture lies in your willingness. Let us see.\"\n\nHe drew her into his arms. He twisted a hand in her hair, jerked her\nhead violently backward, and pressed avid lips to hers. She struggled a\nlittle, but hopelessly, automatically. At last she lay quite passive,\nquite motionless, supported by his arms, and making not the slightest\nresponse to his kiss.\n\n\"Are you mine?\" he queried fiercely, releasing her lips. \"Are you mine\nnow?\"\n\nShe shook her head without opening her eyes. \"No,\" she said dully. \"Not\nnow, or ever.\"\n\nAgain he crushed her, while the Doctor looked on in helpless,\nbewildered, voiceless anger. This time his kiss was painful, burning,\nsearing. Again that unholy fascination and unnatural delight in her own\npain stirred her, and it took what little effort she was able to make\nto keep from responding. After a long interval, his lips again withdrew.\n\n\"Are you mine?\" he repeated. She made no answer; she was gasping,\nand tears glistened under her closed eye-lids, from the pain of her\ncrushed lips. Again he kissed her, and again the wild abandonment to\nevil suffused her. She was suddenly responding to his agonizing caress;\nshe was clinging fiercely to his torturing lips, feeling an unholy\nexaltation in the pain of his tearing fingers in the flesh of her back.\n\n\"Yours!\" she murmured in response to his query. She heard her voice\nrepeat madly, \"Yours! Yours! Yours!\"\n\n\"Do you yield willingly?\" came the icy tones of the demon.\n\n\"Yes--yes--yes! Willingly!\"\n\n\"Take off your clothes!\" sounded the terrible, overpowering voice. He\nthrust her from him, so that she staggered dizzily backward. She stood\nswaying; the voice repeated its command.\n\nThe girl's eyes widened wildly; she had the appearance of one in an\necstasy, a religious fervor. She raised her hand with a jerky impulsive\ngesture to the neck of her frock, still pinned together in the\nmakeshift repairs of the evening.\n\nThere came a strange interruption. The Doctor, helpless on-looker,\nhad at length evolved an idea out of the bewilderment in his mind. He\nopened his mouth and emitted a tremendous, deep, ear-shattering bellow!\n\nNicholas Devine sent the girl spinning to the floor with a vicious\nshove, and turned his blazing eyes on Horker, who was drawing in his\nbreath for a repetition of his roar. \"Quiet!\" he rasped, his red orbs\nboring down at the other. \"Quiet, or I'll muffle you!\" Closing his\neyes, the Doctor repeated his mighty shout.\n\nThe demon snatched the blanket from the couch, tossing it over the\nfigure of the Doctor, where it became a billowing, writhing heap of\nbrown wool. He turned his gaze on Pat, who was just struggling to her\nfeet, and moved as if to advance toward her.\n\nHe paused. She had retrieved the Doctor's revolver from the floor, and\nnow faced him with the madness gone out of her eyes, supporting the\nweapon with both hands, the muzzle wavering toward his face.\n\n\"Drop it!\" he commanded. She felt a recurrence of fascination, and an\nimpulse to obey. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the Doctor's\nhead emerging from the blanket as he shook it off.\n\n\"Drop it!\" repeated Nicholas Devine.\n\nShe closed her eyes, shutting out the vision of his dominant visage.\nWith a surge of terror, she squeezed the trigger, staggering back to\nthe couch at the roar and the recoil.\n\nShe opened her eyes. Nicholas Devine lay in the center of the room on\nhis face; a crimson spot was matting the hair on the back of his head.\nShe saw the Doctor raise a free hand; he was working clear of his bonds.\n\n\"Pat!\" he said softly. He looked at her pale, sickened features.\n\"Honey,\" he said, \"sit down till I get free. Sit down, Pat; you look\nfaint.\"\n\n\"Never faint!\" murmured the girl, and pitched backward to the couch,\nwith one clad and one bare leg hanging in curious limpness over the\nedge.\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\"Not Humanly Possible\"\n\n\nPat opened weary eyes and gazed at a blank, uninformative ceiling. It\nwas some moments before she realized that she was lying on the couch in\nthe room of Nicholas Devine. Somebody had placed her there, presumably,\nsince she was quite unaware of the circumstances of her awakening. Then\nrecollection began to form--Dr. Carl, the _other_, the roar of a shot.\nAfter that, nothing save a turmoil ending in blankness.\n\nA sound of movement beside her drew her attention. She turned her head\nand perceived Dr. Horker kneeling over a form on the floor, fingering\na white bandage about the head of the figure. Her recollections took\ninstant form; she remembered the catastrophes of the evening--last\nnight, rather, since dawn glowed dully in the window. She had shot\nNick! She gave a little moan and pushed herself to a sitting position.\n\nThe Doctor glanced at her with a sick, shaky smile. \"Hello,\" he\nsaid. \"Come to, have you? Sorry I couldn't give you any attention.\"\nHe gave the bandage a final touch. \"Here's a job I had no heart\nfor,\" he muttered. \"Better for everyone to let things happen without\ninterference.\"\n\nThe girl, returning to full awareness, noticed now that the bandage\nconsisted of strips of the Doctor's shirt. She glanced fearfully at the\nstill features of Nicholas Devine; she saw pale cheeks and closed eyes,\nbut indubitably not the grim mien of the demon.\n\n\"Dr. Carl!\" she whispered. \"He isn't--he isn't--\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"But will he--?\"\n\n\"I don't know. That's a bad spot, a wound in the base of the brain.\nYou'd best know it now, Pat, but also realize that nothing can happen\nto you. I'll see to that!\"\n\n\"To me!\" she said dully. \"What difference does that make? It's Nick I\nwant saved.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best for you, Honey,\" said Horker with almost a hint of\nreluctance. \"I've phoned Briggs General for an ambulance. Your faint\nlasted a full quarter hour,\" he added.\n\n\"What can we tell them?\" asked the girl. \"What can we say?\"\n\n\"Don't you say anything, Pat. I'm not on the board for nothing.\" He\nrose from his knees, glancing out of the window into the cool dawn.\n\"Queer neighborhood!\" he said. \"All that yelling and a shot, and still\nno sign of interest from the neighbors. That's Chicago, though,\" he\nmused. \"Lucky for us, Pat; we can handle the thing quietly now.\"\n\nBut the girl was staring dully at the still figure on the floor. \"Oh\nGod!\" she said huskily. \"Help him, Dr. Carl!\"\n\n\"I'll do my best,\" responded Horker gloomily. \"I was a good surgeon\nbefore I specialized in psychiatry. Brain surgery, too; it led right\ninto my present field.\"\n\nPat said nothing, but dropped her head on her hands and stared vacantly\nbefore her.\n\n\"Better for you, and for him too, if I fail,\" muttered the Doctor.\n\nHis words brought a reply. \"You won't fail,\" she said tensely. \"You\nwon't!\"\n\n\"Not voluntarily, I'm afraid,\" he growled morosely. \"I've still a\nlittle respect for medical ethics, but if ever a case--\" His voice\ntrailed into silence as from somewhere in the dawn sounded the wail of\na siren. \"There's the ambulance,\" he finished.\n\nPat sat unmoving as the sounds from outdoors detailed the stopping\nof the vehicle before the house. She heard the Doctor descending the\nsteps, and the creak of the door. Though it took place before her eyes,\nshe scarcely saw the white-coated youths as they lifted the form of\nNicholas Devine and bore it from the room on a stretcher, treading\nwith carefully broken steps to prevent the swaying of the support. Dr.\nHorker's order to follow made no impression on her; she sat dully on\nthe couch as the chamber emptied.\n\nWhy, she wondered, had the thought of Nick's death disturbed her so?\nWasn't it but a short time since they had both contemplated it? What\nhad occurred to alter that determination? Nick was dying, she thought\nmournfully; all that remained was for her to follow. There on the\nfloor lay the revolver, and on the table, glistening in the wan light,\nreposed the untouched lethal draft. That was the preferable way, she\nmused, staring fixedly at its glowing contour.\n\nBut suppose Nick weren't to die--she'd have abandoned him to his\nterrible doom, left him to face a situation far more ominous than any\nunknown terrors beyond death. She shook her head distractedly, and\nlooked up to meet the eyes of Dr. Horker, who was watching her gravely\nin the doorway.\n\n\"Come on, Pat,\" he said gently.\n\nShe rose, followed him down the stairs and out into the morning light.\nThe driver of the ambulance stared curiously at her dishevelled,\nbedraggled figure, but she was so weary and forlorn that even the\neffort of brushing away the black strands of hair that clouded her\nsmoke-dark eyes was beyond her. She slumped into the seat of the\nDoctor's car and sighed in utter exhaustion.\n\n\"Rush it!\" Horker called to the driver ahead. \"I'll follow you.\"\n\nThe car swept into motion, and the swift cool morning air beating\nagainst her face from the open window restored some clarity to her\nmind. She fixed her eyes on the rear of the speeding vehicle they\nfollowed.\n\n\"Is there any hope at all?\" she queried despondently.\n\n\"I don't know, Pat. I can't tell yet. When you closed your eyes, he\nhalf turned, dodged; the bullet entered his skull near the base,\nnear the cerebellum. If it had pierced the cerebellum, his heart and\nbreathing must have stopped instantly. They didn't, however, and that's\na mildly hopeful sign. Very mildly hopeful, though.\"\n\n\"Do you know now what that devil--what the attack was?\"\n\n\"No, Pat,\" Horker admitted. \"I don't. Call it a devil if you like;\nI can't name it any better.\" His voice changed to a tone of wonder.\n\"Pat, I can't understand that paralyzing fascination the thing exerted.\nI--any medical man--would say that mental dominance of that sort\ndoesn't exist.\"\n\n\"Hypnotism,\" the girl suggested.\n\n\"Bah! Every psychiatrist uses hypnotism in his business; it's part of\nsome treatments. There's nothing of fascination about it; no dominance\nof one will over another, despite the popular view. That's natural\nand understandable; this was like--well, like the exploded claims of\nMesmerism. I tell you, it's not humanly possible--and yet I felt it!\"\n\n\"Not _humanly_ possible,\" murmured Pat. \"That's the answer, then, Dr.\nCarl. Maybe now you'll believe in my devil.\"\n\n\"I'm tempted to.\"\n\n\"You'll have to! Can't you see it, Dr. Carl? Even his name,\nNick--that's a colloquialism for the devil, isn't it?\"\n\n\"And Devine, I suppose,\" said Horker, \"refers to his angelic ancestry.\nDevils are only fallen angels, aren't they?\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Pat wearily. \"Make fun of it. You'll see!\"\n\n\"I'm not making fun of your theory, Honey. I can't offer a better one\nmyself. I never saw nor heard of anything similar, and I'm not in\nposition to ridicule any theory.\"\n\n\"But you don't believe me.\"\n\n\"Of course I don't, Pat. You're weaving an intricate fairy tale about\na pathological condition and a fortuitous suggestiveness in names.\nWhatever the condition is--and I confess I don't understand it--it's\nsomething rational, and those things can be treated.\"\n\n\"Treated by exorcism,\" said the girl. \"That's the only way anyone ever\nsucceeded in casting out a devil.\"\n\nThe Doctor made no answer. The wailing vehicle ahead of them swung\nrapidly out of sight into an alley, and Horker halted his car before\nthe gray facade of Briggs General.\n\n\"Come in here,\" he said, helping Pat to alight. \"You'll want to wait,\nwon't you?\"\n\n\"How long,\" she queried listlessly, \"before--before you'll know?\"\n\n\"Perhaps immediately. The only chance is to get that bullet out at\nonce--if there's still time for it.\"\n\nShe followed him into the building, past a desk where a white-clad girl\nregarded her curiously, and up an elevator. He led her into a small\noffice.\n\n\"Sit here,\" he said gently, and disappeared.\n\nShe sat dully in the chair he had indicated, and minutes passed. She\nmade no attempt to think; the long, cataclysmic night had exhausted her\npowers. She simply sat and suffered; the deep scratches of fingernails\nburned in the flesh of her back, her cheek pained from the violent\nslap, and her head and jaw ached from that first blow, the one that had\nknocked her unconscious last evening. But these twinges were minor;\nthey were merely physical, and the hurts of the demon had struck far\ndeeper than any physical injury. The damage to her spirit was by all\nodds the more painful; it numbed her mind and dulled her thoughts, and\nshe simply sat idle and stared at the blank wall.\n\nShe had no conception of the interval before Dr. Horker returned. He\nentered quietly, and began rinsing his hands at a basin in the corner.\n\n\"Is it over?\" she asked listlessly.\n\n\"Not even begun,\" he responded. \"However, it isn't too late. He'll be\nready in a moment or so.\"\n\n\"I wish it were over,\" she murmured. \"One way or the other.\"\n\n\"I too!\" said the Doctor. \"With all my heart, I wish it were over! If\nthere were anyone within call who could handle it, I'd turn it to him\ngladly. But there isn't!\"\n\nHe moved again toward the door, leaning out and glancing down the hall.\n\n\"You stay here,\" he admonished her. \"Don't try to find us; I want no\ninterruptions, no matter what enters that mind of yours!\"\n\n\"You needn't worry,\" she said soberly. \"I'm not fool enough for that.\"\nShe leaned wearily back in the chair, closing her eyes. A long interval\npassed; she was vaguely surprised to see the Doctor still standing in\nthe doorway when she opened her eyes. She had fancied him already in\nthe midst of his labor.\n\n\"What will you do?\" she asked.\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"I mean what sort of operation will it need? Probing or what?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he said. \"I'll have to trephine him. Must get that bullet.\"\n\n\"What's that--trephine?\"\n\nHe glanced down the hall. \"They're ready,\" he said, and turned to go.\nAt the door he paused. \"Trephining is to open a little door in the\nskull. If your devil is in his head, we'll have it out along with the\nbullet.\"\n\nHis footsteps receded down the hall.\n\n\n\n\nRevelation\n\n\n\"Is it over now?\" queried Pat tremulously as the Doctor finally\nreappeared. The interminable waiting had left her even more worn, and\nher pallid features bore the marks of strain.\n\n\"Twenty minutes ago,\" said Horker. His face too bore evidence of\ntension; moreover, there was a puzzled, dubious expression in his eyes\nthat frightened Pat. She was too apprehensive to risk a question as to\nthe outcome, and simply stared at him with wide, fearful, questioning\neyes.\n\n\"I called up your home,\" he said irrelevantly. \"I told them you left\nwith me early this morning. Your mother's still in bed, although it's\nafter ten.\" He paused. \"Slip in without anyone seeing you, will you,\nHoney? And rumple up your bed.\"\n\n\"If I haven't lost my key,\" she said, still with the question in her\neyes.\n\n\"It's in the mail-box. Magda found it on the porch this morning. I\ntalked to her.\"\n\nShe could bear the uncertainty no longer. \"Tell me!\" she demanded.\n\n\"It's all right, I think.\"\n\n\"You mean--he'll live?\"\n\nThe Doctor nodded. \"I think so.\" He turned his puzzled eyes on her.\n\n\"Oh!\" breathed Pat. \"Thank God!\"\n\n\"You wanted him back, Honey, didn't you?\" Horker's tone was gentle.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\"\n\n\"Devil and all?\"\n\n\"Yes--devil and all!\" she echoed. Suddenly she sensed something strange\nin the other's manner. She perceived the uncertainty in his visage, and\nfelt a rising trepidation. \"What's the matter?\" she queried anxiously.\n\"You're not telling me everything! Tell me, Dr. Carl!\"\n\n\"There's something else,\" he said. \"I'm not sure, Pat, but I think--I\nhope--you've got him back without the devil!\"\n\n\"He's cured?\" Her voice was incredulous; she did not dare accept the\nDoctor's meaning.\n\n\"I hope so. At least I located the cause.\"\n\n\"What was it?\" she demanded, an unexpected vigor livening her tired\nbody. \"What was that devil? Tell me! I want to know, Dr. Carl!\"\n\n\"I think the best name for it is a tumor,\" he said slowly. \"I told them\nin there it was a tumor. I wish I knew myself.\"\n\n\"A tumor! I don't understand!\"\n\n\"I don't either, Pat--not fully. It's something on or beyond the border\nof medical knowledge. I don't think any living authority could classify\nit definitely.\"\n\n\"But tell me!\" she cried fiercely. \"Tell me!\"\n\n\"Well, Honey--I'll try.\" He paused thoughtfully. \"Cancers and\ntumors--sarcomas--are curious things, Dear. Doctors aren't at all\nsure just what they are. And one of their peculiarities is that they\nsometimes seem to be trying to develop into separate entities, trying\nto become human by feeding like parasites on their hosts. Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the girl. \"I'm sorry, Dr. Carl, but I don't.\"\n\n\"I mean,\" he continued, \"that sometimes these growths seem to be trying\nto develop into--into organisms. I've seen them, for instance--every\nsurgeon has--with bones developing. I've seen one with a rather perfect\njaw-bone, and little teeth, and hair. As if,\" he added, \"it were\nmaking a sort of attempt to become human, in a primitive, disorganized\nfashion. Now do you see what I mean?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the girl, with a violent shudder. \"Dr. Carl, that's\nhorrible!\"\n\n\"Life sometimes is,\" he agreed. \"Well,\" he continued slowly, \"I opened\nup our patient's skull at the point where the fluoroscope indicated the\nbullet. I trephined it, and there, pierced by the shot, was this--\" He\nhesitated, \"--this tumor.\"\n\n\"Did you--remove it?\"\n\n\"Of course. But it wasn't a natural sort of brain tumor, Honey. It was\na little cerebrum, apparently joined to a Y-shaped branch of the spinal\ncord. A little brain, Pat--no larger than your small fist, but deeply\nconvoluted, and with the pre-Rolandic area highly developed.\"\n\n\"What's pre-Rolandic, Dr. Carl?\" asked Pat, shivering.\n\n\"The seat of the motor nerves. The home, you might say, of the will.\nThis brain was practically all will--and I wonder,\" he said musingly,\n\"if that explains the ungodly, evil fascination the creature could\ncommand. A brain that was nothing but pure will-power, relieved by\nits parasitic nature of all the distractions of a directing body! I\nwonder--\" He fell silent.\n\n\"Tell me the rest!\" she said frantically.\n\n\"That's all, Honey. I removed it, and I guess I'm the only surgeon in\nthe world who ever removed a brain from a human skull without killing\nthe patient! Luckily, he had two of them!\"\n\n\"Oh God!\" murmured the girl faintly. She turned to Horker. \"But he will\nlive?\"\n\n\"I think so. Your shot killed the devil, it seems.\" He frowned. \"I said\nit was a tumor; I told them it was a tumor, but I'm not sure. Perhaps,\njust as some people are born with six fingers or toes on each member,\nhe was born with two brains. It's possible; one developed normally,\nhumanly, and the other--into that creature we faced last night. I don't\nknow!\"\n\n\"It's what I said,\" asserted Pat. \"It's a devil, and what you've just\ntold me about tumors proves it. They're devils, that's all, and some\nday some student is going to cut one loose and raise it to maturity\noutside a human body, and you'll see what a devil is really like! And\ngo ahead and laugh!\"\n\n\"I'm not laughing, Pat. I'd be the last one to laugh at your theory,\nafter facing that thing last night. It had satanic powers, all\nright--that paralyzing fascination! You felt it too; it wasn't just a\nmental lapse on my part, was it?\"\n\n\"I felt it, Dr. Carl! I'd felt it before that; I was always helpless in\nthe presence of it.\"\n\n\"Could it,\" he asked, \"have imposed its will actively on yours? I mean,\ncould it have made you actually do what it asked there at the end, just\nbefore I recovered enough sense to let out that bellow?\"\n\n\"To take off--my dress?\" She shivered. \"I don't know, Dr. Carl.--I'm\nafraid so.\" She looked at him appealingly. \"Why did I yield to it so?\"\nshe cried. \"What made me find such a fierce pleasure in its kisses--in\nits blows and scratches, and the pain it inflicted on me? Why was that,\nDr. Carl?\"\n\n\"Why,\" he countered, \"do gangsters' girls and apache women enjoy the\ncruelties perpetrated on them by their men? There's a little masochism\nin most women, and that--creature was sadistic, perverted, abnormal,\nand somehow dominating. It took an unfair advantage of you, Pat; don't\nblame yourself.\"\n\n\"It was--utterly evil!\" she muttered. \"It was the ultimate in\neverything unholy.\"\n\n\"It was an aberrant brain,\" said Horker. \"You can't judge it by human\nstandards, since it wasn't actually human. It was, I suppose, just\nwhat you said--a devil. I didn't even keep it,\" he added grimly. \"I\ndestroyed it.\"\n\n\"Do you know what it meant by saying it was a question of synapses?\"\nshe asked.\n\n\"That was queer!\" The Doctor's voice was puzzled. \"That remark implies\nthat the thing itself knew what it was. How? It must have possessed\nknowledge that the normal brain lacked.\"\n\n\"Was it a question of synapses?\"\n\n\"In a sense it was. The nerves from the two rival brains must have met\nin a synaptic juncture. The oftener the aberrant brain gained control,\nthe easier it became for it to repeat the process, as the synapse, so\nto speak, wore thin. That's why the attacks intensified so horribly\ntoward the end; the habit was being formed.\"\n\n\"Last night was the very worst!\"\n\n\"Of course. As the thing itself pointed out, I made the mistake of\ndrugging the normal brain and giving the other complete control of\nthe body. At other times, there'd always been the rivalry to weaken\nwhichever was dominant.\"\n\n\"Does that mean,\" asked Pat anxiously, \"that Nick's character will be\nchanged now?\"\n\n\"I think so. I think you'll find him less meek, less gentle, than\nheretofore. More spirited, perhaps, since his energies won't be drained\nso constantly by the struggle.\"\n\n\"I don't care!\" she said. \"I'd like that, and anyway, it doesn't make a\nbit of difference to me as long as he's just--_my_ Nick.\"\n\nThe Doctor gave her a tender smile. \"Let's go home,\" he said, pinching\nher cheek in his great hand.\n\n\"Can you leave him?\"\n\n\"I'll run back after a while, Honey. I think he'll do.\" He took her\nhand, drawing her after him. \"Don't forget to slip in unseen, Pat, and\nrumple up your bed.\"\n\n\"Rumple it!\" She gave him a weary smile. \"I'll be _in_ it!\"\n\n\"Good idea. You look a bit worn out, Honey, and we can't have you\ngetting sick now, or even pull a temporary faint like that one last\nnight.\"\n\n\"I didn't faint!\"\n\n\"Maybe not,\" grinned Horker. \"Perhaps the proceedings grew a little\nboring, and you just lay down on the couch for a nap. It _was_ a dull\nevening.\"", "title": "The Dark Other"}

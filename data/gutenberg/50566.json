Probably smells that cougar I shot yesterday.\" I started to reel\nin my line, knowing what my brother's next move would be. \"Get the\ncamera, and we'll try for a picture.\"\n\nWe crouched together in the underbrush, watching, as the big bird\nof prey wheeled down in a slow spiral toward the dead cougar. Andy\nwas trembling with excitement, the camera poised against his chest,\nhis eyes glued in the image-finder. \"Golly--\" he whispered, almost\nprayerfully, \"six foot wing spread--maybe more--\"\n\nThe bird screamed again, warily, head cocked into the wind. We were to\nleeward; the scent of the carrion masked our enemy smell from him. The\neagle failed to scent or to see us, swooping down and dropping on the\ncougar's head. Andy's camera clicked twice. The eagle thrust in its\nbeak--\n\nA red-hot wire flared in my brain. The bird--the bird--I leaped out of\ncover, running swiftly across the ten-foot clearing that separated us\nfrom the attacking eagle, my hand tugging automatically at the hunting\nknife in my belt. Andy's shout of surprised anger was a faraway noise\nin my ears as the eagle started away with flapping, angry wings--then,\nin fury, swept down at me, pinions beating around my head. I heard and\nfelt the wicked beak dart in, and thrust blindly upward with the knife,\nripped, slashing, hearing the bird's scream of pain and the flapping of\nwide wings. A red haze spun around me--\n\nThen the screaming eagle was gone and Andy's angry grip was on my\nshoulder, shaking me roughly. His voice, furious and frightened, was\nhardly recognizable. \"Mike! Mike, you darned idiot, are you all right?\nYou must be crazy!\"\n\nI blinked, rubbing my hand across my eyes. The hand came away wet. I\nwas standing in the clearing, the knife in my hand red with blood. Bird\nblood. I heard myself ask, stupidly, \"What happened?\"\n\nMy brother's face came clear out of the thickness in my mind, scowling\nwrathfully. \"You tell _me_ what happened! Mike, what in the devil\nwere you thinking about? You told me yourself that an eagle will attack\na man if he's bothered. I had him square in the camera when you jumped\nout of there like a bat out of a belfry and went for the eagle with\nyour knife! You must be clean crazy!\"\n\nI let the knife drop out of my hand. \"Yeah--\" I said heavily, \"Yeah,\nI guess I spoiled your picture, Andy. I'm sorry--I didn't--\" my voice\ntrailed off, helpless. The boy's hand was still on my shoulder; he let\nit drop and knelt in the grass, groping there for his camera. \"That's\nall right, Mike,\" he said in a dead voice, \"you scared the daylights\nout of me, that's all.\" He stood up swiftly, looking straight into my\nface. \"Darn it, Mike, you've been acting crazy for a week! I don't mind\nthe blamed camera, but when you start going for eagles with your bare\nhands--\" abruptly he flung the camera away, turned and began to run\ndown the slope in the direction of the cabin.\n\nI took a step to follow, then stopped, bending to retrieve the broken\npieces of Andy's cherished camera. The kid must have hit the eagle with\nit. Lucky thing for me; an eagle can be a mean bird. But why, why in\nthe living hell had I done a thing like that? I'd warned Andy time\nand time again to stay clear of the big birds. Now that the urgency\nof action had deserted me, I felt stupid and a little lightheaded. I\ndidn't wonder Andy thought I was crazy. I thought so myself more than\nhalf the time. I stowed the broken camera in my tackle box, mentally\npromising Andy a better one; hunted up the abandoned lines and poles,\ncarefully stowed them, cleaned our day's catch. It was dark before I\nstarted for the cabin; I could hear the hum of the electric dynamo I'd\nrigged up and see the electric light across the dusk of the Sierras. A\nsmell of bacon greeted me as I crossed into the glare of the unshielded\nbulb. Andy was standing at the cookstove, his back stubbornly to me. He\ndid not turn.\n\n\"Andy--\" I said.\n\n\"It's okay, Mike. Sit down and eat your supper. I didn't wait for the\nfish.\"\n\n\"Andy--I'll get you another camera--\"\n\n\"I said, it's okay. Now, damn it, eat.\"\n\nHe didn't speak again for a long time; but as I stretched back for a\nsecond mug of coffee, he got up and began to walk around the room,\nrestlessly. \"Mike--\" he said entreatingly, \"you came here for a rest!\nWhy can't you lay off your everlasting work for a while and relax?\" He\nlooked disgustedly over his shoulder at the work table where the light\nspilled over a confused litter of wires and magnets and coils. \"You've\nturned this place into a branch office of General Electric!\"\n\n\"I can't stop now!\" I said violently. \"I'm on the track of\nsomething--and if I stop I'll never find it!\"\n\n\"Must be real important,\" Andy said sourly, \"if it makes you act like\nbughouse bait.\"\n\nI shrugged without answering. We'd been over that before. I'd known\nit when they threw me out of the government lab, just after the big\nblowup. I thought, angrily. I'm heading for another one, but I don't\ncare.\n\n\"Sit down, Andy,\" I told him. \"You don't know what happened down there.\nNow that the war's over, it's no military secret, and I'll tell you\nwhat happened.\"\n\nI paused, swallowing down the coffee, not knowing that it scalded my\nmouth. \"That is--I will if I can.\"\n\nSix months before they settled the war in Korea, I was working in a\ngovernment radio lab, on some new communications equipment. Since I\nnever finished it, there's no point in going into details; it's enough\nto say it would have made radar as obsolete as the stagecoach. I'd\nbuilt a special supersonic condenser, and had had trouble with a set\nof magnetic coils that wouldn't wind properly. When the thing blew up\nI hadn't had any sleep for three nights, but that wasn't the reason. I\nwas normal then; just another communications man, intent on radio and\nthis new equipment and without any of the crazy impractical notions\nthat had lost me my job later. They called it overwork, but I knew they\nthought the explosion had disturbed my brain. I didn't blame them. I\nwould have liked to think so.\n\nIt started one day in the lab with a shadow on the sun and an elusive\nshort circuit that gave me shock after shock until I was jittery. By\nthe time I had it fixed, the oscillator had gone out of control. I got\na series of low-frequency waves that were like nothing I'd ever seen\nbefore. Then there was something like a voice speaking out of a very\nold, jerry-built amateur radio set. Except that there wasn't a receiver\nin the lab, and no one else had heard it. I wasn't sure myself, because\nright then every instrument in the place went haywire and five minutes\nlater, part of the ceiling hit the floor and the floor went up through\nthe roof. They found me, they say, lying half-crushed under a beam, and\nI woke up eighteen hours later in a hospital with four cracked ribs,\nand a feeling as if I'd had a lot of voltage poured into me. It went in\nthe report that I'd been struck by lightning.\n\nIt took me a long time to get well. The ribs healed fast--faster\nthan the doctor liked. I didn't mind the hospital part, except\nthat I couldn't walk without shaking, or light a cigarette without\nburning myself, for months. The thing I minded was what I remembered\n_before_ I woke up. Delirium; that was what they told me. But\nthe _kind_ and _type_ of scars on my body didn't ring true.\nElectricity--even freak lightning--doesn't make that kind of burns. And\nmy corner of the world doesn't make a habit of branding people.\n\nBut before I could show the scars to anybody outside the hospital, they\nwere gone. Not healed; just gone. I remembered the look on the medic's\nface when I showed him the place where the scars had been. He didn't\nthink I was crazy; he thought _he_ was.\n\nI knew the lab hadn't been struck by lightning. The Major knew it\ntoo; I found that out the day I reported back to work. All the time\nwe talked, his big pen moved in stubby circles across the page of his\nlog-book, and he talked without raising his head to look at me.\n\n\"I know all that, Kenscott. No electrical storms reported in the\nvicinity; no radio disturbance within a thousand miles. But--\" his jaw\ngrew stubborn, \"the lab was wrecked and you were hurt. We've got to\nhave something for the record.\"\n\nI could understand all that. What I resented was the way they treated\nme after I went back to work. They transferred me to another division\nand another line of work. They turned down my request to follow up\nthose nontypical waves. My private notes were ripped out of my notebook\nwhile I was at lunch and I never saw them again. And as soon as they\ncould, they shipped me to Fairbanks, Alaska, and that was the end of\nthat.\n\nThe Major told me all I needed to know, the day before I took the plane\nto Alaska. His scowl said more than his words, and they said plenty.\n\"I'd let it alone, Kenscott. No sense stirring up more trouble. We\ncan't bother with side alleys, anyhow. Next time you monkey with it,\nyou might get your head blown off, not just a dose of stray voltage\nout of the blue. We've done everything but stand on our heads trying\nto find out where that spare energy came from--and where it went. But\nwe've marked that whole line of research _closed_, Kenscott. If I\nwere you, I'd keep my mouth shut about it.\"\n\n\"It wasn't a message from Mars,\" I suggested unsmiling, and he didn't\nthink that was funny either. But there was relief on his face as I left\nthe office and went to clean out my drawer.\n\nI got along all right in Alaska, for a while. But I wasn't the same.\nThe armistice had hardly been signed when they sent me back to the\nStates with a recommendation of overwork. I tried to explain it to\nAndy. \"They said I needed a rest. Maybe so. The shock did something\nfunny to me ... tore me open ... like the electric shock treatments\nthey give catatonic patients. I know a lot of things I never learned.\nOrdinary radio work doesn't mean anything to me any more. It doesn't\nmake sense. When people out west were talking about flying saucers or\nwhatever they were--and when they talked about weather disturbances\nafter the atomic tests, things did make sense for a while. And when\nwe came down here--\" I paused, trying to fit confused impressions\ntogether. He wasn't going to believe me, anyhow, but I wanted him to. A\ntree slapped against the cabin window; I jumped. \"It started up again\nthe day we came up in the mountains. Energy out of nowhere, following\nme around. It can't knock me out. Have you noticed I let you turn the\nlights on and off? The day we came up, I shorted my electric razor and\nblew out five fuses trying to change one.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I remember, you had to drive to town for them--\" My brother's\neyes watched me, uneasy. \"Mike, you're kidding--\"\n\n\"I wish I were,\" I said. \"That energy just drains into me, and nothing\nhappens. I'm immune.\" I shrugged, rose and walked across to the\nradio I'd put in here, so carefully, before the war. I picked up the\ndisconnected plug; thrust it into the socket. I snapped the dial on.\n\"I'll show you,\" I told him.\n\nThe panel flashed and darkened; confused static came cracking from the\nspeaker, erratic. I took my hand away.\n\n\"Turn it up--\" Andy said uneasily.\n\nMy hand twiddled the dial. \"It's already up.\"\n\n\"Try another station;\" the kid insisted stubbornly. I pushed all the\nbuttons in succession; the static crackled and buzzed, the panel\nlight flickered on and off in little cryptic flashes. I sighed. \"And\nreception was perfect at noon,\" I told him, \"You were listening to the\nnews.\" I took my hand away again. \"I don't want to blow the thing up.\"\n\nAndy came over and switched the button back on. The little panel light\nglowed steadily, and the mellow voice of Milton Cross filled the\nroom ... \"now conduct the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra in the Fifth\nor 'Fate' symphony of Ludwig von Beethoven ...\" the noise of mixed\napplause, and then the majestic chords of the symphony, thundering\nthrough the rooms of the cabin.\n\n\"Ta-da-da-dumm----Ta-da-da-DUMM!\"\n\nMy brother stared at me as racing woodwinds caught up with the brasses.\nThere was nothing wrong with the radio. \"Mike. What did you do to it?\"\n\n\"I wish I knew,\" I told him. Reaching, I touched the volume button\nagain.\n\nBeethoven died in a muttering static like a thousand drums.\n\nI swore and Andy sucked in his breath between his teeth, edging warily\nbackward. He touched the dials again; once more the smoothness of the\n\"Fate\" symphony rolled out and swallowed us. I shivered.\n\n\"You'd better let it alone!\" Andy said shakily.\n\nThe kid turned in early, but I stayed in the main room, smoking\nrestlessly and wishing I could get a drink without driving eighty miles\nover bad mountain roads. Neither of us had thought to turn off the\nradio; it was moaning out some interminable throbbing jazz. I turned\nover my notes, restlessly, not really seeing them. Once Andy's voice\ncame sleepily from the alcove.\n\n\"Going to read all night, Mike?\"\n\n\"If I feel like it,\" I said tersely and began walking up and down again.\n\n\"Michael! For the luvvagod stop it and let me get some sleep!\" Andy\nexploded, and I sank down in the chair again. \"Sorry, Andy.\"\n\nWhere had the intangible part of me been, those eighteen hours when\nI first lay crushed under a fallen beam, then under morphine in the\nhospital? Where had those scars come from? More important, what had\nmade a radio lab blow up in the first place? Electricity sets fires; it\nshocks men into insensibility or death. It doesn't explode. Radio waves\nare in themselves harmless. Most important of all, what maniac freak of\nlightning was I carrying in my body that made me immune to electrical\ncurrent? I hadn't told Andy about the time I'd deliberately grounded\nthe electric dynamo in the cellar and taken the whole voltage in my\nbody. I was still alive. It would have been a hell of a way to commit\nsuicide--but I hadn't.\n\nI swore, slamming down the window. I was going to bed. Andy was right.\nEither I was crazy or there was something wrong; in any case, sitting\nhere wouldn't help. If it didn't let up, I'd take the first train home\nand see a good electrician--or a psychiatrist. But right now, I was\ngoing to hit the sack.\n\nMy hand went out automatically and switched the light off.\n\n\"Damn!\" I thought incredulously. I'd shorted the dynamo again. The\nradio stopped as if the whole orchestra had dropped dead; every light\nin the cabin winked swiftly out, but my hand on the switch crackled\nwith a phosphorescent glow as the entire house current poured into my\nbody. I tingled with weird shock; I heard my own teeth chattering.\n\nAnd something snapped wide open in my brain. I heard, suddenly, an\nexcited voice, shouting.\n\n\"Rhys! _Rhys!_ That is the man!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nRainbow City\n\n\n\"_You are mad_,\" said the man with the tired voice.\n\nI was drifting. I was swaying, bodiless, over a huge abyss of caverned\nspace; chasmed, immense, limitless. Vaguely, through a sleeping\ndistance, I heard two voices. This one was old and very tired.\n\n\"You are mad. They will know. Narayan will know.\"\n\n\"Narayan is a fool,\" said the second voice.\n\n\"Narayan is the Dreamer,\" the tired voice said. \"He is the Dreamer, and\nwhere the Dreamer walks he will know. But have it your way. I am very\nold and it does not matter. I give you this power, freely--to spare\nyou. But Gamine--\"\n\n\"Gamine--\" the second voice stopped. After a long time, \"You are old,\nand a fool, Rhys,\" it said. \"What is Gamine to me?\"\n\nBodiless, blind, I drifted and swayed and swung in the sound of the\nvoices. The humming, like a million high-tension wires, sang around\nme and I felt myself cradled in the pull of a great magnet that\nheld me suspended surely on nothingness and drew me down into the\nfield of some force beneath. Far below me the voices faded. I swung\nfree--fell--plunged downward in sickening motion, head over heels, into\nthe abyss....\n\nMy feet struck hard flooring. I wrenched back to consciousness with a\njolt. Winds blew coldly in my face; the cabin walls had been flung back\nto the high-lying stars. I was standing at a barred window at the very\npinnacle of a tall tower, in the lap of a weird blueness that arched\nflickeringly in the night. I caught a glimpse of a startled face, a\nlean tired old face beneath a peaked hood, in the moment before my\nknees gave way and I fell, striking my head against the bars of the\nwindow.\n\nI was lying on a narrow, high bed in a room filled with doors and bars.\nI could see the edge of a carved mirror set in a frame, and the top\nof a chest of some kind. On a bench at the edge of my field of vision\nthere were two figures sitting. One was the old grey man, hunched\nwearily beneath his robe, wearing robes like a Tibetan Lama's, somber\nblack, and a peaked hood of grey. The other was a slimmer younger\nfigure, swathed in silken silvery veiling, with a thin opacity where\nthe face should have been, and a sort of opalescent shine of flesh\nthrough the silvery-sapphire silks. The figure was that of a boy or a\nslim immature girl; it sat erect, motionless, and for a long time I\nstudied it, curious, between half-opened lids. But when I blinked, it\nrose and passed through one of the multitudinous doors; at once a soft\nsibilance of draperies announced return. I sat up, getting my feet to\nthe floor, or almost there; the bed was higher than a hospital bed. The\nblue-robe held a handled mug, like a baby's drinking-cup, at me. I took\nit in my hand hesitated--\n\n\"Neither drug nor poison,\" said the blue-robe mockingly, and the voice\nwas as noncommittal as the veiled body; a sexless voice, soft alto, a\nwoman's or a boy's. \"Drink and be glad it is none of Karamy's brewing.\"\n\nI tasted the liquid in the mug; it had an indeterminate greenish look\nand a faint pungent taste I could not identify, although it reminded me\nvariously of anise and garlic. It seemed to remove the last traces of\nshock. I handed the cup back empty and looked sharply at the old man in\nthe Lama costume.\n\n\"You're--Rhys?\" I said. \"Where in hell have I gotten to?\" At least,\nthat's what I meant to say. Imagine my surprise when I found myself\nasking--in a language I'd never heard, but understood perfectly--\"To\nwhich of the domains of Zandru have I been consigned now?\" At the same\nmoment I became conscious of what I was wearing. It seemed to be an\nold-fashioned nightshirt, chopped off at the loins, deep crimson in\ncolor. \"Red flannels yet!\" I thought with a gulp of dismay. I checked\nmy impulse to get out of bed. Who could act sane in a red nightshirt?\n\n\"You might have the decency to explain where I am,\" I said. \"If you\nknow.\"\n\nThe tiredness seemed part of Rhys voice. \"Adric,\" he said wearily. \"Try\nto remember.\" He shrugged his lean shoulders. \"You are in your own\nTower. And you have been under restraint again. I am sorry.\" His voice\nsounded futile. I felt prickling shivers run down my backbone. In spite\nof the weird surroundings, the phrase \"under restraint\" had struck\nhome. I was a lunatic in an asylum.\n\nThe blue-robed one cut in in that smooth, sexless, faint-sarcastic\nvoice. \"While Karamy holds the amnesia-ray, Rhys, you will be\nexplaining it to him a dozen times a cycle. He will never be of use\nto us again. This time Karamy won. Adric; try to remember. You are at\nhome, in Narabedla.\"\n\nI shook my head. Nightshirt or no nightshirt, I'd face this on my feet.\nI walked to Rhys; put my clenched hands on his shoulders. \"Explain\nthis! Who am I supposed to be? You called me Adric. I'm no more Adric\nthan you are!\"\n\n\"Adric, you are not amusing!\" The blue-robe's voice was edged with\nanger. \"Use what intelligence you have left! You have had enough\n_sharig_ antidote to cure a _tharl_. Now. Who are you?\"\n\nThe words were meaningless. I stared, trapped. I clung to hold on to\nidentity. \"Adric--\" I said, bewildered. That was my name. Was it?\nWasn't it? No. I was Mike Kenscott. Hang on to that. Two and two are\nfour. The circumference equals the radius squared times pi. Four rulls\nis the chemming of twilp--_stop that!_ Mike Kenscott. Summer\n1954. Army serial number 13-48746. Karamy. I cradled my bursting head\nin my hands. \"I'm crazy. Or you are. Or we're both sane and this\nmonkey-business is all real.\"\n\n\"It is real,\" said Rhys, compassion in his tired face. \"He has been\nvery far on the Time Ellipse, Gamine. Adric, try to understand. This\nwas Karamy's work. She sent you out on a time line, far, very far into\nthe past. Into a time when the Earth was different--she hoped you would\ncome back changed, or mad.\" His eyes brooded. \"I think she succeeded.\nGamine, I have long outstayed my leave. I must return to my own\ntower--or die. Will you explain?\"\n\n\"I will.\" A hint of emotion flickered in the voice of Gamine. \"Go,\nMaster.\"\n\nRhys left the room, through one of the doors. Gamine turned impatiently\nto me again. \"We waste time this way. Fool, look at yourself!\"\n\nI strode to a mirror that lined one of the doors. Above the crimson\nnightshirt I saw a face--not my own. The sight rocked my mind. Out of\nthe mirror a man's face looked anxiously; a face eagle-thin, darkly\nmoustached, with sharp green eyes. The body belonging to the face that\nwas _not_ mine was lean and long and strongly muscled--and not\nquite human. I squeezed my eyes shut. This couldn't be--I opened my\neyes. The man in the red nightshirt I was wearing was still reflected\nthere.\n\nI turned my back on the mirror, walking to one of the barred windows\nto look down on the familiar outline of the Sierra Madre, about a\nhundred miles away. I couldn't have been mistaken. I knew that ridge\nof mountains. But between me and the mountains lay a thickly forested\nexpanse of land which looked like no scenery I had ever seen in my\nlife. I was standing near the pinnacle of a high tower; I dimly saw the\ncurve of another, just out of my line of vision. The whole landscape\nwas bathed in a curiously pinkish light; through an overcast sky I\ncould just make out, dimly, the shadowy disk of a watery red sun.\nThen--no, I wasn't dreaming, I really did see it--beyond it, a second\nsun; blue-white, shining brilliantly, pallid through the clouds, but\nbrighter than any sunlight I had ever seen.\n\nIt was proof enough for me. I turned desperately to Gamine behind me.\n\"Where have I gotten, to? Where--_when_ am I? Two suns--those\nmountains--\"\n\nThe change in Gamine's voice was swift; the veiled face lifted\nquestioningly to mine. What I had thought a veil was not that; it\nseemed to be more like a shimmering screen wrapped around the features\nso that Gamine was faceless, an invisible person with substance but\nno apprehensible characteristics. Yes, it was like that; as if there\nwas an invisible person wearing the curious silken draperies. But the\ninvisible flesh was solid enough. Hands like cold steel gripped my\nshoulders. \"You have been back? Back to the days before the second sun?\nAdric, tell me; did Earth truly have but one sun?\"\n\n\"Wait--\" I begged. \"You mean I've travelled in time?\"\n\nThe exultation faded from Gamine's voice imperceptibly. \"Never mind. It\nis improbable in any case. No, Adric; not really travelling. You were\nonly sent out on the Time Ellipse, till you contacted some one in that\nother Time. Perhaps you stayed in contact with his mind so long that\nyou think you are he?\"\n\n\"I'm not Adric--\" I raged. \"Adric sent me here--\"\n\nI saw the blurring around Gamine's invisible features twitch in a\nheadshake. \"It's never been proven that two minds can be interchanged\nlike that. Adric's body. Adric's brain. The brain convolutions, the\nmemory centers, the habit patterns--you'd still be Adric. The idea that\nyou are someone else is only an illusion of your conscious mind. It\nwill wear off.\"\n\nI shook my head, puzzled. \"I still don't believe it. Where am I?\"\n\nGamine moved impatiently. \"Oh, very well. You are Adric of Narabedla;\nand if you are sane again, Lord of the Crimson Tower. I am Gamine.\"\nThe swathed shoulders moved a little. \"You don't remember? I am a\nspell-singer.\"\n\nI jerked my elbow toward the window. \"Those are my own mountains out\nthere,\" I said roughly. \"I'm not Adric, whoever he is. My name's Mike\nKenscott, and your hanky-panky doesn't impress me. Take off that veil\nand let me see your face.\"\n\n\"I wish you meant that--\" a mournfulness breathed in the soft\ncontralto. A sudden fury blazed up in me from nowhere. \"And what right\nhave you to pry for that old fool Rhys? Get back to your own place,\nthen, spell-singer--\" I broke off, appalled. What was I saying? Worse,\nwhat did I mean by it? Gamine turned. The sexless voice was coldly\namused. \"Adric spoke then. Whoever sits in the seat of your soul, you\nare the same--and past redemption!\" The robes whispered sibilantly on\nthe floor as Gamine moved to the door. \"Karamy is welcome to her slave!\"\n\nThe door slammed.\n\nLeft alone, I flung myself down on the high bed, stubbornly\nconcentrating on Mike Kenscott, shutting out the vague blurred mystery\nin my mind that was Adric impinging on consciousness. I was not Adric.\nI would _not_ be. I dared not go to the window and look out at the\nterrifying two suns, even to see the reassurance of the familiar Sierra\nMadre skyline. A homesick terror was hurting in me.\n\nBut persistently the Adric memories came, a guilty feeling of a\nshirked duty, and a frightened face--a real face, not a blurred\nnothingness--beneath Gamine's blue veils. Memories of strange hunts and\na big bird on the pommel of a high saddle. A bird hooded like a falcon,\nin crimson.\n\nConsciousness of dress made me remember the--nightshirt--I still wore.\nMoving swiftly, without conscious thought, I went to a door and slid\nit open; pulled out some garments and dressed in them. Every garment\nin the closet was the same color; deep-hued crimson. I glanced in the\nmirror and a phrase Gamine had used broke the surface of my mind like\na leaping fish. \"Lord of the Crimson Tower.\" Well, I looked it. There\nhad been knives and swords in the closet; I took out one to look at it,\nand before I realized what I was doing I had belted it across my hip. I\nstared, decided to let it remain. It looked all right with the rest of\nthe costume. It felt right, too. Another door folded back noiselessly\nand a man stood looking at me.\n\nHe was young and would have been handsome in an effeminate way if his\nface had not been so arrogant. Lean, somehow catlike, it was easy to\ndetermine that he was akin to Adric, or me, even before the automatic\nhabit of memory fitted name and identity to him. \"Evarin,\" I said,\nwarily.\n\nHe came forward, moving so softly that for an uneasy moment I wondered\nif he had pads like a cat's on his feet. He wore deep green from head\nto foot, similar to the crimson garments that clothed me. His face had\na flickering, as if he could at a moment's notice raise a barrier of\ninvisibility like Gamine's about himself. He didn't look as human as I.\n\n\"I have seen Gamine,\" he said. \"She says you are awake, and as sane as\nyou ever were. We of Narabedla are not so strong that we can afford to\nwaste even a broken tool like you.\"\n\nWrath--Adric's wrath--boiled up in me; but Evarin moved lithely\nbackward. \"I am not Gamine,\" he warned. \"And I will not be served like\nGamine has been served. Take care.\"\n\n\"Take care yourself,\" I muttered, knowing little else I could have\nsaid. Evarin drew back thin lips. \"Why? You have been sent out on the\nTime Ellipse till you are only a shadow of yourself. But all this is\nbeside the point. Karamy says you are to be freed, so the seals are off\nall the doors, and the Crimson Tower is no longer a prison to you. Come\nand go as you please. Karamy--\" his lips formed a sneer. \"If you call\n_that_ freedom!\"\n\nI said slowly, \"You think I'm not crazy?\"\n\nEvarin snorted. \"Except where Karamy is concerned, you never were. What\nis that to me? I have everything I need. The Dreamer gives me good\nhunting and slaves enough to do my bidding. For the rest, I am the\nToymaker. I need little. But you--\" his voice leaped with contempt,\n\"you ride time at Karamy's bidding--and your Dreamer walks--waiting the\ncoming of his power that he may destroy us all one day!\"\n\nI stared somberly at Evarin, standing still near the door. The words\nseemed to wake an almost personal shame in me. The boy watched and his\nface lost some of his bitterness. He said more quietly, \"The falcon\nflown cannot be recalled. I came only to tell you that you are free.\"\nHe turned, shrugging his thin shoulders, and walked to the window. \"As\nI say, if you call that freedom.\"\n\nI followed him to the window. The clouds were clearing; the two suns\nshone with a blinding brilliance. By looking far to the left I could\nsee a line of rainbow-tinted towers that rose into the sky, tall and\ncapped with slender spires. I could distinguish five clearly; one, the\nnearest, seemed made of a jewelled blue; one, clear emerald green;\ngolden, flame-colored, violet. There were more beyond, but the colors\nwere blurred and dim. They made a semicircle about a wooded park;\nbeyond them the familiar skyline of the mountains tugged old memories\nin my brain. The suns swung high in a sky that held no tint of blue,\nthat was as clear and colorless as ice. Abruptly I turned my back on it\nall. Evarin murmured, \"Narabedla. Last of the Rainbow Cities. Adric--how\nlong now?\"\n\nI did not answer. \"Karamy wants me?\"\n\nEvarin's laugh was only a soundless shaking of his thin shoulders.\n\"Karamy can wait. Better for you if she waited forever. Come along with\nme, or Gamine will be back. You don't want to see Gamine, do you?\" He\nsounded anxious; I shook my head. Emphatically, I did _not_ want\nto see that insidious spook again. \"No. Why? Should I?\"\n\nEvarin looked relieved. \"Come along, then. If I know Gamine, you're\npretty well muddled. Amnesiac. I'll explain. After all--\" his voice\nmocked, \"you _are_ my brother!\"\n\nHe thrust open the door and motioned me through. Instinctively I drew\nback, gesturing him to lead the way; he laughed soundlessly and went,\nand I followed, letting it slide shut behind me.\n\nWe went down stairs and more stairs. I walked at Evarin's side, one\npart of me wondering why I was not more panicky. I was a stranger in a\nworld gone insane, yet I had that outrageous calmness with which men\ndo fantastic things in a dream. I was simply taking one step after\nanother; knowing what to do with that part of me that was Adric. Gamine\nhad spoken of habit patterns, the convolutions of the brain. I had\nAdric's body. Only a superficial me, an outer ego, was still a strange,\nmuddled Mike Kenscott. The subconscious Adric was guiding me. I let him\nride. I felt it would be wise to be very much Adric around Evarin. We\nstepped into an elevator shaft which went down, curved around corners\nwith a speed that threw me against the wall, then began, slowly, to\nrise. I had long since lost all sense of direction. Abruptly the door\nof the shaft opened and we began to walk along a long, brilliantly\nilluminated passage. From somewhere we heard singing; a voice somewhere\nin the range of a trained boy's voice or a woman's mature contralto.\nGamine's voice. I could make no sense of the words; but Evarin halted\nto listen, swearing in a whisper. I thought the faraway voice sang my\nname and Evarin's, but I could not tell. \"What is it, Evarin?\"\n\nHe gave a short exclamation, the sense of which was lost on me.\n\n\"Come along,\" he said irritably, \"It is only the spell-singer, singing\nold Rhys back to sleep. You waked him this time, did you not? I wonder\nGamine permitted it. He is very near his last sleep--old Rhys. I\nthink you will send him there soon.\" Without giving me a chance to\nanswer--and for that matter, I had no answer ready--he pulled me aside\nbetween recessed walls and again the shaft in which we stood began to\nride. Eventually we stepped into a room at the top of another tower, a\nroom lavishly, even garishly furnished. Evarin flung himself carelessly\non a divan embroidered in silken purple and gestured me to follow his\nexample. \"Well, now tell me. Where in Time has Karamy sent you now?\"\n\n\"Karamy?\" I asked tentatively. Evarin's raucous laugh rang out again.\nHe said with seeming irrelevance, but with an odd air of confiding, \"My\none demand of the Dreamer is--freedom from that witch's spells. Some\nday I shall fashion a Toy for her. I am not the Toymaker of Narabedla\nfor nothing. I demand little enough of the Dreamers, Zandru knows! I\ndo not like to pay their price, but Karamy does not care what she pays.\nSo--\" he made a spreading movement of his hands, \"she has power over\neveryone, except me. Yes; assuredly I must make her a Toy. She sent you\nout on the Time Ellipse. I wonder who brought you back?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I've been out of my body too long. I can't remember\nmuch.\"\n\n\"You remember me,\" Evarin said. \"I wonder why she left you that?\nKaramy's amnesia-rays took the rest of your memory. She never trusted\nme that far before.\"\n\nBut I caught the crafty look in his face. I knew only this about\nEvarin; Karamy was right not to trust him. I said, \"I only remember your\nname. Nothing more.\"\n\nBecause Evarin--I knew--was never ten minutes the same. He would\nprofess friendship and mean friendship; ten minutes later, still in\nfriendship, he would flay the skin from my body and count it only an\nexquisite joke. I did not like those perverted and subtle eyes. He\nseemed to read my thought. \"Good, we will be strangers. Brothers are\ntoo--\" he let the word trail off, unfinished. \"What have you forgotten?\"\n\nCould I trust him with my terrible puzzlement? How much could I, as\nAdric--and I _must_ be Adric to him--get along without knowing?\nWhat was even more to the point, how many questions could I dare ask\nwithout betraying my own helplessness? I compromised. \"What are the\nDreamers?\"\n\nThat _had_ been the wrong question.\n\n\"Zandru. Adric, you have been far indeed! You must have been back\nbefore the Cataclysm! Well--our forefathers, after the Cataclysm,\nruled this planet and built the Rainbow Cities. That was before the\nCompact that killed machines. Some people say the Dreamers were born\nfrom the dead machines.\"\n\nHe began to pace the floor restlessly. \"They were men--once,\" he said.\n\"They are born from men and women. Mendel knows what caused them. But\none in every ten million men is such a freak--a Dreamer. Some say they\ncame out of the Cataclysm; some say they are the souls of the dead\nMachines. They are human--and not human. They were telepaths. They\ncould control everything--things, minds, people. They could throw\nillusions around things and men--they contested our rules.\"\n\nHe sat down; his voice became brooding, quiet. \"One of us, here\nin Rainbow City, a dozen generations ago, found a way to bind the\nDreamers,\" he said. \"We could not kill them; they were deathless,\nnormally. But we could bind them in sleep. As they slept, under a\nforced stasis, we could make them give up their powers--to us. So that\nwe controlled the things _they_ controlled. For a price.\" There\nwas a glimpse of horror behind his eyes. \"You know the price. It is\nhigh.\"\n\nI kept silent. I wanted Evarin to go on.\n\nHe shivered a little, shook his head and the horror vanished. \"So each\nof us has a Dreamer of his own who can grant him power to do as he\nwills. And after years and years, as the Dreamers grow old, they grow\nmortal. They can be killed. And fewer are born, now; fewer to each\ngeneration. As they grow older and weaker, it is safe to let them wake;\nbut never too strongly, or too long.\" He laughed, bitterly. A fury\ncame from nowhere into his face.\n\n\"And you loosed a Dreamer!\" he cried. \"A Dreamer with all his power\nhardly come upon him! He is harmless as yet--but he wakes, and he\nwalks! And one day the power will come upon him--and he will destroy\nus all!\" Evarin's thin features were drawn with despair; not arrogant,\nnow, but full of suffering. \"A Dreamer--\", he sighed. \"A Dreamer, and\nyou had been made one with him already! Can you see now why we do not\ntrust you--brother?\"\n\nWithout answering I rose and went to the window. This window did not\nlook on the neat little park, but on a vast tract of wild country. Far\naway, curious trails of smoke spiralled up into the sunlight and a\nwispy fog lay in the bottomlands.\n\n\"Down there,\" said Evarin in a low voice, \"Down there the Dreamer walks\nand waits! Down there--\"\n\nBut I did not hear the rest, for my mind completed it. Down there--\n\nDown there is my lost memory. Down there was my life.\n\nSomewhere down there I had left my soul.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nFlowers of Danger\n\n\nI turned my back on the window. \"Rhys is a Dreamer,\" I said with slow\ncertainty. \"What is Gamine?\"\n\nEvarin nodded slowly, ignoring the question. \"Rhys is a Dreamer, yes.\nHe is old--so old he is almost mortal now; so he wakes, and he too\nwalks. But he was one of us once--the only Dreamer ever born within the\nRainbow City. His loyalty is double; but he will never harm Narabedla,\nbecause he is of our blood.\" Evarin cleared his throat. \"So Gamine\ntakes what knowledge can be had from his old, old mind. And does not\npay.\"\n\n\"Who is Gamine?\" I asked again. Evarin still hesitated.\n\n\"Karamy hates Gamine,\" he said, after minutes. \"So no man sees Gamine's\nface. I would not ask too many questions--unless you ask them of\nKaramy.\" A smile flickered on the mobile features. \"Ask Karamy,\" he\nsaid gleefully, \"She will tell!\"\n\n\"She will?\" I said stupidly, because I could think of nothing else to\nsay. Evarin's grin was delicately malicious. \"Oh, I am sure of that!\nKaramy is quick to strike. Gamine and I have little love lost, but we\nagree on one thing; that Karamy's procession of slaves is monstrous.\nAnd that you are a fool to help Karamy pay for her--desires. Karamy is\nfar too fond of power in her own hands, to pay to put it into yours.\"\n\nKaramy. Karamy who took my memory--\n\n\"She did.\" Evarin murmured, and I realized I had spoken aloud. The room\nseemed full of a weighty silence. Evarin's prowling footsteps made no\nnoise as he came to my side. \"I can give it back to you, though. I have\nmade you a Toy.\" His effete voice rather disgusted me, and I moved\naway, but he followed. \"Look here, and find your memory.\"\n\nAnd he put something small and hard into my hand; something wrapped in\nsilvery silks.\n\nI raised my hand curiously, untwisting the wrappings. They were smooth\nand shining and colorless, with a bluish cast, like Gamine's veils;\nno fabric I had ever seen. Evarin backed slowly away from me. For an\ninstant all I could see was a blurred invisibility--like Gamine's face\nbehind the veils--then a sort of mirror became slowly visible. It did\nnot seem to reflect anything; rather, it was a coldly shining surface,\ncloudy, glittering from within. I bent to examine the pattern of the\nshadows that moved on the surface. There was a curious pull from the\nmirror, a cold that crept sluggishly from my hand. A familiar, soothing\ncold. As if drawn by a magnet, my eyes bent closer--\n\nRecognition crashed in my mind. Evarin--and his gilt deadly Toys.... I\ndashed the colorless thing to the floor, giving it a savage kick. The\nblurred invisibility wavered; I caught a glimpse of a tiny jewelled\nmechanism, before it sprang back to gray ice again. Evarin had backed\nhalfway across the room; I leaped at him, collaring the dandy and\nwrenching him close. \"I've a good mind to tie the thing across your\nthroat!\" I grated.\n\nEvarin's lip twisted up. Suddenly his whole face melted in a blurring\ninvisibility and I felt his whole substance evaporate from between\nmy hands. He writhed like smoke, and I leaped backward just as he\nmaterialized, whole and deadly, too close. \"I am always--guarded!\" he\njerked out at me, \"I might have known--\"\n\nHe stooped, reaching for the fallen toy. I kicked the little mirror\nout of his reach, bent to retrieve it. \"I'll keep this,\" I said, and\nwadding the insulated silk around it, I thrust it into a pocket.\nEvarin's eyes glared at me helplessly. \"You'll stay solid for awhile\nnow,\" I jeered. \"_Toymaker!_ Damned freak--\" I stormed out of the\nroom, leaving him rubbing his bruised shoulder.\n\nNow that Adric was back in control, I had no trouble discovering\nwhere I wanted to go. Some blind instinct led me through the maze\nof elevators and staircases; I stepped into servant's quarters,\nkitchens, a roomful of buzzing machinery I dismissed with a glance of\nfamiliarity; and finally found myself in the open, the semicircle of\nrainbow towers around me.\n\nOverhead the suns, red and white, sent a curious, double-shadowed\nlight downward through the neatly-trimmed trees. A little day moon,\nsmaller than any moon I had known, peeped, a curious crescent, over the\nedge of a mountain. The grass under my feet was just grass, but the\nbrightly-tinted flowers in mathematically regular beds were strange to\nme. Paths, bordered by narrow ditches to keep the pedestrian off the\nflowers, wandered in and out of this strange pleasaunce; I accepted all\nthis without conscious thought, but some unconscious scrap of memory\ngave me a vague practical reason for the ditches. I carefully avoided\nthem.\n\nFaint shrill music tugged siren-like at my ears; wordless, like\nGamine's crooning. Staring, I realized that the flowers themselves\nsang. The singing flowers of Karamy's garden--I remembered their lotus\nsong. A song of welcome? Or of danger?\n\nI was not alone in the garden. Men, kilted and belted in the same gaudy\nred and gold as the flowers, passed and repassed restlessly, unquiet\nas chained flames. For a moment the old vanity turned upper-most in my\nmind. For all her slaves, all her--lovers, Karamy paid tribute to the\nLord of the Crimson Tower! Paid--would continue to pay!\n\nThe men passed me, silent. They were sworded, but their swords were\nblunt, like children's toys; they were a regiment of corpses, of\nzombies. Their salutes as I passed were jerky, mechanical.\n\nA high note sang suddenly in the flowers; I felt, not heard, their\nempty parading cease. In a weird ballet they ranged themselves into\nblind lines that filed away nowhere; toy soldiers, all alike.\n\nAnd between the backs of the toy-soldiers and the patterned, painted\nflowers, I saw a man running. Another me, from another world, thought\nbriefly of the card-soldiers, flat on their faces in the Red Queen's\ngarden. Wonderland. I heard myself say, with half-conscious amusement,\n\"They all look so alike until you turn them over!\"\n\nThe man running between the ditched flower-beds was no dummy from a\npack of cards. I saw him beckon, still running. He called to me; to\nAdric.\n\n\"Adric! Karamy walks here--just listen to the flowers! I was afraid\nI'd have to get all the way into the tower to find you!\" His voice was\nurgent, breathless; he slid to a stop not three feet from me. \"Narayan\n_knew_ they'd freed you! He's outside the gates. He sent me to\nhelp. Come on!\"\n\nThe sight of the man touched another of those live-wires in my brain;\nthe name of _Narayan_, another still. \"Narayan--\" I said in dull\nrecognition. The word, on my lips, hit a chord of fear, of dread and\ndanger--\n\nBut I had come straight from Evarin. I knew the man; I knew the\nresponse he expected, but the brief glimpse into Evarin's mirror had\nset up a chain of actions I could not control. I tried to put out my\nhand in friendly greeting; instead I felt, with horror, my fingers\nat my belt and tried, without success, to halt the sword that flew\nwithout volition from its sheath. The man backed away, his eyes full\nof terror. \"Adric--no--the Sign--\" he held up one arm, deprecatingly,\nthen howled with agony, clutching the severed fingers. I heard my own\nvoice, savage, inhuman, the thin laughter of Evarin snarling through\nit. \"Sign?? There's a sign for you!\"\n\nThe man threw himself out of range; but his face, convulsed with pain,\nheld a stunned bewilderment. \"Adric--Narayan promised--you were sane--\"\nhe breathed.\n\nI forced my sword back into the scabbard, staring without comprehension\nat the blood from the wound I had inflicted, and at the darting heads\nof the flowers. I could not kill this man who carried the name of\nNarayan on his tongue.\n\nThe flowers twitched--stirred--threw tendrils at the man's bleeding\nhand. A quick nausea tightened my throat; I motioned urgently to him.\n\n\"Run!\" I begged, \"Quick, or I can't--\"\n\nThe flowers shrilled. The man threw back his head, his eyes wide with\npanic, and screamed.\n\n\"Karamy! Aiiieeeee--!\" he staggered back wildly, teetering on the\nedge of the ditch. I cried another warning, incoherent--but too\nlate. He trod on the flowers--stumbled across the little ditch. The\nwrithing flower-heads shot up shoulder-high. They screamed a wild\npaean of flower-music, and he fell among them, sprawling, floundering\nhelplessly. I heard him scream, hoarsely, horribly--I turned my eyes\naway. There was a wild thrashing, a flailing, a yell that died and\nechoed among the brilliant towers. There was a sort of purring murmur\nfrom the blossoms.\n\nThen the flowers stilled and were quiet, waving innocently behind their\nditches.\n\nKaramy, gold and fire, walked along the winding path through the trees.\nAnd in the space of a second I forgot the man who lay lifeless in the\nbed of the terrible flowers.\n\nKaramy was all gold. From her glowing crown of hair to the tips of her\nlittle slippers, she was one sunny shimmer; there was amber on her\nbrows and at her throat, and an amber rod twisted lightly between her\nfingers, its delicate movement outlining my face. Karamy's smile of\nwelcome was a dream which made me know I could be well content if this\nwere my world.\n\nBut old habit made me turn my face away; her eyes, cat-eyes of wide\nyellow, watched me slyly, but her face was turned to the sprawled man\nin the flowers. \"So? I thought I heard--something.\" Without taking her\neyes from my face, she spun the lucent rod. The flower-song rose again,\na soft keening wail. Two of the silent guards moved noiselessly through\nthe garden, and at an expressive movement of the rod, they lifted the\ncorpse and bore it away. The music died. The woman's hands went out to\npull me close.\n\n\"Adric, Adric! As soon as you are free, they pursue you! That is not\nwhat you want, is it?\"\n\n\"Isn't it?\" I asked shortly. I still could not look full at the\ncat-eyes, the caressing face. A memory scuttled, rabbit-fashion, across\nmy mind, giving name and identity to the man I had betrayed to the\nflowers.\n\nKaramy slid in front of me so I had to look at her, and the lovely lazy\nvoice murmured the name I was beginning to know. \"You are angry,\" the\nsoft voice caressed me, \"I knew it was not right to let Evarin near\nyou! Adric, we need you, Narabedla needs you! We felt betrayed when\nyou left us, when you shut yourself up alone with your stars! Have you\nforgotten, or are you still--my lover?\"\n\nIt rang phony! Phony, was the way I put it to myself. Part of me felt\nlike calling her a lying she-devil and having that much, at least, on\nrecord. But I was fast acquiring a double cunning. The animal cunning\nof Adric's old habit--and a desperate, trapped cunning of my own, born\nof a desperate fear of this unfamiliar world. There was nothing I could\ndo except ride on the surface and let my hunches take me where they\nwould. Karamy was very soft and sweet and something more than lovely\nin my arms and I held her crushingly close while I struggled with a\nmemory. Who was Karamy? Who--and what--was I?\n\nKaramy dropped her arms. The mantle of lazy seductiveness dropped with\nthem. She spoke with eager annoyance. \"You are still angry because\nI sent you on the Time Ellipse! You do not know it was for your own\ngood--you haven't learned your lesson yet--\"\n\nThat talk meant danger for me. I could think of only one way to silence\nit. She seemed to like it; but even with her lips acquiescent under\nmine, I was wary. Was I fooling her--or was she only playing my own\ngame, and playing it a little better?\n\n\"Now we can make plans,\" she said a little later, \"First, Gamine.\"\nShe looked sharply at me, but I kept my face expressionless. \"Gamine\nis always with the old Dreamer; she lets him wake; he will grow too\nstrong. We must send Rhys away from Narabedla. Gamine may stay or\nfollow him to exile. But Rhys must go.\"\n\n\"Rhys must go,\" I conceded.\n\n\"He should be slain, but Gamine will never do it,\" said Karamy with\na shrug that disposed of Rhys. \"Evarin--\" she snapped her jewelled\nfingers. \"His Dreamer sleeps sound! Evarin fears even his own power!\nMy Dreamer grows strong--but he serves me!\" The beautiful face looked\nruthless and savage. \"Your Dreamer walks--free in the forest! Only you\ncan re-bind him. You, with my help--Adric of the Crimson Tower!\"\n\nHer eyes smoldered. \"Yes, and my Dreamer shall serve you as well, till\nthen!\" She breathed. \"I will pay to put power in your hands!\"\n\nThe very phrase Evarin had used! A shudder stung me briefly.\n\nHer glowing face burned through my sting of fear. \"I go to the Dreamer\nthis night, Adric! Ride with me, and he shall lead you where the\nDreamer walks--and lead you back to power! I have said enough--\" the\nlambent eyes tilted at me, \"Have I not?\"\n\nShe had, and too much. For I knew now how the Dreamer must be paid. And\nthe small part of me that was still Mike Kenscott cowered; the rest of\nme accepted the memory with a shrug. It was this Adric part that spoke.\n\"I'll go. And afterward, I'll go into the forest where the Dreamer\nwalks--and bring him back to you!\"\n\nBut even as I swept Karamy into my arms and bent her head back roughly\nunder my mouth, a warning prickle iced my spine. I said, insinuatingly\n\"And then, Karamy--\" but my eyes narrowed over her golden head.\n\nKaramy had tricked me before this.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nTrapped!\n\n\nAfterward, when I had found my way back to the Crimson Tower, I\nsearched for hours for something that might give a clue to Adric's\nmystifying past. I was puzzled about this Adric who came and went as he\npleased in the chambers of my memory. But I found nothing; whoever had\nstolen Adric's memory, had made sure that nothing in his surroundings\nshould clear up the puzzle in his mind. I knew only one thing. Adric\nwas feared, disliked, distrusted by all the Narabedlans, and all except\nGamine had something to gain by feigning friendship. I could not decide\nwhether Karamy's attitude was love that pretended contempt to mold\nAdric, or me, to her will, or contempt that pretended love for the same\nreason. And although habit found affection for Evarin, I could not\ntrust him long. Trust a cyclone sooner than that half-mad effeminate!\nThe name, _Narayan_, stuck burr-like in my mind. Friend, or enemy?\nI sat at the barred window of Adric's high room, trying to force memory\nfrom the alien mind in which I was prisoner. And whether it was sheer\neffort of will, or the result of the fragmentary look in Evarin's\nmirror, or whether, as Gamine insisted, I was really Adric and Mike\nKenscott was a mere superficial illusion of my conscious mind, memory\ndid begin to pulse back.\n\nIn the early days....\n\nIn the early days, before the vagueness came on my mind, I, Adric of\nthe Crimson Tower, had been a power in the Rainbow City. The memories\nof that time were not the kind Mike Kenscott would have cared to own,\nbut I, as Adric, found them vastly pleasing. Unlike Gamine, who loved\nonly knowledge, or Evarin, who toyed with pleasure and trickery, I had\nwanted power. I had it, unlimited, from a Dreamer who stirred only\nvaguely in sleep. Half the known portions of this world had known the\nCrimson Tower as lord. And Karamy--\n\nSome memories were triumphant. Some were humorous in Adric's cynical\nmind. Some were terrible beyond guessing--for Adric had not counted\ncost, and even he shuddered from the price the Dreamer had exacted.\n\nThen, to this wilful and wild man, something had happened. I had no\nidea what; Karamy had reached that far back and blurred, though not\nentirely erased, my memory. It had something to do with a blond boy's\nface, lifted in incredulous terror--or joy; and a fleeing form, veiled,\nthat retreated down the long corridor of my mind, averting its face\nas I followed. Whatever had happened, it had come when Adric was sick\nwith blood and horror, when he was surfeited, even if momentarily, with\nconquest, and sickened at the price the Dreamer extorted. The power,\nforced through the mind of the Dreamer, called for energy; kinetic\nenergy, available from one source and one only. Adric had fed the\nDreamer with that power. For a while.\n\nOne day, as a whim, I had redeemed a young woman slave--then the\nvagueness came and choked me. I might think; I might burst my brain,\nbut so far and no farther my memories would carry me. I _could\nnot_ force memory of that chain of events. But after that, Adric's\nreign had collapsed like the unstable arch it had been. His armies\nscattered, and he had shut himself up or been imprisoned in his Tower;\nhis memories had been stolen and he had gone, or been sent, spinning\nalong a time line forward, or perhaps back, until somewhere in the\nabyss of time he touched Mike Kenscott.\n\nIt had been then, perhaps, that Adric had escaped. He had reached,\ndrawn Mike Kenscott back--and switched the two. It was a perfect escape\nfrom a life Adric had come to hate.\n\nBut I _was_ Adric. There was an explanation for that, too. The\nphysical body could not make the transit in time. I had Adric's body;\nthe convolutions of his brain, the synaptic links of habit. His memory\nbanks. Only the Ego, the super-imposed pattern of the conscious\nidentity, insisted I was Mike Kenscott. In Adric's body, the old\npatterns ruled, and to all intents and purposes, I _was_ Adric.\nAnd back in my own time, I thought, Adric was living in my body--living\nMike Kenscott's life, going through the motions, with only the same\nqueer lapses I was making here. And after a while, even these would\nstop. I was wholly trapped. Here, living Adric's life, the part of me\nthat was Adric would grow stronger and stronger till--he?--unseated the\nother identity wholly. And he, in my body? Andy, I thought with a wild\nswift fear, _what will he do to Andy_?\n\nNothing. He could not hurt Andy--not in my pattern--any more than I\ncould hate Evarin. Or could he?\n\nI had to get back! God, I _had_ to get back!\n\nWhen the white sun had set and the red sun glowed a darkening ember\nacross the Sierra, a summons came, brought by one of Karamy's\ntoy-soldier cohorts. I dressed--in crimson again, for there was no\nother clothing anywhere--and followed the voiceless sentry down through\na labyrinth of elevators, finally emerging into a long corridor. I\nstrode down it, hearing my own steps echo; a second rhythm joined them\nimperceptibly, and Gamine stole out of the darkness, swathed in the\nluminous veiling, creeping noiselessly as a ghost behind me. Later I\nbecame conscious of Evarin's padding cat-steps behind Gamine, trailing\nus, single-file. And other figures came from darkened recesses to\nstretch the silent parade; a slim girl in a winged cloak, flame color;\na dwarfed man who walked beneath the amethyst huddle of purple cap and\nfurs. Memory fitted names to them, but I did not speak to them, or they\nto me.\n\nAfter a long time, the immense corridor began to tilt upward, climbing\ntoward a glimmer of light at the end. Without realizing it I had swung\ninto an arrogant, loping stride; now I brushed away the slave-soldier\nwho headed the column and took the lead myself. Behind me the others\nfell into place as if I had bidden them; the flame-clothed girl in the\nwinged cloak, the cat-footed Evarin, the dwarf bent in his jester's\ncap, Gamine in the blue shroud. Without warning, we came out into a\nvast court; an enclosed space, yet wide as the outdoors, a yard, a\nplaza, a place of imposing grandeur. A place of memory.\n\nThe red sun above us glowed like a lurid coal. There were tall pillars\non three sides of the courtyard, and at the far end, a vaulted archway\nled into a treelined drive that stretched away for miles into the\ntwilight. Between two pillars, Karamy waited; slim, shimmering golden\nfrom head to foot. A hungry impatience sparked in her cat's eyes.\n\"You're late.\"\n\n\"I'm ready,\" I said. What I was ready for, I was not sure.\n\nKaramy waved an impatient signal to the Narabedlans who were coming up.\n\"Adric is with us again,\" she said in her curious lazy voice, \"Your\nallegiance to Adric--children of the Rainbow!\"\n\nI stood at her side, mute, waiting; a guard of silent men behind us.\n\"Lord Idris;\" Karamy summoned. The hunchback came to bow jerkily before\nus. \"Welcome home--Lord!\"\n\nThe girl in flame-color darted to where we stood and her dipping curtsy\nwas like the waver of a moth toward a flame. \"Adric--\" she murmured.\nThe wings of her cloak lifted and fluttered across her shoulders as if\nthey would fly of themselves. She was a shy thing, and her dark hair\nwaved softly as if it too were winged. I touched her fingers lightly,\nbut under the smolder of Karamy's gaze I let her go. She watched me,\nshyly, with averted face.\n\nEvarin's face was slyly malicious, but his voice was pure silk. \"It\nis--pleasure to follow you again, my brother,\" he almost purred, and I\nscowled at the mockery at his face and refused his offered hand. Only\nGamine said nothing, coming forward on gliding feet to bow briefly\nand retire; but the silver-sweet, sexless voice of the spell-singer\nmurmured in a singing, almost wordless, croon.\n\n\"Save your spells, Gamine,\" said Karamy savagely, and Evarin jerked\nround at the shrouded form, but Gamine heeded neither of them, and the\nsweet contralto chanting went on.\n\nFrom somewhere the silent men brought horses. Horses--here, in this\nnightmare world? I had never been on a horse in my life. I found myself\nvaulting, with a nice co-ordination of movement, into the saddle. The\ncourtyard, for all the bustle of department, seemed to hold the silence\nof a grave. Karamy kept me close to her. When we were all mounted, she\nthrew the amber rod upward, and the last rays of the red sun caught\nits rays and sent a pure shaft of light down the darkened alleyway\nlined with trees. At the sight of that gleam, a curiously familiar\nemotion stole through me. I threw up one arm over my head, mimicking\nKaramy's gesture. \"Ride!\" I shouted.\n\nAnd the flying steeds kept pace with mine.\n\nThe driveway under the arch of trees led for miles under the thick\nboughs. Through the easy drumming of hooves, I could still hear the\nsweet distant sound of Gamine's singing, which floated on the wind,\nkeeping pace with the rise and fall of the rolling road, in a quick\ncadence. The wind whipped Karamy's golden hair like a halo about\nher head. I glanced over my shoulder to where the rainbow towers\nstood, now black, silhouetted against the greater darkness of the\nmountains. Overhead in the pink sky, the crescent of the tiny moon was\nbrightening, and lower in the sky I saw another, wider disc, nearly at\nfull. Cold air was stinging my cheeks and nipping my bones with frost,\nand I felt the sparks struck from hooves beating on the frozen ground.\n\n_Cold!_ Yet in Karamy's garden flowers had glowed in a tropical\nglory--\n\nAnd for a moment, it was entirely Mike Kenscott--sick, bewildered and\npanicky--who glanced about him with horror, feeling the swirling cold\nand a colder chill from the golden sorceress at my side. It was Mike\nKenscott's will that jerked at the reins of the big gelding to end this\nfarce now--\n\n\"What is it?\" Karamy cried, over the noise of the hooves.\n\nAnd I heard my own voice, raised above the galloping rhythm, cry back\n\"Nothing!\" and call out a command to the horse.\n\nGood God! I was Mike Kenscott--but prisoner in a body that would\nnot obey me--a mind that persisted in thoughts and habits I could\nnot share, a--soul?--that would carry me to destruction! I was Mike\nKenscott--trapped on a nightmare ride through hell!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nWhere the Dreamer Walks\n\n\nI had been scared before. Now I was panicked, wild with a\nnerve-destroying fright. I'm not a coward. I set up a radar transmitter\nin Okinawa within ninety feet of a nest of Japs. That was something\nreal. I could face it. But under two suns and a pair of little moons,\nwith weird people I knew were not human--all right; I was a coward. I\nsteadied myself in the saddle, trying with every scrap of my will to\ncalm myself. If this was a nightmare, well, I'd had some beauties--\n\nBut it wasn't. I knew that. The frost hurting my face, the sound of\nshod steel on stones, the vivid colors around me, told me I was wide\nawake. Dreams are not techni-colored. And through all this I was riding\nhell-for-leather, my knees gripped on the saddle, guiding the horse\nwith the grip of my thighs--and I'd never been on a horse's back in my\nlife. Rode--and rode--\n\nWe had ridden about seven miles, and stopped twice to breathe the\nhorses, but we were still beneath the great archway of trees. The\nsky's pink sunset light had faded; the land was flooded with a blue,\nfluorescent starlight, a light I'd never seen before. I strained my\neyes upward through the black foliage. I suppose I had some confused\nidea of guessing _when_ I was by the stars. But the view to the\nNorth was hidden by mountains, and I don't know one constellation\nfrom another, with that single exception. A glance at Karamy, in this\nfright, un-nerved me; I touched the reins, dropped back till I rode\nbetween Gamine and the girl in flame-color. \"Adric,\" the spell-singer\nsaluted coolly, and the girl in the winged cloak threw back her hood;\nI saw dark eyes watching me from a pure, sweet young face. Before the\nluminous innocence of those eyes I wanted to cry out in protest. I was\nnot Adric, warlock of Narabedla. I was just a poor guy named Mike, I\nwas just--me. I rode beside Gamine for minutes, trying to think what I\nwould say.\n\nGamine's musical voice was not raised, yet it carried perfectly to my\nears. \"You seem wholly yourself again.\"\n\nI didn't answer. What was there to say? Still, there seemed to be\nsympathy in the sharply-edged tones. \"You will remember--perhaps too\nmuch--at the Dreamer's Keep.\"\n\n\"Gamine,\" I asked, \"Who is _Narayan_?\"\n\nI saw the blue robes quiver a little; across from Gamine, I saw a\ncurious flickering look pass across the face of the girl in the orange\nwinged cloak. But Gamine's answer was perfectly even and disinterested.\n\"The name is not familiar to me. Have you heard it, Cynara?\"\n\nThe girl did not answer, only moved her dark head a little.\n\n\"I should know,\" I mused. But the name _Cynara_ had touched\nanother of those live wires within my mind. Narayan. Cynara. Cynara and\nNarayan! If I could only remember! Suddenly I turned. \"Gamine--who are\nyou?\" Gamine sat quiet, eerily motionless on the tall horse. The robed\nfigure seemed to blend into the starlit shadows around us. I had the\nsudden feeling of having re-lived this moment before, then the veiled\nshoulders twitched impatiently.\n\n\"Is this an inquisition?\"\n\nRebuked, and stung by the arrogant voice, I touched my heel to my\nhorse's flank and rode forward to rejoin Karamy. Gamine! The hell with\nGamine!\n\nFor several minutes the road had been climbing, and now we topped the\nsummit of a little rise and abruptly the trees came to an end. By tacit\nconsent we all drew our horses to a walk. We stood atop the lip of a\nbroad bowl of land, perhaps thirty miles across, filled to the brim\nwith thick dark forest. Far out in this valley lay a cleared space, and\nin the center of that space lay a great tower; but not a slender and\nfairylike spire like the Towers of Rainbow City. This was a massive\ndonjon thrusting heavy shoulders upward into the moon-washed sky.\n\nThe Keep of the Dreamers.\n\nSomething in me murmured, \"This is the forest where the Dreamer\nwalks!\"--or had the murmured voice come from Gamine, motionless\nbehind me? Karamy rode eagerly, her face drawn tautly together, her\nslim tanned hands clenched on the reins. All this while I was Mike\nKenscott--but a Mike who watched himself without knowing what he would\ndo next, like those puzzling nightmares where a man is both actor and\naudience to some mummery being played. I watched myself say and do\nthings as if I were two men at once. In effect, I suppose I was....\nKaramy turned in her saddle, facing me.\n\n\"Adric,\" she murmured, \"Lead me where the Dreamer walks!\"\n\nI knew, with a sudden surety, that because of some bond between the\nfreed Dreamer and myself, I could do this. But again, something outside\nmyself told me what to say. \"That bond is broken, Karamy. Did you\nnot break it yourself? How can I guide you then?\" And for my reward\nI saw unsureness leap in her cat's eyes. That shot had told. Karamy\n_had_ been guessing, then!\n\nThe answer had shaken her. But this woman was a past mistress at\nsubtlety. She murmured, \"It can be forged again. That I swear.\"\n\nAh, but I knew how far to trust even Karamy's oaths!\n\nWe had dipped down into the bowl of forest and we were riding through\nthick woods, along a road that struggled windingly, with many curves\nand sharp corners. Adric knew this country; his knowledge made Mike\nKenscott shiver. He had hunted here, and for no fourlegged game. As if\nKaramy read my thoughts I hear her low laughter. \"So. My wrist aches\nfor the feel of a falcon. We'll hunt here again--soon, you and I!\"\nI was partly bewildered by her words, but they gave me a shivering\nexcitement, an insidious thrill.\n\nBehind me, I heard Gamine's chanting take on a new note. The words were\nstill indistinguishable, but the very tune screamed warning. A pulse\nbegan to twitch jerkily in my neck.\n\nWithout any warning, the road twisted. Karamy and I spurred our horses\nand rounded the curve in one swift, racing burst of speed--and were\nfairly in the trap before we knew it.\n\nIt was the agonized whinny of my horse, and the jolt of my body\nrighting itself automatically from the plunging animal beneath me,\nthat made me realize we had ridden straight on a chevaux-de-frise. I\nyelled, cursing, shouting to Karamy to get back, get back, but her own\nmomentum carried her on; I saw her light body fly out of the saddle and\ndisappear. The others, rounding the curve in a wild dash, were fairly\non the barrier already, and the place was a bedlam, a scramble, with\nriderless horses milling in a melee of curses and the screaming of\nwomen and the threshing of feet. I was out of my saddle in an instant,\nthrusting Gamine's mount back from the stabbing points fixed invisibly\nagainst the dark barrier in the road, shouting to Evarin and Idris.\nEvarin leaped to my side, catching at Karamy's wild horse, while I\ntore madly at the barrier where the woman had been thrown. Idris\nbore down on me, mounted. \"Go round!\" he shouted. I plunged through\nthe underbrush at the side of the road, with hasty feet twice snaked\nby long creepers. Past the barrier, the road lay open and deserted,\nand Karamy lay in a shimmer of crumpled silk, motionless. \"Gamine,\nEvarin--\" I bellowed, \"No one's here! Quick, Karamy is hurt--\"\n\nThe head and shoulders of Idris' horse thrust through the thick\nbrushwood. \"Is she dead?\" the dwarf muttered. I bent, thrusting my\nhand to her breasts. \"Her heart's beating. Only stunned. Get down,\" I\nordered. Idris scrambled, monkey-fashion, from the saddle. I lifted the\nwoman in my arms, but she did not move or open her eyes. Idris touched\nmy arm.\n\n\"Put her on the saddle,\" he suggested, and together we laid her across\nthe pommel. Suddenly, the dwarf cried out.\n\n\"What?\" I asked sharply.\n\n\"I hear--\"\n\nI never knew what Idris heard. His head vanished, as if snatched away\nby a giant's hand; a rough grip collared me, choking fingers clawed at\nmy throat, a thousand rockets went off in my head and I lay sprawling\nin the brushwood, eating dust, with an elephant sitting on my chest and\nthreatening hands gouging my throat. My last coherent thought before\nthe breath went out of me, was--\n\n\"I'm waking up!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n\nNarayan\n\n\nBut I wasn't. When I came to--it could only have been a few seconds\nthat I was unconscious--it was to hear Evarin snarling curses and Idris\nbarking incoherently with rage. I heard Karamy screaming my name, and\nstarted to answer, but the steely fingers were still at my throat\nand with that weight on top of me, I hadn't a chance. The fall, or\nsomething, had knocked Adric clean out of me. I was fuzzy-brained, but\nsane. I was an innocent bystander again.\n\nI could see Evarin and Idris in the road, casting wary glances at\nthe brushwood all around them. I could just make out the face of the\nman who was holding me pinned to the earth with his body. He had the\ngeneral build of a hippopotamus and a face to match. I squirmed, but\nthe threatening face came closer and I subsided. The man could have\nbroken me in two like a match.\n\nAround me in the thicket were dozens of crouching forms, fantastic\nsnipers with weapons at their shoulders. Weapons that could have been\ncrossbows or disintegrators, or both. \"Enter Buck Rogers,\" I thought\nwearily. I was beginning to feel faint again, and old welter-weight\non my stomach didn't help any. Abruptly he moved, delicate fingers\nknotting a gag in my gasping mouth; then the intolerable weight on\nmy chest was suddenly gone and I sucked in air with relief. The fat\nman eased himself cautiously up, and I felt a steel point caress my\nlowest rib. The threat didn't need words. I could see the Narabedlans\ngathered, a tight little knot in the road. The snipers around me were\nstill holding their weapons, but the fat man commanded in a low voice\n\"Don't fire! They're sure to have guards riding behind them--\" the\nvoice died to a rasping mutter, and I lay motionless, trying to dredge\nup some of Adric's memories that might help; but the only thing I got\nwas a fleeting memory of my own football days and a flying tackle by a\nPenn State halfback that had knocked me ten feet. Adric was gone; clean\ngone.\n\nThe Narabedlans were talking in low tones, Gamine the rallying-point\nround which they clustered. Evarin had his sword out, but even he did\nnot step toward the mantling thicket. Cynara was holding Evarin's arm,\nprotesting wildly. \"No, no, no, no! They'll kill Adric--\"\n\nSuddenly, between two breaths, the road was alive with mounted men. Who\nthey were, I never knew; I was quickly dragged to my feet and jerked\naway. Behind me I heard shouting, and steel, and saw thin flashes of\ncolored flame. Spots of black danced before my eyes as I stumbled along\nbetween two captors. I felt my sword dragged from my scabbard. Oh well,\nI thought wryly, now that Adric's run out on the party I don't know how\nto use it anyway.\n\nUnder the impetus of a knife I found myself clambering awkwardly into\na saddle, felt the horse running beneath me. There wasn't a chance of\ngetting away, and the frying pan couldn't be much worse than the fire,\nanyway.\n\nBehind us the noises of battle died away. The horse I rode raced,\nsure-footed, into the darkness. I hung on with both hands to keep\nfrom falling; only Adric's habitual reflexes kept me from tumbling\nignominiously to the ground. I don't think I had any more coherent\nthoughts until the jolting rhythm broke and we came out of the forest\ninto full moonlight and a glare of open fires.\n\nI raised my head and looked around me. We were in a grove, tree-ringed\nlike a Druid temple, lit by watch-fires and the waver of torches. Tents\nsprouted in the clearing, giving it an untidy, gypsy appearance; at the\nback was a white frame house with a flat roof and wide doors, but no\nwindows.\n\nMen and women were coming out of the tents everywhere. The talk was\na Pentecost of tongues, but I heard one name, repeated over and over\nagain.\n\n\"Narayan! Narayan!\" the shouts clamored.\n\nA slim young man, blond, dressed in rough brown, came from one of\nthe larger tents and walked deliberately toward me. The crowd drew\nback, widening to let him approach; before he came within twenty\nyards he made a signal to one of the men to untie my gag and let me\ndown. I stood, clinging to the saddle, exhausted; the young man came\nforward until he could almost have touched me, and studied my face\ndispassionately. At last he raised his head, turning to the fat man, my\ncaptor.\n\n\"This isn't Adric,\" he said. \"This man is a stranger.\"\n\nI should have been relieved; I don't know why I wasn't. Instead, my\nfirst reaction was bewilderment and angry annoyance. How could he tell\nthat? I was as furiously embarrassed as if I'd been accused of wearing\nstolen clothing. My beefy captor was as angry as I was. \"What do you\nmean, this isn't Adric?\" he demanded belligerently, \"We took him right\nout of their accursed cavalcade! If it isn't Adric, who is it?\"\n\n\"I wish I knew,\" Narayan muttered under his breath. His eyes, still\nfixed on my face, were level, disconcerting. He was tall and straightly\nbuilt, with pale blond hair cut square around his shoulders like a\nsquire from a Provencal ballad, and grey eyes that looked grave,\nbut friendly. I liked his looks, but he had a trace of the uncanny\nstillness I'd noticed in old Rhys, in Gamine. For a moment I decided to\ntell my whole fantastic story to this man with the grave eyes. He would\nsurely believe it. But to my surprise, he spoke and called me Adric;\ndefinitely, as if he had forgotten his doubts.\n\n\"Adric,\" he said, \"Do you still remember me? Or did Karamy take that\ntoo?\"\n\nI sighed. I didn't dare tell the truth, and I felt too chilled and\nexhausted and disoriented to lie convincingly. Yet lie I must, and do\nit well.\n\nThe fat man scowled and fronted Narayan. \"Karamy--Zandru's eyelashes!\"\nhe growled. \"Look you, did Brennan come back this afternoon? He knows\nhis way around Rainbow City. Ask Adric what happened to Brennan!\"\n\nThe clamoring broke out around us again, but Narayan never took his\neyes from my face as he answered gently, \"There is always danger, Raif.\nBlame no man unjustly. Brennan knew he faced all the dangers of Rainbow\nCity. And even Adric is not to blame if a she-witch has him under her\nspells.\"\n\n\"Traitor!\" Raif snarled at me and spat.\n\nI loosed the saddle-horn and stepped dizzily forward. \"You might try\nasking me,\" I said with a weary anger.\n\n\"Are you Adric of the Crimson Tower?\" fat Raif snapped.\n\n\"I don't know--\" I said tiredly. \"I don't know, I don't know!\"\n\nNarayan's eyes met mine in skeptical puzzlement. Abruptly he put out\none hand and took my wrist in a firm grip. \"We can't talk here, whoever\nyou are,\" he said, \"Come along.\"\n\nHe led me through the thinning crowd into the frame house at the\ngrove's edge; Raif and one other man trailed after us, the rest\nclustering hive-fashion around the door. Inside, in a great timbered\nroom, a fire burned and glowing globes chased away darkness. I went\ngratefully toward the fire; I was stiff with riding and I felt chilled\nand stupid and empty with the cold. From a wood settle near the fire,\na woman rose. She was slight and dark and around her shoulders the\nluminescent shimmer of her winged cloak flowed like another flame.\nCynara.\n\n\"Adric--\" she said half-aloud, holding out her hands. I took them,\npartly because she seemed to expect it, partly because the girl seemed\nthe only thing real in a world gone haywire. She flung her arms\nsuddenly around my neck and held herself to me with a shy deliberation.\n\"Adric, Adric, Adric--\" she begged, \"I slipped away in the dark--I\nsuppose Gamine knows--but they'll never find me here, no, never--\"\n\nNarayan's hand pulled the girl sternly away from me; she shrank before\nthe annoyance in his eyes. \"Please--Narayan, no--\"\n\nThe blond man looked at her without speaking for long moments. At last\nhe said gravely, \"Sister, you must go back to Narabedla. I would not\nmake you go if there was another way; but you must, for a time.\" He\nbeckoned to one of the men. \"Kerrel--\" he commanded, \"Take Cynara back\nto Rainbow City, but don't get caught. Cynara; tell them you were lost\nin the woods, or that you were caught and escaped.\"\n\nThe childish mouth trembled, and she turned to me appealingly, but I\ngave a little shrug. What was I supposed to do? Narayan gave Cynara a\ngentle push. \"Go with Kerrel, little sister,\" he ordered in a quiet\nvoice; Kerrel took her arm and they hurried out of the room, the winged\ncloak she wore fluttering on her shoulders. Narayan motioned to Raif to\nfollow them through the door. \"I'll talk with him alone.\"\n\nRaif's thick lips set stubbornly. He looked as if he'd be nasty in a\nfight. \"If he's Adric, and if he's under Karamy's devilments, then--\"\n\n\"I have faced Adric, and Karamy too,\" said Narayan with a friendly grin\nat the man. \"Get out, Raif; you're not my bodyguard, or even my nurse!\"\n\nThe fat man accepted dismissal reluctantly, and Narayan came to my\nside. There was real friendliness in his grin. \"Well,\" he said, \"Now we\nwill talk. You cannot kill me, any more than I could kill you, so we\nmay as well be truthful with each other. Why did you leave us, Adric?\nWhat has Karamy done to you this time?\"\n\nThe room reeled around me. I put out a hand to steady myself--when the\ndizziness cleared, Narayan's arm was around my shoulders and he was\nholding me up with a strength surprising in his slight frame. He let\nme settle down on the seat Cynara had left. \"You have been roughly\nhandled,\" he said in apology, \"Just sit still a minute. My men--\" he\nmade a deprecating little gesture, \"have had orders. And if I know\nKaramy's ways, you've been heavily drugged for a long time.\" His eyes\nstudied me intently. \"Better come and have a drink. And--when did you\neat last? You look half starved. That's the way of the _sharig_--\"\n\nI rubbed my forehead. \"I can't remember,\" I told him honestly.\n\n\"I thought so. Come along.\" Narayan went into the next room, assuming\nthat I would follow and that I knew my way around. After the insanely\nfurnished rooms in Rainbow City, I was a little surprised when the next\nroom proved to be a strictly functional and ordinary kitchen, equipped\nwith the usual items. Out of a relatively un-extraordinary icebox he\nassembled something that looked rather like the food I was accustomed\nto from the 20th century, and poured some kind of liquid into an\noddly shaped glass. He motioned me into a chair and set the things on\nthe table. \"Here, eat this. I know the drugs they give you; you'll\nhave more sense when you've eaten. We've plenty of time to talk, all\nnight if we choose.\" He saw me glance side-wise at the glass, laughed\nsketchily, and from the same bottle poured himself a drink and sat down\nopposite me, sipping it slowly. \"Go ahead. I won't poison you till I\nfind out what Karamy's up to.\"\n\nI laughed apologetically and started eating, with a mental shrug. It\nhad been at least forty-eight hours since I had last tasted food, and I\ndid justice to the plateful before me. Narayan sipped his drink--which,\nwhen I tasted mine, appeared to be excellent cognac--and watched me;\nand when I finally pushed the empty plate aside, he put back his glass\nand said \"Now. Who are you, and what happened?\"\n\nI felt better and stronger; more like myself than I'd felt since Rhys\nhad catapulted me into this world. But now that I was on the carpet, I\nfelt I must talk fast and convincingly before those searching grey eyes.\n\n\"Karamy had me shut in the Tower,\" I told him, \"I was freed today, and\nwe were on our way to the Dreamers Keep. Then your men came along.\nI didn't know if I was being rescued or captured. I still don't.\" I\nstared with purposeful blankness at Narayan; he stared back and I could\nfeel him debating what to do and say. Obviously, an Adric sane and\nglib and possibly untruthful was a different thing than an Adric too\nbewildered and shaken to tell anything but the truth. Finally Narayan\nsaid, \"I'm not sure what I ought to do or say, Adric. The bond between\nus isn't as strong as it was. You know that.\"\n\nI nodded, perturbed. Adric's thoughts seemed to be surging back,\ninsidiously, as if Narayan held the key to unlock them. What crazy\ndrama was going to be unfolded in my mind now?\n\nNarayan said, low; \"Karamy did it, I think.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" My own voice was as quiet as his own. \"Karamy sent me on the\nTime Ellipse. She knew I'd come back changed--or mad--or not at all. I\nthink--I think she wanted me to betray you again.\"\n\n\"Adric!\" Narayan reached out quickly and grabbed my arm, hard, above\nthe elbow, till I cried out with the pain of that steely grip and\ntwisted away, rubbing numbed flesh. \"Adric--\" Narayan repeated,\nunsteadily, \"Why do you say--betray me again? Betray me? Adric--it was\nyour hand that freed me! Zandru! Adric--\" he begged, \"_How much_\nhave you forgotten?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN\n\nBattle in my Brain\n\n\nThe fire in the other room had burned down to an ember. Without a\nglance my way, Narayan mended the fire; sat down, his legs stretched\ntoward the little blaze, his shin in his hands; waiting. I could not\nstand still. I walked, restless, around the room, speaking in little\njerks and half-sentences.\n\n\"You are the Dreamer,\" I said, \"I--I remember a little. I remember\nbeing bound to you. I remem-member when I--freed you. Not knowing what\nit might mean, not knowing you could have slain me on the ground of\nsacrifice.\"\n\n\"No!\" Narayan was as motionless as Gamine's veils, but his voice was\nharsh, strident. \"No, Adric, never that! We cannot--kill each other,\nyou and I. I could order you killed, I suppose, but I--I would never do\nthat unless there was no other way. Adric--is there any other way for\nme, for you?\"\n\nA bitterness spoke in my voice; neither side trusted Adric, both wanted\nhis allegiance. I tried to trim my words carefully between the two\npersonalities that were battling for mastery in me.\n\n\"It was Karamy,\" I said, \"who took Adric from you, and sent him,\nhalf-mad, back to the Crimson Tower. Karamy's magic stripped him of\npower, and sent him, gone mad, back to stargazing in Narabedla. But it\nwas _not_ Karamy's--\" the voice that was not quite mine shook,\nsuddenly, with my own weariness and the blank terror I'd been keeping\nat bay, \"It wasn't Karamy who sent _me_ here, I'm not Adric. You\nwere perfectly right. I'm no more Adric than--than you are. I'm in\nAdric's body, yes. He moves me like a puppet! I have his memories,\nhis--some of his thoughts--but he--\" my voice cracked suddenly on a\nnote of panic; I knew I sounded like a hysterical kid, but I couldn't\nstop my own crackup once it had broken loose. \"I'm not Adric, I'm not!\nI don't belong here at all! I don't--\"\n\nNarayan jumped up from the bench and I heard his hurrying steps, then\nhis steel hands were hard on my shoulders, swinging me around to face\nhim. \"All right,\" he said, \"Steady. It's all right.\"\n\nI drew a long breath and let it out again. \"Thanks,\" I said briefly,\nshamed. \"I'll be all right now.\"\n\nNarayan shrugged wearily. \"It's all right. I guessed you weren't Adric,\nof course, from the beginning. But I didn't think Adric, when it came\nto the test, would really do that to me. I had his promise. I suppose,\nfor him, it was an easy way out. A perfect way of escape.\" He sank down\non the bench again, dropping his head in his hands. After a little,\nhe looked up, and his voice sounded tired. \"This is difficult,\" he\nsaid. \"My men think you are Adric. I'd never be able to convince them\nyou aren't. Would you mind--pretending? You'll have to; otherwise--\"\nhe paused, and I saw disquiet in his face. He was not a man who would\nenjoy threatening, but I could understand his situation. They didn't\nknow me from Adam; I was just an outsider who messed things up by\nresembling Adric. Well, I was stuck. I hadn't liked the Narabedlans\nenough to give a hang what Narayan meant to do to them. Narayan, by\ncomparison, looked pretty decent. And there was no other way to save my\nskin. Adric wasn't too popular, it seemed and in Adric's body I hadn't\na chance. I laughed. \"I'll try,\" I told him. \"But what's this all\nabout?\"\n\nNarayan looked up again. \"That's right. You wouldn't know. You have\nsome of Adric's memory, I suppose, but not all. You remember who I am?\"\n\n\"Not entirely--\" I told him. I remembered some things. Narayan had been\nborn, some thirty years ago, into a respectable country family who were\nappalled to discover they had given birth to a mutant Dreamer, and\nwere only too glad to deliver him to the Narabedlans for the enforced\nstasis. I told Narayan.\n\n\"You remember the old Dreamer who served your House?\"\n\nI nodded. He had become old, mortal, weak--and had been eliminated. I\nbowed my head, although I had no personal guilt.\n\nAfterward, Narayan and I had been bound. \"I slept in the Dreamer's\nKeep--\" Narayan sounded reflective, almost guilty, \"I was wakened,\nand--given sacrifice. I learned to use my power and to give it up to\nAdric.\" A brooding horror was in the grey eyes; I realized that Narayan\ndwelt in his own personal private hell with the memory of what he had\ndone under the spell of Narabedla. \"Adric was--strong.\"\n\nYes, I thought; Adric had called on Narayan's new power without\ncounting cost. What wonder the memory maddened Narayan? The young\nDreamer seemed to win his silent fight for self-control. \"Well,\nyou--Adric, I mean--freed me. I found my sister again; Cynara. I was\nlike a child; I had to learn to live, to be alive again. I had been\ntrained to use my power only through the Sacrifice. I had to learn to\nuse it without. It wasn't easy.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked thoughtlessly. Narayan's eyes froze me. \"To use that\npower,\" he said in a tense, controlled voice, \"Took human life.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOutside the door I could hear the noises of the camp; the light of\ntheir watch-fires crept in through the cracks. It was too dark to see\nNarayan's face now, but I heard him moving restlessly about the room.\n\"I have harnessed the power somewhat,\" he said, \"I can use it, myself,\na little. Not much. Adric helped me; so did my sister. She had been\ntaken for Sacrifice, but you--Adric--redeemed her. Then--we were able\nto throw an illusion around Cynara. She is not of Narabedla; but we\nmade it seem as if she had always been there, in Rainbow City. We could\ndo that because Evarin is weak, and because Karamy did not care. It was\nRhys who made the Illusion.\"\n\n\"Rhys!\" The old Dreamer, the only one born in Narabedla--\n\n\"Yes; Gamine is careless with Rhys and lets him wake too long. Rhys and\nI have been in contact for a long time.\"\n\nI was hearing scraps of conversation from a vast abyss of time and\nspace, when I had been drawn in electric coma through Karamy's Time\nEllipse. _They will know, Narayan will know._ That had been old\nRhys. And Adric; _What have I to do with Narayan?_ Adric had\nbeen--still was--playing a fancy double game with Narayan; I started\nto open my lips to tell the young Dreamer about it, but he was still\ntalking. \"Rhys will not act, not directly, against Rainbow City. But he\ndid that much for us, and Gamine and Cynara are friends. We forgot--we\nall forgot--that Adric's allegiance belonged to Narabedla first. Until\nhe vanished.\" I heard the brooding heaviness in Narayan's voice. These\nmen had been friends. Narayan went on, \"I sent Brennan today, to find\nout. He didn't come back.\"\n\nI lowered my head and miserably told him what had happened to Brennan.\nNarayan's face in a flicker of firelight looked drawn and haggard. \"He\nwas a--brave man,\" Narayan said at last. \"But I don't blame you. After\nthe interchange, I think, there was a time when you went on living\nAdric's life. Thinking his thoughts. But now, I think, he will grow\nweaker in you. I _hope_. You--who are you, in your own world?\"\n\nI shrugged. The words would have meant nothing to Narayan. \"My name's\nMike Kenscott.\"\n\n\"Mi-ek,\" Narayan repeated, turning the strange word on his tongue.\n\"The men will call you Adric. I'd better, too. Later--\" he shrugged. I\ndidn't say anything; I was still convinced that I hadn't seen the last\nof Adric. But I didn't want to tell Narayan this. I liked the man.\n\nWithout warning, Narayan switched on lights. \"It's near dawn, and you\nmust be worn out. We've taught them to stay clear of the forests at\nnight, so we're safe enough here. They can't do much till they've been\nto the Dreamers Keep, in any case.\" With a sudden boyish friendliness\nhe put out his hand and I took it. \"I'm glad you're not Adric. He might\nbe hard to handle now--if he's changed so much.\"\n\nAs if the lights had been a signal, fat Raif came without knocking into\nthe room. Narayan crossed his hostile stare at me. \"He's all right,\nRaif,\" the Dreamer said. The fat face broke into a sudden, elephantine\nsmile. \"I'd better apologize, Adric. I had orders.\"\n\n\"Find him a place to sleep,\" Narayan suggested, and I followed Raif\nup a flight of low stairs into an inner room. There was a bed there,\nclean, but tumbled as if it had had another occupant not long ago. Raif\nsaid, \"Kerrel's gone with Cynara. You can sleep here.\"\n\nI kicked off my boots and crawled between the blankets, suddenly too\nweary even to answer. I had been two days without sleep, and most of\nthat time I had been under exhausting physical and mental strain. I saw\nRaif cautiously finger his weapons and sensed that whatever Narayan\nsaid, he was reserving judgment. He didn't take chances, this outside\nlieutenant of Narayan's. Sleepily I said, \"You can put that up, my\nfriend. I'm not going to move till I've had a good, long--\"\n\nI didn't even finish the sentence to myself. Instead I went to sleep.\n\nI had slept for hours. I came abruptly out of confused dreams to hear a\nshrill voice and to feel small hands pulling me upright. Cynara! \"Wake\nup, Adric--\" she wailed, \"Karamy and Evarin are riding today--hunting\n_you_!\"\n\nI sat up, dizzy-brained, far from alert. \"Cynara! How--\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind that--\" her voice was impatient, \"What can we\n_do_?\"\n\nI didn't know. I was still stupid with sleep, but I put a reassuring\narm around her shoulders. \"Don't be afraid,\" I told her, then,\nreleasing her, bent and began to pull on my boots. I heard the swift\npound of steps on the stairs, and Narayan shoved open the door,\ndragging a brown tunic over his head as he came. He stopped short at\nthe door, staring at his sister. \"Cynara, what are you doing here?\"\n\nShe repeated her news, and he sighed. He looked as if he hadn't slept\nat all. \"Well, never mind,\" he told her, \"The game was almost over,\nanyhow. Sooner or later they would have broken through the Illusion;\nRhys is too old now for that. You were lucky to get away. We'll have to\nstorm the Keep to-night--unless they have too-good hunting.\" He fumbled\nwith the laces of his shirt. A dead weariness was in his grey eyes;\nthey looked flat, almost glazed. He met my questioning stare and smiled\nruefully. \"The Dreamers stir,\" he told me, \"I am not yet free of--their\nneed. So I must be careful.\" Cynara shuddered and threw her arms around\nher brother's neck, clutching him with a fiercely sheltering clasp.\n\"Narayan, no--oh, no--don't--\"\n\nBut he was already deep in thought again. He freed her arms without\nimpatience. \"We'll meet that when the time comes, little sister. So\nKaramy and Evarin ride hunting. Who else. Idris?\" At her nod, his\nbrows contracted. \"All of them--but Gamine,\" he mused, and turned to\nme. \"Could you conceivably get through to Rhys? I don't dare--not with\nthat--that stirring.\"\n\nI understood, Narayan was still attuned to the terrible need of the\nsleeping Dreamers in the Keep. But I reminded him that only Gamine\ncould control old Rhys. He looked at me with a strange curious question\nin his eyes, but made no comment. My own mind was working strong. I\nwas unsure how I had gotten here in the house of the freed Dreamer.\nJust what had happened last night? I had thought Narayan would never\ntrust me again; but now, when I needed it most, I seemed to be in his\ncomplete confidence. Damn Karamy anyhow, meddling with my memory!\nAnd she had the audacity to fly Evarin's devil-birds after me--Adric,\nlord of the Crimson Tower! She should have a lesson she would not\nforget--and so should the presumptuous Gamine--and so should this\nwalking zombie who was staring at me stupidly, as if I were his equal!\nI said with a slow savagery, \"I think I can manage Gamine!\"\n\nNarayan was watching me anxiously. Gods of the Rainbow, what\npreposterous things had I said and done last night? I said, \"We'll take\nthem at the Dreamer's Keep,\" and saw his face clear.\n\n_But what you do not know, Narayan_, I added to myself with a\nsecret satisfaction, _is that you will join them there!_\n\nIt never occurred to them to question, to wonder if Adric today were\nthe Adric of last night. We went downstairs and snatched a quick\nbreakfast; Cynara tore off her winged flame-color cloak and stuffed it\nwrathfully into the fireplace. Her coarse grey dress beneath it made\nher shy prettiness more striking than ever; Cynara was not Karamy, but\nshe was a pretty thing; and Narayan could hardly fail to trust me when\nCynara perched on the arm of my chair and ran her dainty fingers over\nthe bruises on my face. \"Your roughs nearly killed him!\" she pouted at\nher brother.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not hurt,\" I smiled at her, making my voice gentle for her\near alone. But I scowled darkly into my plate; pushed the food away\nand strode out into the camp. Narayan shouted quickly, jumping up,\nsending his chair crashing to the floor, and he ran after me so that we\nwent down the steps together. \"Wait,\" he commanded in my ear, softly,\n\"Don't forget, to them you're still a traitor!\" He took my arm, and\nwe walked through every row of tents together, Narayan's expression\nalmost belligerent. I saw the faces of the men as they came from their\nimprovised shelter, saw suspicion gradually give way to tolerance and\nthen casual acceptance. Finally Narayan called to Raif. \"Stick to him,\nwill you, Raif? He's all right, but the men don't know it yet.\"\n\nI glanced at Narayan. \"Raif,\" I said tentatively, \"Can you find me\ntwelve men who know the way to Rainbow City and aren't afraid to come\nclose to it?\"\n\n\"I can,\" Raif said, and went to do it. I had to hide a smile. Before\nlong I would win back the place my foolishness had lost. The idiot\nwhose body I had shared briefly had almost put it beyond recovery, but\nin a way he had helped, too. His weakness had won Narayan's confidence.\nWell, one thing I knew, that futile idiot should not share the coming\ntriumph. Nor should Narayan.\n\nNarayan--fumbling in my pocket, I touched something smooth and hard.\nEvarin's mirror. Narayan, looking over my shoulder as I dragged it out,\nasked curiously, \"What's that?\"\n\nI pulled it out with a secret smile. \"One of Evarin's toys. Look at it,\nif you like.\"\n\nNarayan took it in his hand for a moment, without, however, untwisting\nthe silk. \"Go ahead,\" I urged, \"Unwrap it.\"\n\nI might have sounded too eager. Abruptly Narayan handed it back. \"Here.\nI don't know anything about Evarin.\"\n\nI had to conceal my disappointment. With a feigned indifference I\nthrust it back into the pocket. It did not matter. One way or another,\nNarayan would lose. For Evarin and Karamy rode a-hunting today--and I\nknew what their game would be!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT\n\nFalcons of Evarin\n\n\nI pulled my cloak closer about me, prickling with excitement, as I\nknelt between Raif and Kerrel in the tree-platform. Just beneath me,\nNarayan clung to a lower branch. My ears picked up the ring of distant\nhooves on frozen ground, and I smiled; I knew every nuance of this\nhunt, and Evarin might find his deadly birds not so obedient to his\ncall today. Not a scrap of me remembered another world where a dazed\nand bewildered man had flown at a living bird with his pocketknife.\n\nColdly I found myself considering possibilities. A snare there must\nbe; but who: Narayan himself? No; he was my only protection until I\ngot clear of this riffraff. Besides, if he ever unsheathed his power,\nunguarded like this, he could drain me as a spider sucks a trapped\nfly. No; it would have to be Raif. I had a grudge against the fat man,\nanyway. I pulled at his sleeve. \"Wait here for me,\" I said cunningly,\nand made as if to leave the platform. Raif walked smiling into the\ntrap. \"Here, Adric! Narayan gave orders you weren't to run into any\ndanger!\"\n\nGood, good! I didn't even have to order the man to his death; he\nvolunteered. \"Well,\" I protested, \"We want a scout out, to carry word\nwhen they come.\" _As if we wouldn't know!_\n\n\"I'll go,\" Raif said laconically, and leaned past me, touching\nNarayan's shoulder. He explained in a whisper--we were all whispering,\nalthough there was no reason for it--and Narayan nodded. \"Good idea.\nDon't show yourself.\"\n\nI held back laughter. _As if that would matter!_\n\nThe man swung down into the road. I heard his footsteps ring on the\nrock; heard them diminish, die in distance. Then--\n\nA clamoring, bestial cry ripped the air; a cry that seemed to ring and\necho up out of hell, a cry no human throat could compass--but I knew\nwho had screamed. That settled the fat man. Narayan jerked around, his\nblond face whiter. \"_Raif!_\" The word was a prayer.\n\nWe half-scrambled, half-leaped into the road. Side by side, we ran down\nthe road together.\n\nThe screaming of a bird warned me. I looked up--dodged quickly--over\nmy head a huge scarlet falcon, wide-winged, wheeled and darted in at\nme. Narayan's yell cut the air and I ducked, flinging a fold of cloak\nover my head. I ripped a knife from my belt; slashed upward, ducking my\nhead, keeping one arm before my eyes. The bird wavered away, hung in\nthe air, watching me with live green eyes that shifted with my every\nmovement. The falcon's trappings were green, bright against the scarlet\nwings.\n\nI knew who had flown this bird.\n\nThe falcon wheeled, banking like a plane, and rushed in again. No\negg had hatched these birds! I knew who had shaped these slapping\npinions! Over one corner of my cloak I saw Narayan pull his pistol-like\nelectrorod, and screamed warning. \"Drop it--quick!\" The birds could\nturn gunfire as easily as could Evarin himself, and if the falcon drew\none drop of my blood, then I was lost forever, slave to whoever had\nflown the bird. I thrust upward with the knife, dodging between the\nbird's wings. Men leaped toward us, knives out and ready. The bird\nscreamed wildly, flew upward a little ways, and hung watching us with\nthose curiously intelligent eyes. Another falcon and another winged\nacross the road, and a thin, uncanny screeing echoed in the icy air.\nI heard the jingle of little bells. Three birds, golden-trapped and\ngreen-trapped and harnessed in royal purple, swung above us; three\npairs of unwinking jewel-eyes hung motionless in a row. Beyond them\nthe darkening red sun made a line of blackening trees and silhouetted\nthree figures, a horse, motionless against the background of red sky.\nEvarin--Idris--and Karamy, intent on the falcon-play, three traitors\nbaiting the one who had escaped their hands.\n\nThe falcons poised--swept inward in massed attack. They darted between\nmy knife and Narayan's. Behind me a bestial scream rang out and I\nknew one of the falcons, at least, had drawn blood--that one of the\nmen behind us was not--ours! Turning and stumbling, the stricken man\nran blindly through the clearing, down the road--halfway to those\nsilhouetted figures he reeled, tripping across the body of a man who\nlay beneath his feet. Narayan gave a gasping, retching sound, and I\nwhirled in time to see him jerk out his electrorod, spasmodically, and\nfire shot after wild shot at the stumbling figure that had been our\nman. \"Fire--\" he panted to me, \"Don't let him--he wouldn't want to get\nto--them--\"\n\nI struck the weapon down. \"Idiot!\" I said savagely, \"Some hunting they\n_must_ have!\" Narayan began protesting, and I wrenched the rod\nfrom his hand. The man was far beyond firing range now. At Narayan's\nconvulsed face I nearly swore aloud. This weak fool would ruin\neverything! I said hastily, \"Don't waste your fire! We can take care of\n_them_ later--\" I waved a quick hand at the three on the ridge.\n\"There is no help for those caught by Evarin's birds.\"\n\nNarayan breathed hard, bracing himself in the road. I beckoned the\nothers close. \"Don't fire on the birds,\" I cautioned, tensely; \"It\nonly energizes them; they drain the energy from your fire! Use knives;\ncut their wings--_look out!_\" The falcons, like chain-lightning,\ntraced thin orbits down in a slapping confusion of wings and darting\nbeaks. I backed away from the purple-harnessed birds, flicking up my\ncloak, beating at the flapping wings. Our men, standing in a closed\ncircle back to back, fought them off with knives and with the ends of\ntheir cloaks thrown up, swatting them off; and three times I heard\nthe inhuman scream, three times I heard the lurching footsteps as a\nman--not human any more--broke from us and ran blindly to the distant\nridge. I heard Narayan shouting, whirled swiftly to face him--he ran\nto me, beating back the green-trapped bird that darted in and out on\nswift agile wings. The screeing of the falcons, the flapping of cloaks,\nthe panting of men hard-pressed, gave the whole scene a nightmare\nunrealness in which the only real thing was Narayan, fighting at my\nside. His gasp of inhuman effort made me whirl, by instinct, flinging\nup my cloak to protect my back, my knife thrust out to cover his\nthroat. He raked a long gash across the down-turned head of the falcon,\nwas rewarded with an unbirdlike scream of agony and the spasmodic\nopen-and-shut of the razor talons. They raked out--clawing. They\nfurrowed a slash in the Dreamer's arm. The razor beak darted in, ready\nto cut. I threw myself forward, unprotected, off balance, ready to\nstrike.\n\nAt the last minute talons and beak turned aside--drew back--darted\nswiftly, straight at me. And my knife was turned aside, guarding\nNarayan!\n\nBut Narayan jerked aside. His knife fell in the road, and his arm\nshot out--grabbed the bird behind the head, twisting convulsively so\nthe stabbing needle of a beak could not reach him. The darting head\nlunged, pecking at the cloak that wrapped his forearm; thrown forward,\nI stumbled against Narayan, carried by my own momentum, and we fell in\na tangle of cloaks and knives and thrashing legs and wings, asprawl in\nthe road. The deadly talons raked my face and his, but Narayan hung on\ngrimly, holding the deadly beak away. I thrust with the knife again\nand again; thin yellow blood spurted in great gushes, splattering us\nboth with burning venom; I snatched the wounded bird from the Dreamer's\nweakening hands twisted till I heard the lithe neck snap in my fingers.\nThe bird slumped, whatever had given it life--gone!\n\nAnd high on the ridge the dwarfed figure of Idris threw up his\nhands--fell--collapsed across the pommel of his saddle!\n\nNarayan's breath went out limply in a long sigh as we untangled our\ntwisted bodies. Our eyes met as we mopped away the blood. We grinned\nspontaneously. I liked this man! Almost I wished I need not send him\nback to tranced dream--what a waste!\n\nHe said, quietly, \"There is a life between us now.\"\n\nI twisted my face into a smile matching his. \"That's only one,\" I said.\n\"The rest--\" I turned, watching for a moment as the falcons tore at\nthe ring of men. \"Come on,\" Narayan shouted, and we flung ourselves\ninto the breach. I flung down my knife, snatched a sword from someone\nand swung it in great arcs which seemed somehow right and natural to\nme. The men scattered before the sword like scared chickens, and I went\nmad with hate, sweeping the sword in vicious semi-circles against the\nlashing birds ... the sword cut empty air, and I realized startlingly\nthat both birds lay cut to ribbons at my feet, their blood staining the\ndead leaves. Narayan's eyes swam, through a red haze, into my field of\nvision. They were watching me, trouble and fright in their greyness. I\nforced myself to sanity; dropped the sword atop the dead birds. I wiped\nmy forehead.\n\n\"That's that,\" I said banally.\n\nWe took toll of our losses, silently. Narayan, gasping with pain,\nrubbed a spot of the yellow blood from his face. \"That stuff burns!\" he\ngrimaced. I laughed tightly; he didn't have to tell me. We'd both have\nbadly festered burns to deal with tomorrow. But now, there was work--\n\n\"Look!\" One of the men stared and pointed upward, his face tense with\nfright. Another great bird of prey hung on poised pinions above us,\nsapphire eyes intent; but as we watched, it wheeled and swiftly winged\ntoward the Rainbow City. Not, however, before I had caught the azure\nshimmer of the bells and harness. A thin, sweet tinkling came from the\nflying bells, like a mocking echo of the spell-singer's voice.\n\n_Gamine!_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE\n\nThe Return of Adric\n\n\nBack in the windowless house, we snatched a hurried meal, cared for\nour slashed cuts, and tried to plan further. The others had not been\nidle while we fought the falcons. All day Narayan's vaunted army had\nbeen accumulating, I could hardly say assembling, in that great bowl of\nland between Narabedla and the Dreamer's Keep. There were perhaps four\nthousand men, armed with clumsy powder weapons, with worn swords that\nlooked as if they had been long buried, with pitchforks, scythes, even\nwith rude clubs viciously knobbed. I had been put to it to conceal my\ncontempt for this ragtag and bobtail of an army. And Narayan proposed\nto storm Rainbow City--with this! I was flabbergasted at the confidence\nthese men had in their young leader. So much the better, I thought,\ntake him from them and they'll scatter to their rat-holes and crofts\nagain! I felt my lips twisting in a bitter smile. They trusted Adric,\ntoo. When I had shown myself to them, their shouts had made the very\ntrees echo. Well--again the ironic smile came unbidden, that was just\nas well, too. When Narayan was re-prisoned, I could use the power of\ntheir lost leader to tear down what he himself had built. The thought\nwas exquisitely funny.\n\n\"What are you laughing about,\" Narayan asked. We were lounging on the\nsteps of the house, watching the men thronging around the camp. His\nslumberous grey eyes held deep sparks of fire, and without waiting\nfor my answer he went on, \"Think of it! The curse of the Dreamer's\nmagic lifted--what would it mean to this land, Adric? It means\nlife--hope--for millions of people!\"\n\nIn a way, Narayan was right. I could remember when I had shared that\ndream; when it had seemed somehow more worthy than a dream of personal\npower. Cynara came down the steps, bent and slipped her soft arms\naround my shoulder, and I drew her down. A volcano of hate so great I\nmust turn my face away burned up in me. This man was my equal--no, I\nadmitted grudgingly, my superior--and I hated him for it. I hated him\nbecause I knew that in his dream of power no one must suffer. I hated\nhim because, once, I had been weak enough to share his feelings.\n\nI said abruptly, \"Your plans are good, Narayan. There's just one thing\nwrong with them; they won't work. Storming Rainbow City won't get you\nanywhere. You could kill Karamy's slaves by the thousands, or the\nmillions, or the billions. But you couldn't kill Karamy, and you'd\nonly leave her free to enslave others. You've got to strike at them\nwhen they're in the Dreamer's Keep. When the Dreamers wake is the only\nmoment when they are vulnerable.\"\n\n\"But how can we get to the Dreamer's Keep, Adric? They go guarded a\nhundred times over, there.\"\n\n\"What's your army for?\" I asked him roughly, \"To knock down hay-cocks?\nSend your men to chase off the guards. I told you I could handle Rhys,\nif it came to that. He'll get us through to the Dreamer's Keep, if need\nbe.\"\n\n\"What about Gamine?\" Cynara asked practically. Gamine was the least\nof my worries, but I did not tell Cynara that. I listened to their\ncomments and suggestions a little contemptuously. Didn't they know\nthat when the Dreamers woke, the Narabedlans were vulnerable--to the\nDreamers alone? If I were there with Narayan, there was no question\nabout who would win.\n\nCynara scowled at the rip of talons across my face. \"You're hurt and\nyou never told me!\" she accused. \"Come this minute and let me take care\nof it!\" I almost laughed. Me--Adric of the Crimson Tower--being ordered\naround by a little country girl! I snorted, but spoke pleasantly. \"I'll\nlive, I expect. Come and sit here with us.\" I pulled her down at my\nside, but she leaned her head on her brother's knee, an unquietness\nin her face. She was a pretty thing, although the cause of all my\ntroubles. When I redeemed her from Karamy's slaves, for a whim, I had\nnot known she was Narayan's sister--Zandru's hells, but I had made a\nghastly slip! I had told Narayan there was no help for those touched by\nthe birds, when I myself had redeemed his own sister! Had he noticed?\nWould he attribute it to Karamy's meddling with my mind? I smothered\nan exclamation, and Cynara and Narayan looked up anxiously. \"You\n_are_ hurt, Adric!\"\n\nI shook my head. I fancied Narayan looking at me with suspicion, but\nI controlled myself. I reached out to draw Cynara to me, but she had\ndrawn back, rising lithely to her feet, like a dove poised for flight;\nonly her hands, small darting hands like candle-flames, remained in\nmine to pull me lightly to my feet. I tried to hold her, but she\nprotested, \"There is so much to be done--\" and I raised the slim hands\nto my lips before I let her go. The gesture pleased her, I could see;\nso much that I watched with contempt as she tripped away. Silly, simple\ngirl! It _would_ please her!\n\nIn the end it was only Narayan and Cynara who rode with me to Rainbow\nCity. Kerrel had taken the army, in sections, to set an ambush for\nKaramy's guards; we rode in the opposite direction, by a twisting side\nroad. Cynara rode beside me, her dark eyes glowing. There was dainty\nwitchery in Cynara, and a pretty trust that made me smile and promise\nrecklessly, \"We will win.\" It pleased me to think that I could comfort\nCynara for her brother's downfall. Once conditioned to Rainbow City,\nshe would forget her silly fancies and be a fair and lovely comrade. If\nshe continued to please me, it would be amusing to see this unformed\ncountry girl wield the power that had belonged to Karamy the Golden!\n\nIt took us an hour of hard riding to reach the lip of the great cup of\nland, where we paused, looking down the dark, almost-straight avenue\nof trees that led to the walls of Rainbow City. I whistled tunelessly\nbetween my teeth. \"Whatever we do, it will be wrong. We'd be taking\nquite a chance to ride up to the main gate; at the same time, they'll\nbe expecting us to sneak in the back way. They'd never expect us to\ncome by the front avenue.\"\n\n\"The deer walks safest at the hunter's door,\" Narayan quoted laughing.\n\"But won't they be expecting us to use that kind of logic?\"\n\nCynara giggled, subsided at my frown. \"At that rate,\" I said, \"We could\ngo on all night.\"\n\nNarayan reached overhead, snatching down a crackling sheaf of\nfrost-berries; selected one narrow pod. He held it between finger and\nthumb. \"Chance. Two seeds, we go around. Three, we ride straight up\nthe main gate. Agreed?\" I nodded, and he crushed the dry husk. One,\ntwo--three seeds rolled into my outstretched palm.\n\n\"Fate,\" Narayan said with a shrug. \"Ready, then?\"\n\nI jounced the seeds in my palm. \"One for Evarin, and one for Idris, and\none for Karamy,\" I said contemptuously, and flung the little black\nballs into the road. \"We'll scatter them like that!\"\n\nWe were lucky; the drive was deserted. If there were guards out for us\nat all, they had been posted somewhere on the secret paths. Straight\ntoward the towers we rode, under the westering red sun, and just before\ndusk we checked our horses and tethered them within a mile of the\nRainbow City, going forward cautiously on foot.\n\nI objected to this arrangement. \"I'll get in alone,\" I told them. \"If\nanything happens to me, we mustn't lose you as well!\"\n\n\"I'll stay,\" said Narayan briefly. \"If anything goes wrong, I'll be\nhere to help.\" Silently I damned the man's loyalty, but there was\nnothing I could say without spoiling the illusion I had worked so hard\nto create. I took his hand for a minute. \"Thank you.\" His voice was\nequally abrupt. \"Good luck, Adric.\" Cynara glanced at me briefly and\naway again. I walked away from them without looking back.\n\nIt was easy enough to find my way into the labyrinthine towers. I was\nnot Lord of the Crimson Tower without knowing its secrets. I climbed\nthe stairs swiftly, ransacked the place. To no avail. When she took my\nmemories, Karamy had also been careful to take everything which could\nconceivably give me any power over any of the Dreamers, even old Rhys.\nI went up more stairs till I stood at the very pinnacle of the tower,\nin Adric's star-room into which I had been catapulted--was it less than\nthree days ago? I stood at the high window, vaguely thinking of an\nolder Adric, an Adric who had watched the stars here, and not alone. I\ntraced back through the years, diving down deep into the seas of sudden\nmemory, and brought up the knowledge of--\n\n\"Mike Kenscott!\" said a voice behind me, and I whirled to look into the\nface of a man I had never seen before.\n\nHe had the primitive look of a man out of some forgotten past. I had\nseen such men as I swam in the light of the Time Ellipse. He was tall\nand clean-shaven; he looked athletic; his eyes were a ridiculous color,\ndark brown. He had hair. He looked angry, if he could be said to have\nan expression.\n\nBut he spoke, clearly and with a deliberate calm. \"Well, Mike\nKenscott,\" he said, in a language I had never heard, but found myself\nunderstanding perfectly, \"You have taken my place very nicely. I\nsuppose I should thank you. You've given me freedom, and Narayan's\ntrust--the rest I can do for myself!\" He laughed. \"In fact, you're so\nmuch _me_ that I'm not much of myself. But I _can_ force you\nback into your own body--\"\n\nThe man must be mad! At any rate, he'd insulted the Lord Adric, in his\nown Tower, and by Zandru's eyelashes, he'd pay for it! I flung myself\nat him with a yell of rage. My fingers dug into his throat--\n\nAnd I cried out in the stifling clutch of lean fingers grabbing at me,\nbiting at my neck, my shoulders--an agonizing wrench shuddered over my\nbody--\n\nI faced--\n\n_Adric!_\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER TEN\n\nWhen the Dreamers Wake\n\n\nOf course I understood, even while I fought, dizzy and reeling, to\nloose the deathgrip I had put on my own body. I was--back, I was Mike\nKenscott again--Adric loosed his hands of his own will, and stepped\naway, breathing hard. \"Thank you,\" he said in the raw voice that had\nbeen mine for so long, \"I myself could hardly have done better.\" With\na swift movement he snatched something from a little recess in the\nwall--pointed--and fired point-blank. A lance of grey mist stabbed out\nat me--\n\nTo my amazement, only a pleasant heat warmed me. I had enough\nsplit-second reasoning reflex left to fall in a slumped huddle to the\nground. I knew that was what he expected. Adric fumbled in his pockets,\ntook out the little mirror I had taken from Evarin, still wrapped in\nits protective silk. I watched, breathless, between narrowed eyelids.\nIf he would only open it--but instead he gave a shudder of disgust and\nflung it straight at me. With a braced, agonizing effort I made myself\nlie perfectly still, without flinching to avoid the blow. The mirror\nstruck my forehead. I felt blood break to the surface and trickle wetly\ndown my face. I heard Adric moving; heard receding steps and the risp\nof a closing door. He was gone.\n\nI moved. To this day I am not sure how I escaped death from Adric's\nweapon; but I think it was because I was in my own body. After I had\ntouched Adric the first time, I was immune to Earth electricity. In\nthis world, I think, I was immune to their force. I wiped the blood\nfrom my temple. Good Lord, there was Narayan--waiting with Cynara--I\nforgot that I had plotted against Narayan, remembering only that I had\nliked the man. I couldn't let Adric get to them--\n\nI grabbed the mirror, crammed it into a pocket. Against the nightmare\nhaste that drove me I ran to the closet, quickly, from the racks of\nweapons, chose a short ugly knife. I didn't need swordsman's training\nto use that. Thank God, I knew my way around, I could remember\neverything I'd done when I was Adric--but wait! I could also \"remember\"\nwhat he had done when _he_ was _me_! That meant Adric could\n\"remember\" everything I had done and planned with Narayan! This crazy\nbusiness of Identity! Even now, could I be sure which of us was who?\n\nI dashed out of the room, ran down the endless stairs three at a time.\nAt the entrance to Gamine's blue tower, a dangerous whirring of wings\nbeat around me; I staggered, almost fell backward. One of the murderous\nfalcons--the one in blue--darted, hanging poised in the stair-well\nabove me. I backed against the wall, hoping the bird would not attack.\nGamine had not flown falcon with the others.\n\nThe strong wings flapped in the closed space; I saw the dart of the\nvicious little beak. Blindly I struck upward with the knife, shielding\nmy eyes with the other hand, and was rewarded with a splatter of thin\nburning blood and a scream of unbirdlike agony. I ducked beneath the\nthrashing wings, and ran on up the stairs; behind me the dying falcon\nflapped, threshed and rolled down the stairs, a tangle of wings,\nlanding far below with a flailing thump.\n\nI was not quite sure what I meant to do. As I climbed, I thought\nswiftly. Gamine was no friend to Adric, I knew that. Adric had known\nmuch of Gamine and Rhys, and I drew on that knowledge, but even Adric\nhad not known much of the Spell-singer cloaked in that blurred halo of\ninvisibility. Had he ever seen Gamine?\n\nWhat was Adric doing now? I had served him well; won him Narayan's\ntrust, then turned him loose again in his own body, to destroy, betray\nthem! I hated Adric as I hope I may never hate again.\n\nAnd yet, I could not hate him wholly. To know all is to forgive much,\nand I had lived for three days and nights in Adric's body and brain;\nknowing his strengths and his weaknesses, his dreams and torments, I\ncould not condemn him utterly. A man may be forgiven much that he does\nfor a woman's bewitchments, and few men could be blamed for allowing\nKaramy to enslave them. Adric had done good, once, too; he had freed\nthe Dreamer, he had loved--but he had trapped me here, and for that, my\nhate would make him pay--thoroughly!\n\nA shadow flitted across my sight; the robed Gamine barred my way, an\nair of cold amusement around the poise of the hood and the blurred\ninvisible head. The Spell-singer laughed, mocking. \"How like you this\nbody, Adric? You are beaten now, for sure! The stranger works with\nNarayan--in _your_ body, Adric!\"\n\n\"I'm not Adric,\" I shouted. \"Adric's in his own body again! He's going\nafter Narayan--\"\n\n\"You expect me to believe that?\" Contempt stung me in Gamine's clear,\nsexless voice.\n\n\"Let me to Rhys,\" I begged. \"He'll know I'm telling the truth--damn\nit, let me by!\" Infuriated by the mocking laughter, I thrust my arm to\nmove Gamine forcibly from my path. Whatever Gamine was--man, woman,\nimp or boy--it was not human. Steel wires writhed between my hands.\nI struggled impotently in that bone-breaking grip; then with a swift\nimpulse thrust my hand quickly at the blurred invisibility where\nGamine's face should have been.\n\nGamine screamed--a thin cry of horror. Suddenly I knew where I had been\nthose two weeks I lay in the hospital,--when Adric lay, in my body,\ngone mad, in the hospital in my place. An instinct I had grown to trust\nwarned me to pull away sharply from Gamine's relaxed grip. I shouldered\nby and ran like hell.\n\nHalfway up the stairs I heard the Spell-singer's feet running behind\nme, and I quickened my stride and sprinted for the heavy door that\nbarred my way. I could feel Rhys' presence behind the door. I threw my\nweight against the door, twisting the handle frantically.\n\nThe door was locked.\n\nBehind me, I heard the padding tread of Gamine. Hopelessly, I put my\nback to the door, pulling my knife out again, and defied the creature.\n\nBehind me the door suddenly opened and I was flung backward, sprawling,\ninto the room within. \"Well, Mike,\" the old tired voice of Rhys said,\n\"Gamine is a fool, but you are no better. Yes, I knew you were coming,\nI knew Adric is going, I know where Narayan is and I know what they\nplan to do. There is only one person who can stop all this, Mike\nKenscott. You.\"\n\nGaping stupidly, I picked myself up from the floor. The old Dreamer,\nhis wrinkled face serene under the peaked hood, watched me placidly.\n\"What--how--\" I stammered.\n\n\"Gamine is a prescient. And I am not a complete fool.\" Rhys smiled\nwearily. The dreamy look of the very old or the very young was on his\nface. \"I cannot help you; but I will make Gamine help.\"\n\nThe spell-singer came into the room, and I could almost see resentment\nthrough that strange halo of nothingness. \"Gamine,\" Rhys said. \"It is\ntime. You, and Narayan, must go with him to the Dreamer's Keep.\"\n\n\"No--\" Gamine whispered in protest, \"Narayan--cannot go!\nHis--his--talisman was destroyed! Only outside the tower--he cannot go\nin!\"\n\n\"There is still--mine. Give it to him.\" At Gamine's cry of dismay,\nRhys' voice was suddenly a whip-lash. \"Give it to him, Gamine! I still\nhave power to--compel that! What does it matter what happens to me? I\nam old; it is Narayan's turn; your turn.\"\n\n\"I'll--keep it for Narayan--\" Gamine faltered.\n\n\"No!\" Rhys spoke sharply. \"While you keep it--and I am bound to\nyou--there is still the bondage. Give it to him!\"\n\nGamine sobbed harshly. From the silken veils she drew forth a small\njewelled thing; wrapped in insulating silk like Evarin's mirror. She\nuntwisted the silk. It was a tiny sword; not a dagger, but a perfectly\nmodelled sword, a Toy. Evarin's too; but different. I recalled that\nEvarin had called himself Toymaker. Gamine clung to it, the robed\nshoulders bent.\n\n\"Mike must take it,\" Rhys' voice was gentler. \"If you keep it, I am\nstill bound to you. If Adric had it, it would bind Narayan again. If\nMike keeps it--_near_ Narayan--Narayan is free. Free to go where\nhe will, even in the Dreamer's Keep. Give it to him, Gamine.\" Rhys sat\ndown, wearily, as if the effort of speech had tired him past bearing.\nI stood and listened with a rebellious patience; I was eager to be\ngone. But my eyes were on the little jewelled Toy in Gamine's hands.\nIt winked blue. It shimmered. It pulsed with a curious heartbeat,\nhypnotic. Rhys watched, too, his tired face intent and almost eager.\n\"Gamine; if Adric had seen you, had remembered--\"\n\n\"I want him to remember!\" Gamine's low wail keened weirdly in the\nsilent room. Rhys sighed.\n\n\"I am Narabedlan,\" he said at last, \"I could not destroy my own people.\nGamine is not bound--nor you, Mike Kenscott. I suppose I am a traitor;\nbut when I was born Narabedla was a fair city--without so many crimes\non its head. Go and warn Narayan, Mike.\"\n\nGamine hovered near me, intent, jealous, the shrouded eyes fixed on\nRhys. The old man spoke on in a fading voice. \"My poor city--now,\nGamine. Now. Give it to him and let me rest. Stand away from me, Mike;\nwell away; I do not want the bondage again from you.\"\n\nI did not understand and stood stupidly still. Gamine gave me an angry\npush. \"Over there, you fool!\" I reeled, recovered my balance, stood\nabout six feet from the couch where Rhys half-sat, half-lay. The old\nman laid one wrinkled hand on the toy sword Gamine held. He took his\nhand away.\n\n\"Now,\" he said quietly.\n\nGamine thrust the sword into my hand, and I felt a sudden stinging\nshock, like electric current, jolt my whole body. I saw Gamine's robed\nbody shiver with the same jolt. The Toy in my hand was suddenly heavy;\nheavy as if it were made of lead, and the tiny winking in the hilt was\ndarkened. The peaked hood of Rhys drooped until it covered the face.\n\nGamine caught my arm roughly and the steel of those narrow fingers bit\nto the bone as they hauled me almost bodily from the room. I heard the\necho of a sob in the Spell-singer's whispering croon.\n\n_Rhys--Farewell!_\n\nThe next thing I knew we were racing side by side down flight after\nflight of stairs. Together we fled through the subterranean passages of\nRainbow City. Outside, in the pillared court, a man ran toward us. His\nbrown tunic was ripped and torn; his blond hair was rumpled. A smudge\nof blood reddened his forehead. I gasped, \"Narayan!\"\n\nThe man whirled--saw us--pulled his weapon from his belt. There was no\ntime for explanations. I threw myself at his knees in a flying tackle\nno football coach would approve, but it did the trick. Narayan went\ndown under me, kicking. Gamine was not one to stand aside in a fight;\nthe robed figure rocketed forward, flung itself on the prone Narayan,\nholding him motionless with that steely strength. I wrenched the\nelectrorod from Narayan's relaxed fingers. \"Listen--\" I urged, \"I'm not\none of Karamy's men--Gamine, let him up!\"\n\n\"He's got Cynara--\" the Dreamer muttered dizzily, \"Cynara--who in\nZandru's hells are you?\" He picked himself up, gazing at me with a\nstunned, blank look. \"My name's Kenscott,\" I said briefly. Suddenly,\nfeeling it was the best way to establish my good-faith, I pulled out\nthe Toy Gamine had put in my hand. \"I've seen Rhys. He sent--this.\"\n\nNarayan stared at the thing in my hand, a double grief in his young\nface. \"Rhys--\" he muttered, \"I felt he was--gone!\" With bent head, he\nreached out to take the small thing from me.\n\nIn his hand it came alive. The small jewelled Toy seemed suddenly\nbrilliant, flaring, dazzling with a wild burst of faceted light, blue,\ngolden, crimson, flame-color. Gamine's low sweet voice breathed, \"In\nthe Dreamer's hands!\"\n\n\"In my hands,\" Narayan murmured in a choked, almost a tranced ecstasy.\nI broke in on their raptures rudely. \"Here, Narayan! Is it Adric who's\ngot Cynara?\"\n\nHe gulped; swallowed hard; thrust the Toy into a pocket and came back\nto himself, but that light was still in his eyes. He spoke with a\nhard restraint. \"Yes. Adric surprised me--knocked me out. When I came\nto, they were gone.\" He blinked once or twice; rubbed his eyes; then,\nresolutely fumbled for the little Toy and extended it to me. \"Here.\nKeep this till we get to the Dreamer's Keep.\"\n\nI took it without comment. Gamine slipped away; came back, leading\nhorses. \"I couldn't find a single guard,\" the cold voice murmured, \"I\nwonder where they are?\"\n\n\"Adric knows,\" said Narayan, tight-lipped.\n\nWe mounted.\n\nThe wind was rising. Above us the moons swung slowly in an indigo\nsky. Sparks flew from our hooves against the frosty stones. We were\nracing against time, and a nightmare panic had me while I gripped the\nsaddle of my racing horse. It took all my concentration to stick on\nthe animal's back, but I was acquiring balance and a feel for riding.\nThe ill wind was blowing some good, I thought inanely. Narayan's blond\nhair was frosty pale in the moonlight, and the eerie Gamine was a\nnightmare ghost, a phantom from nowhere. Far away we heard the spatter\nof gunfire, the screams of dying men, the ring of swords and spears.\nThinly Gamine chanted in the night. Narayan's face looked haunted.\n\"There are the guards--attacking--\" he jerked out over the hoof-noises.\n\nThe scream of falcons rang swiftly above Gamine's chant. The\ntoo-familiar beat of wings slapped around my head, and I flung up my\narm to knock away one serpentine neck. My terrified horse plunged and\nI rocked in the saddle nearly falling. Another bird swooped down on\nNarayan--another--then there were swarms of them, gold and purple and\ngreen, crimson, blue, flame-color. The air was thick with their wings.\nGamine screamed; I saw Narayan beat the air with his cloak. The veiled\nSpell-singer, crouched in the saddle, was lashing at them with the whip\nfrom her saddle. The lash kept the falcons at bay, but the razor talons\ncaught at the blue shroudings. Narayan, whip in one hand, sword in the\nother, beat round him in great arcs, and I heard one bird's death-cry\nsending ringing echoes to the sky. I flung round me with my knife--\n\n\"The mirror--\" screamed Gamine, \"Evarin's mirror! Quick, they're coming\nby millions!\"\n\nThey were coming in scores--hundreds, whirling and screeing. These\nwere not the soul-falcons, belled and elaborately endowed with the\nintelligence and cunning of their launcher. These were--machines.\nAlive, yes, but not a life we knew. Only the nightmare freak of a\nscience gone mad could produce--or control--these hateful things that\nwere filling the clean air, groping for us with needle beaks and talons\nand wild wings. Only Evarin--\n\nI fumbled blindly for the mirror, clumsily stripping the silks. A\nneedle-talon raked at my wrist, and by sheerest instinct I struck\nupward, turning the face of the mirror toward the bird.\n\nThe bird reeled in mid-air--flapped--fell. A tingling shock rattled\nthrough my arm. I dropped the mirror--leaped to catch it. The thing was\na perfect conductor. It--drained energy. I knew now why Evarin had\nbeen so anxious to have me--or Adric--look into its depths. It could\nhave touched the energy waves of my brain through my eyes. The birds\nwere brainless; all energy. I grabbed the mirror and held it upright; I\ncaught a half-glimpse, from the tail of my eye, of the weird lightnings\ncoiled inside it, but even that glimpse coiled my stomach in nervous\nknots. Shielding my face, I held it upward. The birds flew toward it\nlike a moth to the candle. Shock after shock flowed along my arm. Three\nmore of the horrible falcons fell limp, lifeless--drained.\n\nA strange exhilaration began to buoy me up. The force from the birds\nwas not electricity but a kindred force, which my nerves drank\ngreedily. I thrust the mirror out; was rewarded again by the surge of\npower, and again the birds, this time by dozens, flapped and fell.\n\nThen, as if whatever had loosed the army of falcons had realized their\nuselessness, the whole remaining force of the birds wheeled and fled,\nwinging swiftly over the land to the distant donjon that rose high and\nfar into the black midnight.\n\nRecalled--to the Dreamer's Keep!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\n\nThe Last Sacrifice\n\n\nThe flow of strength had renewed me; I felt that I could face whatever\ncame. I thrust Evarin's mirror into my pocket; flung a word to Narayan\nand we were riding again, Gamine racing behind us. The blue shroudings\nhad been torn to ribbons by the snappings of falcon-claws; I could see\nthe pallid gleam of naked flesh through the torn veils. The noise of\nbattle behind us grew more distinct; I could make out the explosions\nand the distant flashes of colored flame. I shuddered; even now that\nfrightful army of falcons might be winging to join Adric and Evarin.\nThe rebels could kill some of them, but for every falcon dead there\nwould be twenty more slaves for Narabedla! What could Narayan's men\nwith their scythes and pitchforks and rude rusty guns do against the\nincredible science of a Toymaker? Narayan's strained face was ghastly\nin the moonlight; I needed no telepathy to read his thoughts. Slaughter\nfor his men--what for his sister? Our horses seemed to lag, to drag\nthrough a mire of motionless, yet they were at the full gallop of their\nendurance. The sound of fighting grew closer. Everything in me cried\nout that I was an utter fool, riding full tilt into a battle in which I\nhad no stake. Yet something else told me, coldly and with a grim truth,\nthat all I possessed was what I might win today, for this was the only\nworld I would ever know; that I would never see my own world again.\n\nNever! And Adric should rot in a hell of his own choosing for that!\n\nThe sounds of fighting seemed very close. Narayan pulled up his horse\nso quickly that it nearly sent Gamine plunging into his back. He\nsaid in a low, concentrated voice, \"Adric isn't at the battle! This\nway--quick!\" He whirled the horse and dashed down a side road at right\nangles to the way we had been riding. If we had raced before, now our\nhorses seemed to fly. The battle raged behind us; I heard dim screams,\nthe neighing of wounded horses, the muffled sound of earth flying\nupward, exploded in fire. But it had a dreamy unreal quality, like\nnoises through a nightmare. We had left the forest and were riding\nacross a dark and hummocky plain. Moss padded our hoof-noises; now\nand then some small furry thing skittered across the track we were\nfollowing and twice my horse shied at swooping birds and my heart\nstopped until I saw they were not the falcons of Evarin.\n\nStark and black against a treeless horizon I could see the Dreamer's\nKeep, between the small crescents of the two lesser moons. The largest\none rode a golden orbit over my head. I rode hunched in the saddle, my\neyes on the vast cairn only a few miles away.\n\nSuddenly a vast arch of lightning spanned the sky above the\nDreamer's Keep. Blue lightning. I heard Narayan groan like a man\nin his death-agony. Twisting in my saddle, I saw brooding horror\non his face--mingled with pain--and a terrified satisfaction. \"The\nsacrifice--I still--feel it,\" he breathed in labored gasps, \"I\nstill--take from it--Mike! Mike--\" His voice held unbearable torture,\nand the veins in the fair face stood out, black and congested with\neffort. \"If I start to work for--them--promise--promise to shoot me--\"\n\n\"Oh God--\" I gasped.\n\n\"Mike, promise! Gamine!\"\n\nGamine spurred the horse to his side; I heard the low voice, sweet,\nalmost crooning. Again the vast arch of blueness spanned the sky.\nNarayan dug spurs savagely into the side of his horse and raced ahead\nof us. On the plain, limned starkly against the sky, a horseman\nappeared. He rode low in the saddle, his horse carrying a double\nburden, but racing fleetly--to the Keep of the Dreamers. I cursed--I\nknew that lean crouched figure, knew it as well as my own! Adric rode\nto the sacrifice--and before him, limp across his saddle, he bore\nCynara!\n\nThe rest of that nightmare ride is a blank in my mind. The next thing\nI remember clearly is reining up beneath the lee of the gaunt pile of\nrocks-on-rocks that was the Dreamer's Keep. There was no sign of Adric\nor Cynara, no sign of any living person, nothing but the incandescent\nblue lightning that rayed out now every four seconds or so; Narayan's\nface was a white death-mask, and Gamine's breathing came in short\nsobbing pants. I alone was free from the effect. My body throbbed and\ntingled with the weird energy set free in the night. We flung ourselves\nfrom our horses. Gamine tugged futilely at the torn veilings to conceal\nher face, and for the first time the blurred invisibility wavered and I\ncaught a glimpse of one blue eye, blue as the sky lightnings that rose\nand flared and died.\n\nThe lee of the tower dwarfed us with its massive bulk. Gamine clutched\nmy arm, the cruel fingers digging bruisingly into my flesh. \"Listen!\"\n\nI strained my ears. All I could hear was a low, not unpleasant humming,\nlike the singing drone of great bees or high-tension wires; but the\nsound struck both aliens with horror. Narayan opened his lips--\n\nI dug frantically in my other pocket; brought out the Toy Rhys had\ngiven me. At sight of it Narayan's haggard face relaxed a little. He\ncaught it from me with quick hands. \"Free of Adric--\" he breathed\nwith that swift erasure of tension I had seen before. He drew a long,\nmoaning sigh. He closed his eyes for a moment.\n\nSomewhere above us a scream rang out; a cry bestial in its mad appeal.\nIt broke the static immobility that held us, and Narayan, sliding the\nToy inside his shirt, turned and began to run around the Tower, Gamine\nand I panting at his heels.\n\nWe came around the corner beneath an arching outcrop of stone-work.\nNo one needed to give orders; as one, we scrambled up on the ledge,\ncrowding close together.\n\nI gripped my hand on the knife in my belt. It had a comforting feel. I\nneeded that.\n\nA framed archway let us look down into the inside of the Keep. Below\nus a voice cried out despairingly--unbelievingly. \"Adric--\" we heard\nCynara cry out, \"Adric, no--oh, no--\" Under our combined weight the\nglass shattered; we hurled inward. We found ourselves standing on a\ngreat shelf, about ten feet above the interior floor of the Keep,\nlooking down at a scene framed in stark horror. Golden Karamy, dwarfed\nIdris, Evarin--stood in a close circle about a ring of coffins which\ngleamed crystal--glowed with scintillant radiance. In the hand of each\nof them was a tiny, jewelled, faceted Toy, and in the coffins--\n\nGamine screamed.\n\n\"The Dreamers--\"\n\nNot till then did we see Adric and what he was doing. In the center\nof the ring of coffins a dais rose upright, horribly altar-like, and\na line of the mindless slaves, nude, vacant-eyed, defiled before the\naltar. As each slave stepped forward there was a shuddering moan from\nthe others, the tiny swords rose and fell and in a brilliant flame of\nblue light, the slave--was not! And Adric--Cynara struggling between\nhis hands--was thrusting her forward, into the space between the\ncoffins, toward the nexus of the blue light--toward the Sacrifice-stone\nof the Dreamers!\n\nThe sight put us beyond caution. We threw ourselves from the ledge--and\nwent down into a writhing, sprawling mass of living flesh. A barked\ncommand from Idris, and the slaves swarmed on us, drowning us in\nsmothering bodies. I kicked and sprawled and thrashed and scratched and\nbit my way to the top of the heap and somehow for a second, I rolled\nfree. That instant was enough. I was on my feet, the knife in my hand.\nDragging bodies clung at my heels; I kicked out savagely, felt my boot\nstrike naked flesh, felt and heard the pulpy sound of a skull crushing\nunder the impact of my heel. The sound rocked my stomach, but I was\nnot in a position to be fastidious. My eyes were swimming in trickling\nblood. Gamine clawed and thrust free and together we elbowed out of the\npress.\n\nEvarin sprang at me. I thrust blindly with the knife in my hand, ripped\ninto his shoulder, missing the throat by inches. I caught the Toy from\nhis hand as it fell free. A moment of the clinging, tearing melee--then\nwe three--Gamine and Narayan and I were standing back to back in the\ncentre of the ring of coffins. There was a long howl of pain and terror\nfrom Evarin and the four Narabedlans flung themselves backward in a\npanic terror. For within the coffins the Dreamers were waking!\n\nBut Adric was no coward. He threw himself quickly forward--caught\nat Cynara again, and with all the force in his lean arms he flung\nher--straight toward the nexus of blue light! Narayan and Gamine stood\nfrozen, bound by the Toys in their hands against the light, but I broke\nfree--I passed straight across the cone of blue lightning--\n\n_Unharmed!_ The blasting energy tingled pleasantly in my body as\nI caught Cynara in mid-air and reeled away from the force that would\nhave meant annihilation for her. Narayan broke away from the paralysis\nmomentarily and caught Cynara's staggering body from my arms. Then I\nfelt the impact as Adric's tall, heavy body crashed against me, felt\nthe shock as my fist smashed against his jaw and heard him grunt as we\nlocked into a clinch that carried us nearer--and nearer to that center\nof blue energy. A moment we swayed there, at the very edge of the\nlightning--then Evarin's tensed cat-body hit in the centre of my back--\n\nAgain the heat thrust needles through me. Adric was flung clear, but\nthere was an arch of blue that spanned the vault, a wild scream like\nthe death-cry of a panther, and the Toymaker was--\n\n_Gone!_\n\nWithin the coffins the blue lights wakened, as if the last flare of\nenergy had freed them. Quickly Idris and Karamy ran forward, quickly\nAdric leaped to join them, thrusting the Talisman Toys against the very\nlids of the coffins--but too late. The Toys in the hands of Narayan\nand Gamine spat glaring blue fire, and step by step the Narabedlans\nretreated; farther, farther, farther--\n\nThe coffins were suddenly empty. As if by magic, three old men and a\nwoman of surpassing beauty materialized about Narayan and Gamine. In\ntheir faces I could distinguish a curious likeness to Narayan and to\nold Rhys--and Narayan, within the circle of the Dreamers, reached out\nand flung the tattered veils from Gamine. A triumphant chant rushed\nsweetly from the lips of the Spell-singer as the veils came away and\nin the center of the mutants stood Gamine the Dreamer, dwarfing them\nall by a pure majesty; the majesty of a Dreamer who had never slept!\nA woman she was, slender and fair and very beautiful and as like to\nNarayan as a twin sister, and I thought of Isis and the young Osiris\nas the blue eyes blazed out and the lovely body arched upward in tall\nfreedom from the shrouding veils. Blue lightning swirled and faded\nand the Dreamer's tower was bathed in trembling irridescent rainbows.\nKaramy and Idris retreated step by step, slinking back into the\nshadows. Only Adric stood his ground.\n\nThe Rainbows died. The air was void and empty of energy. The Dreamers\nstood looking on the crouching Karamy with her hidden face, on the\nbent, gnarled dwarf, on Cynara, kneeling white and radiant, on Adric,\nwho stood with his lips parted, staring at Gamine like a man released\nfrom a spell. It was Gamine who spoke, her eyes resting on Karamy.\n\n\"She has done much evil.\"\n\nThe others clamored, but Gamine shook her head, long pale hair lifting\nelectrically around her face. \"No,\" she disclaimed softly, \"Why should\nthey die? They are only an old dwarf--a silly fool who could not make\nup his own mind--\" her eyes dwelt disquietingly on Adric. \"And Karamy.\nThey have no power, now we are freed. Pity them--now we are freed.\"\n\nAdric, slowly, drew himself upright. His slackly-parted lips set\nfirmly and he looked at Narayan with a dispassionate, stubborn shrug.\n\"Kill me, if you like.\"\n\n\"No, Gamine.\" Narayan stepped toward the man in crimson, \"Adric,\" he\nsaid in a strange, half-choked excitement, \"I want to see what you saw\nbefore--to see what sent you away--to see the thing that drove you mad.\nGamine's veils--Gamine, let him see! Show him, Gamine! Show him what he\nsaw then!\"\n\nGamine came forward slowly to where Karamy knelt. \"Stand up!\"\n\nSlowly Karamy rose to her feet. There was no hope in her eyes; no mercy\nin Gamine's. The two pairs of eyes, cat-yellow and blue, fought for a\nmoment; it was Karamy's that fell. The Dreamer woman smiled faintly.\n\"My brothers and my sisters,\" she said at last, \"Karamy is beautiful,\nis she not?\"\n\nI suppose no woman on earth has ever been or ever will be as beautiful\nas Karamy the Golden. She stood proudly, turning to Adric, and I saw\nlonging and love break forth in the man's eyes. He gazed and gazed, and\nKaramy laughed and held out her arms, and Adric, bemused, went toward\nher--\n\n\"Hold him,\" commanded Narayan tersely.\n\nOne of the Dreamers made a curious sign with his left hand and Adric\nwas arrested; stood gripped in a vise of invisible force.\n\n\"See?\" Gamine said in a ringing voice, \"But now see Karamy--shorn of\nthe Illusion her Dreamer threw! See the form of Karamy that she made\n_me_ wear! _This!_\" She reached out and touched Karamy with\nthe little Talisman she held.\n\nThere was a gasp of horror from many throats. Karamy--Karamy the\nGolden--there are no words for the change that took place before our\neyes. I was sick and retching with horror before the metamorphosis was\nhalf complete, and turned away my eyes; Cynara was sobbing softly into\nher skirt; but Adric, frozen, could not look away.\n\nGamine's laugh--low and sweet and doubly deadly for its\nsweetness--reached my ears. \"Shall I lend you my veils--sister?\" She\nmurmured, mocking, and again the horrible laugh. \"NO? Go _forth_!\"\nHer voice was a lashing whip, and with a broken wail, the thing that\nhad been Karamy threw up an arm across the staring sockets and fled\naway into the night. And we never saw it again.\n\nSo that was the end of Karamy the Golden--the end--\n\nA little later I found that Adric and I were staring stupidly at one\nanother, puzzled, but without animosity. Cynara came and slipped an arm\nround Adric, and I turned away, embarrassed, for the man was sobbing\nlike a child. I was amazed and sick with the enormity of all that I\nhad seen and done. I stood and shivered and shook with deadly chill. I\nsuppose it was reaction.\n\n\"Steady!\" Narayan's steely hand on my shoulder kept me once again from\nmaking an ass of myself. \"You've done us a big favor,\" he said after\na few minutes. \"I wish I had some adequate way of thanking you--not\nfor myself--for millions of people. Perhaps one day we'll find a way\nof sending you back to your own world, but--\" his shoulders moved\nnegatively, \"I can't say--\"\n\nAdric's lean non-human face peered over Narayan's shoulder. He looked\nsubdued, and spoke with a curious humility. He sounded sane. \"There\n_will_ be a way, some day. It will take time to find it, now,\nbut--there will be.\"\n\nSpontaneously we grinned at each other. I could not hate this man. I\nknew him too well. I knew, suddenly, that we would be friends. Which,\nindeed, is what happened.\n\nNarayan looked from one to the other of us, troubled; then Gamine's\nintent face was at his elbow.\n\n\"I'll see to these men,\" she said quietly. \"Narayan, they need you, and\nit's your responsibility. They have to be told why they were wakened,\nand how; there are slaves to be freed, armies--\"\n\nNarayan glanced guiltily over his shoulder at the other Dreamers who\nstood huddled together in a bewildered little knot. \"That's so,\" he\nacknowledged gravely, and went to his people. I watched him, feeling\nas if my one friend here had deserted me; but it had to be that way.\nNarayan was not our kind. He was the sort of man who could remodel a\nworld; but the look he sent us over his shoulder told Adric and I that\nwe should, if we liked, have a share in that work.\n\n\"Now Mike Kenscott,\" said Gamine, \"I want to talk to you.\"\n\nWe left Adric and Cynara in that place, and I cast a wistful glance\nback at them. Cynara was lovely, and very human, and I suppose I had\nhoped that in some way she would compensate for my enforced stay in\nthis world. But there was Adric--\n\nGamine and I stood on the steps of the Dreamer's Keep, and her voice,\nsoft and wistful, mourned in the grey dawn. \"No one ever knew I had the\nDreamer powers--except old Rhys. Rhys and I were bound together--he\nknew, and kept me close to him, hid me and helped me. One day Adric\nfound out. It--changed Adric. He--we freed Narayan together. Then\nKaramy made me what I was--what you saw. It hurt Adric--hurt something\nin him. I could have cured him, in time, but Karamy had him bewitched.\nShe stripped him of power, of memory. I do not know, but perhaps some\nday, Adric may remember that I was--I was--\"\n\n\"Gamine! Gamine!\" Adric's voice cried from within, and the next\nmoment he rushed forth--caught the Dreamer woman in his arms, and his\nmouth met hers and she stood swaying in his arms, laughing and crying\ntogether. Cynara, following slowly, smiled with gentle satisfaction. I\nsaid, stunned, \"What--\"\n\nOver Adric's shoulder Gamine's blue eyes met mine in liquid\nsatisfaction and she finished her interrupted sentence. \"I was Adric's\nwife,\" she said, gently.\n\nCynara's voice was tenderly humorous as we left them together in the\nglory of the rising sun. \"Poor Gamine,\" she said, \"and poor Adric, too.\nI was sorry for them both. But I wish these men would make up their\nminds!\"\n\nI had an idea.\n\n\"Adric's made up his mind,\" I said, turning my head a little toward the\ncouple who stood, clasped, as if they could never let go. \"I suppose--\"\nI came a little closer to Cynara, who stood looking up at me with wide,\ninnocent eyes and lips ingenuously parted, \"I suppose that gives me the\nright to make up my mind. Doesn't it?\"\n\nShe smiled. \"Does it?\" But her bright eyes had given me my answer, and\nI never had to make up my mind again.", "title": "Falcons of Narabedla"}

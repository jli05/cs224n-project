{"summary": "The Green Odyssey is a relatively straightforward adventure story, involving an astronaut named Alan Green stranded on a primitive planet, where he is claimed as a gigolo by a duchess and is married to a slave woman. Upon hearing of two other stranded astronauts, he escapes from the duchess, and sets sail to find them. However, because of the peculiar geography of the planet, there is a vast expansive plain, instead of an ocean to cross. Green uses a ship equipped with large rolling pin-like wheels along the bottom to traverse the plains of this world.\nAfter his escape from the duchess he is followed by his slave woman wife and her children (one is his). There follow several fairly standard adventure plots with cannibals, pirates, floating islands (that turn out to be giant lawnmowers), and the deus ex machina, a female black cat named Lady Luck.\n\n", "full_text": "THE GREEN ODYSSEY\n\n                         by Philip Jos� Farmer\n\n                          Make friends fast.\n                            --_Handbook For The Shipwrecked_\n\n                           Ballantine Books\n                               New York\n\n                          Copyright 1957, by\n                          Philip Jos� Farmer\n\n             Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 57-10603\n                Printed in the United States of America\n\n                           BALLANTINE BOOKS, INC.\n                           101 Fifth Avenue,\n                           New York 3, N.

THRILLS! ADVENTURE!\n\n\nAlan Green was not exactly a hero. In fact he liked peace just as\nwell as the next man. Not that he was really afraid of that crazy,\nhot-blooded hound-dog Alzo, or even of the hound's gorgeous owner, the\nDuchess Zuni--who was also hot-blooded (to say nothing of the Duke).\nAfter all, these things were understood on this backward, violent\nplanet, and a man could manage, provided he was alert twenty-four hours\na day.\n\nAnd as a matter of fact, Alan was only normally apprehensive of his\nJunoesque, tempestuous (but altogether lovable) wife Amra. Delightful,\ndemanding Amra--and her five uproarious kids. The trouble was, he was\ntired. And homesick.\n\nSo when he heard of two other downed spacemen, he hitched a ride with\na piratical merchant-captain on a windroller destined to carry him to\nthe spaceship and thence to the peaceful green hills of Earth. But\nhe had reckoned without the vagaries of the windroller, pirates, the\n\"traveling islands,\" the rascally Captain, and various flora and fauna\npeculiar to this planet--all of which, it now seemed, regarded Alan\nwith unnerving malevolence.\n\nAnd worst of all, Amra was determined that he should be a hero. Amra\nwon.\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nFor two years Alan Green had lived without hope. From the day the\nspaceship had crashed on this unknown planet he had resigned himself\nto the destiny created for him by accident and mathematics. Chances\nagainst another ship landing within the next hundred years were a\nmillion to one. Therefore it would do no good to sit around waiting\nfor rescue. Much as he loathed the idea, he must live the rest of his\nlife here, and he must squeeze as much blood as he could out of this\nplanet-sized turnip. There wasn't much to squeeze. In fact, it seemed\nto him that he was the one losing the blood. Shortly after he'd been\ncast away he'd been made a slave.\n\nNow, suddenly, he had hope.\n\nHope came to him a month after he'd been made foreman of the kitchen\nslaves of the Duke of Tropat. It came to him as he was standing behind\nthe Duchess during a meal and directing those who were waiting upon her.\n\nIt was the Duchess Zuni who had not so subtly maneuvered him from the\nlabor pens to his coveted, if dangerous, position. Why dangerous?\nBecause she was very jealous and possessive, and the slightest hint of\nlack of attention from him could mean he'd lose his life or one limb\nor another. The knowledge of what had happened to his two predecessors\nkept him extremely sensitive to her every gesture, her every wish.\n\nThat fateful morning he was standing behind her as she sat at one end\nof the long breakfast table. In one hand he held his foreman's wand,\na little white baton topped by a large red ball. With it he gestured\nat the slaves who served food, who poured wine and beer, who fanned\naway the flies, who carried in the household god and sat it on the god\nchair, who played something like music. Now and then he bent over the\nDuchess Zuni's long black hair and whispered phrases from this or that\nlove poem, praising her beauty, her supposed unattainability, and his\nburning, if seemingly hopeless, passion for her. Zuni would smile, or\nrepeat the formula of thanks--the short one--or else giggle at his\nfunny accent.\n\nThe Duke sat at the other end of the table. He ignored the by-play,\njust as he ignored the so-called secret passage inside the walls of the\ncastle, which Green used to get to the Duchess's apartments. Custom\ndemanded this, just as custom demanded that he should play the outraged\nhusband if she got tired of Green or angry at him and accused him\npublicly of amorous advances. This was enough to make Green jittery,\nbut he had more than the Duke to consider. There was Alzo.\n\nAlzo was the Duchess's watchdog, a mastiff-like monster with shaggy\nred-gold hair. The dog hated Green with a vindictiveness that Green\ncould only account for by supposing that the animal knew, perhaps from\nhis body-odor, that he was not a native of this planet. Alzo rumbled\na warning deep in his chest every time Green bent over the Duchess or\nmade a too-sudden movement. Occasionally he rose to his four feet and\nnuzzled the man's leg. When that happened Green could not keep from\nbreaking out into a sweat, for the dog had twice bitten him, playfully,\nso to speak, and severely lacerated his calf. As if that weren't bad\nenough, Green had to worry that the natives might notice that his scars\nhealed abnormally fast, almost overnight. He'd been forced to wear\nbandages on his legs long after the new skin had come in.\n\nEven now, the nauseating canine was sniffing around Green's quivering\nhide in the hope of putting the fear of the devil in him. At that\nmoment the Earthman resolved that, come the headsman's ax, rack, wheel,\nor other hellish tortures, he was going to kill that hound. It was just\nafter he made that vow that the Duchess caused him to forget altogether\nthe beast.\n\n\"Dear,\" said Zuni, interrupting the Duke in the midst of his\nconversation with a merchant-captain, \"what is this I hear about two\nmen who have fallen from the sky in a great ship of iron?\"\n\nGreen quivered, and he held his breath as he waited for the Duke's\nreply.\n\nThe Duke, a short, dark many-chinned man with white hair and very thick\nbristly salt-and-pepper eyebrows, frowned.\n\n\"Men? Demons, rather! Can men fly in an iron ship through the air?\nThese two claimed to have come from the stars, and you know what that\nmeans. Remember Oixrotl's prophecy: _A demon will come, claiming\nto be an angel_. No doubt about these two! Just to show you their\nsubtlety, they claim to be neither demon nor angels, but men! Now,\nthere's devilish clever thinking. Confusing to anybody but the most\nclear-headed. I'm glad the King of Estorya wasn't taken in.\"\n\nEagerly Zuni leaned forward, her large brown eyes bright, and her\nred-painted mouth open and wet. \"Oh, has he burned them already? What a\nshame! I should think he'd at least torture them for a while.\"\n\nMiran, the merchant-captain, said, \"Your pardon, gracious lady, but the\nKing of Estorya has done no such thing. The Estoryan law demands that\nall suspected demons should be kept in prison for two years. Everybody\nknows that a devil can't keep his human disguise more than two years.\nAt the end of that time he reverts to his natural flesh and form, a\nhideous sight to behold, blasphemous, repulsive, soul-shaking.\"\n\nMiran rolled his one good eye so that only the white showed and made\nthe sign to ward off evil, the index finger held rigidly out from a\nclenched fist. Jugkaxtr, the household priest, dived under the table,\nwhere he crouched praying, secure in the knowledge that demons couldn't\ntouch him while he knelt beneath the thrice-blessed wood. The Duke\nswallowed a whole glass of wine, apparently to calm his nerves, and\nbelched.\n\nMiran wiped his face and said, \"Of course, I wasn't able to find\nout much, because we merchants are regarded with deep suspicion and\nscarcely dare to move outside the harbor or the marketplace. The\nEstoryans worship a female deity--ridiculous, isn't it?--and eat fish.\nThey hate us Tropatians because we worship Zaxropatr, Male of Males,\nand because they must depend on us to bring them fish. But they aren't\nclose-mouthed. They babble on and on to us, especially when one has\ngiven them wine for nothing.\"\n\nGreen finally released his breath in a sigh of relief. How glad he\nwas that he had never told these people his true origin! So far as\nthey knew he was merely one of the many slaves who came from a distant\ncountry in the North.\n\nMiran cleared his throat, adjusted his violet turban and yellow robes,\npulled gently at the large gold ring that hung from his nose and said,\n\"It took me a month to get back from Estorya, and that is very good\ntime indeed, but then I am noted for my good luck, though I prefer to\ncall it skill plus the favor given by the gods to the truly devout.\nI do not boast, O gods, but merely give you tribute because you have\nsmiled upon my ventures and have found pleasing the scent of my many\nsacrifices in your nostrils!\"\n\nGreen lowered his eyelids to conceal the expression of disgust which he\nfelt must be shining from them. At the same time, he saw Zuni's shoe\ntapping impatiently. Inwardly he groaned, because he knew she would\ndivert the conversation to something more interesting to her, to her\nclothes and the state of her stomach and/or complexion. And there would\nbe nothing that anybody could do about it, because the custom was that\nthe woman of the house regulated the subject of talk during breakfast.\nIf only this had been lunch or dinner! Then the men would theoretically\nhave had uncontested control.\n\n\"These two demons were very tall, like your slave Green, here,\" said\nMiran, \"and they could not speak a word of Estoryan. Or at least they\nclaimed they couldn't. When King Raussmig's soldiers tried to capture\nthem they brought from the folds of their strange clothes two pistols\nthat only had to be pointed to send silent and awesome and sure death.\nEverywhere men dropped dead. Panic overtook many, but there were brave\nsoldiers who kept on charging, and eventually the magical instruments\nbecame exhausted. The demons were overpowered and put into the Tower\nof Grass Cats from which no man or demon has yet escaped. And there\nthey will be until the Festival of the Sun's Eye. Then they will be\nburnt....\"\n\nFrom beneath the table rose the babble of the priest, Jugkaxtr,\nas he blessed everyone in the house, down to the latest-born pup,\nand the fleas living thereoff, and cursed all those who were\npossessed by even the tiniest demon. The Duke, growing impatient at\nthe noise, kicked under the table. Jugkaxtr yelped and presently\ncrawled out. He sat down and began gnawing the meat from a bone,\na well-done-thou-good-and-faithful-servant expression on his fat\nfeatures. Green also felt like kicking him, just as he often felt\nlike kicking every single human being on this planet. It was hard to\nremember that he must exercise compassion and understanding for them,\nand that his own remote ancestors had once been just as nauseatingly\nsuperstitious, cruel and bloody.\n\nThere was a big difference between reading about such people and\nactually living among them. A history or a romantic novel could\ndescribe how unwashed and diseased and formula-bound primitives were,\nbut only the too-too substantial stench and filth could make your gorge\nrise.\n\nEven as he stood there Zuni's powerful perfume rose and clung in heavy\nfestoons about him and slithered down his nostrils. It was a rare and\nexpensive perfume, brought back by Miran from his voyages and given to\nher as a token of the merchant's esteem. Used in small quantities it\nwould have been quite effective to express feminine daintiness and to\nhint at delicate passion. But no, Zuni poured it like water over her,\nhoping to cover up the stale odor left by _not_ taking a bath more than\nonce a month.\n\nShe looked so beautiful, he thought. And stank so terribly. At least\nshe had at first. Now she looked less beautiful because he knew how\nstupid she was, and didn't stink quite so badly because his nostrils\nhad become somewhat adjusted. They'd had to.\n\n\"I intend to be back in Estorya by the time of the festival,\" said\nMiran. \"I've never seen the Eye of the Sun burn demons before. It's a\ngiant lens, you know. There will be just time enough to make a voyage\nthere and get back before the rainy season. I expect to make even\ngreater profits than the last time, because I've established some\nhighly placed contacts. O gods, I do not boast but merely praise your\nfavor to your humble worshiper, Miran the Merchant of the Clan of\nEffenycan!\"\n\n\"Please bring me some more of this perfume,\" said the Duchess, \"and I\njust love the diamond necklace you gave me.\"\n\n\"Diamonds, emeralds, rubies!\" cried Miran, kissing his hand and rolling\nhis eye ecstatically. \"I tell you, the Estoryans are rich beyond our\ndreams! Jewels flow in their marketplaces like drops of water in a\ncataract! Ah, if only the Emperor could be induced to organize a great\nraiding fleet and storm its walls!\"\n\n\"He remembers too well what happened to his father's fleet when he\ntried it,\" growled the Duke. \"The storm that destroyed his thirty ships\nwas undoubtedly raised by the priests of the Goddess Hooda. I still\nthink that the expedition would have succeeded, however, if the late\nEmperor had not ignored the vision that came to him the night before\nthey set sail. It was the great god Axoputqui, and he said....\"\n\nThere was a lengthy conversation which did not hold Green's attention.\nHe was too busy trying to think of a plan whereby he could get\nto Estorya and to the demons' iron vessel, which was obviously a\nspaceship. This was his only chance. Soon the rainy season would start\nand there would be no vessels leaving for at least three months.\n\nHe could, of course, just walk away and hope to get to Estorya on foot.\nThousands of miles through countless perils, and he had only a general\nidea of where the city was ... no, Miran was his only hope.\n\nBut how...? He didn't think that stowing away would work. There was\nalways a careful search for slaves who might try just that very plan.\nHe looked at Miran, the short, fat, big-stomached, hook-nosed, one-eyed\nfellow with many chins and a large gold ring in his nose. The fellow\nwas shrewd, shrewd, and he would not want to offend the Duchess by\nhelping her official gigolo escape. Not, that is, unless Green could\noffer him something that was so valuable that he couldn't afford not to\ntake the risk. Miran boasted that he was a hard-headed businessman, but\nit was Green's observation that there was always a large soft spot in\nthat supposedly impenetrable cranium: the Fissure of Cupiditas.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nThe Duke rose, and everybody followed his example. Jugkaxtr chanted the\nformula of dismissal, then sat down to finish gnawing on the bone. The\nothers filed out. Green walked in front of Zuni in order to warn her\nof any obstacles in her path and to take the brunt of any attempted\nassassination. As he did so he was seized by the ankle and tripped\nheadlong. He did not fall hard because he was a quick man, in spite\nof his six-foot-two and hundred ninety pounds. But he rose red-faced\nbecause of the loud laughter and from repressed anger at Alzo, who had\nagain repeated his trick of grabbing Green's leg and upsetting him.\nHe wanted to grab a spear from a nearby guard and spit Alzo. But that\nwould be the end of Green. And whereas up to now there had been many\ntimes when he would not particularly have cared if he left this planet\nvia the death route, he could not now make a false move. Not when\nescape was so near!\n\nSo he grinned sheepishly and again preceded the Duchess, while the\nothers followed her out. When they reached the bottom of the broad\nstone staircase that led to the upper floors of the castle, Zuni told\nGreen that he was to go to the marketplace and buy tomorrow's food. As\nfor her, she was going back to bed and sleep until noon.\n\nInwardly Green groaned. How long could he keep up this pace? He was\nexpected to stay up half the night with her, then attend to his\nofficial duties during the day. She slept enough to be refreshed by\nthe time he visited her, but he never had a chance for any real rest.\nEven when he had his free hours in the afternoon he had to go to his\nhouse in the pens, and there he had to stay awake and attend to all\nhis familial duties. And Amra, his slave-wife, and her six children\ndemanded much from him. They were even more tyrannical than the\nDuchess, if that were possible.\n\nHow long, O Lord, how long? The situation was intolerable; even if he'd\nnot heard of the spaceship he would have plotted to escape. Better a\nquick death while trying to get away than a slow, torturous one by\nexhaustion.\n\nHe bowed good-by to the Duke and Duchess, then followed the violet\nturban and yellow robes of Miran through the courtyard, through the\nthick stone walls, over the bridge of the broad moat, and into the\nnarrow winding streets of the city of Quotz. Here the merchant-captain\ngot into his silver-and-jewel-decorated rickshaw. The two long-legged\nmen between its shafts, sailors and clansmen from Miran's vessel, the\n_Bird of Fortune_, began running through the crowd. The people made way\nfor them, as two other sailors preceded them calling out Miran's name\nand cracking whips in the air.\n\nGreen, after looking to make certain that nobody from the castle was\naround to see him, ran until he was even with the rickshaw. Miran\nhalted it and asked what he wanted.\n\n\"Your pardon, Your Richness, but may a humble slave speak and not be\nreprimanded?\"\n\n\"I presume it is no idle thought you have in mind,\" said Miran, looking\nGreen over his one eye narrow in its fat-folds.\n\n\"It has to do with money.\"\n\n\"Ah, despite your foreign accent you speak with a pleasing voice; you\nare the golden trumpet of Mennirox, my patron god. Speak!\"\n\n\"First Your Richness must swear by Mennirox that you will under no\ncircumstances divulge my proposal.\"\n\n\"There is wealth in this? For me?\"\n\n\"There is.\"\n\nMiran glanced at his clansmen, standing there patiently, apparently\noblivious of what was going on. He had power of life and death over\nthem, but he didn't trust them. He said, \"Perhaps it would be better if\nI thought about this before making such a drastic oath. Could you meet\nme tonight at the Hour of the Wineglass at the House of Equality? And\ncould you perhaps give me a slight hint of what you have in mind?\"\n\n\"The answer to both is yes. My proposal has to do with the dried fish\nthat you carry as cargo to the Estoryans. There is another thing, too,\nbut I may not even hint at it until I have your oath.\"\n\n\"Very well then. At the agreed hour. Fish, eh? I must be off. Time is\nmoney, you know. Get going boys, full sails.\"\n\nGreen hailed a passing rickshaw and seated himself comfortably in it.\nAs assistant majordomo he had plenty of money. Moreover, the Duke and\nDuchess would have been outraged if he had lowered their prestige by\nwalking through the city's streets. His vehicle made good time, too,\nbecause everybody recognized his livery: the scarlet and white tricorn\nhat and the white sleeveless shirt with the Duke's heraldic arms on its\nchest--red and green concentric circles pierced by a black arrow.\n\nThe street led always downward, for the city had been built on the\nfoothills of the mountains. It wandered here and there and gave Green\nplenty of time to think.\n\nThe trouble was, he thought, that if the two imprisoned men at Estorya\nwere to die before he got to them he'd still be lost. He had no idea\nof how to pilot or navigate a spaceship. He'd been a passenger on a\nfreighter when it had unaccountably blown up, and he'd been forced to\nleave the dying vessel in one of those automatic castaway emergency\nshells. The capsule had got him down to the surface of this planet and\nwas, as far as he knew, still up in the hills where he'd left it. After\nwandering for a week and almost starving to death he'd been picked up\nby some peasants. They had turned him in to the soldiers of a nearby\ngarrison, thinking he must be a runaway slave on whom they'd collect\na reward. Taken to the capital city of Quotz, Green had almost been\nfreed because there was no record of his being anybody's property. But\nhis tallness, blondness and inability to speak the local language had\nconvinced his captors that he must have wandered down from some far\nnorthern country. Therefore if he wasn't a slave he should be.\n\nPresto, changeo! He was. And he'd put in six months in a quarry and a\nyear as a dock worker. Then the Duchess had chanced to see him on the\nstreets as she rode by, and he'd been transferred to the castle.\n\nThe streets were alive with the short, dark, stocky natives and the\ntaller, lighter-complexioned slaves. The former wore their turbans of\nvarious colors, indicating their status and trade. The latter wore\ntheir three-cornered hats. Occasionally a priest in his high conical\nhat, hexagonal spectacles and goatee rode by. Wagons and rickshaws\ndrawn by men or by big, powerful dogs went by. Merchants stood at the\nfronts of their shops and hawked their wares in loud voices. They sold\ncloth, grixtr nut, parchment, knives, swords, helmets, drugs, books--on\nmagic, on religion, on travel--spices, perfumes, ink, rugs, highly\nsugared drinks, wine, beer, tonic, paintings, everything that went to\nmake up their civilization. Butchers stood before open shops where\ndressed fowl, deer and dogs hung. Dealers in birds pointed out the\nvirtues of their many-colored and multi-songed pets.\n\nFor the thousandth time Green wondered at this strange planet where\nthe only large animals were men, dogs, grass cats, a small deer and\na very small equine. In fact, there was a paucity of any variety of\nanimal life, except for the surprisingly large number of birds. It was\nthis scarcity of horses and oxen, he supposed, that helped perpetuate\nslavery. Man and dog had to provide most of the labor.\n\nNo doubt there was an explanation for all this, but it must be buried\nso deep in this people's forgotten history that one would never know.\nGreen, always curious, wished that he had time and means to explore.\nBut he didn't. He might as well resign himself to keeping a whole skin\nand to getting out of this mess as fast as he could.\n\nThere was enough to do merely to make his way through the narrow and\ncrowded streets. He had to display his baton often to clear a path,\nthough when he approached the harbor area he had less trouble because\nthe streets were much wider.\n\nHere great wagons drawn by gangs of slaves carried huge loads to or\nfrom the ships. The thoroughfares had to be broad, else the people\nwould have been crushed between wagon and house. Here also were the\nso-called Pens, where the dock-slaves lived. Once the area had actually\nbeen an enclosure where men and women were locked up for the night. But\nthe walls had been torn down and new houses built in the old Duke's\ntime. The closest Earthly parallel Green could think of for these\nedifices was a housing project. Small cottages, all exactly alike, set\nin military columns.\n\nFor a moment he considered stopping off to see Amra, then decided\nagainst it. She'd get him tied up in an argument or something, and\nhe'd spend too much time trying to soothe her, time that should be\nspent at the marketplace. He hated scenes, whereas Amra was a born\nself-dramatist who reveled in them, almost wallowed, one might say.\n\nHe averted his eyes from the Pens and looked at the other side of\nthe street, where the walls of the great warehouses towered. Workmen\nswarmed around them, and cranes, operated by gangs pushing wheels like\na ship's capstan, raised or lowered big bundles. Here, he thought, was\na business opportunity for him.\n\nIntroduce the steam engine. It'd be the greatest thing that ever hit\nthis planet. Wood-burning automobiles could replace the rickshaws.\nCranes could be run by donkey-engines. The ships themselves could have\ntheir wheels powered by steam. Or perhaps, he thought, rails could be\nlaid across the Xurdimur, and locomotives would make the ships obsolete.\n\nNo, that wouldn't work. Iron rails cost too much. And the savages that\nroved over the grassy plains would tear them up and forge weapons from\nthem.\n\nBesides, every time he suggested to the Duke a new and much more\nefficient method of doing something he ran dead into the brick wall of\ntradition and custom. Nothing new could be accepted unless the gods\naccepted it. The gods' will was interpreted by the priests. The priests\nclutched the status quo as tightly as a hungry infant clutches its\nmother's breast or an old man clings to his property.\n\nGreen could make a fight against the theocracy, but he didn't feel it\nwas worth while to become a martyr.\n\nHe heard a familiar voice behind him calling his name.\n\n\"Alan! Alan!\"\n\nHe hunched his shoulders like a turtle withdrawing his head and thought\ndesperately for a moment of trying to ignore the voice. But, though a\nwoman's, it was powerful and penetrating, and everybody around him had\nalready turned to see its owner. So he couldn't pretend he hadn't heard\nit.\n\n\"ALAN, YOU BIG BLOND NO-GOOD HUNK OF MAN, STOP!\"\n\nReluctantly Green told his rickshaw boy to turn around. The boy,\ngrinning, did so. Like everybody else along the harbor front he knew\nAmra and was familiar with her relations with Green. She held their\none-year-old daughter in her arms, cradled against her magnificent\nbosom. Behind her stood her other five children, her two sons by the\nDuke, her daughter by a visiting prince, her son by the captain of a\nNortherner ship, her daughter by a temple sculptor. Her rise and fall\nand slow rise again was told in the children around her; the tableau\nembodied an outline of the structure of the planet's society.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nHer mother had been a Northerner slave; her father, a native freeman,\na wheelwright. When she was five years old they had died in a plague.\nShe had been transferred to the Pens and raised by her aunt. When she\nwas fifteen her beauty had attracted the Duke and he had installed\nher in the palace. There she gave birth to his two sons, now ten and\neleven, who would soon be taken away from her and raised in the Duke's\nhousehold as free and petted servants.\n\nThe Duke had married the present Duchess several years after his\nliaison with Amra began and her jealousy had forced him to get rid of\nAmra. Back to the Pens she had gone; perhaps the Duke had not been\ntoo sad to see her go, for living with her was like living with a\nhurricane, and he liked peace and quiet too well.\n\nThen, in accordance with the custom, she had been recommended by the\nDuke to a visiting prince; the prince had overstayed his leave from\nhis native country because he hated to part with her, and the Duke had\nwanted to give her as a present. But here he'd overstepped his legal\nauthority. Slaves had certain rights. A woman who had borne a citizen a\nchild could not be shipped away or sold unless she gave her permission.\nAmra didn't choose to go, so the sorrowing prince had gone home, though\nnot without leaving a memento of his visit behind him.\n\nThe captain of a ship had purchased her, but here again the law came\nto her rescue. He could not take her out of the country, and she again\nrefused to leave. By now she had purchased several businesses--slaves\nwere allowed to hold property and even have slaves of their own--and\nshe knew that her two boys by the Duke would be valuable later on, when\nthey'd go to live with him.\n\nThe temple sculptor had used her as his model for his great marble\nstatue of the goddess of Fertility. Well he might, for she was a\nmagnificent creature, a tall woman with long, richly auburn hair, a\nflawless skin, large russet brown eyes, a mouth as red and ripe as a\nplum, breasts with which neither child nor lover could find fault, a\nwaist amazingly slender considering the rest of her curved body and her\nfruitfulness. Her long legs would have looked good on an Earthwoman and\nwere even more outstanding among a population of club-ankled females.\n\nThere was more to her than beauty. She radiated a something that struck\nevery male at first sight; to Green she sometimes seemed to be a\nviolent physical event, perhaps even a principle of Nature herself.\n\nThere were times when Green felt proud because she had picked him as\nher mate, chosen him when he was a newly imported slave who could say\nonly a few words in the highly irregular agglutinative tongue. But\nthere were times when he felt that she was too much for him, and those\ntimes had been getting too frequent lately. Besides, he felt a pang\nwhenever he saw their child, because he loved it and dreaded the moment\nwhen he would have to leave it. As for deserting Amra, he wasn't sure\nhow that would make him feel. Undeniably, she did affect him, but then\nso did a blow in the teeth or wine in the blood.\n\nHe got down out of the rickshaw, told the boy to wait, said, \"Hello,\nhoney,\" and kissed her. He was glad she was a slave, because she didn't\nwear a nose-ring. When he kissed the Duchess he was always annoyed\nby hers. She refused to take it off when with him because that would\nput her on his level, and he mustn't ever forget he was a slave. It\nwas perfectly moral for her to take a bondsman as a lover but not a\nfreeman, and she was nothing if not moral.\n\nAmra's return kiss was passionate, part of which was the vigor of\nasperity. \"You're not fooling me,\" she said. \"You meant to ride right\nby. Kiss the children! What's the matter, are you getting tired of me?\nYou told me you only accepted the Duchess's offer because it meant\nadvancement, and you were afraid that if you turned her down she'd\nfind an excuse to kill you. Well, I believed you--half-believed you,\nanyway. But I won't if you try sneaking by without seeing me. What's\nthe matter? Are you a man or not? Are you afraid to face a woman? Don't\nshake your head. You're a liar! Don't forget to kiss Grizquetr; you\nknow he's an affectionate boy and worships you, and it's absurd to\nsay that in your country grown men don't kiss boys that old. You're\nnot in your country--what a strange, frigid, loveless race must live\nthere--and even if you were you might overlook their customs to show\nsome tenderness to the boy. Come on back to our house and I'll bring up\nsome of that wonderful Chalousma wine that came in the other day out of\nthe cellar----\"\n\n\"What was a ship doing in your cellar?\" he said, and he whooped with\nlaughter. \"By all the gods, Amra, I know it's been two days since I've\nseen you, but don't try to crowd forty-eight hours' conversation into\nten minutes, especially your kind of conversation. And quit scolding me\nin front of the children. You know it's bad for them. They might pick\nup your attitude of contempt for the head of the house.\"\n\n\"I? Contempt? Why, I worship the ground you walk on! I tell them\ncontinually what a fine man you are, though it's rather hard to\nconvince them when you do show up and they see the truth. Still....\"\n\nThere was only one way to handle her; that was to outtalk, outshout,\noutact her. It was hard going, especially when he felt so tired, and\nwhen she would not cooperate with him but would fight for precedence.\nThe trouble was, she didn't feel any respect for the man she could shut\nup, so it was absolutely necessary to dominate her.\n\nThis he accomplished by giving her a big squeeze, causing the baby to\ncry because she was pushed in too tightly between the two of them. Then\nwhile Amra was trying to soothe the baby he began telling her what had\nhappened at the palace.\n\nShe was silent, except for a sharply pointed question interjected now\nand then, and she insisted upon hearing the details of everything that\nhad taken place--everything. He told her things that he would not have\nmentioned before children--two years ago. But the extremely frank and\nuninhibited society of the slaves had freed him of any such restraints.\n\nThey went inside Amra's house, through her offices, where six of her\nclerks and secretaries worked, through the living rooms proper, and on\ninto the kitchen.\n\nShe rang a bell and told Inzax, a pretty little blonde, to go into the\ncellar and bring up a quart of Chalousma. One of the clerks popped\nhis head in the kitchen door and told her that a Mr. Sheshyarvrenti,\npurser of an Andoonanarga vessel, wanted to see her about the\ndisposition of some rare birds that she had ordered seven months\nbefore. He would deal with no one but her.\n\n\"Let him cool his heels for a while,\" she said. The clerk gulped and\nhis head disappeared.\n\nGreen took Paxi, his daughter, and played with her while Amra poured\ntheir wine.\n\n\"This can go on only so long,\" she said. \"I love you, and I'm not\ngetting the attention I'm accustomed to. You should find some pretense\nto break off with the Duchess. I'm a vigorous woman who needs a lot of\nlove. I want you here.\"\n\nGreen had nothing to lose by agreeing with her, since he planned to be\nleaving in a very short time. \"You're right,\" he said. \"I'll tell her\nas soon as I think up a good excuse.\" He fingered his neck at the place\nwhere a headsman's ax would come down. \"It had better be a good one,\nthough.\"\n\nAmra seemed to glow all over with happiness. She held her glass up and\nsaid, \"Here's to the Duchess. May demons carry her off.\"\n\n\"You'd better be careful, saying that before the children. You know\nthat if they innocently repeated that to someone and it got back to the\nDuchess you'd be burned in the next witchhunt.\"\n\n\"Not my children!\" she scoffed. \"They're too clever. They take after\ntheir mother. They know when to keep their mouths shut.\"\n\nGreen gulped his wine and stood up. \"I must go.\"\n\n\"You'll come home tonight? Surely the Duchess will let you out one\nnight a week?\"\n\n\"Not one single night. And I can't come here this evening because I'm\nto meet Miran the Merchant at the House of Equality. Business, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know! You'll dillydally about the whole matter, and put off\nacting for one reason or another, and the first thing you know, years\nwill go by, and----\"\n\n\"If this keeps up I'll be dead in six months,\" he said. \"I'm _tired_! I\nhave to get some sleep.\"\n\nShe changed instantly from anger to sympathy. \"Poor dear, why don't you\nforget that appointment and sleep here until it's time to go back to\nthe castle? I'll send a messenger to Miran telling him you're sick.\"\n\n\"No, this is something I just can't pass by.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"It's of such a nature that telling you, or anybody, would spoil it.\"\n\n\"And just what could that be?\" she demanded, angry again. \"It concerns\nsome woman, I'll bet!\"\n\n\"My problem is keeping away from you women, not getting into more\ntrouble. No, it's just that Miran has sworn me by all his gods to keep\nsilent and of course I couldn't think of breaking a vow.\"\n\n\"I know your opinion of our gods,\" she said. \"Well, go along with you!\nBut I warn you, I'm an impatient woman; I'll give you a week to work on\nthe Duchess, then I'm launching an attack myself.\"\n\n\"That won't be necessary,\" he said. He kissed her and the children and\nleft. He congratulated himself on having delayed Amra that long. If he\ncouldn't carry out his scheme in a week he was lost, anyway. He'd have\nto walk away from the city and out onto the Xurdimur, even if packs of\nwild dogs and man-eating grass cats and cannibalistic men and God knew\nwhat else did roam the grassy plains.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nEvery city and village of the Empire had its House of Equality, within\nwhose walls distinctions of every type were abandoned. Green did not\nknow the origin of the institution, but he recognized its value as\na safety valve to blow off the extreme social pressure put on every\nclass. Here the slave who did not dare open his mouth in the outside\nmundane world could curse his master to his face and go unpunished by\nthe authorities. Of course, there was nothing to keep the master from\nretaliating in kind, for the slave also cast off his legal rights when\nhe entered. Violence was not unknown here, though it was infrequent.\nBlood shed within these walls did not, theoretically, call for\npunishment. But any murderer would find that, though the police paid\nno attention to him, he'd have to deal with the slain one's relatives.\nMany feuds had had their origin and end here.\n\nGreen had excused himself after the evening meal, saying that he had to\ntalk to Miran about getting some spices from Estorya. Also the merchant\nhad mentioned that on his last trip he'd heard that a band of Estoryan\nhunters were going after the rare and beautiful _getzlen_ bird and that\nhe might find some for sale when he returned there. Zuni's face lit up,\nbecause she desired a _getzlen_ bird even more than a chance to annoy\nher husband. Graciously she gave Green permission to leave.\n\nInwardly exultant, though outwardly pulling a long face that was\nsupposed to suggest his sadness at having to leave the Duchess, he\nbacked out of the dining room. Not very gracefully, for Alzo chose that\nmoment to refuse to get out of Green's path. Green tumbled backward,\nsprawling over the huge mastiff, who snarled with anger and trembled\nwith hypocritical indignation and bared his fangs with the intention\nof tearing Green apart. The Earthman did not try to rise, because he\ndid not want to give Alzo an excuse for jumping him. Instead he bared\nhis own teeth and snarled back. The hall roared with laughter and the\nDuke, holding his sides, tears running from his bulging eyes, rose\nand staggered over to where the two faced each other on all fours. He\nclutched Alzo's spike-studded collar and dragged him away, meanwhile\nchoking out a command to Green to take off while the taking off was\ngood.\n\nGreen swallowed his anger, thanked the Duke and left. Swearing that\nhe'd rip the hound apart some day with his bare hands, the Earthman\nleft for the House of Equality. It took all the long rickshaw ride to\nthe temple for him to calm down.\n\nThe great central room with its three-story ceiling was full that\nnight. Men in their long evening kilts and women in masks crowded\naround the gambling tables, the bars and the grudge-stages. There\nwas a large crowd around the platform on which two dealers in wheat\nwere slugging it out to work off resentment arising from business\ndisputes. But by far the greatest number had gathered to watch a\nhusband-and-wife match. His left hand had been tied to his side, and\nshe had been armed with a club. Thus equalized, they'd been given the\nword to go to it. So far the man had had the worst of the match, as\nbloody patches on his head and bruises on his arm showed. If he could\nget the club away from her he had the right to do what he wanted to\nher. But if she could break his free arm she had him at her complete\nmercy.\n\nGreen avoided the stage, because such barbarous doings made him sick.\nLooking for Miran, he finally found him rolling a pair of six-sided\ndice with another captain. This fellow wore the red turban and black\nrobes of the Clan Axucan. He had just lost to Miran and was paying him\nsixty _iquogr_, a goodly sum even for a merchant-prince.\n\nMiran took Green's arm, something he'd never have done outside the\nHouse, and led him off to a curtained booth where they could get as\nmuch privacy as they wished. He matched Green for drinks; Green lost,\nand Miran ordered a large pitcher of Chalousma.\n\n\"Nothing but the best for yours truly--whenever someone else is\npaying,\" Miran said jovially. \"Now, I'm a great one for fun, but I'm\nhere primarily for business. So--let's have your proposal at once, if\nyou please.\"\n\n\"First I must have your solemn oath that you will tell absolutely no\none what you hear in this booth. Second, that if you reject my idea\nyou do not then use it later on. Third, that if you do accept you will\nnever attempt later on to kill me or get rid of me and thus reap the\nprofits.\"\n\nMiran's face had been blank, but at the word \"profits\" it twisted into\nmany folds and creases, all expressive of joy.\n\nHe reached into the huge purse he carried slung over his shoulder\nand pulled out a little golden idol of the patron deity of the Clan\nEffenycan. Putting his right hand upon its ugly head, he lifted his\nleft and said, \"I swear by Zaceffucanquanr that I will obey your wishes\nin this matter. May he strike me with lice, leprosy, lecher's disease\nand lightning if I should break this, my solemn vow.\"\n\nSatisfied, Green said, \"First I want you to arrange for me to be aboard\nyour windroller when you leave for Estorya.\"\n\nMiran choked on his wine and coughed and sputtered until Green pounded\nhis back.\n\n\"I do not ask that you give me passage _back_. Now, here's my idea. You\nplan to be taking a large cargo of dried fish because the Estoryans'\nreligion requires that they eat them at every meal and because they use\nthem in great quantities at their numerous festivals.\"\n\n\"True, true. Do you know, I've never been able to figure out why they\nshould worship a fish-goddess. They live over five thousand miles from\nthe sea, and there's no evidence that any of them have ever been to the\nsea. Yet, they demand saltwater fish, won't use the fish from a nearby\nlake.\"\n\n\"There're many mysteries about the Xurdimur. However, they needn't\nconcern us. Now, do you know that the Estoryans' Book of Gods places\nmuch more ritual-power in freshly killed and cooked fish than in smoked\nfish? However, they've always had to be content with the dried fish\nthe windrollers brought them. What price would they not pay for living\nsea-fish?\"\n\nMiran rubbed his palms together. \"Indeed it does make one wonder...?\"\n\nGreen then outlined his idea. Miran sat stunned. Not at the audacity or\noriginality of the plan, but because it was so obvious that he wondered\nwhy neither he nor anyone else had ever thought of it. He said so.\n\nGreen drank his wine and said, \"I suppose that people wondered the same\nwhen the first wheel or bow and arrow were invented. So obvious, yet no\none thought of them until then.\"\n\n\"Let me get this straight,\" said Miran. \"You want me to buy a caravan\nof wagons, build water-tight tanks into them and use them to transport\nocean fish back to here? Then the wagon bodies, with their contents,\nwill be lifted onto my windroller and fitted into specially prepared\nracks--or perhaps, holes--on the middeck? Also, you will show me how to\nanalyze sea water so that its formula may be sold to the Estoryans, and\nthey can thus keep the fish alive in their own tanks?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Hmmm.\" Miran ran his fat, ring-studded finger over his hook nose and\nthe square gold ornament hanging therefrom. His single eye glared\npale-bluely at Green. The other was covered with a white patch to hide\nthe emptiness left after a ball from a Ving musket had struck it.\n\n\"It's four weeks until the very last day on which I can set sail from\nhere and still get to Estorya and back before the rains come. It's just\nbarely possible to have the tanks built, get them convoyed down to\nthe seashore, get the fish in and bring them back. Meantime, I can be\nhaving the deck altered. If my men work day and night we can make it.\"\n\n\"Of course, this is a one-shot proposition. You can't possibly keep a\nmonopoly on the idea, once the first trip is over. Too many people are\nbound to talk, and the other captains will hear of it.\"\n\n\"I know; don't teach an Effenycan to suck eggs. But what if the fish\nshould die?\"\n\nGreen shrugged and spread out his palms. \"A possibility. You're taking\na tremendous gamble. But every voyage on the Xurdimur is, isn't it? How\nmany windrollers come back? Or how many can boast your list of forty\nsuccessful trips?\"\n\n\"Not many,\" said Miran.\n\nHe slumped in his seat, brooding over his goblet of wine. His eye, sunk\nin ranges of fat, seemed to stare through Green. The Earthman pretended\nindifference, though his heart was pounding, and he controlled his\nbreathing with difficulty.\n\n\"You're asking a great deal,\" Miran finally said. \"If the Duke were to\nfind out that I'd agreed to help a valued slave escape, I'd be tortured\nin a _most_ refined way, and the Clan Effenycan would be stripped of\nall its rights to sail windrollers and would probably be exiled to\nits native hills. Or else would have to take to piracy. And that,\ndespite all the glamorous stories you hear, is not a very well-paying\nprofession.\"\n\n\"You'd make a killing in Estorya.\"\n\n\"True, but when I think of what the Duchess will do when she discovers\nyou've fled the country! Ow, ow, ow!\"\n\n\"There's no reason why you should be connected with my disappearance. A\ndozen craft leave the harbor every day. Besides, for all she'll know,\nI've gone the opposite way, over the hills and to the ocean. Or to the\nhills themselves, where many runaway slaves are.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I have to return to Tropat. And my clansmen, though\nnotoriously tight-lipped when sober, are also, I must confess,\nnotorious drunkards. Someone'd be sure to babble in the taverns.\"\n\n\"I'll dye my hair black, cut it short, like a Tzatlam tribesman, and\nsign on.\"\n\n\"You forget that you have to belong to my clan in order to be a crew\nmember.\"\n\n\"Hmmm. Well, what about this adoption-by-blood routine?\"\n\n\"What about it? I can't propose that unless you've done something\nspectacular and for the profit of the clan. Wait! Can you play any\nmusical instrument?\"\n\nPromptly, Green lied. \"Oh, I am a wonderful harpist. When I play I can\nsoothe a hungry grass cat into lying down at my feet and licking my\ntoes with pure affection.\"\n\n\"Excellent! Though it would not be an affection so pure, since it is\nwell known that the grass cat considers a man's toes a great delicacy\nand always eats them first, even before the eyes. Listen well. Here is\nwhat you must do in four weeks' time, for if all goes well, or all goes\nill, we set sail on the Week of the Oak, the Day of the Sky, the Hour\nof the Lark, a most propitious time....\"\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nTo Green, the next three weeks seemed to have shifted to low gear,\nthey crept by so slowly. Yet they should have raced by quickly enough,\nso full of schemes and plots were they. He had to advise Miran on the\nmany technical details involved in building tanks for the fish. He\nhad to keep the Duchess happy, an increasingly difficult job because\nit was impossible to pretend a one-hundred-per-cent absorption in her\nwhile his mind desperately looked for flaws in his plans, found oh, so\nmany, and then as anxiously sought ways of repairing them. Nevertheless\nhe knew it was vital that he not displease or bore her. Prison would\nforever ruin his chances.\n\nWorst of all, Amra was getting suspicious.\n\n\"You're trying to conceal something from me,\" she told Green. \"You\nought to know better. I can tell when a man is deceiving me. There's\nsomething about the voice, the eyes, the way he makes love, though\nyou've been doing very little of that. What are you plotting?\"\n\n\"I assure you it's simply that I'm very tired,\" he said sharply. \"All\nI want is some peace and quiet, a little rest and a little privacy now\nand then.\"\n\n\"Don't try to tell me that's all!\"\n\nShe cocked her head to one side and squinted at him, managing somehow\neven in this grotesque attitude to look ravishingly beautiful.\n\nSuddenly she said, \"You wouldn't be thinking of running away, would\nyou?\"\n\nFor a second he became pale. Damn the woman anyway!\n\n\"Don't be ridiculous,\" he said, trying hard to keep his voice from\ncracking. \"I'm too much aware of the penalties if I were caught.\nBesides, why should I want to run away? You are the most desirable\nwoman I've ever known. (This was the truth.) Though you're not the\neasiest one in the world to live with. (A master understatement.) I\nwould have gotten no place without you. (True; but he couldn't spend\nthe rest of his life on this barbarous world.) And it is unthinkable\nthat I would want to leave you.\" (Inexpressible, yes, but not\nunthinkable. He couldn't take her with him, for the simple reason that\neven if she would go she would never fit in his life on Earth. She'd be\nabsolutely unhappy. Moreover, she'd not go anyway, because she'd refuse\nto abandon her children and would try to take them along, thus wrecking\nall his escape plans. He might just as well hire a brass band and march\nbehind it out of the city and onto the windroller in the light of high\nnoon.)\n\nNevertheless his conscience troubled him. If it was painful to\nleave Amra it was hell to leave Paxi, his daughter. For days he had\nconsidered taking her along with him, but eventually abandoned the\nidea. Trying to steal her from under Amra's fiercely watchful gaze was\nalmost impossible. Moreover, Paxi would miss her mother terribly, and\nhe had no business exposing the baby to the risks of the voyage, which\nwere many. Amra would be doubly hurt. Losing him would be bad enough,\nbut to lose Paxi also...! No, he couldn't do that to her.\n\nThe outcome of this conversation with her was that she apparently\ndropped her suspicions. At least she never spoke of them again. He\nwas glad of that, for it was impossible to keep entirely hidden his\nconnection with the mysterious actions of Miran the Merchant. The\nwhole city knew something was up. There was undoubtedly a lot of money\ntied up with this deal of the wagon caravan going to the seashore.\nBut what did it all mean? Neither Miran nor Green would say a word,\nand while the Duke and Duchess might have used their authority to get\nthe information from their slave, the Duke made no move. Miran had\npromised to let him in on a share of the profits, provided he gave\nthe merchant a free hand and asked no questions. The Duke was quite\ncontent. He planned on spending the money to increase his collection\nof glass birds. He had ten large rooms of the castle glittering with\nhis fantastic aviary: shining, silent and grotesquely beautiful, all\nproducts of the glass-blowers of the fabulous city of Metzva Moosh,\nfar, far away across the grassy sea of the Xurdimur.\n\nGreen was present when the Duke talked to Miran about it.\n\n\"Now, Captain, you must understand just exactly what I do want,\" warned\nthe ruler, lifting a finger to emphasize the seriousness of his words.\nHis eyes, usually deep-sunk in their fat, had widened to reveal large,\nbrown and soulful orbs. The passion for his hobby shone forth. Nothing:\ngood Chalousma wine, his wife, the torture of a heretic or runaway\nslave, could make him quiver and glitter with delight as much as the\nthought of the exquisitely wrought image of a Metzva Moosh bird.\n\n\"I want two or three, but no more because I can't afford more. All made\nby Izan Yushwa, the greatest of the glass-blowers. I'd particularly\nlike any modeled after the bird-of-terror....\"\n\n\"But when I was last in Estorya I heard that Izan Yushwa was dying,\"\nsaid Miran.\n\n\"Excellent, excellent!\" cried the Duke. \"That will make everything\nrecently created by him even more valuable! If he is dead now it is\nprobable that the Estoryans, who control the export of the Mooshans,\nwill be putting a high price on anything of his that comes their way.\nThat means that bidding will be high during the festival and that you\nmust outbid any prospective buyers. By all means do so. Pay any price,\nfor I must have something created by him in his last days!\"\n\nThe Duke, Green realized, was so eager because of the belief that a\npart of a dying artist's soul entered into his latest creations when he\ndied. These were called \"soul-works\" and brought ten times as much as\nanything else, even if the conception and execution were inferior to\nprevious works.\n\nSourly Miran said, \"But you have given me no money to buy your birds.\"\n\n\"Of course not. You will lend me the sum, buy them yourself, and when\nyou come back with them I will raise the money to repay you.\"\n\nMiran didn't seem too happy, but Green knew that the fat merchant was\nalready planning to charge the Duke double the purchase price. As\nfor Green, he liked to see a man interested in a hobby, but he was\ndisgusted because taxes would now be raised in order to allow the Duke\nto add to his collection.\n\nThe Duchess, bored as usual by her husband's conversation, suddenly\nsaid, \"Honey, let's go hunting next weekend. I've been so restless\nlately, so unable to sleep nights. I think I've been cooped up too long\nin this dismal old place. My digestion has been so sluggish lately. I\nthink I need the exercise and the fresh air.\" And she went into vivid\ndetail about certain aspects of her gastrointestinal troubles. The\nEarthman, who'd thought he was hardened to this people's custom of\ndwelling on such matters, turned green.\n\nAt the suggestion of a hunt the Duke didn't exactly groan, but his eyes\nrolled upward in supplication to the gods. Until he had reached the\nage of thirty he had enjoyed a good hunt. But like most upper-class\nmen of his culture, he rapidly put on flesh after thirty and became as\nsedentary as possible. The belief was that fat increased a man's life\nspan. Also, a big belly and double chin were signs of aristocratic\nblood and a full purse. Unfortunately, along with this came an\ninevitable decline in vigor, which, coupled with the December-May\nmarriages that their society expected of them, had given birth to\nanother institution: the slave male companion of the rich man's young\nwife.\n\nIt was toward Green that the Duke looked. \"Why not let him conduct the\nhunt?\" he suggested hopefully. \"I've so much business to take care of.\"\n\n\"Like sitting on your fat cushion and contemplating your glass birds,\"\nshe said. \"No!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he said, resignedly. \"I've a slave in the work-pens who's\nto be executed for striking a foreman. We'll use him as the quarry. But\nI think we ought to give him two weeks to build up his wind and legs.\nOtherwise it would hardly be sporting, you know.\"\n\nThe Duchess frowned. \"No. I'm getting bored; I can't stand this\ninaction any longer.\"\n\nShe shot a glance at Green. He felt his stomach muscles contracting.\nEvidently she'd noticed his lukewarm interest in her. This hunt was\npartly to suggest to him that he'd be meeting a like fate unless he\nperked up and began to be more entertaining.\n\nIt wasn't that thought that made his heart sink. It was that next\nweekend was when Miran's windroller raised sail and when he planned to\nbe aboard it. Now, he'd be gone conducting the hunting party up in the\nhills.\n\nGreen looked appealingly at Miran, but the merchant's shoulders rose\nbeneath the yellow robe as if to say, \"What can I do?\"\n\nHe was right. Miran couldn't suggest that he too go along on the hunt,\nand thus give Green a chance to slip aboard afterward. The day on\nwhich the _Bird of Fortune_ was scheduled to leave the windbreak was\nabsolutely the last date on which it could set sail. He couldn't afford\nto take the chance of being caught in the rains in the middle of the\nvast plains.\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nAll the next day Green was too busy setting up the schedule of the\nhunting party to have time to be gloomy. But when night came he seemed\nto fold up inside himself. Could he pretend to be sick, too, and be\nleft behind when the party set out?\n\nNo, for they would at once assume that he had been possessed by a\ndemon and would pack him off to the Temple of Apoquoz, God of Healing.\nThere he'd be under lock and key until he proved himself healthy. The\nterrible part about going to the Temple of Apoquoz was that it made\ndeath almost inevitable. If you didn't die of your own disease you\ncaught somebody else's.\n\nGreen wasn't worried about catching any of the many diseases he'd be\nexposed to in the Temple. Like all men of terrestrial descent, he\ncarried in his body a surgically implanted protoplasmic entity which\nautomatically analyzed any invading microscopic organisms and/or\nviruses and manufactured antibodies to combat them. It lived in the\nspace created by the removal of his appendix; when working to fulfill\nits mission it demanded food and radiated a heat that assured its host\nof its heartening presence. An increased appetite plus a slight fever\nindicated that it was killing off the disease and that within several\nhours it would successfully repel any boarders. In the two years Green\nhad been on the planet it had had to attack at least forty times; Green\ncalculated that he would have been dead each and every time if it had\nnot been for his symbiote.\n\nKnowing this didn't help him. If he played sick he'd be locked up and\ncouldn't get on the 'roller. If he went on the hunting party he missed\nthe boat, too.\n\nSuppose he were to disappear the night before the party, to hide on the\nwindroller while the castle vainly looked for him?\n\nNot very likely. The first thing that would occur to Zuni would be to\norder the windbreak closed and all 'rollers searched for a possible\nstowaway. And if that happened Miran would be so delayed that it was\nunlikely he'd sail. Even if he, Green, hid in Miran's cabin, where he\nwould probably be safe, there would still be the inevitable and totally\nfrustrating delay.\n\nThen why not disappear several days earlier, so that Miran could have\ntime to reload his cargo? He'd see the merchant tomorrow. If Miran fell\nin with his plans, Green would disappear four nights from this very\nnight, which would leave three days for the windroller to be emptied\nand reloaded. Fortunately the tanks wouldn't have to be taken off,\nbecause any fool could see that the runaway wasn't hiding at the bottom\namong the fish.\n\nMuch relieved that he at least had a way open, if a very perilous one,\nGreen relaxed. He was sitting on a bench along a walk on top of one of\nthe castle walls. The sky was blazingly beautiful with stars larger\nthan any seen from Earth. The great moon and the small moon had risen.\nThe larger had just cleared the eastern horizon and the lesser one\nwas just past the zenith. Mingled moonwash and starwash softened the\ngrimness and ugliness of the city below him and laved it in a flood of\nromance and glamour. Most of Quotz was unlighted, for the streets had\nno lamps and the windows were shut up tight against thieves, vampires\nand demons. Occasionally the torchflares of the servants of a drunken\nnoble or rich man moved down the dark canyons between the towering\noverhanging houses.\n\nBeyond the city was the amphitheater formed by the hills curving out\nto the north and the great brick wall built to continue the natural\nwindbreak. A wide opening had been left so that the 'rollers, their\nsails furled, could be towed in or out. Past this the great plain\nsuddenly began, as if the hand of some immense landscaper had pressed\nthe hills flat and declared that from here on there would be no\nunevennesses.\n\nWestward lay the incredibly level stretch of the grassy ground of the\nXurdimur. Ten thousand miles straight across, flat as a table top,\nbroken only here and there by clumps of forests, ruins of cities,\nwaterholes, the tents of the nomadic savages, herds of wild animals,\npacks of grass cats and dire dogs, and the mysterious and undoubtedly\nimaginary \"roaming islands,\" great clumps of rock and dirt that legend\nsaid slid of their own volition over the plains. How like this planet,\nhe thought, that the greatest peril to navigation should be one that\nexisted only in the heads of the inhabitants.\n\nThe Xurdimur was a fabulous phenomenon, without parallel. On none\nof the many planets that Earthmen had discovered was there anything\nsimilar. How, he wondered, could the plain keep its smoothness, when\nthere was always dirt running on to it from the eroding hills and\nmountains that ringed it? The rains, too, should have done much to\nwear it away unevenly. Of course, the grass that grew all over it was\nlong and had very tough roots. And if what he had been told was true,\nbeneath the vegetation was one mass of inextricably tangled roots that\nheld the soil together.\n\nThere was another thing to consider, though: the winds that blew all\nthe way across the Xurdimur and furnished propulsion for the wheeled\nsailing craft. To have winds you must have pressure differentials,\nwhich were usually caused by heat differentials. Although the Xurdimur\nwas ringed by mountains there were no large eminences on it for ten\nthousand miles, nothing to replenish the currents of air. Or so it\nseemed to his limited knowledge of meteorology, though he did wonder\nhow the trade winds that swept Earth's seas managed to keep going for\nso many thousands of leagues, just on their original impetus. Or did\nthey get boosts? He didn't know.\n\nWhat he did know was that the Xurdimur was a thing that shouldn't\nbe. Yet, the very presence of men here was just as amazing, just\nas preposterous. Homo sapiens was scattered throughout the Galaxy.\nEverywhere that the space-traveling Earthmen had gone, they had\nfound that about every fourth inhabitable planet was populated by\nmen of their species. The proof lay not just in the outward physical\nresemblance of terrestrial and extra-terrestrial; it lay in their\nability to breed. Earthman, Sirian, Albirean, Vegan, it made no\ndifference. Their men could have children by the women of other planets.\n\nNaturally there had been many theories to account for this fact. All\nhad as a common basis the assumption that Homo sapiens had sometime,\nsomewhere, in the very remote past, originated on one planet and then\nhad spread out over the Galaxy from it. And, somehow, space travel had\nbeen lost and each race had gone back to savagery, only to begin again\nthe long hard struggle toward civilization and the re-discovery of\nspaceships. Why, no one knew. One could only guess.\n\nThere was the problem of language. It might seem that if man had come\nfrom a common birthplace he would at least have kept a trace of his\nhome language and that the linguists could break down the development\nof tongue and link one planet to another through it. But no. Every\nworld had its own Tower of Babel, its own ten thousand languages. The\nterrestrial scientist might trace Russian and English and Swedish, and\nLithuanian and Persian and Hindustani back to a proto-Indo-European,\nbut he had never found on any other planet a language which he could\nsay had also derived from the Aryan Ursprache.\n\nGreen's mind wandered to the two Earthmen now imprisoned in the city of\nEstorya. He hoped they weren't being treated badly. They could be in\nhorrible pain at this very moment, if the priests felt like subjecting\nthem to a little demon-testing.\n\nThinking of torture led him to sit up a little straighter and to\nstretch his arms and legs. In an hour he was supposed to meet the\nDuchess. To do that he had to go through the supposedly secret door\nin the wall of the turret at the northern end of the walk, up a\nstairway through a passage between the walls, and so to the Duchess's\napartments. There one of the maids-of-honor would usher him into Zuni's\npresence and then would try to eavesdrop so she could report to the\nDuke later on. Zuni and Green weren't supposed to know about this, but\nwere to pretend that she was their trusted confidante.\n\nWhen the great bell of the Temple of the God of Time, Grooza, struck,\nGreen would rise from his bench and go to what he now thought of as\na wearisome chore. If that woman could only be interested in talking\nof something else besides her complexion or digestion, or idle palace\ngossip, it wouldn't be so bad. But no, she chattered on and on, and\nGreen would get increasingly sleepy, yet would not dare drop off for\nfear of irreparably offending her. And to do that....\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nThe lesser moon had touched the western horizon and the greater was\nnearing the zenith when Green awoke and jumped to his feet, swearing in\nsheer terror. He'd fallen asleep and kept Zuni waiting.\n\n\"My God, what'll she say?\" he said aloud. \"What'll I tell her?\"\n\n\"You needn't tell me anything,\" came her angry retort from very\nclose by. He started, and whirled around and saw that she'd been\nstanding behind him. She was wrapped in a robe, but her pale face\ngleamed from beneath the overhanging hood and her mouth was opened.\nWhite teeth flashed as she began accusing him of not loving her, of\nbeing bored by her, of loving some other woman, probably a slave\ngirl, a good-for-nothing, lazy, brainless, emptily pretty wench. If\nhis situation hadn't been so serious Green would have smiled at her\nself-portrayal.\n\nHe tried to dam the flood, but to no avail. She screeched at him to\nshut up, and when he put his fingers to his lips and said, \"Shhh!\" she\nreplied by raising her voice even more.\n\n\"You know you're not supposed to be out of your rooms after dark\nunless the Duke is along,\" he said, taking her elbow and attempting to\nsteer her down the walk toward the secret door. \"If the guards see you\nthere'll be trouble, bad trouble. Let's go.\"\n\nUnfortunately the guards did see them. Torches appeared at the foot of\nthe steps below the walk, and iron helmets and cuirasses gleamed. Green\ntried to urge her on faster, for there was still time to make it to the\ndoor. She jerked her arm loose and shouted, \"Take your filthy hands off\nme, you Northern slave! The Duchess of Tropat doesn't allow herself to\nbe pushed around by a blond beast!\"\n\n\"Damn it,\" he snarled, and he shoved her. \"You stupid _kizmaiaz_! Get\ngoing! _You_ won't be tortured if they find us together!\"\n\nZuni jerked away. Her face twisted and her mouth worked soundlessly.\n\"_Kizmaiaz!_\" she finally gasped. \"_Kizmaiaz_ yourself!\"\n\nSuddenly she began screaming. Before he could clamp his hand over her\nmouth, she dashed past him and toward the steps. It was then that he\ncame out of his paralysis and ran, not after her, which he knew was\nuseless, but toward the secret door. All was up. It was absolutely no\nuse trying to explain to the guards. The situation had now entered a\nconventional phase. She would tell the guards that he had come into her\nroom, through some unknown means--which would be \"found out\" later--and\nhad dragged her out onto the walk, apparently with the intention of\nviolating her. Why he should pick a public place when he already had\nthe privacy of her rooms would not be asked. And the guards, though\nthey would know what really had happened, would pretend to believe\nher and would furiously seize him and drag him off to the dungeons.\nThe absurd thing about it was that within a few days the whole city,\nincluding Zuni herself, would believe that her story was true. By the\ntime he'd been executed they would hate his guts, and the lot of all\nthe slaves would be miserable for a while because they would share his\nblame.\n\nGreen had no intention of being seized. Flight was an admission of\nguilt, but it made no difference now.\n\nHe ran through the secret door, shut and bolted it and raced up the\nsteps that led to her apartments. The guards would have to take the\nlong way around; he had at least two minutes before they could unlock\nthe two doors of the ante-rooms to her quarters, explain to the guards\njust outside them what had happened and begin a search for him. As for\nhim, he was running like a rabbit, but he was thinking like a fox.\nHaving known that just such a situation might arise, he had long ago\nplanned in detail several possible courses of action. Now, he chose the\nlikeliest one and began acting efficiently--if not smoothly.\n\nThe staircase was a narrow corkscrew with room for only one person\nat a time to go up. He ran up it so fast that he got dizzy with the\never-winding turns. He reeled and had trouble keeping from falling\nto his left when he did arrive at its top. Nevertheless he did not\npause to catch breath or balance but pulled the lever that would make\nthe door swing out. He burst through it. No one there, thank God. He\nstopped for a moment, listened to make sure nobody was in the next\nroom, then pushed on a boss set in a pattern of bronze protuberances,\nwhich was connected with the mechanism that operated the secret door.\nThe section of wall swung back silently until it was flush with the\nrest, and quite indistinguishable. He then twisted the knob so the door\ncouldn't be opened from the other side. Green took time to give fervent\nthanks to the builders of the castle, who had prepared this device for\nthe owners to hide within in case of a successful invasion or revolt.\nIf it had not been there he could not have escaped.\n\nEscaped? He'd only put off his inevitable capture. But he intended to\nrun as long as he could and then fight until they were forced to kill\nhim.\n\nThe first thing to do was to find a weapon. As a matter of fact, he\nwas so familiar with Zuni's rooms that he knew exactly where he could\nget what he wanted. He walked through two large rooms, making his way\neasily even through the feeble duskish light that the few oil lamps\nand candles furnished. Hanging from the wall of the third room was a\nsaber made of the best steel obtainable on this planet and fashioned by\nthe greatest smiths, the swordwrights of faraway and almost legendary\nTalamasko. The blade was a gift from Zuni's father on the occasion of\nher wedding to the Duke. It was supposed to be given by Zuni to her\neldest son when he came of weapon-carrying age. The hilt had a guard on\nwhich was inscribed in gold the motto: _Sooner hell than dishonor_. He\nfastened sword and scabbard to an iron ring on his broad leather belt,\nwent to a luxurious dressing table, pulled open a drawer and took out a\nstiletto. This he stuck through his belt, also a huge flintlock pistol\nwith a gold-and-ivory-chased butt. He loaded it with powder and an\niron ball he found in a compartment and put ammunition in a bag, which\nhe also hung from his belt. Then, well armed, he walked out onto the\nbalcony to take a quick view of the situation.\n\nThree stories below him was the walk which he had left a few minutes\nbefore. Many soldiers, and Zuni, were standing there, all looking\nup. As his face came into sight, visible in the moonlight and the\nup-reaching flares of their torches, a shout arose. Several of the\nmusket men raised their long-barreled weapons, but Zuni cried out for\nthem to hold their fire, she wanted him alive. Green's skin prickled\nat the vindictiveness in her voice and at the vision of what she was\nprobably planning for him. He'd been forced to see too many tortures\nand public executions not to know exactly what she designed for him.\nSuddenly overcome with rage that she could be so treacherous and\nbrutal, a rage perhaps flavored with self-disgust because he had made\nlove to her, he aimed his pistol at her. There was a click as the\nhammer struck the flint, a spark, a whoosh as the powder burnt in the\npan, a loud bang and a cloud of black smoke. When the fumes cleared\naway, he saw that everybody, including the Duchess, was running for\ncover. Naturally, he'd missed, for he'd had almost no practice with the\npistols, being a slave. Even if he'd been well trained, he probably\nwould not have struck his mark, so inaccurate were the weapons.\n\nWhile Green was reloading he heard a shout from above. Looking up, he\nsaw the Duke's round face, pale in the moonlight, hanging over the\nrailing of the balcony above. He raised his empty pistol, and the Duke,\nsqualling with fear, ran back into his quarters. Green laughed and said\nto himself that even if he was killed now he would at least have the\nsatisfaction of knowing that he had shamed the Duke, who was always\nboasting about his bravery in battle. Of course, his action had also\nmade it absolutely necessary for the Duke to have him killed at once,\nso that Green could not tell others that he'd put him to flight.\n\nHe grinned crookedly. What would happen when the soldiers received the\nDuke's orders, directly contradicting the Duchess's? The poor fellows\nwould scarcely know what to do. The man's commands would of course\nsupersede the woman's. But the woman would be furious and she would\nlater on find some means of punishing those who did succeed in killing\nGreen.\n\nIt was at that moment that he lost his smile and paled with fright. A\nloud deep-chested barking nearby. Not outside the apartment's door, but\n_inside_!\n\nHe cursed and whirled around just in time to see the large body\nlaunched toward his throat, the white fangs flashing and the green\nfire shining from its eyes as the moonlight struck them.\n\nEven in that moment of panic he realized that he'd forgotten the small\ndoor set inside the larger one so that Alzo could have admittance at\nany time. And if the big dog could get through, then soldiers could\nalso crawl through!\n\nInstinctively he thrust out the pistol and squeezed the trigger. It\ndid not go off, for there was no powder in the pan. But the barrel did\njam into the great mouth and deflect Alzo from his target, Green's\nthroat. Even so, Green was knocked backward by the impact, and he felt\nthe sharp teeth clamping down on his wrist. Those jaws were capable of\nbiting through his arm, and though he felt no pain, he was sickened by\nthe thought that he'd see a bloody stump when Alzo danced away from\nhim. However, his arm, though dripping blood from large gashes, was not\nhurt badly. The dog had been deterred by the barrel shoved down his\nthroat, choking him so that he could think of nothing for the moment\nbut getting clear of it.\n\nThe pistol clattered on the iron floor of the balcony. Alzo shook\nhis head, unaware in his frenzy that he was rid of the weapon. Green\nleaped up from the sitting position into which Alzo's charge had flung\nhim against the railing. Snarling as viciously as the dog, he braced\nhis feet against the juncture of the floor and railing and launched\nhimself straight out. At the same time, the canine jumped. They met\nhead on, Green's skull driving into the open mouth and knocking the dog\nbackward because his impetus was greater. Though the huge jaws bit down\nat his scalp, they snapped on air, and the animal fell to one side,\ngrowling. Green seized hold of the long tail, rolled away from the\nteeth now snapping at his ankles, and jerked at the tail so that the\ndog would swing away from him. He rose to one knee, pushed the dog away\nfrom him, though still keeping his frenzied grip with two hands, and\njumped to his feet. Frantically, the animal twisted around and bit at\nthe imprisoning hands. But he succeeded only in biting his own flank.\nHowling in anguish, he tried to lunge away. Green, making a supreme\neffort, raised the tail in the air. Naturally, the body came along with\nit. At the same time he half-turned from the animal, bent forward and,\nwith a convulsive motion, using his bowed back as a lever, threw Alzo\nover his head.\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nThe terrible growling suddenly changed to a high-pitched howl of\ndespair as Alzo flew over the railing and out into the air above the\nwalk. Green, leaning over to watch him, did not feel sorry for him. He\nwas exultant. He'd hated that dog and had dreamed of just such a moment.\n\nAlzo's yelping was cut off as he struck the parapet beside the walk,\nbounced off, and then dropped from view into the depths beyond. Green's\nstrength had been greater than he'd suspected, for he had thought only\nto toss the one hundred and fifty pound beast over the railing.\n\nThere was no time for savoring triumph. If the dog could get through\nthat little door, so could soldiers. He ran out into the room,\nexpecting that at least a dozen men had crawled in. But there was no\none. Why? The only thing he could think of was that they were afraid,\nknowing that if he at once dispatched the dog, he could leisurely knock\nthem over the head in their helpless on-all-fours position.\n\nThe door shook beneath a mighty impact. They'd taken the wiser, if the\nless courageous, course of battering rams. Green loaded his pistol,\nspilling the powder at his first attempt to prime the pan because\nhis hands shook so. He fired, and a large hole appeared in the wood.\nHowever, part of the ball also stuck out, for the door was planked\nthickly against just such weapons.\n\nThe battering ceased and he heard a thud as the ram was dropped on the\nfloor in hasty retreat. He smiled. As they were still operating under\nthe Duchess's instructions to take him alive--not yet countermanded by\nthe Duke's--they would not want to face pistol fire with only swords in\nhand. And in the first reflex to the shot they'd undoubtedly forgotten\nthat a ball couldn't penetrate the wood.\n\n\"This is living!\" said Green out loud. And he wondered that his voice\nshook as much as his legs did, and yet he felt a wild exultance\nshooting through his fear and knew that he was tasting both with a\nfine liking. Perhaps, he thought, he really liked this moment--even if\nhis death was around the corner--because he'd been repressed so long\nand violence was a wonderful therapy for releasing his resentment and\nclamped-down-on fury. Whatever the reason, he knew that this was one of\nthe high moments of his life and that if he survived he'd look back on\nit with pleasure and pride. And that was the strangest thing of all,\nsince in his culture the young were taught to abhor violence. Luckily,\nthey weren't so conditioned against it that the very thought of it\nparalyzed them. No hard neural paths had been set up against the action\nof violence; it was just that, philosophically speaking, they loathed\nthe concept. Fortunately, there was a philosophy of the body, too, a\nmuch older and deeper one. And while it was true that man could no\nmore live without philosophy of the mind than he could without bread,\nit had no place in Green at present. The fiery breath that flooded his\nbody now and made him so sensitive to what a fine thing it was to be\nalive while death was knocking at the door did not rise from any mental\nabstraction or profound meditation.\n\nGreen rolled back the carpets that led from the room to the balcony,\nfor he wanted a firm footing if it became necessary to make a running\nbroad jump from the balcony in an effort to clear the walk below\nand drop into the moat. He'd have to have very good timing and do\neverything just right the first time, like a parachute jump, otherwise\nhe'd end up with broken bones on the hard stones below.\n\nNot that he was going to make that leap unless he just had to. But he\nwas leaving an avenue open if his other measures didn't work.\n\nAgain he ran to the bureau and drew out a large bag of gunpowder,\nweighing at least five pounds. In the open end of this he inserted a\nfuse, and tied the neck around it. While he was doing this, he heard\nshouts and cheers as the soldiers returned to the door, picked up their\nram and hurled themselves at the thick planking. He did not bother\nshooting again but instead lit the fuse with a candle. Then he walked\nto the large door, pushed out the small dog's door and tossed the bag\nthrough it. He jumped back and ran, though there was little chance\nthat the resultant explosion would harm the door.\n\nThere was a silence as the soldiers were probably staring paralyzed\nat the smoking fuse. Then--a roar! The room shook, the door fell in,\nblasted off its hinges, and black smoke poured in. Green ran into the\ncloud, got down on all fours, scuttled through the doorway, cursed\ndesperately when the hilt of his sword caught on the doorframe, tore\nloose and lunged through into the dense smoke that filled the anteroom.\nHis groping hands felt the ram where it had dropped, and the wet warm\nface of a soldier who'd fallen. He coughed sharply from the biting\nfumes but went on until his head butted into the wall. Then he felt\nto his right, where he imagined the door was, came to it, passed\nthrough and on into the next room, also filled with a cloud. After he'd\nscuttled like a bug across its floor, he dared to open his eyes for\na quick look. The smoke was thinner and was pouring out the door to\nthe hallway, just in front of him. He saw no feet in the clearer area\nbetween the floor and the bottom of the clouds, so he rose and walked\nthrough the door. To his left, he knew, the hall led to a stairway that\nwas probably now jammed with soldiers. To his right would be another\nstairway that went up to the Duke's apartments. That was the only way\nhe could go.\n\nLuckily the smoke was still so dense in the corridor that those\nassembled on the left staircase couldn't see him. They'd think he was\nin the Duchess's rooms yet, and he hoped that when they did rush it and\ndidn't find him there the rolled-back carpets would give them the idea\nthat he'd taken a running broad jump from the balcony. In which case,\nthey'd at once search the moat for him. And if they didn't find him\nswimming there, as they wouldn't, then they might presume he'd either\ndrowned or else got to the shore and was now somewhere in the darkness\nof the city.\n\nHe felt along the wall toward the staircase, his other hand gripping\nthe stiletto. When his fingers ran across the arm of a man leaning\nagainst the wall, he withdrew them at once, bent his knees and in a\ncrouching position ran in the general direction of the stairs. The\nsmoke got even thinner here so that he saw the steps in time to avoid\nfalling over them. Unfortunately the Duke and another man were also\nthere. Both saw his figure emerge into the torchlight from the clouds,\nbut he had the advantage of knowing who he was, so that he had plunged\nthe thin stiletto into the soldier's throat before he could act. The\nDuke tried to leap past Green, but the Earthman stuck a leg out and\ntripped him. Then he grabbed the ruler's arm, twisted it behind his\nback, forced him up and on his knees and, using the arm as a cruel\nlever, raised him. He enjoyed hearing the Duke moan, though he'd never\nconsciously taken pleasure in pain before. He had time to think that\nperhaps he liked this because of the torture the Duke had inflicted on\nhis many helpless victims. Of course, he, Green, a highly civilized\nman, shouldn't be feeling this way. But the rightness or wrongness of\nan emotion never kept anybody from experiencing it.\n\n\"Up you go!\" he said in a low, harsh voice, directing the Duke toward\nhis apartments, manipulating the twisted arm as a steering column. By\nthen the smoke had cleared away so that those at the other end of the\ncorridor could see that something was wrong. A shout arose, followed by\nthe slap of running feet on the stone flags. Green stopped, turned the\nDuke so he faced the approaching crowd and said to him, \"Tell them that\nI will kill you unless they go away.\"\n\nTo emphasize his point he stuck the end of the stiletto into the Duke's\nback and pressed hard enough to draw blood. The Duke quivered, then\nbecame rigid. Nevertheless he said, \"I will not do so. That would be\ndishonor.\"\n\nGreen couldn't help admiring such courage, even if it did make his\npredicament worse. He refused to kill the Duke just then because that\nwould throw away the only trump card he held at that moment. So he\nstuck the stiletto in his teeth and, still holding with one hand to the\nDuke's twisted arm, took the Duke's pistol from his belt and fired over\nhis shoulder.\n\nThere was a whoosh of flame that burned the Duke's ear and made him\ngive a cry that was almost drowned out in the roar of the explosion.\nThe nearest man threw up his hands, dropping his spear, and fell on his\nface. The others stopped. Doubtless, they were still operating under\nthe Duchess's orders not to kill Green, for the Duke must have arrived\nat the foot of the staircase just in time to witness the explosion of\nthe gunpowder. And he was in no condition to issue contrary orders,\nbeing deafened and stunned by the report almost going off in his ear.\n\nGreen shouted out, \"Go back, or I will kill the Duke! It is his wish\nthat you go back to the stairs and do not bother us until he sends word\nto you!\"\n\nBy the flickering light of the torches he could see the puzzled\nexpression on the soldiers' faces. It was only then he realized that in\nhis extreme excitement he had shouted the orders in English. Hastily,\nhe translated his demands, and was relieved to see them turn and\nretreat, though reluctantly. He then half-dragged the Duke up the steps\nto his apartments, where he barred the door and primed his pistol again.\n\n\"So far, so good!\" he said, in English. \"The question is what now,\nlittle man?\"\n\nThe ruler's rooms were even more luxurious than his wife's, and were\nlarger because they had to contain not only the Duke's hundreds of\nhunting trophies, including human heads, but his collection of glass\nbirds. Indeed, one might easily see where his heart really lay, for\nthe heads had collected dust, whereas each and every glittering winged\ncreature was immaculate. It would have gone hard on a servant who'd\nneglected his cleaning duties in the great rooms dedicated to the\ncollection.\n\nOn seeing them Green smiled slightly.\n\nWhen you're fighting for your life, hit a man where he's softest....\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nIt was a matter of two minutes to tie the Duke in a chair with several\nof the hunting whips hanging from the walls.\n\nMeanwhile the Duke came out of his daze. He began screaming every\ninvective he knew--and he knew quite a lot--and promising every refined\ntorture he could think of--and his knowledge was not poverty-stricken\nin that area either. Green waited until the Duke had given himself a\nbad case of laryngitis. Then he told him, in a firm but quiet voice,\nwhat he intended to do unless the Duke got him out of the castle.\nTo emphasize his determination, he picked up a bludgeon studded with\niron spikes and swung it whistling through the air. The Duke's eyes\nwidened, and he paled. All of a sudden he changed from a defiant ruler\nchallenging his captor to inflict his worst upon him to a shrunken,\ntrembling old man.\n\n\"And I will smash every last bird in these rooms,\" said Green. \"And I\nwill open the chest that lies behind that pile of furs and take out of\nit your most precious treasure, the bird you have not even shown to the\nEmperor for fear he would get jealous and demand it as a gift from you,\nthe bird you take out at rare intervals and over which you gloat all\nnight.\"\n\n\"My wife told you!\" gasped the Duke. \"Oh, what an _izzot_ she is!\"\n\n\"Granted,\" said Green. \"She babbled to me many secrets, being a\nfeatherbrained, idle, silly, stupid female, a fit consort for you. So I\nknow where the unique _exurotr_ statuette made by Izan Yushwa of Metzva\nMoosh is hidden, the glass bird that cost the whole dukedom a great tax\nand brought many bitter tears and hardships from your subjects. I will\nhave no compunction about destroying it even if it is the only one ever\nmade and if Izan Yushwa is now dead so that it can never be replaced.\"\n\nThe Duke's eyes bulged in horror.\n\n\"No, no!\" he said in a quavering voice. \"That would be unthinkable,\nblasphemous, sacrilegious! Have you no sense of beauty, degenerate\nslave that you are, that you would smash forever that most beautiful of\nall things made by the hands of man?\"\n\n\"I would.\"\n\nThe Duke's mouth drew down at the corners; suddenly, he was weeping.\n\nGreen was embarrassed, for he knew how great must be the emotion that\ncould make this man, educated in a hard school, break down before an\nenemy. And he reflected upon what a strange thing a human being was.\nHere was a man who would literally allow his throat to be cut before he\nwould display cowardice by bargaining for it. But to have his precious\ncollection of glass birds threatened...!\n\nGreen shrugged. Why try to understand it? The only thing to do was to\nuse whatever came his way.\n\n\"Very well, if you wish to save them you must do this.\" And he detailed\nexactly the Duke's moves and orders for the next ten minutes. He\nthereupon made him swear by the most holy oaths and upon his family\nname and by the honor of the founder of his family that he would not\nbetray Green.\n\n\"To make sure,\" added the Earthman, \"I shall take the _exurotr_ with\nme. Once I know your word is good I'll take steps to see that it is\nreturned undamaged to you.\"\n\n\"Can I depend on that?\" breathed the Duke hoarsely, rolling his big\nbrown eyes.\n\n\"Yes, I will contact Zingaro, Business Agent of the Thieves' Guild, and\nhe will return it to you, for a compensation, of course. But before we\nconclude this bargain you must swear that you will not harm Amra, my\nwife, nor any of her children, nor confiscate her business but will\nbehave toward her as if this had never happened.\"\n\nThe Duke swallowed hard, but he swore. Green was happy, because, though\nhe was going to desert Amra, he was at least insuring her future.\n\nIt was a long, long hour later that Green came out of his hiding place\ninside a large closet in the Duke's apartment. Even though the Duke\nhad sworn the holiest of oaths, he was as treacherous as any of the\nbarbarians on this planet, and that was very treacherous indeed. Green\nhad stood behind the door, sweating and listening to the loud and\nsometimes incoherent conversation taking place between the Duke, his\nsoldiers and the Duchess. The Duke was a good actor, for he convinced\neverybody that he had escaped from the mad slave Green, had seized a\nsword and forced him to make a running broad jump from the balcony\nrailing. Of course, several guardsmen had seen a large man-sized object\nhurtle from the balcony and fall with a loud splash into the moat\nbelow. There was no doubt that the slave must have broken his back when\nhe struck the water or else he had been knocked out and then drowned.\nWhatever had happened, he had not come out.\n\nGreen, his ear against the door, could not help smiling at this,\ndespite his tension. He and the Duke had combined forces to heave out a\nwooden statue of the god Zuzupatr, weighted with iron dishes tied to\nit so that it wouldn't float. In the moonlight and the excitement, the\nidol must have looked enough like a falling man to deceive anybody.\n\nThe only one seemingly not satisfied was Zuni. She raised every kind\nof hell she knew, behaved in a most undignified manner, screeched\nat her husband because his blood-thirstiness and lack of restraint\nhad robbed her of the exquisite tortures she'd planned for the slave\nwho had attempted to dishonor her. The Duke, his face getting redder\nand redder, had suddenly bellowed out at her to quit acting like a\ncondemned _izzot_ and go at once to her apartments. To show that he\nmeant what he said he ordered several soldiers to escort her. Zuni,\nhowever, was too stupid to see how perilous was her situation, how near\nthe headsman's ax. She raved on until the Duke gave a sign and two\nsoldiers seized her elbows--at least, Green supposed they did, for she\nyelled at them to take their dirty hands off her--and propelled her out\nof the rooms. Even then it took some time before the Duke could close\nthe doors on his last guest.\n\nThe little ruler opened the door. In his hand he held a priest's green\nrobe, the sacerdotal hexagonal spectacles and a mask for the lower part\nof the face. The mask was customarily worn when a monk was on a mission\nfor a high dignitary. During the time the face was covered the monk\nwas under a vow not to speak to anyone until he had reached the person\nfor whom he had a message. Thus, Green would not be bothered with any\nembarrassing questions.\n\nHe put on the robe, spectacles and mask, threw the hood over his head\nand placed the glass _exurotr_ inside his shirt. His loaded pistol he\nkept up one capacious sleeve, holding it with the other hand.\n\n\"Remember,\" said the Duke anxiously as he opened the door and peered\nout to see if anybody was on the staircase, \"remember that you must\ntake every precaution against damaging the _exurotr_. Tell Zingaro that\nhe must at once pack it in a chest filled with silks and sawdust so\nit won't break. I will die a thousand deaths until it comes back once\nagain to my collection.\"\n\nAnd I, thought Green, will die a thousand deaths until I get safely\nout of your reach, out of the city and far away on a windroller.\n\nHe promised again that he would keep his word as well as the Duke\nkept his, but that he would also take every measure to insure against\ntreachery. Then he slipped out and closed the door. He was on his own\nuntil he boarded the _Bird of Fortune_.\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nHe had no trouble at all, except for making his way through the thick\ntraffic. The explosions and shouting coming from the castle had aroused\nthe whole town, so that everybody who could stand on his two feet, or\ncould get somebody to carry him, was outside, milling around, asking\nquestions, talking excitedly and in general trying to make as much\nchaos as possible and to enjoy every bit of this excuse to take part in\na general disturbance. Green strode through them, his head bent but his\neyes probing ahead. He made fairly good progress, only being held up\ntemporarily a few times by the human herd.\n\nFinally the flat plain of the windbreak lay before him, and the many\nmasts of the great wheeled vessels were a forest around him. He was\nable to get to the _Bird of Fortune_ unchallenged by any of the dozens\nof guardsmen that he passed. The 'roller herself lay snugly between two\ndocks, where a huge gang of slaves had towed her. There was a gangway\nrunning up from one of the docks, and at both ends stood a sailor on\nguard, clad in the family colors of yellow, violet and crimson. They\nchewed _grixtr_ nut, something like betel except that it stained both\nteeth and lips and gave them a green color.\n\nWhen Green stepped boldly upon the gangway the nearest guard looked\ndoubtful and put his hand on his knife. Evidently he'd had no orders\nfrom Miran about a priest, but he knew what the mask indicated and that\nawed him enough so that he did not dare oppose the stranger. Nor was\nthe second guard any quicker in making up his mind. Green slipped by\nhim, entered the mid-decks and walked up the gangway to the foredeck.\nHe knocked quietly on the door of the captain's cabin. A moment later\nit swung violently open; light flooded out, then was blocked off by\nMiran's huge round bulk.\n\nGreen stepped inside, pressing the captain back, Miran reached for\nhis dagger but stopped when he saw the intruder take off the mask and\nspectacles and throw back the hood.\n\n\"Green! So you made it! I did not think it was possible.\"\n\n\"With me all things are possible,\" replied Green modestly. He sat down\nat the table, or rather crumpled at it, and began repeating in a dry\nvoice, halting with fatigue, the story of his escape. In a few minutes\nthe narrow cabin rang with the captain's laughter and his one eye\ntwinkled and beamed as he slapped Green on the back and said that by\nall the gods here was a man he was proud to have aboard.\n\n\"Have a drink of this Lespaxian wine, even better than Chalousma, and\none I bring out only for honored guests,\" said Miran, chortling.\n\nGreen reached out a hand for the proffered glass, but his fingers never\nclosed upon the stem, for his head sank onto the tabletop, and his\nsnores were tremendous.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was three days later that a much-rested Green, his skin comfortably,\neven glowingly, tight with superb Lespaxian, sat at the table and\nwaited for the word to come that he could finally leave the cabin.\nThe first day of inactivity he'd slept and eaten and paced back and\nforth, anxious for news of what was going on in the city. At nightfall\nMiran had returned with the story that a furious search was organized\nin the city itself and the outlying hills. Of course, the Duke would\ninsist that the 'rollers themselves be turned inside-out, and Miran\nwas cursing because that would mean a fatal delay. They could not wait\nfor more than three more days. The fish tanks had been installed;\nthe provisions were almost all in the hold; his roistering crewmen\nwere being dragged out of the taverns and sobered up; two days after\ntomorrow the great vessel would have to be towed out of the windbreak\nand sails set for the perilous and long voyage.\n\n\"I wouldn't worry,\" said Green. \"You will find that tomorrow word will\ncome from the hills that Green has been killed by a wild man of the\nClan Axaquexcan, who will demand money before handing the dead slave's\nhead over. The Duke will accept this as true and will conveniently\nforget all about searching the 'rollers.\"\n\nMiran rubbed his fat oily palms, while one pale eye glowed. He loved a\ngood intrigue, the more elaborate the better.\n\nBut the second day, even though what Green had predicted came true\nMiran became nervous and began to find the big blond man's constant\npresence in his cabin irksome. He wanted to send him down into the\nhold, but Green firmly refused, reminding the captain of his promise\nof haven within these very walls. He then calmly appropriated another\nbottle of the merchant's Lespaxian, having located its hiding place,\nand drank it. Miran glowered, and his face twitched with repressed\nresentment, but he said nothing because of the custom that a guest\ncould do what he pleased--within reasonable limits.\n\nThe third day Miran was positively a tub of nerves, jittery, sweating,\npacing back and forth. At last he left the cabin, only to begin pacing\nback and forth on the deck. Green could hear his footsteps for hours.\nThe fourth day he was up at dawn and bellowing orders to his crewmen. A\nlittle later Green felt the big vessel move and heard the shouts of the\nforemen of the towing gangs and the chants of the slaves as they bent\ntheir backs hauling at the huge ropes attached to the 'roller.\n\nSlowly, oh, so slowly it seemed to Green, the craft creaked forward. He\ndared open a curtain to look out the square port-hole. Before him was\nthe rearing side of another 'roller, and just for a second it seemed to\nhim that it, not his vessel, was the one that was moving. Then he saw\nthat the 'roller was advancing at a pace of about fifteen or sixteen\nfeet a minute. It would take them an hour to get past the towering\nbrick walls of the windbreak.\n\nHe sweated out that hour and unconsciously fell into his childhood\nhabit of biting his nails, expecting at any time to see the docks\nsuddenly boil with soldiers running after the _Bird of Fortune_,\nshouting for it to stop because it had a runaway slave aboard.\n\nBut no such thing occurred, and at last the tug gangs stopped and began\ncoiling up their ropes, and Green quit chewing his nails. Miran shouted\norders, the first mate repeated them, there was the slap of many feet\non the decks above, the sound of many voices chanting. A sound as of\na knife cutting cloth told that the sails had been released. Suddenly,\nthe vessel rocked as the wind caught it and a vibration through the\nfloors announced that the big axles were turning, the huge wheels with\ntheir tires of _chacorotr_, a kind of rubber, were revolving. The\n_Bird_ was on the wing!\n\nGreen opened the door slightly and took one last look at the city of\nQuotz. It was receding rapidly at the rate of fifteen miles an hour,\nand at this distance it looked like a toy city nestled in the lap of\na hillock. Now that the danger from it was gone and the odors too far\naway to offend his nose it looked quite romantic and enticing.\n\n\"And so we say farewell to exotic Quotz,\" murmured Green in the\napproved travelog fashion. \"So long, you son of an _izzot_!\"\n\nThen, though he was supposed to stay inside until Miran summoned him,\nhe opened the door and stepped out.\n\nAnd almost fainted dead away.\n\n\"Hello, honey,\" said Amra.\n\nGreen scarcely heard the children grouped around her also extend their\ngreetings. He was just coming out of the dizziness and blackness that\nhad threatened to overcome him. Perhaps it was the wine coupled with\nthe shock. Perhaps, he was to think later, it was just that he was\nplain scared, scared as he'd not been in the castle. Ashamed, too, that\nAmra had found out his plans to desert her, and deeply ashamed because\nshe loved him anyway and would not allow him to go without her. She had\na tremendous pride that must have cost her great effort to choke down.\n\nProbably, he was to say to himself later on, it was sheer fear of her\ntongue that made him quail so. There was nothing that a man dreaded\nso much as a woman's tonguelashing, especially if he deserved it. Oh,\nespecially!\n\nThat was to come later. At the moment Amra was strangely quiet and\nmeek. All she would say was that she had many business connections and\nthat she knew well Zingaro, the Thieves' Guild Business Agent. They had\nbeen childhood playmates, and they'd helped each other in various shady\ntransactions since. It was only natural that she should hear about the\n_exurotr_ a slave hiding on the _Bird of Fortune_ had given Zingaro\nto take back to the Duke. Cornering Zingaro, she had worked out of him\nenough information to be sure that Green had escaped to the 'roller.\nAfter all, Zingaro was under oath only to be reticent about certain\ndetails of the whole matter. From there she had taken the business into\nher own hands, had told Miran that she would inform the Duchess of\nGreen's whereabouts unless he permitted her and her family to go along\non the voyage.\n\n\"Here I am, your faithful and loyal wife,\" she said, opening her arms\nin an expansive gesture.\n\n\"I am overwhelmed with emotion,\" replied Green, for once not\nexaggerating.\n\n\"Then come and embrace me,\" she cried, \"and don't stand there as if\nyou'd seen the dead return from the grave!\"\n\n\"Before all these people?\" he said, half-stunned, looking around at\nthe grinning captain and first mate on the foredeck beside him and at\nthe sailors and their families on the middeck below. The only ones not\nwatching him were the goggled helmsmen, whose backs were turned because\nthey were intent on wrestling with the great spoked wheel.\n\n\"Why not?\" she retorted. \"You'll be sleeping on the open deck with\nthem, eating with them, breathing their breath, feeling their elbows at\nevery turn, cursing, laughing, fighting, getting drunk, making love,\nall, all on the open deck. So why not embrace me? Or don't you want me\nto be here?\"\n\n\"The thought never entered my head,\" he said, stepping up to her and\ntaking her in his arms. Or, if it had, he reflected, you can bet that\nI'd not dare say it.\n\nAfter all, it was good to feel her soft, warm, firmly curved body again\nand know that there was at least one person on this godforsaken planet\nthat cared for him. What could have made him think for one minute that\nhe could endure life without her?\n\nWell, he had. She just would not, could not, fit into his life if he\never got back on Earth.\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nMiran coughed and said, \"You two and your children and maid must get\noff the deck and go amidships. That is where you will live. Never again\nmust you set foot upon the steering deck unless you are summoned. I run\na tight ship and discipline is strictly adhered to.\"\n\nGreen followed Amra and the children down the steps to the deck below,\nnoticing for the first time that Inzax, the pretty blond slave who took\ncare of the children, was also aboard. You had to give credit to Amra.\nWherever she went she traveled in style.\n\nHe also thought that if this was a tight ship a loose one must be sheer\nchaos. Cats and dogs were running here and there, playing with the many\ninfants, or else fighting with each other. Women sat and sewed or hung\nup washing or dried dishes or nursed babies. Hens clucked defiantly\nfrom behind the bars of their coops, scattered everywhere. On the\nport side there was even a pigpen holding about thirty of the tiny\nrabbit-eared porcines.\n\nGreen followed Amra to a place where an awning had been stretched to\nmake a roof.\n\n\"Isn't this nice?\" she said. \"It has sides which we can pull down when\nit rains or when we want privacy, as I suppose we will, you being so\nfunny in some ways.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's delightful,\" he hastened to assure her. \"I see you even have\nsome feather mattresses. And a cookstove.\"\n\nHe looked around. \"But where are the fish tanks? I thought Miran was\ngoing to bolt them to the deck?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, he said that they were too valuable to expose to gunfire if we\nencountered pirates. So he had the deck cut open wide enough to lower\nthe tanks inside the hold. Then the deck planking was replaced. Most of\nthese people here would be sleeping below if it weren't for the tanks.\nBut there's no room now.\"\n\nGreen decided to take a look around. He liked to have a thorough\nknowledge of his immediate environment so that he would know how to\nbehave if an emergency arose.\n\nThe windroller itself was about two hundred feet long. Its beam was\nabout thirty-four feet. The hull was boat-shaped, and the narrow keel\nrested on fourteen axles. Twenty-eight enormous solid rubber-tired\nwheels turned at the ends of these axles. Thick ropes of the tough\nrubber-like substance were tied to the ends of the axles and to the\ntops of the hull itself. These were to hold the body steady and keep it\nfrom going over when the 'roller reeled under too strong a side wind\nand also to provide some resiliency when the 'roller was making a turn.\nBeing aboard at such times was almost like being on a water-sailing\nship. As the front pair of wheels--the steering wheels--turned and the\nlongitudinal axis of the craft slowly changed direction, the body of\nthe vessel, thrust by the shifting impact of the winds, also tilted.\nNot too far, never as far as a boat in similar case, but enough to give\none an uneasy feeling. The cables on the opposing side would stretch to\na degree and then would stop the sidewise motion of the keel and there\nwould be a slight and slow roll to the other direction. Then a shorter\nand slower motion back again. It was enough to make a novice green.\n'Roller sickness wasn't uncommon at the beginning of a voyage or during\na violent windstorm. Like its aqueous counterpart, it affected the\nsufferer so that he could only hang over the rail and wish he _would_\ndie.\n\nThe _Bird of Fortune_ sported a curving bow and a high foredeck. On\nthis was fastened the many-spoked steering wheel. Two helmsmen always\nattended it, two men wearing hexagonal goggles and close-fitting\nleather helmets with high crests of curled wire. Behind them stood\nthe captain and first mate, giving their attention alternately to the\nhelmsmen and to the sailors on deck and aloft. The middeck was sunken,\nand the poopdeck, though raised, was not as high as the foredeck.\n\nThe four masts were tall, but not as tall as those of a marine craft\nof similar size. High masts would have given the 'roller a tendency\nto capsize in a very strong wind, despite the weight of the axles and\nwheels. Therefore, the yardarms, reaching far out beyond the sides of\nthe hull, were comparatively longer than a seaship's. When the _Bird_\ncarried a full weight of canvas she looked, to a mariner's eyes, squat\nand ungainly. Moreover, yards had been fixed at right angles to the\ntop of the hull and to the keel itself. Extra canvas was hung between\nthese spars. The sight of all that sail sticking from between the\nwheels was enough to drive an old sailor to drink.\n\nThree masts were square-rigged. The aft mast was fore-and-aft rigged\nand was used to help the steering. There was no bowsprit.\n\nAltogether, it was a strange-looking craft. But once one was accustomed\nto it, one saw it was as beautiful as a ship of the sea.\n\nIt was as formidable, too, for the _Bird_ carried five large cannon on\nthe middeck, six cannon on the second deck, a lighter swivel cannon on\nthe steering deck, and two swivels on the poopdeck.\n\nHung from davits were two long liferollers and a gig, all wheeled and\nwith folding masts. If the _Bird_ was wrecked it could be abandoned and\nall the crew could scoot off in the little rollers.\n\nGreen wasn't given much time for inspection. He became aware that\na tall, lean sailor was regarding him intently. This fellow was\ndark-skinned but had the pale blue eyes of the Tropat hillsmen. He\nmoved like a cat and wore a long, thin dagger, sharp as a claw. A nasty\ncustomer, thought Green.\n\nPresently, the nasty customer, seeing that Green was not going to\nnotice him, walked in front of him so that he could not help being\nannoyed. At the same time, the babble around them died and everybody\nturned his head to stare.\n\n\"Friend,\" said Green, affably enough, \"would you mind standing off to\none side? You are blocking my view.\"\n\nThe fellow spat _grixtr_ juice at Green's feet.\n\n\"No slave calls me friend. Yes, I am blocking your view, and I would\nmind getting out of the way.\"\n\n\"Evidently you object to my presence here,\" said Green. \"What is the\nmatter? You don't like my face?\"\n\n\"No, I don't. And I don't like to have as a crewmate a stinking slave.\"\n\n\"Speaking of odors,\" said Green, \"would you please stand to leeward of\nme? I've been through a lot lately and I've a delicate stomach.\"\n\n\"Silence, you son of an _izzot_!\" roared the sailor, red-faced. \"Have\nrespect toward your betters, or I'll strike you down and throw your\nbody overboard.\"\n\n\"It takes two to make a murder, just as it takes two to make a\nbargain,\" said Green in a loud voice, hoping that Miran would hear\nand be reminded of his promise of protection. But Miran shrugged his\nshoulders. He had done as much as he could. It was up to Green to make\nhis way from now on.\n\n\"It is true that I am a slave,\" he said. \"But I was not born one.\nBefore being captured I was a freeman who knew liberty as none of you\nhere know it. I came from a country where there were no masters because\nevery man was his own master.\n\n\"However, that is neither here nor there. The point is that I earned my\nfreedom, that I fought like a warrior, not a slave, to get aboard the\n_Bird_. I wish to become a crew member, to become a blood-brother to\nthe Clan Effenycan.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed, and what can you contribute to the Clan that we should\nconsider you worthy of sharing our blood?\"\n\nWhat indeed? Green thought. The sweat broke out all over his body,\nthough the morning wind was cool.\n\nAt that moment he saw Miran speak to a sailor, who disappeared below\ndecks and come out almost at once carrying a small harp in his hand.\nOh, yes, now he remembered that he had told the captain what a\nwonderful harpist and singer he was, just the man that the Clan, eager\nfor entertainment on the long voyages, would be likely to initiate.\n\nThe unfortunate thing about that was that Green couldn't play a note.\n\nNevertheless he took the instrument from the sailor and gravely plucked\nits strings. He listened to the tones, frowned, adjusted the pegs,\nplucked them again, then handed the harp back.\n\n\"Sorry, this is an inferior instrument,\" he said haughtily. \"Haven't\nyou anything better? I couldn't think of degrading my art on such a\ncheap monstrosity.\"\n\n\"Gods above!\" screamed a man standing nearby. \"That is my harp you\nare talking about, the beloved harp of me, the bard Grazoot! Slave!\nTone-deaf son of a laryngiteal mother! You will answer to me for that\ninsult!\"\n\n\"No,\" said the sailor, \"this is my affair. I, Ezkr, will test this\nlubber's fitness to join the Clan and be called brother.\"\n\n\"Over my dead body, brother!\"\n\n\"If you so wish it, brother!\"\n\nThere were more angry words until presently Miran himself came down\nto the middeck. \"By Mennirox, this is a disgrace!\" he bellowed. \"Two\nEffenycan quarreling before a slave! Come, make a decision quietly, or\nI will have you both thrown overboard. It is not too far to walk back\nto Quotz.\"\n\n\"We will cast dice to see who is the lucky man,\" said the sailor,\nEzkr. Grinning gap-toothedly, he reached into the pouch that hung from\nhis belt, and pulled out the hexagonal ivories. A few minutes later\nhe rose from his knees, having won four out of six throws. Green was\ndisappointed more than he cared to show, for he had hoped that if he\nhad to fight anybody it would be the pudgy, soft-looking harpist, not\nthe tough sailor.\n\nEzkr seemed to agree with Green that he could not have had worse luck.\nChewing _grixtr_ so rapidly that the green-flecked slaver ran down his\nlong chin, Ezkr announced the terms that the blond slave would have to\nmeet to prove his fitness.\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nFor a moment Green thought of leaving the ship and making his way on\nfoot.\n\nMiran protested loudly. \"This is ridiculous. Why can you not fight on\ndeck like two ordinary men and be satisfied if one gives the other a\nflesh wound? That way I won't stand the chance of losing you, Ezkr, one\nof my top topmen. If you should slip, who could take your place? This\ngreen hand here?\"\n\nEzkr ignored his captain's indignation, knowing that the code of the\nClan protected him. He spit and said, \"Anybody can wield a dagger. I\nwant to see what kind of a man this Green is aloft. Walking a yard is\nthe best way to see the color of his blood.\"\n\nYes, thought Green, his skin goose-pimpling. You'll likely see my\nblood all right, splashed from here to the horizon when I fall!\n\nHe asked Miran if he could withdraw a moment to his tent to pray to his\ngods for success. Miran nodded, and Green had Amra let down the sides\nof his shelter while he dropped to his knees. As soon as his privacy\nwas assured, he handed her a long turban cloth and told her to go\noutside. She looked surprised, but when he told her what else she was\nto do, she smiled and kissed him.\n\n\"You are a clever man, Alan. I was right to prefer you above any other\nman I might have had, and I could have had the best.\"\n\n\"Save the compliments for afterwards, when we'll know if it works,\" he\nsaid. \"Hurry to the stove and do what I say. If anybody asks you what\nyou are up to, tell them that the stuff is necessary for my religious\nritual. The gods,\" he said as she ducked through the tent opening,\n\"often come in handy. If they didn't exist it would be necessary to\ninvent them.\"\n\nAmra paused and turned with an adoring face. \"Ah, Alan, that is one of\nthe many things for which I love you. You are always originating these\nwitty sayings. How clever, and how dangerously blasphemous!\"\n\nHe shrugged, airily dismissing her compliment as if it were nothing.\n\nIn a minute she returned with the turban wrapped around something limp\nbut heavy. And within two minutes he stepped out from the tent, clad\nin a loincloth, leather belt, dagger and turban. Silently, he began\nclimbing the rope ladder that rose to the tip of the nearest mast.\nBehind him came Ezkr.\n\nHe did get some encouragement from Amra and the children. The Duke's\ntwo boys cried out to him to cut the so-and-so's throat, but if he was\nkilled instead, they would avenge him when they grew up, if not sooner.\nEven the blond maid, Inzax, wept. He felt somewhat better, for it was\ngood to know that some people cared for him. And the knowledge that he\nhad to survive and make sure that these women and children didn't come\nto grief was an added stimulus.\n\nNevertheless he felt his momentarily gained courage oozing out of his\nsweat pores with every step upward. It was so high up here, and so far\ndown below. The craft itself became smaller and smaller and the people\nshrank to dolls, to upturned white faces that soon became less faces\nthan blanks. The wind howled through the rigging and the mast, which\nhad seemed so solid and steady when he was at its base, now became\nfragile and swaying.\n\n\"It takes guts to be a sailor and a blood-brother of the Clan\nEffenycan,\" said Ezkr. \"Do you have them, Green?\"\n\n\"Yes, but if I get any sicker I'll lose them, and you'll be sorry,\nbeing below me,\" muttered Green to himself.\n\nFinally, after what seemed endless clambering into the very clouds\nthemselves, he arrived at the topmost yard. If he had thought the mast\nthin and flexible, the arm seemed like a toothpick poised over an\nabyss. And he was supposed to inch his way out to the whipping tip,\nthen turn and come back fighting!\n\n\"If you were not a coward you would stand up and walk out,\" called Ezkr.\n\n\"Sticks and stones will break my bones,\" replied Green, but did not\nenlighten the puzzled sailor as to what he meant. Sitting down on the\nyard, he put his legs around it and began working his way out. Halfway\nto the arm he stopped and dared to look down. Once was enough. There\nwas nothing but hard, grassy ground directly beneath him, seemingly a\nmile below, and the flat plain rushing by, and the huge wheels turning,\nturning.\n\n\"Go on!\" shouted Ezkr.\n\nGreen turned his head and told him in indelicate language what he could\ndo with the yard and the whole ship for that matter if he could manage\nit.\n\nEzkr's dark face reddened and he stood up and began walking out on the\nyard. Green's eyes widened. This man could actually do it!\n\nBut when he was a few feet away the sailor stopped and said, \"No, you\nare trying to anger me so I will grapple with you here and perhaps be\npushed off, since you have a firmer hold. No, I will not be such a\nfool. It is you who must try to get past me.\"\n\nHe turned and walked almost carelessly back to the mast, against which\nhe leaned while he waited.\n\n\"You have to go out to the very end,\" he repeated. \"Else you won't\npass the test even if you should get by me, which, of course, you\nwon't.\"\n\nGreen gritted his teeth and humped out to what he considered close\nenough to the end, about two feet away. Any more might break the arm,\nas it was already bending far down. Or so it seemed to him.\n\nHe then backed away, managed to turn, and to work back to within\nseveral feet of Ezkr. Here he paused to regain his breath, his strength\nand his courage.\n\nThe sailor waited, one hand on a rope to steady himself, the other with\nits dagger held point-out at Green.\n\nThe Earthman began unwinding his turban.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" said Ezkr, frowning with sudden anxiety.\n\nUp to this point he had been master, because he knew what to expect.\nBut if something unconventional happened....\n\nGreen shrugged his shoulders and continued his very careful and slow\nunwrapping of his headpiece.\n\n\"I don't want to spill this,\" he said.\n\n\"Spill what?\"\n\n\"This!\" shouted Green, and he whipped the turban upward towards Ezkr's\nface.\n\nThe turban itself was too far from the sailor to touch him. But the\nsand contained within it flew into his eyes before the wind could\ndissipate it. Amra, following her husband's directions, had collected a\nlarge amount from the fireplace's sand pile to wrap in it, and though\nit had made his head feel heavy it had been worth it.\n\nEzkr screamed and clutched at his eyes, releasing his dagger. At the\nsame time, Green slid forward and rammed his fist into the man's groin.\nThen, as Ezkr crumpled toward him, he caught him and eased him down. He\nfollowed his first blow with a chopping of the edge of his palm against\nthe fellow's neck. Ezkr quit screaming and passed out. Green rolled him\nover so that he lay on his stomach across the yard, supported on one\nside by the mast, with his legs, arms and head dangling. That was all\nhe wanted to do for him. He had no intention of carrying him down. His\nonly wish was to get to the deck, where he'd be safe. If Ezkr fell off\nnow, too bad.\n\nAmra and Inzax were waiting at the foot of the shrouds when Green\nslowly climbed off. When he set foot on the deck, he thought his legs\nwould give way, they were trembling so. Amra, noticing this, quickly\nput her arms around him as if to embrace the conquering hero but\nactually to help support him.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he muttered. \"I need your strength, Amra.\"\n\n\"Anybody would who had done what you've done,\" she said. \"But my\nstrength and all of me is at your disposal, Alan.\"\n\nThe children were looking at him with wide, admiring eyes and yelling,\n\"That's our daddy! Big blond Green! He's quick as a grass cat, bites\nlike a dire dog and'll spit poison in your eye, like a flying snake!\"\n\nThen, in the next moment, he was submerged under the men and women of\nthe Clan, all anxious to congratulate him for his feat and to call him\nbrother. The only ones who did not crowd around, trying to kiss him on\nthe lips, were the officers of the _Bird_ and the wife and children of\nthe unfortunate sailor, Ezkr. These were climbing up the rigging to\nfasten a rope around his waist and lower him.\n\nThere _was_ one other who remained aloof. That was the harpist,\nGrazoot. He was still sulking at the foot of the mast.\n\nGreen decided that he'd better keep an eye on him, especially at night\nwhen a knife could be slipped between a sleeper's ribs and the body\nthrown overboard. He wished now that he'd not gone out of his way to\ninsult the fellow's instrument, but at the time that had seemed the\nonly thing to do. Now he had better try to find some way to pacify him.\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nTwo weeks of very hard work and little sleep passed as Green learned\nthe duties of a topsailman. He hated to go aloft, but he found that\nbeing up so high had its advantages. It gave him a chance to catch a\nfew winks now and then. There were many crow's nests where musketmen\nwere stationed during a fight. Green would slip down into one of these\nand go to sleep at once. His foster son Grizquetr would stand watch for\nhim, waking him if the foretop captain was coming through the rigging\ntoward them. One afternoon Griz's whistle startled Green out of a sound\nsleep.\n\nHowever, the captain stopped to give another sailor a lecture. Unable\nto go back to sleep, Green watched a herd of _hoobers_ take to their\nhoofs at the approach of the _Bird_. These diminutive equines,\nbeautiful with their orange bodies and black or white manes and\nfetlocks, sometimes formed immense herds that must have numbered in\nthe hundreds of thousands. So thick were they that they looked like a\nbobbing sea of flashing heads and gleaming hoofs stretching clear to\nthe horizon.\n\nTo stretch to the horizon was something on this planet. The plain was\nthe flattest Green had ever seen. He could scarcely believe that it ran\nunbroken for thousands of miles. But it did, and from his high point of\nview he could see in a vast circle. It was a beautiful sight. The grass\nitself was tall and thick-bodied, about two feet high and a sixteenth\nof an inch through. It was a bright green, brighter than earthly grass,\nalmost shiny. During the rainy season, he was told, it would blossom\nwith many tiny white and red flowers and give a pleasing perfume.\n\nNow, as Green watched, something happened that startled him.\n\nAbruptly, as if a monster mowing machine had come along the day before,\nthe high grass ended and a lawn began. The new grass seemed to be only\nan inch high. And the lawn stretched at least a mile wide and as far\nahead of the _Bird_ as he could see.\n\n\"What do you think of that?\" he asked Amra's son.\n\nGrizquetr shrugged. \"I don't know. The sailors say that it is done by\nthe _wuru_, an animal the size of a ship, that only comes out at night.\nIt eats grass, but it has the nasty temper of a dire dog, and will\nattack and smash a 'roller as if it were made of cardboard.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that?\" Green said, watching him closely. Grizquetr was\nan intelligent lad in whom he hoped to plant a few seeds of skepticism.\nPerhaps some day those seeds might flower into the beginnings of\nscience.\n\n\"I do not know if the story is true or not. It is possible, but I've\nmet nobody who has ever seen a _wuru_. And if it comes out only at\nnight, where does it hide during the daytime? There is no hole in the\nground large enough to conceal it.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Green, smiling. Happily, Grizquetr smiled back.\nHe worshiped his foster-father and nursed every bit of affection or\ncompliment he got from him.\n\n\"Keep that open mind,\" said Green. \"Neither believe nor disbelieve\nuntil you have solid evidence one way or another. And keep on\nremembering that new evidence may come up that will disprove the old\nand firmly established.\"\n\nHe smiled wryly. \"I could use some of my own advice. I, for instance,\nhad at one time absolutely refused to put any credence in what I have\njust seen with my own eyes. I put the story down as merely another idle\nstory of those who sail the grassy seas. But I'm beginning to wonder if\nperhaps there couldn't be an animal of some kind like the _wuru_.\"\n\nBoth were silent for a while as they watched the animals race off like\nliving orange rivers. Overhead, the birds wheeled in their hundreds of\nthousands of numbers. They, too, were beautiful, and even more colorful\nthan the _hoobers_. Occasionally one lit in the rigging in a burst of\ndazzling feathers and a fury of melodious song or raucous screeches.\n\n\"Look!\" said the boy, eagerly pointing. \"A grass cat! He's been hiding,\nwaiting to catch a _hoober_, and now he's afraid he'll be trampled to\ndeath by them.\"\n\nGreen's gaze followed the other's finger. He saw the long-legged,\ntiger-striped body loping desperately ahead of the thundering hoofs.\nIt was completely closed in a pocket of the orange-maned beasts. Even\nas Green saw him, the sides of the pocket collapsed and the big cat\ndisappeared from sight. If he remained alive he would do so through a\nmiracle.\n\nSuddenly, Grizquetr cried, \"Gods!\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" cried Green.\n\n\"On the horizon! A sail! It's shaped like a Ving sail!\"\n\nOthers saw it too. The ship rang with shouts. A trumpeter blew battle\nstations; Miran's voice rose above those of others as he bellowed\nthrough a megaphone; chaos dissolved into order and purpose as\neverybody went to his appointed place. The animals, children and\npregnant women were marshaled into the hold. The gun crews began\nunloading barrels of powder with a crane from a hatch. Musketmen\nswarmed up the rigging. The entire topmast crew tumbled aloft and\ntook their places. As Green was already in his, he had some leisure to\nobserve the whole outlay of preparations for fight. He watched Amra\nhurriedly give her children a kiss, make sure they'd all gone below,\nthen begin tearing strips of cloth for bandages and of wadding for the\nmuskets. Once she looked up and waved at him before turning back to her\ntask. He waved back and got a severe reprimand from the top-captain for\nbreaking discipline.\n\n\"An extra watch for you, Green, after this is over!\"\n\nThe Earthman groaned and wished that the martinet would fall off and\nbreak every bone in his body. If he lost any more sleep...!\n\nThe day wore on as the strange ship came closer. Another sail appeared\nbehind it, and the crew grew even tenser. From all appearances, they\nwere being pursued by Vings. Vings usually went in pairs. Then there\nwas the shape of the sails, which were narrower at bottom than at top.\nAnd there was the long, low, streamlined hull and the over-large wheels.\n\nNevertheless discipline was somewhat relaxed for a time. The pets and\nchildren were allowed to come up, and meals were prepared by the women.\nEven when the swifter craft came close enough so that the color of\nthe sails was seen to be scarlet, thereby confirming their suspicions\nof the strangers' identity, battle stations weren't recalled. Miran\nestimated that by the time the Vings were within cannon range night\nwould fall.\n\n\"That is what they hate and what we love,\" he said, pacing back and\nforth, fingering his nose ring and blinking nervously his one good\neye. \"It'll be an hour before the big moon comes up. Not only that, it\nlooks as though clouds may arise. See!\" he cried to the first mate. \"By\nMennirox, is that not a wisp I detect in the northeast quarter?\"\n\n\"By all the gods, I believe it is!\" said the mate, peering upward,\nseeing nothing but clear sky, but hoping that wishing would make the\nclouds come true.\n\n\"Ah, Mennirox is good to his favorite worshiper!\" said Miran. \"_He that\nloves thee shall profit_, Book of the True Gods, Chapter Ten, Verse\nEight. And Mennirox knows I love him with compound interest!\"\n\n\"Yes, that he does,\" said the mate. \"But what is your plan?\"\n\n\"As soon as the last glow of the sun disappears completely from the\nhorizon, so our silhouette won't be revealed, we'll swing and cut\nacross their direct path of advance. We know that they'll be traveling\nfairly close together, hoping to catch up with us and blast us with\ncross-fire. Well, we'll give them a chance, but we'll be gone before\nthey can seize it. We'll go right between them in the dark and fire on\nboth. By the time they're ready to reply we'll have slipped on by.\n\n\"And then,\" he whooped, slapping his fat thigh, \"they'll probably\ncannonade each other to flinders, each thinking the other is us! Hoo,\nhoo, hoo!\"\n\n\"Mennirox had better be with us,\" said the mate, paling. \"It'll take\ndamn tight calculating and more than a bit of luck. We'll be going by\ndead reckoning; not until we're almost on them will we see them; and if\nwe're headed straight at them it'll be too late to avoid a collision.\nWharoom! Smash! Boom! We're done for!\"\n\n\"That's very true, but we're done for if we don't pull some trick like\nthat. They'll have caught us by dawn--they can outmaneuver us--and\nthey've more combined gunfire. And though we'll fight like grass cats\nwe'll go down, and you know what'll happen then. The Vings don't take\nprisoners unless they're at the end of a cruise and going into port.\"\n\n\"We should have accepted the Duke's offer of a convoy of frigates,\"\nmuttered the mate. \"Even one would have been enough to make the odds\nfavor us.\"\n\n\"What? And lose half the profits of this voyage because we have to pay\nthat robber Duke for the use of his warships? Have you lost your mind,\nmate?\"\n\n\"If I have I'm not the only one,\" said the mate, turning into the wind\nso his words were lost. But the helmsmen heard him and reported the\nconversation later. In five minutes it was all over the ship.\n\n\"Sure, he's Greedyguts himself,\" the crew said. \"But then, we're his\nrelatives; we know the value of a penny. And isn't the fat old darling\nthe daring one, though? Who but a captain of the Clan Effenycan would\nthink of such a trick, and carry it through, too? And if he's such a\nmoney-grabber, why, then; wouldn't he be afraid to risk his vessel and\ncargo, not to mention his own precious blood, not to mention the even\nmore precious blood of his relatives? No, Miran may be one-eyed and\nbig-bellied and short of temper and wind, but he's the man to hold down\nthe foredeck. Brother, dip me another glass from that barrel and let's\ntoast again the cool courage and hot avariciousness of Captain Miran,\nMaster Merchant.\"\n\nGrazoot, the plump little harpist with the effeminate manners, took his\nharp and began singing the song the Clan loved most, the story of how\nthey, a hill tribe, had come down to the plains a generation ago. And\nhow there they had crept into the windbreak of the city of Chutlzaj\nand stolen a great windroller. And how they had ever since been men\nof the grassy seas, of the vast flat Xurdimur, and had sailed their\nstolen craft until it was destroyed in a great battle with a whole\nKrinkansprunger fleet. And how they had boarded a ship of the fleet and\nslain all the men and taken the women prisoners and sailed off with\nthe ship right through the astounded fleet. And how they had taken the\nwomen as slaves and bred children and how the Effenycan blood was now\nhalf Krinkansprunger and that was where they got their blue eyes. And\nhow the Clan now owned three big merchant ships--or had until two years\nago when the other two rolled over the green horizon during the Month\nof the Oak and were never heard of again, but they'd come back some day\nwith strange tales and a hold brimming with jewels. And how the Clan\nnow sailed under that mighty, grasping, shrewd, lucky, religious man,\nMiran.\n\nWhatever else you could say about Grazoot, you could not deny that\nhe had a fine baritone. Green, listening to his voice rise from the\ndeck far below, could vision the rise and fall and rise again of these\npeople and could appreciate why they were so arrogant and close-fisted\nand suspicious and brave. Indeed, if he had been born on this planet,\nhe could have wanted no finer, more romantic, gypsyish life than that\nof a sailor on a windroller. Provided, that is, that he could get\nplenty of sleep.\n\nThe boom of a cannon disturbed his reverie. He looked up just in time\nto see the ball appear at the end of its arc and flash by him. It was\nnot enough to scare him, but watching it plow into the ground about\ntwenty feet away from the starboard steering wheel made him realize\nwhat damage one lucky shot could do.\n\nHowever, the Ving did not try again. He was a canny pirate who knew\nbetter than to throw away ammunition. Doubtless he was hoping to panic\nthe merchantman into a frenzy of replies, powder-wasting and useless.\nUseless because the sun set just then and in a few minutes dusk was\ngone and darkness was all around them. Miran didn't even bother to\ntell his men to hold their fire, since they wouldn't have dreamed of\ntouching off the cannon until he gave the word. Instead he repeated\nthat no light should be shown and that the children must go below decks\nand must be kept quiet. No one was to make a noise.\n\nThen, casting one last glance at the positions of the pursuing craft,\nnow rapidly dissolving into the night, he estimated the direction and\nstrength of the wind. It was as it had been the day they set sail, an\neast wind dead astern, a good wind, pushing them along at eighteen\nmiles an hour.\n\nMiran spoke in a soft voice to the first mate and the other officers,\nand they disappeared into the darkness shrouding the decks. They were\ngiving prearranged orders, not by the customary bellowing through a\nmegaphone but by low voices and touches. While they directed the crew,\nMiran stood with bare feet upon the foredeck. He held a half-crouching\nposture, and acted as if he were detecting the moves of the invisible\nsailors by the vibrations of their activities running through the wood\nof the decks and the spars and the masts and up to his feet. Miran was\na fat nerve center that gathered in all the unspoken messages scattered\neverywhere through the body of the _Bird_. He seemed to know exactly\nwhat he was doing, and if he hesitated or doubted because of the solid\nblackness around him, he gave the helmsmen no sign. His voice was firm.\n\n\"Hold it steady.\"\n\n\"... six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Now! Swing her hard aport! Hold her,\nhold her!\"\n\nTo Green, high up on the topmost spar of the foremast, the turning\nabout seemed an awful and unnatural deed. He could _feel_ the hull, and\nwith it his mast, of course, leaning over and over, until his senses\ntold him that they must inevitably capsize and send him crashing to\nthe ground. But his senses lied, for though he seemed to fall forever,\nthe time came when the journey back toward an upright position began.\nThen he was sure he would keep falling the other way, forever.\n\nSuddenly the sails fluttered. The vessel had come into the dead spot\nwhere there was no wind acting upon her canvas. Then, as her original\nimpetus kept her going, the canvas boomed, seeming to his straining and\noversensitive ears like cannon firing. This time the wind was catching\nher from what was for her a completely unnatural direction, from dead\nahead. As a result, the sails filled out backwards, and their middle\nportions pressed against the masts.\n\nThe 'roller came almost to a stop at once. The rigging groaned, and\nthe masts themselves creaked loudly. Then they were bending backwards,\nwhile the sailors clinging to them in the darkness swore under their\nbreaths and clamped down desperately on their handholds.\n\n\"Gods!\" said Green. \"What _is_ he doing?\"\n\n\"Quiet!\" said a nearby man, the foretop-captain. \"Miran is going to run\nher backwards.\"\n\nGreen gasped. But he made no further comment, trying to visualize what\na strange sight the _Bird of Fortune_ must be, and wishing it were\ndaylight so he could see her. He sympathized with the helmsmen, who\nhad to act against their entire training. It was a bad enough strain\nfor them to try to sail blindly between two vessels. But to roll in\nreverse! They would have to put the helm to port when their reflexes\ncried out to them to put it to starboard, and vice versa! And no doubt\nMiran was aware of this and was warning them about it every few seconds.\n\nGreen began to see what was happening. By now the _Bird_ was rolling on\nher former course, but at a reduced rate because the sails, bellying\nagainst their masts, would not offer as much surface to the wind.\nTherefore, the Ving vessels would by now be almost upon them, since the\nmerchant ship had also lost much ground in her maneuver. In one or two\nminutes the Ving would overtake them, would for a short while ride side\nby side with them, then would pass.\n\nProvided, of course, that Miran had estimated correctly his speed and\nrate of curve in turning. Otherwise they might even now expect a crash\nfrom the foredeck as the bow of the Ving caught them.\n\n\"Oh, Booxotr,\" prayed the foretop-captain. \"Steer us right, else you\nlose your most devout worshiper, Miran.\"\n\nBooxotr, Green recalled, was the God of Madness.\n\nSuddenly a hand gripped Green's shoulder. It was the captain of the\nforetop.\n\n\"Don't you see them!\" he said softly. \"They're a blacker black than the\nnight.\"\n\nGreen strained his eyes. Was it his imagination, or did he actually see\nsomething moving to his right? And another something, the hint of a\nhint, moving to his left?\n\nWhatever it was, 'roller or illusion, Miran must have seen it also.\nHis voice shattered the night into a thousand pieces, and it was never\nagain the same.\n\n\"Cannoneers, fire!\"\n\nSuddenly it was as if fireflies had been in hiding and had swarmed out\nat his command. All along the rails little lights appeared. Green was\nstartled, even though he knew that the punks had been concealed beneath\nbaskets so that the Vings would have no warning at all.\n\nThen the fireflies became long glowing worms, as the fuses took flame.\n\nThere was a great roar, and the ship rocked. Iron demons belched flame.\n\nNo sooner done than musketry broke out like a hot rash all over the\nship. Green himself was part of this, blazing away at the vessel\nmomentarily and dimly revealed by the light of the cannon fire.\n\nDarkness fell, but silence was gone. The men cheered; the decks\ntrembled as the big wooden trains holding the cannon were run back to\nthe ports from which they'd recoiled. As for the pirates, there was no\nanswering fire. Not at first They must have been taken completely by\nsurprise.\n\nMiran shouted again; again the big guns roared.\n\nGreen, reloading his musket, found that he was bracing himself against\na tendency to lean to the right. It was a few seconds before he could\ncomprehend that the _Bird_ was turning in that direction even though it\nwas still going backwards.\n\n\"Why is he doing that?\" he shouted.\n\n\"Fool, we can't roll up the sails, stop, then set sail again. We'd be\nright where we started, sailing backwards. We have to turn while we\nhave momentum, and how better to do that than reverse our maneuver?\nWe'll swing around until we're headed in our original direction.\"\n\nGreen understood now. The Vings had passed them, therefore they were in\nno danger of collision with them. And they couldn't continue sailing\nbackwards all night. The thing to do now would be to cut off at an\nangle so that at daybreak they'd be far from the pirates.\n\nAt that moment cannonfire broke out to their left. The men aboard the\n_Bird_ refrained from cheering only because of Miran's threats to\nmaroon them on the plain if they did anything to reveal their position.\nNevertheless they all bared their teeth in silent laughter. Crafty old\nMiran had sprung his best trap. As he'd hoped, the two pirates, unaware\nthat their attacker was now behind them, were shooting each other.\n\n\"Let them bang away until they blow each other sky-high,\" chortled\nthe foretop-master. \"Ah, Miran, what a tale we'll have to tell in the\ntaverns when we get to port.\"\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nFor five minutes the intermittent flashes and bellows told that the\nVings were still hammering away. Then the dark took hold again.\nApparently the two had either recognized each other or else had decided\nthat night fighting was a bad business and had steered away from each\nother. If this last was true, then they wouldn't be much to fear, for\none Ving wouldn't attack the merchant by itself.\n\nThe clouds broke, and the big and the little moons spread brightness\neverywhere. The pirate vessels were not in sight. Nor were they seen\nwhen dawn broke. There was sail half a mile away, but this alarmed no\none, except the untutored Green, because they recognized its shape as a\nsister. It was a merchant from the nearby city of Dem, of the Dukedom\nof Potzihili.\n\nGreen was glad. They could sail with it. Safety in numbers.\n\nBut no. Miran, after hailing it and finding that it also was going to\nEstorya, ordered every bit of canvas crowded on in an effort to race\naway from it.\n\n\"Is he crazy?\" groaned Green to a sailor.\n\n\"Like a _zilmar_,\" replied the sailor, referring to a foxlike animal\nthat dwelt in the hills. \"We must get to Estorya first if we would\nrealize the full value of our cargo.\"\n\n\"Utter featherbrained folly,\" snarled Green. \"That ship doesn't carry\nlive fish. It can't possibly compete with us.\"\n\n\"No, but we've other things to sell. Besides, it's in Miran's blood. If\nhe saw another merchant pass him he'd come down sick.\"\n\nGreen threw his hands into the air and rolled his eyes in despair. Then\nhe went back to work. There was much to do yet before he'd be allowed\nto sleep.\n\nThe days and nights passed in the hard routine of his labor and the\nalarms and excursions that occasionally broke up the routine. Now and\nthen the gig was launched, while the 'roller was in full speed, and\nit sped away under the power of its white fore-and-aft sail. It would\nbe loaded with hunters, who would chase a _hoober_ or deer or pygmy\nhog until it became exhausted; then would shoot the tired animal. They\nalways brought back plenty of fresh meat. As for water, the catch-tanks\non the decks were full because it rained at least half an hour at every\nnoon and dusk.\n\nGreen wondered at the regularity and promptness of these showers.\nThe clouds would appear at twelve, it would rain for thirty to sixty\nminutes, then the sky would clear again. It was all very nice, but it\nwas also very puzzling.\n\nSometimes he was allowed to try target practice from the crow's nest\non the grass cats or the huge dire dogs. These latter ran in packs of\nhalf a dozen to twenty, and would often pace the _Bird_, howling and\ngrowling and sometimes running between the wheels. The sailors had\nquite a few tales of what they did to people who fell overboard or were\nwrecked on the plains.\n\nGreen shuddered and went back to his target practice. Though he\nordinarily was against shooting animals just for the fun of it, he\nhad no compunction about putting a ball through these wolfish-looking\ncreatures. Ever since he'd been tormented by Alzo he'd hated dogs with\na passion unbecoming to a civilized man. Of course, the fact that every\ncanine on the planet instinctively loathed him because of his Earthman\nodor and did his best to sink his teeth into him, strengthened Green's\nreaction. His legs were always healing from bites of the pets aboard.\n\nOften the 'roller would cruise through grass tall as a man's knee. Then\nsuddenly it would pass onto one of those tremendous lawns which seemed\nso well kept. Green had never ceased puzzling about them, but all he\ncould get from anyone was one or more variations of the fable of the\n_wuru_, the herbivore bigger than two ships put together.\n\nOne day they passed a wreck. Its burned hulk lay sideways on the\nground, and here and there bones gleamed in the sun. Green expressed\nsurprise that the masts, wheels and cannon were gone. He was told that\nthose had been taken away by the savages who roamed the plains.\n\n\"They use the wheels for their own craft, which are really nothing but\nlarge sailing platforms, land-rafts, you might say,\" Amra told him. \"On\nthese they pitch their tents and their fireplaces, and from them they\ngo forth to hunt. Some of them, however, disdain platforms and make\ntheir homes upon the 'roaming islands.'\"\n\nGreen smiled but said nothing about that fairy story because disbelief\nexcited these people, even Amra.\n\n\"You'll not see many wrecks,\" she continued. \"Not because there aren't\nmany, for there are. Out of every ten 'rollers that leave for distant\nbreaks, you can expect only six to get back.\"\n\n\"That few? I'm amazed that with such a casualty ratio you could get\nanybody to risk his fortune and life.\"\n\n\"You forget that he who comes back is many times richer than when he\nsailed away. Look at Miran. He is taxed heavily at every port of call.\nHe is taxed even more heavily in his home port. And he has to split\nwith the Clansmen, though he does get a tenth of the profit of every\ncargo. Despite this, he is the richest man in Quotz, richer even than\nthe Duke.\"\n\n\"Yes, but a man is a fool to take risks like these just for the\nremote chance of a fortune,\" he protested. Then he stopped. After all,\nfor what other reason had the Norsemen gone to America, and Columbus\nto the West Indies? Or why were so many hundreds of thousands of\nEarthmen daring the perils of interstellar space? What about himself,\nfor instance? He'd left a stable and well-paying job on Earth as a\nspecialist in raising sea crops to go to Pushover, a planet of Albireo.\nHe'd expected to make his fortune there after two years of not-too-hard\nwork and then retire. If only that accident hadn't happened...!\n\nOf course, some of the pioneers weren't driven by the profit motive.\nThere was such a thing as love of adventure. Not a pure love, however.\nEven the most adventurous saw Eldorado gleaming somewhere in the wilds.\nGreed conquered more frontiers than curiosity.\n\n\"You'd think the ruins of 'rollers would not be rare, even if these\nplains are vast,\" said Amra, breaking in on his reflections. \"But the\nsavages and pirates must salvage them as fast as they're made.\"\n\n\"Your pardon, Mother, for interrupting,\" said Grizquetr. \"I heard\na sailor, Zoob, remark on that very thing just the other day. He\nsaid that he once saw a 'roller that had been gutted, by pirates, he\nsupposed. It was three days' journey out of Yeshkayavach, the city of\nquartz in the far North. He said their 'roller was a week there, then\nreturned on the same route. But when they came to where the wreck had\nbeen it was gone, every bit of it. Even the bones of the dead sailors\nwere missing.\"\n\n\"And he said that that reminded him of a story his father had told\nhim when he was young. He said his father told him that his ship had\nonce almost run into a huge uncharted hole in the plain. It was big,\nat least two hundred feet across, and earth had been piled up outside,\nlike the crater of a volcano. At first that was what they thought it\nwas, a volcano just beginning, even though they'd never heard of such a\nthing on the Xurdimur. Then they met a ship whose men had seen the hole\nmade. It was caused, they said by a mighty falling star....\"\n\n\"A meteor,\" commented Green.\n\n\"... and it had dug that great hole. Well, that was as good an\nexplanation as any. But the amazing thing was that when they came by\nthat very spot a month later, the hole was gone. It was filled up\nand smoothed out, and grass was growing over it as if nothing had\never broken the skin of the earth. Now, how do you explain that,\nFoster-father?\"\n\n\"There are more things in heaven and earth than ever your philosophies\ndreamed of, Horatio,\" Green nonchalantly replied, though he felt as\nthough he wasn't quoting exactly right.\n\nAmra and her son blinked. \"Horatio?\"\n\n\"Never mind.\"\n\n\"This sailor said that it was probably the work of the gods, who labor\nsecretly at night that the plain may stay flat and clean of obstacles\nso their true worshipers may sail upon it and profit thereby.\"\n\n\"Will the wonders of rationalization never cease?\" said Green.\n\nHe rose from his pile of furs. \"Almost time for my watch.\" He kissed\nAmra, the maid, the children, and stepped out from the tent. He walked\nrather carelessly across the deck absorbed in wondering what the effect\nwould be upon Amra if he told her his true origin. Could she comprehend\nthe concept of other worlds existing by the hundreds of thousands, yet\nso distant from each other that a man could walk steadily for a million\nyears and still not get halfway from Earth to this planet of hers? Or\nwould she react automatically, as most of her fellows would do, and\nthink that he must surely be a demon in human disguise? It would be\nmore natural for her to prefer the latter idea. If you looked at it\nobjectively, it _was_ more plausible, given her lack of scientific\nknowledge. Much more believable, too.\n\nSomebody bumped him. Jarred out of his reverie, he automatically\napologized in English.\n\n\"Don't curse at me in your foreign tongue!\" snarled Grazoot, the plump\nlittle harpist.\n\nEzkr was standing behind Grazoot. He spoke out of the side of his\nmouth, urging the bard on. \"He thinks he can walk all over you,\nGrazoot, because he insulted your harp once and you let him get away\nwith it.\"\n\nGrazoot puffed out his cheeks, reddened in the face and glared. \"It\nis only because Miran has forbidden duels that I have not plunged my\ndagger into this son of an _izzot_!\"\n\nGreen looked from one to the other. Obviously this scene was\nprearranged with no good end for him in view.\n\n\"Stand aside,\" he said haughtily. \"You are interfering with the\ndiscipline of the 'roller. Miran will not like that.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Grazoot. \"Do you think Miran cares at all about what\nhappens to you? You're a lousy sailor and it hurts me to have to call\nyou brother. In fact, I spit every time I say it to you, brother!\"\n\nGrazoot did just that. Green, who was downwind, felt the fine mist wet\nhis legs. He began to get angry.\n\n\"Out of my way or I'll report you to the first mate,\" he said firmly\nand walked by them. They gave way, but he had an uneasy feeling in\nthe small of his back, as if a knife would plunge into it. Of course,\nthey shouldn't be so foolish, because they would be hamstrung and then\ndropped off the 'roller for the crime of cowardice. But these people\nwere so hot-headed they were just as likely as not to stab him in a\nmoment of fury.\n\nOnce on the rope ladder that ran up to the crow's nest, he began to\nlose the prickly feeling in his back. At that moment Grazoot called\nout, \"Oh, Green, I had a vision last night, a true vision, because my\npatron god sent it, and he himself appeared in it. He announced that he\nwould snuff up his nostrils the welcome scent of your blood, spilled\nall over the deck from your fall!\"\n\nGreen paused with one foot on the rail. \"You tell your god to stay away\nfrom me, or I'll punch him in the nose!\" he called back.\n\nThere was a gasp from the many people who'd gathered around to listen.\n\"Sacrilege!\" yelled Grazoot. \"Blasphemy!\" He turned to those around\nhim. \"Did you hear that?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ezkr, stepping out from the crowd. \"I heard him and I am\nshocked. Men have burned for less.\"\n\n\"Oh, my patron god, Tonuscala, punish this pride-swollen man! Make your\ndreams come true. Cast him headlong from the mast and dash him to the\ndeck and break every bone in his body so that men may learn that one\ndoes not mock the true gods.\"\n\n\"_Tahkhai_,\" murmured the crowd. \"Amen.\"\n\nGreen smiled grimly. He had fallen into their trap and now must be on\nguard. Plainly, one or both of them would be aloft tonight during the\ndark hour after sunset, and they'd be content with nothing less than\npitching him out over the deck. His death would be considered to have\ncome from the hands of an outraged god. And if Amra should accuse Ezkr\nand Grazoot she'd get little justice. As for Miran, the fellow would\nprobably heave a sigh of relief, because he'd be rid of a troublesome\nfellow who could carry damaging stories of a certain conspiracy to the\nDuke of Tropat.\n\nHe climbed up to the crow's nest, and settled gloomily to staring off\nat the horizon. Just before sunset Grizquetr came up with a bottle of\nwine and food in a covered basket.\n\nBetween bites Green told the boy of his suspicions.\n\n\"Mother has already guessed as much,\" said the lad. \"She is a very\nclever woman indeed, my mother. She has put a curse upon the two if you\nshould come to harm.\"\n\n\"Very clever. That will do a great deal of good. Thank her for her\nsplendid work while you're picking up my pieces from the deck, will\nyou?\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" replied Grizquetr, trying hard to keep his sober face\nfrom breaking into a grin. \"And Mother also sent you this.\"\n\nHe rolled the kerchief all the way off the top of the basket. Green's\neyes widened.\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\"A rocket flare!\"\n\n\"Yes. Mother says that you are to release it when you hear the bos'n's\nwhistle from the deck.\"\n\n\"Now, why in the world would I do that? Won't I get into tremendous\ntrouble by doing that? I'll be run through the gauntlet a dozen times\nfor that. No sir, not me. I've seen those poor fellows after the whips\nwere through with them.\"\n\n\"Mother said for me to tell you that nobody will be able to prove who\nsent up the flare.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. It sounds reasonable. But why should I do it?\"\n\n\"It will light up the whole ship for a minute, and everybody will be\nable to see that Ezkr and Grazoot are in the rigging. The whole ship\nwill be in an uproar. Of course, when it is discovered that somebody\nhas stolen two flares from the store-room, and when a search is\nconducted, and one flare is found hidden in Ezkr's trunk, then ...\nwell, you see....\"\n\n\"Oh, beamish boy!\" chortled Green. \"Calloo, callay! Go tell your mother\nshe's the most marvelous woman on this planet--though that's really not\nmuch of a compliment, now I think of it. Oh, wait a minute! About this\nbos'n's whistle. Now, why should he be warning me to send up a flare?\"\n\n\"He won't. Mother will be blowing it. She'll be waiting for a signal\nfrom me or Azaxu,\" Grizquetr said, referring to his younger brother.\n\"We'll be watching Ezkr and Grazoot, and when they start to climb aloft\nwe'll notify her. She'll wait until she thinks they're about halfway\nup, then she'll whistle.\"\n\n\"That woman has saved my life at least half a dozen times. What would I\ndo without her?\"\n\n\"That's what Mother said. She said that she doesn't know why she went\nafter you when you tried to run away from her--from us--because she has\ngreat pride. And she doesn't have to chase a man to get one; princes\nhave begged her to come live with them. But she did because she loves\nyou, and a good thing, too. Otherwise your stupidity would have killed\nyou ten times over by now.\"\n\n\"Oh, she did, did she? Well, hah, hum. Yes, well...!\"\n\nThoroughly ashamed of himself, yet angry at Amra for her estimate of\nhim, Green miserably watched Grizquetr climb down the ratlines.\n\nDuring the next half-hour, time seemed to coagulate, to thicken and\nharden around him so that he felt as if he were encased in it. The\nclouds that always came up after sunset formed, and a light drizzle\nbegan. It would last for about an hour, he knew, then the clouds would\ndisappear so swiftly that they would give the impression of being\nyanked away like a tablecloth by some magician over the horizon. But\nhe'd cram a highly nervous lifetime into those minutes, wondering\nif perhaps there wouldn't be some unforeseen frustration of Amra's\nschedule.\n\nThe first webby drops struck his face, and he wondered if perhaps that\nwouldn't be what the two would wait for. They'd probably taken the\nfirst step up the rigging, but he mustn't expect her whistle for some\ntime yet. If they were clever they wouldn't climb up directly beneath\nhim, but would go aft, ascend to the top, then climb over to him. It\nwas true that they'd have to pass others who, like Green, were also\nstationed aloft on watch. But Ezkr and Grazoot knew the locations of\nthese. So dark was it they could pass within touching distance and not\nbe seen or heard. The wind in the rigging, the creak of masts, the\nrumble of the great wheels would drown out any slight noise they might\nmake.\n\nThe 'roller did not stop sailing just because the helmsmen could not\nsee. The _Bird_ followed a well-charted route; every permanent obstacle\nalong here had been memorized by helmsmen and officers alike. If\nanything formidable was expected in their path during the dark period,\na course would be set to avoid it. The officers on duty would advise\nthe helmsmen on their steering by means of an ingenious dial on a\nnotched plate. His sensitive fingers, following its flickerings back\nand forth, and comparing them with the directional notches, would tell\nhim how close to the course they were keeping. The dial itself was\nfixed to the needle of a compass beneath it.\n\nGreen hunched his shoulders beneath his coat and walked around the\nwalls of his nest. He strained his eyes to make out something in the\nblackness that wrapped him around like a shroud. There was nothing,\nnothing at all.... No, wait! What was that? A vague outline of a white\nface?\n\nHe stared hard until it disappeared, then he sighed and realized how\nrigidly he'd been standing there. And of course he'd been open to\nattack from behind all that time.\n\nNo, not really. If he couldn't see an arm's length away, neither could\nthe other two.\n\nBut they didn't have to see. They knew the ropes so well that they\ncould grope blindfolded to his nest and there feel him out. A touch of\na finger, followed by a thrust of steel. That would be all it would\ntake.\n\nHe was thinking of that when he felt the finger. It poked into his back\nand held him like a statue for just a second, quivering, paralyzed.\nThen he gave a hoarse cry and jumped away. He snatched out his dagger\nand crouched down close to the floor, straining his eyes and ears,\ntrying to detect them. Surely, if they were breathing as hard as he, he\ncouldn't fail to hear them.\n\nOn the other hand, he realized with a sudden sickishness, they could\nhear him just as well.\n\n\"Come on! Come on!\" he said soundlessly, through clenched teeth. \"Do\nsomething! Make a move so I can pin you, you sons of _izzots_!\"\n\nPerhaps they were doing the same, waiting for him to betray himself.\nThe best thing was to hug the floor where he was and hope they'd\nstumble over him.\n\nHe kept reaching out in front of him, feeling for the warm flesh of a\nface. His other hand held his dagger.\n\nIt was during one of his tentative explorations that he felt the basket\nwhere Grizquetr had left it. At once, seized with what he thought was\nan inspiration, he pulled out the flare. Why wait for them to close in\non him and butcher him like a hog? He'd send up the flare now, and in\nthe first shock of its glare he'd attack them.\n\nThe only trouble was, he'd have to put down his dagger in order to take\nhis flint and steel and tinderbox from his pocket. He hated not to have\nit ready for thrusting.\n\nSolving this problem by putting the dagger between his teeth, he took\nout his firebox, paused, and swiftly put them back. Now, how was he\nsupposed to get the tinder going when it was drizzling? That was one\nthing Amra, with all her cleverness, hadn't thought of.\n\n\"Fool!\" he whispered to himself. \"I'm the fool!\" And in the next\nmoment, he was removing his coat and putting the flint and steel and\nbox under its protecting cover. He couldn't see what he was doing, but\nif he held the tinder close enough a spark should fall on it. Then he'd\nhave a flame hot enough to touch off the fuse of the flare.\n\nAgain, he froze. His enemies were waiting for him to reveal himself\nthrough noise. What better giveaway than flint scraping against steel?\nAnd what about the sound of the rocket flare's spiked support being\ndriven into the wooden floor?\n\nHe suppressed a groan. No matter what he did he was leaving himself\nwide open.\n\nIt was then that the shrillness of a whistle below startled him. He\nrose, wondering frenziedly what he should do next. So convinced was he\nthat Ezkr and Grazoot were poised just outside the nest, he could not\nbelieve that Amra had not misjudged the time it had taken them to climb\nto him or that she had not been held up for some reason and now was\nfrantically trying to warn him.\n\nBut, he realized, he couldn't just stand there like a scared sheep.\nWhether Amra was right or not, whether they were within dagger's thrust\nor not, he had to take action.\n\n\"Do your damndest!\" he growled at whatever might be in the dark, and he\nstruck steel against flint. The materials were under his coat, blocking\nhis view, but he lay down again so he could see between his arms and\nunder the coat held over them. The tinder caught at once and blazed\nup, then began a small but steady glow in the harder wood of the box.\nWithout waiting to look around, Green rammed the flare's spike into\nthe deck of the nest. Swiftly he brought the punk up, still holding\nthe coat over it for protection from the drizzle and also from any\nwatching eyes. He held it against the fuse, saw the cord catch flame\nand sizzle like a frying worm. Then he had ducked around the other side\nof the mast that supported the nest, for he knew how unpredictable\nthese primitive rockets were. Like as not it would go off in his face.\nHardly had he rounded the big pillar of the mast when he heard a soft\nwhooshing sound. He looked up just in time to see the rocket explode in\na white glare. The moment it dispelled the darkness he jerked his head\nto the right and the left in an effort to see if Ezkr and Grazoot were\non him, as he'd _known_ they must be.\n\nBut they weren't. They were still half a ship's length away from him,\ncaught by the light in the rigging, like flies in a spider's web. What\nhe had thought was a finger poking him in the back must have been the\nbolt that held the support for the muskets which were to be fired from\nthe nest during combat.\n\nSo relieved was he, he would have broken into loud laughter, but at\nthat moment a great cry broke from the decks below. The mate and the\nhelmsmen were shouting in alarm.\n\nGreen looked down, saw them pointing, and his gaze followed the\ndirection of their extended fingers.\n\nA hundred yards ahead, rushing at them on a collision course, was a\ntowering clump of trees!\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nThen the flare had died and had left nothing but its after-image on the\neye--and panic on the brain.\n\nGreen did not know what to make of it. In the first instant he had\nthought that it was the 'roller alone that was speeding toward an\nuncharted forest-grown hill. Immediately after, he'd seen that his\nsenses were deceiving him and that the mass was also moving. It had\nlooked like a hill, or several hills, sliding across the grass toward\nthem. But even as the darkness came back he'd seen that there were\nother hills behind it, and that the whole thing was actually a sort of\niceberg of rocks and of soil from which grew trees.\n\nThat was all he could make out in that confusing moment. Even then he\ncouldn't believe it, because a mountain just didn't run along of its\nown volition on flat land.\n\nCredible or not, it was not being ignored by the helmsmen. They must\nhave turned the wheel almost at once, for Green could feel the leaning\nof the mast to port and the shift of wind upon his face. The _Bird_ was\nswinging to the southwest in an effort to avoid the \"roaming island.\"\nUnfortunately it was too dark for the men to have worked swiftly in\ntrimming the sails even if a full crew had been aloft. And there were\nfar too few on the top, as it was not thought necessary to have them on\nduty when the 'roller was running in the post-sunset drizzle.\n\nGreen had time for one short prayer--no nonsense about punching a god\nin the nose, now--and then he was hurled against the wall of the nest.\nThere was the loudest noise he'd ever heard--the loudest because it was\nthe crack of doom for him. Rope split like a giant's whip cracking;\nspars, suddenly released from the rigging, strummed like monster\nviolins; the masts, falling down, thundered; intermingled with all\nthat were the screams of the people below on the deck and in the holds.\nGreen himself was screaming as he felt the foremast lean over, and\nhe slid from the floor of the nest, which had suddenly threatened to\nbecome a wall, and fought to hold himself on the wall, which had now\nbecome a floor. His fingers closed upon the musket-support with the\ndesperation of one who clings to the only solid thing in the world.\n\nFor a minute, the mast stopped its forward movement, held taut by the\ntangled mass of ropes. Green hoped that he was safe, that all the\ndamage had been done.\n\nBut no, even as he dared think he might come out alive, the mighty\ngrinding noise began again. The island of rock and trees was continuing\nits course and was smashing the hull of the ship beneath it, gobbling\nup wheels, axles, keel, timber, cargo, cannon and people.\n\nThe next he knew, he was flying through the air, torn from his hold,\ncatapulted far away from the 'roller. It seemed as if he actually\nsoared, gained altitude, though this must have been an illusion. Then\nthe hard return to earth, the impact on his face, his body, his legs.\nThe outstretched arms to soften the blow that must surely splinter\nhis bones and pulp his flesh. The pitiful arms, the last warding-off\ngesture before annihilation. The series of hard blows, like many fists.\nThe sudden realization that he was among tree branches and that his\nfall was being broken by them. His trying to grab one to hang on and\nits slipping away and his continued rapid and punishing descent.\n\nThen, oblivion.\n\nHe didn't know how long he'd been unconscious, but when he sat up he\nsaw through the trunks of the trees the shattered hull of the _Bird_\nabout a hundred feet away. It was lying on its side on a lower level\nthan he was, so he supposed that he was sitting on the slope of a\nhill. Only half of the craft was in sight; it must have been broken in\ntwo, and most of the middeck and stern ground into rubble beneath the\nadvancing juggernaut of the island.\n\nDully, he realized that the drizzle had stopped, the clouds had cleared\nand the big and little moons were up. The seeing was good, too good.\n\nThere were people left alive in the wreck, men, women and children who\nwere trying to climb through the tangle of ropes, spars and broken,\njagged, projecting planks. Screams, moans, shouts and calls for help\nmade a chaos.\n\nGroaning, he managed to rise to his feet. He had a very painful\nheadache. One eye was so swollen he couldn't see with it. He tasted\nblood in his mouth and felt several broken teeth with his lacerated\ntongue. His sides hurt when he breathed. The skin seemed to have\nbeen torn off the palms of his hands. His right knee must have been\nwrenched, and his left heel was a ball of fire. Nevertheless he got up.\nAmra and Paxi and her other children were in there; that is, unless\nthey'd been caught in the other half. He had to find out. Even if they\nwere beyond his help there were others who weren't.\n\nHe started to hobble through the trees. Then he saw a man step out from\nbehind a bush. Thinking that he must be a survivor who had wandered off\nin a dazed condition, Green opened his mouth to speak to him. But there\nwas something odd about him that imposed silence. He looked closer.\nYes, the fellow wore a headdress of feathers and held a long spear in\nhis hand. And the moonlight, where it slipped through the branches and\nshone upon an exposed shoulder, gleamed red, white, blue-black, yellow\nand green. The man was painted all over with stripes of different\ncolors!\n\nGreen slowly sank down upon his hands and knees behind a bush. It was\nthen that he became aware of others who stood behind trees and watched\nthe wreck. Then these emerged from the darkness under the branches.\nPresently, at least fifty plumed, painted, armed men were gathered\ntogether, all silent, all intently inspecting the wreck and the\nsurvivors.\n\nOne raised a spear as a signal and gave a loud, whooping war cry. The\nothers echoed him, and when he ran out from beneath the branches they\nfollowed him.\n\nGreen could watch only for a minute before he had to close his eyes.\n\n\"No, no!\" he moaned. \"The children, too!\"\n\nWhen he forced himself to look again, he saw that he had been mistaken\nin thinking that everybody had been put to spear. After the first\nvicious onslaught, in which they'd killed indiscriminately and\nhysterically, like all undisciplined primitives, they'd spared the\nyounger women and the little girls. Those able to walk were lined up\nand marched off under the guard of half a dozen spearsmen. The too\nbadly injured were run through on the spot.\n\nEven in the midst of this scene, Green felt some of his intense anguish\neased a little. Amra was still alive!\n\nShe held Paxi in one arm and with the other pulled Soon, her daughter\nby the temple sculptor. Though she must have been terribly frightened,\nshe faced her captors with the same proud bearing she'd always had,\nwhether in the presence of peasant or prince. Inzax, her maid, stood\nbehind her.\n\nGreen decided that he'd better try to follow her and her captors at a\ndiscreet distance. But before he could get away he saw the women and\nolder children of the savages appear, bearing torches. Fortunately none\ncame his way. Some of these mutilated the dead, dancing around the\nhacked corpses and howling in imitation of the adult men. Then began\nthe work in earnest, the carving up of the flesh. These painted people\nwere cannibals and made no bones about it. Fires were being lit for a\nmidnight snack before the bulk of the meat was brought back to wherever\ntheir homes were.\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nGreen stayed far enough behind the prisoners and savages to keep out\nof sight if any man should turn. The path was narrow, winding between\ncrowding trunks and under low branches. The soil underfoot was rich\nand springy, as if composed of generations of leaves. Green estimated\nhe must have gone at least a mile and a half, not as the crow flies,\nbut more like a drunk trying to find his way home. Then, without\nwarning, the forest stopped and a clearing was before him. In the midst\nof this stood a village of about ten log houses with thatched roofs.\nSix were rather small outhouses serving one purpose or another. The\nfour large ones were, he guessed, long houses for community living.\nThey were grouped about a central spot in which were the remains of\nseveral large fires beneath big iron pots and spits. Clay tanks were\nscattered here and there; these held rain water. Before each house was\na twenty-foot-high totem pole, brightly painted, and around it many\nslender poles holding skulls.\n\nThe prisoners were led into one of the outhouses and the door barred.\nA man stationed himself at the front, squatting with his back to the\nwall and holding a spear in one hand. The others greeted the old women\nand younger children who had been left behind. Though they spoke in a\nlanguage Green didn't understand, they were obviously describing what\nthey'd found at the wreck. Some of the old crones then began piling\nbrushwood and small logs under one of the huge iron kettles; presently\nthey had a fire blazing brightly. Others brought out glasses and cups\nof precious metals--loot from wrecks. These they filled with some sort\nof liquor, probably a native beer, judging from the foam that spilled\nover the sides. One of the young boys began idly tapping upon a drum\nand soon was beating out a monotonous simple rhythm. It looked as if\nthey were going to make a night of it.\n\nBut after a few drinks the warriors arose, picked up jugs of liquor and\nwalked into the woods, leaving one man to guard the prisoners' hut. All\nthe children over the age of four left with them, trailing along in\nthe dark, though the warriors made no effort to slow their pace so the\nchildren could keep up.\n\nGreen waited until he was sure the spearsmen were some distance away,\nthen rose. His muscles protested at any movement, and pains shot\nthrough his head, knee and ankle. But he ignored them and limped around\nthe edge of the clearing until he came to the back of one of the long\nhouses.\n\nHe slipped inside and stood by the side of the doorway. It was more\nilluminated than he'd thought at first, because of the several large\nand open windows which admitted moonbeams. Hens sleepily clucked\nat him, and one of the midget pigs grunted questioningly. Suddenly\nsomething soft brushed across his ankles. Startled, he jumped to one\nside. His heart, which had been beating fast enough before, threatened\nto hammer a hole in his ribs. He crouched, straining to see what it\nwas. Then a soft meowing nearby told him. He relaxed a little and\nstretched out a hand, saying, \"Here, kitty, kitty, come here.\"\n\nBut the cat walked by, his tail raised and a look of disdain on his\nface as he disappeared through the door. Seeing the animal reminded\nGreen of something about which he was anxious. That was whether the\nnatives kept dogs or not. He hadn't seen any and thought that surely if\nthere were some he'd have long ago heard the noisy beasts. Undoubtedly,\nby now, he should have a whole pack of the obnoxious monsters snarling\nat his heels.\n\nSilently, he walked into the long single room with its high ceiling.\nFrom thick rafters hung rolled-up curtains, which he supposed would\nbe let down to make a semi-private room for any families that wished\nit. From them also hung vegetables, fruit and meat; chickens, rabbits,\npiglets, squirrels, _hoober_ and venison. There were no human parts, so\nhe guessed that the flesh of man was not so much a staple diet to these\npeople as a food for religious purposes.\n\nAll he did know was that he would have to take some meat with him. He\ngathered strips of dried _hoober_, rolled them into a ball and stuffed\nthem in a bag. Then he took down an iron-headed spear and a sharp steel\nknife from their rack on the wall. Knife in belt and spear in hand, he\nwent out the back door.\n\nOutside, he stopped to listen to the far-off beating of drums and the\nchanting of voices. There must be quite a celebration around the wreck.\n\n\"Good,\" he muttered to himself. \"If they get drunk and pass out I'll\nhave time for what I want to do.\"\n\nStaying well within the shadows of the trees, he picked his way to the\nback of the hut in which the prisoners were. From where he stood he\ncould see that there were only six old women--about all the island's\neconomy could afford, he supposed--and some ten infants, all toddlers.\nMost of these, once the excitement caused by the noisy warriors had\nsubsided with their leavetaking, had lain down close to the fire and\ngone to sleep. The only one who might give real trouble, aside from\nthe guard, was a boy of ten, the one who was now tapping softly on the\ndrum. At first Green could not understand why he hadn't gone with the\nothers of his age to the wreck. But the empty stare and the unblinking\nway he looked into the fire showed why. Green had no doubt that if\nhe were to come close enough to the lad, he'd see that the eyeballs\nwere filmed over with white. Blindness was nothing rare on this filthy\nplanet.\n\nSatisfied as to everybody's location, he crept to the back of the hut\nand examined the walls. They were made of thick poles driven into the\nground and bound together with rope taken from a 'roller's rigging.\nThere were plenty of openings for him to look through, but it was so\ndark that he could see only the vague outlines moving about.\n\nHe put his mouth to one of the holes and said softly, \"Amra!\"\n\nSomebody gasped. A little girl began to cry but was quickly hushed up.\nAmra answered, faint with joy.\n\n\"Alan! It can't be _you_!\"\n\n\"I am not thy father's ghost!\" he replied, and wondered at the same\ntime how he could manage to inject any levity at all into the midst of\nthis desperate situation. He was always doing it. Perhaps it was not\nthe product of a true humor but more like the giggle of a person who\nwas embarrassed or under some other stress, more the result of hysteria\nthan anything else, his particular type of safety valve.\n\n\"Here's what I'm going to do,\" he said. \"Listen carefully, then repeat\nit after me so I'll know you have it down.\"\n\nShe had to hear it only once to give it back to him letter-perfect. He\nnodded. \"Good girl. I'm going now.\"\n\n\"Alan!\"\n\n\"Yes?\" he replied impatiently.\n\n\"If this doesn't work ... if anything should happen to you ... or\nme ... remember that I love you.\"\n\nHe sighed. Even in the midst of this the eternal feminine emerged.\n\n\"I love you, too. But that hasn't got much to do with this situation.\"\n\nBefore she could answer and waste more valuable time he slid away,\ncrawling on all fours around the corner of the hut. When he was where\none more pace would have brought him into view of the guard and the\nold crones, he stopped. All this while he'd been counting the seconds.\nAs soon as he'd clocked five minutes--which he thought would never\npass--he rose and stepped swiftly around the corner, spear held in\nfront of him.\n\nThe guard was drinking out of his mug with his eyes closed and his\nthroat exposed. He fell over with Green's spear plunged through his\nwindpipe, just above the breastbone. The mug fell onto his lap and\ngushed its amber and foam over his legs.\n\nGreen withdrew the blade and whirled, ready to run upon anybody who\nstarted to flee. But the old women were huddled on their knees around a\nlarge board on which they were rolling some flour, cackling and talking\nshrilly. The blind boy continued tapping, his open eyes glaring into\nthe fire. Only one saw Green, a boy of about three. Thumb in mouth,\nhe stared with great round eyes at this stranger. But he was either\ntoo horrified to utter a sound or else he did not understand what had\nhappened and was waiting to find out his elders' reactions before he\noffered his own.\n\nGreen lifted one finger to his lips in the universal sign of silence,\nthen turned and lifted up the bar over the door. Amra rushed out and\ntook the guard's spear from her husband. The dead man's knife went\nto Inzax and his other knife to Aga, a tall, muscular woman who was\ncaptain of the female deck hands and who had once killed a sailor while\ndefending her somewhat dubious honor.\n\nAt the same time, the chattering of the hags stopped. Green whirled\naround, and the silence was broken by shrieks. Frantically, the hags\ntried to scramble up from their stiffened knees and run away. But Green\nand the women were upon them before they could take more than a few\nsteps. Not one of them reached the forest. It was grim work, one in\nwhich the Effenycan woman took fierce joy.\n\nWithout wasting a look on the poor old carcasses, Green rounded up\nthe children and the blind boy and put them in the prisoners' hut. He\nhad to hold Aga back from slaughtering them. Amra, he was pleased to\nsee, had made no motion to help them in their intended butchery. She,\nunderstanding his brief look, replied, \"I could not kill a child, even\nthe spawn of these fiends. It would be like stabbing Paxi.\"\n\nGreen saw one of the women holding his daughter. He ran to her, took\nPaxi out of her arms and kissed the baby. Soon, Amra's ten-year-old\nchild by the sculptor, came shyly and stood by his side, waiting to be\nnoticed. He kissed her, too. \"You're getting to be a big girl, Soon,\"\nhe said. \"Do you suppose you could tag along behind your mother and\ncarry Paxi for her? She has to carry her spear.\"\n\nThe girl, a big-eyed, redheaded beauty, nodded and took the baby.\n\nGreen eyed the long houses with the idea of setting them afire. He\ndecided not to when it became apparent that the wind would carry sparks\nto the hut in which the savages' children were. Moreover, though a fire\nwould undoubtedly create consternation among the roisterers at the\nwreck and keep them busy for some time, it would also cause them to\nstart tracking down the refugees just that much sooner. Besides, there\nwas the possibility of setting fire to the forest, wet though it was.\nHe didn't want to destroy his only hiding-place.\n\nHe directed some women to go into the long house and load themselves\nwith as much food and weapons as they could carry. In a few minutes he\nhad the party ready to leave.\n\n\"We'll take this path that leads out of the village away from the path\nthat goes to the wreck,\" he said. \"Let's hope it goes to the other edge\nof the island, where we may find some small 'rollers on which we can\nescape. I presume these savages have some kind of sailing craft.\"\n\nThis path was as narrow and winding as the other one. It worked in the\ngeneral direction of the western shore, and the savages were on the\neastern shore.\n\nTheir way at first led upward, sometimes through passes formed by\ntwo large rocks. Several times they had to skirt little lakes, catch\nbasins for rain. Once a fish flopped out of the water, scaring them.\nThe island was fairly self-sufficient, what with its fish, rabbits,\nsquirrels, wild fowl, pigs and various vegetables and fruit. He\nestimated that if the village was in the center of the island, then the\nmass should have a surface area of about one and a half square miles.\nRough though the land was and thickly covered with grass, the place\nshould offer cover for one refugee.\n\nFor one, yes, but not for six women and eight children.\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nAfter much puffing and panting, muttered encouragements to each other,\nand occasional cursing, they finally reached the summit of the tallest\nhill. Abruptly, they found themselves facing a clearing which ran\naround its crown. Directly ahead of them was a forest of totem poles,\nall gleaming palely in the moonlight. Beyond it was the dark yawning of\na large cave.\n\nGreen walked out from the shadows of the branches to take a closer\nlook. When he came back he said, \"There's a little hut by the side of\nthe cave. I looked in the window. An old woman's asleep in it. But her\ncats are wide-awake and likely to wake her up.\"\n\n\"All those totem poles bear the heads of cats,\" said Aga. \"This place\nmust be their holy of holies. It's probably taboo to all but the old\npriestess.\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" replied Green. \"But they must hold religious services of\nsome sort here. There's a big pile of human skulls on the other side of\nthe cave mouth, and also a stake covered with bloodstains.\n\n\"We can do two things. Go on down the other side of this hill, jump off\nonto the plain and take our chances there. Or else hide inside the cave\nand hope that because it's taboo nobody will explore it to look for us.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that's the first place they'd look into,\" said Aga.\n\n\"Not if we don't wake the old woman. Then if the savages come along\nlater and ask her if anybody's come by they'll get no for an answer.\"\n\n\"What about the cats?\"\n\nGreen shrugged his shoulders. \"We'll have to take that chance. Perhaps,\nif once we get by them and into the cave, they may quiet down.\"\n\nHe was referring to their caterwauling, which was beginning to sound\ndreadful.\n\n\"No,\" said Aga, \"that noise will be a signal to the islanders. They'll\nknow something's up.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Green, \"I don't know what you intend doing, but I'm\ngoing into that cave. I'm too tired to run any further.\"\n\n\"So are we,\" affirmed the other women. \"We've reached the end of our\nstrength.\"\n\nThere was a silence, and into that silence came a voice, a man's.\n\nIt whispered, \"Please do not be startled. Be quiet. It is I....\"\n\nMiran stepped out of the shadows behind them, holding his finger to\nhis lips, his one eye round and pale in the moonlight. He was a ragged\ncaptain, not at all the elegantly uniformed commander of the _Bird of\nFortune_ and the wealthy-appearing patriarch of the Clan Effenycan. But\nhe carried in his other hand a canvas bag. Green, seeing it, knew that\nMiran had managed somehow not only to escape with his skin but had also\ncarried off a treasure in jewels.\n\n\"Behold,\" he announced, waving the bag, \"all is not lost.\"\n\nGreen thought that he was referring to the jewels. However, Miran had\nturned and beckoned to someone in the darkness behind him.\n\nOut of it slipped Grizquetr. Tears shone in his eyes as he ran to his\nmother and fell into her arms.\n\nAmra began weeping softly. Until now she had repressed her grief over\nthe children she thought forever lost to her. All thought had been\ndirected to saving her own life and the lives of the two girls who had\nsurvived with her. Now, seeing her eldest son emerge from the shadows\nas if from the grave had thawed the frozen well of sorrow.\n\nShe sobbed, \"I thank the gods that they have given me back my son.\"\n\n\"If the gods are so wonderful why did they kill your other two\nchildren?\" asked Miran sourly. \"And why did they kill my Clansmen, and\nwhy did they smash my _Bird_? Why...?\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" said Green. \"This is no time to cry about anything. We have\nto get out with whole hides. The philosophizing and tears can come\nlater.\"\n\n\"Mennirox is an ungrateful god,\" muttered Miran. \"After all I did for\nhim, too.\"\n\nAmra dried her tears and said, \"How did you escape? I thought all the\nmales who hadn't been killed in the wreck were speared?\"\n\n\"Almost everybody was,\" replied Grizquetr. \"But I crawled down into\nthe hold and slipped through to a hiding place beneath one of the fish\ntanks, which had overturned. It was wet there, and there were dead fish\nnestling beside me. The savages did not find me, though doubtless they\nwould have when they began salvaging. It was thinking about that that\ndecided me to crawl back out on the other side of the 'roller away from\nthe savages. I did so, and I found that I could belly my way through\nthe grass growing on the edge. I almost died of fright, though, because\nI crawled head on into Miran. He was hiding there, too.\"\n\n\"I was thrown off the foredeck by the impact,\" interrupted the\ncaptain. \"I should have broken every bone in my body, but I landed on\na hull sail, which had come down and was lying on the starboard side,\nsupported by the fallen mast. It was like falling into a hammock. From\nthere I dropped into the grass and snaked along the very edge of the\nisland. Several times I almost fell off, and I would have if I'd been a\npound fatter, an inch wider. As it was....\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said Grizquetr, breaking in. \"This island is the _wuru_!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Green.\n\n\"While I was clinging to the edge of the island I thought I'd hang down\nover it and see if there was any place there to hide. There wasn't,\nbecause the underside of the island is one smooth sheet. I know,\nbecause I could see in the moonlight clear to the other side. It was\nsmooth, smooth, like a slab of iron.\n\n\"And that's not all! You know how the grass on the plains hereabouts\nhas been tall, uncut? Well, the grass just ahead of the edge was uncut.\nBut the grass underneath the island was being cut off. Rather, it was\nvanishing! The top of the grass was just disappearing into air! Only a\nlawn of grass about an inch high was left!\"\n\n\"Then this island _is_ one big lawnmower,\" said Green. \"More than just\ninteresting. But we'll have to investigate that later. Right now....\"\n\nAnd he walked toward the little hut by the cave mouth. As he\napproached it several large house cats streaked out of the doorway. A\nmoment later Green came out. He grinned broadly.\n\n\"The priestess has passed out. The place smells like a brewery. The\ncats are in their cups, too. All drinking from bowls set on the ground\nfor them, staggering around, yowling, fighting. If they don't wake her\nup, nothing can.\"\n\n\"I have heard that these old priestesses are often drunkards,\" said\nAmra. \"They lead a lonely life because they're taboo, and nobody even\ngoes near them except during certain religious customs. They have only\ntheir bottle and their cats to keep them company.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Miran, \"you are thinking of the Tale of Samdroo, the Tailor\nWho Turned Sailor. Yes, that is supposed to be a story to entertain\nchildren, but I'm beginning to think there is a great deal to it.\nRemember, the story describes just such a hill and just such a cave. It\nis said that every roaming island has just such a place. And....\"\n\n\"You talk too much,\" broke in Aga harshly. \"Let's get on into the cave.\"\n\nGreen could appreciate what Aga's comment meant. Miran had lost face\nbecause he'd allowed his vessel to be wrecked and his Clansmen murdered\nen masse. To Aga and the other women he was no longer Captain Miran,\nthe rich patriarch. He was Miran, the shipwrecked sailor. A fat old\nsailor. Just that. Nothing more.\n\nHe could have redeemed himself if he had committed suicide. But his\neagerness to live had resulted in his placing himself on an even lower\nlevel in their estimation.\n\nMiran must have realized this, for he did not reply. Instead he stood\nto one side.\n\nGreen walked thirty paces into the cave, then looked back over his\nshoulder. The entrance was still visible, an arch outlined in the\nbright moonshine.\n\nSomeone coughed. Green was about to caution them to keep quiet, when\nhe felt his nostrils tickling and had to fight to down a loud sneeze\nhimself.\n\n\"Dust.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Green. \"Maybe they never come down here.\"\n\nSuddenly the tunnel turned at right angles, to the left. The little\nlight that penetrated from the entrance disappeared in total blackness.\nThe party halted.\n\n\"What if there are traps set for intruders?\" wailed Inzax.\n\n\"That's a chance well have to take,\" Green growled. \"We'll go in the\ndark until we come to another turn. Then we'll light up a torch or two.\nThe natives won't be able to see the glow.\"\n\nHe walked ahead feeling the wall with his left hand. Suddenly he\nstopped. Amra bumped into him.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked anxiously.\n\n\"The rock wall has now become metal. Feel here.\"\n\nHe guided her hand.\n\n\"You're right,\" she whispered. \"There's a definite seam, and I can tell\nthe difference between the two!\"\n\n\"The floor's metal, too,\" added Soon. \"My feet are bare, and I can feel\nit. What's more, the dust is all gone.\"\n\nGreen went ahead, and after thirty more paces he came to another\nninety-degree turn, to the right. The walls and floor were composed of\nthe smooth, cool metal. After making sure that the entire party was\naround the corner, he told a woman carrying some torches taken from\na long house to light one. Its bright flare showed the group staring\nround-eyed at the large chamber in which they stood.\n\nEverywhere were bare gray metal walls and floors. No furniture of any\nkind.\n\nNor a speck of dust.\n\n\"There's a doorway to another room,\" he said. \"We might as well go on\nin.\"\n\nHe took the torch from the woman and, holding a cutlass in the other,\nhe led the way. Once across the threshold he halted.\n\nThis room was even larger than the other. But it had furnishings of a\nsort. And its further wall was not metal but earth.\n\nAt the same time the room began to brighten with light coming from an\ninvisible source.\n\nSoon screamed and threw herself against her mother, clinging\ndesperately to her waist. The babies began howling, and the other\nadults acted in the various ways that panic affected them.\n\nGreen alone remained unmoved. He knew what was happening, but he\ncouldn't blame the rest for their behavior. They had never heard of an\nelectronic eye, so they couldn't be expected to maintain coolness.\n\nThe only thing that Green feared at that moment was that the outcries\nwould be heard by the savages outside the cave. So he hastened to\nassure the women that this phenomenon was nothing to be frightened\nabout. It was common in his home country. A mere matter of white magic\nthat anyone could practice.\n\nThey quieted down but were still uneasy. Wide-eyed, they bunched up\nabout him.\n\n\"The natives themselves aren't scared of this,\" he said. \"They must\ncome here at times. See? There's an altar built against that dirt wall.\nAnd from the bones piled beneath it I'd say that sacrifices were held\nhere.\"\n\nHe looked for another door. There seemed to be none. He found it hard\nto believe that there couldn't be. Somehow he'd had the feeling that\ngreat things lay ahead of him. These rooms, and this lighting, were\nevidences of an earlier civilization that quite possibly had been\non a level with his own. He'd known that the island itself must be\npowered with an automatically working anti-gravity plant, fueled either\natomically or from the planet's magneto-gravitic field. Why the whole\nunit should be covered with rocks and soil and trees he didn't know.\nBut he had been sure that somewhere in the bowels of this mass of land\nwas just such a place as this. And more. Where was the power plant? Was\nit sealed up so that no one could get to it? Or, as was likely, was\nthere a door to the plant which could not be opened unless one had a\nkey of some sort?\n\nFirst he had to find the door.\n\nHe examined the altar, which was made of iron. It was a platform about\nthree feet high and ten feet square. Upon it stood a chair, fashioned\nfrom pieces of iron. From its back rose a steel rod about half an inch\nin diameter and ten feet long, its lower end held secure between two\nuprights by a thick iron fork. Once the fork was withdrawn, the rod\nwould obviously fall over against the earth wall behind it, though the\nlower end would still remain on the uprights and would, in fact, stick\nagainst whoever was sitting in the chair at the moment.\n\n\"Odd,\" said Green. \"If it weren't for those catheaded idols on the\nends of the platform, and the bones at its foot, I'd not know this\n_was_ an altar. Bones! They're black, burned black.\"\n\nHe looked again at the rod. \"Now,\" he said, half to himself, \"if I were\nto withdraw the fork, and the rod fell, it would strike the wall. That\nis evident. But what is it all about?\"\n\nAmra brought him some long pieces of rope.\n\n\"These were stacked against the wall,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes? Ah! Now, if I were to tie one end of this rope about the apex of\nthat rod, and someone else were to stand upon the altar and take out\nthe fork, then I could control which direction the rod would fall by\npulling it toward me. Or allowing it to go away from me. And the person\nwho had taken the fork out would then have plenty of time to get down\nfrom the altar and back to the region of safety, where the rope-wielder\nand his friends would be stationed. Alas, the poor fellow sitting in\nthe chair! Yes, I see it all now.\"\n\nHe looked up from the rope he held in his hand. \"Aga!\" he said sharply.\n\"Get away from that wall!\"\n\nThe tall, lean woman was walking past the altar, holding her bare\ncutlass in her hand. When she heard Green she paused in her stride,\ngave him an astonished look, then continued.\n\n\"You don't understand,\" she called back over her shoulder. \"This wall\nisn't solid earth. It's fluffy, like a young chick's feathers. It's\ndust, dust. I think we can knock it down, cut our way through. There\nmust be something on the other side....\"\n\n\"Aga!\" he yelled. \"Don't! Stop where you are!\"\n\nBut she had lifted her blade and brought it down in a hard stroke that\nwas to show him how easy the stuff would be to slash away.\n\nGreen grabbed Amra and Paxi and dived to the floor, pulling them with\nhim.\n\nThunder roared and lightning filled the room, dazzling and deafening\nhim! Even in its midst he could see the dark figure of Aga, transfixed,\ncrucified in white fire.\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nThen Aga was blotted out by the dense cloud of dust that billowed out\nover her and filled the whole room. With it came an intense heat. Green\nopened his mouth to cry out to Amra and Paxi to cover their faces and\nespecially their noses. Before he could do so his own open mouth was\npacked with dust and his nostrils were full. He began sneezing and\ncoughing explosively, while his eyes ran tears in their efforts to wash\nout the dirt that caked and burned them. Clods of dirt struck him,\nhurled by the blast. They didn't hurt because they were so small and\nso fluffy. But they fell so swiftly and in such numbers that he was\nhalf-buried under them. Even in the midst of his shock he couldn't help\nbeing thankful that he'd been breathing out when the heat struck him.\nOtherwise he'd have sucked in air that would have seared his lungs,\nand he'd have dropped dead. As it was, wherever his skin had not been\ncovered by cloth he felt as if he were suffering a bad case of sunburn.\n\nPainfully, he rose on all fours and began crawling toward the other\nroom, where he thought the dust would not be so thick. At the same\ntime he tugged at Amra's arm--at least he supposed it was her arm,\nsince she'd been so close to him when the explosion took place. His\ngesture was intended to tell her that she should follow him. She rose\nand followed him, touching him from time to time. Once she stopped, and\nhe turned to find out what was bothering her, even if he felt that he\ncouldn't stand much more of the almost solid dust in his lungs and had\nto get out to open air or strangle. Then he knew that the woman was\nAmra, for she was carrying a child in her arms. The child had a scarf\naround her head and, as he remembered, Paxi was the only infant so\ndressed.\n\nCoughing violently, he rose to his feet, pulling Amra to hers, and\nswiftly walked toward where he hoped the exit was. He knew he'd fallen\non his face in the general direction of the doorway; if he kept in a\nstraight line he might make it without wandering off to one side.\n\nHe found soon enough that he was going just opposite, for he fell\nheadlong over a body on the floor. When he got up again, he ran his\nhands over the body. The skin was crusty, scaly. Aga's burned corpse.\nThe cutlass was lying by her side, assuring him of her identity.\n\nRe-oriented, he turned back, still pulling Amra by the hand. This time\nhe ran into a wall, but he had his free hand stretched out in front of\nhim for just such an event. Frantically, he groped to his left until\nhe came to the corner of the room. Then, knowing that the doorway lay\nback to his right, he turned and felt along the metal until he came to\nthe opening. He plunged through it, almost fell into the other room,\nwhich was as dark and dusty as the one he'd just left. He trotted on\nahead, bumped into another wall, groped to his right, found the next\nexit and ran through that. Here the air was much more free of dust. He\ncould actually make out outlines of his companions as the light was\npenetrating the fainter haze.\n\nNevertheless he and the others were coughing and weeping as if they\nwere trying to eject lungs and eyeballs alike. Spasm after spasm shook\nthem.\n\nGreen decided that this room wasn't really much better than the others,\nso he led Amra and Paxi around the right-angled corner and into the\ndark tunnel. Here his violent rackings began to quiet down and by rapid\nblinking, which forced tears, he cleaned his eyes of much of the dust.\nAnxiously, he peered down the passageway toward its end, where the cave\nmouth formed a dim arch in the moonlight outside.\n\nIt was as he'd feared. Somebody stood there, outlined in the beams,\nbent forward, peering in.\n\nHe thought that it must be the priestess, for the figure was slight and\nthe hair was pulled up on top of the head in a great Psyche knot with a\nfeather stuck through it. Moreover, around her feet were four or five\ncats.\n\nHis coughing betrayed him, for the priestess suddenly whirled and\ntrotted off on her sticklike legs. Green dropped Amra's hand and ran,\nat the same time drawing his stiletto from his belt, as he'd lost his\ncutlass during the explosion. He had to stop the priestess, though he\ndidn't know what good it would do. The savages sooner or later would\ncome to the sanctuary to ask if she'd seen any of the refugees. And if\nthey couldn't find her they would at once suspect what had happened.\nThe chances were that they already knew. Surely, the noise of the blast\nmust have penetrated even to their ears.\n\nOr had it? The air waves had to round several perpendicular turns\nbefore reaching the cave mouth, and it might be that the noise had\nseemed much greater to Green than it actually was because he'd been so\nclose to it. Perhaps there was some hope.\n\nHe ran into the clearing before the cave mouth. The sun was just coming\nover the horizon, so he could see things clearly. The old woman was\nnowhere in sight. The only live things were several drunken cats. One\nof these began to rub its back against Green's leg and purred loudly.\nAutomatically, he stooped down and caressed it, though his gaze\nflickered everywhere for a sign of the priestess. The door of her hut\nwas open and since it was so small he could be certain that she had no\nroom in there to hide from him. She must have run off down the path.\n\nIf so, she wasn't making any noise about it. There were no outcries\nfrom her to call her companions to her help.\n\nHe found her lying face down on the path, halfway down the hill. At\nfirst he thought she was playing possum, so he turned her over, his\nstiletto ready to shut off any outcry. A glance at her hanging jaw and\nashen color convinced him that her possum-playing days were over. At\nfirst, he thought she'd tripped and broken her neck, but an examination\ndisproved this. The only thing he could think of was that her old heart\nhad given away under the sudden fright and the stress of running.\n\nSomething brushed his ankles. So startled was he, so convinced that a\nspear had just missed him, he leaped into the air and whirled around.\nThen he saw that it was only the cat that had rubbed itself against\nhim when he'd first come out of the tunnel. It was a large female cat\nwith a beautiful long black silky coat and with golden eyes. It exactly\nresembled the Earth cat and was probably descended from the same\nancestors as its terrestrial counterpart. Wherever Homo sapiens of the\nunthinkably long ago had penetrated he seemed to have taken his canine\nand feline pets.\n\n\"You like me, huh?\" said Green. \"Well, I like you, too, but I'm not\ngoing to if you keep on scaring me. I've been through enough tonight\nfor a lifetime.\"\n\nThe cat, purring, paced delicately toward him.\n\n\"Maybe you can do me some good,\" he said and lifted the cat to his\nshoulder, where she crouched, vibrating with contentment.\n\n\"I don't know what you see in me,\" he confided softly to her. \"I must\nbe a frightful-looking object, what with being covered with dust, and\nmy eyes red and raw and running. But then, you're not so delightful\nyourself, what with your beery breath blowing in my face. I like you\nvery much, What's-your-name. What _is_ your name? Let's call you Lady\nLuck. After all, when I rubbed you I found the priestess dead. If she\nhadn't died she'd have got away to warn the cannibals. And obviously,\nyou, her luck, had deserted her for me. So Lady Luck it will be. Let's\ngo back up the hill and see what's happened to the rest of my friends.\"\n\nHe found Amra sitting down at the cave's mouth, cuddling Paxi in an\neffort to quiet her. Nine others were there, too, Grizquetr, Soon,\nMiran, Inzax, three women, two little girls. The rest, he presumed,\nwere lying dead or unconscious in the altar room. They made a\ndirty-looking, red-eyed, weary group, not good for much except lying\ndown and passing out.\n\n\"Look,\" he said, \"we have to have sleep, whatever else happens. We'll\ngo back into the first chamber and get some there, and....\"\n\nAs one, the others protested that nothing would get them to return\nanywhere near that horrible fiend-haunted room. Green was at a loss.\nHe thought he knew exactly what had happened, but he just could not\nexplain to these people in terms they'd understand. And they probably\nwould have a dark distrust of him from then on.\n\nHe decided to take the simple, if untrue, explanation.\n\n\"Undoubtedly Aga provoked a host of demons by striking at the wall\nbehind the altar,\" he said. \"I tried to warn her. You all heard me. But\nthose demons won't bother us again, for we are now under the protection\nof the cat, the cannibals' totem. Moreover it is the nature of such\nbeings that, once they've released their fury and taken some victims,\nthey are harmless, quiescent, for a long time after. It takes time for\nthem to build up strength enough to hurt human beings again.\"\n\nThey swallowed this offering as they would never have his other\nexplanation.\n\n\"If you will lead the way,\" they said, \"we will return. We put our\nlives in your hands.\"\n\nBefore going into the cave he paused to take another survey. From his\nspot in the clearing, which was almost on the top of the hill, he could\nlook over the tree tops and see most of the island, except where other\nhills barred his view. The island had stopped moving and had settled\ndown against the plain itself. Now, to the untutored eye, the entire\nmass looked like a clump of dirt, rocks and vegetation for some reason\nrising from the grassy seas. It would remain so until dusk, when it\nwould again launch itself upon its five-mile-an-hour journey to the\neast. And once having reached a certain point there, it would reverse\nitself and begin its nocturnal pilgrimage toward the west. Back and\nforth, shuttling for how many thousands of years? What was its purpose,\nand whom had its builders been? Surely they could not have conceived in\ntheir wildest dreams of its present use, a mobile fortress for a tribe\nof cannibals?\n\nNor could they have seen to what uses their dust-collectors would be\nput. They couldn't have guessed that, millennia thence, men ignorant of\ntheir originally intended purpose would be using the devices as part of\ntheir religious ritual and of human sacrifice.\n\nGreen left the others in the room next to the one where the explosion\nhad taken place. They lay down on the hard floor and at once went to\nsleep. He, however, felt that there were certain things that had to be\ndone and that he was the only one physically capable of doing them.\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nThough he hated to go back into the altar room, he forced himself. The\nscene of carnage was bad enough, but not as repulsive as he'd expected.\nDust had thrown a gray veil of mercy over the bodies. They looked like\npeaceful gray statues; most of them had not burned on the outside but\nhad died because they'd breathed the first lung-scorching wave of air\ndirectly. Nevertheless, despite the look of peace and antiquity, the\nodor of burned flesh from Aga hung heavy. Lady Luck bristled and arched\nher back, and for a moment Green thought she was going to leap from his\nshoulder and run away.\n\nHe said, \"Take it easy,\" then decided that she must have smelled\nthis often before. Her present reaction was based on past episodes;\nprobably, there had been great excitement then. The cats, being taboo\nanimals, must have been figures of some importance in the sacrificial\nceremonies.\n\nCautiously, the man approached the wall of dirt behind the altar, even\nthough he did not think there would be any danger for some time to\ncome. The altar itself was comparatively undamaged. Surprised at this,\nhe ran his hand over it and found out that it was composed of baked\nclay, hard as rock. The chair and metal rod had not been torn loose.\nBoth were tightly bolted down with huge studs which he supposed had\nbeen taken off wrecked 'rollers.\n\nThe victims that were tied in the chair by the savages must have been\nsitting looking at the audience, so that their backs were to the wall\nitself. That meant that when the rod was dropped to make contact\nbetween the wall and victim, the discharge only burned the sacrifice's\nhead. Evidence of that was the fact that only skulls were stacked\naround the altar. The charred head was severed and the body carted\noutside to one destination or another.\n\nWhat puzzled Green was how the audience managed to escape the fury of\nthe blast and of the dust, even if they stood at the farthest end of\nthe big room. Determined to find out what happened at those times, he\nreturned to the doorway. Just around its corner, in the second room, he\ndiscovered what he'd not noticed before, probably because it was placed\nso upright and so firmly against one side of the wall. And because its\nback, which was turned away from the wall, was also made of gray metal.\nWhen he switched it around so he could see its other side, he was\nstaring into a mirror about six feet high and four feet wide.\n\nNow he could visualize the ceremony. The victim was strapped into the\nchair and a rope was tied around the rod. Everybody but the priestess,\nor whoever conducted the rites, retreated from the altar room. The\nconductor himself, or herself, then stood in the doorway and released\nthe cord. Before the rod could make contact, the conductor had stepped\naround the corner. And there the audience saw in the mirror, placed\nin the doorway so it reflected the interior of the altar room, the\nravening discharge of a tremendous electrostatic blast. And immediately\nafterward, no doubt, they saw nothing because of the dust that would\nfill the two rooms.\n\nStrange and strong magic to the savages. What myths they must have\nbuilt about this room, what tales of horrible and powerful gods or\ndemons imprisoned in that wall of dirt! Surely their old women must\nwhisper to the wide-eyed children stories of how the Great Cat-Spirit\nhad been caught by their legendary strong man and savior, some analog\nto Hercules or Gilgamesh or Thor, and how the Cat-Spirit was the\ntribe's to keep prisoner with their magic and to appease from time to\ntime with human kills from other tribes lest it become so angry it\nburst through the wall of earth and devour everybody upon the floating\nisland!\n\nGreen knew that it was hopeless to try to dig through that wall, even\nif it would be safe for days. It might only be several feet thick, or\nit might be twenty or more.\n\nBut however thick it was, he bet that anybody who had the tools, time\nand strength to excavate would find, embedded somewhere in that mass,\nseveral large dust-collectors. He didn't know what shape they'd take,\nbecause that would depend on the culture that had built them, and their\ntastes in decorations would differ from Green's multimillennia-later\nsociety. But if they had architectural ideas similar to present-day\nTerrans they would have constructed the collectors in the shape of\nbusts or of animals' heads or even of bookcases with false backs of\nbooks filling them, books that would in reality have been both chargers\nand filters. The busts or books would have been pierced with many tiny\nholes, and through these holes the charged particles of dust would have\ndrifted. Once inside the collectors, they would have been burned.\n\nLooking at the blank dirt before him, Green could see what had happened\nthrough the ages. Some part of the burning mechanism had gone\nwrong--as was the custom of mechanisms everywhere. But the charging\neffect had continued. And though the dust had piled up around the\ncollectors, the extraordinarily powerful fields had continued to work\neven through the thick blanket. In the beginning, of course, their\nfield could not have caused any human being harm. But these batteries\nmust have been built to adjust to whatever demand was made of them,\nthough their builders, of course, could have had no idea of how great\nthat demand would some day be. Nevertheless it had come, and the\nbatteries had been equal to it. By the time the savages had found this\nroom they were blocked off by this imposing wall.\n\nThrough the death of their fellows they had discovered that touching\nthe wall caused a terrible discharge of electrostatic electricity. The\nrest of the apparatus for execution and the ritual that went with it\nwas foregone and logical, religiously speaking.\n\nGreen swore with frustration. How he would love to get through that\ndirt before another charge built up! On the other side must be another\ndoorway, and it must lead to the fuel and control rooms for this whole\nisland. If he could get inside and there figure out the controls, he'd\nturn this island upside down and shake off the man-eating monsters.\nThere'd be no holding him then!\n\nHe remembered the story of Samdroo, the Tailor Who Turned Sailor. The\nlegend went that Samdroo, his 'roller wrecked upon just such a roaming\nisland as this one, had wandered into just such a cave and through\nrooms like these. But he'd found no barrier of electrically charged\ndirt and had walked into a room which contained many strange things.\nOne of them was a great eye that allowed Samdroo to see in it what was\nhappening outside the cave. Another was a board which contained many\nround faces over which raced little squiggles and lines. Of course, the\nstory had its own explanations for what these things were, but Green\ncould hardly fail to recognize TV, oscilloscopes and other instruments.\n\nUnfortunately his knowledge was going to do him no good. He wasn't\ngoing to get through the dirt. Nor was he to be allowed time for\nexcavation and exploration. Every minute on this island meant that he\nwas traveling back to Quotz and its revengeful Duchess and getting\nfarther from Estorya, where the two spacemen and their ship were. He\nhad to find a way of getting off this place and onto some means of\ntransportation.\n\nHe left the death chamber and went into the next room. After slumping\ndown against the wall, between Amra with Paxi in her arms, and Inzax\nwith Grizquetr in hers, he chewed some dried meat. Lady Luck meowed for\nsome and he gladly gave her all she wanted. When he'd swallowed all he\ncould hold without bursting and had washed that down with great drafts\nof the warm and sweet beer taken from the priestess's hut, he closed\nhis eyes. Now, it was up to his Vigilante to take the food and rebuild\nhis wasted tissue, throw off the effects of autointoxication, tone\nhis tired muscles, relax his too-taut nerves, readjust his hormonal\nbalance....\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\nGreen dreamed that his mouth and nose were clogged with dirt and that\nhe was suffocating. He woke to find that, while there was no earth upon\nhim, he was having a difficult time getting his breath. Remedying that\nby removing the cat from his face, he rose.\n\n\"What do you want?\" he asked her. She was mewing and striking gently at\nhim.\n\nShe padded toward the doorway to the outside, so he imagined that she\nwished him to follow her. Grasping his cutlass, he walked after her and\nout to the tunnel that led to the cave mouth. Not until then did he\nhear the booming of cannon, far away.\n\nThe cat meowed plaintively. Evidently, she'd heard cannonfire before\nand had not liked the results.\n\nOnce out of the cave he stopped to look up at the sun. It was on its\ndownward path from the zenith. About four o'clock in the afternoon.\nHe'd slept about ten hours.\n\nUnable to see much from where he stood, he climbed up the rocks outside\nthe cave and soon stood upon the very top of the hill, a little\ntableland about ten feet square. From there he commanded as good a\nview of the island as anyone could get.\n\nTacking around the periphery of the island were three long, low,\nblack-hulled 'rollers with over-large wheels and scarlet sails.\nOccasionally a lance of red spurted from one of the vessel's ports, a\nboom reached Green's ears a few seconds later and he would see the iron\nball climb up and up, then fall toward the village. A tree around the\nclearing would lose a limb, or a spurt of dust would show where a ball\nlanded in the clearing itself. Two of the long houses had big holes in\ntheir roofs. The village itself was deserted, as no one with good sense\nwould have remained there. None of the cannibals were visible, but that\nwasn't surprising, considering how thick the woods were.\n\nGreen hoped the Vings would land soon and clean out the savages.\nThat would leave him and his party a clear field, unless the pirates\ninvestigated the cave in the same day. If they didn't, then the\nrefugees could leave the island and take to the plains under cover of\nthe night.\n\nAnxiously, Green traced the path that led from the hilltop where he\nstood and wound down to the village. It was a narrow trail and he often\nlost sight of it. But always there was a difference in the shading of\nthe tree tops along the trail and the rest of the forest. With his eye\nhe could follow the shading to the village and beyond, toward the back\nor western part of the island.\n\nIt was here that he came across the first sign of hope he had had\nsince the wreck of the _Bird of Fortune_. It was a small break in the\nvegetation, which ran uninterrupted to the very edge of the island, a\nshelf of seemingly smooth earth, almost hidden from him by the slope of\nthe terrain. Indeed, he could barely make it out and might have missed\nit altogether, but he saw the masts of three small 'rollers projecting\nfrom above the slope and followed them down toward the hulls. All three\nwere yachts, obviously not of islander make. Beyond the stolen craft\nwere the uprights of davits. These were behind a wall of branches,\ncamouflage for anybody outside the island but visible to those on the\ninside.\n\nIt was all Green could do to keep from whooping with joy. Now he and\nhis party wouldn't have to cast themselves on foot on the dangerous\nplains. They could sail in comparative safety. Now, while the cannibals\nwere cowering helplessly under the bombardment Green could lead his\npeople through the woods to the yachts. When dusk came and the island\nbegan moving again they could lower a yacht from the davits and set\nsail.\n\nHe went back to the cave entrance, where he found everybody awake,\nwaiting for him.\n\nHe told them what he'd seen and added, \"If the Vings come aboard we'll\ntake advantage of the confusion and escape.\"\n\nMiran looked at the sun and shook his head. \"The Vings won't attack\nnow. It's too close to dusk. They'll want a full day for fighting.\nThey'll follow the island tonight. When dawn comes and the island stops\nthey'll board.\"\n\n\"I bow to your superior experience,\" Green said. \"Only I'd like to ask\nyou one thing. Why don't the Vings launch their small craft at night\nand land boarding parties from them?\"\n\nMiran looked surprised. \"No one does that! It's unthinkable! Don't you\nknow that at night the plains abound in spirits and demons? The Vings\nwouldn't think of taking a chance on what the magic of the savages\nmight unloose against them in the darkness.\"\n\n\"I knew of the general attitude, but it had slipped my mind,\" admitted\nGreen. \"But if this is so, why did you all wander about this place the\nnight the _Bird_ was wrecked?\"\n\n\"That was a situation where we preferred the somewhat uncertain\npossibility of stumbling across demons to the certainty of being killed\nby the cannibals,\" said Miran.\n\n\"To be honest,\" said Amra, \"I was too scared to think of ghosts. If I\nhad I might have stayed where I was.... No, I wouldn't either. I've\nnever seen a ghost, but I had seen those savages.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Green, \"all of you might as well make up your mind that,\ncome ghosts, demons, or men, we're walking through the dark tonight.\nAll those too scared will have to stay behind.\"\n\nHe began issuing orders, and in a short time he had the sleepy-eyed,\nbedraggled and dirty-looking party ready. After that, he turned to\nwatch the bombardment.\n\nBy then it had largely ceased. Only occasionally did one of the vessels\nloose a single cannon shot. The rest of the time they spent in tacking\nback and forth and in running up close to the very edge of the island.\n\n\"I think they are trying the temper of the island's inhabitants,\" Green\nsaid. \"They don't know whether the woods conceal a hundred savages or\na thousand, or whether they're armed with cannons and muskets or just\nwith spears. They want to draw fire, so they can get an estimate of\nwhat they're facing.\"\n\nHe turned to Miran. \"Which reminds me, why is it that the natives don't\nuse guns? They must have a chance to get their hands on many from the\nwrecks.\"\n\nThe fat merchant shrugged and rolled his one good eye to indicate that\nhe didn't really know but was making a guess.\n\n\"Probably they've a taboo against using firearms. Whatever the reason,\nthey're evidently suffering because they neglect them. Look how few\nthey are. Only fifty men! They must have lost quite a few through\nraids from other savage tribes, both from those who live upon the\nplain itself and from those who live on other roaming islands. They're\ndown to the point now where they must die out within a generation,\neven without help from such as those,\" he said, pointing to the Ving\n'rollers.\n\n\"Yes, and I suppose that during the daytime, when the island is\nstopped, grass cats and dire dogs board it. These must take their toll\nof the humans.\"\n\nHe gazed again at the red sails and wheels of the Vings. \"I'd think\nthat those pirates would take every island they could and would use\nthem as bases from which to operate.\"\n\n\"They do,\" said Amra. \"For a generation now the Vings have been\nscouring the plains, locating the islands and exterminating the savages\non them. Then they've fortified the islands, so that you might say that\ntoday the Xurdimur is dominated by them. But there's a drawback to an\nisland as a harbor. No large 'roller may get very close except in the\ndaylight. They have to put out to grass every night and follow their\nbase at a safe distance until dawn. However, though the Vings are well\nestablished on many roamers, they're often attacked by the navies of\nvarious nations and sometimes driven off. Then the nation that takes\npossession of the island has a nice little base. And, of course, quite\noften they use it to launch their own piratical ventures against the\ncraft of countries at peace with them.\n\n\"Oh, the Xurdimur is a land where every man's hand is against the\nother, and the devil take the ones with short sail! A man may make his\nfortune or break his heart, all in a night's work. But, then, you know\nthat only too well.\"\n\nGreen interrupted, \"We'll leave them, and the natives, too, when\nmoonlight gets here. I only hope that there aren't other Ving craft in\nthe neighborhood.\"\n\n\"What the gods will, happens,\" replied Miran. His sad face reflected\nthe belief that if he, the favorite of Mennirox, could come to grief,\nthen Green could expect even worse.\n\nWhen dusk came, Green walked from the cave into the dark and hard rain.\nBehind him came Amra, one hand upon his shoulder, the other supporting\nPaxi. The rest were stretched out in a line behind her, each person's\nhand on the shoulder of the one ahead.\n\nThe black cat was underneath Green's coat, riding in a large pocket of\nhis shirt. She had made it plain to him that where he went, she went.\nAnd Green, to avoid a big fuss and also because he was beginning to\nfeel very affectionate toward her, allowed her to come along.\n\nThe descent from the hilltop was an anxious and stumbling trip. Green,\nafter ten minutes of groping along the path, had to acknowledge he did\nnot know where he was. So many windings had the path taken that he\ndid not know whether he was going east, north, south, or in the right\ndirection, west.\n\nActually, it didn't really matter, as long as it brought him to the\nedge of the island. He could skirt the edge until he arrived at the\nfleet craft that would give them a chance for flight.\n\nThe trouble was in finding that rim. He was afraid that it would be\npossible to wander in circles and figure eights until moonlight. Then,\nthough they'd be able to orient themselves, they'd also be exposed to\nthe view of the cannibals. And if they found themselves, say, at the\neastern edge, their journey around would be perilous indeed.\n\nOccasional lightning flashed, and then he could make out his immediate\nenvironment. These brief revelations weren't much help. All he could\nsee were the solid-seeming walls of tree trunks and bushes.\n\nSuddenly Amra spoke. \"Do you think we're getting close?\"\n\nHe stopped so suddenly that the entire line lurched into him. Lightning\nburst again, quite close by. The cat, curled in his coat pocket, spat\nand tried to shrink into an even smaller ball. Absently, Green patted\nher from outside the coat. He said, \"Your name _is_ Lady Luck. I just\nsaw the village. Now we're getting some place. I really needed that\nreferent.\"\n\nHe wasn't worried about the inhabitants of the village. All were\nundoubtedly cowering under the roofs of their long houses, praying to\nwhatever gods they worshiped that they would not send the lightning\ntheir way. There would be little danger if the whole party were to walk\nthrough the center of the village. He planned to take no chances at\nall, however, and ordered everybody to follow him around the clearing.\n\n\"It won't be long now!\" he said to Amra. \"Pass the word back and cheer\neverybody up.\"\n\nHalf an hour later he wished he'd kept his mouth shut. It was true that\nhe'd followed the wandering path to the cove where their boats were\nkept. But he'd at once drawn his breath in pain of surprise.\n\nA lightning bolt had illuminated the gray rock walls of the cove, its\nbroad shelf, and the high black iron davits.\n\nBut the yachts were gone!\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\nLater Green thought that if ever the time came when he should have\ncracked up, that instant of loss, white and sudden as the lightning\nitself, should have been the one.\n\nThe others cried out loudly in their grief and shock, but he was as\nsilent as the empty stone shelf. He could not move nor utter a word;\nall seemed hopeless, so what was the use of motion or talk?\n\nNevertheless, he was human, and human beings hope even when there is no\njustification for it. Nor could he remain frozen until the next stroke\nof lightning would reveal to the others the state of their leader. He\n_had_ to act. What if his actions _were_ meaningless? Mere movement\nanswered for the demands of the body, and at that moment it was his\nbody that could move. His mind was congealed.\n\nShouting to the others to scatter and look about in the brush, but not\nto scatter too far, he began climbing up the slope of the hill. When\nhe had reached its top he left the path and plunged into the forest to\nhis right on the theory that if the yachts were anywhere they must be\nthere. He had two ideas about where they might be. One was that the\nVings had spotted them and had sent in a party aboard a gig to push\nthem over the side of the island. Thus, when the island had begun its\nnightly voyage it had left the 'rollers sitting upon the plain. The\nother theory was also inspired by the presence of the Vings. Perhaps\nthe savages had hidden their craft because of just such an event as\nhis first theory put forth. To do that they would have had to haul the\n'rollers up the less steep slant of the cove.\n\nAt the point where he would have looped a rope around a tree and used\nit to pull a yacht uphill, he saw all three of the missing craft. They\nwere nestling side by side just over the lip of the slope, their hulls\nhidden by brush piled up before them. Their tall masts, of course,\nwould be taken for tree trunks by anybody but a very close observer.\n\nGreen yelled with joy, then whirled to run back and tell the others.\nAnd slammed into a tree trunk. He picked himself up, swearing because\nhe'd hurt his nose. And tripped over something and fell again.\nThereafter, he seemed to be in a night-mare of frustration, of\nconspiracy between tree and night to catch and delay him. Where his\ntrip up had been easy, his trip back was a continued barking of shins,\nbumping of nose, and tearing loose from clutching bushes and thorns.\nHis confusion wasn't at all helped when the lightning ceased, because\nhe'd been guiding himself by its frequent flashes. And Lady Luck,\nalarmed at all the hard knocks she was getting, struggled out of his\nshirt pocket and slipped into the forest. He called to her to come\nback, but she had had enough of him, for the time being, anyway.\n\nFor a brief moment he thought of the fantastic device of grabbing\nhold of her tail and following her through the dark. But she was gone,\nand the idea wouldn't have worked, anyway. More than likely she'd have\nturned and bitten his hands until he released her.\n\nThere was nothing to do but make his own way back.\n\nAfter ten minutes of frantic struggling, during which he suddenly\nrealized he'd turned the wrong way and was wandering away from the edge\nof the island, he saw the clouds disappear. With the bright moon came\nvision and sanity. He turned around and in a short time was back at the\ncove.\n\n\"What happened to you?\" asked Amra. \"We thought maybe you'd fallen off\nthe edge.\"\n\n\"That's about all that didn't happen,\" he said, irritated now that he\nhad been so easily lost. He told them where the yachts were and added,\n\"We'll have to let one down by a rope before we can connect it to the\ndavits. It'll take a lot of pushing and pulling, a lot of muscle.\nEverybody up on the hill, including the children!\"\n\nWearily, they climbed up the slope to the top and shoved one of the\n'rollers up the slight incline of the depression to the lip of the\nhill. Green picked up one of the wet ropes lying on the ground and\npassed it around the tree. Its trunk had a groove where many ropes had\nworn a path during similar operations. One end he gave to half of the\nparty, putting Miran in charge of them. The other end he tied in a\nbowknot to a huge iron eye which projected from the stern of the craft.\nThen, ordering the other half of the women to help him push, he got the\n'roller over the lip and down the slope, while the rope gang slowly\nreleased the double loop around the tree in short jerks.\n\nWhen the craft had halted by the davits, Green untied the rope. His\nnext step would be to back the yacht in between the davits so that he\ncould hook up its ropes and lift it. Fortunately, there was a winch and\ncable for this. Unfortunately, the winch was hand-operated and had been\nallowed to get rusty. It would work only with great resistance and with\nloud squeaking. Not that more noise mattered, for the party had made so\nmuch that only the fact that the wind was from the east could have kept\nthe savages in ignorance of the survivors' whereabouts.\n\nIt was as if his thinking of them had brought them upon the scene.\nGrizquetr, who'd been stationed in a tree as a sentinel, called down,\n\"I see a torch! It's somewhere in the woods, about half a mile away.\nOh! There's another one! And another one!\"\n\nGreen said, \"Do you think they're on the path that leads here?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But they're coming this way, winding here and there,\nwandering like Samdroo when he was lost in the Mirrored Mazes of\nGil-Ka-Ku, The Black One! Yes, they must be on the path!\"\n\nGreen began feverishly tying the davit-ropes to the axles of the craft.\nHe sweated with anxiety and cursed when his fumbling fingers got in the\nway of his haste. But the tying of the four bowknots actually took less\nthan a minute, in spite of the way time seemed to race past him.\n\nThat done he had to order off the yacht some of the women who had\nclimbed aboard. Only the women who had to take care of very small\ninfants and the older children were to be on that boat.\n\n\"Just who do you think is going to work the winch?\" he barked at the\ntoo-eager. \"Now, jump to it!\"\n\nOne of the women on the 'roller wailed, \"Are you going to stay on the\nisland and leave us all alone on this 'roller in the midst of the\nXurdimur?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered, as calmly as possible. \"We're going to lower you\nto the ground. Then we're going back up the hill and shove the other\n'rollers over the edge so that they can't be used by the savages to\ncome after us. We'll jump off and walk back to you.\"\n\nSeeing that the women were still not convinced and softened by their\npitiable looks, he called to Grizquetr.\n\n\"Come down! And get on the boat!\"\n\nAnd when the boy had run down the slope and halted by his side,\nbreathing hard and looking up at him for his orders, Green said, \"I'm\ndelegating you to guard these women and babies until we arrive. Okay?\"\n\n\"Okay,\" said Grizquetr, grinning, his chest swelling because of the\nimportance of the duty. \"I'm captain until you climb aboard, is that\nit?\"\n\n\"You're a captain and a good one too,\" said Green, slapping him lightly\non the shoulder. Then he ordered the winches turned until the 'roller\nwas hoisted into the air a few inches. As soon as the rusty machines\nhad groaningly fulfilled their functions he had the craft lowered over\nthe edge and down to the plain. The transition was smoothly made; the\nyacht's wheels began turning; the nose lifted only slightly because\nof the superior pull on the ropes tied to the bow; the stem ropes\nwere paid out a little to equalize the strain; then, obeying Green's\ngesture, the women aboard it pulled at the bowknots, which untied\nsimultaneously. Not until then did he breathe a little easier, for if\none or more had refused to slip loose as swiftly as another, the craft\nmight have been pulled up on one side or dragged around by either end\nand thus capsized.\n\nFor a few seconds he watched the 'roller slip away, coasting on its\nmomentum but headed at right angles to the direction of the island.\nThen it had stopped, and it began to grow smaller as the island left it\nbehind. From it came the thin wailing of his daughter Paxi. It broke\nthe spell that momentarily held him. He began running up the slope,\nshouting, \"Follow me!\"\n\nReaching the crest of the hill ahead of the others, he took time for a\nglance through the woods. Sure enough, torches bobbed up and down and\nflickered in and out as they passed between tree trunks. And there were\ndrums beating somewhere on the island.\n\nLady Luck shot out of the woods, leaped upon Green's knee, scaled his\nshirt front and came to rest upon his shoulder. \"Ah, you wandering\nwench, you,\" he said, \"I knew you couldn't stay away from my\nirresistible charm, now could you?\"\n\nLady Luck didn't reply but gazed anxiously at the forest.\n\n\"Never fear, my pretty little one,\" he said. \"They'll not touch a hair\nof my fine blond head. Nor a silky black one of yours.\"\n\nBy then the others, puffing and panting, had gained the top of the\nhill. He set them to pushing on the stern of a yacht, and in a minute\nthey had sent it headlong down the hill. When it rushed over the edge\nand disappeared with a crash on the plain below they had all they could\ndo to restrain their cheers. Small revenge for the suffering they'd\nhad to undergo. But it was something.\n\n\"Now for the other,\" said Green. \"Then everybody run as if the demons\nof Gil-Ka-Ku were on your tails!\"\n\nGrunting, they pushed the last 'roller up the little incline, then\ngathered their strength for the final heave that would launch it, too,\nupon its last voyage.\n\nAnd at that moment some savages who'd been running ahead of the\ntorch-bearers burst out of the woods.\n\nGreen took one look and realized that they would get between the edge\nof the island and his party. There were about ten of them; they not\nonly outnumbered his own force but were strong men against women. And\nthey had spears, whereas his people were armed mainly with cutlasses.\n\nGreen didn't waste any time in meditation. \"Everybody aboard except\nMiran and me!\" he said loudly. \"Don't argue! Get in! We're riding\nthrough them! Lie flat on the deck!\"\n\nScreaming, the women scrambled over the low rail and onto the deck.\nAs soon as the last one was on, the Earthman and Miran put their\nshoulders to the stern and pushed. For a second it looked as though\ntheir combined strength would not be enough, as if the party should\nhave shoved the craft a little further over the lip of the hill before\nstopping.\n\n\"There's not time to get them out again to help us!\" panted Green. \"Dig\nin, Miran, get that fat into gear, shove, damn you, shove!\"\n\nIt seemed to him that he was breaking his own collarbone under the\npressure and that he'd never felt such hard and cutting wood in all his\nlife. And it seemed that the 'roller was stubbornly refusing to move\nuntil the cannibals arrived in time to save it, like the Marines. His\nlegs quivered, and his intestines, he was sure, were writhing about\nlike snakes, striking here and there against the wall of his belly,\nseeking a weak place where they might erupt through into the open air\nand leave this man who subjected them to such toil.\n\nThere was a shout from the warriors assembled below and a thud of their\nfeet as they charged up.\n\n\"Now or never!\" shouted Green.\n\nHis face felt like one big blood vessel, and he was sure that he was\ngoing to blow his top, literally. But the 'roller moved forward,\ncrept slowly, groaned--or was that he?--and began moving swiftly, too\nswiftly, down the slope. Too swiftly, because he had to run after it,\ngrab the taffrail and haul himself over. And while he was doing that he\nhad to extend a hand to Miran, who wasn't as fast on his feet.\n\nFortunately Amra had presence of mind enough to grab Miran by the\nshoulder of his shirt and help pull. Over the rail he came, crying out\nin pain as his big stomach burned against the hard mahogany, but not\nforgetting the bag of jewels clutched in his hand.\n\nLady Luck had already deserted her post on Green's shoulder when he\nbegan pushing. Now she meowed softly and pressed against him, scared\nat the shaking of the deck and the rumbling of the wheels as the craft\nsped downhill.\n\nHe pulled her to him in the protection of the crook of his arm, and\nreared up on his elbow to see what he could see. What he saw was a\nspear flying straight at him. It shot by so close he fancied he could\nfeel the sharp edge of its blade graze him, and there was nothing\nof his imagination about the woman's scream that rose immediately\nafterward. It sounded so much like Amra that he was sure she'd been\nhit; however, he had no time to turn and find out. An islander had\nappeared by the side of the yacht, and as the deck was on a level with\nhis chest, the fellow could see them all easily enough. His arm flew\nback, then leaped forward, and the spear he held darted straight at\nGreen.\n\nNo, not at him, but at Lady Luck. Another warrior, a little further\ndown the slope, screaming something, also thrust at the cat. Evidently\nfelines were no longer taboo upon this island. The former worshipers\nconsidered that their totem had deserted them and therefore deserved\ndeath.\n\nLady Luck, however, had the traditional nine lives. None of the razor\nsharp blades came very close to her. And in the next few seconds the\nsavages were left howling upon the slope or lying unconscious on the\nspot where the 'roller had struck them. The vessel sped down the steep\nincline, bumped hard as it roared out upon the stone shelf, and flew\ninto the air. Green flattened himself out against the deck, hoping thus\nto dampen the effect of the three-foot drop onto the plain.\n\nSomehow he became separated from the deck, was floating in the air, and\nsaw the planks rushing up at him.\n\nThere was a brief interlude of darkness before Green awoke and realized\nthat the meeting of the deck and his face had done the latter no good\nat all and might have resulted in considerable damage. He was sure\nof it when he spit out his two front teeth. However, his pain was\noverwhelmed in the rush of joy at having escaped. For the island was\nretreating across the flat, moonlit Xurdimur while its inhabitants\nscreamed and jumped with fury and frustration on the rim, unable to\nbring themselves to leap after the refugees. Home was where the island\nwas, and they weren't going to get left behind for the sake of revenge.\n\n\"I hope the Vings exterminate you tomorrow,\" muttered Green. Wearily\nand painfully, he rose to his feet and surveyed what was left of the\nClan Effenycan. Amra was unhurt. If it was she who'd screamed when\nthe spear had passed over Green, she'd done it from fright. The spear\nitself was sticking out from the base of the mast, its head half-buried\nin the wood.\n\nHe climbed over the side and inspected the damage done by the\nthree-foot drop. One of the wheels had fallen off, and an axle was\nbent. Shaking his head, he spoke to the others, \"This roller is done\nfor. Let's start walking. We've a boat to catch.\"\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\nTwo weeks later the yacht was scudding along under a\ntwenty-mile-an-hour wind. It was high noon, and everybody except the\nhelmsmen, Amra and Miran was eating. They were lunching on steaks\ncarved from a _hoober_ which Green had shot from the deck and which had\nbeen cooked on the fireplace placed under a hood immediately aft of the\nsmall foredeck. There was no lack of food despite the fact that the\nyacht had not been stocked. Fortunately the savages who'd owned it had\nnot bothered to remove the several pistols and the keg of powder and\nsack of balls from its locker. With this Green killed enough deer and\n_hoobers_ to keep everybody well fed. Amra supplemented their protein\ndiet with grass which her culinary art turned into a halfway decent\nsalad. At times, when they neared a grove of trees, Green would stop\nthe yacht. They would go foraging for berries and for a large plant\nwhich could be beaten until soft, mixed with water, kneaded and baked\ninto a kind of bread.\n\nOnce, a grass cat dashed out from behind a tree, making straight for\nInzax. Green and Miran, both firing at the same time, crumpled it\nwithin ten yards of the little blonde.\n\nThe grass cats, big cheetah-like creatures with long slim legs built\nfor running, were only a peril when the party left the yacht. Though\nfully capable of leaping aboard when the 'roller was in movement, they\nnever did. Sometimes they might pace it for a mile or so, then they\nwould contemptuously walk away.\n\nGreen wished he could say the same for the dire dogs. These were almost\nas large as the grass cats and ran in packs of from six to twelve.\nSinister-looking with their gray-and-black spotted coats, pointed\nwolfish ears and massive jaws, they would run up to the very wheels,\nhowling and snapping with their monstrous yellow fangs. Then one would\nbe inspired with the idea of leaping aboard and finding out how the\noccupants tasted. Up he would come, easily sailing over the railing.\nUsually the occupants would discourage him with a well-placed thrust\nfrom a spear or an amputating swing of a cutlass. Sometimes they\nmissed, and he would land on the deck, which enabled the sailors to try\nagain, with better success. Back over the rail his body would go, back\nto his fellows, many of whom would stop the chase to devour their dead\ncomrade. Those who persisted in the hunt would then try their luck,\nbounding upon the yacht, snarling hideously, trying to scare their\nquarry into a complete paralysis and sometimes succeeding.\n\nNo lives were lost to the dire dogs, but almost everybody bore scars.\nOnly Lady Luck managed to stay unscathed. Every time she heard their\ndistant howling she scaled the mast and would not come down until the\ndanger was over.\n\nToday they'd not been bothered. Everybody relaxed, chattering and\nmunching happily the unexciting but nutritious meat of the _hoober_.\nMiran stood upon the foredeck, sighting at the sun through his\nsextant. This also had been found in the locker, along with some charts\nof the Xurdimur. Though the charts had had their locations marked in\nan alphabet unknown to anybody aboard, Miran had been able to compare\nthem in his mind to the charts he'd left on the _Bird of Fortune_. He\nhad crossed out the foreign names and put in names in the Kilkrzan\nalphabet. He'd done this only at the insistence of Green, who didn't\ntrust Miran to translate for him and wanted to be able to read the maps\nhimself. Not only that, he'd forced the fat merchant to teach both him\nand Amra how to use the clumsy and complicated but fairly accurate\nsextant.\n\nA few days later, after Green and his wife had begun to study the\nnavigation instrument, there occurred the accident that forced Green\nto take further measures to safeguard himself. He and Miran had been\nstanding at the stern, ready with their pistols while Amra steered\nthe yacht toward a group of _hoobers_. They were going through their\nusual maneuver of running down a herd until the exhausted animals\ncould be overtaken. Just as they neared an orange-colored stallion,\ngalloping furiously, Green raised his pistol. At the same time he was\nvaguely aware that Miran had also sighted but had stepped back, behind\nand to one side of him. Sensitive about wasting any of the valuable\nammunition, Green had turned his head to warn Miran not to shoot\nunless he, Green, missed. It was then that he saw the muzzle swerving\ntoward the back of his head. He ducked, fully expecting to get his\nbrains blown out before he could shout a warning. But Miran, seeing\nhis reaction, lowered the muzzle and puzzledly asked Green what he was\ndoing.\n\nGreen didn't answer. Instead he took the gun away from Miran's limp\ngrip and silently put it away in the locker. Neither he nor the\nmerchant ever referred to the incident, nor did Miran ask why he was\nnot permitted to take part in any shooting thereafter. That convinced\nGreen that the fellow had fully intended to shoot him. And then claim\nto the others that it had been an accident.\n\nTo forestall any more attempts at \"accidents\" Green told Amra that if\nhe were to disappear some dark night, she was to see that a certain\nperson was shot and thrown overboard. He did not name the certain\nperson, but he mentioned his sex and as Miran was the only other man\non the yacht, there was no doubt about to whom he referred. Thereafter,\nMiran was most cooperative, always smiling and joking. However,\nGreen caught him now and then with frowning brows and a thoughtful\nexpression. He was either fingering his stiletto or the bag of jewels\nhe carried inside his shirt. Green could imagine that he was planning\nsomething for the day they reached Estorya.\n\nNow, on this day two weeks after they'd left the island, Miran was\nshooting the sun, and Green was waiting until he was through, so he\ncould check on him. If his calculations were correct the yacht should\nbe directly east of Estorya two hundred miles. If they maintained their\naverage rate of twenty-five miles an hour they'd reach the windbreak in\na little over eight hours.\n\nThe fat merchant quit looking through the eyepiece of his instrument\nand walked to the cockpit where his charts and papers were. Green took\nthe sextant from him and made his own observations, then checked with\nMiran in the narrow and crowded cockpit.\n\n\"We agree,\" said Green, indicating with the pencil tip a round scarlet\nspot on the chart. \"We should be sighting this island within four\nhours.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Miran. \"That is an old landmark. It has been there a\nhundred miles due east of Estorya since before my grandfather's time.\nIt was once a roaming island, but it long ago quit moving and has\nstayed in that one spot. That is nothing unusual. Every captain knows\nof these fixed islands scattered all over the Xurdimur, and every now\nand then we have to add a new red mark to our charts because one of the\nroamers has settled down.\"\n\nHe paused, then added a statement that set Green's heart to beating\nfast.\n\n\"The unusual thing about this island is that it did not stop of its own\naccord. It was halted by the magic of the Estoryans, and it has been\nkept in that one place ever since by their magic.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Green, eagerly.\n\nMiran's round, pale-blue eye stared at him blankly.\n\n\"What do you mean what do I mean? I mean just what I said, nothing\nmore.\"\n\n\"I mean, what magic did they contrive to halt this roamer?\"\n\n\"Why, they put up certain peculiar towers in its path, and when the\nisland began going backwards to get out of the trap and go around it,\nthey moved other towers to block its retreat. These towers moved fast\non many well-greased wheels. Once the circle was completed the island\ncouldn't move. Nor has it been able to move since.\"\n\n\"These towers intrigue me. How did the Estoryans know how to halt these\nislands? And if they've succeeded with one, why not with the others?\"\n\n\"I do not know. Perhaps because the towers are huge and costly and\ndon't move too fast. Perhaps it is not worthwhile to the Estoryans to\ncapture many. As for their knowledge, I think they got it from their\nancestors. It was their great-great-great-and-then-some-grandfathers\nwho originally built Estorya in the middle of the plain and protected\nit from being crushed by these islands by placing these many towers all\naround their city. But it cost them much wood and time, and perhaps\nthey lost interest after that.\"\n\nMiran indicated a castle inked in beside the red spot.\n\n\"That castle means that a military or naval fortification has been\nbuilt there on the island. It is the furtherest eastern garrison of the\nEstoryans. When we come within sighting distance of it we are supposed\nto report. Of course, if you wish to avoid it, we may sail to the north\nor south and swing around it. But then we will have to report to the\nwindbreak master of the city itself, and they are rather hostile to\ncaptains who have failed to have their papers checked at the fort of\nShimdoog. Even if the craft is such a small and weak one as this. The\nEstoryans are a suspicious people.\"\n\nYes, thought Green, and I'll bet that you intend to inflate their\ndistrust with certain information about me.\n\nHe rose from the cockpit, and at the same time he heard Amra hail him\nfrom her station at the helm.\n\n\"Island on the horizon,\" she said. \"And many glittering white objects\nplaced before it.\"\n\nGreen refrained from comment. But he had a hard time concealing his\nexcitement, which grew with every turn of the wheels. He paced back and\nforth, stopping now and then to shade his eyes and look long at the\nwhite towers. Finally, as they got so near that he could no longer be\nmistaken about their size or the details of their peculiar structure,\nhe could contain himself no longer.\n\nHe whooped with joy and kissed Amra on the cheek and danced around\nand around the foredeck while the women stared with embarrassment and\nconcern and the children giggled, all wondering if he'd gone mad.\n\n\"Spaceships! Spaceships!\" he howled in English. \"Dozens of them! It\nmust be an expedition! I'm saved, saved! Spaceships, spaceships!\"\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\nThey were a magnificent sight, those many cones pointing their\nskyscraping noses upward and their spreading landing struts sinking\ninto the soft earth! Their white eternum metal gleamed in the sun,\ndazzling the spectator who happened to catch their radiance full in the\neyes. They were glorious, embodying all the vast wisdom and skill of\nthe greatest civilization of the Galaxy.\n\nNo wonder, thought Green, that I dance and howl while these people look\nat me as if I'm mad, and Amra, tears in her eyes, shakes her head and\nsays something to herself. What can they know of the meaning of those\nsplendors?\n\nWhat, indeed?\n\n\"Hey,\" shouted Green, \"Hey! Here I am! An Earthman! Maybe I look like\none of these barbarians, with my long hair and bushy beard and dirty\nskin, but I'm not. I'm Alan Green, an Earthman!\"\n\nOf course, they couldn't have heard him at that distance, even if\nsomebody had been standing beneath the spaceships to hear him. But he\nhowled with sheer exuberance, not worrying about wasting his breath and\nmaking himself hoarse.\n\nFinally Amra interrupted him.\n\n\"What is the matter, Alan? Have you been bitten by the Green Bird of\nHappiness, which sometimes flies over these plains? Or has the White\nBird of Terror nipped you while you slept last night upon the open\ndeck?\"\n\nGreen paused and looked steadily at her. Could he tell her the truth,\nnow he was so near salvation? It was not that he was worried about her\nor the others stopping him from making contact with the expedition.\nNothing could stop him now, he was sure of that.\n\nIt was just that he hesitated to tell her that he would be leaving her.\nThe idea of hurting her was agony to him.\n\nHe started to speak in English, caught himself, and switched to her\nlanguage. \"Those vessels--they have brought my people from across the\nspace between the stars. I came to this world in just such a vessel,\na spaceroller, you might say. My ship crashed, and I was forced to\ndescend upon this--your--world. Then, I heard that another ship had\nlanded near Estorya and that King Raussmig had put the crew in prison\nand was going to sacrifice them during the Festival of the Sun's Eye.\nI had little time to get to Estorya before that happened, so I talked\nMiran into taking me. That was why I left you, that....\"\n\nHe trailed off because he did not understand the expression upon her\nface. It was not the great hurt he'd expected, nor the wild fury he\nthought might result from his explanation. If anything, she looked\npitying.\n\n\"Why, Alan, whatever are you talking about?\"\n\nHe pointed at the line of spaceships.\n\n\"They're from Terra, my home planet.\"\n\n\"I don't understand what you mean by your home planet,\" she replied\nstill pityingly. \"But those are not spaceships. Those are the towers\nbuilt by the Estoryans a thousand years ago.\"\n\n\"Wha-what do you mean?\"\n\nStunned, he looked at them again. If those weren't starships he'd eat\nthe yacht's canvas. Yes, and the wheels, too.\n\nUnder the swift wind, the 'roller swept closer and closer while he\nstood behind Amra and thought that he'd break into little pieces if his\ntension didn't find some release.\n\nFinally it did find an outlet. Tears welled in his eyes, and he choked.\nHis breast seemed as if it would swell up and burst.\n\nHow cleverly the ancient builders had fashioned those towers! The\nlanding struts, the big fins, the long sweeping lines ending in the\npointed nose, all must have been built with a spaceship as a model.\nThere was no escaping such a conclusion; coincidence couldn't explain\nit.\n\nAmra said, \"Don't cry, Alan. Your people will think you weak. Captains\ndon't weep.\"\n\n\"This captain does,\" he replied, and he turned and walked the length of\nthe yacht to the stern and leaned over the taffrail where no one could\nsee him as he shook with sobs.\n\nPresently he felt a hand upon his.\n\n\"Alan,\" she said gently. \"Tell me the truth. If those had been ships on\nwhich you could leave this world and travel into the skies, would you\nhave taken me along? Were you still thinking that I was not--not good\nenough for you?\"\n\n\"Let's not talk about it now,\" he said. \"I can't. Besides, there are\ntoo many people listening. Later, when everybody's asleep.\"\n\n\"All right, Alan.\"\n\nShe released his hand and left him alone, knowing that that was what\nhe wanted. Mentally, he thanked her for it, because he knew what it\nwas costing her to exercise restraint. At any other time, in a like\nsituation, she would have thrown something at him.\n\nAfter he had calmed down somewhat he returned to the helm and took\nover from Miran. From then on he was too busy to think much about his\ndisappointment. He had to report to the port officer and tell his\nstory, which took hours, for the officer called in the others to hear\nhis amazing tale. And they questioned Miran and Amra. Green anxiously\nlistened to the merchant's account, fearful that the fellow would\ndisclose his suspicions that Green was not what he claimed to be. If\nMiran had any such intentions, however, he was saving them for their\narrival in Estorya itself.\n\nThe officers all agreed that they had heard many wonderful stories\nfrom sailors but never anything to match this. They insisted upon\ngiving a banquet for Miran and Green. The result was that Green got\na much-needed and desired bath, hair cut and shave. But he also had\nto endure a long feast in which he had to stuff himself to keep from\noffending his hosts and also was forced to enter a drinking contest\nwith some of the younger blades of the post. His Vigilante could handle\nenormous amounts of food and alcohol, so that Green appeared to the\nsoldiers to be something of a superman. At midnight the last officer\nhad dropped his head upon the table, dead drunk, and Green was able to\nget up and go to his yacht.\n\nUnfortunately he had to carry the fat merchant out on his shoulders.\nOutside the banquet room he found a few rickshaw boys standing around\na fire, huddled together, waiting for a customer so drunk he wouldn't\nfear thieves or ghosts. He gave one of them a coin and told him to\ndeliver Miran to the yacht.\n\n\"What about yourself, honored sir? Don't you wish to ride home, too?\"\n\n\"Later,\" said Green, looking up past the fort and at the hills behind\nit. \"I intend to take a walk to clear my head.\"\n\nBefore the rickshaw men could question him further he plunged into the\ndarkness and began striding swiftly toward the highest peak upon the\nisland.\n\nTwo hours later he suddenly appeared in the moonlight-drenched\nwindbreak, walked past the many vessels tied down for the night and\ncrawled aboard his own yacht. A glance around the deck convinced him\nthat everybody was sleeping. He stepped softly past the prostrate forms\nand lay down by Amra. Face up, his hands behind his head, he stared at\nthe moon, a thoughtful expression upon his face.\n\nAmra whispered, \"Alan, I thought you were going to talk to me tonight.\"\n\nHe stiffened but did not turn his head to look at her.\n\n\"I was, but the officers kept us up late. Didn't Miran get here?\"\n\n\"Yes, about five minutes before you did.\"\n\nHe rose on one elbow and looked searchingly at her. \"_What?_\"\n\n\"Is there anything strange about that?\"\n\n\"Only that he was so drunk he'd passed out and was snoring like a\npig. The fat son of an _izzot_! He must have been faking! And he must\nhave....\"\n\n\"Must have what?\"\n\nGreen shrugged. \"I don't know.\"\n\nHe couldn't tell her that Miran must have followed him up into\nthe hills. And that if he had the fellow must have seen some very\ndisturbing things.\n\nHe stood up and gazed intently at the dark forms stretched out here\nand there. Miran was sleeping upon a blanket behind the helm. Or was\npretending to do so.\n\nShould he kill him? If Miran turned him in to the authorities in\nEstorya....\n\nHe sat down again and fingered his dagger.\n\nAmra must have guessed his thoughts, for she said, \"Why do you want to\nkill him?\"\n\n\"You know why. Because he could have me burned.\"\n\nShe sucked her breath in with a hiss.\n\n\"Alan, it can't be true! You can't be a demon!\"\n\nTo him the accusation was so ridiculous that he didn't bother to\nanswer. He should have known better, because he was well aware of how\nseriously these people took such things. However, he was thinking so\nfuriously about what he could do to forestall Miran, that he completely\nforgot about her. Not until he heard her muffled sobs did he come out\nof his reverie. Surprised, he said, \"Don't worry. They're not going to\nburn me.\"\n\n\"No, they're not,\" she said, choking on every other word. \"I don't care\nif you _are_ a demon. I love you, and I'd go to hell for you or with\nyou!\"\n\nIt took him a few seconds to understand that she did believe he _was_\na demon and that it made no difference to her. Or, rather, she was\ndetermined to ignore the difference. What a sacrifice of her natural\nfeelings she must have made for him! She, like everybody upon this\nworld, had been trained from childhood to develop a fierce disgust\nand horror of devils and to be always upon her guard for them when\nthey appeared in human form. What an abyss she had to cross in order\nto conquer her deep revulsion! In a way, her feat was greater than\ncrossing the chasm between the stars.\n\n\"Amra,\" he said, deeply touched, and he bent down to kiss her.\n\nTo his surprise she turned her face away.\n\n\"You know my lips don't belch fire, like the devils' in the legends,\"\nhe said, half-jestingly, half-pityingly. \"Nor will I suck your soul\ninto my mouth.\"\n\n\"You have already done that,\" she said, still not facing him.\n\n\"Oh, Amra!\"\n\n\"Yes, you have! Else why should I follow you when you deserted me\nto run away on the _Bird_? And why should I still want to follow\nyou, to be with you, even if those towers had turned out to be your\nwhat-do-you-call-'em? and you had sailed away into the skies on them?\nWhy would any decent human woman want to do that? Tell me!\"\n\nShe, too, rose on an elbow, her face now turned to him. He scarcely\nrecognized her, her features were so twisted and her skin was so livid.\n\n\"A hundred times during this voyage I've wished you would die. Why?\nBecause then I wouldn't have to think about the time to come when you\nwould leave this world forever, leave _me_ forever! But when you were\nin danger, then I almost died, too, and I knew I didn't really wish\nyour death. It was just wounded pride on my part. And I couldn't face\nthe moment of your departure! Or the fact that you must come from a\nsuperior race, a people more like gods than demons!\n\n\"Oh, I didn't know what to think! Whether you were a devil, or a god,\nor just a man who was somehow more of a man than any I knew. I could\nignore such things as your wounds healing up faster than they should\nand scar tissues disappearing. But I couldn't ignore your knowledge\nthat Aga would be killed if she touched that wall in the room on the\ncannibals' island. Nor the fact that your teeth grew back in after\nthey were knocked out during the escape from the island. Nor your too\nobvious interest in those two demons held prisoner in Estorya. Or....\"\n\n\"Not so loud, Amra,\" he interrupted. \"You'll wake everybody up.\"\n\n\"All right, all right. Better to keep quiet and pretend to be stupid.\nBut I can't, I'm not built that way. So ... what are you going to do,\nAlan?\"\n\n\"Do? Do?\" he repeated miserably. \"Why, somehow or other I'm going to\nfree those two poor devils and escape in their spaceship.\"\n\n\"Devils? Then they _are_ demons!\"\n\n\"Oh, no, that was just a manner of speaking. I said poor devils because\nof what they must have gone through in that barbarous prison. They\nmight as well have been in the hands of the cannibals as at the mercy\nof the priests of this wretched planet.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's what you really think of us, isn't it? That we're all\nmurderous, dirty and stinking savages.\"\n\n\"Oh, not all of you,\" he replied. \"You're not, Amra. By any standards,\nyou're a wonderful woman.\"\n\n\"Then why can't...?\"\n\nShe bit her lip and turned away from him. She would not humble herself\nby asking him to take her with him. It was up to him to make the offer.\n\nGreen did not know what to say, though he knew that it was necessary to\nsay something at once.\n\nHe just could not make up his mind as to how she would fit into Earth\ncivilization.\n\nHow could he teach her that if somebody whom you didn't like differed\nwith you, you just didn't try to tear them apart? Or that if the person\nyou hated was too powerful for you to settle matters with personally\nyou didn't resort to professional assassins?\n\nHow could he teach her to love the same things he did, the music and\nliterature of his own culture? Her roots were in an entirely different\nculture. She couldn't possibly understand what he understood, thrill to\nthat which thrilled him, catch the subtleties that he caught, see what\nlay behind the nuances of his civilization. She'd be a stranger in a\nworld not made for her.\n\nOf course, he thought, there were plenty of women upon Earth and her\nstar-colonies who didn't share his culture, even if they'd been brought\nup in it. But their case was simply a matter of taste. And they could\nstill share a certain amount with him, just because they'd breathed the\nsame atmosphere and talked the same words as he. Not that he would have\ncared to live with them, because he wouldn't. But Amra, desirable in so\nmany ways, just would not understand what was taking place around her\nor in the minds of those she would have to live with.\n\nHe looked down at Amra. Her back was turned, and she seemed to be\nbreathing the easy breath of deep sleep. Though he doubted very much\nthat she could be sleeping, he decided to accept things as they looked.\nHe wouldn't answer her now, though he knew that when morning came her\neyes would be asking the same question, even if she didn't voice it.\n\nAt least, he thought, she'd been diverted from her curiosity about what\nhe'd been doing that night. That was something. He didn't want anybody\nto know about that. Not until the time for action came.\n\nProvided, that is, that he could do anything even then. He'd discovered\ncertain things tonight that could mean his salvation if he could\nutilize them.\n\nThat was the rub, as some poet or other had once said.\n\nWondering just who had originated that saying, he fell asleep.\nWoolgathering had always been a favorite occupation of his when people\nleft him alone to do it. That was the rub. They didn't.\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\nShortly after dawn the yacht set sail and sped toward Estorya, a\nhundred miles west. The breeze was a strong thirty-five miles an\nhour, precursor of the violent winds that roared across the Xurdimur\nduring the rainy season. Green set every inch of sail he had and took\nover the helm himself. Steering was not as simple as it had been,\nfor traffic was getting heavy. In an hour he saw no less than forty\n'rollers, ranging in size from small merchants not much larger than\nhis own craft to tremendous three-decker 'rollers-of-the-line from\nfar-off Batrim, convoying even larger merchant vessels, high-pooped and\nrichly decorated. Then, as they came to within fifty miles of their\ndestination, small pleasure yachts appeared in increasing numbers. And\nby the time they saw the white rocket-shaped towers that stretched from\nhorizon to horizon, Green was sweating at the manner in which craft\nwere shooting back and forth in front of him.\n\nMiran said, \"The entire nation is surrounded by these white towers and\nby many fortresses interspersed between them. Inside the great circle\nof towers the Estoryans have many rich farms on the plains. The city\nproper, however, is built on three roaming islands that were captured\nby their magic many centuries ago.\"\n\nGreen raised his eyebrows at this information. \"Indeed? And where is\nthe vessel that brought the two demons down from the skies?\"\n\nMiran looked blankly at the Earthman, though he knew well enough that\nhe was keenly interested in the so-called demons.\n\n\"Oh, it is located close to the palace of the king himself, but not on\nthe hills. It landed on the plain.\"\n\n\"Hmm. And the strangers will be burned during the Festival of the Eye\nof the Sun?\"\n\n\"If they have lived, they will be.\"\n\nGreen didn't like to think about their dying. If they had, then his\nproblem was solved. He stayed upon this planet and did the best he\ncould here.\n\nThere was one thing he had to admit. That was that having Amra as his\nwife made such an event not so calamitous as it might have been. She'd\nkeep him so interested that time would pass swiftly, even on this\nbarbarous place.\n\nIn that case, he thought, why was he hesitating about taking her to\nEarth, if he got the chance? No matter where he was she'd see that life\nwas a whirlpool of action. And she'd only begun to disclose the deeps\nwithin her. Give her an education, and what a creature might evolve!\n\nWhat's the matter with you, Green? he said to himself. Don't you know\nyour own mind? Are you so capable at handling physical events but a\ncomplete muckup when it comes to psychical? Why...?\n\n\"Look out!\" cried Miran, and Green threw the helm hard aport to avoid\ncrashing into a small freighter. The captain, standing on the foredeck\nbehind his own helmsman, leaned over the rail and shook his fist at\nGreen and cursed. Green cursed back but after that he didn't allow\nhimself to begin thinking about Amra until he had steered the 'roller\ninto the 'break.\n\nThe rest of the day he was busy getting cleared with the port\nauthorities. Fortunately he had a letter from the officer of the\nisland-fortress. It explained why he happened to be in possession of\na foreign craft and also recommended that Green be given a chance to\nsign up in the Estoryan 'roller-fleet if he wished. Even so, he had to\ntell his story so many times to an admiring and amazingly credulous\naudience that it was dusk before he could get free. Outside the customs\nbuilding he found Grizquetr waiting for him.\n\n\"Where's your mother?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, she knew you'd be tied up for a long time, so she went ahead and\ngot a room in an inn. They're very hard to get during the Festival,\nalmost impossible. But you know Mother,\" said Grizquetr, winking. \"She\ngets what she goes after, every time.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm afraid so. Well, where's this inn?\"\n\n\"It's clear across town, but it's within sight of the wall that's built\naround the demons' skyship.\"\n\n\"Wonderful! Rooms must be twice as difficult to get there as on the\nedge of town. How did Amra do it?\"\n\n\"She gave the innkeeper three times his asking price, which was high\nenough. And he found a pretext to quarrel with a man who had long ago\nreserved a room, threw him out and gave it to us!\"\n\n\"Ah? And where did she get this money?\"\n\n\"She sold a ruby to a jeweler who kept shop close to the 'break. He's\nsort of shady, I guess, and he didn't give Mother what the ruby was\nworth.\"\n\n\"Now, where would she get a ruby or any kind of jewel?\"\n\nGrizquetr grinned crookedly but delightedly. \"Oh, I imagine that a\ncertain fat one-eyed merchant-captain who shall remain nameless must\nhave had one or two rubies within that bag he keeps inside his shirt.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can imagine. The question that alarms me is how did she get it\noff Miran? He'd sooner lose a quart of blood than one of his precious\njewels. And he'd notice its loss quicker than he would the blood.\"\n\nGrizquetr looked thoughtful. \"I really don't know. Mother didn't say.\"\n\nHe brightened with a smile and said, \"But I'd _like_ to know how she\ndid it! Maybe she'll teach me some day.\"\n\n\"She seems to have a lot to teach both of us,\" said Green.\n\nHe sighed. \"Well, I'm eternally indebted to her. No getting out of it.\nLet's call a rickshaw and see what kind of a place she has selected.\"\n\nOnce both had settled in the high-backed chair of their vehicle, and\nthe two men who pulled it had begun their slow trotting through the\ncrowded streets, Green said, \"Have you any idea where Miran is?\"\n\n\"Some. He was detained by the port-officers, too, because he had to\nexplain what had happened to his 'roller. Then he called a rickshaw and\nleft in a big hurry. He had an officer with him. Not a naval officer. A\nsoldier from the palace, one of the King's Own.\"\n\nGreen felt a sinking sensation. \"Already? Tell me, does he know where\nwe are staying?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. When I saw him coming out of the customshouse, I hid behind\na bale of cotton. Mother had told me to stay out of his sight. She\nexplained how treacherous he is, and how he hates you because he thinks\nyou brought all his bad luck upon him.\"\n\n\"That's only the half of it,\" Green replied. He was silent for a\nwhile, thinking, his gaze roving idly over the crowds. There were many\nforeigners in town, sailors from every nation that had a border on\nthe Xurdimur, pilgrims who belonged to the far-flung cult of the Fish\nGoddess and had come here for the Festival. The majority, however,\nwere Estoryans, a fairly tall people, brown or red-haired, green or\nblue-eyed, with big noses, thick lips and a slight epicanthic fold.\nThey spoke a guttural polysyllabic semi-analytic language. They wore\nbroad-rimmed hats shaped like open umbrellas, tight-necked shirts with\nlong stringties and pants that were skin-tight from crotch to knee,\nthen ballooned out into many ruffles. Little bells tinkled on their\nankles, and the women carried canes. All had a fish, a star, or a\nrocket-shaped tower tattooed on their cheeks.\n\nAlong the narrow winding street were many little shops, flowering with\na variety of articles. Green was intrigued by the magical charms being\nhawked everywhere. Many of these were little towers, replicas of the\nlarge ones that encircled the country. On Earth they could have passed\nfor toy spaceships. He bought one. It was made of white-painted wood\nand was about seven inches long. The big flaring fins and landing\nstruts were well reproduced, but there weren't any of the fine details\nthat he could have found in such a toy on Earth. There were no holes\nin the stern or nose for the drive-exhaust or any indications of doors\nor detector apparatus.\n\nHe gave it to Grizquetr and leaned back to do some more thinking.\nThe charm hadn't disappointed him, because he had not expected any\nmore than what he'd seen. If, in the beginning, those models had been\nfurnished with every little detail, the passage of many thousands of\nyears would have seen them blunted and reduced to their present state\nof fuzzy symbolic images. Time ate down to the skeleton of things.\n\nHe wondered how the charm could have survived up to the present,\nbecause it surely must have been over twenty thousand years ago that\nthe prototype, the real spaceship, disappeared and man sank back to\nsavagery again. Then, why had this lasted here, whereas it had not done\nso on other planets, Earth included?\n\nAbruptly, he noticed that his rickshaw had stopped.\n\n\"A procession of priests, going to the palace of the King, where\nthey will spend all night preaching to the demon,\" said one of their\nrickshaw boys. He yawned and stretched. \"I suppose that it will be a\nfine burning, since the priests have predicted that the sun will shine\nat high noon. They are safe doing that, as it has not failed to shine\non Festival Day for a thousand years.\"\n\nGreen leaned forward, his hands gripping the sides of his chair, and\nsaid, \"Demon? You meant demons, didn't you? Weren't there two of them?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, there were. But one died two days ago. Hung himself, I heard,\nthough I can't swear to it since the priests have released no details.\nThe holy ones have been giving the demons a rough time.\"\n\n\"Demons?\" said Grizquetr, snorting with disbelief and disgust. \"Doesn't\nthe very fact that one killed himself prove they're not fiends?\nEveryone knows that a demon can't kill himself.\"\n\n\"Quite true, my small friend,\" replied the taxi man. \"The priests have\nadmitted their error. They are truly sorry--so they say.\"\n\n\"Then aren't they letting the other man loose?\"\n\n\"Oh no. Because _he_ may still be a demon. Tomorrow, at high noon, the\nprisoner goes under the Sun's Eye and there meets the only death a\ndemon may know. _By fire he was born, by fire he shall perish._ Chapter\nTwenty, Verse Sixty-Two. Or so I remember the High Grauchning saying in\nhis sermon yesterday. Myself, I'm not much for reading. Too busy making\na living, running my legs off, killing myself so my wife and kids may\neat and have clothes on their backs.\"\n\nGreen scarcely heard the garrulous rickshaw man, so shocked was he at\nthe news. Had he been too late? What if the man who'd died was the\npilot and the other one unable to handle the ship?\n\nThe rest of the ride he was sunk in such deep gloom he hardly saw any\nof the many sights that Grizquetr kept pointing out. But he did rouse\nwhen the boy said, \"Look, Father, there's the King's palace, on top of\nthe hill! Beyond that is the ship of the demon. You can't see it from\nhere, but you will tomorrow when you go to the burning.\"\n\n\"Don't be so heartless,\" said Green, but he looked carefully at the\ngreat marble structure that rambled all over the hill. Somewhere below\nthat, probably filled with dirt, undoubtedly forgotten, was just such\nan entrance as he'd found on the island of the cannibals. He'd also\ndiscovered a similar one upon the fortress of Shimdoog, the night\nbefore when he'd gone exploring and Miran had followed him.\n\nThe palace, he thought, looked quite romantic and beautiful, enveloped\nin a dim red haze cast by the setting sun, which lay directly behind\nit. Probably it would look different in the harsh glare of day, when\nthe dirt and garbage would be so apparent.\n\nThe area in which Amra had rented the room was one which had once\nbelonged to the rich and the noble but had decayed when the aristocracy\nmoved their homes elsewhere. The inn before which the rickshaw boys\nstopped was a three-story pile of granite blocks. It had an enormous\nporch and six huge pillars in the images of the Fish Goddess. Green\ncould not help admiring the building even in its present state of\ndecay, because he knew that it must have cost a fortune to build it.\nThe granite would have had to be transported by 'roller across the\nXurdimur, since there would be no stone in this neighborhood. He\nimagined that the landlord charged high rents and that Amra must have\npaid a pretty price indeed if she'd given him three times the usual\namount. One thing you could say for her, when she traveled she did it\nin style.\n\nThe caryatids of the Fish Goddess also interested him, and at another\ntime he'd have examined them closely by the light of the torches in\nthe hands of the servants standing by them. The cult of the Goddess\nindicated that the original Estoryans must have migrated from the\noceanside to the center of the vast and level plains. And here they\nmust have built this imposing city, which was to become such a great\nfocus of trade. Its central location made it a great clearing house for\ngoods from every country bordering the Xurdimur.\n\nHe wondered whether it was pure accident that they had brought with\nthem the charms in the shapes of spaceships? And if they'd also\naccidentally discovered that towers modeled after the charms would stop\nthe roaming islands?\n\nWhatever the answer, it lay buried in the prehistoric.\n\n\"Hurry up,\" said Grizquetr, pulling on Green's hand. \"Mother has a\nsurprise for you, but don't tell her I told you.\"\n\n\"That's nice,\" replied Green absently, his mind still upon the news\nof the Earthman's death. Hang it all, why must he always be kept in\nsuspense, must always be improvising from moment to moment, always in\nthe dark, never knowing what was coming next nor what he was going to\nhave to do? Oh, for one day of peace and assurance!\n\n\"Father!\"\n\n\"What, what?\" said Green, startled out of his reverie and stopping\nhalfway up the steps to the porch. Suddenly something black and small\nlaunched itself at him and landed on his shoulder.\n\n\"Lady Luck! Why are you shivering so?\"\n\n\"Better run, Dad!\" said Grizquetr. \"There's Miran coming out of the\ndoor! And soldiers behind him!\"\n\nHe ended with a wail, \"_Motherr-r-r-r!_\"\n\nThe sight of Amra, Inzax, and the children being marched out between\nmusketmen was enough for Green. He turned away and spoke softly but\nsavagely.\n\n\"Keep your backs to them! Don't look back! We're far enough away in the\ndark so they might not recognize us. Especially in this crowd!\"\n\nA minute later he and the boy and the cat were looking around the\ncorner of a large building. They saw the soldiers commandeer a rickshaw\nand put the prisoners in it. Then four of them walked behind the\nvehicle as it was pulled away.\n\n\"They--they'll be put in the Tower of the Grass Cat,\" said the boy,\nshaking with fury. \"Oh, that devil Miran! That fat old devil! He's the\none who's accused Mother of witchcraft! I know! I know!\"\n\n\"He didn't accuse her,\" said Green, \"but me. She's guilty through\nassociation with me. Well at least we'll know where they are for a\nwhile.\"\n\n\"There go Miran and the soldiers back into the hotel.\"\n\n\"Waiting for us,\" said Green. \"They'll have a long wait. Well, let's\ngo. First things first. We'll buy a ticket, see the ship. I have to\nknow where it's located, what type it is, et cetera. Luckily I've\nenough money on me to do that. But we'll be broke then. You have any?\"\n\n\"Ten _axar_.\"\n\n\"That's not much, but it's enough to pay for a rickshaw ride to the\nwindbreak.\"\n\nAt the box-office, Green bought two tickets, then walked up the steep\nflight of steps with Grizquetr. At the top he found himself in a large\ngroup standing on a platform beneath a wooden roof. This was for the\ncurious who wanted to get a preview of the demons' vessel. Tomorrow the\ngates would be opened to admit a vast crowd, who would sit on the hard\nwooden seats of the amphitheatre that had been built fairly close to\nthe ship.\n\nThe ship itself was an Earth naval vessel, a two-man scout. It pointed\nits needle nose upward, resting upon eight jetstruts, gleaming in the\nmoonlight. Its naval insignia, a green globe crossed with rocket and\nolive branch, was a smudge in the shadows. Nevertheless he could make\nit out. He felt his breast swell and he choked with homesickness.\n\n\"Ah, so near, yet so far,\" he murmured. \"Even if I get to you, then\nwhat? What if the poor devil of a survivor turns out to be a navigator?\nStill, he ought to know enough to get her off the ground and into\nspace. And from there on, with interstellar drive, we ought to be able\nto get home, somehow.\"\n\nHe sounded plaintive, even to himself, for he knew how vast space was\nand how complicated astromathematics was. And of course there was no\nguarantee that the Earthman would even be a navigator. He might just be\nan officer or perhaps a civilian official who was being ferried in one\nof the swifter small ships.\n\nThen there was the awful possibility that the vessel might have landed\nhere because there was something wrong with it, and that it could not\nrise again even if it had a full crew. In fact, that was the most\nlogical explanation.\n\nHe sighed and turned to the boy.\n\n\"This may be for nothing, but we can't just sit down and watch. Let's\ntake off for the windbreak.\"\n\n\"What are we going to do there?\" asked Grizquetr, as they walked down\nthe steps.\n\n\"Well, we're not going back to the yacht,\" Green answered. \"Soldiers'll\nbe waiting there to arrest us. No, we'll go to the other side of the\n'break. Stealing another 'roller isn't going to get us in any more\ntrouble than we're already in.\"\n\nThe boy's eyes widened. \"What're we doing that for?\"\n\n\"We must return to the island-fortress of Shimdoog.\"\n\n\"What? Why, that's a hundred miles away!\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. And we won't be able to make the speed going back that we\ndid coming. We'll have to do quite a lot of tacking to sail against the\nwind, and that'll eat up our time. But there's nothing else to do.\"\n\n\"If you say so, father, I believe you. But what is there on Shimdoog?\"\n\n\"Not on. _In._\"\n\nGrizquetr was a bright lad. He was silent for a minute, so silent Green\ncould imagine he heard the wheels turning within his head. Then he\nsaid, \"There must be a cave on Shimdoog like the one on the cannibals'\nisland. And you must have gone into it that night we stayed in the\n'break. I remember waking up and hearing you and Mother say something\nabout your being gone and about Miran following you.\"\n\nGrizquetr paused, then said, \"If there is a cave-entrance there, why\nhaven't other people gone into it?\"\n\n\"Because it has been declared taboo, off limits, by the priests of\nEstorya. It was done so long ago that I imagine that the priests\nthemselves have forgotten why they forbade its access to men. But it's\nnot hard to reconstruct the historical causes. Once, I suppose, the\nisland was populated by cannibals. At the time the Estoryans captured\nthe island they exterminated the aborigines. They found the cave mouth\nwas a holy place for the savages. So, thinking that it held demons--and\nit does, in a way--they built a wall around it and set up a statue of\nthe Fish Goddess, facing inward and holding in her hand a symbol to\nrestrain the imprisoned fiends from breaking loose. That symbol, of\ncourse, is the same charm that is sold on the streets of Estorya, that\ncircumscribes the country and the island of Shimdoog. It is the same as\nthe spaceship that landed near the King's palace.\"\n\nGreen hailed a rickshaw and continued his account while they rode\nthrough the still-crowded streets. There was so much noise that he felt\nquite safe talking, provided he kept his voice soft.\n\nBy the time they had reached the northern end of the windbreak, Green\nhad told the boy all he thought he should hear at that time. If, later\non, his trip to Shimdoog proved successful he would enlighten him even\nmore.\n\nFor the present he was concerned with the problem of getting\ntransportation. Fortunately they found almost at once a nice little\nyacht with speedy lines and a tall mast. The craft must have belonged\nto a wealthy man, for a watchman sat close to it before a little fire\njust outside his shed. Green walked up to him, and when the fellow\nrose, his hand suspiciously resting upon his spear, Green struck him\non the jaw, then followed with a hard right to the pit of his stomach.\nGrizquetr completed the job by hitting him over the head with a length\nof pipe he'd picked up off the ground.\n\nGreen emptied the handbag of the watchman and was pleased to see\nseveral coins of respectable denominations.\n\n\"Probably his life-savings,\" he said. \"I hate to rob him, but we\nhave to have money. Grizquetr, do you remember those slaves who were\ndrinking and gambling outside the Striped Ape Inn? Run to them and\noffer them six _danken_ if they'll tow us out of the 'break. Tell them\nwe're paying them so much because it's so late at night, and also to\nkeep their mouths shut.\"\n\nGrinning, the boy ran off. Green hauled the limp body of the\nunconscious watchman behind the hut, bound and gagged him and threw a\ntarpaulin over him.\n\nGrizquetr returned, leading six noisy and reeling men, sturdily built,\nwith legs and backs big-muscled from hauling 'rollers.\n\nAt first Green thought he ought to try to make them keep quiet, then\ndecided that it would look more natural if he let them talk as loudly\nas they wished. There was a festive air over the city tonight, and more\nthan one yacht was going out for a moonlight cruise.\n\nOnce out on the plain, Green threw the promised money to the slaves and\ncried, \"Have a good time!\" To himself he muttered, \"Because tomorrow\nmay be your last day.\" Already, he had a presentiment of what might\nhappen if he succeeded in tonight's work. There was no telling what\nforces he might be unloosing. As he'd said to the boy, there were\ndemons imprisoned in the bowels of the island of Shimdoog.\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\nJust before dawn the yacht coasted to a stop outside the high stone\nwalls of the north side of the island of Shimdoog. Green had dropped\nthe sail and, judging his speed exactly, had steered the craft until\nits side was almost scraping the wall. As soon as the roller stopped,\nGreen put Lady Luck in a bag tied to his belt and cautioned her to keep\nquiet. Then he began climbing up the rungs nailed to the mast. The boy\nfollowed him, and both crawled out upon the spar. Green tied one end of\na long rope around the end of the spar. Then he let himself down on it\nto the ground on the other side of the wall.\n\nAfter the boy had also descended they paused for a moment, crouched,\nready to run at the first sign they'd been seen. But there was no\noutcry.\n\nThe big moon, though dropping to the horizon, was bright enough for\nthem to make good progress. Green led the way up a series of hills,\nheading in a circuitous fashion toward the highest. Twice he had to\nstop and warn Grizquetr about the towers ahead, where sentries were\nstationed. Lady Luck seemed to know she should be silent. Her eyes\nglowed and her teeth flashed, but she was only making a soundless snarl.\n\nThey saw the fires of the guards and heard their muttered voices,\nbut none saw them. It was doubtful that the sentinels ever did look\nout, for they did not think that any man in his right senses would be\nroaming about in the darkness, where it was well known that ghosts and\ndemons waited for foolish mortals.\n\nJust before they began climbing the slope of the peak that was their\ngoal, Green whispered. \"This island is built much like the first one\nwe encountered. I think that all of these islands are more or less\nsimilar, all being composed of a base of a mile and a half square of\neternum metal or something like eternum. And all covered with rock and\ndirt and trees and vegetation and stocked with birds and beasts. I\nsuppose that the original builders landscaped these craft for aesthetic\nreasons. After all, a sheet of metal with a few metal chambers on\nit doesn't look very pretty and would make a blinding glare in the\nsunshine.\"\n\n\"Uh,\" replied the boy, who didn't understand.\n\n\"Do you know, it's strange that I was right the first time when I\nsarcastically referred to the roaming islands as glorified lawn-mowers?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yes, in the beginning there must have been many more than there are\nnow, enough to keep the vast plains looking neat and well-kept, the\ngrass clipped, the forests prevented from encroaching well-defined\nlimits, and so on. But when there were no longer any maintenance men to\nkeep them going, they stopped, one by one, until at this present time\nthere are perhaps a few hundred. Though, I don't know, there may be\nmore. Anyway, whenever one did run down or break down for some reason\nor other it was soon erased by a still-functioning island.\"\n\n\"Erased?\"\n\n\"Yes, for it's quite obvious to me that the islands not only cut grass,\nthey kept the plains free of obstructions that weren't supposed to be\nthere. And a dead island would constitute just such a hazard.\"\n\nGrizquetr spoke in a thin voice, \"Perhaps, Father, I may yet understand\nyou. I must be stupid.\"\n\n\"Far from it. You'll learn in time. Anyway, I should have known what\nthey really were when I heard the tales of the sailors. Remember\nthat one about the big hole made by the meteorite? And how something\nmysterious filled it in and covered it with turf? And then there was\nthe way that wrecked 'rollers would vanish down to the last nut and\nbolt and the skeletons of the dead aboard. And there was the legend\nof Samdroo the Tailor Turned Sailor and what he found in the metal\nchambers inside an island. The great white eye through which he saw\nwhat was outside the island. And the other paraphernalia. They weren't\nthe property of a wicked magician, as the tale would have it. Any\nEarthman would recognize TV and radar and dials and controls.\"\n\n\"Tell me more.\"\n\n\"I will when we get over this wall.\"\n\nGreen had stopped before a barrier of stone, reaching at least forty\nfeet high. A grim crown, it completely encircled the top of the hill.\n\"Once it must have been difficult to scale, but mortar has crumbled\nhere and there, and vines grow all the way up. Follow me. I remember\nexactly the path I took.\"\n\nHe jumped up on a little ledge, seized a thick vine and hauled himself\nup to another minor projection. Unhesitatingly, the boy swarmed up\nafter him.\n\nPanting, they reached the top, where they rested a moment and wiped\nthe blood from their lacerated fingertips. The cat was the only one\nthat seemed unperturbed. Silently, Green pointed out the twenty foot\nhigh statue of the Fish Goddess below, her back turned to them as she\ngestured at the cave mouth with the rocket-shaped charm.\n\nFor the first time Grizquetr seemed scared. Like all his fellows, he\nhad an unhealthy awe for the supernatural. This place, so walled off,\nso utterly ancient-looking, so invested with all the attributes of\ntaboo, so invocative of the horrible tales of demons and angry gods,\ndepressed him. Only his father's seeming indifference to any fiends\nthey might encounter kept him from turning tail and backing down the\nwall.\n\n\"One thing I'll bet, and that is that Miran didn't follow me this far\nbut stayed down on the ground. With that belly of his he'd never have\nmade it; he'd have tumbled off like a big fat bug and been squashed\nlike one, too. Wouldn't that have been awful! However, he didn't have\nto go all the way with me. The very fact that I would dare to enter\na taboo area is enough to condemn me. I should have slit his throat\nwhen Amra told me he'd been shadowing me. But I couldn't do it without\nabsolutely convincing evidence, and even if I'd had that I suppose I'm\ntoo civilized to kill him in cold blood.\"\n\n\"You should have told me how you felt,\" said Grizquetr. \"I would have\nslipped a dagger through the tallow over his ribs.\"\n\n\"No doubt, and so would your mother. Well, down we go.\"\n\nAnd he set the example by throwing his leg over the edge of the wall\nand letting himself down, somewhat gingerly. The descent was even worse\nthan the ascent, but he didn't bother telling the boy that. By the time\nhe found out he'd be at the bottom.\n\nEven so, when he reached ground, he thought that the lad couldn't be\none whit more shaky than he. Forty feet was a long, long way when you\nwere up on top looking down, especially in the moonlight.\n\n\"This is the second time I've done it, but I don't think I'd have guts\nenough for a third time,\" said Green.\n\n\"But we have to climb back out, don't we?\"\n\n\"Oh, we'll have to go over it, but I hope it won't be so high by then,\"\nsaid Green, looking mysterious.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well I hope those stones will all be tumbled to the ground. In fact,\nit's a necessity, if we're to do what I expect to do.\"\n\nHe took the bewildered boy by the hand and led him past the cold and\nsilent statue and into the cave's entrance. \"We could use a light,\" he\nsaid, \"but a torch would have been too awkward to carry up that wall,\nand we can grope our way to the rooms that are lighted.\"\n\nWonder why the passageway wasn't lighted, too? he thought. Or had this\ncave been added by the savages who used to live on the island, so that\nthe _sanctum sanctorum_ would have to be approached through darkness?\nPerhaps it was, the primitives having constructed such a chamber so\nthat the initiate into the religion could go through darkness both\nliteral and symbolical and come into a light that also embraced both\nworlds? He didn't and couldn't know; he could only guess.\n\nBut I can take advantage of what I do have on hand, he said to himself,\ngritting his teeth with determination.\n\nThe dust beneath his feet gave way to clean metal. They rounded a\ncorner and found themselves in a chamber much like the one upon their\nfirst island, except that this had furniture. A skeleton lay in the\nmiddle of the floor, face down. The back of the skull exhibited a great\nhole.\n\n\"He may have been here for a thousand years or more,\" said Green. \"I'd\nlike to know his story. But I never will.\"\n\n\"Do you think the Goddess killed him?\"\n\n\"No, nor the demons either. It was the hand of man struck him down, my\nboy. If it's violent death you're trying to explain, don't drag in the\nsupernatural. There's enough murder in the hearts of humankind to take\ncare of every case.\"\n\nIn the third room Green said, \"There's no wall of dust to stop us. The\nionic charges haven't stopped working. Notice how clean everything is.\nAh, here we are! Before the door!\"\n\nGrizquetr looked puzzled. \"Door? I see only a blank wall.\"\n\n\"That's all I saw too,\" said Green, \"and that is all I would ever have\nseen, if it hadn't been for the tale of Samdroo.\"\n\n\"Let me tell you how you got in!\" chattered the boy excitedly. \"I know\nwhat you were thinking of, what you did. You stood before the wall\nand you made a sign like this on it!\"--He traced a rough outline of a\nrocket against the cool white metal--\"and the wall suddenly slid to one\nside, and you had an entrance. See!\"\n\nA whole section had moved noiselessly into the wall, leaving a round\ndoorway.\n\n\"Yes, I remembered the story of Samdroo and, though it was ridiculous\nto think that it would work, I did what the Sailor did. Remember that\nthe cannibals were after him, and he ran into the cave and came to just\nsuch a blank wall. And he, wishing to protect himself against the evil\nspirits that he was sure lived in the cave, traced the sign that is\nsupposed to prevent them from touching a man. And the door slid open\nand he plunged on into the chambers of the wicked magician, the savages\nhowling frustratedly after him.\n\n\"And,\" continued Green, \"I did just what he did, and the sign proved to\nbe an _Open, O Sesame_ for me.\"\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\"Never mind. The point is that the ancient maintenance men must\nhave used just such a gesture to open the door, or else used it in\nconjunction with other means. And if they did, then they must also have\nbeen repair technicians for the ships that landed here. Perhaps the\nsign of the rocket was a secret symbol for their guild. I don't know,\nbut it sounds reasonable.\"\n\nIgnoring the boy's flood of questions, he walked into a great room.\nIt was more bare than he'd expected when he had found it the first\ntime; it contained four machines or their fuel supplies, all concealed\nin four large square metal containers. In the center of the room was\na chair and an instrument panel. The panel contained six TV windows,\nseveral oscilloscopes, and dials whose purpose he didn't know. But the\ncontrols attached to the arms of the chair seemed simple enough.\n\n\"The only trouble,\" he said, \"is that I don't know where the activating\nswitch is. I tried to find it the other night and couldn't. Yet, it\nmust be so obvious that I'll feel like a fool when I do locate it.\"\n\nVainly he pulled at the little levers set in the arms.\n\n\"My failure to activate this was the main reason I returned to the\nyacht and sailed on to Estorya. Of course, I had to go and find out\njust what the situation was and get a good idea of my plan of campaign.\nPerhaps if I'd stayed here and taken a chance on going into the city\nblind, we'd have been better off. At least, your mother wouldn't now be\nin prison, and we wouldn't have the additional worry of rescuing her.\"\n\nHe rose from the chair and began pacing back and forth.\n\n\"How ironic if I'd come this far and could get no farther! But then,\nwhat else could I expect? It's up to me to solve this, and I'm not\ninfallible, omniscient. It should be functioning as of now. I know\nthat the ring of rocket-shapes has got it paralyzed so it can't act.\nNevertheless, unless it's blown a fuse, gone neurotic from frustration,\nor just worn out, there should be some indication that it is still in\noperation.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Grizquetr. \"How can the island be paralyzed?\"\n\nGreen stopped pacing to gesture at the radarscopes. \"See those? Well,\nthere should be some funny lines squiggling across it, or little dots\nmoving, or arcs sweeping across it. They would be indicating the shapes\nof things in the immediate neighborhood outside the island, and the lay\nof the land. Thus, I imagine that in the ancient days, when it spotted\na rocket shape, which would then have been a genuine spaceship and\nnot a mockup, it would have detoured around it. The whole island was,\nin one of its functions, a field attendant, a scavenger. It removed\nanything from the plain that wasn't supposed to be there. There's why\nthey now attack 'rollers and crush them and disintegrate the parts that\nfall beneath their bases. That also explains why the island is trapped\nby a ring of rocket-shaped towers. The radar detects a complete circle\nand, being unable to molest any object shaped like a rocket, it squats\nin one place until it runs down or the rocket shapes are removed.\n\n\"Of course, it worked automatically. But there were controls for a man\nto operate it when there was a special job to do or if he had to take\nit to another place it ordinarily wouldn't go when on automatic. These\ncontrols must be the ones.\n\n\"The question is, does the island switch itself off and on at certain\nintervals, scanning the area around it to see if the inhibiting objects\nhave gone? If so, there's no telling how long we may have to wait\nbefore its next sweep. And we just can't afford to wait!\"\n\nHe was in agony. As long as he could keep his body and brain in action,\nhe felt he was progressing. But as soon as he had to wait upon some\ninanimate object that he couldn't attack, or came across a seemingly\nunsolvable problem, he was lost. He just didn't have the patience.\n\nLady Luck whined. She was tired of being imprisoned in the bag at\nGreen's waist and felt that she had been a good girl long enough.\n\nAbsently, he lifted her out and put her on the table. She stretched,\nyawned, licked her lips, and then padded across the table. Her tail\nswitched back and forth, and its tip brushed the surface of the\ncentrally located TV screen.\n\nImmediately, a metal ball on the panel glowed red and a sharp whistle\nsounded. Two seconds later, light sprang into being in all of the\nviewers.\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n\"Oh, you beauty, you doll, you lovely Lady Luck! Whatever would I do\nwithout you!\" shouted Green. He started forward to caress the cat but,\nalarmed, she jumped from the table and sped across the room.\n\n\"Come back, come back!\" he called. \"I wouldn't hurt a single one of\nyour lovely black hairs! I'll feed you on beer and fish the rest of\nyour life, and you'll never have to put in a day's work!\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" said Grizquetr.\n\nGreen hugged him, then sat down in the chair.\n\n\"Nothing, except that that wonderful cat showed me how to activate the\nequipment. You do so by brushing your hand across this screen. See,\nI'll bet you do the same when you want to de-activate it!\"\n\nHe touched the screen. The whistle sounded again, the metal ball ceased\nglowing and the screens went dead. Once again he touched it, and life\ncame back.\n\n\"Nothing to it. But chances are I'd never have found out how simple it\nwas.\"\n\nHe began sobering up. \"Down to work. Let's see....\"\n\nThe six TV windows showed them the north, east, south, west, above and\nbelow. As the island was resting upon solid dirt there was, of course,\nnothing to see beneath.\n\n\"We'll remedy that. But first I think we'd better see if these screens\ngive expanding and contracting views.\"\n\nHe fiddled around with the levers. When he depressed the second one,\nthe room jumped. Hastily replacing it in neutral, Green said, \"Well,\nwe know what that one does. I'll bet the people outside think they had\na slight earthquake. They've seen nothing yet. Hmmm. Here, I think, is\nthe one I want.\"\n\nHe twisted a knob on the right-hand arm. All the TV's began narrowing\ntheir field of vision. Reversing the knob, however, made them spread\nout their view, though the objects in them, of course, became smaller.\n\nIt took him five minutes more of cautious testing before he felt\njustified in beginning operations. Then he raised the island off the\nground about twenty feet and rocked it back and forth. Lady Luck leaped\nfor his lap and cowered down in it. Grizquetr, bracing himself against\nthe table, turned pale.\n\n\"Relax, kid,\" called Green. \"As long as you're going along on the ride\nyou might as well enjoy it.\"\n\nGrizquetr grinned feebly, but when his father told him to stand behind\nhim so he, too, could learn how to operate, he gained color and\nconfidence.\n\n\"When we get to Estorya I may have to leave this chamber, and I'll need\nsomebody who can see me through the TV's and answer my signals. You're\nthe candidate. You may be only a kid, but anybody who can calmly talk\nof slipping a knife through a man's ribs has what it takes.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" breathed Grizquetr in all sincerity.\n\n\"Here's what I'll do,\" said Green. \"I'll roll this island back and\nforth until the soldiers are thoroughly panicky and seasick. And the\nwalls around the cave are tumbled down. Then we'll lower to earth again\nand give the rats a chance to desert the ship. But we're no sinking\nship, not us. After everybody that's able has fled to the plains, we'll\ntake off at top speed for Estorya.\"\n\nFascinated, the boy watched the screens and saw the soldiers run off\ninto the early morning light, yelling, their eyes and mouths bulging\nwith horror. Some, wounded, crawled off.\n\n\"I feel sorry for them,\" said Green, \"but somebody's got to get hurt\nbefore this is over and I'd rather it wasn't us.\"\n\nHe pointed to the 'scopes, which still indicated the ring of towers.\n\n\"As long as this island was on automatic it couldn't pass those\ninhibitories. But I've by-passed that with this switch. Now, we go\nahead, and not over the towers, as we could easily do, but through\nthem. I think we've got the weight behind us.\"\n\nThere was a slight shock, the rooms trembled, then the towers before\nthem were gone and they were speeding across the plain. Minute by\nminute Green increased their rate, until he thought they must be making\nabout a hundred and twenty-five miles an hour.\n\n\"Those dials are probably telling me my speed,\" he said to Grizquetr.\n\"But I can't read their alphabet or numerical system. It doesn't\nmatter.\"\n\nHe laughed as he watched 'rollers wheel hard aport or hard to starboard\nin a frenzy to get out of their way. The rails and ratlines were lined\nwith white faces, like rags of terror fluttering in the breeze of the\nisland's passage.\n\n\"If there were time to send a message, I imagine we'd encounter the\nwhole Estoryan fleet,\" said Green. \"What a battle that would be!\nRather, what a massacre, for this craft is built for eating up whole\nnavies.\"\n\n\"Father,\" said Grizquetr, \"we could be king over the whole world, we\ncould rule the Xurdimur and take tribute off every 'roller that sailed!\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose we could, you little barbarian, you,\" replied Green.\n\"But we won't. We're using this for just one purpose, rescuing the\nEarthman and your mother and sisters. After that....\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nHe fell into a reverie as the plain beneath raced past, the white\nsails of the 'rollers blooming from small patches to great flags, then\ndwindling as swiftly.\n\nFinally, rousing from his thoughts, he began to explain a little to the\nboy.\n\n\"You see, many thousands of years ago there was a great civilization\nthat had many machines that would seem to you even more magical than\nthis one. They traveled to the stars and there found worlds much like\nthis one, and they put colonies upon them. They had swift ships that\ncould jump across the vast abyss between these worlds and so keep in\nfairly close touch.\n\n\"But something happened, some catastrophe. I can't imagine what it\ncould be, but it must have happened. While it would be interesting to\nknow the cause, all we can know is the effect. Travel ceased, and as\ntime went by the colonies, which were probably rather small to begin\nwith, lost their civilization. The colonies must have been rather\ndependent upon supplies shipped to them, and they must have had a\nlimited number of highly trained scientists and specialists among\nthem. Anyway, whatever the reason, they relapsed into savagery. And\nit was not until ages had passed that some of these colonies, utterly\nwithout memory of their glorious heritage, except perhaps disguised\nin myth and legend, attained a high technology again. Others stayed\nin savagery; some, like your world, Grizquetr, are in the transition\nstage. Your culture is roughly analogous to the ones that existed on\nEarth between 100 A.D. and 1000 A.D. Those dates mean nothing to you,\nI know, but let me assure you that we present-day Terrestrials regard\nthose times as being, well, rather hazardous and, uh, unreasonable in\ntheir conduct.\"\n\n\"I only half-understand you,\" replied the boy. \"But didn't you say that\nnothing of the wisdom of the ancients survived on your planet? Well,\nwhy had it done so on ours? These islands must be the work of the old\nones.\"\n\n\"Correct! And that's not all. So is the Xurdimur itself.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's obvious to me that this planet must once have been a\ntremendous clearing-house and landing field for spacecraft. These\nplains couldn't be natural; they must have been leveled out by\nmachinery. A laboratory-born grass was planted that had all the\ncharacteristics needed to hold the soil together and keep erosion\naway. Plus the fact that the islands themselves were, you might say,\ncaretakers, and kept the whole field spruced up.\n\n\"Gods! I can imagine what a traffic this planet must have had to build\nsuch a landing-field! Ten thousand miles across! The mind boggles\nbefore the thought. They must have done things on a big scale then.\nWhich makes it all the more difficult to figure out how they could have\ncome to ruin. Will we ever know what force wrecked them?\"\n\nGrizquetr, of course, had even less of an answer than Green. Both\nwere silent for a while; then they cried out simultaneously when the\npointed tips of the white towers surrounding Estorya glittered upon the\nhorizon. One of the screens began flashing a series of cone shapes that\nindicated the towers.\n\n\"If the island were still on automatic it would be forced to go around\nthe entire nation,\" said Green. \"But I'm running it now, and we're\npaying no attention to those towers.\"\n\n\"Knock 'em down!\"\n\n\"That's just what I intend to do. But not right now. Let's see. Wonder\nhow high we can go. Only one way to find out. Upsydaisy!\"\n\nHe pulled back the lever and the island began rising, though still\nmaintaining its horizontal attitude.\n\n\"The ancients, like us moderns, knew how to build anti-gravity\nmachines. And they also must have kept building their spaceships in the\nconventional rocket-form long after there was any need for it. Perhaps,\nthough, they did so in order for the islands to have a more definite\nradar image. Maybe. No one really knows.\"\n\nHe spoke to himself, meanwhile glancing at the screen which showed him\nthe plains and the city of Estorya beneath, ever-dwindling as their\nheight increased.\n\n\"Do me a favor, Grizquetr. Run out to the cave's mouth and tell me if\nthose walls have fallen over. And on your way back, close the door to\nthis room. It's going to get colder very quickly, and the air will be\nthin. But I imagine that this room is equipped with automatic heat and\noxygen. If it isn't I want to find out now.\"\n\nThe boy began running back. \"The walls are all shaken down, all right!\"\nhe said, breathlessly. \"And the Fish Goddess fell over, and her head\nalmost blocks up the cave's mouth. I wriggled through without any\ntrouble. I think you can squeeze through.\"\n\nGreen felt a little sick. That possibility had not occurred to him.\nIt would have been ironic if the statue had completely blocked the\nentrance and he'd had to stay inside until he starved to death. The\nEstoryans, of course, would have considered his death a case of\npoetical justice.... No, he wouldn't have died, either! He'd just have\ngone back to the controls and rolled the island over on one side until\nthe statue's head came loose. But what if the big stone blocks from\nthe tumbled wall had fallen down behind the statue so that they wedged\nher too tightly to be released? He sweated at the thought and glanced\nfondly at the black cat. He wasn't superstitious, not at all, but it\nseemed to him that his luck had been better since she'd adopted him. Of\ncourse, that wasn't the scientific attitude to take; nevertheless he\nfelt comforted just knowing she was around.\n\nBy now, the whole nation of Estorya could be encompassed in one glance.\nAnd the sky was getting darker.\n\n\"We're high enough.\" He stopped the island. \"If anybody didn't get off,\nhe must be dead by now, the air's so thin. And I was right. We do have\nautomatic heat and air-providers. Very comfortable in here. I only wish\nwe had something to eat.\"\n\n\"Why not lower us to the height where I can go out and find food in the\ngarrison's kitchens?\" said Grizquetr. \"Nobody'll be alive to stop me.\"\n\nGreen thought that was an excellent suggestion. He was very hungry,\nfor he always had to eat for two, himself and the Vigilante. If the\nsymbiote within his body provided him with more than normal strength\nand powers, it also demanded fuel on which to operate. And, deprived\nof food, it would survive by living upon Green's tissue. A Vigilante\nwasn't all advantage; it had its dangers.\n\nHe lowered the island to about two thousand feet, set the controls on\nneutral, then decided that it would be safe to go out with the boy.\nJust as he got to the doorway, however, he began feeling uneasy and\nwondering what he would do if, somehow, the door closed and he couldn't\nget it open again. That would be a fine situation, to be stuck two\nthousand feet in the air, and no parachute!\n\nPerhaps he was silly, absurdly apprehensive, but he wasn't going to\ntake any more chances. Grinning sheepishly, he told the boy to go on by\nhimself. He'd decided to study the controls more closely and think out\nhis strategy in finer detail.\n\nWhen Grizquetr returned with a basket loaded with food and wine, Green\nswore at himself for his moment's weakness, then forgot it. After all,\ndiscretion was the better part and all that, and he was only playing it\nsmart.\n\nGreedily, he devoured the food and drank half a bottle of wine, knowing\nthe Vigilante would use alcohol before food and that little of it would\nremain in his bloodstream before being consumed. Between bites, he told\nGrizquetr what he planned.\n\n\"We'll descend as soon as we're finished eating. I'll write a note, and\nyou'll drop it over the side upon the steps of the palace. The note\nwill inform the King he'd better release his prisoners, unharmed, just\noutside the windbreak. There we may easily pick them up and then take\noff like the proverbial big bird. If he refuses we will proceed to\nlower the island upon the Temple of the Fish Goddess, crushing it and\nher jewel-encrusted golden idol. And if he still isn't convinced we'll\nthen smash the palace, not to mention toppling over the entire ring of\ntowers around the country. Of course, before we drop the note we'll\nknock over a few anyway just to show him we're not bluffing.\"\n\nGrizquetr's eyes shone. \"Can the island crush a big building?\"\n\n\"Yes, though I think that there's a possibility we could as easily\ndisintegrate it. I've wondered how the island cut the grass, and can\nonly conclude that it must use a device similar to one we have on\nEarth. It cuts through objects by breaking up their atomic structure\nwith a beam that is only a molecule-thick. When on grass-cutting duty,\nthe island must emit such a beam, and only beneath its base. Of course,\nit must have other machines, too, for cleaning up wreckage and debris\nand other stuff that its memory banks tell it has no business being on\nthe field. But I don't know how to operate these.\"\n\nGrizquetr looked reproachfully at Green.\n\n\"Well, I don't know everything. I'm not a superman, am I?\"\n\nThe boy did not reply, but his expression conveyed the idea that he had\nthought his foster-father was just that. Green shrugged his shoulders\nand sent the boy out to get paper, pen and ink from the garrison. By\nthe time the boy returned, Green had lowered the island to about fifty\nfeet above the palace. He hastily wrote a note, put it in the basket,\nwhich had a cover that could be snapped shut, and told Grizquetr to\nthrow it over the side, aiming at the steps.\n\n\"I know you're going to be worn out with all this running back and\nforth,\" he said, \"but you can do it. You're big and strong.\"\n\n\"Sure I am,\" said the boy. Chest expanded, he dashed from the room,\nalmost tripped going through the door, recovered, and disappeared.\nGrinning, Green began to watch the crowds that had gathered below.\nPresently he saw the basket hurtle toward a group of priests upon the\ngreat stairway. His grin broadened when the group disintegrated in\npanic and several of them lost their footing and rolled down the steps.\n\nHe waited until one of them got enough courage to return and open the\nbasket. Then he lowered the island another twenty feet. At the same\ntime, he saw a cannon being hauled into the square before the palace\nand its nose being raised so that it could fire upon him.\n\n\"Have to give the beggars credit for guts,\" he murmured. \"Or for sheer\nfolly, I don't know which. Well, fire away, friends.\"\n\nThey didn't, because a priest came running to stop them. Evidently, his\nnote, though written in Huinggro, had been translated swiftly enough,\nand the Estoryans were taking no hasty action.\n\n\"While we're waiting for them to make up their minds we'll give them a\ntaste of the feast they can expect if they aren't reasonable,\" Green\nsaid.\n\nHe then proceeded to push over about twenty towers just outside the\nwindbreak. It was great fun, and he'd have liked to knock down a\nhundred or so more, but he was too anxious to find out about Amra and\nthe Earthman. He returned to his former vigil above the palace steps.\n\nImpatiently, he waited for ten minutes that seemed like ten hours.\nFinally, when he could bear it no longer, he growled, \"I'm going to\nsquat on the roof of the Temple and make them hurry up. Do they think\nthis is a diplomatic conference or something, that they can dillydally\nabout like this?\"\n\n\"No, father,\" said Grizquetr. \"There they come! Mother and Paxi and\nSoon and Inzax! And a strange man! He must be the demon!\"\n\n\"Demon, your horned hoof!\" snorted Green. \"That man's as human as I am.\nAnd the poor fellow must have gone through hell. Even from this height\nI can see he looks bad. Look how he has to be supported between two\nsoldiers.\"\n\nAmra and the others, he was happy to note, seemed to be unharmed.\n\nNevertheless he was anxious about them during their ride through the\ncity's streets and out to the windbreak. The Estoryans might have\nplans for a sudden attack, though he didn't see how they could expect\nto surprise him, since from his vantage point, he would notice any\nconcentration of troops immediately. Or, a fanatical priest might take\nit into his head to kill them.\n\nNeither of these possibilities happened. The prisoners were released\noutside the fallen towers, and the soldiers retreated into the city.\nGrizquetr left the control room to guide them onto the island. In\nfifteen minutes he ran back.\n\n\"Here they are, Father! Saved! Now, get off the ground before the\nEstoryans change their minds.\"\n\n\"We're going back,\" replied Green, looking in vain for the others and\nthen deciding that the boy had outstripped them in his haste to report.\nHe shoved the lever forward and the ship--he was beginning to think of\nthe island as a ship--soared toward the cone of the spacecraft, which\nhe could see glittering in the sun inside its wall near the palace.\nWhen Amra and the girls ran into the chamber and wished to throw their\narms around him, he told them he'd be very glad to give each a big warm\nkiss later on. Right now he had work to do.\n\nAmra's smile was replaced by a frown.\n\n\"Do you mean you're still thinking of leaving on the demon's ship?\" she\nsaid harshly.\n\n\"That depends on certain factors about which I don't have enough\ninformation as yet to act on,\" he replied, somewhat stiffly.\n\nThe Earthman limped in. He was a tall, broad-shouldered but emaciated\nman. His bushy beard made his long, lean, big-eared, hawk-nosed face\nresemble Lincoln's.\n\n\"Captain Walzer of the Terrestrial Interstellar Fleet, Intelligence, he\nsaid, weakly.\n\n\"Alan Green, marine food specialist. I've a long story to tell and no\ntime to tell it. I would like to know if you can pilot that spacer and\nif it's in operating condition. Otherwise we might as well forget it\nand go elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm the pilot. Hassan was the navigator and communications\nofficer. Poor devil, he died in agony! Those beasts...!\"\n\n\"I know how you feel, but we've no time to go into that. Is the ship\nready to take off?\"\n\nWalzer sat down and leaned his head wearily to one side. Grizquetr\noffered him wine, and he took two long swallows and smacked his lips\nbefore replying.\n\n\"Ah, that's the first drink I've had for two years! Yes, the bird's\nready to take off on a moment's notice. We'd been on a mission whose\npurpose I can't tell you. Security, you know. We were returning when\nwe encountered this system. Since it's part of our duty to report any\nT-type planet if we've time, we decided to stop off and stretch our\nlegs. We'd been in space so long we were beginning to suffer from\nclaustrophobia and were ready to fly at each other's throats. You know\nhow it is if you've made any very long voyages. And those scouts have\nespecially cramped quarters. They're not made for long trips, but the\nnature of our mission required the use of one ... well, we won't go\ninto that.\n\n\"Anyway, we were wild to breathe fresh air again, to see a horizon, to\nfeel grass beneath our bare feet, to go swimming, to eat freshly killed\nmeat and freshly picked fruit. We rationalized ourselves into the idea\nthat it was our duty to land. We decided on this city because it was\nso conspicuous, stuck out here in the middle of this incredible plain.\nAnd, of course, when we got close enough to see that it seemed to be\nsurrounded by a ring of spaceships we had to enter the city itself\nand inquire about this phenomenon. We were greeted friendlily enough,\nlulled into being off guard, then attacked. The rest of the story you\nknow.\"\n\nGreen nodded and said, \"Here we are. Just above the ship.\"\n\nHe rose from the chair and faced the group. \"But before we take any\nfurther steps I think we ought to thrash out something right now that\nhas been bothering Amra and me. Tell me, Walzer, is there enough room\nfor Amra, Paxi, Soon, Grizquetr and myself? And perhaps for Inzax, if\nshe wished to come along?\"\n\nWalzer's eyes widened. \"No, man, absolutely not! There's barely space\nfor you, let alone anybody else.\"\n\nGreen held out his hands to Amra. \"You see? I was afraid of this all\nthe time. I'll have to go without you.\"\n\nHe paused, swallowed, then said, \"But I'll return! I swear I will! I'll\nget the Interstellar Archaeology Bureau interested in this planet.\nWhen I tell them of the Xurdimur, of the rocket-shaped towers, of the\nislands with their anti-gravity machines, they'll not hesitate a moment\nin organizing an expedition. The chance of solving the mystery of how\nman spread all over the Galaxy in prehistoric times will be too strong\nfor them.\n\n\"And I'll come back with them. And I'll make this planet my life work.\nI've a Ph.D. in ichthyology, and I can get accredited as a scientific\nmember of the expedition. There's no doubt about it!\"\n\nAmra fell into his arms, weeping, crying that she had known all the\ntime that he couldn't leave her. Then in the next breath she was\nswearing that he was just promising to return so he would avoid a scene.\n\n\"I know men well, Alan Green, and I know you, especially. You won't\ncome back!\"\n\n\"Yes, I will, I swear it. If you know men so well, you ought to know\nthat no man who is worthy of being called a man could even think of\nleaving a woman like you.\"\n\nShe smiled through her tears and said, \"That's what I wanted to hear\nyou say. But, oh, Alan, it'll be so long. Won't it take at least two\nyears?\"\n\n\"Yes, at least. But it can't be helped. I'll worry about you while I'm\ngone. Or I would if I didn't know how capable you were.\"\n\n\"I can learn how to run this island,\" she said half-sobbing,\nhalf-smiling. \"By the time you get back I'll probably be Queen of the\nXurdimur. I could contact the Vings, and together we could have the\nwhole plain and every city along its border under our thumbs. And....\"\n\nHe laughed and said, \"That was what I was afraid of.\"\n\nTurning to Walzer, he said, \"Look, you're too weak to consider another\nlong trip immediately. Why don't you just follow this island in your\nship until we get to a safe distance from here, say about a thousand\nmiles due north? We'll live on the island until you get your strength\nback and get over your claustrophobia. I imagine it wasn't helped any\nby being cooped up in that dungeon. When you're ready we'll take off.\nIn the meantime I can be showing Amra and Grizquetr just what can be\ndone with the island. She can be living on it while I'm gone. We'll\ntrap wild life to replace the animals that were strangled when I went\nup too high for them to breathe. She can shuttle back and forth over\nthe Xurdimur, or over the whole planet if she wishes. And she will, I\nhope, stay out of mischief until I get back.\"\n\n\"That's fine,\" said Walzer. \"I'll get in the ship and follow you.\"\n\nThree weeks later, the two Earthmen boarded the scout and closed the\nport behind them, the port that would not open again until they were\non Earth, some four months subjective time away. They sat down in the\ncontrol cabin, and Walzer began pushing buttons and throwing switches.\n\nGreen wiped the sweat from his brow, the tears from his eyes, and said,\n\"Whew!\"\n\n\"A fine woman,\" said Walzer, sympathetically. \"A rare beauty. She has a\ntremendous impact upon one.\"\n\n\"Something like crashing into a planet head-on,\" said Green. \"She\nhas the faculty of wringing out every last bit of energy left in the\nparticular emotion she happens to be feeling at the moment. A great\nactress who believes in her roles.\"\n\n\"Her children are fine children, too,\" Walzer added, slowly and as if\nhe were about to say something that might hurt Green's feelings but was\nanxious not to do so. \"You will be glad to see them again, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course. After all, Paxi's my daughter, I love the others as if they\nwere also mine.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" breathed Walzer. \"Then you _are_ going back to her?\"\n\nGreen didn't express surprise or anger, because he had guessed from\nWalzer's actions just what he was thinking.\n\n\"You can't imagine my wanting to live on that barbaric planet with that\nwoman, can you?\" he said, evenly. \"That after all, there are serious\ngaps in our ways of thinking, in our behavior, in our education. Isn't\nthat what you meant by your statement?\"\n\nWalzer glanced out of the corners of his eyes at Green, then replied\nwarily, \"Well, yes. But you know what you want far better than I do.\"\nHe paused, then added, \"I must say I admire your courage.\"\n\nGreen shrugged.\n\n\"After all I've been through I'm not afraid to take one more chance.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNOW you can get ADVANCE COPIES of the best _New_ Science Fiction Books!\n\n\nYou can be sure of getting the best in adult science fiction--new books\nby the top-ranking authors--when you join the Science Fiction Preview\nClub.

I've read about every theory of\nhistory you can name, and only one makes sense: the one which assumes\nthat every historical event is aimed personally at my very own head.\"\n\nSounds paranoid, doesn't it? But wait. Suppose you had the job given\nto Julian Cole: official historian to a grand-stand Arctic explorer\nwho sets off on a disastrously ridiculous expedition to the far North.\nSuppose _you_ had to cope with the explorer's highly pneumatic wife and\nan assortment of characters one of whom is either a Martian or insane?\nAnd, to cap it all, suppose you held in your hands proof of the biggest\nscience story of the century--and nobody would believe you?\n\nWouldn't you feel just a little like Julian Cole?\n\n_JAMES BLISH is no newcomer to the field of science fiction. Indeed,\nhis is one of the names which has long signified quality to a\ndiscerning audience._ THE FROZEN YEAR _is a highly topical novel set\nagainst the back-ground of the International Geophysical Year. It has\nbiting and acid reflections to make on public relations, the inner\nworkings of large foundations--and demonstrates the surprising and\nwonderful ways in which human beings react to the unexpected._\n\n    Paperbound: 35c\n    Hardbound: $2.75\n\n    BALLANTINE BOOKS, INC.\n    101 Fifth Avenue\n    New York 3, N.Y.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis is an original novel--not a reprint.\n\nPrinted in U.S.A\n\n\nPHILIP JOS� FARMER....\n\ncreated a furore--and an important name in science fiction--with the\npublication of his very first story, The Lovers.\n\nTo his first eager audience, and to the many followers he has gained\nsince then, he now brings a full-length novel--and it happily fulfills\nhis reputation for the unexpected.\n\n\nTHE GREEN ODYSSEY....\n\nis an uproarious, hell-bent adventure story, combining fantasy,\nimagination and science, with a liberal dash of humor. It is in the\nbest tradition of adventure science fiction, a swashbuckling tale of a\nresourceful spaceman who is, however, uneasily aware that he may have\nbeen miscast. Fortunately, he has the assistance of a large, gorgeous,\nenergetic and adoring female who is supremely confident of his ability\nto handle all comers. With her help, that is.\n\nThe tale of their adventures is reading for sheer fun.", "title": "The Green Odyssey"}

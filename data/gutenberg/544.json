{"summary": "The book begins with Anne and Gilbert's wedding, which takes place in the Green Gables orchard. After the wedding, they move to their first home together, which Anne calls their \"house of dreams.\" Gilbert finds them a small house on the seashore at Four Winds Point, an area near the village of Glen St. Mary, where he is to take over his uncle's medical practice.\nIn Four Winds, Anne and Gilbert meet many interesting people, such as Captain Jim, a former sailor who is now the keeper of the lighthouse, and Miss Cornelia Bryant, an unmarried woman in her 40s who lives alone in an emerald-green house and deems the Blythes part of \"the race that knows Joseph.\" Anne also meets her new neighbor, Leslie Moore, who lost her beloved brother and her father, and then was forced by her mother to marry the mean-spirited and unscrupulous Dick Moore at age 16. She felt free for a year or so after Dick disappeared on a sea voyage, but Captain Jim happened upon him in Cuba and brought him home, amnesiac, brain-damaged and generally helpless, and now dependent on Leslie like a \"big baby.\" Leslie becomes friends with Anne, but is sometimes bitter towards her because she is so happy and free, when Leslie can never have what Anne does.\nAnne's former guardian Marilla visits her occasionally and still plays an important role in her life. Marilla is present when Anne gives birth to her first child, Joyce, who dies shortly after birth (as Montgomery's second son did). After the baby's death, Anne and Leslie become closer as Leslie feels that Anne now understands tragedy and pain—as Leslie puts it, her happiness, although still great, is no longer perfect, so there is less of a gulf between them.\nLater in the story, Leslie rents a room in her house to a writer named Owen Ford, who is the grandson of the former owners of Anne's House of Dreams, the Selywns. Owen, who is looking to write the Great Canadian Novel, finds the inspiration he was looking for in Captain Jim's shipboard diary, and transforms it into \"The Life-Book of Captain Jim.\" While Owen is finishing the novel, he and Leslie independently realize they have feelings for each other, but both know they cannot do anything about them. Owen leaves the Island and Leslie is even more miserable being trapped in her marriage to Dick.\nGilbert examines Dick Moore and suspects that if Dick underwent surgery on his skull, he might recover his faculties. Anne and Miss Cornelia are both opposed to the surgery, fearing that Leslie's life will become infinitely harder if Dick returns to himself, but Gilbert feels obligated to let Leslie know there is a chance for Dick. Leslie consents, and Dick undergoes the surgery in Montreal; when he awakens, he reveals that he is actually Dick's cousin George, who accompanied Dick to Cuba and was with him when Dick died of yellow fever twelve years before. George resembles Dick strongly because their fathers were brothers and their mothers were sisters, and both had the same peculiar eye coloring abnormality (heterochromia) by which Captain Jim recognized \"Dick\" in Cuba years before.\nLeslie, abruptly set free by this news, returns home, and considers taking a nursing course to get on with her life. Owen Ford returns to the Island to court Leslie after Miss Cornelia informs him of what has happened, and they become engaged. While this is going on, Anne gives birth to her second child, a healthy son. He is named James Matthew, for Anne's guardian Matthew Cuthbert and for Captain Jim.\nAt the end of the book, Owen Ford's book is published, and Captain Jim dies with a smile on his face after reading his advance copy. Miss Cornelia, thought to be a confirmed spinster, announces that she has decided to marry Marshall Elliott, who may be a Grit but at least is a Presbyterian; she says she could have had him at any time but refused to marry him until he shaved his beard off, which he had refused to do for twenty years until the Grits came into power. Finally, Anne, Gilbert, Jem and their new housekeeper, Susan Baker, move to the old Morgan house in the Glen, later to be named Ingleside. Anne is greatly saddened to leave the House of Dreams, but knows that the little house is outgrown and Gilbert's work as a doctor requires him to live closer to town.\nThis book introduces Susan Baker, the elderly spinster who is the Blythes' maid-of-all-work.\n\n", "full_text": "Anne's House of Dreams\n\n\nby\n\nLucy Maud Montgomery\n\n\n\n\"To Laura, in memory of the olden time.\"\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\nChapter\n\n   1  IN THE GARRET OF GREEN GABLES\n   2  THE HOUSE OF DREAMS\n   3  THE LAND OF DREAMS AMONG\n   4  THE FIRST BRIDE OF GREEN GABLES\n   5  THE HOME COMING\n   6  CAPTAIN JIM\n   7  THE SCHOOLMASTER'S BRIDE\n   8  MISS CORNELIA BRYANT COMES TO CALL\n   9  AN EVENING AT FOUR WINDS POINT\n  10  LESLIE MOORE\n  11  THE STORY OF LESLIE MOORE\n  12  LESLIE COMES OVER\n  13  A GHOSTLY EVENING\n  14  NOVEMBER DAYS\n  15  CHRISTMAS AT FOUR WINDS\n  16  NEW YEAR'S EVE AT THE LIGHT\n  17  A FOUR WINDS WINTER\n  18  SPRING DAYS\n  19  DAWN AND DUSK\n  20  LOST MARGARET\n  21  BARRIERS SWEPT AWAY\n  22  MISS CORNELIA ARRANGES MATTERS\n  23  OWEN FORD COMES\n  24  THE LIFE-BOOK OF CAPTAIN JIM\n  25  THE WRITING OF THE BOOK\n  26  OWEN FORD'S CONFESSION\n  27  ON THE SAND BAR\n  28  ODDS AND ENDS\n  29  GILBERT AND ANNE DISAGREE\n  30  LESLIE DECIDES\n  31  THE TRUTH MAKES FREE\n  32  MISS CORNELIA DISCUSSES THE AFFAIR\n  33  LESLIE RETURNS\n  34  THE SHIP O'DREAMS COMES TO HARBOR\n  35  POLITICS AT FOUR WINDS\n  36  BEAUTY FOR ASHES\n  38  RED ROSES\n  39  CAPTAIN JIM CROSSES THE BAR\n  40  FAREWELL TO THE HOUSE OF DREAMS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nIN THE GARRET OF GREEN GABLES\n\n\"Thanks be, I'm done with geometry, learning or teaching it,\" said Anne\nShirley, a trifle vindictively, as she thumped a somewhat battered\nvolume of Euclid into a big chest of books, banged the lid in triumph,\nand sat down upon it, looking at Diana Wright across the Green Gables\ngarret, with gray eyes that were like a morning sky.\n\nThe garret was a shadowy, suggestive, delightful place, as all garrets\nshould be. Through the open window, by which Anne sat, blew the sweet,\nscented, sun-warm air of the August afternoon; outside, poplar boughs\nrustled and tossed in the wind; beyond them were the woods, where\nLover's Lane wound its enchanted path, and the old apple orchard which\nstill bore its rosy harvests munificently.  And, over all, was a great\nmountain range of snowy clouds in the blue southern sky.  Through the\nother window was glimpsed a distant, white-capped, blue sea--the\nbeautiful St. Lawrence Gulf, on which floats, like a jewel, Abegweit,\nwhose softer, sweeter Indian name has long been forsaken for the more\nprosaic one of Prince Edward Island.\n\nDiana Wright, three years older than when we last saw her, had grown\nsomewhat matronly in the intervening time.  But her eyes were as black\nand brilliant, her cheeks as rosy, and her dimples as enchanting, as in\nthe long-ago days when she and Anne Shirley had vowed eternal\nfriendship in the garden at Orchard Slope.  In her arms she held a\nsmall, sleeping, black-curled creature, who for two happy years had\nbeen known to the world of Avonlea as \"Small Anne Cordelia.\"  Avonlea\nfolks knew why Diana had called her Anne, of course, but Avonlea folks\nwere puzzled by the Cordelia.  There had never been a Cordelia in the\nWright or Barry connections.  Mrs. Harmon Andrews said she supposed\nDiana had found the name in some trashy novel, and wondered that Fred\nhadn't more sense than to allow it.  But Diana and Anne smiled at each\nother.  They knew how Small Anne Cordelia had come by her name.\n\n\"You always hated geometry,\" said Diana with a retrospective smile.  \"I\nshould think you'd be real glad to be through with teaching, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Oh, I've always liked teaching, apart from geometry.  These past three\nyears in Summerside have been very pleasant ones. Mrs. Harmon Andrews\ntold me when I came home that I wouldn't likely find married life as\nmuch better than teaching as I expected.  Evidently Mrs. Harmon is of\nHamlet's opinion that it may be better to bear the ills that we have\nthan fly to others that we know not of.\"\n\nAnne's laugh, as blithe and irresistible as of yore, with an added note\nof sweetness and maturity, rang through the garret.  Marilla in the\nkitchen below, compounding blue plum preserve, heard it and smiled;\nthen sighed to think how seldom that dear laugh would echo through\nGreen Gables in the years to come.  Nothing in her life had ever given\nMarilla so much happiness as the knowledge that Anne was going to marry\nGilbert Blythe; but every joy must bring with it its little shadow of\nsorrow.  During the three Summerside years Anne had been home often for\nvacations and weekends; but, after this, a bi-annual visit would be as\nmuch as could be hoped for.\n\n\"You needn't let what Mrs. Harmon says worry you,\" said Diana, with the\ncalm assurance of the four-years matron.  \"Married life has its ups and\ndowns, of course.  You mustn't expect that everything will always go\nsmoothly.  But I can assure you, Anne, that it's a happy life, when\nyou're married to the right man.\"\n\nAnne smothered a smile.  Diana's airs of vast experience always amused\nher a little.\n\n\"I daresay I'll be putting them on too, when I've been married four\nyears,\" she thought.  \"Surely my sense of humor will preserve me from\nit, though.\"\n\n\"Is it settled yet where you are going to live?\" asked Diana, cuddling\nSmall Anne Cordelia with the inimitable gesture of motherhood which\nalways sent through Anne's heart, filled with sweet, unuttered dreams\nand hopes, a thrill that was half pure pleasure and half a strange,\nethereal pain.\n\n\"Yes. That was what I wanted to tell you when I 'phoned to you to come\ndown today.  By the way, I can't realize that we really have telephones\nin Avonlea now.  It sounds so preposterously up-to-date and modernish\nfor this darling, leisurely old place.\"\n\n\"We can thank the A. V. I. S. for them,\" said Diana.  \"We should never\nhave got the line if they hadn't taken the matter up and carried it\nthrough.  There was enough cold water thrown to discourage any society.\nBut they stuck to it, nevertheless.  You did a splendid thing for\nAvonlea when you founded that society, Anne.  What fun we did have at\nour meetings!  Will you ever forget the blue hall and Judson Parker's\nscheme for painting medicine advertisements on his fence?\"\n\n\"I don't know that I'm wholly grateful to the A. V. I.  S. in the\nmatter of the telephone,\" said Anne.  \"Oh, I know it's most\nconvenient--even more so than our old device of signalling to each\nother by flashes of candlelight!  And, as Mrs. Rachel says, 'Avonlea\nmust keep up with the procession, that's what.'  But somehow I feel as\nif I didn't want Avonlea spoiled by what Mr. Harrison, when he wants to\nbe witty, calls 'modern inconveniences.'  I should like to have it kept\nalways just as it was in the dear old years. That's foolish--and\nsentimental--and impossible.  So I shall immediately become wise and\npractical and possible.  The telephone, as Mr. Harrison concedes, is 'a\nbuster of a good thing'--even if you do know that probably half a dozen\ninterested people are listening along the line.\"\n\n\"That's the worst of it,\" sighed Diana.  \"It's so annoying to hear the\nreceivers going down whenever you ring anyone up.  They say Mrs. Harmon\nAndrews insisted that their 'phone should be put in their kitchen just\nso that she could listen whenever it rang and keep an eye on the dinner\nat the same time.  Today, when you called me, I distinctly heard that\nqueer clock of the Pyes' striking.  So no doubt Josie or Gertie was\nlistening.\"\n\n\"Oh, so that is why you said, 'You've got a new clock at Green Gables,\nhaven't you?'  I couldn't imagine what you meant.  I heard a vicious\nclick as soon as you had spoken.  I suppose it was the Pye receiver\nbeing hung up with profane energy.  Well, never mind the Pyes.  As Mrs.\nRachel says, 'Pyes they always were and Pyes they always will be, world\nwithout end, amen.'  I want to talk of pleasanter things.  It's all\nsettled as to where my new home shall be.\"\n\n\"Oh, Anne, where?  I do hope it's near here.\"\n\n\"No-o-o, that's the drawback. Gilbert is going to settle at Four Winds\nHarbor--sixty miles from here.\"\n\n\"Sixty!  It might as well be six hundred,\" sighed Diana.  \"I never can\nget further from home now than Charlottetown.\"\n\n\"You'll have to come to Four Winds. It's the most beautiful harbor on\nthe Island.  There's a little village called Glen St. Mary at its head,\nand Dr. David Blythe has been practicing there for fifty years.  He is\nGilbert's great-uncle, you know.  He is going to retire, and Gilbert is\nto take over his practice.  Dr. Blythe is going to keep his house,\nthough, so we shall have to find a habitation for ourselves.  I don't\nknow yet what it is, or where it will be in reality, but I have a\nlittle house o'dreams all furnished in my imagination--a tiny,\ndelightful castle in Spain.\"\n\n\"Where are you going for your wedding tour?\" asked Diana.\n\n\"Nowhere.  Don't look horrified, Diana dearest.  You suggest Mrs.\nHarmon Andrews.  She, no doubt, will remark condescendingly that people\nwho can't afford wedding 'towers' are real sensible not to take them;\nand then she'll remind me that Jane went to Europe for hers.  I want to\nspend MY honeymoon at Four Winds in my own dear house of dreams.\"\n\n\"And you've decided not to have any bridesmaid?\"\n\n\"There isn't any one to have.  You and Phil and Priscilla and Jane all\nstole a march on me in the matter of marriage; and Stella is teaching\nin Vancouver.  I have no other 'kindred soul' and I won't have a\nbridesmaid who isn't.\"\n\n\"But you are going to wear a veil, aren't you?\" asked Diana, anxiously.\n\n\"Yes, indeedy.  I shouldn't feel like a bride without one.  I remember\ntelling Matthew, that evening when he brought me to Green Gables, that\nI never expected to be a bride because I was so homely no one would\never want to marry me--unless some foreign missionary did.  I had an\nidea then that foreign missionaries couldn't afford to be finicky in\nthe matter of looks if they wanted a girl to risk her life among\ncannibals.  You should have seen the foreign missionary Priscilla\nmarried.  He was as handsome and inscrutable as those daydreams we once\nplanned to marry ourselves, Diana; he was the best dressed man I ever\nmet, and he raved over Priscilla's 'ethereal, golden beauty.'  But of\ncourse there are no cannibals in Japan.\"\n\n\"Your wedding dress is a dream, anyhow,\" sighed Diana rapturously.\n\"You'll look like a perfect queen in it--you're so tall and slender.\nHow DO you keep so slim, Anne?  I'm fatter than ever--I'll soon have no\nwaist at all.\"\n\n\"Stoutness and slimness seem to be matters of predestination,\" said\nAnne.  \"At all events, Mrs. Harmon Andrews can't say to you what she\nsaid to me when I came home from Summerside, 'Well, Anne, you're just\nabout as skinny as ever.'  It sounds quite romantic to be 'slender,'\nbut 'skinny' has a very different tang.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Harmon has been talking about your trousseau.  She admits it's as\nnice as Jane's, although she says Jane married a millionaire and you\nare only marrying a 'poor young doctor without a cent to his name.'\"\n\nAnne laughed.\n\n\"My dresses ARE nice.  I love pretty things.  I remember the first\npretty dress I ever had--the brown gloria Matthew gave me for our\nschool concert.  Before that everything I had was so ugly.  It seemed\nto me that I stepped into a new world that night.\"\n\n\"That was the night Gilbert recited 'Bingen on the Rhine,' and looked\nat you when he said, 'There's another, NOT a sister.'  And you were so\nfurious because he put your pink tissue rose in his breast pocket!  You\ndidn't much imagine then that you would ever marry him.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, that's another instance of predestination,\" laughed Anne, as\nthey went down the garret stairs.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nTHE HOUSE OF DREAMS\n\nThere was more excitement in the air of Green Gables than there had\never been before in all its history.  Even Marilla was so excited that\nshe couldn't help showing it--which was little short of being\nphenomenal.\n\n\"There's never been a wedding in this house,\" she said, half\napologetically, to Mrs. Rachel Lynde.  \"When I was a child I heard an\nold minister say that a house was not a real home until it had been\nconsecrated by a birth, a wedding and a death.  We've had deaths\nhere--my father and mother died here as well as Matthew; and we've even\nhad a birth here.  Long ago, just after we moved into this house, we\nhad a married hired man for a little while, and his wife had a baby\nhere.  But there's never been a wedding before.  It does seem so\nstrange to think of Anne being married.  In a way she just seems to me\nthe little girl Matthew brought home here fourteen years ago.  I can't\nrealize that she's grown up.  I shall never forget what I felt when I\nsaw Matthew bringing in a GIRL.  I wonder what became of the boy we\nwould have got if there hadn't been a mistake.  I wonder what HIS fate\nwas.\"\n\n\"Well, it was a fortunate mistake,\" said Mrs. Rachel Lynde, \"though,\nmind you, there was a time I didn't think so--that evening I came up to\nsee Anne and she treated us to such a scene.  Many things have changed\nsince then, that's what.\"\n\nMrs. Rachel sighed, and then brisked up again.  When weddings were in\norder Mrs. Rachel was ready to let the dead past bury its dead.\n\n\"I'm going to give Anne two of my cotton warp spreads,\" she resumed.\n\"A tobacco-stripe one and an apple-leaf one.  She tells me they're\ngetting to be real fashionable again.  Well, fashion or no fashion, I\ndon't believe there's anything prettier for a spare-room bed than a\nnice apple-leaf spread, that's what.  I must see about getting them\nbleached.  I've had them sewed up in cotton bags ever since Thomas\ndied, and no doubt they're an awful color.  But there's a month yet,\nand dew-bleaching will work wonders.\"\n\nOnly a month!  Marilla sighed and then said proudly:\n\n\"I'm giving Anne that half dozen braided rugs I have in the garret. I\nnever supposed she'd want them--they're so old-fashioned, and nobody\nseems to want anything but hooked mats now.  But she asked me for\nthem--said she'd rather have them than anything else for her floors.\nThey ARE pretty.  I made them of the nicest rags, and braided them in\nstripes.  It was such company these last few winters.  And I'll make\nher enough blue plum preserve to stock her jam closet for a year.  It\nseems real strange.  Those blue plum trees hadn't even a blossom for\nthree years, and I thought they might as well be cut down.  And this\nlast spring they were white, and such a crop of plums I never remember\nat Green Gables.\"\n\n\"Well, thank goodness that Anne and Gilbert really are going to be\nmarried after all.  It's what I've always prayed for,\" said Mrs.\nRachel, in the tone of one who is comfortably sure that her prayers\nhave availed much.  \"It was a great relief to find out that she really\ndidn't mean to take the Kingsport man.  He was rich, to be sure, and\nGilbert is poor--at least, to begin with; but then he's an Island boy.\"\n\n\"He's Gilbert Blythe,\" said Marilla contentedly.  Marilla would have\ndied the death before she would have put into words the thought that\nwas always in the background of her mind whenever she had looked at\nGilbert from his childhood up--the thought that, had it not been for\nher own wilful pride long, long ago, he might have been HER son.\nMarilla felt that, in some strange way, his marriage with Anne would\nput right that old mistake.  Good had come out of the evil of the\nancient bitterness.\n\nAs for Anne herself, she was so happy that she almost felt frightened.\nThe gods, so says the old superstition, do not like to behold too happy\nmortals.  It is certain, at least, that some human beings do not.  Two\nof that ilk descended upon Anne one violet dusk and proceeded to do\nwhat in them lay to prick the rainbow bubble of her satisfaction.  If\nshe thought she was getting any particular prize in young Dr. Blythe,\nor if she imagined that he was still as infatuated with her as he might\nhave been in his salad days, it was surely their duty to put the matter\nbefore her in another light.  Yet these two worthy ladies were not\nenemies of Anne; on the contrary, they were really quite fond of her,\nand would have defended her as their own young had anyone else attacked\nher.  Human nature is not obliged to be consistent.\n\nMrs. Inglis--nee Jane Andrews, to quote from the Daily Enterprise--came\nwith her mother and Mrs. Jasper Bell.  But in Jane the milk of human\nkindness had not been curdled by years of matrimonial bickerings.  Her\nlines had fallen in pleasant places.  In spite of the fact--as Mrs.\nRachel Lynde would say--that she had married a millionaire, her\nmarriage had been happy.  Wealth had not spoiled her.  She was still\nthe placid, amiable, pink-cheeked Jane of the old quartette,\nsympathising with her old chum's happiness and as keenly interested in\nall the dainty details of Anne's trousseau as if it could rival her own\nsilken and bejewelled splendors.  Jane was not brilliant, and had\nprobably never made a remark worth listening to in her life; but she\nnever said anything that would hurt anyone's feelings--which may be a\nnegative talent but is likewise a rare and enviable one.\n\n\"So Gilbert didn't go back on you after all,\" said Mrs. Harmon Andrews,\ncontriving to convey an expression of surprise in her tone.  \"Well, the\nBlythes generally keep their word when they've once passed it, no\nmatter what happens.  Let me see--you're twenty-five, aren't you, Anne?\nWhen I was a girl twenty-five was the first corner.  But you look quite\nyoung.  Red-headed people always do.\"\n\n\"Red hair is very fashionable now,\" said Anne, trying to smile, but\nspeaking rather coldly.  Life had developed in her a sense of humor\nwhich helped her over many difficulties; but as yet nothing had availed\nto steel her against a reference to her hair.\n\n\"So it is--so it is,\" conceded Mrs. Harmon.  \"There's no telling what\nqueer freaks fashion will take.  Well, Anne, your things are very\npretty, and very suitable to your position in life, aren't they, Jane?\nI hope you'll be very happy.  You have my best wishes, I'm sure.  A\nlong engagement doesn't often turn out well.  But, of course, in your\ncase it couldn't be helped.\"\n\n\"Gilbert looks very young for a doctor.  I'm afraid people won't have\nmuch confidence in him,\" said Mrs. Jasper Bell gloomily.  Then she shut\nher mouth tightly, as if she had said what she considered it her duty\nto say and held her conscience clear.  She belonged to the type which\nalways has a stringy black feather in its hat and straggling locks of\nhair on its neck.\n\nAnne's surface pleasure in her pretty bridal things was temporarily\nshadowed; but the deeps of happiness below could not thus be disturbed;\nand the little stings of Mesdames Bell and Andrews were forgotten when\nGilbert came later, and they wandered down to the birches of the brook,\nwhich had been saplings when Anne had come to Green Gables, but were\nnow tall, ivory columns in a fairy palace of twilight and stars.  In\ntheir shadows Anne and Gilbert talked in lover-fashion of their new\nhome and their new life together.\n\n\"I've found a nest for us, Anne.\"\n\n\"Oh, where?  Not right in the village, I hope.  I wouldn't like that\naltogether.\"\n\n\"No.  There was no house to be had in the village.  This is a little\nwhite house on the harbor shore, half way between Glen St. Mary and\nFour Winds Point.  It's a little out of the way, but when we get a\n'phone in that won't matter so much.  The situation is beautiful.  It\nlooks to the sunset and has the great blue harbor before it.  The\nsand-dunes aren't very far away--the sea winds blow over them and the\nsea spray drenches them.\"\n\n\"But the house itself, Gilbert,--OUR first home?  What is it like?\"\n\n\"Not very large, but large enough for us.  There's a splendid living\nroom with a fireplace in it downstairs, and a dining room that looks\nout on the harbor, and a little room that will do for my office.  It is\nabout sixty years old--the oldest house in Four Winds.  But it has been\nkept in pretty good repair, and was all done over about fifteen years\nago--shingled, plastered and re-floored.  It was well built to begin\nwith.  I understand that there was some romantic story connected with\nits building, but the man I rented it from didn't know it.\"\n\n\"He said Captain Jim was the only one who could spin that old yarn now.\"\n\n\"Who is Captain Jim?\"\n\n\"The keeper of the lighthouse on Four Winds Point.  You'll love that\nFour Winds light, Anne.  It's a revolving one, and it flashes like a\nmagnificent star through the twilights.  We can see it from our living\nroom windows and our front door.\"\n\n\"Who owns the house?\"\n\n\"Well, it's the property of the Glen St. Mary Presbyterian Church now,\nand I rented it from the trustees.  But it belonged until lately to a\nvery old lady, Miss Elizabeth Russell.  She died last spring, and as\nshe had no near relatives she left her property to the Glen St. Mary\nChurch.  Her furniture is still in the house, and I bought most of\nit--for a mere song you might say, because it was all so old-fashioned\nthat the trustees despaired of selling it.  Glen St. Mary folks prefer\nplush brocade and sideboards with mirrors and ornamentations, I fancy.\nBut Miss Russell's furniture is very good and I feel sure you'll like\nit, Anne.\"\n\n\"So far, good,\" said Anne, nodding cautious approval.  \"But, Gilbert,\npeople cannot live by furniture alone.  You haven't yet mentioned one\nvery important thing.  Are there TREES about this house?\"\n\n\"Heaps of them, oh, dryad!  There is a big grove of fir trees behind\nit, two rows of Lombardy poplars down the lane, and a ring of white\nbirches around a very delightful garden.  Our front door opens right\ninto the garden, but there is another entrance--a little gate hung\nbetween two firs.  The hinges are on one trunk and the catch on the\nother.  Their boughs form an arch overhead.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm so glad!  I couldn't live where there were no trees--something\nvital in me would starve.  Well, after that, there's no use asking you\nif there's a brook anywhere near.  THAT would be expecting too much.\"\n\n\"But there IS a brook--and it actually cuts across one corner of the\ngarden.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Anne, with a long sigh of supreme satisfaction, \"this\nhouse you have found IS my house of dreams and none other.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nTHE LAND OF DREAMS AMONG\n\n\"Have you made up your mind who you're going to have to the wedding,\nAnne?\" asked Mrs. Rachel Lynde, as she hemstitched table napkins\nindustriously.  \"It's time your invitations were sent, even if they are\nto be only informal ones.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to have very many,\" said Anne.  \"We just want those we\nlove best to see us married.  Gilbert's people, and Mr. and Mrs. Allan,\nand Mr. and Mrs. Harrison.\"\n\n\"There was a time when you'd hardly have numbered Mr. Harrison among\nyour dearest friends,\" said Marilla drily.\n\n\"Well, I wasn't VERY strongly attracted to him at our first meeting,\"\nacknowledged Anne, with a laugh over the recollection.  \"But Mr.\nHarrison has improved on acquaintance, and Mrs. Harrison is really a\ndear.  Then, of course, there are Miss Lavendar and Paul.\"\n\n\"Have they decided to come to the Island this summer?  I thought they\nwere going to Europe.\"\n\n\"They changed their minds when I wrote them I was going to be married.\nI had a letter from Paul today.  He says he MUST come to my wedding, no\nmatter what happens to Europe.\"\n\n\"That child always idolised you,\" remarked Mrs. Rachel.\n\n\"That 'child' is a young man of nineteen now, Mrs. Lynde.\"\n\n\"How time does fly!\" was Mrs. Lynde's brilliant and original response.\n\n\"Charlotta the Fourth may come with them.  She sent word by Paul that\nshe would come if her husband would let her.  I wonder if she still\nwears those enormous blue bows, and whether her husband calls her\nCharlotta or Leonora.  I should love to have Charlotta at my wedding.\nCharlotta and I were at a wedding long syne.  They expect to be at Echo\nLodge next week.  Then there are Phil and the Reverend Jo----\"\n\n\"It sounds awful to hear you speaking of a minister like that, Anne,\"\nsaid Mrs. Rachel severely.\n\n\"His wife calls him that.\"\n\n\"She should have more respect for his holy office, then,\" retorted Mrs.\nRachel.\n\n\"I've heard you criticise ministers pretty sharply yourself,\" teased\nAnne.\n\n\"Yes, but I do it reverently,\" protested Mrs. Lynde.  \"You never heard\nme NICKNAME a minister.\"\n\nAnne smothered a smile.\n\n\"Well, there are Diana and Fred and little Fred and Small Anne\nCordelia--and Jane Andrews.  I wish I could have Miss Stacey and Aunt\nJamesina and Priscilla and Stella.  But Stella is in Vancouver, and\nPris is in Japan, and Miss Stacey is married in California, and Aunt\nJamesina has gone to India to explore her daughter's mission field, in\nspite of her horror of snakes.  It's really dreadful--the way people\nget scattered over the globe.\"\n\n\"The Lord never intended it, that's what,\" said Mrs. Rachel\nauthoritatively.  \"In my young days people grew up and married and\nsettled down where they were born, or pretty near it.  Thank goodness\nyou've stuck to the Island, Anne.  I was afraid Gilbert would insist on\nrushing off to the ends of the earth when he got through college, and\ndragging you with him.\"\n\n\"If everybody stayed where he was born places would soon be filled up,\nMrs. Lynde.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not going to argue with you, Anne.  _I_ am not a B.A.  What\ntime of the day is the ceremony to be?\"\n\n\"We have decided on noon--high noon, as the society reporters say.\nThat will give us time to catch the evening train to Glen St. Mary.\"\n\n\"And you'll be married in the parlor?\"\n\n\"No--not unless it rains.  We mean to be married in the orchard--with\nthe blue sky over us and the sunshine around us.  Do you know when and\nwhere I'd like to be married, if I could?  It would be at dawn--a June\ndawn, with a glorious sunrise, and roses blooming in the gardens; and I\nwould slip down and meet Gilbert and we would go together to the heart\nof the beech woods,--and there, under the green arches that would be\nlike a splendid cathedral, we would be married.\"\n\nMarilla sniffed scornfully and Mrs. Lynde looked shocked.\n\n\"But that would be terrible queer, Anne.  Why, it wouldn't really seem\nlegal.  And what would Mrs. Harmon Andrews say?\"\n\n\"Ah, there's the rub,\" sighed Anne.  \"There are so many things in life\nwe cannot do because of the fear of what Mrs. Harmon Andrews would say.\n''Tis true, 'tis pity, and pity 'tis, 'tis true.'  What delightful\nthings we might do were it not for Mrs. Harmon Andrews!\"\n\n\"By times, Anne, I don't feel quite sure that I understand you\naltogether,\" complained Mrs. Lynde.\n\n\"Anne was always romantic, you know,\" said Marilla apologetically.\n\n\"Well, married life will most likely cure her of that,\" Mrs. Rachel\nresponded comfortingly.\n\nAnne laughed and slipped away to Lover's Lane, where Gilbert found her;\nand neither of them seemed to entertain much fear, or hope, that their\nmarried life would cure them of romance.\n\nThe Echo Lodge people came over the next week, and Green Gables buzzed\nwith the delight of them.  Miss Lavendar had changed so little that the\nthree years since her last Island visit might have been a watch in the\nnight; but Anne gasped with amazement over Paul.  Could this splendid\nsix feet of manhood be the little Paul of Avonlea schooldays?\n\n\"You really make me feel old, Paul,\" said Anne.  \"Why, I have to look\nup to you!\"\n\n\"You'll never grow old, Teacher,\" said Paul.  \"You are one of the\nfortunate mortals who have found and drunk from the Fountain of\nYouth,--you and Mother Lavendar.  See here!  When you're married I\nWON'T call you Mrs. Blythe.  To me you'll always be 'Teacher'--the\nteacher of the best lessons I ever learned.  I want to show you\nsomething.\"\n\nThe \"something\" was a pocketbook full of poems.  Paul had put some of\nhis beautiful fancies into verse, and magazine editors had not been as\nunappreciative as they are sometimes supposed to be.  Anne read Paul's\npoems with real delight.  They were full of charm and promise.\n\n\"You'll be famous yet, Paul.  I always dreamed of having one famous\npupil.  He was to be a college president--but a great poet would be\neven better.  Some day I'll be able to boast that I whipped the\ndistinguished Paul Irving.  But then I never did whip you, did I, Paul?\nWhat an opportunity lost!  I think I kept you in at recess, however.\"\n\n\"You may be famous yourself, Teacher.  I've seen a good deal of your\nwork these last three years.\"\n\n\"No.  I know what I can do.  I can write pretty, fanciful little\nsketches that children love and editors send welcome cheques for.  But\nI can do nothing big.  My only chance for earthly immortality is a\ncorner in your Memoirs.\"\n\nCharlotta the Fourth had discarded the blue bows but her freckles were\nnot noticeably less.\n\n\"I never did think I'd come down to marrying a Yankee, Miss Shirley,\nma'am,\" she said.  \"But you never know what's before you, and it isn't\nhis fault.  He was born that way.\"\n\n\"You're a Yankee yourself, Charlotta, since you've married one.\"\n\n\"Miss Shirley, ma'am, I'm NOT!  And I wouldn't be if I was to marry a\ndozen Yankees!  Tom's kind of nice.  And besides, I thought I'd better\nnot be too hard to please, for I mightn't get another chance.  Tom\ndon't drink and he don't growl because he has to work between meals,\nand when all's said and done I'm satisfied, Miss Shirley, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Does he call you Leonora?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"Goodness, no, Miss Shirley, ma'am.  I wouldn't know who he meant if he\ndid.  Of course, when we got married he had to say, 'I take thee,\nLeonora,' and I declare to you, Miss Shirley, ma'am, I've had the most\ndreadful feeling ever since that it wasn't me he was talking to and I\nhaven't been rightly married at all.  And so you're going to be married\nyourself, Miss Shirley, ma'am?  I always thought I'd like to marry a\ndoctor.  It would be so handy when the children had measles and croup.\nTom is only a bricklayer, but he's real good-tempered.  When I said to\nhim, says I, 'Tom, can I go to Miss Shirley's wedding?  I mean to go\nanyhow, but I'd like to have your consent,' he just says, 'Suit\nyourself, Charlotta, and you'll suit me.'  That's a real pleasant kind\nof husband to have, Miss Shirley, ma'am.\"\n\nPhilippa and her Reverend Jo arrived at Green Gables the day before the\nwedding.  Anne and Phil had a rapturous meeting which presently\nsimmered down to a cosy, confidential chat over all that had been and\nwas about to be.\n\n\"Queen Anne, you're as queenly as ever.  I've got fearfully thin since\nthe babies came.  I'm not half so good-looking; but I think Jo likes\nit.  There's not such a contrast between us, you see.  And oh, it's\nperfectly magnificent that you're going to marry Gilbert.  Roy Gardner\nwouldn't have done at all, at all.  I can see that now, though I was\nhorribly disappointed at the time.  You know, Anne, you did treat Roy\nvery badly.\"\n\n\"He has recovered, I understand,\" smiled Anne.\n\n\"Oh, yes.  He is married and his wife is a sweet little thing and\nthey're perfectly happy.  Everything works together for good.  Jo and\nthe Bible say that, and they are pretty good authorities.\"\n\n\"Are Alec and Alonzo married yet?\"\n\n\"Alec is, but Alonzo isn't.  How those dear old days at Patty's Place\ncome back when I'm talking to you, Anne!  What fun we had!\"\n\n\"Have you been to Patty's Place lately?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I go often.  Miss Patty and Miss Maria still sit by the\nfireplace and knit.  And that reminds me--we've brought you a wedding\ngift from them, Anne.  Guess what it is.\"\n\n\"I never could.  How did they know I was going to be married?\"\n\n\"Oh, I told them.  I was there last week.  And they were so interested.\nTwo days ago Miss Patty wrote me a note asking me to call; and then she\nasked if I would take her gift to you.  What would you wish most from\nPatty's Place, Anne?\"\n\n\"You can't mean that Miss Patty has sent me her china dogs?\"\n\n\"Go up head.  They're in my trunk this very moment.  And I've a letter\nfor you.  Wait a moment and I'll get it.\"\n\n\"Dear Miss Shirley,\" Miss Patty had written, \"Maria and I were very\nmuch interested in hearing of your approaching nuptials.  We send you\nour best wishes.  Maria and I have never married, but we have no\nobjection to other people doing so.  We are sending you the china dogs.\nI intended to leave them to you in my will, because you seemed to have\nsincere affection for them.  But Maria and I expect to live a good\nwhile yet (D.V.), so I have decided to give you the dogs while you are\nyoung.  You will not have forgotten that Gog looks to the right and\nMagog to the left.\"\n\n\"Just fancy those lovely old dogs sitting by the fireplace in my house\nof dreams,\" said Anne rapturously.  \"I never expected anything so\ndelightful.\"\n\nThat evening Green Gables hummed with preparations for the following\nday; but in the twilight Anne slipped away.  She had a little\npilgrimage to make on this last day of her girlhood and she must make\nit alone.  She went to Matthew's grave, in the little poplar-shaded\nAvonlea graveyard, and there kept a silent tryst with old memories and\nimmortal loves.\n\n\"How glad Matthew would be tomorrow if he were here,\" she whispered.\n\"But I believe he does know and is glad of it--somewhere else.  I've\nread somewhere that 'our dead are never dead until we have forgotten\nthem.' Matthew will never be dead to me, for I can never forget him.\"\n\nShe left on his grave the flowers she had brought and walked slowly\ndown the long hill.  It was a gracious evening, full of delectable\nlights and shadows.  In the west was a sky of mackerel clouds--crimson\nand amber-tinted, with long strips of apple-green sky between.  Beyond\nwas the glimmering radiance of a sunset sea, and the ceaseless voice of\nmany waters came up from the tawny shore.  All around her, lying in the\nfine, beautiful country silence, were the hills and fields and woods\nshe had known and loved so long.\n\n\"History repeats itself,\" said Gilbert, joining her as she passed the\nBlythe gate.  \"Do you remember our first walk down this hill, Anne--our\nfirst walk together anywhere, for that matter?\"\n\n\"I was coming home in the twilight from Matthew's grave--and you came\nout of the gate; and I swallowed the pride of years and spoke to you.\"\n\n\"And all heaven opened before me,\" supplemented Gilbert.  \"From that\nmoment I looked forward to tomorrow.  When I left you at your gate that\nnight and walked home I was the happiest boy in the world.  Anne had\nforgiven me.\"\n\n\"I think you had the most to forgive.  I was an ungrateful little\nwretch--and after you had really saved my life that day on the pond,\ntoo.  How I loathed that load of obligation at first!  I don't deserve\nthe happiness that has come to me.\"\n\nGilbert laughed and clasped tighter the girlish hand that wore his\nring.  Anne's engagement ring was a circlet of pearls.  She had refused\nto wear a diamond.\n\n\"I've never really liked diamonds since I found out they weren't the\nlovely purple I had dreamed.  They will always suggest my old\ndisappointment.\"\n\n\"But pearls are for tears, the old legend says,\" Gilbert had objected.\n\n\"I'm not afraid of that.  And tears can be happy as well as sad.  My\nvery happiest moments have been when I had tears in my eyes--when\nMarilla told me I might stay at Green Gables--when Matthew gave me the\nfirst pretty dress I ever had--when I heard that you were going to\nrecover from the fever.  So give me pearls for our troth ring, Gilbert,\nand I'll willingly accept the sorrow of life with its joy.\"\n\nBut tonight our lovers thought only of joy and never of sorrow.  For\nthe morrow was their wedding day, and their house of dreams awaited\nthem on the misty, purple shore of Four Winds Harbor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nTHE FIRST BRIDE OF GREEN GABLES\n\nAnne wakened on the morning of her wedding day to find the sunshine\nwinking in at the window of the little porch gable and a September\nbreeze frolicking with her curtains.\n\n\"I'm so glad the sun will shine on me,\" she thought happily.\n\nShe recalled the first morning she had wakened in that little porch\nroom, when the sunshine had crept in on her through the blossom-drift\nof the old Snow Queen.  That had not been a happy wakening, for it\nbrought with it the bitter disappointment of the preceding night.  But\nsince then the little room had been endeared and consecrated by years\nof happy childhood dreams and maiden visions.  To it she had come back\njoyfully after all her absences; at its window she had knelt through\nthat night of bitter agony when she believed Gilbert dying, and by it\nshe had sat in speechless happiness the night of her betrothal.  Many\nvigils of joy and some of sorrow had been kept there; and today she\nmust leave it forever.  Henceforth it would be hers no more;\nfifteen-year-old Dora was to inherit it when she had gone.  Nor did\nAnne wish it otherwise; the little room was sacred to youth and\ngirlhood--to the past that was to close today before the chapter of\nwifehood opened.\n\nGreen Gables was a busy and joyous house that forenoon.  Diana arrived\nearly, with little Fred and Small Anne Cordelia, to lend a hand.  Davy\nand Dora, the Green Gables twins, whisked the babies off to the garden.\n\n\"Don't let Small Anne Cordelia spoil her clothes,\" warned Diana\nanxiously.\n\n\"You needn't be afraid to trust her with Dora,\" said Marilla.  \"That\nchild is more sensible and careful than most of the mothers I've known.\nShe's really a wonder in some ways.  Not much like that other\nharum-scarum I brought up.\"\n\nMarilla smiled across her chicken salad at Anne.  It might even be\nsuspected that she liked the harum-scarum best after all.\n\n\"Those twins are real nice children,\" said Mrs. Rachel, when she was\nsure they were out of earshot.  \"Dora is so womanly and helpful, and\nDavy is developing into a very smart boy.  He isn't the holy terror for\nmischief he used to be.\"\n\n\"I never was so distracted in my life as I was the first six months he\nwas here,\" acknowledged Marilla.  \"After that I suppose I got used to\nhim.  He's taken a great notion to farming lately, and wants me to let\nhim try running the farm next year.  I may, for Mr. Barry doesn't think\nhe'll want to rent it much longer, and some new arrangement will have\nto be made.\"\n\n\"Well, you certainly have a lovely day for your wedding, Anne,\" said\nDiana, as she slipped a voluminous apron over her silken array.  \"You\ncouldn't have had a finer one if you'd ordered it from Eaton's.\"\n\n\"Indeed, there's too much money going out of this Island to that same\nEaton's,\" said Mrs. Lynde indignantly.  She had strong views on the\nsubject of octopus-like department stores, and never lost an\nopportunity of airing them.  \"And as for those catalogues of theirs,\nthey're the Avonlea girls' Bible now, that's what.  They pore over them\non Sundays instead of studying the Holy Scriptures.\"\n\n\"Well, they're splendid to amuse children with,\" said Diana.  \"Fred and\nSmall Anne look at the pictures by the hour.\"\n\n\"_I_ amused ten children without the aid of Eaton's catalogue,\" said\nMrs. Rachel severely.\n\n\"Come, you two, don't quarrel over Eaton's catalogue,\" said Anne gaily.\n\"This is my day of days, you know.  I'm so happy I want every one else\nto be happy, too.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I hope your happiness will last, child,\" sighed Mrs. Rachel.\nShe did hope it truly, and believed it, but she was afraid it was in\nthe nature of a challenge to Providence to flaunt your happiness too\nopenly.  Anne, for her own good, must be toned down a trifle.\n\nBut it was a happy and beautiful bride who came down the old,\nhomespun-carpeted stairs that September noon--the first bride of Green\nGables, slender and shining-eyed, in the mist of her maiden veil, with\nher arms full of roses.  Gilbert, waiting for her in the hall below,\nlooked up at her with adoring eyes.  She was his at last, this evasive,\nlong-sought Anne, won after years of patient waiting.  It was to him\nshe was coming in the sweet surrender of the bride.  Was he worthy of\nher?  Could he make her as happy as he hoped?  If he failed her--if he\ncould not measure up to her standard of manhood--then, as she held out\nher hand, their eyes met and all doubt was swept away in a glad\ncertainty.  They belonged to each other; and, no matter what life might\nhold for them, it could never alter that.  Their happiness was in each\nother's keeping and both were unafraid.\n\nThey were married in the sunshine of the old orchard, circled by the\nloving and kindly faces of long-familiar friends.  Mr. Allan married\nthem, and the Reverend Jo made what Mrs. Rachel Lynde afterwards\npronounced to be the \"most beautiful wedding prayer\" she had ever\nheard.  Birds do not often sing in September, but one sang sweetly from\nsome hidden bough while Gilbert and Anne repeated their deathless vows.\nAnne heard it and thrilled to it; Gilbert heard it, and wondered only\nthat all the birds in the world had not burst into jubilant song; Paul\nheard it and later wrote a lyric about it which was one of the most\nadmired in his first volume of verse; Charlotta the Fourth heard it and\nwas blissfully sure it meant good luck for her adored Miss Shirley.\nThe bird sang until the ceremony was ended and then it wound up with\none mad little, glad little trill.  Never had the old gray-green house\namong its enfolding orchards known a blither, merrier afternoon.  All\nthe old jests and quips that must have done duty at weddings since Eden\nwere served up, and seemed as new and brilliant and mirth-provoking as\nif they had never been uttered before.  Laughter and joy had their way;\nand when Anne and Gilbert left to catch the Carmody train, with Paul as\ndriver, the twins were ready with rice and old shoes, in the throwing\nof which Charlotta the Fourth and Mr. Harrison bore a valiant part.\nMarilla stood at the gate and watched the carriage out of sight down\nthe long lane with its banks of goldenrod.  Anne turned at its end to\nwave her last good-bye.  She was gone--Green Gables was her home no\nmore; Marilla's face looked very gray and old as she turned to the\nhouse which Anne had filled for fourteen years, and even in her\nabsence, with light and life.\n\nBut Diana and her small fry, the Echo Lodge people and the Allans, had\nstayed to help the two old ladies over the loneliness of the first\nevening; and they contrived to have a quietly pleasant little supper\ntime, sitting long around the table and chatting over all the details\nof the day.  While they were sitting there Anne and Gilbert were\nalighting from the train at Glen St. Mary.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nTHE HOME COMING\n\nDr. David Blythe had sent his horse and buggy to meet them, and the\nurchin who had brought it slipped away with a sympathetic grin, leaving\nthem to the delight of driving alone to their new home through the\nradiant evening.\n\nAnne never forgot the loveliness of the view that broke upon them when\nthey had driven over the hill behind the village.  Her new home could\nnot yet be seen; but before her lay Four Winds Harbor like a great,\nshining mirror of rose and silver.  Far down, she saw its entrance\nbetween the bar of sand dunes on one side and a steep, high, grim, red\nsandstone cliff on the other.  Beyond the bar the sea, calm and\naustere, dreamed in the afterlight.  The little fishing village,\nnestled in the cove where the sand-dunes met the harbor shore, looked\nlike a great opal in the haze.  The sky over them was like a jewelled\ncup from which the dusk was pouring; the air was crisp with the\ncompelling tang of the sea, and the whole landscape was infused with\nthe subtleties of a sea evening.  A few dim sails drifted along the\ndarkening, fir-clad harbor shores.  A bell was ringing from the tower\nof a little white church on the far side; mellowly and dreamily sweet,\nthe chime floated across the water blent with the moan of the sea.  The\ngreat revolving light on the cliff at the channel flashed warm and\ngolden against the clear northern sky, a trembling, quivering star of\ngood hope.  Far out along the horizon was the crinkled gray ribbon of a\npassing steamer's smoke.\n\n\"Oh, beautiful, beautiful,\" murmured Anne.  \"I shall love Four Winds,\nGilbert.  Where is our house?\"\n\n\"We can't see it yet--the belt of birch running up from that little\ncove hides it.  It's about two miles from Glen St. Mary, and there's\nanother mile between it and the light-house.  We won't have many\nneighbors, Anne.  There's only one house near us and I don't know who\nlives in it.  Shall you be lonely when I'm away?\"\n\n\"Not with that light and that loveliness for company.  Who lives in\nthat house, Gilbert?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  It doesn't look--exactly--as if the occupants would be\nkindred spirits, Anne, does it?\"\n\nThe house was a large, substantial affair, painted such a vivid green\nthat the landscape seemed quite faded by contrast.  There was an\norchard behind it, and a nicely kept lawn before it, but, somehow,\nthere was a certain bareness about it.  Perhaps its neatness was\nresponsible for this; the whole establishment, house, barns, orchard,\ngarden, lawn and lane, was so starkly neat.\n\n\"It doesn't seem probable that anyone with that taste in paint could be\nVERY kindred,\" acknowledged Anne, \"unless it were an accident--like our\nblue hall.  I feel certain there are no children there, at least.  It's\neven neater than the old Copp place on the Tory road, and I never\nexpected to see anything neater than that.\"\n\nThey had not met anybody on the moist, red road that wound along the\nharbor shore.  But just before they came to the belt of birch which hid\ntheir home, Anne saw a girl who was driving a flock of snow-white geese\nalong the crest of a velvety green hill on the right.  Great, scattered\nfirs grew along it.  Between their trunks one saw glimpses of yellow\nharvest fields, gleams of golden sand-hills, and bits of blue sea.  The\ngirl was tall and wore a dress of pale blue print.  She walked with a\ncertain springiness of step and erectness of bearing.  She and her\ngeese came out of the gate at the foot of the hill as Anne and Gilbert\npassed.  She stood with her hand on the fastening of the gate, and\nlooked steadily at them, with an expression that hardly attained to\ninterest, but did not descend to curiosity.  It seemed to Anne, for a\nfleeting moment, that there was even a veiled hint of hostility in it.\nBut it was the girl's beauty which made Anne give a little gasp--a\nbeauty so marked that it must have attracted attention anywhere.  She\nwas hatless, but heavy braids of burnished hair, the hue of ripe wheat,\nwere twisted about her head like a coronet; her eyes were blue and\nstar-like; her figure, in its plain print gown, was magnificent; and\nher lips were as crimson as the bunch of blood-red poppies she wore at\nher belt.\n\n\"Gilbert, who is the girl we have just passed?\" asked Anne, in a low\nvoice.\n\n\"I didn't notice any girl,\" said Gilbert, who had eyes only for his\nbride.\n\n\"She was standing by that gate--no, don't look back.  She is still\nwatching us.  I never saw such a beautiful face.\"\n\n\"I don't remember seeing any very handsome girls while I was here.\nThere are some pretty girls up at the Glen, but I hardly think they\ncould be called beautiful.\"\n\n\"This girl is.  You can't have seen her, or you would remember her.\nNobody could forget her.  I never saw such a face except in pictures.\nAnd her hair!  It made me think of Browning's 'cord of gold' and\n'gorgeous snake'!\"\n\n\"Probably she's some visitor in Four Winds--likely some one from that\nbig summer hotel over the harbor.\"\n\n\"She wore a white apron and she was driving geese.\"\n\n\"She might do that for amusement.  Look, Anne--there's our house.\"\n\nAnne looked and forgot for a time the girl with the splendid, resentful\neyes.  The first glimpse of her new home was a delight to eye and\nspirit--it looked so like a big, creamy seashell stranded on the harbor\nshore.  The rows of tall Lombardy poplars down its lane stood out in\nstately, purple silhouette against the sky.  Behind it, sheltering its\ngarden from the too keen breath of sea winds, was a cloudy fir wood, in\nwhich the winds might make all kinds of weird and haunting music.  Like\nall woods, it seemed to be holding and enfolding secrets in its\nrecesses,--secrets whose charm is only to be won by entering in and\npatiently seeking.  Outwardly, dark green arms keep them inviolate from\ncurious or indifferent eyes.\n\nThe night winds were beginning their wild dances beyond the bar and the\nfishing hamlet across the harbor was gemmed with lights as Anne and\nGilbert drove up the poplar lane.  The door of the little house opened,\nand a warm glow of firelight flickered out into the dusk.  Gilbert\nlifted Anne from the buggy and led her into the garden, through the\nlittle gate between the ruddy-tipped firs, up the trim, red path to the\nsandstone step.\n\n\"Welcome home,\" he whispered, and hand in hand they stepped over the\nthreshold of their house of dreams.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nCAPTAIN JIM\n\n\"Old Doctor Dave\" and \"Mrs. Doctor Dave\" had come down to the little\nhouse to greet the bride and groom.  Doctor Dave was a big, jolly,\nwhite-whiskered old fellow, and Mrs. Doctor was a trim rosy-cheeked,\nsilver-haired little lady who took Anne at once to her heart, literally\nand figuratively.\n\n\"I'm so glad to see you, dear.  You must be real tired.  We've got a\nbite of supper ready, and Captain Jim brought up some trout for you.\nCaptain Jim--where are you?  Oh, he's slipped out to see to the horse,\nI suppose.  Come upstairs and take your things off.\"\n\nAnne looked about her with bright, appreciative eyes as she followed\nMrs. Doctor Dave upstairs.  She liked the appearance of her new home\nvery much.  It seemed to have the atmosphere of Green Gables and the\nflavor of her old traditions.\n\n\"I think I would have found Miss Elizabeth Russell a 'kindred spirit,'\"\nshe murmured when she was alone in her room.  There were two windows in\nit; the dormer one looked out on the lower harbor and the sand-bar and\nthe Four Winds light.\n\n    \"A magic casement opening on the foam\n    Of perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn,\"\n\nquoted Anne softly.  The gable window gave a view of a little\nharvest-hued valley through which a brook ran.  Half a mile up the\nbrook was the only house in sight--an old, rambling, gray one\nsurrounded by huge willows through which its windows peered, like shy,\nseeking eyes, into the dusk.  Anne wondered who lived there; they would\nbe her nearest neighbors and she hoped they would be nice.  She\nsuddenly found herself thinking of the beautiful girl with the white\ngeese.\n\n\"Gilbert thought she didn't belong here,\" mused Anne, \"but I feel sure\nshe does.  There was something about her that made her part of the sea\nand the sky and the harbor.  Four Winds is in her blood.\"\n\nWhen Anne went downstairs Gilbert was standing before the fireplace\ntalking to a stranger.  Both turned as Anne entered.\n\n\"Anne, this is Captain Boyd.  Captain Boyd, my wife.\"\n\nIt was the first time Gilbert had said \"my wife\" to anybody but Anne,\nand he narrowly escaped bursting with the pride of it.  The old captain\nheld out a sinewy hand to Anne; they smiled at each other and were\nfriends from that moment.  Kindred spirit flashed recognition to\nkindred spirit.\n\n\"I'm right down pleased to meet you, Mistress Blythe; and I hope you'll\nbe as happy as the first bride was who came here.  I can't wish you no\nbetter than THAT.  But your husband doesn't introduce me jest exactly\nright.  'Captain Jim' is my week-a-day name and you might as well begin\nas you're sartain to end up--calling me that.  You sartainly are a nice\nlittle bride, Mistress Blythe.  Looking at you sorter makes me feel\nthat I've jest been married myself.\"\n\nAmid the laughter that followed Mrs. Doctor Dave urged Captain Jim to\nstay and have supper with them.\n\n\"Thank you kindly.  'Twill be a real treat, Mistress Doctor.  I mostly\nhas to eat my meals alone, with the reflection of my ugly old phiz in a\nlooking-glass opposite for company.  'Tisn't often I have a chance to\nsit down with two such sweet, purty ladies.\"\n\nCaptain Jim's compliments may look very bald on paper, but he paid them\nwith such a gracious, gentle deference of tone and look that the woman\nupon whom they were bestowed felt that she was being offered a queen's\ntribute in a kingly fashion.\n\nCaptain Jim was a high-souled, simple-minded old man, with eternal\nyouth in his eyes and heart.  He had a tall, rather ungainly figure,\nsomewhat stooped, yet suggestive of great strength and endurance; a\nclean-shaven face deeply lined and bronzed; a thick mane of iron-gray\nhair falling quite to his shoulders, and a pair of remarkably blue,\ndeep-set eyes, which sometimes twinkled and sometimes dreamed, and\nsometimes looked out seaward with a wistful quest in them, as of one\nseeking something precious and lost.  Anne was to learn one day what it\nwas for which Captain Jim looked.\n\nIt could not be denied that Captain Jim was a homely man.  His spare\njaws, rugged mouth, and square brow were not fashioned on the lines of\nbeauty; and he had passed through many hardships and sorrows which had\nmarked his body as well as his soul; but though at first sight Anne\nthought him plain she never thought anything more about it--the spirit\nshining through that rugged tenement beautified it so wholly.\n\nThey gathered gaily around the supper table.  The hearth fire banished\nthe chill of the September evening, but the window of the dining room\nwas open and sea breezes entered at their own sweet will.  The view was\nmagnificent, taking in the harbor and the sweep of low, purple hills\nbeyond.  The table was heaped with Mrs. Doctor's delicacies but the\npiece de resistance was undoubtedly the big platter of sea trout.\n\n\"Thought they'd be sorter tasty after travelling,\" said Captain Jim.\n\"They're fresh as trout can be, Mistress Blythe.  Two hours ago they\nwere swimming in the Glen Pond.\"\n\n\"Who is attending to the light tonight, Captain Jim?\" asked Doctor Dave.\n\n\"Nephew Alec.  He understands it as well as I do.  Well, now, I'm real\nglad you asked me to stay to supper.  I'm proper hungry--didn't have\nmuch of a dinner today.\"\n\n\"I believe you half starve yourself most of the time down at that\nlight,\" said Mrs. Doctor Dave severely.  \"You won't take the trouble to\nget up a decent meal.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do, Mistress Doctor, I do,\" protested Captain Jim.  \"Why, I live\nlike a king gen'rally.  Last night I was up to the Glen and took home\ntwo pounds of steak.  I meant to have a spanking good dinner today.\"\n\n\"And what happened to the steak?\" asked Mrs. Doctor Dave.  \"Did you\nlose it on the way home?\"\n\n\"No.\"  Captain Jim looked sheepish.  \"Just at bedtime a poor, ornery\nsort of dog came along and asked for a night's lodging.  Guess he\nbelonged to some of the fishermen 'long shore.  I couldn't turn the\npoor cur out--he had a sore foot.  So I shut him in the porch, with an\nold bag to lie on, and went to bed.  But somehow I couldn't sleep.\nCome to think it over, I sorter remembered that the dog looked hungry.\"\n\n\"And you got up and gave him that steak--ALL that steak,\" said Mrs.\nDoctor Dave, with a kind of triumphant reproof.\n\n\"Well, there wasn't anything else TO give him,\" said Captain Jim\ndeprecatingly.  \"Nothing a dog'd care for, that is.  I reckon he WAS\nhungry, for he made about two bites of it.  I had a fine sleep the rest\nof the night but my dinner had to be sorter scanty--potatoes and point,\nas you might say.  The dog, he lit out for home this morning.  I reckon\nHE weren't a vegetarian.\"\n\n\"The idea of starving yourself for a worthless dog!\" sniffed Mrs.\nDoctor.\n\n\"You don't know but he may be worth a lot to somebody,\" protested\nCaptain Jim.  \"He didn't LOOK of much account, but you can't go by\nlooks in jedging a dog.  Like meself, he might be a real beauty inside.\nThe First Mate didn't approve of him, I'll allow.  His language was\nright down forcible. But the First Mate is prejudiced.  No use in\ntaking a cat's opinion of a dog.  'Tennyrate, I lost my dinner, so this\nnice spread in this dee-lightful company is real pleasant. It's a great\nthing to have good neighbors.\"\n\n\"Who lives in the house among the willows up the brook?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"Mrs. Dick Moore,\" said Captain Jim--\"and her husband,\" he added, as if\nby way of an afterthought.\n\nAnne smiled, and deduced a mental picture of Mrs. Dick Moore from\nCaptain Jim's way of putting it; evidently a second Mrs. Rachel Lynde.\n\n\"You haven't many neighbors, Mistress Blythe,\" Captain Jim went on.\n\"This side of the harbor is mighty thinly settled.  Most of the land\nbelongs to Mr. Howard up yander past the Glen, and he rents it out for\npasture.  The other side of the harbor, now, is thick with\nfolks--'specially MacAllisters.  There's a whole colony of MacAllisters\nyou can't throw a stone but you hit one.  I was talking to old Leon\nBlacquiere the other day.  He's been working on the harbor all summer.\n'Dey're nearly all MacAllisters over thar,' he told me.  'Dare's Neil\nMacAllister and Sandy MacAllister and William MacAllister and Alec\nMacAllister and Angus MacAllister--and I believe dare's de Devil\nMacAllister.'\"\n\n\"There are nearly as many Elliotts and Crawfords,\" said Doctor Dave,\nafter the laughter had subsided.  \"You know, Gilbert, we folk on this\nside of Four Winds have an old saying--'From the conceit of the\nElliotts, the pride of the MacAllisters, and the vainglory of the\nCrawfords, good Lord deliver us.'\"\n\n\"There's a plenty of fine people among them, though,\" said Captain Jim.\n\"I sailed with William Crawford for many a year, and for courage and\nendurance and truth that man hadn't an equal.  They've got brains over\non that side of Four Winds.  Mebbe that's why this side is sorter\ninclined to pick on 'em.  Strange, ain't it, how folks seem to resent\nanyone being born a mite cleverer than they be.\"\n\nDoctor Dave, who had a forty years' feud with the over-harbor people,\nlaughed and subsided.\n\n\"Who lives in that brilliant emerald house about half a mile up the\nroad?\" asked Gilbert.\n\nCaptain Jim smiled delightedly.\n\n\"Miss Cornelia Bryant.  She'll likely be over to see you soon, seeing\nyou're Presbyterians.  If you were Methodists she wouldn't come at all.\nCornelia has a holy horror of Methodists.\"\n\n\"She's quite a character,\" chuckled Doctor Dave.  \"A most inveterate\nman-hater!\"\n\n\"Sour grapes?\" queried Gilbert, laughing.\n\n\"No, 'tisn't sour grapes,\" answered Captain Jim seriously.  \"Cornelia\ncould have had her pick when she was young.  Even yet she's only to say\nthe word to see the old widowers jump.  She jest seems to have been\nborn with a sort of chronic spite agin men and Methodists.  She's got\nthe bitterest tongue and the kindest heart in Four Winds.  Wherever\nthere's any trouble, that woman is there, doing everything to help in\nthe tenderest way.  She never says a harsh word about another woman,\nand if she likes to card us poor scalawags of men down I reckon our\ntough old hides can stand it.\"\n\n\"She always speaks well of you, Captain Jim,\" said Mrs. Doctor.\n\n\"Yes, I'm afraid so.  I don't half like it.  It makes me feel as if\nthere must be something sorter unnateral about me.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nTHE SCHOOLMASTER'S BRIDE\n\n\"Who was the first bride who came to this house, Captain Jim?\" Anne\nasked, as they sat around the fireplace after supper.\n\n\"Was she a part of the story I've heard was connected with this house?\"\nasked Gilbert.  \"Somebody told me you could tell it, Captain Jim.\"\n\n\"Well, yes, I know it.  I reckon I'm the only person living in Four\nWinds now that can remember the schoolmaster's bride as she was when\nshe come to the Island.  She's been dead this thirty year, but she was\none of them women you never forget.\"\n\n\"Tell us the story,\" pleaded Anne.  \"I want to find out all about the\nwomen who have lived in this house before me.\"\n\n\"Well, there's jest been three--Elizabeth Russell, and Mrs. Ned\nRussell, and the schoolmaster's bride.  Elizabeth Russell was a nice,\nclever little critter, and Mrs. Ned was a nice woman, too.  But they\nweren't ever like the schoolmaster's bride.\n\n\"The schoolmaster's name was John Selwyn.  He came out from the Old\nCountry to teach school at the Glen when I was a boy of sixteen.  He\nwasn't much like the usual run of derelicts who used to come out to\nP.E.I. to teach school in them days.  Most of them were clever, drunken\ncritters who taught the children the three R's when they were sober,\nand lambasted them when they wasn't.  But John Selwyn was a fine,\nhandsome young fellow.  He boarded at my father's, and he and me were\ncronies, though he was ten years older'n me.  We read and walked and\ntalked a heap together.  He knew about all the poetry that was ever\nwritten, I reckon, and he used to quote it to me along shore in the\nevenings.  Dad thought it an awful waste of time, but he sorter endured\nit, hoping it'd put me off the notion of going to sea.  Well, nothing\ncould do THAT--mother come of a race of sea-going folk and it was born\nin me.  But I loved to hear John read and recite.  It's almost sixty\nyears ago, but I could repeat yards of poetry I learned from him.\nNearly sixty years!\"\n\nCaptain Jim was silent for a space, gazing into the glowing fire in a\nquest of the bygones.  Then, with a sigh, he resumed his story.\n\n\"I remember one spring evening I met him on the sand-hills.  He looked\nsorter uplifted--jest like you did, Dr. Blythe, when you brought\nMistress Blythe in tonight.  I thought of him the minute I seen you.\nAnd he told me that he had a sweetheart back home and that she was\ncoming out to him.  I wasn't more'n half pleased, ornery young lump of\nselfishness that I was; I thought he wouldn't be as much my friend\nafter she came.  But I'd enough decency not to let him see it.  He told\nme all about her.  Her name was Persis Leigh, and she would have come\nout with him if it hadn't been for her old uncle.  He was sick, and\nhe'd looked after her when her parents died and she wouldn't leave him.\nAnd now he was dead and she was coming out to marry John Selwyn.\n'Twasn't no easy journey for a woman in them days.  There weren't no\nsteamers, you must ricollect.\n\n\"'When do you expect her?' says I.\n\n\"'She sails on the Royal William, the 20th of June,' says he, 'and so\nshe should be here by mid-July.  I must set Carpenter Johnson to\nbuilding me a home for her.  Her letter come today.  I know before I\nopened it that it had good news for me.  I saw her a few nights ago.'\n\n\"I didn't understand him, and then he explained--though I didn't\nunderstand THAT much better.  He said he had a gift--or a curse.  Them\nwas his words, Mistress Blythe--a gift or a curse.  He didn't know\nwhich it was.  He said a great-great-grandmother of his had had it, and\nthey burned her for a witch on account of it.  He said queer\nspells--trances, I think was the name he give 'em--come over him now\nand again.  Are there such things, Doctor?\"\n\n\"There are people who are certainly subject to trances,\" answered\nGilbert.  \"The matter is more in the line of psychical research than\nmedical.  What were the trances of this John Selwyn like?\"\n\n\"Like dreams,\" said the old Doctor skeptically.\n\n\"He said he could see things in them,\" said Captain Jim slowly.\n\n\"Mind you, I'm telling you jest what HE said--things that were\nhappening--things that were GOING to happen.  He said they were\nsometimes a comfort to him and sometimes a horror.  Four nights before\nthis he'd been in one--went into it while he was sitting looking at the\nfire.  And he saw an old room he knew well in England, and Persis Leigh\nin it, holding out her hands to him and looking glad and happy.  So he\nknew he was going to hear good news of her.\"\n\n\"A dream--a dream,\" scoffed the old Doctor.\n\n\"Likely--likely,\" conceded Captain Jim.  \"That's what _I_ said to him\nat the time.  It was a vast more comfortable to think so.  I didn't\nlike the idea of him seeing things like that--it was real uncanny.\n\n\"'No,' says he, 'I didn't dream it.  But we won't talk of this again.\nYou won't be so much my friend if you think much about it.'\n\n\"I told him nothing could make me any less his friend.  But he jest\nshook his head and says, says he:\n\n\"'Lad, I know.  I've lost friends before because of this.  I don't\nblame them.  There are times when I feel hardly friendly to myself\nbecause of it.  Such a power has a bit of divinity in it--whether of a\ngood or an evil divinity who shall say?  And we mortals all shrink from\ntoo close contact with God or devil.'\n\n\"Them was his words.  I remember them as if 'twas yesterday, though I\ndidn't know jest what he meant.  What do you s'pose he DID mean,\ndoctor?\"\n\n\"I doubt if he knew what he meant himself,\" said Doctor Dave testily.\n\n\"I think I understand,\" whispered Anne.  She was listening in her old\nattitude of clasped lips and shining eyes.  Captain Jim treated himself\nto an admiring smile before he went on with his story.\n\n\"Well, purty soon all the Glen and Four Winds people knew the\nschoolmaster's bride was coming, and they were all glad because they\nthought so much of him.  And everybody took an interest in his new\nhouse--THIS house.  He picked this site for it, because you could see\nthe harbor and hear the sea from it.  He made the garden out there for\nhis bride, but he didn't plant the Lombardies.  Mrs. Ned Russell\nplanted THEM.  But there's a double row of rose-bushes in the garden\nthat the little girls who went to the Glen school set out there for the\nschoolmaster's bride.  He said they were pink for her cheeks and white\nfor her brow and red for her lips.  He'd quoted poetry so much that he\nsorter got into the habit of talking it, too, I reckon.\n\n\"Almost everybody sent him some little present to help out the\nfurnishing of the house.  When the Russells came into it they were\nwell-to-do and furnished it real handsome, as you can see; but the\nfirst furniture that went into it was plain enough.  This little house\nwas rich in love, though.  The women sent in quilts and tablecloths and\ntowels, and one man made a chest for her, and another a table and so\non.  Even blind old Aunt Margaret Boyd wove a little basket for her out\nof the sweet-scented sand-hill grass.  The schoolmaster's wife used it\nfor years to keep her handkerchiefs in.\n\n\"Well, at last everything was ready--even to the logs in the big\nfireplace ready for lighting.  'Twasn't exactly THIS fireplace, though\n'twas in the same place.  Miss Elizabeth had this put in when she made\nthe house over fifteen years ago.  It was a big, old-fashioned\nfireplace where you could have roasted an ox.  Many's the time I've sat\nhere and spun yarns, same's I'm doing tonight.\"\n\nAgain there was a silence, while Captain Jim kept a passing tryst with\nvisitants Anne and Gilbert could not see--the folks who had sat with\nhim around that fireplace in the vanished years, with mirth and bridal\njoy shining in eyes long since closed forever under churchyard sod or\nheaving leagues of sea.  Here on olden nights children had tossed\nlaughter lightly to and fro.  Here on winter evenings friends had\ngathered.  Dance and music and jest had been here.  Here youths and\nmaidens had dreamed.  For Captain Jim the little house was tenanted\nwith shapes entreating remembrance.\n\n\"It was the first of July when the house was finished.  The\nschoolmaster began to count the days then.  We used to see him walking\nalong the shore, and we'd say to each other, 'She'll soon be with him\nnow.'\n\n\"She was expected the middle of July, but she didn't come then.  Nobody\nfelt anxious.  Vessels were often delayed for days and mebbe weeks.\nThe Royal William was a week overdue--and then two--and then three.\nAnd at last we began to be frightened, and it got worse and worse.\nFin'lly I couldn't bear to look into John Selwyn's eyes.  D'ye know,\nMistress Blythe\"--Captain Jim lowered his voice--\"I used to think that\nthey looked just like what his old great-great-grandmother's must have\nbeen when they were burning her to death.  He never said much but he\ntaught school like a man in a dream and then hurried to the shore.\nMany a night he walked there from dark to dawn.  People said he was\nlosing his mind.  Everybody had given up hope--the Royal William was\neight weeks overdue.  It was the middle of September and the\nschoolmaster's bride hadn't come--never would come, we thought.\n\n\"There was a big storm then that lasted three days, and on the evening\nafter it died away I went to the shore.  I found the schoolmaster\nthere, leaning with his arms folded against a big rock, gazing out to\nsea.\n\n\"I spoke to him but he didn't answer.  His eyes seemed to be looking at\nsomething I couldn't see.  His face was set, like a dead man's.\n\n\"'John--John,' I called out--jest like that--jest like a frightened\nchild, 'wake up--wake up.'\n\n\"That strange, awful look seemed to sorter fade out of his eyes.\n\n\"He turned his head and looked at me.  I've never forgot his\nface--never will forget it till I ships for my last voyage.\n\n\"'All is well, lad,' he says.  'I've seen the Royal William coming\naround East Point.  She will be here by dawn.  Tomorrow night I shall\nsit with my bride by my own hearth-fire.'\n\n\"Do you think he did see it?\" demanded Captain Jim abruptly.\n\n\"God knows,\" said Gilbert softly.  \"Great love and great pain might\ncompass we know not what marvels.\"\n\n\"I am sure he did see it,\" said Anne earnestly.\n\n\"Fol-de-rol,\" said Doctor Dave, but he spoke with less conviction than\nusual.\n\n\"Because, you know,\" said Captain Jim solemnly, \"the Royal William came\ninto Four Winds Harbor at daylight the next morning.\n\n\"Every soul in the Glen and along the shore was at the old wharf to\nmeet her.  The schoolmaster had been watching there all night.  How we\ncheered as she sailed up the channel.\"\n\nCaptain Jim's eyes were shining.  They were looking at the Four Winds\nHarbor of sixty years agone, with a battered old ship sailing through\nthe sunrise splendor.\n\n\"And Persis Leigh was on board?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"Yes--her and the captain's wife.  They'd had an awful passage--storm\nafter storm--and their provisions give out, too.  But there they were\nat last.  When Persis Leigh stepped onto the old wharf John Selwyn took\nher in his arms--and folks stopped cheering and begun to cry.  I cried\nmyself, though 'twas years, mind you, afore I'd admit it.  Ain't it\nfunny how ashamed boys are of tears?\"\n\n\"Was Persis Leigh beautiful?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"Well, I don't know that you'd call her beautiful\nexactly--I--don't--know,\" said Captain Jim slowly.  \"Somehow, you never\ngot so far along as to wonder if she was handsome or not.  It jest\ndidn't matter.  There was something so sweet and winsome about her that\nyou had to love her, that was all.  But she was pleasant to look\nat--big, clear, hazel eyes and heaps of glossy brown hair, and an\nEnglish skin.  John and her were married at our house that night at\nearly candle-lighting; everybody from far and near was there to see it\nand we all brought them down here afterwards.  Mistress Selwyn lighted\nthe fire, and we went away and left them sitting here, jest as John had\nseen in that vision of his.  A strange thing--a strange thing!  But\nI've seen a turrible lot of strange things in my time.\"\n\nCaptain Jim shook his head sagely.\n\n\"It's a dear story,\" said Anne, feeling that for once she had got\nenough romance to satisfy her.  \"How long did they live here?\"\n\n\"Fifteen years.  I ran off to sea soon after they were married, like\nthe young scalawag I was.  But every time I come back from a voyage I'd\nhead for here, even before I went home, and tell Mistress Selwyn all\nabout it.  Fifteen happy years!  They had a sort of talent for\nhappiness, them two.  Some folks are like that, if you've noticed.\nThey COULDN'T be unhappy for long, no matter what happened.  They\nquarrelled once or twice, for they was both high-sperrited.  But\nMistress Selwyn says to me once, says she, laughing in that pretty way\nof hers, 'I felt dreadful when John and I quarrelled, but underneath it\nall I was very happy because I had such a nice husband to quarrel with\nand make it up with.'  Then they moved to Charlottetown, and Ned\nRussell bought this house and brought his bride here.  They were a gay\nyoung pair, as I remember them.  Miss Elizabeth Russell was Alec's\nsister.  She came to live with them a year or so later, and she was a\ncreature of mirth, too.  The walls of this house must be sorter SOAKED\nwith laughing and good times.  You're the third bride I've seen come\nhere, Mistress Blythe--and the handsomest.\"\n\nCaptain Jim contrived to give his sunflower compliment the delicacy of\na violet, and Anne wore it proudly.  She was looking her best that\nnight, with the bridal rose on her cheeks and the love-light in her\neyes; even gruff old Doctor Dave gave her an approving glance, and told\nhis wife, as they drove home together, that that red-headed wife of the\nboy's was something of a beauty.\n\n\"I must be getting back to the light,\" announced Captain Jim.  \"I've\nenj'yed this evening something tremenjus.\"\n\n\"You must come often to see us,\" said Anne.\n\n\"I wonder if you'd give that invitation if you knew how likely I'll be\nto accept it,\" Captain Jim remarked whimsically.\n\n\"Which is another way of saying you wonder if I mean it,\" smiled Anne.\n\"I do, 'cross my heart,' as we used to say at school.\"\n\n\"Then I'll come.  You're likely to be pestered with me at any hour.\nAnd I'll be proud to have you drop down and visit me now and then, too.\nGin'rally I haven't anyone to talk to but the First Mate, bless his\nsociable heart.  He's a mighty good listener, and has forgot more'n any\nMacAllister of them all ever knew, but he isn't much of a\nconversationalist.  You're young and I'm old, but our souls are about\nthe same age, I reckon.  We both belong to the race that knows Joseph,\nas Cornelia Bryant would say.\"\n\n\"The race that knows Joseph?\" puzzled Anne.\n\n\"Yes.  Cornelia divides all the folks in the world into two kinds--the\nrace that knows Joseph and the race that don't.  If a person sorter\nsees eye to eye with you, and has pretty much the same ideas about\nthings, and the same taste in jokes--why, then he belongs to the race\nthat knows Joseph.\"\n\n\"Oh, I understand,\" exclaimed Anne, light breaking in upon her.\n\n\"It's what I used to call--and still call in quotation marks 'kindred\nspirits.'\"\n\n\"Jest so--jest so,\" agreed Captain Jim.  \"We're it, whatever IT is.\nWhen you come in tonight, Mistress Blythe, I says to myself, says I,\n'Yes, she's of the race that knows Joseph.'  And mighty glad I was, for\nif it wasn't so we couldn't have had any real satisfaction in each\nother's company.  The race that knows Joseph is the salt of the airth,\nI reckon.\"\n\nThe moon had just risen when Anne and Gilbert went to the door with\ntheir guests.  Four Winds Harbor was beginning to be a thing of dream\nand glamour and enchantment--a spellbound haven where no tempest might\never ravin.  The Lombardies down the lane, tall and sombre as the\npriestly forms of some mystic band, were tipped with silver.\n\n\"Always liked Lombardies,\" said Captain Jim, waving a long arm at them.\n\"They're the trees of princesses.  They're out of fashion now.  Folks\ncomplain that they die at the top and get ragged-looking.  So they\ndo--so they do, if you don't risk your neck every spring climbing up a\nlight ladder to trim them out.  I always did it for Miss Elizabeth, so\nher Lombardies never got out-at-elbows.  She was especially fond of\nthem.  She liked their dignity and stand-offishness.  THEY don't hobnob\nwith every Tom, Dick and Harry.  If it's maples for company, Mistress\nBlythe, it's Lombardies for society.\"\n\n\"What a beautiful night,\" said Mrs. Doctor Dave, as she climbed into\nthe Doctor's buggy.\n\n\"Most nights are beautiful,\" said Captain Jim.  \"But I 'low that\nmoonlight over Four Winds makes me sorter wonder what's left for\nheaven.  The moon's a great friend of mine, Mistress Blythe.  I've\nloved her ever since I can remember.  When I was a little chap of eight\nI fell asleep in the garden one evening and wasn't missed.  I woke up\nalong in the night and I was most scared to death.  What shadows and\nqueer noises there was!  I dursn't move.  Jest crouched there quaking,\npoor small mite.  Seemed 's if there weren't anyone in the world but\nmeself and it was mighty big.  Then all at once I saw the moon looking\ndown at me through the apple boughs, jest like an old friend.  I was\ncomforted right off.  Got up and walked to the house as brave as a\nlion, looking at her.  Many's the night I've watched her from the deck\nof my vessel, on seas far away from here.  Why don't you folks tell me\nto take in the slack of my jaw and go home?\"\n\nThe laughter of the goodnights died away.  Anne and Gilbert walked hand\nin hand around their garden.  The brook that ran across the corner\ndimpled pellucidly in the shadows of the birches.  The poppies along\nits banks were like shallow cups of moonlight.  Flowers that had been\nplanted by the hands of the schoolmaster's bride flung their sweetness\non the shadowy air, like the beauty and blessing of sacred yesterdays.\nAnne paused in the gloom to gather a spray.\n\n\"I love to smell flowers in the dark,\" she said.  \"You get hold of\ntheir soul then.  Oh, Gilbert, this little house is all I've dreamed\nit.  And I'm so glad that we are not the first who have kept bridal\ntryst here!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nMISS CORNELIA BRYANT COMES TO CALL\n\nThat September was a month of golden mists and purple hazes at Four\nWinds Harbor--a month of sun-steeped days and of nights that were\nswimming in moonlight, or pulsating with stars.  No storm marred it, no\nrough wind blew.  Anne and Gilbert put their nest in order, rambled on\nthe shores, sailed on the harbor, drove about Four Winds and the Glen,\nor through the ferny, sequestered roads of the woods around the harbor\nhead; in short, had such a honeymoon as any lovers in the world might\nhave envied them.\n\n\"If life were to stop short just now it would still have been richly\nworth while, just for the sake of these past four weeks, wouldn't it?\"\nsaid Anne.  \"I don't suppose we will ever have four such perfect weeks\nagain--but we've HAD them.  Everything--wind, weather, folks, house of\ndreams--has conspired to make our honeymoon delightful.  There hasn't\neven been a rainy day since we came here.\"\n\n\"And we haven't quarrelled once,\" teased Gilbert.\n\n\"Well, 'that's a pleasure all the greater for being deferred,'\" quoted\nAnne.  \"I'm so glad we decided to spend our honeymoon here.  Our\nmemories of it will always belong here, in our house of dreams, instead\nof being scattered about in strange places.\"\n\nThere was a certain tang of romance and adventure in the atmosphere of\ntheir new home which Anne had never found in Avonlea.  There, although\nshe had lived in sight of the sea, it had not entered intimately into\nher life.  In Four Winds it surrounded her and called to her\nconstantly.  From every window of her new home she saw some varying\naspect of it.  Its haunting murmur was ever in her ears.  Vessels\nsailed up the harbor every day to the wharf at the Glen, or sailed out\nagain through the sunset, bound for ports that might be half way round\nthe globe.  Fishing boats went white-winged down the channel in the\nmornings, and returned laden in the evenings.  Sailors and fisher-folk\ntravelled the red, winding harbor roads, light-hearted and content.\nThere was always a certain sense of things going to happen--of\nadventures and farings-forth.  The ways of Four Winds were less staid\nand settled and grooved than those of Avonlea; winds of change blew\nover them; the sea called ever to the dwellers on shore, and even those\nwho might not answer its call felt the thrill and unrest and mystery\nand possibilities of it.\n\n\"I understand now why some men must go to sea,\" said Anne.  \"That\ndesire which comes to us all at times--'to sail beyond the bourne of\nsunset'--must be very imperious when it is born in you.  I don't wonder\nCaptain Jim ran away because of it.  I never see a ship sailing out of\nthe channel, or a gull soaring over the sand-bar, without wishing I\nwere on board the ship or had wings, not like a dove 'to fly away and\nbe at rest,' but like a gull, to sweep out into the very heart of a\nstorm.\"\n\n\"You'll stay right here with me, Anne-girl,\" said Gilbert lazily.  \"I\nwon't have you flying away from me into the hearts of storms.\"\n\nThey were sitting on their red sand-stone doorstep in the late\nafternoon.  Great tranquillities were all about them in land and sea\nand sky.  Silvery gulls were soaring over them.  The horizons were\nlaced with long trails of frail, pinkish clouds.  The hushed air was\nthreaded with a murmurous refrain of minstrel winds and waves.  Pale\nasters were blowing in the sere and misty meadows between them and the\nharbor.\n\n\"Doctors who have to be up all night waiting on sick folk don't feel\nvery adventurous, I suppose,\" Anne said indulgently.  \"If you had had a\ngood sleep last night, Gilbert, you'd be as ready as I am for a flight\nof imagination.\"\n\n\"I did good work last night, Anne,\" said Gilbert quietly.  \"Under God,\nI saved a life.  This is the first time I could ever really claim that.\nIn other cases I may have helped; but, Anne, if I had not stayed at\nAllonby's last night and fought death hand to hand, that woman would\nhave died before morning.  I tried an experiment that was certainly\nnever tried in Four Winds before.  I doubt if it was ever tried\nanywhere before outside of a hospital.  It was a new thing in Kingsport\nhospital last winter.  I could never have dared try it here if I had\nnot been absolutely certain that there was no other chance.  I risked\nit--and it succeeded.  As a result, a good wife and mother is saved for\nlong years of happiness and usefulness.  As I drove home this morning,\nwhile the sun was rising over the harbor, I thanked God that I had\nchosen the profession I did.  I had fought a good fight and won--think\nof it, Anne, WON, against the Great Destroyer.  It's what I dreamed of\ndoing long ago when we talked together of what we wanted to do in life.\nThat dream of mine came true this morning.\"\n\n\"Was that the only one of your dreams that has come true?\" asked Anne,\nwho knew perfectly well what the substance of his answer would be, but\nwanted to hear it again.\n\n\"YOU know, Anne-girl,\" said Gilbert, smiling into her eyes.  At that\nmoment there were certainly two perfectly happy people sitting on the\ndoorstep of a little white house on the Four Winds Harbor shore.\n\nPresently Gilbert said, with a change of tone, \"Do I or do I not see a\nfull-rigged ship sailing up our lane?\"\n\nAnne looked and sprang up.\n\n\"That must be either Miss Cornelia Bryant or Mrs. Moore coming to\ncall,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm going into the office, and if it is Miss Cornelia I warn you that\nI'll eavesdrop,\" said Gilbert.  \"From all I've heard regarding Miss\nCornelia I conclude that her conversation will not be dull, to say the\nleast.\"\n\n\"It may be Mrs. Moore.\"\n\n\"I don't think Mrs. Moore is built on those lines.  I saw her working\nin her garden the other day, and, though I was too far away to see\nclearly, I thought she was rather slender.  She doesn't seem very\nsocially inclined when she has never called on you yet, although she's\nyour nearest neighbor.\"\n\n\"She can't be like Mrs. Lynde, after all, or curiosity would have\nbrought her,\" said Anne.  \"This caller is, I think, Miss Cornelia.\"\n\nMiss Cornelia it was; moreover, Miss Cornelia had not come to make any\nbrief and fashionable wedding call.  She had her work under her arm in\na substantial parcel, and when Anne asked her to stay she promptly took\noff her capacious sun-hat, which had been held on her head, despite\nirreverent September breezes, by a tight elastic band under her hard\nlittle knob of fair hair.  No hat pins for Miss Cornelia, an it please\nye!  Elastic bands had been good enough for her mother and they were\ngood enough for HER.  She had a fresh, round, pink-and-white face, and\njolly brown eyes.  She did not look in the least like the traditional\nold maid, and there was something in her expression which won Anne\ninstantly.  With her old instinctive quickness to discern kindred\nspirits she knew she was going to like Miss Cornelia, in spite of\nuncertain oddities of opinion, and certain oddities of attire.\n\nNobody but Miss Cornelia would have come to make a call arrayed in a\nstriped blue-and-white apron and a wrapper of chocolate print, with a\ndesign of huge, pink roses scattered over it.  And nobody but Miss\nCornelia could have looked dignified and suitably garbed in it.  Had\nMiss Cornelia been entering a palace to call on a prince's bride, she\nwould have been just as dignified and just as wholly mistress of the\nsituation.  She would have trailed her rose-spattered flounce over the\nmarble floors just as unconcernedly, and she would have proceeded just\nas calmly to disabuse the mind of the princess of any idea that the\npossession of a mere man, be he prince or peasant, was anything to brag\nof.\n\n\"I've brought my work, Mrs. Blythe, dearie,\" she remarked, unrolling\nsome dainty material.  \"I'm in a hurry to get this done, and there\nisn't any time to lose.\"\n\nAnne looked in some surprise at the white garment spread over Miss\nCornelia's ample lap.  It was certainly a baby's dress, and it was most\nbeautifully made, with tiny frills and tucks.  Miss Cornelia adjusted\nher glasses and fell to embroidering with exquisite stitches.\n\n\"This is for Mrs. Fred Proctor up at the Glen,\" she announced.  \"She's\nexpecting her eighth baby any day now, and not a stitch has she ready\nfor it.  The other seven have wore out all she made for the first, and\nshe's never had time or strength or spirit to make any more.  That\nwoman is a martyr, Mrs. Blythe, believe ME.  When she married Fred\nProctor _I_ knew how it would turn out.  He was one of your wicked,\nfascinating men.  After he got married he left off being fascinating\nand just kept on being wicked.  He drinks and he neglects his family.\nIsn't that like a man?  I don't know how Mrs. Proctor would ever keep\nher children decently clothed if her neighbors didn't help her out.\"\n\nAs Anne was afterwards to learn, Miss Cornelia was the only neighbor\nwho troubled herself much about the decency of the young Proctors.\n\n\"When I heard this eighth baby was coming I decided to make some things\nfor it,\" Miss Cornelia went on.  \"This is the last and I want to finish\nit today.\"\n\n\"It's certainly very pretty,\" said Anne.  \"I'll get my sewing and we'll\nhave a little thimble party of two.  You are a beautiful sewer, Miss\nBryant.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm the best sewer in these parts,\" said Miss Cornelia in a\nmatter-of-fact tone.  \"I ought to be!  Lord, I've done more of it than\nif I'd had a hundred children of my own, believe ME!  I s'pose I'm a\nfool, to be putting hand embroidery on this dress for an eighth baby.\nBut, Lord, Mrs. Blythe, dearie, it isn't to blame for being the eighth,\nand I kind of wished it to have one real pretty dress, just as if it\nWAS wanted.  Nobody's wanting the poor mite--so I put some extra fuss\non its little things just on that account.\"\n\n\"Any baby might be proud of that dress,\" said Anne, feeling still more\nstrongly that she was going to like Miss Cornelia.\n\n\"I s'pose you've been thinking I was never coming to call on you,\"\nresumed Miss Cornelia.  \"But this is harvest month, you know, and I've\nbeen busy--and a lot of extra hands hanging round, eating more'n they\nwork, just like the men.  I'd have come yesterday, but I went to Mrs.\nRoderick MacAllister's funeral.  At first I thought my head was aching\nso badly I couldn't enjoy myself if I did go.  But she was a hundred\nyears old, and I'd always promised myself that I'd go to her funeral.\"\n\n\"Was it a successful function?\" asked Anne, noticing that the office\ndoor was ajar.\n\n\"What's that?  Oh, yes, it was a tremendous funeral.  She had a very\nlarge connection.  There was over one hundred and twenty carriages in\nthe procession.  There was one or two funny things happened.  I thought\nthat die I would to see old Joe Bradshaw, who is an infidel and never\ndarkens the door of a church, singing 'Safe in the Arms of Jesus' with\ngreat gusto and fervor.  He glories in singing--that's why he never\nmisses a funeral.  Poor Mrs. Bradshaw didn't look much like\nsinging--all wore out slaving.  Old Joe starts out once in a while to\nbuy her a present and brings home some new kind of farm machinery.\nIsn't that like a man?  But what else would you expect of a man who\nnever goes to church, even a Methodist one?  I was real thankful to see\nyou and the young Doctor in the Presbyterian church your first Sunday.\nNo doctor for me who isn't a Presbyterian.\"\n\n\"We were in the Methodist church last Sunday evening,\" said Anne\nwickedly.\n\n\"Oh, I s'pose Dr. Blythe has to go to the Methodist church once in a\nwhile or he wouldn't get the Methodist practice.\"\n\n\"We liked the sermon very much,\" declared Anne boldly.  \"And I thought\nthe Methodist minster's prayer was one of the most beautiful I ever\nheard.\"\n\n\"Oh, I've no doubt he can pray.  I never heard anyone make more\nbeautiful prayers than old Simon Bentley, who was always drunk, or\nhoping to be, and the drunker he was the better he prayed.\"\n\n\"The Methodist minister is very fine looking,\" said Anne, for the\nbenefit of the office door.\n\n\"Yes, he's quite ornamental,\" agreed Miss Cornelia.  \"Oh, and VERY\nladylike.  And he thinks that every girl who looks at him falls in love\nwith him--as if a Methodist minister, wandering about like any Jew, was\nsuch a prize!  If you and the young doctor take MY advice, you won't\nhave much to do with the Methodists.  My motto is--if you ARE a\nPresbyterian, BE a Presbyterian.\"\n\n\"Don't you think that Methodists go to heaven as well as\nPresbyterians?\" asked Anne smilelessly.\n\n\"That isn't for US to decide.  It's in higher hands than ours,\" said\nMiss Cornelia solemnly.  \"But I ain't going to associate with them on\nearth whatever I may have to do in heaven.  THIS Methodist minister\nisn't married.  The last one they had was, and his wife was the\nsilliest, flightiest little thing I ever saw.  I told her husband once\nthat he should have waited till she was grown up before he married her.\nHe said he wanted to have the training of her.  Wasn't that like a man?\"\n\n\"It's rather hard to decide just when people ARE grown up,\" laughed\nAnne.\n\n\"That's a true word, dearie.  Some are grown up when they're born, and\nothers ain't grown up when they're eighty, believe ME. That same Mrs.\nRoderick I was speaking of never grew up.  She was as foolish when she\nwas a hundred as when she was ten.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that was why she lived so long,\" suggested Anne.\n\n\"Maybe 'twas.  _I_'d rather live fifty sensible years than a hundred\nfoolish ones.\"\n\n\"But just think what a dull world it would be if everyone was\nsensible,\" pleaded Anne.\n\nMiss Cornelia disdained any skirmish of flippant epigram.\n\n\"Mrs. Roderick was a Milgrave, and the Milgraves never had much sense.\nHer nephew, Ebenezer Milgrave, used to be insane for years.  He\nbelieved he was dead and used to rage at his wife because she wouldn't\nbury him.  _I_'d a-done it.\"\n\nMiss Cornelia looked so grimly determined that Anne could almost see\nher with a spade in her hand.\n\n\"Don't you know ANY good husbands, Miss Bryant?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, lots of them--over yonder,\" said Miss Cornelia, waving her\nhand through the open window towards the little graveyard of the church\nacross the harbor.\n\n\"But living--going about in the flesh?\" persisted Anne.\n\n\"Oh, there's a few, just to show that with God all things are\npossible,\" acknowledged Miss Cornelia reluctantly.  \"I don't deny that\nan odd man here and there, if he's caught young and trained up proper,\nand if his mother has spanked him well beforehand, may turn out a\ndecent being.  YOUR husband, now, isn't so bad, as men go, from all I\nhear.  I s'pose\"--Miss Cornelia looked sharply at Anne over her\nglasses--\"you think there's nobody like him in the world.\"\n\n\"There isn't,\" said Anne promptly.\n\n\"Ah, well, I heard another bride say that once,\" sighed Miss Cornelia.\n\"Jennie Dean thought when she married that there wasn't anybody like\nHER husband in the world.  And she was right--there wasn't!  And a good\nthing, too, believe ME!  He led her an awful life--and he was courting\nhis second wife while Jennie was dying.\n\n\"Wasn't that like a man?  However, I hope YOUR confidence will be\nbetter justified, dearie.  The young doctor is taking real well.  I was\nafraid at first he mightn't, for folks hereabouts have always thought\nold Doctor Dave the only doctor in the world.  Doctor Dave hadn't much\ntact, to be sure--he was always talking of ropes in houses where\nsomeone had hanged himself.  But folks forgot their hurt feelings when\nthey had a pain in their stomachs.  If he'd been a minister instead of\na doctor they'd never have forgiven him.  Soul-ache doesn't worry folks\nnear as much as stomach-ache.  Seeing as we're both Presbyterians and\nno Methodists around, will you tell me your candid opinion of OUR\nminister?\"\n\n\"Why--really--I--well,\" hesitated Anne.\n\nMiss Cornelia nodded.\n\n\"Exactly.  I agree with you, dearie.  We made a mistake when we called\nHIM.  His face just looks like one of those long, narrow stones in the\ngraveyard, doesn't it?  'Sacred to the memory' ought to be written on\nhis forehead.  I shall never forget the first sermon he preached after\nhe came.  It was on the subject of everyone doing what they were best\nfitted for--a very good subject, of course; but such illustrations as\nhe used!  He said, 'If you had a cow and an apple tree, and if you tied\nthe apple tree in your stable and planted the cow in your orchard, with\nher legs up, how much milk would you get from the apple tree, or how\nmany apples from the cow?'  Did you ever hear the like in your born\ndays, dearie?  I was so thankful there were no Methodists there that\nday--they'd never have been done hooting over it.  But what I dislike\nmost in him is his habit of agreeing with everybody, no matter what is\nsaid.  If you said to him, 'You're a scoundrel,' he'd say, with that\nsmooth smile of his, 'Yes, that's so.'  A minister should have more\nbackbone.  The long and the short of it is, I consider him a reverend\njackass.  But, of course, this is just between you and me.  When there\nare Methodists in hearing I praise him to the skies.  Some folks think\nhis wife dresses too gay, but _I_ say when she has to live with a face\nlike that she needs something to cheer her up.  You'll never hear ME\ncondemning a woman for her dress.  I'm only too thankful when her\nhusband isn't too mean and miserly to allow it.  Not that I bother much\nwith dress myself.  Women just dress to please the men, and I'd never\nstoop to THAT.  I have had a real placid, comfortable life, dearie, and\nit's just because I never cared a cent what the men thought.\"\n\n\"Why do you hate the men so, Miss Bryant?\"\n\n\"Lord, dearie, I don't hate them.  They aren't worth it.  I just sort\nof despise them.  I think I'll like YOUR husband if he keeps on as he\nhas begun.  But apart from him about the only men in the world I've\nmuch use for are the old doctor and Captain Jim.\"\n\n\"Captain Jim is certainly splendid,\" agreed Anne cordially.\n\n\"Captain Jim is a good man, but he's kind of vexing in one way.  You\nCAN'T make him mad.  I've tried for twenty years and he just keeps on\nbeing placid.  It does sort of rile me.  And I s'pose the woman he\nshould have married got a man who went into tantrums twice a day.\"\n\n\"Who was she?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know, dearie.  I never remember of Captain Jim making up\nto anybody.  He was edging on old as far as my memory goes.  He's\nseventy-six, you know.  I never heard any reason for his staying a\nbachelor, but there must be one, believe ME.  He sailed all his life\ntill five years ago, and there's no corner of the earth he hasn't poked\nhis nose into.  He and Elizabeth Russell were great cronies, all their\nlives, but they never had any notion of sweet-hearting.  Elizabeth\nnever married, though she had plenty of chances.  She was a great\nbeauty when she was young.  The year the Prince of Wales came to the\nIsland she was visiting her uncle in Charlottetown and he was a\nGovernment official, and so she got invited to the great ball.  She was\nthe prettiest girl there, and the Prince danced with her, and all the\nother women he didn't dance with were furious about it, because their\nsocial standing was higher than hers and they said he shouldn't have\npassed them over.  Elizabeth was always very proud of that dance.  Mean\nfolks said that was why she never married--she couldn't put up with an\nordinary man after dancing with a prince.  But that wasn't so.  She\ntold me the reason once--it was because she had such a temper that she\nwas afraid she couldn't live peaceably with any man.  She HAD an awful\ntemper--she used to have to go upstairs and bite pieces out of her\nbureau to keep it down by times.  But I told her that wasn't any reason\nfor not marrying if she wanted to.  There's no reason why we should let\nthe men have a monopoly of temper, is there, Mrs. Blythe, dearie?\"\n\n\"I've a bit of temper myself,\" sighed Anne.\n\n\"It's well you have, dearie.  You won't be half so likely to be trodden\non, believe ME!  My, how that golden glow of yours is blooming!  Your\ngarden looks fine.  Poor Elizabeth always took such care of it.\"\n\n\"I love it,\" said Anne.  \"I'm glad it's so full of old-fashioned\nflowers.  Speaking of gardening, we want to get a man to dig up that\nlittle lot beyond the fir grove and set it out with strawberry plants\nfor us.  Gilbert is so busy he will never get time for it this fall.\nDo you know anyone we can get?\"\n\n\"Well, Henry Hammond up at the Glen goes out doing jobs like that.\nHe'll do, maybe.  He's always a heap more interested in his wages than\nin his work, just like a man, and he's so slow in the uptake that he\nstands still for five minutes before it dawns on him that he's stopped.\nHis father threw a stump at him when he was small.\n\n\"Nice gentle missile, wasn't it?  So like a man!  Course, the boy never\ngot over it.  But he's the only one I can recommend at all.  He painted\nmy house for me last spring.  It looks real nice now, don't you think?\"\n\nAnne was saved by the clock striking five.\n\n\"Lord, is it that late?\" exclaimed Miss Cornelia.  \"How time does slip\nby when you're enjoying yourself!  Well, I must betake myself home.\"\n\n\"No, indeed!  You are going to stay and have tea with us,\" said Anne\neagerly.\n\n\"Are you asking me because you think you ought to, or because you\nreally want to?\" demanded Miss Cornelia.\n\n\"Because I really want to.\"\n\n\"Then I'll stay.  YOU belong to the race that knows Joseph.\"\n\n\"I know we are going to be friends,\" said Anne, with the smile that\nonly they of the household of faith ever saw.\n\n\"Yes, we are, dearie.  Thank goodness, we can choose our friends.  We\nhave to take our relatives as they are, and be thankful if there are no\npenitentiary birds among them.  Not that I've many--none nearer than\nsecond cousins.  I'm a kind of lonely soul, Mrs. Blythe.\"\n\nThere was a wistful note in Miss Cornelia's voice.\n\n\"I wish you would call me Anne,\" exclaimed Anne impulsively.  \"It would\nseem more HOMEY.  Everyone in Four Winds, except my husband, calls me\nMrs. Blythe, and it makes me feel like a stranger.  Do you know that\nyour name is very near being the one I yearned after when I was a\nchild.  I hated 'Anne' and I called myself 'Cordelia' in imagination.\"\n\n\"I like Anne.  It was my mother's name.  Old-fashioned names are the\nbest and sweetest in my opinion.  If you're going to get tea you might\nsend the young doctor to talk to me.  He's been lying on the sofa in\nthat office ever since I came, laughing fit to kill over what I've been\nsaying.\"\n\n\"How did you know?\" cried Anne, too aghast at this instance of Miss\nCornelia's uncanny prescience to make a polite denial.\n\n\"I saw him sitting beside you when I came up the lane, and I know men's\ntricks,\" retorted Miss Cornelia.  \"There, I've finished my little\ndress, dearie, and the eighth baby can come as soon as it pleases.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nAN EVENING AT FOUR WINDS POINT\n\nIt was late September when Anne and Gilbert were able to pay Four Winds\nlight their promised visit.  They had often planned to go, but\nsomething always occurred to prevent them.  Captain Jim had \"dropped\nin\" several times at the little house.\n\n\"I don't stand on ceremony, Mistress Blythe,\" he told Anne.  \"It's a\nreal pleasure to me to come here, and I'm not going to deny myself jest\nbecause you haven't got down to see me.  There oughtn't to be no\nbargaining like that among the race that knows Joseph.  I'll come when\nI can, and you come when you can, and so long's we have our pleasant\nlittle chat it don't matter a mite what roof's over us.\"\n\nCaptain Jim took a great fancy to Gog and Magog, who were presiding\nover the destinies of the hearth in the little house with as much\ndignity and aplomb as they had done at Patty's Place.\n\n\"Aren't they the cutest little cusses?\" he would say delightedly; and\nhe bade them greeting and farewell as gravely and invariably as he did\nhis host and hostess.  Captain Jim was not going to offend household\ndeities by any lack of reverence and ceremony.\n\n\"You've made this little house just about perfect,\" he told Anne.  \"It\nnever was so nice before.  Mistress Selwyn had your taste and she did\nwonders; but folks in those days didn't have the pretty little curtains\nand pictures and nicknacks you have.  As for Elizabeth, she lived in\nthe past.  You've kinder brought the future into it, so to speak.  I'd\nbe real happy even if we couldn't talk at all, when I come here--jest\nto sit and look at you and your pictures and your flowers would be\nenough of a treat.  It's beautiful--beautiful.\"\n\nCaptain Jim was a passionate worshipper of beauty.  Every lovely thing\nheard or seen gave him a deep, subtle, inner joy that irradiated his\nlife.  He was quite keenly aware of his own lack of outward comeliness\nand lamented it.\n\n\"Folks say I'm good,\" he remarked whimsically upon one occasion, \"but I\nsometimes wish the Lord had made me only half as good and put the rest\nof it into looks.  But there, I reckon He knew what He was about, as a\ngood Captain should.  Some of us have to be homely, or the purty\nones--like Mistress Blythe here--wouldn't show up so well.\"\n\nOne evening Anne and Gilbert finally walked down to the Four Winds\nlight.  The day had begun sombrely in gray cloud and mist, but it had\nended in a pomp of scarlet and gold.  Over the western hills beyond the\nharbor were amber deeps and crystalline shallows, with the fire of\nsunset below.  The north was a mackerel sky of little, fiery golden\nclouds.  The red light flamed on the white sails of a vessel gliding\ndown the channel, bound to a southern port in a land of palms.  Beyond\nher, it smote upon and incarnadined the shining, white, grassless faces\nof the sand dunes.  To the right, it fell on the old house among the\nwillows up the brook, and gave it for a fleeting space casements more\nsplendid than those of an old cathedral.  They glowed out of its quiet\nand grayness like the throbbing, blood-red thoughts of a vivid soul\nimprisoned in a dull husk of environment.\n\n\"That old house up the brook always seems so lonely,\" said Anne.  \"I\nnever see visitors there.  Of course, its lane opens on the upper\nroad--but I don't think there's much coming and going.  It seems odd\nwe've never met the Moores yet, when they live within fifteen minutes'\nwalk of us.  I may have seen them in church, of course, but if so I\ndidn't know them.  I'm sorry they are so unsociable, when they are our\nonly near neighbors.\"\n\n\"Evidently they don't belong to the race that knows Joseph,\" laughed\nGilbert.  \"Have you ever found out who that girl was whom you thought\nso beautiful?\"\n\n\"No.  Somehow I have never remembered to ask about her.  But I've never\nseen her anywhere, so I suppose she must have been a stranger.  Oh, the\nsun has just vanished--and there's the light.\"\n\nAs the dusk deepened, the great beacon cut swathes of light through it,\nsweeping in a circle over the fields and the harbor, the sandbar and\nthe gulf.\n\n\"I feel as if it might catch me and whisk me leagues out to sea,\" said\nAnne, as one drenched them with radiance; and she felt rather relieved\nwhen they got so near the Point that they were inside the range of\nthose dazzling, recurrent flashes.\n\nAs they turned into the little lane that led across the fields to the\nPoint they met a man coming out of it--a man of such extraordinary\nappearance that for a moment they both frankly stared.  He was a\ndecidedly fine-looking person-tall, broad-shouldered, well-featured,\nwith a Roman nose and frank gray eyes; he was dressed in a prosperous\nfarmer's Sunday best; in so far he might have been any inhabitant of\nFour Winds or the Glen.  But, flowing over his breast nearly to his\nknees, was a river of crinkly brown beard; and adown his back, beneath\nhis commonplace felt hat, was a corresponding cascade of thick, wavy,\nbrown hair.\n\n\"Anne,\" murmured Gilbert, when they were out of earshot, \"you didn't\nput what Uncle Dave calls 'a little of the Scott Act' in that lemonade\nyou gave me just before we left home, did you?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't,\" said Anne, stifling her laughter, lest the retreating\nenigma should hear here.  \"Who in the world can he be?\"\n\n\"I don't know; but if Captain Jim keeps apparitions like that down at\nthis Point I'm going to carry cold iron in my pocket when I come here.\nHe wasn't a sailor, or one might pardon his eccentricity of appearance;\nhe must belong to the over-harbor clans.  Uncle Dave says they have\nseveral freaks over there.\"\n\n\"Uncle Dave is a little prejudiced, I think.  You know all the\nover-harbor people who come to the Glen Church seem very nice.  Oh,\nGilbert, isn't this beautiful?\"\n\nThe Four Winds light was built on a spur of red sand-stone cliff\njutting out into the gulf.  On one side, across the channel, stretched\nthe silvery sand shore of the bar; on the other, extended a long,\ncurving beach of red cliffs, rising steeply from the pebbled coves.  It\nwas a shore that knew the magic and mystery of storm and star.  There\nis a great solitude about such a shore.  The woods are never\nsolitary--they are full of whispering, beckoning, friendly life.  But\nthe sea is a mighty soul, forever moaning of some great, unshareable\nsorrow, which shuts it up into itself for all eternity.  We can never\npierce its infinite mystery--we may only wander, awed and spellbound,\non the outer fringe of it.  The woods call to us with a hundred voices,\nbut the sea has one only--a mighty voice that drowns our souls in its\nmajestic music.  The woods are human, but the sea is of the company of\nthe archangels.\n\nAnne and Gilbert found Uncle Jim sitting on a bench outside the\nlighthouse, putting the finishing touches to a wonderful, full-rigged,\ntoy schooner.  He rose and welcomed them to his abode with the gentle,\nunconscious courtesy that became him so well.\n\n\"This has been a purty nice day all through, Mistress Blythe, and now,\nright at the last, it's brought its best.  Would you like to sit down\nhere outside a bit, while the light lasts?  I've just finished this bit\nof a plaything for my little grand nephew, Joe, up at the Glen.  After\nI promised to make it for him I was kinder sorry, for his mother was\nvexed.  She's afraid he'll be wanting to go to sea later on and she\ndoesn't want the notion encouraged in him.  But what could I do,\nMistress Blythe?  I'd PROMISED him, and I think it's sorter real\ndastardly to break a promise you make to a child.  Come, sit down.  It\nwon't take long to stay an hour.\"\n\nThe wind was off shore, and only broke the sea's surface into long,\nsilvery ripples, and sent sheeny shadows flying out across it, from\nevery point and headland, like transparent wings.  The dusk was hanging\na curtain of violet gloom over the sand dunes and the headlands where\ngulls were huddling.  The sky was faintly filmed over with scarfs of\nsilken vapor.  Cloud fleets rode at anchor along the horizons.  An\nevening star was watching over the bar.\n\n\"Isn't that a view worth looking at?\" said Captain Jim, with a loving,\nproprietary pride.  \"Nice and far from the market-place, ain't it?  No\nbuying and selling and getting gain.  You don't have to pay\nanything--all that sea and sky free--'without money and without price.'\nThere's going to be a moonrise purty soon, too--I'm never tired of\nfinding out what a moonrise can be over them rocks and sea and harbor.\nThere's a surprise in it every time.\"\n\nThey had their moonrise, and watched its marvel and magic in a silence\nthat asked nothing of the world or each other.  Then they went up into\nthe tower, and Captain Jim showed and explained the mechanism of the\ngreat light.  Finally they found themselves in the dining room, where a\nfire of driftwood was weaving flames of wavering, elusive, sea-born\nhues in the open fireplace.\n\n\"I put this fireplace in myself,\" remarked Captain Jim.  \"The\nGovernment don't give lighthouse keepers such luxuries.  Look at the\ncolors that wood makes.  If you'd like some driftwood for your fire,\nMistress Blythe, I'll bring you up a load some day.  Sit down.  I'm\ngoing to make you a cup of tea.\"\n\nCaptain Jim placed a chair for Anne, having first removed therefrom a\nhuge, orange-colored cat and a newspaper.\n\n\"Get down, Matey.  The sofa is your place.  I must put this paper away\nsafe till I can find time to finish the story in it.  It's called A Mad\nLove.  'Tisn't my favorite brand of fiction, but I'm reading it jest to\nsee how long she can spin it out.  It's at the sixty-second chapter\nnow, and the wedding ain't any nearer than when it begun, far's I can\nsee.  When little Joe comes I have to read him pirate yarns.  Ain't it\nstrange how innocent little creatures like children like the\nblood-thirstiest stories?\"\n\n\"Like my lad Davy at home,\" said Anne.  \"He wants tales that reek with\ngore.\"\n\nCaptain Jim's tea proved to be nectar.  He was pleased as a child with\nAnne's compliments, but he affected a fine indifference.\n\n\"The secret is I don't skimp the cream,\" he remarked airily.  Captain\nJim had never heard of Oliver Wendell Holmes, but he evidently agreed\nwith that writer's dictum that \"big heart never liked little cream pot.\"\n\n\"We met an odd-looking personage coming out of your lane,\" said Gilbert\nas they sipped.  \"Who was he?\"\n\nCaptain Jim grinned.\n\n\"That's Marshall Elliott--a mighty fine man with jest one streak of\nfoolishness in him.  I s'pose you wondered what his object was in\nturning himself into a sort of dime museum freak.\"\n\n\"Is he a modern Nazarite or a Hebrew prophet left over from olden\ntimes?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"Neither of them.  It's politics that's at the bottom of his freak.\nAll those Elliotts and Crawfords and MacAllisters are dyed-in-the-wool\npoliticians.  They're born Grit or Tory, as the case may be, and they\nlive Grit or Tory, and they die Grit or Tory; and what they're going to\ndo in heaven, where there's probably no politics, is more than I can\nfathom.  This Marshall Elliott was born a Grit.  I'm a Grit myself in\nmoderation, but there's no moderation about Marshall.  Fifteen years\nago there was a specially bitter general election.  Marshall fought for\nhis party tooth and nail.  He was dead sure the Liberals would win--so\nsure that he got up at a public meeting and vowed that he wouldn't\nshave his face or cut his hair until the Grits were in power.  Well,\nthey didn't go in--and they've never got in yet--and you saw the result\ntoday for yourselves.  Marshall stuck to his word.\"\n\n\"What does his wife think of it?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"He's a bachelor.  But if he had a wife I reckon she couldn't make him\nbreak that vow.  That family of Elliotts has always been more stubborn\nthan natteral.  Marshall's brother Alexander had a dog he set great\nstore by, and when it died the man actilly wanted to have it buried in\nthe graveyard, 'along with the other Christians,' he said.  Course, he\nwasn't allowed to; so he buried it just outside the graveyard fence,\nand never darkened the church door again.  But Sundays he'd drive his\nfamily to church and sit by that dog's grave and read his Bible all the\ntime service was going on.  They say when he was dying he asked his\nwife to bury him beside the dog; she was a meek little soul but she\nfired up at THAT.  She said SHE wasn't going to be buried beside no\ndog, and if he'd rather have his last resting place beside the dog than\nbeside her, jest to say so.  Alexander Elliott was a stubborn mule, but\nhe was fond of his wife, so he give in and said, 'Well, durn it, bury\nme where you please.  But when Gabriel's trump blows I expect my dog to\nrise with the rest of us, for he had as much soul as any durned Elliott\nor Crawford or MacAllister that ever strutted.'  Them was HIS parting\nwords.  As for Marshall, we're all used to him, but he must strike\nstrangers as right down peculiar-looking.  I've known him ever since he\nwas ten--he's about fifty now--and I like him.  Him and me was out\ncod-fishing today.  That's about all I'm good for now--catching trout\nand cod occasional.  But 'tweren't always so--not by no manner of\nmeans.  I used to do other things, as you'd admit if you saw my\nlife-book.\"\n\nAnne was just going to ask what his life-book was when the First Mate\ncreated a diversion by springing upon Captain Jim's knee.  He was a\ngorgeous beastie, with a face as round as a full moon, vivid green\neyes, and immense, white, double paws.  Captain Jim stroked his velvet\nback gently.\n\n\"I never fancied cats much till I found the First Mate,\" he remarked,\nto the accompaniment of the Mate's tremendous purrs.  \"I saved his\nlife, and when you've saved a creature's life you're bound to love it.\nIt's next thing to giving life.  There's some turrible thoughtless\npeople in the world, Mistress Blythe.  Some of them city folks who have\nsummer homes over the harbor are so thoughtless that they're cruel.\nIt's the worst kind of cruelty--the thoughtless kind.  You can't cope\nwith it.  They keep cats there in the summer, and feed and pet 'em, and\ndoll 'em up with ribbons and collars.  And then in the fall they go off\nand leave 'em to starve or freeze.  It makes my blood boil, Mistress\nBlythe.  One day last winter I found a poor old mother cat dead on the\nshore, lying against the skin-and-bone bodies of her three little\nkittens.  She'd died trying to shelter 'em.  She had her poor stiff\npaws around 'em.  Master, I cried.  Then I swore.  Then I carried them\npoor little kittens home and fed 'em up and found good homes for 'em.\nI knew the woman who left the cat and when she come back this summer I\njest went over the harbor and told her my opinion of her.  It was rank\nmeddling, but I do love meddling in a good cause.\"\n\n\"How did she take it?\" asked Gilbert.\n\n\"Cried and said she 'didn't think.'  I says to her, says I, 'Do you\ns'pose that'll be held for a good excuse in the day of Jedgment, when\nyou'll have to account for that poor old mother's life?  The Lord'll\nask you what He give you your brains for if it wasn't to think, I\nreckon.'  I don't fancy she'll leave cats to starve another time.\"\n\n\"Was the First Mate one of the forsaken?\" asked Anne, making advances\nto him which were responded to graciously, if condescendingly.\n\n\"Yes.  I found HIM one bitter cold day in winter, caught in the\nbranches of a tree by his durn-fool ribbon collar.  He was almost\nstarving.  If you could have seen his eyes, Mistress Blythe!  He was\nnothing but a kitten, and he'd got his living somehow since he'd been\nleft until he got hung up.  When I loosed him he gave my hand a pitiful\nswipe with his little red tongue.  He wasn't the able seaman you see\nnow.  He was meek as Moses.  That was nine years ago.  His life has\nbeen long in the land for a cat.  He's a good old pal, the First Mate\nis.\"\n\n\"I should have expected you to have a dog,\" said Gilbert.\n\nCaptain Jim shook his head.\n\n\"I had a dog once.  I thought so much of him that when he died I\ncouldn't bear the thought of getting another in his place.  He was a\nFRIEND--you understand, Mistress Blythe?  Matey's only a pal.  I'm fond\nof Matey--all the fonder on account of the spice of devilment that's in\nhim--like there is in all cats.  But I LOVED my dog.  I always had a\nsneaking sympathy for Alexander Elliott about HIS dog.  There isn't any\ndevil in a good dog.  That's why they're more lovable than cats, I\nreckon.  But I'm darned if they're as interesting.  Here I am, talking\ntoo much.  Why don't you check me?  When I do get a chance to talk to\nanyone I run on turrible.  If you've done your tea I've a few little\nthings you might like to look at--picked 'em up in the queer corners I\nused to be poking my nose into.\"\n\nCaptain Jim's \"few little things\" turned out to be a most interesting\ncollection of curios, hideous, quaint and beautiful.  And almost every\none had some striking story attached to it.\n\nAnne never forgot the delight with which she listened to those old\ntales that moonlit evening by that enchanted driftwood fire, while the\nsilver sea called to them through the open window and sobbed against\nthe rocks below them.\n\nCaptain Jim never said a boastful word, but it was impossible to help\nseeing what a hero the man had been--brave, true, resourceful,\nunselfish.  He sat there in his little room and made those things live\nagain for his hearers.  By a lift of the eyebrow, a twist of the lip, a\ngesture, a word, he painted a whole scene or character so that they saw\nit as it was.\n\nSome of Captain Jim's adventures had such a marvellous edge that Anne\nand Gilbert secretly wondered if he were not drawing a rather long bow\nat their credulous expense.  But in this, as they found later, they did\nhim injustice.  His tales were all literally true.  Captain Jim had the\ngift of the born storyteller, whereby \"unhappy, far-off things\" can be\nbrought vividly before the hearer in all their pristine poignancy.\n\nAnne and Gilbert laughed and shivered over his tales, and once Anne\nfound herself crying.  Captain Jim surveyed her tears with pleasure\nshining from his face.\n\n\"I like to see folks cry that way,\" he remarked.  \"It's a compliment.\nBut I can't do justice to the things I've seen or helped to do.  I've\n'em all jotted down in my life-book, but I haven't got the knack of\nwriting them out properly.  If I could hit on jest the right words and\nstring 'em together proper on paper I could make a great book.  It\nwould beat A Mad Love holler, and I believe Joe'd like it as well as\nthe pirate yarns.  Yes, I've had some adventures in my time; and, do\nyou know, Mistress Blythe, I still lust after 'em.  Yes, old and\nuseless as I be, there's an awful longing sweeps over me at times to\nsail out--out--out there--forever and ever.\"\n\n\"Like Ulysses, you would\n\n    'Sail beyond the sunset and the baths\n     Of all the western stars until you die,'\"\n\nsaid Anne dreamily.\n\n\"Ulysses?  I've read of him.  Yes, that's just how I feel--jest how all\nus old sailors feel, I reckon.  I'll die on land after all, I s'pose.\nWell, what is to be will be.  There was old William Ford at the Glen\nwho never went on the water in his life, 'cause he was afraid of being\ndrowned.  A fortune-teller had predicted he would be.  And one day he\nfainted and fell with his face in the barn trough and was drowned.\nMust you go?  Well, come soon and come often.  The doctor is to do the\ntalking next time.  He knows a heap of things I want to find out.  I'm\nsorter lonesome here by times.  It's been worse since Elizabeth Russell\ndied.  Her and me was such cronies.\"\n\nCaptain Jim spoke with the pathos of the aged, who see their old\nfriends slipping from them one by one--friends whose place can never be\nquite filled by those of a younger generation, even of the race that\nknows Joseph.  Anne and Gilbert promised to come soon and often.\n\n\"He's a rare old fellow, isn't he?\" said Gilbert, as they walked home.\n\n\"Somehow, I can't reconcile his simple, kindly personality with the\nwild, adventurous life he has lived,\" mused Anne.\n\n\"You wouldn't find it so hard if you had seen him the other day down at\nthe fishing village.  One of the men of Peter Gautier's boat made a\nnasty remark about some girl along the shore.  Captain Jim fairly\nscorched the wretched fellow with the lightning of his eyes.  He seemed\na man transformed.  He didn't say much--but the way he said it!  You'd\nhave thought it would strip the flesh from the fellow's bones.  I\nunderstand that Captain Jim will never allow a word against any woman\nto be said in his presence.\"\n\n\"I wonder why he never married,\" said Anne.  \"He should have sons with\ntheir ships at sea now, and grandchildren climbing over him to hear his\nstories--he's that kind of a man.  Instead, he has nothing but a\nmagnificent cat.\"\n\nBut Anne was mistaken.  Captain Jim had more than that.  He had a\nmemory.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nLESLIE MOORE\n\n\"I'm going for a walk to the outside shore tonight,\" Anne told Gog and\nMagog one October evening.  There was no one else to tell, for Gilbert\nhad gone over the harbor.  Anne had her little domain in the speckless\norder one would expect of anyone brought up by Marilla Cuthbert, and\nfelt that she could gad shoreward with a clear conscience.  Many and\ndelightful had been her shore rambles, sometimes with Gilbert,\nsometimes with Captain Jim, sometimes alone with her own thoughts and\nnew, poignantly-sweet dreams that were beginning to span life with\ntheir rainbows.  She loved the gentle, misty harbor shore and the\nsilvery, wind-haunted sand shore, but best of all she loved the rock\nshore, with its cliffs and caves and piles of surf-worn boulders, and\nits coves where the pebbles glittered under the pools; and it was to\nthis shore she hied herself tonight.\n\nThere had been an autumn storm of wind and rain, lasting for three\ndays.  Thunderous had been the crash of billows on the rocks, wild the\nwhite spray and spume that blew over the bar, troubled and misty and\ntempest-torn the erstwhile blue peace of Four Winds Harbor.  Now it was\nover, and the shore lay clean-washed after the storm; not a wind\nstirred, but there was still a fine surf on, dashing on sand and rock\nin a splendid white turmoil--the only restless thing in the great,\npervading stillness and peace.\n\n\"Oh, this is a moment worth living through weeks of storm and stress\nfor,\" Anne exclaimed, delightedly sending her far gaze across the\ntossing waters from the top of the cliff where she stood.  Presently\nshe scrambled down the steep path to the little cove below, where she\nseemed shut in with rocks and sea and sky.\n\n\"I'm going to dance and sing,\" she said.  \"There's no one here to see\nme--the seagulls won't carry tales of the matter.  I may be as crazy as\nI like.\"\n\nShe caught up her skirt and pirouetted along the hard strip of sand\njust out of reach of the waves that almost lapped her feet with their\nspent foam.  Whirling round and round, laughing like a child, she\nreached the little headland that ran out to the east of the cove; then\nshe stopped suddenly, blushing crimson; she was not alone; there had\nbeen a witness to her dance and laughter.\n\nThe girl of the golden hair and sea-blue eyes was sitting on a boulder\nof the headland, half-hidden by a jutting rock.  She was looking\nstraight at Anne with a strange expression--part wonder, part sympathy,\npart--could it be?--envy.  She was bare-headed, and her splendid hair,\nmore than ever like Browning's \"gorgeous snake,\" was bound about her\nhead with a crimson ribbon.  She wore a dress of some dark material,\nvery plainly made; but swathed about her waist, outlining its fine\ncurves, was a vivid girdle of red silk.  Her hands, clasped over her\nknee, were brown and somewhat work-hardened; but the skin of her throat\nand cheeks was as white as cream.  A flying gleam of sunset broke\nthrough a low-lying western cloud and fell across her hair.  For a\nmoment she seemed the spirit of the sea personified--all its mystery,\nall its passion, all its elusive charm.\n\n\"You--you must think me crazy,\" stammered Anne, trying to recover her\nself-possession.  To be seen by this stately girl in such an abandon of\nchildishness--she, Mrs. Dr. Blythe, with all the dignity of the matron\nto keep up--it was too bad!\n\n\"No,\" said the girl, \"I don't.\"\n\nShe said nothing more; her voice was expressionless; her manner\nslightly repellent; but there was something in her eyes--eager yet shy,\ndefiant yet pleading--which turned Anne from her purpose of walking\naway.  Instead, she sat down on the boulder beside the girl.\n\n\"Let's introduce ourselves,\" she said, with the smile that had never\nyet failed to win confidence and friendliness.  \"I am Mrs. Blythe--and\nI live in that little white house up the harbor shore.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said the girl.  \"I am Leslie Moore--Mrs. Dick Moore,\"\nshe added stiffly.\n\nAnne was silent for a moment from sheer amazement.  It had not occurred\nto her that this girl was married--there seemed nothing of the wife\nabout her.  And that she should be the neighbor whom Anne had pictured\nas a commonplace Four Winds housewife!  Anne could not quickly adjust\nher mental focus to this astonishing change.\n\n\"Then--then you live in that gray house up the brook,\" she stammered.\n\n\"Yes.  I should have gone over to call on you long ago,\" said the\nother.  She did not offer any explanation or excuse for not having gone.\n\n\"I wish you WOULD come,\" said Anne, recovering herself somewhat.\n\"We're such near neighbors we ought to be friends.  That is the sole\nfault of Four Winds--there aren't quite enough neighbors.  Otherwise it\nis perfection.\"\n\n\"You like it?\"\n\n\"LIKE it!  I love it.  It is the most beautiful place I ever saw.\"\n\n\"I've never seen many places,\" said Leslie Moore, slowly, \"but I've\nalways thought it was very lovely here.  I--I love it, too.\"\n\nShe spoke, as she looked, shyly, yet eagerly.  Anne had an odd\nimpression that this strange girl--the word \"girl\" would persist--could\nsay a good deal if she chose.\n\n\"I often come to the shore,\" she added.\n\n\"So do I,\" said Anne.  \"It's a wonder we haven't met here before.\"\n\n\"Probably you come earlier in the evening than I do.  It is generally\nlate--almost dark--when I come.  And I love to come just after a\nstorm--like this.  I don't like the sea so well when it's calm and\nquiet.  I like the struggle--and the crash--and the noise.\"\n\n\"I love it in all its moods,\" declared Anne.  \"The sea at Four Winds is\nto me what Lover's Lane was at home.  Tonight it seemed so free--so\nuntamed--something broke loose in me, too, out of sympathy.  That was\nwhy I danced along the shore in that wild way.  I didn't suppose\nanybody was looking, of course.  If Miss Cornelia Bryant had seen me\nshe would have forboded a gloomy prospect for poor young Dr. Blythe.\"\n\n\"You know Miss Cornelia?\" said Leslie, laughing.  She had an exquisite\nlaugh; it bubbled up suddenly and unexpectedly with something of the\ndelicious quality of a baby's.  Anne laughed, too.\n\n\"Oh, yes.  She has been down to my house of dreams several times.\"\n\n\"Your house of dreams?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's a dear, foolish little name Gilbert and I have for our\nhome.  We just call it that between ourselves.  It slipped out before I\nthought.\"\n\n\"So Miss Russell's little white house is YOUR house of dreams,\" said\nLeslie wonderingly.  \"_I_ had a house of dreams once--but it was a\npalace,\" she added, with a laugh, the sweetness of which was marred by\na little note of derision.\n\n\"Oh, I once dreamed of a palace, too,\" said Anne.  \"I suppose all girls\ndo.  And then we settle down contentedly in eight-room houses that seem\nto fulfill all the desires of our hearts--because our prince is there.\nYOU should have had your palace really, though--you are so beautiful.\nYou MUST let me say it--it has to be said--I'm nearly bursting with\nadmiration.  You are the loveliest thing I ever saw, Mrs. Moore.\"\n\n\"If we are to be friends you must call me Leslie,\" said the other with\nan odd passion.\n\n\"Of course I will.  And MY friends call me Anne.\"\n\n\"I suppose I am beautiful,\" Leslie went on, looking stormily out to\nsea.  \"I hate my beauty.  I wish I had always been as brown and plain\nas the brownest and plainest girl at the fishing village over there.\nWell, what do you think of Miss Cornelia?\"\n\nThe abrupt change of subject shut the door on any further confidences.\n\n\"Miss Cornelia is a darling, isn't she?\" said Anne.  \"Gilbert and I\nwere invited to her house to a state tea last week.  You've heard of\ngroaning tables.\"\n\n\"I seem to recall seeing the expression in the newspaper reports of\nweddings,\" said Leslie, smiling.\n\n\"Well, Miss Cornelia's groaned--at least, it creaked--positively.  You\ncouldn't have believed she would have cooked so much for two ordinary\npeople.  She had every kind of pie you could name, I think--except\nlemon pie.  She said she had taken the prize for lemon pies at the\nCharlottetown Exhibition ten years ago and had never made any since for\nfear of losing her reputation for them.\"\n\n\"Were you able to eat enough pie to please her?\"\n\n\"_I_ wasn't.  Gilbert won her heart by eating--I won't tell you how\nmuch.  She said she never knew a man who didn't like pie better than\nhis Bible.  Do you know, I love Miss Cornelia.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said Leslie.  \"She is the best friend I have in the world.\"\n\nAnne wondered secretly why, if this were so, Miss Cornelia had never\nmentioned Mrs. Dick Moore to her.  Miss Cornelia had certainly talked\nfreely about every other individual in or near Four Winds.\n\n\"Isn't that beautiful?\" said Leslie, after a brief silence, pointing to\nthe exquisite effect of a shaft of light falling through a cleft in the\nrock behind them, across a dark green pool at its base.  \"If I had come\nhere--and seen nothing but just that--I would go home satisfied.\"\n\n\"The effects of light and shadow all along these shores are wonderful,\"\nagreed Anne.  \"My little sewing room looks out on the harbor, and I sit\nat its window and feast my eyes.  The colors and shadows are never the\nsame two minutes together.\"\n\n\"And you are never lonely?\" asked Leslie abruptly.  \"Never--when you\nare alone?\"\n\n\"No.  I don't think I've ever been really lonely in my life,\" answered\nAnne.  \"Even when I'm alone I have real good company--dreams and\nimaginations and pretendings.  I LIKE to be alone now and then, just to\nthink over things and TASTE them.  But I love friendship--and nice,\njolly little times with people.  Oh, WON'T you come to see me--often?\nPlease do.  I believe,\" Anne added, laughing, \"that you'd like me if\nyou knew me.\"\n\n\"I wonder if YOU would like ME,\" said Leslie seriously.  She was not\nfishing for a compliment.  She looked out across the waves that were\nbeginning to be garlanded with blossoms of moonlit foam, and her eyes\nfilled with shadows.\n\n\"I'm sure I would,\" said Anne.  \"And please don't think I'm utterly\nirresponsible because you saw me dancing on the shore at sunset.  No\ndoubt I shall be dignified after a time.  You see, I haven't been\nmarried very long.  I feel like a girl, and sometimes like a child,\nyet.\"\n\n\"I have been married twelve years,\" said Leslie.\n\nHere was another unbelievable thing.\n\n\"Why, you can't be as old as I am!\" exclaimed Anne.  \"You must have\nbeen a child when you were married.\"\n\n\"I was sixteen,\" said Leslie, rising, and picking up the cap and jacket\nlying beside her.  \"I am twenty-eight now.  Well, I must go back.\"\n\n\"So must I.  Gilbert will probably be home.  But I'm so glad we both\ncame to the shore tonight and met each other.\"\n\nLeslie said nothing, and Anne was a little chilled.  She had offered\nfriendship frankly but it had not been accepted very graciously, if it\nhad not been absolutely repelled.  In silence they climbed the cliffs\nand walked across a pasture-field of which the feathery, bleached, wild\ngrasses were like a carpet of creamy velvet in the moonlight.  When\nthey reached the shore lane Leslie turned.\n\n\"I go this way, Mrs. Blythe.  You will come over and see me some time,\nwon't you?\"\n\nAnne felt as if the invitation had been thrown at her.  She got the\nimpression that Leslie Moore gave it reluctantly.\n\n\"I will come if you really want me to,\" she said a little coldly.\n\n\"Oh, I do--I do,\" exclaimed Leslie, with an eagerness which seemed to\nburst forth and beat down some restraint that had been imposed on it.\n\n\"Then I'll come.  Good-night--Leslie.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Mrs. Blythe.\"\n\nAnne walked home in a brown study and poured out her tale to Gilbert.\n\n\"So Mrs. Dick Moore isn't one of the race that knows Joseph?\" said\nGilbert teasingly.\n\n\"No--o--o, not exactly.  And yet--I think she WAS one of them once, but\nhas gone or got into exile,\" said Anne musingly.  \"She is certainly\nvery different from the other women about here.  You can't talk about\neggs and butter to HER.  To think I've been imagining her a second Mrs.\nRachel Lynde!  Have you ever seen Dick Moore, Gilbert?\"\n\n\"No.  I've seen several men working about the fields of the farm, but I\ndon't know which was Moore.\"\n\n\"She never mentioned him.  I KNOW she isn't happy.\"\n\n\"From what you tell me I suppose she was married before she was old\nenough to know her own mind or heart, and found out too late that she\nhad made a mistake.  It's a common tragedy enough, Anne.\n\n\"A fine woman would have made the best of it.  Mrs. Moore has evidently\nlet it make her bitter and resentful.\"\n\n\"Don't let us judge her till we know,\" pleaded Anne.  \"I don't believe\nher case is so ordinary.  You will understand her fascination when you\nmeet her, Gilbert.  It is a thing quite apart from her beauty.  I feel\nthat she possesses a rich nature, into which a friend might enter as\ninto a kingdom; but for some reason she bars every one out and shuts\nall her possibilities up in herself, so that they cannot develop and\nblossom.  There, I've been struggling to define her to myself ever\nsince I left her, and that is the nearest I can get to it.  I'm going\nto ask Miss Cornelia about her.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nTHE STORY OF LESLIE MOORE\n\n\"Yes, the eighth baby arrived a fortnight ago,\" said Miss Cornelia,\nfrom a rocker before the fire of the little house one chilly October\nafternoon.  \"It's a girl.  Fred was ranting mad--said he wanted a\nboy--when the truth is he didn't want it at all.  If it had been a boy\nhe'd have ranted because it wasn't a girl.  They had four girls and\nthree boys before, so I can't see that it made much difference what\nthis one was, but of course he'd have to be cantankerous, just like a\nman.  The baby is real pretty, dressed up in its nice little clothes.\nIt has black eyes and the dearest, tiny hands.\"\n\n\"I must go and see it.  I just love babies,\" said Anne, smiling to\nherself over a thought too dear and sacred to be put into words.\n\n\"I don't say but what they're nice,\" admitted Miss Cornelia.  \"But some\nfolks seem to have more than they really need, believe ME.  My poor\ncousin Flora up at the Glen had eleven, and such a slave as she is!\nHer husband suicided three years ago.  Just like a man!\"\n\n\"What made him do that?\" asked Anne, rather shocked.\n\n\"Couldn't get his way over something, so he jumped into the well.  A\ngood riddance!  He was a born tyrant.  But of course it spoiled the\nwell.  Flora could never abide the thought of using it again, poor\nthing!  So she had another dug and a frightful expense it was, and the\nwater as hard as nails.  If he HAD to drown himself there was plenty of\nwater in the harbor, wasn't there?  I've no patience with a man like\nthat.  We've only had two suicides in Four Winds in my recollection.\nThe other was Frank West--Leslie Moore's father.  By the way, has\nLeslie ever been over to call on you yet?\"\n\n\"No, but I met her on the shore a few nights ago and we scraped an\nacquaintance,\" said Anne, pricking up her ears.\n\nMiss Cornelia nodded.\n\n\"I'm glad, dearie.  I was hoping you'd foregather with her.  What do\nyou think of her?\"\n\n\"I thought her very beautiful.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course.  There was never anybody about Four Winds could touch\nher for looks.  Did you ever see her hair?  It reaches to her feet when\nshe lets it down.  But I meant how did you like her?\"\n\n\"I think I could like her very much if she'd let me,\" said Anne slowly.\n\n\"But she wouldn't let you--she pushed you off and kept you at arm's\nlength.  Poor Leslie!  You wouldn't be much surprised if you knew what\nher life has been.  It's been a tragedy--a tragedy!\" repeated Miss\nCornelia emphatically.\n\n\"I wish you would tell me all about her--that is, if you can do so\nwithout betraying any confidence.\"\n\n\"Lord, dearie, everybody in Four Winds knows poor Leslie's story.  It's\nno secret--the OUTSIDE, that is.  Nobody knows the INSIDE but Leslie\nherself, and she doesn't take folks into her confidence.  I'm about the\nbest friend she has on earth, I reckon, and she's never uttered a word\nof complaint to me.  Have you ever seen Dick Moore?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, I may as well begin at the beginning and tell you everything\nstraight through, so you'll understand it.  As I said, Leslie's father\nwas Frank West.  He was clever and shiftless--just like a man.  Oh, he\nhad heaps of brains--and much good they did him!  He started to go to\ncollege, and he went for two years, and then his health broke down.\nThe Wests were all inclined to be consumptive.  So Frank came home and\nstarted farming.  He married Rose Elliott from over harbor.  Rose was\nreckoned the beauty of Four Winds--Leslie takes her looks from her\nmother, but she has ten times the spirit and go that Rose had, and a\nfar better figure.  Now you know, Anne, I always take the ground that\nus women ought to stand by each other.  We've got enough to endure at\nthe hands of the men, the Lord knows, so I hold we hadn't ought to\nclapper-claw one another, and it isn't often you'll find me running\ndown another woman.  But I never had much use for Rose Elliott.  She\nwas spoiled to begin with, believe ME, and she was nothing but a lazy,\nselfish, whining creature.  Frank was no hand to work, so they were\npoor as Job's turkey.  Poor!  They lived on potatoes and point, believe\nME.  They had two children--Leslie and Kenneth.  Leslie had her\nmother's looks and her father's brains, and something she didn't get\nfrom either of them.  She took after her Grandmother West--a splendid\nold lady.  She was the brightest, friendliest, merriest thing when she\nwas a child, Anne.  Everybody liked her.  She was her father's favorite\nand she was awful fond of him.  They were 'chums,' as she used to say.\nShe couldn't see any of his faults--and he WAS a taking sort of man in\nsome ways.\n\n\"Well, when Leslie was twelve years old, the first dreadful thing\nhappened.  She worshipped little Kenneth--he was four years younger\nthan her, and he WAS a dear little chap.  And he was killed one\nday--fell off a big load of hay just as it was going into the barn, and\nthe wheel went right over his little body and crushed the life out of\nit.  And mind you, Anne, Leslie saw it.  She was looking down from the\nloft.  She gave one screech--the hired man said he never heard such a\nsound in all his life--he said it would ring in his ears till Gabriel's\ntrump drove it out.  But she never screeched or cried again about it.\nShe jumped from the loft onto the load and from the load to the floor,\nand caught up the little bleeding, warm, dead body, Anne--they had to\ntear it from her before she would let it go.  They sent for me--I can't\ntalk of it.\"\n\nMiss Cornelia wiped the tears from her kindly brown eyes and sewed in\nbitter silence for a few minutes.\n\n\"Well,\" she resumed, \"it was all over--they buried little Kenneth in\nthat graveyard over the harbor, and after a while Leslie went back to\nher school and her studies.  She never mentioned Kenneth's name--I've\nnever heard it cross her lips from that day to this.  I reckon that old\nhurt still aches and burns at times; but she was only a child and time\nis real kind to children, Anne, dearie.  After a while she began to\nlaugh again--she had the prettiest laugh.  You don't often hear it now.\"\n\n\"I heard it once the other night,\" said Anne.  \"It IS a beautiful\nlaugh.\"\n\n\"Frank West began to go down after Kenneth's death.  He wasn't strong\nand it was a shock to him, because he was real fond of the child,\nthough, as I've said, Leslie was his favorite.  He got mopy and\nmelancholy, and couldn't or wouldn't work.  And one day, when Leslie\nwas fourteen years of age, he hanged himself--and in the parlor, too,\nmind you, Anne, right in the middle of the parlor from the lamp hook in\nthe ceiling.  Wasn't that like a man?  It was the anniversary of his\nwedding day, too.  Nice, tasty time to pick for it, wasn't it?  And, of\ncourse, that poor Leslie had to be the one to find him.  She went into\nthe parlor that morning, singing, with some fresh flowers for the\nvases, and there she saw her father hanging from the ceiling, his face\nas black as a coal.  It was something awful, believe ME!\"\n\n\"Oh, how horrible!\" said Anne, shuddering.  \"The poor, poor child!\"\n\n\"Leslie didn't cry at her father's funeral any more then she had cried\nat Kenneth's.  Rose whooped and howled for two, however, and Leslie had\nall she could do trying to calm and comfort her mother.  I was\ndisgusted with Rose and so was everyone else, but Leslie never got out\nof patience.  She loved her mother.  Leslie is clannish--her own could\nnever do wrong in her eyes.  Well, they buried Frank West beside\nKenneth, and Rose put up a great big monument to him.  It was bigger\nthan his character, believe ME!  Anyhow, it was bigger than Rose could\nafford, for the farm was mortgaged for more than its value.  But not\nlong after Leslie's old grandmother West died and she left Leslie a\nlittle money--enough to give her a year at Queen's Academy.  Leslie had\nmade up her mind to pass for a teacher if she could, and then earn\nenough to put herself through Redmond College.  That had been her\nfather's pet scheme--he wanted her to have what he had lost.  Leslie\nwas full of ambition and her head was chock full of brains.  She went\nto Queen's, and she took two years' work in one year and got her First;\nand when she came home she got the Glen school.  She was so happy and\nhopeful and full of life and eagerness.  When I think of what she was\nthen and what she is now, I say--drat the men!\"\n\nMiss Cornelia snipped her thread off as viciously as if, Nero-like, she\nwas severing the neck of mankind by the stroke.\n\n\"Dick Moore came into her life that summer.  His father, Abner Moore,\nkept store at the Glen, but Dick had a sea-going streak in him from his\nmother; he used to sail in summer and clerk in his father's store in\nwinter.  He was a big, handsome fellow, with a little ugly soul.  He\nwas always wanting something till he got it, and then he stopped\nwanting it--just like a man.  Oh, he didn't growl at the weather when\nit was fine, and he was mostly real pleasant and agreeable when\neverything went right.  But he drank a good deal, and there were some\nnasty stories told of him and a girl down at the fishing village.  He\nwasn't fit for Leslie to wipe her feet on, that's the long and short of\nit.  And he was a Methodist!  But he was clean mad about her--because\nof her good looks in the first place, and because she wouldn't have\nanything to say to him in the second.  He vowed he'd have her--and he\ngot her!\"\n\n\"How did he bring it about?\"\n\n\"Oh, it was an iniquitous thing!  I'll never forgive Rose West.  You\nsee, dearie, Abner Moore held the mortgage on the West farm, and the\ninterest was overdue some years, and Dick just went and told Mrs. West\nthat if Leslie wouldn't marry him he'd get his father to foreclose the\nmortgage.  Rose carried on terrible--fainted and wept, and pleaded with\nLeslie not to let her be turned out of her home.  She said it would\nbreak her heart to leave the home she'd come to as a bride.  I wouldn't\nhave blamed her for feeling dreadful bad over it--but you wouldn't have\nthought she'd be so selfish as to sacrifice her own flesh and blood\nbecause of it, would you?  Well, she was.\n\n\"And Leslie gave in--she loved her mother so much she would have done\nanything to save her pain.  She married Dick Moore.  None of us knew\nwhy at the time.  It wasn't till long afterward that I found out how\nher mother had worried her into it.  I was sure there was something\nwrong, though, because I knew how she had snubbed him time and again,\nand it wasn't like Leslie to turn face--about like that.  Besides, I\nknew that Dick Moore wasn't the kind of man Leslie could ever fancy, in\nspite of his good looks and dashing ways.  Of course, there was no\nwedding, but Rose asked me to go and see them married.  I went, but I\nwas sorry I did.  I'd seen Leslie's face at her brother's funeral and\nat her father's funeral--and now it seemed to me I was seeing it at her\nown funeral.  But Rose was smiling as a basket of chips, believe ME!\n\n\"Leslie and Dick settled down on the West place--Rose couldn't bear to\npart with her dear daughter!--and lived there for the winter.  In the\nspring Rose took pneumonia and died--a year too late!  Leslie was\nheart-broken enough over it.  Isn't it terrible the way some unworthy\nfolks are loved, while others that deserve it far more, you'd think,\nnever get much affection?  As for Dick, he'd had enough of quiet\nmarried life--just like a man.  He was for up and off.  He went over to\nNova Scotia to visit his relations--his father had come from Nova\nScotia--and he wrote back to Leslie that his cousin, George Moore, was\ngoing on a voyage to Havana and he was going too.  The name of the\nvessel was the Four Sisters and they were to be gone about nine weeks.\n\n\"It must have been a relief to Leslie.  But she never said anything.\nFrom the day of her marriage she was just what she is now--cold and\nproud, and keeping everyone but me at a distance.  I won't BE kept at a\ndistance, believe ME!  I've just stuck to Leslie as close as I knew how\nin spite of everything.\"\n\n\"She told me you were the best friend she had,\" said Anne.\n\n\"Did she?\" exclaimed Miss Cornelia delightedly.  \"Well, I'm real\nthankful to hear it.  Sometimes I've wondered if she really did want me\naround at all--she never let me think so.  You must have thawed her out\nmore than you think, or she wouldn't have said that much itself to you.\nOh, that poor, heart-broken girl!  I never see Dick Moore but I want to\nrun a knife clean through him.\"\n\nMiss Cornelia wiped her eyes again and having relieved her feelings by\nher blood-thirsty wish, took up her tale.\n\n\"Well, Leslie was left over there alone.  Dick had put in the crop\nbefore he went, and old Abner looked after it.  The summer went by and\nthe Four Sisters didn't come back.  The Nova Scotia Moores\ninvestigated, and found she had got to Havana and discharged her cargo\nand took on another and left for home; and that was all they ever found\nout about her.  By degrees people began to talk of Dick Moore as one\nthat was dead.  Almost everyone believed that he was, though no one\nfelt certain, for men have turned up here at the harbor after they'd\nbeen gone for years.  Leslie never thought he was dead--and she was\nright.  A thousand pities too!  The next summer Captain Jim was in\nHavana--that was before he gave up the sea, of course.  He thought he'd\npoke round a bit--Captain Jim was always meddlesome, just like a\nman--and he went to inquiring round among the sailors' boarding houses\nand places like that, to see if he could find out anything about the\ncrew of the Four Sisters.  He'd better have let sleeping dogs lie, in\nmy opinion!  Well, he went to one out-of-the-way place, and there he\nfound a man he knew at first sight it was Dick Moore, though he had a\nbig beard.  Captain Jim got it shaved off and then there was no\ndoubt--Dick Moore it was--his body at least.  His mind wasn't there--as\nfor his soul, in my opinion he never had one!\"\n\n\"What had happened to him?\"\n\n\"Nobody knows the rights of it.  All the folks who kept the boarding\nhouse could tell was that about a year before they had found him lying\non their doorstep one morning in an awful condition--his head battered\nto a jelly almost.  They supposed he'd got hurt in some drunken row,\nand likely that's the truth of it.  They took him in, never thinking he\ncould live.  But he did--and he was just like a child when he got well.\nHe hadn't memory or intellect or reason.  They tried to find out who he\nwas but they never could.  He couldn't even tell them his name--he\ncould only say a few simple words.  He had a letter on him beginning\n'Dear Dick' and signed 'Leslie,' but there was no address on it and the\nenvelope was gone.  They let him stay on--he learned to do a few odd\njobs about the place--and there Captain Jim found him.  He brought him\nhome--I've always said it was a bad day's work, though I s'pose there\nwas nothing else he could do.  He thought maybe when Dick got home and\nsaw his old surroundings and familiar faces his memory would wake up.\nBut it hadn't any effect.  There he's been at the house up the brook\never since.  He's just like a child, no more nor less.  Takes fractious\nspells occasionally, but mostly he's just vacant and good humored and\nharmless.  He's apt to run away if he isn't watched.  That's the burden\nLeslie has had to carry for eleven years--and all alone.  Old Abner\nMoore died soon after Dick was brought home and it was found he was\nalmost bankrupt.  When things were settled up there was nothing for\nLeslie and Dick but the old West farm.  Leslie rented it to John Ward,\nand the rent is all she has to live on.  Sometimes in summer she takes\na boarder to help out.  But most visitors prefer the other side of the\nharbor where the hotels and summer cottages are.  Leslie's house is too\nfar from the bathing shore.  She's taken care of Dick and she's never\nbeen away from him for eleven years--she's tied to that imbecile for\nlife.  And after all the dreams and hopes she once had!  You can\nimagine what it has been like for her, Anne, dearie--with her beauty\nand spirit and pride and cleverness.  It's just been a living death.\"\n\n\"Poor, poor girl!\" said Anne again.  Her own happiness seemed to\nreproach her.  What right had she to be so happy when another human\nsoul must be so miserable?\n\n\"Will you tell me just what Leslie said and how she acted the night you\nmet her on the shore?\" asked Miss Cornelia.\n\nShe listened intently and nodded her satisfaction.\n\n\"YOU thought she was stiff and cold, Anne, dearie, but I can tell you\nshe thawed out wonderful for her.  She must have taken to you real\nstrong.  I'm so glad.  You may be able to help her a good deal.  I was\nthankful when I heard that a young couple was coming to this house, for\nI hoped it would mean some friends for Leslie; especially if you\nbelonged to the race that knows Joseph.  You WILL be her friend, won't\nyou, Anne, dearie?\"\n\n\"Indeed I will, if she'll let me,\" said Anne, with all her own sweet,\nimpulsive earnestness.\n\n\"No, you must be her friend, whether she'll let you or not,\" said Miss\nCornelia resolutely.  \"Don't you mind if she's stiff by times--don't\nnotice it.  Remember what her life has been--and is--and must always\nbe, I suppose, for creatures like Dick Moore live forever, I\nunderstand.  You should see how fat he's got since he came home.  He\nused to be lean enough.  Just MAKE her be friends--you can do\nit--you're one of those who have the knack.  Only you mustn't be\nsensitive.  And don't mind if she doesn't seem to want you to go over\nthere much.  She knows that some women don't like to be where Dick\nis--they complain he gives them the creeps.  Just get her to come over\nhere as often as she can.  She can't get away so very much--she can't\nleave Dick long, for the Lord knows what he'd do--burn the house down\nmost likely.  At nights, after he's in bed and asleep, is about the\nonly time she's free.  He always goes to bed early and sleeps like the\ndead till next morning.  That is how you came to meet her at the shore\nlikely.  She wanders there considerable.\"\n\n\"I will do everything I can for her,\" said Anne.  Her interest in\nLeslie Moore, which had been vivid ever since she had seen her driving\nher geese down the hill, was intensified a thousand fold by Miss\nCornelia's narration.  The girl's beauty and sorrow and loneliness drew\nher with an irresistible fascination.  She had never known anyone like\nher; her friends had hitherto been wholesome, normal, merry girls like\nherself, with only the average trials of human care and bereavement to\nshadow their girlish dreams.  Leslie Moore stood apart, a tragic,\nappealing figure of thwarted womanhood.  Anne resolved that she would\nwin entrance into the kingdom of that lonely soul and find there the\ncomradeship it could so richly give, were it not for the cruel fetters\nthat held it in a prison not of its own making.\n\n\"And mind you this, Anne, dearie,\" said Miss Cornelia, who had not yet\nwholly relieved her mind, \"You mustn't think Leslie is an infidel\nbecause she hardly ever goes to church--or even that she's a Methodist.\nShe can't take Dick to church, of course--not that he ever troubled\nchurch much in his best days.  But you just remember that she's a real\nstrong Presbyterian at heart, Anne, dearie.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nLESLIE COMES OVER\n\nLeslie came over to the house of dreams one frosty October night, when\nmoonlit mists were hanging over the harbor and curling like silver\nribbons along the seaward glens.  She looked as if she repented coming\nwhen Gilbert answered her knock; but Anne flew past him, pounced on\nher, and drew her in.\n\n\"I'm so glad you picked tonight for a call,\" she said gaily.  \"I made\nup a lot of extra good fudge this afternoon and we want someone to help\nus eat it--before the fire--while we tell stories.  Perhaps Captain Jim\nwill drop in, too.  This is his night.\"\n\n\"No.  Captain Jim is over home,\" said Leslie.  \"He--he made me come\nhere,\" she added, half defiantly.\n\n\"I'll say a thank-you to him for that when I see him,\" said Anne,\npulling easy chairs before the fire.\n\n\"Oh, I don't mean that I didn't want to come,\" protested Leslie,\nflushing a little.  \"I--I've been thinking of coming--but it isn't\nalways easy for me to get away.\"\n\n\"Of course it must be hard for you to leave Mr. Moore,\" said Anne, in a\nmatter-of-fact tone.  She had decided that it would be best to mention\nDick Moore occasionally as an accepted fact, and not give undue\nmorbidness to the subject by avoiding it.  She was right, for Leslie's\nair of constraint suddenly vanished.  Evidently she had been wondering\nhow much Anne knew of the conditions of her life and was relieved that\nno explanations were needed.  She allowed her cap and jacket to be\ntaken, and sat down with a girlish snuggle in the big armchair by\nMagog.  She was dressed prettily and carefully, with the customary\ntouch of color in the scarlet geranium at her white throat.  Her\nbeautiful hair gleamed like molten gold in the warm firelight.  Her\nsea-blue eyes were full of soft laughter and allurement. For the\nmoment, under the influence of the little house of dreams, she was a\ngirl again--a girl forgetful of the past and its bitterness.  The\natmosphere of the many loves that had sanctified the little house was\nall about her; the companionship of two healthy, happy, young folks of\nher own generation encircled her; she felt and yielded to the magic of\nher surroundings--Miss Cornelia and Captain Jim would scarcely have\nrecognized her; Anne found it hard to believe that this was the cold,\nunresponsive woman she had met on the shore--this animated girl who\ntalked and listened with the eagerness of a starved soul.  And how\nhungrily Leslie's eyes looked at the bookcases between the windows!\n\n\"Our library isn't very extensive,\" said Anne, \"but every book in it is\na FRIEND.  We've picked our books up through the years, here and there,\nnever buying one until we had first read it and knew that it belonged\nto the race of Joseph.\"\n\nLeslie laughed--beautiful laughter that seemed akin to all the mirth\nthat had echoed through the little house in the vanished years.\n\n\"I have a few books of father's--not many,\" she said.  \"I've read them\nuntil I know them almost by heart.  I don't get many books.  There's a\ncirculating library at the Glen store--but I don't think the committee\nwho pick the books for Mr. Parker know what books are of Joseph's\nrace--or perhaps they don't care.  It was so seldom I got one I really\nliked that I gave up getting any.\"\n\n\"I hope you'll look on our bookshelves as your own,\" said Anne.\n\n\"You are entirely and wholeheartedly welcome to the loan of any book on\nthem.\"\n\n\"You are setting a feast of fat things before me,\" said Leslie,\njoyously.  Then, as the clock struck ten, she rose, half unwillingly.\n\n\"I must go.  I didn't realise it was so late.  Captain Jim is always\nsaying it doesn't take long to stay an hour.  But I've stayed two--and\noh, but I've enjoyed them,\" she added frankly.\n\n\"Come often,\" said Anne and Gilbert.  They had risen and stood together\nin the firelight's glow.  Leslie looked at them--youthful, hopeful,\nhappy, typifying all she had missed and must forever miss.  The light\nwent out of her face and eyes; the girl vanished; it was the sorrowful,\ncheated woman who answered the invitation almost coldly and got herself\naway with a pitiful haste.\n\nAnne watched her until she was lost in the shadows of the chill and\nmisty night.  Then she turned slowly back to the glow of her own\nradiant hearthstone.\n\n\"Isn't she lovely, Gilbert?  Her hair fascinates me.  Miss Cornelia\nsays it reaches to her feet.  Ruby Gillis had beautiful hair--but\nLeslie's is ALIVE--every thread of it is living gold.\"\n\n\"She is very beautiful,\" agreed Gilbert, so heartily that Anne almost\nwished he were a LITTLE less enthusiastic.\n\n\"Gilbert, would you like my hair better if it were like Leslie's?\" she\nasked wistfully.\n\n\"I wouldn't have your hair any color but just what it is for the\nworld,\" said Gilbert, with one or two convincing accompaniments.\n\nYou wouldn't be ANNE if you had golden hair--or hair of any color but\"--\n\n\"Red,\" said Anne, with gloomy satisfaction.\n\n\"Yes, red--to give warmth to that milk-white skin and those shining\ngray-green eyes of yours.  Golden hair wouldn't suit you at all Queen\nAnne--MY Queen Anne--queen of my heart and life and home.\"\n\n\"Then you may admire Leslie's all you like,\" said Anne magnanimously.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nA GHOSTLY EVENING\n\nOne evening, a week later, Anne decided to run over the fields to the\nhouse up the brook for an informal call.  It was an evening of gray fog\nthat had crept in from the gulf, swathed the harbor, filled the glens\nand valleys, and clung heavily to the autumnal meadows.  Through it the\nsea sobbed and shuddered.  Anne saw Four Winds in a new aspect, and\nfound it weird and mysterious and fascinating; but it also gave her a\nlittle feeling of loneliness.  Gilbert was away and would be away until\nthe morrow, attending a medical pow-wow in Charlottetown.  Anne longed\nfor an hour of fellowship with some girl friend.  Captain Jim and Miss\nCornelia were \"good fellows\" each, in their own way; but youth yearned\nto youth.\n\n\"If only Diana or Phil or Pris or Stella could drop in for a chat,\" she\nsaid to herself, \"how delightful it would be!  This is such a GHOSTLY\nnight.  I'm sure all the ships that ever sailed out of Four Winds to\ntheir doom could be seen tonight sailing up the harbor with their\ndrowned crews on their decks, if that shrouding fog could suddenly be\ndrawn aside.  I feel as if it concealed innumerable mysteries--as if I\nwere surrounded by the wraiths of old generations of Four Winds people\npeering at me through that gray veil.  If ever the dear dead ladies of\nthis little house came back to revisit it they would come on just such\na night as this.  If I sit here any longer I'll see one of them there\nopposite me in Gilbert's chair.  This place isn't exactly canny\ntonight.  Even Gog and Magog have an air of pricking up their ears to\nhear the footsteps of unseen guests.  I'll run over to see Leslie\nbefore I frighten myself with my own fancies, as I did long ago in the\nmatter of the Haunted Wood.  I'll leave my house of dreams to welcome\nback its old inhabitants.  My fire will give them my good-will and\ngreeting--they will be gone before I come back, and my house will be\nmine once more.  Tonight I am sure it is keeping a tryst with the past.\"\n\nLaughing a little over her fancy, yet with something of a creepy\nsensation in the region of her spine, Anne kissed her hand to Gog and\nMagog and slipped out into the fog, with some of the new magazines\nunder her arm for Leslie.\n\n\"Leslie's wild for books and magazines,\" Miss Cornelia had told her,\n\"and she hardly ever sees one.  She can't afford to buy them or\nsubscribe for them.  She's really pitifully poor, Anne.  I don't see\nhow she makes out to live at all on the little rent the farm brings in.\nShe never even hints a complaint on the score of poverty, but I know\nwhat it must be.  She's been handicapped by it all her life.  She\ndidn't mind it when she was free and ambitious, but it must gall now,\nbelieve ME.  I'm glad she seemed so bright and merry the evening she\nspent with you.  Captain Jim told me he had fairly to put her cap and\ncoat on and push her out of the door.  Don't be too long going to see\nher either.  If you are she'll think it's because you don't like the\nsight of Dick, and she'll crawl into her shell again.  Dick's a great,\nbig, harmless baby, but that silly grin and chuckle of his do get on\nsome people's nerves.  Thank goodness, I've no nerves myself.  I like\nDick Moore better now than I ever did when he was in his right\nsenses--though the Lord knows that isn't saying much.  I was down there\none day in housecleaning time helping Leslie a bit, and I was frying\ndoughnuts.  Dick was hanging round to get one, as usual, and all at\nonce he picked up a scalding hot one I'd just fished out and dropped it\non the back of my neck when I was bending over.  Then he laughed and\nlaughed.  Believe ME, Anne, it took all the grace of God in my heart to\nkeep me from just whisking up that stew-pan of boiling fat and pouring\nit over his head.\"\n\nAnne laughed over Miss Cornelia's wrath as she sped through the\ndarkness.  But laughter accorded ill with that night.  She was sober\nenough when she reached the house among the willows.  Everything was\nvery silent.  The front part of the house seemed dark and deserted, so\nAnne slipped round to the side door, which opened from the veranda into\na little sitting room.  There she halted noiselessly.\n\nThe door was open.  Beyond, in the dimly lighted room, sat Leslie\nMoore, with her arms flung out on the table and her head bent upon\nthem.  She was weeping horribly--with low, fierce, choking sobs, as if\nsome agony in her soul were trying to tear itself out.  An old black\ndog was sitting by her, his nose resting on his lap, his big doggish\neyes full of mute, imploring sympathy and devotion.  Anne drew back in\ndismay.  She felt that she could not intermeddle with this bitterness.\nHer heart ached with a sympathy she might not utter.  To go in now\nwould be to shut the door forever on any possible help or friendship.\nSome instinct warned Anne that the proud, bitter girl would never\nforgive the one who thus surprised her in her abandonment of despair.\n\nAnne slipped noiselessly from the veranda and found her way across the\nyard.  Beyond, she heard voices in the gloom and saw the dim glow of a\nlight.  At the gate she met two men--Captain Jim with a lantern, and\nanother who she knew must be Dick Moore--a big man, badly gone to fat,\nwith a broad, round, red face, and vacant eyes.  Even in the dull light\nAnne got the impression that there was something unusual about his eyes.\n\n\"Is this you, Mistress Blythe?\" said Captain Jim.  \"Now, now, you\nhadn't oughter be roaming about alone on a night like this.  You could\nget lost in this fog easier than not.  Jest you wait till I see Dick\nsafe inside the door and I'll come back and light you over the fields.\nI ain't going to have Dr. Blythe coming home and finding that you\nwalked clean over Cape Leforce in the fog.  A woman did that once,\nforty years ago.\n\n\"So you've been over to see Leslie,\" he said, when he rejoined her.\n\n\"I didn't go in,\" said Anne, and told what she had seen.  Captain Jim\nsighed.\n\n\"Poor, poor, little girl!  She don't cry often, Mistress Blythe--she's\ntoo brave for that.  She must feel terrible when she does cry.  A night\nlike this is hard on poor women who have sorrows.  There's something\nabout it that kinder brings up all we've suffered--or feared.\"\n\n\"It's full of ghosts,\" said Anne, with a shiver.  \"That was why I came\nover--I wanted to clasp a human hand and hear a human voice.\n\n\"There seem to be so many INHUMAN presences about tonight.  Even my own\ndear house was full of them.  They fairly elbowed me out.  So I fled\nover here for companionship of my kind.\"\n\n\"You were right not to go in, though, Mistress Blythe.  Leslie wouldn't\nhave liked it.  She wouldn't have liked me going in with Dick, as I'd\nhave done if I hadn't met you.  I had Dick down with me all day.  I\nkeep him with me as much as I can to help Leslie a bit.\"\n\n\"Isn't there something odd about his eyes?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"You noticed that?  Yes, one is blue and t'other is hazel--his father\nhad the same.  It's a Moore peculiarity.  That was what told me he was\nDick Moore when I saw him first down in Cuby.  If it hadn't a-bin for\nhis eyes I mightn't a-known him, with his beard and fat.  You know, I\nreckon, that it was me found him and brought him home.  Miss Cornelia\nalways says I shouldn't have done it, but I can't agree with her.  It\nwas the RIGHT thing to do--and so 'twas the only thing.  There ain't no\nquestion in my mind about THAT.  But my old heart aches for Leslie.\nShe's only twenty-eight and she's eaten more bread with sorrow than\nmost women do in eighty years.\"\n\nThey walked on in silence for a little while.  Presently Anne said, \"Do\nyou know, Captain Jim, I never like walking with a lantern.  I have\nalways the strangest feeling that just outside the circle of light,\njust over its edge in the darkness, I am surrounded by a ring of\nfurtive, sinister things, watching me from the shadows with hostile\neyes.  I've had that feeling from childhood.  What is the reason?  I\nnever feel like that when I'm really in the darkness--when it is close\nall around me--I'm not the least frightened.\"\n\n\"I've something of that feeling myself,\" admitted Captain Jim.  \"I\nreckon when the darkness is close to us it is a friend.  But when we\nsorter push it away from us--divorce ourselves from it, so to speak,\nwith lantern light--it becomes an enemy.  But the fog is lifting.\n\n\"There's a smart west wind rising, if you notice.  The stars will be\nout when you get home.\"\n\nThey were out; and when Anne re-entered her house of dreams the red\nembers were still glowing on the hearth, and all the haunting presences\nwere gone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nNOVEMBER DAYS\n\nThe splendor of color which had glowed for weeks along the shores of\nFour Winds Harbor had faded out into the soft gray-blue of late\nautumnal hills.  There came many days when fields and shores were dim\nwith misty rain, or shivering before the breath of a melancholy\nsea-wind--nights, too, of storm and tempest, when Anne sometimes\nwakened to pray that no ship might be beating up the grim north shore,\nfor if it were so not even the great, faithful light whirling through\nthe darkness unafraid, could avail to guide it into safe haven.\n\n\"In November I sometimes feel as if spring could never come again,\" she\nsighed, grieving over the hopeless unsightliness of her frosted and\nbedraggled flower-plots.  The gay little garden of the schoolmaster's\nbride was rather a forlorn place now, and the Lombardies and birches\nwere under bare poles, as Captain Jim said.  But the fir-wood behind\nthe little house was forever green and staunch; and even in November\nand December there came gracious days of sunshine and purple hazes,\nwhen the harbor danced and sparkled as blithely as in midsummer, and\nthe gulf was so softly blue and tender that the storm and the wild wind\nseemed only things of a long-past dream.\n\nAnne and Gilbert spent many an autumn evening at the lighthouse.  It\nwas always a cheery place.  Even when the east wind sang in minor and\nthe sea was dead and gray, hints of sunshine seemed to be lurking all\nabout it.  Perhaps this was because the First Mate always paraded it in\npanoply of gold.  He was so large and effulgent that one hardly missed\nthe sun, and his resounding purrs formed a pleasant accompaniment to\nthe laughter and conversation which went on around Captain Jim's\nfireplace.  Captain Jim and Gilbert had many long discussions and high\nconverse on matters beyond the ken of cat or king.\n\n\"I like to ponder on all kinds of problems, though I can't solve 'em,\"\nsaid Captain Jim.  \"My father held that we should never talk of things\nwe couldn't understand, but if we didn't, doctor, the subjects for\nconversation would be mighty few.  I reckon the gods laugh many a time\nto hear us, but what matters so long as we remember that we're only men\nand don't take to fancying that we're gods ourselves, really, knowing\ngood and evil.  I reckon our pow-wows won't do us or anyone much harm,\nso let's have another whack at the whence, why and whither this\nevening, doctor.\"\n\nWhile they \"whacked,\" Anne listened or dreamed.  Sometimes Leslie went\nto the lighthouse with them, and she and Anne wandered along the shore\nin the eerie twilight, or sat on the rocks below the lighthouse until\nthe darkness drove them back to the cheer of the driftwood fire.  Then\nCaptain Jim would brew them tea and tell them\n\n    \"tales of land and sea\n    And whatsoever might betide\n    The great forgotten world outside.\"\n\nLeslie seemed always to enjoy those lighthouse carousals very much, and\nbloomed out for the time being into ready wit and beautiful laughter,\nor glowing-eyed silence.  There was a certain tang and savor in the\nconversation when Leslie was present which they missed when she was\nabsent.  Even when she did not talk she seemed to inspire others to\nbrilliancy.  Captain Jim told his stories better, Gilbert was quicker\nin argument and repartee, Anne felt little gushes and trickles of fancy\nand imagination bubbling to her lips under the influence of Leslie's\npersonality.\n\n\"That girl was born to be a leader in social and intellectual circles,\nfar away from Four Winds,\" she said to Gilbert as they walked home one\nnight.  \"She's just wasted here--wasted.\"\n\n\"Weren't you listening to Captain Jim and yours truly the other night\nwhen we discussed that subject generally?  We came to the comforting\nconclusion that the Creator probably knew how to run His universe quite\nas well as we do, and that, after all, there are no such things as\n'wasted' lives, saving and except when an individual wilfully squanders\nand wastes his own life--which Leslie Moore certainly hasn't done.  And\nsome people might think that a Redmond B.A., whom editors were\nbeginning to honor, was 'wasted' as the wife of a struggling country\ndoctor in the rural community of Four Winds.\"\n\n\"Gilbert!\"\n\n\"If you had married Roy Gardner, now,\" continued Gilbert mercilessly,\n\"YOU could have been 'a leader in social and intellectual circles far\naway from Four Winds.'\"\n\n\"Gilbert BLYTHE!\"\n\n\"You KNOW you were in love with him at one time, Anne.\"\n\n\"Gilbert, that's mean--'pisen mean, just like all the men,' as Miss\nCornelia says.  I NEVER was in love with him.  I only imagined I was.\nYOU know that.  You KNOW I'd rather be your wife in our house of dreams\nand fulfillment than a queen in a palace.\"\n\nGilbert's answer was not in words; but I am afraid that both of them\nforgot poor Leslie speeding her lonely way across the fields to a house\nthat was neither a palace nor the fulfillment of a dream.\n\nThe moon was rising over the sad, dark sea behind them and\ntransfiguring it.  Her light had not yet reached the harbor, the\nfurther side of which was shadowy and suggestive, with dim coves and\nrich glooms and jewelling lights.\n\n\"How the home lights shine out tonight through the dark!\" said Anne.\n\"That string of them over the harbor looks like a necklace.  And what a\ncoruscation there is up at the Glen!  Oh, look, Gilbert; there is ours.\nI'm so glad we left it burning.  I hate to come home to a dark house.\nOUR homelight, Gilbert!  Isn't it lovely to see?\"\n\n\"Just one of earth's many millions of homes, Anne--girl--but\nours--OURS--our beacon in 'a naughty world.'  When a fellow has a home\nand a dear, little, red-haired wife in it what more need he ask of\nlife?\"\n\n\"Well, he might ask ONE thing more,\" whispered Anne happily.  \"Oh,\nGilbert, it seems as if I just COULDN'T wait for the spring.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\nCHRISTMAS AT FOUR WINDS\n\nAt first Anne and Gilbert talked of going home to Avonlea for\nChristmas; but eventually they decided to stay in Four Winds.  \"I want\nto spend the first Christmas of our life together in our own home,\"\ndecreed Anne.\n\nSo it fell out that Marilla and Mrs. Rachel Lynde and the twins came to\nFour Winds for Christmas.  Marilla had the face of a woman who had\ncircumnavigated the globe.  She had never been sixty miles away from\nhome before; and she had never eaten a Christmas dinner anywhere save\nat Green Gables.\n\nMrs. Rachel had made and brought with her an enormous plum pudding.\nNothing could have convinced Mrs. Rachel that a college graduate of the\nyounger generation could make a Christmas plum pudding properly; but\nshe bestowed approval on Anne's house.\n\n\"Anne's a good housekeeper,\" she said to Marilla in the spare room the\nnight of their arrival.  \"I've looked into her bread box and her scrap\npail.  I always judge a housekeeper by those, that's what.  There's\nnothing in the pail that shouldn't have been thrown away, and no stale\npieces in the bread box.  Of course, she was trained up with you--but,\nthen, she went to college afterwards.  I notice she's got my tobacco\nstripe quilt on the bed here, and that big round braided mat of yours\nbefore her living-room fire.  It makes me feel right at home.\"\n\nAnne's first Christmas in her own house was as delightful as she could\nhave wished.  The day was fine and bright; the first skim of snow had\nfallen on Christmas Eve and made the world beautiful; the harbor was\nstill open and glittering.\n\nCaptain Jim and Miss Cornelia came to dinner.  Leslie and Dick had been\ninvited, but Leslie made excuse; they always went to her Uncle Isaac\nWest's for Christmas, she said.\n\n\"She'd rather have it so,\" Miss Cornelia told Anne.  \"She can't bear\ntaking Dick where there are strangers.  Christmas is always a hard time\nfor Leslie.  She and her father used to make a lot of it.\"\n\nMiss Cornelia and Mrs. Rachel did not take a very violent fancy to each\nother.  \"Two suns hold not their courses in one sphere.\"  But they did\nnot clash at all, for Mrs. Rachel was in the kitchen helping Anne and\nMarilla with the dinner, and it fell to Gilbert to entertain Captain\nJim and Miss Cornelia,--or rather to be entertained by them, for a\ndialogue between those two old friends and antagonists was assuredly\nnever dull.\n\n\"It's many a year since there was a Christmas dinner here, Mistress\nBlythe,\" said Captain Jim.  \"Miss Russell always went to her friends in\ntown for Christmas.  But I was here to the first Christmas dinner that\nwas ever eaten in this house--and the schoolmaster's bride cooked it.\nThat was sixty years ago today, Mistress Blythe--and a day very like\nthis--just enough snow to make the hills white, and the harbor as blue\nas June.  I was only a lad, and I'd never been invited out to dinner\nbefore, and I was too shy to eat enough.  I've got all over THAT.\"\n\n\"Most men do,\" said Miss Cornelia, sewing furiously.  Miss Cornelia was\nnot going to sit with idle hands, even on Christmas.\n\nBabies come without any consideration for holidays, and there was one\nexpected in a poverty-stricken household at Glen St. Mary.  Miss\nCornelia had sent that household a substantial dinner for its little\nswarm, and so meant to eat her own with a comfortable conscience.\n\n\"Well, you know, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach,\nCornelia,\" explained Captain Jim.\n\n\"I believe you--when he HAS a heart,\" retorted Miss Cornelia.  \"I\nsuppose that's why so many women kill themselves cooking--just as poor\nAmelia Baxter did.  She died last Christmas morning, and she said it\nwas the first Christmas since she was married that she didn't have to\ncook a big, twenty-plate dinner.  It must have been a real pleasant\nchange for her.  Well, she's been dead a year, so you'll soon hear of\nHorace Baxter taking notice.\"\n\n\"I heard he was taking notice already,\" said Captain Jim, winking at\nGilbert.  \"Wasn't he up to your place one Sunday lately, with his\nfuneral blacks on, and a boiled collar?\"\n\n\"No, he wasn't.  And he needn't come neither.  I could have had him\nlong ago when he was fresh.  I don't want any second-hand goods,\nbelieve ME.  As for Horace Baxter, he was in financial difficulties a\nyear ago last summer, and he prayed to the Lord for help; and when his\nwife died and he got her life insurance he said he believed it was the\nanswer to his prayer.  Wasn't that like a man?\"\n\n\"Have you really proof that he said that, Cornelia?\"\n\n\"I have the Methodist minister's word for it--if you call THAT proof.\nRobert Baxter told me the same thing too, but I admit THAT isn't\nevidence.  Robert Baxter isn't often known to tell the truth.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Cornelia, I think he generally tells the truth, but he\nchanges his opinion so often it sometimes sounds as if he didn't.\"\n\n\"It sounds like it mighty often, believe ME.  But trust one man to\nexcuse another.  I have no use for Robert Baxter.  He turned Methodist\njust because the Presbyterian choir happened to be singing 'Behold the\nbridegroom cometh' for a collection piece when him and Margaret walked\nup the aisle the Sunday after they were married.  Served him right for\nbeing late!  He always insisted the choir did it on purpose to insult\nhim, as if he was of that much importance.  But that family always\nthought they were much bigger potatoes than they really were.  His\nbrother Eliphalet imagined the devil was always at his elbow--but _I_\nnever believed the devil wasted that much time on him.\"\n\n\"I--don't--know,\" said Captain Jim thoughtfully.  \"Eliphalet Baxter\nlived too much alone--hadn't even a cat or dog to keep him human.  When\na man is alone he's mighty apt to be with the devil--if he ain't with\nGod.  He has to choose which company he'll keep, I reckon.  If the\ndevil always was at Life Baxter's elbow it must have been because Life\nliked to have him there.\"\n\n\"Man-like,\" said Miss Cornelia, and subsided into silence over a\ncomplicated arrangement of tucks until Captain Jim deliberately stirred\nher up again by remarking in a casual way:\n\n\"I was up to the Methodist church last Sunday morning.\"\n\n\"You'd better have been home reading your Bible,\" was Miss Cornelia's\nretort.\n\n\"Come, now, Cornelia, _I_ can't see any harm in going to the Methodist\nchurch when there's no preaching in your own.  I've been a Presbyterian\nfor seventy-six years, and it isn't likely my theology will hoist\nanchor at this late day.\"\n\n\"It's setting a bad example,\" said Miss Cornelia grimly.\n\n\"Besides,\" continued wicked Captain Jim, \"I wanted to hear some good\nsinging.  The Methodists have a good choir; and you can't deny,\nCornelia, that the singing in our church is awful since the split in\nthe choir.\"\n\n\"What if the singing isn't good?  They're doing their best, and God\nsees no difference between the voice of a crow and the voice of a\nnightingale.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Cornelia,\" said Captain Jim mildly, \"I've a better opinion\nof the Almighty's ear for music than THAT.\"\n\n\"What caused the trouble in our choir?\" asked Gilbert, who was\nsuffering from suppressed laughter.\n\n\"It dates back to the new church, three years ago,\" answered Captain\nJim.  \"We had a fearful time over the building of that church--fell out\nover the question of a new site.  The two sites wasn't more'n two\nhundred yards apart, but you'd have thought they was a thousand by the\nbitterness of that fight.  We was split up into three factions--one\nwanted the east site and one the south, and one held to the old.  It\nwas fought out in bed and at board, and in church and at market.  All\nthe old scandals of three generations were dragged out of their graves\nand aired.  Three matches was broken up by it.  And the meetings we had\nto try to settle the question!  Cornelia, will you ever forget the one\nwhen old Luther Burns got up and made a speech?  HE stated his opinions\nforcibly.\"\n\n\"Call a spade a spade, Captain.  You mean he got red-mad and raked them\nall, fore and aft.  They deserved it too--a pack of incapables.  But\nwhat would you expect of a committee of men?  That building committee\nheld twenty-seven meetings, and at the end of the twenty-seventh\nweren't no nearer having a church than when they begun--not so near,\nfor a fact, for in one fit of hurrying things along they'd gone to work\nand tore the old church down, so there we were, without a church, and\nno place but the hall to worship in.\"\n\n\"The Methodists offered us their church, Cornelia.\"\n\n\"The Glen St. Mary church wouldn't have been built to this day,\" went\non Miss Cornelia, ignoring Captain Jim, \"if we women hadn't just\nstarted in and took charge.  We said WE meant to have a church, if the\nmen meant to quarrel till doomsday, and we were tired of being a\nlaughing-stock for the Methodists.  We held ONE meeting and elected a\ncommittee and canvassed for subscriptions.  We got them, too.  When any\nof the men tried to sass us we told them they'd tried for two years to\nbuild a church and it was our turn now.  We shut them up close, believe\nME, and in six months we had our church.  Of course, when the men saw\nwe were determined they stopped fighting and went to work, man-like, as\nsoon as they saw they had to, or quit bossing.  Oh, women can't preach\nor be elders; but they can build churches and scare up the money for\nthem.\"\n\n\"The Methodists allow women to preach,\" said Captain Jim.\n\nMiss Cornelia glared at him.\n\n\"I never said the Methodists hadn't common sense, Captain. What I say\nis, I doubt if they have much religion.\"\n\n\"I suppose you are in favor of votes for women, Miss Cornelia,\" said\nGilbert.\n\n\"I'm not hankering after the vote, believe ME,\" said Miss Cornelia\nscornfully.  \"_I_ know what it is to clean up after the men.  But some\nof these days, when the men realize they've got the world into a mess\nthey can't get it out of, they'll be glad to give us the vote, and\nshoulder their troubles over on us.  That's THEIR scheme.  Oh, it's\nwell that women are patient, believe ME!\"\n\n\"What about Job?\" suggested Captain Jim.\n\n\"Job!  It was such a rare thing to find a patient man that when one was\nreally discovered they were determined he shouldn't be forgotten,\"\nretorted Miss Cornelia triumphantly.  \"Anyhow, the virtue doesn't go\nwith the name.  There never was such an impatient man born as old Job\nTaylor over harbor.\"\n\n\"Well, you know, he had a good deal to try him, Cornelia.  Even you\ncan't defend his wife.  I always remember what old William MacAllister\nsaid of her at her funeral, 'There's nae doot she was a Chreestian\nwumman, but she had the de'il's own temper.'\"\n\n\"I suppose she WAS trying,\" admitted Miss Cornelia reluctantly, \"but\nthat didn't justify what Job said when she died.  He rode home from the\ngraveyard the day of the funeral with my father.  He never said a word\ntill they got near home.  Then he heaved a big sigh and said, 'You may\nnot believe it, Stephen, but this is the happiest day of my life!'\nWasn't that like a man?\"\n\n\"I s'pose poor old Mrs. Job did make life kinder uneasy for him,\"\nreflected Captain Jim.\n\n\"Well, there's such a thing as decency, isn't there?  Even if a man is\nrejoicing in his heart over his wife being dead, he needn't proclaim it\nto the four winds of heaven.  And happy day or not, Job Taylor wasn't\nlong in marrying again, you might notice.  His second wife could manage\nhim.  She made him walk Spanish, believe me!  The first thing she did\nwas to make him hustle round and put up a tombstone to the first Mrs.\nJob--and she had a place left on it for her own name.  She said there'd\nbe nobody to make Job put up a monument to HER.\"\n\n\"Speaking of Taylors, how is Mrs. Lewis Taylor up at the Glen, doctor?\"\nasked Captain Jim.\n\n\"She's getting better slowly--but she has to work too hard,\" replied\nGilbert.\n\n\"Her husband works hard too--raising prize pigs,\" said Miss Cornelia.\n\"He's noted for his beautiful pigs.  He's a heap prouder of his pigs\nthan of his children.  But then, to be sure, his pigs are the best pigs\npossible, while his children don't amount to much.  He picked a poor\nmother for them, and starved her while she was bearing and rearing\nthem.  His pigs got the cream and his children got the skim milk.\n\n\"There are times, Cornelia, when I have to agree with you, though it\nhurts me,\" said Captain Jim.  \"That's just exactly the truth about\nLewis Taylor.  When I see those poor, miserable children of his, robbed\nof all children ought to have, it p'isens my own bite and sup for days\nafterwards.\"\n\nGilbert went out to the kitchen in response to Anne's beckoning.  Anne\nshut the door and gave him a connubial lecture.\n\n\"Gilbert, you and Captain Jim must stop baiting Miss Cornelia.  Oh,\nI've been listening to you--and I just won't allow it.\"\n\n'Anne, Miss Cornelia is enjoying herself hugely.  You know she is.'\n\n\"Well, never mind.  You two needn't egg her on like that.  Dinner is\nready now, and, Gilbert, DON'T let Mrs. Rachel carve the geese.  I know\nshe means to offer to do it because she doesn't think you can do it\nproperly.  Show her you can.\"\n\n\"I ought to be able to.  I've been studying A-B-C-D diagrams of carving\nfor the past month,\" said Gilbert.  \"Only don't talk to me while I'm\ndoing it, Anne, for if you drive the letters out of my head I'll be in\na worse predicament than you were in old geometry days when the teacher\nchanged them.\"\n\nGilbert carved the geese beautifully.  Even Mrs. Rachel had to admit\nthat.  And everybody ate of them and enjoyed them.  Anne's first\nChristmas dinner was a great success and she beamed with housewifely\npride.  Merry was the feast and long; and when it was over they\ngathered around the cheer of the red hearth flame and Captain Jim told\nthem stories until the red sun swung low over Four Winds Harbor, and\nthe long blue shadows of the Lombardies fell across the snow in the\nlane.\n\n\"I must be getting back to the light,\" he said finally.  \"I'll jest\nhave time to walk home before sundown.  Thank you for a beautiful\nChristmas, Mistress Blythe.  Bring Master Davy down to the light some\nnight before he goes home.\n\n\"I want to see those stone gods,\" said Davy with a relish.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\nNEW YEAR'S EVE AT THE LIGHT\n\nThe Green Gables folk went home after Christmas, Marilla under solemn\ncovenant to return for a month in the spring.  More snow came before\nNew Year's, and the harbor froze over, but the gulf still was free,\nbeyond the white, imprisoned fields.  The last day of the old year was\none of those bright, cold, dazzling winter days, which bombard us with\ntheir brilliancy, and command our admiration but never our love.  The\nsky was sharp and blue; the snow diamonds sparkled insistently; the\nstark trees were bare and shameless, with a kind of brazen beauty; the\nhills shot assaulting lances of crystal.  Even the shadows were sharp\nand stiff and clear-cut, as no proper shadows should be.  Everything\nthat was handsome seemed ten times handsomer and less attractive in the\nglaring splendor; and everything that was ugly seemed ten times uglier,\nand everything was either handsome or ugly.  There was no soft\nblending, or kind obscurity, or elusive mistiness in that searching\nglitter.  The only things that held their own individuality were the\nfirs--for the fir is the tree of mystery and shadow, and yields never\nto the encroachments of crude radiance.\n\nBut finally the day began to realise that she was growing old.  Then a\ncertain pensiveness fell over her beauty which dimmed yet intensified\nit; sharp angles, glittering points, melted away into curves and\nenticing gleams.  The white harbor put on soft grays and pinks; the\nfar-away hills turned amethyst.\n\n\"The old year is going away beautifully,\" said Anne.\n\nShe and Leslie and Gilbert were on their way to the Four Winds Point,\nhaving plotted with Captain Jim to watch the New Year in at the light.\nThe sun had set and in the southwestern sky hung Venus, glorious and\ngolden, having drawn as near to her earth-sister as is possible for\nher.  For the first time Anne and Gilbert saw the shadow cast by that\nbrilliant star of evening, that faint, mysterious shadow, never seen\nsave when there is white snow to reveal it, and then only with averted\nvision, vanishing when you gaze at it directly.\n\n\"It's like the spirit of a shadow, isn't it?\" whispered Anne.  \"You can\nsee it so plainly haunting your side when you look ahead; but when you\nturn and look at it--it's gone.\"\n\n\"I have heard that you can see the shadow of Venus only once in a\nlifetime, and that within a year of seeing it your life's most\nwonderful gift will come to you,\" said Leslie.  But she spoke rather\nhardly; perhaps she thought that even the shadow of Venus could bring\nher no gift of life.  Anne smiled in the soft twilight; she felt quite\nsure what the mystic shadow promised her.\n\nThey found Marshall Elliott at the lighthouse.  At first Anne felt\ninclined to resent the intrusion of this long-haired, long-bearded\neccentric into the familiar little circle.  But Marshall Elliott soon\nproved his legitimate claim to membership in the household of Joseph.\nHe was a witty, intelligent, well-read man, rivalling Captain Jim\nhimself in the knack of telling a good story.  They were all glad when\nhe agreed to watch the old year out with them.\n\nCaptain Jim's small nephew Joe had come down to spend New Year's with\nhis great-uncle, and had fallen asleep on the sofa with the First Mate\ncurled up in a huge golden ball at his feet.\n\n\"Ain't he a dear little man?\" said Captain Jim gloatingly.  \"I do love\nto watch a little child asleep, Mistress Blythe.  It's the most\nbeautiful sight in the world, I reckon.  Joe does love to get down here\nfor a night, because I have him sleep with me.  At home he has to sleep\nwith the other two boys, and he doesn't like it.  Why can't I sleep\nwith father, Uncle Jim?\" says he.  'Everybody in the Bible slept with\ntheir fathers.'  As for the questions he asks, the minister himself\ncouldn't answer them.  They fair swamp me.  'Uncle Jim, if I wasn't ME\nwho'd I be?' and, 'Uncle Jim, what would happen if God died?'  He fired\nthem two off at me tonight, afore he went to sleep.  As for his\nimagination, it sails away from everything.  He makes up the most\nremarkable yarns--and then his mother shuts him up in the closet for\ntelling stories.  And he sits down and makes up another one, and has it\nready to relate to her when she lets him out.  He had one for me when\nhe come down tonight.  'Uncle Jim,' says he, solemn as a tombstone, 'I\nhad a 'venture in the Glen today.'  'Yes, what was it?' says I,\nexpecting something quite startling, but nowise prepared for what I\nreally got.  'I met a wolf in the street,' says he, 'a 'normous wolf\nwith a big, red mouf and AWFUL long teeth, Uncle Jim.'  'I didn't know\nthere was any wolves up at the Glen,' says I.  'Oh, he comed there from\nfar, far away,' says Joe, 'and I fought he was going to eat me up,\nUncle Jim.'  'Were you scared?' says I.  'No, 'cause I had a big gun,'\nsays Joe, 'and I shot the wolf dead, Uncle Jim,--solid dead--and then\nhe went up to heaven and bit God,' says he.  Well, I was fair\nstaggered, Mistress Blythe.\"\n\nThe hours bloomed into mirth around the driftwood fire.  Captain Jim\ntold tales, and Marshall Elliott sang old Scotch ballads in a fine\ntenor voice; finally Captain Jim took down his old brown fiddle from\nthe wall and began to play.  He had a tolerable knack of fiddling,\nwhich all appreciated save the First Mate, who sprang from the sofa as\nif he had been shot, emitted a shriek of protest, and fled wildly up\nthe stairs.\n\n\"Can't cultivate an ear for music in that cat nohow,\" said Captain Jim.\n\"He won't stay long enough to learn to like it.  When we got the organ\nup at the Glen church old Elder Richards bounced up from his seat the\nminute the organist began to play and scuttled down the aisle and out\nof the church at the rate of no-man's-business.  It reminded me so\nstrong of the First Mate tearing loose as soon as I begin to fiddle\nthat I come nearer to laughing out loud in church than I ever did\nbefore or since.\"\n\nThere was something so infectious in the rollicking tunes which Captain\nJim played that very soon Marshall Elliott's feet began to twitch.  He\nhad been a noted dancer in his youth.  Presently he started up and held\nout his hands to Leslie.  Instantly she responded.  Round and round the\nfirelit room they circled with a rhythmic grace that was wonderful.\nLeslie danced like one inspired; the wild, sweet abandon of the music\nseemed to have entered into and possessed her.  Anne watched her in\nfascinated admiration.  She had never seen her like this.  All the\ninnate richness and color and charm of her nature seemed to have broken\nloose and overflowed in crimson cheek and glowing eye and grace of\nmotion.  Even the aspect of Marshall Elliott, with his long beard and\nhair, could not spoil the picture.  On the contrary, it seemed to\nenhance it.  Marshall Elliott looked like a Viking of elder days,\ndancing with one of the blue-eyed, golden-haired daughters of the\nNorthland.\n\n\"The purtiest dancing I ever saw, and I've seen some in my time,\"\ndeclared Captain Jim, when at last the bow fell from his tired hand.\nLeslie dropped into her chair, laughing, breathless.\n\n\"I love dancing,\" she said apart to Anne.  \"I haven't danced since I\nwas sixteen--but I love it.  The music seems to run through my veins\nlike quicksilver and I forget everything--everything--except the\ndelight of keeping time to it.  There isn't any floor beneath me, or\nwalls about me, or roof over me--I'm floating amid the stars.\"\n\nCaptain Jim hung his fiddle up in its place, beside a large frame\nenclosing several banknotes.\n\n\"Is there anybody else of your acquaintance who can afford to hang his\nwalls with banknotes for pictures?\" he asked.  \"There's twenty\nten-dollar notes there, not worth the glass over them.  They're old\nBank of P. E.  Island notes.  Had them by me when the bank failed, and\nI had 'em framed and hung up, partly as a reminder not to put your\ntrust in banks, and partly to give me a real luxurious, millionairy\nfeeling.  Hullo, Matey, don't be scared.  You can come back now.  The\nmusic and revelry is over for tonight.  The old year has just another\nhour to stay with us.  I've seen seventy-six New Years come in over\nthat gulf yonder, Mistress Blythe.\"\n\n\"You'll see a hundred,\" said Marshall Elliott.\n\nCaptain Jim shook his head.\n\n\"No; and I don't want to--at least, I think I don't.  Death grows\nfriendlier as we grow older.  Not that one of us really wants to die\nthough, Marshall.  Tennyson spoke truth when he said that.  There's old\nMrs. Wallace up at the Glen.  She's had heaps of trouble all her life,\npoor soul, and she's lost almost everyone she cared about.  She's\nalways saying that she'll be glad when her time comes, and she doesn't\nwant to sojourn any longer in this vale of tears.  But when she takes a\nsick spell there's a fuss!  Doctors from town, and a trained nurse, and\nenough medicine to kill a dog.  Life may be a vale of tears, all right,\nbut there are some folks who enjoy weeping, I reckon.\"\n\nThey spent the old year's last hour quietly around the fire.  A few\nminutes before twelve Captain Jim rose and opened the door.\n\n\"We must let the New Year in,\" he said.\n\nOutside was a fine blue night.  A sparkling ribbon of moonlight\ngarlanded the gulf.  Inside the bar the harbor shone like a pavement of\npearl.  They stood before the door and waited--Captain Jim with his\nripe, full experience, Marshall Elliott in his vigorous but empty\nmiddle life, Gilbert and Anne with their precious memories and\nexquisite hopes, Leslie with her record of starved years and her\nhopeless future.  The clock on the little shelf above the fireplace\nstruck twelve.\n\n\"Welcome, New Year,\" said Captain Jim, bowing low as the last stroke\ndied away.  \"I wish you all the best year of your lives, mates.  I\nreckon that whatever the New Year brings us will be the best the Great\nCaptain has for us--and somehow or other we'll all make port in a good\nharbor.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\nA FOUR WINDS WINTER\n\nWinter set in vigorously after New Year's.  Big, white drifts heaped\nthemselves about the little house, and palms of frost covered its\nwindows.  The harbor ice grew harder and thicker, until the Four Winds\npeople began their usual winter travelling over it.  The safe ways were\n\"bushed\" by a benevolent Government, and night and day the gay tinkle\nof the sleigh-bells sounded on it.  On moonlit nights Anne heard them\nin her house of dreams like fairy chimes.  The gulf froze over, and the\nFour Winds light flashed no more.  During the months when navigation\nwas closed Captain Jim's office was a sinecure.\n\n\"The First Mate and I will have nothing to do till spring except keep\nwarm and amuse ourselves.  The last lighthouse keeper used always to\nmove up to the Glen in winter; but I'd rather stay at the Point.  The\nFirst Mate might get poisoned or chewed up by dogs at the Glen.  It's a\nmite lonely, to be sure, with neither the light nor the water for\ncompany, but if our friends come to see us often we'll weather it\nthrough.\"\n\nCaptain Jim had an ice boat, and many a wild, glorious spin Gilbert and\nAnne and Leslie had over the glib harbor ice with him.  Anne and Leslie\ntook long snowshoe tramps together, too, over the fields, or across the\nharbor after storms, or through the woods beyond the Glen.  They were\nvery good comrades in their rambles and their fireside communings.\nEach had something to give the other--each felt life the richer for\nfriendly exchange of thought and friendly silence; each looked across\nthe white fields between their homes with a pleasant consciousness of a\nfriend beyond.  But, in spite of all this, Anne felt that there was\nalways a barrier between Leslie and herself--a constraint that never\nwholly vanished.\n\n\"I don't know why I can't get closer to her,\" Anne said one evening to\nCaptain Jim.  \"I like her so much--I admire her so much--I WANT to take\nher right into my heart and creep right into hers.  But I can never\ncross the barrier.\"\n\n\"You've been too happy all your life, Mistress Blythe,\" said Captain\nJim thoughtfully.  \"I reckon that's why you and Leslie can't get real\nclose together in your souls.  The barrier between you is her\nexperience of sorrow and trouble.  She ain't responsible for it and you\nain't; but it's there and neither of you can cross it.\"\n\n\"My childhood wasn't very happy before I came to Green Gables,\" said\nAnne, gazing soberly out of the window at the still, sad, dead beauty\nof the leafless tree-shadows on the moonlit snow.\n\n\"Mebbe not--but it was just the usual unhappiness of a child who hasn't\nanyone to look after it properly.  There hasn't been any TRAGEDY in\nyour life, Mistress Blythe.  And poor Leslie's has been almost ALL\ntragedy.  She feels, I reckon, though mebbe she hardly knows she feels\nit, that there's a vast deal in her life you can't enter nor\nunderstand--and so she has to keep you back from it--hold you off, so\nto speak, from hurting her.  You know if we've got anything about us\nthat hurts we shrink from anyone's touch on or near it.  It holds good\nwith our souls as well as our bodies, I reckon.  Leslie's soul must be\nnear raw--it's no wonder she hides it away.\"\n\n\"If that were really all, I wouldn't mind, Captain Jim.  I would\nunderstand.  But there are times--not always, but now and again--when I\nalmost have to believe that Leslie doesn't--doesn't like me.  Sometimes\nI surprise a look in her eyes that seems to show resentment and\ndislike--it goes so quickly--but I've seen it, I'm sure of that.  And\nit hurts me, Captain Jim.  I'm not used to being disliked--and I've\ntried so hard to win Leslie's friendship.\"\n\n\"You have won it, Mistress Blythe.  Don't you go cherishing any foolish\nnotion that Leslie don't like you.  If she didn't she wouldn't have\nanything to do with you, much less chumming with you as she does.  I\nknow Leslie Moore too well not to be sure of that.\"\n\n\"The first time I ever saw her, driving her geese down the hill on the\nday I came to Four Winds, she looked at me with the same expression,\"\npersisted Anne.  \"I felt it, even in the midst of my admiration of her\nbeauty.  She looked at me resentfully--she did, indeed, Captain Jim.\"\n\n\"The resentment must have been about something else, Mistress Blythe,\nand you jest come in for a share of it because you happened past.\nLeslie DOES take sullen spells now and again, poor girl.  I can't blame\nher, when I know what she has to put up with.  I don't know why it's\npermitted.  The doctor and I have talked a lot abut the origin of evil,\nbut we haven't quite found out all about it yet.  There's a vast of\nonunderstandable things in life, ain't there, Mistress Blythe?\nSometimes things seem to work out real proper-like, same as with you\nand the doctor.  And then again they all seem to go catawampus.\nThere's Leslie, so clever and beautiful you'd think she was meant for a\nqueen, and instead she's cooped up over there, robbed of almost\neverything a woman'd value, with no prospect except waiting on Dick\nMoore all her life.  Though, mind you, Mistress Blythe, I daresay she'd\nchoose her life now, such as it is, rather than the life she lived with\nDick before he went away.  THAT'S something a clumsy old sailor's\ntongue mustn't meddle with.  But you've helped Leslie a lot--she's a\ndifferent creature since you come to Four Winds.  Us old friends see\nthe difference in her, as you can't.  Miss Cornelia and me was talking\nit over the other day, and it's one of the mighty few p'ints that we\nsee eye to eye on.  So jest you throw overboard any idea of her not\nliking you.\"\n\nAnne could hardly discard it completely, for there were undoubtedly\ntimes when she felt, with an instinct that was not to be combated by\nreason, that Leslie harbored a queer, indefinable resentment towards\nher.  At times, this secret consciousness marred the delight of their\ncomradeship; at others it was almost forgotten; but Anne always felt\nthe hidden thorn was there, and might prick her at any moment.  She\nfelt a cruel sting from it on the day when she told Leslie of what she\nhoped the spring would bring to the little house of dreams.  Leslie\nlooked at her with hard, bitter, unfriendly eyes.\n\n\"So you are to have THAT, too,\" she said in a choked voice.  And\nwithout another word she had turned and gone across the fields\nhomeward.  Anne was deeply hurt; for the moment she felt as if she\ncould never like Leslie again.  But when Leslie came over a few\nevenings later she was so pleasant, so friendly, so frank, and witty,\nand winsome, that Anne was charmed into forgiveness and forgetfulness.\nOnly, she never mentioned her darling hope to Leslie again; nor did\nLeslie ever refer to it.  But one evening, when late winter was\nlistening for the word of spring, she came over to the little house for\na twilight chat; and when she went away she left a small, white box on\nthe table.  Anne found it after she was gone and opened it wonderingly.\nIn it was a tiny white dress of exquisite workmanship--delicate\nembroidery, wonderful tucking, sheer loveliness.  Every stitch in it\nwas handwork; and the little frills of lace at neck and sleeves were of\nreal Valenciennes.  Lying on it was a card--\"with Leslie's love.\"\n\n\"What hours of work she must have put on it,\" said Anne.  \"And the\nmaterial must have cost more than she could really afford.  It is very\nsweet of her.\"\n\nBut Leslie was brusque and curt when Anne thanked her, and again the\nlatter felt thrown back upon herself.\n\nLeslie's gift was not alone in the little house.  Miss Cornelia had,\nfor the time being, given up sewing for unwanted, unwelcome eighth\nbabies, and fallen to sewing for a very much wanted first one, whose\nwelcome would leave nothing to be desired.  Philippa Blake and Diana\nWright each sent a marvellous garment; and Mrs. Rachel Lynde sent\nseveral, in which good material and honest stitches took the place of\nembroidery and frills.  Anne herself made many, desecrated by no touch\nof machinery, spending over them the happiest hours of the happy winter.\n\nCaptain Jim was the most frequent guest of the little house, and none\nwas more welcome.  Every day Anne loved the simple-souled, true-hearted\nold sailor more and more.  He was as refreshing as a sea breeze, as\ninteresting as some ancient chronicle.  She was never tired of\nlistening to his stories, and his quaint remarks and comments were a\ncontinual delight to her.  Captain Jim was one of those rare and\ninteresting people who \"never speak but they say something.\"  The milk\nof human kindness and the wisdom of the serpent were mingled in his\ncomposition in delightful proportions.\n\nNothing ever seemed to put Captain Jim out or depress him in any way.\n\n\"I've kind of contracted a habit of enj'ying things,\" he remarked once,\nwhen Anne had commented on his invariable cheerfulness.  \"It's got so\nchronic that I believe I even enj'y the disagreeable things.  It's\ngreat fun thinking they can't last.  'Old rheumatiz,' says I, when it\ngrips me hard, 'you've GOT to stop aching sometime.  The worse you are\nthe sooner you'll stop, mebbe.  I'm bound to get the better of you in\nthe long run, whether in the body or out of the body.'\"\n\nOne night, by the fireside at the light Anne saw Captain Jim's\n\"life-book.\"  He needed no coaxing to show it and proudly gave it to\nher to read.\n\n\"I writ it to leave to little Joe,\" he said.  \"I don't like the idea of\neverything I've done and seen being clean forgot after I've shipped for\nmy last v'yage.  Joe, he'll remember it, and tell the yarns to his\nchildren.\"\n\nIt was an old leather-bound book filled with the record of his voyages\nand adventures.  Anne thought what a treasure trove it would be to a\nwriter.  Every sentence was a nugget.  In itself the book had no\nliterary merit; Captain Jim's charm of storytelling failed him when he\ncame to pen and ink; he could only jot roughly down the outline of his\nfamous tales, and both spelling and grammar were sadly askew.  But Anne\nfelt that if anyone possessed of the gift could take that simple record\nof a brave, adventurous life, reading between the bald lines the tales\nof dangers staunchly faced and duty manfully done, a wonderful story\nmight be made from it.  Rich comedy and thrilling tragedy were both\nlying hidden in Captain Jim's \"life-book,\" waiting for the touch of the\nmaster hand to waken the laughter and grief and horror of thousands.\n\nAnne said something of this to Gilbert as they walked home.\n\n\"Why don't you try your hand at it yourself, Anne?\"\n\nAnne shook her head.\n\n\"No.  I only wish I could.  But it's not in the power of my gift.  You\nknow what my forte is, Gilbert--the fanciful, the fairylike, the\npretty.  To write Captain Jim's life-book as it should be written one\nshould be a master of vigorous yet subtle style, a keen psychologist, a\nborn humorist and a born tragedian.  A rare combination of gifts is\nneeded.  Paul might do it if he were older.  Anyhow, I'm going to ask\nhim to come down next summer and meet Captain Jim.\"\n\n\"Come to this shore,\" wrote Anne to Paul.  \"I am afraid you cannot find\nhere Nora or the Golden Lady or the Twin Sailors; but you will find one\nold sailor who can tell you wonderful stories.\"\n\nPaul, however wrote back, saying regretfully that he could not come\nthat year.  He was going abroad for two year's study.\n\n\"When I return I'll come to Four Winds, dear Teacher,\" he wrote.\n\n\"But meanwhile, Captain Jim is growing old,\" said Anne, sorrowfully,\n\"and there is nobody to write his life-book.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\nSPRING DAYS\n\nThe ice in the harbor grew black and rotten in the March suns; in April\nthere were blue waters and a windy, white-capped gulf again; and again\nthe Four Winds light begemmed the twilights.\n\n\"I'm so glad to see it once more,\" said Anne, on the first evening of\nits reappearance.  \"I've missed it so all winter.  The northwestern sky\nhas seemed blank and lonely without it.\"\n\nThe land was tender with brand-new, golden-green, baby leaves.  There\nwas an emerald mist on the woods beyond the Glen.  The seaward valleys\nwere full of fairy mists at dawn.\n\nVibrant winds came and went with salt foam in their breath.  The sea\nlaughed and flashed and preened and allured, like a beautiful,\ncoquettish woman.  The herring schooled and the fishing village woke to\nlife.  The harbor was alive with white sails making for the channel.\nThe ships began to sail outward and inward again.\n\n\"On a spring day like this,\" said Anne, \"I know exactly what my soul\nwill feel like on the resurrection morning.\"\n\n\"There are times in spring when I sorter feel that I might have been a\npoet if I'd been caught young,\" remarked Captain Jim.  \"I catch myself\nconning over old lines and verses I heard the schoolmaster reciting\nsixty years ago.  They don't trouble me at other times.  Now I feel as\nif I had to get out on the rocks or the fields or the water and spout\nthem.\"\n\nCaptain Jim had come up that afternoon to bring Anne a load of shells\nfor her garden, and a little bunch of sweet-grass which he had found in\na ramble over the sand dunes.\n\n\"It's getting real scarce along this shore now,\" he said.  \"When I was\na boy there was a-plenty of it.  But now it's only once in a while\nyou'll find a plot--and never when you're looking for it.  You jest\nhave to stumble on it--you're walking along on the sand hills, never\nthinking of sweet-grass--and all at once the air is full of\nsweetness--and there's the grass under your feet.  I favor the smell of\nsweet-grass.  It always makes me think of my mother.\"\n\n\"She was fond of it?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"Not that I knows on.  Dunno's she ever saw any sweet-grass.  No, it's\nbecause it has a kind of motherly perfume--not too young, you\nunderstand--something kind of seasoned and wholesome and\ndependable--jest like a mother.  The schoolmaster's bride always kept\nit among her handkerchiefs.  You might put that little bunch among\nyours, Mistress Blythe.  I don't like these boughten scents--but a\nwhiff of sweet-grass belongs anywhere a lady does.\"\n\nAnne had not been especially enthusiastic over the idea of surrounding\nher flower beds with quahog shells; as a decoration they did not appeal\nto her on first thought.  But she would not have hurt Captain Jim's\nfeelings for anything; so she assumed a virtue she did not at first\nfeel, and thanked him heartily.  And when Captain Jim had proudly\nencircled every bed with a rim of the big, milk-white shells, Anne\nfound to her surprise that she liked the effect.  On a town lawn, or\neven up at the Glen, they would not have been in keeping, but here, in\nthe old-fashioned, sea-bound garden of the little house of dreams, they\nBELONGED.\n\n\"They DO look nice,\" she said sincerely.\n\n\"The schoolmaster's bride always had cowhawks round her beds,\" said\nCaptain Jim.  \"She was a master hand with flowers.  She LOOKED at\n'em--and touched 'em--SO--and they grew like mad.  Some folks have that\nknack--I reckon you have it, too, Mistress Blythe.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know--but I love my garden, and I love working in it.  To\npotter with green, growing things, watching each day to see the dear,\nnew sprouts come up, is like taking a hand in creation, I think.  Just\nnow my garden is like faith--the substance of things hoped for.  But\nbide a wee.\"\n\n\"It always amazes me to look at the little, wrinkled brown seeds and\nthink of the rainbows in 'em,\" said Captain Jim.  \"When I ponder on\nthem seeds I don't find it nowise hard to believe that we've got souls\nthat'll live in other worlds.  You couldn't hardly believe there was\nlife in them tiny things, some no bigger than grains of dust, let alone\ncolor and scent, if you hadn't seen the miracle, could you?\"\n\nAnne, who was counting her days like silver beads on a rosary, could\nnot now take the long walk to the lighthouse or up the Glen road.  But\nMiss Cornelia and Captain Jim came very often to the little house.\nMiss Cornelia was the joy of Anne's and Gilbert's existence.  They\nlaughed side-splittingly over her speeches after every visit.  When\nCaptain Jim and she happened to visit the little house at the same time\nthere was much sport for the listening.  They waged wordy warfare, she\nattacking, he defending.  Anne once reproached the Captain for his\nbaiting of Miss Cornelia.\n\n\"Oh, I do love to set her going, Mistress Blythe,\" chuckled the\nunrepentant sinner.  \"It's the greatest amusement I have in life.  That\ntongue of hers would blister a stone.  And you and that young dog of a\ndoctor enj'y listening to her as much as I do.\"\n\nCaptain Jim came along another evening to bring Anne some mayflowers.\nThe garden was full of the moist, scented air of a maritime spring\nevening.  There was a milk-white mist on the edge of the sea, with a\nyoung moon kissing it, and a silver gladness of stars over the Glen.\nThe bell of the church across the harbor was ringing dreamily sweet.\nThe mellow chime drifted through the dusk to mingle with the soft\nspring-moan of the sea.  Captain Jim's mayflowers added the last\ncompleting touch to the charm of the night.\n\n\"I haven't seen any this spring, and I've missed them,\" said Anne,\nburying her face in them.\n\n\"They ain't to be found around Four Winds, only in the barrens away\nbehind the Glen up yander.  I took a little trip today to the\nLand-of-nothing-to-do, and hunted these up for you.  I reckon they're\nthe last you'll see this spring, for they're nearly done.\"\n\n\"How kind and thoughtful you are, Captain Jim.  Nobody else--not even\nGilbert\"--with a shake of her head at him--\"remembered that I always\nlong for mayflowers in spring.\"\n\n\"Well, I had another errand, too--I wanted to take Mr. Howard back\nyander a mess of trout.  He likes one occasional, and it's all I can do\nfor a kindness he did me once.  I stayed all the afternoon and talked\nto him.  He likes to talk to me, though he's a highly eddicated man and\nI'm only an ignorant old sailor, because he's one of the folks that's\nGOT to talk or they're miserable, and he finds listeners scarce around\nhere.  The Glen folks fight shy of him because they think he's an\ninfidel.  He ain't that far gone exactly--few men is, I reckon--but\nhe's what you might call a heretic.  Heretics are wicked, but they're\nmighty int'resting.  It's jest that they've got sorter lost looking for\nGod, being under the impression that He's hard to find--which He ain't\nnever.  Most of 'em blunder to Him after awhile, I guess.  I don't\nthink listening to Mr. Howard's arguments is likely to do me much harm.\nMind you, I believe what I was brought up to believe.  It saves a vast\nof bother--and back of it all, God is good.  The trouble with Mr.\nHoward is that he's a leetle TOO clever.  He thinks that he's bound to\nlive up to his cleverness, and that it's smarter to thrash out some new\nway of getting to heaven than to go by the old track the common,\nignorant folks is travelling.  But he'll get there sometime all right,\nand then he'll laugh at himself.\"\n\n\"Mr. Howard was a Methodist to begin with,\" said Miss Cornelia, as if\nshe thought he had not far to go from that to heresy.\n\n\"Do you know, Cornelia,\" said Captain Jim gravely, \"I've often thought\nthat if I wasn't a Presbyterian I'd be a Methodist.\"\n\n\"Oh, well,\" conceded Miss Cornelia, \"if you weren't a Presbyterian it\nwouldn't matter much what you were.  Speaking of heresy, reminds me,\ndoctor--I've brought back that book you lent me--that Natural Law in\nthe Spiritual World--I didn't read more'n a third of it.  I can read\nsense, and I can read nonsense, but that book is neither the one nor\nthe other.\"\n\n\"It IS considered rather heretical in some quarters,\" admitted Gilbert,\n\"but I told you that before you took it, Miss Cornelia.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't have minded its being heretical.  I can stand\nwickedness, but I can't stand foolishness,\" said Miss Cornelia calmly,\nand with the air of having said the last thing there was to say about\nNatural Law.\n\n\"Speaking of books, A Mad Love come to an end at last two weeks ago,\"\nremarked Captain Jim musingly.  \"It run to one hundred and three\nchapters.  When they got married the book stopped right off, so I\nreckon their troubles were all over.  It's real nice that that's the\nway in books anyhow, isn't it, even if 'tistn't so anywhere else?\"\n\n\"I never read novels,\" said Miss Cornelia.  \"Did you hear how Geordie\nRussell was today, Captain Jim?\"\n\n\"Yes, I called in on my way home to see him.  He's getting round all\nright--but stewing in a broth of trouble, as usual, poor man.\n\n\"'Course he brews up most of it for himself, but I reckon that don't\nmake it any easier to bear.\"\n\n\"He's an awful pessimist,\" said Miss Cornelia.\n\n\"Well, no, he ain't a pessimist exactly, Cornelia.  He only jest never\nfinds anything that suits him.\"\n\n\"And isn't that a pessimist?\"\n\n\"No, no.  A pessimist is one who never expects to find anything to suit\nhim.  Geordie hain't got THAT far yet.\"\n\n\"You'd find something good to say of the devil himself, Jim Boyd.\"\n\n\"Well, you've heard the story of the old lady who said he was\npersevering.  But no, Cornelia, I've nothing good to say of the devil.\"\n\n\"Do you believe in him at all?\" asked Miss Cornelia seriously.\n\n\"How can you ask that when you know what a good Presbyterian I am,\nCornelia?  How could a Presbyterian get along without a devil?\"\n\n\"DO you?\" persisted Miss Cornelia.\n\nCaptain Jim suddenly became grave.\n\n\"I believe in what I heard a minister once call 'a mighty and malignant\nand INTELLIGENT power of evil working in the universe,'\" he said\nsolemnly.  \"I do THAT, Cornelia.  You can call it the devil, or the\n'principle of evil,' or the Old Scratch, or any name you like.  It's\nTHERE, and all the infidels and heretics in the world can't argue it\naway, any more'n they can argue God away.  It's there, and it's\nworking.  But, mind you, Cornelia, I believe it's going to get the\nworst of it in the long run.\"\n\n\"I am sure I hope so,\" said Miss Cornelia, none too hopefully. \"But\nspeaking of the devil, I am positive that Billy Booth is possessed by\nhim now.  Have you heard of Billy's latest performance?\"\n\n\"No, what was that?\"\n\n\"He's gone and burned up his wife's new, brown broadcloth suit, that\nshe paid twenty-five dollars for in Charlottetown, because he declares\nthe men looked too admiring at her when she wore it to church the first\ntime.  Wasn't that like a man?\"\n\n\"Mistress Booth IS mighty pretty, and brown's her color,\" said Captain\nJim reflectively.\n\n\"Is that any good reason why he should poke her new suit into the\nkitchen stove?  Billy Booth is a jealous fool, and he makes his wife's\nlife miserable.  She's cried all the week about her suit.  Oh, Anne, I\nwish I could write like you, believe ME.  Wouldn't I score some of the\nmen round here!\"\n\n\"Those Booths are all a mite queer,\" said Captain Jim.  \"Billy seemed\nthe sanest of the lot till he got married and then this queer jealous\nstreak cropped out in him.  His brother Daniel, now, was always odd.\"\n\n\"Took tantrums every few days or so and wouldn't get out of bed,\" said\nMiss Cornelia with a relish.  \"His wife would have to do all the barn\nwork till he got over his spell.  When he died people wrote her letters\nof condolence; if I'd written anything it would have been one of\ncongratulation.  Their father, old Abram Booth, was a disgusting old\nsot.  He was drunk at his wife's funeral, and kept reeling round and\nhiccuping 'I didn't dri--i--i--nk much but I feel a--a--awfully\nque--e--e--r.'  I gave him a good jab in the back with my umbrella when\nhe came near me, and it sobered him up until they got the casket out of\nthe house.  Young Johnny Booth was to have been married yesterday, but\nhe couldn't be because he's gone and got the mumps.  Wasn't that like a\nman?\"\n\n\"How could he help getting the mumps, poor fellow?\"\n\n\"I'd poor fellow him, believe ME, if I was Kate Sterns.  I don't know\nhow he could help getting the mumps, but I DO know the wedding supper\nwas all prepared and everything will be spoiled before he's well again.\nSuch a waste!  He should have had the mumps when he was a boy.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Cornelia, don't you think you're a mite unreasonable?\"\n\nMiss Cornelia disdained to reply and turned instead to Susan Baker, a\ngrim-faced, kind-hearted elderly spinster of the Glen, who had been\ninstalled as maid-of-all-work at the little house for some weeks.\nSusan had been up to the Glen to make a sick call, and had just\nreturned.\n\n\"How is poor old Aunt Mandy tonight?\" asked Miss Cornelia.\n\nSusan sighed.\n\n\"Very poorly--very poorly, Cornelia.  I am afraid she will soon be in\nheaven, poor thing!\"\n\n\"Oh, surely, it's not so bad as that!\" exclaimed Miss Cornelia,\nsympathetically.\n\nCaptain Jim and Gilbert looked at each other.  Then they suddenly rose\nand went out.\n\n\"There are times,\" said Captain Jim, between spasms, \"when it would be\na sin NOT to laugh.  Them two excellent women!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\nDAWN AND DUSK\n\nIn early June, when the sand hills were a great glory of pink wild\nroses, and the Glen was smothered in apple blossoms, Marilla arrived at\nthe little house, accompanied by a black horsehair trunk, patterned\nwith brass nails, which had reposed undisturbed in the Green Gables\ngarret for half a century.  Susan Baker, who, during her few weeks'\nsojourn in the little house, had come to worship \"young Mrs. Doctor,\"\nas she called Anne, with blind fervor, looked rather jealously askance\nat Marilla at first.  But as Marilla did not try to interfere in\nkitchen matters, and showed no desire to interrupt Susan's\nministrations to young Mrs. Doctor, the good handmaiden became\nreconciled to her presence, and told her cronies at the Glen that Miss\nCuthbert was a fine old lady and knew her place.\n\nOne evening, when the sky's limpid bowl was filled with a red glory,\nand the robins were thrilling the golden twilight with jubilant hymns\nto the stars of evening, there was a sudden commotion in the little\nhouse of dreams.  Telephone messages were sent up to the Glen, Doctor\nDave and a white-capped nurse came hastily down, Marilla paced the\ngarden walks between the quahog shells, murmuring prayers between her\nset lips, and Susan sat in the kitchen with cotton wool in her ears and\nher apron over her head.\n\nLeslie, looking out from the house up the brook, saw that every window\nof the little house was alight, and did not sleep that night.\n\nThe June night was short; but it seemed an eternity to those who waited\nand watched.\n\n\"Oh, will it NEVER end?\" said Marilla; then she saw how grave the nurse\nand Doctor Dave looked, and she dared ask no more questions.  Suppose\nAnne--but Marilla could not suppose it.\n\n\"Do not tell me,\" said Susan fiercely, answering the anguish in\nMarilla's eyes, \"that God could be so cruel as to take that darling\nlamb from us when we all love her so much.\"\n\n\"He has taken others as well beloved,\" said Marilla hoarsely.\n\nBut at dawn, when the rising sun rent apart the mists hanging over the\nsandbar, and made rainbows of them, joy came to the little house.  Anne\nwas safe, and a wee, white lady, with her mother's big eyes, was lying\nbeside her.  Gilbert, his face gray and haggard from his night's agony,\ncame down to tell Marilla and Susan.\n\n\"Thank God,\" shuddered Marilla.\n\nSusan got up and took the cotton wool out of her ears.\n\n\"Now for breakfast,\" she said briskly.  \"I am of the opinion that we\nwill all be glad of a bite and sup.  You tell young Mrs. Doctor not to\nworry about a single thing--Susan is at the helm.  You tell her just to\nthink of her baby.\"\n\nGilbert smiled rather sadly as he went away.  Anne, her pale face\nblanched with its baptism of pain, her eyes aglow with the holy passion\nof motherhood, did not need to be told to think of her baby.  She\nthought of nothing else.  For a few hours she tasted of happiness so\nrare and exquisite that she wondered if the angels in heaven did not\nenvy her.\n\n\"Little Joyce,\" she murmured, when Marilla came in to see the baby.\n\"We planned to call her that if she were a girlie.  There were so many\nwe would have liked to name her for; we couldn't choose between them,\nso we decided on Joyce--we can call her Joy for short--Joy--it suits so\nwell.  Oh, Marilla, I thought I was happy before.  Now I know that I\njust dreamed a pleasant dream of happiness.  THIS is the reality.\"\n\n\"You mustn't talk, Anne--wait till you're stronger,\" said Marilla\nwarningly.\n\n\"You know how hard it is for me NOT to talk,\" smiled Anne.\n\nAt first she was too weak and too happy to notice that Gilbert and the\nnurse looked grave and Marilla sorrowful.  Then, as subtly, and coldly,\nand remorselessly as a sea-fog stealing landward, fear crept into her\nheart.  Why was not Gilbert gladder?  Why would he not talk about the\nbaby?  Why would they not let her have it with her after that first\nheavenly--happy hour?  Was--was there anything wrong?\n\n\"Gilbert,\" whispered Anne imploringly, \"the baby--is all right--isn't\nshe?  Tell me--tell me.\"\n\nGilbert was a long while in turning round; then he bent over Anne and\nlooked in her eyes.  Marilla, listening fearfully outside the door,\nheard a pitiful, heartbroken moan, and fled to the kitchen where Susan\nwas weeping.\n\n\"Oh, the poor lamb--the poor lamb!  How can she bear it, Miss Cuthbert?\nI am afraid it will kill her.  She has been that built up and happy,\nlonging for that baby, and planning for it.  Cannot anything be done\nnohow, Miss Cuthbert?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not, Susan.  Gilbert says there is no hope.  He knew from\nthe first the little thing couldn't live.\"\n\n\"And it is such a sweet baby,\" sobbed Susan.  \"I never saw one so\nwhite--they are mostly red or yallow.  And it opened its big eyes as if\nit was months old.  The little, little thing!  Oh, the poor, young Mrs.\nDoctor!\"\n\nAt sunset the little soul that had come with the dawning went away,\nleaving heartbreak behind it.  Miss Cornelia took the wee, white lady\nfrom the kindly but stranger hands of the nurse, and dressed the tiny\nwaxen form in the beautiful dress Leslie had made for it.  Leslie had\nasked her to do that.  Then she took it back and laid it beside the\npoor, broken, tear-blinded little mother.\n\n\"The Lord has given and the Lord has taken away, dearie,\" she said\nthrough her own tears.  \"Blessed be the name of the Lord.\"\n\nThen she went away, leaving Anne and Gilbert alone together with their\ndead.\n\nThe next day, the small white Joy was laid in a velvet casket which\nLeslie had lined with apple-blossoms, and taken to the graveyard of the\nchurch across the harbor.  Miss Cornelia and Marilla put all the little\nlove-made garments away, together with the ruffled basket which had\nbeen befrilled and belaced for dimpled limbs and downy head.  Little\nJoy was never to sleep there; she had found a colder, narrower bed.\n\n\"This has been an awful disappointment to me,\" sighed Miss Cornelia.\n\"I've looked forward to this baby--and I did want it to be a girl, too.\"\n\n\"I can only be thankful that Anne's life was spared,\" said Marilla,\nwith a shiver, recalling those hours of darkness when the girl she\nloved was passing through the valley of the shadow.\n\n\"Poor, poor lamb!  Her heart is broken,\" said Susan.\n\n\"I ENVY Anne,\" said Leslie suddenly and fiercely, \"and I'd envy her\neven if she had died!  She was a mother for one beautiful day.  I'd\ngladly give my life for THAT!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't talk like that, Leslie, dearie,\" said Miss Cornelia\ndeprecatingly.  She was afraid that the dignified Miss Cuthbert would\nthink Leslie quite terrible.\n\nAnne's convalescence was long, and made bitter for her by many things.\nThe bloom and sunshine of the Four Winds world grated harshly on her;\nand yet, when the rain fell heavily, she pictured it beating so\nmercilessly down on that little grave across the harbor; and when the\nwind blew around the eaves she heard sad voices in it she had never\nheard before.\n\nKindly callers hurt her, too, with the well-meant platitudes with which\nthey strove to cover the nakedness of bereavement.  A letter from Phil\nBlake was an added sting.  Phil had heard of the baby's birth, but not\nof its death, and she wrote Anne a congratulatory letter of sweet mirth\nwhich hurt her horribly.\n\n\"I would have laughed over it so happily if I had my baby,\" she sobbed\nto Marilla.  \"But when I haven't it just seems like wanton\ncruelty--though I know Phil wouldn't hurt me for the world.  Oh,\nMarilla, I don't see how I can EVER be happy again--EVERYTHING will\nhurt me all the rest of my life.\"\n\n\"Time will help you,\" said Marilla, who was racked with sympathy but\ncould never learn to express it in other than age-worn formulas.\n\n\"It doesn't seem FAIR,\" said Anne rebelliously.  \"Babies are born and\nlive where they are not wanted--where they will be neglected--where\nthey will have no chance.  I would have loved my baby so--and cared for\nit so tenderly--and tried to give her every chance for good.  And yet I\nwasn't allowed to keep her.\"\n\n\"It was God's will, Anne,\" said Marilla, helpless before the riddle of\nthe universe--the WHY of undeserved pain.  \"And little Joy is better\noff.\"\n\n\"I can't believe THAT,\" cried Anne bitterly.  Then, seeing that Marilla\nlooked shocked, she added passionately, \"Why should she be born at\nall--why should any one be born at all--if she's better off dead?  I\nDON'T believe it is better for a child to die at birth than to live its\nlife out--and love and be loved--and enjoy and suffer--and do its\nwork--and develop a character that would give it a personality in\neternity.  And how do you know it was God's will?  Perhaps it was just\na thwarting of His purpose by the Power of Evil.  We can't be expected\nto be resigned to THAT.\"\n\n\"Oh, Anne, don't talk so,\" said Marilla, genuinely alarmed lest Anne\nwere drifting into deep and dangerous waters.  \"We can't\nunderstand--but we must have faith--we MUST believe that all is for the\nbest.  I know you find it hard to think so, just now.  But try to be\nbrave--for Gilbert's sake.  He's so worried about you.  You aren't\ngetting strong as fast as you should.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know I've been very selfish,\" sighed Anne.  \"I love Gilbert more\nthan ever--and I want to live for his sake.  But it seems as if part of\nme was buried over there in that little harbor graveyard--and it hurts\nso much that I'm afraid of life.\"\n\n\"It won't hurt so much always, Anne.\"\n\n\"The thought that it may stop hurting sometimes hurts me worse than all\nelse, Marilla.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know, I've felt that too, about other things.  But we all love\nyou, Anne.  Captain Jim has been up every day to ask for you--and Mrs.\nMoore haunts the place--and Miss Bryant spends most of her time, I\nthink, cooking up nice things for you.  Susan doesn't like it very\nwell.  She thinks she can cook as well as Miss Bryant.\"\n\n\"Dear Susan!  Oh, everybody has been so dear and good and lovely to me,\nMarilla.  I'm not ungrateful--and perhaps--when this horrible ache\ngrows a little less--I'll find that I can go on living.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\nLOST MARGARET\n\nAnne found that she could go on living; the day came when she even\nsmiled again over one of Miss Cornelia's speeches.  But there was\nsomething in the smile that had never been in Anne's smile before and\nwould never be absent from it again.\n\nOn the first day she was able to go for a drive Gilbert took her down\nto Four Winds Point, and left her there while he rowed over the channel\nto see a patient at the fishing village.  A rollicking wind was\nscudding across the harbor and the dunes, whipping the water into\nwhite-caps and washing the sandshore with long lines of silvery\nbreakers.\n\n\"I'm real proud to see you here again, Mistress Blythe,\" said Captain\nJim.  \"Sit down--sit down.  I'm afeared it's mighty dusty here\ntoday--but there's no need of looking at dust when you can look at such\nscenery, is there?\"\n\n\"I don't mind the dust,\" said Anne, \"but Gilbert says I must keep in\nthe open air.  I think I'll go and sit on the rocks down there.\"\n\n\"Would you like company or would you rather be alone?\"\n\n\"If by company you mean yours I'd much rather have it than be alone,\"\nsaid Anne, smiling.  Then she sighed.  She had never before minded\nbeing alone.  Now she dreaded it.  When she was alone now she felt so\ndreadfully alone.\n\n\"Here's a nice little spot where the wind can't get at you,\" said\nCaptain Jim, when they reached the rocks.  \"I often sit here.  It's a\ngreat place jest to sit and dream.\"\n\n\"Oh--dreams,\" sighed Anne.  \"I can't dream now, Captain Jim--I'm done\nwith dreams.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, you're not, Mistress Blythe--oh, no, you're not,\" said Captain\nJim meditatively.  \"I know how you feel jest now--but if you keep on\nliving you'll get glad again, and the first thing you know you'll be\ndreaming again--thank the good Lord for it!  If it wasn't for our\ndreams they might as well bury us.  How'd we stand living if it wasn't\nfor our dream of immortality?  And that's a dream that's BOUND to come\ntrue, Mistress Blythe.  You'll see your little Joyce again some day.\"\n\n\"But she won't be my baby,\" said Anne, with trembling lips.  \"Oh, she\nmay be, as Longfellow says, 'a fair maiden clothed with celestial\ngrace'--but she'll be a stranger to me.\"\n\n\"God will manage better'n THAT, I believe,\" said Captain Jim.\n\nThey were both silent for a little time.  Then Captain Jim said very\nsoftly:\n\n\"Mistress Blythe, may I tell you about lost Margaret?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Anne gently.  She did not know who \"lost Margaret\"\nwas, but she felt that she was going to hear the romance of Captain\nJim's life.\n\n\"I've often wanted to tell you about her,\" Captain Jim went on.\n\n\"Do you know why, Mistress Blythe?  It's because I want somebody to\nremember and think of her sometime after I'm gone.  I can't bear that\nher name should be forgotten by all living souls.  And now nobody\nremembers lost Margaret but me.\"\n\nThen Captain Jim told the story--an old, old forgotten story, for it\nwas over fifty years since Margaret had fallen asleep one day in her\nfather's dory and drifted--or so it was supposed, for nothing was ever\ncertainly known as to her fate--out of the channel, beyond the bar, to\nperish in the black thundersquall which had come up so suddenly that\nlong-ago summer afternoon.  But to Captain Jim those fifty years were\nbut as yesterday when it is past.\n\n\"I walked the shore for months after that,\" he said sadly, \"looking to\nfind her dear, sweet little body; but the sea never give her back to\nme.  But I'll find her sometime, Mistress Blythe--I'll find her\nsometime.  She's waiting for me.  I wish I could tell you jest how she\nlooked, but I can't.  I've seen a fine, silvery mist hanging over the\nbar at sunrise that seemed like her--and then again I've seen a white\nbirch in the woods back yander that made me think of her.  She had\npale, brown hair and a little white, sweet face, and long slender\nfingers like yours, Mistress Blythe, only browner, for she was a shore\ngirl.  Sometimes I wake up in the night and hear the sea calling to me\nin the old way, and it seems as if lost Margaret called in it.  And\nwhen there's a storm and the waves are sobbing and moaning I hear her\nlamenting among them.  And when they laugh on a gay day it's HER\nlaugh--lost Margaret's sweet, roguish, little laugh.  The sea took her\nfrom me, but some day I'll find her.  Mistress Blythe.  It can't keep\nus apart forever.\"\n\n\"I am glad you have told me about her,\" said Anne.  \"I have often\nwondered why you had lived all your life alone.\"\n\n\"I couldn't ever care for anyone else.  Lost Margaret took my heart\nwith her--out there,\" said the old lover, who had been faithful for\nfifty years to his drowned sweetheart.  \"You won't mind if I talk a\ngood deal about her, will you, Mistress Blythe?  It's a pleasure to\nme--for all the pain went out of her memory years ago and jest left its\nblessing.  I know you'll never forget her, Mistress Blythe.  And if the\nyears, as I hope, bring other little folks to your home, I want you to\npromise me that you'll tell THEM the story of lost Margaret, so that\nher name won't be forgotten among humankind.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\nBARRIERS SWEPT AWAY\n\n \"Anne,\" said Leslie, breaking abruptly a short\nsilence, \"you don't know how GOOD it is to be sitting here with you\nagain--working--and talking--and being silent together.\"\n\nThey were sitting among the blue-eyed grasses on the bank of the brook\nin Anne's garden.  The water sparkled and crooned past them; the\nbirches threw dappled shadows over them; roses bloomed along the walks.\nThe sun was beginning to be low, and the air was full of woven music.\nThere was one music of the wind in the firs behind the house, and\nanother of the waves on the bar, and still another from the distant\nbell of the church near which the wee, white lady slept.  Anne loved\nthat bell, though it brought sorrowful thoughts now.\n\nShe looked curiously at Leslie, who had thrown down her sewing and\nspoken with a lack of restraint that was very unusual with her.\n\n\"On that horrible night when you were so ill,\" Leslie went on, \"I kept\nthinking that perhaps we'd have no more talks and walks and WORKS\ntogether.  And I realised just what your friendship had come to mean to\nme--just what YOU meant--and just what a hateful little beast I had\nbeen.\"\n\n\"Leslie!  Leslie!  I never allow anyone to call my friends names.\"\n\n\"It's true.  That's exactly what I am--a hateful little beast. There's\nsomething I've GOT to tell you, Anne.  I suppose it will make you\ndespise me, but I MUST confess it.  Anne, there have been times this\npast winter and spring when I have HATED you.\"\n\n\"I KNEW it,\" said Anne calmly.\n\n\"You KNEW it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I saw it in your eyes.\"\n\n\"And yet you went on liking me and being my friend.\"\n\n\"Well, it was only now and then you hated me, Leslie.  Between times\nyou loved me, I think.\"\n\n\"I certainly did.  But that other horrid feeling was always there,\nspoiling it, back in my heart.  I kept it down--sometimes I forgot\nit--but sometimes it would surge up and take possession of me.  I hated\nyou because I ENVIED you--oh, I was sick with envy of you at times.\nYou had a dear little home--and love--and happiness--and glad\ndreams--everything I wanted--and never had--and never could have.  Oh,\nnever could have!  THAT was what stung.  I wouldn't have envied you, if\nI had had any HOPE that life would ever be different for me.  But I\nhadn't--I hadn't--and it didn't seem FAIR.  It made me rebellious--and\nit hurt me--and so I hated you at times.  Oh, I was so ashamed of\nit--I'm dying of shame now--but I couldn't conquer it.\n\n\"That night, when I was afraid you mightn't live--I thought I was going\nto be punished for my wickedness--and I loved you so then.  Anne, Anne,\nI never had anything to love since my mother died, except Dick's old\ndog--and it's so dreadful to have nothing to love--life is so\nEMPTY--and there's NOTHING worse than emptiness--and I might have loved\nyou so much--and that horrible thing had spoiled it--\"\n\nLeslie was trembling and growing almost incoherent with the violence of\nher emotion.\n\n\"Don't, Leslie,\" implored Anne, \"oh, don't.  I understand--don't talk\nof it any more.\"\n\n\"I must--I must.  When I knew you were going to live I vowed that I\nwould tell you as soon as you were well--that I wouldn't go on\naccepting your friendship and companionship without telling you how\nunworthy I was of it.  And I've been so afraid--it would turn you\nagainst me.\"\n\n\"You needn't fear that, Leslie.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm so glad--so glad, Anne.\"  Leslie clasped her brown,\nwork-hardened hands tightly together to still their shaking.  \"But I\nwant to tell you everything, now I've begun.  You don't remember the\nfirst time I saw you, I suppose--it wasn't that night on the shore--\"\n\n\"No, it was the night Gilbert and I came home.  You were driving your\ngeese down the hill.  I should think I DO remember it!  I thought you\nwere so beautiful--I longed for weeks after to find out who you were.\"\n\n\"I knew who YOU were, although I had never seen either of you before.\nI had heard of the new doctor and his bride who were coming to live in\nMiss Russell's little house.  I--I hated you that very moment, Anne.\"\n\n\"I felt the resentment in your eyes--then I doubted--I thought I must\nbe mistaken--because WHY should it be?\"\n\n\"It was because you looked so happy.  Oh, you'll agree with me now that\nI AM a hateful beast--to hate another woman just because she was\nhappy,--and when her happiness didn't take anything from me!  That was\nwhy I never went to see you.  I knew quite well I ought to go--even our\nsimple Four Winds customs demanded that.  But I couldn't.  I used to\nwatch you from my window--I could see you and your husband strolling\nabout your garden in the evening--or you running down the poplar lane\nto meet him.  And it hurt me.  And yet in another way I wanted to go\nover.  I felt that, if I were not so miserable, I could have liked you\nand found in you what I've never had in my life--an intimate, REAL\nfriend of my own age.  And then you remember that night at the shore?\nYou were afraid I would think you crazy.  You must have thought _I_\nwas.\"\n\n\"No, but I couldn't understand you, Leslie.  One moment you drew me to\nyou--the next you pushed me back.\"\n\n\"I was very unhappy that evening.  I had had a hard day.  Dick had been\nvery--very hard to manage that day.  Generally he is quite good-natured\nand easily controlled, you know, Anne.  But some days he is very\ndifferent.  I was so heartsick--I ran away to the shore as soon as he\nwent to sleep.  It was my only refuge.  I sat there thinking of how my\npoor father had ended his life, and wondering if I wouldn't be driven\nto it some day.  Oh, my heart was full of black thoughts!  And then you\ncame dancing along the cove like a glad, light-hearted child.  I--I\nhated you more then than I've ever done since.  And yet I craved your\nfriendship.  The one feeling swayed me one moment; the other feeling\nthe next.  When I got home that night I cried for shame of what you\nmust think of me.  But it's always been just the same when I came over\nhere.  Sometimes I'd be happy and enjoy my visit.  And at other times\nthat hideous feeling would mar it all.  There were times when\neverything about you and your house hurt me.  You had so many dear\nlittle things I couldn't have.  Do you know--it's ridiculous--but I had\nan especial spite at those china dogs of yours.  There were times when\nI wanted to catch up Gog and Magog and bang their pert black noses\ntogether!  Oh, you smile, Anne--but it was never funny to me.  I would\ncome here and see you and Gilbert with your books and your flowers, and\nyour household gods, and your little family jokes--and your love for\neach other showing in every look and word, even when you didn't know\nit--and I would go home to--you know what I went home to!  Oh, Anne, I\ndon't believe I'm jealous and envious by nature.  When I was a girl I\nlacked many things my schoolmates had, but I never cared--I never\ndisliked them for it.  But I seem to have grown so hateful--\"\n\n\"Leslie, dearest, stop blaming yourself.  You are NOT hateful or\njealous or envious.  The life you have to live has warped you a little,\nperhaps-but it would have ruined a nature less fine and noble than\nyours.  I'm letting you tell me all this because I believe it's better\nfor you to talk it out and rid your soul of it.  But don't blame\nyourself any more.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't.  I just wanted you to know me as I am.  That time you\ntold me of your darling hope for the spring was the worst of all, Anne.\nI shall never forgive myself for the way I behaved then.  I repented it\nwith tears.  And I DID put many a tender and loving thought of you into\nthe little dress I made.  But I might have known that anything I made\ncould only be a shroud in the end.\"\n\n\"Now, Leslie, that IS bitter and morbid--put such thoughts away.\n\n\"I was so glad when you brought the little dress; and since I had to\nlose little Joyce I like to think that the dress she wore was the one\nyou made for her when you let yourself love me.\"\n\n\"Anne, do you know, I believe I shall always love you after this.  I\ndon't think I'll ever feel that dreadful way about you again.  Talking\nit all out seems to have done away with it, somehow.  It's very\nstrange--and I thought it so real and bitter.  It's like opening the\ndoor of a dark room to show some hideous creature you've believed to be\nthere--and when the light streams in your monster turns out to have\nbeen just a shadow, vanishing when the light comes.  It will never come\nbetween us again.\"\n\n\"No, we are real friends now, Leslie, and I am very glad.\"\n\n\"I hope you won't misunderstand me if I say something else.  Anne, I\nwas grieved to the core of my heart when you lost your baby; and if I\ncould have saved her for you by cutting off one of my hands I would\nhave done it.  But your sorrow has brought us closer together.  Your\nperfect happiness isn't a barrier any longer.  Oh, don't misunderstand,\ndearest--I'm NOT glad that your happiness isn't perfect any longer--I\ncan say that sincerely; but since it isn't, there isn't such a gulf\nbetween us.\"\n\n\"I DO understand that, too, Leslie.  Now, we'll just shut up the past\nand forget what was unpleasant in it.  It's all going to be different.\nWe're both of the race of Joseph now.  I think you've been\nwonderful--wonderful.  And, Leslie, I can't help believing that life\nhas something good and beautiful for you yet.\"\n\nLeslie shook her head.\n\n\"No,\" she said dully.  \"There isn't any hope.  Dick will never be\nbetter--and even if his memory were to come back--oh, Anne, it would be\nworse, even worse, than it is now.  This is something you can't\nunderstand, you happy bride.  Anne, did Miss Cornelia ever tell you how\nI came to marry Dick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I'm glad--I wanted you to know--but I couldn't bring myself to talk of\nit if you hadn't known.  Anne, it seems to me that ever since I was\ntwelve years old life has been bitter.  Before that I had a happy\nchildhood.  We were very poor--but we didn't mind.  Father was so\nsplendid--so clever and loving and sympathetic.  We were chums as far\nback as I can remember.  And mother was so sweet.  She was very, very\nbeautiful.  I look like her, but I am not so beautiful as she was.\"\n\n\"Miss Cornelia says you are far more beautiful.\"\n\n\"She is mistaken--or prejudiced.  I think my figure IS better--mother\nwas slight and bent by hard work--but she had the face of an angel.  I\nused just to look up at her in worship.  We all worshipped her,--father\nand Kenneth and I.\"\n\nAnne remembered that Miss Cornelia had given her a very different\nimpression of Leslie's mother.  But had not love the truer vision?\nStill, it WAS selfish of Rose West to make her daughter marry Dick\nMoore.\n\n\"Kenneth was my brother,\" went on Leslie.  \"Oh, I can't tell you how I\nloved him.  And he was cruelly killed.  Do you know how?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Anne, I saw his little face as the wheel went over him.  He fell on\nhis back.  Anne--Anne--I can see it now.  I shall always see it.  Anne,\nall I ask of heaven is that that recollection shall be blotted out of\nmy memory.  O my God!\"\n\n\"Leslie, don't speak of it.  I know the story--don't go into details\nthat only harrow your soul up unavailingly.  It WILL be blotted out.\"\n\nAfter a moment's struggle, Leslie regained a measure of self-control.\n\n\"Then father's health got worse and he grew despondent--his mind became\nunbalanced--you've heard all that, too?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"After that I had just mother to live for.  But I was very ambitious.\nI meant to teach and earn my way through college.  I meant to climb to\nthe very top--oh, I won't talk of that either.  It's no use.  You know\nwhat happened.  I couldn't see my dear little heart-broken mother, who\nhad been such a slave all her life, turned out of her home.  Of course,\nI could have earned enough for us to live on.  But mother COULDN'T\nleave her home.  She had come there as a bride--and she had loved\nfather so--and all her memories were there.  Even yet, Anne, when I\nthink that I made her last year happy I'm not sorry for what I did.  As\nfor Dick--I didn't hate him when I married him--I just felt for him the\nindifferent, friendly feeling I had for most of my schoolmates.  I knew\nhe drank some--but I had never heard the story of the girl down at the\nfishing cove.  If I had, I COULDN'T have married him, even for mother's\nsake.  Afterwards--I DID hate him--but mother never knew.  She\ndied--and then I was alone.  I was only seventeen and I was alone.\nDick had gone off in the Four Sisters.  I hoped he wouldn't be home\nvery much more.  The sea had always been in his blood.  I had no other\nhope.  Well, Captain Jim brought him home, as you know--and that's all\nthere is to say.  You know me now, Anne--the worst of me--the barriers\nare all down.  And you still want to be my friend?\"\n\nAnne looked up through the birches, at the white paper-lantern of a\nhalf moon drifting downwards to the gulf of sunset.  Her face was very\nsweet.\n\n\"I am your friend and you are mine, for always,\" she said.  \"Such a\nfriend as I never had before.  I have had many dear and beloved\nfriends--but there is a something in you, Leslie, that I never found in\nanyone else.  You have more to offer me in that rich nature of yours,\nand I have more to give you than I had in my careless girlhood.  We are\nboth women--and friends forever.\"\n\nThey clasped hands and smiled at each other through the tears that\nfilled the gray eyes and the blue.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\nMISS CORNELIA ARRANGES MATTERS\n\nGilbert insisted that Susan should be kept on at the little house for\nthe summer.  Anne protested at first.\n\n\"Life here with just the two of us is so sweet, Gilbert.  It spoils it\na little to have anyone else.  Susan is a dear soul, but she is an\noutsider.  It won't hurt me to do the work here.\"\n\n\"You must take your doctor's advice,\" said Gilbert.  \"There's an old\nproverb to the effect that shoemakers' wives go barefoot and doctors'\nwives die young.  I don't mean that it shall be true in my household.\nYou will keep Susan until the old spring comes back into your step, and\nthose little hollows on your cheeks fill out.\"\n\n\"You just take it easy, Mrs. Doctor, dear,\" said Susan, coming abruptly\nin.  \"Have a good time and do not worry about the pantry.  Susan is at\nthe helm.  There is no use in keeping a dog and doing your own barking.\nI am going to take your breakfast up to you every morning.\"\n\n\"Indeed you are not,\" laughed Anne.  \"I agree with Miss Cornelia that\nit's a scandal for a woman who isn't sick to eat her breakfast in bed,\nand almost justifies the men in any enormities.\"\n\n\"Oh, Cornelia!\" said Susan, with ineffable contempt.  \"I think you have\nbetter sense, Mrs. Doctor, dear, than to heed what Cornelia Bryant\nsays.  I cannot see why she must be always running down the men, even\nif she is an old maid.  _I_ am an old maid, but you never hear ME\nabusing the men.  I like 'em.  I would have married one if I could.  Is\nit not funny nobody ever asked me to marry him, Mrs. Doctor, dear?  I\nam no beauty, but I am as good-looking as most of the married women you\nsee.  But I never had a beau.  What do you suppose is the reason?\"\n\n\"It may be predestination,\" suggested Anne, with unearthly solemnity.\n\nSusan nodded.\n\n\"That is what I have often thought, Mrs. Doctor, dear, and a great\ncomfort it is.  I do not mind nobody wanting me if the Almighty decreed\nit so for His own wise purposes.  But sometimes doubt creeps in, Mrs.\nDoctor, dear, and I wonder if maybe the Old Scratch has not more to do\nwith it than anyone else.  I cannot feel resigned THEN.  But maybe,\"\nadded Susan, brightening up, \"I will have a chance to get married yet.\nI often and often think of the old verse my aunt used to repeat:\n\n    There never was a goose so gray but sometime soon or late\n    Some honest gander came her way and took her for his mate!\n\nA woman cannot ever be sure of not being married till she is buried,\nMrs. Doctor, dear, and meanwhile I will make a batch of cherry pies.  I\nnotice the doctor favors 'em, and I DO like cooking for a man who\nappreciates his victuals.\"\n\nMiss Cornelia dropped in that afternoon, puffing a little.\n\n\"I don't mind the world or the devil much, but the flesh DOES rather\nbother me,\" she admitted.  \"You always look as cool as a cucumber,\nAnne, dearie.  Do I smell cherry pie?  If I do, ask me to stay to tea.\nHaven't tasted a cherry pie this summer.  My cherries have all been\nstolen by those scamps of Gilman boys from the Glen.\"\n\n\"Now, now, Cornelia,\" remonstrated Captain Jim, who had been reading a\nsea novel in a corner of the living room, \"you shouldn't say that about\nthose two poor, motherless Gilman boys, unless you've got certain\nproof.  Jest because their father ain't none too honest isn't any\nreason for calling them thieves.  It's more likely it's been the robins\ntook your cherries.  They're turrible thick this year.\"\n\n\"Robins!\" said Miss Cornelia disdainfully.  \"Humph!  Two-legged robins,\nbelieve ME!\"\n\n\"Well, most of the Four Winds robins ARE constructed on that\nprinciple,\" said Captain Jim gravely.\n\nMiss Cornelia stared at him for a moment.  Then she leaned back in her\nrocker and laughed long and ungrudgingly.\n\n\"Well, you HAVE got one on me at last, Jim Boyd, I'll admit.  Just look\nhow pleased he is, Anne, dearie, grinning like a Chessy-cat.  As for\nthe robins' legs if robins have great, big, bare, sunburned legs, with\nragged trousers hanging on 'em, such as I saw up in my cherry tree one\nmorning at sunrise last week, I'll beg the Gilman boys' pardon.  By the\ntime I got down they were gone.  I couldn't understand how they had\ndisappeared so quick, but Captain Jim has enlightened me.  They flew\naway, of course.\"\n\nCaptain Jim laughed and went away, regretfully declining an invitation\nto stay to supper and partake of cherry pie.\n\n\"I'm on my way to see Leslie and ask her if she'll take a boarder,\"\nMiss Cornelia resumed.  \"I'd a letter yesterday from a Mrs. Daly in\nToronto, who boarded a spell with me two years ago.  She wanted me to\ntake a friend of hers for the summer.  His name is Owen Ford, and he's\na newspaper man, and it seems he's a grandson of the schoolmaster who\nbuilt this house.  John Selwyn's oldest daughter married an Ontario man\nnamed Ford, and this is her son.  He wants to see the old place his\ngrandparents lived in.  He had a bad spell of typhoid in the spring and\nhasn't got rightly over it, so his doctor has ordered him to the sea.\nHe doesn't want to go to the hotel--he just wants a quiet home place.\nI can't take him, for I have to be away in August.  I've been appointed\na delegate to the W.F.M.S.  convention in Kingsport and I'm going.  I\ndon't know whether Leslie'll want to be bothered with him, either, but\nthere's no one else.  If she can't take him he'll have to go over the\nharbor.\"\n\n\"When you've seen her come back and help us eat our cherry pies,\" said\nAnne.  \"Bring Leslie and Dick, too, if they can come.  And so you're\ngoing to Kingsport?  What a nice time you will have.  I must give you a\nletter to a friend of mine there--Mrs. Jonas Blake.\"\n\n\"I've prevailed on Mrs. Thomas Holt to go with me,\" said Miss Cornelia\ncomplacently.  \"It's time she had a little holiday, believe ME.  She\nhas just about worked herself to death.  Tom Holt can crochet\nbeautifully, but he can't make a living for his family.  He never seems\nto be able to get up early enough to do any work, but I notice he can\nalways get up early to go fishing.  Isn't that like a man?\"\n\nAnne smiled.  She had learned to discount largely Miss Cornelia's\nopinions of the Four Winds men.  Otherwise she must have believed them\nthe most hopeless assortment of reprobates and ne'er-do-wells in the\nworld, with veritable slaves and martyrs for wives.  This particular\nTom Holt, for example, she knew to be a kind husband, a much loved\nfather, and an excellent neighbor.  If he were rather inclined to be\nlazy, liking better the fishing he had been born for than the farming\nhe had not, and if he had a harmless eccentricity for doing fancy work,\nnobody save Miss Cornelia seemed to hold it against him.  His wife was\na \"hustler,\" who gloried in hustling; his family got a comfortable\nliving off the farm; and his strapping sons and daughters, inheriting\ntheir mother's energy, were all in a fair way to do well in the world.\nThere was not a happier household in Glen St. Mary than the Holts'.\n\nMiss Cornelia returned satisfied from the house up the brook.\n\n\"Leslie's going to take him,\" she announced.  \"She jumped at the\nchance.  She wants to make a little money to shingle the roof of her\nhouse this fall, and she didn't know how she was going to manage it.  I\nexpect Captain Jim'll be more than interested when he hears that a\ngrandson of the Selwyns' is coming here.  Leslie said to tell you she\nhankered after cherry pie, but she couldn't come to tea because she has\nto go and hunt up her turkeys.  They've strayed away.  But she said, if\nthere was a piece left, for you to put it in the pantry and she'd run\nover in the cat's light, when prowling's in order, to get it.  You\ndon't know, Anne, dearie, what good it did my heart to hear Leslie send\nyou a message like that, laughing like she used to long ago.\n\n\"There's a great change come over her lately.  She laughs and jokes\nlike a girl, and from her talk I gather she's here real often.\"\n\n\"Every day--or else I'm over there,\" said Anne.  \"I don't know what I'd\ndo without Leslie, especially just now when Gilbert is so busy.  He's\nhardly ever home except for a few hours in the wee sma's.  He's really\nworking himself to death.  So many of the over-harbor people send for\nhim now.\"\n\n\"They might better be content with their own doctor,\" said Miss\nCornelia.  \"Though to be sure I can't blame them, for he's a Methodist.\nEver since Dr. Blythe brought Mrs. Allonby round folks think he can\nraise the dead.  I believe Dr. Dave is a mite jealous--just like a man.\nHe thinks Dr. Blythe has too many new-fangled notions!  'Well,' I says\nto him, 'it was a new-fangled notion saved Rhoda Allonby.  If YOU'D\nbeen attending her she'd have died, and had a tombstone saying it had\npleased God to take her away.'  Oh, I DO like to speak my mind to Dr.\nDave!  He's bossed the Glen for years, and he thinks he's forgotten\nmore than other people ever knew.  Speaking of doctors, I wish Dr.\nBlythe'd run over and see to that boil on Dick Moore's neck.  It's\ngetting past Leslie's skill.  I'm sure I don't know what Dick Moore\nwants to start in having boils for--as if he wasn't enough trouble\nwithout that!\"\n\n\"Do you know, Dick has taken quite a fancy to me,\" said Anne.  \"He\nfollows me round like a dog, and smiles like a pleased child when I\nnotice him.\"\n\n\"Does it make you creepy?\"\n\n\"Not at all.  I rather like poor Dick Moore.  He seems so pitiful and\nappealing, somehow.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't think him very appealing if you'd see him on his\ncantankerous days, believe ME.  But I'm glad you don't mind him--it's\nall the nicer for Leslie.  She'll have more to do when her boarder\ncomes.  I hope he'll be a decent creature.  You'll probably like\nhim--he's a writer.\"\n\n\"I wonder why people so commonly suppose that if two individuals are\nboth writers they must therefore be hugely congenial,\" said Anne,\nrather scornfully.  \"Nobody would expect two blacksmiths to be\nviolently attracted toward each other merely because they were both\nblacksmiths.\"\n\nNevertheless, she looked forward to the advent of Owen Ford with a\npleasant sense of expectation.  If he were young and likeable he might\nprove a very pleasant addition to society in Four Winds.  The\nlatch-string of the little house was always out for the race of Joseph.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\nOWEN FORD COMES\n\nOne evening Miss Cornelia telephoned down to Anne.\n\n\"The writer man has just arrived here.  I'm going to drive him down to\nyour place, and you can show him the way over to Leslie's.  It's\nshorter than driving round by the other road, and I'm in a mortal\nhurry.  The Reese baby has gone and fallen into a pail of hot water at\nthe Glen, and got nearly scalded to death and they want me right\noff--to put a new skin on the child, I presume.  Mrs. Reese is always\nso careless, and then expects other people to mend her mistakes.  You\nwon't mind, will you, dearie?  His trunk can go down tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Anne.  \"What is he like, Miss Cornelia?\"\n\n\"You'll see what he's like outside when I take him down.  As for what\nhe's like inside only the Lord who made him knows THAT.  I'm not going\nto say another word, for every receiver in the Glen is down.\"\n\n\"Miss Cornelia evidently can't find much fault with Mr. Ford's looks,\nor she would find it in spite of the receivers,\" said Anne.  \"I\nconclude therefore, Susan, that Mr. Ford is rather handsome than\notherwise.\"\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Doctor, dear, I DO enjoy seeing a well-looking man,\" said\nSusan candidly.  \"Had I not better get up a snack for him?  There is a\nstrawberry pie that would melt in your mouth.\"\n\n\"No, Leslie is expecting him and has his supper ready.  Besides, I want\nthat strawberry pie for my own poor man.  He won't be home till late,\nso leave the pie and a glass of milk out for him, Susan.\"\n\n\"That I will, Mrs. Doctor, dear.  Susan is at the helm.  After all, it\nis better to give pie to your own men than to strangers, who may be\nonly seeking to devour, and the doctor himself is as well-looking a man\nas you often come across.\"\n\nWhen Owen Ford came Anne secretly admitted, as Miss Cornelia towed him\nin, that he was very \"well-looking\" indeed.  He was tall and\nbroad-shouldered, with thick, brown hair, finely-cut nose and chin,\nlarge and brilliant dark-gray eyes.\n\n\"And did you notice his ears and his teeth, Mrs. Doctor, dear?\" queried\nSusan later on.  \"He has got the nicest-shaped ears I ever saw on a\nman's head.  I am choice about ears.  When I was young I was scared\nthat I might have to marry a man with ears like flaps.  But I need not\nhave worried, for never a chance did I have with any kind of ears.\"\n\nAnne had not noticed Owen Ford's ears, but she did see his teeth, as\nhis lips parted over them in a frank and friendly smile.  Unsmiling,\nhis face was rather sad and absent in expression, not unlike the\nmelancholy, inscrutable hero of Anne's own early dreams; but mirth and\nhumor and charm lighted it up when he smiled.  Certainly, on the\noutside, as Miss Cornelia said, Owen Ford was a very presentable fellow.\n\n\"You cannot realise how delighted I am to be here, Mrs. Blythe,\" he\nsaid, looking around him with eager, interested eyes.  \"I have an odd\nfeeling of coming home.  My mother was born and spent her childhood\nhere, you know.  She used to talk a great deal to me of her old home.\nI know the geography of it as well as of the one I lived in, and, of\ncourse, she told me the story of the building of the house, and of my\ngrandfather's agonised watch for the Royal William.  I had thought that\nso old a house must have vanished years ago, or I should have come to\nsee it before this.\"\n\n\"Old houses don't vanish easily on this enchanted coast,\" smiled Anne.\n\"This is a 'land where all things always seem the same'--nearly always,\nat least.  John Selwyn's house hasn't even been much changed, and\noutside the rose-bushes your grandfather planted for his bride are\nblooming this very minute.\"\n\n\"How the thought links me with them!  With your leave I must explore\nthe whole place soon.\"\n\n\"Our latch-string will always be out for you,\" promised Anne.  \"And do\nyou know that the old sea captain who keeps the Four Winds light knew\nJohn Selwyn and his bride well in his boyhood?  He told me their story\nthe night I came here--the third bride of the old house.\"\n\n\"Can it be possible?  This IS a discovery.  I must hunt him up.\"\n\n\"It won't be difficult; we are all cronies of Captain Jim.  He will be\nas eager to see you as you could be to see him.  Your grandmother\nshines like a star in his memory.  But I think Mrs. Moore is expecting\nyou.  I'll show you our 'cross-lots' road.\"\n\nAnne walked with him to the house up the brook, over a field that was\nas white as snow with daisies.  A boat-load of people were singing far\nacross the harbor.  The sound drifted over the water like faint,\nunearthly music wind-blown across a starlit sea.  The big light flashed\nand beaconed.  Owen Ford looked around him with satisfaction.\n\n\"And so this is Four Winds,\" he said.  \"I wasn't prepared to find it\nquite so beautiful, in spite of all mother's praises.  What\ncolors--what scenery--what charm!  I shall get as strong as a horse in\nno time.  And if inspiration comes from beauty, I should certainly be\nable to begin my great Canadian novel here.\"\n\n\"You haven't begun it yet?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"Alack-a-day, no.  I've never been able to get the right central idea\nfor it.  It lurks beyond me--it allures--and beckons--and recedes--I\nalmost grasp it and it is gone.  Perhaps amid this peace and\nloveliness, I shall be able to capture it.  Miss Bryant tells me that\nyou write.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do little things for children.  I haven't done much since I was\nmarried.  And--I have no designs on a great Canadian novel,\" laughed\nAnne.  \"That is quite beyond me.\"\n\nOwen Ford laughed too.\n\n\"I dare say it is beyond me as well.  All the same I mean to have a try\nat it some day, if I can ever get time.  A newspaper man doesn't have\nmuch chance for that sort of thing.  I've done a good deal of short\nstory writing for the magazines, but I've never had the leisure that\nseems to be necessary for the writing of a book.  With three months of\nliberty I ought to make a start, though--if I could only get the\nnecessary motif for it--the SOUL of the book.\"\n\nAn idea whisked through Anne's brain with a suddenness that made her\njump.  But she did not utter it, for they had reached the Moore house.\nAs they entered the yard Leslie came out on the veranda from the side\ndoor, peering through the gloom for some sign of her expected guest.\nShe stood just where the warm yellow light flooded her from the open\ndoor.  She wore a plain dress of cheap, cream-tinted cotton voile, with\nthe usual girdle of crimson.  Leslie was never without her touch of\ncrimson.  She had told Anne that she never felt satisfied without a\ngleam of red somewhere about her, if it were only a flower.  To Anne,\nit always seemed to symbolise Leslie's glowing, pent-up personality,\ndenied all expression save in that flaming glint.  Leslie's dress was\ncut a little away at the neck and had short sleeves.  Her arms gleamed\nlike ivory-tinted marble.  Every exquisite curve of her form was\noutlined in soft darkness against the light.  Her hair shone in it like\nflame.  Beyond her was a purple sky, flowering with stars over the\nharbor.\n\nAnne heard her companion give a gasp.  Even in the dusk she could see\nthe amazement and admiration on his face.\n\n\"Who is that beautiful creature?\" he asked.\n\n\"That is Mrs. Moore,\" said Anne.  \"She is very lovely, isn't she?\"\n\n\"I--I never saw anything like her,\" he answered, rather dazedly.  \"I\nwasn't prepared--I didn't expect--good heavens, one DOESN'T expect a\ngoddess for a landlady! Why, if she were clothed in a gown of\nsea-purple, with a rope of amethysts in her hair, she would be a\nveritable sea-queen.  And she takes in boarders!\"\n\n\"Even goddesses must live,\" said Anne.  \"And Leslie isn't a goddess.\nShe's just a very beautiful woman, as human as the rest of us.  Did\nMiss Bryant tell you about Mr. Moore?\"\n\n\"Yes,--he's mentally deficient, or something of the sort, isn't he?\nBut she said nothing about Mrs. Moore, and I supposed she'd be the\nusual hustling country housewife who takes in boarders to earn an\nhonest penny.\"\n\n\"Well, that's just what Leslie is doing,\" said Anne crisply.  \"And it\nisn't altogether pleasant for her, either.  I hope you won't mind Dick.\nIf you do, please don't let Leslie see it.  It would hurt her horribly.\nHe's just a big baby, and sometimes a rather annoying one.\"\n\n\"Oh, I won't mind him.  I don't suppose I'll be much in the house\nanyhow, except for meals.  But what a shame it all is!  Her life must\nbe a hard one.\"\n\n\"It is.  But she doesn't like to be pitied.\"\n\nLeslie had gone back into the house and now met them at the front door.\nShe greeted Owen Ford with cold civility, and told him in a\nbusiness-like tone that his room and his supper were ready for him.\nDick, with a pleased grin, shambled upstairs with the valise, and Owen\nFord was installed as an inmate of the old house among the willows.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24\n\nTHE LIFE-BOOK OF CAPTAIN JIM\n\n\"I have a little brown cocoon of an idea that may possibly expand into\na magnificent moth of fulfilment,\" Anne told Gilbert when she reached\nhome.  He had returned earlier than she had expected, and was enjoying\nSusan's cherry pie.  Susan herself hovered in the background, like a\nrather grim but beneficent guardian spirit, and found as much pleasure\nin watching Gilbert eat pie as he did in eating it.\n\n \"What is your idea?\" he asked.\n\n\"I sha'n't tell you just yet--not till I see if I can bring the thing\nabout.\"\n\n\"What sort of a chap is Ford?\"\n\n\"Oh, very nice, and quite good-looking.\"\n\n\"Such beautiful ears, doctor, dear,\" interjected Susan with a relish.\n\n\"He is about thirty or thirty-five, I think, and he meditates writing a\nnovel.  His voice is pleasant and his smile delightful, and he knows\nhow to dress.  He looks as if life hadn't been altogether easy for him,\nsomehow.\"\n\nOwen Ford came over the next evening with a note to Anne from Leslie;\nthey spent the sunset time in the garden and then went for a moonlit\nsail on the harbor, in the little boat Gilbert had set up for summer\noutings.  They liked Owen immensely and had that feeling of having\nknown him for many years which distinguishes the freemasonry of the\nhouse of Joseph.  \"He is as nice as his ears, Mrs. Doctor, dear,\" said\nSusan, when he had gone.  He had told Susan that he had never tasted\nanything like her strawberry shortcake and Susan's susceptible heart\nwas his forever.\n\n\"He has got a way with him,\"  she reflected, as she cleared up the\nrelics of the supper.  \"It is real queer he is not married, for a man\nlike that could have anybody for the asking.  Well, maybe he is like\nme, and has not met the right one yet.\"\n\nSusan really grew quite romantic in her musings as she washed the\nsupper dishes.\n\nTwo nights later Anne took Owen Ford down to Four Winds Point to\nintroduce him to Captain Jim.  The clover fields along the harbor shore\nwere whitening in the western wind, and Captain Jim had one of his\nfinest sunsets on exhibition.  He himself had just returned from a trip\nover the harbor.\n\n\"I had to go over and tell Henry Pollack he was dying.  Everybody else\nwas afraid to tell him.  They expected he'd take on turrible, for he's\nbeen dreadful determined to live, and been making no end of plans for\nthe fall.  His wife thought he oughter be told and that I'd be the best\none to break it to him that he couldn't get better.  Henry and me are\nold cronies--we sailed in the Gray Gull for years together.  Well, I\nwent over and sat down by Henry's bed and I says to him, says I, jest\nright out plain and simple, for if a thing's got to be told it may as\nwell be told first as last, says I, 'Mate, I reckon you've got your\nsailing orders this time,' I was sorter quaking inside, for it's an\nawful thing to have to tell a man who hain't any idea he's dying that\nhe is.  But lo and behold, Mistress Blythe, Henry looks up at me, with\nthose bright old black eyes of his in his wizened face and says, says\nhe, 'Tell me something I don't know, Jim Boyd, if you want to give me\ninformation.  I've known THAT for a week.'  I was too astonished to\nspeak, and Henry, he chuckled.  'To see you coming in here,' says he,\n'with your face as solemn as a tombstone and sitting down there with\nyour hands clasped over your stomach, and passing me out a blue-mouldy\nold item of news like that!  It'd make a cat laugh, Jim Boyd,' says he.\n'Who told you?' says I, stupid like.  'Nobody,' says he.  'A week ago\nTuesday night I was lying here awake--and I jest knew.  I'd suspicioned\nit before, but then I KNEW.  I've been keeping up for the wife's sake.\nAnd I'd LIKE to have got that barn built, for Eben'll never get it\nright.  But anyhow, now that you've eased your mind, Jim, put on a\nsmile and tell me something interesting,' Well, there it was.  They'd\nbeen so scared to tell him and he knew it all the time.  Strange how\nnature looks out for us, ain't it, and lets us know what we should know\nwhen the time comes?  Did I never tell you the yarn about Henry getting\nthe fish hook in his nose, Mistress Blythe?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, him and me had a laugh over it today.  It happened nigh unto\nthirty years ago.  Him and me and several more was out mackerel fishing\none day.  It was a great day--never saw such a school of mackerel in\nthe gulf--and in the general excitement Henry got quite wild and\ncontrived to stick a fish hook clean through one side of his nose.\nWell, there he was; there was barb on one end and a big piece of lead\non the other, so it couldn't be pulled out.  We wanted to take him\nashore at once, but Henry was game; he said he'd be jiggered if he'd\nleave a school like that for anything short of lockjaw; then he kept\nfishing away, hauling in hand over fist and groaning between times.\nFin'lly the school passed and we come in with a load; I got a file and\nbegun to try to file through that hook.  I tried to be as easy as I\ncould, but you should have heard Henry--no, you shouldn't either.  It\nwas well no ladies were around.  Henry wasn't a swearing man, but he'd\nheard some few matters of that sort along shore in his time, and he\nfished 'em all out of his recollection and hurled 'em at me.  Fin'lly\nhe declared he couldn't stand it and I had no bowels of compassion.  So\nwe hitched up and I drove him to a doctor in Charlottetown, thirty-five\nmiles--there weren't none nearer in them days--with that blessed hook\nstill hanging from his nose.  When we got there old Dr. Crabb jest took\na file and filed that hook jest the same as I'd tried to do, only he\nweren't a mite particular about doing it easy!\"\n\nCaptain Jim's visit to his old friend had revived many recollections\nand he was now in the full tide of reminiscences.\n\n\"Henry was asking me today if I remembered the time old Father Chiniquy\nblessed Alexander MacAllister's boat.  Another odd yarn--and true as\ngospel.  I was in the boat myself.  We went out, him and me, in\nAlexander MacAllister's boat one morning at sunrise.  Besides, there\nwas a French boy in the boat--Catholic of course.  You know old Father\nChiniquy had turned Protestant, so the Catholics hadn't much use for\nhim.  Well, we sat out in the gulf in the broiling sun till noon, and\nnot a bite did we get.  When we went ashore old Father Chiniquy had to\ngo, so he said in that polite way of his, 'I'm very sorry I cannot go\nout with you dis afternoon, Mr. MacAllister, but I leave you my\nblessing.  You will catch a t'ousand dis afternoon.  'Well, we did not\ncatch a thousand, but we caught exactly nine hundred and\nninety-nine--the biggest catch for a small boat on the whole north\nshore that summer.  Curious, wasn't it?  Alexander MacAllister, he says\nto Andrew Peters, 'Well, and what do you think of Father Chiniquy now?'\n'Vell,' growled Andrew, 'I t'ink de old devil has got a blessing left\nyet.'  Laws, how Henry did laugh over that today!\"\n\n\"Do you know who Mr. Ford is, Captain Jim?\" asked Anne, seeing that\nCaptain Jim's fountain of reminiscence had run out for the present.  \"I\nwant you to guess.\"\n\nCaptain Jim shook his head.\n\n\"I never was any hand at guessing, Mistress Blythe, and yet somehow\nwhen I come in I thought, 'Where have I seen them eyes before?'--for I\nHAVE seen 'em.\"\n\n\"Think of a September morning many years ago,\" said Anne, softly.\n\"Think of a ship sailing up the harbor--a ship long waited for and\ndespaired of.  Think of the day the Royal William came in and the first\nlook you had at the schoolmaster's bride.\"\n\nCaptain Jim sprang up.\n\n\"They're Persis Selwyn's eyes,\" he almost shouted.  \"You can't be her\nson--you must be her--\"\n\n\"Grandson; yes, I am Alice Selwyn's son.\"\n\nCaptain Jim swooped down on Owen Ford and shook his hand over again.\n\n\"Alice Selwyn's son!  Lord, but you're welcome!  Many's the time I've\nwondered where the descendants of the schoolmaster were living.  I knew\nthere was none on the Island.  Alice--Alice--the first baby ever born\nin that little house.  No baby ever brought more joy!  I've dandled her\na hundred times.  It was from my knee she took her first steps alone.\nCan't I see her mother's face watching her--and it was near sixty years\nago.  Is she living yet?\"\n\n\"No, she died when I was only a boy.\"\n\n\"Oh, it doesn't seem right that I should be living to hear that,\"\nsighed Captain Jim.  \"But I'm heart-glad to see you.  It's brought back\nmy youth for a little while.  You don't know yet what a boon THAT is.\nMistress Blythe here has the trick--she does it quite often for me.\"\n\nCaptain Jim was still more excited when he discovered that Owen Ford\nwas what he called a \"real writing man.\"  He gazed at him as at a\nsuperior being.  Captain Jim knew that Anne wrote, but he had never\ntaken that fact very seriously.  Captain Jim thought women were\ndelightful creatures, who ought to have the vote, and everything else\nthey wanted, bless their hearts; but he did not believe they could\nwrite.\n\n\"Jest look at A Mad Love,\" he would protest.  \"A woman wrote that and\njest look at it--one hundred and three chapters when it could all have\nbeen told in ten.  A writing woman never knows when to stop; that's the\ntrouble.  The p'int of good writing is to know when to stop.\"\n\n\"Mr. Ford wants to hear some of your stories, Captain Jim\" said Anne.\n\"Tell him the one about the captain who went crazy and imagined he was\nthe Flying Dutchman.\"\n\nThis was Captain Jim's best story.  It was a compound of horror and\nhumor, and though Anne had heard it several times she laughed as\nheartily and shivered as fearsomely over it as Mr. Ford did.  Other\ntales followed, for Captain Jim had an audience after his own heart.\nHe told how his vessel had been run down by a steamer; how he had been\nboarded by Malay pirates; how his ship had caught fire; how he helped a\npolitical prisoner escape from a South African republic; how he had\nbeen wrecked one fall on the Magdalens and stranded there for the\nwinter; how a tiger had broken loose on board ship; how his crew had\nmutinied and marooned him on a barren island--these and many other\ntales, tragic or humorous or grotesque, did Captain Jim relate.  The\nmystery of the sea, the fascination of far lands, the lure of\nadventure, the laughter of the world--his hearers felt and realised\nthem all.  Owen Ford listened, with his head on his hand, and the First\nMate purring on his knee, his brilliant eyes fastened on Captain Jim's\nrugged, eloquent face.\n\n\"Won't you let Mr. Ford see your life-book, Captain Jim?\" asked Anne,\nwhen Captain Jim finally declared that yarn-spinning must end for the\ntime.\n\n\"Oh, he don't want to be bothered with THAT,\" protested Captain Jim,\nwho was secretly dying to show it.\n\n\"I should like nothing better than to see it, Captain Boyd,\" said Owen.\n\"If it is half as wonderful as your tales it will be worth seeing.\"\n\nWith pretended reluctance Captain Jim dug his life-book out of his old\nchest and handed it to Owen.\n\n\"I reckon you won't care to wrastle long with my old hand o' write.  I\nnever had much schooling,\" he observed carelessly.  \"Just wrote that\nthere to amuse my nephew Joe.  He's always wanting stories.  Comes here\nyesterday and says to me, reproachful-like, as I was lifting a\ntwenty-pound codfish out of my boat, 'Uncle Jim, ain't a codfish a dumb\nanimal?'  I'd been a-telling him, you see, that he must be real kind to\ndumb animals, and never hurt 'em in any way.  I got out of the scrape\nby saying a codfish was dumb enough but it wasn't an animal, but Joe\ndidn't look satisfied, and I wasn't satisfied myself.  You've got to be\nmighty careful what you tell them little critters.  THEY can see\nthrough you.\"\n\nWhile talking, Captain Jim watched Owen Ford from the corner of his eye\nas the latter examined the life-book; and presently observing that his\nguest was lost in its pages, he turned smilingly to his cupboard and\nproceeded to make a pot of tea.  Owen Ford separated himself from the\nlife-book, with as much reluctance as a miser wrenches himself from his\ngold, long enough to drink his tea, and then returned to it hungrily.\n\n\"Oh, you can take that thing home with you if you want to,\" said\nCaptain Jim, as if the \"thing\" were not his most treasured possession.\n\"I must go down and pull my boat up a bit on the skids.  There's a wind\ncoming.  Did you notice the sky tonight?\n\n    Mackerel skies and mares' tails\n    Make tall ships carry short sails.\"\n\nOwen Ford accepted the offer of the life-book gladly.  On their way\nhome Anne told him the story of lost Margaret.\n\n\"That old captain is a wonderful old fellow,\" he said.  \"What a life he\nhas led!  Why, the man had more adventures in one week of his life than\nmost of us have in a lifetime.  Do you really think his tales are all\ntrue?\"\n\n\"I certainly do.  I am sure Captain Jim could not tell a lie; and\nbesides, all the people about here say that everything happened as he\nrelates it.  There used to be plenty of his old shipmates alive to\ncorroborate him.  He's one of the last of the old type of P.E. Island\nsea-captains.  They are almost extinct now.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 25\n\nTHE WRITING OF THE BOOK\n\nOwen Ford came over to the little house the next morning in a state of\ngreat excitement.  \"Mrs. Blythe, this is a wonderful book--absolutely\nwonderful.  If I could take it and use the material for a book I feel\ncertain I could make the novel of the year out of it.  Do you suppose\nCaptain Jim would let me do it?\"\n\n\"Let you!  I'm sure he would be delighted,\" cried Anne.  \"I admit that\nit was what was in my head when I took you down last night.  Captain\nJim has always been wishing he could get somebody to write his\nlife-book properly for him.\"\n\n\"Will you go down to the Point with me this evening, Mrs. Blythe?  I'll\nask him about that life-book myself, but I want you to tell him that\nyou told me the story of lost Margaret and ask him if he will let me\nuse it as a thread of romance with which to weave the stories of the\nlife-book into a harmonious whole.\"\n\nCaptain Jim was more excited than ever when Owen Ford told him of his\nplan.  At last his cherished dream was to be realized and his\n\"life-book\" given to the world.  He was also pleased that the story of\nlost Margaret should be woven into it.\n\n\"It will keep her name from being forgotten,\" he said wistfully.\n\n\"That's why I want it put in.\"\n\n\"We'll collaborate,\" cried Owen delightedly.  \"You will give the soul\nand I the body.  Oh, we'll write a famous book between us, Captain Jim.\nAnd we'll get right to work.\"\n\n\"And to think my book is to be writ by the schoolmaster's grandson!\"\nexclaimed Captain Jim.  \"Lad, your grandfather was my dearest friend.\nI thought there was nobody like him.  I see now why I had to wait so\nlong.  It couldn't be writ till the right man come.  You BELONG\nhere--you've got the soul of this old north shore in you--you're the\nonly one who COULD write it.\"\n\nIt was arranged that the tiny room off the living room at the\nlighthouse should be given over to Owen for a workshop.  It was\nnecessary that Captain Jim should be near him as he wrote, for\nconsultation upon many matters of sea-faring and gulf lore of which\nOwen was quite ignorant.\n\nHe began work on the book the very next morning, and flung himself into\nit heart and soul.  As for Captain Jim, he was a happy man that summer.\nHe looked upon the little room where Owen worked as a sacred shrine.\nOwen talked everything over with Captain Jim, but he would not let him\nsee the manuscript.\n\n\"You must wait until it is published,\" he said.  \"Then you'll get it\nall at once in its best shape.\"\n\nHe delved into the treasures of the life-book and used them freely.  He\ndreamed and brooded over lost Margaret until she became a vivid reality\nto him and lived in his pages.  As the book progressed it took\npossession of him and he worked at it with feverish eagerness.  He let\nAnne and Leslie read the manuscript and criticise it; and the\nconcluding chapter of the book, which the critics, later on, were\npleased to call idyllic, was modelled upon a suggestion of Leslie's.\n\nAnne fairly hugged herself with delight over the success of her idea.\n\n\"I knew when I looked at Owen Ford that he was the very man for it,\"\nshe told Gilbert.  \"Both humor and passion were in his face, and that,\ntogether with the art of expression, was just what was necessary for\nthe writing of such a book.  As Mrs. Rachel would say, he was\npredestined for the part.\"\n\nOwen Ford wrote in the mornings.  The afternoons were generally spent\nin some merry outing with the Blythes.  Leslie often went, too, for\nCaptain Jim took charge of Dick frequently, in order to set her free.\nThey went boating on the harbor and up the three pretty rivers that\nflowed into it; they had clambakes on the bar and mussel-bakes on the\nrocks; they picked strawberries on the sand-dunes; they went out\ncod-fishing with Captain Jim; they shot plover in the shore fields and\nwild ducks in the cove--at least, the men did.  In the evenings they\nrambled in the low-lying, daisied, shore fields under a golden moon, or\nthey sat in the living room at the little house where often the\ncoolness of the sea breeze justified a driftwood fire, and talked of\nthe thousand and one things which happy, eager, clever young people can\nfind to talk about.\n\nEver since the day on which she had made her confession to Anne Leslie\nhad been a changed creature.  There was no trace of her old coldness\nand reserve, no shadow of her old bitterness.  The girlhood of which\nshe had been cheated seemed to come back to her with the ripeness of\nwomanhood; she expanded like a flower of flame and perfume; no laugh\nwas readier than hers, no wit quicker, in the twilight circles of that\nenchanted summer.  When she could not be with them all felt that some\nexquisite savor was lacking in their intercourse.  Her beauty was\nillumined by the awakened soul within, as some rosy lamp might shine\nthrough a flawless vase of alabaster.  There were hours when Anne's\neyes seemed to ache with the splendor of her.  As for Owen Ford, the\n\"Margaret\" of his book, although she had the soft brown hair and elfin\nface of the real girl who had vanished so long ago, \"pillowed where\nlost Atlantis sleeps,\" had the personality of Leslie Moore, as it was\nrevealed to him in those halcyon days at Four Winds Harbor.\n\nAll in all, it was a never-to-be-forgotten summer--one of those summers\nwhich come seldom into any life, but leave a rich heritage of beautiful\nmemories in their going--one of those summers which, in a fortunate\ncombination of delightful weather, delightful friends and delightful\ndoings, come as near to perfection as anything can come in this world.\n\n\"Too good to last,\" Anne told herself with a little sigh, on the\nSeptember day when a certain nip in the wind and a certain shade of\nintense blue on the gulf water said that autumn was hard by.\n\nThat evening Owen Ford told them that he had finished his book and that\nhis vacation must come to an end.\n\n\"I have a good deal to do to it yet--revising and pruning and so\nforth,\" he said, \"but in the main it's done.  I wrote the last sentence\nthis morning.  If I can find a publisher for it it will probably be out\nnext summer or fall.\"\n\nOwen had not much doubt that he would find a publisher.  He knew that\nhe had written a great book--a book that would score a wonderful\nsuccess--a book that would LIVE.  He knew that it would bring him both\nfame and fortune; but when he had written the last line of it he had\nbowed his head on the manuscript and so sat for a long time.  And his\nthoughts were not of the good work he had done.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 26\n\nOWEN FORD'S CONFESSION\n\n\"I'm so sorry Gilbert is away,\" said Anne.  \"He had to go--Allan Lyons\nat the Glen has met with a serious accident.  He will not likely be\nhome till very late.  But he told me to tell you he'd be up and over\nearly enough in the morning to see you before you left.  It's too\nprovoking.  Susan and I had planned such a nice little jamboree for\nyour last night here.\"\n\nShe was sitting beside the garden brook on the little rustic seat\nGilbert had built.  Owen Ford stood before her, leaning against the\nbronze column of a yellow birch.  He was very pale and his face bore\nthe marks of the preceding sleepless night.  Anne, glancing up at him,\nwondered if, after all, his summer had brought him the strength it\nshould.  Had he worked too hard over his book?  She remembered that for\na week he had not been looking well.\n\n\"I'm rather glad the doctor is away,\" said Owen slowly.  \"I wanted to\nsee you alone, Mrs. Blythe.  There is something I must tell somebody,\nor I think it will drive me mad.  I've been trying for a week to look\nit in the face--and I can't.  I know I can trust you--and, besides, you\nwill understand.  A woman with eyes like yours always understands.  You\nare one of the folks people instinctively tell things to.  Mrs. Blythe,\nI love Leslie.  LOVE her!  That seems too weak a word!\"\n\nHis voice suddenly broke with the suppressed passion of his utterance.\nHe turned his head away and hid his face on his arm.  His whole form\nshook.  Anne sat looking at him, pale and aghast.  She had never\nthought of this!  And yet--how was it she had never thought of it?  It\nnow seemed a natural and inevitable thing.  She wondered at her own\nblindness.  But--but--things like this did not happen in Four Winds.\nElsewhere in the world human passions might set at defiance human\nconventions and laws--but not HERE, surely.  Leslie had kept summer\nboarders off and on for ten years, and nothing like this had happened.\nBut perhaps they had not been like Owen Ford; and the vivid, LIVING\nLeslie of this summer was not the cold, sullen girl of other years.\nOh, SOMEBODY should have thought of this!  Why hadn't Miss Cornelia\nthought of it?  Miss Cornelia was always ready enough to sound the\nalarm where men were concerned. Anne felt an unreasonable resentment\nagainst Miss Cornelia.  Then she gave a little inward groan.  No matter\nwho was to blame the mischief was done.  And Leslie--what of Leslie?\nIt was for Leslie Anne felt most concerned.\n\n\"Does Leslie know this, Mr. Ford?\" she asked quietly.\n\n\"No--no,--unless she has guessed it.  You surely don't think I'd be cad\nand scoundrel enough to tell her, Mrs. Blythe.  I couldn't help loving\nher--that's all--and my misery is greater than I can bear.\"\n\n\"Does SHE care?\" asked Anne.  The moment the question crossed her lips\nshe felt that she should not have asked it.  Owen Ford answered it with\novereager protest.\n\n\"No--no, of course not.  But I could make her care if she were free--I\nknow I could.\"\n\n\"She does care--and he knows it,\" thought Anne.  Aloud she said,\nsympathetically but decidedly:\n\n\"But she is not free, Mr. Ford.  And the only thing you can do is to go\naway in silence and leave her to her own life.\"\n\n\"I know--I know,\" groaned Owen.  He sat down on the grassy bank and\nstared moodily into the amber water beneath him.  \"I know there's\nnothing to do--nothing but to say conventionally, 'Good-bye, Mrs.\nMoore.  Thank you for all your kindness to me this summer,' just as I\nwould have said it to the sonsy, bustling, keen-eyed housewife I\nexpected her to be when I came.  Then I'll pay my board money like any\nhonest boarder and go!  Oh, it's very simple.  No doubt--no\nperplexity--a straight road to the end of the world!\n\n\"And I'll walk it--you needn't fear that I won't, Mrs. Blythe.  But it\nwould be easier to walk over red-hot ploughshares.\"\n\nAnne flinched with the pain of his voice.  And there was so little she\ncould say that would be adequate to the situation.  Blame was out of\nthe question--advice was not needed--sympathy was mocked by the man's\nstark agony.  She could only feel with him in a maze of compassion and\nregret.  Her heart ached for Leslie!  Had not that poor girl suffered\nenough without this?\n\n\"It wouldn't be so hard to go and leave her if she were only happy,\"\nresumed Owen passionately.  \"But to think of her living death--to\nrealise what it is to which I do leave her!  THAT is the worst of all.\nI would give my life to make her happy--and I can do nothing even to\nhelp her--nothing.  She is bound forever to that poor wretch--with\nnothing to look forward to but growing old in a succession of empty,\nmeaningless, barren years.  It drives me mad to think of it.  But I\nmust go through my life, never seeing her, but always knowing what she\nis enduring.  It's hideous--hideous!\"\n\n\"It is very hard,\" said Anne sorrowfully.  \"We--her friends here--all\nknow how hard it is for her.\"\n\n\"And she is so richly fitted for life,\" said Owen rebelliously.\n\n\"Her beauty is the least of her dower--and she is the most beautiful\nwoman I've ever known.  That laugh of hers!  I've angled all summer to\nevoke that laugh, just for the delight of hearing it.  And her\neyes--they are as deep and blue as the gulf out there.  I never saw\nsuch blueness--and gold!  Did you ever see her hair down, Mrs. Blythe?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I did--once.  I had gone down to the Point to go fishing with Captain\nJim but it was too rough to go out, so I came back.  She had taken the\nopportunity of what she expected to be an afternoon alone to wash her\nhair, and she was standing on the veranda in the sunshine to dry it.\nIt fell all about her to her feet in a fountain of living gold.  When\nshe saw me she hurried in, and the wind caught her hair and swirled it\nall around her--Danae in her cloud.  Somehow, just then the knowledge\nthat I loved her came home to me--and realised that I had loved her\nfrom the moment I first saw her standing against the darkness in that\nglow of light.  And she must live on here--petting and soothing Dick,\npinching and saving for a mere existence, while I spend my life longing\nvainly for her, and debarred, by that very fact, from even giving her\nthe little help a friend might.  I walked the shore last night, almost\ntill dawn, and thrashed it all out over and over again.  And yet, in\nspite of everything, I can't find it in my heart to be sorry that I\ncame to Four Winds.  It seems to me that, bad as everything is, it\nwould be still worse never to have known Leslie.  It's burning, searing\npain to love her and leave her--but not to have loved her is\nunthinkable.  I suppose all this sounds very crazy--all these terrible\nemotions always do sound foolish when we put them into our inadequate\nwords.  They are not meant to be spoken--only felt and endured.  I\nshouldn't have spoken--but it has helped--some.  At least, it has given\nme strength to go away respectably tomorrow morning, without making a\nscene.  You'll write me now and then, won't you, Mrs. Blythe, and give\nme what news there is to give of her?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Anne.  \"Oh, I'm so sorry you are going--we'll miss you\nso--we've all been such friends!  If it were not for this you could\ncome back other summers.  Perhaps, even yet--by-and-by--when you've\nforgotten, perhaps--\"\n\n\"I shall never forget--and I shall never come back to Four Winds,\" said\nOwen briefly.\n\nSilence and twilight fell over the garden.  Far away the sea was\nlapping gently and monotonously on the bar.  The wind of evening in the\npoplars sounded like some sad, weird, old rune--some broken dream of\nold memories.  A slender shapely young aspen rose up before them\nagainst the fine maize and emerald and paling rose of the western sky,\nwhich brought out every leaf and twig in dark, tremulous, elfin\nloveliness.\n\n\"Isn't that beautiful?\" said Owen, pointing to it with the air of a man\nwho puts a certain conversation behind him.\n\n\"It's so beautiful that it hurts me,\" said Anne softly.  \"Perfect\nthings like that always did hurt me--I remember I called it 'the queer\nache' when I was a child.  What is the reason that pain like this seems\ninseparable from perfection?  Is it the pain of finality--when we\nrealise that there can be nothing beyond but retrogression?\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Owen dreamily, \"it is the prisoned infinite in us\ncalling out to its kindred infinite as expressed in that visible\nperfection.\"\n\n\"You seem to have a cold in the head.  Better rub some tallow on your\nnose when you go to bed,\" said Miss Cornelia, who had come in through\nthe little gate between the firs in time to catch Owen's last remark.\nMiss Cornelia liked Owen; but it was a matter of principle with her to\nvisit any \"high-falutin\" language from a man with a snub.\n\nMiss Cornelia personated the comedy that ever peeps around the corner\nat the tragedy of life.  Anne, whose nerves had been rather strained,\nlaughed hysterically, and even Owen smiled.  Certainly, sentiment and\npassion had a way of shrinking out of sight in Miss Cornelia's\npresence.  And yet to Anne nothing seemed quite as hopeless and dark\nand painful as it had seemed a few moments before.  But sleep was far\nfrom her eyes that night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 27\n\nON THE SAND BAR\n\nOwen Ford left Four Winds the next morning.  In the evening Anne went\nover to see Leslie, but found nobody.  The house was locked and there\nwas no light in any window.  It looked like a home left soulless.\nLeslie did not run over on the following day--which Anne thought a bad\nsign.\n\nGilbert having occasion to go in the evening to the fishing cove, Anne\ndrove with him to the Point, intending to stay awhile with Captain Jim.\nBut the great light, cutting its swathes through the fog of the autumn\nevening, was in care of Alec Boyd and Captain Jim was away.\n\n\"What will you do?\" asked Gilbert.  \"Come with me?\"\n\n\"I don't want to go to the cove--but I'll go over the channel with you,\nand roam about on the sand shore till you come back.  The rock shore is\ntoo slippery and grim tonight.\"\n\nAlone on the sands of the bar Anne gave herself up to the eerie charm\nof the night.  It was warm for September, and the late afternoon had\nbeen very foggy; but a full moon had in part lessened the fog and\ntransformed the harbor and the gulf and the surrounding shores into a\nstrange, fantastic, unreal world of pale silver mist, through which\neverything loomed phantom-like.  Captain Josiah Crawford's black\nschooner sailing down the channel, laden with potatoes for Bluenose\nports, was a spectral ship bound for a far uncharted land, ever\nreceding, never to be reached.  The calls of unseen gulls overhead were\nthe cries of the souls of doomed seamen.  The little curls of foam that\nblew across the sand were elfin things stealing up from the sea-caves.\nThe big, round-shouldered sand-dunes were the sleeping giants of some\nold northern tale.  The lights that glimmered palely across the harbor\nwere the delusive beacons on some coast of fairyland.  Anne pleased\nherself with a hundred fancies as she wandered through the mist.  It\nwas delightful--romantic--mysterious to be roaming here alone on this\nenchanted shore.\n\nBut was she alone?  Something loomed in the mist before her--took shape\nand form--suddenly moved towards her across the wave-rippled sand.\n\n\"Leslie!\" exclaimed Anne in amazement.  \"Whatever are you\ndoing--HERE--tonight?\"\n\n\"If it comes to that, whatever are YOU doing here?\" said Leslie, trying\nto laugh.  The effort was a failure.  She looked very pale and tired;\nbut the love locks under her scarlet cap were curling about her face\nand eyes like little sparkling rings of gold.\n\n\"I'm waiting for Gilbert--he's over at the Cove.  I intended to stay at\nthe light, but Captain Jim is away.\"\n\n\"Well, _I_ came here because I wanted to walk--and walk--and WALK,\"\nsaid Leslie restlessly.  \"I couldn't on the rock shore--the tide was\ntoo high and the rocks prisoned me.  I had to come here--or I should\nhave gone mad, I think.  I rowed myself over the channel in Captain\nJim's flat.  I've been here for an hour.  Come--come--let us walk.  I\ncan't stand still.  Oh, Anne!\"\n\n\"Leslie, dearest, what is the trouble?\" asked Anne, though she knew too\nwell already.\n\n\"I can't tell you--don't ask me.  I wouldn't mind your knowing--I wish\nyou did know--but I can't tell you--I can't tell anyone.  I've been\nsuch a fool, Anne--and oh, it hurts so terribly to be a fool.  There's\nnothing so painful in the world.\"\n\nShe laughed bitterly.  Anne slipped her arm around her.\n\n\"Leslie, is it that you have learned to care for Mr. Ford?\"\n\nLeslie turned herself about passionately.\n\n\"How did you know?\" she cried.  \"Anne, how did you know?  Oh, is it\nwritten in my face for everyone to see?  Is it as plain as that?\"\n\n\"No, no.  I--I can't tell you how I knew.  It just came into my mind,\nsomehow.  Leslie, don't look at me like that!\"\n\n\"Do you despise me?\" demanded Leslie in a fierce, low tone.  \"Do you\nthink I'm wicked--unwomanly?  Or do you think I'm just plain fool?\"\n\n\"I don't think you any of those things.  Come, dear, let's just talk it\nover sensibly, as we might talk over any other of the great crises of\nlife.  You've been brooding over it and let yourself drift into a\nmorbid view of it.  You know you have a little tendency to do that\nabout everything that goes wrong, and you promised me that you would\nfight against it.\"\n\n\"But--oh, it's so--so shameful,\" murmured Leslie.  \"To love\nhim--unsought--and when I'm not free to love anybody.\"\n\n\"There's nothing shameful about it.  But I'm very sorry that you have\nlearned to care for Owen, because, as things are, it will only make you\nmore unhappy.\"\n\n\"I didn't LEARN to care,\" said Leslie, walking on and speaking\npassionately.  \"If it had been like that I could have prevented it.  I\nnever dreamed of such a thing until that day, a week ago, when he told\nme he had finished his book and must soon go away.  Then--then I knew.\nI felt as if someone had struck me a terrible blow.  I didn't say\nanything--I couldn't speak--but I don't know what I looked like.  I'm\nso afraid my face betrayed me.  Oh, I would die of shame if I thought\nhe knew--or suspected.\"\n\nAnne was miserably silent, hampered by her deductions from her\nconversation with Owen.  Leslie went on feverishly, as if she found\nrelief in speech.\n\n\"I was so happy all this summer, Anne--happier than I ever was in my\nlife.  I thought it was because everything had been made clear between\nyou and me, and that it was our friendship which made life seem so\nbeautiful and full once more.  And it WAS, in part--but not all--oh,\nnot nearly all.  I know now why everything was so different.  And now\nit's all over--and he has gone.  How can I live, Anne?  When I turned\nback into the house this morning after he had gone the solitude struck\nme like a blow in the face.\"\n\n\"It won't seem so hard by and by, dear,\" said Anne, who always felt the\npain of her friends so keenly that she could not speak easy, fluent\nwords of comforting.  Besides, she remembered how well-meant speeches\nhad hurt her in her own sorrow and was afraid.\n\n\"Oh, it seems to me it will grow harder all the time,\" said Leslie\nmiserably.  \"I've nothing to look forward to.  Morning will come after\nmorning--and he will not come back--he will never come back.  Oh, when\nI think that I will never see him again I feel as if a great brutal\nhand had twisted itself among my heartstrings, and was wrenching them.\nOnce, long ago, I dreamed of love--and I thought it must be\nbeautiful--and NOW--its like THIS.  When he went away yesterday morning\nhe was so cold and indifferent.  He said 'Good-bye, Mrs. Moore' in the\ncoldest tone in the world--as if we had not even been friends--as if I\nmeant absolutely nothing to him.  I know I don't--I didn't want him to\ncare--but he MIGHT have been a little kinder.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wish Gilbert would come,\" thought Anne.  She was racked between\nher sympathy for Leslie and the necessity of avoiding anything that\nwould betray Owen's confidence.  She knew why his good-bye had been so\ncold--why it could not have the cordiality that their good-comradeship\ndemanded--but she could not tell Leslie.\n\n\"I couldn't help it, Anne--I couldn't help it,\" said poor Leslie.\n\n\"I know that.\"\n\n\"Do you blame me so very much?\"\n\n\"I don't blame you at all.\"\n\n\"And you won't--you won't tell Gilbert?\"\n\n\"Leslie!  Do you think I would do such a thing?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know--you and Gilbert are such CHUMS.  I don't see how you\ncould help telling him everything.\"\n\n\"Everything about my own concerns--yes.  But not my friends' secrets.\"\n\n\"I couldn't have HIM know.  But I'm glad YOU know.  I would feel guilty\nif there were anything I was ashamed to tell you.  I hope Miss Cornelia\nwon't find out.  Sometimes I feel as if those terrible, kind brown eyes\nof hers read my very soul.  Oh, I wish this mist would never lift--I\nwish I could just stay in it forever, hidden away from every living\nbeing.  I don't see how I can go on with life.  This summer has been so\nfull.  I never was lonely for a moment.  Before Owen came there used to\nbe horrible moments--when I had been with you and Gilbert--and then had\nto leave you.  You two would walk away together and I would walk away\nALONE.  After Owen came he was always there to walk home with me--we\nwould laugh and talk as you and Gilbert were doing--there were no more\nlonely, envious moments for me.  And NOW!  Oh, yes, I've been a fool.\nLet's have done talking about my folly.  I'll never bore you with it\nagain.\"\n\n\"Here is Gilbert, and you are coming back with us,\" said Anne, who had\nno intention of leaving Leslie to wander alone on the sand-bar on such\na night and in such a mood.  \"There's plenty of room in our boat for\nthree, and we'll tie the flat on behind.\"\n\n\"Oh, I suppose I must reconcile myself to being the odd one again,\"\nsaid poor Leslie with another bitter laugh.  \"Forgive me, Anne--that\nwas hateful.  I ought to be thankful--and I AM--that I have two good\nfriends who are glad to count me in as a third.  Don't mind my hateful\nspeeches.  I just seem to be one great pain all over and everything\nhurts me.\"\n\n\"Leslie seemed very quiet tonight, didn't she?\" said Gilbert, when he\nand Anne reached home.  \"What in the world was she doing over there on\nthe bar alone?\"\n\n\"Oh, she was tired--and you know she likes to go to the shore after one\nof Dick's bad days.\"\n\n\"What a pity she hadn't met and married a fellow like Ford long ago,\"\nruminated Gilbert.  \"They'd have made an ideal couple, wouldn't they?\"\n\n\"For pity's sake, Gilbert, don't develop into a match-maker.  It's an\nabominable profession for a man,\" cried Anne rather sharply, afraid\nthat Gilbert might blunder on the truth if he kept on in this strain.\n\n\"Bless us, Anne-girl, I'm not matchmaking,\" protested Gilbert, rather\nsurprised at her tone.  \"I was only thinking of one of the\nmight-have-beens.\"\n\n\"Well, don't.  It's a waste of time,\" said Anne.  Then she added\nsuddenly:\n\n\"Oh, Gilbert, I wish everybody could be as happy as we are.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 28\n\nODDS AND ENDS\n\n\"I've been reading obituary notices,\" said Miss Cornelia, laying down\nthe Daily Enterprise and taking up her sewing.\n\nThe harbor was lying black and sullen under a dour November sky; the\nwet, dead leaves clung drenched and sodden to the window sills; but the\nlittle house was gay with firelight and spring-like with Anne's ferns\nand geraniums.\n\n\"It's always summer here, Anne,\" Leslie had said one day; and all who\nwere the guests of that house of dreams felt the same.\n\n\"The Enterprise seems to run to obituaries these days,\" quoth Miss\nCornelia.  \"It always has a couple of columns of them, and I read every\nline.  It's one of my forms of recreation, especially when there's some\noriginal poetry attached to them.  Here's a choice sample for you:\n\n    She's gone to be with her Maker,\n    Never more to roam.\n    She used to play and sing with joy\n    The song of Home, Sweet Home.\n\nWho says we haven't any poetical talent on the Island!  Have you ever\nnoticed what heaps of good people die, Anne, dearie?  It's kind of\npitiful.  Here's ten obituaries, and every one of them saints and\nmodels, even the men.  Here's old Peter Stimson, who has 'left a large\ncircle of friends to mourn his untimely loss.' Lord, Anne, dearie, that\nman was eighty, and everybody who knew him had been wishing him dead\nthese thirty years.  Read obituaries when you're blue, Anne,\ndearie--especially the ones of folks you know.  If you've any sense of\nhumor at all they'll cheer you up, believe ME.  I just wish _I_ had the\nwriting of the obituaries of some people.  Isn't 'obituary' an awful\nugly word?  This very Peter I've been speaking of had a face exactly\nlike one.  I never saw it but I thought of the word OBITUARY then and\nthere.  There's only one uglier word that I know of, and that's RELICT.\nLord, Anne, dearie, I may be an old maid, but there's this comfort in\nit--I'll never be any man's 'relict.'\"\n\n\"It IS an ugly word,\" said Anne, laughing.  \"Avonlea graveyard was full\nof old tombstones 'sacred to the memory of So-and-So, RELICT of the\nlate So-and-So.'  It always made me think of something worn out and\nmoth eaten.  Why is it that so many of the words connected with death\nare so disagreeable?  I do wish that the custom of calling a dead body\n'the remains' could be abolished.  I positively shiver when I hear the\nundertaker say at a funeral, 'All who wish to see the remains please\nstep this way.'  It always gives me the horrible impression that I am\nabout to view the scene of a cannibal feast.\"\n\n\"Well, all I hope,\" said Miss Cornelia calmly, \"is that when I'm dead\nnobody will call me 'our departed sister.'  I took a scunner at this\nsister-and-brothering business five years ago when there was a\ntravelling evangelist holding meetings at the Glen.  I hadn't any use\nfor him from the start.  I felt in my bones that there was something\nwrong with him.  And there was.  Mind you, he was pretending to be a\nPresbyterian--PresbyTARian, HE called it--and all the time he was a\nMethodist.  He brothered and sistered everybody.  He had a large circle\nof relations, that man had.  He clutched my hand fervently one night,\nand said imploringly, 'My DEAR sister Bryant, are you a Christian?'  I\njust looked him over a bit, and then I said calmly, 'The only brother I\never had, MR. Fiske, was buried fifteen years ago, and I haven't\nadopted any since.  As for being a Christian, I was that, I hope and\nbelieve, when you were crawling about the floor in petticoats.'  THAT\nsquelched him, believe ME.  Mind you, Anne dearie, I'm not down on all\nevangelists.  We've had some real fine, earnest men, who did a lot of\ngood and made the old sinners squirm.  But this Fiske-man wasn't one of\nthem.  I had a good laugh all to myself one evening.  Fiske had asked\nall who were Christians to stand up.  _I_ didn't, believe me!  I never\nhad any use for that sort of thing.  But most of them did, and then he\nasked all who wanted to be Christians to stand up.  Nobody stirred for\na spell, so Fiske started up a hymn at the top of his voice.  Just in\nfront of me poor little Ikey Baker was sitting in the Millison pew.  He\nwas a home boy, ten years old, and Millison just about worked him to\ndeath.  The poor little creature was always so tired he fell asleep\nright off whenever he went to church or anywhere he could sit still for\na few minutes.  He'd been sleeping all through the meeting, and I was\nthankful to see the poor child getting a rest, believe ME.  Well, when\nFiske's voice went soaring skyward and the rest joined in, poor Ikey\nwakened with a start.  He thought it was just an ordinary singing and\nthat everybody ought to stand up, so he scrambled to his feet mighty\nquick, knowing he'd get a combing down from Maria Millison for sleeping\nin meeting.  Fiske saw him, stopped and shouted, 'Another soul saved!\nGlory Hallelujah!'  And there was poor, frightened Ikey, only half\nawake and yawning, never thinking about his soul at all.  Poor child,\nhe never had time to think of anything but his tired, overworked little\nbody.\n\n\"Leslie went one night and the Fiske-man got right after her--oh, he\nwas especially anxious about the souls of the nice-looking girls,\nbelieve me!--and he hurt her feelings so she never went again.  And\nthen he prayed every night after that, right in public, that the Lord\nwould soften her hard heart.  Finally I went to Mr. Leavitt, our\nminister then, and told him if he didn't make Fiske stop that I'd just\nrise up the next night and throw my hymn book at him when he mentioned\nthat 'beautiful but unrepentant young woman.'  I'd have done it too,\nbelieve ME.  Mr. Leavitt did put a stop to it, but Fiske kept on with\nhis meetings until Charley Douglas put an end to his career in the\nGlen.  Mrs. Charley had been out in California all winter.  She'd been\nreal melancholy in the fall--religious melancholy--it ran in her\nfamily.  Her father worried so much over believing that he had\ncommitted the unpardonable sin that he died in the asylum.  So when\nRose Douglas got that way Charley packed her off to visit her sister in\nLos Angeles.  She got perfectly well and came home just when the Fiske\nrevival was in full swing.  She stepped off the train at the Glen, real\nsmiling and chipper, and the first thing she saw staring her in the\nface on the black, gable-end of the freight shed, was the question, in\nbig white letters, two feet high, 'Whither goest thou--to heaven or\nhell?' That had been one of Fiske's ideas, and he had got Henry Hammond\nto paint it.  Rose just gave a shriek and fainted; and when they got\nher home she was worse than ever.  Charley Douglas went to Mr. Leavitt\nand told him that every Douglas would leave the church if Fiske was\nkept there any longer.  Mr. Leavitt had to give in, for the Douglases\npaid half his salary, so Fiske departed, and we had to depend on our\nBibles once more for instructions on how to get to heaven.  After he\nwas gone Mr. Leavitt found out he was just a masquerading Methodist,\nand he felt pretty sick, believe ME.  Mr. Leavitt fell short in some\nways, but he was a good, sound Presbyterian.\"\n\n\"By the way, I had a letter from Mr. Ford yesterday,\" said Anne.  \"He\nasked me to remember him kindly to you.\"\n\n\"I don't want his remembrances,\" said Miss Cornelia, curtly.\n\n\"Why?\" said Anne, in astonishment.  \"I thought you liked him.\"\n\n\"Well, so I did, in a kind of way.  But I'll never forgive him for what\nhe done to Leslie.  There's that poor child eating her heart out about\nhim--as if she hadn't had trouble enough--and him ranting round\nToronto, I've no doubt, enjoying himself same as ever.  Just like a\nman.\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss Cornelia, how did you find out?\"\n\n\"Lord, Anne, dearie, I've got eyes, haven't I?  And I've known Leslie\nsince she was a baby.  There's been a new kind of heartbreak in her\neyes all the fall, and I know that writer-man was behind it somehow.\nI'll never forgive myself for being the means of bringing him here.\nBut I never expected he'd be like he was.  I thought he'd just be like\nthe other men Leslie had boarded--conceited young asses, every one of\nthem, that she never had any use for.  One of them did try to flirt\nwith her once and she froze him out--so bad, I feel sure he's never got\nhimself thawed since.  So I never thought of any danger.\"\n\n\"Don't let Leslie suspect you know her secret,\" said Anne hurriedly.\n\"I think it would hurt her.\"\n\n\"Trust me, Anne, dearie.  _I_ wasn't born yesterday.  Oh, a plague on\nall the men!  One of them ruined Leslie's life to begin with, and now\nanother of the tribe comes and makes her still more wretched.  Anne,\nthis world is an awful place, believe me.\"\n\n    \"There's something in the world amiss\n    Will be unriddled by and by,\"\n\nquoted Anne dreamily.\n\n\"If it is, it'll be in a world where there aren't any men,\" said Miss\nCornelia gloomily.\n\n\"What have the men been doing now?\" asked Gilbert, entering.\n\n\"Mischief--mischief!  What else did they ever do?\"\n\n\"It was Eve ate the apple, Miss Cornelia.\"\n\n\"'Twas a he-creature tempted her,\" retorted Miss Cornelia triumphantly.\n\nLeslie, after her first anguish was over, found it possible to go on\nwith life after all, as most of us do, no matter what our particular\nform of torment has been.  It is even possible that she enjoyed moments\nof it, when she was one of the gay circle in the little house of\ndreams.  But if Anne ever hoped that she was forgetting Owen Ford she\nwould have been undeceived by the furtive hunger in Leslie's eyes\nwhenever his name was mentioned.  Pitiful to that hunger, Anne always\ncontrived to tell Captain Jim or Gilbert bits of news from Owen's\nletters when Leslie was with them.  The girl's flush and pallor at such\nmoments spoke all too eloquently of the emotion that filled her being.\nBut she never spoke of him to Anne, or mentioned that night on the\nsand-bar.\n\nOne day her old dog died and she grieved bitterly over him.\n\n\"He's been my friend so long,\" she said sorrowfully to Anne.  \"He was\nDick's old dog, you know--Dick had him for a year or so before we were\nmarried.  He left him with me when he sailed on the Four Sisters.\nCarlo got very fond of me--and his dog-love helped me through that\nfirst dreadful year after mother died, when I was alone.  When I heard\nthat Dick was coming back I was afraid Carlo wouldn't be so much mine.\nBut he never seemed to care for Dick, though he had been so fond of him\nonce.  He would snap and growl at him as if he were a stranger.  I was\nglad.  It was nice to have one thing whose love was all mine.  That old\ndog has been such a comfort to me, Anne.  He got so feeble in the fall\nthat I was afraid he couldn't live long--but I hoped I could nurse him\nthrough the winter.  He seemed pretty well this morning.  He was lying\non the rug before the fire; then, all at once, he got up and crept over\nto me; he put his head on my lap and gave me one loving look out of his\nbig, soft, dog eyes--and then he just shivered and died.  I shall miss\nhim so.\"\n\n\"Let me give you another dog, Leslie,\" said Anne.  \"I'm getting a\nlovely Gordon setter for a Christmas present for Gilbert.  Let me give\nyou one too.\"\n\nLeslie shook her head.\n\n\"Not just now, thank you, Anne.  I don't feel like having another dog\nyet.  I don't seem to have any affection left for another.  Perhaps--in\ntime--I'll let you give me one.  I really need one as a kind of\nprotection.  But there was something almost human about Carlo--it\nwouldn't be DECENT to fill his place too hurriedly, dear old fellow.\"\n\nAnne went to Avonlea a week before Christmas and stayed until after the\nholidays.  Gilbert came up for her, and there was a glad New Year\ncelebration at Green Gables, when Barrys and Blythes and Wrights\nassembled to devour a dinner which had cost Mrs. Rachel and Marilla\nmuch careful thought and preparation.  When they went back to Four\nWinds the little house was almost drifted over, for the third storm of\na winter that was to prove phenomenally stormy had whirled up the\nharbor and heaped huge snow mountains about everything it encountered.\nBut Captain Jim had shovelled out doors and paths, and Miss Cornelia\nhad come down and kindled the hearth-fire.\n\n\"It's good to see you back, Anne, dearie!  But did you ever see such\ndrifts?  You can't see the Moore place at all unless you go upstairs.\nLeslie'll be so glad you're back.  She's almost buried alive over\nthere.  Fortunately Dick can shovel snow, and thinks it's great fun.\nSusan sent me word to tell you she would be on hand tomorrow.  Where\nare you off to now, Captain?\"\n\n\"I reckon I'll plough up to the Glen and sit a bit with old Martin\nStrong.  He's not far from his end and he's lonesome.  He hasn't many\nfriends--been too busy all his life to make any.  He's made heaps of\nmoney, though.\"\n\n\"Well, he thought that since he couldn't serve God and Mammon he'd\nbetter stick to Mammon,\" said Miss Cornelia crisply.  \"So he shouldn't\ncomplain if he doesn't find Mammon very good company now.\"\n\nCaptain Jim went out, but remembered something in the yard and turned\nback for a moment.\n\n\"I'd a letter from Mr. Ford, Mistress Blythe, and he says the life-book\nis accepted and is going to be published next fall.  I felt fair\nuplifted when I got the news.  To think that I'm to see it in print at\nlast.\"\n\n\"That man is clean crazy on the subject of his life-book,\" said Miss\nCornelia compassionately.  \"For my part, I think there's far too many\nbooks in the world now.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 29\n\nGILBERT AND ANNE DISAGREE\n\nGilbert laid down the ponderous medical tome over which he had been\nporing until the increasing dusk of the March evening made him desist.\nHe leaned back in his chair and gazed meditatively out of the window.\nIt was early spring--probably the ugliest time of the year.  Not even\nthe sunset could redeem the dead, sodden landscape and rotten black\nharbor ice upon which he looked.  No sign of life was visible, save a\nbig black crow winging his solitary way across a leaden field.  Gilbert\nspeculated idly concerning that crow.  Was he a family crow, with a\nblack but comely crow wife awaiting him in the woods beyond the Glen?\nOr was he a glossy young buck of a crow on courting thoughts intent?\nOr was he a cynical bachelor crow, believing that he travels the\nfastest who travels alone?  Whatever he was, he soon disappeared in\ncongenial gloom and Gilbert turned to the cheerier view indoors.\n\nThe firelight flickered from point to point, gleaming on the white and\ngreen coats of Gog and Magog, on the sleek, brown head of the beautiful\nsetter basking on the rug, on the picture frames on the walls, on the\nvaseful of daffodils from the window garden, on Anne herself, sitting\nby her little table, with her sewing beside her and her hands clasped\nover her knee while she traced out pictures in the fire--Castles in\nSpain whose airy turrets pierced moonlit cloud and sunset bar-ships\nsailing from the Haven of Good Hopes straight to Four Winds Harbor with\nprecious burthen.  For Anne was again a dreamer of dreams, albeit a\ngrim shape of fear went with her night and day to shadow and darken her\nvisions.\n\nGilbert was accustomed to refer to himself as \"an old married man.\"\nBut he still looked upon Anne with the incredulous eyes of a lover.  He\ncouldn't wholly believe yet that she was really his.  It MIGHT be only\na dream after all, part and parcel of this magic house of dreams.  His\nsoul still went on tip-toe before her, lest the charm be shattered and\nthe dream dispelled.\n\n\"Anne,\" he said slowly, \"lend me your ears.  I want to talk with you\nabout something.\"\n\nAnne looked across at him through the fire-lit gloom.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked gaily.  \"You look fearfully solemn, Gilbert.  I\nreally haven't done anything naughty today.  Ask Susan.\"\n\n\"It's not of you--or ourselves--I want to talk.  It's about Dick Moore.\"\n\n\"Dick Moore?\" echoed Anne, sitting up alertly.  \"Why, what in the world\nhave you to say about Dick Moore?\"\n\n\"I've been thinking a great deal about him lately.  Do you remember\nthat time last summer I treated him for those carbuncles on his neck?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes.\"\n\n\"I took the opportunity to examine the scars on his head thoroughly.\nI've always thought Dick was a very interesting case from a medical\npoint of view.  Lately I've been studying the history of trephining and\nthe cases where it has been employed.  Anne, I have come to the\nconclusion that if Dick Moore were taken to a good hospital and the\noperation of trephining performed on several places in his skull, his\nmemory and faculties might be restored.\"\n\n\"Gilbert!\" Anne's voice was full of protest.  \"Surely you don't mean\nit!\"\n\n\"I do, indeed.  And I have decided that it is my duty to broach the\nsubject to Leslie.\"\n\n\"Gilbert Blythe, you shall NOT do any such thing,\" cried Anne\nvehemently.  \"Oh, Gilbert, you won't--you won't.  You couldn't be so\ncruel.  Promise me you won't.\"\n\n\"Why, Anne-girl, I didn't suppose you would take it like this.  Be\nreasonable--\"\n\n\"I won't be reasonable--I can't be reasonable--I AM reasonable.  It is\nyou who are unreasonable.  Gilbert, have you ever once thought what it\nwould mean for Leslie if Dick Moore were to be restored to his right\nsenses?  Just stop and think!  She's unhappy enough now; but life as\nDick's nurse and attendant is a thousand times easier for her than life\nas Dick's wife.  I know--I KNOW!  It's unthinkable.  Don't you meddle\nwith the matter.  Leave well enough alone.\"\n\n\"I HAVE thought over that aspect of the case thoroughly, Anne.  But I\nbelieve that a doctor is bound to set the sanctity of a patient's mind\nand body above all other considerations, no matter what the\nconsequences may be.  I believe it his duty to endeavor to restore\nhealth and sanity, if there is any hope whatever of it.\"\n\n\"But Dick isn't your patient in that respect,\" cried Anne, taking\nanother tack.  \"If Leslie had asked you if anything could be done for\nhim, THEN it might be your duty to tell her what you really thought.\nBut you've no right to meddle.\"\n\n\"I don't call it meddling.  Uncle Dave told Leslie twelve years ago\nthat nothing could be done for Dick.  She believes that, of course.\"\n\n\"And why did Uncle Dave tell her that, if it wasn't true?\" cried Anne,\ntriumphantly.  \"Doesn't he know as much about it as you?\"\n\n\"I think not--though it may sound conceited and presumptuous to say it.\nAnd you know as well as I that he is rather prejudiced against what he\ncalls 'these new-fangled notions of cutting and carving.' He's even\nopposed to operating for appendicitis.\"\n\n\"He's right,\" exclaimed Anne, with a complete change of front.  'I\nbelieve myself that you modern doctors are entirely too fond of making\nexperiments with human flesh and blood.\"\n\n\"Rhoda Allonby would not be a living woman today if I had been afraid\nof making a certain experiment,\" argued Gilbert.  \"I took the risk--and\nsaved her life.\"\n\n\"I'm sick and tired of hearing about Rhoda Allonby,\" cried Anne--most\nunjustly, for Gilbert had never mentioned Mrs. Allonby's name since the\nday he had told Anne of his success in regard to her.  And he could not\nbe blamed for other people's discussion of it.\n\nGilbert felt rather hurt.\n\n\"I had not expected you to look at the matter as you do, Anne,\" he said\na little stiffly, getting up and moving towards the office door.  It\nwas their first approach to a quarrel.\n\nBut Anne flew after him and dragged him back.\n\n\"Now, Gilbert, you are not 'going off mad.'  Sit down here and I'll\napologise bee-YEW-ti-fully, I shouldn't have said that.  But--oh, if\nyou knew--\"\n\nAnne checked herself just in time.  She had been on the very verge of\nbetraying Leslie's secret.\n\n\"Knew what a woman feels about it,\" she concluded lamely.\n\n\"I think I do know.  I've looked at the matter from every point of\nview--and I've been driven to the conclusion that it is my duty to tell\nLeslie that I believe it is possible that Dick can be restored to\nhimself; there my responsibility ends.  It will be for her to decide\nwhat she will do.\"\n\n\"I don't think you've any right to put such a responsibility on her.\nShe has enough to bear.  She is poor--how could she afford such an\noperation?\"\n\n\"That is for her to decide,\" persisted Gilbert stubbornly.\n\n\"You say you think that Dick can be cured.  But are you SURE of it?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.  Nobody could be sure of such a thing.  There may have\nbeen lesions of the brain itself, the effect of which can never be\nremoved.  But if, as I believe, his loss of memory and other faculties\nis due merely to the pressure on the brain centers of certain depressed\nareas of bone, then he can be cured.\"\n\n\"But it's only a possibility!\" insisted Anne.  \"Now, suppose you tell\nLeslie and she decides to have the operation.  It will cost a great\ndeal.  She will have to borrow the money, or sell her little property.\nAnd suppose the operation is a failure and Dick remains the same.\n\n\"How will she be able to pay back the money she borrows, or make a\nliving for herself and that big helpless creature if she sells the\nfarm?\"\n\n\"Oh, I know--I know.  But it is my duty to tell her.  I can't get away\nfrom that conviction.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know the Blythe stubbornness,\" groaned Anne.  \"But don't do this\nsolely on your own responsibility.  Consult Doctor Dave.\"\n\n\"I HAVE done so,\" said Gilbert reluctantly.\n\n\"And what did he say?\"\n\n\"In brief--as you say--leave well enough alone.  Apart from his\nprejudice against new-fangled surgery, I'm afraid he looks at the case\nfrom your point of view--don't do it, for Leslie's sake.\"\n\n\"There now,\" cried Anne triumphantly.  \"I do think, Gilbert, that you\nought to abide by the judgment of a man nearly eighty, who has seen a\ngreat deal and saved scores of lives himself--surely his opinion ought\nto weigh more than a mere boy's.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Don't laugh.  It's too serious.\"\n\n\"That's just my point.  It IS serious.  Here is a man who is a helpless\nburden.  He may be restored to reason and usefulness--\"\n\n\"He was so very useful before,\" interjected Anne witheringly.\n\n\"He may be given a chance to make good and redeem the past.  His wife\ndoesn't know this.  I do.  It is therefore my duty to tell her that\nthere is such a possibility.  That, boiled down, is my decision.\"\n\n\"Don't say 'decision' yet, Gilbert.  Consult somebody else.  Ask\nCaptain Jim what he thinks about it.\"\n\n\"Very well.  But I'll not promise to abide by his opinion, Anne.\n\n\"This is something a man must decide for himself.  My conscience would\nnever be easy if I kept silent on the subject.\"\n\n\"Oh, your conscience!\" moaned Anne.  \"I suppose that Uncle Dave has a\nconscience too, hasn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes.  But I am not the keeper of his conscience.  Come, Anne, if this\naffair did not concern Leslie--if it were a purely abstract case, you\nwould agree with me,--you know you would.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't,\" vowed Anne, trying to believe it herself.  \"Oh, you can\nargue all night, Gilbert, but you won't convince me.  Just you ask Miss\nCornelia what she thinks of it.\"\n\n\"You're driven to the last ditch, Anne, when you bring up Miss Cornelia\nas a reinforcement.  She will say, 'Just like a man,' and rage\nfuriously.  No matter.  This is no affair for Miss Cornelia to settle.\nLeslie alone must decide it.\"\n\n\"You know very well how she will decide it,\" said Anne, almost in\ntears.  \"She has ideals of duty, too.  I don't see how you can take\nsuch a responsibility on your shoulders.  _I_ couldn't.\"\n\n    \"'Because right is right to follow right\n    Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence,'\"\n\nquoted Gilbert.\n\n\"Oh, you think a couplet of poetry a convincing argument!\" scoffed\nAnne.  \"That is so like a man.\"\n\nAnd then she laughed in spite of herself.  It sounded so like an echo\nof Miss Cornelia.\n\n\"Well, if you won't accept Tennyson as an authority, perhaps you will\nbelieve the words of a Greater than he,\" said Gilbert seriously.  \"'Ye\nshall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.'  I believe\nthat, Anne, with all my heart.  It's the greatest and grandest verse in\nthe Bible--or in any literature--and the TRUEST, if there are\ncomparative degrees of trueness.  And it's the first duty of a man to\ntell the truth, as he sees it and believes it.\"\n\n\"In this case the truth won't make poor Leslie free,\" sighed Anne.  \"It\nwill probably end in still more bitter bondage for her.  Oh, Gilbert, I\nCAN'T think you are right.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 30\n\nLESLIE DECIDES\n\nA sudden outbreak of a virulent type of influenza at the Glen and down\nat the fishing village kept Gilbert so busy for the next fortnight that\nhe had no time to pay the promised visit to Captain Jim.  Anne hoped\nagainst hope that he had abandoned the idea about Dick Moore, and,\nresolving to let sleeping dogs lie, she said no more about the subject.\nBut she thought of it incessantly.\n\n\"I wonder if it would be right for me to tell him that Leslie cares for\nOwen,\" she thought.  \"He would never let her suspect that he knew, so\nher pride would not suffer, and it MIGHT convince him that he should\nlet Dick Moore alone.  Shall I--shall I?  No, after all, I cannot.  A\npromise is sacred, and I've no right to betray Leslie's secret.  But\noh, I never felt so worried over anything in my life as I do over this.\nIt's spoiling the spring--it's spoiling everything.\"\n\nOne evening Gilbert abruptly proposed that they go down and see Captain\nJim.  With a sinking heart Anne agreed, and they set forth.  Two weeks\nof kind sunshine had wrought a miracle in the bleak landscape over\nwhich Gilbert's crow had flown.  The hills and fields were dry and\nbrown and warm, ready to break into bud and blossom; the harbor was\nlaughter-shaken again; the long harbor road was like a gleaming red\nribbon; down on the dunes a crowd of boys, who were out smelt fishing,\nwere burning the thick, dry sandhill grass of the preceding summer.\nThe flames swept over the dunes rosily, flinging their cardinal banners\nagainst the dark gulf beyond, and illuminating the channel and the\nfishing village.  It was a picturesque scene which would at other times\nhave delighted Anne's eyes; but she was not enjoying this walk.\nNeither was Gilbert.  Their usual good-comradeship and Josephian\ncommunity of taste and viewpoint were sadly lacking.  Anne's\ndisapproval of the whole project showed itself in the haughty uplift of\nher head and the studied politeness of her remarks.  Gilbert's mouth\nwas set in all the Blythe obstinacy, but his eyes were troubled.  He\nmeant to do what he believed to be his duty; but to be at outs with\nAnne was a high price to pay.  Altogether, both were glad when they\nreached the light--and remorseful that they should be glad.\n\nCaptain Jim put away the fishing net upon which he was working, and\nwelcomed them joyfully.  In the searching light of the spring evening\nhe looked older than Anne had ever seen him.  His hair had grown much\ngrayer, and the strong old hand shook a little.  But his blue eyes were\nclear and steady, and the staunch soul looked out through them gallant\nand unafraid.\n\nCaptain Jim listened in amazed silence while Gilbert said what he had\ncome to say.  Anne, who knew how the old man worshipped Leslie, felt\nquite sure that he would side with her, although she had not much hope\nthat this would influence Gilbert.  She was therefore surprised beyond\nmeasure when Captain Jim, slowly and sorrowfully, but unhesitatingly,\ngave it as his opinion that Leslie should be told.\n\n\"Oh, Captain Jim, I didn't think you'd say that,\" she exclaimed\nreproachfully.  \"I thought you wouldn't want to make more trouble for\nher.\"\n\nCaptain Jim shook his head.\n\n\"I don't want to.  I know how you feel about it, Mistress Blythe--just\nas I feel meself.  But it ain't our feelings we have to steer by\nthrough life--no, no, we'd make shipwreck mighty often if we did that.\nThere's only the one safe compass and we've got to set our course by\nthat--what it's right to do.  I agree with the doctor.  If there's a\nchance for Dick, Leslie should be told of it.  There's no two sides to\nthat, in my opinion.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Anne, giving up in despair, \"wait until Miss Cornelia gets\nafter you two men.\"\n\n\"Cornelia'll rake us fore and aft, no doubt,\" assented Captain Jim.\n\"You women are lovely critters, Mistress Blythe, but you're just a mite\nillogical.  You're a highly eddicated lady and Cornelia isn't, but\nyou're like as two peas when it comes to that.  I dunno's you're any\nthe worse for it.  Logic is a sort of hard, merciless thing, I reckon.\nNow, I'll brew a cup of tea and we'll drink it and talk of pleasant\nthings, jest to calm our minds a bit.\"\n\nAt least, Captain Jim's tea and conversation calmed Anne's mind to such\nan extent that she did not make Gilbert suffer so acutely on the way\nhome as she had deliberately intended to do.  She did not refer to the\nburning question at all, but she chatted amiably of other matters, and\nGilbert understood that he was forgiven under protest.\n\n\"Captain Jim seems very frail and bent this spring.  The winter has\naged him,\" said Anne sadly.  \"I am afraid that he will soon be going to\nseek lost Margaret.  I can't bear to think of it.\"\n\n\"Four Winds won't be the same place when Captain Jim 'sets out to\nsea,'\" agreed Gilbert.\n\nThe following evening he went to the house up the brook.  Anne wandered\ndismally around until his return.\n\n\"Well, what did Leslie say?\" she demanded when he came in.\n\n\"Very little.  I think she felt rather dazed.\"\n\n\"And is she going to have the operation?\"\n\n\"She is going to think it over and decide very soon.\"\n\nGilbert flung himself wearily into the easy chair before the fire.  He\nlooked tired.  It had not been an easy thing for him to tell Leslie.\nAnd the terror that had sprung into her eyes when the meaning of what\nhe told her came home to her was not a pleasant thing to remember.\nNow, when the die was cast, he was beset with doubts of his own wisdom.\n\nAnne looked at him remorsefully; then she slipped down on the rug\nbeside him and laid her glossy red head on his arm.\n\n\"Gilbert, I've been rather hateful over this.  I won't be any more.\nPlease just call me red-headed and forgive me.\"\n\nBy which Gilbert understood that, no matter what came of it, there\nwould be no I-told-you-so's.  But he was not wholly comforted.  Duty in\nthe abstract is one thing; duty in the concrete is quite another,\nespecially when the doer is confronted by a woman's stricken eyes.\n\nSome instinct made Anne keep away from Leslie for the next three days.\nOn the third evening Leslie came down to the little house and told\nGilbert that she had made up her mind; she would take Dick to Montreal\nand have the operation.\n\nShe was very pale and seemed to have wrapped herself in her old mantle\nof aloofness.  But her eyes had lost the look which had haunted\nGilbert; they were cold and bright; and she proceeded to discuss\ndetails with him in a crisp, business-like way.  There were plans to be\nmade and many things to be thought over.  When Leslie had got the\ninformation she wanted she went home.  Anne wanted to walk part of the\nway with her.\n\n\"Better not,\" said Leslie curtly.  \"Today's rain has made the ground\ndamp.  Good-night.\"\n\n\"Have I lost my friend?\" said Anne with a sigh.  \"If the operation is\nsuccessful and Dick Moore finds himself again Leslie will retreat into\nsome remote fastness of her soul where none of us can ever find her.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she will leave him,\" said Gilbert.\n\n\"Leslie would never do that, Gilbert.  Her sense of duty is very\nstrong.  She told me once that her Grandmother West always impressed\nupon her the fact that when she assumed any responsibility she must\nnever shirk it, no matter what the consequences might be.  That is one\nof her cardinal rules.  I suppose it's very old-fashioned.\"\n\n\"Don't be bitter, Anne-girl.  You know you don't think it\nold-fashioned--you know you have the very same idea of sacredness of\nassumed responsibilities yourself.  And you are right.  Shirking\nresponsibilities is the curse of our modern life--the secret of all the\nunrest and discontent that is seething in the world.\"\n\n\"Thus saith the preacher,\" mocked Anne.  But under the mockery she felt\nthat he was right; and she was very sick at heart for Leslie.\n\nA week later Miss Cornelia descended like an avalanche upon the little\nhouse.  Gilbert was away and Anne was compelled to bear the shock of\nthe impact alone.\n\nMiss Cornelia hardly waited to get her hat off before she began.\n\n\"Anne, do you mean to tell me it's true what I've heard--that Dr.\nBlythe has told Leslie Dick can be cured, and that she is going to take\nhim to Montreal to have him operated on?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is quite true, Miss Cornelia,\" said Anne bravely.\n\n\"Well, it's inhuman cruelty, that's what it is,\" said Miss Cornelia,\nviolently agitated.  \"I did think Dr. Blythe was a decent man.  I\ndidn't think he could have been guilty of this.\"\n\n\"Dr. Blythe thought it was his duty to tell Leslie that there was a\nchance for Dick,\" said Anne with spirit, \"and,\" she added, loyalty to\nGilbert getting the better of her, \"I agree with him.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, you don't, dearie,\" said Miss Cornelia.  \"No person with any\nbowels of compassion could.\"\n\n\"Captain Jim does.\"\n\n\"Don't quote that old ninny to me,\" cried Miss Cornelia.  \"And I don't\ncare who agrees with him.  Think--THINK what it means to that poor\nhunted, harried girl.\"\n\n\"We DO think of it.  But Gilbert believes that a doctor should put the\nwelfare of a patient's mind and body before all other considerations.\"\n\n\"That's just like a man.  But I expected better things of you, Anne,\"\nsaid Miss Cornelia, more in sorrow than in wrath; then she proceeded to\nbombard Anne with precisely the same arguments with which the latter\nhad attacked Gilbert; and Anne valiantly defended her husband with the\nweapons he had used for his own protection.  Long was the fray, but\nMiss Cornelia made an end at last.\n\n\"It's an iniquitous shame,\" she declared, almost in tears.  \"That's\njust what it is--an iniquitous shame.  Poor, poor Leslie!\"\n\n\"Don't you think Dick should be considered a little too?\" pleaded Anne.\n\n\"Dick!  Dick Moore!  HE'S happy enough.  He's a better behaved and more\nreputable member of society now than he ever was before.\n\n\"Why, he was a drunkard and perhaps worse.  Are you going to set him\nloose again to roar and to devour?\"\n\n\"He may reform,\" said poor Anne, beset by foe without and traitor\nwithin.\n\n\"Reform your grandmother!\" retorted Miss Cornelia.  \"Dick Moore got the\ninjuries that left him as he is in a drunken brawl.  He DESERVES his\nfate.  It was sent on him for a punishment.  I don't believe the doctor\nhas any business to tamper with the visitations of God.\"\n\n\"Nobody knows how Dick was hurt, Miss Cornelia.  It may not have been\nin a drunken brawl at all.  He may have been waylaid and robbed.\"\n\n\"Pigs MAY whistle, but they've poor mouths for it,\" said Miss Cornelia.\n\"Well, the gist of what you tell me is that the thing is settled and\nthere's no use in talking.  If that's so I'll hold my tongue.  I don't\npropose to wear MY teeth out gnawing files.  When a thing has to be I\ngive in to it.  But I like to make mighty sure first that it HAS to be.\nNow, I'll devote MY energies to comforting and sustaining Leslie.  And\nafter all,\" added Miss Cornelia, brightening up hopefully, \"perhaps\nnothing can be done for Dick.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 31\n\nTHE TRUTH MAKES FREE\n\nLeslie, having once made up her mind what to do, proceeded to do it\nwith characteristic resolution and speed.  House-cleaning must be\nfinished with first, whatever issues of life and death might await\nbeyond.  The gray house up the brook was put into flawless order and\ncleanliness, with Miss Cornelia's ready assistance.  Miss Cornelia,\nhaving said her say to Anne, and later on to Gilbert and Captain\nJim--sparing neither of them, let it be assured--never spoke of the\nmatter to Leslie.  She accepted the fact of Dick's operation, referred\nto it when necessary in a business-like way, and ignored it when it was\nnot.  Leslie never attempted to discuss it.  She was very cold and\nquiet during these beautiful spring days.  She seldom visited Anne, and\nthough she was invariably courteous and friendly, that very courtesy\nwas as an icy barrier between her and the people of the little house.\nThe old jokes and laughter and chumminess of common things could not\nreach her over it.  Anne refused to feel hurt.  She knew that Leslie\nwas in the grip of a hideous dread--a dread that wrapped her away from\nall little glimpses of happiness and hours of pleasure.  When one great\npassion seizes possession of the soul all other feelings are crowded\naside.  Never in all her life had Leslie Moore shuddered away from the\nfuture with more intolerable terror.  But she went forward as\nunswervingly in the path she had elected as the martyrs of old walked\ntheir chosen way, knowing the end of it to be the fiery agony of the\nstake.\n\nThe financial question was settled with greater ease than Anne had\nfeared.  Leslie borrowed the necessary money from Captain Jim, and, at\nher insistence, he took a mortgage on the little farm.\n\n\"So that is one thing off the poor girl's mind,\" Miss Cornelia told\nAnne, \"and off mine too.  Now, if Dick gets well enough to work again\nhe'll be able to earn enough to pay the interest on it; and if he\ndoesn't I know Captain Jim'll manage someway that Leslie won't have to.\nHe said as much to me.  'I'm getting old, Cornelia,' he said, 'and I've\nno chick or child of my own.  Leslie won't take a gift from a living\nman, but mebbe she will from a dead one.'  So it will be all right as\nfar as THAT goes.  I wish everything else might be settled as\nsatisfactorily.  As for that wretch of a Dick, he's been awful these\nlast few days.  The devil was in him, believe ME!  Leslie and I\ncouldn't get on with our work for the tricks he'd play.  He chased all\nher ducks one day around the yard till most of them died.  And not one\nthing would he do for us.  Sometimes, you know, he'll make himself\nquite handy, bringing in pails of water and wood.  But this week if we\nsent him to the well he'd try to climb down into it.  I thought once,\n'If you'd only shoot down there head-first everything would be nicely\nsettled.'\"\n\n\"Oh, Miss Cornelia!\"\n\n\"Now, you needn't Miss Cornelia me, Anne, dearie.  ANYBODY would have\nthought the same.  If the Montreal doctors can make a rational creature\nout of Dick Moore they're wonders.\"\n\nLeslie took Dick to Montreal early in May.  Gilbert went with her, to\nhelp her, and make the necessary arrangements for her.  He came home\nwith the report that the Montreal surgeon whom they had consulted\nagreed with him that there was a good chance of Dick's restoration.\n\n\"Very comforting,\" was Miss Cornelia's sarcastic comment.\n\nAnne only sighed.  Leslie had been very distant at their parting.\n\nBut she had promised to write.  Ten days after Gilbert's return the\nletter came.  Leslie wrote that the operation had been successfully\nperformed and that Dick was making a good recovery.\n\n\"What does she mean by 'successfully?'\" asked Anne.  \"Does she mean\nthat Dick's memory is really restored?\"\n\n\"Not likely--since she says nothing of it,\" said Gilbert.  \"She uses\nthe word 'successfully' from the surgeon's point of view.  The\noperation has been performed and followed by normal results.  But it is\ntoo soon to know whether Dick's faculties will be eventually restored,\nwholly or in part.  His memory would not be likely to return to him all\nat once.  The process will be gradual, if it occurs at all.  Is that\nall she says?\"\n\n\"Yes--there's her letter.  It's very short.  Poor girl, she must be\nunder a terrible strain.  Gilbert Blythe, there are heaps of things I\nlong to say to you, only it would be mean.\"\n\n\"Miss Cornelia says them for you,\" said Gilbert with a rueful smile.\n\"She combs me down every time I encounter her.  She makes it plain to\nme that she regards me as little better than a murderer, and that she\nthinks it a great pity that Dr. Dave ever let me step into his shoes.\nShe even told me that the Methodist doctor over the harbor was to be\npreferred before me.  With Miss Cornelia the force of condemnation can\nno further go.\"\n\n\"If Cornelia Bryant was sick, it would not be Doctor Dave or the\nMethodist doctor she would send for,\" sniffed Susan.  \"She would have\nyou out of your hard-earned bed in the middle of the night, doctor,\ndear, if she took a spell of misery, that she would.  And then she\nwould likely say your bill was past all reason.  But do not mind her,\ndoctor, dear.  It takes all kinds of people to make a world.\"\n\nNo further word came from Leslie for some time.  The May days crept\naway in a sweet succession and the shores of Four Winds Harbor greened\nand bloomed and purpled.  One day in late May Gilbert came home to be\nmet by Susan in the stable yard.\n\n\"I am afraid something has upset Mrs. Doctor, doctor, dear,\" she said\nmysteriously.  \"She got a letter this afternoon and since then she has\njust been walking round the garden and talking to herself.  You know it\nis not good for her to be on her feet so much, doctor, dear.  She did\nnot see fit to tell me what her news was, and I am no pry, doctor,\ndear, and never was, but it is plain something has upset her.  And it\nis not good for her to be upset.\"\n\nGilbert hurried rather anxiously to the garden.  Had anything happened\nat Green Gables?  But Anne, sitting on the rustic seat by the brook,\ndid not look troubled, though she was certainly much excited.  Her eyes\nwere their grayest, and scarlet spots burned on her cheeks.\n\n\"What has happened, Anne?\"\n\nAnne gave a queer little laugh.\n\n\"I think you'll hardly believe it when I tell you, Gilbert.  _I_ can't\nbelieve it yet.  As Susan said the other day, 'I feel like a fly coming\nto live in the sun--dazed-like.'  It's all so incredible.  I've read\nthe letter a score of times and every time it's just the same--I can't\nbelieve my own eyes.  Oh, Gilbert, you were right--so right.  I can see\nthat clearly enough now--and I'm so ashamed of myself--and will you\never really forgive me?\"\n\n\"Anne, I'll shake you if you don't grow coherent.  Redmond would be\nashamed of you.  WHAT has happened?\"\n\n\"You won't believe it--you won't believe it--\"\n\n\"I'm going to phone for Uncle Dave,\" said Gilbert, pretending to start\nfor the house.\n\n\"Sit down, Gilbert.  I'll try to tell you.  I've had a letter, and oh,\nGilbert, it's all so amazing--so incredibly amazing--we never\nthought--not one of us ever dreamed--\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Gilbert, sitting down with a resigned air, \"the only\nthing to do in a case of this kind is to have patience and go at the\nmatter categorically.  Whom is your letter from?\"\n\n\"Leslie--and, oh, Gilbert--\"\n\n\"Leslie!  Whew!  What has she to say?  What's the news about Dick?\"\n\nAnne lifted the letter and held it out, calmly dramatic in a moment.\n\n\"There is NO Dick!  The man we have thought Dick Moore--whom everybody\nin Four Winds has believed for twelve years to be Dick Moore--is his\ncousin, George Moore, of Nova Scotia, who, it seems, always resembled\nhim very strikingly.  Dick Moore died of yellow fever thirteen years\nago in Cuba.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 32\n\nMISS CORNELIA DISCUSSES THE AFFAIR\n\n\"And do you mean to tell me, Anne, dearie, that Dick Moore has turned\nout not to be Dick Moore at all but somebody else?  Is THAT what you\nphoned up to me today?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Cornelia.  It is very amazing, isn't it?\"\n\n\"It's--it's--just like a man,\" said Miss Cornelia helplessly.  She took\noff her hat with trembling fingers.  For once in her life Miss Cornelia\nwas undeniably staggered.\n\n\"I can't seem to sense it, Anne,\" she said.  \"I've heard you say\nit--and I believe you--but I can't take it in.  Dick Moore is dead--has\nbeen dead all these years--and Leslie is free?\"\n\n\"Yes.  The truth has made her free.  Gilbert was right when he said\nthat verse was the grandest in the Bible.\"\n\n\"Tell me everything, Anne, dearie.  Since I got your phone I've been in\na regular muddle, believe ME.  Cornelia Bryant was never so\nkerflummuxed before.\"\n\n\"There isn't a very great deal to tell.  Leslie's letter was short.\nShe didn't go into particulars.  This man--George Moore--has recovered\nhis memory and knows who he is.  He says Dick took yellow fever in\nCuba, and the Four Sisters had to sail without him.  George stayed\nbehind to nurse him.  But he died very shortly afterwards.\n\n\"George did not write Leslie because he intended to come right home and\ntell her himself.\"\n\n\"And why didn't he?\"\n\n\"I suppose his accident must have intervened.  Gilbert says it is quite\nlikely that George Moore remembers nothing of his accident, or what led\nto it, and may never remember it.  It probably happened very soon after\nDick's death.  We may find out more particulars when Leslie writes\nagain.\"\n\n\"Does she say what she is going to do?  When is she coming home?\"\n\n\"She says she will stay with George Moore until he can leave the\nhospital.  She has written to his people in Nova Scotia.  It seems that\nGeorge's only near relative is a married sister much older than\nhimself.  She was living when George sailed on the Four Sisters, but of\ncourse we do not know what may have happened since.  Did you ever see\nGeorge Moore, Miss Cornelia?\"\n\n\"I did.  It is all coming back to me.  He was here visiting his Uncle\nAbner eighteen years ago, when he and Dick would be about seventeen.\nThey were double cousins, you see.  Their fathers were brothers and\ntheir mothers were twin sisters, and they did look a terrible lot\nalike.  Of course,\" added Miss Cornelia scornfully, \"it wasn't one of\nthose freak resemblances you read of in novels where two people are so\nmuch alike that they can fill each other's places and their nearest and\ndearest can't tell between them.  In those days you could tell easy\nenough which was George and which was Dick, if you saw them together\nand near at hand.  Apart, or some distance away, it wasn't so easy.\nThey played lots of tricks on people and thought it great fun, the two\nscamps.  George Moore was a little taller and a good deal fatter than\nDick--though neither of them was what you would call fat--they were\nboth of the lean kind.  Dick had higher color than George, and his hair\nwas a shade lighter.  But their features were just alike, and they both\nhad that queer freak of eyes--one blue and one hazel.  They weren't\nmuch alike in any other way, though.  George was a real nice fellow,\nthough he was a scalawag for mischief, and some said he had a liking\nfor a glass even then.  But everybody liked him better than Dick.  He\nspent about a month here.  Leslie never saw him; she was only about\neight or nine then and I remember now that she spent that whole winter\nover harbor with her grandmother West.  Captain Jim was away, too--that\nwas the winter he was wrecked on the Magdalens.  I don't suppose either\nhe or Leslie had ever heard about the Nova Scotia cousin looking so\nmuch like Dick.  Nobody ever thought of him when Captain Jim brought\nDick--George, I should say--home.  Of course, we all thought Dick had\nchanged considerable--he'd got so lumpish and fat.  But we put that\ndown to what had happened to him, and no doubt that was the reason,\nfor, as I've said, George wasn't fat to begin with either.  And there\nwas no other way we could have guessed, for the man's senses were clean\ngone.  I can't see that it is any wonder we were all deceived.  But\nit's a staggering thing.  And Leslie has sacrificed the best years of\nher life to nursing a man who hadn't any claim on her!  Oh, drat the\nmen!  No matter what they do, it's the wrong thing.  And no matter who\nthey are, it's somebody they shouldn't be.  They do exasperate me.\"\n\n\"Gilbert and Captain Jim are men, and it is through them that the truth\nhas been discovered at last,\" said Anne.\n\n\"Well, I admit that,\" conceded Miss Cornelia reluctantly.  \"I'm sorry I\nraked the doctor off so.  It's the first time in my life I've ever felt\nashamed of anything I said to a man.  I don't know as I shall tell him\nso, though.  He'll just have to take it for granted.  Well, Anne,\ndearie, it's a mercy the Lord doesn't answer all our prayers.  I've\nbeen praying hard right along that the operation wouldn't cure Dick.\nOf course I didn't put it just quite so plain.  But that was what was\nin the back of my mind, and I have no doubt the Lord knew it.\"\n\n\"Well, He has answered the spirit of your prayer.  You really wished\nthat things shouldn't be made any harder for Leslie.  I'm afraid that\nin my secret heart I've been hoping the operation wouldn't succeed, and\nI am wholesomely ashamed of it.\"\n\n\"How does Leslie seem to take it?\"\n\n\"She writes like one dazed.  I think that, like ourselves, she hardly\nrealises it yet.  She says, 'It all seems like a strange dream to me,\nAnne.'  That is the only reference she makes to herself.\"\n\n\"Poor child!  I suppose when the chains are struck off a prisoner he'd\nfeel queer and lost without them for a while.  Anne, dearie, here's a\nthought keeps coming into my mind.  What about Owen Ford?  We both know\nLeslie was fond of him.  Did it ever occur to you that he was fond of\nher?\"\n\n\"It--did--once,\" admitted Anne, feeling that she might say so much.\n\n\"Well, I hadn't any reason to think he was, but it just appeared to me\nhe MUST be.  Now, Anne, dearie, the Lord knows I'm not a match-maker,\nand I scorn all such doings.  But if I were you and writing to that\nFord man I'd just mention, casual-like, what has happened.  That is\nwhat _I_'d do.\"\n\n\"Of course I will mention it when I write him,\" said Anne, a trifle\ndistantly.  Somehow, this was a thing she could not discuss with Miss\nCornelia.  And yet, she had to admit that the same thought had been\nlurking in her mind ever since she had heard of Leslie's freedom.  But\nshe would not desecrate it by free speech.\n\n\"Of course there is no great rush, dearie.  But Dick Moore's been dead\nfor thirteen years and Leslie has wasted enough of her life for him.\nWe'll just see what comes of it.  As for this George Moore, who's gone\nand come back to life when everyone thought he was dead and done for,\njust like a man, I'm real sorry for him.  He won't seem to fit in\nanywhere.\"\n\n\"He is still a young man, and if he recovers completely, as seems\nlikely, he will be able to make a place for himself again.  It must be\nvery strange for him, poor fellow.  I suppose all these years since his\naccident will not exist for him.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 33\n\nLESLIE RETURNS\n\nA fortnight later Leslie Moore came home alone to the old house where\nshe had spent so many bitter years.  In the June twilight she went over\nthe fields to Anne's, and appeared with ghost-like suddenness in the\nscented garden.\n\n\"Leslie!\" cried Anne in amazement.  \"Where have you sprung from?  We\nnever knew you were coming.  Why didn't you write?  We would have met\nyou.\"\n\n\"I couldn't write somehow, Anne.  It seemed so futile to try to say\nanything with pen and ink.  And I wanted to get back quietly and\nunobserved.\"\n\nAnne put her arms about Leslie and kissed her.  Leslie returned the\nkiss warmly.  She looked pale and tired, and she gave a little sigh as\nshe dropped down on the grasses beside a great bed of daffodils that\nwere gleaming through the pale, silvery twilight like golden stars.\n\n\"And you have come home alone, Leslie?\"\n\n\"Yes.  George Moore's sister came to Montreal and took him home with\nher.  Poor fellow, he was sorry to part with me--though I was a\nstranger to him when his memory first came back.  He clung to me in\nthose first hard days when he was trying to realise that Dick's death\nwas not the thing of yesterday that it seemed to him.  It was all very\nhard for him.  I helped him all I could.  When his sister came it was\neasier for him, because it seemed to him only the other day that he had\nseen her last.  Fortunately she had not changed much, and that helped\nhim, too.\"\n\n\"It is all so strange and wonderful, Leslie.  I think we none of us\nrealise it yet.\"\n\n\"I cannot.  When I went into the house over there an hour ago, I felt\nthat it MUST be a dream--that Dick must be there, with his childish\nsmile, as he had been for so long.  Anne, I seem stunned yet. I'm not\nglad or sorry--or ANYTHING.  I feel as if something had been torn\nsuddenly out of my life and left a terrible hole.  I feel as if I\ncouldn't be _I_--as if I must have changed into somebody else and\ncouldn't get used to it.  It gives me a horrible lonely, dazed,\nhelpless feeling.  It's good to see you again--it seems as if you were\na sort of anchor for my drifting soul.  Oh, Anne, I dread it all--the\ngossip and wonderment and questioning.  When I think of that, I wish\nthat I need not have come home at all.  Dr. Dave was at the station\nwhen I came off the train--he brought me home.  Poor old man, he feels\nvery badly because he told me years ago that nothing could be done for\nDick.  'I honestly thought so, Leslie,' he said to me today.  'But I\nshould have told you not to depend on my opinion--I should have told\nyou to go to a specialist.  If I had, you would have been saved many\nbitter years, and poor George Moore many wasted ones.  I blame myself\nvery much, Leslie.'  I told him not to do that--he had done what he\nthought right.  He has always been so kind to me--I couldn't bear to\nsee him worrying over it.\"\n\n\"And Dick--George, I mean?  Is his memory fully restored?\"\n\n\"Practically.  Of course, there are a great many details he can't\nrecall yet--but he remembers more and more every day.  He went out for\na walk on the evening after Dick was buried.  He had Dick's money and\nwatch on him; he meant to bring them home to me, along with my letter.\nHe admits he went to a place where the sailors resorted--and he\nremembers drinking--and nothing else.  Anne, I shall never forget the\nmoment he remembered his own name.  I saw him looking at me with an\nintelligent but puzzled expression.  I said, 'Do you know me, Dick?'\nHe answered, 'I never saw you before.  Who are you?  And my name is not\nDick.  I am George Moore, and Dick died of yellow fever yesterday!\nWhere am I?  What has happened to me?'  I--I fainted, Anne.  And ever\nsince I have felt as if I were in a dream.\"\n\n\"You will soon adjust yourself to this new state of things, Leslie.\nAnd you are young--life is before you--you will have many beautiful\nyears yet.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I shall be able to look at it in that way after a while, Anne.\nJust now I feel too tired and indifferent to think about the future.\nI'm--I'm--Anne, I'm lonely.  I miss Dick.  Isn't it all very strange?\nDo you know, I was really fond of poor Dick--George, I suppose I should\nsay--just as I would have been fond of a helpless child who depended on\nme for everything.  I would never have admitted it--I was really\nashamed of it--because, you see, I had hated and despised Dick so much\nbefore he went away.  When I heard that Captain Jim was bringing him\nhome I expected I would just feel the same to him.  But I never\ndid--although I continued to loathe him as I remembered him before.\nFrom the time he came home I felt only pity--a pity that hurt and wrung\nme.  I supposed then that it was just because his accident had made him\nso helpless and changed.  But now I believe it was because there was\nreally a different personality there.  Carlo knew it, Anne--I know now\nthat Carlo knew it.  I always thought it strange that Carlo shouldn't\nhave known Dick.  Dogs are usually so faithful.  But HE knew it was not\nhis master who had come back, although none of the rest of us did.  I\nhad never seen George Moore, you know.  I remember now that Dick once\nmentioned casually that he had a cousin in Nova Scotia who looked as\nmuch like him as a twin; but the thing had gone out of my memory, and\nin any case I would never have thought it of any importance.  You see,\nit never occurred to me to question Dick's identity.  Any change in him\nseemed to me just the result of the accident.\n\n\"Oh, Anne, that night in April when Gilbert told me he thought Dick\nmight be cured!  I can never forget it.  It seemed to me that I had\nonce been a prisoner in a hideous cage of torture, and then the door\nhad been opened and I could get out.  I was still chained to the cage\nbut I was not in it.  And that night I felt that a merciless hand was\ndrawing me back into the cage--back to a torture even more terrible\nthan it had once been.  I didn't blame Gilbert.  I felt he was right.\nAnd he had been very good--he said that if, in view of the expense and\nuncertainty of the operation, I should decide not to risk it, he would\nnot blame me in the least.  But I knew how I ought to decide--and I\ncouldn't face it.  All night I walked the floor like a mad woman,\ntrying to compel myself to face it.  I couldn't, Anne--I thought I\ncouldn't--and when morning broke I set my teeth and resolved that I\nWOULDN'T.  I would let things remain as they were.  It was very wicked,\nI know.  It would have been just punishment for such wickedness if I\nhad just been left to abide by that decision.  I kept to it all day.\nThat afternoon I had to go up to the Glen to do some shopping.  It was\none of Dick's quiet, drowsy days, so I left him alone.  I was gone a\nlittle longer than I had expected, and he missed me.  He felt lonely.\nAnd when I got home, he ran to meet me just like a child, with such a\npleased smile on his face.  Somehow, Anne, I just gave way then.  That\nsmile on his poor vacant face was more than I could endure.  I felt as\nif I were denying a child the chance to grow and develop.  I knew that\nI must give him his chance, no matter what the consequences might be.\nSo I came over and told Gilbert.  Oh, Anne, you must have thought me\nhateful in those weeks before I went away.  I didn't mean to be--but I\ncouldn't think of anything except what I had to do, and everything and\neverybody about me were like shadows.\"\n\n\"I know--I understood, Leslie.  And now it is all over--your chain is\nbroken--there is no cage.\"\n\n\"There is no cage,\" repeated Leslie absently, plucking at the fringing\ngrasses with her slender, brown hands.  \"But--it doesn't seem as if\nthere were anything else, Anne.  You--you remember what I told you of\nmy folly that night on the sand-bar?  I find one doesn't get over being\na fool very quickly.  Sometimes I think there are people who are fools\nforever.  And to be a fool--of that kind--is almost as bad as being\na--a dog on a chain.\"\n\n\"You will feel very differently after you get over being tired and\nbewildered,\" said Anne, who, knowing a certain thing that Leslie did\nnot know, did not feel herself called upon to waste overmuch sympathy.\n\nLeslie laid her splendid golden head against Anne's knee.\n\n\"Anyhow, I have YOU,\" she said.  \"Life can't be altogether empty with\nsuch a friend.  Anne, pat my head--just as if I were a little\ngirl--MOTHER me a bit--and let me tell you while my stubborn tongue is\nloosed a little just what you and your comradeship have meant to me\nsince that night I met you on the rock shore.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 34\n\nTHE SHIP O'DREAMS COMES TO HARBOR\n\nOne morning, when a windy golden sunrise was billowing over the gulf in\nwaves of light, a certain weary stork flew over the bar of Four Winds\nHarbor on his way from the Land of Evening Stars.  Under his wing was\ntucked a sleepy, starry-eyed, little creature.  The stork was tired,\nand he looked wistfully about him.  He knew he was somewhere near his\ndestination, but he could not yet see it.  The big, white light-house\non the red sandstone cliff had its good points; but no stork possessed\nof any gumption would leave a new, velvet baby there.  An old gray\nhouse, surrounded by willows, in a blossomy brook valley, looked more\npromising, but did not seem quite the thing either.  The staring green\nabode further on was manifestly out of the question.  Then the stork\nbrightened up.  He had caught sight of the very place--a little white\nhouse nestled against a big, whispering firwood, with a spiral of blue\nsmoke winding up from its kitchen chimney--a house which just looked as\nif it were meant for babies.  The stork gave a sigh of satisfaction,\nand softly alighted on the ridge-pole.\n\nHalf an hour later Gilbert ran down the hall and tapped on the\nspare-room door.  A drowsy voice answered him and in a moment Marilla's\npale, scared face peeped out from behind the door.\n\n\"Marilla, Anne has sent me to tell you that a certain young gentleman\nhas arrived here.  He hasn't brought much luggage with him, but he\nevidently means to stay.\"\n\n\"For pity's sake!\" said Marilla blankly.  \"You don't mean to tell me,\nGilbert, that it's all over.  Why wasn't I called?\"\n\n\"Anne wouldn't let us disturb you when there was no need.  Nobody was\ncalled until about two hours ago.  There was no 'passage perilous' this\ntime.\"\n\n\"And--and--Gilbert--will this baby live?\"\n\n\"He certainly will.  He weighs ten pounds and--why, listen to him.\nNothing wrong with his lungs, is there?  The nurse says his hair will\nbe red.  Anne is furious with her, and I'm tickled to death.\"\n\nThat was a wonderful day in the little house of dreams.\n\n\"The best dream of all has come true,\" said Anne, pale and rapturous.\n\"Oh, Marilla, I hardly dare believe it, after that horrible day last\nsummer.  I have had a heartache ever since then--but it is gone now.\"\n\n\"This baby will take Joy's place,\" said Marilla.\n\n\"Oh, no, no, NO, Marilla.  He can't--nothing can ever do that.  He has\nhis own place, my dear, wee man-child.  But little Joy has hers, and\nalways will have it.  If she had lived she would have been over a year\nold.  She would have been toddling around on her tiny feet and lisping\na few words.  I can see her so plainly, Marilla.  Oh, I know now that\nCaptain Jim was right when he said God would manage better than that my\nbaby would seem a stranger to me when I found her Beyond.  I've learned\nTHAT this past year.  I've followed her development day by day and week\nby week--I always shall.  I shall know just how she grows from year to\nyear--and when I meet her again I'll know her--she won't be a stranger.\nOh, Marilla, LOOK at his dear, darling toes!  Isn't it strange they\nshould be so perfect?\"\n\n\"It would be stranger if they weren't,\" said Marilla crisply.  Now that\nall was safely over, Marilla was herself again.\n\n\"Oh, I know--but it seems as if they couldn't be quite FINISHED, you\nknow--and they are, even to the tiny nails.  And his hands--JUST look\nat his hands, Marilla.\"\n\n\"They appear to be a good deal like hands,\" Marilla conceded.\n\n\"See how he clings to my finger.  I'm sure he knows me already.  He\ncries when the nurse takes him away.  Oh, Marilla, do you think--you\ndon't think, do you--that his hair is going to be red?\"\n\n\"I don't see much hair of any color,\" said Marilla.  \"I wouldn't worry\nabout it, if I were you, until it becomes visible.\"\n\n\"Marilla, he HAS hair--look at that fine little down all over his head.\nAnyway, nurse says his eyes will be hazel and his forehead is exactly\nlike Gilbert's.\"\n\n\"And he has the nicest little ears, Mrs. Doctor, dear,\" said Susan.\n\"The first thing I did was to look at his ears.  Hair is deceitful and\nnoses and eyes change, and you cannot tell what is going to come of\nthem, but ears is ears from start to finish, and you always know where\nyou are with them.  Just look at their shape--and they are set right\nback against his precious head.  You will never need to be ashamed of\nhis ears, Mrs. Doctor, dear.\"\n\nAnne's convalescence was rapid and happy.  Folks came and worshipped\nthe baby, as people have bowed before the kingship of the new-born\nsince long before the Wise Men of the East knelt in homage to the Royal\nBabe of the Bethlehem manger.  Leslie, slowly finding herself amid the\nnew conditions of her life, hovered over it, like a beautiful,\ngolden-crowned Madonna.  Miss Cornelia nursed it as knackily as could\nany mother in Israel.  Captain Jim held the small creature in his big\nbrown hands and gazed tenderly at it, with eyes that saw the children\nwho had never been born to him.\n\n\"What are you going to call him?\" asked Miss Cornelia.\n\n\"Anne has settled his name,\" answered Gilbert.\n\n\"James Matthew--after the two finest gentlemen I've ever known--not\neven saving your presence,\" said Anne with a saucy glance at Gilbert.\n\nGilbert smiled.\n\n\"I never knew Matthew very well; he was so shy we boys couldn't get\nacquainted with him--but I quite agree with you that Captain Jim is one\nof the rarest and finest souls God ever clothed in clay.  He is so\ndelighted over the fact that we have given his name to our small lad.\nIt seems he has no other namesake.\"\n\n\"Well, James Matthew is a name that will wear well and not fade in the\nwashing,\" said Miss Cornelia.  \"I'm glad you didn't load him down with\nsome highfalutin, romantic name that he'd be ashamed of when he gets to\nbe a grandfather.  Mrs. William Drew at the Glen has called her baby\nBertie Shakespeare.  Quite a combination, isn't it?  And I'm glad you\nhaven't had much trouble picking on a name.  Some folks have an awful\ntime.  When the Stanley Flaggs' first boy was born there was so much\nrivalry as to who the child should be named for that the poor little\nsoul had to go for two years without a name.  Then a brother came along\nand there it was--'Big Baby' and 'Little Baby.' Finally they called Big\nBaby Peter and Little Baby Isaac, after the two grandfathers, and had\nthem both christened together.  And each tried to see if it couldn't\nhowl the other down.  You know that Highland Scotch family of MacNabs\nback of the Glen?  They've got twelve boys and the oldest and the\nyoungest are both called Neil--Big Neil and Little Neil in the same\nfamily.  Well, I s'pose they ran out of names.\"\n\n\"I have read somewhere,\" laughed Anne, \"that the first child is a poem\nbut the tenth is very prosy prose.  Perhaps Mrs. MacNab thought that\nthe twelfth was merely an old tale re-told.\"\n\n\"Well, there's something to be said for large families,\" said Miss\nCornelia, with a sigh.  \"I was an only child for eight years and I did\nlong for a brother and sister.  Mother told me to pray for one--and\npray I did, believe ME.  Well, one day Aunt Nellie came to me and said,\n'Cornelia, there is a little brother for you upstairs in your ma's\nroom.  You can go up and see him.'  I was so excited and delighted I\njust flew upstairs.  And old Mrs. Flagg lifted up the baby for me to\nsee.  Lord, Anne, dearie, I never was so disappointed in my life.  You\nsee, I'd been praying for A BROTHER TWO YEARS OLDER THAN MYSELF.\"\n\n\"How long did it take you to get over your disappointment?\" asked Anne,\namid her laughter.\n\n\"Well, I had a spite at Providence for a good spell, and for weeks I\nwouldn't even look at the baby.  Nobody knew why, for I never told.\nThen he began to get real cute, and held out his wee hands to me and I\nbegan to get fond of him.  But I didn't get really reconciled to him\nuntil one day a school chum came to see him and said she thought he was\nawful small for his age.  I just got boiling mad, and I sailed right\ninto her, and told her she didn't know a nice baby when she saw one,\nand ours was the nicest baby in the world.  And after that I just\nworshipped him.  Mother died before he was three years old and I was\nsister and mother to him both.  Poor little lad, he was never strong,\nand he died when he wasn't much over twenty.  Seems to me I'd have\ngiven anything on earth, Anne, dearie, if he'd only lived.\"\n\nMiss Cornelia sighed.  Gilbert had gone down and Leslie, who had been\ncrooning over the small James Matthew in the dormer window, laid him\nasleep in his basket and went her way.  As soon as she was safely out\nof earshot, Miss Cornelia bent forward and said in a conspirator's\nwhisper:\n\n\"Anne, dearie, I'd a letter from Owen Ford yesterday.  He's in\nVancouver just now, but he wants to know if I can board him for a month\nlater on.  YOU know what that means.  Well, I hope we're doing right.\"\n\n\"We've nothing to do with it--we couldn't prevent him from coming to\nFour Winds if he wanted to,\" said Anne quickly.  She did not like the\nfeeling of match-making Miss Cornelia's whispers gave her; and then she\nweakly succumbed herself.\n\n\"Don't let Leslie know he is coming until he is here,\" she said.  \"If\nshe found out I feel sure she would go away at once.  She intends to go\nin the fall anyhow--she told me so the other day.  She is going to\nMontreal to take up nursing and make what she can of her life.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, Anne, dearie,\" said Miss Cornelia, nodding sagely \"that is\nall as it may be.  You and I have done our part and we must leave the\nrest to Higher Hands.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 35\n\nPOLITICS AT FOUR WINDS\n\nWhen Anne came downstairs again, the Island, as well as all Canada, was\nin the throes of a campaign preceding a general election.  Gilbert, who\nwas an ardent Conservative, found himself caught in the vortex, being\nmuch in demand for speech-making at the various county rallies.  Miss\nCornelia did not approve of his mixing up in politics and told Anne so.\n\n\"Dr. Dave never did it.  Dr. Blythe will find he is making a mistake,\nbelieve ME.  Politics is something no decent man should meddle with.\"\n\n\"Is the government of the country to be left solely to the rogues\nthen?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"Yes--so long as it's Conservative rogues,\" said Miss Cornelia,\nmarching off with the honors of war.  \"Men and politicians are all\ntarred with the same brush.  The Grits have it laid on thicker than the\nConservatives, that's all--CONSIDERABLY thicker.  But Grit or Tory, my\nadvice to Dr. Blythe is to steer clear of politics.  First thing you\nknow, he'll be running an election himself, and going off to Ottawa for\nhalf the year and leaving his practice to go to the dogs.\"\n\n\"Ah, well, let's not borrow trouble,\" said Anne.  \"The rate of interest\nis too high.  Instead, let's look at Little Jem.  It should be spelled\nwith a G.  Isn't he perfectly beautiful?  Just see the dimples in his\nelbows.  We'll bring him up to be a good Conservative, you and I, Miss\nCornelia.\"\n\n\"Bring him up to be a good man,\" said Miss Cornelia.  \"They're scarce\nand valuable; though, mind you, I wouldn't like to see him a Grit.  As\nfor the election, you and I may be thankful we don't live over harbor.\nThe air there is blue these days.  Every Elliott and Crawford and\nMacAllister is on the warpath, loaded for bear.  This side is peaceful\nand calm, seeing there's so few men.  Captain Jim's a Grit, but it's my\nopinion he's ashamed of it, for he never talks politics.  There isn't\nany earthly doubt that the Conservatives will be returned with a big\nmajority again.\"\n\nMiss Cornelia was mistaken.  On the morning after the election Captain\nJim dropped in at the little house to tell the news.  So virulent is\nthe microbe of party politics, even in a peaceable old man, that\nCaptain Jim's cheeks were flushed and his eyes were flashing with all\nhis old-time fire.\n\n\"Mistress Blythe, the Liberals are in with a sweeping majority.  After\neighteen years of Tory mismanagement this down-trodden country is going\nto have a chance at last.\"\n\n\"I never heard you make such a bitter partisan speech before, Captain\nJim.  I didn't think you had so much political venom in you,\" laughed\nAnne, who was not much excited over the tidings.  Little Jem had said\n\"Wow-ga\" that morning.  What were principalities and powers, the rise\nand fall of dynasties, the overthrow of Grit or Tory, compared with\nthat miraculous occurrence?\n\n\"It's been accumulating for a long while,\" said Captain Jim, with a\ndeprecating smile.  \"I thought I was only a moderate Grit, but when the\nnews came that we were in I found out how Gritty I really was.\"\n\n\"You know the doctor and I are Conservatives.\"\n\n\"Ah, well, it's the only bad thing I know of either of you, Mistress\nBlythe.  Cornelia is a Tory, too.  I called in on my way from the Glen\nto tell her the news.\"\n\n\"Didn't you know you took your life in your hands?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I couldn't resist the temptation.\"\n\n\"How did she take it?\"\n\n\"Comparatively calm, Mistress Blythe, comparatively calm.  She says,\nsays she, 'Well, Providence sends seasons of humiliation to a country,\nsame as to individuals.  You Grits have been cold and hungry for many a\nyear.  Make haste to get warmed and fed, for you won't be in long.'\n'Well, now Cornelia,' I says, 'mebbe Providence thinks Canada needs a\nreal long spell of humiliation.'  Ah, Susan, have YOU heard the news?\nThe Liberals are in.\"\n\nSusan had just come in from the kitchen, attended by the odor of\ndelectable dishes which always seemed to hover around her.\n\n\"Now, are they?\" she said, with beautiful unconcern.  \"Well, I never\ncould see but that my bread rose just as light when Grits were in as\nwhen they were not.  And if any party, Mrs. Doctor, dear, will make it\nrain before the week is out, and save our kitchen garden from entire\nruination, that is the party Susan will vote for.  In the meantime,\nwill you just step out and give me your opinion on the meat for dinner?\nI am fearing that it is very tough, and I think that we had better\nchange our butcher as well as our government.\"\n\nOne evening, a week later, Anne walked down to the Point, to see if she\ncould get some fresh fish from Captain Jim, leaving Little Jem for the\nfirst time.  It was quite a tragedy.  Suppose he cried?  Suppose Susan\ndid not know just exactly what to do for him?  Susan was calm and\nserene.\n\n\"I have had as much experience with him as you, Mrs. Doctor, dear, have\nI not?\"\n\n\"Yes, with him--but not with other babies.  Why, I looked after three\npairs of twins, when I was a child, Susan.  When they cried, I gave\nthem peppermint or castor oil quite coolly.  It's quite curious now to\nrecall how lightly I took all those babies and their woes.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, if Little Jem cries, I will just clap a hot water bag on his\nlittle stomach,\" said Susan.\n\n\"Not too hot, you know,\" said Anne anxiously.  Oh, was it really wise\nto go?\n\n\"Do not you fret, Mrs. Doctor, dear.  Susan is not the woman to burn a\nwee man.  Bless him, he has no notion of crying.\"\n\nAnne tore herself away finally and enjoyed her walk to the Point after\nall, through the long shadows of the sun-setting.  Captain Jim was not\nin the living room of the lighthouse, but another man was--a handsome,\nmiddle-aged man, with a strong, clean-shaven chin, who was unknown to\nAnne.  Nevertheless, when she sat down, he began to talk to her with\nall the assurance of an old acquaintance.  There was nothing amiss in\nwhat he said or the way he said it, but Anne rather resented such a\ncool taking-for-granted in a complete stranger.  Her replies were\nfrosty, and as few as decency required.  Nothing daunted, her companion\ntalked on for several minutes, then excused himself and went away.\nAnne could have sworn there was a twinkle in his eye and it annoyed\nher.  Who was the creature?  There was something vaguely familiar about\nhim but she was certain she had never seen him before.\n\n\"Captain Jim, who was that who just went out?\" she asked, as Captain\nJim came in.\n\n\"Marshall Elliott,\" answered the captain.\n\n\"Marshall Elliott!\" cried Anne.  \"Oh, Captain Jim--it wasn't--yes, it\nWAS his voice--oh, Captain Jim, I didn't know him--and I was quite\ninsulting to him!  WHY didn't he tell me?  He must have seen I didn't\nknow him.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't say a word about it--he'd just enjoy the joke.  Don't\nworry over snubbing him--he'll think it fun.  Yes, Marshall's shaved\noff his beard at last and cut his hair.  His party is in, you know.  I\ndidn't know him myself first time I saw him.  He was up in Carter\nFlagg's store at the Glen the night after election day, along with a\ncrowd of others, waiting for the news.  About twelve the 'phone came\nthrough--the Liberals were in.  Marshall just got up and walked out--he\ndidn't cheer or shout--he left the others to do that, and they nearly\nlifted the roof off Carter's store, I reckon.  Of course, all the\nTories were over in Raymond Russell's store.  Not much cheering THERE.\nMarshall went straight down the street to the side door of Augustus\nPalmer's barber shop.  Augustus was in bed asleep, but Marhall hammered\non the door until he got up and come down, wanting to know what all the\nracket was about.\n\n\"Come into your shop and do the best job you ever did in your life,\nGus,' said Marshall.  'The Liberals are in and you're going to barber a\ngood Grit before the sun rises.'\n\n\"Gus was mad as hops--partly because he'd been dragged out of bed, but\nmore because he's a Tory.  He vowed he wouldn't shave any man after\ntwelve at night.\n\n\"'You'll do what I want you to do, sonny,' said Marshall, 'or I'll jest\nturn you over my knee and give you one of those spankings your mother\nforgot.'\n\n\"He'd have done it, too, and Gus knew it, for Marshall is as strong as\nan ox and Gus is only a midget of a man.  So he gave in and towed\nMarshall in to the shop and went to work.  'Now,' says he, 'I'll barber\nyou up, but if you say one word to me about the Grits getting in while\nI'm doing it I'll cut your throat with this razor,' says he.  You\nwouldn't have thought mild little Gus could be so bloodthirsty, would\nyou?  Shows what party politics will do for a man.  Marshall kept quiet\nand got his hair and beard disposed of and went home.  When his old\nhousekeeper heard him come upstairs she peeked out of her bedroom door\nto see whether 'twas him or the hired boy.  And when she saw a strange\nman striding down the hall with a candle in his hand she screamed blue\nmurder and fainted dead away.  They had to send for the doctor before\nthey could bring her to, and it was several days before she could look\nat Marshall without shaking all over.\"\n\nCaptain Jim had no fish.  He seldom went out in his boat that summer,\nand his long tramping expeditions were over.  He spent a great deal of\nhis time sitting by his seaward window, looking out over the gulf, with\nhis swiftly-whitening head leaning on his hand.  He sat there tonight\nfor many silent minutes, keeping some tryst with the past which Anne\nwould not disturb.  Presently he pointed to the iris of the West:\n\n\"That's beautiful, isn't, it, Mistress Blythe?  But I wish you could\nhave seen the sunrise this morning.  It was a wonderful\nthing--wonderful.  I've seen all kinds of sunrises come over that gulf.\nI've been all over the world, Mistress Blythe, and take it all in all,\nI've never seen a finer sight than a summer sunrise over the gulf.  A\nman can't pick his time for dying, Mistress Blythe--jest got to go when\nthe Great Captain gives His sailing orders.  But if I could I'd go out\nwhen the morning comes across that water.  I've watched it many a time\nand thought what a thing it would be to pass out through that great\nwhite glory to whatever was waiting beyant, on a sea that ain't mapped\nout on any airthly chart.  I think, Mistress Blythe, that I'd find lost\nMargaret there.\"\n\nCaptain Jim had often talked to Anne of lost Margaret since he had told\nher the old story.  His love for her trembled in every tone--that love\nthat had never grown faint or forgetful.\n\n\"Anyway, I hope when my time comes I'll go quick and easy.  I don't\nthink I'm a coward, Mistress Blythe--I've looked an ugly death in the\nface more than once without blenching.  But the thought of a lingering\ndeath does give me a queer, sick feeling of horror.\"\n\n\"Don't talk about leaving us, dear, DEAR Captain, Jim,\" pleaded Anne,\nin a choked voice, patting the old brown hand, once so strong, but now\ngrown very feeble.  \"What would we do without you?\"\n\nCaptain Jim smiled beautifully.\n\n\"Oh, you'd get along nicely--nicely--but you wouldn't forget the old\nman altogether, Mistress Blythe--no, I don't think you'll ever quite\nforget him.  The race of Joseph always remembers one another.  But\nit'll be a memory that won't hurt--I like to think that my memory won't\nhurt my friends--it'll always be kind of pleasant to them, I hope and\nbelieve.  It won't be very long now before lost Margaret calls me, for\nthe last time.  I'll be all ready to answer.  I jest spoke of this\nbecause there's a little favor I want to ask you.  Here's this poor old\nMatey of mine\"--Captain Jim reached out a hand and poked the big, warm,\nvelvety, golden ball on the sofa.  The First Mate uncoiled himself like\na spring with a nice, throaty, comfortable sound, half purr, half meow,\nstretched his paws in air, turned over and coiled himself up again.\n\"HE'll miss me when I start on the V'yage.  I can't bear to think of\nleaving the poor critter to starve, like he was left before.  If\nanything happens to me will you give Matey a bite and a corner,\nMistress Blythe?\"\n\n\"Indeed I will.\"\n\n\"Then that is all I had on my mind.  Your Little Jem is to have the few\ncurious things I picked up--I've seen to that.  And now I don't like to\nsee tears in those pretty eyes, Mistress Blythe.  I'll mebbe hang on\nfor quite a spell yet.  I heard you reading a piece of poetry one day\nlast winter--one of Tennyson's pieces.  I'd sorter like to hear it\nagain, if you could recite it for me.\"\n\nSoftly and clearly, while the seawind blew in on them, Anne repeated\nthe beautiful lines of Tennyson's wonderful swan song--\"Crossing the\nBar.\"  The old captain kept time gently with his sinewy hand.\n\n\"Yes, yes, Mistress Blythe,\" he said, when she had finished, \"that's\nit, that's it.  He wasn't a sailor, you tell me--I dunno how he could\nhave put an old sailor's feelings into words like that, if he wasn't\none.  He didn't want any 'sadness o' farewells' and neither do I,\nMistress Blythe--for all will be well with me and mine beyant the bar.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 36\n\nBEAUTY FOR ASHES\n\n\"Any news from Green Gables, Anne?\"\n\n\"Nothing very especial,\" replied Anne, folding up Marilla's letter.\n\"Jake Donnell has been there shingling the roof.  He is a full-fledged\ncarpenter now, so it seems he has had his own way in regard to the\nchoice of a life-work.  You remember his mother wanted him to be a\ncollege professor.  I shall never forget the day she came to the school\nand rated me for failing to call him St. Clair.\"\n\n\"Does anyone ever call him that now?\"\n\n\"Evidently not.  It seems that he has completely lived it down.  Even\nhis mother has succumbed.  I always thought that a boy with Jake's chin\nand mouth would get his own way in the end.  Diana writes me that Dora\nhas a beau.  Just think of it--that child!\"\n\n\"Dora is seventeen,\" said Gilbert.  \"Charlie Sloane and I were both mad\nabout you when you were seventeen, Anne.\"\n\n\"Really, Gilbert, we must be getting on in years,\" said Anne, with a\nhalf-rueful smile, \"when children who were six when we thought\nourselves grown up are old enough now to have beaux.  Dora's is Ralph\nAndrews--Jane's brother.  I remember him as a little, round, fat,\nwhite-headed fellow who was always at the foot of his class.  But I\nunderstand he is quite a fine-looking young man now.\"\n\n\"Dora will probably marry young.  She's of the same type as Charlotta\nthe Fourth--she'll never miss her first chance for fear she might not\nget another.\"\n\n\"Well; if she marries Ralph I hope he will be a little more\nup-and-coming than his brother Billy,\" mused Anne.\n\n\"For instance,\" said Gilbert, laughing, \"let us hope he will be able to\npropose on his own account.  Anne, would you have married Billy if he\nhad asked you himself, instead of getting Jane to do it for him?\"\n\n\"I might have.\" Anne went off into a shriek of laughter over the\nrecollection of her first proposal.  \"The shock of the whole thing\nmight have hypnotized me into some such rash and foolish act.  Let us\nbe thankful he did it by proxy.\"\n\n\"I had a letter from George Moore yesterday,\" said Leslie, from the\ncorner where she was reading.\n\n\"Oh, how is he?\" asked Anne interestedly, yet with an unreal feeling\nthat she was inquiring about some one whom she did not know.\n\n\"He is well, but he finds it very hard to adapt himself to all the\nchanges in his old home and friends.  He is going to sea again in the\nspring.  It's in his blood, he says, and he longs for it.  But he told\nme something that made me glad for him, poor fellow.  Before he sailed\non the Four Sisters he was engaged to a girl at home.  He did not tell\nme anything about her in Montreal, because he said he supposed she\nwould have forgotten him and married someone else long ago, and with\nhim, you see, his engagement and love was still a thing of the present.\nIt was pretty hard on him, but when he got home he found she had never\nmarried and still cared for him.  They are to be married this fall.\nI'm going to ask him to bring her over here for a little trip; he says\nhe wants to come and see the place where he lived so many years without\nknowing it.\"\n\n\"What a nice little romance,\" said Anne, whose love for the romantic\nwas immortal.  \"And to think,\" she added with a sigh of self-reproach,\n\"that if I had had my way George Moore would never have come up from\nthe grave in which his identity was buried.  How I did fight against\nGilbert's suggestion!  Well, I am punished:  I shall never be able to\nhave a different opinion from Gilbert's again!  If I try to have, he\nwill squelch me by casting George Moore's case up to me!\"\n\n\"As if even that would squelch a woman!\" mocked Gilbert.  \"At least do\nnot become my echo, Anne.  A little opposition gives spice to life.  I\ndo not want a wife like John MacAllister's over the harbor.  No matter\nwhat he says, she at once remarks in that drab, lifeless little voice\nof hers, 'That is very true, John, dear me!'\"\n\nAnne and Leslie laughed.  Anne's laughter was silver and Leslie's\ngolden, and the combination of the two was as satisfactory as a perfect\nchord in music.\n\nSusan, coming in on the heels of the laughter, echoed it with a\nresounding sigh.\n\n\"Why, Susan, what is the matter?\" asked Gilbert.\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with little Jem, is there, Susan?\" cried Anne,\nstarting up in alarm.\n\n\"No, no, calm yourself, Mrs. Doctor, dear.  Something has happened,\nthough.  Dear me, everything has gone catawampus with me this week.  I\nspoiled the bread, as you know too well--and I scorched the doctor's\nbest shirt bosom--and I broke your big platter.  And now, on the top of\nall this, comes word that my sister Matilda has broken her leg and\nwants me to go and stay with her for a spell.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm very sorry--sorry that your sister has met with such an\naccident, I mean,\" exclaimed Anne.\n\n\"Ah, well, man was made to mourn, Mrs. Doctor, dear.  That sounds as if\nit ought to be in the Bible, but they tell me a person named Burns\nwrote it.  And there is no doubt that we are born to trouble as the\nsparks fly upward.  As for Matilda, I do not know what to think of her.\nNone of our family ever broke their legs before.  But whatever she has\ndone she is still my sister, and I feel that it is my duty to go and\nwait on her, if you can spare me for a few weeks, Mrs. Doctor, dear.\"\n\n\"Of course, Susan, of course.  I can get someone to help me while you\nare gone.\"\n\n\"If you cannot I will not go, Mrs. Doctor, dear, Matilda's leg to the\ncontrary notwithstanding.  I will not have you worried, and that\nblessed child upset in consequence, for any number of legs.\"\n\n\"Oh, you must go to your sister at once, Susan.  I can get a girl from\nthe cove, who will do for a time.\"\n\n\"Anne, will you let me come and stay with you while Susan is away?\"\nexclaimed Leslie.  \"Do!  I'd love to--and it would be an act of charity\non your part.  I'm so horribly lonely over there in that big barn of a\nhouse.  There's so little to do--and at night I'm worse than\nlonely--I'm frightened and nervous in spite of locked doors.  There was\na tramp around two days ago.\"\n\nAnne joyfully agreed, and next day Leslie was installed as an inmate of\nthe little house of dreams.  Miss Cornelia warmly approved of the\narrangement.\n\n\"It seems Providential,\" she told Anne in confidence.  \"I'm sorry for\nMatilda Clow, but since she had to break her leg it couldn't have\nhappened at a better time.  Leslie will be here while Owen Ford is in\nFour Winds, and those old cats up at the Glen won't get the chance to\nmeow, as they would if she was living over there alone and Owen going\nto see her.  They are doing enough of it as it is, because she doesn't\nput on mourning.  I said to one of them, 'If you mean she should put on\nmourning for George Moore, it seems to me more like his resurrection\nthan his funeral; and if it's Dick you mean, I confess _I_ can't see\nthe propriety of going into weeds for a man who died thirteen years ago\nand good riddance then!'  And when old Louisa Baldwin remarked to me\nthat she thought it very strange that Leslie should never have\nsuspected it wasn't her own husband _I_ said, 'YOU never suspected it\nwasn't Dick Moore, and you were next-door neighbor to him all his life,\nand by nature you're ten times as suspicious as Leslie.'  But you can't\nstop some people's tongues, Anne, dearie, and I'm real thankful Leslie\nwill be under your roof while Owen is courting her.\"\n\nOwen Ford came to the little house one August evening when Leslie and\nAnne were absorbed in worshipping the baby.  He paused at the open door\nof the living room, unseen by the two within, gazing with greedy eyes\nat the beautiful picture.  Leslie sat on the floor with the baby in her\nlap, making ecstatic dabs at his fat little hands as he fluttered them\nin the air.\n\n\"Oh, you dear, beautiful, beloved baby,\" she mumbled, catching one wee\nhand and covering it with kisses.\n\n\"Isn't him ze darlingest itty sing,\" crooned Anne, hanging over the arm\nof her chair adoringly.  \"Dem itty wee pads are ze very tweetest\nhandies in ze whole big world, isn't dey, you darling itty man.\"\n\nAnne, in the months before Little Jem's coming, had pored diligently\nover several wise volumes, and pinned her faith to one in especial,\n\"Sir Oracle on the Care and Training of Children.\"  Sir Oracle implored\nparents by all they held sacred never to talk \"baby talk\" to their\nchildren.  Infants should invariably be addressed in classical language\nfrom the moment of their birth.  So should they learn to speak English\nundefiled from their earliest utterance.  \"How,\" demanded Sir Oracle,\n\"can a mother reasonably expect her child to learn correct speech, when\nshe continually accustoms its impressionable gray matter to such absurd\nexpressions and distortions of our noble tongue as thoughtless mothers\ninflict every day on the helpless creatures committed to their care?\nCan a child who is constantly called 'tweet itty wee singie' ever\nattain to any proper conception of his own being and possibilities and\ndestiny?\"\n\nAnne was vastly impressed with this, and informed Gilbert that she\nmeant to make it an inflexible rule never, under any circumstances, to\ntalk \"baby talk\" to her children.  Gilbert agreed with her, and they\nmade a solemn compact on the subject--a compact which Anne shamelessly\nviolated the very first moment Little Jem was laid in her arms.  \"Oh,\nthe darling itty wee sing!\" she had exclaimed.  And she had continued\nto violate it ever since.  When Gilbert teased her she laughed Sir\nOracle to scorn.\n\n\"He never had any children of his own, Gilbert--I am positive he hadn't\nor he would never have written such rubbish.  You just can't help\ntalking baby talk to a baby.  It comes natural--and it's RIGHT.  It\nwould be inhuman to talk to those tiny, soft, velvety little creatures\nas we do to great big boys and girls.  Babies want love and cuddling\nand all the sweet baby talk they can get, and Little Jem is going to\nhave it, bless his dear itty heartums.\"\n\n\"But you're the worst I ever heard, Anne,\" protested Gilbert, who, not\nbeing a mother but only a father, was not wholly convinced yet that Sir\nOracle was wrong.  \"I never heard anything like the way you talk to\nthat child.\"\n\n\"Very likely you never did.  Go away--go away.  Didn't I bring up three\npairs of Hammond twins before I was eleven?  You and Sir Oracle are\nnothing but cold-blooded theorists.  Gilbert, JUST look at him!  He's\nsmiling at me--he knows what we're talking about.  And oo dest agwees\nwif evy word muzzer says, don't oo, angel-lover?\"\n\nGilbert put his arm about them.  \"Oh you mothers!\" he said.  \"You\nmothers!  God knew what He was about when He made you.\"\n\nSo Little Jem was talked to and loved and cuddled; and he throve as\nbecame a child of the house of dreams.  Leslie was quite as foolish\nover him as Anne was.  When their work was done and Gilbert was out of\nthe way, they gave themselves over to shameless orgies of love-making\nand ecstasies of adoration, such as that in which Owen Ford had\nsurprised them.\n\nLeslie was the first to become aware of him.  Even in the twilight\nAnne could see the sudden whiteness that swept over her beautiful face,\nblotting out the crimson of lip and cheeks.\n\nOwen came forward, eagerly, blind for a moment to Anne.\n\n\"Leslie!\" he said, holding out his hand.  It was the first time he had\never called her by her name; but the hand Leslie gave him was cold; and\nshe was very quiet all the evening, while Anne and Gilbert and Owen\nlaughed and talked together.  Before his call ended she excused herself\nand went upstairs.  Owen's gay spirits flagged and he went away soon\nafter with a downcast air.\n\nGilbert looked at Anne.\n\n\"Anne, what are you up to?  There's something going on that I don't\nunderstand.  The whole air here tonight has been charged with\nelectricity.  Leslie sits like the muse of tragedy; Owen Ford jokes and\nlaughs on the surface, and watches Leslie with the eyes of his soul.\nYou seem all the time to be bursting with some suppressed excitement.\nOwn up.  What secret have you been keeping from your deceived husband?\"\n\n\"Don't be a goose, Gilbert,\" was Anne's conjugal reply.  \"As for\nLeslie, she is absurd and I'm going up to tell her so.\"\n\nAnne found Leslie at the dormer window of her room.  The little place\nwas filled with the rhythmic thunder of the sea.  Leslie sat with\nlocked hands in the misty moonshine--a beautiful, accusing presence.\n\n\"Anne,\" she said in a low, reproachful voice, \"did you know Owen Ford\nwas coming to Four Winds?\"\n\n\"I did,\" said Anne brazenly.\n\n\"Oh, you should have told me, Anne,\" Leslie cried passionately. \"If I\nhad known I would have gone away--I wouldn't have stayed here to meet\nhim.  You should have told me.  It wasn't fair of you, Anne--oh, it\nwasn't fair!\"\n\nLeslie's lips were trembling and her whole form was tense with emotion.\nBut Anne laughed heartlessly.  She bent over and kissed Leslie's\nupturned reproachful face.\n\n\"Leslie, you are an adorable goose.  Owen Ford didn't rush from the\nPacific to the Atlantic from a burning desire to see ME.  Neither do I\nbelieve that he was inspired by any wild and frenzied passion for Miss\nCornelia.  Take off your tragic airs, my dear friend, and fold them up\nand put them away in lavender.  You'll never need them again.  There\nare some people who can see through a grindstone when there is a hole\nin it, even if you cannot.  I am not a prophetess, but I shall venture\non a prediction.  The bitterness of life is over for you.  After this\nyou are going to have the joys and hopes--and I daresay the sorrows,\ntoo--of a happy woman.  The omen of the shadow of Venus did come true\nfor you, Leslie.  The year in which you saw it brought your life's best\ngift for you--your love for Owen Ford.  Now, go right to bed and have a\ngood sleep.\"\n\nLeslie obeyed orders in so far that she went to bed: but it may be\nquestioned if she slept much.  I do not think she dared to dream\nwakingly; life had been so hard for this poor Leslie, the path on which\nshe had had to walk had been so strait, that she could not whisper to\nher own heart the hopes that might wait on the future.  But she watched\nthe great revolving light bestarring the short hours of the summer\nnight, and her eyes grew soft and bright and young once more.  Nor,\nwhen Owen Ford came next day, to ask her to go with him to the shore,\ndid she say him nay.\n\n\n\n CHAPTER 37\n\nMISS CORNELIA MAKES A STARTLING ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nMiss Cornelia sailed down to the little house one drowsy afternoon,\nwhen the gulf was the faint, bleached blue of the August seas, and the\norange lilies at the gate of Anne's garden held up their imperial cups\nto be filled with the molten gold of August sunshine.  Not that Miss\nCornelia concerned herself with painted oceans or sun-thirsty lilies.\nShe sat in her favorite rocker in unusual idleness.  She sewed not,\nneither did she spin.  Nor did she say a single derogatory word\nconcerning any portion of mankind.  In short, Miss Cornelia's\nconversation was singularly devoid of spice that day, and Gilbert, who\nhad stayed home to listen to her, instead of going a-fishing, as he had\nintended, felt himself aggrieved.  What had come over Miss Cornelia?\nShe did not look cast down or worried.  On the contrary, there was a\ncertain air of nervous exultation about her.\n\n\"Where is Leslie?\" she asked--not as if it mattered much either.\n\n\"Owen and she went raspberrying in the woods back of her farm,\"\nanswered Anne.  \"They won't be back before supper time--if then.\"\n\n\"They don't seem to have any idea that there is such a thing as a\nclock,\" said Gilbert.  \"I can't get to the bottom of that affair.  I'm\ncertain you women pulled strings.  But Anne, undutiful wife, won't tell\nme.  Will you, Miss Cornelia?\"\n\n\"No, I shall not.  But,\" said Miss Cornelia, with the air of one\ndetermined to take the plunge and have it over, \"I will tell you\nsomething else.  I came today on purpose to tell it.  I am going to be\nmarried.\"\n\nAnne and Gilbert were silent.  If Miss Cornelia had announced her\nintention of going out to the channel and drowning herself the thing\nmight have been believable.  This was not.  So they waited.  Of course\nMiss Cornelia had made a mistake.\n\n\"Well, you both look sort of kerflummexed,\" said Miss Cornelia, with a\ntwinkle in her eyes.  Now that the awkward moment of revelation was\nover, Miss Cornelia was her own woman again.  \"Do you think I'm too\nyoung and inexperienced for matrimony?\"\n\n\"You know--it IS rather staggering,\" said Gilbert, trying to gather his\nwits together.  \"I've heard you say a score of times that you wouldn't\nmarry the best man in the world.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to marry the best man in the world,\" retorted Miss\nCornelia.  \"Marshall Elliott is a long way from being the best.\"\n\n\"Are you going to marry Marshall Elliott?\" exclaimed Anne, recovering\nher power of speech under this second shock.\n\n\"Yes.  I could have had him any time these twenty years if I'd lifted\nmy finger.  But do you suppose I was going to walk into church beside a\nperambulating haystack like that?\"\n\n\"I am sure we are very glad--and we wish you all possible happiness,\"\nsaid Anne, very flatly and inadequately, as she felt.  She was not\nprepared for such an occasion.  She had never imagined herself offering\nbetrothal felicitations to Miss Cornelia.\n\n\"Thanks, I knew you would,\" said Miss Cornelia.  \"You are the first of\nmy friends to know it.\"\n\n\"We shall be so sorry to lose you, though, dear Miss Cornelia,\" said\nAnne, beginning to be a little sad and sentimental.\n\n\"Oh, you won't lose me,\" said Miss Cornelia unsentimentally.  \"You\ndon't suppose I would live over harbor with all those MacAllisters and\nElliotts and Crawfords, do you? 'From the conceit of the Elliotts, the\npride of the MacAllisters and the vain-glory of the Crawfords, good\nLord deliver us.'  Marshall is coming to live at my place.  I'm sick\nand tired of hired men.  That Jim Hastings I've got this summer is\npositively the worst of the species.  He would drive anyone to getting\nmarried.  What do you think?  He upset the churn yesterday and spilled\na big churning of cream over the yard.  And not one whit concerned\nabout it was he!  Just gave a foolish laugh and said cream was good for\nthe land.  Wasn't that like a man?  I told him I wasn't in the habit of\nfertilising my back yard with cream.\"\n\n\"Well, I wish you all manner of happiness too, Miss Cornelia,\" said\nGilbert, solemnly; \"but,\" he added, unable to resist the temptation to\ntease Miss Cornelia, despite Anne's imploring eyes, \"I fear your day of\nindependence is done.  As you know, Marshall Elliott is a very\ndetermined man.\"\n\n\"I like a man who can stick to a thing,\" retorted Miss Cornelia.  \"Amos\nGrant, who used to be after me long ago, couldn't.  You never saw such\na weather-vane.  He jumped into the pond to drown himself once and then\nchanged his mind and swum out again.  Wasn't that like a man?  Marshall\nwould have stuck to it and drowned.\"\n\n\"And he has a bit of a temper, they tell me,\" persisted Gilbert.\n\n\"He wouldn't be an Elliott if he hadn't.  I'm thankful he has.  It will\nbe real fun to make him mad.  And you can generally do something with a\ntempery man when it comes to repenting time.  But you can't do anything\nwith a man who just keeps placid and aggravating.\"\n\n\"You know he's a Grit, Miss Cornelia.\"\n\n\"Yes, he IS,\" admitted Miss Cornelia rather sadly.  \"And of course\nthere is no hope of making a Conservative of him.  But at least he is a\nPresbyterian.  So I suppose I shall have to be satisfied with that.\"\n\n\"Would you marry him if he were a Methodist, Miss Cornelia?\"\n\n\"No, I would not.  Politics is for this world, but religion is for\nboth.\"\n\n\"And you may be a 'relict' after all, Miss Cornelia.\"\n\n\"Not I.  Marshall will live me out.  The Elliotts are long-lived, and\nthe Bryants are not.\"\n\n\"When are you to be married?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"In about a month's time.  My wedding dress is to be navy blue silk.\nAnd I want to ask you, Anne, dearie, if you think it would be all right\nto wear a veil with a navy blue dress.  I've always thought I'd like to\nwear a veil if I ever got married.  Marshall says to have it if I want\nto.  Isn't that like a man?\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't you wear it if you want to?\" asked Anne.\n\n\"Well, one doesn't want to be different from other people,\" said Miss\nCornelia, who was not noticeably like anyone else on the face of the\nearth.  \"As I say, I do fancy a veil.  But maybe it shouldn't be worn\nwith any dress but a white one.  Please tell me, Anne, dearie, what you\nreally think.  I'll go by your advice.\"\n\n\"I don't think veils are usually worn with any but white dresses,\"\nadmitted Anne, \"but that is merely a convention; and I am like Mr.\nElliott, Miss Cornelia.  I don't see any good reason why you shouldn't\nhave a veil if you want one.\"\n\nBut Miss Cornelia, who made her calls in calico wrappers, shook her\nhead.\n\n\"If it isn't the proper thing I won't wear it,\" she said, with a sigh\nof regret for a lost dream.\n\n\"Since you are determined to be married, Miss Cornelia,\" said Gilbert\nsolemnly, \"I shall give you the excellent rules for the management of a\nhusband which my grandmother gave my mother when she married my father.\"\n\n\"Well, I reckon I can manage Marshall Elliott,\" said Miss Cornelia\nplacidly.  \"But let us hear your rules.\"\n\n\"The first one is, catch him.\"\n\n\"He's caught.  Go on.\"\n\n\"The second one is, feed him well.\"\n\n\"With enough pie.  What next?\"\n\n\"The third and fourth are--keep your eye on him.\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" said Miss Cornelia emphatically.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 38\n\nRED ROSES\n\nThe garden of the little house was a haunt beloved of bees and reddened\nby late roses that August.  The little house folk lived much in it, and\nwere given to taking picnic suppers in the grassy corner beyond the\nbrook and sitting about in it through the twilights when great night\nmoths sailed athwart the velvet gloom.  One evening Owen Ford found\nLeslie alone in it.  Anne and Gilbert were away, and Susan, who was\nexpected back that night, had not yet returned.\n\nThe northern sky was amber and pale green over the fir tops.  The air\nwas cool, for August was nearing September, and Leslie wore a crimson\nscarf over her white dress.  Together they wandered through the little,\nfriendly, flower-crowded paths in silence.  Owen must go soon.  His\nholiday was nearly over.  Leslie found her heart beating wildly.  She\nknew that this beloved garden was to be the scene of the binding words\nthat must seal their as yet unworded understanding.\n\n\"Some evenings a strange odor blows down the air of this garden, like a\nphantom perfume,\" said Owen.  \"I have never been able to discover from\njust what flower it comes.  It is elusive and haunting and wonderfully\nsweet.  I like to fancy it is the soul of Grandmother Selwyn passing on\na little visit to the old spot she loved so well.  There should be a\nlot of friendly ghosts about this little old house.\"\n\n\"I have lived under its roof only a month,\" said Leslie, \"but I love it\nas I never loved the house over there where I have lived all my life.\"\n\n\"This house was builded and consecrated by love,\" said Owen.  \"Such\nhouses, MUST exert an influence over those who live in them.  And this\ngarden--it is over sixty years old and the history of a thousand hopes\nand joys is written in its blossoms.  Some of those flowers were\nactually set out by the schoolmaster's bride, and she has been dead for\nthirty years.  Yet they bloom on every summer.  Look at those red\nroses, Leslie--how they queen it over everything else!\"\n\n\"I love the red roses,\" said Leslie.  \"Anne likes the pink ones best,\nand Gilbert likes the white.  But I want the crimson ones.  They\nsatisfy some craving in me as no other flower does.\"\n\n\"These roses are very late--they bloom after all the others have\ngone--and they hold all the warmth and soul of the summer come to\nfruition,\" said Owen, plucking some of the glowing, half-opened buds.\n\n\"The rose is the flower of love--the world has acclaimed it so for\ncenturies.  The pink roses are love hopeful and expectant--the white\nroses are love dead or forsaken--but the red roses--ah, Leslie, what\nare the red roses?\"\n\n\"Love triumphant,\" said Leslie in a low voice.\n\n\"Yes--love triumphant and perfect.  Leslie, you know--you understand.\nI have loved you from the first.  And I KNOW you love me--I don't need\nto ask you.  But I want to hear you say it--my darling--my darling!\"\n\nLeslie said something in a very low and tremulous voice.  Their hands\nand lips met; it was life's supreme moment for them and as they stood\nthere in the old garden, with its many years of love and delight and\nsorrow and glory, he crowned her shining hair with the red, red rose of\na love triumphant.\n\nAnne and Gilbert returned presently, accompanied by Captain Jim.  Anne\nlighted a few sticks of driftwood in the fireplace, for love of the\npixy flames, and they sat around it for an hour of good fellowship.\n\n\"When I sit looking at a driftwood fire it's easy to believe I'm young\nagain,\" said Captain Jim.\n\n\"Can you read futures in the fire, Captain Jim?\" asked Owen.\n\nCaptain Jim looked at them all affectionately and then back again at\nLeslie's vivid face and glowing eyes.\n\n\"I don't need the fire to read your futures,\" he said.  \"I see\nhappiness for all of you--all of you--for Leslie and Mr. Ford--and the\ndoctor here and Mistress Blythe--and Little Jem--and children that\nain't born yet but will be.  Happiness for you all--though, mind you, I\nreckon you'll have your troubles and worries and sorrows, too.  They're\nbound to come--and no house, whether it's a palace or a little house of\ndreams, can bar 'em out.  But they won't get the better of you if you\nface 'em TOGETHER with love and trust.  You can weather any storm with\nthem two for compass and pilot.\"\n\nThe old man rose suddenly and placed one hand on Leslie's head and one\non Anne's.\n\n\"Two good, sweet women,\" he said.  \"True and faithful and to be\ndepended on.  Your husbands will have honor in the gates because of\nyou--your children will rise up and call you blessed in the years to\ncome.\"\n\nThere was a strange solemnity about the little scene.  Anne and Leslie\nbowed as those receiving a benediction.  Gilbert suddenly brushed his\nhand over his eyes; Owen Ford was rapt as one who can see visions.  All\nwere silent for a space.  The little house of dreams added another\npoignant and unforgettable moment to its store of memories.\n\n\"I must be going now,\" said Captain Jim slowly at last.  He took up his\nhat and looked lingeringly about the room.\n\n\"Good night, all of you,\" he said, as he went out.\n\nAnne, pierced by the unusual wistfulness of his farewell, ran to the\ndoor after him.\n\n\"Come back soon, Captain Jim,\" she called, as he passed through the\nlittle gate hung between the firs.\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" he called cheerily back to her.  But Captain Jim had sat by\nthe old fireside of the house of dreams for the last time.\n\nAnne went slowly back to the others.\n\n\"It's so--so pitiful to think of him going all alone down to that\nlonely Point,\" she said.  \"And there is no one to welcome him there.\"\n\n\"Captain Jim is such good company for others that one can't imagine him\nbeing anything but good company for himself,\" said Owen.  \"But he must\noften be lonely.  There was a touch of the seer about him tonight--he\nspoke as one to whom it had been given to speak.  Well, I must be\ngoing, too.\"\n\nAnne and Gilbert discreetly melted away; but when Owen had gone Anne\nreturned, to find Leslie standing by the hearth.\n\n\"Oh, Leslie--I know--and I'm so glad, dear,\" she said, putting her arms\nabout her.\n\n\"Anne, my happiness frightens me,\" whispered Leslie.  \"It seems too\ngreat to be real--I'm afraid to speak of it--to think of it.  It seems\nto me that it must just be another dream of this house of dreams and it\nwill vanish when I leave here.\"\n\n\"Well, you are not going to leave here--until Owen takes you.  You are\ngoing to stay with me until that times comes.  Do you think I'd let you\ngo over to that lonely, sad place again?\"\n\n\"Thank you, dear.  I meant to ask you if I might stay with you.  I\ndidn't want to go back there--it would seem like going back into the\nchill and dreariness of the old life again.  Anne, Anne, what a friend\nyou've been to me--'a good, sweet woman--true and faithful and to be\ndepended on'--Captain Jim summed you up.\"\n\n\"He said 'women,' not 'woman,'\" smiled Anne.  \"Perhaps Captain Jim sees\nus both through the rose-colored spectacles of his love for us.  But we\ncan try to live up to his belief in us, at least.\"\n\n\"Do you remember, Anne,\" said Leslie slowly, \"that I once said--that\nnight we met on the shore--that I hated my good looks?  I did--then.\nIt always seemed to me that if I had been homely Dick would never have\nthought of me.  I hated my beauty because it had attracted him, but\nnow--oh, I'm glad that I have it.  It's all I have to offer Owen,--his\nartist soul delights in it.  I feel as if I do not come to him quite\nempty-handed.\"\n\n\"Owen loves your beauty, Leslie.  Who would not?  But it's foolish of\nyou to say or think that that is all you bring him.  HE will tell you\nthat--I needn't.  And now I must lock up.  I expected Susan back\ntonight, but she has not come.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, here I am, Mrs. Doctor, dear,\" said Susan, entering\nunexpectedly from the kitchen, \"and puffing like a hen drawing rails at\nthat!  It's quite a walk from the Glen down here.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to see you back, Susan.  How is your sister?\"\n\n\"She is able to sit up, but of course she cannot walk yet.  However,\nshe is very well able to get on without me now, for her daughter has\ncome home for her vacation.  And I am thankful to be back, Mrs. Doctor,\ndear.  Matilda's leg was broken and no mistake, but her tongue was not.\nShe would talk the legs off an iron pot, that she would, Mrs. Doctor,\ndear, though I grieve to say it of my own sister.  She was always a\ngreat talker and yet she was the first of our family to get married.\nShe really did not care much about marrying James Clow, but she could\nnot bear to disoblige him.  Not but what James is a good man--the only\nfault I have to find with him is that he always starts in to say grace\nwith such an unearthly groan, Mrs. Doctor, dear.  It always frightens\nmy appetite clear away.  And speaking of getting married, Mrs. Doctor,\ndear, is it true that Cornelia Bryant is going to be married to\nMarshall Elliott?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite true, Susan.\"\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Doctor, dear, it does NOT seem to me fair.  Here is me, who\nnever said a word against the men, and I cannot get married nohow.  And\nthere is Cornelia Bryant, who is never done abusing them, and all she\nhas to do is to reach out her hand and pick one up, as it were.  It is\na very strange world, Mrs. Doctor, dear.\"\n\n\"There's another world, you know, Susan.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Susan with a heavy sigh, \"but, Mrs. Doctor, dear, there is\nneither marrying nor giving in marriage there.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 39\n\nCAPTAIN JIM CROSSES THE BAR\n\nOne day in late September Owen Ford's book came at last.  Captain Jim\nhad gone faithfully to the Glen post office every day for a month,\nexpecting it.  This day he had not gone, and Leslie brought his copy\nhome with hers and Anne's.\n\n\"We'll take it down to him this evening,\" said Anne, excited as a\nschoolgirl.\n\nThe long walk to the Point on that clear, beguiling evening along the\nred harbor road was very pleasant.  Then the sun dropped down behind\nthe western hills into some valley that must have been full of lost\nsunsets, and at the same instant the big light flashed out on the white\ntower of the point.\n\n\"Captain Jim is never late by the fraction of a second,\" said Leslie.\n\nNeither Anne nor Leslie ever forgot Captain Jim's face when they gave\nhim the book--HIS book, transfigured and glorified.  The cheeks that\nhad been blanched of late suddenly flamed with the color of boyhood;\nhis eyes glowed with all the fire of youth; but his hands trembled as\nhe opened it.\n\nIt was called simply The Life-Book of Captain Jim, and on the title\npage the names of Owen Ford and James Boyd were printed as\ncollaborators.  The frontispiece was a photograph of Captain Jim\nhimself, standing at the door of the lighthouse, looking across the\ngulf.  Owen Ford had \"snapped\" him one day while the book was being\nwritten.  Captain Jim had known this, but he had not known that the\npicture was to be in the book.\n\n\"Just think of it,\" he said, \"the old sailor right there in a real\nprinted book.  This is the proudest day of my life.  I'm like to bust,\ngirls.  There'll be no sleep for me tonight.  I'll read my book clean\nthrough before sun-up.\"\n\n\"We'll go right away and leave you free to begin it,\" said Anne.\n\nCaptain Jim had been handling the book in a kind of reverent rapture.\nNow he decidedly closed it and laid it aside.\n\n\"No, no, you're not going away before you take a cup of tea with the\nold man,\" he protested.  \"I couldn't hear to that--could you, Matey?\nThe life-book will keep, I reckon.  I've waited for it this many a\nyear.  I can wait a little longer while I'm enjoying my friends.\"\n\nCaptain Jim moved about getting his kettle on to boil, and setting out\nhis bread and butter.  Despite his excitement he did not move with his\nold briskness.  His movements were slow and halting.  But the girls did\nnot offer to help him.  They knew it would hurt his feelings.\n\n\"You just picked the right evening to visit me,\" he said, producing a\ncake from his cupboard.  \"Leetle Joe's mother sent me down a big basket\nfull of cakes and pies today.  A blessing on all good cooks, says I.\nLook at this purty cake, all frosting and nuts.  'Tain't often I can\nentertain in such style.  Set in, girls, set in!  We'll 'tak a cup o'\nkindness yet for auld lang syne.'\"\n\nThe girls \"set in\" right merrily.  The tea was up to Captain Jim's best\nbrewing.  Little Joe's mother's cake was the last word in cakes;\nCaptain Jim was the prince of gracious hosts, never even permitting his\neyes to wander to the corner where the life-book lay, in all its\nbravery of green and gold.  But when his door finally closed behind\nAnne and Leslie they knew that he went straight to it, and as they\nwalked home they pictured the delight of the old man poring over the\nprinted pages wherein his own life was portrayed with all the charm and\ncolor of reality itself.\n\n\"I wonder how he will like the ending--the ending I suggested,\" said\nLeslie.\n\nShe was never to know.  Early the next morning Anne awakened to find\nGilbert bending over her, fully dressed, and with an expression of\nanxiety on his face.\n\n\"Are you called out?\" she asked drowsily.\n\n\"No.  Anne, I'm afraid there's something wrong at the Point.  It's an\nhour after sunrise now, and the light is still burning.  You know it\nhas always been a matter of pride with Captain Jim to start the light\nthe moment the sun sets, and put it out the moment it rises.\"\n\nAnne sat up in dismay.  Through her window she saw the light blinking\npalely against the blue skies of dawn.\n\n\"Perhaps he has fallen asleep over his life-book,\" she said anxiously,\n\"or become so absorbed in it that he has forgotten the light.\"\n\nGilbert shook his head.\n\n\"That wouldn't be like Captain Jim.  Anyway, I'm going down to see.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute and I'll go with you,\" exclaimed Anne.  \"Oh, yes, I\nmust--Little Jem will sleep for an hour yet, and I'll call Susan.  You\nmay need a woman's help if Captain Jim is ill.\"\n\nIt was an exquisite morning, full of tints and sounds at once ripe and\ndelicate.  The harbor was sparkling and dimpling like a girl; white\ngulls were soaring over the dunes; beyond the bar was a shining,\nwonderful sea.  The long fields by the shore were dewy and fresh in\nthat first fine, purely-tinted light.  The wind came dancing and\nwhistling up the channel to replace the beautiful silence with a music\nmore beautiful still.  Had it not been for the baleful star on the\nwhite tower that early walk would have been a delight to Anne and\nGilbert.  But they went softly with fear.\n\nTheir knock was not responded to.  Gilbert opened the door and they\nwent in.\n\nThe old room was very quiet.  On the table were the remnants of the\nlittle evening feast.  The lamp still burned on the corner stand.  The\nFirst Mate was asleep in a square of sunshine by the sofa.\n\nCaptain Jim lay on the sofa, with his hands clasped over the life-book,\nopen at the last page, lying on his breast.  His eyes were closed and\non his face was a look of the most perfect peace and happiness--the\nlook of one who has long sought and found at last.\n\n\"He is asleep?\" whispered Anne tremulously.\n\nGilbert went to the sofa and bent over him for a few moments.  Then he\nstraightened up.\n\n\"Yes, he sleeps--well,\" he added quietly.  \"Anne, Captain Jim has\ncrossed the bar.\"\n\nThey could not know precisely at what hour he had died, but Anne always\nbelieved that he had had his wish, and went out when the morning came\nacross the gulf.  Out on that shining tide his spirit drifted, over the\nsunrise sea of pearl and silver, to the haven where lost Margaret\nwaited, beyond the storms and calms.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 40\n\nFAREWELL TO THE HOUSE OF DREAMS\n\nCaptain Jim was buried in the little over-harbor graveyard, very near\nto the spot where the wee white lady slept.  His relatives put up a\nvery expensive, very ugly \"monument\"--a monument at which he would have\npoked sly fun had he seen it in life.  But his real monument was in the\nhearts of those who knew him, and in the book that was to live for\ngenerations.\n\nLeslie mourned that Captain Jim had not lived to see the amazing\nsuccess of it.\n\n\"How he would have delighted in the reviews--they are almost all so\nkindly.  And to have seen his life-book heading the lists of the best\nsellers--oh, if he could just have lived to see it, Anne!\"\n\nBut Anne, despite her grief, was wiser.\n\n\"It was the book itself he cared for, Leslie--not what might be said of\nit--and he had it.  He had read it all through.  That last night must\nhave been one of the greatest happiness for him--with the quick,\npainless ending he had hoped for in the morning.  I am glad for Owen's\nsake and yours that the book is such a success--but Captain Jim was\nsatisfied--I KNOW.\"\n\nThe lighthouse star still kept a nightly vigil; a substitute keeper had\nbeen sent to the Point, until such time as an all-wise government could\ndecide which of many applicants was best fitted for the place--or had\nthe strongest pull.  The First Mate was at home in the little house,\nbeloved by Anne and Gilbert and Leslie, and tolerated by a Susan who\nhad small liking for cats.\n\n\"I can put up with him for the sake of Captain Jim, Mrs. Doctor, dear,\nfor I liked the old man.  And I will see that he gets bite and sup, and\nevery mouse the traps account for.  But do not ask me to do more than\nthat, Mrs. Doctor, dear.  Cats is cats, and take my word for it, they\nwill never be anything else.  And at least, Mrs. Doctor, dear, do keep\nhim away from the blessed wee man.  Picture to yourself how awful it\nwould be if he was to suck the darling's breath.\"\n\n\"That might be fitly called a CAT-astrophe,\" said Gilbert.\n\n\"Oh, you may laugh, doctor, dear, but it would be no laughing matter.\"\n\n\"Cats never suck babies' breaths,\" said Gilbert.  \"That is only an old\nsuperstition, Susan.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, it may be a superstition or it may not, doctor, dear.  All\nthat I know is, it has happened.  My sister's husband's nephew's wife's\ncat sucked their baby's breath, and the poor innocent was all but gone\nwhen they found it.  And superstition or not, if I find that yellow\nbeast lurking near our baby I will whack him with the poker, Mrs.\nDoctor, dear.\"\n\nMr. and Mrs. Marshall Elliott were living comfortably and harmoniously\nin the green house.  Leslie was busy with sewing, for she and Owen were\nto be married at Christmas.  Anne wondered what she would do when\nLeslie was gone.\n\n\"Changes come all the time.  Just as soon as things get really nice\nthey change,\" she said with a sigh.\n\n\"The old Morgan place up at the Glen is for sale,\" said Gilbert,\napropos of nothing in especial.\n\n\"Is it?\" asked Anne indifferently.\n\n\"Yes.  Now that Mr. Morgan has gone, Mrs. Morgan wants to go to live\nwith her children in Vancouver.  She will sell cheaply, for a big place\nlike that in a small village like the Glen will not be very easy to\ndispose of.\"\n\n\"Well, it's certainly a beautiful place, so it is likely she will find\na purchaser,\" said Anne, absently, wondering whether she should\nhemstitch or feather-stitch little Jem's \"short\" dresses.  He was to be\nshortened the next week, and Anne felt ready to cry at the thought of\nit.\n\n\"Suppose we buy it, Anne?\" remarked Gilbert quietly.\n\nAnne dropped her sewing and stared at him.\n\n\"You're not in earnest, Gilbert?\"\n\n\"Indeed I am, dear.\"\n\n\"And leave this darling spot--our house of dreams?\" said Anne\nincredulously.  \"Oh, Gilbert, it's--it's unthinkable!\"\n\n\"Listen patiently to me, dear.  I know just how you feel about it.  I\nfeel the same.  But we've always known we would have to move some day.\"\n\n\"Oh, but not so soon, Gilbert--not just yet.\"\n\n\"We may never get such a chance again.  If we don't buy the Morgan\nplace someone else will--and there is no other house in the Glen we\nwould care to have, and no other really good site on which to build.\nThis little house is--well, it is and has been what no other house can\never be to us, I admit, but you know it is out-of-the-way down here for\na doctor.  We have felt the inconvenience, though we've made the best\nof it.  And it's a tight fit for us now.  Perhaps, in a few years, when\nJem wants a room of his own, it will be entirely too small.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know--I know,\" said Anne, tears filling her eyes.  \"I know all\nthat can be said against it, but I love it so--and it's so beautiful\nhere.\"\n\n\"You would find it very lonely here after Leslie goes--and Captain Jim\nhas gone too.  The Morgan place is beautiful, and in time we would love\nit.  You know you have always admired it, Anne.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, but--but--this has all seemed to come up so suddenly,\nGilbert.  I'm dizzy.  Ten minutes ago I had no thought of leaving this\ndear spot.  I was planning what I meant to do for it in the\nspring--what I meant to do in the garden.  And if we leave this place\nwho will get it?  It IS out-of-the-way, so it's likely some poor,\nshiftless, wandering family will rent it--and over-run it--and oh, that\nwould be desecration.  It would hurt me horribly.\"\n\n\"I know.  But we cannot sacrifice our own interests to such\nconsiderations, Anne-girl.  The Morgan place will suit us in every\nessential particular--we really can't afford to miss such a chance.\nThink of that big lawn with those magnificent old trees; and of that\nsplendid hardwood grove behind it--twelve acres of it.  What a play\nplace for our children!  There's a fine orchard, too, and you've always\nadmired that high brick wall around the garden with the door in\nit--you've thought it was so like a story-book garden.  And there is\nalmost as fine a view of the harbor and the dunes from the Morgan place\nas from here.\"\n\n\"You can't see the lighthouse star from it.\"\n\n\"Yes, You can see it from the attic window.  THERE'S another advantage,\nAnne-girl--you love big garrets.\"\n\n \"There's no brook in the garden.\"\n\n\"Well, no, but there is one running through the maple grove into the\nGlen pond.  And the pond itself isn't far away.  You'll be able to\nfancy you have your own Lake of Shining Waters again.\"\n\n\"Well, don't say anything more about it just now, Gilbert.  Give me\ntime to think--to get used to the idea.\"\n\n\"All right.  There is no great hurry, of course.  Only--if we decide to\nbuy, it would be well to be moved in and settled before winter.\"\n\nGilbert went out, and Anne put away Little Jem's short dresses with\ntrembling hands.  She could not sew any more that day.  With tear-wet\neyes she wandered over the little domain where she had reigned so happy\na queen.  The Morgan place was all that Gilbert claimed.  The grounds\nwere beautiful, the house old enough to have dignity and repose and\ntraditions, and new enough to be comfortable and up-to-date.  Anne had\nalways admired it; but admiring is not loving; and she loved this house\nof dreams so much.  She loved EVERYTHING about it--the garden she had\ntended, and which so many women had tended before her--the gleam and\nsparkle of the little brook that crept so roguishly across the\ncorner--the gate between the creaking fir trees--the old red sandstone\nstep--the stately Lombardies--the two tiny quaint glass cupboards over\nthe chimney-piece in the living-room--the crooked pantry door in the\nkitchen--the two funny dormer windows upstairs--the little jog in the\nstaircase--why, these things were a part of her!  How could she leave\nthem?\n\nAnd how this little house, consecrated aforetime by love and joy, had\nbeen re-consecrated for her by her happiness and sorrow!  Here she had\nspent her bridal moon; here wee Joyce had lived her one brief day; here\nthe sweetness of motherhood had come again with Little Jem; here she\nhad heard the exquisite music of her baby's cooing laughter; here\nbeloved friends had sat by her fireside.  Joy and grief, birth and\ndeath, had made sacred forever this little house of dreams.\n\nAnd now she must leave it.  She knew that, even while she had contended\nagainst the idea to Gilbert.  The little house was outgrown.  Gilbert's\ninterests made the change necessary; his work, successful though it had\nbeen, was hampered by his location.  Anne realised that the end of\ntheir life in this dear place drew nigh, and that she must face the\nfact bravely.  But how her heart ached!\n\n\"It will be just like tearing something out of my life,\" she sobbed.\n\"And oh, if I could hope that some nice folk would come here in our\nplace--or even that it would be left vacant.  That itself would be\nbetter than having it overrun with some horde who know nothing of the\ngeography of dreamland, and nothing of the history that has given this\nhouse its soul and its identity.  And if such a tribe come here the\nplace will go to rack and ruin in no time--an old place goes down so\nquickly if it is not carefully attended to.  They'll tear up my\ngarden--and let the Lombardies get ragged--and the paling will come to\nlook like a mouth with half the teeth missing--and the roof will\nleak--and the plaster fall--and they'll stuff pillows and rags in\nbroken window panes--and everything will be out-at-elbows.\"\n\nAnne's imagination pictured forth so vividly the coming degeneration of\nher dear little house that it hurt her as severely as if it had already\nbeen an accomplished fact.  She sat down on the stairs and had a long,\nbitter cry.  Susan found her there and enquired with much concern what\nthe trouble was.\n\n\"You have not quarrelled with the doctor, have you now, Mrs. Doctor,\ndear?  But if you have, do not worry.  It is a thing quite likely to\nhappen to married couples, I am told, although I have had no experience\nthat way myself.  He will be sorry, and you can soon make it up.\"\n\n\"No, no, Susan, we haven't quarrelled.  It's only--Gilbert is going to\nbuy the Morgan place, and we'll have to go and live at the Glen.  And\nit will break my heart.\"\n\nSusan did not enter into Anne's feelings at all.  She was, indeed,\nquite rejoiced over the prospect of living at the Glen.  Her one\ngrievance against her place in the little house was its lonesome\nlocation.\n\n\"Why, Mrs. Doctor, dear, it will be splendid.  The Morgan house is such\na fine, big one.\"\n\n\"I hate big houses,\" sobbed Anne.\n\n\"Oh, well, you will not hate them by the time you have half a dozen\nchildren,\" remarked Susan calmly.  \"And this house is too small already\nfor us.  We have no spare room, since Mrs. Moore is here, and that\npantry is the most aggravating place I ever tried to work in.  There is\na corner every way you turn.  Besides, it is out-of-the-world down\nhere.  There is really nothing at all but scenery.\"\n\n\"Out of your world perhaps, Susan--but not out of mine,\" said Anne with\na faint smile.\n\n\"I do not quite understand you, Mrs. Doctor, dear, but of course I am\nnot well educated.  But if Dr. Blythe buys the Morgan place he will\nmake no mistake, and that you may tie to.  They have water in it, and\nthe pantries and closets are beautiful, and there is not another such\ncellar in P. E.  Island, so I have been told.  Why, the cellar here,\nMrs. Doctor, dear, has been a heart-break to me, as well you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, go away, Susan, go away,\" said Anne forlornly.  \"Cellars and\npantries and closets don't make a HOME.  Why don't you weep with those\nwho weep?\"\n\n\"Well, I never was much hand for weeping, Mrs. Doctor, dear.  I would\nrather fall to and cheer people up than weep with them.  Now, do not\nyou cry and spoil your pretty eyes.  This house is very well and has\nserved your turn, but it is high time you had a better.\"\n\nSusan's point of view seemed to be that of most people.  Leslie was the\nonly one who sympathised understandingly with Anne.  She had a good\ncry, too, when she heard the news.  Then they both dried their tears\nand went to work at the preparations for moving.\n\n\"Since we must go let us go as soon as we can and have it over,\" said\npoor Anne with bitter resignation.\n\n\"You know you will like that lovely old place at the Glen after you\nhave lived in it long enough to have dear memories woven about it,\"\nsaid Leslie.  \"Friends will come there, as they have come\nhere--happiness will glorify it for you.  Now, it's just a house to\nyou--but the years will make it a home.\"\n\nAnne and Leslie had another cry the next week when they shortened\nLittle Jem.  Anne felt the tragedy of it until evening when in his long\nnightie she found her own dear baby again.\n\n\"But it will be rompers next--and then trousers--and in no time he will\nbe grown-up,\" she sighed.\n\n\"Well, you would not want him to stay a baby always, Mrs. Doctor, dear,\nwould you?\" said Susan.  \"Bless his innocent heart, he looks too sweet\nfor anything in his little short dresses, with his dear feet sticking\nout.  And think of the save in the ironing, Mrs. Doctor, dear.\"\n\n\"Anne, I have just had a letter from Owen,\" said Leslie, entering with\na bright face.  \"And, oh! I have such good news.  He writes me that he\nis going to buy this place from the church trustees and keep it to\nspend our summer vacations in.  Anne, are you not glad?\"\n\n\"Oh, Leslie, 'glad' isn't the word for it!  It seems almost too good to\nbe true.  I sha'n't feel half so badly now that I know this dear spot\nwill never be desecrated by a vandal tribe, or left to tumble down in\ndecay.  Why, it's lovely!  It's lovely!\"\n\nOne October morning Anne wakened to the realisation that she had slept\nfor the last time under the roof of her little house.  The day was too\nbusy to indulge regret and when evening came the house was stripped and\nbare.  Anne and Gilbert were alone in it to say farewell.  Leslie and\nSusan and Little Jem had gone to the Glen with the last load of\nfurniture.  The sunset light streamed in through the curtainless\nwindows.\n\n\"It has all such a heart-broken, reproachful look, hasn't it?\" said\nAnne.  \"Oh, I shall be so homesick at the Glen tonight!\"\n\n\"We have been very happy here, haven't we, Anne-girl?\" said Gilbert,\nhis voice full of feeling.\n\nAnne choked, unable to answer.  Gilbert waited for her at the fir-tree\ngate, while she went over the house and said farewell to every room.\nShe was going away; but the old house would still be there, looking\nseaward through its quaint windows.  The autumn winds would blow around\nit mournfully, and the gray rain would beat upon it and the white mists\nwould come in from the sea to enfold it; and the moonlight would fall\nover it and light up the old paths where the schoolmaster and his bride\nhad walked.  There on that old harbor shore the charm of story would\nlinger; the wind would still whistle alluringly over the silver\nsand-dunes; the waves would still call from the red rock-coves.\n\n\"But we will be gone,\" said Anne through her tears.\n\nShe went out, closing and locking the door behind her.  Gilbert was\nwaiting for her with a smile.  The lighthouse star was gleaming\nnorthward.  The little garden, where only marigolds still bloomed, was\nalready hooding itself in shadows.\n\nAnne knelt down and kissed the worn old step which she had crossed as a\nbride.\n\n\"Good-bye, dear little house of dreams,\" she said.", "title": "Anne's House of Dreams"}

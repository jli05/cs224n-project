{"summary": "\nNote: Book numbers are in parentheses and come before the synopsis of the book.\n(1) After an invocation to the Muses, the story launches in medias res (in the middle of things) towards the end of the Trojan War between the Trojans and the besieging Greeks. Chryses, a Trojan priest of Apollo, offers the Greeks wealth for the return of his daughter Chryseis, a captive of Agamemnon, the Greek leader. Although most of the Greek army is in favour of the offer, Agamemnon refuses. Chryses prays for Apollo's help, and Apollo causes a plague throughout the Greek army.\nAfter nine days of plague, Achilles, the leader of the Myrmidon contingent, calls an assembly to solve the plague problem. Under pressure, Agamemnon agrees to return Chryseis to her father, but also decides to take Achilles's captive, Briseis, as compensation. Angered, Achilles declares that he and his men will no longer fight for Agamemnon, but will go home. Odysseus takes a ship and brings Chryseis to her father, whereupon Apollo ends the plague.\nIn the meantime, Agamemnon's messengers take Briseis away. Achilles then became very upset, sat by the seashore and prayed for his mother. Achilles then asks his mother, Thetis, to ask Zeus that the Greeks be brought to breaking point by the Trojans, so Agamemnon will realize how much the Greeks need Achilles. Thetis does so, and Zeus agrees.\n(2) Zeus sends a dream to Agamemnon, urging him to attack the city. Agamemnon heeds the dream but decides to first test the morale of the Greek army by telling them to go home. The plan backfires, and only the intervention of Odysseus, inspired by Athena, stops a rout.\nOdysseus confronts and beats Thersites, a common soldier who voices discontent at fighting Agamemnon's war. After a meal, the Greeks deploy in companies upon the Trojan plain. The poet takes the opportunity to describe the provenance of each Greek contingent. When news of the Greek deployment reaches king Priam, the Trojans too sortie upon the plain. In a similar list to that for the Greeks, the poet describes the Trojans and their allies.\n(3) The armies approach each other on the plain, but before they meet, Paris offers to end the war by fighting a duel with Menelaus, urged by his brother and head of the Trojan army, Hector. While Helen tells Priam about the Greek commanders from the walls of Troy, both sides swear a truce and promise to abide by the outcome of the duel. Paris is beaten, but Aphrodite rescues him and leads him to bed with Helen before Menelaus could kill him.\n(4) Pressured by Hera's hatred of Troy, Zeus arranges for the Trojan Pandaros to break the truce by wounding Menelaus with an arrow. Agamemnon rouses the Greeks, and battle is joined.\n(5) In the fighting, Diomedes kills many Trojans, including Pandaros, and defeats Aeneas, whom again Aphrodite rescues, but Diomedes attacks and wounds the goddess. Apollo faces Diomedes, and warns him against warring with gods. Many heroes and commanders join in, including Hector, and the gods supporting each side try to influence the battle. Emboldened by Athena, Diomedes wounds Ares and puts him out of action.\n(6) Hector rallies the Trojans and stops a rout; the Greek Diomedes and the Trojan Glaukos find common ground and exchange unequal gifts. Hector enters the city, urges prayers and sacrifices, incites Paris to battle, bids his wife Andromache and son Astyanax farewell on the city walls, and rejoins the battle.\n(7) Hector duels with Ajax, but nightfall interrupts the fight and both sides retire. The Greeks agree to burn their dead and build a wall to protect their ships and camp, while the Trojans quarrel about returning Helen. Paris offers to return the treasure he took, and give further wealth as compensation, but without returning Helen, and the offer is refused. A day's truce is agreed for burning the dead, during which the Greeks also build their wall and trench.\n(8) The next morning, Zeus prohibits the gods from interfering, and fighting begins anew. The Trojans prevail and force the Greeks back to their wall while Hera and Athena are forbidden from helping. Night falls before the Trojans can assail the Greek wall. They camp in the field to attack at first light, and their watchfires light the plain like stars.\n\n(9) Meanwhile, the Greeks are desperate. Agamemnon admits his error, and sends an embassy composed of Odysseus, Ajax, Phoenix, and two heralds to offer Briseis and extensive gifts to Achilles, who has been camped next to his ships throughout, if only he would return to the fighting. Achilles and his companion Patroclus receive the embassy well, but Achilles angrily refuses Agamemnon's offer, and declares that he would only return to battle if the Trojans reach his ships and threaten them with fire. The embassy returns empty-handed.\n(10) Later that night, Odysseus and Diomedes venture out to the Trojan lines, killing the Trojan Dolon and wreaking havoc in the camps of some Thracian allies of Troy.\n(11) In the morning, the fighting is fierce and Agamemnon, Diomedes, and Odysseus are all wounded. Achilles sends Patroclus from his camp to inquire about the Greek casualties, and while there Patroclus is moved to pity by a speech of Nestor.\n(12) The Trojans assault the Greek wall on foot. Hector, ignoring an omen, leads the terrible fighting. The Greeks are overwhelmed in rout, the wall's gate is broken, and Hector charges in.\n(13) Many fall on both sides. The Trojan seer Polydamas urges Hector to fall back and warns him about Achilles, but is ignored.\n(14) Hera seduces Zeus and lures him to sleep, allowing Poseidon to help the Greeks, and the Trojans are driven back onto the plain.\n(15) Zeus awakes and is enraged by Poseidon's intervention. Against the mounting discontent of the Greek-supporting gods, Zeus sends Apollo to aid the Trojans, who once again breach the wall, and the battle reaches the ships.\n(16) Patroclus can't stand to watch any longer, and begs Achilles to be allowed to defend the ships. Achilles relents, and lends Patroclus his armor, but sends him off with a stern admonition not to pursue the Trojans, lest he take Achilles's glory. Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle and arrives as the Trojans set fire to the first ships. The Trojans are routed by the sudden onslaught, and Patroclus begins his assault by killing the Trojan hero Sarpedon. Patroclus, ignoring Achilles's command, pursues and reaches the gates of Troy, where Apollo himself stops him. Patroclus is set upon by Apollo and Euphorbos, and is finally killed by Hector.\n(17) Hector takes Achilles's armor from the fallen Patroclus, but fighting develops around Patroclus' body.\n(18) Achilles is mad with grief when he hears of Patroclus's death, and vows to take vengeance on Hector; his mother Thetis grieves, too, knowing that Achilles is fated to die young if he kills Hector. Achilles is urged to help retrieve Patroclus' body, but has no armour. Made brilliant by Athena, Achilles stands next to the Greek wall and roars in rage. The Trojans are dismayed by his appearance and the Greeks manage to bear Patroclus' body away. Again Polydamas urges Hector to withdraw into the city, again Hector refuses, and the Trojans camp in the plain at nightfall. Patroclus is mourned, and meanwhile, at Thetis' request, Hephaestus fashions a new set of armor for Achilles, among which is a magnificently wrought shield.\n(19) In the morning, Agamemnon gives Achilles all the promised gifts, including Briseis, but he is indifferent to them. Achilles fasts while the Greeks take their meal, and straps on his new armor, and heaves his great spear. His horse Xanthos prophesies to Achilles his death. Achilles drives his chariot into battle.\n(20) Zeus lifts the ban on the gods' interference, and the gods freely intervene on both sides. The onslaught of Achilles, burning with rage and grief, is terrible, and he slays many.\n(21) Driving the Trojans before him, Achilles cuts off half their number in the river Skamandros and proceeds to slaughter them and fills the river with the dead. The river, angry at the killing, confronts Achilles, but is beaten back by Hephaestus' firestorm. The gods fight among themselves. The great gates of the city are opened to receive the fleeing Trojans, and Apollo leads Achilles away from the city by pretending to be a Trojan.\n(22) When Apollo reveals himself to Achilles, the Trojans had retreated into the city, all except for Hector, who, having twice ignored the counsels of Polydamas, feels the shame of rout and resolves to face Achilles, in spite of the pleas of Priam and Hecuba, his parents. When Achilles approaches, Hector's will fails him, and he is chased around the city by Achilles. Finally, Athena tricks him to stop running, and he turns to face his opponent. After a brief duel, Achilles stabs Hector through the neck. Before dying, Hector reminds Achilles that he is fated to die in the war as well. Achilles takes Hector's body and dishonours it.\n(23) The ghost of Patroclus comes to Achilles in a dream and urges the burial of his body. The Greeks hold a day of funeral games, and Achilles gives out the prizes.\n(24) Dismayed by Achilles' continued abuse of Hector's body, Zeus decides that it must be returned to Priam. Led by Hermes, Priam takes a wagon out of Troy, across the plains, and enters the Greek camp unnoticed. He grasps Achilles by the knees and begs to have his son's body. Achilles is moved to tears, and the two lament their losses in the war. After a meal, Priam carries Hector's body back into Troy. Hector is buried, and the city mourns.\n\n", "full_text": "The Iliad of Homer\n\n\nTranslated by Alexander Pope,\n\nwith notes by the\nRev.

To be content with what we at present know, is, for the most\npart, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very gradual\ncharacter of our education, we must continually forget, and emancipate\nourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set aside old\nnotions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be daily\nunlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and anxiety to\nacquire.\n\nAnd this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which\nprogress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which\npersons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu of\ntheir conventional value. The same principles which have swept away\ntraditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues of\nsinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive\nsuperstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. The\ncredulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as powerful a\ntouchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy scepticism of a\ntemperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of conservatism, or the\nimpostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church. History and tradition,\nwhether of ancient or comparatively recent times, are subjected to very\ndifferent handling from that which the indulgence or credulity of former\nages could allow. Mere statements are jealously watched, and the motives\nof the writer form as important an ingredient in the analysis of his\nhistory, as the facts he records. Probability is a powerful and\ntroublesome test; and it is by this troublesome standard that a large\nportion of historical evidence is sifted. Consistency is no less\npertinacious and exacting in its demands. In brief, to write a history, we\nmust know more than mere facts. Human nature, viewed under an induction of\nextended experience, is the best help to the criticism of human history.\nHistorical characters can only be estimated by the standard which human\nexperience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form correct\nviews of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a great\nwhole--we must measure them by their relation to the mass of beings by whom\nthey are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents in their lives or\ncondition which tradition has handed down to us, we must rather consider\nthe general bearing of the whole narrative, than the respective\nprobability of its details.\n\nIt is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know\nleast, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere(1) have, perhaps,\ncontributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any\nother three writers who could be named, and yet the history of all three\nhas given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which has left us\nlittle save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will\nfollow. The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in which\ncritics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon everything\nelse, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or less of doubt\nand uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the contradictions of\nPlato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one of the _dramatis\npersonae_ in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style. He appears as\nthe enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as those of the\nwriters who have handed them down. When we have read Plato _or_ Xenophon,\nwe think we know something of Socrates; when we have fairly read and\nexamined both, we feel convinced that we are something worse than\nignorant.\n\nIt has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny the\npersonal or real existence of men and things whose life and condition were\ntoo much for our belief. This system--which has often comforted the\nreligious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of Strauss for those\nof the New Testament--has been of incalculable value to the historical\ntheorists of the last and present centuries. To question the existence of\nAlexander the Great, would be a more excusable act, than to believe in\nthat of Romulus. To deny a fact related in Herodotus, because it is\ninconsistent with a theory developed from an Assyrian inscription which no\ntwo scholars read in the same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in\nthe good-natured old king whom the elegant pen of Florian has\nidealized--_Numa Pompilius._\n\nScepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer, and\nthe state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free permission\nto believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all written tradition,\nconcerning the author or authors of the Iliad and Odyssey. What few\nauthorities exist on the subject, are summarily dismissed, although the\narguments appear to run in a circle. \"This cannot be true, because it is\nnot true; and, that is not true, because it cannot be true.\" Such seems to\nbe the style, in which testimony upon testimony, statement upon statement,\nis consigned to denial and oblivion.\n\nIt is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are\npartly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which\ntruth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of the\nHomeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken of the\ntreatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to Herodotus.\n\nAccording to this document, the city of Cumae in AEolia, was, at an early\nperiod, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of Greece.\nAmong the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes. Although poor,\nhe married, and the result of the union was a girl named Critheis. The\ngirl was left an orphan at an early age, under the guardianship of\nCleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this maiden that we \"are\nindebted for so much happiness.\" Homer was the first fruit of her juvenile\nfrailty, and received the name of Melesigenes, from having been born near\nthe river Meles, in Boeotia, whither Critheis had been transported in\norder to save her reputation.\n\n\"At this time,\" continues our narrative, \"there lived at Smyrna a man\nnamed Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being married,\nengaged Critheis to manage his household, and spin the flax he received as\nthe price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was her performance\nof this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made proposals of\nmarriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement, willing to adopt her\nson, who, he asserted, would become a clever man, if he were carefully\nbrought up.\"\n\nThey were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature\nhad bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every\nattainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius\ndied, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon followed.\nMelesigenes carried on his adopted father's school with great success,\nexciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna, but also of\nthe strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially in the\nexportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these visitors, one\nMentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who evinced a knowledge and\nintelligence rarely found in those times, persuaded Melesigenes to close\nhis school, and accompany him on his travels. He promised not only to pay\nhis expenses, but to furnish him with a further stipend, urging, that,\n\"While he was yet young, it was fitting that he should see with his own\neyes the countries and cities which might hereafter be the subjects of his\ndiscourses.\" Melesigenes consented, and set out with his patron,\n\"examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited, and\ninforming himself of everything by interrogating those whom he met.\" We\nmay also suppose, that he wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of\npreservation(2) Having set sail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached\nIthaca. Here Melesigenes, who had already suffered in his eyes, became\nmuch worse, and Mentes, who was about to leave for Leucadia, left him to\nthe medical superintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of\nAlcinor. Under his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly\nbecame acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards\nformed the subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca assert, that\nit was here that Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophomans make their\ncity the seat of that misfortune. He then returned to Smyrna, where he\napplied himself to the study of poetry.(3)\n\nBut poverty soon drove him to Cumae. Having passed over the Hermaean\nplain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumae. Here\nhis misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of one\nTychias, an armourer. \"And up to my time,\" continued the author, \"the\ninhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a recitation\nof his verses, and they greatly honoured the spot. Here also a poplar\ngrew, which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes arrived\".(4)\n\nBut poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being\nthe most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph on\nGordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater probability,\nbeen attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.(5)\n\nArrived at Cumae, he frequented the _converzationes_(6) of the old men,\nand delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by this\nfavourable reception, he declared that, if they would allow him a public\nmaintenance, he would render their city most gloriously  renowned. They\navowed their willingness to support him in the measure he proposed, and\nprocured him an audience in the council. Having made the speech, with the\npurport of which our author has forgotten to acquaint us, he retired, and\nleft them to debate respecting the answer to be given to his proposal.\n\nThe greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet's demand,\nbut one man observed that \"if they were to feed _Homers,_ they would be\nencumbered with a multitude of useless people.\" \"From this circumstance,\"\nsays the writer, \"Melesigenes acquired the name of Homer, for the Cumans\ncall blind men _Homers._\"(7) With a love of economy, which shows how\nsimilar the world has always been in its treatment of literary men, the\npension was denied, and the poet vented his disappointment in a wish that\nCumoea might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory.\n\nAt Phocoea, Homer was destined to experience another literary distress.\nOne Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept\nHomer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of the\nverses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected sufficient poetry\nto be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be-literary publishers,\nneglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him. At his\ndeparture, Homer is said to have observed: \"O Thestorides, of the many\nthings hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more unintelligible\nthan the human heart.\"(8)\n\nHomer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian\nmerchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him recite,\nacquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a profitable\nlivelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This at once determined\nhim to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to be setting sail\nthither, but he found one ready to Start for Erythrae, a town of Ionia,\nwhich faces that island, and he prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to\naccompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a favourable wind, and prayed\nthat he might be able to expose the imposture of Thestorides, who, by his\nbreach of hospitality, had drawn down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.\n\nAt Erythrae, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in\nPhocoea, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty, reached\nthe little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure, which we will\ncontinue in the words of our author. \"Having set out from Pithys, Homer\nwent on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were pasturing. The\ndogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus (for that was the\nname of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up quickly, called off his\ndogs, and drove them away from Homer. For or some time he stood wondering\nhow a blind man should have reached such a place alone, and what could be\nhis design in coming. He then went up to him, and inquired who he was, and\nhow he had come to desolate places and untrodden spots, and of what he\nstood in need. Homer, by recounting to him the whole history of his\nmisfortunes, moved him with compassion; and he took him, and led him to\nhis cot, and having lit a fire, bade him sup.(9)\n\n\"The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according to\ntheir usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O Glaucus, my\nfriend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs their supper at\nthe doors of the hut: for so it is better, since, whilst they watch, nor\nthief nor wild beast will approach the fold.\n\nGlaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author. Having\nfinished supper, they banqueted(10) afresh on conversation, Homer\nnarrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he had visited.\n\nAt length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus\nresolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with\nHomer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left Homer\nat home, promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus, a place\nnear the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole story\nrespecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to what he\nsaid, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed\nand enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the stranger to him.\n\nGlaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him, assuring\nhim that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon showed that\nthe stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge, and the\nChian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the charge of his\nchildren.(11)\n\nBesides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the\nisland, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of\nChios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry. \"To\nthis day,\" says Chandler,(12) \"the most curious remain is that which has\nbeen named, without reason, the School of Homer. It is on the coast, at\nsome distance from the city, northward, and appears to have been an open\ntemple of Cybele, formed on the top of a rock. The shape is oval, and in\nthe centre is the image of the goddess, the head and an arm wanting. She\nis represented, as usual, sitting. The chair has a lion carved on each\nside, and on the back. The area is bounded by a low rim, or seat, and\nabout five yards over. The whole is hewn out of the mountain, is rude,\nindistinct, and probably of the most remote antiquity.\"\n\nSo successful was this school, that Homer realised a considerable fortune.\nHe married, and had two daughters, one of whom died single, the other\nmarried a Chian.\n\nThe following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the personages\nof the poems with the history of the poet, which has already been\nmentioned:--\n\n\"In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards\nMentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he has inserted in his poem\nas the companion of Ulysses,(13) in return for the care taken of him when\nafflicted with blindness. He also testifies his gratitude to Phemius, who\nhad given him both sustenance and instruction.\"\n\nHis celebrity continued to increase, and many persons advised him to visit\nGreece, whither his reputation had now extended. Having, it is said, made\nsome additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity of the\nAthenians, of whose city he had hitherto made no mention,(14) he sent out\nfor Samos. Here being recognized by a Samian, who had met with him in\nChios, he was handsomely received, and invited to join in celebrating the\nApaturian festival. He recited some verses, which gave great satisfaction,\nand by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon festivals, he earned a\nsubsistence, visiting the houses of the rich, with whose children he was\nvery popular.\n\nIn the spring he sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of Ios, now\nIno, where he fell extremely ill, and died. It is said that his death\narose from vexation, at not having been able to unravel an enigma proposed\nby some fishermen's children.(15)\n\nSuch is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of Homer we possess,\nand so broad are the evidences of its historical worthlessness, that it is\nscarcely necessary to point them out in detail. Let us now consider some\nof the opinions to which a persevering, patient, and learned--but by no\nmeans consistent--series of investigations has led. In doing so, I profess\nto bring forward statements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or\nprobability.\n\n\"Homer appeared. The history of this poet and his works is lost in\ndoubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first minds who have\ndone honour to humanity, because they rose amidst darkness. The majestic\nstream of his song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the Nile, through\nmany lands and nations; and, like the sources of the Nile, its fountains\nwill ever remain concealed.\"\n\nSuch are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics has\neloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the Homeric\nquestion is involved. With no less truth and feeling he proceeds:--\n\n\"It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of\nthings makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is the region\nof twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The creations of\ngenius always seem like miracles, because they are, for the most part,\ncreated far out of the reach of observation. If we were in possession of\nall the historical testimonies, we never could wholly explain the origin\nof the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in all essential points,\nmust have remained the secret of the poet.\" (16)\n\nFrom this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of human\nnature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic investigation, let\nus pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer an individual?(17) or\nwere the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of\nfragments by earlier poets?\n\nWell has Landor remarked: \"Some tell us there were twenty Homers; some\ndeny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the\ncontents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are\nperpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our devotion\nto superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know what is good\nfor us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our admiration of good.\nNo man living venerates Homer more than I do.\" (18)\n\nBut, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented\nwith the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and fostered,\nwithout seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions by minute\nanalysis--our editorial office compels us to give some attention to the\ndoubts and difficulties with which the Homeric question is beset, and to\nentreat our reader, for a brief period, to prefer his judgment to his\nimagination, and to condescend to dry details.\n\nBefore, however, entering into particulars respecting the question of this\nunity of the Homeric poems, (at least of the Iliad,) I must express my\nsympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following remarks:--\n\n\"We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the better,\nthe poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its original\ncomposition. It was not till the age of the grammarians that its primitive\nintegrity was called in question; nor is it injustice to assert, that the\nminute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not the best qualification\nfor the profound feeling, the comprehensive conception of an harmonious\nwhole. The most exquisite anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry of the\nhuman frame: and we would take the opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on\nthe proportions and general beauty of a form, rather than that of Mr.\nBrodie or Sir Astley Cooper.\n\n\"There is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines of\nPope.--\n\n  \"'The critic eye--that microscope of wit\n  Sees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit,\n  How parts relate to parts, or they to whole\n  The body's harmony, the beaming soul,\n  Are things which Kuster, Burmann, Wasse, shall see,\n  When man's whole frame is obvious to a flea.'\"(19)\n\nLong was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning the\nunity of the authorship of the Homeric poems. The grave and cautious\nThucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo,(20) the\nauthenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics.\nLonginus, in an oft quoted passage, merely expressed an opinion touching\nthe comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the Iliad,(21) and, among a\nmass of ancient authors, whose very names(22) it would be tedious to\ndetail, no suspicion of the personal non-existence of Homer ever arose. So\nfar, the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on\nthe subject; let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern\ninvestigations lay claim.\n\nAt the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on the\nsubject, and we find Bentley remarking that \"Homer wrote a sequel of songs\nand rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and good cheer,\nat festivals and other days of merriment. These loose songs were not\ncollected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about Peisistratus'\ntime, about five hundred years after.\"(23)\n\nTwo French writers--Hedelin and Perrault--avowed a similar scepticism on the\nsubject; but it is in the \"Scienza Nuova\" of Battista Vico, that we first\nmeet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by Wolf with so\nmuch learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the Wolfian theory that we\nhave chiefly to deal, and with the following bold hypothesis, which we\nwill detail in the words of Grote(24)--\n\n\"Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf,\nturning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been recently\npublished, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the\nHomeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by no means\nthe whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously announced\nby Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent portions of the\nIliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and\nunchangeable order, until the days of Peisistratus, in the sixth century\nbefore Christ. As a step towards that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no\nwritten copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the\nearlier times, to which their composition is referred; and that without\nwriting, neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have\nbeen originally conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him,\ntransmitted with assurance to posterity. The absence of easy and\nconvenient writing, such as must be indispensably supposed for long\nmanuscripts, among the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in Wolf's\ncase against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch,\nand other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the\nother seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been\nconsidered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character\nof the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from\nthe beginning.\n\n\"To me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to\nPeisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are\nnowise admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that view\nof the question, if it could be shown, that, in order to controvert it, we\nwere driven to the necessity of admitting long written poems, in the ninth\ncentury before the Christian aera. Few things, in my opinion, can be more\nimprobable; and Mr. Payne Knight, opposed as he is to the Wolfian\nhypothesis, admits this no less than Wolf himself. The traces of writing\nin Greece, even in the seventh century before the Christian aera, are\nexceedingly trifling. We have no remaining inscription earlier than the\nfortieth Olympiad, and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully\nexecuted; nor can we even assure ourselves whether Archilochus, Simonides\nof Amorgus, Kallinus, Tyrtaeus, Xanthus, and the other early elegiac and\nlyric poets, committed their compositions to writing, or at what time the\npractice of doing so became familiar. The first positive ground which\nauthorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is in the\nfamous ordinance of Solon, with regard to the rhapsodies at the\nPanathenaea: but for what length of time previously manuscripts had\nexisted, we are unable to say.\n\n\"Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the\nbeginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the\nexisting habits of society with regard to poetry--for they admit generally\nthat the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and heard,--but upon\nthe supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure the\npreservation of the poems--the unassisted memory of reciters being neither\nsufficient nor trustworthy. But here we only escape a smaller difficulty\nby running into a greater; for the existence of trained bards, gifted with\nextraordinary memory, (25) is far less astonishing than that of long\nmanuscripts, in an age essentially non-reading and non-writing, and when\neven suitable instruments and materials for the process are not obvious.\nMoreover, there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard\nwas under no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a\nmanuscript; for if such had been the fact, blindness would have been a\ndisqualification for the profession, which we know that it was not, as\nwell from the example of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from that of the\nblind bard of Chios, in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydides, as\nwell as the general tenor of Grecian legend, identifies with Homer\nhimself. The author of that hymn, be he who he may, could never have\ndescribed a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art, if he\nhad been conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by\nconstant reference to the manuscript in his chest.\"\n\nThe loss of the digamma, that _crux_ of critics, that quicksand upon which\neven the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove beyond a doubt,\nthat the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a considerable\nchange. Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the Homeric poems\ncould have suffered by this change, had written copies been preserved. If\nChaucer's poetry, for instance, had not been written, it could only have\ncome down to us in a softened form, more like the effeminate version of\nDryden, than the rough, quaint, noble original.\n\n\"At what period,\" continues Grote, \"these poems, or indeed any other Greek\npoems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture, though\nthere is ground for assurance that it was before the time of Solon. If, in\nthe absence of evidence, we may venture upon naming any more determinate\nperiod, the question a once suggests itself, What were the purposes which,\nin that state of society, a manuscript at its first commencement must have\nbeen intended to answer? For whom was a written Iliad necessary? Not for\nthe rhapsodes; for with them it was not only planted in the memory, but\nalso interwoven with the feelings, and conceived in conjunction with all\nthose flexions and intonations of voice, pauses, and other oral artifices\nwhich were required for emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript\ncould never reproduce. Not for the general public--they were accustomed to\nreceive it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a\nsolemn and crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad\nwould be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class\nof readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had\nexperienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the\nwritten words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the\nimpression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement may\nseem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and\nthere was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed. If\nwe could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed, we\nshould be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were\nfirst committed to writing. Now the period which may with the greatest\nprobability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of\nthe narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle of the seventh\ncentury before the Christian aera (B.C. 660 to B.C. 630), the age of\nTerpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonides of Amorgus, &c. I ground this\nsupposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of\nGrecian poetry and music--the elegiac and the iambic measures having been\nintroduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions\nhaving been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and\nreal life. Such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only\nknown mode of publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable,\nyet the nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking\nat the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new\npoetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it, may well be\nconsidered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their\nown individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric rhapsodies,\njust as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and eulogized the Thebais\nas the production of Homer. There seems, therefore, ground for\nconjecturing that (for the use of this newly-formed and important, but\nvery narrow class), manuscripts of the Homeric poems and other old\nepics,--the Thebais and the Cypria, as well as the Iliad and the\nOdyssey,--began to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century\n(B.C. 1); and the opening of Egypt to Grecian commerce, which took place\nabout the same period, would furnish increased facilities for obtaining\nthe requisite papyrus to write upon. A reading class, when once formed,\nwould doubtless slowly increase, and the number of manuscripts along with\nit; so that before the time of Solon, fifty years afterwards, both readers\nand manuscripts, though still comparatively few, might have attained a\ncertain recognized authority, and formed a tribunal of reference against\nthe carelessness of individual rhapsodes.\"(26)\n\nBut even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the\ncredit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following\nobservations--\n\n\n    \"There are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion,\n    throw some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid\n    compilation, at least over the theory, that the Iliad was cast\n    into its present stately and harmonious form by the directions of\n    the Athenian ruler. If the great poets, who flourished at the\n    bright period of Grecian song, of which, alas! we have inherited\n    little more than the fame, and the faint echo, if Stesichorus,\n    Anacreon, and Simonides were employed in the noble task of\n    compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much must have been done to\n    arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is almost incredible,\n    that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should not remain.\n    Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies which no\n    doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the\n    Homeric age, however the irregular use of the digamma may have\n    perplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have\n    caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among\n    the heroes of her age, however Mr. Knight may have failed in\n    reducing the Homeric language to its primitive form; however,\n    finally, the Attic dialect may not have assumed all its more\n    marked and distinguishing characteristics--still it is difficult to\n    suppose that the language, particularly in the joinings and\n    transitions, and connecting parts, should not more clearly betray\n    the incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of\n    expression. It is not quite in character with such a period to\n    imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an imperfect poem\n    in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott has done in\n    his continuation of Sir Tristram.\n\n    \"If, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of\n    Athenian compilation are discoverable in the language of the\n    poems, the total absence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps\n    no less worthy of observation. In later, and it may fairly be\n    suspected in earlier times, the Athenians were more than\n    ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors. But, amid all\n    the traditions of the glories of early Greece embodied in the\n    Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant\n    part. Even the few passages which relate to their ancestors, Mr.\n    Knight suspects to be interpolations. It is possible, indeed, that\n    in its leading outline, the Iliad may be true to historic fact,\n    that in the great maritime expedition of western Greece against\n    the rival and half-kindred empire of the Laomedontiadae, the\n    chieftain of Thessaly, from his valour and the number of his\n    forces, may have been the most important ally of the Peloponnesian\n    sovereign; the preeminent value of the ancient poetry on the\n    Trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the\n    Athenians to yield to their taste. The songs which spoke of their\n    own great ancestor were, no doubt, of far inferior sublimity and\n    popularity, or, at first sight, a Theseid would have been much\n    more likely to have emanated from an Athenian synod of compilers\n    of ancient song, than an Achilleid or an Olysseid. Could France\n    have given birth to a Tasso, Tancred would have been the hero of\n    the Jerusalem. If, however, the Homeric ballads, as they are\n    sometimes called, which related the wrath of Achilles, with all\n    its direful consequences, were so far superior to the rest of the\n    poetic cycle, as to admit no rivalry,--it is still surprising, that\n    throughout the whole poem the _callida junctura_ should never\n    betray the workmanship of an Athenian hand, and that the national\n    spirit of a race, who have at a later period not inaptly been\n    compared to our self admiring neighbours, the French, should\n    submit with lofty self denial to the almost total exclusion of\n    their own ancestors--or, at least, to the questionable dignity of\n    only having produced a leader tolerably skilled in the military\n    tactics of his age.\"(27)\n\n\nTo return to the Wolfian theory. While it is to be confessed, that Wolf's\nobjections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey have never\nbeen wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they have failed to\nenlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the difficulties with\nwhich the whole subject is beset, are rather augmented than otherwise, if\nwe admit his hypothesis. Nor is Lachmann's(28) modification of his theory\nany better. He divides the first twenty-two books of the Iliad into\nsixteen different songs, and treats as ridiculous the belief that their\namalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the\nage of Peisistratus. This, as Grote observes, \"explains the gaps and\ncontradictions in the narrative, but it explains nothing else.\" Moreover,\nwe find no contradictions warranting this belief, and the so-called\nsixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men in the\nfirst battle after the secession of Achilles: Elphenor, chief of the\nEuboeans; Tlepolemus, of the Rhodians; Pandarus, of the Lycians; Odius, of\nthe Halizonians; Pirous and Acamas, of the Thracians. None of these heroes\nagain make their appearance, and we can but agree with Colonel Mure, that\n\"it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have so\nharmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel.\" The\ndiscrepancy, by which Pylaemenes, who is represented as dead in the fifth\nbook, weeps at his son's funeral in the thirteenth, can only be regarded\nas the result of an interpolation.\n\nGrote, although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the\nsubject, has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian\ntheory, and of Lachmann's modifications with the character of\nPeisistratus. But he has also shown, and we think with equal success, that\nthe two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems, or,\nsupposing that impossible, the unison of these parts by Peisistratus, and\nnot before his time, are essentially distinct. In short, \"a man may\nbelieve the Iliad to have been put together out of pre-existing songs,\nwithout recognising the age of Peisistratus as the period of its first\ncompilation.\" The friends or literary _employes_ of Peisistratus must have\nfound an Iliad that was already ancient, and the silence of the\nAlexandrine critics respecting the Peisistratic \"recension,\" goes far to\nprove, that, among the numerous manuscripts they examined, this was either\nwanting, or thought unworthy of attention.\n\n\"Moreover,\" he continues, \"the whole tenor of the poems themselves\nconfirms what is here remarked. There is nothing, either in the Iliad or\nOdyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age of\nPeisistratus--nothing which brings to our view the alterations brought\nabout by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined money, the\nhabits of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican governments,\nthe close military array, the improved construction of ships, the\nAmphiktyonic convocations, the mutual frequentation of religious\nfestivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion, &c., familiar to\nthe latter epoch. These alterations Onomakritus, and the other literary\nfriends of Peisistratus, could hardly have failed to notice, even without\ndesign, had they then, for the first time, undertaken the task of piecing\ntogether many self existent epics into one large aggregate. Everything in\nthe two great Homeric poems, both in substance and in language, belongs to\nan age two or three centuries earlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the\ninterpolations (or those passages which, on the best grounds, are\npronounced to be such) betray no trace of the sixth century before Christ,\nand may well have been heard by Archilochus and Kallinus--in some cases\neven by Arktinus and Hesiod--as genuine Homeric matter(29) As far as the\nevidences on the case, as well internal as external, enable us to judge,\nwe seem warranted in believing that the Iliad and Odyssey were recited\nsubstantially as they now stand (always allowing for paitial divergences\nof text and interpolations) in 776 B.C., our first trustworthy mark of\nGrecian time; and this ancient date, let it be added, as it is the\nbest-authenticated fact, so it is also the most important attribute of the\nHomeric poems, considered in reference to Grecian history; for they thus\nafford us an insight into the anti-historical character of the Greeks,\nenabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the nation, and to\nseize instructive contrasts between their former and their later\ncondition.\"(30)\n\nOn the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the labours of Peisistratus\nwere wholly of an editorial character, although, I must confess, that I\ncan lay down nothing respecting the extent of his labours. At the same\ntime, so far from believing that the composition or primary arrangement of\nthese poems, in their present form, was the work of Peisistratus, I am\nrather persuaded that the fine taste and elegant mind of that Athenian(31)\nwould lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems,\nrather than to patch and re-construct them according to a fanciful\nhypothesis. I will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether the\npoems were written or not, or whether the art of writing was known in the\ntime of their reputed author. Suffice it to say, that the more we read,\nthe less satisfied we are upon either subject.\n\nI cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the\npreservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version of\nthe same story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical probability\nmust be measured by that of many others relating to the Spartan Confucius.\n\nI will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories, with an attempt, made\nby an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like consistency. It\nis as follows:--\n\n\n    \"No doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common\n    sailors of some fifty years ago, some one qualified to 'discourse\n    in excellent music' among them. Many of these, like those of the\n    negroes in the United States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to\n    events passing around them. But what was passing around them? The\n    grand events of a spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to\n    impress themselves, as the mystical legends of former times had\n    done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive memory was\n    deemed a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated accordingly\n    in those ancient times. Ballads at first, and down to the\n    beginning of the war with Troy, were merely recitations, with an\n    intonation. Then followed a species of recitative, probably with\n    an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the memory\n    considerably.\n\n    \"It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war,\n    that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides,\n    but most probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be\n    made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the\n    social position of Hellas, and, as a collection, he published\n    these lays, connecting them by a tale of his own. This poem now\n    exists, under the title of the 'Odyssea.' The author, however, did\n    not affix his own name to the poem, which, in fact, was, great\n    part of it, remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete, in which\n    tongue the ballads were found by him. He therefore called it the\n    poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is rather a proof of\n    his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging arrangement of\n    other people's ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed, arguing\n    for the unity of authorship, 'a great poet might have re-cast\n    pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no\n    mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.'\n\n    \"While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a\n    ballad, recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble\n    mind seized the hint that there presented itself, and the\n    Achilleis(32) grew under his hand. Unity of design, however,\n    caused him to publish the poem under the same pseudonyme as his\n    former work: and the disjointed lays of the ancient bards were\n    joined together, like those relating to the Cid, into a chronicle\n    history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew that the poem was\n    destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved; but, first,\n    the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and\n    corruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the\n    streets, assemblies, and agoras. However, Solon first, and then\n    Peisistratus, and afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the\n    poems, and restored the works of Melesigenes Homeros to their\n    original integrity in a great measure.\"(33)\n\n\nHaving thus given some general notion of the strange theories which have\ndeveloped themselves respecting this most interesting subject, I must\nstill express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of the\nHomeric poems. To deny that many corruptions and interpolations disfigure\nthem, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here and there\nhave inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of the copyist,\nwould be an absurd and captious assumption, but it is to a higher\ncriticism that we must appeal, if we would either understand or enjoy\nthese poems. In maintaining the authenticity and personality of their one\nauthor, be he Homer or Melesigenes, _quocunque nomine vocari eum jus\nfasque sit,_ I feel conscious that, while the whole weight of historical\nevidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these great works to\na plurality of authors, the most powerful internal evidence, and that\nwhich springs from the deepest and most immediate impulse of the soul,\nalso speaks eloquently to the contrary.\n\nThe minutiae of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise. Indeed,\nconsidering the character of some of my own books, such an attempt would\nbe gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its importance in a\nphilological view, I am inclined to set little store on its aesthetic\nvalue, especially in poetry. Three parts of the emendations made upon\npoets are mere alterations, some of which, had they been suggested to the\nauthor by his Maecenas or Africanus, he would probably have adopted.\nMoreover, those who are most exact in laying down rules of verbal\ncriticism and interpretation, are often least competent to carry out their\nown precepts. Grammarians are not poets by profession, but may be so _per\naccidens._ I do not at this moment remember two emendations on Homer,\ncalculated to substantially improve the poetry of a passage, although a\nmass of remarks, from Herodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history\nof a thousand minute points, without which our Greek knowledge would be\ngloomy and jejune.\n\nBut it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will\nexercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down an\nheroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously\ndissected his words and sentences, they proceed to use the axe and the\npruning knife by wholesale, and inconsistent in everything but their wish\nto make out a case of unlawful affiliation, they cut out book after book,\npassage after passage, till the author is reduced to a collection of\nfragments, or till those, who fancied they possessed the works of some\ngreat man, find that they have been put off with a vile counterfeit got up\nat second hand. If we compare the theories of Knight, Wolf, Lachmann, and\nothers, we shall feel better satisfied of the utter uncertainty of\ncriticism than of the apocryphal position of Homer. One rejects what\nanother considers the turning-point of his theory. One cuts a supposed\nknot by expunging what another would explain by omitting something else.\n\nNor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon as a\nliterary novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill, seems to\nrevel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies attributed to Seneca\nare by _four_ different authors.(34) Now, I will venture to assert, that\nthese tragedies are so uniform, not only in their borrowed phraseology--a\nphraseology with which writers like Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus were\nmore charmed than ourselves--in their freedom from real poetry, and last,\nbut not least, in an ultra-refined and consistent abandonment of good\ntaste, that few writers of the present day would question the capabilities\nof the same gentleman, be he Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but\na great many more equally bad. With equal sagacity, Father Hardouin\nastonished the world with the startling announcement that the AEneid of\nVirgil, and the satires of Horace, were literary deceptions. Now, without\nwishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry and\nlearning--nay, the refined acuteness--which scholars, like Wolf, have\nbestowed upon this subject, I must express my fears, that many of our\nmodern Homeric theories will become matter for the surprise and\nentertainment, rather than the instruction, of posterity. Nor can I help\nthinking, that the literary history of more recent times will account for\nmany points of difficulty in the transmission of the Iliad and Odyssey to\na period so remote from that of their first creation.\n\nI have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus were\nof a purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason why\ncorrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in his\nday, than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should have\ngiven so much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and others. But, after all, the\nmain fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand too great a\nsacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully appeals, and\nwhich are its most fitting judges. The ingenuity which has sought to rob\nus of the name and existence of Homer, does too much violence to that\ninward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with love and admiration\nfor the blind bard of Chios. To believe the author of the Iliad a mere\ncompiler, is to degrade the powers of human invention; to elevate\nanalytical judgment at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of the\nsoul; and to forget the ocean in the contemplation of a polypus. There is\na catholicity, so to speak, in the very name of Homer. Our faith in the\nauthor of the Iliad may be a mistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us\na better.\n\nWhile, however, I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature\nherself for its mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius in believing\nin Homer as the ghost, who, like some patron saint, hovers round the bed\nof the poet, and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth of imagination\nwhich a host of imitators could not exhaust,--still I am far from wishing\nto deny that the author of these great poems found a rich fund of\ntradition, a well-stocked mythical storehouse from whence he might derive\nboth subject and embellishment. But it is one thing to _use_ existing\nromances in the embellishment of a poem, another to patch up the poem\nitself from such materials. What consistency of style and execution can be\nhoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what bad taste and tedium will\nnot be the infallible result?\n\nA blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other bards,\nare features perfectly consistent with poetical originality. In fact, the\nmost original writer is still drawing upon outward impressions--nay, even\nhis own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents which support and feed the\nimpulses of imagination. But unless there be some grand pervading\nprinciple--some invisible, yet most distinctly stamped archetypus of the\ngreat whole, a poem like the Iliad can never come to the birth. Traditions\nthe most picturesque, episodes the most pathetic, local associations\nteeming with the thoughts of gods and great men, may crowd in one mighty\nvision, or reveal themselves in more substantial forms to the mind of the\npoet; but, except the power to create a grand whole, to which these shall\nbe but as details and embellishments, be present, we shall have nought but\na scrap-book, a parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each\nother in their wild redundancy: we shall have a cento of rags and tatters,\nwhich will require little acuteness to detect.\n\nSensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware as\nI must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief, it\nstill seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved for a\nhigher criticism than it has often obtained. We are not by nature intended\nto know all things; still less, to compass the powers by which the\ngreatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal. Were faith no\nvirtue, then we might indeed wonder why God willed our ignorance on any\nmatter. But we are too well taught the contrary lesson; and it seems as\nthough our faith should be especially tried touching the men and the\nevents which have wrought most influence upon the condition of humanity.\nAnd there is a kind of sacredness attached to the memory of the great and\nthe good, which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which would\nallegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue, and measure the\ngiants of intellect by an homeopathic dynameter.\n\nLong and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts\neven to his incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right spirit and\nwith a heartfelt appreciation, we are too much dazzled, too deeply wrapped\nin admiration of the whole, to dwell upon the minute spots which mere\nanalysis can discover. In reading an heroic poem we must transform\nourselves into heroes of the time being, we in imagination must fight over\nthe same battles, woo the same loves, burn with the same sense of injury,\nas an Achilles or a Hector. And if we can but attain this degree of\nenthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will scarcely suffice for the reading of\nHomer), we shall feel that the poems of Homer are not only the work of one\nwriter, but of the greatest writer that ever touched the hearts of men by\nthe power of song.\n\nAnd it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems their\npowerful influence over the minds of the men of old. Heeren, who is\nevidently little disposed in favour of modern theories, finely observes:--\n\n\n    \"It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation. No\n    poet has ever, as a poet, exercised a similar influence over his\n    countrymen. Prophets, lawgivers, and sages have formed the\n    character of other nations; it was reserved to a poet to form that\n    of the Greeks. This is a feature in their character which was not\n    wholly erased even in the period of their degeneracy. When\n    lawgivers and sages appeared in Greece, the work of the poet had\n    already been accomplished; and they paid homage to his superior\n    genius. He held up before his nation the mirror, in which they\n    were to behold the world of gods and heroes no less than of feeble\n    mortals, and to behold them reflected with purity and truth. His\n    poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature; on the\n    love of children, wife, and country; on that passion which\n    outweighs all others, the love of glory. His songs were poured\n    forth from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of\n    man; and therefore they enter, and will continue to enter, every\n    breast which cherishes the same sympathies. If it is granted to\n    his immortal spirit, from another heaven than any of which he\n    dreamed on earth, to look down on his race, to see the nations\n    from the fields of Asia to the forests of Hercynia, performing\n    pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic wand caused to flow;\n    if it is permitted to him to view the vast assemblage of grand, of\n    elevated, of glorious productions, which had been called into\n    being by means of his songs; wherever his immortal spirit may\n    reside, this alone would suffice to complete his happiness.\"(35)\n\n\nCan we contemplate that ancient monument, on which the \"Apotheosis of\nHomer\"(36) is depictured, and not feel how much of pleasing association,\nhow much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds, is\nlost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition? The more we\nread, and the more we think--think as becomes the readers of Homer,--the\nmore rooted becomes the conviction that the Father of Poetry gave us this\nrich inheritance, whole and entire. Whatever were the means of its\npreservation, let us rather be thankful for the treasury of taste and\neloquence thus laid open to our use, than seek to make it a mere centre\naround which to drive a series of theories, whose wildness is only\nequalled by their inconsistency with each other.\n\nAs the hymns, and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer, are not\nincluded in Pope's translation, I will content myself with a brief account\nof the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, from the pen of a writer who has done\nit full justice(37):--\n\n\n    \"This poem,\" says Coleridge, \"is a short mock-heroic of ancient\n    date. The text varies in different editions, and is obviously\n    disturbed and corrupt to a great degree; it is commonly said to\n    have been a juvenile essay of Homer's genius; others have\n    attributed it to the same Pigrees, mentioned above, and whose\n    reputation for humour seems to have invited the appropriation of\n    any piece of ancient wit, the author of which was uncertain; so\n    little did the Greeks, before the age of the Ptolemies, know or\n    care about that department of criticism employed in determining\n    the genuineness of ancient writings. As to this little poem being\n    a youthful prolusion of Homer, it seems sufficient to say that\n    from the beginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody,\n    not only of the general spirit, but of the numerous passages of\n    the Iliad itself; and even, if no such intention to parody were\n    discernible in it, the objection would still remain, that to\n    suppose a work of mere burlesque to be the primary effort of\n    poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse that order in the\n    development of national taste, which the history of every other\n    people in Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost ascertained to\n    be a law of the human mind; it is in a state of society much more\n    refined and permanent than that described in the Iliad, that any\n    popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is\n    contained in this poem; and the fact of there having existed three\n    other poems of the same kind attributed, for aught we can see,\n    with as much reason to Homer, is a strong inducement to believe\n    that none of them were of the Homeric age. Knight infers from the\n    usage of the word deltos, \"writing tablet,\" instead of diphthera,\n    \"skin,\" which, according to Herod. 5, 58, was the material\n    employed by the Asiatic Greeks for that purpose, that this poem\n    was another offspring of Attic ingenuity; and generally that the\n    familiar mention of the cock (v. 191) is a strong argument against\n    so ancient a date for its composition.\"\n\n\nHaving thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope's design,\nI will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation, and on my own\npurpose in the present edition.\n\nPope was not a Grecian. His whole education had been irregular, and his\nearliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby. It\nis not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a\ndisposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive\ndeeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence his whole\nwork is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a\ntranslation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes, which\nprove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical attainments\nwere sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it is probable that\nthese examinations were the result rather of the contradictory versions\nalready existing, than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the\noriginal. And in those days, what is called literal translation was less\ncultivated than at present. If something like the general sense could be\ndecorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet; if the charms of\nmetrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made consistent with a\nfair interpretation of the poet's meaning, his _words_ were less jealously\nsought for, and those who could read so good a poem as Pope's Iliad had\nfair reason to be satisfied.\n\nIt would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope's translation by our own\nadvancing knowledge of the original text. We must be content to look at it\nas a most delightful work in itself,--a work which is as much a part of\nEnglish literature as Homer himself is of Greek. We must not be torn from\nour kindly associations with the old Iliad, that once was our most\ncherished companion, or our most looked-for prize, merely because\nButtmann, Loewe, and Liddell have made us so much more accurate as to\namphikupellon being an adjective, and not a substantive. Far be it from us\nto defend the faults of Pope, especially when we think of Chapman's fine,\nbold, rough old English;--far be it from, us to hold up his translation as\nwhat a translation of Homer _might_ be. But we can still dismiss Pope's\nIliad to the hands of our readers, with the consciousness that they must\nhave read a very great number of books before they have read its fellow.\n\nAs to the Notes accompanying the present volume, they are drawn up without\npretension, and mainly with the view of helping the general reader. Having\nsome little time since translated all the works of Homer for another\npublisher, I might have brought a large amount of accumulated matter,\nsometimes of a critical character, to bear upon the text. But Pope's\nversion was no field for such a display; and my purpose was to touch\nbriefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions, to notice occasionally\n_some_ departures from the original, and to give a few parallel passages\nfrom our English Homer, Milton. In the latter task I cannot pretend to\nnovelty, but I trust that my other annotations, while utterly disclaiming\nhigh scholastic views, will be found to convey as much as is wanted; at\nleast, as far as the necessary limits of these volumes could be expected\nto admit. To write a commentary on Homer is not my present aim; but if I\nhave made Pope's translation a little more entertaining and instructive to\na mass of miscellaneous readers, I shall consider my wishes satisfactorily\naccomplished.\n\n                                                   THEODORE ALOIS BUCKLEY.\n\n_Christ Church._\n\n\n\n\n\nPOPE'S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER\n\n\nHomer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any\nwriter whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested with\nhim, and others may have their pretensions as to particular excellences;\nbut his invention remains yet unrivalled. Nor is it a wonder if he has\never been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most excelled in that\nwhich is the very foundation of poetry. It is the invention that, in\ndifferent degrees, distinguishes all great geniuses: the utmost stretch of\nhuman study, learning, and industry, which masters everything besides, can\nnever attain to this. It furnishes art with all her materials, and without\nit judgment itself can at best but \"steal wisely:\" for art is only like a\nprudent steward that lives on managing the riches of nature. Whatever\npraises may be given to works of judgment, there is not even a single\nbeauty in them to which the invention must not contribute: as in the most\nregular gardens, art can only reduce beauties of nature to more\nregularity, and such a figure, which the common eye may better take in,\nand is, therefore, more entertained with. And, perhaps, the reason why\ncommon critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to\na great and fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves\nto pursue their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art,\nthan to comprehend the vast and various extent of nature.\n\nOur author's work is a wild paradise, where, if we cannot see all the\nbeauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the\nnumber of them is infinitely greater. It is like a copious nursery, which\ncontains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of which those\nwho followed him have but selected some particular plants, each according\nto his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If some things are too luxuriant\nit is owing to the richness of the soil; and if others are not arrived to\nperfection or maturity, it is only because they are overrun and oppressed\nby those of a stronger nature.\n\nIt is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that\nunequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer, that no man of\na true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him. What he\nwrites is of the most animated nature imaginable; every thing moves, every\nthing lives, and is put in action. If a council be called, or a battle\nfought, you are not coldly informed of what was said or done as from a\nthird person; the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of the\npoet's imagination, and turns in one place to a hearer, in another to a\nspectator. The course of his verses resembles that of the army he\ndescribes,\n\n  Hoid' ar' isan hosei te puri chthon pasa nemoito.\n\n\"They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it.\" It\nis, however, remarkable, that his fancy, which is everywhere vigorous, is\nnot discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest\nsplendour: it grows in the progress both upon himself and others, and\nbecomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity. Exact\ndisposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers, may have\nbeen found in a thousand; but this poetic fire, this \"vivida vis animi,\"\nin a very few. Even in works where all those are imperfect or neglected,\nthis can overpower criticism, and make us admire even while we disapprove.\nNay, where this appears, though attended with absurdities, it brightens\nall the rubbish about it, till we see nothing but its own splendour. This\nfire is discerned in Virgil, but discerned as through a glass, reflected\nfrom Homer, more shining than fierce, but everywhere equal and constant:\nin Lucan and Statius it bursts out in sudden, short, and interrupted\nflashes: In Milton it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour\nby the force of art: in Shakspeare it strikes before we are aware, like an\naccidental fire from heaven: but in Homer, and in him only, it burns\neverywhere clearly and everywhere irresistibly.\n\nI shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in a\nmanner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent parts\nof his work: as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which\ndistinguishes him from all other authors.\n\nThis strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the\nviolence of its course, drew all things within its vortex. It seemed not\nenough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole compass of\nnature, to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward passions and\naffections of mankind, to furnish his characters: and all the outward\nforms and images of things for his descriptions: but wanting yet an ampler\nsphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and boundless walk for his\nimagination, and created a world for himself in the invention of fable.\nThat which Aristotle calls \"the soul of poetry,\" was first breathed into\nit by Homer, I shall begin with considering him in his part, as it is\nnaturally the first; and I speak of it both as it means the design of a\npoem, and as it is taken for fiction.\n\nFable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the\nmarvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions as, though\nthey did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature; or of such\nas, though they did, became fables by the additional episodes and manner\nof telling them. Of this sort is the main story of an epic poem, \"The\nreturn of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in Italy,\" or the like.\nThat of the Iliad is the \"anger of Achilles,\" the most short and single\nsubject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet this he has supplied with a\nvaster variety of incidents and events, and crowded with a greater number\nof councils, speeches, battles, and episodes of all kinds, than are to be\nfound even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and\nirregularity. The action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and\nits whole duration employs not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of\nso warm a genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as\nwell as a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both\nHomer's poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his.\nThe other epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried it\nso far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of\naction, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor is\nit only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his\ninvention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of story.\nIf he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up their\nforces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus, Virgil\nhas the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them) destroys\nthe unity of his actions for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses visit the\nshades, the AEneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent after him. If he\nbe detained from his return by the allurements of Calypso, so is AEneas by\nDido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be absent from the army on the\nscore of a quarrel through half the poem, Rinaldo must absent himself just\nas long on the like account. If he gives his hero a suit of celestial\narmour, Virgil and Tasso make the same present to theirs. Virgil has not\nonly observed this close imitation of Homer, but, where he had not led the\nway, supplied the want from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon,\nand the taking of Troy, was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for word\nfrom Pisander, as the loves of Dido and AEneas are taken from those of\nMedea and Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.\n\nTo proceed to the allegorical fable--If we reflect upon those innumerable\nknowledges, those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which Homer is\ngenerally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories, what a new and\nample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us! How fertile will\nthat imagination appear, which as able to clothe all the properties of\nelements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues and vices, in forms\nand persons, and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of\nthe things they shadowed! This is a field in which no succeeding poets\ncould dispute with Homer, and whatever commendations have been allowed\nthem on this head, are by no means for their invention in having enlarged\nhis circle, but for their judgment in having contracted it. For when the\nmode of learning changed in the following ages, and science was delivered\nin a plainer manner, it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets\nto lay it aside, as it was in Homer to make use of it. And perhaps it was\nno unhappy circumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that\ndemand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing\nall those allegorical parts of a poem.\n\nThe marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural, and especially the\nmachines of the gods. If Homer was not the first who introduced the\ndeities (as Herodotus imagines) into the religion of Greece, he seems the\nfirst who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry, and such a\none as makes its greatest importance and dignity: for we find those\nauthors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods,\nconstantly laying their accusation against Homer as the chief support of\nit. But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a\nphilosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic, that\nmankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have been able\nto enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set: every\nattempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the various\nchanges of times and religions, his gods continue to this day the gods of\npoetry.\n\nWe come now to the characters of his persons; and here we shall find no\nauthor has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a variety,\nor given us such lively and affecting impressions of them. Every one has\nsomething so singularly his own, that no painter could have distinguished\nthem more by their features, than the poet has by their manners. Nothing\ncan be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different\ndegrees of virtues and vices. The single quality of courage is wonderfully\ndiversified in the several characters of the Iliad. That of Achilles is\nfurious and intractable; that of Diomede forward, yet listening to advice,\nand subject to command; that of Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of\nHector, active and vigilant: the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by\nlove of empire and ambition; that of Menelaus mixed with softness and\ntenderness for his people: we find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in\nSarpedon a gallant and generous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishing\ndiversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the\nmain of each character, but even in the under parts of it, to which he\ntakes care to give a tincture of that principal one. For example: the main\ncharacters of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct\nin this, that the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other\nnatural, open, and regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage;\nand this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference\nof his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other\nupon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these kinds.\nThe characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open manner;\nthey lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and, where they\nare marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of Homer.\nHis characters of valour are much alike; even that of Turnus seems no way\npeculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and we see nothing that\ndifferences the courage of Mnestheus from that of Sergestus, Cloanthus, or\nthe rest, In like manner it may be remarked of Statius's heroes, that an\nair of impetuosity runs through them all; the same horrid and savage\ncourage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus, Hippomedon, &c. They have a\nparity of character, which makes them seem brothers of one family. I\nbelieve when the reader is led into this tract of reflection, if he will\npursue it through the epic and tragic writers, he will be convinced how\ninfinitely superior, in this point, the invention of Homer was to that of\nall others.\n\nThe speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters; being\nperfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners, of those\nwho utter them. As there is more variety of characters in the Iliad, so\nthere is of speeches, than in any other poem. \"Everything in it has\nmanner\" (as Aristotle expresses it), that is, everything is acted or\nspoken. It is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how small a\nnumber of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the dramatic part is\nless in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches often consist of\ngeneral reflections or thoughts, which might be equally just in any\nperson's mouth upon the same occasion. As many of his persons have no\napparent characters, so many of his speeches escape being applied and\njudged by the rule of propriety. We oftener think of the author himself\nwhen we read Virgil, than when we are engaged in Homer, all which are the\neffects of a colder invention, that interests us less in the action\ndescribed. Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil leaves us readers.\n\nIf, in the next place, we take a view of the sentiments, the same\npresiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thoughts.\nLonginus has given his opinion, that it was in this part Homer principally\nexcelled. What were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and excellence\nof his sentiments in general, is, that they have so remarkable a parity\nwith those of the Scripture. Duport, in his Gnomologia Homerica, has\ncollected innumerable instances of this sort. And it is with justice an\nexcellent modern writer allows, that if Virgil has not so many thoughts\nthat are low and vulgar, he has not so many that are sublime and noble;\nand that the Roman author seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments\nwhere he is not fired by the Iliad.\n\nIf we observe his descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the\ninvention still predominant. To what else can we ascribe that vast\ncomprehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance of\nart, and individual of nature, summoned together by the extent and\nfecundity of his imagination to which all things, in their various views\npresented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions taken off to\nperfection at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full prospects of\nthings, but several unexpected peculiarities and side views, unobserved by\nany painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his\nbattles, which take up no less than half the Iliad, and are supplied with\nso vast a variety of incidents, that no one bears a likeness to another;\nsuch different kinds of deaths, that no two heroes are wounded in the same\nmanner, and such a profusion of noble ideas, that every battle rises above\nthe last in greatness, horror, and confusion. It is certain there is not\nnear that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet, though every\none has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him; and it is\nevident of Virgil especially, that he has scarce any comparisons which are\nnot drawn from his master.\n\nIf we descend from hence to the expression, we see the bright imagination\nof Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it. We acknowledge him\nthe father of poetical diction; the first who taught that \"language of the\ngods\" to men. His expression is like the colouring of some great masters,\nwhich discovers itself to be laid on boldly, and executed with rapidity.\nIt is, indeed, the strongest and most glowing imaginable, and touched with\nthe greatest spirit. Aristotle had reason to say, he was the only poet who\nhad found out \"living words;\" there are in him more daring figures and\nmetaphors than in any good author whatever. An arrow is \"impatient\" to be\non the wing, a weapon \"thirsts\" to drink the blood of an enemy, and the\nlike, yet his expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great\nin proportion to it. It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the\ndiction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it, for in the same\ndegree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter, as that\nis more strong, this will become more perspicuous; like glass in the\nfurnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a greater\nclearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the heat more\nintense.\n\nTo throw his language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected the\ncompound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to\npoetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted and\nfilled the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise conduced in\nsome measure to thicken the images. On this last consideration I cannot\nbut attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention, since (as\nhe has managed them) they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of the\npersons or things to which they were joined. We see the motion of Hector's\nplumes in the epithet Korythaiolos, the landscape of Mount Neritus in that\nof Einosiphyllos, and so of others, which particular images could not have\nbeen insisted upon so long as to express them in a description (though but\nof a single line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal\naction or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these epithets\nis a short description.\n\nLastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a\nshare of praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not satisfied\nwith his language as he found it settled in any one part of Greece, but\nsearched through its different dialects with this particular view, to\nbeautify and perfect his numbers he considered these as they had a greater\nmixture of vowels or consonants, and accordingly employed them as the\nverse required either a greater smoothness or strength. What he most\naffected was the Ionic, which has a peculiar sweetness, from its never\nusing contractions, and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs into\ntwo syllables, so as to make the words open themselves with a more\nspreading and sonorous fluency. With this he mingled the Attic\ncontractions, the broader Doric, and the feebler AEolic, which often\nrejects its aspirate, or takes off its accent, and completed this variety\nby altering some letters with the licence of poetry. Thus his measures,\ninstead of being fetters to his sense, were always in readiness to run\nalong with the warmth of his rapture, and even to give a further\nrepresentation of his notions, in the correspondence of their sounds to\nwhat they signified. Out of all these he has derived that harmony which\nmakes us confess he had not only the richest head, but the finest ear in\nthe world. This is so great a truth, that whoever will but consult the\ntune of his verses, even without understanding them (with the same sort of\ndiligence as we daily see practised in the case of Italian operas), will\nfind more sweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other\nlanguage of poetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to\nbe copied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just as to\nascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has some\nadvantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn and\ncadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no other language.\nVirgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in working\nup a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of,\nand, in particular, never failed to bring the sound of his line to a\nbeautiful agreement with its sense. If the Grecian poet has not been so\nfrequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the only reason is,\nthat fewer critics have understood one language than the other. Dionysius\nof Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our author's beauties in this\nkind, in his treatise of the Composition of Words. It suffices at present\nto observe of his numbers, that they flow with so much ease, as to make\none imagine Homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the\nMuses dictated, and, at the same time, with so much force and inspiriting\nvigour, that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet. They\nroll along as a plentiful river, always in motion, and always full; while\nwe are borne away by a tide of verse, the most rapid, and yet the most\nsmooth imaginable.\n\nThus on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us is\nhis invention. It is that which forms the character of each part of his\nwork; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive and\ncopious than any other, his manners more lively and strongly marked, his\nspeeches more affecting and transported, his sentiments more warm and\nsublime, his images and descriptions more full and animated, his\nexpression more raised and daring, and his numbers more rapid and various.\nI hope, in what has been said of Virgil, with regard to any of these\nheads, I have no way derogated from his character. Nothing is more absurd\nor endless, than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an\nopposition of particular passages in them, and forming a judgment from\nthence of their merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain knowledge\nof the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each: it is in\nthat we are to consider him, and in proportion to his degree in that we\nare to admire him. No author or man ever excelled all the world in more\nthan one faculty; and as Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in\njudgment. Not that we are to think that Homer wanted judgment, because\nVirgil had it in a more eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention,\nbecause Homer possessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors\nhad more of both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have\nless in comparison with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil\nthe better artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work.\nHomer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil\nleads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters with a generous\nprofusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; Homer, like the\nNile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil, like a river\nin its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold their\nbattles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate. Homer,\nboundless and resistless as Achilles, bears all before him, and shines\nmore and more as the tumult increases; Virgil, calmly daring, like AEneas,\nappears undisturbed in the midst of the action; disposes all about him,\nand conquers with tranquillity. And when we look upon their machines,\nHomer seems like his own Jupiter in his terrors, shaking Olympus,\nscattering the lightnings, and firing the heavens: Virgil, like the same\npower in his benevolence, counselling with the gods, laying plans for\nempires, and regularly ordering his whole creation.\n\nBut after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues, they\nnaturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard to distinguish\nexactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As prudence may\nsometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great judgment decline to coldness;\nand as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance, so may a great\ninvention to redundancy or wildness. If we look upon Homer in this view,\nwe shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed from so\nnoble a cause as the excess of this faculty.\n\nAmong these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions, upon which so\nmuch criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of\nprobability. Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls, as with\ngigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves with unusual strength, exceed\nwhat is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become miracles\nin the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit something near\nextravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances.\nThus Homer has his \"speaking horses;\" and Virgil his \"myrtles distilling\nblood;\" where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy\nintervention of a deity to save the probability.\n\nIt is owing to the same vast invention, that his similes have been thought\ntoo exuberant and full of circumstances. The force of this faculty is seen\nin nothing more, than in its inability to confine itself to that single\ncircumstance upon which the comparison is grounded: it runs out into\nembellishments of additional images, which, however, are so managed as not\nto overpower the main one. His similes are like pictures, where the\nprincipal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the\noriginal, but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects. The\nsame will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisons\ntogether in one breath, when his fancy suggested to him at once so many\nvarious and correspondent images. The reader will easily extend this\nobservation to more objections of the same kind.\n\nIf there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or\nnarrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will be\nfound upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times he\nlived in. Such are his grosser representations of the gods; and the\nvicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but I must here speak a word\nof the latter, as it is a point generally carried into extremes, both by\nthe censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a strange partiality to\nantiquity, to think with Madame Dacier,(38) \"that those times and manners\nare so much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to ours.\" Who\ncan be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those\nages, when a spirit of revenge and cruelty, joined with the practice of\nrapine and robbery, reigned through the world: when no mercy was shown but\nfor the sake of lucre; when the greatest princes were put to the sword,\nand their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines? On the other\nside, I would not be so delicate as those modern critics, who are shocked\nat the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the\nheroes of Homer engaged. There is a pleasure in taking a view of that\nsimplicity, in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages: in beholding\nmonarchs without their guards; princes tending their flocks, and\nprincesses drawing water from the springs. When we read Homer, we ought to\nreflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world;\nand those who consider him in this light, will double their pleasure in\nthe perusal of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted with\nnations and people that are now no more; that they are stepping almost\nthree thousand years back into the remotest antiquity, and entertaining\nthemselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to be\nfound, the only true mirror of that ancient world. By this means alone\ntheir greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates their\ndislike, will become a satisfaction.\n\nThis consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of the\nsame epithets to his gods and heroes; such as the \"far-darting Phoebus,\"\nthe \"blue-eyed Pallas,\" the \"swift-footed Achilles,\" &c., which some have\ncensured as impertinent, and tediously repeated. Those of the gods\ndepended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to them; and\nhad contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotions\nin which they were used: they were a sort of attributes with which it was\na matter of religion to salute them on all occasions, and which it was an\nirreverence to omit. As for the epithets of great men, Mons. Boileau is of\nopinion, that they were in the nature of surnames, and repeated as such;\nfor the Greeks having no names derived from their fathers, were obliged to\nadd some other distinction of each person; either naming his parents\nexpressly, or his place of birth, profession, or the like: as Alexander\nthe son of Philip, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &c.\nHomer, therefore, complying with the custom of his country, used such\ndistinctive additions as better agreed with poetry. And, indeed, we have\nsomething parallel to these in modern times, such as the names of Harold\nHarefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black Prince, &c.\nIf yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the\nrepetition, I shall add a further conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the world\ninto its different ages, has placed a fourth age, between the brazen and\nthe iron one, of \"heroes distinct from other men; a divine race who fought\nat Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by the care of Jupiter\nin the islands of the blessed.\" Now among the divine honours which were\npaid them, they might have this also in common with the gods, not to be\nmentioned without the solemnity of an epithet, and such as might be\nacceptable to them by celebrating their families, actions or qualities.\n\nWhat other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such as hardly\ndeserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the\ncourse of the work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour\nto exalt Virgil; which is much the same, as if one should think to raise\nthe superstructure by undermining the foundation: one would imagine, by\nthe whole course of their parallels, that these critics never so much as\nheard of Homer's having written first; a consideration which whoever\ncompares these two poets ought to have always in his eye. Some accuse him\nfor the same things which they overlook or praise in the other; as when\nthey prefer the fable and moral of the AEneis to those of the Iliad, for\nthe same reasons which might set the Odyssey above the AEneis; as that the\nhero is a wiser man, and the action of the one more beneficial to his\ncountry than that of the other; or else they blame him for not doing what\nhe never designed; as because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince\nas AEneas, when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character:\nit is thus that Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil. Others\nselect those particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured as\nsome that Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management of\nScaliger in his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they take for low and\nmean expressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement,\noftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original, and then triumph\nin the awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct of\nPerrault in his Parallels. Lastly, there are others, who, pretending to a\nfairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit of Homer, and\nthat of his work; but when they come to assign the causes of the great\nreputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his times,\nand the prejudice of those that followed: and in pursuance of this\nprinciple, they make those accidents (such as the contention of the\ncities, &c.) to be the causes of his fame, which were in reality the\nconsequences of his merit. The same might as well be said of Virgil, or\nany great author whose general character will infallibly raise many casual\nadditions to their reputation. This is the method of Mons. de la Mott; who\nyet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age Homer had lived, he must\nhave been the greatest poet of his nation, and that he may be said in his\nsense to be the master even of those who surpassed him.(39)\n\nIn all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to the\nhonour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed the\ncharacteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his followers, he\nstill continues superior to them. A cooler judgment may commit fewer\nfaults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of critics: but that\nwarmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses which\nholds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment. Homer not\nonly appears the inventor of poetry, but excels all the inventors of other\narts, in this, that he has swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded\nhim. What he has done admitted no increase, it only left room for\ncontraction or regulation. He showed all the stretch of fancy at once; and\nif he has failed in some of his flights, it was but because he attempted\neverything. A work of this kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises from\nthe most vigorous seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and\nproduces the finest fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure\nand profit join to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults,\nhave only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness\nof nature, might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance.\n\nHaving now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, it remains\nto treat of the translation, with the same view to the chief\ncharacteristic. As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem, such\nas the fable, manners, and sentiments, no translator can prejudice it but\nby wilful omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out in every\nparticular image, description, and simile, whoever lessens or too much\nsoftens those, takes off from this chief character. It is the first grand\nduty of an interpreter to give his author entire and unmaimed; and for the\nrest, the diction and versification only are his proper province, since\nthese must be his own, but the others he is to take as he finds them.\n\nIt should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in\nour language for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain no\nliteral translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior\nlanguage: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that a\nrash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no less\nin danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the modern\nmanners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there is often a\nlight in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a version almost\nliteral. I know no liberties one ought to take, but those which are\nnecessary to transfusing the spirit of the original, and supporting the\npoetical style of the translation: and I will venture to say, there have\nnot been more men misled in former times by a servile, dull adherence to\nthe letter, than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical, insolent hope\nof raising and improving their author. It is not to be doubted, that the\nfire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard, as it is\nmost likely to expire in his managing: however, it is his safest way to be\ncontent with preserving this to his utmost in the whole, without\nendeavouring to be more than he finds his author is, in any particular\nplace. It is a great secret in writing, to know when to be plain, and when\npoetical and figurative; and it is what Homer will teach us, if we will\nbut follow modestly in his footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty,\nlet us raise ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we\nought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the\ncensure of a mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer seems to\nhave been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some of\nhis translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the\nsublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold and timorous notion of\nsimplicity. Methinks I see these different followers of Homer, some\nsweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the certain\nsigns of false mettle), others slowly and servilely creeping in his train,\nwhile the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and\nequal majesty before them. However, of the two extremes one could sooner\npardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be envied for such\ncommendations, as he may gain by that character of style, which his\nfriends must agree together to call simplicity, and the rest of the world\nwill call dulness. There is a graceful and dignified simplicity, as well\nas a bold and sordid one; which differ as much from each other as the air\nof a plain man from that of a sloven: it is one thing to be tricked up,\nand another not to be dressed at all. Simplicity is the mean between\nostentation and rusticity.\n\nThis pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the\nScripture and our author. One may affirm, with all respect to the inspired\nwritings, that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words but what were\nintelligible and common to men at that time, and in that part of the\nworld; and, as Homer is the author nearest to those, his style must of\ncourse bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books than that of any\nother writer. This consideration (together with what has been observed of\nthe parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks, induce a translator, on\nthe one hand, to give in to several of those general phrases and manners\nof expression, which have attained a veneration even in our language from\nbeing used in the Old Testament; as, on the other, to avoid those which\nhave been appropriated to the Divinity, and in a manner consigned to\nmystery and religion.\n\nFor a further preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care\nshould be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and\nproverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet. They have\nsomething venerable, and as I may say, oracular, in that unadorned gravity\nand shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which would be\nutterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious\n(that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphrase.\n\nPerhaps the mixture of some Graecisms and old words after the manner of\nMilton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill effect\nin a version of this particular work, which most of any other seems to\nrequire a venerable, antique cast. But certainly the use of modern terms\nof war and government, such as \"platoon, campaign, junto,\" or the like,\n(into which some of his translators have fallen) cannot be allowable;\nthose only excepted without which it is impossible to treat the subjects\nin any living language.\n\nThere are two peculiarities in Homer's diction, which are a sort of marks\nor moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first sight; those\nwho are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects, and those who\nare, seemed pleased with them as beauties. I speak of his compound\nepithets, and of his repetitions. Many of the former cannot be done\nliterally into English without destroying the purity of our language. I\nbelieve such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an\nEnglish compound, without violence to the ear or to the received rules of\ncomposition, as well as those which have received a sanction from the\nauthority of our best poets, and are become familiar through their use of\nthem; such as \"the cloud-compelling Jove,\" &c. As for the rest, whenever\nany can be as fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a\ncompounded one, the course to be taken is obvious.\n\nSome that cannot be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one or\ntwo words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the epithet\neinosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous translated\nliterally \"leaf-shaking,\" but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis:\n\"the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods.\" Others that admit of\ndifferent significations, may receive an advantage from a judicious\nvariation, according to the occasions on which they are introduced. For\nexample, the epithet of Apollo, hekaebolos or \"far-shooting,\" is capable\nof two explications; one literal, in respect of the darts and bow, the\nensigns of that god; the other allegorical, with regard to the rays of the\nsun; therefore, in such places where Apollo is represented as a god in\nperson, I would use the former interpretation; and where the effects of\nthe sun are described, I would make choice of the latter. Upon the whole,\nit will be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same\nepithets which we find in Homer, and which, though it might be\naccommodated (as has been already shown) to the ear of those times, is by\nno means so to ours: but one may wait for opportunities of placing them,\nwhere they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they\nare employed; and in doing this properly, a translator may at once show\nhis fancy and his judgment.\n\nAs for Homer's repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of whole\nnarrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or\nhemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these, as\nneither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor to\noffend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not ungraceful\nin those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of\ninsolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods to men, or from\nhigher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or where the ceremonial\nof religion seems to require it, in the solemn forms of prayers, oaths, or\nthe like. In other cases, I believe the best rule is, to be guided by the\nnearness, or distance, at which the repetitions are placed in the\noriginal: when they follow too close, one may vary the expression; but it\nis a question, whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any:\nif they be tedious, the author is to answer for it.\n\nIt only remains to speak of the versification. Homer (as has been said) is\nperpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every new\nsubject. This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of poetry, and\nattainable by very few: I only know of Homer eminent for it in the Greek,\nand Virgil in the Latin. I am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by\nchance, when a writer is warm, and fully possessed of his image: however,\nit may reasonably be believed they designed this, in whose verse it so\nmanifestly appears in a superior degree to all others. Few readers have\nthe ear to be judges of it: but those who have, will see I have\nendeavoured at this beauty.\n\nUpon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice\nto Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertain\nwithout much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him than any\nentire translation in verse has yet done. We have only those of Chapman,\nHobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable\nlength of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce any paraphrase\nmore loose and rambling than his. He has frequent interpolations of four\nor six lines; and I remember one in the thirteenth book of the Odyssey,\nver. 312, where he has spun twenty verses out of two. He is often mistaken\nin so bold a manner, that one might think he deviated on purpose, if he\ndid not in other places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles.\nHe appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out\nof his author; insomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of\nthe mysteries he had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured to\nstrain the obvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in\nfustian; a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as\nin the tragedy of Bussy d'Amboise, &c. In a word, the nature of the man\nmay account for his whole performance; for he appears, from his preface\nand remarks, to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in\npoetry. His own boast, of having finished half the Iliad in less than\nfifteen weeks, shows with what negligence his version was performed. But\nthat which is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover\nhis defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation, which\nis something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have writ\nbefore he arrived at years of discretion.\n\nHobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general; but for\nparticulars and circumstances he continually lops them, and often omits\nthe most beautiful. As for its being esteemed a close translation, I doubt\nnot many have been led into that error by the shortness of it, which\nproceeds not from his following the original line by line, but from the\ncontractions above mentioned. He sometimes omits whole similes and\nsentences; and is now and then guilty of mistakes, into which no writer of\nhis learning could have fallen, but through carelessness. His poetry, as\nwell as Ogilby's, is too mean for criticism.\n\nIt is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live to\ntranslate the Iliad. He has left us only the first book, and a small part\nof the sixth; in which if he has in some places not truly interpreted the\nsense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be excused on account of\nthe haste he was obliged to write in. He seems to have had too much regard\nto Chapman, whose words he sometimes copies, and has unhappily followed\nhim in passages where he wanders from the original. However, had he\ntranslated the whole work, I would no more have attempted Homer after him\nthan Virgil: his version of whom (notwithstanding some human errors) is\nthe most noble and spirited translation I know in any language. But the\nfate of great geniuses is like that of great ministers: though they are\nconfessedly the first in the commonwealth of letters, they must be envied\nand calumniated only for being at the head of it.\n\nThat which, in my opinion, ought to be the endeavour of any one who\ntranslates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire\nwhich makes his chief character: in particular places, where the sense can\nbear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as most\nagreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of his\nstyle, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve, in the\nmore active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the more\nsedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a fulness\nand perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity; not to neglect\neven the little figures and turns on the words, nor sometimes the very\ncast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs of\nantiquity: perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compass\nthan has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preserved\neither the sense or poetry. What I would further recommend to him is, to\nstudy his author rather from his own text, than from any commentaries, how\nlearned soever, or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the\nworld; to consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the\nancients, and with Milton above all the moderns. Next these, the\nArchbishop of Cambray's Telemachus may give him the truest idea of the\nspirit and turn of our author; and Bossu's admirable Treatise of the Epic\nPoem the justest notion of his design and conduct. But after all, with\nwhatever judgment and study a man may proceed, or with whatever happiness\nhe may perform such a work, he must hope to please but a few; those only\nwho have at once a taste of poetry, and competent learning. For to satisfy\nsuch a want either, is not in the nature of this undertaking; since a mere\nmodern wit can like nothing that is not modern, and a pedant nothing that\nis not Greek.\n\nWhat I have done is submitted to the public; from whose opinions I am\nprepared to learn; though I fear no judges so little as our best poets,\nwho are most sensible of the weight of this task. As for the worst,\nwhatever they shall please to say, they may give me some concern as they\nare unhappy men, but none as they are malignant writers. I was guided in\nthis translation by judgments very different from theirs, and by persons\nfor whom they can have no kindness, if an old observation be true, that\nthe strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit. Mr.\nAddison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake this task;\nwho was pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms as I\ncannot repeat without vanity. I was obliged to Sir Richard Steele for a\nvery early recommendation of my undertaking to the public. Dr. Swift\npromoted my interest with that warmth with which he always serves his\nfriend. The humanity and frankness of Sir Samuel Garth are what I never\nknew wanting on any occasion. I must also acknowledge, with infinite\npleasure, the many friendly offices, as well as sincere criticisms, of Mr.\nCongreve, who had led me the way in translating some parts of Homer. I\nmust add the names of Mr. Rowe, and Dr. Parnell, though I shall take a\nfurther opportunity of doing justice to the last, whose good nature (to\ngive it a great panegyric), is no less extensive than his learning. The\nfavour of these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them\nso true an affection. But what can I say of the honour so many of the\ngreat have done me; while the first names of the age appear as my\nsubscribers, and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning\nas my chief encouragers? Among these it is a particular pleasure to me to\nfind, that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to\nthe name of poet: that his grace the Duke of Buckingham was not displeased\nI should undertake the author to whom he has given (in his excellent\nEssay), so complete a praise:\n\n  \"Read Homer once, and you can read no more;\n  For all books else appear so mean, so poor,\n  Verse will seem prose: but still persist to read,\n  And Homer will be all the books you need.\"\n\nThat the Earl of Halifax was one of the first to favour me; of whom it is\nhard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to\nhis generosity or his example: that such a genius as my Lord Bolingbroke,\nnot more distinguished in the great scenes of business, than in all the\nuseful and entertaining parts of learning, has not refused to be the\ncritic of these sheets, and the patron of their writer: and that the noble\nauthor of the tragedy of \"Heroic Love\" has continued his partiality to me,\nfrom my writing pastorals to my attempting the Iliad. I cannot deny myself\nthe pride of confessing, that I have had the advantage not only of their\nadvice for the conduct in general, but their correction of several\nparticulars of this translation.\n\nI could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the\nEarl of Carnarvon; but it is almost absurd to particularize any one\ngenerous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of\nthem. Mr. Stanhope, the present secretary of state, will pardon my desire\nof having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair. The\nparticular zeal of Mr. Harcourt (the son of the late Lord Chancellor) gave\nme a proof how much I am honoured in a share of his friendship. I must\nattribute to the same motive that of several others of my friends: to whom\nall acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by the privileges of a\nfamiliar correspondence; and I am satisfied I can no way better oblige men\nof their turn than by my silence.\n\nIn short, I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted. He would have\nthought himself happy to have met the same favour at Athens that has been\nshown me by its learned rival, the University of Oxford. And I can hardly\nenvy him those pompous honours he received after death, when I reflect on\nthe enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations, and easy friendships,\nwhich make the satisfaction of life. This distinction is the more to be\nacknowledged, as it is shown to one whose pen has never gratified the\nprejudices of particular parties, or the vanities of particular men.\nWhatever the success may prove, I shall never repent of an undertaking in\nwhich I have experienced the candour and friendship of so many persons of\nmerit; and in which I hope to pass some of those years of youth that are\ngenerally lost in a circle of follies, after a manner neither wholly\nunuseful to others, nor disagreeable to myself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE ILIAD.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK I.\n\n\nARGUMENT.(40)\n\nTHE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.\n\nIn the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring\ntowns, and taken from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseis and Briseis,\nallotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles. Chryses, the\nfather of Chryseis, and priest of Apollo, comes to the Grecian camp to\nransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in the tenth year of\nthe siege. The priest being refused, and insolently dismissed by\nAgamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who inflicts a pestilence\non the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and encourages Chalcas to declare\nthe cause of it; who attributes it to the refusal of Chryseis. The king,\nbeing obliged to send back his captive, enters into a furious contest with\nAchilles, which Nestor pacifies; however, as he had the absolute command\nof the army, he seizes on Briseis in revenge. Achilles in discontent\nwithdraws himself and his forces from the rest of the Greeks; and\ncomplaining to Thetis, she supplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of\nthe wrong done to her son, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter,\ngranting her suit, incenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high, till\nthey are reconciled by the address of Vulcan.\n\nThe time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine during the\nplague, one in the council and quarrel of the princes, and twelve for\nJupiter's stay with the AEthiopians, at whose return Thetis prefers her\npetition.

The general, who is deluded\nwith the hopes of taking Troy without his assistance, but fears the army\nwas discouraged by his absence, and the late plague, as well as by the\nlength of time, contrives to make trial of their disposition by a\nstratagem. He first communicates his design to the princes in council,\nthat he would propose a return to the soldiers, and that they should put a\nstop to them if the proposal was embraced. Then he assembles the whole\nhost, and upon moving for a return to Greece, they unanimously agree to\nit, and run to prepare the ships. They are detained by the management of\nUlysses, who chastises the insolence of Thersites. The assembly is\nrecalled, several speeches made on the occasion, and at length the advice\nof Nestor followed, which was to make a general muster of the troops, and\nto divide them into their several nations, before they proceeded to\nbattle. This gives occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the\nGreeks and Trojans, and in a large catalogue.\n\nThe time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day. The scene\nlies in the Grecian camp, and upon the sea-shore; towards the end it\nremoves to Troy.\n\n  Now pleasing sleep had seal'd each mortal eye,\n  Stretch'd in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:\n  The immortals slumber'd on their thrones above;\n  All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.(76)\n  To honour Thetis' son he bends his care,\n  And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:\n  Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,\n  And thus commands the vision of the night.\n\n  \"Fly hence, deluding Dream! and light as air,(77)\n  To Agamemnon's ample tent repair.\n  Bid him in arms draw forth the embattled train,\n  Lead all his Grecians to the dusty plain.\n  Declare, e'en now 'tis given him to destroy\n  The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.\n  For now no more the gods with fate contend,\n  At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.\n  Destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,\n  And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.\"\n\n  Swift as the word the vain illusion fled,\n  Descends, and hovers o'er Atrides' head;\n  Clothed in the figure of the Pylian sage,\n  Renown'd for wisdom, and revered for age:\n  Around his temples spreads his golden wing,\n  And thus the flattering dream deceives the king.\n\n       [Illustration: JUPITER SENDING THE EVIL DREAM TO AGAMEMNON.]\n\n               JUPITER SENDING THE EVIL DREAM TO AGAMEMNON.\n\n\n  \"Canst thou, with all a monarch's cares oppress'd,\n  O Atreus' son! canst thou indulge the rest?(78)\n  Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides,\n  Directs in council, and in war presides,\n  To whom its safety a whole people owes,\n  To waste long nights in indolent repose.(79)\n  Monarch, awake!

O dire disgrace!\n  And leave unpunish'd this perfidious race?\n  Shall Troy, shall Priam, and the adulterous spouse,\n  In peace enjoy the fruits of broken vows?\n  And bravest chiefs, in Helen's quarrel slain,\n  Lie unrevenged on yon detested plain?\n  No: let my Greeks, unmoved by vain alarms,\n  Once more refulgent shine in brazen arms.\n  Haste, goddess, haste! the flying host detain,\n  Nor let one sail be hoisted on the main.\"\n\n  Pallas obeys, and from Olympus' height\n  Swift to the ships precipitates her flight.\n  Ulysses, first in public cares, she found,\n  For prudent counsel like the gods renown'd:\n  Oppress'd with generous grief the hero stood,\n  Nor drew his sable vessels to the flood.\n  \"And is it thus, divine Laertes' son,\n  Thus fly the Greeks (the martial maid begun),\n  Thus to their country bear their own disgrace,\n  And fame eternal leave to Priam's race?\n  Shall beauteous Helen still remain unfreed,\n  Still unrevenged, a thousand heroes bleed!\n  Haste, generous Ithacus! prevent the shame,\n  Recall your armies, and your chiefs reclaim.\n  Your own resistless eloquence employ,\n  And to the immortals trust the fall of Troy.\"\n\n  The voice divine confess'd the warlike maid,\n  Ulysses heard, nor uninspired obey'd:\n  Then meeting first Atrides, from his hand\n  Received the imperial sceptre of command.\n  Thus graced, attention and respect to gain,\n  He runs, he flies through all the Grecian train;\n  Each prince of name, or chief in arms approved,\n  He fired with praise, or with persuasion moved.\n\n  \"Warriors like you, with strength and wisdom bless'd,\n  By brave examples should confirm the rest.\n  The monarch's will not yet reveal'd appears;\n  He tries our courage, but resents our fears.\n  The unwary Greeks his fury may provoke;\n  Not thus the king in secret council spoke.\n  Jove loves our chief, from Jove his honour springs,\n  Beware! for dreadful is the wrath of kings.\"\n\n  But if a clamorous vile plebeian rose,\n  Him with reproof he check'd or tamed with blows.\n  \"Be still, thou slave, and to thy betters yield;\n  Unknown alike in council and in field!\n  Ye gods, what dastards would our host command!\n  Swept to the war, the lumber of a land.\n  Be silent, wretch, and think not here allow'd\n  That worst of tyrants, an usurping crowd.\n  To one sole monarch Jove commits the sway;\n  His are the laws, and him let all obey.\"(86)\n\n  With words like these the troops Ulysses ruled,\n  The loudest silenced, and the fiercest cool'd.\n  Back to the assembly roll the thronging train,\n  Desert the ships, and pour upon the plain.\n  Murmuring they move, as when old ocean roars,\n  And heaves huge surges to the trembling shores;\n  The groaning banks are burst with bellowing sound,\n  The rocks remurmur and the deeps rebound.\n  At length the tumult sinks, the noises cease,\n  And a still silence lulls the camp to peace.\n  Thersites only clamour'd in the throng,\n  Loquacious, loud, and turbulent of tongue:\n  Awed by no shame, by no respect controll'd,\n  In scandal busy, in reproaches bold:\n  With witty malice studious to defame,\n  Scorn all his joy, and laughter all his aim:--\n  But chief he gloried with licentious style\n  To lash the great, and monarchs to revile.\n  His figure such as might his soul proclaim;\n  One eye was blinking, and one leg was lame:\n  His mountain shoulders half his breast o'erspread,\n  Thin hairs bestrew'd his long misshapen head.\n  Spleen to mankind his envious heart possess'd,\n  And much he hated all, but most the best:\n  Ulysses or Achilles still his theme;\n  But royal scandal his delight supreme,\n  Long had he lived the scorn of every Greek,\n  Vex'd when he spoke, yet still they heard him speak.\n  Sharp was his voice; which in the shrillest tone,\n  Thus with injurious taunts attack'd the throne.\n\n  \"Amidst the glories of so bright a reign,\n  What moves the great Atrides to complain?\n  'Tis thine whate'er the warrior's breast inflames,\n  The golden spoil, and thine the lovely dames.\n  With all the wealth our wars and blood bestow,\n  Thy tents are crowded and thy chests o'erflow.\n  Thus at full ease in heaps of riches roll'd,\n  What grieves the monarch? Is it thirst of gold?\n  Say, shall we march with our unconquer'd powers\n  (The Greeks and I) to Ilion's hostile towers,\n  And bring the race of royal bastards here,\n  For Troy to ransom at a price too dear?\n  But safer plunder thy own host supplies;\n  Say, wouldst thou seize some valiant leader's prize?\n  Or, if thy heart to generous love be led,\n  Some captive fair, to bless thy kingly bed?\n  Whate'er our master craves submit we must,\n  Plagued with his pride, or punish'd for his lust.\n  Oh women of Achaia; men no more!\n  Hence let us fly, and let him waste his store\n  In loves and pleasures on the Phrygian shore.\n  We may be wanted on some busy day,\n  When Hector comes: so great Achilles may:\n  From him he forced the prize we jointly gave,\n  From him, the fierce, the fearless, and the brave:\n  And durst he, as he ought, resent that wrong,\n  This mighty tyrant were no tyrant long.\"\n\n  Fierce from his seat at this Ulysses springs,(87)\n  In generous vengeance of the king of kings.\n  With indignation sparkling in his eyes,\n  He views the wretch, and sternly thus replies:\n\n  \"Peace, factious monster, born to vex the state,\n  With wrangling talents form'd for foul debate:\n  Curb that impetuous tongue, nor rashly vain,\n  And singly mad, asperse the sovereign reign.\n  Have we not known thee, slave!

let me perish on this hateful shore,\n  And let these eyes behold my son no more;\n  If, on thy next offence, this hand forbear\n  To strip those arms thou ill deserv'st to wear,\n  Expel the council where our princes meet,\n  And send thee scourged and howling through the fleet.\"\n\n  He said, and cowering as the dastard bends,\n  The weighty sceptre on his bank descends.(88)\n  On the round bunch the bloody tumours rise:\n  The tears spring starting from his haggard eyes;\n  Trembling he sat, and shrunk in abject fears,\n  From his vile visage wiped the scalding tears;\n  While to his neighbour each express'd his thought:\n\n  \"Ye gods! what wonders has Ulysses wrought!\n  What fruits his conduct and his courage yield!\n  Great in the council, glorious in the field.\n  Generous he rises in the crown's defence,\n  To curb the factious tongue of insolence,\n  Such just examples on offenders shown,\n  Sedition silence, and assert the throne.\"\n\n  'Twas thus the general voice the hero praised,\n  Who, rising, high the imperial sceptre raised:\n  The blue-eyed Pallas, his celestial friend,\n  (In form a herald,) bade the crowds attend.\n  The expecting crowds in still attention hung,\n  To hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue.\n  Then deeply thoughtful, pausing ere he spoke,\n  His silence thus the prudent hero broke:\n\n  \"Unhappy monarch! whom the Grecian race\n  With shame deserting, heap with vile disgrace.\n  Not such at Argos was their generous vow:\n  Once all their voice, but ah! forgotten now:\n  Ne'er to return, was then the common cry,\n  Till Troy's proud structures should in ashes lie.\n  Behold them weeping for their native shore;\n  What could their wives or helpless children more?\n  What heart but melts to leave the tender train,\n  And, one short month, endure the wintry main?\n  Few leagues removed, we wish our peaceful seat,\n  When the ship tosses, and the tempests beat:\n  Then well may this long stay provoke their tears,\n  The tedious length of nine revolving years.\n  Not for their grief the Grecian host I blame;\n  But vanquish'd! baffled! oh, eternal shame!\n  Expect the time to Troy's destruction given.\n  And try the faith of Chalcas and of heaven.\n  What pass'd at Aulis, Greece can witness bear,(89)\n  And all who live to breathe this Phrygian air.\n  Beside a fountain's sacred brink we raised\n  Our verdant altars, and the victims blazed:\n  'Twas where the plane-tree spread its shades around,\n  The altars heaved; and from the crumbling ground\n  A mighty dragon shot, of dire portent;\n  From Jove himself the dreadful sign was sent.\n  Straight to the tree his sanguine spires he roll'd,\n  And curl'd around in many a winding fold;\n  The topmost branch a mother-bird possess'd;\n  Eight callow infants fill'd the mossy nest;\n  Herself the ninth; the serpent, as he hung,\n  Stretch'd his black jaws and crush'd the crying young;\n  While hovering near, with miserable moan,\n  The drooping mother wail'd her children gone.\n  The mother last, as round the nest she flew,\n  Seized by the beating wing, the monster slew;\n  Nor long survived: to marble turn'd, he stands\n  A lasting prodigy on Aulis' sands.\n  Such was the will of Jove; and hence we dare\n  Trust in his omen, and support the war.\n  For while around we gazed with wondering eyes,\n  And trembling sought the powers with sacrifice,\n  Full of his god, the reverend Chalcas cried,(90)\n  'Ye Grecian warriors! lay your fears aside.\n  This wondrous signal Jove himself displays,\n  Of long, long labours, but eternal praise.\n  As many birds as by the snake were slain,\n  So many years the toils of Greece remain;\n  But wait the tenth, for Ilion's fall decreed:'\n  Thus spoke the prophet, thus the Fates succeed.\n  Obey, ye Grecians! with submission wait,\n  Nor let your flight avert the Trojan fate.\"\n  He said: the shores with loud applauses sound,\n  The hollow ships each deafening shout rebound.\n  Then Nestor thus--\"These vain debates forbear,\n  Ye talk like children, not like heroes dare.\n  Where now are all your high resolves at last?\n  Your leagues concluded, your engagements past?\n  Vow'd with libations and with victims then,\n  Now vanish'd like their smoke: the faith of men!\n  While useless words consume the unactive hours,\n  No wonder Troy so long resists our powers.\n  Rise, great Atrides! and with courage sway;\n  We march to war, if thou direct the way.\n  But leave the few that dare resist thy laws,\n  The mean deserters of the Grecian cause,\n  To grudge the conquests mighty Jove prepares,\n  And view with envy our successful wars.\n  On that great day, when first the martial train,\n  Big with the fate of Ilion, plough'd the main,\n  Jove, on the right, a prosperous signal sent,\n  And thunder rolling shook the firmament.\n  Encouraged hence, maintain the glorious strife,\n  Till every soldier grasp a Phrygian wife,\n  Till Helen's woes at full revenged appear,\n  And Troy's proud matrons render tear for tear.\n  Before that day, if any Greek invite\n  His country's troops to base, inglorious flight,\n  Stand forth that Greek! and hoist his sail to fly,\n  And die the dastard first, who dreads to die.\n  But now, O monarch! all thy chiefs advise:(91)\n  Nor what they offer, thou thyself despise.\n  Among those counsels, let not mine be vain;\n  In tribes and nations to divide thy train:\n  His separate troops let every leader call,\n  Each strengthen each, and all encourage all.\n  What chief, or soldier, of the numerous band,\n  Or bravely fights, or ill obeys command,\n  When thus distinct they war, shall soon be known\n  And what the cause of Ilion not o'erthrown;\n  If fate resists, or if our arms are slow,\n  If gods above prevent, or men below.\"\n\n  To him the king: \"How much thy years excel\n  In arts of counsel, and in speaking well!\n  O would the gods, in love to Greece, decree\n  But ten such sages as they grant in thee;\n  Such wisdom soon should Priam's force destroy,\n  And soon should fall the haughty towers of Troy!\n  But Jove forbids, who plunges those he hates\n  In fierce contention and in vain debates:\n  Now great Achilles from our aid withdraws,\n  By me provoked; a captive maid the cause:\n  If e'er as friends we join, the Trojan wall\n  Must shake, and heavy will the vengeance fall!\n  But now, ye warriors, take a short repast;\n  And, well refresh'd, to bloody conflict haste.\n  His sharpen'd spear let every Grecian wield,\n  And every Grecian fix his brazen shield,\n  Let all excite the fiery steeds of war,\n  And all for combat fit the rattling car.\n  This day, this dreadful day, let each contend;\n  No rest, no respite, till the shades descend;\n  Till darkness, or till death, shall cover all:\n  Let the war bleed, and let the mighty fall;\n  Till bathed in sweat be every manly breast,\n  With the huge shield each brawny arm depress'd,\n  Each aching nerve refuse the lance to throw,\n  And each spent courser at the chariot blow.\n  Who dares, inglorious, in his ships to stay,\n  Who dares to tremble on this signal day;\n  That wretch, too mean to fall by martial power,\n  The birds shall mangle, and the dogs devour.\"\n\n  The monarch spoke; and straight a murmur rose,\n  Loud as the surges when the tempest blows,\n  That dash'd on broken rocks tumultuous roar,\n  And foam and thunder on the stony shore.\n  Straight to the tents the troops dispersing bend,\n  The fires are kindled, and the smokes ascend;\n  With hasty feasts they sacrifice, and pray,\n  To avert the dangers of the doubtful day.\n  A steer of five years' age, large limb'd, and fed,(92)\n  To Jove's high altars Agamemnon led:\n  There bade the noblest of the Grecian peers;\n  And Nestor first, as most advanced in years.\n  Next came Idomeneus,(93)\n  and Tydeus' son,(94)\n  Ajax the less, and Ajax Telamon;(95)\n  Then wise Ulysses in his rank was placed;\n  And Menelaus came, unbid, the last.(96)\n  The chiefs surround the destined beast, and take\n  The sacred offering of the salted cake:\n  When thus the king prefers his solemn prayer;\n  \"O thou! whose thunder rends the clouded air,\n  Who in the heaven of heavens hast fixed thy throne,\n  Supreme of gods! unbounded, and alone!\n  Hear! and before the burning sun descends,\n  Before the night her gloomy veil extends,\n  Low in the dust be laid yon hostile spires,\n  Be Priam's palace sunk in Grecian fires.\n  In Hector's breast be plunged this shining sword,\n  And slaughter'd heroes groan around their lord!\"\n\n  Thus prayed the chief: his unavailing prayer\n  Great Jove refused, and toss'd in empty air:\n  The God averse, while yet the fumes arose,\n  Prepared new toils, and doubled woes on woes.\n  Their prayers perform'd the chiefs the rite pursue,\n  The barley sprinkled, and the victim slew.\n  The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide,\n  The thighs, selected to the gods, divide.\n  On these, in double cauls involved with art,\n  The choicest morsels lie from every part,\n  From the cleft wood the crackling flames aspire\n  While the fat victims feed the sacred fire.\n  The thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress'd\n  The assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest;\n  Then spread the tables, the repast prepare,\n  Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.\n  Soon as the rage of hunger was suppress'd,\n  The generous Nestor thus the prince address'd.\n\n  \"Now bid thy heralds sound the loud alarms,\n  And call the squadrons sheathed in brazen arms;\n  Now seize the occasion, now the troops survey,\n  And lead to war when heaven directs the way.\"\n\n  He said; the monarch issued his commands;\n  Straight the loud heralds call the gathering bands\n  The chiefs inclose their king; the hosts divide,\n  In tribes and nations rank'd on either side.\n  High in the midst the blue-eyed virgin flies;\n  From rank to rank she darts her ardent eyes;\n  The dreadful aegis, Jove's immortal shield,\n  Blazed on her arm, and lighten'd all the field:\n  Round the vast orb a hundred serpents roll'd,\n  Form'd the bright fringe, and seem'd to burn in gold,\n  With this each Grecian's manly breast she warms,\n  Swells their bold hearts, and strings their nervous arms,\n  No more they sigh, inglorious, to return,\n  But breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.\n\n  As on some mountain, through the lofty grove,\n  The crackling flames ascend, and blaze above;\n  The fires expanding, as the winds arise,\n  Shoot their long beams, and kindle half the skies:\n  So from the polish'd arms, and brazen shields,\n  A gleamy splendour flash'd along the fields.\n  Not less their number than the embodied cranes,\n  Or milk-white swans in Asius' watery plains.\n  That, o'er the windings of Cayster's springs,(97)\n  Stretch their long necks, and clap their rustling wings,\n  Now tower aloft, and course in airy rounds,\n  Now light with noise; with noise the field resounds.\n  Thus numerous and confused, extending wide,\n  The legions crowd Scamander's flowery side;(98)\n  With rushing troops the plains are cover'd o'er,\n  And thundering footsteps shake the sounding shore.\n  Along the river's level meads they stand,\n  Thick as in spring the flowers adorn the land,\n  Or leaves the trees; or thick as insects play,\n  The wandering nation of a summer's day:\n  That, drawn by milky steams, at evening hours,\n  In gather'd swarms surround the rural bowers;\n  From pail to pail with busy murmur run\n  The gilded legions, glittering in the sun.\n  So throng'd, so close, the Grecian squadrons stood\n  In radiant arms, and thirst for Trojan blood.\n  Each leader now his scatter'd force conjoins\n  In close array, and forms the deepening lines.\n  Not with more ease the skilful shepherd-swain\n  Collects his flocks from thousands on the plain.\n  The king of kings, majestically tall,\n  Towers o'er his armies, and outshines them all;\n  Like some proud bull, that round the pastures leads\n  His subject herds, the monarch of the meads,\n  Great as the gods, the exalted chief was seen,\n  His strength like Neptune, and like Mars his mien;(99)\n  Jove o'er his eyes celestial glories spread,\n  And dawning conquest played around his head.\n\n  Say, virgins, seated round the throne divine,\n  All-knowing goddesses!

Iris is sent to call Helen to behold the fight. She leads her\nto the walls of Troy, where Priam sat with his counsellers observing the\nGrecian leaders on the plain below, to whom Helen gives an account of the\nchief of them. The kings on either part take the solemn oath for the\nconditions of the combat. The duel ensues; wherein Paris being overcome,\nhe is snatched away in a cloud by Venus, and transported to his apartment.\nShe then calls Helen from the walls, and brings the lovers together.\nAgamemnon, on the part of the Grecians, demands the restoration of Helen,\nand the performance of the articles.\n\nThe three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout this book. The\nscene is sometimes in the fields before Troy, and sometimes in Troy\nitself.\n\n  Thus by their leaders' care each martial band\n  Moves into ranks, and stretches o'er the land.\n  With shouts the Trojans, rushing from afar,\n  Proclaim their motions, and provoke the war\n  So when inclement winters vex the plain\n  With piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain,\n  To warmer seas the cranes embodied fly,(108)\n  With noise, and order, through the midway sky;\n  To pigmy nations wounds and death they bring,\n  And all the war descends upon the wing,\n  But silent, breathing rage, resolved and skill'd(109)\n  By mutual aids to fix a doubtful field,\n  Swift march the Greeks: the rapid dust around\n  Darkening arises from the labour'd ground.\n  Thus from his flaggy wings when Notus sheds\n  A night of vapours round the mountain heads,\n  Swift-gliding mists the dusky fields invade,\n  To thieves more grateful than the midnight shade;\n  While scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey,\n  Lost and confused amidst the thicken'd day:\n  So wrapp'd in gathering dust, the Grecian train,\n  A moving cloud, swept on, and hid the plain.\n\n  Now front to front the hostile armies stand,\n  Eager of fight, and only wait command;\n  When, to the van, before the sons of fame\n  Whom Troy sent forth, the beauteous Paris came:\n  In form a god! the panther's speckled hide\n  Flow'd o'er his armour with an easy pride:\n  His bended bow across his shoulders flung,\n  His sword beside him negligently hung;\n  Two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace,\n  And dared the bravest of the Grecian race.\n\n  As thus, with glorious air and proud disdain,\n  He boldly stalk'd, the foremost on the plain,\n  Him Menelaus, loved of Mars, espies,\n  With heart elated, and with joyful eyes:\n  So joys a lion, if the branching deer,\n  Or mountain goat, his bulky prize, appear;\n  Eager he seizes and devours the slain,\n  Press'd by bold youths and baying dogs in vain.\n  Thus fond of vengeance, with a furious bound,\n  In clanging arms he leaps upon the ground\n  From his high chariot: him, approaching near,\n  The beauteous champion views with marks of fear,\n  Smit with a conscious sense, retires behind,\n  And shuns the fate he well deserved to find.\n  As when some shepherd, from the rustling trees(110)\n  Shot forth to view, a scaly serpent sees,\n  Trembling and pale, he starts with wild affright\n  And all confused precipitates his flight:\n  So from the king the shining warrior flies,\n  And plunged amid the thickest Trojans lies.\n\n  As godlike Hector sees the prince retreat,\n  He thus upbraids him with a generous heat:\n  \"Unhappy Paris! but to women brave!(111)\n  So fairly form'd, and only to deceive!\n  Oh, hadst thou died when first thou saw'st the light,\n  Or died at least before thy nuptial rite!\n  A better fate than vainly thus to boast,\n  And fly, the scandal of thy Trojan host.\n  Gods! how the scornful Greeks exult to see\n  Their fears of danger undeceived in thee!\n  Thy figure promised with a martial air,\n  But ill thy soul supplies a form so fair.\n  In former days, in all thy gallant pride,\n  When thy tall ships triumphant stemm'd the tide,\n  When Greece beheld thy painted canvas flow,\n  And crowds stood wondering at the passing show,\n  Say, was it thus, with such a baffled mien,\n  You met the approaches of the Spartan queen,\n  Thus from her realm convey'd the beauteous prize,\n  And both her warlike lords outshined in Helen's eyes?\n  This deed, thy foes' delight, thy own disgrace,\n  Thy father's grief, and ruin of thy race;\n  This deed recalls thee to the proffer'd fight;\n  Or hast thou injured whom thou dar'st not right?\n  Soon to thy cost the field would make thee know\n  Thou keep'st the consort of a braver foe.\n  Thy graceful form instilling soft desire,\n  Thy curling tresses, and thy silver lyre,\n  Beauty and youth; in vain to these you trust,\n  When youth and beauty shall be laid in dust:\n  Troy yet may wake, and one avenging blow\n  Crush the dire author of his country's woe.\"\n\n  His silence here, with blushes, Paris breaks:\n  \"'Tis just, my brother, what your anger speaks:\n  But who like thee can boast a soul sedate,\n  So firmly proof to all the shocks of fate?\n  Thy force, like steel, a temper'd hardness shows,\n  Still edged to wound, and still untired with blows,\n  Like steel, uplifted by some strenuous swain,\n  With falling woods to strew the wasted plain.\n  Thy gifts I praise; nor thou despise the charms\n  With which a lover golden Venus arms;\n  Soft moving speech, and pleasing outward show,\n  No wish can gain them, but the gods bestow.\n  Yet, would'st thou have the proffer'd combat stand,\n  The Greeks and Trojans seat on either hand;\n  Then let a midway space our hosts divide,\n  And, on that stage of war, the cause be tried:\n  By Paris there the Spartan king be fought,\n  For beauteous Helen and the wealth she brought;\n  And who his rival can in arms subdue,\n  His be the fair, and his the treasure too.\n  Thus with a lasting league your toils may cease,\n  And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace;\n  Thus may the Greeks review their native shore,\n  Much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more.\"\n\n  He said. The challenge Hector heard with joy,\n  Then with his spear restrain'd the youth of Troy,\n  Held by the midst, athwart; and near the foe\n  Advanced with steps majestically slow:\n  While round his dauntless head the Grecians pour\n  Their stones and arrows in a mingled shower.\n\n  Then thus the monarch, great Atrides, cried:\n  \"Forbear, ye warriors! lay the darts aside:\n  A parley Hector asks, a message bears;\n  We know him by the various plume he wears.\"\n  Awed by his high command the Greeks attend,\n  The tumult silence, and the fight suspend.\n\n  While from the centre Hector rolls his eyes\n  On either host, and thus to both applies:\n  \"Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,\n  What Paris, author of the war, demands.\n  Your shining swords within the sheath restrain,\n  And pitch your lances in the yielding plain.\n  Here in the midst, in either army's sight,\n  He dares the Spartan king to single fight;\n  And wills that Helen and the ravish'd spoil,\n  That caused the contest, shall reward the toil.\n  Let these the brave triumphant victor grace,\n  And different nations part in leagues of peace.\"\n\n  He spoke: in still suspense on either side\n  Each army stood: the Spartan chief replied:\n\n  \"Me too, ye warriors, hear, whose fatal right\n  A world engages in the toils of fight.\n  To me the labour of the field resign;\n  Me Paris injured; all the war be mine.\n  Fall he that must, beneath his rival's arms;\n  And live the rest, secure of future harms.\n  Two lambs, devoted by your country's rite,\n  To earth a sable, to the sun a white,\n  Prepare, ye Trojans!

what majestic mien!\n  She moves a goddess, and she looks a queen!\n  Yet hence, O Heaven, convey that fatal face,\n  And from destruction save the Trojan race.\"\n\n  The good old Priam welcomed her, and cried,\n  \"Approach, my child, and grace thy father's side.\n  See on the plain thy Grecian spouse appears,\n  The friends and kindred of thy former years.\n  No crime of thine our present sufferings draws,\n  Not thou, but Heaven's disposing will, the cause\n  The gods these armies and this force employ,\n  The hostile gods conspire the fate of Troy.\n  But lift thy eyes, and say, what Greek is he\n  (Far as from hence these aged orbs can see)\n  Around whose brow such martial graces shine,\n  So tall, so awful, and almost divine!\n  Though some of larger stature tread the green,\n  None match his grandeur and exalted mien:\n  He seems a monarch, and his country's pride.\"\n  Thus ceased the king, and thus the fair replied:\n\n  \"Before thy presence, father, I appear,\n  With conscious shame and reverential fear.\n  Ah! had I died, ere to these walk I fled,\n  False to my country, and my nuptial bed;\n  My brothers, friends, and daughter left behind,\n  False to them all, to Paris only kind!\n  For this I mourn, till grief or dire disease\n  Shall waste the form whose fault it was to please!\n  The king of kings, Atrides, you survey,\n  Great in the war, and great in arts of sway:\n  My brother once, before my days of shame!\n  And oh! that still he bore a brother's name!\"\n\n  With wonder Priam view'd the godlike man,\n  Extoll'd the happy prince, and thus began:\n  \"O bless'd Atrides! born to prosperous fate,\n  Successful monarch of a mighty state!\n  How vast thy empire! Of your matchless train\n  What numbers lost, what numbers yet remain!\n  In Phrygia once were gallant armies known,\n  In ancient time, when Otreus fill'd the throne,\n  When godlike Mygdon led their troops of horse,\n  And I, to join them, raised the Trojan force:\n  Against the manlike Amazons we stood,(114)\n  And Sangar's stream ran purple with their blood.\n  But far inferior those, in martial grace,\n  And strength of numbers, to this Grecian race.\"\n\n  This said, once more he view'd the warrior train;\n  \"What's he, whose arms lie scatter'd on the plain?\n  Broad is his breast, his shoulders larger spread,\n  Though great Atrides overtops his head.\n  Nor yet appear his care and conduct small;\n  From rank to rank he moves, and orders all.\n  The stately ram thus measures o'er the ground,\n  And, master of the flock, surveys them round.\"\n\n  Then Helen thus: \"Whom your discerning eyes\n  Have singled out, is Ithacus the wise;\n  A barren island boasts his glorious birth;\n  His fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth.\"\n\n  Antenor took the word, and thus began:(115)\n  \"Myself, O king! have seen that wondrous man\n  When, trusting Jove and hospitable laws,\n  To Troy he came, to plead the Grecian cause;\n  (Great Menelaus urged the same request;)\n  My house was honour'd with each royal guest:\n  I knew their persons, and admired their parts,\n  Both brave in arms, and both approved in arts.\n  Erect, the Spartan most engaged our view;\n  Ulysses seated, greater reverence drew.\n  When Atreus' son harangued the listening train,\n  Just was his sense, and his expression plain,\n  His words succinct, yet full, without a fault;\n  He spoke no more than just the thing he ought.\n  But when Ulysses rose, in thought profound,(116)\n  His modest eyes he fix'd upon the ground;\n  As one unskill'd or dumb, he seem'd to stand,\n  Nor raised his head, nor stretch'd his sceptred hand;\n  But, when he speaks, what elocution flows!\n  Soft as the fleeces of descending snows,(117)\n  The copious accents fall, with easy art;\n  Melting they fall, and sink into the heart!\n  Wondering we hear, and fix'd in deep surprise,\n  Our ears refute the censure of our eyes.\"\n\n  The king then ask'd (as yet the camp he view'd)\n  \"What chief is that, with giant strength endued,\n  Whose brawny shoulders, and whose swelling chest,\n  And lofty stature, far exceed the rest?\n  \"Ajax the great, (the beauteous queen replied,)\n  Himself a host: the Grecian strength and pride.\n  See! bold Idomeneus superior towers\n  Amid yon circle of his Cretan powers,\n  Great as a god!

If, by Paris slain,\n  Great Menelaus press the fatal plain;\n  The dame and treasures let the Trojan keep,\n  And Greece returning plough the watery deep.\n  If by my brother's lance the Trojan bleed,\n  Be his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed:\n  The appointed fine let Ilion justly pay,\n  And every age record the signal day.\n  This if the Phrygians shall refuse to yield,\n  Arms must revenge, and Mars decide the field.\"\n\n  With that the chief the tender victims slew,\n  And in the dust their bleeding bodies threw;\n  The vital spirit issued at the wound,\n  And left the members quivering on the ground.\n  From the same urn they drink the mingled wine,\n  And add libations to the powers divine.\n  While thus their prayers united mount the sky,\n  \"Hear, mighty Jove! and hear, ye gods on high!\n  And may their blood, who first the league confound,\n  Shed like this wine, disdain the thirsty ground;\n  May all their consorts serve promiscuous lust,\n  And all their lust be scatter'd as the dust!\"\n  Thus either host their imprecations join'd,\n  Which Jove refused, and mingled with the wind.\n\n  The rites now finish'd, reverend Priam rose,\n  And thus express'd a heart o'ercharged with woes:\n  \"Ye Greeks and Trojans, let the chiefs engage,\n  But spare the weakness of my feeble age:\n  In yonder walls that object let me shun,\n  Nor view the danger of so dear a son.\n  Whose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fall,\n  Heaven only knows; for heaven disposes all.\"\n\n  This said, the hoary king no longer stay'd,\n  But on his car the slaughter'd victims laid:\n  Then seized the reins his gentle steeds to guide,\n  And drove to Troy, Antenor at his side.\n\n  Bold Hector and Ulysses now dispose\n  The lists of combat, and the ground inclose:\n  Next to decide, by sacred lots prepare,\n  Who first shall launch his pointed spear in air.\n  The people pray with elevated hands,\n  And words like these are heard through all the bands:\n  \"Immortal Jove, high Heaven's superior lord,\n  On lofty Ida's holy mount adored!\n  Whoe'er involved us in this dire debate,\n  O give that author of the war to fate\n  And shades eternal! let division cease,\n  And joyful nations join in leagues of peace.\"\n\n  With eyes averted Hector hastes to turn\n  The lots of fight and shakes the brazen urn.\n  Then, Paris, thine leap'd forth; by fatal chance\n  Ordain'd the first to whirl the weighty lance.\n  Both armies sat the combat to survey.\n  Beside each chief his azure armour lay,\n  And round the lists the generous coursers neigh.\n  The beauteous warrior now arrays for fight,\n  In gilded arms magnificently bright:\n  The purple cuishes clasp his thighs around,\n  With flowers adorn'd, with silver buckles bound:\n  Lycaon's corslet his fair body dress'd,\n  Braced in and fitted to his softer breast;\n  A radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied,\n  Sustain'd the sword that glitter'd at his side:\n  His youthful face a polish'd helm o'erspread;\n  The waving horse-hair nodded on his head:\n  His figured shield, a shining orb, he takes,\n  And in his hand a pointed javelin shakes.\n  With equal speed and fired by equal charms,\n  The Spartan hero sheathes his limbs in arms.\n\n  Now round the lists the admiring armies stand,\n  With javelins fix'd, the Greek and Trojan band.\n  Amidst the dreadful vale, the chiefs advance,\n  All pale with rage, and shake the threatening lance.\n  The Trojan first his shining javelin threw;\n  Full on Atrides' ringing shield it flew,\n  Nor pierced the brazen orb, but with a bound(122)\n  Leap'd from the buckler, blunted, on the ground.\n  Atrides then his massy lance prepares,\n  In act to throw, but first prefers his prayers:\n\n  \"Give me, great Jove! to punish lawless lust,\n  And lay the Trojan gasping in the dust:\n  Destroy the aggressor, aid my righteous cause,\n  Avenge the breach of hospitable laws!\n  Let this example future times reclaim,\n  And guard from wrong fair friendship's holy name.\"\n  Be said, and poised in air the javelin sent,\n  Through Paris' shield the forceful weapon went,\n  His corslet pierces, and his garment rends,\n  And glancing downward, near his flank descends.\n  The wary Trojan, bending from the blow,\n  Eludes the death, and disappoints his foe:\n  But fierce Atrides waved his sword, and strook\n  Full on his casque: the crested helmet shook;\n  The brittle steel, unfaithful to his hand,\n  Broke short: the fragments glitter'd on the sand.\n  The raging warrior to the spacious skies\n  Raised his upbraiding voice and angry eyes:\n  \"Then is it vain in Jove himself to trust?\n  And is it thus the gods assist the just?\n  When crimes provoke us, Heaven success denies;\n  The dart falls harmless, and the falchion flies.\"\n  Furious he said, and towards the Grecian crew\n  (Seized by the crest) the unhappy warrior drew;\n  Struggling he followed, while the embroider'd thong\n  That tied his helmet, dragg'd the chief along.\n  Then had his ruin crown'd Atrides' joy,\n  But Venus trembled for the prince of Troy:\n  Unseen she came, and burst the golden band;\n  And left an empty helmet in his hand.\n  The casque, enraged, amidst the Greeks he threw;\n  The Greeks with smiles the polish'd trophy view.\n  Then, as once more he lifts the deadly dart,\n  In thirst of vengeance, at his rival's heart;\n  The queen of love her favour'd champion shrouds\n  (For gods can all things) in a veil of clouds.\n  Raised from the field the panting youth she led,\n  And gently laid him on the bridal bed,\n  With pleasing sweets his fainting sense renews,\n  And all the dome perfumes with heavenly dews.\n  Meantime the brightest of the female kind,\n  The matchless Helen, o'er the walls reclined;\n  To her, beset with Trojan beauties, came,\n  In borrow'd form, the laughter-loving dame.\n  (She seem'd an ancient maid, well-skill'd to cull\n  The snowy fleece, and wind the twisted wool.)\n  The goddess softly shook her silken vest,\n  That shed perfumes, and whispering thus address'd:\n\n[Illustration: VENUS, DISGUISED, INVITING HELEN TO THE CHAMBER OF PARIS.]\n\n        VENUS, DISGUISED, INVITING HELEN TO THE CHAMBER OF PARIS.\n\n\n  \"Haste, happy nymph!

In the meantime some of the Trojan troops attack the\nGreeks. Agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts of a good general; he\nreviews the troops, and exhorts the leaders, some by praises and others by\nreproof. Nestor is particularly celebrated for his military discipline.\nThe battle joins, and great numbers are slain on both sides.\n\nThe same day continues through this as through the last book (as it does\nalso through the two following, and almost to the end of the seventh\nbook).

what signal issue waits\n  To crown this deed, and finish all the fates!\n  Shall Heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare,\n  Or rouse the furies, and awake the war?\n  Yet, would the gods for human good provide,\n  Atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride,\n  Still Priam's walls in peaceful honours grow,\n  And through his gates the crowding nations flow.\"\n\n  Thus while he spoke, the queen of heaven, enraged,\n  And queen of war, in close consult engaged:\n  Apart they sit, their deep designs employ,\n  And meditate the future woes of Troy.\n  Though secret anger swell'd Minerva's breast,\n  The prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress'd;\n  But Juno, impotent of passion, broke\n  Her sullen silence, and with fury spoke:\n\n                 [Illustration: THE COUNCIL OF THE GODS.]\n\n                         THE COUNCIL OF THE GODS.\n\n\n  \"Shall then, O tyrant of the ethereal reign!\n  My schemes, my labours, and my hopes be vain?\n  Have I, for this, shook Ilion with alarms,\n  Assembled nations, set two worlds in arms?\n  To spread the war, I flew from shore to shore;\n  The immortal coursers scarce the labour bore.\n  At length ripe vengeance o'er their heads impends,\n  But Jove himself the faithless race defends.\n  Loth as thou art to punish lawless lust,\n  Not all the gods are partial and unjust.\"\n\n  The sire whose thunder shakes the cloudy skies,\n  Sighs from his inmost soul, and thus replies:\n  \"Oh lasting rancour! oh insatiate hate\n  To Phrygia's monarch, and the Phrygian state!\n  What high offence has fired the wife of Jove?\n  Can wretched mortals harm the powers above,\n  That Troy, and Troy's whole race thou wouldst confound,\n  And yon fair structures level with the ground!\n  Haste, leave the skies, fulfil thy stern desire,\n  Burst all her gates, and wrap her walls in fire!\n  Let Priam bleed! if yet you thirst for more,\n  Bleed all his sons, and Ilion float with gore:\n  To boundless vengeance the wide realm be given,\n  Till vast destruction glut the queen of heaven!\n  So let it be, and Jove his peace enjoy,(126)\n  When heaven no longer hears the name of Troy.\n  But should this arm prepare to wreak our hate\n  On thy loved realms, whose guilt demands their fate;\n  Presume not thou the lifted bolt to stay,\n  Remember Troy, and give the vengeance way.\n  For know, of all the numerous towns that rise\n  Beneath the rolling sun and starry skies,\n  Which gods have raised, or earth-born men enjoy,\n  None stands so dear to Jove as sacred Troy.\n  No mortals merit more distinguish'd grace\n  Than godlike Priam, or than Priam's race.\n  Still to our name their hecatombs expire,\n  And altars blaze with unextinguish'd fire.\"\n\n  At this the goddess rolled her radiant eyes,\n  Then on the Thunderer fix'd them, and replies:\n  \"Three towns are Juno's on the Grecian plains,\n  More dear than all the extended earth contains,\n  Mycenae, Argos, and the Spartan wall;(127)\n\n  These thou mayst raze, nor I forbid their fall:\n  'Tis not in me the vengeance to remove;\n  The crime's sufficient that they share my love.\n  Of power superior why should I complain?\n  Resent I may, but must resent in vain.\n  Yet some distinction Juno might require,\n  Sprung with thyself from one celestial sire,\n  A goddess born, to share the realms above,\n  And styled the consort of the thundering Jove;\n  Nor thou a wife and sister's right deny;(128)\n  Let both consent, and both by terms comply;\n  So shall the gods our joint decrees obey,\n  And heaven shall act as we direct the way.\n  See ready Pallas waits thy high commands\n  To raise in arms the Greek and Phrygian bands;\n  Their sudden friendship by her arts may cease,\n  And the proud Trojans first infringe the peace.\"\n\n  The sire of men and monarch of the sky\n  The advice approved, and bade Minerva fly,\n  Dissolve the league, and all her arts employ\n  To make the breach the faithless act of Troy.\n  Fired with the charge, she headlong urged her flight,\n  And shot like lightning from Olympus' height.\n  As the red comet, from Saturnius sent\n  To fright the nations with a dire portent,\n  (A fatal sign to armies on the plain,\n  Or trembling sailors on the wintry main,)\n  With sweeping glories glides along in air,\n  And shakes the sparkles from its blazing hair:(129)\n  Between both armies thus, in open sight\n  Shot the bright goddess in a trail of light,\n  With eyes erect the gazing hosts admire\n  The power descending, and the heavens on fire!\n  \"The gods (they cried), the gods this signal sent,\n  And fate now labours with some vast event:\n  Jove seals the league, or bloodier scenes prepares;\n  Jove, the great arbiter of peace and wars.\"\n\n  They said, while Pallas through the Trojan throng,\n  (In shape a mortal,) pass'd disguised along.\n  Like bold Laodocus, her course she bent,\n  Who from Antenor traced his high descent.\n  Amidst the ranks Lycaon's son she found,\n  The warlike Pandarus, for strength renown'd;\n  Whose squadrons, led from black AEsepus' flood,(130)\n  With flaming shields in martial circle stood.\n  To him the goddess: \"Phrygian! canst thou hear\n  A well-timed counsel with a willing ear?\n  What praise were thine, couldst thou direct thy dart,\n  Amidst his triumph, to the Spartan's heart?\n  What gifts from Troy, from Paris wouldst thou gain,\n  Thy country's foe, the Grecian glory slain?\n  Then seize the occasion, dare the mighty deed,\n  Aim at his breast, and may that aim succeed!\n  But first, to speed the shaft, address thy vow\n  To Lycian Phoebus with the silver bow,\n  And swear the firstlings of thy flock to pay,\n  On Zelia's altars, to the god of day.\"(131)\n\n  He heard, and madly at the motion pleased,\n  His polish'd bow with hasty rashness seized.\n  'Twas form'd of horn, and smooth'd with artful toil:\n  A mountain goat resign'd the shining spoil.\n  Who pierced long since beneath his arrows bled;\n  The stately quarry on the cliffs lay dead,\n  And sixteen palms his brow's large honours spread:\n  The workmen join'd, and shaped the bended horns,\n  And beaten gold each taper point adorns.\n  This, by the Greeks unseen, the warrior bends,\n  Screen'd by the shields of his surrounding friends:\n  There meditates the mark; and couching low,\n  Fits the sharp arrow to the well-strung bow.\n  One from a hundred feather'd deaths he chose,\n  Fated to wound, and cause of future woes;\n  Then offers vows with hecatombs to crown\n  Apollo's altars in his native town.\n\n  Now with full force the yielding horn he bends,\n  Drawn to an arch, and joins the doubling ends;\n  Close to his breast he strains the nerve below,\n  Till the barb'd points approach the circling bow;\n  The impatient weapon whizzes on the wing;\n  Sounds the tough horn, and twangs the quivering string.\n\n  But thee, Atrides! in that dangerous hour\n  The gods forget not, nor thy guardian power,\n  Pallas assists, and (weakened in its force)\n  Diverts the weapon from its destined course:\n  So from her babe, when slumber seals his eye,\n  The watchful mother wafts the envenom'd fly.\n  Just where his belt with golden buckles join'd,\n  Where linen folds the double corslet lined,\n  She turn'd the shaft, which, hissing from above,\n  Pass'd the broad belt, and through the corslet drove;\n  The folds it pierced, the plaited linen tore,\n  And razed the skin, and drew the purple gore.\n  As when some stately trappings are decreed\n  To grace a monarch on his bounding steed,\n  A nymph in Caria or Maeonia bred,\n  Stains the pure ivory with a lively red;\n  With equal lustre various colours vie,\n  The shining whiteness, and the Tyrian dye:\n  So great Atrides! show'd thy sacred blood,\n  As down thy snowy thigh distill'd the streaming flood.\n  With horror seized, the king of men descried\n  The shaft infix'd, and saw the gushing tide:\n  Nor less the Spartan fear'd, before he found\n  The shining barb appear above the wound,\n  Then, with a sigh, that heaved his manly breast,\n  The royal brother thus his grief express'd,\n  And grasp'd his hand; while all the Greeks around\n  With answering sighs return'd the plaintive sound.\n\n  \"Oh, dear as life! did I for this agree\n  The solemn truce, a fatal truce to thee!\n  Wert thou exposed to all the hostile train,\n  To fight for Greece, and conquer, to be slain!\n  The race of Trojans in thy ruin join,\n  And faith is scorn'd by all the perjured line.\n  Not thus our vows, confirm'd with wine and gore,\n  Those hands we plighted, and those oaths we swore,\n  Shall all be vain: when Heaven's revenge is slow,\n  Jove but prepares to strike the fiercer blow.\n  The day shall come, that great avenging day,\n  When Troy's proud glories in the dust shall lay,\n  When Priam's powers and Priam's self shall fall,\n  And one prodigious ruin swallow all.\n  I see the god, already, from the pole\n  Bare his red arm, and bid the thunder roll;\n  I see the Eternal all his fury shed,\n  And shake his aegis o'er their guilty head.\n  Such mighty woes on perjured princes wait;\n  But thou, alas! deserv'st a happier fate.\n  Still must I mourn the period of thy days,\n  And only mourn, without my share of praise?\n  Deprived of thee, the heartless Greeks no more\n  Shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore;\n  Troy seized of Helen, and our glory lost,\n  Thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast;\n  While some proud Trojan thus insulting cries,\n  (And spurns the dust where Menelaus lies,)\n  'Such are the trophies Greece from Ilion brings,\n  And such the conquest of her king of kings!\n  Lo his proud vessels scatter'd o'er the main,\n  And unrevenged, his mighty brother slain.'\n  Oh! ere that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,\n  O'erwhelm me, earth! and hide a monarch's shame.\"\n\n  He said: a leader's and a brother's fears\n  Possess his soul, which thus the Spartan cheers:\n  \"Let not thy words the warmth of Greece abate;\n  The feeble dart is guiltless of my fate:\n  Stiff with the rich embroider'd work around,\n  My varied belt repell'd the flying wound.\"\n\n  To whom the king: \"My brother and my friend,\n  Thus, always thus, may Heaven thy life defend!\n  Now seek some skilful hand, whose powerful art\n  May stanch the effusion, and extract the dart.\n  Herald, be swift, and bid Machaon bring\n  His speedy succour to the Spartan king;\n  Pierced with a winged shaft (the deed of Troy),\n  The Grecian's sorrow, and the Dardan's joy.\"\n\n  With hasty zeal the swift Talthybius flies;\n  Through the thick files he darts his searching eyes,\n  And finds Machaon, where sublime he stands(132)\n  In arms incircled with his native bands.\n  Then thus: \"Machaon, to the king repair,\n  His wounded brother claims thy timely care;\n  Pierced by some Lycian or Dardanian bow,\n  A grief to us, a triumph to the foe.\"\n\n  The heavy tidings grieved the godlike man\n  Swift to his succour through the ranks he ran.\n  The dauntless king yet standing firm he found,\n  And all the chiefs in deep concern around.\n  Where to the steely point the reed was join'd,\n  The shaft he drew, but left the head behind.\n  Straight the broad belt with gay embroidery graced,\n  He loosed; the corslet from his breast unbraced;\n  Then suck'd the blood, and sovereign balm infused,(133)\n  Which Chiron gave, and AEsculapius used.\n\n  While round the prince the Greeks employ their care,\n  The Trojans rush tumultuous to the war;\n  Once more they glitter in refulgent arms,\n  Once more the fields are fill'd with dire alarms.\n  Nor had you seen the king of men appear\n  Confused, unactive, or surprised with fear;\n  But fond of glory, with severe delight,\n  His beating bosom claim'd the rising fight.\n  No longer with his warlike steeds he stay'd,\n  Or press'd the car with polish'd brass inlaid\n  But left Eurymedon the reins to guide;\n  The fiery coursers snorted at his side.\n  On foot through all the martial ranks he moves\n  And these encourages, and those reproves.\n  \"Brave men!\" he cries, (to such who boldly dare\n  Urge their swift steeds to face the coming war),\n  \"Your ancient valour on the foes approve;\n  Jove is with Greece, and let us trust in Jove.\n  'Tis not for us, but guilty Troy, to dread,\n  Whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head;\n  Her sons and matrons Greece shall lead in chains,\n  And her dead warriors strew the mournful plains.\"\n\n  Thus with new ardour he the brave inspires;\n  Or thus the fearful with reproaches fires:\n  \"Shame to your country, scandal of your kind;\n  Born to the fate ye well deserve to find!\n  Why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain,\n  Prepared for flight, but doom'd to fly in vain?\n  Confused and panting thus, the hunted deer\n  Falls as he flies, a victim to his fear.\n  Still must ye wait the foes, and still retire,\n  Till yon tall vessels blaze with Trojan fire?\n  Or trust ye, Jove a valiant foe shall chase,\n  To save a trembling, heartless, dastard race?\"\n\n  This said, he stalk'd with ample strides along,\n  To Crete's brave monarch and his martial throng;\n  High at their head he saw the chief appear,\n  And bold Meriones excite the rear.\n  At this the king his generous joy express'd,\n  And clasp'd the warrior to his armed breast.\n  \"Divine Idomeneus! what thanks we owe\n  To worth like thine! what praise shall we bestow?\n  To thee the foremost honours are decreed,\n  First in the fight and every graceful deed.\n  For this, in banquets, when the generous bowls\n  Restore our blood, and raise the warriors' souls,\n  Though all the rest with stated rules we bound,\n  Unmix'd, unmeasured, are thy goblets crown'd.\n  Be still thyself, in arms a mighty name;\n  Maintain thy honours, and enlarge thy fame.\"\n  To whom the Cretan thus his speech address'd:\n  \"Secure of me, O king! exhort the rest.\n  Fix'd to thy side, in every toil I share,\n  Thy firm associate in the day of war.\n  But let the signal be this moment given;\n  To mix in fight is all I ask of Heaven.\n  The field shall prove how perjuries succeed,\n  And chains or death avenge the impious deed.\"\n\n  Charm'd with this heat, the king his course pursues,\n  And next the troops of either Ajax views:\n  In one firm orb the bands were ranged around,\n  A cloud of heroes blacken'd all the ground.\n  Thus from the lofty promontory's brow\n  A swain surveys the gathering storm below;\n  Slow from the main the heavy vapours rise,\n  Spread in dim streams, and sail along the skies,\n  Till black as night the swelling tempest shows,\n  The cloud condensing as the west-wind blows:\n  He dreads the impending storm, and drives his flock\n  To the close covert of an arching rock.\n\n  Such, and so thick, the embattled squadrons stood,\n  With spears erect, a moving iron wood:\n  A shady light was shot from glimmering shields,\n  And their brown arms obscured the dusky fields.\n\n  \"O heroes! worthy such a dauntless train,\n  Whose godlike virtue we but urge in vain,\n  (Exclaim'd the king), who raise your eager bands\n  With great examples, more than loud commands.\n  Ah! would the gods but breathe in all the rest\n  Such souls as burn in your exalted breast,\n  Soon should our arms with just success be crown'd,\n  And Troy's proud walls lie smoking on the ground.\"\n\n  Then to the next the general bends his course;\n  (His heart exults, and glories in his force);\n  There reverend Nestor ranks his Pylian bands,\n  And with inspiring eloquence commands;\n  With strictest order sets his train in arms,\n  The chiefs advises, and the soldiers warms.\n  Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, round him wait,\n  Bias the good, and Pelagon the great.\n  The horse and chariots to the front assign'd,\n  The foot (the strength of war) he ranged behind;\n  The middle space suspected troops supply,\n  Inclosed by both, nor left the power to fly;\n  He gives command to \"curb the fiery steed,\n  Nor cause confusion, nor the ranks exceed:\n  Before the rest let none too rashly ride;\n  No strength nor skill, but just in time, be tried:\n  The charge once made, no warrior turn the rein,\n  But fight, or fall; a firm embodied train.\n  He whom the fortune of the field shall cast\n  From forth his chariot, mount the next in haste;\n  Nor seek unpractised to direct the car,\n  Content with javelins to provoke the war.\n  Our great forefathers held this prudent course,\n  Thus ruled their ardour, thus preserved their force;\n  By laws like these immortal conquests made,\n  And earth's proud tyrants low in ashes laid.\"\n\n  So spoke the master of the martial art,\n  And touch'd with transport great Atrides' heart.\n  \"Oh! hadst thou strength to match thy brave desires,\n  And nerves to second what thy soul inspires!\n  But wasting years, that wither human race,\n  Exhaust thy spirits, and thy arms unbrace.\n  What once thou wert, oh ever mightst thou be!\n  And age the lot of any chief but thee.\"\n\n  Thus to the experienced prince Atrides cried;\n  He shook his hoary locks, and thus replied:\n  \"Well might I wish, could mortal wish renew(134)\n  That strength which once in boiling youth I knew;\n  Such as I was, when Ereuthalion, slain\n  Beneath this arm, fell prostrate on the plain.\n  But heaven its gifts not all at once bestows,\n  These years with wisdom crowns, with action those:\n  The field of combat fits the young and bold,\n  The solemn council best becomes the old:\n  To you the glorious conflict I resign,\n  Let sage advice, the palm of age, be mine.\"\n\n  He said. With joy the monarch march'd before,\n  And found Menestheus on the dusty shore,\n  With whom the firm Athenian phalanx stands;\n  And next Ulysses, with his subject bands.\n  Remote their forces lay, nor knew so far\n  The peace infringed, nor heard the sounds of war;\n  The tumult late begun, they stood intent\n  To watch the motion, dubious of the event.\n  The king, who saw their squadrons yet unmoved,\n  With hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved:\n\n  \"Can Peleus' son forget a warrior's part.\n  And fears Ulysses, skill'd in every art?\n  Why stand you distant, and the rest expect\n  To mix in combat which yourselves neglect?\n  From you 'twas hoped among the first to dare\n  The shock of armies, and commence the war;\n  For this your names are call'd before the rest,\n  To share the pleasures of the genial feast:\n  And can you, chiefs! without a blush survey\n  Whole troops before you labouring in the fray?\n  Say, is it thus those honours you requite?\n  The first in banquets, but the last in fight.\"\n\n  Ulysses heard: the hero's warmth o'erspread\n  His cheek with blushes: and severe, he said:\n  \"Take back the unjust reproach! Behold we stand\n  Sheathed in bright arms, and but expect command.\n  If glorious deeds afford thy soul delight,\n  Behold me plunging in the thickest fight.\n  Then give thy warrior-chief a warrior's due,\n  Who dares to act whate'er thou dar'st to view.\"\n  Struck with his generous wrath, the king replies:\n\n  \"O great in action, and in council wise!\n  With ours, thy care and ardour are the same,\n  Nor need I to commend, nor aught to blame.\n  Sage as thou art, and learn'd in human kind,\n  Forgive the transport of a martial mind.\n  Haste to the fight, secure of just amends;\n  The gods that make, shall keep the worthy, friends.\"\n\n  He said, and pass'd where great Tydides lay,\n  His steeds and chariots wedged in firm array;\n  (The warlike Sthenelus attends his side;)(135)\n  To whom with stern reproach the monarch cried:\n  \"O son of Tydeus! (he, whose strength could tame\n  The bounding steed, in arms a mighty name)\n  Canst thou, remote, the mingling hosts descry,\n  With hands unactive, and a careless eye?\n  Not thus thy sire the fierce encounter fear'd;\n  Still first in front the matchless prince appear'd:\n  What glorious toils, what wonders they recite,\n  Who view'd him labouring through the ranks of fight?\n  I saw him once, when gathering martial powers,\n  A peaceful guest, he sought Mycenae's towers;\n  Armies he ask'd, and armies had been given,\n  Not we denied, but Jove forbade from heaven;\n  While dreadful comets glaring from afar,\n  Forewarn'd the horrors of the Theban war.(136)\n  Next, sent by Greece from where Asopus flows,\n  A fearless envoy, he approach'd the foes;\n  Thebes' hostile walls unguarded and alone,\n  Dauntless he enters, and demands the throne.\n  The tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found,\n  And dared to combat all those chiefs around:\n  Dared, and subdued before their haughty lord;\n  For Pallas strung his arm and edged his sword.\n  Stung with the shame, within the winding way,\n  To bar his passage fifty warriors lay;\n  Two heroes led the secret squadron on,\n  Mason the fierce, and hardy Lycophon;\n  Those fifty slaughter'd in the gloomy vale.\n  He spared but one to bear the dreadful tale,\n  Such Tydeus was, and such his martial fire;\n  Gods! how the son degenerates from the sire!\"\n\n  No words the godlike Diomed return'd,\n  But heard respectful, and in secret burn'd:\n  Not so fierce Capaneus' undaunted son;\n  Stern as his sire, the boaster thus begun:\n\n  \"What needs, O monarch!

dire sister of the slaughtering power,\n  Small at her birth, but rising every hour,\n  While scarce the skies her horrid head can bound,\n  She stalks on earth, and shakes the world around;(139)\n  The nations bleed, where'er her steps she turns,\n  The groan still deepens, and the combat burns.\n\n  Now shield with shield, with helmet helmet closed,\n  To armour armour, lance to lance opposed,\n  Host against host with shadowy squadrons drew,\n  The sounding darts in iron tempests flew,\n  Victors and vanquish'd join'd promiscuous cries,\n  And shrilling shouts and dying groans arise;\n  With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,\n  And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.\n\n  As torrents roll, increased by numerous rills,\n  With rage impetuous, down their echoing hills\n  Rush to the vales, and pour'd along the plain.\n  Roar through a thousand channels to the main:\n  The distant shepherd trembling hears the sound;\n  So mix both hosts, and so their cries rebound.\n\n  The bold Antilochus the slaughter led,\n  The first who struck a valiant Trojan dead:\n  At great Echepolus the lance arrives,\n  Razed his high crest, and through his helmet drives;\n  Warm'd in the brain the brazen weapon lies,\n  And shades eternal settle o'er his eyes.\n  So sinks a tower, that long assaults had stood\n  Of force and fire, its walls besmear'd with blood.\n  Him, the bold leader of the Abantian throng,(140)\n  Seized to despoil, and dragg'd the corpse along:\n  But while he strove to tug the inserted dart,\n  Agenor's javelin reach'd the hero's heart.\n  His flank, unguarded by his ample shield,\n  Admits the lance: he falls, and spurns the field;\n  The nerves, unbraced, support his limbs no more;\n  The soul comes floating in a tide of gore.\n  Trojans and Greeks now gather round the slain;\n  The war renews, the warriors bleed again:\n  As o'er their prey rapacious wolves engage,\n  Man dies on man, and all is blood and rage.\n\n  In blooming youth fair Simoisius fell,\n  Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell;\n  Fair Simoisius, whom his mother bore\n  Amid the flocks on silver Simois' shore:\n  The nymph descending from the hills of Ide,\n  To seek her parents on his flowery side,\n  Brought forth the babe, their common care and joy,\n  And thence from Simois named the lovely boy.\n  Short was his date!

AEneas joins Pandarus to oppose him;\nPandarus is killed, and AEneas in great danger but for the assistance of\nVenus; who, as she is removing her son from the fight, is wounded on the\nhand by Diomed. Apollo seconds her in his rescue, and at length carries\noff AEneas to Troy, where he is healed in the temple of Pergamus. Mars\nrallies the Trojans, and assists Hector to make a stand. In the meantime\nAEneas is restored to the field, and they overthrow several of the Greeks;\namong the rest Tlepolemus is slain by Sarpedon. Juno and Minerva descend\nto resist Mars; the latter incites Diomed to go against that god; he\nwounds him, and sends him groaning to heaven.\n\nThe first battle continues through this book. The scene is the same as in\nthe former.\n\n  But Pallas now Tydides' soul inspires,(143)\n  Fills with her force, and warms with all her fires,\n  Above the Greeks his deathless fame to raise,\n  And crown her hero with distinguish'd praise.\n  High on his helm celestial lightnings play,\n  His beamy shield emits a living ray;\n  The unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies,\n  Like the red star that fires the autumnal skies,\n  When fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight,\n  And, bathed in ocean, shoots a keener light.\n  Such glories Pallas on the chief bestow'd,\n  Such, from his arms, the fierce effulgence flow'd:\n  Onward she drives him, furious to engage,\n  Where the fight burns, and where the thickest rage.\n\n  The sons of Dares first the combat sought,\n  A wealthy priest, but rich without a fault;\n  In Vulcan's fane the father's days were led,\n  The sons to toils of glorious battle bred;\n  These singled from their troops the fight maintain,\n  These, from their steeds, Tydides on the plain.\n  Fierce for renown the brother-chiefs draw near,\n  And first bold Phegeus cast his sounding spear,\n  Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,\n  And spent in empty air its erring force.\n  Not so, Tydides, flew thy lance in vain,\n  But pierced his breast, and stretch'd him on the plain.\n  Seized with unusual fear, Idaeus fled,\n  Left the rich chariot, and his brother dead.\n  And had not Vulcan lent celestial aid,\n  He too had sunk to death's eternal shade;\n  But in a smoky cloud the god of fire\n  Preserved the son, in pity to the sire.\n  The steeds and chariot, to the navy led,\n  Increased the spoils of gallant Diomed.\n\n  Struck with amaze and shame, the Trojan crew,\n  Or slain, or fled, the sons of Dares view;\n  When by the blood-stain'd hand Minerva press'd\n  The god of battles, and this speech address'd:\n\n  \"Stern power of war! by whom the mighty fall,\n  Who bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall!\n  Let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide;\n  And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide:\n  While we from interdicted fields retire,\n  Nor tempt the wrath of heaven's avenging sire.\"\n\n  Her words allay the impetuous warrior's heat,\n  The god of arms and martial maid retreat;\n  Removed from fight, on Xanthus' flowery bounds\n  They sat, and listen'd to the dying sounds.\n\n  Meantime, the Greeks the Trojan race pursue,\n  And some bold chieftain every leader slew:\n  First Odius falls, and bites the bloody sand,\n  His death ennobled by Atrides' hand:\n\n  As he to flight his wheeling car address'd,\n  The speedy javelin drove from back to breast.\n  In dust the mighty Halizonian lay,\n  His arms resound, the spirit wings its way.\n\n  Thy fate was next, O Phaestus! doom'd to feel\n  The great Idomeneus' protended steel;\n  Whom Borus sent (his son and only joy)\n  From fruitful Tarne to the fields of Troy.\n  The Cretan javelin reach'd him from afar,\n  And pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car;\n  Back from the car he tumbles to the ground,\n  And everlasting shades his eyes surround.\n\n  Then died Scamandrius, expert in the chase,\n  In woods and wilds to wound the savage race;\n  Diana taught him all her sylvan arts,\n  To bend the bow, and aim unerring darts:\n  But vainly here Diana's arts he tries,\n  The fatal lance arrests him as he flies;\n  From Menelaus' arm the weapon sent,\n  Through his broad back and heaving bosom went:\n  Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,\n  His brazen armour rings against the ground.\n\n  Next artful Phereclus untimely fell;\n  Bold Merion sent him to the realms of hell.\n  Thy father's skill, O Phereclus! was thine,\n  The graceful fabric and the fair design;\n  For loved by Pallas, Pallas did impart\n  To him the shipwright's and the builder's art.\n  Beneath his hand the fleet of Paris rose,\n  The fatal cause of all his country's woes;\n  But he, the mystic will of heaven unknown,\n  Nor saw his country's peril, nor his own.\n  The hapless artist, while confused he fled,\n  The spear of Merion mingled with the dead.\n  Through his right hip, with forceful fury cast,\n  Between the bladder and the bone it pass'd;\n  Prone on his knees he falls with fruitless cries,\n  And death in lasting slumber seals his eyes.\n\n  From Meges' force the swift Pedaeus fled,\n  Antenor's offspring from a foreign bed,\n  Whose generous spouse, Theanor, heavenly fair,\n  Nursed the young stranger with a mother's care.\n  How vain those cares! when Meges in the rear\n  Full in his nape infix'd the fatal spear;\n  Swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides,\n  And the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.\n\n  Then died Hypsenor, generous and divine,\n  Sprung from the brave Dolopion's mighty line,\n  Who near adored Scamander made abode,\n  Priest of the stream, and honoured as a god.\n  On him, amidst the flying numbers found,\n  Eurypylus inflicts a deadly wound;\n  On his broad shoulders fell the forceful brand,\n  Thence glancing downwards, lopp'd his holy hand,\n  Which stain'd with sacred blood the blushing sand.\n  Down sunk the priest: the purple hand of death\n  Closed his dim eye, and fate suppress'd his breath.\n\n  Thus toil'd the chiefs, in different parts engaged.\n  In every quarter fierce Tydides raged;\n  Amid the Greek, amid the Trojan train,\n  Rapt through the ranks he thunders o'er the plain;\n  Now here, now there, he darts from place to place,\n  Pours on the rear, or lightens in their face.\n  Thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong\n  Deluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along,\n  Through ruin'd moles the rushing wave resounds,\n  O'erwhelm's the bridge, and bursts the lofty bounds;\n  The yellow harvests of the ripen'd year,\n  And flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear!(144)\n  While Jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain,\n  And all the labours of mankind are vain.\n\n  So raged Tydides, boundless in his ire,\n  Drove armies back, and made all Troy retire.\n  With grief the leader of the Lycian band\n  Saw the wide waste of his destructive hand:\n  His bended bow against the chief he drew;\n  Swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew,\n  Whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore,\n  Deep in his shoulder pierced, and drank the gore:\n  The rushing stream his brazen armour dyed,\n  While the proud archer thus exulting cried:\n\n  \"Hither, ye Trojans, hither drive your steeds!\n  Lo! by our hand the bravest Grecian bleeds,\n  Not long the deathful dart he can sustain;\n  Or Phoebus urged me to these fields in vain.\"\n  So spoke he, boastful: but the winged dart\n  Stopp'd short of life, and mock'd the shooter's art.\n  The wounded chief, behind his car retired,\n  The helping hand of Sthenelus required;\n  Swift from his seat he leap'd upon the ground,\n  And tugg'd the weapon from the gushing wound;\n  When thus the king his guardian power address'd,\n  The purple current wandering o'er his vest:\n\n  \"O progeny of Jove! unconquer'd maid!\n  If e'er my godlike sire deserved thy aid,\n  If e'er I felt thee in the fighting field;\n  Now, goddess, now, thy sacred succour yield.\n  O give my lance to reach the Trojan knight,\n  Whose arrow wounds the chief thou guard'st in fight;\n  And lay the boaster grovelling on the shore,\n  That vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more.\"\n\n  Thus pray'd Tydides, and Minerva heard,\n  His nerves confirm'd, his languid spirits cheer'd;\n  He feels each limb with wonted vigour light;\n  His beating bosom claim'd the promised fight.\n  \"Be bold, (she cried), in every combat shine,\n  War be thy province, thy protection mine;\n  Rush to the fight, and every foe control;\n  Wake each paternal virtue in thy soul:\n  Strength swells thy boiling breast, infused by me,\n  And all thy godlike father breathes in thee;\n  Yet more, from mortal mists I purge thy eyes,(145)\n  And set to view the warring deities.\n  These see thou shun, through all the embattled plain;\n  Nor rashly strive where human force is vain.\n  If Venus mingle in the martial band,\n  Her shalt thou wound: so Pallas gives command.\"\n\n  With that, the blue-eyed virgin wing'd her flight;\n  The hero rush'd impetuous to the fight;\n  With tenfold ardour now invades the plain,\n  Wild with delay, and more enraged by pain.\n  As on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls,\n  Amidst the field a brindled lion falls;\n  If chance some shepherd with a distant dart\n  The savage wound, he rouses at the smart,\n  He foams, he roars; the shepherd dares not stay,\n  But trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey;\n  Heaps fall on heaps; he bathes with blood the ground,\n  Then leaps victorious o'er the lofty mound.\n  Not with less fury stern Tydides flew;\n  And two brave leaders at an instant slew;\n  Astynous breathless fell, and by his side,\n  His people's pastor, good Hypenor, died;\n  Astynous' breast the deadly lance receives,\n  Hypenor's shoulder his broad falchion cleaves.\n  Those slain he left, and sprung with noble rage\n  Abas and Polyidus to engage;\n  Sons of Eurydamus, who, wise and old,\n  Could fate foresee, and mystic dreams unfold;\n  The youths return'd not from the doubtful plain,\n  And the sad father tried his arts in vain;\n  No mystic dream could make their fates appear,\n  Though now determined by Tydides' spear.\n\n  Young Xanthus next, and Thoon felt his rage;\n  The joy and hope of Phaenops' feeble age:\n  Vast was his wealth, and these the only heirs\n  Of all his labours and a life of cares.\n  Cold death o'ertakes them in their blooming years,\n  And leaves the father unavailing tears:\n  To strangers now descends his heapy store,\n  The race forgotten, and the name no more.\n\n  Two sons of Priam in one chariot ride,\n  Glittering in arms, and combat side by side.\n  As when the lordly lion seeks his food\n  Where grazing heifers range the lonely wood,\n  He leaps amidst them with a furious bound,\n  Bends their strong necks, and tears them to the ground:\n  So from their seats the brother chiefs are torn,\n  Their steeds and chariot to the navy borne.\n\n  With deep concern divine AEneas view'd\n  The foe prevailing, and his friends pursued;\n  Through the thick storm of singing spears he flies,\n  Exploring Pandarus with careful eyes.\n  At length he found Lycaon's mighty son;\n  To whom the chief of Venus' race begun:\n\n  \"Where, Pandarus, are all thy honours now,\n  Thy winged arrows and unerring bow,\n  Thy matchless skill, thy yet unrivall'd fame,\n  And boasted glory of the Lycian name?\n  O pierce that mortal! if we mortal call\n  That wondrous force by which whole armies fall;\n  Or god incensed, who quits the distant skies\n  To punish Troy for slighted sacrifice;\n  (Which, oh avert from our unhappy state!\n  For what so dreadful as celestial hate)?\n  Whoe'er he be, propitiate Jove with prayer;\n  If man, destroy; if god, entreat to spare.\"\n\n  To him the Lycian: \"Whom your eyes behold,\n  If right I judge, is Diomed the bold:\n  Such coursers whirl him o'er the dusty field,\n  So towers his helmet, and so flames his shield.\n  If 'tis a god, he wears that chief's disguise:\n  Or if that chief, some guardian of the skies,\n  Involved in clouds, protects him in the fray,\n  And turns unseen the frustrate dart away.\n  I wing'd an arrow, which not idly fell,\n  The stroke had fix'd him to the gates of hell;\n  And, but some god, some angry god withstands,\n  His fate was due to these unerring hands.\n  Skill'd in the bow, on foot I sought the war,\n  Nor join'd swift horses to the rapid car.\n  Ten polish'd chariots I possess'd at home,\n  And still they grace Lycaon's princely dome:\n  There veil'd in spacious coverlets they stand;\n  And twice ten coursers wait their lord's command.\n  The good old warrior bade me trust to these,\n  When first for Troy I sail'd the sacred seas;\n  In fields, aloft, the whirling car to guide,\n  And through the ranks of death triumphant ride.\n  But vain with youth, and yet to thrift inclined,\n  I heard his counsels with unheedful mind,\n  And thought the steeds (your large supplies unknown)\n  Might fail of forage in the straiten'd town;\n  So took my bow and pointed darts in hand\n  And left the chariots in my native land.\n\n  \"Too late, O friend! my rashness I deplore;\n  These shafts, once fatal, carry death no more.\n  Tydeus' and Atreus' sons their points have found,\n  And undissembled gore pursued the wound.\n  In vain they bleed: this unavailing bow\n  Serves, not to slaughter, but provoke the foe.\n  In evil hour these bended horns I strung,\n  And seized the quiver where it idly hung.\n  Cursed be the fate that sent me to the field\n  Without a warrior's arms, the spear and shield!\n  If e'er with life I quit the Trojan plain,\n  If e'er I see my spouse and sire again,\n  This bow, unfaithful to my glorious aims,\n  Broke by my hand, shall feed the blazing flames.\"\n\n  To whom the leader of the Dardan race:\n  \"Be calm, nor Phoebus' honour'd gift disgrace.\n  The distant dart be praised, though here we need\n  The rushing chariot and the bounding steed.\n  Against yon hero let us bend our course,\n  And, hand to hand, encounter force with force.\n  Now mount my seat, and from the chariot's height\n  Observe my father's steeds, renown'd in fight;\n  Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,\n  To dare the shock, or urge the rapid race;\n  Secure with these, through fighting fields we go;\n  Or safe to Troy, if Jove assist the foe.\n  Haste, seize the whip, and snatch the guiding rein;\n  The warrior's fury let this arm sustain;\n  Or, if to combat thy bold heart incline,\n  Take thou the spear, the chariot's care be mine.\"\n\n  \"O prince! (Lycaon's valiant son replied)\n  As thine the steeds, be thine the task to guide.\n  The horses, practised to their lord's command,\n  Shall bear the rein, and answer to thy hand;\n  But, if, unhappy, we desert the fight,\n  Thy voice alone can animate their flight;\n  Else shall our fates be number'd with the dead,\n  And these, the victor's prize, in triumph led.\n  Thine be the guidance, then: with spear and shield\n  Myself will charge this terror of the field.\"\n\n  And now both heroes mount the glittering car;\n  The bounding coursers rush amidst the war;\n  Their fierce approach bold Sthenelus espied,\n  Who thus, alarm'd, to great Tydides cried:\n\n  \"O friend! two chiefs of force immense I see,\n  Dreadful they come, and bend their rage on thee:\n  Lo the brave heir of old Lycaon's line,\n  And great AEneas, sprung from race divine!\n  Enough is given to fame. Ascend thy car!\n  And save a life, the bulwark of our war.\"\n\n  At this the hero cast a gloomy look,\n  Fix'd on the chief with scorn; and thus he spoke:\n\n  \"Me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight?\n  Me wouldst thou move to base, inglorious flight?\n  Know, 'tis not honest in my soul to fear,\n  Nor was Tydides born to tremble here.\n  I hate the cumbrous chariot's slow advance,\n  And the long distance of the flying lance;\n  But while my nerves are strong, my force entire,\n  Thus front the foe, and emulate my sire.\n  Nor shall yon steeds, that fierce to fight convey\n  Those threatening heroes, bear them both away;\n  One chief at least beneath this arm shall die;\n  So Pallas tells me, and forbids to fly.\n  But if she dooms, and if no god withstand,\n  That both shall fall by one victorious hand,\n  Then heed my words: my horses here detain,\n  Fix'd to the chariot by the straiten'd rein;\n  Swift to AEneas' empty seat proceed,\n  And seize the coursers of ethereal breed;\n  The race of those, which once the thundering god(146)\n  For ravish'd Ganymede on Tros bestow'd,\n  The best that e'er on earth's broad surface run,\n  Beneath the rising or the setting sun.\n  Hence great Anchises stole a breed unknown,\n  By mortal mares, from fierce Laomedon:\n  Four of this race his ample stalls contain,\n  And two transport AEneas o'er the plain.\n  These, were the rich immortal prize our own,\n  Through the wide world should make our glory known.\"\n\n  Thus while they spoke, the foe came furious on,\n  And stern Lycaon's warlike race begun:\n\n  \"Prince, thou art met.

and the great Minerva be thy aid.\n  To tame the monster-god Minerva knows,\n  And oft afflicts his brutal breast with woes.\"\n\n  He said; Saturnia, ardent to obey,\n  Lash'd her white steeds along the aerial way\n  Swift down the steep of heaven the chariot rolls,\n  Between the expanded earth and starry poles\n  Far as a shepherd, from some point on high,(157)\n  O'er the wide main extends his boundless eye,\n  Through such a space of air, with thundering sound,\n  At every leap the immortal coursers bound\n  Troy now they reach'd and touch'd those banks divine,\n  Where silver Simois and Scamander join\n  There Juno stopp'd, and (her fair steeds unloosed)\n  Of air condensed a vapour circumfused\n  For these, impregnate with celestial dew,\n  On Simois, brink ambrosial herbage grew.\n  Thence to relieve the fainting Argive throng,\n  Smooth as the sailing doves they glide along.\n\n  The best and bravest of the Grecian band\n  (A warlike circle) round Tydides stand.\n  Such was their look as lions bathed in blood,\n  Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood\n  Heaven's empress mingles with the mortal crowd,\n  And shouts, in Stentor's sounding voice, aloud;\n  Stentor the strong, endued with brazen lungs,(158)\n  Whose throats surpass'd the force of fifty tongues.\n\n  \"Inglorious Argives! to your race a shame,\n  And only men in figure and in name!\n  Once from the walls your timorous foes engaged,\n  While fierce in war divine Achilles raged;\n  Now issuing fearless they possess the plain,\n  Now win the shores, and scarce the seas remain.\"\n\n  Her speech new fury to their hearts convey'd;\n  While near Tydides stood the Athenian maid;\n  The king beside his panting steeds she found,\n  O'erspent with toil reposing on the ground;\n  To cool his glowing wound he sat apart,\n  (The wound inflicted by the Lycian dart.)\n  Large drops of sweat from all his limbs descend,\n  Beneath his ponderous shield his sinews bend,\n  Whose ample belt, that o'er his shoulder lay,\n  He eased; and wash'd the clotted gore away.\n  The goddess leaning o'er the bending yoke,\n  Beside his coursers, thus her silence broke:\n\n  \"Degenerate prince! and not of Tydeus' kind,\n  Whose little body lodged a mighty mind;\n  Foremost he press'd in glorious toils to share,\n  And scarce refrain'd when I forbade the war.\n  Alone, unguarded, once he dared to go,\n  And feast, incircled by the Theban foe;\n  There braved, and vanquish'd, many a hardy knight;\n  Such nerves I gave him, and such force in fight.\n  Thou too no less hast been my constant care;\n  Thy hands I arm'd, and sent thee forth to war:\n  But thee or fear deters, or sloth detains;\n  No drop of all thy father warms thy veins.\"\n\n  The chief thus answered mild: \"Immortal maid!\n  I own thy presence, and confess thy aid.\n  Not fear, thou know'st, withholds me from the plains,\n  Nor sloth hath seized me, but thy word restrains:\n  From warring gods thou bad'st me turn my spear,\n  And Venus only found resistance here.\n  Hence, goddess! heedful of thy high commands,\n  Loth I gave way, and warn'd our Argive bands:\n  For Mars, the homicide, these eyes beheld,\n  With slaughter red, and raging round the field.\"\n\n  Then thus Minerva:--\"Brave Tydides, hear!\n  Not Mars himself, nor aught immortal, fear.\n  Full on the god impel thy foaming horse:\n  Pallas commands, and Pallas lends thee force.\n  Rash, furious, blind, from these to those he flies,\n  And every side of wavering combat tries;\n  Large promise makes, and breaks the promise made:\n  Now gives the Grecians, now the Trojans aid.\"(159)\n\n  She said, and to the steeds approaching near,\n  Drew from his seat the martial charioteer.\n  The vigorous power the trembling car ascends,\n  Fierce for revenge; and Diomed attends:\n  The groaning axle bent beneath the load;\n  So great a hero, and so great a god.\n  She snatch'd the reins, she lash'd with all her force,\n  And full on Mars impelled the foaming horse:\n  But first, to hide her heavenly visage, spread\n  Black Orcus' helmet o'er her radiant head.\n\n            [Illustration: DIOMED CASTING HIS SPEAR AT MARS.]\n\n                    DIOMED CASTING HIS SPEAR AT MARS.\n\n\n  Just then gigantic Periphas lay slain,\n  The strongest warrior of the AEtolian train;\n  The god, who slew him, leaves his prostrate prize\n  Stretch'd where he fell, and at Tydides flies.\n  Now rushing fierce, in equal arms appear\n  The daring Greek, the dreadful god of war!\n  Full at the chief, above his courser's head,\n  From Mars's arm the enormous weapon fled:\n  Pallas opposed her hand, and caused to glance\n  Far from the car the strong immortal lance.\n  Then threw the force of Tydeus' warlike son;\n  The javelin hiss'd; the goddess urged it on:\n  Where the broad cincture girt his armour round,\n  It pierced the god: his groin received the wound.\n  From the rent skin the warrior tugs again\n  The smoking steel.

Helenus, the chief\naugur of Troy, commands Hector to return to the city, in order to appoint\na solemn procession of the queen and the Trojan matrons to the temple of\nMinerva, to entreat her to remove Diomed from the fight. The battle\nrelaxing during the absence of Hector, Glaucus and Diomed have an\ninterview between the two armies; where, coming to the knowledge, of the\nfriendship and hospitality passed between their ancestors, they make\nexchange of their arms. Hector, having performed the orders of Helenus,\nprevails upon Paris to return to the battle, and, taking a tender leave of\nhis wife Andromache, hastens again to the field.\n\nThe scene is first in the field of battle, between the rivers Simois and\nScamander, and then changes to Troy.\n\n  Now heaven forsakes the fight: the immortals yield\n  To human force and human skill the field:\n  Dark showers of javelins fly from foes to foes;\n  Now here, now there, the tide of combat flows;\n  While Troy's famed streams, that bound the deathful plain\n  On either side, run purple to the main.\n\n  Great Ajax first to conquest led the way,\n  Broke the thick ranks, and turn'd the doubtful day.\n  The Thracian Acamas his falchion found,\n  And hew'd the enormous giant to the ground;\n  His thundering arm a deadly stroke impress'd\n  Where the black horse-hair nodded o'er his crest;\n  Fix'd in his front the brazen weapon lies,\n  And seals in endless shades his swimming eyes.\n  Next Teuthras' son distain'd the sands with blood,\n  Axylus, hospitable, rich, and good:\n  In fair Arisbe's walls (his native place)(161)\n  He held his seat! a friend to human race.\n  Fast by the road, his ever-open door\n  Obliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor.\n  To stern Tydides now he falls a prey,\n  No friend to guard him in the dreadful day!\n  Breathless the good man fell, and by his side\n  His faithful servant, old Calesius died.\n\n  By great Euryalus was Dresus slain,\n  And next he laid Opheltius on the plain.\n  Two twins were near, bold, beautiful, and young,\n  From a fair naiad and Bucolion sprung:\n  (Laomedon's white flocks Bucolion fed,\n  That monarch's first-born by a foreign bed;\n  In secret woods he won the naiad's grace,\n  And two fair infants crown'd his strong embrace:)\n  Here dead they lay in all their youthful charms;\n  The ruthless victor stripp'd their shining arms.\n\n  Astyalus by Polypoetes fell;\n  Ulysses' spear Pidytes sent to hell;\n  By Teucer's shaft brave Aretaon bled,\n  And Nestor's son laid stern Ablerus dead;\n  Great Agamemnon, leader of the brave,\n  The mortal wound of rich Elatus gave,\n  Who held in Pedasus his proud abode,(162)\n  And till'd the banks where silver Satnio flow'd.\n  Melanthius by Eurypylus was slain;\n  And Phylacus from Leitus flies in vain.\n\n  Unbless'd Adrastus next at mercy lies\n  Beneath the Spartan spear, a living prize.\n  Scared with the din and tumult of the fight,\n  His headlong steeds, precipitate in flight,\n  Rush'd on a tamarisk's strong trunk, and broke\n  The shatter'd chariot from the crooked yoke;\n  Wide o'er the field, resistless as the wind,\n  For Troy they fly, and leave their lord behind.\n  Prone on his face he sinks beside the wheel:\n  Atrides o'er him shakes his vengeful steel;\n  The fallen chief in suppliant posture press'd\n  The victor's knees, and thus his prayer address'd:\n\n  \"O spare my youth, and for the life I owe\n  Large gifts of price my father shall bestow.\n  When fame shall tell, that, not in battle slain,\n  Thy hollow ships his captive son detain:\n  Rich heaps of brass shall in thy tent be told,(163)\n  And steel well-temper'd, and persuasive gold.\"\n\n  He said: compassion touch'd the hero's heart\n  He stood, suspended with the lifted dart:\n  As pity pleaded for his vanquish'd prize,\n  Stern Agamemnon swift to vengeance flies,\n  And, furious, thus: \"Oh impotent of mind!(164)\n  Shall these, shall these Atrides' mercy find?\n  Well hast thou known proud Troy's perfidious land,\n  And well her natives merit at thy hand!\n  Not one of all the race, nor sex, nor age,\n  Shall save a Trojan from our boundless rage:\n  Ilion shall perish whole, and bury all;\n  Her babes, her infants at the breast, shall fall;(165)\n  A dreadful lesson of exampled fate,\n  To warn the nations, and to curb the great!\"\n\n  The monarch spoke; the words, with warmth address'd,\n  To rigid justice steel'd his brother's breast\n  Fierce from his knees the hapless chief he thrust;\n  The monarch's javelin stretch'd him in the dust,\n  Then pressing with his foot his panting heart,\n  Forth from the slain he tugg'd the reeking dart.\n  Old Nestor saw, and roused the warrior's rage;\n  \"Thus, heroes! thus the vigorous combat wage;\n  No son of Mars descend, for servile gains,\n  To touch the booty, while a foe remains.\n  Behold yon glittering host, your future spoil!\n  First gain the conquest, then reward the toil.\"\n\n  And now had Greece eternal fame acquired,\n  And frighted Troy within her walls, retired,\n  Had not sage Helenus her state redress'd,\n  Taught by the gods that moved his sacred breast.\n  Where Hector stood, with great AEneas join'd,\n  The seer reveal'd the counsels of his mind:\n\n  \"Ye generous chiefs! on whom the immortals lay\n  The cares and glories of this doubtful day;\n  On whom your aids, your country's hopes depend;\n  Wise to consult, and active to defend!\n  Here, at our gates, your brave efforts unite,\n  Turn back the routed, and forbid the flight,\n  Ere yet their wives' soft arms the cowards gain,\n  The sport and insult of the hostile train.\n  When your commands have hearten'd every band,\n  Ourselves, here fix'd, will make the dangerous stand;\n  Press'd as we are, and sore of former fight,\n  These straits demand our last remains of might.\n  Meanwhile thou, Hector, to the town retire,\n  And teach our mother what the gods require:\n  Direct the queen to lead the assembled train\n  Of Troy's chief matrons to Minerva's fane;(166)\n  Unbar the sacred gates, and seek the power,\n  With offer'd vows, in Ilion's topmost tower.\n  The largest mantle her rich wardrobes hold,\n  Most prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,\n  Before the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,\n  And twelve young heifers to her altars led:\n  If so the power, atoned by fervent prayer,\n  Our wives, our infants, and our city spare,\n  And far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,\n  That mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire;\n  Not thus Achilles taught our hosts to dread,\n  Sprung though he was from more than mortal bed;\n  Not thus resistless ruled the stream of fight,\n  In rage unbounded, and unmatch'd in might.\"\n\n  Hector obedient heard: and, with a bound,\n  Leap'd from his trembling chariot to the ground;\n  Through all his host inspiring force he flies,\n  And bids the thunder of the battle rise.\n  With rage recruited the bold Trojans glow,\n  And turn the tide of conflict on the foe:\n  Fierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears;\n  All Greece recedes, and 'midst her triumphs fears;\n  Some god, they thought, who ruled the fate of wars,\n  Shot down avenging from the vault of stars.\n\n  Then thus aloud: \"Ye dauntless Dardans, hear!\n  And you whom distant nations send to war!\n  Be mindful of the strength your fathers bore;\n  Be still yourselves, and Hector asks no more.\n  One hour demands me in the Trojan wall,\n  To bid our altars flame, and victims fall:\n  Nor shall, I trust, the matrons' holy train,\n  And reverend elders, seek the gods in vain.\"\n\n  This said, with ample strides the hero pass'd;\n  The shield's large orb behind his shoulder cast,\n  His neck o'ershading, to his ankle hung;\n  And as he march'd the brazen buckler rung.\n\n  Now paused the battle (godlike Hector gone),(167)\n  Where daring Glaucus and great Tydeus' son\n  Between both armies met: the chiefs from far\n  Observed each other, and had mark'd for war.\n  Near as they drew, Tydides thus began:\n\n  \"What art thou, boldest of the race of man?\n  Our eyes till now that aspect ne'er beheld,\n  Where fame is reap'd amid the embattled field;\n  Yet far before the troops thou dar'st appear,\n  And meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear.\n  Unhappy they, and born of luckless sires,\n  Who tempt our fury when Minerva fires!\n  But if from heaven, celestial, thou descend,\n  Know with immortals we no more contend.\n  Not long Lycurgus view'd the golden light,\n  That daring man who mix'd with gods in fight.\n  Bacchus, and Bacchus' votaries, he drove,\n  With brandish'd steel, from Nyssa's sacred grove:\n  Their consecrated spears lay scatter'd round,\n  With curling vines and twisted ivy bound;\n  While Bacchus headlong sought the briny flood,\n  And Thetis' arms received the trembling god.\n  Nor fail'd the crime the immortals' wrath to move;\n  (The immortals bless'd with endless ease above;)\n  Deprived of sight by their avenging doom,\n  Cheerless he breathed, and wander'd in the gloom,\n  Then sunk unpitied to the dire abodes,\n  A wretch accursed, and hated by the gods!\n  I brave not heaven: but if the fruits of earth\n  Sustain thy life, and human be thy birth,\n  Bold as thou art, too prodigal of breath,\n  Approach, and enter the dark gates of death.\"\n\n  \"What, or from whence I am, or who my sire,\n  (Replied the chief,) can Tydeus' son inquire?\n  Like leaves on trees the race of man is found,\n  Now green in youth, now withering on the ground;\n  Another race the following spring supplies;\n  They fall successive, and successive rise:\n  So generations in their course decay;\n  So flourish these, when those are pass'd away.\n  But if thou still persist to search my birth,\n  Then hear a tale that fills the spacious earth.\n\n  \"A city stands on Argos' utmost bound,\n  (Argos the fair, for warlike steeds renown'd,)\n  Aeolian Sisyphus, with wisdom bless'd,\n  In ancient time the happy wall possess'd,\n  Then call'd Ephyre: Glaucus was his son;\n  Great Glaucus, father of Bellerophon,\n  Who o'er the sons of men in beauty shined,\n  Loved for that valour which preserves mankind.\n  Then mighty Praetus Argos' sceptre sway'd,\n  Whose hard commands Bellerophon obey'd.\n  With direful jealousy the monarch raged,\n  And the brave prince in numerous toils engaged.\n  For him Antaea burn'd with lawless flame,\n  And strove to tempt him from the paths of fame:\n  In vain she tempted the relentless youth,\n  Endued with wisdom, sacred fear, and truth.\n  Fired at his scorn the queen to Praetus fled,\n  And begg'd revenge for her insulted bed:\n  Incensed he heard, resolving on his fate;\n  But hospitable laws restrain'd his hate:\n  To Lycia the devoted youth he sent,\n  With tablets seal'd, that told his dire intent.(168)\n  Now bless'd by every power who guards the good,\n  The chief arrived at Xanthus' silver flood:\n  There Lycia's monarch paid him honours due,\n  Nine days he feasted, and nine bulls he slew.\n  But when the tenth bright morning orient glow'd,\n  The faithful youth his monarch's mandate show'd:\n  The fatal tablets, till that instant seal'd,\n  The deathful secret to the king reveal'd.\n  First, dire Chimaera's conquest was enjoin'd;\n  A mingled monster of no mortal kind!\n  Behind, a dragon's fiery tail was spread;\n  A goat's rough body bore a lion's head;\n  Her pitchy nostrils flaky flames expire;\n  Her gaping throat emits infernal fire.\n\n  \"This pest he slaughter'd, (for he read the skies,\n  And trusted heaven's informing prodigies,)\n  Then met in arms the Solymaean crew,(169)\n  (Fiercest of men,) and those the warrior slew;\n  Next the bold Amazons' whole force defied;\n  And conquer'd still, for heaven was on his side.\n\n  \"Nor ended here his toils: his Lycian foes,\n  At his return, a treacherous ambush rose,\n  With levell'd spears along the winding shore:\n  There fell they breathless, and return'd no more.\n\n  \"At length the monarch, with repentant grief,\n  Confess'd the gods, and god-descended chief;\n  His daughter gave, the stranger to detain,\n  With half the honours of his ample reign:\n  The Lycians grant a chosen space of ground,\n  With woods, with vineyards, and with harvests crown'd.\n  There long the chief his happy lot possess'd,\n  With two brave sons and one fair daughter bless'd;\n  (Fair e'en in heavenly eyes: her fruitful love\n  Crown'd with Sarpedon's birth the embrace of Jove;)\n  But when at last, distracted in his mind,\n  Forsook by heaven, forsaking humankind,\n  Wide o'er the Aleian field he chose to stray,\n  A long, forlorn, uncomfortable way!(170)\n  Woes heap'd on woes consumed his wasted heart:\n  His beauteous daughter fell by Phoebe's dart;\n  His eldest born by raging Mars was slain,\n  In combat on the Solymaean plain.\n  Hippolochus survived: from him I came,\n  The honour'd author of my birth and name;\n  By his decree I sought the Trojan town;\n  By his instructions learn to win renown,\n  To stand the first in worth as in command,\n  To add new honours to my native land,\n  Before my eyes my mighty sires to place,\n  And emulate the glories of our race.\"\n\n  He spoke, and transport fill'd Tydides' heart;\n  In earth the generous warrior fix'd his dart,\n  Then friendly, thus the Lycian prince address'd:\n  \"Welcome, my brave hereditary guest!\n  Thus ever let us meet, with kind embrace,\n  Nor stain the sacred friendship of our race.\n  Know, chief, our grandsires have been guests of old;\n  OEneus the strong, Bellerophon the bold:\n  Our ancient seat his honour'd presence graced,\n  Where twenty days in genial rites he pass'd.\n  The parting heroes mutual presents left;\n  A golden goblet was thy grandsire's gift;\n  OEneus a belt of matchless work bestowed,\n  That rich with Tyrian dye refulgent glow'd.\n  (This from his pledge I learn'd, which, safely stored\n  Among my treasures, still adorns my board:\n  For Tydeus left me young, when Thebe's wall\n  Beheld the sons of Greece untimely fall.)\n  Mindful of this, in friendship let us join;\n  If heaven our steps to foreign lands incline,\n  My guest in Argos thou, and I in Lycia thine.\n  Enough of Trojans to this lance shall yield,\n  In the full harvest of yon ample field;\n  Enough of Greeks shall dye thy spear with gore;\n  But thou and Diomed be foes no more.\n  Now change we arms, and prove to either host\n  We guard the friendship of the line we boast.\"\n\n  Thus having said, the gallant chiefs alight,\n  Their hands they join, their mutual faith they plight;\n  Brave Glaucus then each narrow thought resign'd,\n  (Jove warm'd his bosom, and enlarged his mind,)\n  For Diomed's brass arms, of mean device,\n  For which nine oxen paid, (a vulgar price,)\n  He gave his own, of gold divinely wrought,(171)\n  A hundred beeves the shining purchase bought.\n\n  Meantime the guardian of the Trojan state,\n  Great Hector, enter'd at the Scaean gate.(172)\n  Beneath the beech-tree's consecrated shades,\n  The Trojan matrons and the Trojan maids\n  Around him flock'd, all press'd with pious care\n  For husbands, brothers, sons, engaged in war.\n  He bids the train in long procession go,\n  And seek the gods, to avert the impending woe.\n  And now to Priam's stately courts he came,\n  Rais'd on arch'd columns of stupendous frame;\n  O'er these a range of marble structure runs,\n  The rich pavilions of his fifty sons,\n  In fifty chambers lodged: and rooms of state,(173)\n  Opposed to those, where Priam's daughters sate.\n  Twelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone,\n  Of equal beauty, and of polish'd stone.\n  Hither great Hector pass'd, nor pass'd unseen\n  Of royal Hecuba, his mother-queen.\n  (With her Laodice, whose beauteous face\n  Surpass'd the nymphs of Troy's illustrious race.)\n  Long in a strict embrace she held her son,\n  And press'd his hand, and tender thus begun:\n\n  \"O Hector! say, what great occasion calls\n  My son from fight, when Greece surrounds our walls;\n  Com'st thou to supplicate the almighty power\n  With lifted hands, from Ilion's lofty tower?\n  Stay, till I bring the cup with Bacchus crown'd,\n  In Jove's high name, to sprinkle on the ground,\n  And pay due vows to all the gods around.\n  Then with a plenteous draught refresh thy soul,\n  And draw new spirits from the generous bowl;\n  Spent as thou art with long laborious fight,\n  The brave defender of thy country's right.\"\n\n  \"Far hence be Bacchus' gifts; (the chief rejoin'd;)\n  Inflaming wine, pernicious to mankind,\n  Unnerves the limbs, and dulls the noble mind.\n  Let chiefs abstain, and spare the sacred juice\n  To sprinkle to the gods, its better use.\n  By me that holy office were profaned;\n  Ill fits it me, with human gore distain'd,\n  To the pure skies these horrid hands to raise,\n  Or offer heaven's great Sire polluted praise.\n  You, with your matrons, go! a spotless train,\n  And burn rich odours in Minerva's fane.\n  The largest mantle your full wardrobes hold,\n  Most prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,\n  Before the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,\n  And twelve young heifers to her altar led.\n  So may the power, atoned by fervent prayer,\n  Our wives, our infants, and our city spare;\n  And far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,\n  Who mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire.\n  Be this, O mother, your religious care:\n  I go to rouse soft Paris to the war;\n  If yet not lost to all the sense of shame,\n  The recreant warrior hear the voice of fame.\n  Oh, would kind earth the hateful wretch embrace,\n  That pest of Troy, that ruin of our race!(174)\n  Deep to the dark abyss might he descend,\n  Troy yet should flourish, and my sorrows end.\"\n\n  This heard, she gave command: and summon'd came\n  Each noble matron and illustrious dame.\n  The Phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went,\n  Where treasured odours breathed a costly scent.\n  There lay the vestures of no vulgar art,\n  Sidonian maids embroider'd every part,\n  Whom from soft Sidon youthful Paris bore,\n  With Helen touching on the Tyrian shore.\n  Here, as the queen revolved with careful eyes\n  The various textures and the various dyes,\n  She chose a veil that shone superior far,\n  And glow'd refulgent as the morning star.\n  Herself with this the long procession leads;\n  The train majestically slow proceeds.\n  Soon as to Ilion's topmost tower they come,\n  And awful reach the high Palladian dome,\n  Antenor's consort, fair Theano, waits\n  As Pallas' priestess, and unbars the gates.\n  With hands uplifted and imploring eyes,\n  They fill the dome with supplicating cries.\n  The priestess then the shining veil displays,\n  Placed on Minerva's knees, and thus she prays:\n\n  \"Oh awful goddess! ever-dreadful maid,\n  Troy's strong defence, unconquer'd Pallas, aid!\n  Break thou Tydides' spear, and let him fall\n  Prone on the dust before the Trojan wall!\n  So twelve young heifers, guiltless of the yoke,\n  Shall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke.\n  But thou, atoned by penitence and prayer,\n  Ourselves, our infants, and our city spare!\"\n  So pray'd the priestess in her holy fane;\n  So vow'd the matrons, but they vow'd in vain.\n\n  While these appear before the power with prayers,\n  Hector to Paris' lofty dome repairs.(175)\n  Himself the mansion

Apollo, seeing her descend from\nOlympus, joins her near the Scaean gate. They agree to put off the general\nengagement for that day, and incite Hector to challenge the Greeks to a\nsingle combat. Nine of the princes accepting the challenge, the lot is\ncast and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after several attacks, are parted\nby the night. The Trojans calling a council, Antenor purposes the delivery\nof Helen to the Greeks, to which Paris will not consent, but offers to\nrestore them her riches. Priam sends a herald to make this offer, and to\ndemand a truce for burning the dead, the last of which only is agreed to\nby Agamemnon. When the funerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the\nadvice of Nestor, erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp,\nflanked with towers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune\ntestifies his jealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from\nJupiter. Both armies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens\nthe Trojans with thunder, and other signs of his wrath.\n\nThe three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax, the\nnext day the truce is agreed; another is taken up in the funeral rites of\nthe slain and one more in building the fortification before the ships. So\nthat somewhat about three days is employed in this book. The scene lies\nwholly in the field.\n\n  So spoke the guardian of the Trojan state,\n  Then rush'd impetuous through the Scaean gate.\n  Him Paris follow'd to the dire alarms;\n  Both breathing slaughter, both resolved in arms.\n  As when to sailors labouring through the main,\n  That long have heaved the weary oar in vain,\n  Jove bids at length the expected gales arise;\n  The gales blow grateful, and the vessel flies.\n  So welcome these to Troy's desiring train,\n  The bands are cheer'd, the war awakes again.\n\n  Bold Paris first the work of death begun\n  On great Menestheus, Areithous' son,\n  Sprung from the fair Philomeda's embrace,\n  The pleasing Arne was his native place.\n  Then sunk Eioneus to the shades below,\n  Beneath his steely casque he felt the blow(177)\n  Full on his neck, from Hector's weighty hand;\n  And roll'd, with limbs relax'd, along the land.\n  By Glaucus' spear the bold Iphmous bleeds,\n  Fix'd in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;\n  Headlong he tumbles: his slack nerves unbound,\n  Drop the cold useless members on the ground.\n\n  When now Minerva saw her Argives slain,\n  From vast Olympus to the gleaming plain\n  Fierce she descends: Apollo marked her flight,\n  Nor shot less swift from Ilion's towery height.\n  Radiant they met, beneath the beechen shade;\n  When thus Apollo to the blue-eyed maid:\n\n  \"What cause, O daughter of Almighty Jove!\n  Thus wings thy progress from the realms above?\n  Once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way,\n  To give to Greece the long divided day?\n  Too much has Troy already felt thy hate,\n  Now breathe thy rage, and hush the stern debate;\n  This day, the business of the field suspend;\n  War soon shall kindle, and great Ilion bend;\n  Since vengeful goddesses confederate join\n  To raze her walls, though built by hands divine.\"\n\n  To whom the progeny of Jove replies:\n  \"I left, for this, the council of the skies:\n  But who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear,\n  What art shall calm the furious sons of war?\"\n  To her the god: \"Great Hector's soul incite\n  To dare the boldest Greek to single fight,\n  Till Greece, provoked, from all her numbers show\n  A warrior worthy to be Hector's foe.\"\n\n  At this agreed, the heavenly powers withdrew;\n  Sage Helenus their secret counsels knew;\n  Hector, inspired, he sought: to him address'd,\n  Thus told the dictates of his sacred breast:\n  \"O son of Priam! let thy faithful ear\n  Receive my words: thy friend and brother hear!\n  Go forth persuasive, and a while engage\n  The warring nations to suspend their rage;\n  Then dare the boldest of the hostile train\n  To mortal combat on the listed plain.\n  For not this day shall end thy glorious date;\n  The gods have spoke it, and their voice is fate.\"\n\n  He said: the warrior heard the word with joy;\n  Then with his spear restrain'd the youth of Troy,\n  Held by the midst athwart. On either hand\n  The squadrons part; the expecting Trojans stand;\n  Great Agamemnon bids the Greeks forbear:\n  They breathe, and hush the tumult of the war.\n  The Athenian maid, and glorious god of day,(178)\n  With silent joy the settling hosts survey:\n  In form of vultures, on the beech's height\n  They sit conceal'd, and wait the future fight.\n\n  The thronging troops obscure the dusky fields,\n  Horrid with bristling spears, and gleaming shields.\n  As when a general darkness veils the main,\n  (Soft Zephyr curling the wide wat'ry plain,)\n  The waves scarce heave, the face of ocean sleeps,\n  And a still horror saddens all the deeps;\n  Thus in thick orders settling wide around,\n  At length composed they sit, and shade the ground.\n  Great Hector first amidst both armies broke\n  The solemn silence, and their powers bespoke:\n\n  \"Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,\n  What my soul prompts, and what some god commands.\n  Great Jove, averse our warfare to compose,\n  O'erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes;\n  War with a fiercer tide once more returns,\n  Till Ilion falls, or till yon navy burns.\n  You then, O princes of the Greeks! appear;\n  'Tis Hector speaks, and calls the gods to hear:\n  From all your troops select the boldest knight,\n  And him, the boldest, Hector dares to fight.\n  Here if I fall, by chance of battle slain,\n  Be his my spoil, and his these arms remain;\n  But let my body, to my friends return'd,\n  By Trojan hands and Trojan flames be burn'd.\n  And if Apollo, in whose aid I trust,\n  Shall stretch your daring champion in the dust;\n  If mine the glory to despoil the foe;\n  On Phoebus' temple I'll his arms bestow:\n  The breathless carcase to your navy sent,\n  Greece on the shore shall raise a monument;\n  Which when some future mariner surveys,\n  Wash'd by broad Hellespont's resounding seas,\n  Thus shall he say, 'A valiant Greek lies there,\n  By Hector slain, the mighty man of war,'\n  The stone shall tell your vanquish'd hero's name.\n  And distant ages learn the victor's fame.\"\n\n  This fierce defiance Greece astonish'd heard,\n  Blush'd to refuse, and to accept it fear'd.\n  Stern Menelaus first the silence broke,\n  And, inly groaning, thus opprobrious spoke:\n\n  \"Women of Greece!

By heaven inspired,\n  Leap'd forth the lot, of every Greek desired.\n  This from the right to left the herald bears,\n  Held out in order to the Grecian peers;\n  Each to his rival yields the mark unknown,\n  Till godlike Ajax finds the lot his own;\n  Surveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes,\n  Then casts before him, and with transport cries:\n\n  \"Warriors!

The troops with elevated eyes,\n  Implore the god whose thunder rends the skies:\n  \"O father of mankind, superior lord!\n  On lofty Ida's holy hill adored:\n  Who in the highest heaven hast fix'd thy throne,\n  Supreme of gods! unbounded and alone:\n  Grant thou, that Telamon may bear away\n  The praise and conquest of this doubtful day;\n  Or, if illustrious Hector be thy care,\n  That both may claim it, and that both may share.\"\n\n  Now Ajax braced his dazzling armour on;\n  Sheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone:\n  He moves to combat with majestic pace;\n  So stalks in arms the grisly god of Thrace,(182)\n  When Jove to punish faithless men prepares,\n  And gives whole nations to the waste of wars,\n  Thus march'd the chief, tremendous as a god;\n  Grimly he smiled; earth trembled as he strode:(183)\n  His massy javelin quivering in his hand,\n  He stood, the bulwark of the Grecian band.\n  Through every Argive heart new transport ran;\n  All Troy stood trembling at the mighty man:\n  Even Hector paused; and with new doubt oppress'd,\n  Felt his great heart suspended in his breast:\n  'Twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear;\n  Himself had challenged, and the foe drew near.\n\n  Stern Telamon behind his ample shield,\n  As from a brazen tower, o'erlook'd the field.\n  Huge was its orb, with seven thick folds o'ercast,\n  Of tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last,\n  (The work of Tychius, who in Hyle dwell'd\n  And in all arts of armoury excell'd,)\n  This Ajax bore before his manly breast,\n  And, threatening, thus his adverse chief address'd:\n\n  \"Hector! approach my arm, and singly know\n  What strength thou hast, and what the Grecian foe.\n  Achilles shuns the fight; yet some there are,\n  Not void of soul, and not unskill'd in war:\n  Let him, unactive on the sea-beat shore,\n  Indulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;\n  Whole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast,\n  And sends thee one, a sample of her host,\n  Such as I am, I come to prove thy might;\n  No more--be sudden, and begin the fight.\"\n\n  \"O son of Telamon, thy country's pride!\n  (To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied)\n  Me, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,\n  New to the field, and trembling at the fight?\n  Thou meet'st a chief deserving of thy arms,\n  To combat born, and bred amidst alarms:\n  I know to shift my ground, remount the car,\n  Turn, charge, and answer every call of war;\n  To right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield,\n  And bear thick battle on my sounding shield\n  But open be our fight, and bold each blow;\n  I steal no conquest from a noble foe.\"\n\n  He said, and rising, high above the field\n  Whirl'd the long lance against the sevenfold shield.\n  Full on the brass descending from above\n  Through six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,\n  Till in the seventh it fix'd.

thou, whose rage can make\n  The solid earth's eternal basis shake!\n  What cause of fear from mortal works could move(187)\n  The meanest subject of our realms above?\n  Where'er the sun's refulgent rays are cast,\n  Thy power is honour'd, and thy fame shall last.\n  But yon proud work no future age shall view,\n  No trace remain where once the glory grew.\n  The sapp'd foundations by thy force shall fall,\n  And, whelm'd beneath the waves, drop the huge wall:\n  Vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore:\n  The ruin vanish'd, and the name no more.\"\n\n  Thus they in heaven: while, o'er the Grecian train,\n  The rolling sun descending to the main\n  Beheld the finish'd work. Their bulls they slew;\n  Back from the tents the savoury vapour flew.\n  And now the fleet, arrived from Lemnos' strands,\n  With Bacchus' blessings cheered the generous bands.\n  Of fragrant wines the rich Eunaeus sent\n  A thousant measures to the royal tent.\n  (Eunaeus, whom Hypsipyle of yore\n  To Jason, shepherd of his people, bore,)\n  The rest they purchased at their proper cost,\n  And well the plenteous freight supplied the host:\n  Each, in exchange, proportion'd treasures gave;(188)\n  Some, brass or iron; some, an ox, or slave.\n  All night they feast, the Greek and Trojan powers:\n  Those on the fields, and these within their towers.\n  But Jove averse the signs of wrath display'd,\n  And shot red lightnings through the gloomy shade:\n  Humbled they stood; pale horror seized on all,\n  While the deep thunder shook the aerial hall.\n  Each pour'd to Jove before the bowl was crown'd;\n  And large libations drench'd the thirsty ground:\n  Then late, refresh'd with sleep from toils of fight,\n  Enjoy'd the balmy blessings of the night.\n\n               [Illustration: GREEK AMPHORA--WINE VESSELS.]\n\n                       GREEK AMPHORA--WINE VESSELS.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VIII.\n\n\nARGUMENT.\n\nTHE SECOND BATTLE, AND THE DISTRESS OF THE GREEKS.\n\nJupiter assembles a council of the deities, and threatens them with the\npains of Tartarus if they assist either side: Minerva only obtains of him\nthat she may direct the Greeks by her counsels.(189) his balances the\nfates of both, and affrights the Greeks with his thunders and lightnings.\nNestor alone continues in the field in great danger: Diomed relieves him;\nwhose exploits, and those of Hector, are excellently described. Juno\nendeavours to animate Neptune to the assistance of the Greeks, but in\nvain. The acts of Teucer, who is at length wounded by Hector, and carried\noff. Juno and Minerva prepare to aid the Grecians, but are restrained by\nIris, sent from Jupiter. The night puts an end to the battle. Hector\ncontinues in the field, (the Greeks being driven to their fortifications\nbefore the ships,) and gives orders to keep the watch all night in the\ncamp, to prevent the enemy from re-embarking and escaping by flight. They\nkindle fires through all the fields, and pass the night under arms.\n\nThe time of seven and twenty days is employed from the opening of the poem\nto the end of this book. The scene here (except of the celestial machines)\nlies in the field towards the seashore.\n\n  Aurora now, fair daughter of the dawn,\n  Sprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn;\n  When Jove convened the senate of the skies,\n  Where high Olympus' cloudy tops arise,\n  The sire of gods his awful silence broke;\n  The heavens attentive trembled as he spoke:\n\n  \"Celestial states! immortal gods! give ear,\n  Hear our decree, and reverence what ye hear;\n  The fix'd decree which not all heaven can move;\n  Thou, fate! fulfil it! and, ye powers, approve!\n  What god but enters yon forbidden field,\n  Who yields assistance, or but wills to yield,\n  Back to the skies with shame he shall be driven,\n  Gash'd with dishonest wounds, the scorn of heaven;\n  Or far, oh far, from steep Olympus thrown,\n  Low in the dark Tartarean gulf shall groan,\n  With burning chains fix'd to the brazen floors,\n  And lock'd by hell's inexorable doors;\n  As deep beneath the infernal centre hurl'd,(190)\n  As from that centre to the ethereal world.\n  Let him who tempts me, dread those dire abodes:\n  And know, the Almighty is the god of gods.\n  League all your forces, then, ye powers above,\n  Join all, and try the omnipotence of Jove.\n  Let down our golden everlasting chain(191)\n  Whose strong embrace holds heaven, and earth, and main\n  Strive all, of mortal and immortal birth,\n  To drag, by this, the Thunderer down to earth\n  Ye strive in vain! if I but stretch this hand,\n  I heave the gods, the ocean, and the land;\n  I fix the chain to great Olympus' height,\n  And the vast world hangs trembling in my sight!\n  For such I reign, unbounded and above;\n  And such are men, and gods, compared to Jove.\"\n\n  The all-mighty spoke, nor durst the powers reply:\n  A reverend horror silenced all the sky;\n  Trembling they stood before their sovereign's look;\n  At length his best-beloved, the power of wisdom, spoke:\n\n  \"O first and greatest! God, by gods adored\n  We own thy might, our father and our lord!\n  But, ah! permit to pity human state:\n  If not to help, at least lament their fate.\n  From fields forbidden we submiss refrain,\n  With arms unaiding mourn our Argives slain;\n  Yet grant my counsels still their breasts may move,\n  Or all must perish in the wrath of Jove.\"\n\n  The cloud-compelling god her suit approved,\n  And smiled superior on his best beloved;\n  Then call'd his coursers, and his chariot took;\n  The stedfast firmament beneath them shook:\n  Rapt by the ethereal steeds the chariot roll'd;\n  Brass were their hoofs, their curling manes of gold:\n  Of heaven's undrossy gold the gods array,\n  Refulgent, flash'd intolerable day.\n  High on the throne he shines: his coursers fly\n  Between the extended earth and starry sky.\n  But when to Ida's topmost height he came,\n  (Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game,)\n  Where o'er her pointed summits proudly raised,\n  His fane breathed odours, and his altar blazed:\n  There, from his radiant car, the sacred sire\n  Of gods and men released the steeds of fire:\n  Blue ambient mists the immortal steeds embraced;\n  High on the cloudy point his seat he placed;\n  Thence his broad eye the subject world surveys,\n  The town, and tents, and navigable seas.\n\n  Now had the Grecians snatch'd a short repast,\n  And buckled on their shining arms with haste.\n  Troy roused as soon; for on this dreadful day\n  The fate of fathers, wives, and infants lay.\n  The gates unfolding pour forth all their train;\n  Squadrons on squadrons cloud the dusky plain:\n  Men, steeds, and chariots shake the trembling ground,\n  The tumult thickens, and the skies resound;\n  And now with shouts the shocking armies closed,\n  To lances lances, shields to shields opposed,\n  Host against host with shadowy legends drew,\n  The sounding darts in iron tempests flew;\n  Victors and vanquish'd join promiscuous cries,\n  Triumphant shouts and dying groans arise;\n  With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,\n  And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.\n  Long as the morning beams, increasing bright,\n  O'er heaven's clear azure spread the sacred light,\n  Commutual death the fate of war confounds,\n  Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.\n  But when the sun the height of heaven ascends,\n  The sire of gods his golden scales suspends,(192)\n  With equal hand: in these explored the fate\n  Of Greece and Troy, and poised the mighty weight:\n  Press'd with its load, the Grecian balance lies\n  Low sunk on earth, the Trojan strikes the skies.\n  Then Jove from Ida's top his horrors spreads;\n  The clouds burst dreadful o'er the Grecian heads;\n  Thick lightnings flash; the muttering thunder rolls;\n  Their strength he withers, and unmans their souls.\n  Before his wrath the trembling hosts retire;\n  The gods in terrors, and the skies on fire.\n  Nor great Idomeneus that sight could bear,\n  Nor each stern Ajax, thunderbolts of war:\n  Nor he, the king of war, the alarm sustain'd\n  Nestor alone, amidst the storm remain'd.\n  Unwilling he remain'd, for Paris' dart\n  Had pierced his courser in a mortal part;\n  Fix'd in the forehead, where the springing man\n  Curl'd o'er the brow, it stung him to the brain;\n  Mad with his anguish, he begins to rear,\n  Paw with his hoofs aloft, and lash the air.\n  Scarce had his falchion cut the reins, and freed\n  The encumber'd chariot from the dying steed,\n  When dreadful Hector, thundering through the war,\n  Pour'd to the tumult on his whirling car.\n  That day had stretch'd beneath his matchless hand\n  The hoary monarch of the Pylian band,\n  But Diomed beheld; from forth the crowd\n  He rush'd, and on Ulysses call'd aloud:\n\n  \"Whither, oh whither does Ulysses run?\n  Oh, flight unworthy great Laertes' son!\n  Mix'd with the vulgar shall thy fate be found,\n  Pierced in the back, a vile, dishonest wound?\n  Oh turn and save from Hector's direful rage\n  The glory of the Greeks, the Pylian sage.\"\n  His fruitless words are lost unheard in air,\n  Ulysses seeks the ships, and shelters there.\n  But bold Tydides to the rescue goes,\n  A single warrior midst a host of foes;\n  Before the coursers with a sudden spring\n  He leap'd, and anxious thus bespoke the king:\n\n  \"Great perils, father!

(Tydides thus replies)\n  Thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.\n  But ah, what grief! should haughty Hector boast\n  I fled inglorious to the guarded coast.\n  Before that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,\n  O'erwhelm me, earth; and hide a warrior's shame!\"\n  To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:(194)\n  \"Gods! can thy courage fear the Phrygian's pride?\n  Hector may vaunt, but who shall heed the boast?\n  Not those who felt thy arm, the Dardan host,\n  Nor Troy, yet bleeding in her heroes lost;\n  Not even a Phrygian dame, who dreads the sword\n  That laid in dust her loved, lamented lord.\"\n  He said, and, hasty, o'er the gasping throng\n  Drives the swift steeds: the chariot smokes along;\n  The shouts of Trojans thicken in the wind;\n  The storm of hissing javelins pours behind.\n  Then with a voice that shakes the solid skies,\n  Pleased, Hector braves the warrior as he flies.\n  \"Go, mighty hero! graced above the rest\n  In seats of council and the sumptuous feast:\n  Now hope no more those honours from thy train;\n  Go less than woman, in the form of man!\n  To scale our walls, to wrap our towers in flames,\n  To lead in exile the fair Phrygian dames,\n  Thy once proud hopes, presumptuous prince! are fled;\n  This arm shall reach thy heart, and stretch thee dead.\"\n\n  Now fears dissuade him, and now hopes invite.\n  To stop his coursers, and to stand the fight;\n  Thrice turn'd the chief, and thrice imperial Jove\n  On Ida's summits thunder'd from above.\n  Great Hector heard; he saw the flashing light,\n  (The sign of conquest,) and thus urged the fight:\n\n  \"Hear, every Trojan, Lycian, Dardan band,\n  All famed in war, and dreadful hand to hand.\n  Be mindful of the wreaths your arms have won,\n  Your great forefathers' glories, and your own.\n  Heard ye the voice of Jove? Success and fame\n  Await on Troy, on Greece eternal shame.\n  In vain they skulk behind their boasted wall,\n  Weak bulwarks; destined by this arm to fall.\n  High o'er their slighted trench our steeds shall bound,\n  And pass victorious o'er the levell'd mound.\n  Soon as before yon hollow ships we stand,\n  Fight each with flames, and toss the blazing brand;\n  Till, their proud navy wrapt in smoke and fires,\n  All Greece, encompass'd, in one blaze expires.\"\n\n  Furious he said; then bending o'er the yoke,\n  Encouraged his proud steeds, while thus he spoke:\n\n  \"Now, Xanthus, AEthon, Lampus, urge the chase,\n  And thou, Podargus! prove thy generous race;\n  Be fleet, be fearless, this important day,\n  And all your master's well-spent care repay.\n  For this, high-fed, in plenteous stalls ye stand,\n  Served with pure wheat, and by a princess' hand;\n  For this my spouse, of great Aetion's line,\n  So oft has steep'd the strengthening grain in wine.\n  Now swift pursue, now thunder uncontroll'd:\n  Give me to seize rich Nestor's shield of gold;\n  From Tydeus' shoulders strip the costly load,\n  Vulcanian arms, the labour of a god:\n  These if we gain, then victory, ye powers!\n  This night, this glorious night, the fleet is ours!\"\n\n  That heard, deep anguish stung Saturnia's soul;\n  She shook her throne, that shook the starry pole:\n  And thus to Neptune: \"Thou, whose force can make\n  The stedfast earth from her foundations shake,\n  Seest thou the Greeks by fates unjust oppress'd,\n  Nor swells thy heart in that immortal breast?\n  Yet AEgae, Helice, thy power obey,(195)\n  And gifts unceasing on thine altars lay.\n  Would all the deities of Greece combine,\n  In vain the gloomy Thunderer might repine:\n  Sole should he sit, with scarce a god to friend,\n  And see his Trojans to the shades descend:\n  Such be the scene from his Idaean bower;\n  Ungrateful prospect to the sullen power!\"\n\n  Neptune with wrath rejects the rash design:\n  \"What rage, what madness, furious queen! is thine?\n  I war not with the highest. All above\n  Submit and tremble at the hand of Jove.\"\n\n  Now godlike Hector, to whose matchless might\n  Jove gave the glory of the destined fight,\n  Squadrons on squadrons drives, and fills the fields\n  With close-ranged chariots, and with thicken'd shields.\n  Where the deep trench in length extended lay,\n  Compacted troops stand wedged in firm array,\n  A dreadful front! they shake the brands, and threat\n  With long-destroying flames the hostile fleet.\n  The king of men, by Juno's self inspired,\n  Toil'd through the tents, and all his army fired.\n  Swift as he moved, he lifted in his hand\n  His purple robe, bright ensign of command.\n  High on the midmost bark the king appear'd:\n  There, from Ulysses' deck, his voice was heard:\n  To Ajax and Achilles reach'd the sound,\n  Whose distant ships the guarded navy bound.\n  \"O Argives! shame of human race!

(the monarch cried)\n  Thus, always thus, thy early worth be tried;\n  Thy brave example shall retrieve our host,\n  Thy country's saviour, and thy father's boast!\n  Sprung from an alien's bed thy sire to grace,\n  The vigorous offspring of a stolen embrace:\n  Proud of his boy, he own'd the generous flame,\n  And the brave son repays his cares with fame.\n  Now hear a monarch's vow: If heaven's high powers\n  Give me to raze Troy's long-defended towers;\n  Whatever treasures Greece for me design,\n  The next rich honorary gift be thine:\n  Some golden tripod, or distinguished car,\n  With coursers dreadful in the ranks of war:\n  Or some fair captive, whom thy eyes approve,\n  Shall recompense the warrior's toils with love.\"\n\n  To this the chief: \"With praise the rest inspire,\n  Nor urge a soul already fill'd with fire.\n  What strength I have, be now in battle tried,\n  Till every shaft in Phrygian blood be dyed.\n  Since rallying from our wall we forced the foe,\n  Still aim'd at Hector have I bent my bow:\n  Eight forky arrows from this hand have fled,\n  And eight bold heroes by their points lie dead:\n  But sure some god denies me to destroy\n  This fury of the field, this dog of Troy.\"\n\n  He said, and twang'd the string. The weapon flies\n  At Hector's breast, and sings along the skies:\n  He miss'd the mark; but pierced Gorgythio's heart,\n  And drench'd in royal blood the thirsty dart.\n  (Fair Castianira, nymph of form divine,\n  This offspring added to king Priam's line.)\n  As full-blown poppies, overcharged with rain,(196)\n  Decline the head, and drooping kiss the plain;\n  So sinks the youth: his beauteous head, depress'd\n  Beneath his helmet, drops upon his breast.\n  Another shaft the raging archer drew,\n  That other shaft with erring fury flew,\n  (From Hector, Phoebus turn'd the flying wound,)\n  Yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground:\n  Thy breast, brave Archeptolemus! it tore,\n  And dipp'd its feathers in no vulgar gore.\n  Headlong he falls: his sudden fall alarms\n  The steeds, that startle at his sounding arms.\n  Hector with grief his charioteer beheld\n  All pale and breathless on the sanguine field:\n  Then bids Cebriones direct the rein,\n  Quits his bright car, and issues on the plain.\n  Dreadful he shouts: from earth a stone he took,\n  And rush'd on Teucer with the lifted rock.\n  The youth already strain'd the forceful yew;\n  The shaft already to his shoulder drew;\n  The feather in his hand, just wing'd for flight,\n  Touch'd where the neck and hollow chest unite;\n  There, where the juncture knits the channel bone,\n  The furious chief discharged the craggy stone:\n  The bow-string burst beneath the ponderous blow,\n  And his numb'd hand dismiss'd his useless bow.\n  He fell: but Ajax his broad shield display'd,\n  And screen'd his brother with the mighty shade;\n  Till great Alaster, and Mecistheus, bore\n  The batter'd archer groaning to the shore.\n\n  Troy yet found grace before the Olympian sire,\n  He arm'd their hands, and fill'd their breasts with fire.\n  The Greeks repulsed, retreat behind their wall,\n  Or in the trench on heaps confusedly fall.\n  First of the foe, great Hector march'd along,\n  With terror clothed, and more than mortal strong.\n  As the bold hound, that gives the lion chase,\n  With beating bosom, and with eager pace,\n  Hangs on his haunch, or fastens on his heels,\n  Guards as he turns, and circles as he wheels;\n  Thus oft the Grecians turn'd, but still they flew;\n  Thus following, Hector still the hindmost slew.\n  When flying they had pass'd the trench profound,\n  And many a chief lay gasping on the ground;\n  Before the ships a desperate stand they made,\n  And fired the troops, and called the gods to aid.\n  Fierce on his rattling chariot Hector came:\n  His eyes like Gorgon shot a sanguine flame\n  That wither'd all their host: like Mars he stood:\n  Dire as the monster, dreadful as the god!\n  Their strong distress the wife of Jove survey'd;\n  Then pensive thus, to war's triumphant maid:\n\n  \"O daughter of that god, whose arm can wield\n  The avenging bolt, and shake the sable shield!\n  Now, in this moment of her last despair,\n  Shall wretched Greece no more confess our care,\n  Condemn'd to suffer the full force of fate,\n  And drain the dregs of heaven's relentless hate?\n  Gods! shall one raging hand thus level all?\n  What numbers fell! what numbers yet shall fall!\n  What power divine shall Hector's wrath assuage?\n  Still swells the slaughter, and still grows the rage!\"\n\n  So spake the imperial regent of the skies;\n  To whom the goddess with the azure eyes:\n\n  \"Long since had Hector stain'd these fields with gore,\n  Stretch'd by some Argive on his native shore:\n  But he above, the sire of heaven, withstands,\n  Mocks our attempts, and slights our just demands;\n  The stubborn god, inflexible and hard,\n  Forgets my service and deserved reward:\n  Saved I, for this, his favourite son distress'd,\n  By stern Eurystheus with long labours press'd?\n  He begg'd, with tears he begg'd, in deep dismay;\n  I shot from heaven, and gave his arm the day.\n  Oh had my wisdom known this dire event,\n  When to grim Pluto's gloomy gates he went;\n  The triple dog had never felt his chain,\n  Nor Styx been cross'd, nor hell explored in vain.\n  Averse to me of all his heaven of gods,\n  At Thetis' suit the partial Thunderer nods;\n  To grace her gloomy, fierce, resenting son,\n  My hopes are frustrate, and my Greeks undone.\n  Some future day, perhaps, he may be moved\n  To call his blue-eyed maid his best beloved.\n  Haste, launch thy chariot, through yon ranks to ride;\n  Myself will arm, and thunder at thy side.\n  Then, goddess! say, shall Hector glory then?\n  (That terror of the Greeks, that man of men)\n  When Juno's self, and Pallas shall appear,\n  All dreadful in the crimson walks of war!\n  What mighty Trojan then, on yonder shore,\n  Expiring, pale, and terrible no more,\n  Shall feast the fowls, and glut the dogs with gore?\"\n\n  She ceased, and Juno rein'd the steeds with care:\n  (Heaven's awful empress, Saturn's other heir:)\n  Pallas, meanwhile, her various veil unbound,\n  With flowers adorn'd, with art immortal crown'd;\n  The radiant robe her sacred fingers wove\n  Floats in rich waves, and spreads the court of Jove.\n  Her father's arms her mighty limbs invest,\n  His cuirass blazes on her ample breast.\n  The vigorous power the trembling car ascends:\n  Shook by her arm, the massy javelin bends:\n  Huge, ponderous, strong! that when her fury burns\n  Proud

heaven with clouds, or roll those clouds away.\n  The sounding hinges ring, the clouds divide.\n  Prone down the steep of heaven their course they guide.\n  But Jove, incensed, from Ida's top

powers,\n  And let the matrons hang with lights the towers;\n  Lest, under covert of the midnight shade,\n  The insidious foe the naked town invade.\n  Suffice, to-night, these orders to obey;\n  A nobler charge shall rouse the dawning day.\n  The gods, I trust, shall give to Hector's hand\n  From these detested foes to free the land,\n  Who plough'd, with fates averse, the watery way:\n  For

Diomed opposes this, and Nestor\nseconds him, praising his wisdom and resolution. He orders the guard to be\nstrengthened, and a council summoned to deliberate what measures are to be\nfollowed in this emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice, and Nestor\nfurther prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles, in order to\nmove him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice of, who are\naccompanied by old Phoenix. They make, each of them, very moving and\npressing speeches, but are rejected with roughness by Achilles, who\nnotwithstanding retains Phoenix in his tent. The ambassadors return\nunsuccessfully to the camp, and the troops betake themselves to sleep.\n\nThis book, and the next following, take up the space of one night, which\nis the twenty-seventh from the beginning of the poem. The scene lies on\nthe sea-shore, the station of the Grecian ships.\n\n  Thus joyful Troy maintain'd the watch of night;\n  While fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,(199)\n  And heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part,\n  Sat on each face, and sadden'd every heart.\n  As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,\n  A double tempest of the west and north\n  Swells o'er the sea, from Thracia's frozen shore,\n  Heaps waves on waves, and bids the AEgean roar:\n  This way and that the boiling deeps are toss'd:\n  Such various passions urged the troubled host,\n  Great Agamemnon grieved above the rest;\n  Superior sorrows swell'd his royal breast;\n  Himself his orders to the heralds bears,\n  To bid to council all the Grecian peers,\n  But bid in whispers: these surround their chief,\n  In solemn sadness and majestic grief.\n  The king amidst the mournful circle rose:\n  Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.\n  So silent fountains, from a rock's tall head,\n  In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.\n  With more than vulgar grief he stood oppress'd;\n  Words, mix'd with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:\n\n  \"Ye sons of Greece! partake your leader's care;\n  Fellows in arms and princes of the war!\n  Of partial Jove too justly we complain,\n  And heavenly oracles believed in vain.\n  A safe return was promised to our toils,\n  With conquest honour'd and enrich'd with spoils:\n  Now shameful flight alone can save the host;\n  Our wealth, our people, and our glory lost.\n  So Jove decrees, almighty lord of all!\n  Jove, at whose nod whole empires rise or fall,\n  Who shakes the feeble props of human trust,\n  And towers and armies humbles to the dust.\n  Haste then, for ever quit these fatal fields,\n  Haste to the joys our native country yields;\n  Spread all your canvas, all your oars employ,\n  Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.\"\n\n  He said: deep silence held the Grecian band;\n  Silent, unmov'd in dire dismay they stand;\n  A pensive scene! till Tydeus' warlike son\n  Roll'd on the king his eyes, and thus begun:\n  \"When kings advise us to renounce our fame,\n  First let him speak who first has suffer'd shame.\n  If I oppose thee, prince! thy wrath withhold,\n  The laws of council bid my tongue be bold.\n  Thou first, and thou alone, in fields of fight,\n  Durst brand my courage, and defame my might:\n  Nor from a friend the unkind reproach appear'd,\n  The Greeks stood witness, all our army heard.\n  The gods, O chief! from whom our honours spring,\n  The gods have made thee but by halves a king:\n  They gave thee sceptres, and a wide command;\n  They gave dominion o'er the seas and land;\n  The noblest power that might the world control\n  They gave thee not--a brave and virtuous soul.\n  Is this a general's voice, that would suggest\n  Fears like his own to every Grecian breast?\n  Confiding in our want of worth, he stands;\n  And if we fly, 'tis what our king commands.\n  Go thou, inglorious! from the embattled plain;\n  Ships thou hast store, and nearest to the main;\n  A noble care the Grecians shall employ,\n  To combat, conquer, and extirpate Troy.\n  Here Greece shall stay; or, if all Greece retire,\n  Myself shall stay, till Troy or I expire;\n  Myself, and Sthenelus, will fight for fame;\n  God bade us fight, and 'twas with God we came.\"\n\n  He ceased; the Greeks loud acclamations raise,\n  And voice to voice resounds Tydides' praise.\n  Wise Nestor then his reverend figure rear'd;\n  He spoke: the host in still attention heard:(200)\n\n  \"O truly great! in whom the gods have join'd\n  Such strength of body with such force of mind:\n  In conduct, as in courage, you excel,\n  Still first to act what you advise so well.\n  These wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves,\n  Applauding Greece with common voice approves.\n  Kings thou canst blame; a bold but prudent youth:\n  And blame even kings with praise, because with truth.\n  And yet those years that since thy birth have run\n  Would hardly style thee Nestor's youngest son.\n  Then let me add what yet remains behind,\n  A thought unfinish'd in that generous mind;\n  Age bids me speak! nor shall the advice I bring\n  Distaste the people, or offend the king:\n\n  \"Cursed is the man, and void of law and right,\n  Unworthy property, unworthy light,\n  Unfit for public rule, or private care,\n  That wretch, that monster, who delights in war;\n  Whose lust is murder, and whose horrid joy,\n  To tear his country, and his kind destroy!\n  This night, refresh and fortify thy train;\n  Between the trench and wall let guards remain:\n  Be that the duty of the young and bold;\n  But thou, O king, to council call the old;\n  Great is thy sway, and weighty are thy cares;\n  Thy high commands must spirit all our wars.\n  With Thracian wines recruit thy honour'd guests,\n  For happy counsels flow from sober feasts.\n  Wise, weighty counsels aid a state distress'd,\n  And such a monarch as can choose the best.\n  See what a blaze from hostile tents aspires,\n  How near our fleet approach the Trojan fires!\n  Who can, unmoved, behold the dreadful light?\n  What eye beholds them, and can close to-night?\n  This dreadful interval determines all;\n  To-morrow, Troy must flame, or Greece must fall.\"\n\n  Thus spoke the hoary sage: the rest obey;\n  Swift through the gates the guards direct their way.\n  His son was first to pass the lofty mound,\n  The generous Thrasymed, in arms renown'd:\n  Next him, Ascalaphus, Ialmen, stood,\n  The double offspring of the warrior-god:\n  Deipyrus, Aphareus, Merion join,\n  And Lycomed of Creon's noble line.\n  Seven were the leaders of the nightly bands,\n  And each bold chief a hundred spears commands.\n  The fires they light, to short repasts they fall,\n  Some line the trench, and others man the wall.\n\n  The king of men, on public counsels bent,\n  Convened the princes in his ample tent,\n  Each seized a portion of the kingly feast,\n  But stay'd his hand when thirst and hunger ceased.\n  Then Nestor spoke, for wisdom long approved,\n  And slowly rising, thus the council moved.\n\n  \"Monarch of nations! whose superior sway\n  Assembled states, and lords of earth obey,\n  The laws and sceptres to thy hand are given,\n  And millions own the care of thee and Heaven.\n  O king! the counsels of my age attend;\n  With thee my cares begin, with thee must end.\n  Thee, prince! it fits alike to speak and hear,\n  Pronounce with judgment, with regard give ear,\n  To see no wholesome motion be withstood,\n  And ratify the best for public good.\n  Nor, though a meaner give advice, repine,\n  But follow it, and make the wisdom thine.\n  Hear then a thought, not now conceived in haste,\n  At once my present judgment and my past.\n  When from Pelides' tent you forced the maid,\n  I first opposed, and faithful, durst dissuade;\n  But bold of soul, when headlong fury fired,\n  You wronged the man, by men and gods admired:\n  Now seek some means his fatal wrath to end,\n  With prayers to move him, or with gifts to bend.\"\n\n  To whom the king. \"With justice hast thou shown\n  A prince's faults, and I with reason own.\n  That happy man, whom Jove still honours most,\n  Is more than armies, and himself a host.\n  Bless'd in his love, this wondrous hero stands;\n  Heaven fights his war, and humbles all our bands.\n  Fain would my heart, which err'd through frantic rage,\n  The wrathful chief and angry gods assuage.\n  If gifts immense his mighty soul can bow,(201)\n  Hear, all ye Greeks, and witness what I vow.\n  Ten weighty talents of the purest gold,\n  And twice ten vases of refulgent mould:\n  Seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame\n  Yet knows no office, nor has felt the flame;\n  Twelve steeds unmatch'd in fleetness and in force,\n  And still victorious in the dusty course;\n  (Rich were the man whose ample stores exceed\n  The prizes purchased by their winged speed;)\n  Seven lovely captives of the Lesbian line,\n  Skill'd in each art, unmatch'd in form divine,\n  The same I chose for more than vulgar charms,\n  When Lesbos sank beneath the hero's arms:\n  All these, to buy his friendship, shall be paid,\n  And join'd with these the long-contested maid;\n  With all her charms, Briseis I resign,\n  And solemn swear those charms were never mine;\n  Untouch'd she stay'd, uninjured she removes,\n  Pure from my arms, and guiltless of my loves,(202)\n  These instant shall be his; and if the powers\n  Give to our arms proud Ilion's hostile towers,\n  Then shall he store (when Greece the spoil divides)\n  With gold and brass his loaded navy's sides:\n  Besides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race\n  With copious love shall crown his warm embrace,\n  Such as himself will choose; who yield to none,\n  Or yield to Helen's heavenly charms alone.\n  Yet hear me further: when our wars are o'er,\n  If safe we land on Argos' fruitful shore,\n  There shall he live my son, our honours share,\n  And with Orestes' self divide my care.\n  Yet more--three daughters in my court are bred,\n  And each well worthy of a royal bed;\n  Laodice and Iphigenia fair,(203)\n  And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair;\n  Her let him choose whom most his eyes approve,\n  I ask no presents, no reward for love:\n  Myself will give the dower; so vast a store\n  As never father gave a child before.\n  Seven ample cities shall confess his sway,\n  Him Enope, and Pherae him obey,\n  Cardamyle with ample turrets crown'd,\n  And sacred Pedasus for vines renown'd;\n  AEpea fair, the pastures Hira yields,\n  And rich Antheia with her flowery fields:(204)\n  The whole extent to Pylos' sandy plain,\n  Along the verdant margin of the main\n  There heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil;\n  Bold are the men, and generous is the soil;\n  There shall he reign, with power and justice crown'd,\n  And rule the tributary realms around.\n  All this I give, his vengeance to control,\n  And sure all this may move his mighty soul.\n  Pluto, the grisly god, who never spares,\n  Who feels no mercy, and who hears no prayers,\n  Lives dark and dreadful in deep hell's abodes,\n  And mortals hate him, as the worst of gods\n  Great though he be, it fits him to obey,\n  Since more than his my years, and more my sway.\"\n\n                          [Illustration: PLUTO.]\n\n                                  PLUTO.\n\n\n  The monarch thus. The reverend Nestor then:\n  \"Great Agamemnon! glorious king of men!\n  Such are thy offers as a prince may take,\n  And such as fits a generous king to make.\n  Let chosen delegates this hour be sent\n  (Myself will name them) to Pelides' tent.\n  Let Phoenix lead, revered for hoary age,\n  Great Ajax next, and Ithacus the sage.\n  Yet more to sanctify the word you send,\n  Let Hodius and Eurybates attend.\n  Now pray to Jove to grant what Greece demands;\n  Pray in deep silence,(205) and with purest hands.\"(206)\n\n                 [Illustration: THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.]\n\n                         THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.\n\n\n  He said; and all approved. The heralds bring\n  The cleansing water from the living spring.\n  The youth with wine the sacred goblets crown'd,\n  And large libations drench'd the sands around.\n  The rite perform'd, the chiefs their thirst allay,\n  Then from the royal tent they take their way;\n  Wise Nestor turns on each his careful eye,\n  Forbids to offend, instructs them to apply;\n  Much he advised them all, Ulysses most,\n  To deprecate the chief, and save the host.\n  Through the still night they march, and hear the roar\n  Of murmuring billows on the sounding shore.\n  To Neptune, ruler of the seas profound,\n  Whose liquid arms the mighty globe surround,\n  They pour forth vows, their embassy to bless,\n  And calm the rage of stern AEacides.\n  And now, arrived, where on the sandy bay\n  The Myrmidonian tents and vessels lay;\n  Amused at ease, the godlike man they found,\n  Pleased with the solemn harp's harmonious sound.\n  (The well wrought harp from conquered Thebae came;\n  Of polish'd silver was its costly frame.)\n  With this he soothes his angry soul, and sings\n  The immortal deeds of heroes and of kings.\n  Patroclus only of the royal train,\n  Placed in his tent, attends the lofty strain:\n  Full opposite he sat, and listen'd long,\n  In silence waiting till he ceased the song.\n  Unseen the Grecian embassy proceeds\n  To his high tent; the great Ulysses leads.\n  Achilles starting, as the chiefs he spied,\n  Leap'd from his seat, and laid the harp aside.\n  With like surprise arose Menoetius' son:\n  Pelides grasp'd their hands, and thus begun:\n\n  \"Princes, all hail! whatever brought you here.\n  Or strong necessity, or urgent fear;\n  Welcome, though Greeks! for not as foes ye came;\n  To me more dear than all that bear the name.\"\n\n  With that, the chiefs beneath his roof he led,\n  And placed in seats with purple carpets spread.\n  Then thus--\"Patroclus, crown a larger bowl,\n  Mix purer wine, and open every soul.\n  Of all the warriors yonder host can send,\n  Thy friend most honours these, and these thy friend.\"\n\n  He said: Patroclus o'er the blazing fire\n  Heaps in a brazen vase three chines entire:\n  The brazen vase Automedon sustains,\n  Which flesh of porker, sheep, and goat contains.\n  Achilles at the genial feast presides,\n  The parts transfixes, and with skill divides.\n  Meanwhile Patroclus sweats, the fire to raise;\n  The tent is brighten'd with the rising blaze:\n  Then, when the languid flames at length subside,\n  He strows a bed of glowing embers wide,\n  Above the coals the smoking fragments turns\n  And sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns;\n  With bread the glittering canisters they load,\n  Which round the board Menoetius' son bestow'd;\n  Himself, opposed to Ulysses full in sight,\n  Each portion parts, and orders every rite.\n  The first fat offering to the immortals due,\n  Amidst the greedy flames Patroclus threw;\n  Then each, indulging in the social feast,\n  His thirst and hunger soberly repress'd.\n  That done, to Phoenix Ajax gave the sign:\n  Not unperceived; Ulysses crown'd with wine\n  The foaming bowl, and instant thus began,\n  His speech addressing to the godlike man.\n\n  \"Health to Achilles! happy are thy guests!\n  Not those more honour'd whom Atrides feasts:\n  Though generous plenty crown thy loaded boards,\n  That, Agamemnon's regal tent affords;\n  But greater cares sit heavy on our souls,\n  Nor eased by banquets or by flowing bowls.\n  What scenes of slaughter in yon fields appear!\n  The dead we mourn, and for the living fear;\n  Greece on the brink of fate all doubtful stands,\n  And owns no help but from thy saving hands:\n  Troy and her aids for ready vengeance call;\n  Their threatening tents already shade our wall:\n  Hear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim,\n  And point at every ship their vengeful flame!\n  For them the father of the gods declares,\n  Theirs are his omens, and his thunder theirs.\n  See, full of Jove, avenging Hector rise!\n  See! heaven and earth the raging chief defies;\n  What fury in his breast, what lightning in his eyes!\n  He waits but for the morn, to sink in flame\n  The ships, the Greeks, and all the Grecian name.\n  Heavens! how my country's woes distract my mind,\n  Lest Fate accomplish all his rage design'd!\n  And must we, gods! our heads inglorious lay\n  In Trojan dust, and this the fatal day?\n  Return, Achilles: oh return, though late,\n  To save thy Greeks, and stop the course of Fate;\n  If in that heart or grief or courage lies,\n  Rise to redeem; ah, yet to conquer, rise!\n  The day may come, when, all our warriors slain,\n  That heart shall melt, that courage rise in vain:\n  Regard in time, O prince divinely brave!\n  Those wholesome counsels which thy father gave.\n  When Peleus in his aged arms embraced\n  His parting son, these accents were his last:\n\n  \"'My child! with strength, with glory, and success,\n  Thy arms may Juno and Minerva bless!\n  Trust that to Heaven: but thou, thy cares engage\n  To calm thy passions, and subdue thy rage:\n  From gentler manners let thy glory grow,\n  And shun contention, the sure source of woe;\n  That young and old may in thy praise combine,\n  The virtues of humanity be thine--'\n  This now-despised advice thy father gave;\n  Ah! check thy anger; and be truly brave.\n  If thou wilt yield to great Atrides' prayers,\n  Gifts worthy thee his royal hand prepares;\n  If not--but hear me, while I number o'er\n  The proffer'd presents, an exhaustless store.\n  Ten weighty talents of the purest gold,\n  And twice ten vases of refulgent mould;\n  Seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame\n  Yet knows no office, nor has felt the flame;\n  Twelve steeds unmatched in fleetness and in force,\n  And still victorious in the dusty course;\n  (Rich were the man, whose ample stores exceed\n  The prizes purchased by their winged speed;)\n  Seven lovely captives of the Lesbian line,\n  Skill'd in each art, unmatch'd in form divine,\n  The same he chose for more than vulgar charms,\n  When Lesbos sank beneath thy conquering arms.\n  All these, to buy thy friendship shall be paid,\n  And, join'd with these, the long-contested maid;\n  With all her charms, Briseis he'll resign,\n  And solemn swear those charms were only thine;\n  Untouch'd she stay'd, uninjured she removes,\n  Pure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.\n  These instant shall be thine; and if the powers\n  Give to our arms proud Ilion's hostile towers,\n  Then shalt thou store (when Greece the spoil divides)\n  With gold and brass thy loaded navy's sides.\n  Besides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race\n  With copious love shall crown thy warm embrace;\n  Such as thyself shall chose; who yield to none,\n  Or yield to Helen's heavenly charms alone.\n  Yet hear me further: when our wars are o'er,\n  If safe we land on Argos' fruitful shore,\n  There shalt thou live his son, his honour share,\n  And with Orestes' self divide his care.\n  Yet more--three daughters in his court are bred,\n  And each well worthy of a royal bed:\n  Laodice and Iphigenia fair,\n  And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair:\n  Her shalt thou wed whom most thy eyes approve;\n  He asks no presents, no reward for love:\n  Himself will give the dower; so vast a store\n  As never father gave a child before.\n  Seven ample cities shall confess thy sway,\n  The Enope and Pherae thee obey,\n  Cardamyle with ample turrets crown'd,\n  And sacred Pedasus, for vines renown'd:\n  AEpea fair, the pastures Hira yields,\n  And rich Antheia with her flowery fields;\n  The whole extent to Pylos' sandy plain,\n  Along the verdant margin of the main.\n  There heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil;\n  Bold are the men, and generous is the soil.\n  There shalt thou reign, with power and justice crown'd,\n  And rule the tributary realms around.\n  Such are the proffers which this day we bring,\n  Such the repentance of a suppliant king.\n  But if all this, relentless, thou disdain,\n  If honour and if interest plead in vain,\n  Yet some redress to suppliant Greece afford,\n  And be, amongst her guardian gods, adored.\n  If no regard thy suffering country claim,\n  Hear thy own glory, and the voice of fame:\n  For now that chief, whose unresisted ire\n  Made nations tremble, and whole hosts retire,\n  Proud Hector, now, the unequal fight demands,\n  And only triumphs to deserve thy hands.\"\n\n  Then thus the goddess-born: \"Ulysses, hear\n  A faithful speech, that knows nor art nor fear;\n  What in my secret soul is understood,\n  My tongue shall utter, and my deeds make good.\n  Let Greece then know, my purpose I retain:\n  Nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain.\n  Who dares think one thing, and another tell,\n  My heart detests him as the gates of hell.\n\n  \"Then thus in short my fix'd resolves attend,\n  Which nor Atrides nor his Greeks can bend;\n  Long toils, long perils in their cause I bore,\n  But now the unfruitful glories charm no more.\n  Fight or not fight, a like reward we claim,\n  The wretch and hero find their prize the same.\n  Alike regretted in the dust he lies,\n  Who yields ignobly, or who bravely dies.\n  Of all my dangers, all my glorious pains,\n  A life of labours, lo! what fruit remains?\n  As the bold bird her helpless young attends,\n  From danger guards them, and from want defends;\n  In search of prey she wings the spacious air,\n  And with the untasted food supplies her care:\n  For thankless Greece such hardships have I braved,\n  Her wives, her infants, by my labours saved;\n  Long sleepless nights in heavy arms I stood,\n  And sweat laborious days in dust and blood.\n  I sack'd twelve ample cities on the main,(207)\n  And twelve lay smoking on the Trojan plain:\n  Then at Atrides' haughty feet were laid\n  The wealth I gathered, and the spoils I made.\n  Your mighty monarch these in peace possess'd;\n  Some few my soldiers had, himself the rest.\n  Some present, too, to every prince was paid;\n  And every prince enjoys the gift he made:\n  I only must refund, of all his train;\n  See what pre-eminence our merits gain!\n  My spoil alone his greedy soul delights:\n  My spouse alone must bless his lustful nights:\n  The woman, let him (as he may) enjoy;\n  But what's the quarrel, then, of Greece to Troy?\n  What to these shores the assembled nations draws,\n  What calls for vengeance but a woman's cause?\n  Are fair endowments and a beauteous face\n  Beloved by none but those of Atreus' race?\n  The wife whom choice and passion doth approve,\n  Sure every wise and worthy man will love.\n  Nor did my fair one less distinction claim;\n  Slave as she was, my soul adored the dame.\n  Wrong'd in my love, all proffers I disdain;\n  Deceived for once, I trust not kings again.\n  Ye have my answer--what remains to do,\n  Your king, Ulysses, may consult with you.\n  What needs he the defence this arm can make?\n  Has he not walls no human force can shake?\n  Has he not fenced his guarded navy round\n  With piles, with ramparts, and a trench profound?\n  And will not these (the wonders he has done)\n  Repel the rage of Priam's single son?\n  There was a time ('twas when for Greece I fought)\n  When Hector's prowess no such wonders wrought;\n  He kept the verge of Troy, nor dared to wait\n  Achilles' fury at the Scaean gate;\n  He tried it once, and scarce was saved by fate.\n  But now those ancient enmities are o'er;\n  To-morrow we the favouring gods implore;\n  Then shall you see our parting vessels crown'd,\n  And hear with oars the Hellespont resound.\n  The third day hence shall Pthia greet our sails,(208)\n  If mighty Neptune send propitious gales;\n  Pthia to her Achilles shall restore\n  The wealth he left for this detested shore:\n  Thither the spoils of this long war shall pass,\n  The ruddy gold, the steel, and shining brass:\n  My beauteous captives thither I'll convey,\n  And all that rests of my unravish'd prey.\n  One only valued gift your tyrant gave,\n  And that resumed--the fair Lyrnessian slave.\n  Then tell him: loud, that all the Greeks may hear,\n  And learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear;\n  (For arm'd in impudence, mankind he braves,\n  And meditates new cheats on all his slaves;\n  Though shameless as he is, to face these eyes\n  Is what he dares not: if he dares he dies;)\n  Tell him, all terms, all commerce I decline,\n  Nor share his council, nor his battle join;\n  For once deceiv'd, was his; but twice were mine,\n  No--let the stupid prince, whom Jove deprives\n  Of sense and justice, run where frenzy drives;\n  His gifts are hateful: kings of such a kind\n  Stand but as slaves before a noble mind,\n  Not though he proffer'd all himself possess'd,\n  And all his rapine could from others wrest:\n  Not all the golden tides of wealth that crown\n  The many-peopled Orchomenian town;(209)\n  Not all proud Thebes' unrivall'd walls contain,\n  The world's great empress on the Egyptian plain\n  (That spreads her conquests o'er a thousand states,\n  And pours her heroes through a hundred gates,\n  Two hundred horsemen and two hundred cars\n  From each wide portal issuing to the wars);(210)\n  Though bribes were heap'd on bribes, in number more\n  Than dust in fields, or sands along the shore;\n  Should all these offers for my friendship call,\n  'Tis he that offers, and I scorn them all.\n  Atrides' daughter never shall be led\n  (An ill-match'd consort) to Achilles' bed;\n  Like golden Venus though she charm'd the heart,\n  And vied with Pallas in the works of art;\n  Some greater Greek let those high nuptials grace,\n  I hate alliance with a tyrant's race.\n  If heaven restore me to my realms with life,\n  The reverend Peleus shall elect my wife;\n  Thessalian nymphs there are of form divine,\n  And kings that sue to mix their blood with mine.\n  Bless'd in kind love, my years shall glide away,\n  Content with just hereditary sway;\n  There, deaf for ever to the martial strife,\n  Enjoy the dear prerogative of life.\n  Life is not to be bought with heaps of gold.\n  Not all Apollo's Pythian treasures hold,\n  Or Troy once held, in peace and pride of sway,\n  Can bribe the poor possession of a day!\n  Lost herds and treasures we by arms regain,\n  And steeds unrivall'd on the dusty plain:\n  But from our lips the vital spirit fled,\n  Returns no more to wake the silent dead.\n  My fates long since by Thetis were disclosed,\n  And each alternate, life or fame, proposed;\n  Here, if I stay, before the Trojan town,\n  Short is my date, but deathless my renown:\n  If I return, I quit immortal praise\n  For years on years, and long-extended days.\n  Convinced, though late, I find my fond mistake,\n  And warn the Greeks the wiser choice to make;\n  To quit these shores, their native seats enjoy,\n  Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.\n  Jove's arm display'd asserts her from the skies!\n  Her hearts are strengthen'd, and her glories rise.\n  Go then to Greece, report our fix'd design;\n  Bid all your counsels, all your armies join,\n  Let all your forces, all your arts conspire,\n  To save the ships, the troops, the chiefs, from fire.\n  One stratagem has fail'd, and others will:\n  Ye find, Achilles is unconquer'd still.\n  Go then--digest my message as ye may--\n  But here this night let reverend Phoenix stay:\n  His tedious toils and hoary hairs demand\n  A peaceful death in Pthia's friendly land.\n  But whether he remain or sail with me,\n  His age be sacred,

He takes no rest that\nnight, but passes through the camp, awaking the leaders, and contriving\nall possible methods for the public safety. Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses, and\nDiomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains. They call a\ncouncil of war, and determine to send scouts into the enemies' camp, to\nlearn their posture, and discover their intentions. Diomed undertakes this\nhazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for his companion. In\ntheir passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had sent on a like design\nto the camp of the Grecians. From him they are informed of the situation\nof the Trojan and auxiliary forces, and particularly of Rhesus, and the\nThracians who were lately arrived. They pass on with success; kill Rhesus,\nwith several of his officers, and seize the famous horses of that prince,\nwith which they return in triumph to the camp.\n\nThe same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps.\n\n  All night the chiefs before their vessels lay,\n  And lost in sleep the labours of the day:\n  All but the king: with various thoughts oppress'd,(215)\n  His country's cares lay rolling in his breast.\n  As when by lightnings Jove's ethereal power\n  Foretels the rattling hail, or weighty shower,\n  Or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore,\n  Or bids the brazen throat of war to roar;\n  By fits one flash succeeds as one expires,\n  And heaven flames thick with momentary fires:\n  So bursting frequent from Atrides' breast,\n  Sighs following sighs his inward fears confess'd.\n  Now o'er the fields, dejected, he surveys\n  From thousand Trojan fires the mounting blaze;\n  Hears in the passing wind their music blow,\n  And marks distinct the voices of the foe.\n  Now looking backwards to the fleet and coast,\n  Anxious he sorrows for the endangered host.\n  He rends his hair, in sacrifice to Jove,\n  And sues to him that ever lives above:\n  Inly he groans; while glory and despair\n  Divide his heart, and wage a double war.\n\n  A thousand cares his labouring breast revolves;\n  To seek sage Nestor now the chief resolves,\n  With him, in wholesome counsels, to debate\n  What yet remains to save the afflicted state.\n  He rose, and first he cast his mantle round,\n  Next on his feet the shining sandals bound;\n  A lion's yellow spoils his back conceal'd;\n  His warlike hand a pointed javelin held.\n  Meanwhile his brother, press'd with equal woes,\n  Alike denied the gifts of soft repose,\n  Laments for Greece, that in his cause before\n  So much had suffer'd and must suffer more.\n  A leopard's spotted hide his shoulders spread:\n  A brazen helmet glitter'd on his head:\n  Thus (with a javelin in his hand) he went\n  To wake Atrides in the royal tent.\n  Already waked, Atrides he descried,\n  His armour buckling at his vessel's side.\n  Joyful they met; the Spartan thus begun:\n  \"Why puts my brother his bright armour on?\n  Sends he some spy, amidst these silent hours,\n  To try yon camp, and watch the Trojan powers?\n  But say, what hero shall sustain that task?\n  Such bold exploits uncommon courage ask;\n  Guideless, alone, through night's dark shade to go,\n  And midst a hostile camp explore the foe.\"\n\n  To whom the king: \"In such distress we stand,\n  No vulgar counsel our affairs demand;\n  Greece to preserve, is now no easy part,\n  But asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.\n  For Jove, averse, our humble prayer denies,\n  And bows his head to Hector's sacrifice.\n  What eye has witness'd, or what ear believed,\n  In one great day, by one great arm achieved,\n  Such wondrous deeds as Hector's hand has done,\n  And we beheld, the last revolving sun\n  What honours the beloved of Jove adorn!\n  Sprung from no god, and of no goddess born;\n  Yet such his acts, as Greeks unborn shall tell,\n  And curse the battle where their fathers fell.\n\n  \"Now speed thy hasty course along the fleet,\n  There call great Ajax, and the prince of Crete;\n  Ourself to hoary Nestor will repair;\n  To keep the guards on duty be his care,\n  (For Nestor's influence best that quarter guides,\n  Whose son with Merion, o'er the watch presides.\")\n  To whom the Spartan: \"These thy orders borne,\n  Say, shall I stay, or with despatch return?\"\n  \"There shall thou stay, (the king of men replied,)\n  Else may we miss to meet, without a guide,\n  The paths so many, and the camp so wide.\n  Still, with your voice the slothful soldiers raise,\n  Urge by their fathers' fame their future praise.\n  Forget we now our state and lofty birth;\n  Not titles here, but works, must prove our worth.\n  To labour is the lot of man below;\n  And when Jove gave us life, he gave us woe.\"\n\n  This said, each parted to his several cares:\n  The king to Nestor's sable ship repairs;\n  The sage protector of the Greeks he found\n  Stretch'd in his bed with all his arms around\n  The various-colour'd scarf, the shield he rears,\n  The shining helmet, and the pointed spears;\n  The dreadful weapons of the warrior's rage,\n  That, old in arms, disdain'd the peace of age.\n  Then, leaning on his hand his watchful head,\n  The hoary monarch raised his eyes and said:\n\n  \"What art thou, speak, that on designs unknown,\n  While others sleep, thus range the camp alone;\n  Seek'st thou some friend or nightly sentinel?\n  Stand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell.\"\n\n  \"O son of Neleus, (thus the king rejoin'd,)\n  Pride of the Greeks, and glory of thy kind!\n  Lo, here the wretched Agamemnon stands,\n  The unhappy general of the Grecian bands,\n  Whom Jove decrees with daily cares to bend,\n  And woes, that only with his life shall end!\n  Scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain,\n  And scarce my heart support its load of pain.\n  No taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known,\n  Confused, and sad, I wander thus alone,\n  With fears distracted, with no fix'd design;\n  And all my people's miseries are mine.\n  If aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest,\n  (Since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,)\n  Impart thy counsel, and assist thy friend;\n  Now let us jointly to the trench descend,\n  At every gate the fainting guard excite,\n  Tired with the toils of day and watch of night;\n  Else may the sudden foe our works invade,\n  So near, and favour'd by the gloomy shade.\"\n\n  To him thus Nestor: \"Trust the powers above,\n  Nor think proud Hector's hopes confirm'd by Jove:\n  How ill agree the views of vain mankind,\n  And the wise counsels of the eternal mind!\n  Audacious Hector, if the gods ordain\n  That great Achilles rise and rage again,\n  What toils attend thee, and what woes remain!\n  Lo, faithful Nestor thy command obeys;\n  The care is next our other chiefs to raise:\n  Ulysses, Diomed, we chiefly need;\n  Meges for strength, Oileus famed for speed.\n  Some other be despatch'd of nimbler feet,\n  To those tall ships, remotest of the fleet,\n  Where lie great Ajax and the king of Crete.(216)\n  To rouse the Spartan I myself decree;\n  Dear as he is to us, and dear to thee,\n  Yet must I tax his sloth, that claims no share\n  With his great brother in his martial care:\n  Him it behoved to every chief to sue,\n  Preventing every part perform'd by you;\n  For strong necessity our toils demands,\n  Claims all our hearts, and urges all our hands.\"\n\n  To whom the king: \"With reverence we allow\n  Thy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now:\n  My generous brother is of gentle kind,\n  He seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind;\n  Through too much deference to our sovereign sway,\n  Content to follow when we lead the way:\n  But now, our ills industrious to prevent,\n  Long ere the rest he rose, and sought my tent.\n  The chiefs you named, already at his call,\n  Prepare to meet us near the navy-wall;\n  Assembling there, between the trench and gates,\n  Near the night-guards, our chosen council waits.\"\n\n  \"Then none (said Nestor) shall his rule withstand,\n  For great examples justify command.\"\n  With that, the venerable warrior rose;\n  The shining greaves his manly legs enclose;\n  His purple mantle golden buckles join'd,\n  Warm with the softest wool, and doubly lined.\n  Then rushing from his tent, he snatch'd in haste\n  His steely lance, that lighten'd as he pass'd.\n  The camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd,\n  Stopp'd at Ulysses' tent, and call'd aloud.\n  Ulysses, sudden as the voice was sent,\n  Awakes, starts up, and issues from his tent.\n  \"What new distress, what sudden cause of fright,\n  Thus leads you wandering in the silent night?\"\n  \"O prudent chief! (the Pylian sage replied)\n  Wise as thou art, be now thy wisdom tried:\n  Whatever means of safety can be sought,\n  Whatever counsels can inspire our thought,\n  Whatever methods, or to fly or fight;\n  All, all depend on this important night!\"\n  He heard, return'd, and took his painted shield;\n  Then join'd the chiefs, and follow'd through the field.\n  Without his tent, bold Diomed they found,\n  All sheathed in arms, his brave companions round:\n  Each sunk in sleep, extended on the field,\n  His head reclining on his bossy shield.\n  A wood of spears stood by, that, fix'd upright,\n  Shot from their flashing points a quivering light.\n  A bull's black hide composed the hero's bed;\n  A splendid carpet roll'd beneath his head.\n  Then, with his foot, old Nestor gently shakes\n  The slumbering chief, and in these words awakes:\n\n  \"Rise, son of Tydeus! to the brave and strong\n  Rest seems inglorious, and the night too long.\n  But sleep'st thou now, when from yon hill the foe\n  Hangs o'er the fleet, and shades our walls below?\"\n\n  At this, soft slumber from his eyelids fled;\n  The warrior saw the hoary chief, and said:\n  \"Wondrous old man! whose soul no respite knows,\n  Though years and honours bid thee seek repose,\n  Let younger Greeks our sleeping warriors wake;\n  Ill fits thy age these toils to undertake.\"\n  \"My friend, (he answered,) generous is thy care;\n  These toils, my subjects and my sons might bear;\n  Their loyal thoughts and pious love conspire\n  To ease a sovereign and relieve a sire:\n  But now the last despair surrounds our host;\n  No hour must pass, no moment must be lost;\n  Each single Greek, in this conclusive strife,\n  Stands on the sharpest edge of death or life:\n  Yet, if my years thy kind regard engage,\n  Employ thy youth as I employ my age;\n  Succeed to these my cares, and rouse the rest;\n  He serves me most, who serves his country best.\"\n\n  This said, the hero o'er his shoulders flung\n  A lion's spoils, that to his ankles hung;\n  Then seized his ponderous lance, and strode along.\n  Meges the bold, with Ajax famed for speed,\n  The warrior roused, and to the entrenchments lead.\n\n  And now the chiefs approach the nightly guard;\n  A wakeful squadron, each in arms prepared:\n  The unwearied watch their listening leaders keep,\n  And, couching close, repel invading sleep.\n  So faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain,\n  With toil protected from the prowling train;\n  When the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold,\n  Springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold:\n  Through breaking woods her rustling course they hear;\n  Loud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear\n  Of hounds and men: they start, they gaze around,\n  Watch every side, and turn to every sound.\n  Thus watch'd the Grecians, cautious of surprise,\n  Each voice, each motion, drew their ears and eyes:\n  Each step of passing feet increased the affright;\n  And hostile Troy was ever full in sight.\n  Nestor with joy the wakeful band survey'd,\n  And thus accosted through the gloomy shade.\n  \"'Tis well, my sons! your nightly cares employ;\n  Else must our host become the scorn of Troy.\n  Watch thus, and Greece shall live.\" The hero said;\n  Then o'er the trench the following chieftains led.\n  His son, and godlike Merion, march'd behind\n  (For these the princes to their council join'd).\n  The trenches pass'd, the assembled kings around\n  In silent state the consistory crown'd.\n  A place there was, yet undefiled with gore,\n  The spot where Hector stopp'd his rage before;\n  When night descending, from his vengeful hand\n  Reprieved the relics of the Grecian band:\n  (The plain beside with mangled corps was spread,\n  And all his progress mark'd by heaps of dead:)\n  There sat the mournful kings: when Neleus' son,\n  The council opening, in these words begun:\n\n  \"Is there (said he) a chief so greatly brave,\n  His life to hazard, and his country save?\n  Lives there a man, who singly dares to go\n  To yonder camp, or seize some straggling foe?\n  Or favour'd by the night approach so near,\n  Their speech, their counsels, and designs to hear?\n  If to besiege our navies they prepare,\n  Or Troy once more must be the seat of war?\n  This could he learn, and to our peers recite,\n  And pass unharm'd the dangers of the night;\n  What fame were his through all succeeding days,\n  While Phoebus shines, or men have tongues to praise!\n  What gifts his grateful country would bestow!\n  What must not Greece to her deliverer owe?\n  A sable ewe each leader should provide,\n  With each a sable lambkin by her side;\n  At every rite his share should be increased,\n  And his the foremost honours of the feast.\"\n\n  Fear held them mute: alone, untaught to fear,\n  Tydides spoke--\"The man you seek is here.\n  Through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way,\n  Some god within commands, and I obey.\n  But let some other chosen warrior join,\n  To raise my hopes, and second my design.\n  By mutual confidence and mutual aid,\n  Great deeds are done, and great discoveries made;\n  The wise new prudence from the wise acquire,\n  And one brave hero fans another's fire.\"\n\n  Contending leaders at the word arose;\n  Each generous breast with emulation glows;\n  So brave a task each Ajax strove to share,\n  Bold Merion strove, and Nestor's valiant heir;\n  The Spartan wish'd the second place to gain,\n  And great Ulysses wish'd, nor wish'd in vain.\n  Then thus the king of men the contest ends:\n  \"Thou first of warriors, and thou best of friends,\n  Undaunted Diomed! what chief to join\n  In this great enterprise, is only thine.\n  Just be thy choice, without affection made;\n  To birth, or office, no respect be paid;\n  Let worth determine here.\" The monarch spake,\n  And inly trembled for his brother's sake.\n\n  \"Then thus (the godlike Diomed rejoin'd)\n  My choice declares the impulse of my mind.\n  How can I doubt, while great Ulysses stands\n  To lend his counsels and assist our hands?\n  A chief, whose safety is Minerva's care;\n  So famed, so dreadful, in the works of war:\n  Bless'd in his conduct, I no aid require;\n  Wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire.\"\n\n  \"It fits thee not, before these chiefs of fame,\n  (Replied the sage,) to praise me, or to blame:\n  Praise from a friend, or censure from a foe,\n  Are lost on hearers that our merits know.\n  But let us haste--Night rolls the hours away,\n  The reddening orient shows the coming day,\n  The stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains,\n  And of night's empire but a third remains.\"\n\n  Thus having spoke, with generous ardour press'd,\n  In arms terrific their huge limbs they dress'd.\n  A two-edged falchion Thrasymed the brave,\n  And ample buckler, to Tydides gave:\n  Then in a leathern helm he cased his head,\n  Short of its crest, and with no plume o'erspread:\n  (Such as by youths unused to arms are worn:)\n  No spoils enrich it, and no studs adorn.\n  Next him Ulysses took a shining sword,\n  A bow and quiver, with bright arrows stored:\n  A well-proved casque, with leather braces bound,\n  (Thy gift, Meriones,) his temples crown'd;\n  Soft wool within; without, in order spread,(217)\n  A boar's white teeth grinn'd horrid o'er his head.\n  This from Amyntor, rich Ormenus' son,\n  Autolycus by fraudful rapine won,\n  And gave Amphidamas; from him the prize\n  Molus received, the pledge of social ties;\n  The helmet next by Merion was possess'd,\n  And now Ulysses' thoughtful temples press'd.\n  Thus sheathed in arms, the council they forsake,\n  And dark through paths oblique their progress take.\n  Just then, in sign she favour'd their intent,\n  A long-wing'd heron great Minerva sent:\n  This, though surrounding shades obscured their view.\n  By the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew.\n  As from the right she soar'd, Ulysses pray'd,\n  Hail'd the glad omen, and address'd the maid:\n\n  \"O daughter of that god whose arm can wield\n  The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield!\n  O thou! for ever present in my way,\n  Who all my motions, all my toils survey!\n  Safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade,\n  Safe by thy succour to our ships convey'd,\n  And let some deed this signal night adorn,\n  To claim the tears of Trojans yet unborn.\"\n\n  Then godlike Diomed preferr'd his prayer:\n  \"Daughter of Jove, unconquer'd Pallas! hear.\n  Great queen of arms, whose favour Tydeus won,\n  As thou defend'st the sire, defend the son.\n  When on AEsopus' banks the banded powers\n  Of Greece he left, and sought the Theban towers,\n  Peace was his charge; received with peaceful show,\n  He went a legate, but return'd a foe:\n  Then help'd by thee, and cover'd by thy shield,\n  He fought with numbers, and made numbers yield.\n  So now be present, O celestial maid!\n  So still continue to the race thine aid!\n  A youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke,\n  Untamed, unconscious of the galling yoke,\n  With ample forehead, and with spreading horns,\n  Whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns.\"\n  The heroes pray'd, and Pallas from the skies\n  Accords their vow, succeeds their enterprise.\n  Now, like two lions panting for the prey,\n  With dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way,\n  Through the black horrors of the ensanguined plain,\n  Through dust, through blood, o'er arms, and hills of slain.\n\n  Nor less bold Hector, and the sons of Troy,\n  On high designs the wakeful hours employ;\n  The assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed;\n  Who thus the counsels of his breast proposed:\n\n  \"What glorious man, for high attempts prepared,\n  Dares greatly venture for a rich reward?\n  Of yonder fleet a bold discovery make,\n  What watch they keep, and what resolves they take?\n  If now subdued they meditate their flight,\n  And, spent with toil, neglect the watch of night?\n  His be the chariot that shall please him most,\n  Of all the plunder of the vanquish'd host;\n  His the fair steeds that all the rest excel,\n  And his the glory to have served so well.\"\n\n  A youth there was among the tribes of Troy,\n  Dolon his name, Eumedes' only boy,\n  (Five girls beside the reverend herald told.)\n  Rich was the son in brass, and rich in gold;\n  Not bless'd by nature with the charms of face,\n  But swift of foot, and matchless in the race.\n  \"Hector! (he said) my courage bids me meet\n  This high achievement, and explore the fleet:\n  But first exalt thy sceptre to the skies,\n  And swear to grant me the demanded prize;\n  The immortal coursers, and the glittering car,\n  That bear Pelides through the ranks of war.\n  Encouraged thus, no idle scout I go,\n  Fulfil thy wish, their whole intention know,\n  Even to the royal tent pursue my way,\n  And all their counsels, all their aims betray.\"\n\n  The chief then heaved the golden sceptre high,\n  Attesting thus the monarch of the sky:\n  \"Be witness thou! immortal lord of all!\n  Whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall:\n  By none but Dolon shall this prize be borne,\n  And him alone the immortal steeds adorn.\"\n\n  Thus Hector swore: the gods were call'd in vain,\n  But the rash youth prepares to scour the plain:\n  Across his back the bended bow he flung,\n  A wolf's grey hide around his shoulders hung,\n  A ferret's downy fur his helmet lined,\n  And in his hand a pointed javelin shined.\n  Then (never to return) he sought the shore,\n  And trod the path his feet must tread no more.\n  Scarce had he pass'd the steeds and Trojan throng,\n  (Still bending forward as he coursed along,)\n  When, on the hollow way, the approaching tread\n  Ulysses mark'd, and thus to Diomed;\n\n  \"O friend! I hear some step of hostile feet,\n  Moving this way, or hastening to the fleet;\n  Some spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main;\n  Or nightly pillager that strips the slain.\n  Yet let him pass, and win a little space;\n  Then rush behind him, and prevent his pace.\n  But if too swift of foot he flies before,\n  Confine his course along the fleet and shore,\n  Betwixt the camp and him our spears employ,\n  And intercept his hoped return to Troy.\"\n\n  With that they stepp'd aside, and stoop'd their head,\n  (As Dolon pass'd,) behind a heap of dead:\n  Along the path the spy unwary flew;\n  Soft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue.\n  So distant they, and such the space between,\n  As when two teams of mules divide the green,\n  (To whom the hind like shares of land allows,)\n  When now new furrows part the approaching ploughs.\n  Now Dolon, listening, heard them as they pass'd;\n  Hector (he thought) had sent, and check'd his haste,\n  Till scarce at distance of a javelin's throw,\n  No voice succeeding, he perceived the foe.\n  As when two skilful hounds the leveret wind;\n  Or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind;\n  Now lost, now seen, they intercept his way,\n  And from the herd still turn the flying prey:\n  So fast, and with such fears, the Trojan flew;\n  So close, so constant, the bold Greeks pursue.\n  Now almost on the fleet the dastard falls,\n  And mingles with the guards that watch the walls;\n  When brave Tydides stopp'd; a gen'rous thought\n  (Inspired by Pallas) in his bosom wrought,\n  Lest on the foe some forward Greek advance,\n  And snatch the glory from his lifted lance.\n  Then thus aloud: \"Whoe'er thou art, remain;\n  This javelin else shall fix thee to the plain.\"\n  He said, and high in air the weapon cast,\n  Which wilful err'd, and o'er his shoulder pass'd;\n  Then fix'd in earth. Against the trembling wood\n  The wretch stood propp'd, and quiver'd as he stood;\n  A sudden palsy seized his turning head;\n  His loose teeth chatter'd, and his colour fled;\n  The panting warriors seize him as he stands,\n  And with unmanly tears his life demands.\n\n  \"O spare my youth, and for the breath I owe,\n  Large gifts of price my father shall bestow:\n  Vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told,\n  And steel well-temper'd and refulgent gold.\"\n\n  To whom Ulysses made this wise reply:\n  \"Whoe'er thou art, be bold, nor fear to die.\n  What moves thee, say, when sleep has closed the sight,\n  To roam the silent fields in dead of night?\n  Cam'st thou the secrets of our camp to find,\n  By Hector prompted, or thy daring mind?\n  Or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led,\n  Through heaps of carnage, to despoil the dead?\"\n\n  Then thus pale Dolon, with a fearful look:\n  (Still, as he spoke, his limbs with horror shook:)\n  \"Hither I came, by Hector's words deceived;\n  Much did he promise, rashly I believed:\n  No less a bribe than great Achilles' car,\n  And those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war,\n  Urged me, unwilling, this attempt to make;\n  To learn what counsels, what resolves you take:\n  If now subdued, you fix your hopes on flight,\n  And, tired with toils, neglect the watch of night.\"\n\n  \"Bold was thy aim, and glorious was the prize,\n  (Ulysses, with a scornful smile, replies,)\n  Far other rulers those proud steeds demand,\n  And scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand;\n  Even great Achilles scarce their rage can tame,\n  Achilles sprung from an immortal dame.\n  But say, be faithful, and the truth recite!\n  Where lies encamp'd the Trojan chief to-night?\n  Where stand his coursers? in what quarter sleep\n  Their other princes? tell what watch they keep:\n  Say, since this conquest, what their counsels are;\n  Or here to combat, from their city far,\n  Or back to Ilion's walls transfer the war?\"\n\n  Ulysses thus, and thus Eumedes' son:\n  \"What Dolon knows, his faithful tongue shall own.\n  Hector, the peers assembling in his tent,\n  A council holds at Ilus' monument.\n  No certain guards the nightly watch partake;\n  Where'er yon fires ascend, the Trojans wake:\n  Anxious for Troy, the guard the natives keep;\n  Safe in their cares, the auxiliar forces sleep,\n  Whose wives and infants, from the danger far,\n  Discharge their souls of half the fears of war.\"\n\n  \"Then sleep those aids among the Trojan train,\n  (Inquired the chief,) or scattered o'er the plain?\"\n  To whom the spy: \"Their powers they thus dispose\n  The Paeons, dreadful with their bended bows,\n  The Carians, Caucons, the Pelasgian host,\n  And Leleges, encamp along the coast.\n  Not distant far, lie higher on the land\n  The Lycian, Mysian, and Maeonian band,\n  And Phrygia's horse, by Thymbras' ancient wall;\n  The Thracians utmost, and apart from all.\n  These Troy but lately to her succour won,\n  Led on by Rhesus, great Eioneus' son:\n  I saw his coursers in proud triumph go,\n  Swift as the wind, and white as winter-snow;\n  Rich silver plates his shining car infold;\n  His solid arms, refulgent, flame with gold;\n  No mortal shoulders suit the glorious load,\n  Celestial panoply, to grace a god!\n  Let me, unhappy, to your fleet be borne,\n  Or leave me here, a captive's fate to mourn,\n  In cruel chains, till your return reveal\n  The truth or falsehood of the news I tell.\"\n\n  To this Tydides, with a gloomy frown:\n  \"Think not to live, though all the truth be shown:\n  Shall we dismiss thee, in some future strife\n  To risk more bravely thy now forfeit life?\n  Or that again our camps thou may'st explore?\n  No--once a traitor, thou betray'st no more.\"\n\n  Sternly he spoke, and as the wretch prepared\n  With humble blandishment to stroke his beard,\n  Like lightning swift the wrathful falchion flew,\n  Divides the neck, and cuts the nerves in two;\n  One instant snatch'd his trembling soul to hell,\n  The head, yet speaking, mutter'd as it fell.\n  The furry helmet from his brow they tear,\n  The wolf's grey hide, the unbended bow and spear;\n  These great Ulysses lifting to the skies,\n  To favouring Pallas dedicates the prize:\n\n  \"Great queen of arms, receive this hostile spoil,\n  And let the Thracian steeds reward our toil;\n  Thee, first of all the heavenly host, we praise;\n  O speed our labours, and direct our ways!\"\n  This said, the spoils, with dropping gore defaced,\n  High on a spreading tamarisk he placed;\n  Then heap'd with reeds and gathered boughs the plain,\n  To guide their footsteps to the place again.\n\n  Through the still night they cross the devious fields,\n  Slippery with blood, o'er arms and heaps of shields,\n  Arriving where the Thracian squadrons lay,\n  And eased in sleep the labours of the day.\n  Ranged in three lines they view the prostrate band:\n  The horses yoked beside each warrior stand.\n  Their arms in order on the ground reclined,\n  Through the brown shade the fulgid weapons shined:\n  Amidst lay Rhesus, stretch'd in sleep profound,\n  And the white steeds behind his chariot bound.\n  The welcome sight Ulysses first descries,\n  And points to Diomed the tempting prize.\n  \"The man, the coursers, and the car behold!\n  Described by Dolon, with the arms of gold.\n  Now, brave Tydides! now thy courage try,\n  Approach the chariot, and the steeds untie;\n  Or if thy soul aspire to fiercer deeds,\n  Urge thou the slaughter, while I seize the steeds.\"\n\n  Pallas (this said) her hero's bosom warms,\n  Breathed in his heart, and strung his nervous arms;\n  Where'er he pass'd, a purple stream pursued\n  His thirsty falchion, fat with hostile blood,\n  Bathed all his footsteps, dyed the fields with gore,\n  And a low groan remurmur'd through the shore.\n  So the grim lion, from his nightly den,\n  O'erleaps the fences, and invades the pen,\n  On sheep or goats, resistless in his way,\n  He falls, and foaming rends the guardless prey;\n  Nor stopp'd the fury of his vengeful hand,\n  Till twelve lay breathless of the Thracian band.\n  Ulysses following, as his partner slew,\n  Back by the foot each slaughter'd warrior drew;\n  The milk-white coursers studious to convey\n  Safe to the ships, he wisely cleared the way:\n  Lest the fierce steeds, not yet to battles bred,\n  Should start, and tremble at the heaps of dead.\n  Now twelve despatch'd, the monarch last they found;\n  Tydides' falchion fix'd him to the ground.\n  Just then a deathful dream Minerva sent,\n  A warlike form appear'd before his tent,\n  Whose visionary steel his bosom tore:\n  So dream'd the monarch, and awaked no more.(218)\n\n  Ulysses now the snowy steeds detains,\n  And leads them, fasten'd by the silver reins;\n  These, with his bow unbent, he lash'd along;\n  (The scourge forgot, on Rhesus' chariot hung;)\n  Then gave his friend the signal to retire;\n  But him, new dangers, new achievements fire;\n  Doubtful he stood, or with his reeking blade\n  To send more heroes to the infernal shade,\n  Drag off the car where Rhesus' armour lay,\n  Or heave with manly force, and lift away.\n  While unresolved the son of Tydeus stands,\n  Pallas appears, and thus her chief commands:\n\n  \"Enough, my son; from further slaughter cease,\n  Regard thy safety, and depart in peace;\n  Haste to the ships, the gotten spoils enjoy,\n  Nor tempt too far the hostile gods of Troy.\"\n\n  The voice divine confess'd the martial maid;\n  In haste he mounted, and her word obey'd;\n  The coursers fly before Ulysses' bow,\n  Swift as the wind, and white as winter-snow.\n\n  Not unobserved they pass'd: the god of light\n  Had watch'd his Troy, and mark'd Minerva's flight,\n  Saw Tydeus' son with heavenly succour bless'd,\n  And vengeful anger fill'd his sacred breast.\n  Swift to the Trojan camp descends the power,\n  And wakes Hippocoon in the morning-hour;\n  (On Rhesus' side accustom'd to attend,\n  A faithful kinsman, and instructive friend;)\n  He rose, and saw the field deform'd with blood,\n  An empty space where late the coursers stood,\n  The yet-warm Thracians panting on the coast;\n  For each he wept, but for his Rhesus most:\n  Now while on Rhesus' name he calls in vain,\n  The gathering tumult spreads o'er all the plain;\n  On heaps the Trojans rush, with wild affright,\n  And wondering view the slaughters of the night.\n\n  Meanwhile the chiefs, arriving at the shade\n  Where late the spoils of Hector's spy were laid,\n  Ulysses stopp'd; to him Tydides bore\n  The trophy, dropping yet with Dolon's gore:\n  Then mounts again; again their nimbler feet\n  The coursers ply, and thunder towards the fleet.\n\n [Illustration: DIOMED AND ULYSSES RETURNING WITH THE SPOILS OF RHESUS.]\n\n         DIOMED AND ULYSSES RETURNING WITH THE SPOILS OF RHESUS.\n\n\n  Old Nestor first perceived the approaching sound,\n  Bespeaking thus the Grecian peers around:\n  \"Methinks the noise of trampling steeds I hear,\n  Thickening this way, and gathering on my ear;\n  Perhaps some horses of the Trojan breed\n  (So may, ye gods! my pious hopes succeed)\n  The great Tydides and Ulysses bear,\n  Return'd triumphant with this prize of war.\n  Yet much I fear (ah, may that fear be vain!)\n  The chiefs outnumber'd by the Trojan train;\n  Perhaps, even now pursued, they seek the shore;\n  Or, oh! perhaps those heroes are no more.\"\n\n  Scarce had he spoke, when, lo! the chiefs appear,\n  And spring to earth; the Greeks dismiss their fear:\n  With words of friendship and extended hands\n  They greet the kings; and Nestor first demands:\n\n  \"Say thou, whose praises all our host proclaim,\n  Thou living glory of the Grecian name!\n  Say whence these coursers? by what chance bestow'd,\n  The spoil of foes, or present of a god?\n  Not those fair steeds, so radiant and so gay,\n  That draw the burning chariot of the day.\n  Old as I am, to age I scorn to yield,\n  And daily mingle in the martial field;\n  But sure till now no coursers struck my sight\n  Like these, conspicuous through the ranks of fight.\n  Some god, I deem, conferred the glorious prize,\n  Bless'd as ye are, and favourites of the skies;\n  The care of him who bids the thunder roar,\n  And her, whose fury bathes the world with gore.\"\n\n  \"Father! not so, (sage Ithacus rejoin'd,)\n  The gifts of heaven are of a nobler kind.\n  Of Thracian lineage are the steeds ye view,\n  Whose hostile king the brave Tydides slew;\n  Sleeping he died, with all his guards around,\n  And twelve beside lay gasping on the ground.\n  These other spoils from conquer'd Dolon came,\n  A wretch, whose swiftness was his only fame;\n  By Hector sent our forces to explore,\n  He now lies headless on the sandy shore.\"\n\n  Then o'er the trench the bounding coursers flew;\n  The joyful Greeks with loud acclaim pursue.\n  Straight to Tydides' high pavilion borne,\n  The matchless steeds his ample stalls adorn:\n  The neighing coursers their new fellows greet,\n  And the full racks are heap'd with generous wheat.\n  But Dolon's armour, to his ships convey'd,\n  High on the painted stern Ulysses laid,\n  A trophy destin'd to the blue-eyed maid.\n\n  Now from nocturnal sweat and sanguine stain\n  They cleanse their bodies in the neighb'ring main:\n  Then in the polished bath, refresh'd from toil,\n  Their joints they supple with dissolving oil,\n  In due repast indulge the genial hour,\n  And first to Pallas the libations pour:\n  They sit, rejoicing in her aid divine,\n  And the crown'd goblet foams with floods of wine.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XI.\n\n\nARGUMENT\n\nTHE THIRD BATTLE, AND THE ACTS OF AGAMEMNON.\n\nAgamemnon, having armed himself, leads the Grecians to battle; Hector\nprepares the Trojans to receive them, while Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva\ngive the signals of war. Agamemnon bears all before him and Hector is\ncommanded by Jupiter (who sends Iris for that purpose) to decline the\nengagement, till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field. He\nthen makes a great slaughter of the enemy. Ulysses and Diomed put a stop\nto him for a time but the latter, being wounded by Paris, is obliged to\ndesert his companion, who is encompassed by the Trojans, wounded, and in\nthe utmost danger, till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him. Hector comes against\nAjax, but that hero alone opposes multitudes, and rallies the Greeks. In\nthe meantime Machaon, in the other wing of the army, is pierced with an\narrow by Paris, and carried from the fight in Nestor's chariot. Achilles\n(who overlooked the action from his ship) sent Patroclus to inquire which\nof the Greeks was wounded in that manner; Nestor entertains him in his\ntent with an account of the accidents of the day, and a long recital of\nsome former wars which he remembered, tending to put Patroclus upon\npersuading Achilles to fight for his countrymen, or at least to permit him\nto do it, clad in Achilles' armour. Patroclus, on his return, meets\nEurypylus also wounded, and assists him in that distress.\n\nThis book opens with the eight and-twentieth day of the poem, and the same\nday, with its various actions and adventures is extended through the\ntwelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and\npart of the eighteenth books. The scene lies in the field near the\nmonument of Ilus.\n\n  The saffron morn, with early blushes spread,(219)\n  Now rose refulgent from Tithonus' bed;\n  With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,\n  And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light:\n  When baleful Eris, sent by Jove's command,\n  The torch of discord blazing in her hand,\n  Through the red skies her bloody sign extends,\n  And, wrapt in tempests, o'er the fleet descends.\n  High on Ulysses' bark her horrid stand\n  She took, and thunder'd through the seas and land.\n\n  Even Ajax and Achilles heard the sound,\n  Whose ships, remote, the guarded navy bound,\n  Thence the black fury through the Grecian throng\n  With horror sounds the loud Orthian song:\n  The navy shakes, and at the dire alarms\n  Each bosom boils, each warrior starts to arms.\n  No more they sigh, inglorious to return,\n  But breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.\n\n                 [Illustration: THE DESCENT OF DISCORD.]\n\n                         THE DESCENT OF DISCORD.\n\n\n  The king of men his hardy host inspires\n  With loud command, with great example fires!\n  Himself first rose, himself before the rest\n  His mighty limbs in radiant armour dress'd,\n  And first he cased his manly legs around\n  In shining greaves with silver buckles bound;\n  The beaming cuirass next adorn'd his breast,\n  The same which once king Cinyras possess'd:\n  (The fame of Greece and her assembled host\n  Had reach'd that monarch on the Cyprian coast;\n  'Twas then, the friendship of the chief to gain,\n  This glorious gift he sent, nor sent in vain:)\n  Ten rows of azure steel the work infold,\n  Twice ten of tin, and twelve of ductile gold;\n  Three glittering dragons to the gorget rise,\n  Whose imitated scales against the skies\n  Reflected various light, and arching bow'd,\n  Like colour'd rainbows o'er a showery cloud\n  (Jove's wondrous bow, of three celestial dies,\n  Placed as a sign to man amidst the skies).\n  A radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied,\n  Sustain'd the sword that glitter'd at his side:\n  Gold was the hilt, a silver sheath encased\n  The shining blade, and golden hangers graced.\n  His buckler's mighty orb was next display'd,\n  That round the warrior cast a dreadful shade;\n  Ten zones of brass its ample brim surround,\n  And twice ten bosses the bright convex crown'd:\n  Tremendous Gorgon frown'd upon its field,\n  And circling terrors fill'd the expressive shield:\n  Within its concave hung a silver thong,\n  On which a mimic serpent creeps along,\n  His azure length in easy waves extends,\n  Till in three heads the embroider'd monster ends.\n  Last o'er his brows his fourfold helm he placed,\n  With nodding horse-hair formidably graced;\n  And in his hands two steely javelins wields,\n  That blaze to heaven, and lighten all the fields.\n\n  That instant Juno, and the martial maid,\n  In happy thunders promised Greece their aid;\n  High o'er the chief they clash'd their arms in air,\n  And, leaning from the clouds, expect the war.\n\n  Close to the limits of the trench and mound,\n  The fiery coursers to their chariots bound\n  The squires restrain'd: the foot, with those who wield\n  The lighter arms, rush forward to the field.\n  To second these, in close array combined,\n  The squadrons spread their sable wings behind.\n  Now shouts and tumults wake the tardy sun,\n  As with the light the warriors' toils begun.\n  Even Jove, whose thunder spoke his wrath, distill'd\n  Red drops of blood o'er all the fatal field;(220)\n  The woes of men unwilling to survey,\n  And all the slaughters that must stain the day.\n\n  Near Ilus' tomb, in order ranged around,\n  The Trojan lines possess'd the rising ground:\n  There wise Polydamas and Hector stood;\n  AEneas, honour'd as a guardian god;\n  Bold Polybus, Agenor the divine;\n  The brother-warriors of Antenor's line:\n  With youthful Acamas, whose beauteous face\n  And fair proportion match'd the ethereal race.\n  Great Hector, cover'd with his spacious shield,\n  Plies all the troops, and orders all the field.\n  As the red star now shows his sanguine fires\n  Through the dark clouds, and now in night retires,\n  Thus through the ranks appear'd the godlike man,\n  Plunged in the rear, or blazing in the van;\n  While streamy sparkles, restless as he flies,\n  Flash from his arms, as lightning from the skies.\n  As sweating reapers in some wealthy field,\n  Ranged in two bands, their crooked weapons wield,\n  Bear down the furrows, till their labours meet;\n  Thick fall the heapy harvests at their feet:\n  So Greece and Troy the field of war divide,\n  And falling ranks are strow'd on every side.\n  None stoop'd a thought to base inglorious flight;(221)\n  But horse to horse, and man to man they fight,\n  Not rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey;\n  Each wounds, each bleeds, but none resign the day.\n  Discord with joy the scene of death descries,\n  And drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes:\n  Discord alone, of all the immortal train,\n  Swells the red horrors of this direful plain:\n  The gods in peace their golden mansions fill,\n  Ranged in bright order on the Olympian hill:\n  But general murmurs told their griefs above,\n  And each accused the partial will of Jove.\n  Meanwhile apart, superior, and alone,\n  The eternal Monarch, on his awful throne,\n  Wrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate;\n  And fix'd, fulfill'd the just decrees of fate.\n  On earth he turn'd his all-considering eyes,\n  And mark'd the spot where Ilion's towers arise;\n  The sea with ships, the fields with armies spread,\n  The victor's rage, the dying, and the dead.\n\n  Thus while the morning-beams, increasing bright,\n  O'er heaven's pure azure spread the glowing light,\n  Commutual death the fate of war confounds,\n  Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.\n  But now (what time in some sequester'd vale\n  The weary woodman spreads his sparing meal,\n  When his tired arms refuse the axe to rear,\n  And claim a respite from the sylvan war;\n  But not till half the prostrate forests lay\n  Stretch'd in long ruin, and exposed to day)\n  Then, nor till then, the Greeks' impulsive might\n  Pierced the black phalanx, and let in the light.\n  Great Agamemnon then the slaughter led,\n  And slew Bienor at his people's head:\n  Whose squire Oileus, with a sudden spring,\n  Leap'd from the chariot to revenge his king;\n  But in his front he felt the fatal wound,\n  Which pierced his brain, and stretch'd him on the ground.\n  Atrides spoil'd, and left them on the plain:\n  Vain was their youth, their glittering armour vain:\n  Now soil'd with dust, and naked to the sky,\n  Their snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie.\n\n  Two sons of Priam next to battle move,\n  The product, one of marriage, one of love:(222)\n  In the same car the brother-warriors ride;\n  This took the charge to combat, that to guide:\n  Far other task, than when they wont to keep,\n  On Ida's tops, their father's fleecy sheep.\n  These on the mountains once Achilles found,\n  And captive led, with pliant osiers bound;\n  Then to their sire for ample sums restored;\n  But now to perish by Atrides' sword:\n  Pierced in the breast the base-born Isus bleeds:\n  Cleft through the head his brother's fate succeeds,\n  Swift to the spoil the hasty victor falls,\n  And, stript, their features to his mind recalls.\n  The Trojans see the youths untimely die,\n  But helpless tremble for themselves, and fly.\n  So when a lion ranging o'er the lawns.\n  Finds, on some grassy lair, the couching fawns,\n  Their bones he cracks, their reeking vitals draws,\n  And grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws;\n  The frighted hind beholds, and dares not stay,\n  But swift through rustling thickets bursts her way;\n  All drown'd in sweat, the panting mother flies,\n  And the big tears roll trickling from her eyes.\n\n  Amidst the tumult of the routed train,\n  The sons of false Antimachus were slain;\n  He who for bribes his faithless counsels sold,\n  And voted Helen's stay for Paris' gold.\n  Atrides mark'd, as these their safety sought,\n  And slew the children for the father's fault;\n  Their headstrong horse unable to restrain,\n  They shook with fear, and dropp'd the silken rein;\n  Then in the chariot on their knees they fall,\n  And thus with lifted hands for mercy call:\n\n  \"O spare our youth, and for the life we owe,\n  Antimachus shall copious gifts bestow:\n  Soon as he hears, that, not in battle slain,\n  The Grecian ships his captive sons detain,\n  Large heaps of brass in ransom shall be told,\n  And steel well-tempered, and persuasive gold.\"\n\n  These words, attended with the flood of tears,\n  The youths address'd to unrelenting ears:\n  The vengeful monarch gave this stern reply:\n  \"If from Antimachus ye spring, ye die;\n  The daring wretch who once in council stood\n  To shed Ulysses' and my brother's blood,\n  For proffer'd peace! and sues his seed for grace?\n  No, die, and pay the forfeit of your race.\"\n\n  This said, Pisander from the car he cast,\n  And pierced his breast: supine he breathed his last.\n  His brother leap'd to earth; but, as he lay,\n  The trenchant falchion lopp'd his hands away;\n  His sever'd head was toss'd among the throng,\n  And, rolling, drew a bloody train along.\n  Then, where the thickest fought, the victor flew;\n  The king's example all his Greeks pursue.\n  Now by the foot the flying foot were slain,\n  Horse trod by horse, lay foaming on the plain.\n  From the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise,\n  Shade the black host, and intercept the skies.\n  The brass-hoof'd steeds tumultuous plunge and bound,\n  And the thick thunder beats the labouring ground,\n  Still slaughtering on, the king of men proceeds;\n  The distanced army wonders at his deeds,\n  As when the winds with raging flames conspire,\n  And o'er the forests roll the flood of fire,\n  In blazing heaps the grove's old honours fall,\n  And one refulgent ruin levels all:\n  Before Atrides' rage so sinks the foe,\n  Whole squadrons vanish, and proud heads lie low.\n  The steeds fly trembling from his waving sword,\n  And many a car, now lighted of its lord,\n  Wide o'er the field with guideless fury rolls,\n  Breaking their ranks, and crushing out their souls;\n  While his keen falchion drinks the warriors' lives;\n  More grateful, now, to vultures than their wives!\n\n  Perhaps great Hector then had found his fate,\n  But Jove and destiny prolong'd his date.\n  Safe from the darts, the care of heaven he stood,\n  Amidst alarms, and death, and dust, and blood.\n\n  Now past the tomb where ancient Ilus lay,\n  Through the mid field the routed urge their way:\n  Where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown,\n  The path they take, and speed to reach the town.\n  As swift, Atrides with loud shouts pursued,\n  Hot with his toil, and bathed in hostile blood.\n  Now near the beech-tree, and the Scaean gates,\n  The hero halts, and his associates waits.\n  Meanwhile on every side around the plain,\n  Dispersed, disorder'd, fly the Trojan train.\n  So flies a herd of beeves, that hear dismay'd\n  The lion's roaring through the midnight shade;\n  On heaps they tumble with successless haste;\n  The savage seizes, draws, and rends the last.\n  Not with less fury stern Atrides flew,\n  Still press'd the rout, and still the hindmost slew;\n  Hurl'd from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill'd,\n  And rage, and death, and carnage load the field.\n\n  Now storms the victor at the Trojan wall;\n  Surveys the towers, and meditates their fall.\n  But Jove descending shook the Idaean hills,\n  And down their summits pour'd a hundred rills:\n  The unkindled lightning in his hand he took,\n  And thus the many-coloured maid bespoke:\n\n  \"Iris, with haste thy golden wings display,\n  To godlike Hector this our word convey--\n  While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,\n  Fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,\n  Bid him give way; but issue forth commands,\n  And trust the war to less important hands:\n  But when, or wounded by the spear or dart,\n  That chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,\n  Then Jove shall string his arm, and fire his breast,\n  Then to her ships shall flying Greece be press'd,\n  Till to the main the burning sun descend,\n  And sacred night her awful shade extend.\"\n\n  He spoke, and Iris at his word obey'd;\n  On wings of winds descends the various maid.\n  The chief she found amidst the ranks of war,\n  Close to the bulwarks, on his glittering car.\n  The goddess then: \"O son of Priam, hear!\n  From Jove I come, and his high mandate bear.\n  While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,\n  Fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,\n  Abstain from fight; yet issue forth commands,\n  And trust the war to less important hands:\n  But when, or wounded by the spear or dart,\n  The chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,\n  Then Jove shall string thy arm, and fire thy breast,\n  Then to her ships shall flying Greece be press'd,\n  Till to the main the burning sun descend,\n  And sacred night her awful shade extend.\"\n\n  She said, and vanish'd. Hector, with a bound,\n  Springs from his chariot on the trembling ground,\n  In clanging arms: he grasps in either hand\n  A pointed lance, and speeds from band to band;\n  Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,\n  And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.\n  They stand to arms: the Greeks their onset dare,\n  Condense their powers, and wait the coming war.\n  New force, new spirit, to each breast returns;\n  The fight renew'd with fiercer fury burns:\n  The king leads on: all fix on him their eye,\n  And learn from him to conquer, or to die.\n\n  Ye sacred nine! celestial Muses! tell,\n  Who faced him first, and by his prowess fell?\n  The great Iphidamas, the bold and young,\n  From sage Antenor and Theano sprung;\n  Whom from his youth his grandsire Cisseus bred,\n  And nursed in Thrace where snowy flocks are fed.\n  Scarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest,\n  And early honour warm his generous breast,\n  When the kind sire consign'd his daughter's charms\n  (Theano's sister) to his youthful arms.\n  But call'd by glory to the wars of Troy,\n  He leaves untasted the first fruits of joy;\n  From his loved bride departs with melting eyes,\n  And swift to aid his dearer country flies.\n  With twelve black ships he reach'd Percope's strand,\n  Thence took the long laborious march by land.\n  Now fierce for fame, before the ranks he springs,\n  Towering in arms, and braves the king of kings.\n  Atrides first discharged the missive spear;\n  The Trojan stoop'd, the javelin pass'd in air.\n  Then near the corslet, at the monarch's heart,\n  With all his strength, the youth directs his dart:\n  But the broad belt, with plates of silver bound,\n  The point rebated, and repell'd the wound.\n  Encumber'd with the dart, Atrides stands,\n  Till, grasp'd with force, he wrench'd it from his hands;\n  At once his weighty sword discharged a wound\n  Full on his neck, that fell'd him to the ground.\n  Stretch'd in the dust the unhappy warrior lies,\n  And sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes.\n  Oh worthy better fate! oh early slain!\n  Thy country's friend; and virtuous, though in vain!\n  No more the youth shall join his consort's side,\n  At once a virgin, and at once a bride!\n  No more with presents her embraces meet,\n  Or lay the spoils of conquest at her feet,\n  On whom his passion, lavish of his store,\n  Bestow'd so much, and vainly promised more!\n  Unwept, uncover'd, on the plain he lay,\n  While the proud victor bore his arms away.\n\n  Coon, Antenor's eldest hope, was nigh:\n  Tears, at the sight, came starting from his eye,\n  While pierced with grief the much-loved youth he view'd,\n  And the pale features now deform'd with blood.\n  Then, with his spear, unseen, his time he took,\n  Aim'd at the king, and near his elbow strook.\n  The thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part,\n  And through his arm stood forth the barbed dart.\n  Surprised the monarch feels, yet void of fear\n  On Coon rushes with his lifted spear:\n  His brother's corpse the pious Trojan draws,\n  And calls his country to assert his cause;\n  Defends him breathless on the sanguine field,\n  And o'er the body spreads his ample shield.\n  Atrides, marking an unguarded part,\n  Transfix'd the warrior with his brazen dart;\n  Prone on his brother's bleeding breast he lay,\n  The monarch's falchion lopp'd his head away:\n  The social shades the same dark journey go,\n  And join each other in the realms below.\n\n  The vengeful victor rages round the fields,\n  With every weapon art or fury yields:\n  By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,\n  Whole ranks are broken, and whole troops o'erthrown.\n  This, while yet warm distill'd the purple flood;\n  But when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood,\n  Then grinding tortures his strong bosom rend,\n  Less keen those darts the fierce Ilythiae send:\n  (The powers that cause the teeming matron's throes,\n  Sad mothers of unutterable woes!)\n  Stung with the smart, all-panting with the pain,\n  He mounts the car, and gives his squire the rein;\n  Then with a voice which fury made more strong,\n  And pain augmented, thus exhorts the throng:\n\n  \"O friends! O Greeks! assert your honours won;\n  Proceed, and finish what this arm begun:\n  Lo! angry Jove forbids your chief to stay,\n  And envies half the glories of the day.\"\n\n  He said: the driver whirls his lengthful thong;\n  The horses fly; the chariot smokes along.\n  Clouds from their nostrils the fierce coursers blow,\n  And from their sides the foam descends in snow;\n  Shot through the battle in a moment's space,\n  The wounded monarch at his tent they place.\n\n  No sooner Hector saw the king retired,\n  But thus his Trojans and his aids he fired:\n  \"Hear, all ye Dardan, all ye Lycian race!\n  Famed in close fight, and dreadful face to face:\n  Now call to mind your ancient trophies won,\n  Your great forefathers' virtues, and your own.\n  Behold, the general flies! deserts his powers!\n  Lo, Jove himself declares the conquest ours!\n  Now on yon ranks impel your foaming steeds;\n  And, sure of glory, dare immortal deeds.\"\n\n  With words like these the fiery chief alarms\n  His fainting host, and every bosom warms.\n  As the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear\n  The brindled lion, or the tusky bear:\n  With voice and hand provokes their doubting heart,\n  And springs the foremost with his lifted dart:\n  So godlike Hector prompts his troops to dare;\n  Nor prompts alone, but leads himself the war.\n  On the black body of the foe he pours;\n  As from the cloud's deep bosom, swell'd with showers,\n  A sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps,\n  Drives the wild waves, and tosses all the deeps.\n  Say, Muse! when Jove the Trojan's glory crown'd,\n  Beneath his arm what heroes bit the ground?\n  Assaeus, Dolops, and Autonous died,\n  Opites next was added to their side;\n  Then brave Hipponous, famed in many a fight,\n  Opheltius, Orus, sunk to endless night;\n  AEsymnus, Agelaus; all chiefs of name;\n  The rest were vulgar deaths unknown to fame.\n  As when a western whirlwind, charged with storms,\n  Dispels the gather'd clouds that Notus forms:\n  The gust continued, violent and strong,\n  Rolls sable clouds in heaps on heaps along;\n  Now to the skies the foaming billows rears,\n  Now breaks the surge, and wide the bottom bares:\n  Thus, raging Hector, with resistless hands,\n  O'erturns, confounds, and scatters all their bands.\n  Now the last ruin the whole host appals;\n  Now Greece had trembled in her wooden walls;\n  But wise Ulysses call'd Tydides forth,\n  His soul rekindled, and awaked his worth.\n  \"And stand we deedless, O eternal shame!\n  Till Hector's arm involve the ships in flame?\n  Haste, let us join, and combat side by side.\"\n  The warrior thus, and thus the friend replied:\n\n  \"No martial toil I shun, no danger fear;\n  Let Hector come; I wait his fury here.\n  But Jove with conquest crowns the Trojan train:\n  And, Jove our foe, all human force is vain.\"\n\n  He sigh'd; but, sighing, raised his vengeful steel,\n  And from his car the proud Thymbraeus fell:\n  Molion, the charioteer, pursued his lord,\n  His death ennobled by Ulysses' sword.\n  There slain, they left them in eternal night,\n  Then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight.\n  So two wild boars outstrip the following hounds,\n  Then swift revert, and wounds return for wounds.\n  Stern Hector's conquests in the middle plain\n  Stood check'd awhile, and Greece respired again.\n\n  The sons of Merops shone amidst the war;\n  Towering they rode in one refulgent car:\n  In deep prophetic arts their father skill'd,\n  Had warn'd his children from the Trojan field.\n  Fate urged them on: the father warn'd in vain;\n  They rush'd to fight, and perish'd on the plain;\n  Their breasts no more the vital spirit warms;\n  The stern Tydides strips their shining arms.\n  Hypirochus by great Ulysses dies,\n  And rich Hippodamus becomes his prize.\n  Great Jove from Ide with slaughter fills his sight,\n  And level hangs the doubtful scale of fight.\n  By Tydeus' lance Agastrophus was slain,\n  The far-famed hero of Paeonian strain;\n  Wing'd with his fears, on foot he strove to fly,\n  His steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh:\n  Through broken orders, swifter than the wind,\n  He fled, but flying left his life behind.\n  This Hector sees, as his experienced eyes\n  Traverse the files, and to the rescue flies;\n  Shouts, as he pass'd, the crystal regions rend,\n  And moving armies on his march attend.\n  Great Diomed himself was seized with fear,\n  And thus bespoke his brother of the war:\n\n  \"Mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield!\n  The storm rolls on, and Hector rules the field:\n  Here stand his utmost force.\"--The warrior said;\n  Swift at the word his ponderous javelin fled;\n  Nor miss'd its aim, but where the plumage danced\n  Razed the smooth cone, and thence obliquely glanced.\n  Safe in his helm (the gift of Phoebus' hands)\n  Without a wound the Trojan hero stands;\n  But yet so stunn'd, that, staggering on the plain.\n  His arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain;\n  O'er his dim sight the misty vapours rise,\n  And a short darkness shades his swimming eyes.\n  Tydides followed to regain his lance;\n  While Hector rose, recover'd from the trance,\n  Remounts his car, and herds amidst the crowd:\n  The Greek pursues him, and exults aloud:\n  \"Once more thank Phoebus for thy forfeit breath,\n  Or thank that swiftness which outstrips the death.\n  Well by Apollo are thy prayers repaid,\n  And oft that partial power has lent his aid.\n  Thou shall not long the death deserved withstand,\n  If any god assist Tydides' hand.\n  Fly then, inglorious! but thy flight, this day,\n  Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay,\"\n\n  Him, while he triumph'd, Paris eyed from far,\n  (The spouse of Helen, the fair cause of war;)\n  Around the fields his feather'd shafts he sent,\n  From ancient Ilus' ruin'd monument:\n  Behind the column placed, he bent his bow,\n  And wing'd an arrow at the unwary foe;\n  Just as he stoop'd, Agastrophus's crest\n  To seize, and drew the corslet from his breast,\n  The bowstring twang'd; nor flew the shaft in vain,\n  But pierced his foot, and nail'd it to the plain.\n  The laughing Trojan, with a joyful spring.\n  Leaps from his ambush, and insults the king.\n\n  \"He bleeds! (he cries) some god has sped my dart!\n  Would the same god had fix'd it in his heart!\n  So Troy, relieved from that wide-wasting hand,\n  Should breathe from slaughter and in combat stand:\n  Whose sons now tremble at his darted spear,\n  As scatter'd lambs the rushing lion fear.\"\n\n  He dauntless thus: \"Thou conqueror of the fair,\n  Thou woman-warrior with the curling hair;\n  Vain archer! trusting to the distant dart,\n  Unskill'd in arms to act a manly part!\n  Thou hast but done what boys or women can;\n  Such hands may wound, but not incense a man.\n  Nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave,\n  A coward's weapon never hurts the brave.\n  Not so this dart, which thou may'st one day feel;\n  Fate wings its flight, and death is on the steel:\n  Where this but lights, some noble life expires;\n  Its touch makes orphans, bathes the cheeks of sires,\n  Steeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air,\n  And leaves such objects as distract the fair.\"\n  Ulysses hastens with a trembling heart,\n  Before him steps, and bending draws the dart:\n  Forth flows the blood; an eager pang succeeds;\n  Tydides mounts, and to the navy speeds.\n\n  Now on the field Ulysses stands alone,\n  The Greeks all fled, the Trojans pouring on;\n  But stands collected in himself, and whole,\n  And questions thus his own unconquer'd soul:\n\n  \"What further subterfuge, what hopes remain?\n  What shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?\n  What danger, singly if I stand the ground,\n  My friends all scatter'd, all the foes around?\n  Yet wherefore doubtful? let this truth suffice,\n  The brave meets danger, and the coward flies.\n  To die or conquer, proves a hero's heart;\n  And, knowing this, I know a soldier's part.\"\n\n  Such thoughts revolving in his careful breast,\n  Near, and more near, the shady cohorts press'd;\n  These, in the warrior, their own fate enclose;\n  And round him deep the steely circle grows.\n  So fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds\n  Of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds;\n  He grinds his ivory tusks; he foams with ire;\n  His sanguine eye-balls glare with living fire;\n  By these, by those, on every part is plied;\n  And the red slaughter spreads on every side.\n  Pierced through the shoulder, first Deiopis fell;\n  Next Ennomus and Thoon sank to hell;\n  Chersidamas, beneath the navel thrust,\n  Falls prone to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.\n  Charops, the son of Hippasus, was near;\n  Ulysses reach'd him with the fatal spear;\n  But to his aid his brother Socus flies,\n  Socus the brave, the generous, and the wise.\n  Near as he drew, the warrior thus began:\n\n  \"O great Ulysses! much-enduring man!\n  Not deeper skill'd in every martial sleight,\n  Than worn to toils, and active in the fight!\n  This day two brothers shall thy conquest grace,\n  And end at once the great Hippasian race,\n  Or thou beneath this lance must press the field.\"\n  He said, and forceful pierced his spacious shield:\n  Through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown,\n  Plough'd half his side, and bared it to the bone.\n  By Pallas' care, the spear, though deep infix'd,\n  Stopp'd short of life, nor with his entrails mix'd.\n\n  The wound not mortal wise Ulysses knew,\n  Then furious thus (but first some steps withdrew):\n  \"Unhappy man! whose death our hands shall grace,\n  Fate calls thee hence and finish'd is thy race.\n  Nor longer check my conquests on the foe;\n  But, pierced by this, to endless darkness go,\n  And add one spectre to the realms below!\"\n\n  He spoke, while Socus, seized with sudden fright,\n  Trembling gave way, and turn'd his back to flight;\n  Between his shoulders pierced the following dart,\n  And held its passage through the panting heart:\n  Wide in his breast appear'd the grisly wound;\n  He falls; his armour rings against the ground.\n  Then thus Ulysses, gazing on the slain:\n  \"Famed son of Hippasus! there press the plain;\n  There ends thy narrow span assign'd by fate,\n  Heaven owes Ulysses yet a longer date.\n  Ah, wretch! no father shall thy corpse compose;\n  Thy dying eyes no tender mother close;\n  But hungry birds shall tear those balls away,\n  And hovering vultures scream around their prey.\n  Me Greece shall honour, when I meet my doom,\n  With solemn funerals and a lasting tomb.\"\n\n  Then raging with intolerable smart,\n  He writhes his body, and extracts the dart.\n  The dart a tide of spouting gore pursued,\n  And gladden'd Troy with sight of hostile blood.\n  Now troops on troops the fainting chief invade,\n  Forced he recedes, and loudly calls for aid.\n  Thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears;\n  The well-known voice thrice Menelaus hears:\n  Alarm'd, to Ajax Telamon he cried,\n  Who shares his labours, and defends his side:\n  \"O friend! Ulysses' shouts invade my ear;\n  Distressed he seems, and no assistance near;\n  Strong as he is, yet one opposed to all,\n  Oppress'd by multitudes, the best may fall.\n  Greece robb'd of him must bid her host despair,\n  And feel a loss not ages can repair.\"\n\n  Then, where the cry directs, his course he bends;\n  Great Ajax, like the god of war, attends,\n  The prudent chief in sore distress they found,\n  With bands of furious Trojans compass'd round.(223)\n  As when some huntsman, with a flying spear,\n  From the blind thicket wounds a stately deer;\n  Down his cleft side, while fresh the blood distils,\n  He bounds aloft, and scuds from hills to hills,\n  Till life's warm vapour issuing through the wound,\n  Wild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround:\n  Just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade,\n  The lion rushes through the woodland shade,\n  The wolves, though hungry, scour dispersed away;\n  The lordly savage vindicates his prey.\n  Ulysses thus, unconquer'd by his pains,\n  A single warrior half a host sustains:\n  But soon as Ajax leaves his tower-like shield,\n  The scattered crowds fly frighted o'er the field;\n  Atrides' arm the sinking hero stays,\n  And, saved from numbers, to his car conveys.\n\n  Victorious Ajax plies the routed crew;\n  And first Doryclus, Priam's son, he slew,\n  On strong Pandocus next inflicts a wound,\n  And lays Lysander bleeding on the ground.\n  As when a torrent, swell'd with wintry rains,\n  Pours from the mountains o'er the deluged plains,\n  And pines and oaks, from their foundations torn,\n  A country's ruins! to the seas are borne:\n  Fierce Ajax thus o'erwhelms the yielding throng;\n  Men, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along.\n\n  But Hector, from this scene of slaughter far,\n  Raged on the left, and ruled the tide of war:\n  Loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain,\n  And deep Scamander swells with heaps of slain.\n  There Nestor and Idomeneus oppose\n  The warrior's fury; there the battle glows;\n  There fierce on foot, or from the chariot's height,\n  His sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight.\n  The spouse of Helen, dealing darts around,\n  Had pierced Machaon with a distant wound:\n  In his right shoulder the broad shaft appear'd,\n  And trembling Greece for her physician fear'd.\n  To Nestor then Idomeneus begun:\n  \"Glory of Greece, old Neleus' valiant son!\n  Ascend thy chariot, haste with speed away,\n  And great Machaon to the ships convey;\n  A wise physician skill'd our wounds to heal,\n  Is more than armies to the public weal.\"\n  Old Nestor mounts the seat; beside him rode\n  The wounded offspring of the healing god.\n  He lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feet\n  Shake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.\n\n  But now Cebriones, from Hector's car,\n  Survey'd the various fortune of the war:\n  \"While here (he cried) the flying Greeks are slain,\n  Trojans on Trojans yonder load the plain.\n  Before great Ajax see the mingled throng\n  Of men and chariots driven in heaps along!\n  I know him well, distinguish'd o'er the field\n  By the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield.\n  Thither, O Hector, thither urge thy steeds,\n  There danger calls, and there the combat bleeds;\n  There horse and foot in mingled deaths unite,\n  And groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight.\"\n\n  Thus having spoke, the driver's lash resounds;\n  Swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds;\n  Stung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields,\n  O'er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields.\n  The horses' hoofs are bathed in heroes' gore,\n  And, dashing, purple all the car before;\n  The groaning axle sable drops distils,\n  And mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.\n  Here Hector, plunging through the thickest fight,\n  Broke the dark phalanx, and let in the light:\n  (By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone.\n  The ranks he scatter'd and the troops o'erthrown:)\n  Ajax he shuns, through all the dire debate,\n  And fears that arm whose force he felt so late.\n  But partial Jove, espousing Hector's part,\n  Shot heaven-bred horror through the Grecian's heart;\n  Confused, unnerved in Hector's presence grown,\n  Amazed he stood, with terrors not his own.\n  O'er his broad back his moony shield he threw,\n  And, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew.\n  Thus the grim lion his retreat maintains,\n  Beset with watchful dogs, and shouting swains;\n  Repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls,\n  Though rage impels him, and though hunger calls,\n  Long stands the showering darts, and missile fires;\n  Then sourly slow the indignant beast retires:\n  So turn'd stern Ajax, by whole hosts repell'd,\n  While his swoln heart at every step rebell'd.\n\n  As the slow beast, with heavy strength endued,\n  In some wide field by troops of boys pursued,\n  Though round his sides a wooden tempest rain,\n  Crops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain;\n  Thick on his hide the hollow blows resound,\n  The patient animal maintains his ground,\n  Scarce from the field with all their efforts chased,\n  And stirs but slowly when he stirs at last:\n  On Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung,\n  The strokes redoubled on his buckler rung;\n  Confiding now in bulky strength he stands,\n  Now turns, and backward bears the yielding bands;\n  Now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,\n  And threats his followers with retorted eye.\n  Fix'd as the bar between two warring powers,\n  While hissing darts descend in iron showers:\n  In his broad buckler many a weapon stood,\n  Its surface bristled with a quivering wood;\n  And many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,\n  Marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.\n  But bold Eurypylus his aid imparts,\n  And dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts;\n  Whose eager javelin launch'd against the foe,\n  Great Apisaon felt the fatal blow;\n  From his torn liver the red current flow'd,\n  And his slack knees desert their dying load.\n  The victor rushing to despoil the dead,\n  From Paris' bow a vengeful arrow fled;\n  Fix'd in his nervous thigh the weapon stood,\n  Fix'd was the point, but broken was the wood.\n  Back to the lines the wounded Greek retired,\n  Yet thus retreating, his associates fired:\n\n  \"What god, O Grecians! has your hearts dismay'd?\n  Oh, turn to arms; 'tis Ajax claims your aid.\n  This hour he stands the mark of hostile rage,\n  And this the last brave battle he shall wage:\n  Haste, join your forces; from the gloomy grave\n  The warrior rescue, and your country save.\"\n  Thus urged the chief: a generous troop appears,\n  Who spread their bucklers, and advance their spears,\n  To guard their wounded friend: while thus they stand\n  With pious care, great Ajax joins the band:\n  Each takes new courage at the hero's sight;\n  The hero rallies, and renews the fight.\n\n  Thus raged both armies like conflicting fires,\n  While Nestor's chariot far from fight retires:\n  His coursers steep'd in sweat, and stain'd with gore,\n  The Greeks' preserver, great Machaon, bore.\n  That hour Achilles, from the topmost height\n  Of his proud fleet, o'erlook'd the fields of fight;\n  His feasted eyes beheld around the plain\n  The Grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain.\n  His friend Machaon singled from the rest,\n  A transient pity touch'd his vengeful breast.\n  Straight to Menoetius' much-loved son he sent:\n  Graceful as Mars, Patroclus quits his tent;\n  In evil hour! Then fate decreed his doom,\n  And fix'd the date of all his woes to come.\n\n  \"Why calls my friend? thy loved injunctions lay;\n  Whate'er thy will, Patroclus shall obey.\"\n\n  \"O first of friends! (Pelides thus replied)\n  Still at my heart, and ever at my side!\n  The time is come, when yon despairing host\n  Shall learn the value of the man they lost:\n  Now at my knees the Greeks shall pour their moan,\n  And proud Atrides tremble on his throne.\n  Go now to Nestor, and from him be taught\n  What wounded warrior late his chariot brought:\n  For, seen at distance, and but seen behind,\n  His form recall'd Machaon to my mind;\n  Nor could I, through yon cloud, discern his face,\n  The coursers pass'd me with so swift a pace.\"\n\n  The hero said. His friend obey'd with haste,\n  Through intermingled ships and tents he pass'd;\n  The chiefs descending from their car he found:\n  The panting steeds Eurymedon unbound.\n  The warriors standing on the breezy shore,\n  To dry their sweat, and wash away the gore,\n  Here paused a moment, while the gentle gale\n  Convey'd that freshness the cool seas exhale;\n  Then to consult on farther methods went,\n  And took their seats beneath the shady tent.\n  The draught prescribed, fair Hecamede prepares,\n  Arsinous' daughter, graced with golden hairs:\n  (Whom to his aged arms, a royal slave,\n  Greece, as the prize of Nestor's wisdom gave:)\n  A table first with azure feet she placed;\n  Whose ample orb a brazen charger graced;\n  Honey new-press'd, the sacred flour of wheat,\n  And wholesome garlic, crown'd the savoury treat,\n  Next her white hand an antique goblet brings,\n  A goblet sacred to the Pylian kings\n  From eldest times: emboss'd with studs of gold,\n  Two feet support it, and four handles hold;\n  On each bright handle, bending o'er the brink,\n  In sculptured gold, two turtles seem to drink:\n  A massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him,\n  When the brisk nectar overlook'd the brim.\n  Temper'd in this, the nymph of form divine\n  Pours a large portion of the Pramnian wine;\n  With goat's-milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows,\n  And last with flour the smiling surface strows:\n  This for the wounded prince the dame prepares:\n  The cordial beverage reverend Nestor shares:\n  Salubrious draughts the warriors' thirst allay,\n  And pleasing conference beguiles the day.\n\n  Meantime Patroclus, by Achilles sent,\n  Unheard approached, and stood before the tent.\n  Old Nestor, rising then, the hero led\n  To his high seat: the chief refused and said:\n\n  \"'Tis now no season for these kind delays;\n  The great Achilles with impatience stays.\n  To great Achilles this respect I owe;\n  Who asks, what hero, wounded by the foe,\n  Was borne from combat by thy foaming steeds?\n  With grief I see the great Machaon bleeds.\n  This to report, my hasty course I bend;\n  Thou know'st the fiery temper of my friend.\"\n  \"Can then the sons of Greece (the sage rejoin'd)\n  Excite compassion in Achilles' mind?\n  Seeks he the sorrows of our host to know?\n  This is not half the story of our woe.\n  Tell him, not great Machaon bleeds alone,\n  Our bravest heroes in the navy groan,\n  Ulysses, Agamemnon, Diomed,\n  And stern Eurypylus, already bleed.\n  But, ah! what flattering hopes I entertain!\n  Achilles heeds not, but derides our pain:\n  Even till the flames consume our fleet he stays,\n  And waits the rising of the fatal blaze.\n  Chief after chief the raging foe destroys;\n  Calm he looks on, and every death enjoys.\n  Now the slow course of all-impairing time\n  Unstrings my nerves, and ends my manly prime;\n  Oh! had I still that strength my youth possess'd,\n  When this bold arm the Epeian powers oppress'd,\n  The bulls of Elis in glad triumph led,\n  And stretch'd the great Itymonaeus dead!\n  Then from my fury fled the trembling swains,\n  And ours was all the plunder of the plains:\n  Fifty white flocks, full fifty herds of swine,\n  As many goats, as many lowing kine:\n  And thrice the number of unrivall'd steeds,\n  All teeming females, and of generous breeds.\n  These, as my first essay of arms, I won;\n  Old Neleus gloried in his conquering son.\n  Thus Elis forced, her long arrears restored,\n  And shares were parted to each Pylian lord.\n  The state of Pyle was sunk to last despair,\n  When the proud Elians first commenced the war:\n  For Neleus' sons Alcides' rage had slain;\n  Of twelve bold brothers, I alone remain!\n  Oppress'd, we arm'd; and now this conquest gain'd,\n  My sire three hundred chosen sheep obtain'd.\n  (That large reprisal he might justly claim,\n  For prize defrauded, and insulted fame,\n  When Elis' monarch, at the public course,\n  Detain'd his chariot, and victorious horse.)\n  The rest the people shared; myself survey'd\n  The just partition, and due victims paid.\n  Three days were past, when Elis rose to war,\n  With many a courser, and with many a car;\n  The sons of Actor at their army's head\n  (Young as they were) the vengeful squadrons led.\n  High on the rock fair Thryoessa stands,\n  Our utmost frontier on the Pylian lands:\n  Not far the streams of famed Alphaeus flow:\n  The stream they pass'd, and pitch'd their tents below.\n  Pallas, descending in the shades of night,\n  Alarms the Pylians and commands the fight.\n  Each burns for fame, and swells with martial pride,\n  Myself the foremost; but my sire denied;\n  Fear'd for my youth, exposed to stern alarms;\n  And stopp'd my chariot, and detain'd my arms.\n  My sire denied in vain: on foot I fled\n  Amidst our chariots; for the goddess led.\n\n  \"Along fair Arene's delightful plain\n  Soft Minyas rolls his waters to the main:\n  There, horse and foot, the Pylian troops unite,\n  And sheathed in arms, expect the dawning light.\n  Thence, ere the sun advanced his noon-day flame,\n  To great Alphaeus' sacred source we came.\n  There first to Jove our solemn rites were paid;\n  An untamed heifer pleased the blue-eyed maid;\n  A bull, Alphaeus; and a bull was slain\n  To the blue monarch of the watery main.\n  In arms we slept, beside the winding flood,\n  While round the town the fierce Epeians stood.\n  Soon as the sun, with all-revealing ray,\n  Flamed in the front of Heaven, and gave the day.\n  Bright scenes of arms, and works of war appear;\n  The nations meet; there Pylos, Elis here.\n  The first who fell, beneath my javelin bled;\n  King Augias' son, and spouse of Agamede:\n  (She that all simples' healing virtues knew,\n  And every herb that drinks the morning dew:)\n  I seized his car, the van of battle led;\n  The Epeians saw, they trembled, and they fled.\n  The foe dispersed, their bravest warrior kill'd,\n  Fierce as the whirlwind now I swept the field:\n  Full fifty captive chariots graced my train;\n  Two chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain.\n  Then Actor's sons had died, but Neptune shrouds\n  The youthful heroes in a veil of clouds.\n  O'er heapy shields, and o'er the prostrate throng,\n  Collecting spoils, and slaughtering all along,\n  Through wide Buprasian fields we forced the foes,\n  Where o'er the vales the Olenian rocks arose;\n  Till Pallas stopp'd us where Alisium flows.\n  Even there the hindmost of the rear I slay,\n  And the same arm that led concludes the day;\n  Then back to Pyle triumphant take my way.\n  There to high Jove were public thanks assign'd,\n  As first of gods; to Nestor, of mankind.\n  Such then I was, impell'd by youthful blood;\n  So proved my valour for my country's good.\n\n  \"Achilles with unactive fury glows,\n  And gives to passion what to Greece he owes.\n  How shall he grieve, when to the eternal shade\n  Her hosts shall sink, nor his the power to aid!\n  0 friend! my memory recalls the day,\n  When, gathering aids along the Grecian sea,\n  I, and Ulysses, touch'd at Phthia's port,\n  And entered Peleus' hospitable court.\n  A bull to Jove he slew in sacrifice,\n  And pour'd libations on the flaming thighs.\n  Thyself, Achilles, and thy reverend sire\n  Menoetius, turn'd the fragments on the fire.\n  Achilles sees us, to the feast invites;\n  Social we sit, and share the genial rites.\n  We then explained the cause on which we came,\n  Urged you to arms, and found you fierce for fame.\n  Your ancient fathers generous precepts gave;\n  Peleus said only this:--'My son! be brave.'\n  Menoetius thus: 'Though great Achilles shine\n  In strength superior, and of race divine,\n  Yet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend;\n  Let thy just counsels aid, and rule thy friend.'\n  Thus spoke your father at Thessalia's court:\n  Words now forgot, though now of vast import.\n  Ah! try the utmost that a friend can say:\n  Such gentle force the fiercest minds obey;\n  Some favouring god Achilles' heart may move;\n  Though deaf to glory, he may yield to love.\n  If some dire oracle his breast alarm,\n  If aught from Heaven withhold his saving arm,\n  Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,\n  If thou but lead the Myrmidonian line;\n  Clad in Achilles' arms, if thou appear,\n  Proud Troy may tremble, and desist from war;\n  Press'd by fresh forces, her o'er-labour'd train\n  Shall seek their walls, and Greece respire again.\"\n\n  This touch'd his generous heart, and from the tent\n  Along the shore with hasty strides he went;\n  Soon as he came, where, on the crowded strand,\n  The public mart and courts of justice stand,\n  Where the tall fleet of great Ulysses lies,\n  And altars to the guardian gods arise;\n  There, sad, he met the brave Euaemon's son,\n  Large painful drops from all his members run;\n  An arrow's head yet rooted in his wound,\n  The sable blood in circles mark'd the ground.\n  As faintly reeling he confess'd the smart,\n  Weak was his pace, but dauntless was his heart.\n  Divine compassion touch'd Patroclus' breast,\n  Who, sighing, thus his bleeding friend address'd:\n\n  \"Ah, hapless leaders of the Grecian host!\n  Thus must ye perish on a barbarous coast?\n  Is this your fate, to glut the dogs with gore,\n  Far from your friends, and from your native shore?\n  Say, great Eurypylus!

The Trojans follow\nhis counsel; and having divided their army into five bodies of foot, begin\nthe assault. But upon the signal of an eagle with a serpent in his talons,\nwhich appeared on the left hand of the Trojans, Polydamas endeavours to\nwithdraw them again. This Hector opposes, and continues the attack; in\nwhich, after many actions, Sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall.\nHector also, casting a stone of vast size, forces open one of the gates,\nand enters at the head of his troops, who victoriously pursue the Grecians\neven to their ships.\n\n  While thus the hero's pious cares attend\n  The cure and safety of his wounded friend,\n  Trojans and Greeks with clashing shields engage,\n  And mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage.\n  Nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose;\n  With gods averse the ill-fated works arose;\n  Their powers neglected, and no victim slain,\n  The walls were raised, the trenches sunk in vain.\n\n  Without the gods, how short a period stands\n  The proudest monument of mortal hands!\n  This stood while Hector and Achilles raged.\n  While sacred Troy the warring hosts engaged;\n  But when her sons were slain, her city burn'd,\n  And what survived of Greece to Greece return'd;\n  Then Neptune and Apollo shook the shore,\n  Then Ida's summits pour'd their watery store;\n  Rhesus and Rhodius then unite their rills,\n  Caresus roaring down the stony hills,\n  AEsepus, Granicus, with mingled force,\n  And Xanthus foaming from his fruitful source;\n  And gulfy Simois, rolling to the main(224)\n  Helmets, and shields, and godlike heroes slain:\n  These, turn'd by Phoebus from their wonted ways,\n  Deluged the rampire nine continual days;\n  The weight of waters saps the yielding wall,\n  And to the sea the floating bulwarks fall.\n  Incessant cataracts the Thunderer pours,\n  And half the skies descend in sluicy showers.\n  The god of ocean, marching stern before,\n  With his huge trident wounds the trembling shore,\n  Vast stones and piles from their foundation heaves,\n  And whelms the smoky ruin in the waves.\n  Now smooth'd with sand, and levell'd by the flood,\n  No fragment tells where once the wonder stood;\n  In their old bounds the rivers roll again,\n  Shine 'twixt the hills, or wander o'er the plain.(225)\n\n  But this the gods in later times perform;\n  As yet the bulwark stood, and braved the storm;\n  The strokes yet echoed of contending powers;\n  War thunder'd at the gates, and blood distain'd the towers.\n  Smote by the arm of Jove with dire dismay,\n  Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay:\n  Hector's approach in every wind they hear,\n  And Hector's fury every moment fear.\n  He, like a whirlwind, toss'd the scattering throng,\n  Mingled the troops, and drove the field along.\n  So 'midst the dogs and hunters' daring bands,\n  Fierce of his might, a boar or lion stands;\n  Arm'd foes around a dreadful circle form,\n  And hissing javelins rain an iron storm:\n  His powers untamed, their bold assault defy,\n  And where he turns the rout disperse or die:\n  He foams, he glares, he bounds against them all,\n  And if he falls, his courage makes him fall.\n  With equal rage encompass'd Hector glows;\n  Exhorts his armies, and the trenches shows.\n  The panting steeds impatient fury breathe,\n  And snort and tremble at the gulf beneath;\n  Just at the brink they neigh, and paw the ground,\n  And the turf trembles, and the skies resound.\n  Eager they view'd the prospect dark and deep,\n  Vast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep;\n  The bottom bare, (a formidable show!)\n  And bristled thick with sharpen'd stakes below.\n  The foot alone this strong defence could force,\n  And try the pass impervious to the horse.\n  This saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave,\n  Restrain'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:\n\n  \"O thou, bold leader of the Trojan bands!\n  And you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands!\n  What entrance here can cumbrous chariots find,\n  The stakes beneath, the Grecian walls behind?\n  No pass through those, without a thousand wounds,\n  No space for combat in yon narrow bounds.\n  Proud of the favours mighty Jove has shown,\n  On certain dangers we too rashly run:\n  If 'tis will our haughty foes to tame,\n  Oh may this instant end the Grecian name!\n  Here, far from Argos, let their heroes fall,\n  And one great day destroy and bury all!\n  But should they turn, and here oppress our train,\n  What hopes, what methods of retreat remain?\n  Wedged in the trench, by our own troops confused,\n  In one promiscuous carnage crush'd and bruised,\n  All Troy must perish, if their arms prevail,\n  Nor shall a Trojan live to tell the tale.\n  Hear then, ye warriors!

our extended reign,(226)\n  Where Xanthus' streams enrich the Lycian plain,\n  Our numerous herds that range the fruitful field,\n  And hills where vines their purple harvest yield,\n  Our foaming bowls with purer nectar crown'd,\n  Our feasts enhanced with music's sprightly sound?\n  Why on those shores are we with joy survey'd,\n  Admired as heroes, and as gods obey'd,\n  Unless great acts superior merit prove,\n  And vindicate the bounteous powers above?\n  'Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace;\n  The first in valour, as the first in place;\n  That when with wondering eyes our martial bands\n  Behold our deeds transcending our commands,\n  Such, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state,\n  Whom those that envy dare not imitate!\n  Could all our care elude the gloomy grave,\n  Which claims no less the fearful and the brave,\n  For lust of fame I should not vainly dare\n  In fighting fields, nor urge thy soul to war.\n  But since, alas! ignoble age must come,\n  Disease, and death's inexorable doom\n  The life, which others pay, let us bestow,\n  And give to fame what we to nature owe;\n  Brave though we fall, and honour'd if we live,\n  Or let us glory gain, or glory give!\"\n\n  He said; his words the listening chief inspire\n  With equal warmth, and rouse the warrior's fire;\n  The troops pursue their leaders with delight,\n  Rush to the foe, and claim the promised fight.\n  Menestheus from on high the storm beheld\n  Threatening the fort, and blackening in the field:\n  Around the walls he gazed, to view from far\n  What aid appear'd to avert the approaching war,\n  And saw where Teucer with the Ajaces stood,\n  Of fight insatiate, prodigal of blood.\n  In vain he calls; the din of helms and shields\n  Rings to the skies, and echoes through the fields,\n  The brazen hinges fly, the walls resound,\n  Heaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground\n  Then thus to Thoos: \"Hence with speed (he said),\n  And urge the bold Ajaces to our aid;\n  Their strength, united, best may help to bear\n  The bloody labours of the doubtful war:\n  Hither the Lycian princes bend their course,\n  The best and bravest of the hostile force.\n  But if too fiercely there the foes contend,\n  Let Telamon, at least, our towers defend,\n  And Teucer haste with his unerring bow\n  To share the danger, and repel the foe.\"\n\n  Swift, at the word, the herald speeds along\n  The lofty ramparts, through the martial throng,\n  And finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore,\n  Opposed in combat on the dusty shore.\n  \"Ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands!\n  Your aid (said Thoos) Peteus' son demands;\n  Your strength, united, best may help to bear\n  The bloody labours of the doubtful war:\n  Thither the Lycian princes bend their course,\n  The best and bravest of the hostile force.\n  But if too fiercely, here, the foes contend,\n  At least, let Telamon those towers defend,\n  And Teucer haste with his unerring bow\n  To share the danger, and repel the foe.\"\n\n  Straight to the fort great Ajax turn'd his care,\n  And thus bespoke his brothers of the war:\n  \"Now, valiant Lycomede!

lend your valiant hands,\n  Haste to the fleet, and toss the blazing brands!\"\n  They hear, they run; and, gathering at his call,\n  Raise scaling engines, and ascend the wall:\n  Around the works a wood of glittering spears\n  Shoots up, and all the rising host appears.\n  A ponderous stone bold Hector heaved to throw,\n  Pointed above, and rough and gross below:\n  Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,\n  Such men as live in these degenerate days:\n  Yet this, as easy as a swain could bear\n  The snowy fleece, he toss'd, and shook in air;\n  For Jove upheld, and lighten'd of its load\n  The unwieldy rock, the labour of a god.\n  Thus arm'd, before the folded gates he came,\n  Of massy substance, and stupendous frame;\n  With iron bars and brazen hinges strong,\n  On lofty beams of solid timber hung:\n  Then thundering through the planks with forceful sway,\n  Drives the sharp rock; the solid beams give way,\n  The folds are shatter'd; from the crackling door\n  Leap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.\n  Now rushing in, the furious chief appears,\n  Gloomy as night! and shakes two shining spears:(228)\n  A dreadful gleam from his bright armour came,\n  And from his eye-balls flash'd the living flame.\n  He moves a god, resistless in his course,\n  And seems a match for more than mortal force.\n  Then pouring after, through the gaping space,\n  A tide of Trojans flows, and fills the place;\n  The Greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly;\n  The shore is heap'd with death, and tumult rends the sky.\n\n                       [Illustration: GREEK ALTAR.]\n\n                               GREEK ALTAR.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XIII.\n\n\nARGUMENT.\n\nTHE FOURTH BATTLE CONTINUED, IN WHICH NEPTUNE ASSISTS THE GREEKS: THE ACTS\nOF IDOMENEUS.\n\nNeptune, concerned for the loss of the Grecians, upon seeing the\nfortification forced by Hector, (who had entered the gate near the station\nof the Ajaces,) assumes the shape of Calchas, and inspires those heroes to\noppose him: then, in the form of one of the generals, encourages the other\nGreeks who had retired to their vessels. The Ajaces form their troops in a\nclose phalanx, and put a stop to Hector and the Trojans. Several deeds of\nvalour are performed; Meriones, losing his spear in the encounter, repairs\nto seek another at the tent of Idomeneus: this occasions a conversation\nbetween those two warriors, who return together to the battle. Idomeneus\nsignalizes his courage above the rest; he kills Othryoneus, Asius, and\nAlcathous: Deiphobus and AEneas march against him, and at length Idomeneus\nretires. Menelaus wounds Helenus, and kills Pisander. The Trojans are\nrepulsed on the left wing; Hector still keeps his ground against the\nAjaces, till, being galled by the Locrian slingers and archers, Polydamas\nadvises to call a council of war: Hector approves of his advice, but goes\nfirst to rally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, meets Ajax\nagain, and renews the attack.\n\nThe eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between the\nGrecian wall and the sea-shore.\n\n  When now the Thunderer on the sea-beat coast\n  Had fix'd great Hector and his conquering host,\n  He left them to the fates, in bloody fray\n  To toil and struggle through the well-fought day.\n  Then turn'd to Thracia from the field of fight\n  Those eyes that shed insufferable light,\n  To where the Mysians prove their martial force,\n  And hardy Thracians tame the savage horse;\n  And where the far-famed Hippomolgian strays,\n  Renown'd for justice and for length of days;(229)\n  Thrice happy race!

not raised by mortal hands:\n  This having reach'd, his brass-hoof'd steeds he reins,\n  Fleet as the winds, and deck'd with golden manes.\n  Refulgent arms his mighty limbs infold,\n  Immortal arms of adamant and gold.\n  He mounts the car, the golden scourge applies,\n  He sits superior, and the chariot flies:\n  His whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep;\n  The enormous monsters rolling o'er the deep\n  Gambol around him on the watery way,\n  And heavy whales in awkward measures play;\n  The sea subsiding spreads a level plain,\n  Exults, and owns the monarch of the main;\n  The parting waves before his coursers fly;\n  The wondering waters leave his axle dry.\n\n  Deep in the liquid regions lies a cave,\n  Between where Tenedos the surges lave,\n  And rocky Imbrus breaks the rolling wave:\n  There the great ruler of the azure round\n  Stopp'd his swift chariot, and his steeds unbound,\n  Fed with ambrosial herbage from his hand,\n  And link'd their fetlocks with a golden band,\n  Infrangible, immortal: there they stay:\n  The father of the floods pursues his way:\n  Where, like a tempest, darkening heaven around,\n  Or fiery deluge that devours the ground,\n  The impatient Trojans, in a gloomy throng,\n  Embattled roll'd, as Hector rush'd along:\n  To the loud tumult and the barbarous cry\n  The heavens re-echo, and the shores reply:\n  They vow destruction to the Grecian name,\n  And in their hopes the fleets already flame.\n\n  But Neptune, rising from the seas profound,\n  The god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground,\n  Now wears a mortal form; like Calchas seen,\n  Such his loud voice, and such his manly mien;\n  His shouts incessant every Greek inspire,\n  But most the Ajaces, adding fire to fire.\n\n               [Illustration: NEPTUNE RISING FROM THE SEA.]\n\n                       NEPTUNE RISING FROM THE SEA.\n\n\n  \"'Tis yours, O warriors, all our hopes to raise:\n  Oh recollect your ancient worth and praise!\n  'Tis yours to save us, if you cease to fear;\n  Flight, more than shameful, is destructive here.\n  On other works though Troy with fury fall,\n  And pour her armies o'er our batter'd wall:\n  There Greece has strength: but this, this part o'erthrown,\n  Her strength were vain; I dread for you alone:\n  Here Hector rages like the force of fire,\n  Vaunts of his gods, and calls high Jove his sire:\n  If yet some heavenly power your breast excite,\n  Breathe in your hearts, and string your arms to fight,\n  Greece yet may live, her threaten'd fleet maintain:\n  And Hector's force, and Jove's own aid, be vain.\"\n\n  Then with his sceptre, that the deep controls,\n  He touch'd the chiefs, and steel'd their manly souls:\n  Strength, not their own, the touch divine imparts,\n  Prompts their light limbs, and swells their daring hearts.\n  Then, as a falcon from the rocky height,\n  Her quarry seen, impetuous at the sight,\n  Forth-springing instant, darts herself from high,\n  Shoots on the wing, and skims along the sky:\n  Such, and so swift, the power of ocean flew;\n  The wide horizon shut him from their view.\n\n  The inspiring god Oileus' active son\n  Perceived the first, and thus to Telamon:\n\n  \"Some god, my friend, some god in human form\n  Favouring descends, and wills to stand the storm.\n  Not Calchas this, the venerable seer;\n  Short as he turned, I saw the power appear:\n  I mark'd his parting, and the steps he trod;\n  His own bright evidence reveals a god.\n  Even now some energy divine I share,\n  And seem to walk on wings, and tread in air!\"\n\n  \"With equal ardour (Telamon returns)\n  My soul is kindled, and my bosom burns;\n  New rising spirits all my force alarm,\n  Lift each impatient limb, and brace my arm.\n  This ready arm, unthinking, shakes the dart;\n  The blood pours back, and fortifies my heart:\n  Singly, methinks, yon towering chief I meet,\n  And stretch the dreadful Hector at my feet.\"\n\n  Full of the god that urged their burning breast,\n  The heroes thus their mutual warmth express'd.\n  Neptune meanwhile the routed Greeks inspired;\n  Who, breathless, pale, with length of labours tired,\n  Pant in the ships; while Troy to conquest calls,\n  And swarms victorious o'er their yielding walls:\n  Trembling before the impending storm they lie,\n  While tears of rage stand burning in their eye.\n  Greece sunk they thought, and this their fatal hour;\n  But breathe new courage as they feel the power.\n  Teucer and Leitus first his words excite;\n  Then stern Peneleus rises to the fight;\n  Thoas, Deipyrus, in arms renown'd,\n  And Merion next, the impulsive fury found;\n  Last Nestor's son the same bold ardour takes,\n  While thus the god the martial fire awakes:\n\n  \"Oh lasting infamy, oh dire disgrace\n  To chiefs of vigorous youth, and manly race!\n  I trusted in the gods, and you, to see\n  Brave Greece victorious, and her navy free:\n  Ah, no--the glorious combat you disclaim,\n  And one black day clouds all her former fame.\n  Heavens!

your timely aid unite;\n  Lo, great AEneas rushes to the fight:\n  Sprung from a god, and more than mortal bold;\n  He fresh in youth, and I in arms grown old.\n  Else should this hand, this hour decide the strife,\n  The great dispute, of glory, or of life.\"\n\n  He spoke, and all, as with one soul, obey'd;\n  Their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade\n  Around the chief. AEneas too demands\n  Th' assisting forces of his native bands;\n  Paris, Deiphobus, Agenor, join;\n  (Co-aids and captains of the Trojan line;)\n  In order follow all th' embodied train,\n  Like Ida's flocks proceeding o'er the plain;\n  Before his fleecy care, erect and bold,\n  Stalks the proud ram, the father of the bold.\n  With joy the swain surveys them, as he leads\n  To the cool fountains, through the well-known meads:\n  So joys AEneas, as his native band\n  Moves on in rank, and stretches o'er the land.\n\n  Round dread Alcathous now the battle rose;\n  On every side the steely circle grows;\n  Now batter'd breast-plates and hack'd helmets ring,\n  And o'er their heads unheeded javelins sing.\n  Above the rest, two towering chiefs appear,\n  There great Idomeneus, AEneas here.\n  Like gods of war, dispensing fate, they stood,\n  And burn'd to drench the ground with mutual blood.\n  The Trojan weapon whizz'd along in air;\n  The Cretan saw, and shunn'd the brazen spear:\n  Sent from an arm so strong, the missive wood\n  Stuck deep in earth, and quiver'd where it stood.\n  But OEnomas received the Cretan's stroke;\n  The forceful spear his hollow corslet broke,\n  It ripp'd his belly with a ghastly wound,\n  And roll'd the smoking entrails on the ground.\n  Stretch'd on the plain, he sobs away his breath,\n  And, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death.\n  The victor from his breast the weapon tears;\n  His spoils he could not, for the shower of spears.\n  Though now unfit an active war to wage,\n  Heavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age,\n  His listless limbs unable for the course,\n  In standing fight he yet maintains his force;\n  Till faint with labour, and by foes repell'd,\n  His tired slow steps he drags from off the field.\n  Deiphobus beheld him as he pass'd,\n  And, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast:\n  The javelin err'd, but held its course along,\n  And pierced Ascalaphus, the brave and young:\n  The son of Mars fell gasping on the ground,\n  And gnash'd the dust, all bloody with his wound.\n\n  Nor knew the furious father of his fall;\n  High-throned amidst the great Olympian hall,\n  On golden clouds th' immortal synod sate;\n  Detain'd from bloody war by Jove and Fate.\n\n  Now, where in dust the breathless hero lay,\n  For slain Ascalaphus commenced the fray,\n  Deiphobus to seize his helmet flies,\n  And from his temples rends the glittering prize;\n  Valiant as Mars, Meriones drew near,\n  And on his loaded arm discharged his spear:\n  He drops the weight, disabled with the pain;\n  The hollow helmet rings against the plain.\n  Swift as a vulture leaping on his prey,\n  From his torn arm the Grecian rent away\n  The reeking javelin, and rejoin'd his friends.\n  His wounded brother good Polites tends;\n  Around his waist his pious arms he threw,\n  And from the rage of battle gently drew:\n  Him his swift coursers, on his splendid car,\n  Rapt from the lessening thunder of the war;\n  To Troy they drove him, groaning from the shore,\n  And sprinkling, as he pass'd, the sands with gore.\n\n  Meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground,\n  Heaps fall on heaps, and heaven and earth resound.\n  Bold Aphareus by great AEneas bled;\n  As toward the chief he turn'd his daring head,\n  He pierced his throat; the bending head, depress'd\n  Beneath his helmet, nods upon his breast;\n  His shield reversed o'er the fallen warrior lies,\n  And everlasting slumber seals his eyes.\n  Antilochus, as Thoon turn'd him round,\n  Transpierced his back with a dishonest wound:\n  The hollow vein, that to the neck extends\n  Along the chine, his eager javelin rends:\n  Supine he falls, and to his social train\n  Spreads his imploring arms, but spreads in vain.\n  Th' exulting victor, leaping where he lay,\n  From his broad shoulders tore the spoils away;\n  His time observed; for closed by foes around,\n  On all sides thick the peals of arms resound.\n  His shield emboss'd the ringing storm sustains,\n  But he impervious and untouch'd remains.\n  (Great Neptune's care preserved from hostile rage\n  This youth, the joy of Nestor's glorious age.)\n  In arms intrepid, with the first he fought,\n  Faced every foe, and every danger sought;\n  His winged lance, resistless as the wind,\n  Obeys each motion of the master's mind!\n  Restless it flies, impatient to be free,\n  And meditates the distant enemy.\n  The son of Asius, Adamas, drew near,\n  And struck his target with the brazen spear\n  Fierce in his front: but Neptune wards the blow,\n  And blunts the javelin of th' eluded foe:\n  In the broad buckler half the weapon stood,\n  Splinter'd on earth flew half the broken wood.\n  Disarm'd, he mingled in the Trojan crew;\n  But Merion's spear o'ertook him as he flew,\n  Deep in the belly's rim an entrance found,\n  Where sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound.\n  Bending he fell, and doubled to the ground,\n  Lay panting. Thus an ox in fetters tied,\n  While death's strong pangs distend his labouring side,\n  His bulk enormous on the field displays;\n  His heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays.\n  The spear the conqueror from his body drew,\n  And death's dim shadows swarm before his view.\n  Next brave Deipyrus in dust was laid:\n  King Helenus waved high the Thracian blade,\n  And smote his temples with an arm so strong,\n  The helm fell off, and roll'd amid the throng:\n  There for some luckier Greek it rests a prize;\n  For dark in death the godlike owner lies!\n  Raging with grief, great Menelaus burns,\n  And fraught with vengeance, to the victor turns:\n  That shook the ponderous lance, in act to throw;\n  And this stood adverse with the bended bow:\n  Full on his breast the Trojan arrow fell,\n  But harmless bounded from the plated steel.\n  As on some ample barn's well harden'd floor,\n  (The winds collected at each open door,)\n  While the broad fan with force is whirl'd around,\n  Light leaps the golden grain, resulting from the ground:\n  So from the steel that guards Atrides' heart,\n  Repell'd to distance flies the bounding dart.\n  Atrides, watchful of the unwary foe,\n  Pierced with his lance the hand that grasp'd the bow.\n  And nailed it to the yew: the wounded hand\n  Trail'd the long lance that mark'd with blood the sand:\n  But good Agenor gently from the wound\n  The spear solicits, and the bandage bound;\n  A sling's soft wool, snatch'd from a soldier's side,\n  At once the tent and ligature supplied.\n\n  Behold! Pisander, urged by fate's decree,\n  Springs through the ranks to fall, and fall by thee,\n  Great Menelaus! to enchance thy fame:\n  High-towering in the front, the warrior came.\n  First the sharp lance was by Atrides thrown;\n  The lance far distant by the winds was blown.\n  Nor pierced Pisander through Atrides' shield:\n  Pisander's spear fell shiver'd on the field.\n  Not so discouraged, to the future blind,\n  Vain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind;\n  Dauntless he rushes where the Spartan lord\n  Like lightning brandish'd his far beaming sword.\n  His left arm high opposed the shining shield:\n  His right beneath, the cover'd pole-axe held;\n  (An olive's cloudy grain the handle made,\n  Distinct with studs, and brazen was the blade;)\n  This on the helm discharged a noble blow;\n  The plume dropp'd nodding to the plain below,\n  Shorn from the crest. Atrides waved his steel:\n  Deep through his front the weighty falchion fell;\n  The crashing bones before its force gave way;\n  In dust and blood the groaning hero lay:\n  Forced from their ghastly orbs, and spouting gore,\n  The clotted eye-balls tumble on the shore.\n  And fierce Atrides spurn'd him as he bled,\n  Tore off his arms, and, loud-exulting, said:\n\n  \"Thus, Trojans, thus, at length be taught to fear;\n  O race perfidious, who delight in war!\n  Already noble deeds ye have perform'd;\n  A princess raped transcends a navy storm'd:\n  In such bold feats your impious might approve,\n  Without th' assistance, or the fear of Jove.\n  The violated rites, the ravish'd dame;\n  Our heroes slaughter'd and our ships on flame,\n  Crimes heap'd on crimes, shall bend your glory down,\n  And whelm in ruins yon flagitious town.\n  O thou, great father! lord of earth and skies,\n  Above the thought of man, supremely wise!\n  If from thy hand the fates of mortals flow,\n  From whence this favour to an impious foe?\n  A godless crew, abandon'd and unjust,\n  Still breathing rapine, violence, and lust?\n  The best of things, beyond their measure, cloy;\n  Sleep's balmy blessing, love's endearing joy;\n  The feast, the dance; whate'er mankind desire,\n  Even the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire.\n  But Troy for ever reaps a dire delight\n  In thirst of slaughter, and in lust of fight.\"\n\n  This said, he seized (while yet the carcase heaved)\n  The bloody armour, which his train received:\n  Then sudden mix'd among the warring crew,\n  And the bold son of Pylaemenes slew.\n  Harpalion had through Asia travell'd far,\n  Following his martial father to the war:\n  Through filial love he left his native shore,\n  Never, ah, never to behold it more!\n  His unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling\n  Against the target of the Spartan king;\n  Thus of his lance disarm'd, from death he flies,\n  And turns around his apprehensive eyes.\n  Him, through the hip transpiercing as he fled,\n  The shaft of Merion mingled with the dead.\n  Beneath the bone the glancing point descends,\n  And, driving down, the swelling bladder rends:\n  Sunk in his sad companions' arms he lay,\n  And in short pantings sobb'd his soul away;\n  (Like some vile worm extended on the ground;)\n  While life's red torrent gush'd from out the wound.\n\n  Him on his car the Paphlagonian train\n  In slow procession bore from off the plain.\n  The pensive father, father now no more!\n  Attends the mournful pomp along the shore;\n  And unavailing tears profusely shed;\n  And, unrevenged, deplored his offspring dead.\n\n  Paris from far the moving sight beheld,\n  With pity soften'd and with fury swell'd:\n  His honour'd host, a youth of matchless grace,\n  And loved of all the Paphlagonian race!\n  With his full strength he bent his angry bow,\n  And wing'd the feather'd vengeance at the foe.\n  A chief there was, the brave Euchenor named,\n  For riches much, and more for virtue famed.\n  Who held his seat in Corinth's stately town;\n  Polydus' son, a seer of old renown.\n  Oft had the father told his early doom,\n  By arms abroad, or slow disease at home:\n  He climb'd his vessel, prodigal of breath,\n  And chose the certain glorious path to death.\n  Beneath his ear the pointed arrow went;\n  The soul came issuing at the narrow vent:\n  His limbs, unnerved, drop useless on the ground,\n  And everlasting darkness shades him round.\n\n  Nor knew great Hector how his legions yield,\n  (Wrapp'd in the cloud and tumult of the field:)\n  Wide on the left the force of Greece commands,\n  And conquest hovers o'er th' Achaian bands;\n  With such a tide superior virtue sway'd,\n  And he that shakes the solid earth gave aid.\n  But in the centre Hector fix'd remain'd,\n  Where first the gates were forced, and bulwarks gain'd;\n  There, on the margin of the hoary deep,\n  (Their naval station where the Ajaces keep.\n  And where low walls confine the beating tides,\n  Whose humble barrier scarce the foe divides;\n  Where late in fight both foot and horse engaged,\n  And all the thunder of the battle raged,)\n  There join'd, the whole Boeotian strength remains,\n  The proud Iaonians with their sweeping trains,\n  Locrians and Phthians, and th' Epaean force;\n  But join'd, repel not Hector's fiery course.\n  The flower of Athens, Stichius, Phidas, led;\n  Bias and great Menestheus at their head:\n  Meges the strong the Epaean bands controll'd,\n  And Dracius prudent, and Amphion bold:\n  The Phthians, Medon, famed for martial might,\n  And brave Podarces, active in the fight.\n  This drew from Phylacus his noble line;\n  Iphiclus' son: and that (Oileus) thine:\n  (Young Ajax' brother, by a stolen embrace;\n  He dwelt far distant from his native place,\n  By his fierce step-dame from his father's reign\n  Expell'd and exiled for her brother slain:)\n  These rule the Phthians, and their arms employ,\n  Mix'd with Boeotians, on the shores of Troy.\n\n  Now side by side, with like unwearied care,\n  Each Ajax laboured through the field of war:\n  So when two lordly bulls, with equal toil,\n  Force the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil,\n  Join'd to one yoke, the stubborn earth they tear,\n  And trace large furrows with the shining share;\n  O'er their huge limbs the foam descends in snow,\n  And streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow.\n  A train of heroes followed through the field,\n  Who bore by turns great Ajax' sevenfold shield;\n  Whene'er he breathed, remissive of his might,\n  Tired with the incessant slaughters of the fight.\n  No following troops his brave associate grace:\n  In close engagement an unpractised race,\n  The Locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield,\n  Nor bear the helm, nor lift the moony shield;\n  But skill'd from far the flying shaft to wing,\n  Or whirl the sounding pebble from the sling,\n  Dexterous with these they aim a certain wound,\n  Or fell the distant warrior to the ground.\n  Thus in the van the Telamonian train,\n  Throng'd in bright arms, a pressing fight maintain:\n  Far in the rear the Locrian archers lie,\n  Whose stones and arrows intercept the sky,\n  The mingled tempest on the foes they pour;\n  Troy's scattering orders open to the shower.\n\n  Now had the Greeks eternal fame acquired,\n  And the gall'd Ilians to their walls retired;\n  But sage Polydamas, discreetly brave,\n  Address'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:\n\n  \"Though great in all, thou seem'st averse to lend\n  Impartial audience to a faithful friend;\n  To gods and men thy matchless worth is known,\n  And every art of glorious war thy own;\n  But in cool thought and counsel to excel,\n  How widely differs this from warring well!\n  Content with what the bounteous gods have given,\n  Seek not alone to engross the gifts of Heaven.\n  To some the powers of bloody war belong,\n  To some sweet music and the charm of song;\n  To few, and wondrous few, has Jove assign'd\n  A wise, extensive, all-considering mind;\n  Their guardians these, the nations round confess,\n  And towns and empires for their safety bless.\n  If Heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast,\n  Attend, O Hector! what I judge the best,\n  See, as thou mov'st, on dangers dangers spread,\n  And war's whole fury burns around thy head.\n  Behold! distress'd within yon hostile wall,\n  How many Trojans yield, disperse, or fall!\n  What troops, out-number'd, scarce the war maintain!\n  And what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!\n  Here cease thy fury: and, the chiefs and kings\n  Convoked to council, weigh the sum of things.\n  Whether (the gods succeeding our desires)\n  To yon tall ships to bear the Trojan fires;\n  Or quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away,\n  Contented with the conquest of the day.\n  I fear, I fear, lest Greece, not yet undone,\n  Pay the large debt of last revolving sun;\n  Achilles, great Achilles, yet remains\n  On yonder decks, and yet o'erlooks the plains!\"\n\n  The counsel pleased; and Hector, with a bound,\n  Leap'd from his chariot on the trembling ground;\n  Swift as he leap'd his clanging arms resound.\n  \"To guard this post (he cried) thy art employ,\n  And here detain the scatter'd youth of Troy;\n  Where yonder heroes faint, I bend my way,\n  And hasten back to end the doubtful day.\"\n\n  This said, the towering chief prepares to go,\n  Shakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow,\n  And seems a moving mountain topp'd with snow.\n  Through all his host, inspiring force, he flies,\n  And bids anew the martial thunder rise.\n  To Panthus' son, at Hector's high command\n  Haste the bold leaders of the Trojan band:\n  But round the battlements, and round the plain,\n  For many a chief he look'd, but look'd in vain;\n  Deiphobus, nor Helenus the seer,\n  Nor Asius' son, nor Asius' self appear:\n  For these were pierced with many a ghastly wound,\n  Some cold in death, some groaning on the ground;\n  Some low in dust, (a mournful object) lay;\n  High on the wall some breathed their souls away.\n\n  Far on the left, amid the throng he found\n  (Cheering the troops, and dealing deaths around)\n  The graceful Paris; whom, with fury moved,\n  Opprobrious thus, th' impatient chief reproved:\n\n  \"Ill-fated Paris! slave to womankind,\n  As smooth of face as fraudulent of mind!\n  Where is Deiphobus, where Asius gone?\n  The godlike father, and th' intrepid son?\n  The force of Helenus, dispensing fate;\n  And great Othryoneus, so fear'd of late?\n  Black fate hang's o'er thee from th' avenging gods,\n  Imperial Troy from her foundations nods;\n  Whelm'd in thy country's ruin shalt thou fall,\n  And one devouring vengeance swallow all.\"\n\n  When Paris thus: \"My brother and my friend,\n  Thy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend,\n  In other battles I deserved thy blame,\n  Though then not deedless, nor unknown to fame:\n  But since yon rampart by thy arms lay low,\n  I scatter'd slaughter from my fatal bow.\n  The chiefs you seek on yonder shore lie slain;\n  Of all those heroes, two alone remain;\n  Deiphobus, and Helenus the seer,\n  Each now disabled by a hostile spear.\n  Go then, successful, where thy soul inspires:\n  This heart and hand shall second all thy fires:\n  What with this arm I can, prepare to know,\n  Till death for death be paid, and blow for blow.\n  But 'tis not ours, with forces not our own\n  To combat: strength is of the gods alone.\"\n  These words the hero's angry mind assuage:\n  Then fierce they mingle where the thickest rage.\n  Around Polydamas, distain'd with blood,\n  Cebrion, Phalces, stern Orthaeus stood,\n  Palmus, with Polypoetes the divine,\n  And two bold brothers of Hippotion's line\n  (Who reach'd fair Ilion, from Ascania far,\n  The former day; the next engaged in war).\n  As when from gloomy clouds a whirlwind springs,\n  That bears Jove's thunder on its dreadful wings,\n  Wide o'er the blasted fields the tempest sweeps;\n  Then, gather'd, settles on the hoary deeps;\n  The afflicted deeps tumultuous mix and roar;\n  The waves behind impel the waves before,\n  Wide rolling, foaming high, and tumbling to the shore:\n  Thus rank on rank, the thick battalions throng,\n  Chief urged on chief, and man drove man along.\n  Far o'er the plains, in dreadful order bright,\n  The brazen arms reflect a beamy light:\n  Full in the blazing van great Hector shined,\n  Like Mars commission'd to confound mankind.\n  Before him flaming his enormous shield,\n  Like the broad sun, illumined all the field;\n  His nodding helm emits a streamy ray;\n  His piercing eyes through all the battle stray,\n  And, while beneath his targe he flash'd along,\n  Shot terrors round, that wither'd e'en the strong.\n\n  Thus stalk'd he, dreadful; death was in his look:\n  Whole nations fear'd; but not an Argive shook.\n  The towering Ajax, with an ample stride,\n  Advanced the first, and thus the chief defied:\n\n  \"Hector! come on; thy empty threats forbear;\n  'Tis not thy arm, 'tis thundering Jove we fear:\n  The skill of war to us not idly given,\n  Lo! Greece is humbled, not by Troy, but Heaven.\n  Vain are the hopes that haughty mind imparts,\n  To force our fleet: the Greeks have hands and hearts.\n  Long ere in flames our lofty navy fall,\n  Your boasted city, and your god-built wall,\n  Shall sink beneath us, smoking on the ground;\n  And spread a long unmeasured ruin round.\n  The time shall come, when, chased along the plain,\n  Even thou shalt call on Jove, and call in vain;\n  Even thou shalt wish, to aid thy desperate course,\n  The wings of falcons for thy flying horse;\n  Shalt run, forgetful of a warrior's fame,\n  While clouds of friendly dust conceal thy shame.\"\n\n  As thus he spoke, behold, in open view,\n  On sounding wings a dexter eagle flew.\n  To Jove's glad omen all the Grecians rise,\n  And hail, with shouts, his progress through the skies:\n  Far-echoing clamours bound from side to side;\n  They ceased; and thus the chief of Troy replied:\n\n  \"From whence this menace, this insulting strain?\n  Enormous boaster! doom'd to vaunt in vain.\n  So may the gods on Hector life bestow,\n  (Not that short life which mortals lead below,\n  But such as those of Jove's high lineage born,\n  The blue-eyed maid, or he that gilds the morn,)\n  As this decisive day shall end the fame\n  Of Greece, and Argos be no more a name.\n  And thou, imperious! if thy madness wait\n  The lance of Hector, thou shalt meet thy fate:\n  That giant-corse, extended on the shore,\n  Shall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore.\"\n\n  He said; and like a lion stalk'd along:\n  With shouts incessant earth and ocean rung,\n  Sent from his following host: the Grecian train\n  With answering thunders fill'd the echoing plain;\n  A shout that tore heaven's concave, and, above,\n  Shook the fix'd splendours of the throne of Jove.\n\n                     [Illustration: GREEK EARRINGS.]\n\n                             GREEK EARRINGS.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XIV.\n\n\nARGUMENT.(231)\n\nJUNO DECEIVES JUPITER BY THE GIRDLE OF VENUS.\n\nNestor, sitting at the table with Machaon, is alarmed with the increasing\nclamour of war, and hastens to Agamemnon; on his way he meets that prince\nwith Diomed and Ulysses, whom he informs of the extremity of the danger.\nAgamemnon proposes to make their escape by night, which Ulysses\nwithstands; to which Diomed adds his advice, that, wounded as they were,\nthey should go forth and encourage the army with their presence, which\nadvice is pursued. Juno, seeing the partiality of Jupiter to the Trojans,\nforms a design to over-reach him: she sets off her charms with the utmost\ncare, and (the more surely to enchant him) obtains the magic girdle of\nVenus. She then applies herself to the god of sleep, and, with some\ndifficulty, persuades him to seal the eyes of Jupiter: this done, she goes\nto mount Ida, where the god, at first sight, is ravished with her beauty,\nsinks in her embraces, and is laid asleep. Neptune takes advantage of his\nslumber, and succours the Greeks: Hector is struck to the ground with a\nprodigious stone by Ajax, and carried off from the battle: several actions\nsucceed, till the Trojans, much distressed, are obliged to give way: the\nlesser Ajax signalizes himself in a particular manner.\n\n  But not the genial feast, nor flowing bowl,\n  Could charm the cares of Nestor's watchful soul;\n  His startled ears the increasing cries attend;\n  Then thus, impatient, to his wounded friend:\n\n  \"What new alarm, divine Machaon, say,\n  What mix'd events attend this mighty day?\n  Hark! how the shouts divide, and how they meet,\n  And now come full, and thicken to the fleet!\n  Here with the cordial draught dispel thy care,\n  Let Hecamede the strengthening bath prepare,\n  Refresh thy wound, and cleanse the clotted gore;\n  While I the adventures of the day explore.\"\n\n  He said: and, seizing Thrasymedes' shield,\n  (His valiant offspring,) hasten'd to the field;\n  (That day the son his father's buckler bore;)\n  Then snatch'd a lance, and issued from the door.\n  Soon as the prospect open'd to his view,\n  His wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew;\n  Dire disarray! the tumult of the fight,\n  The wall in ruins, and the Greeks in flight.\n  As when old ocean's silent surface sleeps,\n  The waves just heaving on the purple deeps:\n  While yet the expected tempest hangs on high,\n  Weighs down the cloud, and blackens in the sky,\n  The mass of waters will no wind obey;\n  Jove sends one gust, and bids them roll away.\n  While wavering counsels thus his mind engage,\n  Fluctuates in doubtful thought the Pylian sage,\n  To join the host, or to the general haste;\n  Debating long, he fixes on the last:\n  Yet, as he moves, the sight his bosom warms,\n  The field rings dreadful with the clang of arms,\n  The gleaming falchions flash, the javelins fly;\n  Blows echo blows, and all or kill or die.\n\n  Him, in his march, the wounded princes meet,\n  By tardy steps ascending from the fleet:\n  The king of men, Ulysses the divine,\n  And who to Tydeus owes his noble line.(232)\n  (Their ships at distance from the battle stand,\n  In lines advanced along the shelving strand:\n  Whose bay, the fleet unable to contain\n  At length; beside the margin of the main,\n  Rank above rank, the crowded ships they moor:\n  Who landed first, lay highest on the shore.)\n  Supported on the spears, they took their way,\n  Unfit to fight, but anxious for the day.\n  Nestor's approach alarm'd each Grecian breast,\n  Whom thus the general of the host address'd:\n\n  \"O grace and glory of the Achaian name;\n  What drives thee, Nestor, from the field of fame?\n  Shall then proud Hector see his boast fulfill'd,\n  Our fleets in ashes, and our heroes kill'd?\n  Such was his threat, ah! now too soon made good,\n  On many a Grecian bosom writ in blood.\n  Is every heart inflamed with equal rage\n  Against your king, nor will one chief engage?\n  And have I lived to see with mournful eyes\n  In every Greek a new Achilles rise?\"\n\n  Gerenian Nestor then: \"So fate has will'd;\n  And all-confirming time has fate fulfill'd.\n  Not he that thunders from the aerial bower,\n  Not Jove himself, upon the past has power.\n  The wall, our late inviolable bound,\n  And best defence, lies smoking on the ground:\n  Even to the ships their conquering arms extend,\n  And groans of slaughter'd Greeks to heaven ascend.\n  On speedy measures then employ your thought\n  In such distress! if counsel profit aught:\n  Arms cannot much: though Mars our souls incite,\n  These gaping wounds withhold us from the fight.\"\n\n  To him the monarch: \"That our army bends,\n  That Troy triumphant our high fleet ascends,\n  And that the rampart, late our surest trust\n  And best defence, lies smoking in the dust;\n  All this from Jove's afflictive hand we bear,\n  Who, far from Argos, wills our ruin here.\n  Past are the days when happier Greece was blest,\n  And all his favour, all his aid confess'd;\n  Now heaven averse, our hands from battle ties,\n  And lifts the Trojan glory to the skies.\n  Cease we at length to waste our blood in vain,\n  And launch what ships lie nearest to the main;\n  Leave these at anchor, till the coming night:\n  Then, if impetuous Troy forbear the fight,\n  Bring all to sea, and hoist each sail for flight.\n  Better from evils, well foreseen, to run,\n  Than perish in the danger we may shun.\"\n\n  Thus he. The sage Ulysses thus replies,\n  While anger flash'd from his disdainful eyes:\n  \"What shameful words (unkingly as thou art)\n  Fall from that trembling tongue and timorous heart?\n  Oh were thy sway the curse of meaner powers,\n  And thou the shame of any host but ours!\n  A host, by Jove endued with martial might,\n  And taught to conquer, or to fall in fight:\n  Adventurous combats and bold wars to wage,\n  Employ'd our youth, and yet employs our age.\n  And wilt thou thus desert the Trojan plain?\n  And have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain?\n  In such base sentence if thou couch thy fear,\n  Speak it in whispers, lest a Greek should hear.\n  Lives there a man so dead to fame, who dares\n  To think such meanness, or the thought declares?\n  And comes it even from him whose sovereign sway\n  The banded legions of all Greece obey?\n  Is this a general's voice that calls to flight,\n  While war hangs doubtful, while his soldiers fight?\n  What more could Troy?

Juno, repairing to the assembly of the gods, attempts,\nwith extraordinary address, to incense them against Jupiter; in particular\nshe touches Mars with a violent resentment; he is ready to take arms, but\nis prevented by Minerva. Iris and Apollo obey the orders of Jupiter; Iris\ncommands Neptune to leave the battle, to which, after much reluctance and\npassion, he consents. Apollo reinspires Hector with vigour, brings him\nback to the battle, marches before him with his aegis, and turns the\nfortune of the fight. He breaks down great part of the Grecian wall: the\nTrojans rush in, and attempt to fire the first line of the fleet, but are,\nas yet, repelled by the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter.\n\n  Now in swift flight they pass the trench profound,\n  And many a chief lay gasping on the ground:\n  Then stopp'd and panted, where the chariots lie\n  Fear on their cheek, and horror in their eye.\n  Meanwhile, awaken'd from his dream of love,\n  On Ida's summit sat imperial Jove:\n  Round the wide fields he cast a careful view,\n  There saw the Trojans fly, the Greeks pursue;\n  These proud in arms, those scatter'd o'er the plain\n  And, 'midst the war, the monarch of the main.\n  Not far, great Hector on the dust he spies,\n  (His sad associates round with weeping eyes,)\n  Ejecting blood, and panting yet for breath,\n  His senses wandering to the verge of death.\n  The god beheld him with a pitying look,\n  And thus, incensed, to fraudful Juno spoke:\n\n  \"O thou, still adverse to the eternal will,\n  For ever studious in promoting ill!\n  Thy arts have made the godlike Hector yield,\n  And driven his conquering squadrons from the field.\n  Canst thou, unhappy in thy wiles, withstand\n  Our power immense, and brave the almighty hand?\n  Hast thou forgot, when, bound and fix'd on high,\n  From the vast concave of the spangled sky,\n  I hung thee trembling in a golden chain,\n  And all the raging gods opposed in vain?\n  Headlong I hurl'd them from the Olympian hall,\n  Stunn'd in the whirl, and breathless with the fall.\n  For godlike Hercules these deeds were done,\n  Nor seem'd the vengeance worthy such a son:\n  When, by thy wiles induced, fierce Boreas toss'd\n  The shipwreck'd hero on the Coan coast,\n  Him through a thousand forms of death I bore,\n  And sent to Argos, and his native shore.\n  Hear this, remember, and our fury dread,\n  Nor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head;\n  Lest arts and blandishments successless prove,\n  Thy soft deceits, and well-dissembled love.\"\n\n  The Thunderer spoke: imperial Juno mourn'd,\n  And, trembling, these submissive words return'd:\n\n  \"By every oath that powers immortal ties,\n  The foodful earth and all-infolding skies;\n  By thy black waves, tremendous Styx! that flow\n  Through the drear realms of gliding ghosts below;\n  By the dread honours of thy sacred head,\n  And that unbroken vow, our virgin bed!\n  Not by my arts the ruler of the main\n  Steeps Troy in blood, and ranges round the plain:\n  By his own ardour, his own pity sway'd,\n  To help his Greeks, he fought and disobey'd:\n  Else had thy Juno better counsels given,\n  And taught submission to the sire of heaven.\"\n\n  \"Think'st thou with me? fair empress of the skies!\n  (The immortal father with a smile replies;)\n  Then soon the haughty sea-god shall obey,\n  Nor dare to act but when we point the way.\n  If truth inspires thy tongue, proclaim our will\n  To yon bright synod on the Olympian hill;\n  Our high decree let various Iris know,\n  And call the god that bears the silver bow.\n  Let her descend, and from the embattled plain\n  Command the sea-god to his watery reign:\n  While Phoebus hastes great Hector to prepare\n  To rise afresh, and once more wake the war:\n  His labouring bosom re-inspires with breath,\n  And calls his senses from the verge of death.\n  Greece chased by Troy, even to Achilles' fleet,\n  Shall fall by thousands at the hero's feet.\n  He, not untouch'd with pity, to the plain\n  Shall send Patroclus, but shall send in vain.\n  What youths he slaughters under Ilion's walls!\n  Even my loved son, divine Sarpedon, falls!\n  Vanquish'd at last by Hector's lance he lies.\n  Then, nor till then, shall great Achilles rise:\n  And lo! that instant, godlike Hector dies.\n  From that great hour the war's whole fortune turns,\n  Pallas assists, and lofty Ilion burns.\n  Not till that day shall Jove relax his rage,\n  Nor one of all the heavenly host engage\n  In aid of Greece. The promise of a god\n  I gave, and seal'd it with the almighty nod,\n  Achilles' glory to the stars to raise;\n  Such was our word, and fate the word obeys.\"\n\n  The trembling queen (the almighty order given)\n  Swift from the Idaean summit shot to heaven.\n  As some wayfaring man, who wanders o'er\n  In thought a length of lands he trod before,\n  Sends forth his active mind from place to place,\n  Joins hill to dale, and measures space with space:\n  So swift flew Juno to the bless'd abodes,\n  If thought of man can match the speed of gods.\n  There sat the powers in awful synod placed;\n  They bow'd, and made obeisance as she pass'd\n  Through all the brazen dome: with goblets crown'd(239)\n  They hail her queen; the nectar streams around.\n  Fair Themis first presents the golden bowl,\n  And anxious asks what cares disturb her soul?\n\n  To whom the white-arm'd goddess thus replies:\n  \"Enough thou know'st the tyrant of the skies,\n  Severely bent his purpose to fulfil,\n  Unmoved his mind, and unrestrain'd his will.\n  Go thou, the feasts of heaven attend thy call;\n  Bid the crown'd nectar circle round the hall:\n  But Jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome\n  Such stern decrees, such threaten'd woes to come,\n  As soon shall freeze mankind with dire surprise,\n  And damp the eternal banquets of the skies.\"\n\n  The goddess said, and sullen took her place;\n  Black horror sadden'd each celestial face.\n  To see the gathering grudge in every breast,\n  Smiles on her lips a spleenful joy express'd;\n  While on her wrinkled front, and eyebrow bent,\n  Sat stedfast care, and lowering discontent.\n  Thus she proceeds--\"Attend, ye powers above!\n  But know, 'tis madness to contest with Jove:\n  Supreme he sits; and sees, in pride of sway.\n  Your vassal godheads grudgingly obey:\n  Fierce in the majesty of power controls;\n  Shakes all the thrones of heaven, and bends the poles.\n  Submiss, immortals! all he wills, obey:\n  And thou, great Mars, begin and show the way.\n  Behold Ascalaphus! behold him die,\n  But dare not murmur, dare not vent a sigh;\n  Thy own loved boasted offspring lies o'erthrown,\n  If that loved boasted offspring be thy own.\"\n\n  Stern Mars, with anguish for his slaughter'd son,\n  Smote his rebelling breast, and fierce begun:\n  \"Thus then, immortals! thus shall Mars obey;\n  Forgive me, gods, and yield my vengeance way:\n  Descending first to yon forbidden plain,\n  The god of battles dares avenge the slain;\n  Dares, though the thunder bursting o'er my head\n  Should hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead.\"\n\n  With that he gives command to Fear and Flight\n  To join his rapid coursers for the fight:\n  Then grim in arms, with hasty vengeance flies;\n  Arms that reflect a radiance through the skies.\n  And now had Jove, by bold rebellion driven,\n  Discharged his wrath on half the host of heaven;\n  But Pallas, springing through the bright abode,\n  Starts from her azure throne to calm the god.\n  Struck for the immortal race with timely fear,\n  From frantic Mars she snatch'd the shield and spear;\n  Then the huge helmet lifting from his head,\n  Thus to the impetuous homicide she said:\n\n  \"By what wild passion, furious! art thou toss'd?\n  Striv'st thou with Jove? thou art already lost.\n  Shall not the Thunderer's dread command restrain,\n  And was imperial Juno heard in vain?\n  Back to the skies wouldst thou with shame be driven,\n  And in thy guilt involve the host of heaven?\n  Ilion and Greece no more should Jove engage,\n  The skies would yield an ampler scene of rage;\n  Guilty and guiltless find an equal fate\n  And one vast ruin whelm the Olympian state.\n  Cease then thy offspring's death unjust to call;\n  Heroes as great have died, and yet shall fall.\n  Why should heaven's law with foolish man comply\n  Exempted from the race ordain'd to die?\"\n\n  This menace fix'd the warrior to his throne;\n  Sullen he sat, and curb'd the rising groan.\n  Then Juno call'd (Jove's orders to obey)\n  The winged Iris, and the god of day.\n  \"Go wait the Thunderer's will (Saturnia cried)\n  On yon tall summit of the fountful Ide:\n  There in the father's awful presence stand,\n  Receive, and execute his dread command.\"\n\n  She said, and sat; the god that gilds the day,\n  And various Iris, wing their airy way.\n  Swift as the wind, to Ida's hills they came,\n  (Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game)\n  There sat the eternal; he whose nod controls\n  The trembling world, and shakes the steady poles.\n  Veil'd in a mist of fragrance him they found,\n  With clouds of gold and purple circled round.\n  Well-pleased the Thunderer saw their earnest care,\n  And prompt obedience to the queen of air;\n  Then (while a smile serenes his awful brow)\n  Commands the goddess of the showery bow:\n\n  \"Iris! descend, and what we here ordain,\n  Report to yon mad tyrant of the main.\n  Bid him from fight to his own deeps repair,\n  Or breathe from slaughter in the fields of air.\n  If he refuse, then let him timely weigh\n  Our elder birthright, and superior sway.\n  How shall his rashness stand the dire alarms,\n  If heaven's omnipotence descend in arms?\n  Strives he with me, by whom his power was given,\n  And is there equal to the lord of heaven?\"\n\n  The all-mighty spoke; the goddess wing'd her flight\n  To sacred Ilion from the Idaean height.\n  Swift as the rattling hail, or fleecy snows,\n  Drive through the skies, when Boreas fiercely blows;\n  So from the clouds descending Iris falls,\n  And to blue Neptune thus the goddess calls:\n\n  \"Attend the mandate of the sire above!\n  In me behold the messenger of Jove:\n  He bids thee from forbidden wars repair\n  To thine own deeps, or to the fields of air.\n  This if refused, he bids thee timely weigh\n  His elder birthright, and superior sway.\n  How shall thy rashness stand the dire alarms\n  If heaven's omnipotence descend in arms?\n  Striv'st thou with him by whom all power is given?\n  And art thou equal to the lord of heaven?\"\n\n  \"What means the haughty sovereign of the skies?\n  (The king of ocean thus, incensed, replies;)\n  Rule as he will his portion'd realms on high;\n  No vassal god, nor of his train, am I.\n  Three brother deities from Saturn came,\n  And ancient Rhea, earth's immortal dame:\n  Assign'd by lot, our triple rule we know;\n  Infernal Pluto sways the shades below;\n  O'er the wide clouds, and o'er the starry plain,\n  Ethereal Jove extends his high domain;\n  My court beneath the hoary waves I keep,\n  And hush the roarings of the sacred deep;\n  Olympus, and this earth, in common lie:\n  What claim has here the tyrant of the sky?\n  Far in the distant clouds let him control,\n  And awe the younger brothers of the pole;\n  There to his children his commands be given,\n  The trembling, servile, second race of heaven.\"\n\n  \"And must I then (said she), O sire of floods!\n  Bear this fierce answer to the king of gods?\n  Correct it yet, and change thy rash intent;\n  A noble mind disdains not to repent.\n  To elder brothers guardian fiends are given,\n  To scourge the wretch insulting them and heaven.\"\n\n  \"Great is the profit (thus the god rejoin'd)\n  When ministers are blest with prudent mind:\n  Warn'd by thy words, to powerful Jove I yield,\n  And quit, though angry, the contended field:\n  Not but his threats with justice I disclaim,\n  The same our honours, and our birth the same.\n  If yet, forgetful of his promise given\n  To Hermes, Pallas, and the queen of heaven,\n  To favour Ilion, that perfidious place,\n  He breaks his faith with half the ethereal race;\n  Give him to know, unless the Grecian train\n  Lay yon proud structures level with the plain,\n  Howe'er the offence by other gods be pass'd,\n  The wrath of Neptune shall for ever last.\"\n\n  Thus speaking, furious from the field he strode,\n  And plunged into the bosom of the flood.\n  The lord of thunders, from his lofty height\n  Beheld, and thus bespoke the source of light:\n\n  \"Behold! the god whose liquid arms are hurl'd\n  Around the globe, whose earthquakes rock the world,\n  Desists at length his rebel-war to wage,\n  Seeks his own seas, and trembles at our rage;\n  Else had my wrath, heaven's thrones all shaking round,\n  Burn'd to the bottom of his seas profound;\n  And all the gods that round old Saturn dwell\n  Had heard the thunders to the deeps of hell.\n  Well was the crime, and well the vengeance spared;\n  Even power immense had found such battle hard.\n  Go thou, my son! the trembling Greeks alarm,\n  Shake my broad aegis on thy active arm,\n  Be godlike Hector thy peculiar care,\n  Swell his bold heart, and urge his strength to war:\n  Let Ilion conquer, till the Achaian train\n  Fly to their ships and Hellespont again:\n  Then Greece shall breathe from toils.\" The godhead said;\n  His will divine the son of Jove obey'd.\n  Not half so swift the sailing falcon flies,\n  That drives a turtle through the liquid skies,\n  As Phoebus, shooting from the Idaean brow,\n  Glides down the mountain to the plain below.\n  There Hector seated by the stream he sees,\n  His sense returning with the coming breeze;\n  Again his pulses beat, his spirits rise;\n  Again his loved companions meet his eyes;\n  Jove thinking of his pains, they pass'd away,\n  To whom the god who gives the golden day:\n\n  \"Why sits great Hector from the field so far?\n  What grief, what wound, withholds thee from the war?\"\n\n  The fainting hero, as the vision bright\n  Stood shining o'er him, half unseal'd his sight:\n\n  \"What blest immortal, with commanding breath,\n  Thus wakens Hector from the sleep of death?\n  Has fame not told, how, while my trusty sword\n  Bathed Greece in slaughter, and her battle gored,\n  The mighty Ajax with a deadly blow\n  Had almost sunk me to the shades below?\n  Even yet, methinks, the gliding ghosts I spy,\n  And hell's black horrors swim before my eye.\"\n\n  To him Apollo: \"Be no more dismay'd;\n  See, and be strong! the Thunderer sends thee aid.\n  Behold! thy Phoebus shall his arms employ,\n  Phoebus, propitious still to thee and Troy.\n  Inspire thy warriors then with manly force,\n  And to the ships impel thy rapid horse:\n  Even I will make thy fiery coursers way,\n  And drive the Grecians headlong to the sea.\"\n\n  Thus to bold Hector spoke the son of Jove,\n  And breathed immortal ardour from above.\n  As when the pamper'd steed, with reins unbound,\n  Breaks from his stall, and pours along the ground;\n  With ample strokes he rushes to the flood,\n  To bathe his sides, and cool his fiery blood;\n  His head, now freed, he tosses to the skies;\n  His mane dishevell'd o'er his shoulders flies:\n  He snuffs the females in the well-known plain,\n  And springs, exulting, to his fields again:\n  Urged by the voice divine, thus Hector flew,\n  Full of the god; and all his hosts pursue.\n  As when the force of men and dogs combined\n  Invade the mountain goat, or branching hind;\n  Far from the hunter's rage secure they lie\n  Close in the rock, (not fated yet to die)\n  When lo! a lion shoots across the way!\n  They fly: at once the chasers and the prey.\n  So Greece, that late in conquering troops pursued,\n  And mark'd their progress through the ranks in blood,\n  Soon as they see the furious chief appear,\n  Forget to vanquish, and consent to fear.\n\n  Thoas with grief observed his dreadful course,\n  Thoas, the bravest of the AEtolian force;\n  Skill'd to direct the javelin's distant flight,\n  And bold to combat in the standing fight,\n  Not more in councils famed for solid sense,\n  Than winning words and heavenly eloquence.\n  \"Gods! what portent (he cried) these eyes invades?\n  Lo! Hector rises from the Stygian shades!\n  We saw him, late, by thundering Ajax kill'd:\n  What god restores him to the frighted field;\n  And not content that half of Greece lie slain,\n  Pours new destruction on her sons again?\n  He comes not, Jove! without thy powerful will;\n  Lo! still he lives, pursues, and conquers still!\n  Yet hear my counsel, and his worst withstand:\n  The Greeks' main body to the fleet command;\n  But let the few whom brisker spirits warm,\n  Stand the first onset, and provoke the storm.\n  Thus point your arms; and when such foes appear,\n  Fierce as he is, let Hector learn to fear.\"\n\n  The warrior spoke; the listening Greeks obey,\n  Thickening their ranks, and form a deep array.\n\n  Each Ajax, Teucer, Merion gave command,\n  The valiant leader of the Cretan band;\n  And Mars-like Meges: these the chiefs excite,\n  Approach the foe, and meet the coming fight.\n  Behind, unnumber'd multitudes attend,\n  To flank the navy, and the shores defend.\n  Full on the front the pressing Trojans bear,\n  And Hector first came towering to the war.\n  Phoebus himself the rushing battle led;\n  A veil of clouds involved his radiant head:\n  High held before him, Jove's enormous shield\n  Portentous shone, and shaded all the field;\n  Vulcan to Jove the immortal gift consign'd,\n  To scatter hosts and terrify mankind,\n  The Greeks expect the shock, the clamours rise\n  From different parts, and mingle in the skies.\n  Dire was the hiss of darts, by heroes flung,\n  And arrows leaping from the bow-string sung;\n  These drink the life of generous warriors slain:\n  Those guiltless fall, and thirst for blood in vain.\n  As long as Phoebus bore unmoved the shield,\n  Sat doubtful conquest hovering o'er the field;\n  But when aloft he shakes it in the skies,\n  Shouts in their ears, and lightens in their eyes,\n  Deep horror seizes every Grecian breast,\n  Their force is humbled, and their fear confess'd.\n  So flies a herd of oxen, scatter'd wide,\n  No swain to guard them, and no day to guide,\n  When two fell lions from the mountain come,\n  And spread the carnage through the shady gloom.\n  Impending Phoebus pours around them fear,\n  And Troy and Hector thunder in the rear.\n  Heaps fall on heaps: the slaughter Hector leads,\n  First great Arcesilas, then Stichius bleeds;\n  One to the bold Boeotians ever dear,\n  And one Menestheus' friend and famed compeer.\n  Medon and Iasus, AEneas sped;\n  This sprang from Phelus, and the Athenians led;\n  But hapless Medon from Oileus came;\n  Him Ajax honour'd with a brother's name,\n  Though born of lawless love: from home expell'd,\n  A banish'd man, in Phylace he dwell'd,\n  Press'd by the vengeance of an angry wife;\n  Troy ends at last his labours and his life.\n  Mecystes next Polydamas o'erthrew;\n  And thee, brave Clonius, great Agenor slew.\n  By Paris, Deiochus inglorious dies,\n  Pierced through the shoulder as he basely flies.\n  Polites' arm laid Echius on the plain;\n  Stretch'd on one heap, the victors spoil the slain.\n  The Greeks dismay'd, confused, disperse or fall,\n  Some seek the trench, some skulk behind the wall.\n  While these fly trembling, others pant for breath,\n  And o'er the slaughter stalks gigantic death.\n  On rush'd bold Hector, gloomy as the night;\n  Forbids to plunder, animates the fight,\n  Points to the fleet: \"For, by the gods! who flies,(240)\n  Who dares but linger, by this hand he dies;\n  No weeping sister his cold eye shall close,\n  No friendly hand his funeral pyre compose.\n  Who stops to plunder at this signal hour,\n  The birds shall tear him, and the dogs devour.\"\n  Furious he said; the smarting scourge resounds;\n  The coursers fly; the smoking chariot bounds;\n  The hosts rush on; loud clamours shake the shore;\n  The horses thunder, earth and ocean roar!\n  Apollo, planted at the trench's bound,\n  Push'd at the bank: down sank the enormous mound:\n  Roll'd in the ditch the heapy ruin lay;\n  A sudden road! a long and ample way.\n  O'er the dread fosse (a late impervious space)\n  Now steeds, and men, and cars tumultuous pass.\n  The wondering crowds the downward level trod;\n  Before them flamed the shield, and march'd the god.\n  Then with his hand he shook the mighty wall;\n  And lo! the turrets nod, the bulwarks fall:\n  Easy as when ashore an infant stands,\n  And draws imagined houses in the sands;\n  The sportive wanton, pleased with some new play,\n  Sweeps the slight works and fashion'd domes away:\n  Thus vanish'd at thy touch, the towers and walls;\n  The toil of thousands in a moment falls.\n\n  The Grecians gaze around with wild despair,\n  Confused, and weary all the powers with prayer:\n  Exhort their men, with praises, threats, commands;\n  And urge the gods, with voices, eyes, and hands.\n  Experienced Nestor chief obtests the skies,\n  And weeps his country with a father's eyes.\n\n  \"O Jove! if ever, on his native shore,\n  One Greek enrich'd thy shrine with offer'd gore;\n  If e'er, in hope our country to behold,\n  We paid the fattest firstlings of the fold;\n  If e'er thou sign'st our wishes with thy nod:\n  Perform the promise of a gracious god!\n  This day preserve our navies from the flame,\n  And save the relics of the Grecian name.\"\n\n  Thus prayed the sage: the eternal gave consent,\n  And peals of thunder shook the firmament.\n  Presumptuous Troy mistook the accepting sign,\n  And catch'd new fury at the voice divine.\n  As, when black tempests mix the seas and skies,\n  The roaring deeps in watery mountains rise,\n  Above the sides of some tall ship ascend,\n  Its womb they deluge, and its ribs they rend:\n  Thus loudly roaring, and o'erpowering all,\n  Mount the thick Trojans up the Grecian wall;\n  Legions on legions from each side arise:\n  Thick sound the keels; the storm of arrows flies.\n  Fierce on the ships above, the cars below,\n  These wield the mace, and those the javelin throw.\n\n  While thus the thunder of the battle raged,\n  And labouring armies round the works engaged,\n  Still in the tent Patroclus sat to tend\n  The good Eurypylus, his wounded friend.\n  He sprinkles healing balms, to anguish kind,\n  And adds discourse, the medicine of the mind.\n  But when he saw, ascending up the fleet,\n  Victorious Troy; then, starting from his seat,\n  With bitter groans his sorrows he express'd,\n  He wrings his hands, he beats his manly breast.\n  \"Though yet thy state require redress (he cries)\n  Depart I must: what horrors strike my eyes!\n  Charged with Achilles' high command I go,\n  A mournful witness of this scene of woe;\n  I haste to urge him by his country's care\n  To rise in arms, and shine again in war.\n  Perhaps some favouring god his soul may bend;\n  The voice is powerful of a faithful friend.\"\n\n  He spoke; and, speaking, swifter than the wind\n  Sprung from the tent, and left the war behind.\n  The embodied Greeks the fierce attack sustain,\n  But strive, though numerous, to repulse in vain:\n  Nor could the Trojans, through that firm array,\n  Force to the fleet and tents the impervious way.\n  As when a shipwright, with Palladian art,\n  Smooths the rough wood, and levels every part;\n  With equal hand he guides his whole design,\n  By the just rule, and the directing line:\n  The martial leaders, with like skill and care,\n  Preserved their line, and equal kept the war.\n  Brave deeds of arms through all the ranks were tried,\n  And every ship sustained an equal tide.\n  At one proud bark, high-towering o'er the fleet,\n  Ajax the great, and godlike Hector meet;\n  For one bright prize the matchless chiefs contend,\n  Nor this the ships can fire, nor that defend:\n  One kept the shore, and one the vessel trod;\n  That fix'd as fate, this acted by a god.\n  The son of Clytius in his daring hand,\n  The deck approaching, shakes a flaming brand;\n  But, pierced by Telamon's huge lance, expires:\n  Thundering he falls, and drops the extinguish'd fires.\n  Great Hector view'd him with a sad survey,\n  As stretch'd in dust before the stern he lay.\n  \"Oh! all of Trojan, all of Lycian race!\n  Stand to your arms, maintain this arduous space:\n  Lo! where the son of royal Clytius lies;\n  Ah, save his arms, secure his obsequies!\"\n\n  This said, his eager javelin sought the foe:\n  But Ajax shunn'd the meditated blow.\n  Not vainly yet the forceful lance was thrown;\n  It stretch'd in dust unhappy Lycophron:\n  An exile long, sustain'd at Ajax' board,\n  A faithful servant to a foreign lord;\n  In peace, and war, for ever at his side,\n  Near his loved master, as he lived, he died.\n  From the high poop he tumbles on the sand,\n  And lies a lifeless load along the land.\n  With anguish Ajax views the piercing sight,\n  And thus inflames his brother to the fight:\n\n  \"Teucer, behold!

had renown'd that day.\n  But Hector was not doom'd to perish then:\n  The all-wise disposer of the fates of men\n  (Imperial Jove) his present death withstands;\n  Nor was such glory due to Teucer's hands.\n  At its full stretch as the tough string he drew,\n  Struck by an arm unseen, it burst in two;\n  Down dropp'd the bow: the shaft with brazen head\n  Fell innocent, and on the dust lay dead.\n  The astonish'd archer to great Ajax cries;\n  \"Some god prevents our destined enterprise:\n  Some god, propitious to the Trojan foe,\n  Has, from my arm unfailing, struck the bow,\n  And broke the nerve my hands had twined with art,\n  Strong to impel the flight of many a dart.\"\n\n  \"Since heaven commands it (Ajax made reply)\n  Dismiss the bow, and lay thy arrows by:\n  Thy arms no less suffice the lance to wield,\n  And quit the quiver for the ponderous shield.\n  In the first ranks indulge thy thirst of fame,\n  Thy brave example shall the rest inflame.\n  Fierce as they are, by long successes vain;\n  To force our fleet, or even a ship to gain,\n  Asks toil, and sweat, and blood: their utmost might\n  Shall find its match--No more: 'tis ours to fight.\"\n\n  Then Teucer laid his faithless bow aside;\n  The fourfold buckler o'er his shoulder tied;\n  On his brave head a crested helm he placed,\n  With nodding horse-hair formidably graced;\n  A dart, whose point with brass refulgent shines,\n  The warrior wields; and his great brother joins.\n\n  This Hector saw, and thus express'd his joy:\n  \"Ye troops of Lycia, Dardanus, and Troy!\n  Be mindful of yourselves, your ancient fame,\n  And spread your glory with the navy's flame.\n  Jove is with us; I saw his hand, but now,\n  From the proud archer strike his vaunted bow:\n  Indulgent Jove!

was thy care)\n  But Croesmus' bosom took the flying spear:\n  His corpse fell bleeding on the slippery shore;\n  His radiant arms triumphant Meges bore.\n  Dolops, the son of Lampus, rushes on,\n  Sprung from the race of old Laomedon,\n  And famed for prowess in a well-fought field,\n  He pierced the centre of his sounding shield:\n  But Meges, Phyleus' ample breastplate wore,\n  (Well-known in fight on Selle's winding shore;\n  For king Euphetes gave the golden mail,\n  Compact, and firm with many a jointed scale)\n  Which oft, in cities storm'd, and battles won,\n  Had saved the father, and now saves the son.\n  Full at the Trojan's head he urged his lance,\n  Where the high plumes above the helmet dance,\n  New ting'd with Tyrian dye: in dust below,\n  Shorn from the crest, the purple honours glow.\n  Meantime their fight the Spartan king survey'd,\n  And stood by Meges' side a sudden aid.\n  Through Dolops' shoulder urged his forceful dart,\n  Which held its passage through the panting heart,\n  And issued at his breast. With thundering sound\n  The warrior falls, extended on the ground.\n  In rush the conquering Greeks to spoil the slain:\n  But Hector's voice excites his kindred train;\n  The hero most, from Hicetaon sprung,\n  Fierce Melanippus, gallant, brave, and young.\n  He (ere to Troy the Grecians cross'd the main)\n  Fed his large oxen on Percote's plain;\n  But when oppress'd, his country claim'd his care,\n  Return'd to Ilion, and excell'd in war;\n  For this, in Priam's court, he held his place,\n  Beloved no less than Priam's royal race.\n  Him Hector singled, as his troops he led,\n  And thus inflamed him, pointing to the dead.\n\n  \"Lo, Melanippus! lo, where Dolops lies;\n  And is it thus our royal kinsman dies?\n  O'ermatch'd he falls; to two at once a prey,\n  And lo! they bear the bloody arms away!\n  Come on--a distant war no longer wage,\n  But hand to hand thy country's foes engage:\n  Till Greece at once, and all her glory end;\n  Or Ilion from her towery height descend,\n  Heaved from the lowest stone; and bury all\n  In one sad sepulchre, one common fall.\"\n\n  Hector (this said) rush'd forward on the foes:\n  With equal ardour Melanippus glows:\n  Then Ajax thus--\"O Greeks!

for his fate was near,\n  Due to stern Pallas, and Pelides' spear:\n  Yet Jove deferr'd the death he was to pay,\n  And gave what fate allow'd, the honours of a day!\n\n  Now all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes\n  Burn at each foe, and single every prize;\n  Still at the closest ranks, the thickest fight,\n  He points his ardour, and exerts his might.\n  The Grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower,\n  On all sides batter'd, yet resists his power:\n  So some tall rock o'erhangs the hoary main,(241)\n  By winds assail'd, by billows beat in vain,\n  Unmoved it hears, above, the tempest blow,\n  And sees the watery mountains break below.\n  Girt in surrounding flames, he seems to fall\n  Like fire from Jove, and bursts upon them all:\n  Bursts as a wave that from the cloud impends,\n  And, swell'd with tempests, on the ship descends;\n  White are the decks with foam; the winds aloud\n  Howl o'er the masts, and sing through every shroud:\n  Pale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears;\n  And instant death on every wave appears.\n  So pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meet,\n  The chief so thunders, and so shakes the fleet.\n\n  As when a lion, rushing from his den,\n  Amidst the plain of some wide-water'd fen,\n  (Where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed,\n  At large expatiate o'er the ranker mead)\n  Leaps on the herds before the herdsman's eyes;\n  The trembling herdsman far to distance flies;\n  Some lordly bull (the rest dispersed and fled)\n  He singles out; arrests, and lays him dead.\n  Thus from the rage of Jove-like Hector flew\n  All Greece in heaps; but one he seized, and slew:\n  Mycenian Periphes, a mighty name,\n  In wisdom great, in arms well known to fame;\n  The minister of stern Eurystheus' ire\n  Against Alcides, Copreus was his sire:\n  The son redeem'd the honours of the race,\n  A son as generous as the sire was base;\n  O'er all his country's youth conspicuous far\n  In every virtue, or of peace or war:\n  But doom'd to Hector's stronger force to yield!\n  Against the margin of his ample shield\n  He struck his hasty foot: his heels up-sprung;\n  Supine he fell; his brazen helmet rung.\n  On the fallen chief the invading Trojan press'd,\n  And plunged the pointed javelin in his breast.\n  His circling friends, who strove to guard too late\n  The unhappy hero, fled, or shared his fate.\n\n  Chased from the foremost line, the Grecian train\n  Now man the next, receding toward the main:\n  Wedged in one body at the tents they stand,\n  Wall'd round with sterns, a gloomy, desperate band.\n  Now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight;\n  Now fear itself confines them to the fight:\n  Man courage breathes in man; but Nestor most\n  (The sage preserver of the Grecian host)\n  Exhorts, adjures, to guard these utmost shores;\n  And by their parents, by themselves implores.\n\n  \"Oh friends!

He agrees to it, but at the same time charges\nhim to content himself with rescuing the fleet, without further pursuit of\nthe enemy. The armour, horses, soldiers, and officers are described.\nAchilles offers a libation for the success of his friend, after which\nPatroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle. The Trojans, at the sight of\nPatroclus in Achilles' armour, taking him for that hero, are cast into the\nuttermost consternation; he beats them off from the vessels, Hector\nhimself flies, Sarpedon is killed, though Jupiter was averse to his fate.\nSeveral other particulars of the battle are described; in the heat of\nwhich, Patroclus, neglecting the orders of Achilles, pursues the foe to\nthe walls of Troy, where Apollo repulses and disarms him, Euphorbus wounds\nhim, and Hector kills him, which concludes the book.\n\n  So warr'd both armies on the ensanguined shore,\n  While the black vessels smoked with human gore.\n  Meantime Patroclus to Achilles flies;\n  The streaming tears fall copious from his eyes\n  Not faster, trickling to the plains below,\n  From the tall rock the sable waters flow.\n  Divine Pelides, with compassion moved.\n  Thus spoke, indulgent, to his best beloved:(243)\n\n  \"Patroclus, say, what grief thy bosom bears,\n  That flows so fast in these unmanly tears?\n  No girl, no infant whom the mother keeps\n  From her loved breast, with fonder passion weeps;\n  Not more the mother's soul, that infant warms,\n  Clung to her knees, and reaching at her arms,\n  Than thou hast mine!

Next, Thoas was thy chance;\n  Thy breast, unarm'd, received the Spartan lance.\n  Phylides' dart (as Amphidus drew nigh)\n  His blow prevented, and transpierced his thigh,\n  Tore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away;\n  In darkness, and in death, the warrior lay.\n\n  In equal arms two sons of Nestor stand,\n  And two bold brothers of the Lycian band:\n  By great Antilochus, Atymnius dies,\n  Pierced in the flank, lamented youth! he lies,\n  Kind Maris, bleeding in his brother's wound,\n  Defends the breathless carcase on the ground;\n  Furious he flies, his murderer to engage:\n  But godlike Thrasimed prevents his rage,\n  Between his arm and shoulder aims a blow;\n  His arm falls spouting on the dust below:\n  He sinks, with endless darkness cover'd o'er:\n  And vents his soul, effused with gushing gore.\n\n  Slain by two brothers, thus two brothers bleed,\n  Sarpedon's friends, Amisodarus' seed;\n  Amisodarus, who, by Furies led,\n  The bane of men, abhorr'd Chimaera bred;\n  Skill'd in the dart in vain, his sons expire,\n  And pay the forfeit of their guilty sire.\n\n  Stopp'd in the tumult Cleobulus lies,\n  Beneath Oileus' arm, a living prize;\n  A living prize not long the Trojan stood;\n  The thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood:\n  Plunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies;\n  Black death, and fate unpitying, seal his eyes.\n\n  Amid the ranks, with mutual thirst of fame,\n  Lycon the brave, and fierce Peneleus came;\n  In vain their javelins at each other flew,\n  Now, met in arms, their eager swords they drew.\n  On the plumed crest of his Boeotian foe\n  The daring Lycon aim'd a noble blow;\n  The sword broke short;

Hector flies,\n  Patroclus shakes his lance; but fate denies.\n  Not with less noise, with less impetuous force,\n  The tide of Trojans urge their desperate course,\n  Than when in autumn Jove his fury pours,\n  And earth is loaden with incessant showers;\n  (When guilty mortals break the eternal laws,\n  Or judges, bribed, betray the righteous cause;)\n  From their deep beds he bids the rivers rise,\n  And opens all the flood-gates of the skies:\n  The impetuous torrents from their hills obey,\n  Whole fields are drown'd, and mountains swept away;\n  Loud roars the deluge till it meets the main;\n  And trembling man sees all his labours vain!\n\n  And now the chief (the foremost troops repell'd)\n  Back to the ships his destined progress held,\n  Bore down half Troy in his resistless way,\n  And forced the routed ranks to stand the day.\n  Between the space where silver Simois flows,\n  Where lay the fleets, and where the rampires rose,\n  All grim in dust and blood Patroclus stands,\n  And turns the slaughter on the conquering bands.\n  First Pronous died beneath his fiery dart,\n  Which pierced below the shield his valiant heart.\n  Thestor was next, who saw the chief appear,\n  And fell the victim of his coward fear;\n  Shrunk up he sat, with wild and haggard eye,\n  Nor stood to combat, nor had force to fly;\n  Patroclus mark'd him as he shunn'd the war,\n  And with unmanly tremblings shook the car,\n  And dropp'd the flowing reins. Him 'twixt the jaws,\n  The javelin sticks, and from the chariot draws.\n  As on a rock that overhangs the main,\n  An angler, studious of the line and cane,\n  Some mighty fish draws panting to the shore:\n  Not with less ease the barbed javelin bore\n  The gaping dastard; as the spear was shook,\n  He fell, and life his heartless breast forsook.\n\n  Next on Eryalus he flies; a stone,\n  Large as a rock, was by his fury thrown:\n  Full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew,\n  And burst the helm, and cleft the head in two:\n  Prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell,\n  And death involved him with the shades of hell.\n  Then low in dust Epaltes, Echius, lie;\n  Ipheas, Evippus, Polymelus, die;\n  Amphoterus and Erymas succeed;\n  And last Tlepolemus and Pyres bleed.\n  Where'er he moves, the growing slaughters spread\n  In heaps on heaps a monument of dead.\n\n  When now Sarpedon his brave friends beheld\n  Grovelling in dust, and gasping on the field,\n  With this reproach his flying host he warms:\n  \"Oh stain to honour! oh disgrace to arms!\n  Forsake, inglorious, the contended plain;\n  This hand unaided shall the war sustain:\n  The task be mine this hero's strength to try,\n  Who mows whole troops, and makes an army fly.\"\n\n  He spake: and, speaking, leaps from off the car:\n  Patroclus lights, and sternly waits the war.\n  As when two vultures on the mountain's height\n  Stoop with resounding pinions to the fight;\n  They cuff, they tear, they raise a screaming cry;\n  The desert echoes, and the rocks reply:\n  The warriors thus opposed in arms, engage\n  With equal clamours, and with equal rage.\n\n  Jove view'd the combat: whose event foreseen,\n  He thus bespoke his sister and his queen:\n  \"The hour draws on; the destinies ordain,(245)\n  My godlike son shall press the Phrygian plain:\n  Already on the verge of death he stands,\n  His life is owed to fierce Patroclus' hands,\n  What passions in a parent's breast debate!\n  Say, shall I snatch him from impending fate,\n  And send him safe to Lycia, distant far\n  From all the dangers and the toils of war;\n  Or to his doom my bravest offspring yield,\n  And fatten, with celestial blood, the field?\"\n\n  Then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes:\n  \"What words are these, O sovereign of the skies!\n  Short is the date prescribed to mortal man;\n  Shall Jove for one extend the narrow span,\n  Whose bounds were fix'd before his race began?\n  How many sons of gods, foredoom'd to death,\n  Before proud Ilion must resign their breath!\n  Were thine exempt, debate would rise above,\n  And murmuring powers condemn their partial Jove.\n  Give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight;\n  And when the ascending soul has wing'd her flight,\n  Let Sleep and Death convey, by thy command,\n  The breathless body to his native land.\n  His friends and people, to his future praise,\n  A marble tomb and pyramid shall raise,\n  And lasting honours to his ashes give;\n  His fame ('tis all the dead can have) shall live.\"\n\n  She said: the cloud-compeller, overcome,\n  Assents to fate, and ratifies the doom.\n  Then touch'd with grief, the weeping heavens distill'd\n  A shower of blood o'er all the fatal field:\n  The god, his eyes averting from the plain,\n  Laments his son, predestined to be slain,\n  Far from the Lycian shores, his happy native reign.\n  Now met in arms, the combatants appear;\n  Each heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear;\n  From strong Patroclus' hand the javelin fled,\n  And pass'd the groin of valiant Thrasymed;\n  The nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain,\n  He falls, and falling bites the bloody plain.\n  Two sounding darts the Lycian leader threw:\n  The first aloof with erring fury flew,\n  The next transpierced Achilles' mortal steed,\n  The generous Pedasus of Theban breed:\n  Fix'd in the shoulder's joint, he reel'd around,\n  Roll'd in the bloody dust, and paw'd the slippery ground.\n  His sudden fall the entangled harness broke;\n  Each axle crackled, and the chariot shook:\n  When bold Automedon, to disengage\n  The starting coursers, and restrain their rage,\n  Divides the traces with his sword, and freed\n  The encumbered chariot from the dying steed:\n  The rest move on, obedient to the rein:\n  The car rolls slowly o'er the dusty plain.\n\n  The towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance:\n  And first Sarpedon whirl'd his weighty lance,\n  Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,\n  And spent in empty air its dying force.\n  Not so Patroclus' never-erring dart;\n  Aim'd at his breast it pierced a mortal part,\n  Where the strong fibres bind the solid heart.\n  Then as the mountain oak, or poplar tall,\n  Or pine (fit mast for some great admiral)\n  Nods to the axe, till with a groaning sound\n  It sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground,\n  Thus fell the king; and laid on earth supine,\n  Before his chariot stretch'd his form divine:\n  He grasp'd the dust distain'd with streaming gore,\n  And, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore.\n  So lies a bull beneath the lion's paws,\n  While the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws\n  The trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood;\n  Deep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood.\n\n  Then to the leader of the Lycian band\n  The dying chief address'd his last command;\n  \"Glaucus, be bold; thy task be first to dare\n  The glorious dangers of destructive war,\n  To lead my troops, to combat at their head,\n  Incite the living, and supply the dead.\n  Tell them, I charged them with my latest breath\n  Not unrevenged to bear Sarpedon's death.\n  What grief, what shame, must Glaucus undergo,\n  If these spoil'd arms adorn a Grecian foe!\n  Then as a friend, and as a warrior fight;\n  Defend my body, conquer in my right:\n  That, taught by great examples, all may try\n  Like thee to vanquish, or like me to die.\"\n  He ceased; the Fates suppress'd his labouring breath,\n  And his eyes darken'd with the shades of death.\n  The insulting victor with disdain bestrode\n  The prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod;\n  Then drew the weapon from his panting heart,\n  The reeking fibres clinging to the dart;\n  From the wide wound gush'd out a stream of blood,\n  And the soul issued in the purple flood.\n  His flying steeds the Myrmidons detain,\n  Unguided now, their mighty master slain.\n  All-impotent of aid, transfix'd with grief,\n  Unhappy Glaucus heard the dying chief:\n  His painful arm, yet useless with the smart\n  Inflicted late by Teucer's deadly dart,\n  Supported on his better hand he stay'd:\n  To Phoebus then ('twas all he could) he pray'd:\n\n  \"All-seeing monarch! whether Lycia's coast,\n  Or sacred Ilion, thy bright presence boast,\n  Powerful alike to ease the wretch's smart;\n  O hear me! god of every healing art!\n  Lo! stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain,\n  That thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein,\n  I stand unable to sustain the spear,\n  And sigh, at distance from the glorious war.\n  Low in the dust is great Sarpedon laid,\n  Nor Jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid;\n  But thou, O god of health! thy succour lend,\n  To guard the relics of my slaughter'd friend:\n  For thou, though distant, canst restore my might,\n  To head my Lycians, and support the fight.\"\n\n  Apollo heard; and, suppliant as he stood,\n  His heavenly hand restrain'd the flux of blood;\n  He drew the dolours from the wounded part,\n  And breathed a spirit in his rising heart.\n  Renew'd by art divine, the hero stands,\n  And owns the assistance of immortal hands.\n  First to the fight his native troops he warms,\n  Then loudly calls on Troy's vindictive arms;\n  With ample strides he stalks from place to place;\n  Now fires Agenor, now Polydamas:\n  AEneas next, and Hector he accosts;\n  Inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts.\n\n  \"What thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ?\n  Oh too forgetful of the friends of Troy!\n  Those generous friends, who, from their country far,\n  Breathe their brave souls out in another's war.\n  See! where in dust the great Sarpedon lies,\n  In action valiant, and in council wise,\n  Who guarded right, and kept his people free;\n  To all his Lycians lost, and lost to thee!\n  Stretch'd by Patroclus' arm on yonder plains,\n  O save from hostile rage his loved remains!\n  Ah let not Greece his conquer'd trophies boast,\n  Nor on his corse revenge her heroes lost!\"\n\n  He spoke: each leader in his grief partook:\n  Troy, at the loss, through all her legions shook.\n  Transfix'd with deep regret, they view o'erthrown\n  At once his country's pillar, and their own;\n  A chief, who led to Troy's beleaguer'd wall\n  A host of heroes, and outshined them all.\n  Fired, they rush on; first Hector seeks the foes,\n  And with superior vengeance greatly glows.\n\n  But o'er the dead the fierce Patroclus stands,\n  And rousing Ajax, roused the listening bands:\n\n  \"Heroes, be men; be what you were before;\n  Or weigh the great occasion, and be more.\n  The chief who taught our lofty walls to yield,\n  Lies pale in death, extended on the field.\n  To guard his body Troy in numbers flies;\n  Tis half the glory to maintain our prize.\n  Haste, strip his arms, the slaughter round him spread,\n  And send the living Lycians to the dead.\"\n\n  The heroes kindle at his fierce command;\n  The martial squadrons close on either hand:\n  Here Troy and Lycia charge with loud alarms,\n  Thessalia there, and Greece, oppose their arms.\n  With horrid shouts they circle round the slain;\n  The clash of armour rings o'er all the plain.\n  Great Jove, to swell the horrors of the fight,\n  O'er the fierce armies pours pernicious night,\n  And round his son confounds the warring hosts,\n  His fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts.\n\n  Now Greece gives way, and great Epigeus falls;\n  Agacleus' son, from Budium's lofty walls;\n  Who chased for murder thence a suppliant came\n  To Peleus, and the silver-footed dame;\n  Now sent to Troy, Achilles' arms to aid,\n  He pays due vengeance to his kinsman's shade.\n  Soon as his luckless hand had touch'd the dead,\n  A rock's large fragment thunder'd on his head;\n  Hurl'd by Hectorean force it cleft in twain\n  His shatter'd helm, and stretch'd him o'er the slain.\n\n  Fierce to the van of fight Patroclus came,\n  And, like an eagle darting at his game,\n  Sprung on the Trojan and the Lycian band.\n  What grief thy heart, what fury urged thy hand,\n  O generous Greek! when with full vigour thrown,\n  At Sthenelaus flew the weighty stone,\n  Which sunk him to the dead: when Troy, too near\n  That arm, drew back; and Hector learn'd to fear.\n  Far as an able hand a lance can throw,\n  Or at the lists, or at the fighting foe;\n  So far the Trojans from their lines retired;\n  Till Glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired.\n  Then Bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage,\n  The only hope of Chalcon's trembling age;\n  Wide o'er the land was stretch'd his large domain,\n  With stately seats, and riches blest in vain:\n  Him, bold with youth, and eager to pursue\n  The flying Lycians, Glaucus met and slew;\n  Pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound,\n  He fell, and falling made the fields resound.\n  The Achaians sorrow for their heroes slain;\n  With conquering shouts the Trojans shake the plain,\n  And crowd to spoil the dead: the Greeks oppose;\n  An iron circle round the carcase grows.\n\n  Then brave Laogonus resign'd his breath,\n  Despatch'd by Merion to the shades of death:\n  On Ida's holy hill he made abode,\n  The priest of Jove, and honour'd like his god.\n  Between the jaw and ear the javelin went;\n  The soul, exhaling, issued at the vent.\n  His spear Aeneas at the victor threw,\n  Who stooping forward from the death withdrew;\n  The lance hiss'd harmless o'er his covering shield,\n  And trembling struck, and rooted in the field;\n  There yet scarce spent, it quivers on the plain,\n  Sent by the great Aeneas' arm in vain.\n  \"Swift as thou art (the raging hero cries)\n  And skill'd in dancing to dispute the prize,\n  My spear, the destined passage had it found,\n  Had fix'd thy active vigour to the ground.\"\n\n  \"O valiant leader of the Dardan host!\n  (Insulted Merion thus retorts the boast)\n  Strong as you are, 'tis mortal force you trust,\n  An arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust.\n  And if to this my lance thy fate be given,\n  Vain are thy vaunts;

and, that his last of days\n  Shall set in glory, bids him drive the foe;\n  Nor unattended see the shades below.\n  Then Hector's mind he fills with dire dismay;\n  He mounts his car, and calls his hosts away;\n  Sunk with Troy's heavy fates, he sees decline\n  The scales of Jove, and pants with awe divine.\n\n  Then, nor before, the hardy Lycians fled,\n  And left their monarch with the common dead:\n  Around, in heaps on heaps, a dreadful wall\n  Of carnage rises, as the heroes fall.\n  (So Jove decreed!) At length the Greeks obtain\n  The prize contested, and despoil the slain.\n  The radiant arms are by Patroclus borne;\n  Patroclus' ships the glorious spoils adorn.\n\n  Then thus to Phoebus, in the realms above,\n  Spoke from his throne the cloud-compelling Jove:\n  \"Descend, my Phoebus!

cease; this heaven-defended wall\n  Defies thy lance; not fated yet to fall;\n  Thy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand,\n  Troy shall not stoop even to Achilles' hand.\"\n\n  So spoke the god who darts celestial fires;\n  The Greek obeys him, and with awe retires.\n  While Hector, checking at the Scaean gates\n  His panting coursers, in his breast debates,\n  Or in the field his forces to employ,\n  Or draw the troops within the walls of Troy.\n  Thus while he thought, beside him Phoebus stood,\n  In Asius' shape, who reigned by Sangar's flood;\n  (Thy brother, Hecuba!

what active feats yon artist shows!\n  What skilful divers are our Phrygian foes!\n  Mark with what ease they sink into the sand!\n  Pity that all their practice is by land!\"\n\n  Then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize,\n  To spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies:\n  Swift as a lion, terrible and bold,\n  That sweeps the field, depopulates the fold;\n  Pierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain,\n  And from his fatal courage finds his bane.\n  At once bold Hector leaping from his car,\n  Defends the body, and provokes the war.\n  Thus for some slaughter'd hind, with equal rage,\n  Two lordly rulers of the wood engage;\n  Stung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,\n  And echoing roars rebellow through the shades.\n  Stern Hector fastens on the warrior's head,\n  And by the foot Patroclus drags the dead:\n  While all around, confusion, rage, and fright,\n  Mix the contending hosts in mortal fight.\n  So pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud\n  In the deep bosom of some gloomy wood;\n  Leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,\n  The broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan;\n  This way and that, the rattling thicket bends,\n  And the whole forest in one crash descends.\n  Not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,\n  In dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.\n  Darts shower'd on darts, now round the carcase ring;\n  Now flights of arrows bounding from the string:\n  Stones follow stones; some clatter on the fields,\n  Some hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.\n  But where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,\n  Sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains,\n  And, stretch'd in death, forgets the guiding reins!\n\n  Now flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven\n  His fervid orb through half the vault of heaven;\n  While on each host with equal tempests fell\n  The showering darts, and numbers sank to hell.\n  But when his evening wheels o'erhung the main,\n  Glad conquest rested on the Grecian train.\n  Then from amidst the tumult and alarms,\n  They draw the conquer'd corse and radiant arms.\n  Then rash Patroclus with new fury glows,\n  And breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes.\n  Thrice on the press like Mars himself he flew,\n  And thrice three heroes at each onset slew.\n  There ends thy glory!

and with thee, the joy\n  Thy pride once promised, of subverting Troy;\n  The fancied scenes of Ilion wrapt in flames,\n  And thy soft pleasures served with captive dames.\n  Unthinking man! I fought those towers to free,\n  And guard that beauteous race from lords like thee:\n  But thou a prey to vultures shalt be made;\n  Thy own Achilles cannot lend thee aid;\n  Though much at parting that great chief might say,\n  And much enjoin thee, this important day.\n\n  'Return not, my brave friend (perhaps he said),\n  Without the bloody arms of Hector dead.'\n  He spoke, Patroclus march'd, and thus he sped.\"\n\n  Supine, and wildly gazing on the skies,\n  With faint, expiring breath, the chief replies:\n\n  \"Vain boaster! cease, and know the powers divine!\n  Jove's and Apollo's is this deed, not thine;\n  To heaven is owed whate'er your own you call,\n  And heaven itself disarm'd me ere my fall.\n  Had twenty mortals, each thy match in might,\n  Opposed me fairly, they had sunk in fight:\n  By fate and Phoebus was I first o'erthrown,\n  Euphorbus next; the third mean part thy own.\n  But thou, imperious! hear my latest breath;\n  The gods inspire it, and it sounds thy death:\n  Insulting man, thou shalt be soon as I;\n  Black fate o'erhangs thee, and thy hour draws nigh;\n  Even now on life's last verge I see thee stand,\n  I see thee fall, and by Achilles' hand.\"\n\n  He faints: the soul unwilling wings her way,\n  (The beauteous body left a load of clay)\n  Flits to the lone, uncomfortable coast;\n  A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!\n\n  Then Hector pausing, as his eyes he fed\n  On the pale carcase, thus address'd the dead:\n\n  \"From whence this boding speech, the stern decree\n  Of death denounced, or why denounced to me?\n  Why not as well Achilles' fate be given\n  To Hector's lance? Who knows the will of heaven?\"\n\n  Pensive he said; then pressing as he lay\n  His breathless bosom, tore the lance away;\n  And upwards cast the corse: the reeking spear\n  He shakes, and charges the bold charioteer.\n  But swift Automedon with loosen'd reins\n  Rapt in the chariot o'er the distant plains,\n  Far from his rage the immortal coursers drove;\n  The immortal coursers were the gift of Jove.\n\n                       [Illustration: AESCULAPIUS.]\n\n                               AESCULAPIUS.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XVII.\n\n\nARGUMENT.\n\nTHE SEVENTH BATTLE, FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS.--THE ACTS OF MENELAUS.\n\nMenelaus, upon the death of Patroclus, defends his body from the enemy:\nEuphorbus, who attempts it, is slain. Hector advancing, Menelaus retires;\nbut soon returns with Ajax, and drives him off. This, Glaucus objects to\nHector as a flight, who thereupon puts on the armour he had won from\nPatroclus, and renews the battle. The Greeks give way, till Ajax rallies\nthem: Aeneas sustains the Trojans. Aeneas and Hector Attempt the chariot\nof Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon. The horses of Achilles\ndeplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers his body with a thick\ndarkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion. Menelaus sends\nAntilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus' death: then returns to\nthe fight, where, though attacked with the utmost fury, he and Meriones,\nassisted by the Ajaces, bear off the body to the ships.\n\nThe time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day. The scene lies in\nthe fields before Troy.\n\n  On the cold earth divine Patroclus spread,\n  Lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.\n  Great Menelaus, touch'd with generous woe,\n  Springs to the front, and guards him from the foe.\n  Thus round her new-fallen young the heifer moves,\n  Fruit of her throes, and first-born of her loves;\n  And anxious (helpless as he lies, and bare)\n  Turns, and re-turns her, with a mother's care,\n  Opposed to each that near the carcase came,\n  His broad shield glimmers, and his lances flame.\n\n  The son of Panthus, skill'd the dart to send,\n  Eyes the dead hero, and insults the friend.\n  \"This hand, Atrides, laid Patroclus low;\n  Warrior! desist, nor tempt an equal blow:\n  To me the spoils my prowess won, resign:\n  Depart with life, and leave the glory mine\"\n\n  The Trojan thus: the Spartan monarch burn'd\n  With generous anguish, and in scorn return'd:\n  \"Laugh'st thou not, Jove! from thy superior throne,\n  When mortals boast of prowess not their own?\n  Not thus the lion glories in his might,\n  Nor panther braves his spotted foe in fight,\n  Nor thus the boar (those terrors of the plain;)\n  Man only vaunts his force, and vaunts in vain.\n  But far the vainest of the boastful kind,\n  These sons of Panthus vent their haughty mind.\n  Yet 'twas but late, beneath my conquering steel\n  This boaster's brother, Hyperenor, fell;\n  Against our arm which rashly he defied,\n  Vain was his vigour, and as vain his pride.\n  These eyes beheld him on the dust expire,\n  No more to cheer his spouse, or glad his sire.\n  Presumptuous youth! like his shall be thy doom,\n  Go, wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom;\n  Or, while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate;\n  Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.\"\n\n  Unmoved, Euphorbus thus: \"That action known,\n  Come, for my brother's blood repay thy own.\n  His weeping father claims thy destined head,\n  And spouse, a widow in her bridal bed.\n  On these thy conquer'd spoils I shall bestow,\n  To soothe a consort's and a parent's woe.\n  No longer then defer the glorious strife,\n  Let heaven decide our fortune, fame, and life.\"\n\n  Swift as the word the missile lance he flings;\n  The well-aim'd weapon on the buckler rings,\n  But blunted by the brass, innoxious falls.\n  On Jove the father great Atrides calls,\n  Nor flies the javelin from his arm in vain,\n  It pierced his throat, and bent him to the plain;\n  Wide through the neck appears the grisly wound,\n  Prone sinks the warrior, and his arms resound.\n  The shining circlets of his golden hair,\n  Which even the Graces might be proud to wear,\n  Instarr'd with gems and gold, bestrow the shore,\n  With dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with gore.\n\n  As the young olive, in some sylvan scene,\n  Crown'd by fresh fountains with eternal green,\n  Lifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair,\n  And plays and dances to the gentle air;\n  When lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invades\n  The tender plant, and withers all its shades;\n  It lies uprooted from its genial bed,\n  A lovely ruin now defaced and dead:\n  Thus young, thus beautiful, Euphorbus lay,\n  While the fierce Spartan tore his arms away.\n  Proud of his deed, and glorious in the prize,\n  Affrighted Troy the towering victor flies:\n  Flies, as before some mountain lion's ire\n  The village curs and trembling swains retire,\n  When o'er the slaughter'd bull they hear him roar,\n  And see his jaws distil with smoking gore:\n  All pale with fear, at distance scatter'd round,\n  They shout incessant, and the vales resound.\n\n  Meanwhile Apollo view'd with envious eyes,\n  And urged great Hector to dispute the prize;\n  (In Mentes' shape, beneath whose martial care\n  The rough Ciconians learn'd the trade of war;)(247)\n  \"Forbear (he cried) with fruitless speed to chase\n  Achilles' coursers, of ethereal race;\n  They stoop not, these, to mortal man's command,\n  Or stoop to none but great Achilles' hand.\n  Too long amused with a pursuit so vain,\n  Turn, and behold the brave Euphorbus slain;\n  By Sparta slain! for ever now suppress'd\n  The fire which burn'd in that undaunted breast!\"\n\n  Thus having spoke, Apollo wing'd his flight,\n  And mix'd with mortals in the toils of fight:\n  His words infix'd unutterable care\n  Deep in great Hector's soul: through all the war\n  He darts his anxious eye; and, instant, view'd\n  The breathless hero in his blood imbued,\n  (Forth welling from the wound, as prone he lay)\n  And in the victor's hands the shining prey.\n  Sheath'd in bright arms, through cleaving ranks he flies,\n  And sends his voice in thunder to the skies:\n  Fierce as a flood of flame by Vulcan sent,\n  It flew, and fired the nations as it went.\n  Atrides from the voice the storm divined,\n  And thus explored his own unconquer'd mind:\n\n  \"Then shall I quit Patroclus on the plain,\n  Slain in my cause, and for my honour slain!\n  Desert the arms, the relics, of my friend?\n  Or singly, Hector and his troops attend?\n  Sure where such partial favour heaven bestow'd,\n  To brave the hero were to brave the god:\n  Forgive me, Greece, if once I quit the field;\n  'Tis not to Hector, but to heaven I yield.\n  Yet, nor the god, nor heaven, should give me fear,\n  Did but the voice of Ajax reach my ear:\n  Still would we turn, still battle on the plains,\n  And give Achilles all that yet remains\n  Of his and our Patroclus--\" This, no more\n  The time allow'd: Troy thicken'd on the shore.\n  A sable scene! The terrors Hector led.\n  Slow he recedes, and sighing quits the dead.\n\n  So from the fold the unwilling lion parts,\n  Forced by loud clamours, and a storm of darts;\n  He flies indeed, but threatens as he flies,\n  With heart indignant and retorted eyes.\n  Now enter'd in the Spartan ranks, he turn'd\n  His manly breast, and with new fury burn'd;\n  O'er all the black battalions sent his view,\n  And through the cloud the godlike Ajax knew;\n  Where labouring on the left the warrior stood,\n  All grim in arms, and cover'd o'er with blood;\n  There breathing courage, where the god of day\n  Had sunk each heart with terror and dismay.\n\n  To him the king: \"Oh Ajax, oh my friend!\n  Haste, and Patroclus' loved remains defend:\n  The body to Achilles to restore\n  Demands our care; alas, we can no more!\n  For naked now, despoiled of arms, he lies;\n  And Hector glories in the dazzling prize.\"\n  He said, and touch'd his heart. The raging pair\n  Pierced the thick battle, and provoke the war.\n  Already had stern Hector seized his head,\n  And doom'd to Trojan gods the unhappy dead;\n  But soon as Ajax rear'd his tower-like shield,\n  Sprung to his car, and measured back the field,\n  His train to Troy the radiant armour bear,\n  To stand a trophy of his fame in war.\n\n  Meanwhile great Ajax (his broad shield display'd)\n  Guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade;\n  And now before, and now behind he stood:\n  Thus in the centre of some gloomy wood,\n  With many a step, the lioness surrounds\n  Her tawny young, beset by men and hounds;\n  Elate her heart, and rousing all her powers,\n  Dark o'er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours.\n  Fast by his side the generous Spartan glows\n  With great revenge, and feeds his inward woes.\n\n  But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian aids,\n  On Hector frowning, thus his flight upbraids:\n\n  \"Where now in Hector shall we Hector find?\n  A manly form, without a manly mind.\n  Is this, O chief! a hero's boasted fame?\n  How vain, without the merit, is the name!\n  Since battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ\n  What other methods may preserve thy Troy:\n  'Tis time to try if Ilion's state can stand\n  By thee alone, nor ask a foreign hand:\n  Mean, empty boast! but shall the Lycians stake\n  Their lives for you? those Lycians you forsake?\n  What from thy thankless arms can we expect?\n  Thy friend Sarpedon proves thy base neglect;\n  Say, shall our slaughter'd bodies guard your walls,\n  While unreveng'd the great Sarpedon falls?\n  Even where he died for Troy, you left him there,\n  A feast for dogs, and all the fowls of air.\n  On my command if any Lycian wait,\n  Hence let him march, and give up Troy to fate.\n  Did such a spirit as the gods impart\n  Impel one Trojan hand or Trojan heart,\n  (Such as should burn in every soul that draws\n  The sword for glory, and his country's cause)\n  Even yet our mutual arms we might employ,\n  And drag yon carcase to the walls of Troy.\n  Oh! were Patroclus ours, we might obtain\n  Sarpedon's arms and honour'd corse again!\n  Greece with Achilles' friend should be repaid,\n  And thus due honours purchased to his shade.\n  But words are vain--Let Ajax once appear,\n  And Hector trembles and recedes with fear;\n  Thou dar'st not meet the terrors of his eye;\n  And lo! already thou prepar'st to fly.\"\n\n  The Trojan chief with fix'd resentment eyed\n  The Lycian leader, and sedate replied:\n\n  \"Say, is it just, my friend, that Hector's ear\n  From such a warrior such a speech should hear?\n  I deem'd thee once the wisest of thy kind,\n  But ill this insult suits a prudent mind.\n  I shun great Ajax? I desert my train?\n  'Tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain;\n  I joy to mingle where the battle bleeds,\n  And hear the thunder of the sounding steeds.\n  But Jove's high will is ever uncontroll'd,\n  The strong he withers, and confounds the bold;\n  Now crowns with fame the mighty man, and now\n  Strikes the fresh garland from the victor's brow!\n  Come, through yon squadrons let us hew the way,\n  And thou be witness, if I fear to-day;\n  If yet a Greek the sight of Hector dread,\n  Or yet their hero dare defend the dead.\"\n\n  Then turning to the martial hosts, he cries:\n  \"Ye Trojans, Dardans, Lycians, and allies!\n  Be men, my friends, in action as in name,\n  And yet be mindful of your ancient fame.\n  Hector in proud Achilles' arms shall shine,\n  Torn from his friend, by right of conquest mine.\"\n\n  He strode along the field, as thus he said:\n  (The sable plumage nodded o'er his head:)\n  Swift through the spacious plain he sent a look;\n  One instant saw, one instant overtook\n  The distant band, that on the sandy shore\n  The radiant spoils to sacred Ilion bore.\n  There his own mail unbraced the field bestrow'd;\n  His train to Troy convey'd the massy load.\n  Now blazing in the immortal arms he stands;\n  The work and present of celestial hands;\n  By aged Peleus to Achilles given,\n  As first to Peleus by the court of heaven:\n  His father's arms not long Achilles wears,\n  Forbid by fate to reach his father's years.\n\n  Him, proud in triumph, glittering from afar,\n  The god whose thunder rends the troubled air\n  Beheld with pity; as apart he sat,\n  And, conscious, look'd through all the scene of fate.\n  He shook the sacred honours of his head;\n  Olympus trembled, and the godhead said;\n  \"Ah, wretched man! unmindful of thy end!\n  A moment's glory; and what fates attend!\n  In heavenly panoply divinely bright\n  Thou stand'st, and armies tremble at thy sight,\n  As at Achilles' self! beneath thy dart\n  Lies slain the great Achilles' dearer part.\n  Thou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn,\n  Which once the greatest of mankind had worn.\n  Yet live! I give thee one illustrious day,\n  A blaze of glory ere thou fad'st away.\n  For ah! no more Andromache shall come\n  With joyful tears to welcome Hector home;\n  No more officious, with endearing charms,\n  From thy tired limbs unbrace Pelides' arms!\"\n\n  Then with his sable brow he gave the nod\n  That seals his word; the sanction of the god.\n  The stubborn arms (by Jove's command disposed)\n  Conform'd spontaneous, and around him closed:\n  Fill'd with the god, enlarged his members grew,\n  Through all his veins a sudden vigour flew,\n  The blood in brisker tides began to roll,\n  And Mars himself came rushing on his soul.\n  Exhorting loud through all the field he strode,\n  And look'd, and moved, Achilles, or a god.\n  Now Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, he inspires,\n  Now Phorcys, Chromius, and Hippothous fires;\n  The great Thersilochus like fury found,\n  Asteropaeus kindled at the sound,\n  And Ennomus, in augury renown'd.\n\n  \"Hear, all ye hosts, and hear, unnumber'd bands\n  Of neighbouring nations, or of distant lands!\n  'Twas not for state we summon'd you so far,\n  To boast our numbers, and the pomp of war:\n  Ye came to fight; a valiant foe to chase,\n  To save our present, and our future race.\n  Tor this, our wealth, our products, you enjoy,\n  And glean the relics of exhausted Troy.\n  Now then, to conquer or to die prepare;\n  To die or conquer are the terms of war.\n  Whatever hand shall win Patroclus slain,\n  Whoe'er shall drag him to the Trojan train,\n  With Hector's self shall equal honours claim;\n  With Hector part the spoil, and share the fame.\"\n\n  Fired by his words, the troops dismiss their fears,\n  They join, they thicken, they protend their spears;\n  Full on the Greeks they drive in firm array,\n  And each from Ajax hopes the glorious prey:\n  Vain hope! what numbers shall the field o'erspread,\n  What victims perish round the mighty dead!\n\n  Great Ajax mark'd the growing storm from far,\n  And thus bespoke his brother of the war:\n  \"Our fatal day, alas! is come, my friend;\n  And all our wars and glories at an end!\n  'Tis not this corse alone we guard in vain,\n  Condemn'd to vultures on the Trojan plain;\n  We too must yield: the same sad fate must fall\n  On thee, on me, perhaps, my friend, on all.\n  See what a tempest direful Hector spreads,\n  And lo! it bursts, it thunders on our heads!\n  Call on our Greeks, if any hear the call,\n  The bravest Greeks: this hour demands them all.\"\n\n  The warrior raised his voice, and wide around\n  The field re-echoed the distressful sound.\n  \"O chiefs! O princes, to whose hand is given\n  The rule of men; whose glory is from heaven!\n  Whom with due honours both Atrides grace:\n  Ye guides and guardians of our Argive race!\n  All, whom this well-known voice shall reach from far,\n  All, whom I see not through this cloud of war;\n  Come all! let generous rage your arms employ,\n  And save Patroclus from the dogs of Troy.\"\n\n  Oilean Ajax first the voice obey'd,\n  Swift was his pace, and ready was his aid:\n  Next him Idomeneus, more slow with age,\n  And Merion, burning with a hero's rage.\n  The long-succeeding numbers who can name?\n  But all were Greeks, and eager all for fame.\n  Fierce to the charge great Hector led the throng;\n  Whole Troy embodied rush'd with shouts along.\n  Thus, when a mountain billow foams and raves,\n  Where some swoln river disembogues his waves,\n  Full in the mouth is stopp'd the rushing tide,\n  The boiling ocean works from side to side,\n  The river trembles to his utmost shore,\n  And distant rocks re-bellow to the roar.\n\n  Nor less resolved, the firm Achaian band\n  With brazen shields in horrid circle stand.\n  Jove, pouring darkness o'er the mingled fight,\n  Conceals the warriors' shining helms in night:\n  To him, the chief for whom the hosts contend\n  Had lived not hateful, for he lived a friend:\n  Dead he protects him with superior care.\n  Nor dooms his carcase to the birds of air.\n\n             [Illustration: FIGHT FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS.]\n\n                     FIGHT FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS.\n\n\n  The first attack the Grecians scarce sustain,\n  Repulsed, they yield; the Trojans seize the slain.\n  Then fierce they rally, to revenge led on\n  By the swift rage of Ajax Telamon.\n  (Ajax to Peleus' son the second name,\n  In graceful stature next, and next in fame)\n  With headlong force the foremost ranks he tore;\n  So through the thicket bursts the mountain boar,\n  And rudely scatters, for a distance round,\n  The frighted hunter and the baying hound.\n  The son of Lethus, brave Pelasgus' heir,\n  Hippothous, dragg'd the carcase through the war;\n  The sinewy ankles bored, the feet he bound\n  With thongs inserted through the double wound:\n  Inevitable fate o'ertakes the deed;\n  Doom'd by great Ajax' vengeful lance to bleed:\n  It cleft the helmet's brazen cheeks in twain;\n  The shatter'd crest and horse-hair strow the plain:\n  With nerves relax'd he tumbles to the ground:\n  The brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound:\n  He drops Patroclus' foot, and o'er him spread,\n  Now lies a sad companion of the dead:\n  Far from Larissa lies, his native air,\n  And ill requites his parents' tender care.\n  Lamented youth! in life's first bloom he fell,\n  Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.\n\n  Once more at Ajax Hector's javelin flies;\n  The Grecian marking, as it cut the skies,\n  Shunn'd the descending death; which hissing on,\n  Stretch'd in the dust the great Iphytus' son,\n  Schedius the brave, of all the Phocian kind\n  The boldest warrior and the noblest mind:\n  In little Panope, for strength renown'd,\n  He held his seat, and ruled the realms around.\n  Plunged in his throat, the weapon drank his blood,\n  And deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood;\n  In clanging arms the hero fell and all\n  The fields resounded with his weighty fall.\n\n  Phorcys, as slain Hippothous he defends,\n  The Telamonian lance his belly rends;\n  The hollow armour burst before the stroke,\n  And through the wound the rushing entrails broke:\n  In strong convulsions panting on the sands\n  He lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands.\n\n  Struck at the sight, recede the Trojan train:\n  The shouting Argives strip the heroes slain.\n  And now had Troy, by Greece compell'd to yield,\n  Fled to her ramparts, and resign'd the field;\n  Greece, in her native fortitude elate,\n  With Jove averse, had turn'd the scale of fate:\n  But Phoebus urged AEneas to the fight;\n  He seem'd like aged Periphas to sight:\n  (A herald in Anchises' love grown old,\n  Revered for prudence, and with prudence bold.)\n\n  Thus he--\"What methods yet, O chief! remain,\n  To save your Troy, though heaven its fall ordain?\n  There have been heroes, who, by virtuous care,\n  By valour, numbers, and by arts of war,\n  Have forced the powers to spare a sinking state,\n  And gain'd at length the glorious odds of fate:\n  But you, when fortune smiles, when Jove declares\n  His partial favour, and assists your wars,\n  Your shameful efforts 'gainst yourselves employ,\n  And force the unwilling god to ruin Troy.\"\n\n  AEneas through the form assumed descries\n  The power conceal'd, and thus to Hector cries:\n  \"Oh lasting shame! to our own fears a prey,\n  We seek our ramparts, and desert the day.\n  A god, nor is he less, my bosom warms,\n  And tells me, Jove asserts the Trojan arms.\"\n\n  He spoke, and foremost to the combat flew:\n  The bold example all his hosts pursue.\n  Then, first, Leocritus beneath him bled,\n  In vain beloved by valiant Lycomede;\n  Who view'd his fall, and, grieving at the chance,\n  Swift to revenge it sent his angry lance;\n  The whirling lance, with vigorous force address'd,\n  Descends, and pants in Apisaon's breast;\n  From rich Paeonia's vales the warrior came,\n  Next thee, Asteropeus! in place and fame.\n  Asteropeus with grief beheld the slain,\n  And rush'd to combat, but he rush'd in vain:\n  Indissolubly firm, around the dead,\n  Rank within rank, on buckler buckler spread,\n  And hemm'd with bristled spears, the Grecians stood,\n  A brazen bulwark, and an iron wood.\n  Great Ajax eyes them with incessant care,\n  And in an orb contracts the crowded war,\n  Close in their ranks commands to fight or fall,\n  And stands the centre and the soul of all:\n  Fix'd on the spot they war, and wounded, wound\n  A sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground:\n  On heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled,\n  And, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.\n\n  Greece, in close order, and collected might,\n  Yet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight;\n  Fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns,\n  And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.\n  In one thick darkness all the fight was lost;\n  The sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host\n  Seem'd as extinct: day ravish'd from their eyes,\n  And all heaven's splendours blotted from the skies.\n  Such o'er Patroclus' body hung the night,\n  The rest in sunshine fought, and open light;\n  Unclouded there, the aerial azure spread,\n  No vapour rested on the mountain's head,\n  The golden sun pour'd forth a stronger ray,\n  And all the broad expansion flamed with day.\n  Dispersed around the plain, by fits they fight,\n  And here and there their scatter'd arrows light:\n  But death and darkness o'er the carcase spread,\n  There burn'd the war, and there the mighty bled.\n\n  Meanwhile the sons of Nestor, in the rear,\n  (Their fellows routed,) toss the distant spear,\n  And skirmish wide: so Nestor gave command,\n  When from the ships he sent the Pylian band.\n  The youthful brothers thus for fame contend,\n  Nor knew the fortune of Achilles' friend;\n  In thought they view'd him still, with martial joy,\n  Glorious in arms, and dealing death to Troy.\n\n  But round the corse the heroes pant for breath,\n  And thick and heavy grows the work of death:\n  O'erlabour'd now, with dust, and sweat, and gore,\n  Their knees, their legs, their feet, are covered o'er;\n  Drops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise,\n  And carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes.\n  As when a slaughter'd bull's yet reeking hide,\n  Strain'd with full force, and tugg'd from side to side,\n  The brawny curriers stretch; and labour o'er\n  The extended surface, drunk with fat and gore:\n  So tugging round the corse both armies stood;\n  The mangled body bathed in sweat and blood;\n  While Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ,\n  Now to the ships to force it, now to Troy.\n  Not Pallas' self, her breast when fury warms,\n  Nor he whose anger sets the world in arms,\n  Could blame this scene; such rage, such horror reign'd;\n  Such, Jove to honour the great dead ordain'd.\n\n  Achilles in his ships at distance lay,\n  Nor knew the fatal fortune of the day;\n  He, yet unconscious of Patroclus' fall,\n  In dust extended under Ilion's wall,\n  Expects him glorious from the conquered plain,\n  And for his wish'd return prepares in vain;\n  Though well he knew, to make proud Ilion bend\n  Was more than heaven had destined to his friend.\n  Perhaps to him: this Thetis had reveal'd;\n  The rest, in pity to her son, conceal'd.\n\n  Still raged the conflict round the hero dead,\n  And heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled.\n  \"Cursed be the man (even private Greeks would say)\n  Who dares desert this well-disputed day!\n  First may the cleaving earth before our eyes\n  Gape wide, and drink our blood for sacrifice;\n  First perish all, ere haughty Troy shall boast\n  We lost Patroclus, and our glory lost!\"\n\n  Thus they: while with one voice the Trojans said,\n  \"Grant this day, Jove! or heap us on the dead!\"\n\n  Then clash their sounding arms; the clangours rise,\n  And shake the brazen concave of the skies.\n\n  Meantime, at distance from the scene of blood,\n  The pensive steeds of great Achilles stood:\n  Their godlike master slain before their eyes,\n  They wept, and shared in human miseries.(248)\n  In vain Automedon now shakes the rein,\n  Now plies the lash, and soothes and threats in vain;\n  Nor to the fight nor Hellespont they go,\n  Restive they stood, and obstinate in woe:\n  Still as a tombstone, never to be moved,\n  On some good man or woman unreproved\n  Lays its eternal weight; or fix'd, as stands\n  A marble courser by the sculptor's hands,\n  Placed on the hero's grave. Along their face\n  The big round drops coursed down with silent pace,\n  Conglobing on the dust. Their manes, that late\n  Circled their arched necks, and waved in state,\n  Trail'd on the dust beneath the yoke were spread,\n  And prone to earth was hung their languid head:\n  Nor Jove disdain'd to cast a pitying look,\n  While thus relenting to the steeds he spoke:\n\n  \"Unhappy coursers of immortal strain,\n  Exempt from age, and deathless, now in vain;\n  Did we your race on mortal man bestow,\n  Only, alas! to share in mortal woe?\n  For ah! what is there of inferior birth,\n  That breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth;\n  What wretched creature of what wretched kind,\n  Than man more weak, calamitous, and blind?\n  A miserable race! but cease to mourn:\n  For not by you shall Priam's son be borne\n  High on the splendid car: one glorious prize\n  He rashly boasts: the rest our will denies.\n  Ourself will swiftness to your nerves impart,\n  Ourself with rising spirits swell your heart.\n  Automedon your rapid flight shall bear\n  Safe to the navy through the storm of war.\n  For yet 'tis given to Troy to ravage o'er\n  The field, and spread her slaughters to the shore;\n  The sun shall see her conquer, till his fall\n  With sacred darkness shades the face of all.\"\n\n  He said; and breathing in the immortal horse\n  Excessive spirit, urged them to the course;\n  From their high manes they shake the dust, and bear\n  The kindling chariot through the parted war:\n  So flies a vulture through the clamorous train\n  Of geese, that scream, and scatter round the plain.\n  From danger now with swiftest speed they flew,\n  And now to conquest with like speed pursue;\n  Sole in the seat the charioteer remains,\n  Now plies the javelin, now directs the reins:\n  Him brave Alcimedon beheld distress'd,\n  Approach'd the chariot, and the chief address'd:\n\n  \"What god provokes thee rashly thus to dare,\n  Alone, unaided, in the thickest war?\n  Alas! thy friend is slain, and Hector wields\n  Achilles' arms triumphant in the fields.\"\n\n  \"In happy time (the charioteer replies)\n  The bold Alcimedon now greets my eyes;\n  No Greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains,\n  Or holds their fury in suspended reins:\n  Patroclus, while he lived, their rage could tame,\n  But now Patroclus is an empty name!\n  To thee I yield the seat, to thee resign\n  The ruling charge: the task of fight be mine.\"\n\n  He said. Alcimedon, with active heat,\n  Snatches the reins, and vaults into the seat.\n  His friend descends. The chief of Troy descried,\n  And call'd AEneas fighting near his side.\n\n  \"Lo, to my sight, beyond our hope restored,\n  Achilles' car, deserted of its lord!\n  The glorious steeds our ready arms invite,\n  Scarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight.\n  Can such opponents stand when we assail?\n  Unite thy force, my friend, and we prevail.\"\n\n  The son of Venus to the counsel yields;\n  Then o'er their backs they spread their solid shields:\n  With brass refulgent the broad surface shined,\n  And thick bull-hides the spacious concave lined.\n  Them Chromius follows, Aretus succeeds;\n  Each hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds:\n  In vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn,\n  In vain advance! not fated to return.\n\n  Unmov'd, Automedon attends the fight,\n  Implores the Eternal, and collects his might.\n  Then turning to his friend, with dauntless mind:\n  \"Oh keep the foaming coursers close behind!\n  Full on my shoulders let their nostrils blow,\n  For hard the fight, determined is the foe;\n  'Tis Hector comes: and when he seeks the prize,\n  War knows no mean; he wins it or he dies.\"\n\n  Then through the field he sends his voice aloud,\n  And calls the Ajaces from the warring crowd,\n  With great Atrides. \"Hither turn, (he said,)\n  Turn where distress demands immediate aid;\n  The dead, encircled by his friends, forego,\n  And save the living from a fiercer foe.\n  Unhelp'd we stand, unequal to engage\n  The force of Hector, and AEneas' rage:\n  Yet mighty as they are, my force to prove\n  Is only mine: the event belongs to Jove.\"\n\n  He spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung,\n  Which pass'd the shield of Aretus the young:\n  It pierced his belt, emboss'd with curious art,\n  Then in the lower belly struck the dart.\n  As when a ponderous axe, descending full,\n  Cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull:(249)\n  Struck 'twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound,\n  Then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground:\n  Thus fell the youth; the air his soul received,\n  And the spear trembled as his entrails heaved.\n\n  Now at Automedon the Trojan foe\n  Discharged his lance; the meditated blow,\n  Stooping, he shunn'd; the javelin idly fled,\n  And hiss'd innoxious o'er the hero's head;\n  Deep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear\n  In long vibrations spent its fury there.\n  With clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed,\n  But each brave Ajax heard, and interposed;\n  Nor longer Hector with his Trojans stood,\n  But left their slain companion in his blood:\n  His arms Automedon divests, and cries,\n  \"Accept, Patroclus, this mean sacrifice:\n  Thus have I soothed my griefs, and thus have paid,\n  Poor as it is, some offering to thy shade.\"\n\n  So looks the lion o'er a mangled boar,\n  All grim with rage, and horrible with gore;\n  High on the chariot at one bound he sprung,\n  And o'er his seat the bloody trophies hung.\n\n  And now Minerva from the realms of air\n  Descends impetuous, and renews the war;\n  For, pleased at length the Grecian arms to aid,\n  The lord of thunders sent the blue-eyed maid.\n  As when high Jove denouncing future woe,\n  O'er the dark clouds extends his purple bow,\n  (In sign of tempests from the troubled air,\n  Or from the rage of man, destructive war,)\n  The drooping cattle dread the impending skies,\n  And from his half-till'd field the labourer flies:\n  In such a form the goddess round her drew\n  A livid cloud, and to the battle flew.\n  Assuming Phoenix' shape on earth she falls,\n  And in his well-known voice to Sparta calls:\n  \"And lies Achilles' friend, beloved by all,\n  A prey to dogs beneath the Trojan wall?\n  What shame 'o Greece for future times to tell,\n  To thee the greatest in whose cause he fell!\"\n  \"O chief, O father!

The sight of him turns the fortunes of\nthe day, and the body of Patroclus is carried off by the Greeks. The\nTrojans call a council, where Hector and Polydamas disagree in their\nopinions: but the advice of the former prevails, to remain encamped in the\nfield. The grief of Achilles over the body of Patroclus.\n\nThetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her son. The\ndescription of the wonderful works of Vulcan: and, lastly, that noble one\nof the shield of Achilles.\n\nThe latter part of the nine-and-twentieth day, and the night ensuing, take\nup this book: the scene is at Achilles' tent on the sea-shore, from whence\nit changes to the palace of Vulcan.\n\n  Thus like the rage of fire the combat burns,(250)\n  And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.\n  Meanwhile, where Hellespont's broad waters flow,\n  Stood Nestor's son, the messenger of woe:\n  There sat Achilles, shaded by his sails,\n  On hoisted yards extended to the gales;\n  Pensive he sat; for all that fate design'd\n  Rose in sad prospect to his boding mind.\n  Thus to his soul he said: \"Ah! what constrains\n  The Greeks, late victors, now to quit the plains?\n  Is this the day, which heaven so long ago\n  Ordain'd, to sink me with the weight of woe?\n  (So Thetis warn'd;) when by a Trojan hand\n  The bravest of the Myrmidonian band\n  Should lose the light!

She preserves the body\nof his friend from corruption, and commands him to assemble the army, to\ndeclare his resentment at an end. Agamemnon and Achilles are solemnly\nreconciled: the speeches, presents, and ceremonies on that occasion.\nAchilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from the battle\ntill the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of Ulysses. The\npresents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles, where Briseis laments over\nthe body of Patroclus. The hero obstinately refuses all repast, and gives\nhimself up to lamentations for his friend. Minerva descends to strengthen\nhim, by the order of Jupiter. He arms for the fight: his appearance\ndescribed. He addresses himself to his horses, and reproaches them with\nthe death of Patroclus. One of them is miraculously endued with voice, and\ninspired to prophesy his fate: but the hero, not astonished by that\nprodigy, rushes with fury to the combat.\n\nThe thirteenth day. The scene is on the sea-shore.\n\n  Soon as Aurora heaved her Orient head\n  Above the waves, that blush'd with early red,\n  (With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,\n  And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light,)\n  The immortal arms the goddess-mother bears\n  Swift to her son: her son she finds in tears\n  Stretch'd o'er Patroclus' corse; while all the rest\n  Their sovereign's sorrows in their own express'd.\n  A ray divine her heavenly presence shed,\n  And thus, his hand soft touching, Thetis said:\n\n  \"Suppress, my son, this rage of grief, and know\n  It was not man, but heaven, that gave the blow;\n  Behold what arms by Vulcan are bestow'd,\n  Arms worthy thee, or fit to grace a god.\"\n\n  Then drops the radiant burden on the ground;\n  Clang the strong arms, and ring the shores around;\n  Back shrink the Myrmidons with dread surprise,\n  And from the broad effulgence turn their eyes.\n  Unmoved the hero kindles at the show,\n  And feels with rage divine his bosom glow;\n  From his fierce eyeballs living flames expire,\n  And flash incessant like a stream of fire:\n  He turns the radiant gift: and feeds his mind\n  On all the immortal artist had design'd.\n\n  \"Goddess! (he cried,) these glorious arms, that shine\n  With matchless art, confess the hand divine.\n  Now to the bloody battle let me bend:\n  But ah! the relics of my slaughter'd friend!\n  In those wide wounds through which his spirit fled,\n  Shall flies, and worms obscene, pollute the dead?\"\n\n  \"That unavailing care be laid aside,\n  (The azure goddess to her son replied,)\n  Whole years untouch'd, uninjured shall remain,\n  Fresh as in life, the carcase of the slain.\n  But go, Achilles, as affairs require,\n  Before the Grecian peers renounce thine ire:\n  Then uncontroll'd in boundless war engage,\n  And heaven with strength supply the mighty rage!\"\n\n         [Illustration: THETIS BRINGING THE ARMOUR TO ACHILLES.]\n\n                 THETIS BRINGING THE ARMOUR TO ACHILLES.\n\n\n  Then in the nostrils of the slain she pour'd\n  Nectareous drops, and rich ambrosia shower'd\n  O'er all the corse.

better far had been the fate\n  Of thee, of me, of all the Grecian state,\n  If (ere the day when by mad passion sway'd,\n  Rash we contended for the black-eyed maid)\n  Preventing Dian had despatch'd her dart,\n  And shot the shining mischief to the heart!\n  Then many a hero had not press'd the shore,\n  Nor Troy's glad fields been fatten'd with our gore.\n  Long, long shall Greece the woes we caused bewail,\n  And sad posterity repeat the tale.\n  But this, no more the subject of debate,\n  Is past, forgotten, and resign'd to fate.\n  Why should, alas, a mortal man, as I,\n  Burn with a fury that can never die?\n  Here then my anger ends: let war succeed,\n  And even as Greece has bled, let Ilion bleed.\n  Now call the hosts, and try if in our sight\n  Troy yet shall dare to camp a second night!\n  I deem, their mightiest, when this arm he knows,\n  Shall 'scape with transport, and with joy repose.\"\n\n  He said: his finish'd wrath with loud acclaim\n  The Greeks accept, and shout Pelides' name.\n  When thus, not rising from his lofty throne,\n  In state unmoved, the king of men begun:\n\n  \"Hear me, ye sons of Greece!

then Agamemnon rose:\n  The boar Talthybius held: the Grecian lord\n  Drew the broad cutlass sheath'd beside his sword:\n  The stubborn bristles from the victim's brow\n  He crops, and offering meditates his vow.\n  His hands uplifted to the attesting skies,\n  On heaven's broad marble roof were fixed his eyes.\n  The solemn words a deep attention draw,\n  And Greece around sat thrill'd with sacred awe.\n\n  \"Witness thou first!

His train before\n  March'd onward, bending with the gifts they bore.\n  Those in the tents the squires industrious spread:\n  The foaming coursers to the stalls they led;\n  To their new seats the female captives move\n  Briseis, radiant as the queen of love,\n  Slow as she pass'd, beheld with sad survey\n  Where, gash'd with cruel wounds, Patroclus lay.\n  Prone on the body fell the heavenly fair,\n  Beat her sad breast, and tore her golden hair;\n  All beautiful in grief, her humid eyes\n  Shining with tears she lifts, and thus she cries:\n\n  \"Ah, youth for ever dear, for ever kind,\n  Once tender friend of my distracted mind!\n  I left thee fresh in life, in beauty gay;\n  Now find thee cold, inanimated clay!\n  What woes my wretched race of life attend!\n  Sorrows on sorrows, never doom'd to end!\n  The first loved consort of my virgin bed\n  Before these eyes in fatal battle bled:\n  My three brave brothers in one mournful day\n  All trod the dark, irremeable way:\n  Thy friendly hand uprear'd me from the plain,\n  And dried my sorrows for a husband slain;\n  Achilles' care you promised I should prove,\n  The first, the dearest partner of his love;\n  That rites divine should ratify the band,\n  And make me empress in his native land.\n  Accept these grateful tears! for thee they flow,\n  For thee, that ever felt another's woe!\"\n\n  Her sister captives echoed groan for groan,\n  Nor mourn'd Patroclus' fortunes, but their own.\n  The leaders press'd the chief on every side;\n  Unmoved he heard them, and with sighs denied.\n\n  \"If yet Achilles have a friend, whose care\n  Is bent to please him, this request forbear;\n  Till yonder sun descend, ah, let me pay\n  To grief and anguish one abstemious day.\"\n\n  He spoke, and from the warriors turn'd his face:\n  Yet still the brother-kings of Atreus' race,\n  Nestor, Idomeneus, Ulysses sage,\n  And Phoenix, strive to calm his grief and rage:\n  His rage they calm not, nor his grief control;\n  He groans, he raves, he sorrows from his soul.\n\n  \"Thou too, Patroclus! (thus his heart he vents)\n  Once spread the inviting banquet in our tents:\n  Thy sweet society, thy winning care,\n  Once stay'd Achilles, rushing to the war.\n  But now, alas! to death's cold arms resign'd,\n  What banquet but revenge can glad my mind?\n  What greater sorrow could afflict my breast,\n  What more if hoary Peleus were deceased?\n  Who now, perhaps, in Phthia dreads to hear\n  His son's sad fate, and drops a tender tear.\n  What more, should Neoptolemus the brave,\n  My only offspring, sink into the grave?\n  If yet that offspring lives; (I distant far,\n  Of all neglectful, wage a hateful war.)\n  I could not this, this cruel stroke attend;\n  Fate claim'd Achilles, but might spare his friend.\n  I hoped Patroclus might survive, to rear\n  My tender orphan with a parent's care,\n  From Scyros' isle conduct him o'er the main,\n  And glad his eyes with his paternal reign,\n  The lofty palace, and the large domain.\n  For Peleus breathes no more the vital air;\n  Or drags a wretched life of age and care,\n  But till the news of my sad fate invades\n  His hastening soul, and sinks him to the shades.\"\n\n  Sighing he said: his grief the heroes join'd,\n  Each stole a tear for what he left behind.\n  Their mingled grief the sire of heaven survey'd,\n  And thus with pity to his blue-eyed maid:\n\n  \"Is then Achilles now no more thy care,\n  And dost thou thus desert the great in war?\n  Lo, where yon sails their canvas wings extend,\n  All comfortless he sits, and wails his friend:\n  Ere thirst and want his forces have oppress'd,\n  Haste and infuse ambrosia in his breast.\"\n\n  He spoke; and sudden, at the word of Jove,\n  Shot the descending goddess from above.\n  So swift through ether the shrill harpy springs,\n  The wide air floating to her ample wings,\n  To great Achilles she her flight address'd,\n  And pour'd divine ambrosia in his breast,(259)\n  With nectar sweet, (refection of the gods!)\n  Then, swift ascending, sought the bright abodes.\n\n  Now issued from the ships the warrior-train,\n  And like a deluge pour'd upon the plain.\n  As when the piercing blasts of Boreas blow,\n  And scatter o'er the fields the driving snow;\n  From dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies,\n  Whose dazzling lustre whitens all the skies:\n  So helms succeeding helms, so shields from shields,\n  Catch the quick beams, and brighten all the fields;\n  Broad glittering breastplates, spears with pointed rays,\n  Mix in one stream, reflecting blaze on blaze;\n  Thick beats the centre as the coursers bound;\n  With splendour flame the skies, and laugh the fields around,\n\n  Full in the midst, high-towering o'er the rest,\n  His limbs in arms divine Achilles dress'd;\n  Arms which the father of the fire bestow'd,\n  Forged on the eternal anvils of the god.\n  Grief and revenge his furious heart inspire,\n  His glowing eyeballs roll with living fire;\n  He grinds his teeth, and furious with delay\n  O'erlooks the embattled host, and hopes the bloody day.\n\n  The silver cuishes first his thighs infold;\n  Then o'er his breast was braced the hollow gold;\n  The brazen sword a various baldric tied,\n  That, starr'd with gems, hung glittering at his side;\n  And, like the moon, the broad refulgent shield\n  Blazed with long rays, and gleam'd athwart the field.\n\n  So to night-wandering sailors, pale with fears,\n  Wide o'er the watery waste, a light appears,\n  Which on the far-seen mountain blazing high,\n  Streams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky:\n  With mournful eyes they gaze, and gaze again;\n  Loud howls the storm, and drives them o'er the main.\n\n  Next, his high head the helmet graced; behind\n  The sweepy crest hung floating in the wind:\n  Like the red star, that from his flaming hair\n  Shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war;\n  So stream'd the golden honours from his head,\n  Trembled the sparkling plumes, and the loose glories shed.\n  The chief beholds himself with wondering eyes;\n  His arms he poises, and his motions tries;\n  Buoy'd by some inward force, he seems to swim,\n  And feels a pinion lifting every limb.\n\n  And now he shakes his great paternal spear,\n  Ponderous and huge, which not a Greek could rear,\n  From Pelion's cloudy top an ash entire\n  Old Chiron fell'd, and shaped it for his sire;\n  A spear which stern Achilles only wields,\n  The death of heroes, and the dread of fields.\n\n  Automedon and Alcimus prepare\n  The immortal coursers, and the radiant car;\n  (The silver traces sweeping at their side;)\n  Their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied;\n  The ivory-studded reins, return'd behind,\n  Waved o'er their backs, and to the chariot join'd.\n  The charioteer then whirl'd the lash around,\n  And swift ascended at one active bound.\n  All bright in heavenly arms, above his squire\n  Achilles mounts, and sets the field on fire;\n  Not brighter Phoebus in the ethereal way\n  Flames from his chariot, and restores the day.\n  High o'er the host, all terrible he stands,\n  And thunders to his steeds these dread commands:\n\n  \"Xanthus and Balius! of Podarges' strain,\n  (Unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain,)\n  Be swift, be mindful of the load ye bear,\n  And learn to make your master more your care:\n  Through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword,\n  Nor, as ye left Patroclus, leave your lord.\"\n\n  The generous Xanthus, as the words he said,\n  Seem'd sensible of woe, and droop'd his head:\n  Trembling he stood before the golden wain,\n  And bow'd to dust the honours of his mane.\n  When, strange to tell! (so Juno will'd) he broke\n  Eternal silence, and portentous spoke.\n  \"Achilles! yes! this day at least we bear\n  Thy rage in safety through the files of war:\n  But come it will, the fatal time must come,\n  Not ours the fault, but God decrees thy doom.\n  Not through our crime, or slowness in the course,\n  Fell thy Patroclus, but by heavenly force;\n  The bright far-shooting god who gilds the day\n  (Confess'd we saw him) tore his arms way.\n  No--could our swiftness o'er the winds prevail,\n  Or beat the pinions of the western gale,\n  All were in vain--the Fates thy death demand,\n  Due to a mortal and immortal hand.\"\n\n  Then ceased for ever, by the Furies tied,\n  His fateful voice. The intrepid chief replied\n  With unabated rage--\"So let it be!\n  Portents and prodigies are lost on me.\n  I know my fate: to die, to see no more\n  My much-loved parents, and my native shore--\n  Enough--when heaven ordains, I sink in night:\n  Now perish Troy!\" He said, and rush'd to fight.\n\n                        [Illustration: HERCULES.]\n\n                                HERCULES.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XX.\n\n\nARGUMENT.\n\nTHE BATTLE OF THE GODS, AND THE ACTS OF ACHILLES.\n\nJupiter, upon Achilles' return to the battle, calls a council of the gods,\nand permits them to assist either party. The terrors of the combat\ndescribed, when the deities are engaged. Apollo encourages AEneas to meet\nAchilles. After a long conversation, these two heroes encounter; but AEneas\nis preserved by the assistance of Neptune. Achilles falls upon the rest of\nthe Trojans, and is upon the point of killing Hector, but Apollo conveys\nhim away in a cloud. Achilles pursues the Trojans with a great slaughter.\n\nThe same day continues. The scene is in the field before Troy.\n\n  Thus round Pelides breathing war and blood\n  Greece, sheathed in arms, beside her vessels stood;\n  While near impending from a neighbouring height,\n  Troy's black battalions wait the shock of fight.\n  Then Jove to Themis gives command, to call\n  The gods to council in the starry hall:\n  Swift o'er Olympus' hundred hills she flies,\n  And summons all the senate of the skies.\n  These shining on, in long procession come\n  To Jove's eternal adamantine dome.\n  Not one was absent, not a rural power\n  That haunts the verdant gloom, or rosy bower;\n  Each fair-hair'd dryad of the shady wood,\n  Each azure sister of the silver flood;\n  All but old Ocean, hoary sire! who keeps\n  His ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps.\n  On marble thrones, with lucid columns crown'd,\n  (The work of Vulcan,) sat the powers around.\n  Even he whose trident sways the watery reign\n  Heard the loud summons, and forsook the main,\n  Assumed his throne amid the bright abodes,\n  And question'd thus the sire of men and gods:\n\n  \"What moves the god who heaven and earth commands,\n  And grasps the thunder in his awful hands,\n  Thus to convene the whole ethereal state?\n  Is Greece and Troy the subject in debate?\n  Already met, the louring hosts appear,\n  And death stands ardent on the edge of war.\"\n\n  \"'Tis true (the cloud-compelling power replies)\n  This day we call the council of the skies\n  In care of human race; even Jove's own eye\n  Sees with regret unhappy mortals die.\n  Far on Olympus' top in secret state\n  Ourself will sit, and see the hand of fate\n  Work out our will. Celestial powers! descend,\n  And as your minds direct, your succour lend\n  To either host. Troy soon must lie o'erthrown,\n  If uncontroll'd Achilles fights alone:\n  Their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes;\n  What can they now, if in his rage he rise?\n  Assist them, gods! or Ilion's sacred wall\n  May fall this day, though fate forbids the fall.\"\n\n  He said, and fired their heavenly breasts with rage.\n  On adverse parts the warring gods engage:\n  Heaven's awful queen; and he whose azure round\n  Girds the vast globe; the maid in arms renown'd;\n  Hermes, of profitable arts the sire;\n  And Vulcan, the black sovereign of the fire:\n  These to the fleet repair with instant flight;\n  The vessels tremble as the gods alight.\n  In aid of Troy, Latona, Phoebus came,\n  Mars fiery-helm'd, the laughter-loving dame,\n  Xanthus, whose streams in golden currents flow,\n  And the chaste huntress of the silver bow.\n  Ere yet the gods their various aid employ,\n  Each Argive bosom swell'd with manly joy,\n  While great Achilles (terror of the plain),\n  Long lost to battle, shone in arms again.\n  Dreadful he stood in front of all his host;\n  Pale Troy beheld, and seem'd already lost;\n  Her bravest heroes pant with inward fear,\n  And trembling see another god of war.\n\n  But when the powers descending swell'd the fight,\n  Then tumult rose: fierce rage and pale affright\n  Varied each face: then Discord sounds alarms,\n  Earth echoes, and the nations rush to arms.\n  Now through the trembling shores Minerva calls,\n  And now she thunders from the Grecian walls.\n  Mars hovering o'er his Troy, his terror shrouds\n  In gloomy tempests, and a night of clouds:\n  Now through each Trojan heart he fury pours\n  With voice divine, from Ilion's topmost towers:\n  Now shouts to Simois, from her beauteous hill;\n  The mountain shook, the rapid stream stood still.\n\n  Above, the sire of gods his thunder rolls,\n  And peals on peals redoubled rend the poles.\n  Beneath, stern Neptune shakes the solid ground;\n  The forests wave, the mountains nod around;\n  Through all their summits tremble Ida's woods,\n  And from their sources boil her hundred floods.\n  Troy's turrets totter on the rocking plain,\n  And the toss'd navies beat the heaving main.\n  Deep in the dismal regions of the dead,(260)\n  The infernal monarch rear'd his horrid head,\n  Leap'd from his throne, lest Neptune's arm should lay\n  His dark dominions open to the day,\n  And pour in light on Pluto's drear abodes,\n  Abhorr'd by men, and dreadful even to gods.(261)\n\n              [Illustration: THE GODS DESCENDING TO BATTLE.]\n\n                      THE GODS DESCENDING TO BATTLE.\n\n\n  Such war the immortals wage;

in search of Hector turn'd\n  His eyes around, for Hector only burn'd;\n  And burst like lightning through the ranks, and vow'd\n  To glut the god of battles with his blood.\n\n  AEneas was the first who dared to stay;\n  Apollo wedged him in the warrior's way,\n  But swell'd his bosom with undaunted might,\n  Half-forced and half-persuaded to the fight.\n  Like young Lycaon, of the royal line,\n  In voice and aspect, seem'd the power divine;\n  And bade the chief reflect, how late with scorn\n  In distant threats he braved the goddess-born.\n\n  Then thus the hero of Anchises' strain:\n  \"To meet Pelides you persuade in vain:\n  Already have I met, nor void of fear\n  Observed the fury of his flying spear;\n  From Ida's woods he chased us to the field,\n  Our force he scattered, and our herds he kill'd;\n  Lyrnessus, Pedasus in ashes lay;\n  But (Jove assisting) I survived the day:\n  Else had I sunk oppress'd in fatal fight\n  By fierce Achilles and Minerva's might.\n  Where'er he moved, the goddess shone before,\n  And bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore.\n  What mortal man Achilles can sustain?\n  The immortals guard him through the dreadful plain,\n  And suffer not his dart to fall in vain.\n  Were God my aid, this arm should check his power,\n  Though strong in battle as a brazen tower.\"\n\n  To whom the son of Jove: \"That god implore,\n  And be what great Achilles was before.\n  From heavenly Venus thou deriv'st thy strain,\n  And he but from a sister of the main;\n  An aged sea-god father of his line;\n  But Jove himself the sacred source of thine.\n  Then lift thy weapon for a noble blow,\n  Nor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe.\"\n\n  This said, and spirit breathed into his breast,\n  Through the thick troops the embolden'd hero press'd:\n  His venturous act the white-arm'd queen survey'd,\n  And thus, assembling all the powers, she said:\n\n  \"Behold an action, gods! that claims your care,\n  Lo great AEneas rushing to the war!\n  Against Pelides he directs his course,\n  Phoebus impels, and Phoebus gives him force.\n  Restrain his bold career; at least, to attend\n  Our favour'd hero, let some power descend.\n  To guard his life, and add to his renown,\n  We, the great armament of heaven, came down.\n  Hereafter let him fall, as Fates design,\n  That spun so short his life's illustrious line:(262)\n  But lest some adverse god now cross his way,\n  Give him to know what powers assist this day:\n  For how shall mortal stand the dire alarms,\n  When heaven's refulgent host appear in arms?\"(263)\n\n  Thus she; and thus the god whose force can make\n  The solid globe's eternal basis shake:\n  \"Against the might of man, so feeble known,\n  Why should celestial powers exert their own?\n  Suffice from yonder mount to view the scene,\n  And leave to war the fates of mortal men.\n  But if the armipotent, or god of light,\n  Obstruct Achilles, or commence the fight.\n  Thence on the gods of Troy we swift descend:\n  Full soon, I doubt not, shall the conflict end;\n  And these, in ruin and confusion hurl'd,\n  Yield to our conquering arms the lower world.\"\n\n  Thus having said, the tyrant of the sea,\n  Coerulean Neptune, rose, and led the way.\n  Advanced upon the field there stood a mound\n  Of earth congested, wall'd, and trench'd around;\n  In elder times to guard Alcides made,\n  (The work of Trojans, with Minerva's aid,)\n  What time a vengeful monster of the main\n  Swept the wide shore, and drove him to the plain.\n\n  Here Neptune and the gods of Greece repair,\n  With clouds encompass'd, and a veil of air:\n  The adverse powers, around Apollo laid,\n  Crown the fair hills that silver Simois shade.\n  In circle close each heavenly party sat,\n  Intent to form the future scheme of fate;\n  But mix not yet in fight, though Jove on high\n  Gives the loud signal, and the heavens reply.\n\n  Meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground;\n  The trampled centre yields a hollow sound:\n  Steeds cased in mail, and chiefs in armour bright,\n  The gleaming champaign glows with brazen light.\n  Amid both hosts (a dreadful space) appear,\n  There great Achilles; bold AEneas, here.\n  With towering strides Aeneas first advanced;\n  The nodding plumage on his helmet danced:\n  Spread o'er his breast the fencing shield he bore,\n  And, so he moved, his javelin flamed before.\n  Not so Pelides; furious to engage,\n  He rush'd impetuous. Such the lion's rage,\n  Who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,\n  Though all in arms the peopled city rise,\n  Stalks careless on, with unregarding pride;\n  Till at the length, by some brave youth defied,\n  To his bold spear the savage turns alone,\n  He murmurs fury with a hollow groan;\n  He grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around\n  Lash'd by his tail his heaving sides resound;\n  He calls up all his rage; he grinds his teeth,\n  Resolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.\n  So fierce Achilles on AEneas flies;\n  So stands AEneas, and his force defies.\n  Ere yet the stern encounter join'd, begun\n  The seed of Thetis thus to Venus' son:\n\n  \"Why comes AEneas through the ranks so far?\n  Seeks he to meet Achilles' arm in war,\n  In hope the realms of Priam to enjoy,\n  And prove his merits to the throne of Troy?\n  Grant that beneath thy lance Achilles dies,\n  The partial monarch may refuse the prize;\n  Sons he has many; those thy pride may quell:\n  And 'tis his fault to love those sons too well,\n  Or, in reward of thy victorious hand,\n  Has Troy proposed some spacious tract of land\n  An ample forest, or a fair domain,\n  Of hills for vines, and arable for grain?\n  Even this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot.\n  But can Achilles be so soon forgot?\n  Once (as I think) you saw this brandish'd spear\n  And then the great AEneas seem'd to fear:\n  With hearty haste from Ida's mount he fled,\n  Nor, till he reach'd Lyrnessus, turn'd his head.\n  Her lofty walls not long our progress stay'd;\n  Those, Pallas, Jove, and we, in ruins laid:\n  In Grecian chains her captive race were cast;\n  'Tis true, the great Aeneas fled too fast.\n  Defrauded of my conquest once before,\n  What then I lost, the gods this day restore.\n  Go; while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate;\n  Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.\"\n\n  To this Anchises' son: \"Such words employ\n  To one that fears thee, some unwarlike boy;\n  Such we disdain; the best may be defied\n  With mean reproaches, and unmanly pride;\n  Unworthy the high race from which we came\n  Proclaim'd so loudly by the voice of fame:\n  Each from illustrious fathers draws his line;\n  Each goddess-born; half human, half divine.\n  Thetis' this day, or Venus' offspring dies,\n  And tears shall trickle from celestial eyes:\n  For when two heroes, thus derived, contend,\n  'Tis not in words the glorious strife can end.\n  If yet thou further seek to learn my birth\n  (A tale resounded through the spacious earth)\n  Hear how the glorious origin we prove\n  From ancient Dardanus, the first from Jove:\n  Dardania's walls he raised; for Ilion, then,\n  (The city since of many-languaged men,)\n  Was not. The natives were content to till\n  The shady foot of Ida's fountful hill.(264)\n  From Dardanus great Erichthonius springs,\n  The richest, once, of Asia's wealthy kings;\n  Three thousand mares his spacious pastures bred,\n  Three thousand foals beside their mothers fed.\n  Boreas, enamour'd of the sprightly train,\n  Conceal'd his godhead in a flowing mane,\n  With voice dissembled to his loves he neigh'd,\n  And coursed the dappled beauties o'er the mead:\n  Hence sprung twelve others of unrivall'd kind,\n  Swift as their mother mares, and father wind.\n  These lightly skimming, when they swept the plain,\n  Nor plied the grass, nor bent the tender grain;\n  And when along the level seas they flew,(265)\n  Scarce on the surface curl'd the briny dew.\n  Such Erichthonius was: from him there came\n  The sacred Tros, of whom the Trojan name.\n  Three sons renown'd adorn'd his nuptial bed,\n  Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymed:\n  The matchless Ganymed, divinely fair,\n  Whom heaven, enamour'd, snatch'd to upper air,\n  To bear the cup of Jove (ethereal guest,\n  The grace and glory of the ambrosial feast).\n  The two remaining sons the line divide:\n  First rose Laomedon from Ilus' side;\n  From him Tithonus, now in cares grown old,\n  And Priam, bless'd with Hector, brave and bold;\n  Clytius and Lampus, ever-honour'd pair;\n  And Hicetaon, thunderbolt of war.\n  From great Assaracus sprang Capys, he\n  Begat Anchises, and Anchises me.\n  Such is our race: 'tis fortune gives us birth,\n  But Jove alone endues the soul with worth:\n  He, source of power and might! with boundless sway,\n  All human courage gives, or takes away.\n  Long in the field of words we may contend,\n  Reproach is infinite, and knows no end,\n  Arm'd or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong;\n  So voluble a weapon is the tongue;\n  Wounded, we wound; and neither side can fail,\n  For every man has equal strength to rail:\n  Women alone, when in the streets they jar,\n  Perhaps excel us in this wordy war;\n  Like us they stand, encompass'd with the crowd,\n  And vent their anger impotent and loud.\n  Cease then--Our business in the field of fight\n  Is not to question, but to prove our might.\n  To all those insults thou hast offer'd here,\n  Receive this answer: 'tis my flying spear.\"\n\n  He spoke. With all his force the javelin flung,\n  Fix'd deep, and loudly in the buckler rung.\n  Far on his outstretch'd arm, Pelides held\n  (To meet the thundering lance) his dreadful shield,\n  That trembled as it stuck; nor void of fear\n  Saw, ere it fell, the immeasurable spear.\n  His fears were vain; impenetrable charms\n  Secured the temper of the ethereal arms.\n  Through two strong plates the point its passage held,\n  But stopp'd, and rested, by the third repell'd.\n  Five plates of various metal, various mould,\n  Composed the shield; of brass each outward fold,\n  Of tin each inward, and the middle gold:\n  There stuck the lance. Then rising ere he threw,\n  The forceful spear of great Achilles flew,\n  And pierced the Dardan shield's extremest bound,\n  Where the shrill brass return'd a sharper sound:\n  Through the thin verge the Pelean weapon glides,\n  And the slight covering of expanded hides.\n  AEneas his contracted body bends,\n  And o'er him high the riven targe extends,\n  Sees, through its parting plates, the upper air,\n  And at his back perceives the quivering spear:\n  A fate so near him, chills his soul with fright;\n  And swims before his eyes the many-colour'd light.\n  Achilles, rushing in with dreadful cries,\n  Draws his broad blade, and at AEneas flies:\n  AEneas rousing as the foe came on,\n  With force collected, heaves a mighty stone:\n  A mass enormous! which in modern days\n  No two of earth's degenerate sons could raise.\n  But ocean's god, whose earthquakes rock the ground.\n  Saw the distress, and moved the powers around:\n\n  \"Lo! on the brink of fate AEneas stands,\n  An instant victim to Achilles' hands;\n  By Phoebus urged; but Phoebus has bestow'd\n  His aid in vain: the man o'erpowers the god.\n  And can ye see this righteous chief atone\n  With guiltless blood for vices not his own?\n  To all the gods his constant vows were paid;\n  Sure, though he wars for Troy, he claims our aid.\n  Fate wills not this; nor thus can Jove resign\n  The future father of the Dardan line:(266)\n  The first great ancestor obtain'd his grace,\n  And still his love descends on all the race:\n  For Priam now, and Priam's faithless kind,\n  At length are odious to the all-seeing mind;\n  On great AEneas shall devolve the reign,\n  And sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain.\"\n\n  The great earth-shaker thus: to whom replies\n  The imperial goddess with the radiant eyes:\n  \"Good as he is, to immolate or spare\n  The Dardan prince, O Neptune! be thy care;\n  Pallas and I, by all that gods can bind,\n  Have sworn destruction to the Trojan kind;\n  Not even an instant to protract their fate,\n  Or save one member of the sinking state;\n  Till her last flame be quench'd with her last gore,\n  And even her crumbling ruins are no more.\"\n\n  The king of ocean to the fight descends,\n  Through all the whistling darts his course he bends,\n  Swift interposed between the warrior flies,\n  And casts thick darkness o'er Achilles' eyes.(267)\n  From great AEneas' shield the spear he drew,\n  And at his master's feet the weapon threw.\n  That done, with force divine he snatch'd on high\n  The Dardan prince, and bore him through the sky,\n  Smooth-gliding without step, above the heads\n  Of warring heroes, and of bounding steeds:\n  Till at the battle's utmost verge they light,\n  Where the slow Caucans close the rear of fight.\n  The godhead there (his heavenly form confess'd)\n  With words like these the panting chief address'd:\n\n  \"What power, O prince! with force inferior far,\n  Urged thee to meet Achilles' arm in war?\n  Henceforth beware, nor antedate thy doom,\n  Defrauding fate of all thy fame to come.\n  But when the day decreed (for come it must)\n  Shall lay this dreadful hero in the dust,\n  Let then the furies of that arm be known,\n  Secure no Grecian force transcends thy own.\"\n\n  With that, he left him wondering as he lay,\n  Then from Achilles chased the mist away:\n  Sudden, returning with a stream of light,\n  The scene of war came rushing on his sight.\n  Then thus, amazed; \"What wonders strike my mind!\n  My spear, that parted on the wings of wind,\n  Laid here before me! and the Dardan lord,\n  That fell this instant, vanish'd from my sword!\n  I thought alone with mortals to contend,\n  But powers celestial sure this foe defend.\n  Great as he is, our arms he scarce will try,\n  Content for once, with all his gods, to fly.\n  Now then let others bleed.\" This said, aloud\n  He vents his fury and inflames the crowd:\n  \"O Greeks! (he cries, and every rank alarms)\n  Join battle, man to man, and arms to arms!\n  'Tis not in me, though favour'd by the sky,\n  To mow whole troops, and make whole armies fly:\n  No god can singly such a host engage,\n  Not Mars himself, nor great Minerva's rage.\n  But whatsoe'er Achilles can inspire,\n  Whate'er of active force, or acting fire;\n  Whate'er this heart can prompt, or hand obey;\n  All, all Achilles, Greeks! is yours to-day.\n  Through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear,\n  And thin the squadrons with my single spear.\"\n\n  He said: nor less elate with martial joy,\n  The godlike Hector warm'd the troops of Troy:\n  \"Trojans, to war! Think, Hector leads you on;\n  Nor dread the vaunts of Peleus' haughty son.\n  Deeds must decide our fate. E'en these with words\n  Insult the brave, who tremble at their swords:\n  The weakest atheist-wretch all heaven defies,\n  But shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies.\n  Nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire,\n  Not though his heart were steel, his hands were fire;\n  That fire, that steel, your Hector should withstand,\n  And brave that vengeful heart, that dreadful hand.\"\n\n  Thus (breathing rage through all) the hero said;\n  A wood of lances rises round his head,\n  Clamours on clamours tempest all the air,\n  They join, they throng, they thicken to the war.\n  But Phoebus warns him from high heaven to shun\n  The single fight with Thetis' godlike son;\n  More safe to combat in the mingled band,\n  Nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand.\n  He hears, obedient to the god of light,\n  And, plunged within the ranks, awaits the fight.\n\n  Then fierce Achilles, shouting to the skies,\n  On Troy's whole force with boundless fury flies.\n  First falls Iphytion, at his army's head;\n  Brave was the chief, and brave the host he led;\n  From great Otrynteus he derived his blood,\n  His mother was a Nais, of the flood;\n  Beneath the shades of Tmolus, crown'd with snow,\n  From Hyde's walls he ruled the lands below.\n  Fierce as he springs, the sword his head divides:\n  The parted visage falls on equal sides:\n  With loud-resounding arms he strikes the plain;\n  While thus Achilles glories o'er the slain:\n\n  \"Lie there, Otryntides! the Trojan earth\n  Receives thee dead, though Gygae boast thy birth;\n  Those beauteous fields where Hyllus' waves are roll'd,\n  And plenteous Hermus swells with tides of gold,\n  Are thine no more.\"--The insulting hero said,\n  And left him sleeping in eternal shade.\n  The rolling wheels of Greece the body tore,\n  And dash'd their axles with no vulgar gore.\n\n  Demoleon next, Antenor's offspring, laid\n  Breathless in dust, the price of rashness paid.\n  The impatient steel with full-descending sway\n  Forced through his brazen helm its furious way,\n  Resistless drove the batter'd skull before,\n  And dash'd and mingled all the brains with gore.\n  This sees Hippodamas, and seized with fright,\n  Deserts his chariot for a swifter flight:\n  The lance arrests him: an ignoble wound\n  The panting Trojan rivets to the ground.\n  He groans away his soul: not louder roars,\n  At Neptune's shrine on Helice's high shores,\n  The victim bull; the rocks re-bellow round,\n  And ocean listens to the grateful sound.\n  Then fell on Polydore his vengeful rage,(268)\n  The youngest hope of Priam's stooping age:\n  (Whose feet for swiftness in the race surpass'd:)\n  Of all his sons, the dearest, and the last.\n  To the forbidden field he takes his flight,\n  In the first folly of a youthful knight,\n  To vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain,\n  But vaunts not long, with all his swiftness slain:\n  Struck where the crossing belts unite behind,\n  And golden rings the double back-plate join'd\n  Forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel;\n  And on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell;\n  The rushing entrails pour'd upon the ground\n  His hands collect; and darkness wraps him round.\n  When Hector view'd, all ghastly in his gore,\n  Thus sadly slain the unhappy Polydore,\n  A cloud of sorrow overcast his sight,\n  His soul no longer brook'd the distant fight:\n  Full in Achilles' dreadful front he came,\n  And shook his javelin like a waving flame.\n  The son of Peleus sees, with joy possess'd,\n  His heart high-bounding in his rising breast.\n  \"And, lo! the man on whom black fates attend;\n  The man, that slew Achilles, is his friend!\n  No more shall Hector's and Pelides' spear\n  Turn from each other in the walks of war.\"--\n  Then with revengeful eyes he scann'd him o'er:\n  \"Come, and receive thy fate!\" He spake no more.\n\n  Hector, undaunted, thus: \"Such words employ\n  To one that dreads thee, some unwarlike boy:\n  Such we could give, defying and defied,\n  Mean intercourse of obloquy and pride!\n  I know thy force to mine superior far;\n  But heaven alone confers success in war:\n  Mean as I am, the gods may guide my dart,\n  And give it entrance in a braver heart.\"\n\n  Then parts the lance: but Pallas' heavenly breath\n  Far from Achilles wafts the winged death:\n  The bidden dart again to Hector flies,\n  And at the feet of its great master lies.\n  Achilles closes with his hated foe,\n  His heart and eyes with flaming fury glow:\n  But present to his aid, Apollo shrouds\n  The favour'd hero in a veil of clouds.\n  Thrice struck Pelides with indignant heart,\n  Thrice in impassive air he plunged the dart;\n  The spear a fourth time buried in the cloud.\n  He foams with fury, and exclaims aloud:\n\n  \"Wretch! thou hast 'scaped again; once more thy flight\n  Has saved thee, and the partial god of light.\n  But long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand,\n  If any power assist Achilles' hand.\n  Fly then inglorious! but thy flight this day\n  Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay.\"\n\n  With that, he gluts his rage on numbers slain:\n  Then Dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain,\n  Pierced through the neck: he left him panting there,\n  And stopp'd Demuchus, great Philetor's heir.\n  Gigantic chief! deep gash'd the enormous blade,\n  And for the soul an ample passage made.\n  Laoganus and Dardanus expire,\n  The valiant sons of an unhappy sire;\n  Both in one instant from the chariot hurl'd,\n  Sunk in one instant to the nether world:\n  This difference only their sad fates afford\n  That one the spear destroy'd, and one the sword.\n\n  Nor less unpitied, young Alastor bleeds;\n  In vain his youth, in vain his beauty pleads;\n  In vain he begs thee, with a suppliant's moan,\n  To spare a form, an age so like thy own!\n  Unhappy boy! no prayer, no moving art,\n  E'er bent that fierce, inexorable heart!\n  While yet he trembled at his knees, and cried,\n  The ruthless falchion oped his tender side;\n  The panting liver pours a flood of gore\n  That drowns his bosom till he pants no more.\n\n  Through Mulius' head then drove the impetuous spear:\n  The warrior falls, transfix'd from ear to ear.\n  Thy life, Echeclus! next the sword bereaves,\n  Deep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves;\n  Warm'd in the brain the smoking weapon lies,\n  The purple death comes floating o'er his eyes.\n  Then brave Deucalion died: the dart was flung\n  Where the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung;\n  He dropp'd his arm, an unassisting weight,\n  And stood all impotent, expecting fate:\n  Full on his neck the falling falchion sped,\n  From his broad shoulders hew'd his crested head:\n  Forth from the bone the spinal marrow flies,\n  And, sunk in dust, the corpse extended lies.\n  Rhigmas, whose race from fruitful Thracia came,\n  (The son of Pierus, an illustrious name,)\n  Succeeds to fate: the spear his belly rends;\n  Prone from his car the thundering chief descends.\n  The squire, who saw expiring on the ground\n  His prostrate master, rein'd the steeds around;\n  His back, scarce turn'd, the Pelian javelin gored,\n  And stretch'd the servant o'er his dying lord.\n  As when a flame the winding valley fills,\n  And runs on crackling shrubs between the hills;\n  Then o'er the stubble up the mountain flies,\n  Fires the high woods, and blazes to the skies,\n  This way and that, the spreading torrent roars:\n  So sweeps the hero through the wasted shores;\n  Around him wide, immense destruction pours\n  And earth is deluged with the sanguine showers\n  As with autumnal harvests cover'd o'er,\n  And thick bestrewn, lies Ceres' sacred floor;\n  When round and round, with never-wearied pain,\n  The trampling steers beat out the unnumber'd grain:\n  So the fierce coursers, as the chariot rolls,\n  Tread down whole ranks, and crush out heroes' souls,\n  Dash'd from their hoofs while o'er the dead they fly,\n  Black, bloody drops the smoking chariot dye:\n  The spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore;\n  And thick the groaning axles dropp'd with gore.\n  High o'er the scene of death Achilles stood,\n  All grim with dust, all horrible in blood:\n  Yet still insatiate, still with rage on flame;\n  Such is the lust of never-dying fame!\n\n                         [Illustration: CENTAUR.]\n\n                                 CENTAUR.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXI.\n\n\nARGUMENT.\n\nTHE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.(269)\n\nThe Trojans fly before Achilles, some towards the town, others to the\nriver Scamander: he falls upon the latter with great slaughter: takes\ntwelve captives alive, to sacrifice to the shade of Patroclus; and kills\nLycaon and Asteropeus. Scamander attacks him with all his waves: Neptune\nand Pallas assist the hero: Simois joins Scamander: at length Vulcan, by\nthe instigation of Juno, almost dries up the river. This Combat ended, the\nother gods engage each other. Meanwhile Achilles continues the slaughter,\ndrives the rest into Troy: Agenor only makes a stand, and is conveyed away\nin a cloud by Apollo; who (to delude Achilles) takes upon him Agenor's\nshape, and while he pursues him in that disguise, gives the Trojans an\nopportunity of retiring into their city.\n\nThe same day continues. The scene is on the banks and in the stream of\nScamander.\n\n  And now to Xanthus' gliding stream they drove,\n  Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove.\n  The river here divides the flying train,\n  Part to the town fly diverse o'er the plain,\n  Where late their troops triumphant bore the fight,\n  Now chased, and trembling in ignoble flight:\n  (These with a gathered mist Saturnia shrouds,\n  And rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds:)\n  Part plunge into the stream: old Xanthus roars,\n  The flashing billows beat the whiten'd shores:\n  With cries promiscuous all the banks resound,\n  And here, and there, in eddies whirling round,\n  The flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown'd.\n  As the scorch'd locusts from their fields retire,\n  While fast behind them runs the blaze of fire;\n  Driven from the land before the smoky cloud,\n  The clustering legions rush into the flood:\n  So, plunged in Xanthus by Achilles' force,\n  Roars the resounding surge with men and horse.\n  His bloody lance the hero casts aside,\n  (Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,)\n  Then, like a god, the rapid billows braves,\n  Arm'd with his sword, high brandish'd o'er the waves:\n  Now down he plunges, now he whirls it round,\n  Deep groan'd the waters with the dying sound;\n  Repeated wounds the reddening river dyed,\n  And the warm purple circled on the tide.\n  Swift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly,\n  And close in rocks or winding caverns lie:\n  So the huge dolphin tempesting the main,\n  In shoals before him fly the scaly train,\n  Confusedly heap'd they seek their inmost caves,\n  Or pant and heave beneath the floating waves.\n  Now, tired with slaughter, from the Trojan band\n  Twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land;\n  With their rich belts their captive arms restrains\n  (Late their proud ornaments, but now their chains).\n  These his attendants to the ships convey'd,\n  Sad victims destined to Patroclus' shade;\n\n  Then, as once more he plunged amid the flood,\n  The young Lycaon in his passage stood;\n  The son of Priam; whom the hero's hand\n  But late made captive in his father's land\n  (As from a sycamore, his sounding steel\n  Lopp'd the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel)\n  To Lemnos' isle he sold the royal slave,\n  Where Jason's son the price demanded gave;\n  But kind Eetion, touching on the shore,\n  The ransom'd prince to fair Arisbe bore.\n  Ten days were past, since in his father's reign\n  He felt the sweets of liberty again;\n  The next, that god whom men in vain withstand\n  Gives the same youth to the same conquering hand\n  Now never to return! and doom'd to go\n  A sadder journey to the shades below.\n  His well-known face when great Achilles eyed,\n  (The helm and visor he had cast aside\n  With wild affright, and dropp'd upon the field\n  His useless lance and unavailing shield,)\n  As trembling, panting, from the stream he fled,\n  And knock'd his faltering knees, the hero said.\n  \"Ye mighty gods! what wonders strike my view!\n  Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?\n  Sure I shall see yon heaps of Trojans kill'd\n  Rise from the shades, and brave me on the field;\n  As now the captive, whom so late I bound\n  And sold to Lemnos, stalks on Trojan ground!\n  Not him the sea's unmeasured deeps detain,\n  That bar such numbers from their native plain;\n  Lo! he returns. Try, then, my flying spear!\n  Try, if the grave can hold the wanderer;\n  If earth, at length this active prince can seize,\n  Earth, whose strong grasp has held down Hercules.\"\n\n  Thus while he spoke, the Trojan pale with fears\n  Approach'd, and sought his knees with suppliant tears\n  Loth as he was to yield his youthful breath,\n  And his soul shivering at the approach of death.\n  Achilles raised the spear, prepared to wound;\n  He kiss'd his feet, extended on the ground:\n  And while, above, the spear suspended stood,\n  Longing to dip its thirsty point in blood,\n  One hand embraced them close, one stopp'd the dart,\n  While thus these melting words attempt his heart:\n\n  \"Thy well-known captive, great Achilles! see,\n  Once more Lycaon trembles at thy knee.\n  Some pity to a suppliant's name afford,\n  Who shared the gifts of Ceres at thy board;\n  Whom late thy conquering arm to Lemnos bore,\n  Far from his father, friends, and native shore;\n  A hundred oxen were his price that day,\n  Now sums immense thy mercy shall repay.\n  Scarce respited from woes I yet appear,\n  And scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here;\n  Lo!

'tis my doom to die!\n  If ever yet soft pity touch'd thy mind,\n  Ah! think not me too much of Hector's kind!\n  Not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath,\n  With his, who wrought thy loved Patroclus' death.\"\n\n  These words, attended with a shower of tears,\n  The youth address'd to unrelenting ears:\n  \"Talk not of life, or ransom (he replies):\n  Patroclus dead, whoever meets me, dies:\n  In vain a single Trojan sues for grace;\n  But least, the sons of Priam's hateful race.\n  Die then, my friend! what boots it to deplore?\n  The great, the good Patroclus is no more!\n  He, far thy better, was foredoom'd to die,\n  And thou, dost thou bewail mortality?\n  Seest thou not me, whom nature's gifts adorn,\n  Sprung from a hero, from a goddess born?\n  The day shall come (which nothing can avert)\n  When by the spear, the arrow, or the dart,\n  By night, or day, by force, or by design,\n  Impending death and certain fate are mine!\n  Die then,\"--He said; and as the word he spoke,\n  The fainting stripling sank before the stroke:\n  His hand forgot its grasp, and left the spear,\n  While all his trembling frame confess'd his fear:\n  Sudden, Achilles his broad sword display'd,\n  And buried in his neck the reeking blade.\n  Prone fell the youth; and panting on the land,\n  The gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand.\n  The victor to the stream the carcase gave,\n  And thus insults him, floating on the wave:\n\n  \"Lie there, Lycaon! let the fish surround\n  Thy bloated corpse, and suck thy gory wound:\n  There no sad mother shall thy funerals weep,\n  But swift Scamander roll thee to the deep,\n  Whose every wave some watery monster brings,\n  To feast unpunish'd on the fat of kings.\n  So perish Troy, and all the Trojan line!\n  Such ruin theirs, and such compassion mine.\n  What boots ye now Scamander's worshipp'd stream,\n  His earthly honours, and immortal name?\n  In vain your immolated bulls are slain,\n  Your living coursers glut his gulfs in vain!\n  Thus he rewards you, with this bitter fate;\n  Thus, till the Grecian vengeance is complete:\n  Thus is atoned Patroclus' honour'd shade,\n  And the short absence of Achilles paid.\"\n\n  These boastful words provoked the raging god;\n  With fury swells the violated flood.\n  What means divine may yet the power employ\n  To check Achilles, and to rescue Troy?\n  Meanwhile the hero springs in arms, to dare\n  The great Asteropeus to mortal war;\n  The son of Pelagon, whose lofty line\n  Flows from the source of Axius, stream divine!\n  (Fair Peribaea's love the god had crown'd,\n  With all his refluent waters circled round:)\n  On him Achilles rush'd; he fearless stood,\n  And shook two spears, advancing from the flood;\n  The flood impell'd him, on Pelides' head\n  To avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead.\n  Near as they drew, Achilles thus began:\n\n  \"What art thou, boldest of the race of man?\n  Who, or from whence? Unhappy is the sire\n  Whose son encounters our resistless ire.\"\n\n  \"O son of Peleus! what avails to trace\n  (Replied the warrior) our illustrious race?\n  From rich Paeonia's valleys I command,\n  Arm'd with protended spears, my native band;\n  Now shines the tenth bright morning since I came\n  In aid of Ilion to the fields of fame:\n  Axius, who swells with all the neighbouring rills,\n  And wide around the floated region fills,\n  Begot my sire, whose spear much glory won:\n  Now lift thy arm, and try that hero's son!\"\n\n  Threatening he said: the hostile chiefs advance;\n  At once Asteropeus discharged each lance,\n  (For both his dexterous hands the lance could wield,)\n  One struck, but pierced not, the Vulcanian shield;\n  One razed Achilles' hand; the spouting blood\n  Spun forth; in earth the fasten'd weapon stood.\n  Like lightning next the Pelean javelin flies:\n  Its erring fury hiss'd along the skies;\n  Deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear,\n  Even to the middle earth; and quiver'd there.\n  Then from his side the sword Pelides drew,\n  And on his foe with double fury flew.\n  The foe thrice tugg'd, and shook the rooted wood;\n  Repulsive of his might the weapon stood:\n  The fourth, he tries to break the spear in vain;\n  Bent as he stands, he tumbles to the plain;\n  His belly open'd with a ghastly wound,\n  The reeking entrails pour upon the ground.\n  Beneath the hero's feet he panting lies,\n  And his eye darkens, and his spirit flies;\n  While the proud victor thus triumphing said,\n  His radiant armour tearing from the dead:\n\n  \"So ends thy glory! Such the fate they prove,\n  Who strive presumptuous with the sons of Jove!\n  Sprung from a river, didst thou boast thy line?\n  But great Saturnius is the source of mine.\n  How durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny?\n  Of Peleus, AEacus, and Jove, am I.\n  The race of these superior far to those,\n  As he that thunders to the stream that flows.\n  What rivers can, Scamander might have shown;\n  But Jove he dreads, nor wars against his son.\n  Even Achelous might contend in vain,\n  And all the roaring billows of the main.\n  The eternal ocean, from whose fountains flow\n  The seas, the rivers, and the springs below,\n  The thundering voice of Jove abhors to hear,\n  And in his deep abysses shakes with fear.\"\n\n  He said: then from the bank his javelin tore,\n  And left the breathless warrior in his gore.\n  The floating tides the bloody carcase lave,\n  And beat against it, wave succeeding wave;\n  Till, roll'd between the banks, it lies the food\n  Of curling eels, and fishes of the flood.\n  All scatter'd round the stream (their mightiest slain)\n  The amazed Paeonians scour along the plain;\n  He vents his fury on the flying crew,\n  Thrasius, Astyplus, and Mnesus slew;\n  Mydon, Thersilochus, with AEnius, fell;\n  And numbers more his lance had plunged to hell,\n  But from the bottom of his gulfs profound\n  Scamander spoke; the shores return'd the sound.\n\n  \"O first of mortals! (for the gods are thine)\n  In valour matchless, and in force divine!\n  If Jove have given thee every Trojan head,\n  'Tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead.\n  See! my choked streams no more their course can keep,\n  Nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep.\n  Turn then, impetuous! from our injured flood;\n  Content, thy slaughters could amaze a god.\"\n\n  In human form, confess'd before his eyes,\n  The river thus; and thus the chief replies:\n  \"O sacred stream! thy word we shall obey;\n  But not till Troy the destined vengeance pay,\n  Not till within her towers the perjured train\n  Shall pant, and tremble at our arms again;\n  Not till proud Hector, guardian of her wall,\n  Or stain this lance, or see Achilles fall.\"\n\n  He said; and drove with fury on the foe.\n  Then to the godhead of the silver bow\n  The yellow flood began: \"O son of Jove!\n  Was not the mandate of the sire above\n  Full and express, that Phoebus should employ\n  His sacred arrows in defence of Troy,\n  And make her conquer, till Hyperion's fall\n  In awful darkness hide the face of all?\"\n\n  He spoke in vain--The chief without dismay\n  Ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way.\n  Then rising in his rage above the shores,\n  From all his deep the bellowing river roars,\n  Huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast,\n  And round the banks the ghastly dead are toss'd.\n  While all before, the billows ranged on high,\n  (A watery bulwark,) screen the bands who fly.\n  Now bursting on his head with thundering sound,\n  The falling deluge whelms the hero round:\n  His loaded shield bends to the rushing tide;\n  His feet, upborne, scarce the strong flood divide,\n  Sliddering, and staggering. On the border stood\n  A spreading elm, that overhung the flood;\n  He seized a bending bough, his steps to stay;\n  The plant uprooted to his weight gave way.(270)\n  Heaving the bank, and undermining all;\n  Loud flash the waters to the rushing fall\n  Of the thick foliage. The large trunk display'd\n  Bridged the rough flood across: the hero stay'd\n  On this his weight, and raised upon his hand,\n  Leap'd from the channel, and regain'd the land.\n  Then blacken'd the wild waves: the murmur rose:\n  The god pursues, a huger billow throws,\n  And bursts the bank, ambitious to destroy\n  The man whose fury is the fate of Troy.\n  He like the warlike eagle speeds his pace\n  (Swiftest and strongest of the aerial race);\n  Far as a spear can fly, Achilles springs;\n  At every bound his clanging armour rings:\n  Now here, now there, he turns on every side,\n  And winds his course before the following tide;\n  The waves flow after, wheresoe'er he wheels,\n  And gather fast, and murmur at his heels.\n  So when a peasant to his garden brings\n  Soft rills of water from the bubbling springs,\n  And calls the floods from high, to bless his bowers,\n  And feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers:\n  Soon as he clears whate'er their passage stay'd,\n  And marks the future current with his spade,\n  Swift o'er the rolling pebbles, down the hills,\n  Louder and louder purl the falling rills;\n  Before him scattering, they prevent his pains,\n  And shine in mazy wanderings o'er the plains.\n\n  Still flies Achilles, but before his eyes\n  Still swift Scamander rolls where'er he flies:\n  Not all his speed escapes the rapid floods;\n  The first of men, but not a match for gods.\n  Oft as he turn'd the torrent to oppose,\n  And bravely try if all the powers were foes;\n  So oft the surge, in watery mountains spread,\n  Beats on his back, or bursts upon his head.\n  Yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves,\n  And still indignant bounds above the waves.\n  Tired by the tides, his knees relax with toil;\n  Wash'd from beneath him slides the slimy soil;\n  When thus (his eyes on heaven's expansion thrown)\n  Forth bursts the hero with an angry groan:\n\n  \"Is there no god Achilles to befriend,\n  No power to avert his miserable end?\n  Prevent, O Jove! this ignominious date,(271)\n  And make my future life the sport of fate.\n  Of all heaven's oracles believed in vain,\n  But most of Thetis must her son complain;\n  By Phoebus' darts she prophesied my fall,\n  In glorious arms before the Trojan wall.\n  Oh! had I died in fields of battle warm,\n  Stretch'd like a hero, by a hero's arm!\n  Might Hector's spear this dauntless bosom rend,\n  And my swift soul o'ertake my slaughter'd friend.\n  Ah no! Achilles meets a shameful fate,\n  Oh how unworthy of the brave and great!\n  Like some vile swain, whom on a rainy day,\n  Crossing a ford, the torrent sweeps away,\n  An unregarded carcase to the sea.\"\n\n  Neptune and Pallas haste to his relief,\n  And thus in human form address'd the chief:\n  The power of ocean first: \"Forbear thy fear,\n  O son of Peleus! Lo, thy gods appear!\n  Behold! from Jove descending to thy aid,\n  Propitious Neptune, and the blue-eyed maid.\n  Stay, and the furious flood shall cease to rave\n  'Tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave.\n  But thou, the counsel heaven suggests, attend!\n  Nor breathe from combat, nor thy sword suspend,\n  Till Troy receive her flying sons, till all\n  Her routed squadrons pant behind their wall:\n  Hector alone shall stand his fatal chance,\n  And Hector's blood shall smoke upon thy lance.\n  Thine is the glory doom'd.\" Thus spake the gods:\n  Then swift ascended to the bright abodes.\n\n  Stung with new ardour, thus by heaven impell'd,\n  He springs impetuous, and invades the field:\n  O'er all the expanded plain the waters spread;\n  Heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead,\n  Floating 'midst scatter'd arms; while casques of gold\n  And turn'd-up bucklers glitter'd as they roll'd.\n  High o'er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds,\n  He wades, and mounts; the parted wave resounds.\n  Not a whole river stops the hero's course,\n  While Pallas fills him with immortal force.\n  With equal rage, indignant Xanthus roars,\n  And lifts his billows, and o'erwhelms his shores.\n\n  Then thus to Simois! \"Haste, my brother flood;\n  And check this mortal that controls a god;\n  Our bravest heroes else shall quit the fight,\n  And Ilion tumble from her towery height.\n  Call then thy subject streams, and bid them roar,\n  From all thy fountains swell thy watery store,\n  With broken rocks, and with a load of dead,\n  Charge the black surge, and pour it on his head.\n  Mark how resistless through the floods he goes,\n  And boldly bids the warring gods be foes!\n  But nor that force, nor form divine to sight,\n  Shall aught avail him, if our rage unite:\n  Whelm'd under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie,\n  That blaze so dreadful in each Trojan eye;\n  And deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl'd,\n  Immersed remain this terror of the world.\n  Such ponderous ruin shall confound the place,\n  No Greeks shall e'er his perish'd relics grace,\n  No hand his bones shall gather, or inhume;\n  These his cold rites, and this his watery tomb.\"\n\n           [Illustration: ACHILLES CONTENDING WITH THE RIVERS.]\n\n                   ACHILLES CONTENDING WITH THE RIVERS.\n\n\n  He said; and on the chief descends amain,\n  Increased with gore, and swelling with the slain.\n  Then, murmuring from his beds, he boils, he raves,\n  And a foam whitens on the purple waves:\n  At every step, before Achilles stood\n  The crimson surge, and deluged him with blood.\n  Fear touch'd the queen of heaven: she saw dismay'd,\n  She call'd aloud, and summon'd Vulcan's aid.\n\n  \"Rise to the war! the insulting flood requires\n  Thy wasteful arm! assemble all thy fires!\n  While to their aid, by our command enjoin'd,\n  Rush the swift eastern and the western wind:\n  These from old ocean at my word shall blow,\n  Pour the red torrent on the watery foe,\n  Corses and arms to one bright ruin turn,\n  And hissing rivers to their bottoms burn.\n  Go, mighty in thy rage! display thy power,\n  Drink the whole flood, the crackling trees devour.\n  Scorch all the banks! and (till our voice reclaim)\n  Exert the unwearied furies of the flame!\"\n\n  The power ignipotent her word obeys:\n  Wide o'er the plain he pours the boundless blaze;\n  At once consumes the dead, and dries the soil\n  And the shrunk waters in their channel boil.\n  As when autumnal Boreas sweeps the sky,\n  And instant blows the water'd gardens dry:\n  So look'd the field, so whiten'd was the ground,\n  While Vulcan breathed the fiery blast around.\n  Swift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys;\n  Along the margin winds the running blaze:\n  The trees in flaming rows to ashes turn,\n  The flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn,\n  Broad elm, and cypress rising in a spire;\n  The watery willows hiss before the fire.\n  Now glow the waves, the fishes pant for breath,\n  The eels lie twisting in the pangs of death:\n  Now flounce aloft, now dive the scaly fry,\n  Or, gasping, turn their bellies to the sky.\n  At length the river rear'd his languid head,\n  And thus, short-panting, to the god he said:\n\n  \"Oh Vulcan! oh! what power resists thy might?\n  I faint, I sink, unequal to the fight--\n  I yield--Let Ilion fall; if fate decree--\n  Ah--bend no more thy fiery arms on me!\"\n\n  He ceased; wide conflagration blazing round;\n  The bubbling waters yield a hissing sound.\n  As when the flames beneath a cauldron rise,(272)\n  To melt the fat of some rich sacrifice,\n  Amid the fierce embrace of circling fires\n  The waters foam, the heavy smoke aspires:\n  So boils the imprison'd flood, forbid to flow,\n  And choked with vapours feels his bottom glow.\n  To Juno then, imperial queen of air,\n  The burning river sends his earnest prayer:\n\n  \"Ah why, Saturnia; must thy son engage\n  Me, only me, with all his wasteful rage?\n  On other gods his dreadful arm employ,\n  For mightier gods assert the cause of Troy.\n  Submissive I desist, if thou command;\n  But ah! withdraw this all-destroying hand.\n  Hear then my solemn oath, to yield to fate\n  Unaided Ilion, and her destined state,\n  Till Greece shall gird her with destructive flame,\n  And in one ruin sink the Trojan name.\"\n\n  His warm entreaty touch'd Saturnia's ear:\n  She bade the ignipotent his rage forbear,\n  Recall the flame, nor in a mortal cause\n  Infest a god: the obedient flame withdraws:\n  Again the branching streams begin to spread,\n  And soft remurmur in their wonted bed.\n\n  While these by Juno's will the strife resign,\n  The warring gods in fierce contention join:\n  Rekindling rage each heavenly breast alarms:\n  With horrid clangour shock the ethereal arms:\n  Heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound;\n  And wide beneath them groans the rending ground.\n  Jove, as his sport, the dreadful scene descries,\n  And views contending gods with careless eyes.\n  The power of battles lifts his brazen spear,\n  And first assaults the radiant queen of war:\n\n  \"What moved thy madness, thus to disunite\n  Ethereal minds, and mix all heaven in fight?\n  What wonder this, when in thy frantic mood\n  Thou drovest a mortal to insult a god?\n  Thy impious hand Tydides' javelin bore,\n  And madly bathed it in celestial gore.\"\n\n  He spoke, and smote the long-resounding shield,\n  Which bears Jove's thunder on its dreadful field:\n  The adamantine aegis of her sire,\n  That turns the glancing bolt and forked fire.\n\n  Then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand\n  A stone, the limit of the neighbouring land,\n  There fix'd from eldest times; black, craggy, vast;\n  This at the heavenly homicide she cast.\n  Thundering he falls, a mass of monstrous size:\n  And seven broad acres covers as he lies.\n  The stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound:\n  Loud o'er the fields his ringing arms resound:\n  The scornful dame her conquest views with smiles,\n  And, glorying, thus the prostrate god reviles:\n\n  \"Hast thou not yet, insatiate fury! known\n  How far Minerva's force transcends thy own?\n  Juno, whom thou rebellious darest withstand,\n  Corrects thy folly thus by Pallas' hand;\n  Thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace,\n  And partial aid to Troy's perfidious race.\"\n\n  The goddess spoke, and turn'd her eyes away,\n  That, beaming round, diffused celestial day.\n  Jove's Cyprian daughter, stooping on the land,\n  Lent to the wounded god her tender hand:\n  Slowly he rises, scarcely breathes with pain,\n  And, propp'd on her fair arm, forsakes the plain.\n  This the bright empress of the heavens survey'd,\n  And, scoffing, thus to war's victorious maid:\n\n  \"Lo! what an aid on Mars's side is seen!\n  The smiles' and loves' unconquerable queen!\n  Mark with what insolence, in open view,\n  She moves: let Pallas, if she dares, pursue.\"\n\n  Minerva smiling heard, the pair o'ertook,\n  And slightly on her breast the wanton strook:\n  She, unresisting, fell (her spirits fled);\n  On earth together lay the lovers spread.\n  \"And like these heroes be the fate of all\n  (Minerva cries) who guard the Trojan wall!\n  To Grecian gods such let the Phrygian be,\n  So dread, so fierce, as Venus is to me;\n  Then from the lowest stone shall Troy be moved.\"\n  Thus she, and Juno with a smile approved.\n\n  Meantime, to mix in more than mortal fight,\n  The god of ocean dares the god of light.\n  \"What sloth has seized us, when the fields around\n  Ring with conflicting powers, and heaven returns the sound:\n  Shall, ignominious, we with shame retire,\n  No deed perform'd, to our Olympian sire?\n  Come, prove thy arm!

Calamitous by birth,\n  They owe their life and nourishment to earth;\n  Like yearly leaves, that now, with beauty crown'd,\n  Smile on the sun; now, wither on the ground.\n  To their own hands commit the frantic scene,\n  Nor mix immortals in a cause so mean.\"\n\n  Then turns his face, far-beaming heavenly fires,\n  And from the senior power submiss retires:\n  Him thus retreating, Artemis upbraids,\n  The quiver'd huntress of the sylvan shades:\n\n  \"And is it thus the youthful Phoebus flies,\n  And yields to ocean's hoary sire the prize?\n  How vain that martial pomp, and dreadful show\n  Of pointed arrows and the silver bow!\n  Now boast no more in yon celestial bower,\n  Thy force can match the great earth-shaking power.\"\n\n  Silent he heard the queen of woods upbraid:\n  Not so Saturnia bore the vaunting maid:\n  But furious thus: \"What insolence has driven\n  Thy pride to face the majesty of heaven?\n  What though by Jove the female plague design'd,\n  Fierce to the feeble race of womankind,\n  The wretched matron feels thy piercing dart;\n  Thy sex's tyrant, with a tiger's heart?\n  What though tremendous in the woodland chase\n  Thy certain arrows pierce the savage race?\n  How dares thy rashness on the powers divine\n  Employ those arms, or match thy force with mine?\n  Learn hence, no more unequal war to wage--\"\n  She said, and seized her wrists with eager rage;\n  These in her left hand lock'd, her right untied\n  The bow, the quiver, and its plumy pride.\n  About her temples flies the busy bow;\n  Now here, now there, she winds her from the blow;\n  The scattering arrows, rattling from the case,\n  Drop round, and idly mark the dusty place.\n  Swift from the field the baffled huntress flies,\n  And scarce restrains the torrent in her eyes:\n  So, when the falcon wings her way above,\n  To the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove;\n  (Not fated yet to die;) there safe retreats,\n  Yet still her heart against the marble beats.\n\n  To her Latona hastes with tender care;\n  Whom Hermes viewing, thus declines the war:\n  \"How shall I face the dame, who gives delight\n  To him whose thunders blacken heaven with night?\n  Go, matchless goddess! triumph in the skies,\n  And boast my conquest, while I yield the prize.\"\n\n  He spoke; and pass'd: Latona, stooping low,\n  Collects the scatter'd shafts and fallen bow,\n  That, glittering on the dust, lay here and there\n  Dishonour'd relics of Diana's war:\n  Then swift pursued her to her blest abode,\n  Where, all confused, she sought the sovereign god;\n  Weeping, she grasp'd his knees: the ambrosial vest\n  Shook with her sighs, and panted on her breast.\n\n  The sire superior smiled, and bade her show\n  What heavenly hand had caused his daughter's woe?\n  Abash'd, she names his own imperial spouse;\n  And the pale crescent fades upon her brows.\n\n  Thus they above: while, swiftly gliding down,\n  Apollo enters Ilion's sacred town;\n  The guardian-god now trembled for her wall,\n  And fear'd the Greeks, though fate forbade her fall.\n  Back to Olympus, from the war's alarms,\n  Return the shining bands of gods in arms;\n  Some proud in triumph, some with rage on fire;\n  And take their thrones around the ethereal sire.\n\n  Through blood, through death, Achilles still proceeds,\n  O'er slaughter'd heroes, and o'er rolling steeds.\n  As when avenging flames with fury driven\n  On guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven;\n  The pale inhabitants, some fall, some fly;\n  And the red vapours purple all the sky:\n  So raged Achilles: death and dire dismay,\n  And toils, and terrors, fill'd the dreadful day.\n\n  High on a turret hoary Priam stands,\n  And marks the waste of his destructive hands;\n  Views, from his arm, the Trojans' scatter'd flight,\n  And the near hero rising on his sight!\n  No stop, no check, no aid! With feeble pace,\n  And settled sorrow on his aged face,\n  Fast as he could, he sighing quits the walls;\n  And thus descending, on the guards he calls:\n\n  \"You to whose care our city-gates belong,\n  Set wide your portals to the flying throng:\n  For lo! he comes, with unresisted sway;\n  He comes, and desolation marks his way!\n  But when within the walls our troops take breath,\n  Lock fast the brazen bars, and shut out death.\"\n  Thus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flung\n  The opening folds; the sounding hinges rung.\n  Phoebus rush'd forth, the flying bands to meet;\n  Struck slaughter back, and cover'd the retreat,\n  On heaps the Trojans crowd to gain the gate,\n  And gladsome see their last escape from fate.\n  Thither, all parch'd with thirst, a heartless train,\n  Hoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain:\n  And gasping, panting, fainting, labour on\n  With heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.\n  Enraged Achilles follows with his spear;\n  Wild with revenge, insatiable of war.\n\n  Then had the Greeks eternal praise acquired,\n  And Troy inglorious to her walls retired;\n  But he, the god who darts ethereal flame,\n  Shot down to save her, and redeem her fame:\n  To young Agenor force divine he gave;\n  (Antenor's offspring, haughty, bold, and brave;)\n  In aid of him, beside the beech he sate,\n  And wrapt in clouds, restrain'd the hand of fate.\n  When now the generous youth Achilles spies.\n  Thick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.\n  (So, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.)\n  He stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;\n\n  \"What, shall I fly this terror of the plain!\n  Like others fly, and be like others slain?\n  Vain hope! to shun him by the self-same road\n  Yon line of slaughter'd Trojans lately trod.\n  No: with the common heap I scorn to fall--\n  What if they pass'd me to the Trojan wall,\n  While I decline to yonder path, that leads\n  To Ida's forests and surrounding shades?\n  So may I reach, conceal'd, the cooling flood,\n  From my tired body wash the dirt and blood,\n  As soon as night her dusky veil extends,\n  Return in safety to my Trojan friends.\n  What if?--But wherefore all this vain debate?\n  Stand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?\n  Even now perhaps, ere yet I turn the wall,\n  The fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall:\n  Such is his swiftness, 'tis in vain to fly,\n  And such his valour, that who stands must die.\n  Howe'er 'tis better, fighting for the state,\n  Here, and in public view, to meet my fate.\n  Yet sure he too is mortal; he may feel\n  (Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.\n  One only soul informs that dreadful frame:\n  And Jove's sole favour gives him all his fame.\"\n\n  He said, and stood, collected, in his might;\n  And all his beating bosom claim'd the fight.\n  So from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,\n  Roused from his thicket by a storm of darts:\n  Untaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds\n  Of shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds;\n  Though struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain;\n  And the barb'd javelin stings his breast in vain:\n  On their whole war, untamed, the savage flies;\n  And tears his hunter, or beneath him dies.\n  Not less resolved, Antenor's valiant heir\n  Confronts Achilles, and awaits the war,\n  Disdainful of retreat: high held before,\n  His shield (a broad circumference) he bore;\n  Then graceful as he stood, in act to throw\n  The lifted javelin, thus bespoke the foe:\n\n  \"How proud Achilles glories in his fame!\n  And hopes this day to sink the Trojan name\n  Beneath her ruins! Know, that hope is vain;\n  A thousand woes, a thousand toils remain.\n  Parents and children our just arms employ,\n  And strong and many are the sons of Troy.\n  Great as thou art, even thou may'st stain with gore\n  These Phrygian fields, and press a foreign shore.\"\n\n  He said: with matchless force the javelin flung\n  Smote on his knee; the hollow cuishes rung\n  Beneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms\n  He stands impassive in the ethereal arms.\n  Then fiercely rushing on the daring foe,\n  His lifted arm prepares the fatal blow:\n  But, jealous of his fame, Apollo shrouds\n  The god-like Trojan in a veil of clouds.\n  Safe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view,\n  Dismiss'd with fame, the favoured youth withdrew.\n  Meanwhile the god, to cover their escape,\n  Assumes Agenor's habit, voice and shape,\n  Flies from the furious chief in this disguise;\n  The furious chief still follows where he flies.\n  Now o'er the fields they stretch with lengthen'd strides,\n  Now urge the course where swift Scamander glides:\n  The god, now distant scarce a stride before,\n  Tempts his pursuit, and wheels about the shore;\n  While all the flying troops their speed employ,\n  And pour on heaps into the walls of Troy:\n  No stop, no stay; no thought to ask, or tell,\n  Who 'scaped by flight, or who by battle fell.\n  'Twas tumult all, and violence of flight;\n  And sudden joy confused, and mix'd affright.\n  Pale Troy against Achilles shuts her gate:\n  And nations breathe, deliver'd from their fate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXII.\n\n\nARGUMENT.\n\nTHE DEATH OF HECTOR.\n\nThe Trojans being safe within the walls, Hector only stays to oppose\nAchilles. Priam is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his son\nto re-enter the town. Hecuba joins her entreaties, but in vain. Hector\nconsults within himself what measures to take; but at the advance of\nAchilles, his resolution fails him, and he flies. Achilles pursues him\nthrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerning the fate of\nHector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles. She deludes\nHector in the shape of Deiphobus; he stands the combat, and is slain.\nAchilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of Priam and\nHecuba. Their lamentations, tears, and despair. Their cries reach the ears\nof Andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired into the inner part of\nthe palace: she mounts up to the walls, and beholds her dead husband. She\nswoons at the spectacle. Her excess of grief and lamentation.\n\nThe thirtieth day still continues. The scene lies under the walls, and on\nthe battlements of Troy.\n\n  Thus to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear,\n  The herded Ilians rush like driven deer:\n  There safe they wipe the briny drops away,\n  And drown in bowls the labours of the day.\n  Close to the walls, advancing o'er the fields\n  Beneath one roof of well-compacted shields,\n  March, bending on, the Greeks' embodied powers,\n  Far stretching in the shade of Trojan towers.\n  Great Hector singly stay'd: chain'd down by fate\n  There fix'd he stood before the Scaean gate;\n  Still his bold arms determined to employ,\n  The guardian still of long-defended Troy.\n\n  Apollo now to tired Achilles turns:\n  (The power confess'd in all his glory burns:)\n  \"And what (he cries) has Peleus' son in view,\n  With mortal speed a godhead to pursue?\n  For not to thee to know the gods is given,\n  Unskill'd to trace the latent marks of heaven.\n  What boots thee now, that Troy forsook the plain?\n  Vain thy past labour, and thy present vain:\n  Safe in their walls are now her troops bestow'd,\n  While here thy frantic rage attacks a god.\"\n\n  The chief incensed--\"Too partial god of day!\n  To check my conquests in the middle way:\n  How few in Ilion else had refuge found!\n  What gasping numbers now had bit the ground!\n  Thou robb'st me of a glory justly mine,\n  Powerful of godhead, and of fraud divine:\n  Mean fame, alas! for one of heavenly strain,\n  To cheat a mortal who repines in vain.\"\n\n  Then to the city, terrible and strong,\n  With high and haughty steps he tower'd along,\n  So the proud courser, victor of the prize,\n  To the near goal with double ardour flies.\n  Him, as he blazing shot across the field,\n  The careful eyes of Priam first beheld.\n  Not half so dreadful rises to the sight,(274)\n  Through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,\n  Orion's dog (the year when autumn weighs),\n  And o'er the feebler stars exerts his rays;\n  Terrific glory! for his burning breath\n  Taints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death.\n  So flamed his fiery mail. Then wept the sage:\n  He strikes his reverend head, now white with age;\n  He lifts his wither'd arms; obtests the skies;\n  He calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:\n  The son, resolved Achilles' force to dare,\n  Full at the Scaean gates expects the war;\n  While the sad father on the rampart stands,\n  And thus adjures him with extended hands:\n\n  \"Ah stay not, stay not! guardless and alone;\n  Hector! my loved, my dearest, bravest son!\n  Methinks already I behold thee slain,\n  And stretch'd beneath that fury of the plain.\n  Implacable Achilles! might'st thou be\n  To all the gods no dearer than to me!\n  Thee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore.\n  And bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.\n  How many valiant sons I late enjoy'd,\n  Valiant in vain! by thy cursed arm destroy'd:\n  Or, worse than slaughtered, sold in distant isles\n  To shameful bondage, and unworthy toils.\n  Two, while I speak, my eyes in vain explore,\n  Two from one mother sprung, my Polydore,\n  And loved Lycaon; now perhaps no more!\n  Oh! if in yonder hostile camp they live,\n  What heaps of gold, what treasures would I give!\n  (Their grandsire's wealth, by right of birth their own,\n  Consign'd his daughter with Lelegia's throne:)\n  But if (which Heaven forbid) already lost,\n  All pale they wander on the Stygian coast;\n  What sorrows then must their sad mother know,\n  What anguish I? unutterable woe!\n  Yet less that anguish, less to her, to me,\n  Less to all Troy, if not deprived of thee.\n  Yet shun Achilles! enter yet the wall;\n  And spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!\n  Save thy dear life; or, if a soul so brave\n  Neglect that thought, thy dearer glory save.\n  Pity, while yet I live, these silver hairs;\n  While yet thy father feels the woes he bears,\n  Yet cursed with sense! a wretch, whom in his rage\n  (All trembling on the verge of helpless age)\n  Great Jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!\n  The bitter dregs of fortune's cup to drain:\n  To fill with scenes of death his closing eyes,\n  And number all his days by miseries!\n  My heroes slain, my bridal bed o'erturn'd,\n  My daughters ravish'd, and my city burn'd,\n  My bleeding infants dash'd against the floor;\n  These I have yet to see, perhaps yet more!\n  Perhaps even I, reserved by angry fate,\n  The last sad relic of my ruin'd state,\n  (Dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!) must fall,\n  And stain the pavement of my regal hall;\n  Where famish'd dogs, late guardians of my door,\n  Shall lick their mangled master's spatter'd gore.\n  Yet for my sons I thank ye, gods! 'tis well;\n  Well have they perish'd, for in fight they fell.\n  Who dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,\n  Struck through with wounds, all honest on the breast.\n  But when the fates, in fulness of their rage,\n  Spurn the hoar head of unresisting age,\n  In dust the reverend lineaments deform,\n  And pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm:\n  This, this is misery! the last, the worse,\n  That man can feel! man, fated to be cursed!\"\n\n  He said, and acting what no words could say,\n  Rent from his head the silver locks away.\n  With him the mournful mother bears a part;\n  Yet all her sorrows turn not Hector's heart.\n  The zone unbraced, her bosom she display'd;\n  And thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:\n\n  \"Have mercy on me, O my son! revere\n  The words of age; attend a parent's prayer!\n  If ever thee in these fond arms I press'd,\n  Or still'd thy infant clamours at this breast;\n  Ah do not thus our helpless years forego,\n  But, by our walls secured, repel the foe.\n  Against his rage if singly thou proceed,\n  Should'st thou, (but Heaven avert it!) should'st thou bleed,\n  Nor must thy corse lie honour'd on the bier,\n  Nor spouse, nor mother, grace thee with a tear!\n  Far from our pious rites those dear remains\n  Must feast the vultures on the naked plains.\"\n\n  So they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll;\n  But fix'd remains the purpose of his soul;\n  Resolved he stands, and with a fiery glance\n  Expects the hero's terrible advance.\n  So, roll'd up in his den, the swelling snake\n  Beholds the traveller approach the brake;\n  When fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins\n  Have gather'd half the poisons of the plains;\n  He burns, he stiffens with collected ire,\n  And his red eyeballs glare with living fire.\n  Beneath a turret, on his shield reclined,\n  He stood, and question'd thus his mighty mind:(275)\n\n  \"Where lies my way? to enter in the wall?\n  Honour and shame the ungenerous thought recall:\n  Shall proud Polydamas before the gate\n  Proclaim, his counsels are obey'd too late,\n  Which timely follow'd but the former night,\n  What numbers had been saved by Hector's flight?\n  That wise advice rejected with disdain,\n  I feel my folly in my people slain.\n  Methinks my suffering country's voice I hear,\n  But most her worthless sons insult my ear,\n  On my rash courage charge the chance of war,\n  And blame those virtues which they cannot share.\n  No--if I e'er return, return I must\n  Glorious, my country's terror laid in dust:\n  Or if I perish, let her see me fall\n  In field at least, and fighting for her wall.\n  And yet suppose these measures I forego,\n  Approach unarm'd, and parley with the foe,\n  The warrior-shield, the helm, and lance, lay down.\n  And treat on terms of peace to save the town:\n  The wife withheld, the treasure ill-detain'd\n  (Cause of the war, and grievance of the land)\n  With honourable justice to restore:\n  And add half Ilion's yet remaining store,\n  Which Troy shall, sworn, produce; that injured Greece\n  May share our wealth, and leave our walls in peace.\n  But why this thought? Unarm'd if I should go,\n  What hope of mercy from this vengeful foe,\n  But woman-like to fall, and fall without a blow?\n  We greet not here, as man conversing man,\n  Met at an oak, or journeying o'er a plain;\n  No season now for calm familiar talk,\n  Like youths and maidens in an evening walk:\n  War is our business, but to whom is given\n  To die, or triumph, that, determine Heaven!\"\n\n  Thus pondering, like a god the Greek drew nigh;\n  His dreadful plumage nodded from on high;\n  The Pelian javelin, in his better hand,\n  Shot trembling rays that glitter'd o'er the land;\n  And on his breast the beamy splendour shone,\n  Like Jove's own lightning, or the rising sun.\n  As Hector sees, unusual terrors rise,\n  Struck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies.\n  He leaves the gates, he leaves the wall behind:\n  Achilles follows like the winged wind.\n  Thus at the panting dove a falcon flies\n  (The swiftest racer of the liquid skies),\n  Just when he holds, or thinks he holds his prey,\n  Obliquely wheeling through the aerial way,\n  With open beak and shrilling cries he springs,\n  And aims his claws, and shoots upon his wings:\n  No less fore-right the rapid chase they held,\n  One urged by fury, one by fear impell'd:\n  Now circling round the walls their course maintain,\n  Where the high watch-tower overlooks the plain;\n  Now where the fig-trees spread their umbrage broad,\n  (A wider compass,) smoke along the road.\n  Next by Scamander's double source they bound,\n  Where two famed fountains burst the parted ground;\n  This hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise,\n  With exhalations steaming to the skies;\n  That the green banks in summer's heat o'erflows,\n  Like crystal clear, and cold as winter snows:\n  Each gushing fount a marble cistern fills,\n  Whose polish'd bed receives the falling rills;\n  Where Trojan dames (ere yet alarm'd by Greece)\n  Wash'd their fair garments in the days of peace.(276)\n  By these they pass'd, one chasing, one in flight:\n  (The mighty fled, pursued by stronger might:)\n  Swift was the course; no vulgar prize they play,\n  No vulgar victim must reward the day:\n  (Such as in races crown the speedy strife:)\n  The prize contended was great Hector's life.\n  As when some hero's funerals are decreed\n  In grateful honour of the mighty dead;\n  Where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame\n  (Some golden tripod, or some lovely dame)\n  The panting coursers swiftly turn the goal,\n  And with them turns the raised spectator's soul:\n  Thus three times round the Trojan wall they fly.\n  The gazing gods lean forward from the sky;\n  To whom, while eager on the chase they look,\n  The sire of mortals and immortals spoke:\n\n  \"Unworthy sight! the man beloved of heaven,\n  Behold, inglorious round yon city driven!\n  My heart partakes the generous Hector's pain;\n  Hector, whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain,\n  Whose grateful fumes the gods received with joy,\n  From Ida's summits, and the towers of Troy:\n  Now see him flying; to his fears resign'd,\n  And fate, and fierce Achilles, close behind.\n  Consult, ye powers! ('tis worthy your debate)\n  Whether to snatch him from impending fate,\n  Or let him bear, by stern Pelides slain,\n  (Good as he is) the lot imposed on man.\"\n\n  Then Pallas thus: \"Shall he whose vengeance forms\n  The forky bolt, and blackens heaven with storms,\n  Shall he prolong one Trojan's forfeit breath?\n  A man, a mortal, pre-ordain'd to death!\n  And will no murmurs fill the courts above?\n  No gods indignant blame their partial Jove?\"\n\n  \"Go then (return'd the sire) without delay,\n  Exert thy will: I give the Fates their way.\n  Swift at the mandate pleased Tritonia flies,\n  And stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies.\n\n  As through the forest, o'er the vale and lawn,\n  The well-breath'd beagle drives the flying fawn,\n  In vain he tries the covert of the brakes,\n  Or deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes;\n  Sure of the vapour in the tainted dews,\n  The certain hound his various maze pursues.\n  Thus step by step, where'er the Trojan wheel'd,\n  There swift Achilles compass'd round the field.\n  Oft as to reach the Dardan gates he bends,\n  And hopes the assistance of his pitying friends,\n  (Whose showering arrows, as he coursed below,\n  From the high turrets might oppress the foe,)\n  So oft Achilles turns him to the plain:\n  He eyes the city, but he eyes in vain.\n  As men in slumbers seem with speedy pace,\n  One to pursue, and one to lead the chase,\n  Their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake,\n  Nor this can fly, nor that can overtake:\n  No less the labouring heroes pant and strain:\n  While that but flies, and this pursues in vain.\n\n  What god, O muse, assisted Hector's force\n  With fate itself so long to hold the course?\n  Phoebus it was; who, in his latest hour,\n  Endued his knees with strength, his nerves with power:\n  And great Achilles, lest some Greek's advance\n  Should snatch the glory from his lifted lance,\n  Sign'd to the troops to yield his foe the way,\n  And leave untouch'd the honours of the day.\n\n  Jove lifts the golden balances, that show\n  The fates of mortal men, and things below:\n  Here each contending hero's lot he tries,\n  And weighs, with equal hand, their destinies.\n  Low sinks the scale surcharged with Hector's fate;\n  Heavy with death it sinks, and hell receives the weight.\n\n  Then Phoebus left him. Fierce Minerva flies\n  To stern Pelides, and triumphing, cries:\n  \"O loved of Jove! this day our labours cease,\n  And conquest blazes with full beams on Greece.\n  Great Hector falls; that Hector famed so far,\n  Drunk with renown, insatiable of war,\n  Falls by thy hand, and mine! nor force, nor flight,\n  Shall more avail him, nor his god of light.\n  See, where in vain he supplicates above,\n  Roll'd at the feet of unrelenting Jove;\n  Rest here: myself will lead the Trojan on,\n  And urge to meet the fate he cannot shun.\"\n\n  Her voice divine the chief with joyful mind\n  Obey'd; and rested, on his lance reclined\n  While like Deiphobus the martial dame\n  (Her face, her gesture, and her arms the same),\n  In show an aid, by hapless Hector's side\n  Approach'd, and greets him thus with voice belied:\n\n  \"Too long, O Hector! have I borne the sight\n  Of this distress, and sorrow'd in thy flight:\n  It fits us now a noble stand to make,\n  And here, as brothers, equal fates partake.\"\n\n  Then he: \"O prince! allied in blood and fame,\n  Dearer than all that own a brother's name;\n  Of all that Hecuba to Priam bore,\n  Long tried, long loved: much loved, but honoured more!\n  Since you, of all our numerous race alone\n  Defend my life, regardless of your own.\"\n\n  Again the goddess: \"Much my father's prayer,\n  And much my mother's, press'd me to forbear:\n  My friends embraced my knees, adjured my stay,\n  But stronger love impell'd, and I obey.\n  Come then, the glorious conflict let us try,\n  Let the steel sparkle, and the javelin fly;\n  Or let us stretch Achilles on the field,\n  Or to his arm our bloody trophies yield.\"\n\n  Fraudful she said; then swiftly march'd before:\n  The Dardan hero shuns his foe no more.\n  Sternly they met. The silence Hector broke:\n  His dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:\n\n  \"Enough, O son of Peleus! Troy has view'd\n  Her walls thrice circled, and her chief pursued.\n  But now some god within me bids me try\n  Thine, or my fate: I kill thee, or I die.\n  Yet on the verge of battle let us stay,\n  And for a moment's space suspend the day;\n  Let Heaven's high powers be call'd to arbitrate\n  The just conditions of this stern debate,\n  (Eternal witnesses of all below,\n  And faithful guardians of the treasured vow!)\n  To them I swear; if, victor in the strife,\n  Jove by these hands shall shed thy noble life,\n  No vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue;\n  Stripp'd of its arms alone (the conqueror's due)\n  The rest to Greece uninjured I'll restore:\n  Now plight thy mutual oath, I ask no more.\"\n\n  \"Talk not of oaths (the dreadful chief replies,\n  While anger flash'd from his disdainful eyes),\n  Detested as thou art, and ought to be,\n  Nor oath nor pact Achilles plights with thee:\n  Such pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine,\n  Such leagues as men and furious lions join,\n  To such I call the gods! one constant state\n  Of lasting rancour and eternal hate:\n  No thought but rage, and never-ceasing strife,\n  Till death extinguish rage, and thought, and life.\n  Rouse then thy forces this important hour,\n  Collect thy soul, and call forth all thy power.\n  No further subterfuge, no further chance;\n  'Tis Pallas, Pallas gives thee to my lance.\n  Each Grecian ghost, by thee deprived of breath,\n  Now hovers round, and calls thee to thy death.\"\n\n  He spoke, and launch'd his javelin at the foe;\n  But Hector shunn'd the meditated blow:\n  He stoop'd, while o'er his head the flying spear\n  Sang innocent, and spent its force in air.\n  Minerva watch'd it falling on the land,\n  Then drew, and gave to great Achilles' hand,\n  Unseen of Hector, who, elate with joy,\n  Now shakes his lance, and braves the dread of Troy.\n\n  \"The life you boasted to that javelin given,\n  Prince! you have miss'd.

After the\nfuneral feast he retires to the sea-shore, where, falling asleep, the\nghost of his friend appears to him, and demands the rites of burial; the\nnext morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons to fetch wood\nfor the pyre. The funeral procession, and the offering their hair to the\ndead. Achilles sacrifices several animals, and lastly twelve Trojan\ncaptives, at the pile; then sets fire to it. He pays libations to the\nWinds, which (at the instance of Iris) rise, and raise the flames. When\nthe pile has burned all night, they gather the bones, place them in an urn\nof gold, and raise the tomb. Achilles institutes the funeral games: the\nchariot-race, the fight of the caestus, the wrestling, the foot-race, the\nsingle combat, the discus, the shooting with arrows, the darting the\njavelin: the various descriptions of which, and the various success of the\nseveral antagonists, make the greatest part of the book.\n\nIn this book ends the thirtieth day. The night following, the ghost of\nPatroclus appears to Achilles: the one-and-thirtieth day is employed in\nfelling the timber for the pile: the two-and-thirtieth in burning it; and\nthe three-and-thirtieth in the games. The scene is generally on the\nsea-shore.\n\n  Thus humbled in the dust, the pensive train\n  Through the sad city mourn'd her hero slain.\n  The body soil'd with dust, and black with gore,\n  Lies on broad Hellespont's resounding shore.\n  The Grecians seek their ships, and clear the strand,\n  All, but the martial Myrmidonian band:\n  These yet assembled great Achilles holds,\n  And the stern purpose of his mind unfolds:\n\n  \"Not yet, my brave companions of the war,\n  Release your smoking coursers from the car;\n  But, with his chariot each in order led,\n  Perform due honours to Patroclus dead.\n  Ere yet from rest or food we seek relief,\n  Some rites remain, to glut our rage of grief.\"\n\n  The troops obey'd; and thrice in order led(281)\n  (Achilles first) their coursers round the dead;\n  And thrice their sorrows and laments renew;\n  Tears bathe their arms, and tears the sands bedew.\n  For such a warrior Thetis aids their woe,\n  Melts their strong hearts, and bids their eyes to flow.\n  But chief, Pelides: thick-succeeding sighs\n  Burst from his heart, and torrents from his eyes:\n  His slaughtering hands, yet red with blood, he laid\n  On his dead friend's cold breast, and thus he said:\n\n  \"All hail, Patroclus! let thy honour'd ghost\n  Hear, and rejoice on Pluto's dreary coast;\n  Behold! Achilles' promise is complete;\n  The bloody Hector stretch'd before thy feet.\n  Lo! to the dogs his carcase I resign;\n  And twelve sad victims, of the Trojan line,\n  Sacred to vengeance, instant shall expire;\n  Their lives effused around thy funeral pyre.\"\n\n  Gloomy he said, and (horrible to view)\n  Before the bier the bleeding Hector threw,\n  Prone on the dust. The Myrmidons around\n  Unbraced their armour, and the steeds unbound.\n  All to Achilles' sable ship repair,\n  Frequent and full, the genial feast to share.\n  Now from the well-fed swine black smokes aspire,\n  The bristly victims hissing o'er the fire:\n  The huge ox bellowing falls; with feebler cries\n  Expires the goat; the sheep in silence dies.\n  Around the hero's prostrate body flow'd,\n  In one promiscuous stream, the reeking blood.\n  And now a band of Argive monarchs brings\n  The glorious victor to the king of kings.\n  From his dead friend the pensive warrior went,\n  With steps unwilling, to the regal tent.\n  The attending heralds, as by office bound,\n  With kindled flames the tripod-vase surround:\n  To cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore,\n  They urged in vain; the chief refused, and swore:(282)\n\n  \"No drop shall touch me, by almighty Jove!\n  The first and greatest of the gods above!\n  Till on the pyre I place thee; till I rear\n  The grassy mound, and clip thy sacred hair.\n  Some ease at least those pious rites may give,\n  And soothe my sorrows, while I bear to live.\n  Howe'er, reluctant as I am, I stay\n  And share your feast; but with the dawn of day,\n  (O king of men!) it claims thy royal care,\n  That Greece the warrior's funeral pile prepare,\n  And bid the forests fall: (such rites are paid\n  To heroes slumbering in eternal shade:)\n  Then, when his earthly part shall mount in fire,\n  Let the leagued squadrons to their posts retire.\"\n\n  He spoke: they hear him, and the word obey;\n  The rage of hunger and of thirst allay,\n  Then ease in sleep the labours of the day.\n  But great Pelides, stretch'd along the shore,\n  Where, dash'd on rocks, the broken billows roar,\n  Lies inly groaning; while on either hand\n  The martial Myrmidons confusedly stand.\n  Along the grass his languid members fall,\n  Tired with his chase around the Trojan wall;\n  Hush'd by the murmurs of the rolling deep,\n  At length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep.\n  When lo! the shade, before his closing eyes,\n  Of sad Patroclus rose, or seem'd to rise:\n  In the same robe he living wore, he came:\n  In stature, voice, and pleasing look, the same.\n  The form familiar hover'd o'er his head,\n  \"And sleeps Achilles? (thus the phantom said:)\n  Sleeps my Achilles, his Patroclus dead?\n  Living, I seem'd his dearest, tenderest care,\n  But now forgot, I wander in the air.\n  Let my pale corse the rites of burial know,\n  And give me entrance in the realms below:\n  Till then the spirit finds no resting-place,\n  But here and there the unbodied spectres chase\n  The vagrant dead around the dark abode,\n  Forbid to cross the irremeable flood.\n  Now give thy hand; for to the farther shore\n  When once we pass, the soul returns no more:\n  When once the last funereal flames ascend,\n  No more shall meet Achilles and his friend;\n  No more our thoughts to those we loved make known;\n  Or quit the dearest, to converse alone.\n  Me fate has sever'd from the sons of earth,\n  The fate fore-doom'd that waited from my birth:\n  Thee too it waits; before the Trojan wall\n  Even great and godlike thou art doom'd to fall.\n  Hear then; and as in fate and love we join,\n  Ah suffer that my bones may rest with thine!\n  Together have we lived; together bred,\n  One house received us, and one table fed;\n  That golden urn, thy goddess-mother gave,\n  May mix our ashes in one common grave.\"\n\n  \"And is it thou? (he answers) To my sight(283)\n  Once more return'st thou from the realms of night?\n  O more than brother! Think each office paid,\n  Whate'er can rest a discontented shade;\n  But grant one last embrace, unhappy boy!\n  Afford at least that melancholy joy.\"\n\n  He said, and with his longing arms essay'd\n  In vain to grasp the visionary shade!\n  Like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly,(284)\n  And hears a feeble, lamentable cry.\n  Confused he wakes; amazement breaks the bands\n  Of golden sleep, and starting from the sands,\n  Pensive he muses with uplifted hands:\n\n  \"'Tis true, 'tis certain; man, though dead, retains\n  Part of himself; the immortal mind remains:\n  The form subsists without the body's aid,\n  Aerial semblance, and an empty shade!\n  This night my friend, so late in battle lost,\n  Stood at my side, a pensive, plaintive ghost:\n  Even now familiar, as in life, he came;\n  Alas! how different! yet how like the same!\"\n\n  Thus while he spoke, each eye grew big with tears:\n  And now the rosy-finger'd morn appears,\n  Shows every mournful face with tears o'erspread,\n  And glares on the pale visage of the dead.\n  But Agamemnon, as the rites demand,\n  With mules and waggons sends a chosen band\n  To load the timber, and the pile to rear;\n  A charge consign'd to Merion's faithful care.\n  With proper instruments they take the road,\n  Axes to cut, and ropes to sling the load.\n  First march the heavy mules, securely slow,\n  O'er hills, o'er dales, o'er crags, o'er rocks they go:(285)\n  Jumping, high o'er the shrubs of the rough ground,\n  Rattle the clattering cars, and the shock'd axles bound\n  But when arrived at Ida's spreading woods,(286)\n  (Fair Ida, water'd with descending floods,)\n  Loud sounds the axe, redoubling strokes on strokes;\n  On all sides round the forest hurls her oaks\n  Headlong. Deep echoing groan the thickets brown;\n  Then rustling, crackling, crashing, thunder down.\n  The wood the Grecians cleave, prepared to burn;\n  And the slow mules the same rough road return\n  The sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore\n  (Such charge was given them) to the sandy shore;\n  There on the spot which great Achilles show'd,\n  They eased their shoulders, and disposed the load;\n  Circling around the place, where times to come\n  Shall view Patroclus' and Achilles' tomb.\n  The hero bids his martial troops appear\n  High on their cars in all the pomp of war;\n  Each in refulgent arms his limbs attires,\n  All mount their chariots, combatants and squires.\n  The chariots first proceed, a shining train;\n  Then clouds of foot that smoke along the plain;\n  Next these the melancholy band appear;\n  Amidst, lay dead Patroclus on the bier;\n  O'er all the corse their scattered locks they throw;\n  Achilles next, oppress'd with mighty woe,\n  Supporting with his hands the hero's head,\n  Bends o'er the extended body of the dead.\n  Patroclus decent on the appointed ground\n  They place, and heap the sylvan pile around.\n  But great Achilles stands apart in prayer,\n  And from his head divides the yellow hair;\n  Those curling locks which from his youth he vow'd,(287)\n  And sacred grew, to Sperchius' honour'd flood:\n  Then sighing, to the deep his locks he cast,\n  And roll'd his eyes around the watery waste:\n\n  \"Sperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lost\n  Delightful roll along my native coast!\n  To whom we vainly vow'd, at our return,\n  These locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn:\n  Full fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice,\n  Where to the day thy silver fountains rise,\n  And where in shade of consecrated bowers\n  Thy altars stand, perfumed with native flowers!\n  So vow'd my father, but he vow'd in vain;\n  No more Achilles sees his native plain;\n  In that vain hope these hairs no longer grow,\n  Patroclus bears them to the shades below.\"\n\n  Thus o'er Patroclus while the hero pray'd,\n  On his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.\n  Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:\n  And now the sun had set upon their woe;\n  But to the king of men thus spoke the chief:\n  \"Enough, Atrides! give the troops relief:\n  Permit the mourning legions to retire,\n  And let the chiefs alone attend the pyre;\n  The pious care be ours, the dead to burn--\"\n  He said: the people to their ships return:\n  While those deputed to inter the slain\n  Heap with a rising pyramid the plain.(288)\n  A hundred foot in length, a hundred wide,\n  The growing structure spreads on every side;\n  High on the top the manly corse they lay,\n  And well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay:\n  Achilles covered with their fat the dead,\n  And the piled victims round the body spread;\n  Then jars of honey, and of fragrant oil,\n  Suspends around, low-bending o'er the pile.\n  Four sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan\n  Pour forth their lives, and on the pyre are thrown.\n  Of nine large dogs, domestic at his board,\n  Fall two, selected to attend their lord,\n  Then last of all, and horrible to tell,\n  Sad sacrifice! twelve Trojan captives fell.(289)\n  On these the rage of fire victorious preys,\n  Involves and joins them in one common blaze.\n  Smear'd with the bloody rites, he stands on high,\n  And calls the spirit with a dreadful cry:(290)\n\n  \"All hail, Patroclus! let thy vengeful ghost\n  Hear, and exult, on Pluto's dreary coast.\n  Behold Achilles' promise fully paid,\n  Twelve Trojan heroes offer'd to thy shade;\n  But heavier fates on Hector's corse attend,\n  Saved from the flames, for hungry dogs to rend.\"\n\n  So spake he, threatening: but the gods made vain\n  His threat, and guard inviolate the slain:\n  Celestial Venus hover'd o'er his head,\n  And roseate unguents, heavenly fragrance! shed:\n  She watch'd him all the night and all the day,\n  And drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey.\n  Nor sacred Phoebus less employ'd his care;\n  He pour'd around a veil of gather'd air,\n  And kept the nerves undried, the flesh entire,\n  Against the solar beam and Sirian fire.\n\n              [Illustration: THE FUNERAL PILE OF PATROCLUS.]\n\n                      THE FUNERAL PILE OF PATROCLUS.\n\n\n  Nor yet the pile, where dead Patroclus lies,\n  Smokes, nor as yet the sullen flames arise;\n  But, fast beside, Achilles stood in prayer,\n  Invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air,\n  And victims promised, and libations cast,\n  To gentle Zephyr and the Boreal blast:\n  He call'd the aerial powers, along the skies\n  To breathe, and whisper to the fires to rise.\n  The winged Iris heard the hero's call,\n  And instant hasten'd to their airy hall,\n  Where in old Zephyr's open courts on high,\n  Sat all the blustering brethren of the sky.\n  She shone amidst them, on her painted bow;\n  The rocky pavement glitter'd with the show.\n  All from the banquet rise, and each invites\n  The various goddess to partake the rites.\n  \"Not so (the dame replied), I haste to go\n  To sacred Ocean, and the floods below:\n  Even now our solemn hecatombs attend,\n  And heaven is feasting on the world's green end\n  With righteous Ethiops (uncorrupted train!)\n  Far on the extremest limits of the main.\n  But Peleus' son entreats, with sacrifice,\n  The western spirit, and the north, to rise!\n  Let on Patroclus' pile your blast be driven,\n  And bear the blazing honours high to heaven.\"\n\n  Swift as the word she vanish'd from their view;\n  Swift as the word the winds tumultuous flew;\n  Forth burst the stormy band with thundering roar,\n  And heaps on heaps the clouds are toss'd before.\n  To the wide main then stooping from the skies,\n  The heaving deeps in watery mountains rise:\n  Troy feels the blast along her shaking walls,\n  Till on the pile the gather'd tempest falls.\n  The structure crackles in the roaring fires,\n  And all the night the plenteous flame aspires.\n  All night Achilles hails Patroclus' soul,\n  With large libations from the golden bowl.\n  As a poor father, helpless and undone,\n  Mourns o'er the ashes of an only son,\n  Takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn,\n  And pours in tears, ere yet they close the urn:\n  So stay'd Achilles, circling round the shore,\n  So watch'd the flames, till now they flame no more.\n  'Twas when, emerging through the shades of night.\n  The morning planet told the approach of light;\n  And, fast behind, Aurora's warmer ray\n  O'er the broad ocean pour'd the golden day:\n  Then sank the blaze, the pile no longer burn'd,\n  And to their caves the whistling winds return'd:\n  Across the Thracian seas their course they bore;\n  The ruffled seas beneath their passage roar.\n\n  Then parting from the pile he ceased to weep,\n  And sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep,\n  Exhausted with his grief: meanwhile the crowd\n  Of thronging Grecians round Achilles stood;\n  The tumult waked him: from his eyes he shook\n  Unwilling slumber, and the chiefs bespoke:\n\n  \"Ye kings and princes of the Achaian name!\n  First let us quench the yet remaining flame\n  With sable wine; then, as the rites direct,\n  The hero's bones with careful view select:\n  (Apart, and easy to be known they lie\n  Amidst the heap, and obvious to the eye:\n  The rest around the margin will be seen\n  Promiscuous, steeds and immolated men:)\n  These wrapp'd in double cauls of fat, prepare;\n  And in the golden vase dispose with care;\n  There let them rest with decent honour laid,\n  Till I shall follow to the infernal shade.\n  Meantime erect the tomb with pious hands,\n  A common structure on the humble sands:\n  Hereafter Greece some nobler work may raise,\n  And late posterity record our praise!\"\n\n  The Greeks obey; where yet the embers glow,\n  Wide o'er the pile the sable wine they throw,\n  And deep subsides the ashy heap below.\n  Next the white bones his sad companions place,\n  With tears collected, in the golden vase.\n  The sacred relics to the tent they bore;\n  The urn a veil of linen covered o'er.\n  That done, they bid the sepulchre aspire,\n  And cast the deep foundations round the pyre;\n  High in the midst they heap the swelling bed\n  Of rising earth, memorial of the dead.\n\n  The swarming populace the chief detains,\n  And leads amidst a wide extent of plains;\n  There placed them round: then from the ships proceeds\n  A train of oxen, mules, and stately steeds,\n  Vases and tripods (for the funeral games),\n  Resplendent brass, and more resplendent dames.\n  First stood the prizes to reward the force\n  Of rapid racers in the dusty course:\n  A woman for the first, in beauty's bloom,\n  Skill'd in the needle, and the labouring loom;\n  And a large vase, where two bright handles rise,\n  Of twenty measures its capacious size.\n  The second victor claims a mare unbroke,\n  Big with a mule, unknowing of the yoke:\n  The third, a charger yet untouch'd by flame;\n  Four ample measures held the shining frame:\n  Two golden talents for the fourth were placed:\n  An ample double bowl contents the last.\n  These in fair order ranged upon the plain,\n  The hero, rising, thus address'd the train:\n\n  \"Behold the prizes, valiant Greeks! decreed\n  To the brave rulers of the racing steed;\n  Prizes which none beside ourself could gain,\n  Should our immortal coursers take the plain;\n  (A race unrivall'd, which from ocean's god\n  Peleus received, and on his son bestow'd.)\n  But this no time our vigour to display;\n  Nor suit, with them, the games of this sad day:\n  Lost is Patroclus now, that wont to deck\n  Their flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.\n  Sad, as they shared in human grief, they stand,\n  And trail those graceful honours on the sand!\n  Let others for the noble task prepare,\n  Who trust the courser and the flying car.\"\n\n  Fired at his word the rival racers rise;\n  But far the first Eumelus hopes the prize,\n  Famed though Pieria for the fleetest breed,\n  And skill'd to manage the high-bounding steed.\n  With equal ardour bold Tydides swell'd,\n  The steeds of Tros beneath his yoke compell'd\n  (Which late obey'd the Dardan chiefs command,\n  When scarce a god redeem'd him from his hand).\n  Then Menelaus his Podargus brings,\n  And the famed courser of the king of kings:\n  Whom rich Echepolus (more rich than brave),\n  To 'scape the wars, to Agamemnon gave,\n  (AEthe her name) at home to end his days;\n  Base wealth preferring to eternal praise.\n  Next him Antilochus demands the course\n  With beating heart, and cheers his Pylian horse.\n  Experienced Nestor gives his son the reins,\n  Directs his judgment, and his heat restrains;\n  Nor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears\n  The prudent son with unattending ears.\n\n  \"My son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast,\n  The gods have loved thee, and with arts have bless'd;\n  Neptune and Jove on thee conferr'd the skill\n  Swift round the goal to turn the flying wheel.\n  To guide thy conduct little precept needs;\n  But slow, and past their vigour, are my steeds.\n  Fear not thy rivals, though for swiftness known;\n  Compare those rivals' judgment and thy own:\n  It is not strength, but art, obtains the prize,\n  And to be swift is less than to be wise.\n  'Tis more by art than force of numerous strokes\n  The dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks;\n  By art the pilot, through the boiling deep\n  And howling tempest, steers the fearless ship;\n  And 'tis the artist wins the glorious course;\n  Not those who trust in chariots and in horse.\n  In vain, unskilful to the goal they strive,\n  And short, or wide, the ungovern'd courser drive:\n  While with sure skill, though with inferior steeds,\n  The knowing racer to his end proceeds;\n  Fix'd on the goal his eye foreruns the course,\n  His hand unerring steers the steady horse,\n  And now contracts, or now extends the rein,\n  Observing still the foremost on the plain.\n  Mark then the goal, 'tis easy to be found;\n  Yon aged trunk, a cubit from the ground;\n  Of some once stately oak the last remains,\n  Or hardy fir, unperish'd with the rains:\n  Inclosed with stones, conspicuous from afar;\n  And round, a circle for the wheeling car.\n  (Some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace;\n  Or then, as now, the limit of a race.)\n  Bear close to this, and warily proceed,\n  A little bending to the left-hand steed;\n  But urge the right, and give him all the reins;\n  While thy strict hand his fellow's head restrains,\n  And turns him short; till, doubling as they roll,\n  The wheel's round naves appear to brush the goal.\n  Yet (not to break the car, or lame the horse)\n  Clear of the stony heap direct the course;\n  Lest through incaution failing, thou mayst be\n  A joy to others, a reproach to me.\n  So shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,\n  And leave unskilful swiftness far behind:\n  Though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed\n  Which bore Adrastus, of celestial breed;\n  Or the famed race, through all the regions known,\n  That whirl'd the car of proud Laomedon.\"\n\n  Thus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage\n  Concludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.\n  Next bold Meriones was seen to rise,\n  The last, but not least ardent for the prize.\n  They mount their seats; the lots their place dispose\n  (Roll'd in his helmet, these Achilles throws).\n  Young Nestor leads the race: Eumelus then;\n  And next the brother of the king of men:\n  Thy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast;\n  And, far the bravest, Diomed, was last.\n  They stand in order, an impatient train:\n  Pelides points the barrier on the plain,\n  And sends before old Phoenix to the place,\n  To mark the racers, and to judge the race.\n  At once the coursers from the barrier bound;\n  The lifted scourges all at once resound;\n  Their heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;\n  And up the champaign thunder from the shore:\n  Thick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,\n  And the lost courser in the whirlwind flies;\n  Loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,\n  Float in their speed, and dance upon the wind:\n  The smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,\n  Now seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.\n  While hot for fame, and conquest all their care,\n  (Each o'er his flying courser hung in air,)\n  Erect with ardour, poised upon the rein,\n  They pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.\n  Now (the last compass fetch'd around the goal)\n  At the near prize each gathers all his soul,\n  Each burns with double hope, with double pain,\n  Tears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.\n  First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;\n  With those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds:\n  Close on Eumelus' back they puff the wind,\n  And seem just mounting on his car behind;\n  Full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,\n  And, hovering o'er, their stretching shadows sees.\n  Then had he lost, or left a doubtful prize;\n  But angry Phoebus to Tydides flies,\n  Strikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain\n  His matchless horses' labour on the plain.\n  Rage fills his eye with anguish, to survey\n  Snatch'd from his hope the glories of the day.\n  The fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain,\n  Springs to her knight, and gives the scourge again,\n  And fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke\n  She breaks his rival's chariot from the yoke:\n  No more their way the startled horses held;\n  The car reversed came rattling on the field;\n  Shot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,\n  Prone on the dust the unhappy master fell;\n  His batter'd face and elbows strike the ground;\n  Nose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish'd wound:\n  Grief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:\n  Before him far the glad Tydides flies;\n  Minerva's spirit drives his matchless pace,\n  And crowns him victor of the labour'd race.\n\n  The next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;\n  While thus young Nestor animates his steeds:\n  \"Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;\n  Not that we hope to match Tydides' horse,\n  Since great Minerva wings their rapid way,\n  And gives their lord the honours of the day;\n  But reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo\n  Your swiftness? vanquish'd by a female foe?\n  Through your neglect, if lagging on the plain\n  The last ignoble gift be all we gain,\n  No more shall Nestor's hand your food supply,\n  The old man's fury rises, and ye die.\n  Haste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,\n  Presents the occasion, could we use it right.\"\n\n  Thus he. The coursers at their master's threat\n  With quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.\n  And now Antilochus with nice survey\n  Observes the compass of the hollow way.\n  'Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,\n  Fast by the road a precipice was worn:\n  Here, where but one could pass, to shun the throng\n  The Spartan hero's chariot smoked along.\n  Close up the venturous youth resolves to keep,\n  Still edging near, and bears him toward the steep.\n  Atrides, trembling, casts his eye below,\n  And wonders at the rashness of his foe.\n  \"Hold, stay your steeds--What madness thus to ride\n  This narrow way! take larger field (he cried),\n  Or both must fall.\"--Atrides cried in vain;\n  He flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.\n  Far as an able arm the disk can send,\n  When youthful rivals their full force extend,\n  So far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew\n  Before the king: he, cautious, backward drew\n  His horse compell'd; foreboding in his fears\n  The rattling ruin of the clashing cars,\n  The floundering coursers rolling on the plain,\n  And conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.\n  But thus upbraids his rival as he flies:\n  \"Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!\n  Go, but expect not I'll the prize resign;\n  Add perjury to fraud, and make it thine--\"\n  Then to his steeds with all his force he cries,\n  \"Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!\n  Your rivals, destitute of youthful force,\n  With fainting knees shall labour in the course,\n  And yield the glory yours.\"--The steeds obey;\n  Already at their heels they wing their way,\n  And seem already to retrieve the day.\n\n  Meantime the Grecians in a ring beheld\n  The coursers bounding o'er the dusty field.\n  The first who mark'd them was the Cretan king;\n  High on a rising ground, above the ring,\n  The monarch sat: from whence with sure survey\n  He well observed the chief who led the way,\n  And heard from far his animating cries,\n  And saw the foremost steed with sharpen'd eyes;\n  On whose broad front a blaze of shining white,\n  Like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.\n  He saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:\n  \"Are yonder horse discern'd by me alone?\n  Or can ye, all, another chief survey,\n  And other steeds than lately led the way?\n  Those, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,\n  Lie sure disabled in the middle field:\n  For, since the goal they doubled, round the plain\n  I search to find them, but I search in vain.\n  Perchance the reins forsook the driver's hand,\n  And, turn'd too short, he tumbled on the strand,\n  Shot from the chariot; while his coursers stray\n  With frantic fury from the destined way.\n  Rise then some other, and inform my sight,\n  For these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;\n  Yet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,\n  The great AEtolian chief, renown'd in war.\"\n\n  \"Old man! (Oileus rashly thus replies)\n  Thy tongue too hastily confers the prize;\n  Of those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,\n  Nor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.\n  Eumelus' steeds, high bounding in the chase,\n  Still, as at first, unrivall'd lead the race:\n  I well discern him, as he shakes the rein,\n  And hear his shouts victorious o'er the plain.\"\n\n  Thus he. Idomeneus, incensed, rejoin'd:\n  \"Barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!\n  Contentious prince, of all the Greeks beside\n  The last in merit, as the first in pride!\n  To vile reproach what answer can we make?\n  A goblet or a tripod let us stake,\n  And be the king the judge. The most unwise\n  Will learn their rashness, when they pay the price.\"\n\n  He said: and Ajax, by mad passion borne,\n  Stern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn\n  To fell extremes. But Thetis' godlike son\n  Awful amidst them rose, and thus begun:\n\n  \"Forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;\n  Much would ye blame, should others thus offend:\n  And lo! the approaching steeds your contest end.\"\n  No sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,\n  Drives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.\n  High o'er his head the circling lash he wields:\n  His bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:\n  His car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll'd,\n  Bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,\n  Refulgent through the cloud: no eye could find\n  The track his flying wheels had left behind:\n  And the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace\n  So swift, it seem'd a flight, and not a race.\n  Now victor at the goal Tydides stands,\n  Quits his bright car, and springs upon the sands;\n  From the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;\n  The well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:\n  With joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize,\n  The tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes:\n  These to the ships his train triumphant leads,\n  The chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.\n\n  Young Nestor follows (who by art, not force,\n  O'erpass'd Atrides) second in the course.\n  Behind, Atrides urged the race, more near\n  Than to the courser in his swift career\n  The following car, just touching with his heel\n  And brushing with his tail the whirling wheel:\n  Such, and so narrow now the space between\n  The rivals, late so distant on the green;\n  So soon swift AEthe her lost ground regain'd,\n  One length, one moment, had the race obtain'd.\n\n  Merion pursued, at greater distance still,\n  With tardier coursers, and inferior skill.\n  Last came, Admetus! thy unhappy son;\n  Slow dragged the steeds his batter'd chariot on:\n  Achilles saw, and pitying thus begun:\n\n  \"Behold! the man whose matchless art surpass'd\n  The sons of Greece! the ablest, yet the last!\n  Fortune denies, but justice bids us pay\n  (Since great Tydides bears the first away)\n  To him the second honours of the day.\"\n\n  The Greeks consent with loud-applauding cries,\n  And then Eumelus had received the prize,\n  But youthful Nestor, jealous of his fame,\n  The award opposes, and asserts his claim.\n  \"Think not (he cries) I tamely will resign,\n  O Peleus' son! the mare so justly mine.\n  What if the gods, the skilful to confound,\n  Have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground?\n  Perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice,\n  And vows omitted forfeited the prize.\n  If yet (distinction to thy friend to show,\n  And please a soul desirous to bestow)\n  Some gift must grace Eumelus, view thy store\n  Of beauteous handmaids, steeds, and shining ore;\n  An ample present let him thence receive,\n  And Greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give.\n  But this my prize I never shall forego;\n  This, who but touches, warriors! is my foe.\"\n\n  Thus spake the youth; nor did his words offend;\n  Pleased with the well-turn'd flattery of a friend,\n  Achilles smiled: \"The gift proposed (he cried),\n  Antilochus! we shall ourself provide.\n  With plates of brass the corslet cover'd o'er,\n  (The same renown'd Asteropaeus wore,)\n  Whose glittering margins raised with silver shine,\n  (No vulgar gift,) Eumelus! shall be thine.\"\n\n  He said: Automedon at his command\n  The corslet brought, and gave it to his hand.\n  Distinguish'd by his friend, his bosom glows\n  With generous joy: then Menelaus rose;\n  The herald placed the sceptre in his hands,\n  And still'd the clamour of the shouting bands.\n  Not without cause incensed at Nestor's son,\n  And inly grieving, thus the king begun:\n\n  \"The praise of wisdom, in thy youth obtain'd,\n  An act so rash, Antilochus! has stain'd.\n  Robb'd of my glory and my just reward,\n  To you, O Grecians! be my wrong declared:\n  So not a leader shall our conduct blame,\n  Or judge me envious of a rival's fame.\n  But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?\n  What needs appealing in a fact so plain?\n  What Greek shall blame me, if I bid thee rise,\n  And vindicate by oath th' ill-gotten prize?\n  Rise if thou darest, before thy chariot stand,\n  The driving scourge high-lifted in thy hand;\n  And touch thy steeds, and swear thy whole intent\n  Was but to conquer, not to circumvent.\n  Swear by that god whose liquid arms surround\n  The globe, and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground!\"\n\n  The prudent chief with calm attention heard;\n  Then mildly thus: \"Excuse, if youth have err'd;\n  Superior as thou art, forgive the offence,\n  Nor I thy equal, or in years, or sense.\n  Thou know'st the errors of unripen'd age,\n  Weak are its counsels, headlong is its rage.\n  The prize I quit, if thou thy wrath resign;\n  The mare, or aught thou ask'st, be freely thine\n  Ere I become (from thy dear friendship torn)\n  Hateful to thee, and to the gods forsworn.\"\n\n  So spoke Antilochus; and at the word\n  The mare contested to the king restored.\n  Joy swells his soul: as when the vernal grain\n  Lifts the green ear above the springing plain,\n  The fields their vegetable life renew,\n  And laugh and glitter with the morning dew;\n  Such joy the Spartan's shining face o'erspread,\n  And lifted his gay heart, while thus he said:\n\n  \"Still may our souls, O generous youth! agree\n  'Tis now Atrides' turn to yield to thee.\n  Rash heat perhaps a moment might control,\n  Not break, the settled temper of thy soul.\n  Not but (my friend) 'tis still the wiser way\n  To waive contention with superior sway;\n  For ah! how few, who should like thee offend,\n  Like thee, have talents to regain the friend!\n  To plead indulgence, and thy fault atone,\n  Suffice thy father's merit and thy own:\n  Generous alike, for me, the sire and son\n  Have greatly suffer'd, and have greatly done.\n  I yield; that all may know, my soul can bend,\n  Nor is my pride preferr'd before my friend.\"\n\n  He said; and pleased his passion to command,\n  Resign'd the courser to Noemon's hand,\n  Friend of the youthful chief: himself content,\n  The shining charger to his vessel sent.\n  The golden talents Merion next obtain'd;\n  The fifth reward, the double bowl, remain'd.\n  Achilles this to reverend Nestor bears.\n  And thus the purpose of his gift declares:\n  \"Accept thou this, O sacred sire! (he said)\n  In dear memorial of Patroclus dead;\n  Dead and for ever lost Patroclus lies,\n  For ever snatch'd from our desiring eyes!\n  Take thou this token of a grateful heart,\n  Though 'tis not thine to hurl the distant dart,\n  The quoit to toss, the ponderous mace to wield,\n  Or urge the race, or wrestle on the field:\n  Thy pristine vigour age has overthrown,\n  But left the glory of the past thy own.\"\n\n  He said, and placed the goblet at his side;\n  With joy the venerable king replied:\n\n  \"Wisely and well, my son, thy words have proved\n  A senior honour'd, and a friend beloved!\n  Too true it is, deserted of my strength,\n  These wither'd arms and limbs have fail'd at length.\n  Oh! had I now that force I felt of yore,\n  Known through Buprasium and the Pylian shore!\n  Victorious then in every solemn game,\n  Ordain'd to Amarynces' mighty name;\n  The brave Epeians gave my glory way,\n  AEtolians, Pylians, all resign'd the day.\n  I quell'd Clytomedes in fights of hand,\n  And backward hurl'd Ancaeus on the sand,\n  Surpass'd Iphyclus in the swift career,\n  Phyleus and Polydorus with the spear.\n  The sons of Actor won the prize of horse,\n  But won by numbers, not by art or force:\n  For the famed twins, impatient to survey\n  Prize after prize by Nestor borne away,\n  Sprung to their car; and with united pains\n  One lash'd the coursers, while one ruled the reins.\n  Such once I was! Now to these tasks succeeds\n  A younger race, that emulate our deeds:\n  I yield, alas! (to age who must not yield?)\n  Though once the foremost hero of the field.\n  Go thou, my son! by generous friendship led,\n  With martial honours decorate the dead:\n  While pleased I take the gift thy hands present,\n  (Pledge of benevolence, and kind intent,)\n  Rejoiced, of all the numerous Greeks, to see\n  Not one but honours sacred age and me:\n  Those due distinctions thou so well canst pay,\n  May the just gods return another day!\"\n\n  Proud of the gift, thus spake the full of days:\n  Achilles heard him, prouder of the praise.\n\n  The prizes next are order'd to the field,\n  For the bold champions who the caestus wield.\n  A stately mule, as yet by toils unbroke,\n  Of six years' age, unconscious of the yoke,\n  Is to the circus led, and firmly bound;\n  Next stands a goblet, massy, large, and round.\n  Achilles rising, thus: \"Let Greece excite\n  Two heroes equal to this hardy fight;\n  Who dare the foe with lifted arms provoke,\n  And rush beneath the long-descending stroke.\n  On whom Apollo shall the palm bestow,\n  And whom the Greeks supreme by conquest know,\n  This mule his dauntless labours shall repay,\n  The vanquish'd bear the massy bowl away.\"\n\n  This dreadful combat great Epeus chose;(291)\n  High o'er the crowd, enormous bulk! he rose,\n  And seized the beast, and thus began to say:\n  \"Stand forth some man, to bear the bowl away!\n  (Price of his ruin: for who dares deny\n  This mule my right; the undoubted victor I)\n  Others, 'tis own'd, in fields of battle shine,\n  But the first honours of this fight are mine;\n  For who excels in all? Then let my foe\n  Draw near, but first his certain fortune know;\n  Secure this hand shall his whole frame confound,\n  Mash all his bones, and all his body pound:\n  So let his friends be nigh, a needful train,\n  To heave the batter'd carcase off the plain.\"\n\n  The giant spoke; and in a stupid gaze\n  The host beheld him, silent with amaze!\n  'Twas thou, Euryalus! who durst aspire\n  To meet his might, and emulate thy sire,\n  The great Mecistheus; who in days of yore\n  In Theban games the noblest trophy bore,\n  (The games ordain'd dead OEdipus to grace,)\n  And singly vanquish the Cadmean race.\n  Him great Tydides urges to contend,\n  Warm with the hopes of conquest for his friend;\n  Officious with the cincture girds him round;\n  And to his wrist the gloves of death are bound.\n  Amid the circle now each champion stands,\n  And poises high in air his iron hands;\n  With clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,\n  Their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,\n  And painful sweat from all their members flows.\n  At length Epeus dealt a weighty blow\n  Full on the cheek of his unwary foe;\n  Beneath that ponderous arm's resistless sway\n  Down dropp'd he, nerveless, and extended lay.\n  As a large fish, when winds and waters roar,\n  By some huge billow dash'd against the shore,\n  Lies panting; not less batter'd with his wound,\n  The bleeding hero pants upon the ground.\n  To rear his fallen foe, the victor lends,\n  Scornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends;\n  Whose arms support him, reeling through the throng,\n  And dragging his disabled legs along;\n  Nodding, his head hangs down his shoulder o'er;\n  His mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore;(292)\n  Wrapp'd round in mists he lies, and lost to thought;\n  His friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.\n\n  The third bold game Achilles next demands,\n  And calls the wrestlers to the level sands:\n  A massy tripod for the victor lies,\n  Of twice six oxen its reputed price;\n  And next, the loser's spirits to restore,\n  A female captive, valued but at four.\n  Scarce did the chief the vigorous strife prop\n  When tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose.\n  Amid the ring each nervous rival stands,\n  Embracing rigid with implicit hands.\n  Close lock'd above, their heads and arms are mix'd:\n  Below, their planted feet at distance fix'd;\n  Like two strong rafters which the builder forms,\n  Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms,\n  Their tops connected, but at wider space\n  Fix'd on the centre stands their solid base.\n  Now to the grasp each manly body bends;\n  The humid sweat from every pore descends;\n  Their bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs\n  Swell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.\n  Nor could Ulysses, for his art renown'd,\n  O'erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;\n  Nor could the strength of Ajax overthrow\n  The watchful caution of his artful foe.\n  While the long strife even tired the lookers on,\n  Thus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:\n  \"Or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me:\n  Prove we our force, and Jove the rest decree.\"\n\n  He said; and, straining, heaved him off the ground\n  With matchless strength; that time Ulysses found\n  The strength to evade, and where the nerves combine\n  His ankle struck: the giant fell supine;\n  Ulysses, following, on his bosom lies;\n  Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.\n  Ajax to lift Ulysses next essays;\n  He barely stirr'd him, but he could not raise:\n  His knee lock'd fast, the foe's attempt denied;\n  And grappling close, they tumbled side by side.\n  Defiled with honourable dust they roll,\n  Still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:\n  Again they rage, again to combat rise;\n  When great Achilles thus divides the prize:\n\n  \"Your noble vigour, O my friends, restrain;\n  Nor weary out your generous strength in vain.\n  Ye both have won: let others who excel,\n  Now prove that prowess you have proved so well.\"\n\n  The hero's words the willing chiefs obey,\n  From their tired bodies wipe the dust away,\n  And, clothed anew, the following games survey.\n\n  And now succeed the gifts ordain'd to grace\n  The youths contending in the rapid race:\n  A silver urn that full six measures held,\n  By none in weight or workmanship excell'd:\n  Sidonian artists taught the frame to shine,\n  Elaborate, with artifice divine;\n  Whence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport,\n  And gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port:\n  From him descended, good Eunaeus heir'd\n  The glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spared,\n  To brave Patroclus gave the rich reward:\n  Now, the same hero's funeral rites to grace,\n  It stands the prize of swiftness in the race.\n  A well-fed ox was for the second placed;\n  And half a talent must content the last.\n  Achilles rising then bespoke the train:\n  \"Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,\n  Stand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain.\"\n\n  The hero said, and starting from his place,\n  Oilean Ajax rises to the race;\n  Ulysses next; and he whose speed surpass'd\n  His youthful equals, Nestor's son, the last.\n  Ranged in a line the ready racers stand;\n  Pelides points the barrier with his hand;\n  All start at once; Oileus led the race;\n  The next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace;\n  Behind him, diligently close, he sped,\n  As closely following as the running thread\n  The spindle follows, and displays the charms\n  Of the fair spinster's breast and moving arms:\n  Graceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,\n  And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise;\n  His glowing breath upon his shoulders plays:\n  The admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise:\n  To him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes,\n  And send their souls before him as he flies.\n  Now three times turn'd in prospect of the goal,\n  The panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul:\n  \"Assist, O goddess!\" thus in thought he pray'd!\n  And present at his thought descends the maid.\n  Buoy'd by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,\n  And feels a pinion lifting every limb.\n  All fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,\n  Unhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain\n  (O'erturn'd by Pallas), where the slippery shore\n  Was clogg'd with slimy dung and mingled gore.\n  (The self-same place beside Patroclus' pyre,\n  Where late the slaughter'd victims fed the fire.)\n  Besmear'd with filth, and blotted o'er with clay,\n  Obscene to sight, the rueful racer lay;\n  The well-fed bull (the second prize) he shared,\n  And left the urn Ulysses' rich reward.\n  Then, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,\n  The baffled hero thus the Greeks address'd:\n\n  \"Accursed fate! the conquest I forego;\n  A mortal I, a goddess was my foe;\n  She urged her favourite on the rapid way,\n  And Pallas, not Ulysses, won the day.\"\n\n  Thus sourly wail'd he, sputtering dirt and gore;\n  A burst of laughter echoed through the shore.\n  Antilochus, more humorous than the rest,\n  Takes the last prize, and takes it with a jest:\n\n  \"Why with our wiser elders should we strive?\n  The gods still love them, and they always thrive.\n  Ye see, to Ajax I must yield the prize:\n  He to Ulysses, still more aged and wise;\n  (A green old age unconscious of decays,\n  That proves the hero born in better days!)\n  Behold his vigour in this active race!\n  Achilles only boasts a swifter pace:\n  For who can match Achilles? He who can,\n  Must yet be more than hero, more than man.\"\n\n  The effect succeeds the speech. Pelides cries,\n  \"Thy artful praise deserves a better prize.\n  Nor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll'd;\n  Receive a talent of the purest gold.\"\n  The youth departs content. The host admire\n  The son of Nestor, worthy of his sire.\n\n  Next these a buckler, spear, and helm, he brings;\n  Cast on the plain, the brazen burden rings:\n  Arms which of late divine Sarpedon wore,\n  And great Patroclus in short triumph bore.\n  \"Stand forth the bravest of our host!

No grateful sacrifice,\n  No firstling lambs, unheedful! didst thou vow\n  To Phoebus, patron of the shaft and bow.\n  For this, thy well-aim'd arrow turn'd aside,\n  Err'd from the dove, yet cut the cord that tied:\n  Adown the mainmast fell the parted string,\n  And the free bird to heaven displays her wing:\n  Sea, shores, and skies, with loud applause resound,\n  And Merion eager meditates the wound:\n  He takes the bow, directs the shaft above,\n  And following with his eye the soaring dove,\n  Implores the god to speed it through the skies,\n  With vows of firstling lambs, and grateful sacrific\n  The dove, in airy circles as she wheels,\n  Amid the clouds the piercing arrow feels;\n  Quite through and through the point its passage found,\n  And at his feet fell bloody to the ground.\n  The wounded bird, ere yet she breathed her last,\n  With flagging wings alighted on the mast,\n  A moment hung, and spread her pinions there,\n  Then sudden dropp'd, and left her life in air.\n  From the pleased crowd new peals of thunder rise,\n  And to the ships brave Merion bears the prize.\n\n  To close the funeral games, Achilles last\n  A massy spear amid the circle placed,\n  And ample charger of unsullied frame,\n  With flowers high-wrought, not blacken'd yet by flame.\n  For these he bids the heroes prove their art,\n  Whose dexterous skill directs the flying dart.\n  Here too great Merion hopes the noble prize;\n  Nor here disdain'd the king of men to rise.\n  With joy Pelides saw the honour paid,\n  Rose to the monarch, and respectful said:\n\n  \"Thee first in virtue, as in power supreme,\n  O king of nations! all thy Greeks proclaim;\n  In every martial game thy worth attest,\n  And know thee both their greatest and their best.\n  Take then the prize, but let brave Merion bear\n  This beamy javelin in thy brother's war.\"\n\n  Pleased from the hero's lips his praise to hear,\n  The king to Merion gives the brazen spear:\n  But, set apart for sacred use, commands\n  The glittering charger to Talthybius' hands.\n\n                          [Illustration: CERES.]\n\n                                  CERES.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK XXIV.\n\n\nARGUMENT.\n\nTHE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY OF HECTOR.\n\nThe gods deliberate about the redemption of Hector's body. Jupiter sends\nThetis to Achilles, to dispose him for the restoring it, and Iris to\nPriam, to encourage him to go in person and treat for it. The old king,\nnotwithstanding the remonstrances of his queen, makes ready for the\njourney, to which he is encouraged by an omen from Jupiter. He sets forth\nin his chariot, with a waggon loaded with presents, under the charge of\nIdaeus the herald. Mercury descends in the shape of a young man, and\nconducts him to the pavilion of Achilles. Their conversation on the way.\nPriam finds Achilles at his table, casts himself at his feet, and begs for\nthe body of his son: Achilles, moved with compassion, grants his request,\ndetains him one night in his tent, and the next morning sends him home\nwith the body: the Trojans run out to meet him. The lamentations of\nAndromache, Hecuba, and Helen, with the solemnities of the funeral.\n\nThe time of twelve days is employed in this book, while the body of Hector\nlies in the tent of Achilles; and as many more are spent in the truce\nallowed for his interment. The scene is partly in Achilles' camp, and\npartly in Troy.\n\n  Now from the finish'd games the Grecian band\n  Seek their black ships, and clear the crowded strand,\n  All stretch'd at ease the genial banquet share,\n  And pleasing slumbers quiet all their care.\n  Not so Achilles: he, to grief resign'd,\n  His friend's dear image present to his mind,\n  Takes his sad couch, more unobserved to weep;\n  Nor tastes the gifts of all-composing sleep.\n  Restless he roll'd around his weary bed,\n  And all his soul on his Patroclus fed:\n  The form so pleasing, and the heart so kind,\n  That youthful vigour, and that manly mind,\n  What toils they shared, what martial works they wrought,\n  What seas they measured, and what fields they fought;\n  All pass'd before him in remembrance dear,\n  Thought follows thought, and tear succeeds to tear.\n  And now supine, now prone, the hero lay,\n  Now shifts his side, impatient for the day:\n  Then starting up, disconsolate he goes\n  Wide on the lonely beach to vent his woes.\n  There as the solitary mourner raves,\n  The ruddy morning rises o'er the waves:\n  Soon as it rose, his furious steeds he join'd!\n  The chariot flies, and Hector trails behind.\n  And thrice, Patroclus! round thy monument\n  Was Hector dragg'd, then hurried to the tent.\n  There sleep at last o'ercomes the hero's eyes;\n  While foul in dust the unhonour'd carcase lies,\n  But not deserted by the pitying skies:\n  For Phoebus watch'd it with superior care,\n  Preserved from gaping wounds and tainting air;\n  And, ignominious as it swept the field,\n  Spread o'er the sacred corse his golden shield.\n  All heaven was moved, and Hermes will'd to go\n  By stealth to snatch him from the insulting foe:\n  But Neptune this, and Pallas this denies,\n  And th' unrelenting empress of the skies,\n  E'er since that day implacable to Troy,\n  What time young Paris, simple shepherd boy,\n  Won by destructive lust (reward obscene),\n  Their charms rejected for the Cyprian queen.\n  But when the tenth celestial morning broke,\n  To heaven assembled, thus Apollo spoke:\n\n          [Illustration: HECTOR'S BODY AT THE CAR OF ACHILLES.]\n\n                  HECTOR'S BODY AT THE CAR OF ACHILLES.\n\n\n  \"Unpitying powers! how oft each holy fane\n  Has Hector tinged with blood of victims slain?\n  And can ye still his cold remains pursue?\n  Still grudge his body to the Trojans' view?\n  Deny to consort, mother, son, and sire,\n  The last sad honours of a funeral fire?\n  Is then the dire Achilles all your care?\n  That iron heart, inflexibly severe;\n  A lion, not a man, who slaughters wide,\n  In strength of rage, and impotence of pride;\n  Who hastes to murder with a savage joy,\n  Invades around, and breathes but to destroy!\n  Shame is not of his soul; nor understood,\n  The greatest evil and the greatest good.\n  Still for one loss he rages unresign'd,\n  Repugnant to the lot of all mankind;\n  To lose a friend, a brother, or a son,\n  Heaven dooms each mortal, and its will is done:\n  Awhile they sorrow, then dismiss their care;\n  Fate gives the wound, and man is born to bear.\n  But this insatiate, the commission given\n  By fate exceeds, and tempts the wrath of heaven:\n  Lo, how his rage dishonest drags along\n  Hector's dead earth, insensible of wrong!\n  Brave though he be, yet by no reason awed,\n  He violates the laws of man and god.\"\n\n                  [Illustration: THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.]\n\n                          THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.\n\n\n  \"If equal honours by the partial skies\n  Are doom'd both heroes, (Juno thus replies,)\n  If Thetis' son must no distinction know,\n  Then hear, ye gods!

Jove himself (for Jove's command I bear)\n  Forbids to tempt the wrath of heaven too far.\n  No longer then (his fury if thou dread)\n  Detain the relics of great Hector dead;\n  Nor vent on senseless earth thy vengeance vain,\n  But yield to ransom, and restore the slain.\"\n\n  To whom Achilles: \"Be the ransom given,\n  And we submit, since such the will of heaven.\"\n\n  While thus they communed, from the Olympian bowers\n  Jove orders Iris to the Trojan towers:\n  \"Haste, winged goddess! to the sacred town,\n  And urge her monarch to redeem his son.\n  Alone the Ilian ramparts let him leave,\n  And bear what stern Achilles may receive:\n  Alone, for so we will; no Trojan near\n  Except, to place the dead with decent care,\n  Some aged herald, who with gentle hand\n  May the slow mules and funeral car command.\n  Nor let him death, nor let him danger dread,\n  Safe through the foe by our protection led:\n  Him Hermes to Achilles shall convey,\n  Guard of his life, and partner of his way.\n  Fierce as he is, Achilles' self shall spare\n  His age, nor touch one venerable hair:\n  Some thought there must be in a soul so brave,\n  Some sense of duty, some desire to save.\"\n\n     [Illustration: IRIS ADVISES PRIAM TO OBTAIN THE BODY OF HECTOR.]\n\n             IRIS ADVISES PRIAM TO OBTAIN THE BODY OF HECTOR.\n\n\n  Then down her bow the winged Iris drives,\n  And swift at Priam's mournful court arrives:\n  Where the sad sons beside their father's throne\n  Sat bathed in tears, and answer'd groan with groan.\n  And all amidst them lay the hoary sire,\n  (Sad scene of woe!) his face his wrapp'd attire\n  Conceal'd from sight; with frantic hands he spread\n  A shower of ashes o'er his neck and head.\n  From room to room his pensive daughters roam;\n  Whose shrieks and clamours fill the vaulted dome;\n  Mindful of those, who late their pride and joy,\n  Lie pale and breathless round the fields of Troy!\n  Before the king Jove's messenger appears,\n  And thus in whispers greets his trembling ears:\n\n  \"Fear not, O father! no ill news I bear;\n  From Jove I come, Jove makes thee still his care;\n  For Hector's sake these walls he bids thee leave,\n  And bear what stern Achilles may receive;\n  Alone, for so he wills; no Trojan near,\n  Except, to place the dead with decent care,\n  Some aged herald, who with gentle hand\n  May the slow mules and funeral car command.\n  Nor shalt thou death, nor shall thou danger dread:\n  Safe through the foe by his protection led:\n  Thee Hermes to Pelides shall convey,\n  Guard of thy life, and partner of thy way.\n  Fierce as he is, Achilles' self shall spare\n  Thy age, nor touch one venerable hair;\n  Some thought there must be in a soul so brave,\n  Some sense of duty, some desire to save.\"\n\n  She spoke, and vanish'd. Priam bids prepare\n  His gentle mules and harness to the car;\n  There, for the gifts, a polish'd casket lay:\n  His pious sons the king's command obey.\n  Then pass'd the monarch to his bridal-room,\n  Where cedar-beams the lofty roofs perfume,\n  And where the treasures of his empire lay;\n  Then call'd his queen, and thus began to say:\n\n  \"Unhappy consort of a king distress'd!\n  Partake the troubles of thy husband's breast:\n  I saw descend the messenger of Jove,\n  Who bids me try Achilles' mind to move;\n  Forsake these ramparts, and with gifts obtain\n  The corse of Hector, at yon navy slain.\n  Tell me thy thought: my heart impels to go\n  Through hostile camps, and bears me to the foe.\"\n\n  The hoary monarch thus.

thou tread'st on hostile land;\n  Release my knees, thy suppliant arts give o'er,\n  And shake the purpose of my soul no more.\"\n\n  The sire obey'd him, trembling and o'eraw'd.\n  Achilles, like a lion, rush'd abroad:\n  Automedon and Alcimus attend,\n  (Whom most he honour'd, since he lost his friend,)\n  These to unyoke the mules and horses went,\n  And led the hoary herald to the tent;\n  Next, heap'd on high, the numerous presents bear,\n  (Great Hector's ransom,) from the polish'd car.\n  Two splendid mantles, and a carpet spread,\n  They leave: to cover and enwrap the dead.\n  Then call the handmaids, with assistant toil\n  To wash the body and anoint with oil,\n  Apart from Priam: lest the unhappy sire,\n  Provoked to passion, once more rouse to ire\n  The stern Pelides; and nor sacred age,\n  Nor Jove's command, should check the rising rage.\n  This done, the garments o'er the corse they spread;\n  Achilles lifts it to the funeral bed:\n  Then, while the body on the car they laid,\n  He groans, and calls on loved Patroclus' shade:\n\n  \"If, in that gloom which never light must know,\n  The deeds of mortals touch the ghosts below,\n  O friend! forgive me, that I thus fulfil\n  (Restoring Hector) heaven's unquestion'd will.\n  The gifts the father gave, be ever thine,\n  To grace thy manes, and adorn thy shrine.\"(296)\n\n  He said, and, entering, took his seat of state;\n  Where full before him reverend Priam sate;\n  To whom, composed, the godlike chief begun:\n  \"Lo!

(she cries)\n  Snatch'd in thy bloom from these desiring eyes!\n  Thou to the dismal realms for ever gone!\n  And I abandon'd, desolate, alone!\n  An only son, once comfort of our pains,\n  Sad product now of hapless love, remains!\n  Never to manly age that son shall rise,\n  Or with increasing graces glad my eyes:\n  For Ilion now (her great defender slain)\n  Shall sink a smoking ruin on the plain.\n  Who now protects her wives with guardian care?\n  Who saves her infants from the rage of war?\n  Now hostile fleets must waft those infants o'er\n  (Those wives must wait them) to a foreign shore:\n  Thou too, my son, to barbarous climes shall go,\n  The sad companion of thy mother's woe;\n  Driven hence a slave before the victor's sword\n  Condemn'd to toil for some inhuman lord:\n  Or else some Greek whose father press'd the plain,\n  Or son, or brother, by great Hector slain,\n  In Hector's blood his vengeance shall enjoy,\n  And hurl thee headlong from the towers of Troy.(297)\n  For thy stern father never spared a foe:\n  Thence all these tears, and all this scene of woe!\n  Thence many evils his sad parents bore,\n  His parents many, but his consort more.\n  Why gav'st thou not to me thy dying hand?\n  And why received not I thy last command?\n  Some word thou would'st have spoke, which, sadly dear,\n  My soul might keep, or utter with a tear;\n  Which never, never could be lost in air,\n  Fix'd in my heart, and oft repeated there!\"\n\n  Thus to her weeping maids she makes her moan,\n  Her weeping handmaids echo groan for groan.\n\n  The mournful mother next sustains her part:\n  \"O thou, the best, the dearest to my heart!\n  Of all my race thou most by heaven approved,\n  And by the immortals even in death beloved!\n  While all my other sons in barbarous bands\n  Achilles bound, and sold to foreign lands,\n  This felt no chains, but went a glorious ghost,\n  Free, and a hero, to the Stygian coast.\n  Sentenced, 'tis true, by his inhuman doom,\n  Thy noble corse was dragg'd around the tomb;\n  (The tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain;)\n  Ungenerous insult, impotent and vain!\n  Yet glow'st thou fresh with every living grace;\n  No mark of pain, or violence of face:\n  Rosy and fair! as Phoebus' silver bow\n  Dismiss'd thee gently to the shades below.\"\n\n  Thus spoke the dame, and melted into tears.\n  Sad Helen next in pomp of grief appears;\n  Fast from the shining sluices of her eyes\n  Fall the round crystal drops, while thus she cries.\n\n  \"Ah, dearest friend!

But instead of endeavouring to raise a\nvain monument to myself, of the merits or difficulties of it (which must\nbe left to the world, to truth, and to posterity), let me leave behind me\na memorial of my friendship with one of the most valuable of men, as well\nas finest writers, of my age and country, one who has tried, and knows by\nhis own experience, how hard an undertaking it is to do justice to Homer,\nand one whom (I am sure) sincerely rejoices with me at the period of my\nlabours. To him, therefore, having brought this long work to a conclusion,\nI desire to dedicate it, and to have the honour and satisfaction of\nplacing together, in this manner, the names of Mr. CONGREVE, and of\n\nMarch 25, 1720\n\n                                                                   A.

In this mutual ground every man meets his\n      brother, they have been bet forth by the providence of God to\n      vindicate for all of us what nature could effect, and that, in these\n      representatives of our race, we might recognize our common\n      benefactors.'--_Doctrine of the Incarnation,_ pp. 9, 10.\n\n    2 Eikos de min aen kai mnaemoruna panton grapherthai.

His voice probably preserved a\n      medium between singing and recitation; the words, and not the melody\n      were regarded by the listeners, hence it was necessary for him to\n      remain intelligible to all. In countries where nothing similar is\n      found, it is difficult to represent such scenes to the mind; but\n      whoever has had an opportunity of listening to the improvisation of\n      Italy, can easily form an idea of Demodocus and Phemius.\"--_Ancient\n      Greece,_ p. 94.\n\n    4 \"Should it not be, since _my_ arrival? asks Mackenzie, observing\n      that \"poplars can hardly live so long\".  But setting aside the fact\n      that we must not expect consistency in a mere romance, the ancients\n      had a superstitious belief in the great age of trees which grew near\n      places consecrated by the presence of gods and great men. See Cicero\n      de Legg II I, sub init., where he speaks of the plane tree under\n      which Socrates used to walk and of the tree at Delos, where Latona\n      gave birth to Apollo. This passage is referred to by Stephanus of\n      Byzantium, _s. v._ N. T. p. 490, ed. de Pinedo. I omit quoting any\n      of the dull epigrams ascribed to Homer for, as Mr. Justice Talfourd\n      rightly observes, \"The authenticity of these fragments depends upon\n      that of the pseudo Herodotean Life of Homer, from which they are\n      taken.\" Lit of Greece, pp. 38 in Encycl.

In fact, they consist in an attempt to blend\n      those hypotheses into something like consistency, rather than in\n      advocating any individual theory.\n\n   23 Letters to Phileleuth; Lips.\n\n   24 Hist. of Greece, vol. ii. p. 191, sqq.\n\n   25 It is, indeed not easy to calculate the height to which the memory\n      may be cultivated. To take an ordinary case, we might refer to that\n      of any first rate actor, who must be prepared, at a very short\n      warning, to 'rhapsodize,' night after night, parts which when laid\n      together, would amount to an immense number of lines. But all this\n      is nothing to two instances of our own day. Visiting at Naples a\n      gentleman of the highest intellectual attainments, and who held a\n      distinguished rank among the men of letters in the last century, he\n      informed us that the day before he had passed much time in examining\n      a man, not highly educated, who had learned to repeat the whole\n      Gierusalemme of Tasso, not only to recite it consecutively, but also\n      to repeat those stanzas in utter defiance of the sense, either\n      forwards or backwards, or from the eighth line to the first,\n      alternately the odd and even lines--in short, whatever the passage\n      required; the memory, which seemed to cling to the words much more\n      than to the sense, had it at such perfect command, that it could\n      produce it under any form. Our informant went on to state that this\n      singular being was proceeding to learn the Orlando Furioso in the\n      same manner. But even this instance is less wonderful than one as to\n      which we may appeal to any of our readers that happened some twenty\n      years ago to visit the town of Stirling, in Scotland. No such person\n      can have forgotten the poor, uneducated man Blind Jamie who could\n      actually repeat, after a few minutes consideration any verse\n      required from any part of the Bible--even the obscurest and most\n      unimportant enumeration of mere proper names not excepted. We do not\n      mention these facts as touching the more difficult part of the\n      question before us, but facts they are; and if we find so much\n      difficulty in calculating the extent to which the mere memory may be\n      cultivated, are we, in these days of multifarious reading, and of\n      countless distracting affairs, fair judges of the perfection to\n      which the invention and the memory combined may attain in a simpler\n      age, and among a more single minded people?--Quarterly Review, _l.\n      c.,_ p. 143, sqq.\n\n      Heeren steers between the two opinions, observing that, \"The\n      Dschungariade of the Calmucks is said to surpass the poems of Homer\n      in length, as much as it stands beneath them in merit, and yet it\n      exists only in the memory of a people which is not unacquainted with\n      writing. But the songs of a nation are probably the last things\n      which are committed to writing, for the very reason that they are\n      remembered.\"-- _Ancient Greece._ p. 100.\n\n   26 Vol. II p. 198, sqq.\n\n   27 Quarterly Review, _l. c.,_ p. 131 sq.\n\n   28 Betrachtungen uber die Ilias.

I. vers. 155, &c.\n\n   40 The following argument of the Iliad, corrected in a few particulars,\n      is translated from Bitaube, and is, perhaps, the neatest summary\n      that has ever been drawn up:--\"A hero, injured by his general, and\n      animated with a noble resentment, retires to his tent; and for a\n      season withdraws himself and his troops from the war. During this\n      interval, victory abandons the army, which for nine years has been\n      occupied in a great enterprise, upon the successful termination of\n      which the honour of their country depends. The general, at length\n      opening his eyes to the fault which he had committed, deputes the\n      principal officers of his army to the incensed hero, with commission\n      to make compensation for the injury, and to tender magnificent\n      presents. The hero, according to the proud obstinacy of his\n      character, persists in his animosity; the army is again defeated,\n      and is on the verge of entire destruction. This inexorable man has a\n      friend; this friend weeps before him, and asks for the hero's arms,\n      and for permission to go to the war in his stead. The eloquence of\n      friendship prevails more than the intercession of the ambassadors or\n      the gifts of the general. He lends his armour to his friend, but\n      commands him not to engage with the chief of the enemy's army,\n      because he reserves to himself the honour of that combat, and\n      because he also fears for his friend's life. The prohibition is\n      forgotten; the friend listens to nothing but his courage; his corpse\n      is brought back to the hero, and the hero's arms become the prize of\n      the conqueror. Then the hero, given up to the most lively despair,\n      prepares to fight; he receives from a divinity new armour, is\n      reconciled with his general and, thirsting for glory and revenge,\n      enacts prodigies of valour, recovers the victory, slays the enemy's\n      chief, honours his friend with superb funeral rites, and exercises a\n      cruel vengeance on the body of his destroyer; but finally appeased\n      by the tears and prayers of the father of the slain warrior,\n      restores to the old man the corpse of his son, which he buries with\n      due solemnities.'--Coleridge, p. 177, sqq.\n\n   41 Vultures: Pope is more accurate than the poet he translates, for\n      Homer writes \"a prey to dogs and to _all_ kinds of birds.

Strabo, however, says, that\n      when the Teucri were migrating from Crete, they were told by an\n      oracle to settle in that place, where they should not be attacked by\n      the original inhabitants of the land, and that, having halted for\n      the night, a number of field-mice came and gnawed away the leathern\n      straps of their baggage, and thongs of their armour. In fulfilment\n      of the oracle, they settled on the spot, and raised a temple to\n      Sminthean Apollo. Grote, \"History of Greece,\" i. p. 68, remarks that\n      the \"worship of Sminthean Apollo, in various parts of the Troad and\n      its neighboring territory, dates before the earliest period of\n      Aeolian colonization.\"\n\n   48 --_Cilla,_ a town of Troas near Thebe, so called from Cillus, a\n      sister of Hippodamia, slain by OEnomaus.\n\n   49 A mistake.

The close union of the\n      arts of prophecy and song explains his additional office of god of\n      music, while the arrows with which he and his sister were armed,\n      symbols of sudden death in every age, no less naturally procured him\n      that of god of archery.

It has been remarked that the _Iliad_ is not definitively\n      closed, but that we are left to suppose something both to precede\n      and to follow it. The bas-relief is equally without limit, and may\n      be continued _ad infinitum,_ either from before or behind, on which\n      account the ancients preferred for it such subjects as admitted of\n      an indefinite extension, sacrificial processions, dances, and lines\n      of combatants, and hence they also exhibit bas-reliefs on curved\n      surfaces, such as vases, or the frieze of a rotunda, where, by the\n      curvature, the two ends are withdrawn from our sight, and where,\n      while we advance, one object appears as another disappears. Reading\n      Homer is very much like such a circuit; the present object alone\n      arresting our attention, we lose sight of what precedes, and do not\n      concern ourselves about what is to follow.\"--\"Dramatic Literature,\"\n      p. 75.\n\n   88 \"There cannot be a clearer indication than this description --so\n      graphic in the original poem--of the true character of the Homeric\n      agora.

The fate\n      which awaits a presumptuous critic, even where his virulent\n      reproaches are substantially well-founded, is plainly set forth in\n      the treatment of Thersites; while the unpopularity of such a\n      character is attested even more by the excessive pains which Homer\n      takes to heap upon him repulsive personal deformities, than by the\n      chastisement of Odysseus he is lame, bald, crook-backed, of\n      misshapen head, and squinting vision.\"--Grote, vol. i. p. 97.\n\n   89 According to Pausanias, both the sprig and the remains of the tree\n      were exhibited in his time.

The\n      goat to Bacchus, because he fed on vines. Diana was propitiated with\n      a stag; and to Venus the dove was consecrated. The infernal and evil\n      deities were to be appeased with black victims. The most acceptable\n      of all sacrifices was the heifer of a year old, which had never\n      borne the yoke.

Dr. Clarke\n      successfully combats the opinion of those who make the Scamander to\n      have arisen from the springs of Bounabarshy, and traces the source\n      of the river to the highest mountain in the chain of Ida, now\n      Kusdaghy; receives the Simois in its course; towards its mouth it is\n      very muddy, and flows through marshes. Between the Scamander and\n      Simois, Homer's Troy is supposed to have stood: this river,\n      according to Homer, was called Xanthus by the gods, Scamander by\n      men. The waters of the Scamander had the singular property of giving\n      a beautiful colour to the hair or wool of such animals as bathed in\n      them; hence the three goddesses, Minerva, Juno, and Venus, bathed\n      there before they appeared before Paris to obtain the golden apple:\n      the name Xanthus, \"yellow,\" was given to the Scamander, from the\n      peculiar colour of its waters, still applicable to the Mendere, the\n      yellow colour of whose waters attracts the attention of travellers.\n\n   99 It should be \"his _chest_ like Neptune.\" The torso of Neptune, in\n      the \"Elgin Marbles,\" No. 103, (vol. ii. p. 26,) is remarkable for\n      its breadth and massiveness of development.\n\n          100 \"Say first, for heav'n hides nothing from thy view.\"\n\n                                                  --\"Paradise Lost,\" i. 27.\n\n        \"Ma di' tu, Musa, come i primi danni\n        Mandassero a Cristiani, e di quai parti:\n        Tu 'l sai; ma di tant' opra a noi si lunge\n        Debil aura di fama appena giunge.\"\n\n                                                     --\"Gier.

Yet there is scarcely any portion of\n      the Iliad where both historical and internal evidence are more\n      clearly in favour of a connection from the remotest period, with the\n      remainder of the work. The composition of the Catalogue, whensoever\n      it may have taken place, necessarily presumes its author's\n      acquaintance with a previously existing Iliad. It were impossible\n      otherwise to account for the harmony observable in the recurrence of\n      so vast a number of proper names, most of them historically\n      unimportant, and not a few altogether fictitious: or of so many\n      geographical and genealogical details as are condensed in these few\n      hundred lines, and incidentally scattered over the thousands which\n      follow: equally inexplicable were the pointed allusions occurring in\n      this episode to events narrated in the previous and subsequent text,\n      several of which could hardly be of traditional notoriety, but\n      through the medium of the Iliad.\"--Mure, \"Language and Literature of\n      Greece,\" vol. i. p. 263.\n\n  102 --_Twice Sixty:_ \"Thucydides observes that the Boeotian vessels,\n      which carried one hundred and twenty men each, were probably meant\n      to be the largest in the fleet, and those of Philoctetes, carrying\n      fifty each, the smallest. The average would be eighty-five, and\n      Thucydides supposes the troops to have rowed and navigated\n      themselves; and that very few, besides the chiefs, went as mere\n      passengers or landsmen. In short, we have in the Homeric\n      descriptions the complete picture of an Indian or African war canoe,\n      many of which are considerably larger than the largest scale\n      assigned to those of the Greeks. If the total number of the Greek\n      ships be taken at twelve hundred, according to Thucydides, although\n      in point of fact there are only eleven hundred and eighty-six in the\n      Catalogue, the amount of the army, upon the foregoing average, will\n      be about a hundred and two thousand men. The historian considers\n      this a small force as representing all Greece. Bryant, comparing it\n      with the allied army at Platae, thinks it so large as to prove the\n      entire falsehood of the whole story; and his reasonings and\n      calculations are, for their curiosity, well worth a careful\n      perusal.\"--Coleridge, p. 211, sq.\n\n  103 The mention of Corinth is an anachronism, as that city was called\n      Ephyre before its capture by the Dorians.

Such gifts gradually became regular, and formed the\n      income of the German, (Tacit. Germ. Section 15) Persian, (Herodot.\n      iii.89), and other kings. So, too, in the middle ages, 'The feudal\n      aids are the beginning of taxation, of which they for a long time\n      answered the purpose.' (Hallam, Middle Ages, ch. x. pt. 1, p. 189)\n      This fact frees Achilles from the apparent charge of sordidness.\n      Plato, however, (De Rep. vi. 4), says, \"We cannot commend Phoenix,\n      the tutor of Achilles, as if he spoke correctly, when counselling\n      him to accept of presents and assist the Greeks, but, without\n      presents, not to desist from his wrath, nor again, should we commend\n      Achilles himself, or approve of his being so covetous as to receive\n      presents from Agamemnon,\" &c.\n\n  202 It may be observed, that, brief as is the mention of Briseis in the\n      Iliad, and small the part she plays--what little is said is\n      pre-eminently calculated to enhance her fitness to be the bride of\n      Achilles.

It was indeed connected with the\n      comparatively low estimation in which female society was held; but\n      the devotedness and constancy with which these attachments were\n      maintained, was not the less admirable and engaging. The heroic\n      companions whom we find celebrated partly by Homer and partly in\n      traditions which, if not of equal antiquity, were grounded on the\n      same feeling, seem to have but one heart and soul, with scarcely a\n      wish or object apart, and only to live as they are always ready to\n      die for one another. It is true that the relation between them is\n      not always one of perfect equality; but this is a circumstance\n      which, while it often adds a peculiar charm to the poetical\n      description, detracts little from the dignity of the idea which it\n      presents. Such were the friendships of Hercules and Iolaus, of\n      Theseus and Pirithous, of Orestes and Pylades; and though These may\n      owe the greater part of their fame to the later epic or even\n      dramatic poetry, the moral groundwork undoubtedly subsisted in the\n      period to which the traditions are referred. The argument of the\n      Iliad mainly turns on the affection of Achilles for Patroclus, whose\n      love for the greater hero is only tempered by reverence for his\n      higher birth and his unequalled prowess. But the mutual regard which\n      united Idomeneus and Meriones, Diomedes and Sthenelus, though, as\n      the persons themselves are less important, it is kept more in the\n      back-ground, is manifestly viewed by the poet in the same light. The\n      idea of a Greek hero seems not to have been thought complete,\n      without such a brother in arms by his side.\"--Thirlwall, Greece, vol.\n      i. p. 176, seq.\n\n          244 \"As hungry wolves with raging appetite,\n        Scour through the fields, ne'er fear the stormy night--\n        Their whelps at home expect the promised food,\n        And long to temper their dry chaps in blood--\n        So rush'd we forth at once.\"\n\n                                                --Dryden's Virgil, ii. 479.\n\n  245 --_The destinies ordain._--\"In the mythology, also, of the Iliad,\n      purely Pagan as it is, we discover one important truth unconsciously\n      involved, which was almost entirely lost from view amidst the nearly\n      equal scepticism and credulity of subsequent ages. Zeus or Jupiter\n      is popularly to be taken as omnipotent. No distinct empire is\n      assigned to fate or fortune; the will of the father of gods and men\n      is absolute and uncontrollable. This seems to be the true character\n      of the Homeric deity, and it is very necessary that the student of\n      Greek literature should bear it constantly in mind. A strong\n      instance in the Iliad itself to illustrate this position, is the\n      passage where Jupiter laments to Juno the approaching death of\n      Sarpedon. 'Alas me!' says he 'since it is fated (moira) that\n      Sarpedon, dearest to me of men, should be slain by Patroclus, the\n      son of Menoetius! Indeed, my heart is divided within me while I\n      ruminate it in my mind, whether having snatched him up from out of\n      the lamentable battle, I should not at once place him alive in the\n      fertile land of his own Lycia, or whether I should now destroy him\n      by the hands of the son of Menoetius!' To which Juno answers--'Dost\n      thou mean to rescue from death a mortal man, long since destined by\n      fate (palai pepromenon)? You may do it--but we, the rest of the gods,\n      do not sanction it.' Here it is clear from both speakers, that\n      although Sarpedon is said to be fated to die, Jupiter might still,\n      if he pleased, save him, and place him entirely out of the reach of\n      any such event, and further, in the alternative, that Jupiter\n      himself would destroy him by the hands of another.\"--Coleridge, p.\n      156. seq.\n\n  246 --_Thrice at the battlements._ \"The art military of the Homeric age\n      is upon a level with the state of navigation just described,\n      personal prowess decided every thing; the night attack and the\n      ambuscade, although much esteemed, were never upon a large scale.\n      The chiefs fight in advance, and enact almost as much as the knights\n      of romance. The siege of Troy was as little like a modern siege as a\n      captain in the guards is like Achilles. There is no mention of a\n      ditch or any other line or work round the town, and the wall itself\n      was accessible without a ladder. It was probably a vast mound of\n      earth with a declivity outwards. Patroclus thrice mounts it in\n      armour. The Trojans are in no respects blockaded, and receive\n      assistance from their allies to the very end.\"--Coleridge, p. 212.\n\n  247 --_Ciconians._--A people of Thrace, near the Hebrus.\n\n  248 --_They wept._\n\n        \"Fast by the manger stands the inactive steed,\n        And, sunk in sorrow, hangs his languid head;\n        He stands, and careless of his golden grain,\n        Weeps his associates and his master slain.\"\n\n                                         Merrick's Tryphiodorus, v. 18-24.\n\n        \"Nothing is heard upon the mountains now,\n        But pensive herds that for their master low,\n        Straggling and comfortless about they rove,\n        Unmindful of their pasture and their love.\"\n\n                                         Moschus, id. 3, parodied, _ibid._\n\n        \"To close the pomp, AEthon, the steed of state,\n        Is led, the funeral of his lord to wait.\n        Stripp'd of his trappings, with a sullen pace\n        He walks, and the big tears run rolling down his face.\"\n\n                                                   Dryden's Virgil, bk. ii\n\n  249 --_Some brawny bull._\n\n        \"Like to a bull, that with impetuous spring\n        Darts, at the moment when the fatal blow\n        Hath struck him, but unable to proceed\n        Plunges on either side.\"\n\n                                             --Carey's Dante: Hell, c. xii.\n\n  250 This is connected with the earlier part of last book, the regular\n      narrative being interrupted by the message of Antilochus and the\n      lamentations of Achilles.\n\n  251 --_Far in the deep._ So Oceanus hears the lamentations of Prometheus,\n      in the play of AEschylus, and comes from the depths of the sea to\n      comfort him.\n\n  252 Opuntia, a city of Locris.\n\n  253 Quintus Calaber, lib. v., has attempted to rival Homer in his\n      description of the shield of the same hero.

He remarks that, \"with two or three exceptions, the imagery\n      differs in little more than the names and arrangements; and the\n      difference of arrangement in the Shield of Hercules is altogether\n      for the worse. The natural consecution of the Homeric images needs\n      no exposition: it constitutes in itself one of the beauties of the\n      work. The Hesiodic images are huddled together without connection or\n      congruity: Mars and Pallas are awkwardly introduced among the\n      Centaurs and Lapithae;-- but the gap is wide indeed between them and\n      Apollo with the Muses, waking the echoes of Olympus to celestial\n      harmonies; whence however, we are hurried back to Perseus, the\n      Gorgons, and other images of war, over an arm of the sea, in which\n      the sporting dolphins, the fugitive fishes, and the fisherman on the\n      shore with his casting net, are minutely represented. As to the\n      Hesiodic images themselves, the leading remark is, that they catch\n      at beauty by ornament, and at sublimity by exaggeration; and upon\n      the untenable supposition of the genuineness of this poem, there is\n      this curious peculiarity, that, in the description of scenes of\n      rustic peace, the superiority of Homer is decisive--while in those of\n      war and tumult it may be thought, perhaps, that the Hesiodic poet\n      has more than once the advantage.\"\n\n  258 \"This legend is one of the most pregnant and characteristic in the\n      Grecian Mythology; it explains, according to the religious ideas\n      familiar to the old epic poets, both the distinguishing attributes\n      and the endless toil and endurances of Heracles, the most renowned\n      subjugator of all the semi-divine personages worshipped by the\n      Hellenes,--a being of irresistible force, and especially beloved by\n      Zeus, yet condemned constantly to labour for others and to obey the\n      commands of a worthless and cowardly persecutor.

The whole scene between Achilles\n      and Priam, when the latter comes to the Greek camp for the purpose\n      of redeeming the body of Hector, is at once the most profoundly\n      skilful, and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the\n      Iliad. Quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of\n      Priam, the rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent, that if\n      genius did not often, especially in oratory, unconsciously fulfil\n      the most subtle precepts of criticism, we might be induced, on this\n      account alone, to consider the last book of the Iliad as what is\n      called spurious, in other words, of later date than the rest of the\n      poem. Observe the exquisite taste of Priam in occupying the mind of\n      Achilles, from the outset, with the image of his father; in\n      gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation; and,\n      lastly, mentioning Hector's name when he perceives that the hero is\n      softened, and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of\n      the conqueror. The ego d'eleeinoteros per, and the apusato aecha\n      geronta, are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the\n      Iliad. They are almost too fine and pathetic. The whole passage\n      defies translation, for there is that about the Greek which has no\n      name, but which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can\n      only be felt in the original, and is lost in an attempt to transfuse\n      it into another language.\"--Coleridge, p. 195.\n\n  296 \"Achilles' ferocious treatment of the corpse of Hector cannot but\n      offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity. The heroic\n      age, however, must be judged by its own moral laws. Retributive\n      vengeance on the dead, as well as the living, was a duty inculcated\n      by the religion of those barbarous times which not only taught that\n      evil inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the injured\n      man; but made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on the\n      fate of the body from which it had separated. Hence a denial of the\n      rites essential to the soul's admission into the more favoured\n      regions of the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on\n      the dreary shores of the infernal river. The complaint of the ghost\n      of Patroclus to Achilles, of but a brief postponement of his own\n      obsequies, shows how efficacious their refusal to the remains of his\n      destroyer must have been in satiating the thirst of revenge, which,\n      even after death, was supposed to torment the dwellers in Hades.\n      Hence before yielding up the body of Hector to Priam, Achilles asks\n      pardon of Patroclus for even this partial cession of his just rights\n      of retribution.\"--Mure, vol. i. 289.\n\n  297 Such was the fate of Astyanax, when Troy was taken.\n\n        \"Here, from the tow'r by stern Ulysses thrown,\n        Andromache bewail'd her infant son.\"\n\n                                           Merrick's Tryphiodorus, v. 675.\n\n  298 The following observations of Coleridge furnish a most gallant and\n      interesting view of Helen's character--\n\n      \"Few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand\n      that has given us the fury and inconsistency of Achilles, gives us\n      also the consummate elegance and tenderness of Helen. She is through\n      the Iliad a genuine lady, graceful in motion and speech, noble in\n      her associations, full of remorse for a fault for which higher\n      powers seem responsible, yet grateful and affectionate towards those\n      with whom that fault had committed her. I have always thought the\n      following speech in which Helen laments Hector, and hints at her own\n      invidious and unprotected situation in Troy, as almost the sweetest\n      passage in the poem. It is another striking instance of that\n      refinement of feeling and softness of tone which so generally\n      distinguish the last book of the Iliad from the rest.\"--Classic\n      Poets, p. 198, seq.\n\n  299 \"And here we part with Achilles at the moment best calculated to\n      exalt and purify our impression of his character. We had accompanied\n      him through the effervescence, undulations, and final subsidence of\n      his stormy passions. We now leave him in repose and under the full\n      influence of the more amiable affections, while our admiration of\n      his great qualities is chastened by the reflection that, within a\n      few short days the mighty being in whom they were united was himself\n      to be suddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise.\n\n      The frequent and touching allusions, interspersed throughout the\n      Iliad, to the speedy termination of its hero's course, and the moral\n      on the vanity of human life which they indicate, are among the\n      finest evidences of the spirit of ethic unity by which the whole\n      framework of the poem is united.\"--Mure, vol. i. p 201.\n\n  300 Cowper says,--\"I cannot take my leave of this noble poem without\n      expressing how much I am struck with the plain conclusion of it. It\n      is like the exit of a great man out of company, whom he has\n      entertained magnificently; neither pompous nor familiar; not\n      contemptuous, yet without much ceremony.\" Coleridge, p. 227,\n      considers the termination of \"Paradise Lost\" somewhat similar.", "title": "The Iliad"}
